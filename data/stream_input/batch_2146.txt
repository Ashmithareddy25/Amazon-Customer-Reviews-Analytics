B004XUMMFE|4.0|Love the tv series, love that amazon prime has the HD version for online viewing. 4 out of 5 just because the watchlist service could be improved to remember where I left off. Sometime it does not remember.
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|Great mouse for the money.  Better than I expected to get from a low price mouse.  Still learning what all it can do.
B009UX2YAC|1.0|so boring and it doesn't even save my progress I had 980000 coins and now its gone I hats this app
B008AK8FHM|1.0|Becoming aware in a mud-like world sounds awful. Flying around as others are on the ground is off putting, and becoming one with God in pitch blackness is frightening. What's the point of this heaven? He never tells us. Just an empty travel review. No insight or enlightenment. Heaven just is 'cause I'm a neurosurgeon, so I should know what I'm talking about. Well, yeah, seems we're talking about money here and lots of it. For that guy. Very disappointing.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This was a fascinating story with all the twists and turns of a good novel. I like a book that I cannot figure out the ending until the ending takes place and this was it!
B00271HAK8|1.0|I was showing this to you teen age  grandchildren.  One asked to turn it off as the language was offensive to him. Where are the good, decent moral movies today?
B008FPOIT6|2.0|I personally had a hard time keeping track of the characters and some of them made no sense to me. I never did finish the book because I got tired of the story.
0765356147|3.0|Fantastic world, great story, creativity on a ridiculously good level. Impressive work. The depth in these books is astounding.<br /><br />I have just ONE problem with this series. Just one! Well, maybe two.<br /><br />I would like Mr Sanderson to circle the word \\"yet\\" every time it appears in his books. Everybody says it. Peasants, village elders, priests, thieves, all use the word in exactly the same way, and you can find this word on almost every single page of this book.<br /><br />I would also like him to take random bits of dialogue from each character, scramble them, and try to determine who said what. I guarantee you, other than Spook with his slang, it is IMPOSSIBLE to tell who's taking unless he tells you who it is. Everybody sounds exactly the same. Kings, peasants, thieves, merchants, men, women, village elders, all the same voice, same tone, same vocabulary, same everything.<br /><br />I didn't read this book for the characters, or I'd have stopped at book #1. Instead, the world and its gods and its story was drawing me in. But to be perfectly honest, if every character in this book got killed, I wouldn't care.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|Suspense and a growing doubt make this novel a disturbing story of what goes wrong in a child's development and a parent's sense of responsibility.
B009331ENC|5.0|The series masterfully makes you look at loyalty and question \\"who are the good guys?\\"  I really enjoyed the entire first year and look forward to the second.
B005CRQ4OW|5.0|The book was good<br />I  liked it. It is good for  children<br />I am 8 years old. This is my mom's account. She bought this book for me. This book is very funny.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Love it. Obsession at first sight. Coins are easy to earn. I have played off and on all day, and didn't have to spend money.
B000022TSF|5.0|This was my favorite film from college. I took a classical film class and would read poetry and plays from eras long gone, then watch the movies that were closely reflected. Not all movies in Hollywood end with a happy ending.
B00881VLCE|4.0|This is a great app to pass the time when you are waiting at the doctor's office or at the soccer field watching the kid's practice
B008AK8FHM|5.0|This is a phenomenal recounting of personal experience unlike any I have read regarding not only the afterlife but the real existence of many other universes beyond what we know.  So many people are determined to believe that this is it here on Earth, this is as good as it gets, that we are the superior beings of the universe, and choose to deny there is a being called God.  I wish this was required reading for our governmental leaders!  It gave me such a sense of comfort and peace to read and an even greater anticipation of my life someday after death, as well as knowing how loved all of them are who have already gone before me who I miss!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Such an addicting and fun game! I can play for hours! One of the best apps out right now! :)
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This is one of my favorite books ever!! I am 10 years old and though people say this Is \\"inappropriate\\" it wasn't at ALL. I like how katniss is a strong female character, but personally think that her sister prim is whiny and useless. I like dystopian society type of books, and if you like THE HUNGER GAMES trilogy, you should read:<br /><br />The MACHED trilogy<br /><br />the DIVERGENT trilogy<br /><br />THE GIVER
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|Really fun app. But I don't like that he is then only one working. Would like more helpers unless I'm not figuring out how to utilize the others in town or if they become available later on. And he gets tired to fast. He needs more energy. Or not helpers. But all in all. Good game.
B0096PYUE2|1.0|Not for me or my Kindle. Didn't work right. Unistalled the app. Don't know what else I can write to get to 17 words.
B005WUHAX8|2.0|It was for my granddaughter for her birthday, she did what it said and it leaked so we sent it back.
B000PKG7TI|5.0|I've lost count of how many times I've watched this dvd. Nightwish is my favorite band, and definitely the best of symphonic metal. Tarja's voice and Tuomas' genius and are a powerful combination. Overall, this is a beautiful concert; every time I watch it, I mourn the fact that I live in America instead of Europe.
B005GSZZ1A|5.0|Great book that often reads like a novel. A great insite into the screwed up country that is North Korea.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Season 3 is a splendid, true work of art.  Wonderful acting by all parties.<br />In fact, all 3 seasons had my wife and me glued to our seats.<br />We started one month ago...downloaded all seasons this year.<br />I am (almost) speaking in the early English manner; cheers.<br />We will miss Matthew Crowley.  Edith and Rose are the new stories...hmm.<br />Looking forward to Season 4.<br />Thank you.
B003TTMFCK|5.0|Grey's Anatomy is my favorite show. I find what goes on in the hospital with the doctors interesting and sometimes even sad.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|This is a really helpful ap. It enables you to keep track easily of how much battery is left.  It also allows for the breakdown of how much battery time is left for individual activities such as music, reading and so on.  This means you don't end up charging your kindle as much as you can be sure if you have enough battery for a trip out, and you can be safe in the knowledge that your kindle won't run out of battery as well.
B00B2V66VS|2.0|hard to use, real confusing, just do not like it, i will never use try it again, you must need an iq a lot higher than mine to play the game

B007P6VM8Q|5.0|Came as expected. The Hives are amazing, you will not be disappointed! I recommend this purchase immediately. Today today today!
B00AR1G3FS|5.0|I've had this show on DVD since it released.  The show was recorded from Melbourne, Australia.  I'm not a country fan but I do love the Eagles.  Their music transcends all cultures.  A few years ago, we had a spy plane forced down in China after it collided with a Chinese fighter plane.  The plane and the crew were held for months.  The guards wanted to know the lyrics to 'Hotel California'.  So they came up with the lyrics with the help of the guards.  The Eagles' music sounds great and there was a packed crown in attendance.  I will purchase the Blu-Ray of this tour when it's released.
B008WCP2PG|5.0|The DVD was in great condition and worked perfectly. We are very happy with this purchase. We would certainly order another DVD.
B005D81W5Q|4.0|While it’s not a action packed shoot’m up film, but it is funny. Elizabeth Halsey (Cameron Diaz) has little redeeming value to start off the movie. After being dumped by her rich fiancée she must return to teaching. She’s just putting in her time trying to figure out how to get a rich guy. Scott Delacorte (Justin Timberlake) shows up as a “rich” substitute teacher who is a goofy guy and Ms Halsey sets her sights on him and his wallet. Of course Amy Squirrel (Lucy Punch), the ever perky teacher, causes problems with that regard. All the while Russell Gettis (Jason Segel) is hitting on Elizabeth. There are a lot of great one liners and the car wash scene is worth the time of the movie.
B001NLKZUA|4.0|If you enjoyed Twilight and hunger games you will enjoy this book. Among the supernatural storyline is a great story about loving who you love or loving who you should love.  Good read!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This is a cool game and it is addicting...<br />.<br />.<br />.<br />.<br />.<br />.<br />.<br />.<br /><br />.<br />.<br />.

B008JFUUQ2|5.0|We have watched this over and over again!<br />It's very funny! great music!<br />I would tell others to Order this!
B000IDEQTK|4.0|I just discovered prime movies and this was a very enjoyable movie especiall if you like chick flicks. Helen Hunt was very good.
B008LVCKH6|4.0|This was a good read, sometimes predictable, but also unique. I rarelly laugh aloud when I'm reading, but this book had its moments.
B001ANSSDC|3.0|It wasn't a bad read - but it didn't knock my socks off by any means, and I didn't like the ending.
B005P1YCNK|5.0|great book for the single proprietor of a business. Good quick read and packed with information I will be able to use immediately.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|A simple, straightforward calculator application. A little sluggish but otherwise works great. Downloaded to crunch numbers on the fly. Does the trick well.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|awesome! this game is awesome! you should get it! once your on levlel six you can groom your horse and ar levlel five you can. tuck out their stable!
B00BESM14U|2.0|I went into the movie with high hopes. Unfortunately, my hopes were soon dashed.  This movie worked really hard to be deep, and worked way too hard.  The scenes seemed forced, with many cliches in play, but with just enough of a twist on those cliches that you did not immediately know what movie you saw all this before.  The first hour of the movie nothing much happens.  It is just straight up boring.<br /><br />The last 40 minutes, the movie finally starts to move a bit.  The flashbacks with Charile's Aunt were good, and what was going on back then did surprise me, and I was impressed Emma Watson, who did much with the little she was given.<br /><br />But, I will leave you with this, the main character, Charlie, is supposed to be 14!  The kid always looks like he is 20, no matter how hard they mat his hair to his head.
B004J4WN0I|5.0|I forgot my true surroundings as I read myself right into the Arizona backdrop being described.  Oberon kept me laughing and I couldn't wait to see his next thought.  This writer deserves a plate of chicken apple sausages for this one!

B0097EWK3A|4.0|fun and entertaining. good graphics easy to follow and hints are always welcome when I'm stuck in the game. like the plot and cant wait to play Enigmatis II
B00913DPW2|3.0|I like this kind of games but there aren't many clear clues&hellip;no hints in case you're stuck. it can be frustrating...I ended up deleting it. if there are no mayor adjustments to the game I would say it is a waste of time
B003Z9Q4WG|5.0|For the amount of music in this set, this is an amazing deal. Yes, you have to be careful with the CD sleeves, so I take them out and put them in plastic cases when they're in the car.<br /><br />The sound is very warm and full. And there are so many symphonies in the set, that I don't think I'll grow tired of the music for a long, long time.<br /><br />Great Shostakovich symphonies.
B0052RDHTM|4.0|Follett writes books that are each very different from each other but they are all worth reading.  His plots keep you on the edge of your seat.  His characters are both interesting and believable.  I have yet to read one of his books I didn't enjoy.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I'm a John Grisham fan so I was very happy to purchase his new novel.  I enjoy reading his books.
B004SJ3BCI|2.0|I really don't play it very often and found it difficult to use on a small screen.  I wish I would have known you couldn't see the target while firing.
B000JMKTLO|4.0|Interesting novel about a unique reporter who revisiis her hometown and odd family and community.  I love getting books for my Kindle.

B00395ZYVS|5.0|Read this for book club.<br />Not somthing I woulld have normally chosen, but it was an enjoyable book.<br />Makes you think about what a great country we live in.<br />Brings to light the struggles of others, especially females.
B004GUSG4M|4.0|Easy to get through.<br />Finished in two days<br />Kept me wondering how it was going to turn out<br /><br />Would read more by this author
B004W2UBYW|5.0|A very well documented book about one of the most influential men in recent history.<br />It says the good and the bad about this iconic man.
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|great for someone who cant do much. really addictive &amp; fun. my friends like it to. helps pass the time between physical therapy exercises.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I could not put the book down once I started reading it. The author took the time to develop the characters and the gradual build up to tie end kept me on the edge of me seat.  This is a must read!!!
159562015X|5.0|This is a great tool to help you discover yourself! It gives great insight and encouragement. I would recommend it to high school level and up.
B00B49L7JY|5.0|Loved the movie! Hoping it wins that Oscar next week. :) Player was only worth 3 stars (+/- .5), though.
1416955070|4.0|It's like reading book made by the creators of Pretty Little Liars, a pinch of Harry Potter, and a teaspoon of Catholicism.<br /><br />A lot of the characters don't have the emotional maturity to express themselves. They are teenagers. They often respond with teasing, sarcasm, and one-up-man-ship.  Like being in high school.<br /><br />As a adult, I thought I would relate to this book like Twilight.  Twilight, even with it's other issues with gender stereotypes, vampire-sci-finess aside, Twilight did a pretty good job capturing the high school experience with Bella's narrative. It was very routed in reality.<br /><br />As a teenager, escapist fantasy fiction like this is comforting.  Real world is so hectic and stressful, it's nice to think of a world where you are fighting for good and evil and magical powers.<br /><br />UPDATE: I wrote above review, while I was like 60 pages away from the end.  It made such a shift that I can't wait to read the next book and see where it goes.  It kind of reminds me about the second dialogue X-men does.  It's not about people with superpowers but touches on the holocaust of the Japanese Internment camp.  How people can turn on each other.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|It's a great game but Amazon needs to get more popular games. Maybe something like fun run or something because the games in the app store are pretty much generic
B008MG1E4A|5.0|This is really a great book!!  A great first hand account on the mission to kill OBL!  One concern I have is too many guys talking about the our covert operations.
B007BFSYMS|5.0|This app is exactly what I need to get some sleep in hotels;  its got a lot of different sounds, so you can always find one to block out the surrounding noise.
B00B4VI8MQ|5.0|REVISED REVIEW:<br /><br />I tried again and it installed quickly with no problems.  I'm glad I did that because this game is awesome !<br /><br />The graphics are super.  For example, when you turn a key it looks like a real woman's arm and hand is turning the key.<br /><br />There are LOTS of hidden object scenes.  You find objects along your adventure that you use in other places.  Very challenging.  Plus the minigames each allow you to skip them if you want to.<br /><br />The game is very long too, well worth the $2.99 to open the full version.  I love how g5 games let you sample them for free before buying.<br /><br />Highly addictive!  You'll love this.
B007I2BZIE|5.0|Musicianship: this album outstrips everything Rush has done. It is a tour-de-force of heavy, yet brilliant, wizardry.<br /><br />Storytelling: while not as groundbreaking, ominous and foreboding as 2112, CA is a more complete, better developed and ultimately more satisfying story. A true concept album. That genre was given up for dead decades ago. Rush has thrown it right back in our faces, better than ever. Ballsy.<br /><br />Energy: let yourself go with the coldfire steampunk fantasy. There is a remarkable depth and force in this recording. Many reviewers have mentioned that this album just gets better with repeated listenings. I completely agree. CA is full of riffs, thunder and grind, interspersed with shimmering textures and surprising (even for Rush) twists and turns. It will have you singing to yourself things like \\"I have stoked the fire on the big steel wheels\\" and \\"I wish I could LIVE IT ALL AGAIN\\"... Sure, your non Rush fan friends (???) might think you're strange, but that to me would be a compliment. \\"His mind is not for rent...\\"<br /><br />Appeal: Rush fans, this is the album we've been waiting for... This one was made just for us (as they all were, but this one feels... more so). It is awesome that just as Rush finally gets inducted into the R&R HOF, instead of pandering to the critics and the unthinking masses, these three masters decided to focus even more intently on us, their remarkable, passionate and dedicated (some may rightly say obsessive) fan base.<br /><br />I enjoyed the novel as well, although it is not a 5 star offering. I'll review it \\"over there\\".<br /><br />Yes, the days of soaring art-rock tomes like Xanadu, Jacob's Ladder and La Villa Strangiato have passed, and I dearly love those, and almost all of Rush's earlier music, but I for one cheer them on into the future. This is cause, as the story goes, for optimism. Hey... I hope tending the garden does not mean laying down the tools!
B00005NKKY|1.0|It was kind of awful; bunch of songs I never heard; don't think it was digitally remastered.  I think I ordered it by mistake actually

B007ONSLLQ|4.0|I bought this album because I knew I liked a few of the songs.  I love the intensity that Lzzy brings to the songs.  A few of the songs in the middle of the album aren't my favorites, but the album starts off great.  I also love &#34;Here's To Us&#34; even though it's a bit more mellow.

B000002UYZ|5.0|When this and the other one (The Blue Album), came out on CD way back when ('93 maybe?), I intended to buy both of them.<br />I bought the blue one first because it has more of the songs that I was into at the time.<br />I had paid $32 for it, so when it came time to get the red one, I kind of had terminal procrastination...<br />It turns out that I never did follow up and get this one until now (I know, what's that about, right?).<br />After all these years these two albums have been re-released and are remastered, but they also come in a different type of flip-fold case, which I'm assuming is all paper.<br />I thought my original Blue Album sounded fine, so I ordered this one (finally) to match it.<br />It's in the big, wide, double jewel case, with the little booklet, just like they used to be except that the center of mine is not red (like they used to be).<br />It's black in the middle, but I'm ok with that.<br />So now, after 20 years, I have both of them.

0307887960|5.0|Update: Been on this for 5 days...and lost a couple of pounds water weight. This does not seem to be working and I am very disappointed. Usually when you stall it is because you are cheating too much (i.e. not following protocol). I have not found this to be a panacea I expected. I did find a group MInMins in UK which was good for info..and a few other places.<br /><br />The most difficult part of this is the lack of fiber. I have to have fiber.<br />I found myself FRUSTRATED at the lack of progress and took adipex..which completely shut down my bowels.<br /><br />I was not going to weight myself..and just do the diet..but Minimins likes lots of details to I caved in.<br />My husband is totally NOT supportive in any way.<br /><br />If the diet had worked and had not caused constipation I would be all in. Dukan says to take rhubard for the bowels.<br /><br />I am not happy but the food I have had has been good.<br /><br />Oh yeah the adipex makes me grumpy...and insomnia. I wished Dukan worked.<br /><br />I lost fifty pounds each on two other diets.<br /><br />I was hoping for a life changer diet...so I would have a good maintenance plan..Back to the drawing board.<br /><br />DUKAN pooh poohs Americans too. He is a jerk.<br /><br />Original:<br />This book is not an easy read. It is not hard (as in big words or concepts). It is repetitive. Nonetheless...Dr. Dukan explains things. And I believe him and I have FAITH in the diet. And I like him. I am looking for a diet for LIFE. Something sustainable. Something easy. I have never done weight watchers. Only diets I have really done were HCG (lost 50 pounds) and Adipex (lost 50 pounds).  I was concerned about the Protein part in the HCG..and Dr. Dukan simply tells you to drink water  1 1/2 quarts. He also says if you have low blood pressure to only drink 1 1/2 quarts. I LOVE his tone and his approach. I resent websites that offer reviews and know nothing about the diet. Good luck...

B0073LWEXK|5.0|This game had beautiful scenery and I loved being able to change seasons. The only complaints I have are that I had to use the hint and map guide the intire game. its almost impossible to know what to do without them. But if you don't mind that then this is a great game.

B0060MYM7O|4.0|I feel as if a 4-star review is necessary for what was still a very enjoyable season of Game of Thrones, if only to drive home the point that there was a lot to be disappointed about in Season 2.  Spoiler alert - The absence of a Ned Stark-like character as a central point of reference leaves the story chasing after several different narratives.  While the acting is generally quite good (Peter Dinklage remains excellent), it can be quite jarring to hop from story-to-story, all while introducing several new characters.<br /><br />Much of Season 2 culminates in the naval/land battle in the penultimate episode, which was outstanding.  When Game of Thrones is at its best, it's the closest thing to a summer action blockbuster you'll see on network or cable TV.  But if every episode were like that one, HBO would go bankrupt.  As such, much of Season 2 was spent following Emilia Clarke trying to find her dragons, or watching scenes with heavy dialogue as the writers tried to develop characters 8 minutes at a time out of a 60-minute episode.<br /><br />Still a great show, but the writing lacked the focus of the very excellent Season 1.  Much of that may be due to the source material, but it's still the job of the writers to apply that material (or deviate) from it in a manner necessary to fill a compressed 10-episode season of television.

0802798225|5.0|This is one of my all time favorites in YA romance. The characters are amazing. The alternating POVs really let me into the minds of Alex and Brittany. I recommend this book for everyone who wants a bit of romance in their lives.<br /><br />When I first saw this book, I thought this would be a nice, simple romance that I could relax and read in the summer. Boy, I was wrong. In a good way. The story is more complicated and deeper than I expected.<br /><br />I love Alex. His dialog, which has some Spanish mixed into sometimes is really really sexy. He is the typical bad boy, but his background with the gang and the family really touched me. I can really see how torn he is between doing what he wants and doing what is best for his family. Also, despite his bad boy side, he is also really sweet and romantic.<br /><br />At first, Brittany seemed like a typical cheerleader. Blonde, popular, with a popular boyfriend. However, there is so much more to her. The choice she made in regards to keeping her reputation or being with the guy she loves really made me appreciate her. Her home life also made her so much more real. Seeing her with her sister allowed me to see past her perfect facade that she puts up in front of everyone.

0374533571|1.0|I can barely believe how this, one reader called it \\"juvenile\\", novel got published in the first place? Now this mediocre novelist, Matthew Quick, sorry bro' I know you worked hard to write a novel. But where were the editors, and why in the world did Sarah Crichton publish this novel? So the writer's catapulted into fame and fortune with only a germ of a story that was immensely improved by the script writer who should win an academy award for turning the \\"novel\\" into a really interesting movie when the original gave him so little to work with. The main character is just infuriating, and I can't just excuse this as a mental illness, even a \\"nut\\" would be more interesting than this guy. He's less than pathetic, he's \\"stupid.\\" And the rest of the story, mostly about football, is mostly boring, especially when you see how Hollywood improved it.<br />The novel is poorly structured,averagely at best written, poorly plotted, the chapters titles are insufferable, the barrage of \\"letters\\" included in the novel too much, too long, and mostly uninteresting. Dump them for the most part as the script writer did and use the theme, as he did, to tighten and heighten the effectiveness of the story.<br />Now Matthew Quick has a two book deal,how in the world did he pitch this inferior novel to Hollywood? And it will be interesting to see what he can do in the future. I'm not optimistic, I don't think he can live up to the hype. He may have some talent, I'll give \\"Playbook\\" that much, but, you know, easy fame and fortune can ruin a writer, the expectations alone, now that he's \\"famous,\\" have the potential of ruining him. The movie only proves just how much out of his depth he was when he wrote the novel, I can only hope that he improves, hope, I said.<br />What a strange odyssey. A maybe less than average novel is made into a good movie, the writer is largely ignored except to go out and \\"shill\\" the movie, he gets easy, unearned success, there are thousands of better novels self-published, or never published out there that makes me conclude that the whole scene, who didn't know this, is all money driven, and a young, inexperienced, he did get his MFA, writer becomes a mere pigeon for the powers that be and becomes a mere pawn in the game.blished, or never published out there that makes me conclude that the whole scene, who didn't know this, is all money driven, and a young, inexperienced, he did get his MFA, writer becomes a mere pigeon for the powers that be and becomes a mere pawn in the game.
B0061TQBRK|5.0|I have been a fan of LC since Karmacode. I then slowly found their older works and fell into love with the sound. Dark Adrenaline has a newer sound with more of Andre singing than I would like to see. I have grown to love this cd since the complexity of LC is still there. I recently saw an interview from Cristina and Andre and they made a good point. She said that LC has maintained their \\"roots\\" even though they have progressed or something like that. Which I do agree with. I did not see how Shallow Life or Karmacode fit into the picture but now that I look at each CD as a progression in learning, I see overall growth and a band I still love to listen to.

B00BGD07KS|4.0|It has been awhile since Mariah Carey has came out with a good song. Her last album Memoirs Of An Imperfect Angel was an absolute disgrace and her last song Triumphant was a absolutely degrading song. Her last time she had made a song for the movie, she made it for the failed Glitter soundtrack, with Never Too Far and the lackluster Loverboy. But for her latest single, Almost Home from the upcoming Oz, The Great & Powerful is a bit better than her other movie songs, and her last singles that failed to drive. Her personal life the past several years has taken more of a mixed bag with losses, both with Michael Jackson and the definitive Whitney Houston, and newfound joy with the birth of her twins with Nick Cannon. This song though takes Mariah musically a turn into the right direction. The song is definitely better than the wasted tracks from the past years like Obsessed and her lacklsuter cover of Foreigner's I Want To Know What Love Is. This song though is one of her better tracks in awhile, and definitely something to check out.<br /><br />Song: B-

B005GSZZ1A|4.0|This was the book which got all my classmates riveted to their seats begging me to tell me more about his progress.<br /><br />It is never easy to find out what exactly is happening in North Korea, and so very information is actually known about the hermit country. Finding out what it was like in that country was truly an eye-opener - how Shin Dong Hyuk lived his life in the camp, how he was brought up, how he was taught to tell tales about his parents and siblings, how there were no human relations within the camp, how betrayal was the only way to survive, how one man told him what he was missing out on the outside world, how it led him to the escape.
B00980IA3M|5.0|I recently purchased these recordings on mp3 (two separate volumes). These two mp3 sets or the complete set on CD offer all 13 Wagner operas for under $100! When I began listening to opera in the mid 1990s, a full priced single opera was more than half this price. So this is a must-have if you are new to Wagner or want to hear recordings other than what you have. I am very familiar with various recordings of the later 10 operas (Flying Dutchman thru Parsifal). But the earliest 3 operas are rarely performed or recorded, so this is the first time I've ever heard them. I enjoyed them, though they are not on the level of Wagner's mature work. Just very nice, early-romantic style opera. Nothing earth-shattering but very attractive music. That was my main reason for getting this, to hear the earliest 3 operas for the price of one ($45 for vol 1 mp3s). Plus you get excellent recordings of the mature operas, which for me are bonuses.<br /><br />All of these recordings are among the best, but I want to say a bit more about Levine's Ring Cycle: Until now I'd never heard his audio version, only seen a related production on VHS, which was my introduction to the Ring in the mid 1990s. I enjoyed the video then and am sure it looks/sounds much better on DVD. I will buy it if I ever have the spare cash (I usually prefer opera audio only so I can visualize in a theater of the mind).<br /><br />For awhile I wasn't into Levine's Wagner, mainly because of slow tempi. But I've recently revisited and reevaluated his work, deciding that the sheer beauty of his interpretation and the sound of the Met orchestra outweighs any test of my patience. If I get restless in the presence of such sublimity, the fault is surely mine.<br /><br />I really don't understand the harsh complaints in some reviews. Every Ring has its quirks, but this one holds up well in comparison to the more acclaimed recordings. I am very familiar with Solti, Bohm and Janowski. I've also heard Sawallisch, Furtwangler and Krauss. Behrens does not have the power of Nilsson, but she sings a very beautiful and more feminine Brunhilde. So it's a matter of preference:  a more powerful or more vulnerable beauty. I also found little to complain about in the Siegfried of Goldberg. Again he's not the most powerful on record, but still valid and very enjoyable. All other principals are great without any reservations!<br /><br />Levine can be slow but never drags in my opinion. The Met orchestra and recording quality sound BETTER than any of the above famous recordings. While those certainly deserve their legendary status, the Met is easiest on the ears and Levine allows the music to breathe when appropriate, whereas Solti and Bohm feel rushed at times. So for my two cents, this is tied for best overall Ring with Solti, whose only edges are Nilsson, a bit more intensity and historical status.

B00A8ZZ2Z0|4.0|Yep! They've done it again with their class. However, I'll try to not compare it to their previous material.<br /><br />To my ears, this album is a perfect example of utilizing every instrument without sounding tiresome, complacent, or self-indulgent. Just exactly perfect.<br /><br />Those riffs and powerful rhythms.....The drums - man, Dani Loeble is one hell of a machine! Andi Deris has the right combination of power, menace, and emotion that makes each track all the more convincing. The genius of Michael Weikath's song-structuring skills is outstanding. Sascha Gertsner & Marcus Grosskopf round out what is an awesome band.<br /><br />Whoever was in charge of selecting the track order has got it right with the flow of the album. Starting the album with Nabataea is a stroke of genius as it contains Deris at his best delivering a very memorable chorus to set off an album you could say is a `chorus-fest' which never gets boring. I too have also taken advantage of downloading the Japanese-only bonus track `No Eternity' - a worthy addition that should have been on the album anyway.<br /><br />I find it too hard to pick highlights from a consistently strong collection. It's one of those special albums that are excellent to sing along with whilst driving. My car audio system is going to take a pounding in the years to come.<br /><br />I luv it!<br /><br />Give it an open-minded go and make up your own mind.<br /><br />Enjoy.

B005J6LKVI|4.0|While I did enjoy the movie, I felt it felt short in portraying the book accurately. But I guess most movies based on books are like this. What I really didn't like was the fact that they added stuff in the movie that was never in the book, they changed it. I felt the book was perfect just the way it was written. I wouldn't discourage anyone from seeing this movie though, it was still a great movie.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Enjoyed this book.  It was a very good read.  The story had a unique plot that kept you wanting to find out what would happen next.  I have shared it with others.

B0095P29EG|5.0|Unlike SO MANY movies that try to re-write the past of characters from Lore this one simply sticks to it.  Rather than going back and re-telling Thor's history from a modern angle they simply decided to go with what has been written for many ages and embrace it.  They then move forward with the story from the current date.  If you've read the comic book series you will realized that they combined many story lines into this one and left others out.  They will be used in the second movie.  We meet Thor and see that he is arrogant as he was in the beginning of lore and the beginning of the comic book series.  Then we get to see him as he makes his human friends that will be needed later in the subsequent movies/story lines.  Then we get to see him get his abilities back and lose some of his arrogance.  In the end it was another great movie in the Avengers story line and worth a watch.

B005UG53NS|3.0|After getting suckered into watching the first movie years ago.  This movie ends the series.  It is a good adaptation of the book and like most adaptations it would have been done better in some area's.  The movie though does explain a few details better than the book did and that was the author's intent when she reviewed the script that had been written.  In the end however I still think more could have been done.  The part of Harry's death reeks of religious belief and is done in the movie much like the 'Passion of the Christ' to give Harry the 'Chirst' appeal by the death and rebirth.  Even though I don't think it was needed.  It gets old that more and more movies are putting this into their plots and story lines.  Well, in 15 years they'll do a 'remake' of it as they did with 'Total Recall' and others.  Maybe it will be better.
030788743X|4.0|I'm not a fan of video games. In fact, I hate them. But Ready Player One was an interesting science fiction novel. \\"It's the year 2044, and the real world is an ugly place. Like most of humanity, Wade Watts escapes his grim surroundings by spending his waking hours jacked into the OASIS, a sprawling virtual utopia that lets you be anything you want to be, a place where you can live and play and fall in love on any of ten thousand planets. And like most of humanity, Wade dreams of being the one to discover the ultimate lottery ticket that lies concealed within this virtual world. For somewhere inside this giant networked playground, OASIS creator James Halliday has hidden a series of fiendish puzzles that will yield massive fortune--and remarkable power--to whoever can unlock them. For years, millions have struggled fruitlessly to attain this prize, knowing only that Halliday's riddles are based in the pop culture he loved--that of the late twentieth century. And for years, millions have found in this quest another means of escape, retreating into happy, obsessive study of Halliday's icons. Like many of his contemporaries, Wade is as comfortable debating the finer points of John Hughes's oeuvre, playing Pac-Man, or reciting Devo lyrics as he is scrounging power to run his OASIS rig. And then Wade stumbles upon the first puzzle. Suddenly the whole world is watching, and thousands of competitors join the hunt--among them certain powerful players who are willing to commit very real murder to beat Wade to this prize. Now the only way for Wade to survive and preserve everything he knows is to win. But to do so, he may have to leave behind his oh-so-perfect virtual existence and face up to life--and love--in the real world he's always been so desperate to escape.\\"<br /><br />Sounds intense, right? It is. There are a lot of 1980's references that I did not get, not being particularly impressed with culture at that time. And I really hate video games. The OASIS doesn't soundlike a utopia to me; it sounds like a dystopia. Imagine it, the lines of reality and virtuality (is that a word?) blurring until it's hard to tell what is real and what is not. It's nightmarish actually, like something out of the Twilight Zone. Plus, the real world is in ruins.<br /><br />Ready Player One wasn't an amazing book, but it was a good one, and somewhat thought-provoking. It is certainly not one of the best books in the world, as one of my classmates claims. It wasn't a bad book, though, and I liked the hardcover edition's cover (on right).<br /><br />I loved the character Art3mis (pronounced Artemis). She's smart, pretty, and awesome. I loved her name too.<br /><br />The descriptions in this book are really well done, and Ernest Cline writes well. Though he drops way too many references to 1980's culture. I enjoyed Ready Player One, though it's certainly not one of my favorites. It was pretty suspenseful though.<br /><br />Probably 3.5 stars.<br /><br />My blog is at novareviews.blogspot.com.

B006UIUJ2A|3.0|This book starts off very strongly and we know from the beginning that it's not going to be an easy read. The harshness of life in North Korea is something we know about, but this book brings it to life by the creation of memorable characters and incidents. The author has spent some time in North Korea and so brings first-hand knowledge to his book. The second half of the book did not hold my interest as well, possibly I was suffering from overload. But this is a skilled writer and his mission to expose what a totalitarian society does to its citizens is an important one.

It starts out with the usual excitement - this time in the markets and on the rooftops of Instanbul.  Some villain has stolen the names of all MI-6 agents and will soon start slowly revealing their identities which means they will get killed.<br /><br />I enjoy Craig as James Bond.  He is smart, loyal and has character.  And he comes across as less sexist than Connery. Although loved Connery, too. In this film Bond travels from Instanbul to a remote island, to London to his boyhood home in Scotland which suffers some damage.  The cinematography is inspired in this film with original camera shots and atmospheric lighting.  Javier Bardem plays a convincing villain.  And Bond's new supervisor Q brings the movie up to date as he's a young computer whiz.<br /><br />I liked the special effects although my son said how could you improve on an ice castle which was in an earlier Bond film.<br /><br />Enjoyed the music Adele wrote and sang for Skyfall.
B004VSTP4Y|5.0|I wish Maggie would write another book. This book and the whole series was fabulous. I would love to see Sam and Grace live forever. And to live happily ever after. But I am a romantic so I guess that is why I want more.
B00003CX8V|5.0|Excellent entertainment.  Funny, endearing, and well made.  This is a great movie to watch on New Years' Eve!! Love it!
B009RWRIKM|5.0|defies description, dancers are amazing, the dances are outdoors, indoors, on stage, in the street in the middle of the day . . . there are many stories here . . . the main one is what an incredible group of dancers Pina Bausch attracted to her and what she did for them and you after you once you watch this beautiful picture
B008PQ8XZK|2.0|This is the first Kate Morton book that I've read.  It got such good reviews and I was so looking forward to burying my nose into a good book.  The plot was very good and once I figured out the secret (about 120 pages from the end) I wanted to finish reading it to see whether I was right.  But the book was so laborious.  I found that I could skim through paragraphs because there was just too much detail on trivial stuff that had no need to be in the story.  I won't read a Kate Morton book again :o(
B006LSZECO|4.0|Wow.  I started reading this book and at first I thought that while the story was interesting and the writing itself was excellent, I couldn't understand what all the hype was about.  I was interested in the examination of a marriage from the perspective of both sides and was curious about how it was going to play into Amy's disappearance.  I was even pretty sure I had the gist all figured out early on in the story.  Then about halfway through comes a completely unexpected turn that totally changes everything - the characters and what they're going through and what you thought you knew.  Really I'd give this 4-1/2 stars.  The only thing keeping it from being 5 stars for me was the ending, but even so I have to acknowledge that it couldn't have ended any other way and still have felt honest.  Would strongly recommend.
0525958002|4.0|OK - full disclosure. First, let me say I am an old school Duranie from way back... after first falling for their special brand of white boy sexy funk in 1981 with Planet Earth and Girls On Film, and then enjoying almost every incarnation since. I am now a musician so my (hopefully informed) musical highlights include Careless Memories, Hold Back The Rain, Save A Prayer, Is There Something I Should Know, New Moon On Monday, A View To A Kill, Notorious, All She Wants Is, I Don't Want Your Love, Ordinary World. After that...not so much... except for the fabulous All You Need Is Now (an authentic return to the original sound/pleasure groove).<br /><br />So when I heard about the publication of &#34;In The Pleasure Groove: Love Death and Duran Duran&#34; I really felt compelled to explore the band's journey through the eyes of one of Duran's architects, John &#34;Nigel&#34; Taylor.<br /><br />Wow - what a great read and an articulate insight into the heady and stratospheric career of one of the 80s true cultural icons. John is achingly honest in his disclosures of his struggles with drug use and alcoholism and he documents each milestone along the Duran journey with a clear-headed memory supported by anecdotal evidence corroborated by a cast of characters along the way, including the memories of his band mates Simon, Nick, Roger and Andy.<br /><br />For those aficionados of 80s pop (and especially those who, as teens and young adults, eagerly and feverishly consumed the insights into the pop world provided by Smash Hits and (in Australia) Countdown Magazine), this book is a refreshing memoir of a past era and a survivor of the 1980s pop machine. John Taylor takes you right back there, reminding you of each single release, music video and cultural event that he participated in.<br /><br />You'll love it. So, now, just do it.
B0079KGAOY|2.0|Let's start by saying that while loved and a \\"classic\\" the Lethal Weapon franchise is no longer considered premium material. That's not to say it should be relegated to the bargain bin, it shouldn't. However, that said when releasing packages like this it needs to be specific as to the versions \\"cut\\" of the movie included and should in all reality include any and all versions. Likewise in day and age and given the status of the franchise there is no reason to not include UltraViolet and iTunes Digital copies of the title as well. I understand it's available as a Disc to Digital conversion through service like VUDU (Excellent BTW), however, the buyer shouldn't have to pay another $8+ dollars after shelling out big bucks on the Blu_Ray package.<br /><br />Warner at more value to your aging titles.
B00B5HQLMI|5.0|Great movie! I've been a long time fan of the Bond movies but every once and a while you get let down. Well not with this movie! It was fantastic!
B00770KR7W|5.0|This is a five-star rating because the product is as advertised and came in great condition. I have no dislikes and would recommend this to any Halo fan looking for a figure for your desk or whatnot or as a gift.
B000VBIEXS|2.0|but this shout factory remaster I foolishly purchased isn't. The remastering quality is just awful.<br />Jerusalem is thin, dry and gets slightly louder at about 1:31, karn evil 9: 1st impression is muted,<br />muffled and the drums and bass sound horrible, and Still you turn me on is muddy and damp sounding.<br />I have ordered the sony and it is on the way to my house. I can't wait for it to arrive!<br /><br />Update: The SONY  sounds SOOOOO much better than the SHOUT FACTORY version. If you already own<br />the SHOUT, buy the SONY and throw the SHOUT into the middle of the ocean.
B00AMBLDEE|4.0|Love Amazon but the fact you can't use captions will keep me from paying to rent many movies. That simple. The quality of the film was great as was the sound but with some cases it's helpful to have captions when the music overpowers the talking. Amazon's menu needs work but as with many companies it's a work in progress. However the lack of captions will limit me to only rent movies I can't find anywhere else, whereas DirecTV is too expensive, Netflix seems to have a better and bigger selection of movies with captions.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I am at a loss for words. I loved this book! The love, friendship, heartbreak, sorrow and triumph of the human spirit.....Read this book!
B00ABKGG0C|5.0|Surprised by the depth of this tale.  Looking forward to seeing where the story goes next.  Well worth a read.
B000H5TVJY|5.0|The disc plays the opening logo for 3 seconds and freezes, period.  Unfortunately I was simply collecting my favorite films and didn't think to pop it in until the return window expired.  Thanks for taking my money.  The movie itself is a classic, too bad I can't watch it.
B0052RE4MQ|3.0|Cassia and Ky venture through the carving to find each other and to search for The Rising. Will they be able to find it?<br /><br />There really wasn't much going on in this book when it comes to the plot. Throughout most of this story Cassia, Ky, and friends are just wandering around in the wilderness reciting poetry and looking for The Rising and the Pilot. I didn't feel like there was enough action and excitement. I also didn't feel like the plot developed much either although you did get to know the characters a little better which was nice.<br /><br />The story was narrated by both Ky and Cassia, alternating every chapter. I did enjoy reading from both of their points of views but I found it to be a tad bit confusing. The two characters didn't have a distinct voice and I found it hard to differentiate between the two. I would just be reading along wondering, \\"Why is Cassia talking about herself in that way?\\" when I'd flip back to the beginning of the chapter and realize Ky was the one narrating. That was frustrating to me. I struggled with this throughout the entire book. I wish the author would have done a better job with giving her characters their own \\"voices\\".<br /><br />So while I found this book to be somewhat boring at times and thought Matched was a lot better, I will be reading Reached. I am hoping the next book will be a lot more interesting and of course, I have to see how it all ends. I did enjoy reading this book but it wasn't the greatest.
B001UV4XHY|5.0|It´s a great movie and the DVD was good I recommend to buy by all Harry Potter fans . .
B006VA57CY|5.0|Simply addicting due to how well the show is written and cast.  I didn't really know what to expect when I began watching this series with my girlfriend a month ago.  We're now halfway through season three.
B009EEFTMC|4.0|Fun game to pass time with. Like a mix between mahjong and rubixcube. Doesn't drain the battery to much either
B00B2DSIAI|4.0|I love all pixar films and was not disappointed with this one.  I would like to give it another half star if available but not as good as &#34;Up&#34; and &#34;Nemo&#34; to get into the 5 star category.
B0085D497O|4.0|Well written, with a simple step by step progressive plan for improving your health and fitness.<br />A nutrition primer would only add to the strength of this book.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Such a wonderful story. VERY well written! So descriptive, it was like I could feel what each character was feeling. Absolutely loved it!! A great read for sure.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|Great story can't wait for his part!!<br />Couldn't put in down! Actually kept excited for the next page.<br />Would totally recommend it.
B00AR1G3FS|5.0|I've watched about 3 different Eagles' DVDs and this is the best! Great A/V production with more songs than the other Eagles concerts, and needless to say, this group has one of the best combination of American musicians playing as a band and their Grammy music awards speak for themselves. I've seen their first two 40th-anniversary concerts here in Vegas 2012 but this video outweighs these Vegas performances as far as the number of songs they played. I'd highly recommend this concert video. Could be their best concert production and I'm glad I'll be able to replace my standard version.
B00AZLBIAA|1.0|I downloaded it with an open mind(I read the reviews and thought maybe it will work for me) but it DIDNT!I downloaded it and it gave me a very weird passowrd(&quot;Mr.mcfeely&quot; , &quot;sn00ki&quot; exc.).i tried it and it didnt work.i deleted the app and downloaded it again and it gave me a different password for the same network!This is clearly nothing but a joke that has gone way to far!Don't make the same mistake I made!DO NOT DOWNLOAD IT!THIS APP IS JUST A JOKE(and to the creator:im NOT laughing -_- )!!!!
B0083Z3O8Y|5.0|Jane Austen gets it right again with the heroine being worthy of the great guy. Fun story with good characters.
B009O2XY12|2.0|I like the game but after a few levels it needs real money to keep playing. After waiting awhile you will get another level but will need real money again.  A real pain!!! Clearly team lava only wants the money and if you don't pay game stops.  And fast.
B006YM9JSW|5.0|It's hard to believe after building a machine with this CPU (combined with an Intel Extreme X79SI) is the lowest end CPU for 2011. 4GB transfer in seconds blows me away. What's great is that I can go higher to get even faster. Socket 2011 made it hard to work with anything of a lower quality, so be warned. The sheer performance will make you question why you would ever want to work with anything slower again.<br />Anyways, I got it. It plugged in, worked, and I even got the i7 sticker to put on the front of my case to make my computer buddies jealous.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Very well detailed,realistic,relaxing and all the fun of a pony without the mucking out. Entertained my daughter for ages.the perfect game for horse lovers of all ages.
B0099114WO|3.0|I took this movie for a girls weekend at my Mom&#34;s. Neither one of us is a prude on any level but I would have been uncomfortable seeing this at the theater. Best saved for a &#34;girls night&#34; at home.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|No, this book doesn't solve anything about the JFK assassination but it does comment on life, love and second chances. If you think King only writes horror stories, think again. He's one of the most prolific and imaginative authors of our time.<br /><br />Take a trip back in time with Jake Eppling. If you're like me  you'll enjoy every minute!
B003Y5H574|4.0|Totally cute movie but glad I ddin't spend the time or money to go see it in the theater. Perfect girls night feature for a rainy night at home in your jammies!
B007IVRP8Y|4.0|It seems that every episode of season 1had me at least once a show going, &#34;Whoa, didn't see that coming.&#34; I figured they couldn't do it two seasons in a row. So, I didn't watch the season when it came out back in 2009. I can now I say,  &#34;I missed it.&#34; This is every bit as good I'm my opinion as season 1.
B008WCP2PG|4.0|Again, a movie I am really glad I didn't go to the theater for. Nice flick for a girls evening at home.
B000000OU0|5.0|I am not good @ placing my cd's back in the carton  .  This is a fantistic collection of songs, so I recommend it to any Eagles fan.
014241543X|4.0|Cellist Mia is enjoying a snow day with her close-knit, bohemian family when she suddenly finds herself outside of her body, surveying the wreckage of their car and her own damaged body. Mia is suspended in limbo, her body in a comma, and her life (should she choose to return to it) torn apart. The book moves between Mia's ghost-like existence in the present, as her family and friends rally around her in ICU, and flashbacks that show her life and personality--especially the development of her musical ability and her relationship with her boyfriend, a rising rock star.<br /><br />Even as a 30-something woman, I really enjoyed this book, especially the structure of the plot. I know I would have LOVED it when I was a teenager and gone bananas over the romance (which includes a tasteful and PG-13 love scene). As an adult, however, I didn't feel completely convinced that there was much of a decision for Mia to make; despite the tragedy she would face upon waking from her comma, her life would still be full of love and potential. Also the abrupt ending felt gimmicky. If you buy this book, just go ahead and buy the sequel, Where She Went.<br /><br />Some parents might not like the liberal parenting portrayed in the book, but a teenager could do worse than read this thoughtful exploration about what's meaningful in our lives.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This is one of the best novels I have read in awhile.  I recommend it for a long, cold, snowy night .  You wont want to put it down.
B007REV4T8|5.0|It's wonderful to see a fully realized Bond with relationships and background story.  While I really liked Sean Connery as James Bond (he's what comes to mind when you say &#34;James Bond&#34;), I have to say Daniel Craig really inhabits the character; you see his attachment to &#34;M&#34;, where he comes from, even why he drives the iconic Aston Martin.  And then there's...Javier Bardem...what. a. good. villian!  The pairing of Daniel Craig and Javier is perfect.  Really, if you didn't see the movie in the theater, you have to get this DVD.
B0007Y89ZM|5.0|If you luv the Eagles this is a must have. It has the longest playing music and is one of the best Eagles has made to date !
B00A2LFXVI|3.0|Something was missing from the second half -- tightness, action, story -- that didn't quite measure up to the first half and it almost seemed like a throwaway DVD to compliment the first one.
B000TJ6CPY|5.0|What can I say? I love jazz and I love piano. The two together are orgasmic! Plus Oscar Peterson doing it.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Enjoyed the series. Liked the first book the best.<br /><br />They should make a m o vie of this book<br />Ttttttttttttttttttttttttttt
B00B5HQLMI|1.0|Skyfall is a big failure for James Bond series. A viewer won't find a stirred martini here or last fun gadgets. Not even a plot with a beautiful woman. OK, I heard some people like this movie because it was closer to what agent work in the real world is. Well, plot of this movie is still unrealistic for the \\"real world\\" and weak for an action movie. A viewer won't find an interesting twist here. So let sum it up. No explosive toys or romantic plot with an attractive woman, not even trademark request for \\"shaken not stirred\\" martini is used or \\"Bond, James Bond.\\" As and action movie its OK. There is some decent explosions, but why not to watch DIE HARD movies instead. For a James Bond movie this is FAIL, FAIL, FAIL.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|this game is so cool because you can zip line and go in a cart. and even get to get chased by a huge creature!!! the reason I like it is that you can do all of these cool stuff that will help you or kill you.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I recommend this book to everyone. It is very good reading. I could not put it down until I finished it.
B0011UF792|5.0|I waited a long time to get this movie and it definitely did not disappoint. The video/audio quality was very good. I enjoy this film immensely.
B007SGM084|5.0|Left me wanting more every time I opened it up. Also reawakened my old Dom self from me and my husband's early life together. Reopening the door to our own playroom within the bedroom. Very much inspiring my Valentine's day presents and late activities that night and beyond. Establishing the activities of our younger years together we both missed.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|This selection of songs really touches my heart and soul.  Can't stop playing it over and over again.  You will not be disappointed.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|very nice story and interesting twist at the end of the book. Throughout the story I felt it was going to be a predictable outcome, but then the story surprised me with an enlightening twist. Very nice and pleasant ending. I enjoyed the book.
B006BXTOFC|5.0|From Start to finish the Black Keys fail to disappoint once again.  The innovative sounds that we've come accustomed to hearing from them are yet again brilliantly displayed throughout El Camino.  Any fan of music should take a gander.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I love this game but wish you had separate accounts (ex. Care and work tasks, energy..since they already have different health and care...make them both separate..and I wisj we got to ride more and pick feet for a mini game...so more mini game.
B009GQ57ES|5.0|The Heist is the first hip-hop album I have heard in a while that actually was comprised of real musical talent, and the lyrics contained actual meaning.  Same Love is such a bold statement by Macklemore, and extremely impressive how he flows on that track.  Get past Thrift Shop, the entire album is worth an ear

B003XU7IFY|5.0|A must read if you want to know how things really work, and want to be inspired and instructed in what part you can play in the whole scheme of things.<br /><br />Budding or seasoned activists alike will benefit from this work.
B0002E5O9G|5.0|Excellent CD, I would it recommend highly! Reminds me of being on broadway for the real show, this is a must purchase.
B00422LESO|1.0|I believe I either got this book for free or when it was the Deal of the Day, so I'm relieved that I wasted little to no money on it. I can also definitively say I will not be trying out any other of the author's books.<br /><br />What is it about the book that makes it so atrocious? It's just so....unbelievable. The entire premise. I have a mild interest in Pride and Prejudice, and know several other woman who love it, along with Colin Forth. But the idea that someone is waiting for Mr. Darcy? That this is a common thing, and one's great aunt recognizes it and leaves one a trip to a place SOLELY DEDICATED to living out this fantasy in her will? It's just so...STUPID. I'm a better writer than this, to be calling something simply \\"stupid\\", but honestly, that is the single best adjective for this book.<br /><br />And you know what? I enjoy chick lit. I like losing myself in the fantasy of it all for awhile. I have a lot of those books lining my bookshelves and now my Kindle archives. But this one....good Lord. The premise was so completely awful that it couldn't compensate for the terrible writing ( stereotypes abound throughout the book, I knew the ending as soon as she met the \\"cast\\", run-on sentences, horribly cringe worthy dialogue....I would go into more detail about the author's failings but I honestly don't want to relive it), and the writing was so vomit-inducing that it couldn't make up for the completely unbelievable premise.<br /><br />Do not buy this. If you can get it for free and feel like wasting some hours of your life, fine. Go ahead. But please, PLEASE, don't waste your money on this waste of time, space and energy. I would give this zero stars if I could.

I Mean The First One Was Really Good And Would Be Hard To Beat. But Come On! This Is A Really Cool Movie. The Creatures In This Movie Are Really Creepy And Twisted. It's Eerie, Scary, And Has Some Pretty Disturbing Images. I Love The Cast, They Did A Really Good Job Picking The Actress To Play The Main Character 'Heather Mason aka Sharon' which was supposed to Look like the Main character in the Silent Hill 3 video game. The story line was a bit confusing, but never the less It's an awesome movie man! I understand What some people mean when they say it couldve been a longer movie, but whatever I Mean look at Saw movies they were only an hour and a half each and look how spectacular those were. So to the People Who keep saying this is A horrible movie and giving it only 1 star, you're pathetic and where's your movie??? So here's my rundown if you or your friends wanna see a good horror film pick this up. You will love it :)
B002QZ399G|5.0|Has anything changed in the last 50 years? Everyone wants a friendly government in power in a \\"developing country\\" to help them line their pockets. While some of the characters may seem a little contrived, this was solid acting by Damon and Clooney, and an interweaving of storylines that reminds me of \\"Traffic\\"

The hand strap inside to better hold the Kindle while reading....smart. My favorite part is the way it allows you to rotate the Kindle to a horizontal and vertical position, that makes viewing and gaming better, as well as,better for reading a book.<br />I am so glad I bought this cover and the fact I got it for less,by buying it &#34;like new&#34; No complaints!!!

B009M4KTEM|5.0|While 1980 isn't really considered a standout year for Jerry's main band (though the awesomeness of 'Reckoning' is not up for debate), the short-lived incarnation of the JGB featured here--with John Kahn on bass, Johnny de Foncesca on drums, and Ozzie Ahlers on keys and backup vocals--is both tight and exploratory, with energetic-yet-laid-back grooves that are nearly impossible to listen to while staying completely still.<br /><br />This show features quite a bit of setlist crossover with the excellent 'After Midnight: Kean College 2/28/80,' which took place two nights before, with Jerry's lyricist Robert Hunter once again joining the band during the second set to sing \\"Tiger Rose\\" and \\"Promontory Rider.\\" Still, there are more than enough differences here to warrant a purchase for Jerry fans, especially the stellar, jammed-out versions of Irving Berlin's \\"Russian Lullabye\\" and The Beatles' \\"Dear Prudence.\\" Nearly every song here is over 8-minutes long, and the band is precise and on-point throughout the show. Jerry's voice is soulful and energetic--just check out his bluesy, intense vocals on the killer 16-minute \\"Simple Twist of Fate.\\" His voice very rarely sounded this good again.<br /><br />The recording--taken from the original 24-tracks--is pristine, allowing the listener to fully appreciate Jerry's constant interweaving of his guitar in and around the keyboard and bass parts. Anyone who calls Jerry's guitar-playing \\"lazy noodling\\" should take a listen to just how intricate and beautifully-played his work is here. If there's a negative at all here, it's the aforementioned issue of the setlist's similarity to 'Kean College.' But most Deadheads should know by now that you can never judge a show by the setlist. The amount of improvisation this band does, as well as the way they feed off the crowd, guarantees each show to have it's own unique vibe and energy.<br /><br />'GarciaLive: Vol. 1' is an essential purchase for Jerry fans, one that most likely won't be leaving your rotation for a long time, as the music here will brighten the atmosphere of whatever it is you're doing, whether it's driving, chilling, exercising, having a get-together, etc. You're not going to get to deep \\"inner space\\" like during the second set of a Dead show, but what you will get is a good time and a big smile on your face. It's hard to ask for much more than that.ing your rotation for a long time, as the music here will brighten the atmosphere of whatever it is you're doing, whether it's driving, chilling, exercising, having a get-together, etc. You're not going to get to deep \\"inner space\\" like during the second set of a Dead show, but what you will get is a good time and a big smile on your face.

David plays on all of the songs, produces and arranged the music. His talent shines through. Highly recommend Blu-Ray so you can appreciate the quality.
B005WQ4RP6|5.0|awesome movie! My forensic psy professor brought me here! Very good movie! Especially the last line from Danielle, if we hang on to the past we die a little everyday, me, i rather to live
B007N579X6|5.0|Brilliant movie. One of those movies where everything worked. The 3d really added to an already outstanding movie. Kids will really get a kick out of it.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I'm very addicted. Love this game. I love all the features you can do. I think its cool how you can train and compete and also visit other horses.
B00AHHODH2|3.0|This book was a pleasant read, but not a great read.  I'd describe it as a cute story that is a play on flawed personalities of people of all ages.  Stereotypes represented include: the neighborhood gossips, the dumb and beautiful young wife, the muscle-bound husband, the lonely widower who succombs rather quickly to physical needs.  The best part of the book was the twist at the end.  It created an excellent ending and, at the same time, set the stage for another book to follow.
B002TLSSXO|5.0|Great addition to my kitchen! Thank you.
B00B80ZG6O|5.0|Jonas Kaufmann has the sensitivity and sensibility to convey the nuances one rarely hears from the main stages these days. I highly recommend this cd!
B00A1EOBJQ|5.0|One of the best albums I've ever purchased.  Every song is great.  Never get tired of listening to it. Highly recommend.
B0087JTAKW|5.0|A great story that really makes you question time and the choices we make in our life.  Makes you appreciate the time that you have and stop rushing through things.
B005DQ3B7K|4.0|I guess you must have it if ou are a lover of Art of Noise.  There s a CD and a DVD.  The DVD is the best, it seems the CD is playing the same track sometimes, but that's AoN - many moments in love, etc.  Lots of written info.  Good.
1594488886|1.0|I was really exited to read this book 4 years ago when I was in ninth grade. My dad is Pashtun and I wanted to learn more about Afghanistan and Afghan culture. I was severly dissapointed!    First of all the characters are black and white. Either they are 100% bad or 100% good. Spoilers: Mariam lives a completely and ridiculously horrible life. Laila is a stuck up, perfect girl who has it all. Rasheed is a completely evil person. Laila and Tariq's love story is a soap opera. Errrm let me slow down here. Laila is liked by everyone for her \\"blonde\\" hair. She has no other qualities. It's practically the whole reason anyone ever falls in love with her. I mean how stupid is that! -.- Rasheed so happens to be Pashtun and he has no character development whatsoever! He is just a guy that has no feelings for his two wives and just abuses them. The author never bothers to tell WHY Rasheed might be evil. Rasheed is just evil because he is an Afghani Muslim man. And nothing and I mean NOTHING good or nice ever happens to Mariam. She is not good looking, she does not have nice parents, she has a low self esteem, and she is always being hurt. I understand where the author was going with this, but that MAKES NO SENSE. And frankly I have no clue how Laila and Tariq kept meeting eachother and how they had sex. These countries are extremely conservative, so I'd be really surprised if a girl could EVEN meet a boy in privacy. It seems like Khaled's characters were largely based on stereotypes.    Secondly, the plot and the abuse. The plot was predictable and bland. I've heard these stories before so many times. Can someone say MELODRAMA? Also,the abuse was disgusting. I was sick to my stomach just reading about the torture. If you are sensitive to people's feelings at all, then avoid this book.    Thirdly, how come all of Hosseini's books are about misery and tragedy? Of course I can not say that the terrible things Hosseini talks about do not happen in Afghanistan,  but if he was really trying to show what Afghan culture was really about, then don't you think he would want to talk about NICE things too? The Kite Runner and A Thousand Splended Suns so happened to come out during the peak of the Afghanistan war. I wonder why? It SEEMS like Hosseini is trying to keep the American public supporting the war by manipulating their curiousity, so that the U.S. can do whatever they want in Afghanistan. Hosseini is like the greatest troll on Earth!    Fourthly, what's with the title? The book is about a pile of s*** that landed on another pile of s*** of which then proceeded to s*** on itself. It should be more like \\"A Thousand Cr*ppy Suns\\"    And finally, how come the protagonists are Tajik and the main antagonist Pashtun? Khaled is a Tajik. That raises some questions... Also, Khaled was not actually raised in Afghanistan, so how \\"authentic\\" is this story?    After I read this book, I never wanted to hear of this author again. There was no aspect of this book that I liked. There is only one word for this book: Horrible. It's a badly written combo of blandness, ignorance, bias, propaganda, melodrama, and just plain stupidity. This book provides no new understanding about Afghan culture. I could just turn on my T.V. to Fox news and hear the same stuff that I read in  \\"A Thousand Cr*ppy Suns\\"    And I'm sorry for my writing. Give me a break, I'm seventeen.
B008Q00KEW|3.0|I rate this movie 4 stars. As for the video and sound quality I would give it 3 star.<br />I would have liked the sound to be in at least 5.1  2 stars for the sound quality.<br />Video quality is a 4
B002ZG97LK|5.0|I thought it was a good movie, but it wasn't nearly as fast paced on the dance floor as was it's first time around.  But all in all it was a fairly decent movie.
B00AA0U05A|5.0|Emmy Rossum has delivered a delightful album of famous tunes from yesteryear.  She handles several song-styles with ease on this album.  Her \\"Sentimental Journey\\" is classy and sultry; and \\"The Object of My Affection\\" is smart and sassy.  Another standout is \\"These Foolish Things (Remind Me of You)' which has that old-time feel of a piano player in a lounge years ago. She takes a serious turn with \\"Autumn Leaves\\" and enjoys the 50s' with \\"Too Many Tears\\" and \\"Things.\\"<br /><br />According to the notes, Emmy gives her Mom a shout out for teaching her \\"I'll Be With You In Apple Blossom Time\\" which is so closely associated with the Andrews Sisters.  Emmy does all the background vocals as well and it is especially effective on the \\"I'll Be With You in Apple Blossom Time\\" track.<br /><br />This is a fun album and a fine addition to anyone's CD collection.  It's nice to hear these old tunes again, given a new and creative treatment.  Enjoy!

B008AK8FHM|5.0|One of the most influential books I have ever read.  As a fellow medical professional, it is stunning to hear about Dr. Alexander's after death experience, from a scientific, nonChristian point of view.  Highly recommended read for anyone who has wondered &#34;is this all there is to life?&#34;.

B008XCM18Q|5.0|This is an exciting and fast paced action novel typical of Robert Ludlum's suspense novels. For those who have watched Matt Damon create Jason Bourne this is a must-read...I don't read many action novels but the Bourne movies led me to seek out the novel that inspired the character.

B0082Z1CVQ|5.0|A truly heart warming story. Even if you want to give up pretty please with cherries, sprinkles and every thing sweet. I suggest you keep this story in your heart forever. Read it over and over again. It is on the list of my favorite books. Every one in the world would love it, but if you don`t like it your crazy and need to love it with all your heart and respect.
6304711905|5.0|I think this is one of my all time favorites!  All the stars are amazing and the storyline is entertaining and engrossing.
B0044C3RB4|5.0|This is the most stimulating series I have seen out.  Catching up on it through Amazon's Prime has been a real gem.  The characters, plot, action, filming, everything is worth seeing.  I would even consider purchasing this entire series.

B003JTHXOK|3.0|Loved this book…couldn't wait to finish it.  Kind of \\"lifetime movie\\" with a twist.  Definitely worth the effort and time
1433502410|5.0|I never had a study Bible before. This study Bible answers so many questions that I have<br />about geography, history, politics, and people's attitudes of each book of the Bible. It has<br />pictures of cities and maps of the middle east to help understand the situation at that particular period of history. It gives insight and interpretations, but does'nt become docrinal.<br />I don't know why I waited so long to buy it.
0765325950|5.0|Harriet chose wisely indeed in enlisting Brandon Sanderson to complete Mr. Jordan's epic.  The choice to split up the climax into 3 individual novels has proven to be a wise choice.  After taking on the formidable task of not only finishing one of the great fantasy sagas of the last 20 years, but of adapting his own writing style to keep the same &#34;flavor&#34; if you will of the great Robert Jordan, Mr. Sanderson has succeeded beyond anyone's expectation.  Even at near 50 years of age, this story moved me as few others ever have.  I read the final 100 or so pages through a veil of my own tears.<br /><br />Thank you, Mr. Sanderson.  May Peace forever favor your pen.

B000WCDBKM|5.0|I enjoy this type of film keeps you gussing, with hints of humor.<br />Its also presented in a different and exciting way as only polanski can
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I loved reading all three books and I have already recommended them to several of my friends, but don't forget to read the others first.
B0052AC8C6|1.0|DEFINITELY should be rated R!  This is not a movie for children and should not be bought if that is your intention.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I love thus. I was on the rollercoaster with Charlie's. I am actually teary eyed. This book is amazing because a lot of people cam relate to this. This book is real & raw. Amazing again. Kudos!!!
B00499NHLC|5.0|Easily the best Sherlock show ever!  I am anxiously waiting for season 3 it should be out in a few months I think.
140053271X|1.0|DO NOT buy this product!!! I have purchased a nook simple touch and it is awful!!! The reason is there is not a brightness setting. On a scale of brightness 1 meaning pitch black and 10 meaning very bright it would be a 3 meaning dull. This means people that has bad eye sight or has seeing trouble will have a hard time seeing the screen. With light the screen is dull and without light the screen is pitch black! They make attachable lights for them but what is the point!!! You should just buy the newer ones. Now I am stuck with this nook that is useless.
B007PM218K|5.0|The superb video and audio quality of this bluray came up to my expectations and is appropiate to this John Ford classic. My highest recommendations.

B00APUYN0I|5.0|Loved it.  Loved the singing and humor.  Will definitely watch again.  There is so much about this movie that I loved.
B008GXHOFW|1.0|The quality of this game has really bad graphic quality and it lags a lot when I played. This app is not worth $7, it might be worth $1 on a good day.
B0099114WO|4.0|What a movie.  Meryl streep, a women still young and sexy cannot understand why her husband cannot make love to her, therefore he has his own bedroom. have no made love for a very very long time until they go to therapyh and meet Steve Carrell who helps them in the process and wow, what happens then is wonderful. great movie.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|Wow I'm 11 and I love this game its cute and funny. It looks just like the the show! Buy this game even if your my age I know you'll love it as much as I do! You'll be addicted!
0061474355|5.0|I originally had this trilogy when I was a kid (preteen, maybe?).  This was the only book missing out of the collection, so I bought it just to have the complete set again.  I always enjoyed the originality of the content, and I thought it was well-written.  Just reread it and still enjoy it!
B003O86FMW|4.0|Good continuation of story line.  Good continuation of characters.  Description of surrounding environment is excellent.  I look forward to the next book.
B0098VYCCE|2.0|Visually exciting...and that's about it.  Story line is awkward and thin.  It does not lend itself to full, developed characters, which only makes the mostly flat acting even harder to sit through.  Chris Hemsworth (the huntsman) was the only actor that I thought was worth watching, although I had expected to like Charlize Theron as the queen.  Kristen Stewart is not remotely convincing, and certainly doesn't inspire.  All in all a dud.  I regret even paying the few dollars to rent it.
B003TSEEDY|3.0|I was excited to read this book... it was interesting.. I enjoyed it but I want to watch the movie for a better understanding.
0545128285|5.0|Fantastic addition to any Harry Potter fan's collection.  I especially enjoyed that she includes Dumbledore's impressions and some back history of the wizarding world and the story.  Well written (as always).  My only complaint is that it is too short.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|:D This game is super fun! Its very entertaining, and Im sure all the bronies are loving it! Can't wait to play it again!
B0063GORYU|5.0|Very addicting! I find myself playing this game whenever I have a few minutes to hours. Everyone I've turned on to it says the same. Try it you'll like it.
1455523550|1.0|The book is very good but when I got it. It was missing the first three chapters!! Other than that I enjoy it.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|If you liked fifty shades you will LOVE this series!!!  Great plot great love story awesome characters. Can't wait for the next one to come out!!!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Great game. awesome for horse lovers. I am 9 and can't stop playing. My mom plays sometimes too. Hope you like it too.
B00846F1YW|4.0|Game is ok I have played better ones would not have bought if it was not free app of the day.
B0089EHWQE|4.0|This was a good book!  I thought the characters were great and the story was heartbreaking. I kept wondering what I would do if I was the mom or the dad or the caregiver or any of the other characters. Every now and then the story would be told by someone other than Louisa, which was a bit weird, but those chapters were all titled by that person, so it helped. If you missed the heading because you weren't paying attention, just reading, then it was somewhat confusing, but easy enough to fix.  Great book, recommend it to everyone!
B008FYZIVY|5.0|Downton Abbey ~ GRIPPING!!!  this show is fabulously written & performed. Each episode is unexpected...so refreshing to feel captivated by the characters & feel their joys & sorrows. Triumphs & challenges!  Love it...I am hooked!
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Not one of his best novels.<br />It was quick READING.<br /><br />He did say that he did not do a lot of research for the book.<br />It had a lot of twists and turns
B0056CUZRA|5.0|Fantastic Story. You wont be able to put it down. Ken Follett is a master. I will be looking for more and more.
B003P2WO5E|4.0|Like many have commented, there were editing errors, in the kindle version the art work cannot be appreciated and switching back and forth between veiw points was a bit frustrating.  Regardless, I still managed to enjoy it.  I was interested in Sanderson's introduction and treatment of religion and philosophy.  It seems to be a big theme in all of his series so far, so I imagine it must be an important theme in his own life.  I think he can get away with such a strong emphasis on these themes as he has a way of making the character's musings on these subjects seem very genuine.  I found myself resonating with the character's questions about themselves and their part in the universe.
B00AHHODH2|4.0|Though the foreshadowing needed more subtlety, I truly enjoyed this book and I would definitely read the sequel. Good job.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|i downloaded temple run 2 because i loved the first one and this turned out to be even better! But there's just one problem, it only works once! When i try to go back to the game after going to my homescreen it wont come up.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|The game just makes you want to play it every time you turn on your system thanks for the game,i really think it's awesome.My advice to you is download and enjoy the game.
B0091REZMW|1.0|to remember and not enough to go on.  No subject matter!  I would give the app a lot better rating if you would give the player more items to find.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|fun game. challenging and entertaining.  worked fine on my kindle fire. does take up lots of app space.  worth the 2.99 price. big fish rarely dissapoints
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|this story really touched my soul. i found myself feeling like i lived in this world. the characters are totally relatable, and this is something that goes on peoples lives everyday. i cant wait to see where holder & hope go next
B0017SWPXY|4.0|A story told from the point of view of a dog. I thought this was a cute and quick read. I'd recommend it to fellow dog lovers.
B0084IG8TM|5.0|I am a ABSOLUTELY HUGE----HUGE fan of the Hunger Games Trilogy :) I have read all three books countless times, and I am absolutely enthralled by the way the author, Suzanne Collins, is able to capture my undivided attention and paint the vivid and wildly imaginative images into my head. The story she tells from the point of view of the 16 year old, heroine Katniss Everdeen, is so captivating, I read the first book, immediately went to buy the 2nd and 3rd books in the trilogy, and did not stop reading until I had finished the entire trilogy...It was unlike any other novel or series/trilogy/etc. I have ever read. I am not even in the &#34;YA&#34; (young adult) audience that the trilogy of books (and the Movie) is largely geared towards to (I am closer to 30 years old), and yet, I still am completely captivated by The Hunger Games Trilogy...<br /><br />When I first saw the movie, I was very pleasantly surprised at how much the movie reflected Collins' first installation in the trilogy-The Hunger Games...I admit, I hadn't even heard of the Hunger Games Trilogy until trailers started for the movie... However,  I was given the wonderful advice of reading the books first, before going to see the movie, ( which I am VERY glad I did) and I was in love with the Trilogy before I even saw the movie. I thought the casting was fantastic, Jennifer Lawrence plays a great Katniss Everdeen, Woody Harrelson plays a perfect portrayal of the character Haymitch Abernathy, both surly and comical, Josh Hutcherson as the pivotal character of Peeta Mellark, Liam Hemsworth plays the character of Gale Hawthorne, another major character, Elizabeth Banks as the frivolous and snooty Effie Trinket, (whose costumes in the movie are AMAZING) Donald Sutherland portrays the character of President Snow brilliantly, the small and lovable character of Rue portrayed brilliantly by Amandla Stenberg, along with many many others who contributed to the spectacular casting of the The Hunger Games movie.<br /><br />Having read the books first, Collins had already painted into my mind of what the settings--surroundings & arenas-- the characters find themselves in, and amazingly, the movie's version of what these settings look like, are almost exactly as I pictured them as I was reading the books--(remember, I read the books first.) Other characters look very much what I pictured them to look like in the book, and while the movie couldn't capture every single detail of the book, (it would be impossible for the makers of the 2 1/ 2 hour movie), I still loved every minute of it.<br /><br />***In my opinion, in order to appreciate the movie and understand the plot and characters better, READ THE BOOKS. You can also get the books in audiobook form, which are just as good, and maybe easier than actually finding the time to sit down somewhere quiet to read. The books add SO much more depth in the details and the personalities of the characters that when reading the books, you become very emotionally attached to the characters; cheering them on in parts, shedding a few tears in the saddest of moments, feeling happy or angry for them, depending on which part of the book you are reading...the books also are spectacular at setting the scenes up for the most climactic moments, pretty much with every chapter ending in a cliffhanger for the reader. Obviously the Hunger Games movie--and its sequels,(book 2: Catching Fire, & book 3: Mockingjay) are totally based off of a sensational book series. Being that as it may, you would have thought more people that saw the movie would have read the books prior to the movie, or at least gone home and read the books after seeing The Hunger Games. I have read several negative reviews on The Hunger Games where some people criticized it harshly, saying that it seemed like the character development in movie was done poorly, and that the plot was &#34;lame & boring&#34; or referring to the Games as &#34;sick and demented&#34;...all of those reviewers didinclude in their opinions of the movie that they had not read any of the books.... In response to those reviewers' criticism, READ THE BOOKS. There isn't enough time in the movie to play out the long character development as Collins is able to take her time with in the books. That's why the movie (and its sequels) are being made in first place, because the book trilogy was such a grand slam with audiences of all ages. For people that have seen the movie, but haven't read the books, I HIGHLY encourage you to do so, because it will immensely help with your understanding of the movie, and give you a new appreciation for it. ***Reading the books will also get you ready for the long anticipated sequel to The Hunger Games, the second installation in the trilogy-- Catching Fire the Movie, set to hit the theaters in Nov. 2013. I am personally very excited for it to come out, and will undoubtedly pre-order it on BluRay, as soon as it comes out.<br />Sorry for this very long &#34;product rating&#34;, but I absolutely LOVE the Hunger Games trilogy and the movie, and just had to share some of my thoughts on it. :)
B0063GORYU|5.0|Great game to keep your mind challenged. Hard to win but I love it! It is one of my few favorite games. I play it on my kindle fire.
B004VYYA2K|5.0|Arrived in excellent condition and very quickly.  My grand-daughter loves it and plays with it all the time.  She is even uses it when she goes to others houses to play.  Thanks.
B0029LCJJS|1.0|We were so happy to find a historical series about England.  We were enjoying the costumes, acting, and dialogue, then all of a sudden we were quite shocked to find out it was laced with pornography.  It's totally unnecessary to the storyline, so it must be something the producer/director gets off on.  Ruined it for us and we wouldn't recommend it to anyone.
B00006LFGD|5.0|I love everything Barbra - and have for many years.  So glad this CD came into existence.  Bring on more!
B006M4RN3U|3.0|This is heavily front-loaded with singles including the monster \\"We Are Young\\" but trails off in quality badly after that. I suppose it's too much to ask that young bands make cohesive albums anymore--inevitable prey to downloading, I guess--but this is a ripoff for three or four good songs. The obvious clunker is track 5, which hits with a gust of garbled synth and Auto-Tune as if asking, \\"okay, we played the hits, who's still here ?\\" What a shame. Nate Reuss does have a sure gig with a reunited Queen, though. Now that would be fun.
B004ZZS4CC|4.0|I have to say that the first third of this book is pretty disturbing. I cannot imagine how awful it would be to live through the things she experienced -- especially as an 11 year old. I think that if I hadn't been reading it for book group, I might have stopped. The last 2/3 of the book was inspiring. It amazes me what the human spirit can endure and recover from.
B00846REIS|4.0|Mostly a good read, I had moments where i was very frustrated with the character, Eva.  She had too many issues.

B005LAIHXQ|4.0|For all the slash and gore freaks out there who wanted just another horror flick: I don't feel your pain but I do understand it. This is a movie with a real plot based on philosophical questions that appeal to the minds of all thinking people: where did we come from and who created us? The slash & gore freaks don't get it. This movie borrows from Alien to illustrate a concept, which is the notion that the origin of the human race is a horror story. This is based on ideas that go back to the ancient Gnostics and Sumerians. They had myths that explained human origins along similar lines. The gist of the story is that humans weren't created by a noble supreme Being for noble purposes; instead humans were created by malevolent, demonic beings.<br /><br />But aside from the fascinating theme behind the film, this movie has good acting, good characters, it's not slow and doesn't waste your time. Is it Star Wars or Avatar? No. But it is still a good and entertaining film filled with eye-popping photography, inspiring images and good acting. Could it be better? A little. But the main problem with this movie is that IT LACKS A SEQUEL. This movie needs a sequel and we need it NOW!!!<br /><br />Also, I'm tired of Ridley Scott getting paddled over this film by critics who have no experience making movies themselves. Again, it's not a bad movie at all. And I wish they would keep Ridley Scott and give him a chance to finish this project and to improve upon the foundation laid in part I. I hope part II doesn't turn out to be another dumb slash & gore movie. There's a great plot here and Ridley Scott should be allowed to finish the job.<br /><br />I have this movie in my library along side Star Wars, Avatar and the Chronicles of Riddick; and I think that's exactly where it belongs.
B00AMBLXP8|2.0|A friend suggested to see this movie- maybe I woul dhave enjoyed it more if I had drank at least a 6 pack of beer and a few shots of vodka.
B006QS0PF0|5.0|This book made me appreciate Portia de Rossi so much more than I ever have. She really breaks the silence on the terror and turmoil that accompany eating disorders. She gives a raw, biting view of her struggles and divulges personal details without the usual Hollywood glamour. The closing chapters also yield some light and hope for those who suffer. Highly recommend.
B009CPJHY4|4.0|I enjoyed the story line for each character.  What a fun experience for most-  the ones who don't enjoy experiencing a new and different way of life just stay out of the way.  No need to be judgemental of those who do LIVE.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I'm not really into romance, but this one had me from the begining. Even though it was all about younger people, I'm in my fourties and I could still relate to the characters.
B00881VLCE|4.0|I really like this puzzle game. It has a great selection, and you can add more puzzles in several topics. I also like the choices in amount of puzzle pieces to make more...or less challenging.
B00AF6B22E|5.0|I love Denzel Washingrton in all his movies!!!!  This was a great movie and he did a wonderful job!!!  He made me not like him at all until the very end of it.
B0098VYKSA|4.0|Good action.  Ok storyline.  Entertaining. Can see similarities to other movies of the genre; Lord of the Rings trilogy; Joan of Arc.
B0013LPS8E|5.0|Raw, energy filled, CLASSIC--MUST HAVE for anyone wanting to remember when U2 still had some of that punk in them.  Absolutely have to have!!!
B008HK3XKO|3.0|Received one with my new 7&#34; Kindle Fire HD.  The clips were too big to hold the Kindle.  I have requested a replacement.  Amazon has paid for return shipping and is sending the replacement 1-day, so I'm not totally disgruntled yet, but I will be if the 2nd one doesn't fit too!
B007GCY8FS|4.0|In spite of the other poor reviews, it's still a Reacher story by Lee Child and it's good!  More OCD than other books but he doesn't get the girl in this one.  You know you're gonna read it anyway so go for it.  You won't be sorry.
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|It might be my Irish pride but I actually enjoy this more than the original Mario game! Fun stuff :)
B002MQYOFW|5.0|i think it was a really good book, when ever i set down to read i get really exited because the whole book is so engaging<br />hunger games +movie=:):):):):):):)
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Sheer terror and nail biting suspense.  The empathy felt for these characters draws the viewer into an emotional roller coaster of thrills and chills. I would recommend this show for anyone who loves horror and scifi.  Not recommended for children under twelve.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love playing this I learn more and more about how to care 4 my very own horse! I recommmend it to young kids to learn about horses its amazing
0375842209|1.0|I've ordered used books on many occasions from amazon before. This book was really used! It took so long for it to arrive. I kept checking on the status of it - kept saying &#34;shipped&#34;. By the time I got the book, I had to hurry to read it in time for my Book Club. I don't think I would recommend this vendor to others.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|The best book of this type I have read in the past year,  Loved the story and the ending as well.
1400069289|4.0|I must admit, I skim over the talk of rats in mazes, but my Mom had Alzheimer's and observed everything he says of ingrained habits play out even when she forgot everything...<br /><br />the biggest challenge it's giving me is to work to replace my own habits with new ones... it's a good &#34;workbook&#34;
B0090UMM8Y|3.0|This book was okay, but too much ugliness and sex for my personal taste.  It is not, in my judgment, typical of Ken Follett's past writings.
1451695195|4.0|I was just talking with someone at work about this.  What's so intriguing is this is reported by a man of science describing &#34;the other side&#34;...along with the input of those who watched him on &#34;this side.&#34;  Fascinating, and different from the few &#34;religious&#34; books on heaven I've read
B000P12LWY|5.0|I've long had a fascination with the Tudors and this series doesn't disappoint! Lots of drama, lots of intrigue and great costume design. I don't believe the fashions are 100% authentic (Some of the hoods are not what was worn in this time period or in some cases the woman aren't wearing a hood at all. The story line are excellently done and I love Jeremy Northam in his role. He does it excellently!
B009SJ3H8Q|5.0|I love &#34;American Horror Story.&#34;  it creates stories horrific to the imagination, in riveting plots, with charismatic actors and excellent sets.  it does it without buckets of blood.  I brought over a friend to my house to watch and she thought is was too horrific as did another one of my friends.  Just the right darkness for me.  It's for intelligent people.
B00AMBLXP8|5.0|Movie: &#34;Ted&#34;<br />I loved this movie so much that I watched it multiple times before the rent time was over!
1451627297|5.0|I had never read any King before and was very leary, but it was a very entertaining, interesting thought-provoking work.  I thought it was a romance that science fiction or horror.
B001NLKZUA|5.0|I bought this book this morning and JUST finished it... I couldn't put it down I was addicted to it!!!!! I LOVE THIS SERIES!!!!!
B001ANSSDC|5.0|Great book I read it over 2 days and couldn't put it down. I would highly recommend it. I have not seen the movie
B009KG7EMC|5.0|It was in good cognition and was a great moive the best parts are the beginning end. The knife fights are amazing.
075669812X|5.0|My boys love to read through this book and learn more about Ninjagos. They find out great facts about each character.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is the best it really inspired me to start skateboarding cause now I sort of know how to do it.
0156013983|5.0|This is a delightful story told in French, which many French students have read.  Though it is also published in English, it is a good reader for students who have studied French for two or more years.
0393327345|5.0|Once you figure out what Palahniuk was trying to say, you'll change your way of thinking forever. This is one of the best novels of all time, and the movie is one of the best of all time.
B000I5X81K|4.0|This is a very good CD by Mr. Groban, whose voice I have admired for many years.  He does a fantastic job, and the songs are good, though I personally prefer a couple of his other CD's.  I look forward to hearing his newest CD, &#34;All That Echoes.&#34;
0470449764|5.0|This is a must have book to study for the GMAT. Don't leave home without it. lol 5 star rating
B003XT8Y3K|5.0|This is a good selection of arias for Mr. Kaufmann, as it demonstrates his excellent range.  The arias are well known and well liked.  Mr. Kaufmann sings Parsifal from the New York Met in high definition in March.
1118109791|5.0|This is a must have book to study for the GMAT. Don't leave home without it. lol 5 star rating
B009YG2ND8|5.0|I loved this game back then and even more now. My wife played this nonstop until she beat it and I'm still on my way there. Didn't encounter any bugs and the 3D updated graphics was definitely nice. If you're a FF fan then the big purchase is worth it but if not then I couldn't justify spending this much money on a game.
6305127646|5.0|It arrived on time and was brand new. I recommend this vendor. I believe if this movie came out later it would have done much better.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|Great concept and keeps me interested everytime. Don't NEED to make any purchases, game stays fun without but even more if you get some upgrades! Replay value is very high due to different kinds of bugs you play as and each one is different in it's own way.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|its really fun and very entertaining great app i just wish it was a little different from temple run u know!
B0094BB4TW|1.0|Extremely buggy, freezes a lot, has problems when chatting and changing screen from portrait/landscape, etc. I'd stick with using the slow Silk browser that comes with the Kindle rather than using this application. Needs MUCH work.
B00AHSINKO|2.0|Acting is good, but the movie is very slow and painful to watch. It's quite depressing. It's just like experiencing the problems and emotional pain of real life relationships that one often experiences when they are unhappy and stressful. With the state of the economy and overall stress of our troubling times, I would rather escape the sadness of the real world and be uplifted, entertained and inspired when I watch movies. I did not feel any of these by watching this movie, even with a \\"happy\\" ending that actually did not make sense to me given just how unhappy this couple was. It was difficult to believe that they could overcome their serious issues. For the most part is was well acted, but in the end, I didn't \\"buy it.\\"
B00AQCMK32|4.0|Pretty fun game but after the first run around I wasn't sure what to do there. Not really much of a reply value. First time around and the 3 times I restarted after that were fun but after you have plenty of cash there's not much left to do.
B009FXIICK|4.0|Enjoy playing. Neverending or so it seems kind of like bejewelled. Its fun I think you will enjoy whether you are 6 or 63.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|What is there to say? It never disappoints. It was quite challenging from what I remember Angry Birds being when it first came out.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Love this game.it is awesome and if you get really good at it you can destroy.<br />You should buy this game!
B0097C8XL0|2.0|Super penguins is.... OK. But I think it is just pretty boring. Temple Run 2<br />is awesome. Maybe if they had a better Super penguins I would like it.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I liked the portrayal of love after death, and how true love thinks always of others before self. The subtlities left the reader to draw one's own conclusions.
6304345313|5.0|Great movie if you love basketball and looney tunes! awesome mix of both. great gift for either kids or adults
B008XG1X18|4.0|love this ap kill many a lazy day looking at everything and anything. highly reccomend to everyone.<br /> very very addictive. watch out!
1451695195|1.0|We all want to be immortal conscious beings. Well, almost all of us, I reckon.  It is a strong desire,particularly given that we lose so many loved ones in the course of our lives. Who would NOT ache for reunion, for the notion that no, they did not die. No one dies. All that we hold beloved in ourselves and others and on this beautirul earth we are systematically destroying, MUST last forever. We believe this in the face of all evidence to the contrary -- or at least, in the absence of all evidence that we are correct.<br /><br />Because there has never, ever, ever been concrete proof that there is life beyond death. No scientific -- that is, empirically tested, reliable and valid - evidence exists at all.  There is religious belief, of course. There are apostolic \\"witnesses\\" and first person anecdotal accounts of unconsioux adventures in the beyond, and certainly those who have such experiences make all sorts of claims based upon them -- claims that go well beyond descriptions of their subjective experiences and become generalized metaphysical claims. This does not constitute proof, however, not by a longshot.<br /><br />I am sure the author  had hallucinations (i.e., experiences that feel very real of extraordinary presentiments) that strongly affected his life by giving credence to his deepest hopes and waylaying his deepest fears. This experience, however, is no more \\"real\\" or provable by the rigors of scientific inquiry than anyone else's. The fact that he is a neurosurgeon may cause readers to believe that he is better equipped to ascertain the credibility of his conclusions than is, say, Khloe Kardashian.<br /><br />People who dearly want -- or more accutately, need -- to buy the author's tale as true will gobble this up and make Dr. Alexander a popular and wealthy witness to a spectacular otherworldly realm -- even though, by its  very definition, whatever happened to him did not and could not occur anywgere but in the worldly realm he occupied at the time.He was not dead. If he was dead, he would still be dead. How \\"near\\" death he was,even if it could be ascertained with  absolute certainty, which it cannot,means nothing.  His were not afterdeath experiences. They were \\"pre-death\\" experiences and that is precisely what we should call them.<br /><br />Such events are very powerful, of course, and not yet fully explained,but NEUROSCIENTISTS, whose study the molecular, cellular, developmental, structural, functional, evolutionary, computational, and medical aspects of the nervous system, as well as individual nerve sells and image sensory and motor tasks in the brain. They clearly assert and have asserted for years, however, that however fascinating and life-changing these experiences may be, they are provoked by neural phenomenon, not supernatural phenomenon, which by definition cannot be proven scientifically to exist, even by a neurosurgeon, who is just a medical doctor, after all.<br /><br />Alexander can be an astonished believer and he can be a physician, but he  cannot use the fact that he is a physician to prove anything beyond the physical.<br /><br />Oprah Winfrey finds him fascinating, although she has not entertained any of his critics, which would require some intellectual exercise, and he has made the rounds of radio and television talk shows, none of which mean anything, but that more doc is making one more allegation outside his realm of expertise, something rarely noted by his interviewers for reasons known but to the Gods of Journalism,were they to exist.<br /><br />It abslutely must be noted, however, that Alexander's book and its claims have been greatly criticized by scientists, including neuroscientist Sam Harris who found his account \\"alarmingly unscientific\\" and who has written that \\"Everything -- absolutely everything -- in Alexander's account rests on repeated assertions that his visions of heaven occurred while his cerebral cortex was \\"shut down,\\" \\"inactivated,\\" \\"completely shut down,\\" \\"totally offline,\\" and \\"stunned to complete inactivity.\\" He says, \\"The evidence he provides for this claim is not only inadequate -- it suggests that he doesn't know anything about the relevant brain science.\\"<br /><br />The distinguished philosopher.author and skeptical debunker of claims of the supernatural Paul Kurtz would be applauding Harris loudly, but of  course, he is no longer among us, although Alexander might beg to differ.<br /><br />When a physician offers his unexplained neural phenomenon as something more than that, he is speaking, not as a scientist, but as an amazed civilian no more credible when it comes to the existence of life after death than the authors of \\"Dragonfly.\\" When he offers his medical degree to suggest that his coma-induced beliefs are any more credible than yours or mine, he should be ashamed of himself.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|My Horse is very addicting. I cant stop playing. 3D is awsome!!!  Looks like a real horse, not a silly cartoon.
B00130EVSS|3.0|After reading quite a few good reviews of this film, I was slightly disappointed.  I liked it, thought it was good, but not as good as I hoped.
B007REV4T8|5.0|Another bust out, fast action 007.  Daniel Craig never dissapoints and in his role as 007, he brings the character to life and makes it his own.
B004NS710C|5.0|After a lot of research, I made a list of 10 drama/action type films I wanted to see.  MOst of these titles were on the top of many top 10 lists.  That said, UNSTOPPABLE, which I wasnt even familiar with, and because of that was hesitant to even add to my list, was my favorite.  I couldn't believe how good it was.  It amazes me how often a great film will fly under the radar.
B003UBTX6S|5.0|Just as good as the first, cant wait to read the next one!! I love how all the characters are intertwined!
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|Good grafics and story all in all.  The end was rather a let down but I would give it a solid 4 stars anyway.
B005IQ39AY|5.0|Awesome game! So very addictive! My whole family plays on my kindle. We're always waiting for a turn. No negatives!
B009CPJHY4|5.0|I found it funny, sometimes sad, but certainly original. I have not seen the movie, so don't know how to rate them respectively.
B00AQF8CJ0|4.0|Kids love it and so do I! It makes you think and work to solve the puzzles. I reccomend it for any age!
B00B2V66VS|2.0|to make my power ups last longer it says it costs only one gem but it takes two. I maxed out my speed and a couple days later looked again.. and it says I didn't do anything. I used so many gems to do so and turns out it was a big waste. also the save me option crashes game. please fix!
B008MEM24S|5.0|Love it! So addictive! We love the show and the game. A great addition to Wheres My Water! Great choice for kids or grown ups.
0765325950|3.0|I will have a section clearly marked with spoilers.<br /><br />We all know how much easier it is to back-seat drive rather than be the one actually trying to find an unknown address in a crowded city...all we have to do is see what someone ELSE is doing wrong and not ourselves. Yet as I read through Brandon Sanderson's part of the ending trilogy I couldn't help but be saddened by Brandon's unnecessary blunders that could have been avoided. Brandon writes of two-dimensional, black and white, tell, not show perspective. It is almost like he hasn't read the books ever...or in years! (Oh wait that's true, he re-read the first couple while writing Towers of Mid)<br /><br />Robert Jordan was a far superior writer who always shows, by a frown or stiffening jaw that a character doesn't approve, he writes in three-dimensions. You think you know the characters well, and even though you think you know what the characters will do in a given situation...you're not entirely sure. The plot and characters are complex. Unless you're reading Brandon's take that is. (Please don't get me wrong I love Brandon but him finishing Wheel of Time was a blunder to the fans and to the essence of the story) Please let me explain.<br /><br />Robert Jordan wasn't perfect, but he imagined an EPIC, not to be repeated since Tolkien, story! He often allowed his tangents to get a bit ahead of himself toward the end, yet he said before he died that he would finish Wheel of Time in one more volume or die trying. He also said years ago that he wanted WoT to NOT be like an old dead book you put on the shelf and forgot, he would leave certain plot points, (not major ones) unresolved so that the story would continue to feel alive and you'd be curious what happened to such and such character a few years later? Brandon Sanderson, failed at this completely.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, I've read all Brandon's books too, but writing in depth characters is not his strength. Plotting is, which is something he didn't have to do much of in this trilogy. Brandon writes of plot points that resolve in unrealistic ways, people see eye-to-eye in ways that even Ta-va-ren can't explain away! People become friends and automatically drop grudges spontaneously! They become card-board, and stale and randomly get married. Brandon's \\"bad\\" characters at the Black Tower have names like Bubba? (slightly exagerated) Wow really? Brandon tells you somethings about(Nyneave for example)that you already know. Show! Not TELL! It was literally like he was connecting the dots, trying to resolve all plots (NOT a requirement!) and get the Dark One taken care of. Not believably nor with feeling, or character. Brandon can spin a good plot, that is a strength he has. Not something he had to do much of in these books!<br /><br />*** Spoiler ***<br /><br />The battle scenes are somewhat repetitive but well plotted and really enjoyable. Even if every detail of the final ending with Rand were spelled out by Jordan detail by detail, I'm afraid Brandon blundered the ending and made it seem, cold, cut off, sad even. This was no epic bitter-sweet or shinning take on the Dragon Reborn. Yea! He's a no-body. Hopefully one of the 3 will give him the time of day...Someday after they get out of the responsibilities? Sad. I'm sorry to say I have to re-visualize the ending in my head in order to continue to love the Wheel as I do.<br /><br />End of Spoilers ***<br /><br />Bottom line, I love the Wheel and I consider it one of the best stories ever told. Great battle scenes of the Last battle. Obviously Jordan couldn't come from the grave to finish his story but Brandon should have been closer to the material he was writing rather than trying to meet deadlines. Unnecessary blunders, I give this book 2.5 stars. Life is about the journey, not the money you make on the side or deadlines. The story, and fans deserved better.
B008WCP2PG|5.0|I bought two copies of this DVD for my sisters.  We watched it on a bridal party weekend.  Where us bridesmaids and the bride went to a bridal show and we all really enjoyed it:)  It is very cheesy at times and the plot gets a little silly here and there, but It's all enjoyable.  We really enjoyed the cheesy as well as the hotter parts of the movie.  It's more for an easy-going audience rather than someone who wants a really great story or other grand cinematic attributes.  This movie is merely for entertainment value.
B001H9JBW6|3.0|With Benedict Cumberbatch from Sherlock in the major role had high hopes. This had so much potential with a great plot and story line. Only wish the writing was much better for the roles of the characters.
0440237688|5.0|I've loved this book since middle school and have been desperate for a good read lately.  I've read this book several times and have called this my favorite book for the better part of two decades, but have never owned it.  It was just time.  My only complaint is that it's too short!  I wish this book would just go on and on.  I realize it's for a younger audience and probably appreciated it length when I was a less experienced reader.  I'm glad to own it now so I can read it to my heart's content.
B00B2V66VS|1.0|it keeps freezing when I jump duck and turn! you need to upgrade. it now please. other than that it is pretty. good
B008AK8FHM|1.0|The dead giveaway that this book is not what it seems is that the author will not allow this Kindle book to be loaned.  If he was truly concerned about spreading the Word about a miraculous proof that Heaven exists, he would want it to be shouted from the rooftops... and most certainly would not opt out of kindle's book lending!  Think about it.  I was shocked when I went to loan this Kindle book which I had purchased from Amazon.com to my sister... and found that Kindle Lending was disabled for \\"Proof of Heaven.\\"  To me that's proof of someone who is not at all interested in actually spreading the Good News and is only interested in $$$.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I bought this book thinking it was going to be your typical high school..drama filled romance. What an altered change of pace. Such depth....such emotion....such love. I had a hard time putting the book down.....it had my attention and gripped my heart. Such a sad story but told with such conviction!!!<br />I will recommend this to co workers and friends.....and probably read it again someday!
B0085Y4JF0|5.0|fitment all the way to very husky...a best buy! top shelf quality seen throughout this product. would buy more if my posse was bigger.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is the best app in the entire world. For those of you who have great ideas, but cant express them, you have found your holy land. Dont let the price fool you. It may be high but in the end you will never have remembered your reason to not buy this app. For all you haters, try it, instead of hating everything you aren't familiar with.
B000SEGUDE|5.0|Brilliant. Impossible to believe a mere human could pull this off, so I am inclined to believe Mitchell is divine.
B009FZFONO|5.0|I had missed watching the first half of season 3.  I can't wait to see how the rest season 3 ends!
B009VB97EY|3.0|Story line was too slow to really follow, not really worth it unless you are looking for some yummy eye candy
B004LROMX4|5.0|I'm a huge fan of cool, sci-fi, post-apocalyptic movies and TV shows, (The Walking Dead is my favorite show and I'm a huge fan of all things Terminator). Falling Skies is really cool because it gives us an idea of what might happen if aliens invaded earth.  The story start 6 months after the alien invasion began. Most of humanity has been wiped out.  When the aliens arrived, all technology stopped being functional.  Personally, I like the use of this plot device because if aliens really did invade, they would most likely have technology that we couldn't explain or understand.<br /><br />The story focuses around a group of resistance fighters from Boston called the 2nd Mass.  The main Character is Tom Mason (Played by Noah Wylie).  He is 2nd in command and he has 3 sons, one of which has been captured by the aliens and harnessed.  The aliens place harnesses of the backs of children because it allows them to control their minds. I won't reveal any more about that right now.<br /><br />The first season shows what happens when humanity fights back.  I found Tom to be a very relatable character.  I'm in my late 20's and I have a daughter, so I understood where Tom was coming from when every decision he made was with his children in mind.  Tom is also an ex-history professor, and brings alot of useful military history to the military tactics used in the 2nd Mass.<br /><br />This is a great show.  I highly recommend checking out.
B009329Y30|5.0|I kinda wish the movie would have started similar to the book with his run in with her ex, but still pretty close to the book and a great story! Will watch again!
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|I love this movie . great dialogue , good humor , and plenty of absolute butt kickin . I got this at a better price then you can find in any local store barring an incredible sale, so I got that going for me and that's nice. As a matter of fact , after writing the review , I think I am gonna go watch it again . yay me
B00BB8SKPW|4.0|Great movie, was a little slow at times but overall a much watch. I enjoy watching a good deal of Denzel movies and have enjoyed them all
B00133KFGW|5.0|The story and cast of characters were uniquely meshed.  I wish that there were many more like this!  Give me a guide to others of this quality!
B0024RIMBG|5.0|I simply love Celtic woman, and this concert shows why, they are amazing. It's a shame the concert is not complete, i have watched other songs in this concert that are not in this DVD, like Orinoco flow.
B009IQ0TGM|4.0|I bought this as soon as it came out as I liked her previous album, Ellie Goulding, so much. This one's pretty good, but doesn't quite measure up to the first. Will still be looking forward to new material from her, however.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|I have not played this game until about a month ago. I do like it because it is different than most games I play.
B00B4VI8MQ|1.0|I have tried numerous times, but it won't load. I keep getting an error message that it can't load because the external memory is full. Not sure about the external memory, but I have checked and double-checked the memory on my Fire. Good on all counts, so seems to be a glitch in the game.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|I read and research my bible as I am looking for a certain subject.  It make it easy to research by words - phrases or chapter.
B006LSZECO|3.0|Most of the book moved along pretty well. Definitely knew what was coming, but it still kept my interest, but was completely deflated by the end...
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|I love this game because of the different games and I have planned this game for about 2 years.  It is always a challenge when I am playing the different games.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|The first TR is great but this one seems to need some fine tuning. Maybe it's my connection but it is very challenging to get through some parts of the game. It would be nice if the beast would get burned that chases you to or even fall. This game also speeds up which makes it even more difficult to concentrate on the twist and turns.
B004ADF7RO|4.0|Great movie as always, though there did seem to be some odd motion smoothing going on (played using built-in Panasonic TV Amazon player). Great HD quality though.
B000IDJNIY|5.0|This movie is creepy, deep and dark and wouldn't have it any other way. This is one of the 1980's movies that is in my top ten. Loved Robert DeNiro's performace. It has alot of twist but can also be predictable at times but overall still a great movie. This is truely a classic.
B007THA4FI|2.0|Perhaps the author wanted to prove that she could write fiction for Â«adultsÂ».  The result is a grim, depressing story.  If you want this type of unrelieved bleak hopeless story telling watch the news,  it's free.  I am not looking for Mary Poppins, but this book is nothing but a dull gray window on a world not worth the view.
B00A757EFW|5.0|It is as good after all this time. And is as good today as it was years ago and as much fun
B00AQ3K8IU|2.0|Boring and forgetable.  I was in the mood for something deeper and this just did not fit the bill.  Someone else may like it.
B002OR0RP0|5.0|It was as good as the original and also is good for all ages and worth watching over again. Great
B003JTHXOK|3.0|Typical Sparks novel  If you have read one, you have read them all!  But decent reading material.  Maybe the movie will be better.
B00APUQT7I|5.0|It was as good as the 3 movies before it. Is good for all ages as well. People will like this.
B009GEAPYW|5.0|Parts one and 2 are both incredible. If you love Batman, you must see them! I really hope they do more stories like this. Like Killing Joke, Hush, Arkham Asylum. They would be incredible. WE NEED MORE BATMAN!
B0012HEB32|5.0|I really enjoyed the terminator movie series and really like what the show did to continue the storyline and franchise (much better than the christian bale terminator movie). I actually caught this series in season 2, and through amazon instant video got into rewatching the episodes that i missed.<br /><br />if you like the terminator movies (great story, pretty violent) you will enjoy this show.
1423113381|3.0|I bought this book because I am a fan of the Percy Jackson books, but I didn't find that this one captured the magic as well as the Olympians books did. I don't know if it's because Egyptian mythology doesn't lend well to his type of storytelling or what, but I was unsatisfied.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|I am glad I just know discovered this show.  Now I get to watch as many episode as I like and at my own pace.  Absolutely love this show.
B003MC5N28|3.0|Taking a look into a possible future eutopia is always interesting.  The writing style didn't really catch me, but the concept made me want to read on to see what would happen.  An ok book, but I can imagine the conversations one could have with young adults while reading this book.
B00992CF6W|4.0|I love this game! The only problem I'm having is finding survival mode. I don't know how to switch. Other then that awesome game!
B009MCRHH6|5.0|I first played World of Goo a few years ago on the Wii. I have to say that while the art design was impeccable and the game was enjoyable, the gameplay was beyond frustrating. Trying to control and move with the lurching, shaky Wii remote was an absolute nightmare. However, when I saw that it was available on the Appstore I was thrilled. Sure enough my suspicions were right- this game is undeniably fantastic and addictive when played with the ease of a touch screen. The game plays very well on my Droid Bionic and is a ton of fun! This game has depth, despite the simplicity of what is being asked the challenge of proper strategy and execution keeps the player enthralled. This one is really a can't miss. The fact that it was the FAOD on Christmas made it one of my best Christmas presents!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Buy this series - you won't regret it. Beautifully written with a thought provoking plot - there's hope for us after all!
B003G4W49C|4.0|This is a very fun read.  If you like sci-fi or war novels you'll love this book.  It's like Starship Troopers, but with children.
B004QX07G4|5.0|Really enjoyed reading. I enjoy Ellen's show and reading this was like listening to her on her show. Highly recommended!
B00AMXXN2W|1.0|This is a book written by Charles Darwin is used to teach ideas that the author never intended.  I would never endorse the ideas or context in any way!!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This show just keeps getting better! I have to admit, my wife wanted to watch the show and I half-heartedly went along because there wasn't much else on at the time that interested me.  A great surprise.  If you like historical fiction, this is a must see.
B008Y2FRFO|2.0|This game was great to start.  But, eventually I was stuck with too many coins and not enough Dozer Dollars.  I would have HAD to spend real money after already doing so a lot on my own at the beginning of the game.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I didn't know if they could top season 1 but they did! If you haven't checked this show out, you really should.
B00961ZESW|3.0|It's carly rae jepsen. Fun to dance to, but no real substance or subject matter. It serves its purpose for me.
0765325950|5.0|A Memory of Light is the last of a fourteen-book series called the Wheel of Time. Fantasy doesn't get more epic and more deep than this. I definitely suggest starting at book one called The Eye of the World. The style sometimes comes off a little plodding but is rich in detail and in the depth of even the least important characters. It's too bad Mr. Jordan didn't live to finish the series but Brandon Sanderson did an excellent job of providing a satisfying and heart-wrenching closure to this beloved series.
B002L5GQGY|5.0|If you like rock with a little jazz you'll love this guy he really rocks the house! My favorite guitarist so far.
B005LAII62|5.0|... but NO.  The children were intrigued by the storyline of how things get out of whack when people do too much assuming and not enough thinking on their own.
B009346RSS|5.0|was able to hook these up between a wireless headset and one of my optical outputs on my optical splitter.
B005LAIHSQ|1.0|Ultra disappointing \\"Extended Cut\\" to the equaling disappointing film. A whopping 4 Minutes of footage are added to the blu ray, and what is there isn't much. A few scenes of the Queen ordering her men to kill the remaining soldiers of the army; Snow White being showed a deer carcass by the Huntsman; The Prince telling the Huntsman how much he cares about Snow White; the Queen's brother, Finn asking men who have been to The Dark Forest.<br />  I was hoping that this edition would show the scenes that were featured in the Trailer, scenes such as Snow White encountering the Troll for a second time; the Queen Screaming as the Mirror shatters; the Queen appearing young in the snow-covered forest just as she turns into ravens; Snow White standing alone on a cliff with the castle before her; the Queen walking into her bath from a different angle; the Huntsman's additional fight scenes using two axes in the forest. None of this is added into the Extended Cut--this footage isn't even listed in a Deleted Scenes Bonus. I was hoping there would be improvements from The Theatrical Version, but the changes are so suttle, one barely even notices them. Even in the Florence & The Machine video of \\"Breath of Life\\" we get to see new footage of the Queen swimming around in her milk bath.<br />  The film looks great on blu ray, with excellent picture and rich colors. Too bad the movie wasn't as good! The Trailer made this film look awesome; and there are some things that work, such as Charlize Theron as Queen Ravenna and the costumes. Other than that, the movie is disjointed, boring, and anti-climactic. Ambitious, but not nearly as good as it could have been, had they been given a better director.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I think this game is the best it is easy for children to play instead of playing temple run. Awesome
1932735410|5.0|I've always heard great things about Rita's course. Everyone I met said &#34;be sure to get Rita's book!&#34;. This book came highly recommended....and I PASSED the PMP on first try!<br />Thanks Rita!

B005DKLPRE|5.0|love it sounds great and would recommend to friends. love the smiths<br />cool poster in it 180g worth the buy.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|The story line is exceptional. There were times when it dragged a bit too much and times when the action was non stop and a bit overboard.  There was a point where Katniss was disoriented and the story read like Faulkner stream of consciousness. A different ending than you would expect.  Not shocking but satisfying.
B000HKYN74|5.0|I'm so glad to watch these Star Trek Episodes that I never go to see before !<br />Five Stars !

B002G1YPH0|5.0|Installed this on an fx-4100, and used arctic silver 5, my temps dropped over 25 degrees.Only complaint is that is can be a little difficult to install if it is your first time.The only con which really isn't a con is the cpu  heat-sink slides while installing once secure it works great.Best advice is to install the fan last.
B007L6VR12|5.0|Moonrise Kingdom has become one of my all-time favorite movies.  Quirky, funny, heart-warming and original, I knew I had to own this movie the first time I watched it.  I recommend Moonrise Kingdom to everyone.  Not everyone &#34;gets&#34; it, but those that do, love it with the intensity that I do.

B00AHTYGRW|5.0|Saw this in the theater and have a hard time waiting for it to be available for purchase.  \\"Nightline\\" (tv) began when the hostages were taken, and it was amazing to watch and know that we were seeing history.  Fabulous acting...will not disappoint!
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game stunk before now it is the best game ever! Java should have made the update sooner so more people would buy it.
B0086700CM|5.0|this game rocks it is so fun to run devil monkeys and get new places to run on. :) :)
B008M7JODC|3.0|I really like the Fringe series but when I stream the feed cuts out during certain times of the day.  It gets really annoying...to the point where I have to shut off the show and watch it later.  I don't think its a problem with my Wi-Fi because Netflix never cuts out on me.
B00BB8RKH6|2.0|How far the mighty have fallen!  I always thought of Denzel Washington as a superb actor and any movie that he appeared in as first rate.  I gave this movie two stars because Washington's acting is first rate as always, but this movie stunk so bad its hard to believe that he agreed to be in it. Dont waste your money.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|wow this is such a fun game it is spool addicting!<br />5stars ba-bam<br />P.S it can make you mad though because it is hard at times :)
B009C7JS14|4.0|So far so good. Only have had it for one day. I wish I could view weather in other cities, but I am not interested in the other stuff. Like live weather scenes.
B00B19F3PG|4.0|Based on true events this movies story line moves pretty fast. I've heard of the Dibbuk box from previous &#34;hauntings&#34; programs and enjoyed the graphics and human interaction.
B00B5HQKNI|3.0|This movie was widely compared to other Bond movies.  I did not  find that it was any better.<br />There was way too much hype.  I did not like it or enjoyed it.  I do love Daniel Craig however.<br />He is a major plus.
0802798225|5.0|This book is the first in a trilogy by Simone Elkeles that kept me on the edge of my seat. I don't cry when I read books, but this one brought tears to my eyes at the end. So beautiful and full of suspense. I love the whole trilogy.
159420411X|4.0|I didn't read this myself, but the order came quickly and I gifted the book to my mom. She says it's a great read and her boyfriend is now enjoying the book.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Love this game! It is so zen and relaxing. Also love you the progression keeps you on your toes and keeps your brain thinking.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This app is a lot of fun to play. It is a little slow loading and occasionally has issues required it to be stopped before continuing.  I thoroughly enjoy this app though and am eagerly awaiting updates to fix the occasional loading issues.  It seems to be the same on all of my devices.
B004N6369Y|5.0|Danielle Steel is one of my all-time favorite authors and this story<br />was another example of what I like about her talent.
B0015AARJI|5.0|gracias el producto llego en un muy buen estado los recomiendo . . . . .  ' ' ' '
B000JML7EC|4.0|I read this to my 9 &11 year old boys.  Pirates and adventure and treasure, what's not to like? The language is a little difficult, but they understood the story, and looked forward to our reading times.  I think the 11 year old enjoyed it more, so I would recommend ages 10 and up.
B008YWY0HK|3.0|I purchased this for my granddaughter and it is a good movie but I did not like the disrespect they allowed the daughter to have her Mother, now of course everything works out fine at the end but I guess I should say is a better movie for a older child one that has learned not to talk sassy to their parents!
B000VOC90Y|5.0|This backpack can carry a lot of stuff in both weight and volume. I can put a lot more weight in it than my last backpack, and it feels lighter and more comfortable on my back. There are a lot of pockets everywhere on it, which is kind of good and bad. You can be very organized with it, but the down side is no one pocket is very big.
1616550414|5.0|This is an absolute must-have for fans of The Legend of Zelda.<br />It has a beautiful binding and is full of amazing art and interesting details on the series of video games.<br />My one complaint is that it focuses far too heavily on Skyward Sword. There are no more than three pages (!) dealing with Majora's Mask, which is a bit disappointing.<br />Overall, it is a five-star product, and I would recommend it to any serious fan (having played most of the games in the series) of The Legend of Zelda.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|I decided to read it when I saw the movie come out - definitely should read it! It's touching and worth it! You will fall in love with Alex!

193413712X|5.0|With so many reviews available, I'm not going to address the good/bad of the book (although I loved it from the beginning). I just want to share  my viewpoint as an epileptic:<br />Epilepsy was untreatable and epileptics were often locked up when Howard was living. Epileptics need regular hours and rest. Howard was working hard, excrutiating hours which would have exacerbated his condition.<br />Epilepsy is not typically inherited. It is more usually due to a head injury.<br />Epileptics typically suffer secondary injuries due to a seizure.  When ordinary people fall, they brace themselves on knees and elbows. Epileptics are almost thrown to the ground and they hit hard. While they are seizing, they clench their jaws. Poor George, but Howard wasn't biting him deliberately.<br />Epileptics are associated with mysticism and spiritual,and there may be an actual physiological tie for that. Howard wasn't just mooning over the falling of the snow. He was really living in the moment in the way that others -- like his wife -- could not. George by way of contrast could mark each moment of the passing day with his engineer's precision.<br /><br />Like many people suffering from a disease, Howard was affected by his epilepsy very deeply, and in reading the book, it's important to remember that, especially since he begins to heal towards the end.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|I couldn't wait for this season 3 to come out . I just love this show. It is wonderul and I watch several episodes at a time.
B00AMBH70S|2.0|I was really looking forward to this after watching the first 3 Bourne movies this week. Was really let down with this movie. Jason Bourne makes this new guy look like a comedian. This movie must have been produced all in 2 or 3 days.
B002SSUQFG|1.0|This is advertised as a man watch. But the watch sent to me was a ladies watch. No where near what is on the site.
B009EEFTMC|2.0|I am glad I did not pay for this game ... I thought the game was a bit rough around the edges and with only two play modes it got boring quickly.

1592407889|5.0|I've always suspected what is written in this book was the real situation. It wasn't what Shirley said in her books about Sachi, it was what wasn't said. I had a feeling that she had never connected with her child on any level least of all emotionally and it also got to the point that when Sachi was mentioned I would think ah, the token Sachi offering.<br /><br />I've read all Ms Maclaine's books and if anyone would like to get a glimpse of who and what she really is aside from the self aggrandizing that goes on in her own books, here is your start.<br /><br />I think Sachi was brave to publish this whilst her mother is still alive and I thank her for that because it was a great read, I couldn't put it down and finished it in a day. I hope it has been cathartic for her in some way because what was lost in this particular mother-daughter relationship can never be recovered.<br /><br />There was one glaring omission though, Ira and Kathlyn Beatty. I'm taking it that there was no contact or relationship with her maternal grandparents because there was little contact and a token relationship with her mother.
B000001GQQ|5.0|Argerich tackles some of the toughest music ever written. In fact, I think that Scarbo is probably THE toughest piano work to play. Her performances were absolutely brilliant.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|The original cable's plastic outer-casing crumbled away. Called and she was most helpful - replacement was exactly as expected; same as original! Received it quickly, also.
B0042TV4IW|4.0|this series is well acted and produced.  It addresses issues of the time period with humor and good taste.  It is gentle program and refreshing to watch.
B00BB8RKH6|4.0|I really like Denzel Washington and have never been disappointed in his movies. This one was a little surprising. The title had me thinking along one line when in fact the story took a different road. Didn't matter. I really like it!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|graphics are amazing. wish the games were more of a challenge. I enjoy the horse sounds and being able goblet the horses
B001TH15UM|4.0|When I picked up this blu-ray at the store, I see that it is more than just Asia getting together performing the music of Asia.  This is a super group where the four members came from other successful rock bands.  In fact, big Progressive Rock bands. Geoff Downes (The Buggles) and Steve Howe from Yes, John Wetton from King Crimson, and Carl Palmer from Emerson, Lake, and Palmer.<br /><br />In the early eighties, it was obvious to see that the Progressive Rock era was dying if not dead already. Yes continued and had a pop album, Genesis too. Even King Crimson continued in the eighties. So, it was no surprise to see the icons of past Progressive Rock bands get together to make it big in the pop rock genre.<br /><br />So, they played favorites from their collaboration as well as played some songs from their past, including Steve Howe's past with Yes, they performed \\"Roundabout\\". With Carl Palmer, they played \\"Fanfare For The Common Man\\". With John Wetton, they played \\"In The Court of the Crimson King\\" but I don't know why they played that particular song.  Wetton wasn't on that album from King Crimson.  He joined King Crimson around 1973. Then, of course, with Geoff Downes they played \\"Video Killed The Radio Star.\\" It was okay, but I think that they should have had a guest female vocalist (or even the taped recording of the female backing vocal), to make that song sound more authentic. To me, it was the female voice that made that song so cool.<br /><br />Anyway, the one thing I found most disappointing about this blu-ray is that, although the video quality is excellent, but the sound quality is very weak. In fact, I think it is a monaural recording. I have a great bass-intensive sound system hooked up to my blu-ray and amplifier.  But, this concert disc sounds no better through my stereo then if I just had it play through the TV itself. But, this concert on blu-ray is still worthwhile because, I love the 80's. And this band was a strong part of it's humble beginnings.
B004H1V5RU|5.0|Great fun for every family member - no matter what their age!  Little ones will be fascinated by the movement (with supervision, of course!) - and even grandma will get a kick out of it!  Better price here on Amazon than I saw in the stores.  Great present for home or to have as a great conversation starter on your desk!
B007SYWFRM|4.0|Personally I think this is a fun game. My 7yr old daughter and I have a fun time playing it together. Neither of us are serious gamers so just to pass time it does the trick. We don't get crazy and spend real cash, we just go with flow and have a little fun. As far as one of the previous (lengthy) comments, it's a GAME not life so relax and enjoy.  :)
B00068TJM6|5.0|This watch looks great on my huband and he has had no problems with it working!  The dark background and the white arms and markings make it easy to read.  Also - we got this specifically - because it does NOT have an eco drive!
B00B2V66VS|2.0|it started out great we have a ball playing ,now it has crashed, goes right back to menu. will not open.real shame,great game if it works.
B002RI9UBS|5.0|I rated the book 'Life of Pi' an excellent read. I could not put my Kindle down and kept reading until the book was finished. It was hard to believe that someone could survive and have the experience that he did. If it hadn't been a true story, it would be a great fictional read as well.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|Very captivating game not too difficult and nice scares every now and again scared the bejesus out of my son

0743487486|2.0|If you have a good understanding of the application of behavior mod to parenting, then this book can perhaps be food for thought about how you use it.  But it is full of misinformation.<br /><br />Behavior mod is not something discovered by scientists in the mid 20th Century.  Every human discovers it early in life. Kids use in on parents, family members use it on each other.  Google Patterson Coercive Cycle for an example.  All scientists discovered were the dynamics of the process.<br /><br />The biggest potential problem with behavior mod is not that it works in the short run but might be harmful in the long run.  It's that behavior mod is often harmful in short run because you can naturally fall into an unskilled pattern of reinforcing unwanted behaviors while trying to control them.  (Note that Kohn does not make a blanket argument against all control.)<br /><br />Read a book like the Kazdin Method to learn the real story of how behavior mod applies to parenting.  Read this book if you want to debate how much you should use it.<br /><br />By the way, Kohn's list of alternatives to praise are very good and useful applications of behavior mod.  But Kohn obviously does not know this, he does not understand what he is talking about.  Ironically, these behavior mod methods are one of the few positive things that Kohn recommends without reservations.

B008Y5OW20|5.0|Unlike Rod Stewart ,Jeff Lynne has always loved and recorded orchestra music. He sings these standards beautifully. His haunting voice shows great respect for these songs. Old Rod was just trying to extend his career singing the standards . When Jeff sings these songs they sound great. Rod had no business singing the classics. He just isn't worthy
B000MQC9H4|5.0|This rates up there with the great Christmas love stories like White Christmas with Bing Crosby, Danny Kaye, Rosemary Clooney, and others. I love Kate Winslet in this movie She is not only beautiful but a talented actress as well.  Jack Black was terrific in this one as well as Jude Law and Cameron Diaz.  A great addition to your holiday movie collection.
B000AYEL6U|5.0|I haven't read the book yet, but you can bet that it will be my next read! However wonderful the book may be, I believe that this adaptation lived up to it. The screenplay, the actors, and all the supporting work (sets, costume, etc) were tremendous.<br /><br />What a wonderful love story, the feeling of inadequacy from Thornton to deserve the love of a lady like Margaret was heartfelt. Margaret, on her part, is a strong female character and her dislike for Thornton was real - she didn't get caught up in his wealth, but in the person. Then when he proved to her that he was good, she didn't throw herself at him but maintained a respectful front. I believe she did so because she didn't want to belabor the fact that she hurt him when she rejected him and he has moved on. Then there was the misunderstanding with Frederick that kept Thornton at a distance upon her departure, but he did decide to after her when he realized that there wasn't another man in the way. I could watch the scene in the end at the train station over and over..so romantic!<br /><br />I didn't care too much about the whole strike deal, but I did like the personal story regarding Margaret's friendship with the Higgins family and also the future dealings between Nicholas and Thornton. The two men are intelligent, hardworking, pragmatic workers with similar backgrounds - they would make for good friends and I'm glad they saw that in each other.
B0095ZMMCK|4.0|Very timely story that builds on great characters and the story flows very well.  This would make a great airplane or vacation read.
B005DNO7MQ|5.0|This is the remastered version of Gladiator and it looks great and sounds great and a worthy movie to own.
B009RI4FRU|5.0|it was a great movie, there wasn't really anything i didn't like about it.i really enjoyed this film... very well done.
B009K0P10K|5.0|Greatest show ever.  Victoria is the epitome of diva in this show.  I can't wait to watch all of the current shows.
B00AE2J5HI|4.0|i was pleasantly surprised by this movie. It was a flick i wanted to watch in theatres, but didn't get a chance to.i liked it despite shia labeouf, who was actually ok in his role.
B008PSPNFG|5.0|I was stoked to receive this album. I love all the tracks but my favorites are The Story of Light, John the Revelator, Gravity Storm, No More Amsterdam, and Sunshine Electric Raindrops. The Story of Light is a tune that is very intricate with the layering of tracks. The more volume you have the more different parts you hear. This song nearly brought me to tears when I finished learning about counterpoint. It gives me goosebumps to hear the piano and guitar go at it together.
B00B7G3NFU|4.0|i watched this movie under protest. despite it being an oscar nominated film, i was a little wary. my girlfriend was determined and i think i ended up enjoying it more than she did.good movie, for people who aren't hung p on the &#34; taboo&#34; aspect of it.also not for people who are easily insulted by nudity and a religious venue being used to describe sexual encounters to a priest.
B005LAIHSG|5.0|I had heard so many mixed reviews about this movie I just had to see for myself!  It was better than I expected & is now one of my favorites.
B005LAJ1O0|5.0|At first I was disturbed by this show but as I got more into it my husband and I became obsessed! Definitely recommend buying this season. Every time we go to the store to buy it it is sold out- can't wait to see what is in store for the second season.
B0070Y46UY|2.0|I'm not sure what I expected to get from this novel, but it wasn't what I got.  Which was nothing!  The book moves very slow.  There are pages and pages of description for some things and then others there are 2 words.  The book is very graphic and confusing at times.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Great reading.  The movies can't capture all the details the way a book can.  Highly recommend to teenagers and adults.
1589795474|5.0|Really liked this book.  Unlike some other books written my those who have gotten rich, this book takes a more objective view of milionaires, and really delves into some of their character traits and habits.  I believe this book can be more influential toward helping a 'regular guy' become a millionaire.  Very good book.
B000FCKIFU|4.0|I gave Camel Club 4 stars because I love the action, plot twists, and total interaction of the characters. Oliver Stone and his crew keep your interest and heart rate elevated from page 1. The whole series is a must read for lovers of exciting action fiction.
B007SYWFRM|2.0|I really didn't get this game it was a little hard to get into, I got bored with it really fast.
B000UZNRS2|5.0|Whether helping a friend escape the clutches of a psychotic casino owner or clearing the name of a CIA agent wrongly accused of treason, Oliver Stone and the Camel Club deliever. The action is fast and furious with surprises at every turn. Read it!

B0053Q9DHW|5.0|With over 25 film adaptations of the iconic Charlotte Bronte novel, it would be a near impossibility for anyone to select a favorite, much less identify the penultimate adaptation. I have personally viewed five, and it's difficult enough to select a favorite with only that limited viewing; but of these, my favorite is the 2005 Masterpiece Theatre miniseries. And that is because in order to flesh out the novel to any degree and to fully develop the characters, a miniseries format is almost a necessity. But there are some excellent theatrical adaptations too - the 1996 Franco Zeffirelli version with Charlotte Gainsbourg and William Hurt and the 1997 Robert Young version, with Ciaran Hinds and Samantha Morton, come to mind; and both are superb. This one is on a par with both of them and if I had to pick a favorite, I'd select this one...they are all 5-star films though and all very highly recommended. The performance of Australian actress, Mia Wasikowski, is my primary reason for placing this one at the top of the list. Having recently re-read the novel, I'm convinced the characterization of Jane, as portrayed by the very young Wasikowski, is closer to what Bronte had in mind. The appearance of Dame Judi Dench as Mrs Fairfax is also a scale tipper; and director, Cary Fukunaga's decision to emphasize the Gothic elements of the story also elevates this adaptation in my eyes. The casting - aside from Wasikowski and Dench - is also spot-on. If you've never seen a film adaptation of &#34;Jane Eyre&#34; you won't be disappointed by queuing this one up first; but after you watch this, queue up one of the fine miniseries adaptations to gain a full appreciation of the novel...and by all means read the novel.
B009O2XY12|5.0|I like playing this game because the levels get harder the more that you play.  I can spend hours playing this.
B007REV4YI|5.0|Fifty years ago - can it have been that long - the first movie in the James Bond series of films, &#34;Dr No&#34;, was released; and I can remember watching that movie in 1962 like it was yesterday. This film is #23 in the series...and it is among the best; with a mix of original plot devices intermingled with some of the traditional devices from the Sean Connery originals...the theme music, the Aston Martin, the reintroduction of Q and Moneypenny; etc. With an interesting plotline, featuring an MI6 agent gone bad, who is hell bent on killing his nemesis, M...along with various and sundry other agents, including Bond, who may get in his way. Daniel Craig delivers his best performance to date as Bond; as does Dame Judi Dench, as M. And this iteration of the James Bond story features the quintessential antagonist (my opinion) of all the Bond films, Raoul Silva, played with superb villainy by Javier Bardem, One of the mainstays of the films, the Bond women also play into the story, beginning with Judi Dench as M, who has a much more prominent role in this film. In addition to Dench, look for Naomie Harris as Eve Moneypenny, the only Bond girl, who has a significant role. On the MI6 lineup, look for Ralph Fiennes as Mallory; Ben Whishaw as Q; and Albert Finney as the grizzled gamekeeper of Bond's ancestral Skyfall Estate in Scotland. A worthy addition to the Bond Franchise, this one should be ranked among the five or 6th best...my opinion of course.
B009VSW15Y|4.0|I like the pictures it takes they are great, but I think its stupid you can';t see from the back what picture yoy are taking. You have to look at it from an angle to see if it taking the picture right.
B004HO6I4M|5.0|Blu a domesticated blue Macaw, who was captured as a chick, cannot fly. And you, my fellow cinemaphobes, know that in the end, someway, somehow, Blu will be flying. After some excellent computer-animated features - ICE AGE, HORTON HEARS A WHO, etc - Blue Sky Studios hit a home run on this, their sixth feature. The visual technology here - especially in 3D - is every bit as good as the best from Pixar, DreamWorks and Disney Studios. Beyond the visuals, though, this is just a fun film for the entire family, with a humorous, heartwarming story...the actual rating is G, not PG; Blue Sky was able to get the original rating changed. There is also some top drawer voice acting in this film, by Jesse Eisenberg, as the nerdy, flightless, Blu; Ann Hathaway, as his love interest, Jewel; Leslie Mann as Linda, the owner of Blu; and Rodrigo Santoro as Tulio, who wants to get Blu and Jewel together because they are the last of their species. Also listen for Jamie Foxx as Nico, a canary who looks like Tweetie-Bird; and George Lopez, as Raphael, a Toucan who helps Blu and Jewel. There is plenty of adventure; plenty of romance between Blu and Jewel and Linda and Tulio; and plenty of song and dance numbers to a Brazilian beat...it ain't called RIO for nothing. And since this is a family movie - great for kids and adults of all ages - you know the ending will be a happy one. One of my favorite animated features and I think it will become one of yours too.
B004SD5GZ4|1.0|Every time I try to install this app it never works, I would love to have this app or somethng like it that works on my kindle.  I was very dissapointed.
B004WCTLNY|4.0|Do we control our destinies; do we have freedom of choice; or does our omnipotent and omniscient God and his band of angels - the Chairman and his Adjustment Bureau - sometimes step in and predestine the affairs of men? Interesting question, that has been debated by Christians and Jews - perhaps the followers of other religions too - since time immemorial. In this compelling, well crafted film, Matt Damon, as David Norris, is an up-and-coming politician - a Hollywood liberal democrat of course - who has been predestined by the Chairman and controlled by Adjustment Bureau caseworkers to accomplish bigger and better things...to include the penultimate goal of many politicians - the Presidency. He meets a young woman - Emily Blunt as Elise Sellas - after losing his first Senate race, who encourages him to be honest in his campaigning. That meeting is also planned by the Adjustment Bureau; but Elise and David fall in love...and that is not in the Bureau's plans. Elise's destiny is to be a great dancer and her chances will be diminished if she and David become a couple; and David's chances for the presidency will be ruined. That will set the stage for what is a beautiful love story, combined w/some excellent sci/fi...fiction it may be, but if you believe in religious fate, it is altogether plausible. Blunt and Damon have superb on-screen chemistry and both deliver outstanding performances. Damon, of course, is the veteran of many such performances; and while Blunt is considered an up-and-comer by comparison, she also has some superb performances on her resume...&#34;The Young Victoria&#34;, The Devil Wears Prada&#34;, etc. Anthony Mackie, John Slattery and Terence Stamp also deliver excellent performances as Bureau caseworkers. Excellent film; highly recommended.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|It keeps you on your toes waiting to see what's going to happen next.  This book is good for adults only.
B003UESJHE|5.0|The one word to describe this film: PHENOMENAL. Every aspect of The Kings Speech was beautiful. The score perfectly sets the mood. The casting was perfect. Colin Firth was astounding! He more than deserved his Academy Award! The period costumes and architecture were striking and impressive. Firth and Rush's portrayal of an old-fashioned bromance was entertaining and touching. The build-up to the climax was suspenseful. Every shot was a work of art. Fantastic movie.
B00280LYHS|5.0|A great butt kicking adventure SIMPLY ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS EVER he really captured Greek mythology and that is awesome
B000I5XOW8|2.0|You'll get more comprehensive synopsis of the film in other reviews. I am just appalled that there is no lossless audio. For those of you that don't know, Dolby Digital 5.1 is DVD quality audio. Ripoff. The picture of course is a bit better that the DVD just because of the resolution (it WILL look better than the DVD on your HDTV) but also subpar to most blurays (even MUCH older films). Just look at what was done with Jaws. I am mainly posting this because maybe if enough people complain, it'll get a proper release, just like what happened with The Fifth Element and Total Recall (original film). Don't buy this garbage release. Five stars for the film though.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|I love this. You really get caught up in the adventure.<br />I love the graphics and its pretty spooky also.
6305882592|4.0|The film, directed by Hal Ashby, Harold and Maude, is a beautiful example of a cult classic success story.  After seeing the film for the first time, it would be easy to get wrapped up in the exaggerated character personas and their on-screen relationships; however, after seeing past the outer layer of the film, a deeper meaning can be found which causes the viewer to reexamine their own life and understanding of true happiness.  This cult classic has stood the test of time because of its excellence in acting, powerful plot and timeless score.<br /> The film stars Ruth Gordon as \\"Maude\\" and Bud Cort as \\"Harold.\\" Harold's mother has it set in her mind that Harold, a young man living in his parent's home for free, needs to find a woman with whom to settle down.  However, Harold has other things on his mind, e.g. death.  The film follows Harold through his funeral-crashing, hearse-driving, suicide-attempting days.  He is a very quiet young man, with a dark sense of humor, which would take a very special partner to appreciate.<br /> Meet Maude.  Maude is a 79-year-old woman, with quite a history.  Born and raised in a dark time and place, Maude only appears to have come out much stronger for it all.  Gordon acts with so much dedication and conviction to her character Maude, that her life-motto, \\"try something new every day\\" is incredibly believable.  She is the perfect contrast to Harold.  Maude is nearing the end of her time on earth, but is incredibly vivacious and full of life. Contrastingly, Harold is just beginning his life-journey, and cannot break with his obsession with death.<br /> The two actors ebb and flow together so naturally on screen, often the dramatic age difference seems insignificant, which becomes key to getting the film's message across.  If the chemistry were not there, it would be so easy to focus on this age gap, rather than the relationship and its true significance.  The film follows the two upon their first meeting, and their inseparable relationship from there on out.  While the ending can be interpreted as either happy or sad, depending on the viewer's life-perspective, one thing is for certain: there is resolution.  Harold and Maude will not leave its viewers out to dry.<br />Due largely in part to the time in which it was filmed - 1972 - the cinematography in Harold and Maude would be considered sub-par today. Nevertheless, the plot is so powerful that it clearly compensates for the lack of special effects.  In addition to the powerful plot, the score in the film is so unique that it forms its own storyline woven throughout.  Cat Stevens composed music specifically for this film, which has also been used in numerous movies since Harold and Maude's release.<br /> In this beautifully original piece, the relationship between two seemingly unsuspecting friends is examined from all angles.  In a classic story of not knowing how to live until it's almost too late, Maude teaches Harold about what it means to be happy, and how to achieve this happiness.  In turn, Harold begins to live a life he knows Maude will be proud of.  There is no doubt this is a must-see film with edgy topics, characters and humor, which really ask the viewer to reevaluate what it means to live a full and happy life, in a new quirky and unusual way.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Easy fun<br />amazing graphics if thats how u spell it lol<br />anywho love love love and i know you will too buy it<br />ps i only did this cuz of the little note they wrote it on to ask me<br />love love love

B008673ZAQ|5.0|This is the best love story I have read so far! I cannot wait for the next book to be available on the kindle!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Just when you feel like you have nobody to turn to or trust, wherever your darkest secrets are hiding, there's someone to make you feel complete and help you out the pieces of your life together. Never give up hope.
B005LAII12|4.0|Except for the kidnapping arc, I actually enjoyed this movie.  I liked the fact that the bear existed for everyone to see.  In too many movies such a character is seen by only one person, is always being hidden from the public, or is only actually alive in its own circle, i.e. Toy Story.  The humor is crude, but for the most part realistic, albeit with a teddy bear playing the stoner friend.  Overall, it is a decent buddy movie.
B003UBTX6S|5.0|I loved this book. It is so addicting. I couldn't put it down. I can't wait for the next one. I can't wait to see where it goes from here.
1439153663|1.0|There are so many books of higher quality to read than this one.  Any work by Toni Morrison is vastly superior as is work by Zora Neal Hurston, Alice Walker, William Faulkner, Richard Wright, James Baldwin, or an especially enlightening historical novel The Known<br />World by Edward P. Jones about blacks buying their freedom and then owning other saves. Why settle for an amateur novel  (The Kitchen House) containing \\" research\\" that is  no more than insignificant  padding , writing on a junior high school level except for the depravity of its characters, the lack of any  believable motivation or psychology of these  stereotyped characters , the lack of a sense of an outside world, and prudish language that contrasts with the behavior it is describing. Really, there's better, more challenging material out there.<br /><br />I recommend for bookclubs Olive Kitteridge by Elizabeth Strout and the Imperfectionists by Tom Rachman ( hilarious) and for something really wild but so discussable, Jenifer Egan's A Visit from the Goon Squad.
B005GSVFBE|5.0|I bought this 3D movie used, but it was as perfect as a brand new one costing twice the price!
B00756GRUE|4.0|The good; for an actual divers watch, and solar powered too, this watch is well worth it.  It's big, clunky, and heavy but not terribly so.  The ring around the watch is angled and even though it's the largest and tallest watch I own it doesn't snag on cuffs, even with a coat that has knit cuffs.  It's typical quartz accuracy...significantly more accurate than my Omega automatic that cost 4 times as much.  It's also a spectacular looking watch on the wrist.  The luminescence of the dial is excellent, indeed Seiko is famous for it, and will last 4 hours or more with a 30 second blast from a strong flashlight (I would just make the dot on the dial bigger).  The minute and hour hands are very distinct and easy to make out in any conditions.<br /><br />The nit picking; out of the box there was a slight problem.  Nothing big but it jumped out at me...where the watch band attaches to the watch, there are thin stamped steel covers (not solid links like many watches).  One of the covers was loose and looked bad.  I took the band off and fixed it, but it was still a mistake.  Others have mentioned the screw in parts aren't so great.  As a lifelong machinist who has threaded thousands of things it bugs me.  The top one keeps coming lose.  They seem to almost gall.  Hopefully they're wear in and not strip like what happened to another reviewer.  Also, like another reviewer mentioned, the extendable wetsuit piece on the band seems rinky dink.  I'd be afraid to use it.  Unlike another reviewer however, I have no problem deploying the extension.  There's a trick to it.  Once you get the trick it's easy.  The chronograph hand is very thin and the luminescent triangle on it is small.  It's hard for someone like me to see and I have 20/20 eyesight.  The small chronograph dial that tells you how much time has passed in minutes is also very small and hard to see and depending on the time of day, you may not see it at all.  There's a large amount of glare that comes from the glass itself...more expensive watches have an anti-reflective coating on the inside of the glass, but I suppose that's what makes them more expensive.<br /><br />Overall given the price of this watch it's a very good watch...especially since it's excellent at doing exactly what it's supposed to do: tell you what time it is.  The fit and finish could be a wee bit better, and that's comparing it to other Seikos half the price.<br /><br />UPDATE; It's been a little over 7 months since I first set the watch, synchronized to an atomic clock.  She's still within a second of the actual time.  Phenomenal.  Many of my watches are self-winding and it can be annoying having to set a watch after letting it wind down.  This is now my go to watch since I know it's going to be accurate and running.<br /><br />Also, the screw in parts have actually worn in, and are just fine now.<br /><br />UPDATE #2  I almost lost this watch yesterday.  One of the pins holding the links together just simply fell out as I was walking down the street in a city.  I think Seiko has to work on their fir and finish better.  I would have been heartbroken if I had lost this watch.
B004UJAOLM|5.0|A wonderful classic  one of my all time favorites<br /> Sad and heart wrenching but full of unfailing hope for the future
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|This is a good game, I enjoyed playing it. the graphics were good, I like the story line also. I played it all the way through in one evening. I didn't want to put it down.
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|Somehow, these guys have managed to capture the essence of Holmes, and they have a good riff on the Watson thing. Plus the Lestrade characters, i.e., the cops, are not portrayed as dummies.<br /><br />But be warned that there are some gory scenes, though nothing extraordinary by today's debased standards.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|For $0.99, you'd struggle to find a more clever near-future comedy. A quick read, but very well written. My only complaint was the abrupt ending -- I wanted more!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|My most favorite TV series...ever!  I love the fact that each character has just the right retort to other characters.  Excellent writing!
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|The greatest gift someone can give is their heart and that is exactly what happened<br />in this book.  Just when you think she (Amanda) has lost another love she gets her<br />son back.
B00APUTEBG|3.0|I enjoyed The Cold Light of Day a bit more than expected. I watched it hoping to get a feel for Henry Cavil`s acting range and I was not disappointed. He is top notch and is only further helped by an excellent A-list supporting crew (Bruce Willis and Sigourney Weaver). The action is a bit weak for a &#34;spy film&#34; and the obligatory car chase at the end was a bit too long (see 2 chases in 1), but the characters were enjoyable and most importantly very believable. While some of the stunts are a bit &#34;action movie&#34; the reactions and decisions are of a &#34;real&#34; person... What would you do trapped in a foreign country with no allies and no training?<br />One major complaint is the lack of love interest or more accurately the shoddily written twist that turns the love interest into a mere companion. I say shoddily written as the chemistry and actions of the couple are not those of &#34;just friends&#34; but due to a last minute script addition it gives a distinct feel of Empire Strikes Back (if you get my drift) ;-)
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I have recommended this book to anyone who will listen to me.  It makes you realize how precious<br />love is.
B000MV8AE0|5.0|Good movie.  Great music and Ed Harris was very good as Beethoven.  Would recommend to music lovers.  Of course, buying from Amazon, the DVD arrived on time and in perfect shape.

B007J4T2G8|2.0|I purchased this book because I was curious to see what all the hoopla was about.  While reading it, I was unimpressed.  More scenes and less communicating back and forth thru e-mails would have been a better use of literary talents.  The couple was much more inviting and engaging when they were both in the same room or space.  I know there are two more books, but really?  To end the book right a major junction in their lives.  But then, maybe that was the point...  All in all, I was very disappointed and quite frankly can't understand what all the hoopla was about!!!

B0063IH60K|5.0|got this game for my kindle fire.the movement of the cards is good and the graphics are great.  Would recommend for solitare fans.
B00ATPVA78|4.0|I wish I could give this game five stars, but I had to use the help button too often, and skip too many puzzles. Maybe that's attributed to my own ignorance, but on the puzzles I wasn't sure what the objective was half the time unless it was something I was familiar with. As I travelled through the game I felt lost as to my next step. I think if the journal were bigger I would have thought to check it for my objectives more often - my fault again. The graphics are beautiful. The hidden objects related to the game and weren't part of a jumbled mess. The silhouette pictures were difficult to see though. Overall, I really liked this game and was happy I spent the money.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|There are no words to accurately describe this book. It was absolutely wonderful, well-written and chillingly sad. This novel makes me appreciate my life and notice the beauty in the world and universe.

1609613937|5.0|My bookshelves were groaning from all of the diet books and yet, I kept gaining weight.  That is, until I read The Starch Solution.  Finally a book based on scientific evidence, that is not just a bunch of money-making hype and most important, presents a plan for health that works.<br /><br />The program is quite easy to follow and requires only a few adjustments.  I stopped eating meats and dairy, eat plants, seeds, grains and fruit.  The excess weight is melting off and by adding some yoga and pilates, my body is firming up.  But, the main reason I started this plan was to reduce my cholesterol and reverse the cardiac disease I have.  Time will tell about the cholesterol, but within a week I got a burst of energy, feel great and am on the right track.<br /><br />The book is well done, the recipes reasonable and easy.  I wish there was more science in it, because that is my background.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
B00AMS2FV2|5.0|I enjoyed the movie. It was something different and not boring at anytime. The whole family was able to enjoy it together.
B00AIQP9DE|1.0|This game is free when you start then when you start playing it ask you to pay $ 4.99 on Amazon to complete it. After I bought the rest of the game for my Kindle HD, it locked up. When I got to the scene with the barn and car, it would not allow me to free the car from the wood block. I would not recommend this game. There are lots of good. games that are cheaper
B006LSZECO|1.0|Unless this novel gets better I'll never finish it.  On top of it's lack of immediate interest my Kindle touch 3C decides not to hold my place.  While reading this week it suddenly jumped back close to the first of the book.  When I tried to &#34;Go To&#34; it just wouldn't move.  That in itself is exhasperating!
B008X8QCTO|4.0|I liked this game because it didn't have too many HO scenes. It was fun to play with my 7 year old. Just scary enough but, not too scary for the little one. We prefer game with few HO scenes and puzzles that are not too hard. This was one of the better games.

B000E5N6LG|5.0|Great movie. Like brand new. Perfect condition. I watched the whole movie, It wasvery entertaing. Going to watch it again.
B00B0ZT9NI|4.0|I'll admit, when I first saw that the film Argo was \\"based on a declassified true story\\", my expectations fell slightly.  Even leaving aside films that clearly aren't actually \\"true stories\\" (sorry, Haunting in Connecticut), Hollywood very rarely produces films that are true to real events.  I was somewhat skeptical that this one would be any different, but I was happily proven wrong.<br /><br />The historical backdrop for the film is late 1979 and early 1980, during the Iranian Hostage Crisis, and we're immediately immersed in the time period.  Stock footage is used to great effect early on, and ropes you into the film's setting instantly.  Given the `80's were not that long ago, the ability to recreate them may not immediately impress every viewer, but the sheer dedication to recreating the world of a generation ago is amazing.  The paranoia of the Cold War is still clearly felt, and the news reels from the era drip with frustration with at the impotency of the Carter administration.<br /><br />The story focuses not on the hostages in the embassy, but on a footnote in the history books: six Americans managed to escape to the streets before the embassy was overrun, and took shelter at the Canadian ambassador's house.  The difficulty is extracting them from the country before the Iranian militants discover them.  The plot moves at a brisk clip, never staying in one place too long, as we meet the people responsible for getting them out:  Tony Mendez (played by Ben Affleck) is a CIA agent brought in to consult the State Department on how to deal with the situation.  Despite his skill and experience, he gives little chance of success for the default plans the State Department has come up with, the main one being to simply give the six refugees bikes and pray they make it the 300 miles to the border.<br /><br />With the help of Jack O'Donnell (Played by Bryan Cranston), Mendez puts together what sounds like an outrageous plan: extract the refugees under the pretense of being a film crew scouting locations for a science-fiction film.  With the help of John Chambers (John Goodman) and Lester Siegel (Alan Arkin) to provide the Hollywood credibility, Mendez sets to work getting his \\"film\\" ready to go.  There's a very appealing tongue-in-cheek portrayal of Hollywood here, depicting most filmmakers as artists either compelled or outright eager to sell-out to the system for a bit more cash.  Given Affleck is a fairly big person in Hollywood, it's hard to tell if he meant for this to be satire, or just a playful elbow at his colleagues, but it's appealing nonetheless.<br />The actors put in solid, but unmemorable performances, with Goodman and Cranston doing most of the heavy lifting.  The real focus here is on the story itself, which is told with appealing restraint.<br /><br />Argo is a very believable political thriller, replacing bombs and countdown timers with people who are simply very scared and just want to get home.  Given how complicated the politics were at the time, it's a credit to the film that it doesn't point fingers.  To do otherwise would take away from the fact that this is really just a film about human ingenuity and decency.  I highly recommend it.being a film crew scouting locations for a science-fiction film.

B0013A1T8I|5.0|The movie was good. Something you really have to watch and pay attention too. Going to watch it again sometime soon.
0380715430|1.0|I had to read this book for my summer reading for English and at first it was interesting but then it was just completely boring. I never finished the book because every time I sat down to read it, I would fall asleep 5 minutes later. Other than that, it arrived quickly and on time which was very nice.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|This show was recommended to me by my sister. I watched the first episode of Season 1 and I was hooked.  I watched the first two seasons in about two weeks.  I absolutely LOVE IT!!!
B007UPNA6Y|2.0|As a Jack Reacher fan, I was let down by this book. While it started off well, the book starts meandering and the last sequence drags on for ever.
0345803507|5.0|Once I started reading I couldn't stop! I spent all my free time reading this book. I was so addicted to it.... finding out what happend next and once I finished it I immediately purchased the other two! Had to find out what happened next! Such A Good Book!
B007SGM084|3.0|Good but gets sappy at the end. I was expecting some very provocative imagery, it was there sometimes but got kind of lost in the romance. Still not too bad if you like steamy romances
0345803493|5.0|Once I read the first book I was hooked! Second book was Amazing, you learn so much more in this book. Very interesting and of course a big mysterious ending that leaves you with questions and wanting more!
B00899F0G8|5.0|This is amazing addicting show you won't want to stop watching once you start! Start from season 1! It definitely keeps you on the edge of your seat!
0345803485|5.0|The third book really gets interesting, has some excellent twist that were not expected! Just all around good story line. The moment I started reading the first book I was so attacted and if I had any free time I was reading these books! Wish there were more books however the third one did wrap it up good in my opinion it doesn't just stop lets you know some of the there after part. Just really excellent book!
B00992CF6W|5.0|On 6.0.1 update has amor the nether with the nether respected core on creative mode New blocks nether blocks to and sand atone slaves and statues<br /><br />  :)
B003SI6C4O|4.0|I couldn't write a review that depicts the movie any better then the ones written by \\"Wildness\\" and \\"Kaya Savas\\", these two did an awesome job in capturing the essence of the entire movie.<br /><br />Sorry the review is not a personal one.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I thought that after the first two seasons I might begin to tire of this one, but the exact opposite has happened.  I love it and am eagerly anticipating Season 4.  The characters are amazingly complex, which I love veraciously.  I was a bit upset at the last episode, last scene (won't say more for fearing of ruining it for others) but I should have been, so that too was successful.  Hands down the best series on TV.
B004WGIXX4|4.0|After passing this movie over for numerous other one's, the wife and I found ourselves bored out of our minds one night and decided to give this a shot.<br /><br />I have to say, that this ended up being a big surprise! It did have it's parts that seemed to drag on a little, but overall we thoroughly enjoyed it and would recommend watching it. Ashton Kutcher did a great job in the movie.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this is an amazing game its just like me with my horse his name is Mater we call him Tater-tot!!!(: this is a great game good graphics
B008JGSM6G|5.0|It is never ending fun and keeps you on your toes. Pretty addicting too, and very easy to play and figure out.
B005IQZB14|5.0|So interesting.  I kept putting myself on the trail.  I thinking could do it.  I didn't want it to be over .<br />I used a detailed map yo follow her trail.
B007QPFGJW|3.0|I'm guessing there's a sequel coming because the ending left me wishing<br />for something else.  I have read most of Nesbo's translations<br />and really like the main character but this one left a lot of unanswered questions
B00A6PD9I4|2.0|As normal for a Pixar animation the graphics were great.  However, the storyline was just not that exciting.  Knowing it was nominated for awards I guess I just expected a lot more.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|By far one of the best shows on television. The acting is outstanding. The writing and directing, exceptional.  Pure quality.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|This is an intriguing novel.  Max is quite a person, and the insights revealed into both prison life and going under cover are wonderfully shared.
B005I6EU48|5.0|I have to say that the Verso Case Cover looks great.  It always fools people who see it and then they find out it's for my Kindle Fire!  Yep, having a design on the front cover helps making sure I have the front of the Kindle if I'm not always paying attention to the position of my Kindle.  Love it and it's so sturdy.  Easy to keep clean too.  Thanks Amazon.
B00AYB0TOW|5.0|I watch a lot of movies, and not without discrimination, though I did take a chance on Dredd - I did not know what to expect, and hoped it would not suck. Note: not that it would be good, just that it would not suck, because a lot of this brand of fare does tend to. I have also never written a review - EVER - but for Dredd, I will try. I will, because Dredd, actually, is great, and this effort went sadly under the radar in 2012, while a lot of other maligned schlok got rather undeserved attention.<br /><br />Yes, there are some plot similarities with The Raid, however I do not see this as a deterrent to enjoy Dredd. It has vibe to boot, the dystopian future of Megacity One sets a pitch-perfect backdrop, aided wonderfully by a subdued synth heavy horrorscape score; Karl Urban's enactment of the relentless, one-man army Judge is about as dead on as you can get, perma-scowl and all, Olivia Thirlby does a great turn as psychic rookie Judge Anderson, and Lena Headey delivers quite the vile performance as the merciless drug queen Ma-Ma.<br /><br />The editing and pacing are taught, the special effects are not overbearing and serve the story, and on the right screen look rather beautiful and mesmerizing; the action and tension build, and overall make for a very entertaining offering.<br /><br />In this day and age of sequels, I can only wish that the crew did an even darker follow up, and let Geoff Barrow score it.
B00AHSIQWE|5.0|This was the final chapter(?) in this Batman series and more fitting ending there never was. I can't say too much without giving away details about the movie itself.<br />If you liked the first and second movies of this trilogy then you will love this last one. You really have to see the first to appreciate the last but you can still &#34;get it&#34; without viewing them and I think you will enjoy it.<br />I would caution against viewing this with young children as it is quite graphic at times.
0757302661|5.0|it was gift for someone so can't say much but price was right for sure so good buy I guess.
B00A0SLTCU|4.0|I liked this movie and really thought it was just going to be a photocopy of the original but I was surprised when it broke from the original.<br />A very good movie remake that put a really nice twist on the end. Action packed which I enjoy immensely!
B008YKGQR4|5.0|The app is great. It is so easy to use. I am very happy with it. It makes facebook easier to use on my tablet.
B004EKCNMA|4.0|It's really hard to give any kind of rating on an old classic.<br />I thought the acting was good and of course Jim added his own personal twist on the character which I thought he did well.
B00632HWOG|1.0|I downloaded this app so I could check my regular yahoo e-mail easily. This app does not work for me. It won't let me sign onto my account. I still have to go thru the browser to get to my mail which is a pain in the behind on my tablet.
B00A9X9TIW|4.0|I didn't really know what to expect from this movie. I was thinking at first it was going to be a disappointment but as it turns out I was pleasantly surprised.<br />Well thought out plot (although a bit out there). Good movie for a Friday or Saturday night with your wife or girlfriend.
B005HSL626|5.0|I downloaded this game because I saw the pig playing it on the Geico commercials and I am so addicted!!! I live this game!!!
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|Never fails me and I wake up to the sound of bells.  It's great and the best part it was free  I would  recommend this to anyone
B00A3DZ61W|5.0|I love playing the star wars version of angry birds. It gives the game a whole new deminsion. I love all the angry birds games.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|This app works great on my kindle fire! I love the volume and I don't have to keep my kindle plugged in just so it wont drain my battery.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love the pinterest app. I was unable to go onto pinterest from my tablet using the browser. With the app I can go on it in a flash! I am so happy to have this app!
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|Love the full version. Wish the story was longer but worth every penny. Would recommend to anyone that likes puzzles.
B004P8JPS6|4.0|Good plot, great setting; the book just didn't grab me the way second son did.  Reacher is always Reacher though.
B009YP9L7U|3.0|Thought it was pretty good.  Could have been a little more romantic,like some books I have read.  Overall I enjoyed reading it.
B004X75RK4|5.0|Great comedy, I laughed most all through the movie.  Ryan and Sandra both do a good job.  I highly recommend.
B00881VLCE|4.0|Working real jigsaw puzzles has always relaxed me. And this app works just as well. If I am stressed out after work or on lunch break I just get this out and let my mind clear of all the stress. It really works. Forget about the other stuff and put your mind on a puzzle!
B009UX2YAC|3.0|This game was cool until it trashed all that I had on the game! This makes you really really mad when you have everyone unlocked and a ton of hoverboards! It made me start all over!!!!!  Make Me Mad!!!!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I had little expectations upon picking up this book. Granted, I have seen the Notebook and Dear John, but never actually bothered to pick up one of Nicholas Sparks' novels. I always heard they were overrated. But boy and I grateful I did. This book literally had my emotions in serious turmoil. There was one point in the book where not only was the story line causing me anxiety, but the way the paragraphs were spaced and the way he switched between characters threw me over the edge. I couldn't handle it. I couldn't even bear to read that part sitting down. And the ending of the story was so emotional and real. I absolutely loved this book and can not wait to see the movie.
B007VYAJAE|5.0|Marley was really quite incredible;  not the pothead I had been led to believe he was. Enjoyed.  Too bad family is fighting about the money so much.  Amazing how they went from the worst poverty to becoming extremely wealthy.  Shows how hard work and creativity are rewarded.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I had a hard time knowing how fast my kindle was draining.  This app has helped a lot with time management for use and charge timing. I am glad I got this app.
B00A757EFW|1.0|IT'S HARD TO NAVIGATE ON THE KINDLE. DON'T REALLY PLAY IT MUCH THINKING OF DELETING FROM MY KINDLE.  i THINK IT WOULD BE BETTER WITH A CONTROLLER BUT ....YA KNKOW.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|i read this book before seeing the movie.<br />i am glad i did cuz the movie was sub par compared to the book<br />i enjoyed the book for the writing and the story.  it kept me entertained and waiting for the next event.  i never knew his ex was no longer in the pic until late in the book.  the dad seemed like a jerk and you wonder why Pat was halfway normal with that home environment.  i loved watching Tiffany's charater grow.<br />all that being said,  where did they come up with the movie....there was such a slim resemblance making the movie hollow and so swallow in comparison..<br />skip the movie ...read the book
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|Now I do not have to wake up late and my daughter dosn&quot;t come to school late any more. I love it so allstar I recommend thisl  to every body who has no timer and forgets alot.
B000JMKQX0|4.0|An almost realistic tale of a what-if scenario. The initial outbreak of the plague works best for the author, but later he kind of loses himself in the fiction when he tries to justify the spread of the zombie plague. No matter how you look at it, even in fiction, zombies shouldn't be able to walk to ocean floors.<br /><br />Still, despite some minor holes in the fiction, it is an amazing read.
B006MW3UZW|4.0|I try to avoid getting hooked on TV shows, but this one is only 8-ish episodes per season so it's not too much of a time commitment. Fascinating portrayal of a bygone era. I didn't expect to like this show but I was hooked after the second episode in Season 1. Lots of great acting in this show, the cast is very good overall. I have to call out Maggie Smith (AKA the crusty professor in the Harry Potter movies) in particular for her role as the dowager countess, she has some great lines.
B00079HZUM|5.0|This is great if your into stage dramas. Very interesting part of history about how only men cans act in plays. Obviously it's fictional, I'm sure there's some truth to what life was like then. And very romantic! Claire Danes is magnificent and Billy Crudop is outstanding--especially them together. And Rupert Everet is in it which is a bonus! This is one of those movies that I can just watch over and over again.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|enjoyed this book! surprised that i did, hadn't ever heard of it. About to see what else Hugh Howey has written but wanted to post this first!
B0053Q9DHW|5.0|I love this story. I have seen just about every remake of the movie and have read the book. I think I like this version the best (and the 1996 version with William Hurt and Charlotte Gainsbourg). Mia Wasikowska is a star and Michael Fassbender does wonderfully. One of those movies I can watch over and over again! If you like any of the period piece dramas, then you will definitely enjoy this.
B00A0MJA1I|5.0|This was a gift for my daughter.  It is a cute movie.  My favorite rendition is the old one w/Mary Martin playing Peter Pan but this is cute as cartoons go.
B0042YHC38|1.0|Definitely not made for men or big wormen.  For the price you pay for it, you would think that it would atleast fit around your upper arm.  IT DOESN'T.  It's a scam.  An extention strap is available for $10 ors $15 more.  Made by Japeneese for Japeneese.
0792840461|5.0|I haven't seen this movie for years.  I just ordered to have in my library.  I originally saw it years ago in the theater.
0812979656|5.0|Excellent. How many more words must I write to be polite? Seriously, if one is satisfied<br />stop with the word requirements!
B00A757EFW|3.0|Classic game has been around a long time and I can remember play it as a child. I don't have the energy needed anymore to keep up with the fast pace, but a good game none the less
B00B2V66VS|4.0|Very fun and different from the first. Still has a few bugs on mine bit overall is good. Some game objectives could be a little  more specific, other than that, just run!
B00AA0TJO8|1.0|Did not care for this game. Very frustrating as I found that I had to return to the begining even though I passed a level.
B0012FHGCW|5.0|I enjoyed the movie, maybe because as a young man I had these types of desires also.I thought that the lead actor played the part well.
B008BU70HW|5.0|Very good to bring anyone who is not fully familiar with all the series shows up to date. Gives good back ground of all characters.
B003G4W49C|5.0|An amazing book that takes refreshing viewpoint from children that reminds the reader that some children do have cognitive capacity solve complex problems.
0307959856|3.0|Book was very boring could not even read it not my kind of author hope others like it good luck
B00AKOB7CG|5.0|Needed to find an app for convenience; I like this one because they show ordinary individuals doing exercises in each of the grouped workouts i.e., arms, stomach, strength.....Easy to bring up on the Kindle and finally do a workout here and there.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I saw the movie before reading the novel and I  was surprised to find I loved it more than the film. I highly recommend it to all.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This review is written by a 10 year old girl:<br /> I liked this book a lot because it teaches people that even if you're face or body or your skin tone is different, just be your self. Be glad that you're alive, that people love you and that you shouldn't be treated badly by the way you look. I would want to recommend this book to people who ever got bullied by the way you look,talk,etc.. I think that this book would be an awesome lesson to read about. In this book sometimes I felt like crying and in other parts I felt like laughing. This book is a major YES!!! You need to read it!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Season two was just as good as season one. I can't wait to start watching season 3. Great period piece with interesting characters.
B0058YPGL6|1.0|Think it is a great show and want to buy it but I will buy all seasons the day they are Blu-ray with digital copy (itunes compatible) millions of Mac and PC users can't be wrong lol - actually goes for all Video product (HBO and Disney have already come to senses not sure why some like MTV and FX are resisting) and up front UV or Ultraviolet (without digital copy as well) is a no not going to buy for any reason so they loose all sales
B0027Z5DM6|4.0|Funny but a typical Adam Sandler movie. Amazon Prime download. I used some credits that I earned from a purchase and this was free.
B003U4UPTE|5.0|Well acted, well written  (Science Fiction ?) series. First two years are well worth the watching. Although, as you go through the latter seasons you might need to take notes.
0345803507|5.0|I love it! I seriously can't get over the books. The third book and the first one are my favorites. I definitely recommend these books.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|this is awesome but it exits out of the game for no reason I had to do it 3 but its awesome/amazing
0345803493|5.0|I love it! I seriously can't get over the books. I'm happy I started reading them! The third book and the first one are my favorites. I definitely recommend these books. :)
0545403359|5.0|this was a good book.  My grandson age 13 loved it.  It had adventure and was a fast moving story
0345803485|5.0|I read the ENTIRE trilogy so quickly! Right when I finished book one, I ordered books two and three right away. I was and still am hooked on these books. I'm definitely going to reread them. I finished book one in 12 hours, book two at about the same time, and book three in 14 hours. The books are great. I just wish the trilogy was longer. The relationship between Ana and Christian is just so cute!
0312330537|5.0|This book not only reveals a captivating story but an insiders look at the culture and happenings of India.  The characters are believable, entertaining and even shocking.  A fabulous book that is worth every page!
B007PT3QOQ|2.0|i like this game a lot. This version of oregon trail is fun. You spend time gathering resources to grow crops, tend farm animals, hunt, fish and build a town the way you want. i genuinely liked this game. For the first 10 minutes.<br /><br />After the 1st 10 minutes, however, this game almost forces you to pay for in game money. Your character has an energy bar that runs out very quickly. The only way to earn energy is to wait for a 1 point energy refill every 3 minutes, or pay real money to get more energy.<br /><br />You will find yourself being bored, waiting around every 3 minutes so your character can take 1 action that takes him 5 seconds.<br /><br />If you want a game to play every day for 5 minutes, this is your game. Otherwise, stay clear unless you liked to be bored and frustrated.
0321701763|5.0|this book is being used by my class and it is great. it is easy to understand. don't rely totally on the book. go thru the book and then watch video's on the you tube.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|It is invigorating and stimulating for emotional and spiritual growth. I would recommend this DVD for anyone, especially men with families.
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|Such a great read! I loved the mystery and fantasy of the story. Very well written, also the photographs were wonderful to be able to see.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I found this app when I was at school and loved it. It does have a small problem as another app that I had it sometimes does not work so I have to turn off my kindle and again after that
B004VSTP4Y|5.0|This is one of the most amazing books I've ever read, and it's made me wish I was part of the pack. I laughed, I cried, it completely swept me away on an adventure that I wish with all my heart that I was one of the pack members. I'm wishing for it right now too, and I hope that Maggie will return to this series. My final words are, &#34;Let me know when the show starts.&#34;<br />  -A major wolf-lover
1400064287|4.0|&#34;Made to Stick&#34; is a useful book which explores how to make ideas more 'sticky' -- easier to accept and remember for people. The authors provide boatloads of examples of different messages and explain why some of these work and why some of these don't work and also give examples how you could change the message format (to say the same thing!) which would make it easier for people to remember.<br /><br />The book is well structured according to the author's message template for making sticky messages. The SUCCES acronym is this template used throughout the rest of the book. The next six chapters contain one of the elements of the message template. After that is an epilogue which summaries the book and makes some closing remarks. The last part contains a small article which was added after the first release of Made to Stick.<br /><br />The six chapters are for each of the elements of the SUCCES acronym: 1) Simple -- the point of the message needs to be simple and not buried deeply inside the message. 2) Unexpected -- When something unexpected happens in the message, a sudden change or so, then it will be easier to remember the message. 3) Concrete -- ideas ought to concrete with examples as most people are concrete thinkers and won't remember abstract ideas. 4) Credible -- the source of the idea and additional details can give an idea more credibility and making it easier to remember and accept. 5) Emotional -- trying to get an emotional reaction out of people based on a message makes it easier for people to remember. We want to be rational but we are emotional. 6) Stories -- Often good ideas and messages come in stories (with lots of concreteness and color). Formulating messages in stories will increase it's stickiness.<br /><br />Each of the above chapters contains dozens of stories, examples of good and bad messages, and tips on how to improve them. Also each chapter contains a clinic in which they take a message and, using the theme of the chapter, they give two different variants of the same message and explain why one is better than the other.<br /><br />All in all, I enjoyed reading Made to Stick. It was well written and I'll remember a lot of stories from the book as they were pretty... sticky. That said, while reading the book, there was no major Aha! moment, but instead if seemed to add words and concepts to things that I had already experienced. That also made it easy to accept what was written in Made to Stick. The book didn't dramatically change the way I create messages/ideas, but it did gave me a new thinking tool to use. I was going between 3 stars (does what it should do) and 4 stars (good and recommended). I decided to stick with 4 stars. Pretty good, especially for people who give training, are in marketing or in other ways need to make easy to remember -- sticky -- messages.ve two different variants of the same message and explain why one is better than the other.<br /><br />All in all, I enjoyed reading Made to Stick.

B004ZMWUCU|5.0|I have never written a book review but felt compelled to write one for this book....I loved it. The characters are so very real and endearing. This book made me chuckle and is one of the few to have made me cry!!! I can't even say much more without giving anything away, but if you want to read a good, clean book that, in my opinion, would make a wonderful movie, then this book is for you. It is heart-wrenching, heart-warming, and definitely worth your time.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I love how deep the author goes into about mental health problems and how differently they affect everyone's lives, not just the person with the condition. This book was amazing on so many different levels and I can't wait to see how it's portrayed in a movie

0446554995|3.0|I had the sense from the vapid prior offerings that the substance would be saved for the conclusion of the trilogy. To some extent, that was fulfilled, and there were glimmers of the old Pendergast that had me on edge awaiting every publication date.<br /><br />True, it does test the bounds of credulity, but Pendergast has been good at this without crossing the line. However, there are a couple gaping holes that detract significantly from the total experience.<br /><br />Pendergast puzzles out what the invincible Alban's super power is and conjures up a way to turn it against him. Great! The stage is set for the epic confrontation and resolution and we are franticly flipping pages to get there. And finally it comes! Pendergast unleashes his mighty counter: Uh, I don't think your plan's gonna work. Alban: Really? Okay, I'll just forget about the whole world domination thing and run back to the island.<br /><br />I'm taking license here, but it was about that inane and couldn't have been a bigger letdown. Even more significantly, Pendergast does not take the opportunity to eliminate the demonic serial killer. Yeah, Alban carries some of your DNA, but so what? You've known him for like five minutes and he's a stone killer. You don't hesitate to pull the plug.<br /><br />And the remorseless Alban doesn't ace Pendergast? It's been his primary trophy objective and the man means nothing to him. Heck, human life means nothing. These gaping holes deflate the entire opus.<br /><br />The novel is larded with a couple side stories. I can understand the continuing story of Constance Greene, but this episode isn't handled well. Dr. Felder risks life and limb (literally) to obtain the snippet of hair that will verify or refute Greene's story, and then declines to look at the lab results. Yeah, right. Of course, the premise has holes because the most you could learn from the hair sample is if the person was a blood relative.<br /><br />And then we have the ludicrous and irrelevantadventure of Corrie Swanson taking on auto marketing industry. I think the inanity is exemplified by young Corrie and the son of the car dealer sharing a chuckle about her sharing a last name with the purveyor of TV dinners. Huh? Swanson suspended the sale of TV dinners decades before either of them were born. Why not joke about curb feelers or Spoolies? This entire diversion is just bad filler.<br /><br />At one time, Preston and Child crafted some of the most imaginative and carefully sculpted modern fiction on the market. One can only hope they return to what got them to where they are.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|If you had the chance to change history, would you? And would your new alternate reality actually be for the better or have unintended consequences?  That's the fun of time travel stories, and this is a good one, mainly because King creates great characters and is a great storyteller. I'm not a big King fan, but I couldn't put it down.....

B002JWD6AS|2.0|This book was written far better than Twilight but the two were so similar it was difficult for me to get through.
0312641893|5.0|I absolutely positutely loved this book! I decided to order this book on Amazon because of all the good reviews I had seen about it. I was also very intrigued when I learned that this story is a modern interpretation of &#34;Cinderella&#34;, although I must say it is probably more inspired by it than anything else because the story in itself is very unique and not like any other Cinderella adaptation I have read about or watched on film.<br /><br />I fell in love with the illustration on the dust jacket! I think that it was very ingenious for them to have chosen a shoe and the cyborish leg to represent the symbol for this book's cover. I also thought it was a very good idea for the author to have stayed with the name of Cinderella and just merely changed it to Cinder.<br /><br />When you flip through the pages in the book, you see that the author has divided it into four books and at the beginning of each one there is a passage from the original Cinderella story, giving you at the same time both an introduction of what the following chapters will be about and how they are related to some events in the original Cinderella story.<br /><br />As for the characters, my favorite character was of course Cinder. I think that Marissa Meyer did an amazing job creating such a kick ass personality. I enjoyed reading about Cinder because she was very different from the Cinderella from the classic story and from the main female characters in a lot of stories about princes and pricesses I have read about. With this I mean that the author did not aim to portray Cinder as an innocent little dove, who is waiting for prince charming to come rescue her from her evil stepmother who even though treats her cruelly she cannot help but treat with kindness by accepting her fate as a poor helpless victim. NO. This Cinderella or should I say &#34;Cinder&#34; is a real person, with real emotions, with imperfections and with feelings and thoughts that are not always very noble. I think my favorite part of the book was when I read about how Cinder could not help but feel envy from her stepsisters, even from the one that treated her with kindness. I found this so brilliant, because I think that nowadays authors are starting to realize that new generations of readers are more interested in relating to a character on a personal level, and being the human beings that we are, we are not perfect and our decisions and feelings and thoughts and what not are not always something to be proud of, so to paint this Cinderella or should I say Cinder, in such a realistic light, made me fall head over heels in love with her as a protoganist and character.<br /><br />The only thing I would change about the book would be in regards to the rest of the characters. I would have liked to know a little more about them. But of course it was her first novel and you cannot fit everything into one book so FIVE stars it is for this super duper great read. I would definitely recommend it to anyone and everyone, especially to girls and women who are or were in their young lives fans of Sailor Moon or Cinderella.<br /><br />Can't wait to read the sequel, Scarlet!
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|I like this show for the same reasons that I despise attorneys.  They're manipulative and I have a hard time trusting them.  (It is altogether too bad that I have many attorneys as clients hehe)  I never know what is going to happen next which keeps me watching.  Since I don't have TV, thankfully, I rent episodes on Amazon.  Win-win for all.

B003Y5H5FQ|5.0|Though this movie is still pricey (around 30-35 dollars brand new) if you own a 3D tv it's really worth biting the bullet and purchasing this movie. It's without a doubt one of the best uses of 3D i've seen in a movie and stands neck in neck with the 3D versions of Avatar,Titanic,and The Avengers. Just like the original this movie is fun,but still delivers the goods to be considered a genuine horror flick.<br />4 stars for the movie,and 5 stars for the 3d.

B006LSZECO|3.0|The writing style kept me glued to this novel. The ending left me in limbo, not the best way to end such a captivating detailed story.
B00BESIKWM|3.0|Way too much dialogue that wasn't relevant to the story. The first one was way better. The gore factor was still good.

B0097GVJWQ|5.0|I love the games like this one where you have to find items and whenever you think you've finished in one area you find that you need to return for something else. It keeps you on your toes and keeps your mind sharp. I loved the mystery aspect of it and the graphics and story were top notch. I play a lot of games put out by Big Fish Games and this is by far one of my favorites.

0525478817|4.0|I don't typically review books online, but I have some strong opinions about this one. I love to read YA from time to time and picked this up because I heard how amazing and hilarious and blah blah it is..and in a way, that's true. Many times I wanted to stop reading it, but kept on, and I'm very glad I did.<br /><br />The book contains a very interesting mixture of strengths and weaknesses. The harrowing portrayal of teens with cancer is the strongest aspect of the book - it is unsentimental, not cliched, and yet filled with pathos.  John Green deserves the highest praise for this difficult achievement. There are images, and descriptions of Hazel's feelings, that will haunt me for a long time. I spent the last third of the book in tears.<br /><br />At the same time, however...the characters are insufferable! They are the most pretentious, annoying YA characters I've ever encountered. It's not that \\"17 year olds don't talk like that\\", it's just that those who do tend to be very unpleasant people. I wonder if this was purposeful or if he was trying to appeal to a certain demographic? Today's hipster intellectual teenagers who know that life's just a big accident and so have to constantly deprecate themselves, and yet can't help faling in looove? Ugh.<br /><br />And yet...even as they annoyed me, I realized as the story went on that I had come to care for them greatly. We all share the same struggle to understand death, which is dealt with so well in this book. Interestingly, as the plot really gets going about halfway through the story, most of the flowery pretentious showoff nonsense banter is dropped, and you're left with a very moving story. There were some other rather uneven aspects of the book and the writing, but the strength of the story itself, and its well-formed confluence of first love, death, humor, etc. is more important. This book will stick with me.

The directing was great and the special effects were awesome.  I do not feel as though I wasted my time or money, but I would have appreciated a little more background on some of the characters.

B000YABIQ6|5.0|How can I hope to say anything which has not already been said about this AMC series in over 450 reviews. I can only add my personal reactions. I have been avoiding it for several seasons, since I found the relation between men and women quite disturbing, in spite of the fact that I lived through that early '60s era, but in a somewhat lower class family, where my mother worked in a factory and my father in the steel mills. I was also a bit turned off by the time spend in the bedroom rather than the board room. I loved \\"The West Wing\\" because, among other things, it demonstrated how power was far more exciting than sex, and I thought that the new series \\"Suits\\" did the same thing. But, after seeing none of my USA, TNT, and TBS series win any awards, and the AMC series raking them in like Hershey Kisses, I thought it was time to give this a try. A nudge from my Facebook friend Esther Schindler didn't hurt.<br /><br />So, I have discovered that the pace, the dialoge, the characters, and the situations, all framed with superior writing and good acting, really draws me into this world, in spite of its air of testosterone out of control, where the only thing the men want to do with all the women they meet is to get them into the sack. That's an exaggeration, of course, but it happens far more than most other series this side of Californication.<br /><br />If I had any complaints, it would be that there are very few really satisfying conclusions to the story arcs. One gets the feeling that the big climax will come with the series finale, similar to Josh Lyman and Donna Moss finally hooking up in the next to last episode of \\"The West Wing.\\" Closing deals with clients just doesn't give me a great deal of satisfaction. There are personal crises, but everything is so low key, one is reminded of how empty people's lives seemed to be before the great cultural revolution of 1964. On the bright side, I am positively looking forward to watching the next season to see how things work out.<br /><br />It's interesting to compare John Hamm with Gabriel Macht of \\"Suits\\". Both characters are eminantly skilled at their jobs, and comfortable in their own skins. But \\"Mad Men's\\" Don Draper is understated while \\"Suits\\" Harvey Specter is arrogant and just a bit blind to his weaknesses.k out.<br /><br />It's interesting to compare John Hamm with Gabriel Macht of \\"Suits\\".

1451695195|3.0|I believe in near-death experiences.  I know someone who had one.  No one needs to convince me that they are real.  I believe that Dr. Alexander did experience God and Heaven, and I found his visit to the next life extremely interesting.  I don't think, however, that such an experience can be proven scientifically, and my problem with the book is that the author believes that he did prove it.  He tells us that all consciousness comes from the neocortex of the brain, that his case of e coli meningitis caused his neocortex to shut down completely, and that therefore his brain could not have produced dreams or hallucinations that could have simulated such an experience.  But he never proves completely that his neocortex did shut down.  He tells us that his disease would have caused that, but he also tells us that everything about his illness was impossible--there's no way he could have contracted it, there's no way he could have survived it, and there's no way his brain could have recovered.  So maybe his neocortex didn't follow the protocols, either.  Our book club discussed this book at our February meeting, and two members who are nurses married to doctors wanted to know exactly what drugs he was on and they wanted to see his medical charts before they would accept his premise.  They felt that a lot of necessary information was missing.  I, on the other hand, was willing to accept on faith the supernatural and spiritual aspects of the story, but I too had a problem with the science.  I did, however, enjoy reading the book, and I liked learning about the author's perception of the next life.  I would recommend Proof of Heaven to those more interested in the Heaven than the proof.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|Excellent book which I would highly recommend for technology and business minded individuals who are looking for ways to make their products better for all of us.
1616550414|5.0|Just got it today and it's great. When i ordered it, I worried it would be hard cover with a jacket, but thankfully it didn't. Everything is on the hard cover. The pages are thick and vibrant. The text is crisp and easy to read. The short manga in the back was alright. Great art style, but the story was way too fast passed. Very happy to add this to the collection.
B00B5HQLMI|2.0|After hearing some of the comments about this movie, I was looking forward to seeing it.  However, I was very disappointed.  This seems to be a \\"PC\\" version<br />of the Bond Franchise. The new bond seems to be an aging washed up version of James Bond. The Bond women do not hold a candle to those cast in the past. I have seen better \\"love\\" scenes in soap operas. This Bond, for lack of a better a word, is a sissy.  Gone are the cool gadgets, cars, etc.  Is the next Bond going to be a woman? This looks like where the franchise is going. By the way, I am a woman and this fell flat for me. Sean Connery must be laughing somewhere at this farce. In addition, is Justin Bieber going to be the next Q?<br /><br />This is a sad statement to 50 years of Bond Films.

0061743526|2.0|As a non-native speaker, I had meant to read this book for years. I had very high expectations, but found myself utterly disappointed. I don't really understand why this book has become so famous. First, rather than being a story on racial discrimination and moral injustice in the South(as advertised on my edition of the book), it's really a sequence of different stories/events in the life of a 10 years old, that develops rather slowly. The title itself is little revealing. Even after who knows how many pages into the book, I did not fully grasp the main story line or point about the book - I kept on reading, hoping that it would eventually reveal itself, but it never did. Instead, it seems to be a loose narrative of different events in the life of a 10-years old , and none of the stories are really brought to an end or illuminated/analysed from a moral standpoint. Everything was just too obvious and cliche-ridden. Second, it was poorly written  and bar of any signs of great literature that would deserve the Pulitzer Price. Someone just please explain this to me.

El documental que trae con entrevistas a los músicos de como se hizo el album es excelente, este documental trae subtitulos en Ingles, Frances, Español, Italiano, Aleman, Portugues, Japones y Cantones. Este producto es 100% recomendable.

0812993357|3.0|Coddington's recent \\"fame\\" was the impetus for her putting pen to paper and writing an almost-autobiography about her life in the fashion business. The most interest chapters deal with her life as a model in London in the late 1950s and early 1960s, when there were only \\"models,\\" not \\"super models\\" or pseudo-celebrities whose only claim to fame was their ability to wear size 0 clothing. Her charming drawings are what elevates this book from two stars to three. Her narratives skips over people and facts as if they were outlet rejects, which leave some gaping holes in her story (e.g., is her mother dead or alive?) Coddington doesn't spare us the sad times of her life, but she relates them in a rather cool, detached manner that can be off-putting. My chief complaint about the book is that it's too darn heavy! It was published on very thick paper stock, similar to what is used for \\"coffee table\\" books - I had to read it propped up on a pillow for fear that if it fell forward it would break my nose!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I enjoyed the first Temple Run a lot. This one is even better! Just wish there were new characters and power ups.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Couldn't put it down.  I haven't read any books about the war, but reading the story from a sniper's perspective was intriguing, and it did not disappoint.  Well written.  I didn't realize it was the same person recently killed in a shooting range accident- my heart goes out to his family, he was a good man who sacrificed so much for our country.

B009RH9HDS|5.0|I bought my fiance a Kindle as a surprise, then let him pick out a cover as a treat to go with it. He settled on this one. And he is so very pleased with it. It looks really sharp. And it feels really sturdy and well made. He loves the ability so stand it vertically or horizontally in the cover. It is really easy to use. And the magnetic 'sleep' feature works great. He gets a lot of comments on it, and he loves showing it off- not only the Kindle, but the cover as well.<br /><br />He travels a lot, and keeps it in his backpack, and his Kindle has held up well. So has the cover.<br /><br />This product may seem a little pricier than some other versions, but so far, we think it is 100% worth it.

I loved this book and characters! It was not just the sex that makes this book great! I fell in love with Ana and Christian and their relationship!  The sex scenes are totally hot. The setting and theme is fantastic! Once you read the first you will def have to read them all!
B006LSZECO|3.0|I was torn by this story; throughout, I switched sides between Nick and Amy; then often, as the story progressed, I felt betrayed by both characters.<br />A lot of the time, I was frustrated by this couple, their choices and decisions about there marriage and their relationship to each other and each of their relationships with their other family members. Both Nick and Amy were very flawed individuals. And although the author tried to convince me that the two of them made each other better, I ended up hating both of them more than loving or sympathesizing with the individually.

B007J4T2G8|5.0|WOW CAN I SAY WOW !!!! Seriously my husband is going to get so lucky tonight and I plan to buy the next 2 books in this series for sure !!!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I absolutely love this trilogy of books.  Sure ... there are some really naughty parts, but MOST WOMEN fall in love with the \\"love story\\".  Christian is probably every woman's ideal man. And you have to love the way that Ana goes from being quiet and submissive ... to mature and able to hold her own.  Basically becoming the woman that  we would like to be.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|love it and every single detail of this third book of the series. I want my 50 shades of gray too just like every other woman that reads this book and then goes and gives her husband the night of his life !!! I'll use this book to light my fire over and over with no complaints from my man !!! LOLOL Seriously...go read it !!!!
B001KWTBVQ|5.0|I love this movie immensely!<br /><br />I have it as a VHS but I wanted in dvd because the dvds are better...
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|Love the wizard of Oz. A tried and true story that takes you into a land of make believe and has many fun twists and turns !!! Read the book !!! Its fun!!!
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I love this app because I can check out the weather if I am not at home or if I am planning a trip out of town I can see what it is going to be like.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|How great is it when a guy can buy an e-book and have it sent to his wife's tablet and shes says the story grabbed her right off. She's says it was a very nice story, that she enjoyed from start to finish.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love this app it is fun to go and get recipes or different ideas for outside or inside your home.

B004UID2LC|2.0|do not work often,started out great and that was the end of that,i was looking forward to enjoying this app
B009AMANBA|2.0|It seemed like a long, boring stage play to me.  I agree that a better title would be \\"The 13th Amendment\\" - an interesting part of history, but watching a group of men, talking in a dark room for over 2 hours, was a drain.  I also hated listening to Day-Lewis' Lincoln voice.  It sounded like he used Bill Clinton as a model.  Sally Field's acting was strained and weird.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I really like playing Mahjong. It helps me a lot because of my stroke. It helps me to remember things.
1616614609|5.0|This game never gets boring. You get to play as a runner and as a corp. So it's like two games in one. Also the deck building is so much fun. Instead of the cards playing you like many card games, you play the cards. At almost any time every card in your hand is a viable option, it's up to you and how you want to play. Also with having two decks in the one set, you can play with anyone, they don't need to already buy their own deck. I would say more about this game, but I got to go. Buy it!
B0063GORYU|5.0|Spider helped me out a great deal too. I had a severe stroke and it helped me out tremendously .
B00475AYJQ|5.0|Great stuff in here, never quite goes where I think its going. Cool magician origin story. Up there with the fantasy genres at the top.
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|My daughter and my grand son really enjoyed their selves while they played it. Andrea is 34 years old and she just loved it.
B0010SKUYM|5.0|Great stuff in here, never quite goes where I think its going. Cool magician origin story. Up there with the fantasy genres at the top. I hope he gets going fast on book 3!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Safe Haven starts out slow, but remains interesting. The ending is so unexpected and suspenseful. I would definitely recommend this book!
B0078X2LKY|5.0|i like this book but for the ipad its interactive. i have a samsung tablet and i was hoping it would be interactive also but it wasn't. i still like the book just wish it was interactive also becuase it was really neat. I wish there were more interactive ones.
0446580848|2.0|Nelson DeMille--who has not written a good book since &#34;The Charm School,&#34; or maybe &#34;InCountry,&#34; has done it again: not written a good book.<br />  The barely plausible plot, if you can call it a plot, is filled with detail and minutia that slows it down, along with a villain who, like his previous &#34;Lion,&#34; is so flat and undeveloped that to call him one-dimensional would be exaggerating to the upside.  Then there's the first person voice of John Corey...we know he must be funny because he keeps saying how funny he is throughout the book.  A few lines are laugh out loud, but mostly they are lame and  pretty stupid.<br />  But the biggest fault of &#34;The Panther&#34; is the didactic paragraphs of dialogue, in which DeMille dumps every piece of research he's ever read about Yemen, where the story is set.  But wait, it gets worse: his characters don't say more than a sentence or two without DeMille writing &#34;he explained to us&#34;...then two sentences later &#34;he further explained to us&#34;...then another sentence of dialog followed by &#34;he let us know&#34;....followed by &#34;he added&#34;....followed by &#34;he concluded&#34;....you get the idea.  DeMille doesn't do this once or twice, or ten times.  No, he does it consistently through the whole damn overlong book!<br />  Where are his editors, who he praises in the acknowledgements?  I wouldn't accept this kind of lazy writing from a high school student, let alone a best-selling author.  I loved all his early books, which were sensibly written.  Now he seems to dash off his novels with little regard for anything remotely resembling careful writing.<br />  I long for the DeMille of old, who gave us some wonderful novels.  Now all we get is &#34;The Lion,&#34; which was awful, and &#34;The Panther.&#34;  Maybe in his next book--what do you think, &#34;The Big Kitty with Stripes?&#34;--he will let the new laughable villain kill off John Corey, and that will be the end of him.  Then maybe we can get one more book out of DeMille like the ones he used to write.  We can only hope.be we can get one more book out of DeMille like the ones he used to write.  We can only hope.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game my cousin has this game and I liked it so I got it thinking that it wasn't gong to be as fun but it is.
B003VS0CX8|5.0|A lot of extra features make this blu-ray unique.  We especially enjoyed the subtitles permitting the whole family to sing along during our favorite songs.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|Love the extended version.  I get to create an extended version of my sleeping buddy.  Living in Miami, Fl I don't get many rainy days until summer.  This helps.
0307730697|4.0|The SEALS are the United States' elite military force. Those who enlist undergo intense training for their missions. SEAL Team SIX especially has received much attention after the raid which resulted in the death of Osama Bin Laden. But that is not their only story.<br /><br />Adam Brown was a member of SEAL Team SIX before the raid. He grew up as a young boy in Arkansas and was a person who never backed down. He's the kid who jumped off of roofs and who jumped off a bridge from a moving vehicle as a teenager. Adam was also the kid who refused to take off his life vest when boating with friends because he promised his parents he wouldn't. Loyalty was something Adam held close. But, as he grew older, that loyalty began to be overshadowed by darkness. He fell into the wrong crowd and his life spiraled in addiction, and then to jail.<br /><br />But this was not the end of the story. With help and encouragement, he began to heal, and he set his sights on the Navy SEALs. Adam's time in the SEALs is nothing short of amazing. He stood courageous in the face of many difficulties when others would give up.<br /><br />Fearless is the sort of book that looked easy to gloss over. At first I thought it was an attempt to capitalize on news reports of SEAL Team SIX. While the coverage probably will draw interest to Fearless, this story stands on his own. Adam's story is at times harrowing and at other times funny and thoughtful. Eric Blehm does not gloss over the troubles in Adam's life, and this makes the triumphs all the more wonderful and it makes the sorrows even more heartbreaking.<br /><br />4/5 stars<br /><br />I received this book free from WaterBrook Multnomah Publishing Group as part of their Blogging for Books program. I was not required to write a positive review. The opinions I have expressed are my own. I am disclosing this in accordance with the Federal Trade Commission's 16 CFR, Part 255
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|If this doesn't inspire you to serve God and others something is wrong and you should seek help!  I thank the Brown family for Adam's service and want to express my sorrow for their loss.  I'm praying God's comfort for your family.
B00AQMQBKK|4.0|This is an excellent game. Great replay value, as it's based on a cooperative board game (itself based on another cooperative board game, Arkham Horror).    The tutorial video and intro/epilogue videos won't play on the Kindle Fire first generation. However, this is for the best, as attempting to run the videos used to crash the game. It may also have caused my only \\"soft brick\\" of locking up the Kindle.    Much more stable now, and I purchased the expansions. Remember that the Lovecraft experience means the ancient horrors win more often than not.
B005LAIHZE|2.0|Really great vampire movie in 2013... i like the old civil war style, the clothes and the art the vampires act. The bad thing about it are the computer effects in some scenes which really look totally unrealistic. If you like this stile of vampire movies check out this [...]
B000NY12LO|5.0|I could not put this book down. I was glad the way she ended this story. You will not be disappointed.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|This book is a great read for anyone with a sense of humor. This book made me laugh so hard!
B00ANW33CM|1.0|I like Mahjong games but this one was very hard to see. Deleted it quickly! Maybe some would like it but I didn't.
B003G4W49C|5.0|A rather interesting look into a different future. I read it as a child and again a few weeks ago. Would definitely recommend it to young or old.

B008M721MS|1.0|I hate this app..it drops calls like crazy.. and i usually cant hear the other person..i am so fed up with this app
B009EEFTMC|5.0|I'm enjoying trying to beat my own score and keep my brain going identifiying the matching cubes.  For a faster challenge, try the game option where you have to eliminate the small cubes before they form the large cube. I forget what it's called. And of course, free is great.
B004SBS8LA|4.0|Like all of the angry birds games available this one is entertaining in saving other birds from the cages. Birds helping. Birds is always fun.
B0011Z31V8|4.0|I like to buy the 'best of' CD's. You get all the big hits in one place. This CD is no exception, all the big hits that played on the radio without all the other music in between. There are a few other Prince songs that I have purchased separately to complete my favorites.
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|Having adobe reader on my kindle firw has made easier to download and read Pdt files onthe go. With some features available such highlightening, commenting and other has made it more productive with all of the documents I have. I loveit.
B007B6VOG0|5.0|This album has so many different types of music, all done by one group. I like the hits that have been playing on the radio, but there are a few other tracks that I like even better. A good CD from beginning to end.

B007SNMVH2|5.0|Just as awesome as the other movies... and though I enjoy watching these movies, there may not be room for too many more.
B008LV8TSU|4.0|Howl's Moving Castle is hilarious while being deep and complex. It's truly children's literature at its best.<br /><br />While I was reading the book, I wondered how I would have reacted to it if I read it when younger. I'm quite certain I would have liked it, but the messages I took from it would have been very different. When I read it this time, fresh off a course on literature from the French enlightenment, I read it through the lens of \\"l'être ou le paraître\\". These words roughly translate to \\"essence\\" and \\"appearance.\\" French writers were obsessed with exploring what happened when someone's appearance did not match his or her being. In Howl's Moving Castle, Diana Wynne Jones is preoccupied with the same question. What is true? How we look? Or how we are inside? Although we're told from birth that it's \\"what's inside that counts,\\" it's a profound question, and I was surprised by how deeply Jones investigated this question under the guise of writing a flashy and fun children's book.<br /><br />The book resembles a fairytale, so I found some character motivations a bit weak. The villain of the novel is purely evil for evil's sake; unfortunately, there's not much complexity to her actions. I also became intermittently confused. The novel is frantic and hectic, which makes it difficult to follow occasionally.<br /><br />In spite of these reservations, I enjoyed Howl's Moving Castle immensely. Delightful characters, an inventive world, a surprising romance, charming humor, and an exploration of profound questions: this book has it all.
B007HJ84WS|4.0|Thought this would be in the realm of 300, but turned on too much of the cheese, but it was a good stuck at home movie for 5.00

B008Z9YGEE|3.0|Read the first book of this series and wanted to check out the movie, though I did not read the other books, and I may not see the other movies, it was good, but I think they could have done a few things better.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Fantastic app, really simple but brilliant at enabling you to keep track of your battery levels and charging time. Fantastic
B007R11PX6|5.0|Good movie for the family and for a light movie night with laughs and goofiness. Would recommend to anyone who wants to feel young again and enjoy themselves
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I love it!  Great series!  Excellent actors and actress' Gives a light of insight into the show and a different life
B008578PRK|1.0|I think I want me time back!! They could have done so much more the plot and concept of the movie, I kept waiting for him to pull out a wand and cast a spell and I have never really seen any of the wizard movies...
B008AK8FHM|5.0|This book answers so many questions and gives me so much hope.  Even being a &#34;believer&#34; has left many questions that this book has answered.  Thank you!
B009IEXKXI|5.0|This is what I like to see in my science fiction! Real science presented in an engaging and entertaining style.<br /><br />Mr. Weir, I look forward to your next novel.
B003ODIZL6|3.0|It's just a dictionary! There is nothing exceptionally wrong with it except for the fact that I can never get to the Z section. Does anyone know the word antidisestablishmentarianisim is in the dictionary? It would be ever so kind for you to reply! (Yes, I am British)
B00190OHD6|4.0|A little light, but delightful anyway. Hilary Swank is a great actress, although she seems a bit awkward as a love interest.<br />But the concept of the movie was fun, and the trips to Ireland were great.
B008CLI4N4|5.0|Loved it!<br /><br />The series stayed true to the books which is great (and was not always the case - think &#34;The Shining&#34;). The actors and actresses chosen matched well the characters in the books -  and in most cases they matched the images I had mentally created when reading the books. I can hardly wait for the second season (and the sixth book - which is still being written at this point).
B008DVJMAW|5.0|Great CD From one of next band to make it big ! Also buy there live CD and catch them on the road and you'll see what I mean.
B0087JTAKW|4.0|have read all of Mitch Albom books and have enjoyed all of them, this may be my favorite so far
B00846REIS|2.0|This book was ok but not nearly as good as 50 Shades.  I am still deciding on book 2 in the series.
B00A7ZWUJC|5.0|Very good. If you like rihanna you will more than likely enjoy this. A few good singles even if your not a huge fan. I did like some of her earlier cds a little more than this one but I will take it.
B004SRPXWQ|5.0|I got this app for my son who as soon has it on his iPod.  Their actions are funny and cute!

B008AIGWVA|5.0|I got this app for my son who loves it on his iPod too.  The actions are hilarious and he enjoys making the experiments.
B0082Z447U|4.0|Being so used to the flash novels that are written these days I wasn't prepared for the ongoing descriptive elements of the Victorian novel.  However I was hooked on the story line and needed to continue to find the resolution to the mystery.  Thank you Wilkie Collins for a clean and intriguing read.
B009EEFTMC|4.0|I find myself playing this game way too much. Always trying to beat my best time. It is a good matching game. I also play it with my kids. It is a really nice game.
B00AFEXRME|4.0|This movie contains Mr. Washington the movie star, and actor. My biggest complaint is I'd like to see more actor, less movie star. His body of film/movies audience a disparity regarding which is the purest film (s) that contain the marrow of his work.<br />FLIGHT is part action, relationship, and drama. All the parts perforate and come apart but Denzil in this movie blends the seams into a watchable viewing experience.The action is wonderful; the relationship aspects are a bit disjointed.<br />All in all I enjoyed this movie. One I rented to view, which demonstrated my chagrin to rush out when the movie first released. If you enjoy Denzil the actor you won't be disappointed, nor if you just like seeing him on the big screen.
B005LAIHXQ|5.0|To me this movie has an excellent sense of exploration and wonder.  It looks great, and there's enough action mixed with the mystery to keep things moving along.  Plus, you get the obligatory Alien corporate tool to provide a readymade villain.  Much goes unexplained, but so what?  The alien race has no desire or need to explain their motivations to us, so that's that.  Looks like it's headed for a sequel - or at least they set up the possibility.<br /><br />I enjoyed this movie quite a bit, and as it stands it's a good bookend to the Alien series.
B00AQ3K8IU|3.0|The characters are high school aged so it has a lot of teenage angst. If you are not a teenager or in your VERY early 20's I would not recommend this book. It's a little too emotionally young and drawn out for my liking.
B003VANOFY|4.0|Well after owning this headset for about a month I feel like I've gotten enough of a hang of it to be able to write a review.<br />Overall, I think they headset is great. It sounds great, the 7.1 (virtual) sounds amazing and all but there are a few gripes (albeit very minor ones).<br />Firstly: When you first turn on the headset you get a buzz for about 1-2 seconds. Just turn on the headset off your head and wait a second and it'll be fine.<br />Secondly: Sometimes even though the mic is in its upright &#34;muted&#34; position with the red light on it still picks up noise from around me. If I cough I can still hear it. (Ugh) although if you manually press the &#34;mute&#34; button it seems to go away.<br />Thirdly: The last gripe I have is the &#34;base&#34; or charging port. What is the deal with the &#34;dongle&#34; or USB bit that you have to plug into the top of the base? Why even have it? I haven't been able to plug it into my PC and have the headset connect so what is the point?<br />Anyway that is my take on the headset. Good sound, good feel, good construction, and even the software is okay...yet I still have those gripes. I have used the G35 (wired version) of this headset and haven't had the problems...yet I'd be tied to the computer. Oh also the G930's have a good range I'm able to walk around in my house getting excellent sound...Love that.
B00A6TYCNQ|1.0|how can you charge $6.99 for a game AND Still have in app purchases???  I understand the free ones ... they make their money that way.  this like the worst of both worlds!
B004ODLUF8|5.0|This video is about 1/2 &#34;guy&#34; stuff; technical issues in fixing the Hubble Telescope with a lot of interesting information on the space shuttle.

B000ICLRIE|3.0|A young blacksmith, Balian, is having some very heavy problems. One is his wife, while pregnant, has committed suicide. Another is that, according to the church's standards, because she committed suicide, she cannot have a proper, respectable burial. As such, he has been given a second chance at life- if he surrenders his life as a blacksmith to be a soldier in the Crusades to reclaim Jerusalem from the Muslims, alongside his father, who he had never really known in life. Furthermore, he becomes a Baron of France, where he came from. After getting shipwrecked and ending up on another land's shore, he ends up getting caught up in political scheming to make Jerusalem the central headquarters of their respective faith. What makes Balian unique among three different tribes of faith is that he lost his faith and has no real master. He just wanted to come to Jerusalem to seek forgiveness for his sins and that of his late wife. But problems arise, not just in the political arena, either, but also in the form of a new love life... with complications galore on the side of that as well.<br />The story alone has many facets and many layers that add to the story, even more so in this Director's Cut. And, while those layers are very intriguing and well-written for the screen, it does show a heavy bit of political correctness, in that it shows all faithful Christians to be either ignorant of pretty much everything or completely bloodlusting. Muslims, however, have more personality variety, making them seem more human than any given Crusader. Though the film does get a good chunk of history right, the politically correct filter of the story hinders it, keeping the enjoyment from being entirely there.<br />Still, there's always the very gory, octane-filled violence and epic warfare, along with the creativity of Balian's skills at engineering and being a tactician.<br />And it's not only the political correctness that bogs this Blu-Ray. Of any amount of special features there could've been on this Blu-Ray, there is only one- the theatrical trailer.<br />Still, this did turn out to be a pretty good historical war film from the great director of Gladiator, Blade Runner, Robin Hood, and the upcoming The Passage, so I can't complain too much.ve been on this Blu-Ray, there is only one- the theatrical trailer.<br />Still, this did turn out to be a pretty good historical war film from the great director of Gladiator, Blade Runner, Robin Hood, and the upcoming The Passage, so I can't complain too much.

B002MQYOFW|1.0|I cannot believe how bad this book was. It was so bad I had cried through the whole book. Bye
1938750977|5.0|I didn't realize this book was part of a series when I began reading it and now I will have to hunt down the series so I can read them as well. This book is the perfect length and grabbed me from the first page and held my attention throughout the entire story. The author of course left me hanging, which I both love and hate at the same time. This was definitely a good way to get into the series and I can't wait to read more from this author. There were a few grammatical errors, which always bother me, but other than that, I feel the story was well written and I enjoyed the characters. I am looking forward to reading more about these characters and will spread the word to my \\"reader friends\\" about this one.
B00AE2LJVS|5.0|For those who appreciate a bit of historical reference in their movie, this film is for you! Tom Hardy (Forrest) is quickly rising to become a favorite actor in my book. Great performance by all involved. I will definately watch it again.
B0042UGMYW|5.0|Even though the story really went nowhere but thanks to the medium / small part given to Augustus Prew it was worth seeing.<br />Efron is good but the story falls short with the girl Prew's movie girlfriend Cindy sets him up with.<br />We see 1 second of her I think, but the girl Efron wants reminded me of Jennifer Love Hewitt.

B009HQ9UHC|5.0|Super fun game! My 4 and 7 year olds love it. Great for them because it promotes problem solving! This game is worth downloading!
B004MC8CA2|4.0|This app was AMAZING up until a week or two ago. I've been using it for about 45 days, now it's constantly making me force close and saying it can't connect to the server. It's not my wifi because everything else works fine. I can only get a few pages of reading in at a time before it stops working. If this is looked into and fixed it's definitely a 5 star app. Love the ability to highlight and bookmark scripture, choose which Bible version I prefer to read and all the different devotionals and reading material is outstanding. Just wish I could use it.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Fun game, my 7 year old loves it, as well as my 13 year old (they enjoy it more than &#34;Angry Birds&#34;, and &#34;Angry Birds&#34; is one of their favorite games). Great for parents too! Easy to download, easy to get started, addictive once you start playing. Soooo worth getting!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|My four year old son and I love playing this game together. One warning: it's slightly addictive and postpones bedtime periodically.<br /><br />Thanks!
B00A31UXLW|5.0|As always a great read - Michael Connelly never fails to deliver the goods.  Harry Bosch is such a great character
030758836X|5.0|When it comes to novels,  I think that we as readers generally believe that we can trust the narrator. We may see the narrator lie to others within the novel, but I think that generally, we know that they're telling the truth to us, because we're the chosen few who get a glimpse of what's going on in that particular character's head.<br /><br />That said, within the first few chapters of Gone Girl (which is told alternating between Nick and Amy as narrator), it becomes obvious that either one or both of the narrators are lying to us. Or at the very least, they're not telling us the complete truth. It shortly becomes obvious that small lies are building and building--but to what end?<br /><br />In the heart-racing second act of the book, we find out just how extensively we've been lied to, and a whole new world of possibility about Amy's disappearance opens up. And let me tell you, it's a doozy. It sort of feels like a descent into madness, as we begin to question everything we know as a reader, because even after we know the WHO, we don't quite yet know the WHY. That is, until Gone Girl moves into the skin-crawling third and final act, in which the reason behind it all is revealed...and it's even more creepy than I ever could have imagined.<br /><br />Gillian Flynn was an author who was not at all on my radar before...but she certainly is now! It's been a long, long, long time since I felt so genuinely surprised by a book. Since I had no idea what to expect or what could possibly be coming next. I'm not sure I've EVER been as severely creeped out while reading a novel as I was when I came to the final pages of Gone Girl...and although it seems strange to wholeheartedly recommend a book for being creepy, I absolutely am. It's indescribable, and you just simply must read it now.
1476719071|5.0|I absolutely LOVED this beautiful, emotional roller coaster of a story! A must read for absolutely everyone! You won't be disappointed!
B00BB8RKH6|5.0|Denzel Washington is a wonderful actor and this performance is no less than excellent.John Goodman was fantastic in his character role. Very good surprising twists in the story line. Just a really good movie for movie buffs.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|ABSOLUTELY FREAKING FANTASTIC!! IF YOU HAVEN'T READ THIS BOOK -  PLEASE DO IT NOW!<br /><br />EVERYTHING COLLEEN HOOVER WRITES IS GOLD!!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|OMG.... I really liked this whole trilogy, wish it could of went on longer. Will be looking forward to seeing anything else from her.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|This is a &#34;quick read&#34; and not at all complicated story.  I could envision each scene as if it were a movie.  I would recommend this as I would all the Grisham books I have read.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|It was so good. I wish the series wasn't over. I want it to keep going. These are all great books.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|I enjoyed reading this wonderful  book. I have referred it to several friends.  A must read... Waiting on the movie!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Period, drawing room drama that always leaves you wanting more.  I cannot wait to see what happens in the next season.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Great love story. As expected Nicholas Sparks had me crying again...  I love his writing style. So easy to read and read fast because I can never put down his books until the end.
B002BWP49M|4.0|I've been a follower of the Twilight saga (books and film), and I believe this to be the best of the movies.
B00007E8V4|5.0|What can I say? I just love System. I'm not a big music critic so you won't find this comment very useful. I just love their lyrics and their music.
B00AAQRNQ8|4.0|My only complaint with this mouse is the smoothness of some of the surfaces. I find that my ring finger and pinky on my right hand tend to slowly slip out of position. My old mouse was much easier to grip so that is the first thing I noticed. This mouse would benefit from a more textured, rubberized surface. It is not enough to make me want to return the mouse, but I would not buy it again for that reason.
B009GEYX5E|1.0|Basically expired. Received on 2/18/13 with date of production 2/2012, with box stating \\"Best within 12 months of production date\\". I would have sent it back but I wanted to try it first. Pictures took longer than one hour to develop, mediocre \\"instant\\" results.<br /><br />Bad business to send out film that is on the verge of expiring. And if it's not expired, then it's just bad film. Don't buy unless you want to throw money away.
B007L6VR12|2.0|Moonrise Kingdom is a movie where none of the characters begins to come to life, save for a understated performance by Bruce Willis (of all people). The film is set on a small wooded island off the U.S. east coast in the 1960s where a troubled 12-year-old Boy Scout runs away from camp and elopes with a deeply disturbed 12-year-old girl. Various other scouts and assorted adults give chase. Everyone speaks in a stilted way and the children fire off shots of dialogue that are supposed to be clever but instead are just confusing, so rather than watching the movie (which I'll say is beautifully shot) unfold you're scratching your head and saying \\"What did that mean?\\" The adults tend to show off too and come out with lines that make no sense. The fundamental problem is that Moonrise Kingdom can't decide whether it's a romance or a comedy or a satire and veers in and out of each form, making it very hard to follow. Bruce Willis is good, though, as a sad policeman who's rather had the life crushed out of him.
B0071BGOJC|5.0|I could not put it down . It is a 'must'for those who enjoy historical novels . Looking forward to the next one .
B001TCHDPS|4.0|After watching Searching for Sugarman, I bought Cold Fact and Coming from Reality and started to listen to the albums in chronological order. I thought Cold Fact was so disappointing (see my separate review) that I didn't bother to even take the wrapping off Coming from Reality. After a few weeks I reluctantly decided to listen just once - I'd spent money on it  after all - and was soon struck by how much better the songs are than those on Cold Fact. And when I say better, I mean better written, better composed, better recorded. It's nowhere near as dated as Cold Fact and there a few classic tracks which could have been issued yesterday, such is their freshness and relevance. The CD is worth it for one song along, the brutally eloquent \\"Cause\\", and also contains an excellent re-recording of \\"I'll Slip Away\\", his first ever single, which came out in 1967.
0525950079|5.0|Another great addition to Ken Follet book lovers.  He hooks you in from the very beginning.  A book hard to put down.
B000GCFG7E|5.0|Great book. I love the Reacher books. Why anyone would EVER think Tom Cruise could be  Reacher is beyond me. I am boycotting the movie on principle as are all the Reacher fans I know. One comment to the author- you should not use \\"miles\\" in Great Britain. Especially not by the locals.
B00B5HQKNI|4.0|Unexpected finally, you never think about Bond's past, or what or of his emotions when things don't go as planned.<br />And it reflect a more realistic view of the state of the wordl's security
B00A2H9LK6|1.0|From the outset, this movie is absolutely baffling. The only revelation in this film is that you've wasted an hour and a half of your life with nothing to show for it. The acting was garbage, the story was utterly confusing, the only ONLY thing that was remotely interesting were the sets. The set designer did a great job, the rest of the cast and crew should be summarily executed.<br />I guess maybe if you've played all the games and watched all the previous movies, this might make some sense. There was a lot of talk about an old god coming back and something about needing blood and a body for its reincarnation. Even with the staggering amounts of exposition, I still couldn't figure out what was going on. The final fight sequence made no sense to the point where you weren't sure what demonic creature you wanted to win and why it made any difference at all.<br /><br />AVOID, if at all possible.
1579128955|5.0|I bought this for my daughter who is homeschooled.  We love this book!  It's colorful and informative!  It gives great information and explains everything clearly!  We love the descriptions and the visual examples of each element (where able).  It also lists what the elements are used to make, etc.<br /><br />My daughter loves to pick this up on her own as well!  She's 10 and we'll be getting lots of use out of this book - HIGHLY recommended for all homeschooled kids :)
B002PLALCO|5.0|Video quality is not as good as Palladia TV (VH1) (could be my equipment) Really worth having without the commercials,and you get more tracks!
B0011UJMK2|5.0|I found this book to be difficult to read in some places but I could not pt it down. The author has done a great deal of research to reflect what Russia is all about. The story line is very well crafted and reflect the times accurately in all of the distressing, brutal facts of life under Stalin&#34;s bloodthirsty reign of terror. I found myself engrossed by the story and the message it brings to us as  citizens in the &#34;free world&#34; . Do yourself a favor... Read this book.<br /><br />Wayne
B004LROUNG|4.0|I enjoyed this book as I have others by Grisham. It was a quick read and held my interest throughout.
B004SRNH10|5.0|I needed this app to run something else I downloaded.  Seems to work like it should, with no problems noted.
B0083NMH9I|1.0|This is not vinyl.  It's a CD.  How do I know this?  Because like a fool I bought it.  When I bought it, it described it as vinyl, only played once etc, but when I received it, it was a cd.  Clerical error?  Maybe.
B004SBS8LA|3.0|This seems to be a free demo only.  To get the full game, you have to fork over some money.
B00A31UXLW|4.0|As with all of Michael Connelly's books, they are well written, researched and interesting.  Whilst The Black Box was a little slow in the beginning, it built to a crescendo and then became one of those books that you just had to know what was going to happen next.  The Black Box was certainly good enough to keep me reading late into the night, but probably not Connelly's best ever book.  Still, well worth the read and highly recommended.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|The book was incredible. I finished  it in four hours and immediately went to go watch the movie which was also pretty great. I highly recommend it to  anyone who feels like an outsider so they can know that there is always people out there  that are just like you.
034580404X|5.0|Bought this for someone with a kindle that wanted the paper back! Paid $4.99 for the set.  Best price ever!
B007B6VOG0|5.0|With all respect for FUN, this album is very close and<br />Queen-like in the highest sense of acclamations. Queen<br />is one one of the top bands of all time, and FUN. is approaching<br />that level with \\"Some Nights.\\"<br /><br />This from a 58+ yr old without social media<br />usage, but a new and HUGE fan of FUN.<br />Love it, especially \\"Some Nights,\\" \\"Carry On,\\" and \\"We Are Young.\\"<br />I highly recommend this CD. I just ordered \\"Aim and Ignite\\" and it is due for<br />delivery today.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Amazing series! The ending will keep you craving more! The fifty shades book gives  the term \\"fairytale\\" a whole different meaning!
B008673ZAQ|5.0|can't wait to read the next book and find out what is eating at Gideon.  hoping it is not going to be the same as 50 shades.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I love Nicholas Sparks' books.  Safe Haven got your attention right away.  The ending was a surprise in regard to  Katie's neighbor.  Can't wait to see the movie.
B00846REIS|5.0|something like 50 shades, but not really.  i like how the book is going so far, going to read the next one.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I have read almost all of Grisham's books and this one is one of his best.  You got into the story immediately.  Read it in about 2 days.
0802473156|5.0|Great book, easy to read and understand, and was very helpful for my relationship with my wife.  We already had a strong marriage, but this book helped strengthen it further!
B008ETOSYI|5.0|Zac is all grown up, He did a great job of acting the part of a marine back from war....and the mental issues and then a great love, good job....
B001VIMCW4|4.0|I do prefer Casino over this one, but, I felt this story needed to be told in order to complete the story that began in Casino. If you like action this movie has it. Acting is great. Villain is just sub par.
B00A7CI82I|5.0|i just really like this film, it has everything..This sequel did an excellent job of carrying on the legacy. Jeremy did a fantastic job and because of that I am a fan of his
B003TNQEF0|4.0|Though the acting can be cliche at times and the CG is dated, The Mist is by far one of the better horror films that touches on the curious questioning from H.P. Lovecraft's night terrors. The movie itself was entertaining to watch and the end is...prefect.
B007IK44CK|5.0|Loved it, Tom and Jeremy were excellent and the plot was excellent and suspenceful.  I watched several times and still fond of it.
B00005JKZV|5.0|Glad my LOTR Trilogy is finally complete :-) With all of the Blockbusters closing it was hard to get ahold of
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I was a latecomer to this series. A friend recommended it to me. Needless to say, I watched seasons 1 & 2 in one week! Season 3 I purchased from Amazon. The show is awesome. The characters, settings and writing are fantastic. I totally recommend it to someone looking for a smart, classy show!
B000FCKIFU|4.0|I had read other Baldacci novels tha made reference to the Camel Club.  When I came across the Camel Club, I decided to buy it.  It was good  in and of itself, but it gave a background of the early days of the club.  However, I believe the characters have matured in subsequent novels.
B004AQR24W|5.0|Stallone brings back all the big bangs and action heroes we've all grown to love.  The story is ok but the action is excellent!
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|An excellent read.  Continuous action with sub-plots within the major plots.  You can imagine the plots as realistic.<br />Anyone who likes Griffen, Baldacci, and Ludlum novels should like Threat Vector
B009MJUCM6|5.0|This seal looks so realistic. It is good quality material. My granddaughter just loves it. I also got her the white baby seal for her animal collection. Both granddaughters have quite a collection of Schleich animals. They play with them all and have asked for the FAIRIES for Easter!
0865479410|5.0|In this book, Oliver Burkeman Makes the case that the traditional ways of seeking happiness actually tend to backfire and offers counterintuitive alternatives.  For example, affirmations don't work becuase they simultaneously evoke subconciously the emotion that is meant to be suppressed.  Saying over and over \\"I am strong\\" induces the mind to search for the truth (\\"No I'm not.)  Burkeman makes the case as well that if self-help books worked, there would not be so many of them coming out, year after year.  Burkeman offers counterintuitive alternatives like, for example, taking the approach of the Stoics by meditationg on death and learning (ironically) to live with it and appreciate life more. Another suggestion is focusing on the present and removing regrets about the past and worries about the future.  For each if his prescriptions, Burkeman visits experts or communities which reflect the specific teaching: Eckhrat Tolle on being in the now; Mexican Day of the Dead Celebrations on memento mori; a poor African neighborhood in Kenya on being happy without great wealth.  If you've tried the traditional suggested route to happiness and that hasn't worked, you may want to give this book a shot.
B000YDE4AU|4.0|Great pair of boots. Not like regular Timb's where you cant move in them cuz the are like cement blocks these have the lightness and give to let you move if you have to.
B007TXN4TK|1.0|Tis is too difficult to just enjoy casuall playing around with.  I have deleted it from my apps on my tablet.
B000JMKTLO|4.0|I bought this book after reading Dark Places, and just like with that story, I had a hard time putting down my Kindle.  The story had me guessing who the killer was.  You had an idea, but knew this author had some twists and turns up her sleeve.  Can't wait for my next conquest of Gone Girl.  I would recommend anything written by Gillian Flynn!
B00AF7Z44K|4.0|Why is the price of this keep going up? With time is should go down don't you all think so!!
B004KKX80A|5.0|THIS IS A PRODUCT THAT I COULDN'T FIND AT THE STORE. HE HAS HAD A GREAT TIME WITH IT. VERY UNIQUE BEYBLADE.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|Great science-based science fiction A ND hilarious at the same time.  God, this book was refreshining.  I immediately searched for other works by this author--I would by anything and everything written by him but this is his first novel.  Can hardly wait for the next work.<br /><br />Concept was original.  Science-based without being science-boring.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This is an amazing tale and is my all-time favorite. It has everything that 1000 books have in 1 book
B006LRUVUA|5.0|I've only tried this on Wifi but so far it's excellent.  The controls are surprisingly intuitive.  This is the only screen sharing program that works well at allowing you to control another screen.  Join.me is very good but it doesn't let a mobile user control remotely.
B00280LYIC|5.0|This book was way better than the movie.  Lots of details given.  Exciting book that teaches you a lot about Greek mythology.
B007KDFWRG|5.0|The tastiest blues I have heard in a long time. These two combine for a mad set of chops. I like the way they can take a tired old tune that is out of circulation and make it alive again.
B006ZDS7CE|5.0|I bought it here because it was cheaper than on ITunes. I love Lana. She is my queen. I know she's not for everybody, but hey, to each his/her own.
0887307280|5.0|This is one of the best books ever written for small business. It actually a very easy read, because the author tells a story to get his point across. And the point is vital, it just makes sense. This is one of my all time favorite. Buy, borrow, go to the library. Just read it.
B0011UJMK2|3.0|Child 44 is a well-written book that although has horrible events throughout, pulls you in to continue reading it. Riveting.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love, love, love this site. I have learned so many neat things and am learning how to explore and &#34;Pin&#34; my own things.  A great resource for many topics.
B008ACC9CM|5.0|I've been hooked on these two since I first saw them. Just bought the CD and while the voices are definitely worthy of a 5 star ranking I too was disappointed in the production quality. While it's not always glaring on some numbers there is a noise or an instrument that you can't identify. If you're just listening casually you may not notice it but something in the back of your mind says it's not right. The music on Jackie Evancho's CD for Syco wasn't as good as her first one. I'd like to have them brought over here to the states and put them with David Foster for an album. Evidence the Jackie Evancho Dream With Me CD. Every number was perfection. I don't believe Simon works with the singers the way David Foster does.<br />Having said all this I'm still glad to have purchased the CD and will continue to enjoy it. Jonathon's voice sets him apart from every other young male singer with one word...talent. What other young star can stand at a microphone, just sing and bring an audience to it's feet? I love listening to Charlotte's voice. It has a crystal clear quality to it that i would compare to well tuned bells or chimes. I'll take her on The Prayer over Celine any day.<br />Accept a little \\"offness\\", if I can coin a word, in the sound quality and still go out and buy this CD. Having their voices to listen to overcomes any technical shortcomings.
B005LAII8K|5.0|I wasnt super interested in this film until the husband mentioned wanting to see it. I thought it was awesome. Great concept & exceptional acting on Joseph Gordon Levitt's part. I could take or leave Bruce Willis, but I havent enjoyed much of what he's done since the 5th Element (MULTIPASS). Thumbs Up.
B0097HSS4M|5.0|It's pretty simple I injoy useing it.I would recommend it to everyone who wants to have fun with there photos
B002XXLKHY|5.0|Sweet, and goofy. Zooey Deschanel lets us hear her voice (hurrah!) A nice tale of renewing Christmas spirit, and although I'm not a Ferrell fan, he is pretty spot-on with the silly elf thing, only annoying occasionally. Kids will love it, Santa, elves, reindeer, and some story. And Bob Newhart, a classic.
B009JZTOG8|5.0|This series will die if they keep waffling with the characters...some unexpected evil is all right...but we like to think that even characters with magical powers can change for the better.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Very useful free app which indicates the amount of charge every time I switch on. Useful to have indication of time left for each type of usage
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|It was a great read this is my second time and I just hope when they film it they do its justice.
0316776963|5.0|to my library - inexpensive and a hardback, too - look forward to reading more of the stories - cupcake
0140544518|5.0|Check out the DVD too.<br />This (I believe) was the first kids book to tell a story from the other person's view.<br />Now there are a whole bunch of similar children's stores re-told in the same way.<br /><br />This book is great, and the DVD is great too.<br />My kids (4 & 5) love it.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I absolutely loved this book. Couldn't put it down. The emotion and suspense of the Christian character had me hooked. Cannot wait to see how a movie of this plays out. Hope it's just like what read.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Fun game. Easy to play. Hard to put down. Good way to pass the time. Some levels are frustrating but you don't want everything too easy.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|What a fantastic book about a great soldier, husband, father and so much more! Thank you to all of our servicemen and women for all you do. This book is definitely worth the read!!
B000002OCP|1.0|Awful record. It's just not strong. The strength of muddy waters work is undermined and diluted by some really awful guitar work. It's just inappropriate. Blues with a feeling it ain't. It's like the guys with the guitars were at a different session. The guitar sounds totally unrelated to Muddy's vocal delivery, or the tension of the song. I don't even think its an album really. It's apparently a big influential record for the black keys. Sheesh! Really? I think they are much better than anything on this record.<br />I love blues. I love psych rock. This is neither. It's like muddy waters in one room and a mad river record playing in the other room and you're in a room between going crazy.
B00A7ZWUJC|4.0|I bought this for 1 song (diamonds) and it turned out to be a pretty good CD. I am definitely a rocker but like a few R&B songs. I will listen t it a few more time to see if any more or all of the songs grow on me.
B008KW43TE|5.0|I bought this album after watching \\"Forrest Gump\\" performed at the Grammys and I havent put it down since. I have been enjoying the aural soundscapes that Frank Ocean and company paint, especially \\"Pyramids.\\" Every morning I throw it on on the way to work and on the way back home. The album is on repeat and it feels new and fresh. I think this is just the beginning of a great career, I am chomping on the bit to get more Frank Ocean.
B008FTAAG2|4.0|I really think this record rocks! So far W****e is still my favorite but I listen to it at least once a week. We'll see how it holds up but it rocks really hard!
B009Y6OIWC|5.0|My wife needed this as it was recommended to allow syncing of gmail contacts, calendar, email between google gmail and android smartphone. Great product for android smartphone.
B002ZMZBD2|5.0|love the music and the sound quality. helps if you have a good bass. listen to this cd so much i may need to get a replacement for all the wear and tear that's inevitable.
B009RI4FRU|5.0|I am a total sucker for romantic comedies about kids, as well as coming-of-age flicks. _Moonrise Kingdom_ is one of the best. Acting is excellent all-around. You never quite know what is going to happen next. As one other reviewer said, it almost seems like it was made by kids. It's fun and takes you back to a time when everything seemed simple. My cynicism falls when I watch this movie.<br /><br />At the same time, it shows just how powerful and vulnerable humans can be. It will make you cry. There are wonderful, heartfelt conversations between all the characters in _Moonrise Kingdom_.<br /><br />It's also just plain beautiful. The background music and the scenery (nature shots) are just plain spectacular. It's all mixed in well with a great story. _Moonrise Kingdom_ uses music very well, and it creates the experience.<br /><br />Summing it up, if you have lost all hope of finding love, _Moonrise Kingdom_ will make you believe again. Never have I rooted harder for a couple than I have rooted for Sam and Suzy.
B0017I1FP8|5.0|family is a hans zimmer fan, and we all enjoy listening to this cd. we'll even blare it on the stereo at home.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|For anyone who is an aviation and WW II buff, this is an outstanding book in which you get both sides of the war with Germany. Since it is a biography of both men, you get the true story. Outstanding !!
B009E3EY38|5.0|That is of course is a quote from Shakespeare's As You Like It.<br />And, I like it, and I have wasted my time in it.<br />And I'm about to waste some of your time to tell you a brief story, that is if you stay to read this.<br /><br />A couple years ago I sprained my ankle very badly. My right foot swelled up to the size of a football, I didn't know if I would ever walk again. For all intends and purposes I was home bound with a lot of time on my hands. For extra added fun I had no computer. One day when I was at my parents house I said to myself, \\"I know, I'm going to find out if the Led Zeppelin reunion concert is out on DVD.\\" I couldn't find any information on the matter. I then said, \\"I know, I'll go to that Led Zeppelin web site. If anyone knows if that concert is out on DVD it's those people. They're like Trekkies. They know what each of their mothers ate for dinner the night they were conceived.\\"<br /><br />So off I went to the site. But where to ask this question? What thread should I enter? I saw one that said Led Zeppelin movie. Maybe it's in there.<br />Nope, not there. That was a thread about the merits of a Led Zeppelin bio-pic. Some of the people said a lot of silly things like, \\"It wouldn't be any good unless the guys were in it.\\" I along with a couple other people voiced the ridiculousness of 60 year old men playing 20 year olds. Nevertheless I asked my question about the availability of a DVD of the concert, as well as putting in my own thoughts on a Led Zeppelin bio-pic. I got an answer to my DVD question but also flak for what I wrote about the bio-pic. Instead of arguing, as well as to illustrate the stupidity of the guys in led Zeppelin playing themselves as 20 year olds, I came up with the idea of a short story. A story in which John Paul Jones has a DeLorean time machine he bought from Brian Setzer, which he got in lieu of money for being in La Bamba. And the guys use it to go back in time to save save John, Karac, Stevie Ray Vaughan, Eric Clapton's son, stop 9/11 from happening and, of course to kidnap themselves so they, as young guys could be in the bio-pic movie.<br />It would be Led Zeppelin meets Quantum Leap.<br />Alas I only have the first chapter done.<br />What can I say, free time, pain killers, and a desire to have the guys in my life for a brief time since I couldn't see the concert. I've never seen Led Zeppelin live, which is a story for some other time.<br /><br />I've waited and anticipated this DVD like everyone else. It's the only thing I wanted for Christmas and I got it.<br /><br />As a precursor before I watched it I watched everything I have on disc, Earl's Court, The Led Zeppelin double DVD with The Royal Albert Hall show, and Knebworth. After each viewing of these concerts I was left with a glow. Knebworth left me with other feelings too, but when Jimmy smiles and bows his head, I just glow. I wanted to glow, and smile.<br />And I did.<br />The guys did not disappoint.<br />An interesting thing occurs when you do that.<br />You see the beginning in Albert Hall, the very peak of themselves in Earl's Court, the end of it all in Knebworth, and the flight of the Phoenix in this performance.<br />After all the others, as you are watching this, all of the constants come to the fore and illuminate the screen. That's all you see for a time.<br />You can see the paper trail of their lives in music.<br />Maybe that is a question I wanted answered in this DVD. Would they be be themselves, or some other band, or just a mere shadow of themselves?<br />The answer was,<br />To thine own self be true.<br />True Led Zeppelin.<br /><br />The best part of the show and maybe the most poignant is, at the end I didn't get the impression they were spent. They all looked like they could have done another hour.<br /><br />But, do I have issues?<br />Yes.<br />I did not care for the editing one bit, I did not care for the \\"special effects.\\" I would have preferred the personal intimate experience you havewith the other concerts. When John Paul Jones is playing No Quarter I don't need to see his feet. It's like the editor said, \\"Wow John is wearing cowboy boots and they look like really good ones too lets get a shot of that. No not while he's walking on stage when he's soloing in No Quarter.\\"<br />And if that wasn't bad enough, to rub salt in the wound they did it again as if to say, \\"Look he's still got them on, people will love this.\\"<br />Well I didn't love that, I did not appreciate it one bit.<br />I wanted the guys in my room with me. Except for brief moments that broke through the confines of time and technology with this DVD they stay up there on stage, in the TV.<br />It was the editor's fault.<br />I also was looking to see maybe a documentary special feature about the concert, how it all came about and was pulled together. Maybe something about Ahmet and his foundation, and the relationship between him and the guys. There is none of that, just the concert.<br />And the Stairway To Heaven solo could have been rethought.<br /><br />But as for the guys I repeat...<br />\\"I like this place and could willingly waste my time in it.\\"<br />And if there is more to come from them I'll add this quote too,<br />\\"If music be the food of love, play on.\\"
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Loved it. Nicholas sparks is an amazing writer. Have never read a bad book of his. I wanted more. Highly recommend
B003VANOFY|2.0|PROS:<br />- The sound quality is good. For the price I got it at, I was actually somewhat surprised by how good it sounded.<br />- Feels good to wear. I've had several pairs of headphones before that I simply can't wear for longer than an hour because it physically hurts. I had no problems with these; they felt great.<br />- Buttons. Really nice to have a volume wheel and a mic mute button on the headset. I only used the three macro keys for media, never tried them in games.<br /><br />CONS:<br />- Mic weirdness. The mic has an auto-mute feature that is supposed to turn itself off when it's in the upright position, but I found that it had trouble figuring out where it was-- sometimes it wouldn't turn off, sometimes it would turn itself back on at random times.<br />- Connection Issues. THIS IS A BIG WARNING! After about a month or two of ownership the headset started having connection problems. The audio cuts out every so often (I've found it gets worse over time, but fluctuates greatly from day-to-day). The problem is with the USB dongle; you can see the light flick off every so often, wait for a few seconds, then flick back on. It's extremely annoying, and I wouldn't buy another one simply because of this. Lots of people are having this problem, with many claiming different causes. Some are saying the firmware is bad, some are saying it's the wireless frequency getting interference, but whatever it is, it's a deal breaker. I've contacted Logitech, and am waiting a response. Generally people have been able to get theirs replaced without issue, but just be warned that there is a problem out there.<br /><br />2 stars because when it was working, it worked great. If I can get a replacement from logitech that doesn't have the same problem, I will bump it up to 5.
B008XG1X18|5.0|its a visually appealing research tool! it makes for fun discovery. learning. and play and never gets tired. I like the fact that you assemble a community of otherwise strangers around a single idea or creation. I love pinterest.
B00APUYWYA|1.0|This was the first time I used Amazon Prime's video stream and it was very disappointing! We were very excited for the movie,and loved what we were able to watch. Halfway through it just froze, and wouldn't restart after restarting the computer. I only purchased the Prime membership for the free shipping, and thought this would be a nice way to get full value for it, I was definitely wrong about that!
B000W9EOEC|5.0|A great CD with mixed house music, included fans energy. No more words to describe this cd, created by a great artists of synthethizers.
B007BVMVDU|5.0|Love this series as it follows the books pretty closely.  That is always my biggest complaint with any book adaptation but this one does not disappoint in that department. Just wish I could get the second season already.
B003MC5N28|4.0|I would give the book like a 9 because it is like a saga of  books well it is but this is a different kind of text that is hard to understand. I would pick this book for like a project because it is kinda hard to understand. You have to pay close attention to the novel to get a feeling of it in order to understand it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I'm addicted to this game because it's fun but more because I keep messing up and I want to get further
B004LP3AYI|4.0|I recognized the name Terry Goodkind.  I have read some of his books.  Although I loved the story, poor editing made for a very rough read.
B0084AZXKK|5.0|A rip-roaring tale of buried treasure, cutlasses, cannons, uneasy alliances, double and triple crosses and of course parrots and peg-legs(or a crutch at least).
B00000JFV9|5.0|Everything was excellent! They sent the right merchandise out immediately and it was in as they described it. Beautiful Job guys.
B007BFSYMS|5.0|Great, unobtrusive app that does its job well. Has plenty of sounds to choose from, and being able to have it running with other apps via the paid version is excellent.
B001S86J0I|5.0|I grew up on this movie and it reminds me of my dad and growing up. plus it is freakin funny
B004Q7CIFI|5.0|Stephen King has delivered another gem almost as great as &#34;The Stand&#34;,  and as imaginative and filled with human interest as, &#34;Under The Dome&#34;.  This is a must read for all history and sci-fi aficionados!  Hard to put down, and devastating to be over!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I always love the details that pull you into Spark's books.  He uses your senses to get to your heart.
B002N44XSG|5.0|This book gives many interesting stories and very fun facts that contributes to the book's plot. I love this book!

B00AHTYGRW|4.0|I remember a ranking list from The Onion's AV Club from several months back about which films of 2012 have the best chance to win the Academy Award for Best Picture. One of the main reasons they felt that ARGO was one of the strongest picks (the strongest being LINCOLN, at that time) was that film award voters have a lot of love for a filmmaker who came up through The System. If you recall, Robert Redford's very good directorial debut ORDINARY PEOPLE beat out better films in 1980 (the most memorable being Martin Scorsese's brilliant RAGING BULL) and the same thing happened again in 1990 with Kevin Costner's excellent directorial debut DANCES WITH WOLVES beating out Scorsese once again in his genre-defining GOODFELLAS. And it's beginning to look more and more like Ben Affleck's ARGO is the film to beat this year at the Oscars, despite Affleck himself not being nominated for Best Director, and there being superior films nominated once again (ZERO DARK THIRTY, DJANGO UNCHAINED to name the other nominated films that are superior that I've seen). Don't get me wrong; ARGO is a very good film, but whether or not it's the BEST film of this year is something else entirely.<br /><br />ARGO is essentially the recently declassified tale of the CIA's project to get six American embassy workers out of Iran during the hostage crisis of 1979. Tony Mendez (Affleck, doing double-duty again as the film's director and star as he did in his previous effort THE TOWN) is one of the best exfiltration people the CIA has, and he's been tasked by his superiors (one of them being the great Bryan Cranston) with coming up with a convincing cover to get himself there and get the six escaped hostages back. With the help of Mendez's friend Jack Chambers (John Goodman), an Oscar-winning Hollywood effects man who's helped him in the past, the enlistment of a cranky old-school producer (a wonderful Alan Arkin) and a lot of smoke and mirrors, they plan to use a low-budget sci-fi script for a film called \\"Argo\\" to create the proper cover, with Mendez as an executive producer and the escapees as the scouting crew for this film they plan to make in the deserts of Iran. The plan is put in place, but getting these folks out of Iran in the midst of a great deal of anti-American sentiment may prove much more deadly than anyone hoped.<br /><br />While there is a lot to enjoy about ARGO, there doesn't feel like there's much to remember about any of the characters. Mendez, as portrayed by Affleck, is a man of few flaws (aside from being an absentee father) and is played to be the unassailable hero of the piece, and has all of the typical beats of this character. He plays the calming voice to soothe the anxiety of the hostages; he plays the self-righteous anger when it appears that the mission is falling apart; he plays the wounded warrior when the mission does fall apart; etc. Affleck has shown with films like GONE BABY GONE and THE TOWN that he has great talent behind the camera, but has rarely been particularly compelling in front of it. The script by Chris Terrio shows that this is his first real film. It has beats of fun and solid entertainment, and there's a lot of nice behind-the-scenes tradecraft being shown here, but when all is said and done, there isn't much gravity to the film. The most entertaining the film gets is during the Hollywood sequences, when Arkin as Lester Siegel and Goodman as Chambers take full control of the narrative, and it gives Arkin easily one of the best and most memorable lines of a film all year. If the film had been two hours of this level of examination, it would have been a much more fulfilling experience, but not as typically Hollywood-level exciting or dramatic. The characters of the hostages (played by the likes of Tate Donovan, Clea DuVall, and Rory Cochrane to name a few) are all very one-note; they're either riddled with anxiety or they're angered over the absurdity of the escape plan until everything finally coalesces in the final sequence of the film where they overcome their fears and step up in typical Hollywood fashion.<br /><br />Speaking of the final sequence, THAT deserves all the accolades it gets because there were very few climactic sequences that were able to build and maintain the tension that Affleck succeeds in creating.<br /><br />ARGO, despite its release date of late Summer, strangely had the legs to really intrigue Oscar voters, and has been a real surprise dark horse, even though after seeing the film, it seems almost custom-made to be the safe choice for Best Picture. Films like ZERO DARK THIRTY and DJANGO UNCHAINED are too controversial to be good bets for Best Picture. LES MISERABLES just doesn't seem to be good enough; BEASTS OF THE SOUTHERN WILD and AMOUR are too obscure, and LIFE OF PI and SILVER LININGS PLAYBOOK just don't seem to have the big push. At this point, it really feels like the only two films that are in play for Best Picture are LINCOLN and ARGO. LINCOLN certainly seems like the safer choice, but ARGO is likely to pull the upset.<br /><br />Again, don't get me wrong; ARGO is a very very good film, but it's just not great.l sequence of the film where they overcome their fears and step up in typical Hollywood fashion.<br /><br />Speaking of the final sequence, THAT deserves all the accolades it gets because there were very few climactic sequences that were able to build and maintain the tension that Affleck succeeds in creating.<br /><br />ARGO, despite its release date of late Summer, strangely had the legs to really intrigue Oscar voters, and has been a real surprise dark horse, even though after seeing the film, it seems almost custom-made to be the safe choice for Best Picture.

B009A9EPLM|4.0|I kept hearing musical phrases from other compositions written for other movies<br />Sounded a lot like music from Saving Private Ryan
