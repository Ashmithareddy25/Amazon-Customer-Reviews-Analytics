B007SGM084|5.0|This is by far the best love story I have ever read!! Some of the scenes were a bit much but I fell in love with Christian Grey definatley would recommend this trilogy to everyone I know!!
B0059XTUB8|4.0|Delivered as expected, have not yet played it but the packaging looks like they are new. I have played another and no issues.
B007N5YIUS|4.0|it's what you expect from Angry birds. It's a nice twice though with the gravity and anti-gravity. I liked it enough I was willing to play it for Free...
1451695195|5.0|Dr. Alexander is a neurosurgeon, formerly on the staff of Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, the main teaching hospital of the Harvard Medical School. He was a doctor who believed in science, not God. He trusted in his own skills, his own knowledge, and dismissed non scientific approaches to health, and to life, as wishful thinking. In this respect he was firmly in the mainstream of modern American medicine. He developed e coli meningitis, a rare infection, which put him into a coma for a week, and should have killed him. His complete recovery was extremely unlikely, according to our knowledge of that disease. His experience while in a coma is inexplicable in scientific terms.<br /><br />Eben Alexander does not sit on the fence. He proclaims that he met an all knowing, all loving God, and that he was brought back to life for this purpose. His story is a joyous and uplifting account of God's plan for each one of us. He condenses the message he received into this: \\"You are loved and cherished, dearly, forever. You have nothing to fear. You can do nothing wrong.\\"<br /><br />Although Dr. Alexander goes to a church now, he does not approach this subject as a member of any particular religion. He rarely uses the words God or heaven in this book, usually calling the infinitely loving presence Om, after the sound that he remembers from \\"the core\\" where he communed with God.  The book alternates between his near death experience (abbreviated in the text as NDE) and a narrative of his family and friends, who stay with him constantly while he is in a coma. He also devotes time to descriptions of the medical facts in his case, which he describes very clearly in layman's terms. This is not a scientific treatise, but a story for those without a background in medicine. Nevertheless, Dr. Alexander writes as a scientist would write this, coming from a place of initial skepticism, puzzling it out in a rational, non judgmental manner. The medical facts in this book are accurate, and his description of the modern doctor's worldview is consistent with what I have encountered in my colleagues. One cannot dismiss the author as an imposter or a nut case. He is an excellent writer too.<br /><br />Dr. Alexander reviews possible medical explanations of his experience, and finds that none of them suffice.<br /><br />This experience, overwhelming as it is, doesn't answer every question. Why do humans have such a limited vision of the universe? Why do we suffer from loneliness, disease, poverty, violence, and hatred? The author comes to doubt his own experience, in spite of the immense power and immediacy of his memories. When he approaches other physicians with his testimony, he does not receive acceptance or even welcome. We doctors are skillfully trained and carefully conditioned to disbelieve any such tale. Then, like the faltering rock of the new church, he receives an additional, profoundly shocking insight, one which he cannot write off to the random misfiring of stressed neurons. He is a believer in almighty God. If you read this with an open mind, you can come away with faith and hope. You can also come away with nothing. It is a decision each one of us can make.and his description of the modern doctor's worldview is consistent with what I have encountered in my colleagues.

B009329ZF2|5.0|I don't know why so many people gave this movie bad ratings. The Graphics and overall Effects are great! the plot line is good. there are a couple times when the acting is a little off, one scene in particular stands out as cheesy with a bunch of old guys and you'll know when you see it. But this movie is Definitely worth seeing! If you like Sci-Fi or Action movies, the ideas, the weapons, the plot, are great!  I forced 3 work friends to watch this because they said it was stupid based on reviews but they never watched it. After watching it they agreed its definitely a movie that should have better ratings. Everyone that likes Action and SciFi movies, will like this movie.
B0083DJWGO|5.0|I really enjoyed this book--it provides much food for thought. Although I find the author's writing style to ramble somewhat, his ideas are novel and thought provoking. It's a long book but very much worth the time.
B005VTS4EY|5.0|Fun game just need to add some new levels as I have beaten the game for now. Feels like I'm giving my mind some exercise!
B008Z9L94O|4.0|This reissue sounds very good overall, but there is definitely some compression in the mastering.  Could have been a bit more dynamic.  Many of the songs do sound *huge* though.  It is pressed very hot and the inner grooves can be a test for inferior vinyl playback setup.  I would think any sub $2000 system may have issues. For sure it will require an excellent cartridge/arm combination.  They probably could have cut it a little less hot and less people would be having these tracking issues.  All my LPs were basically flawless, pressed by Pallas USA which is a quality outfit, so I can't really believe there are a lot of bad copies.  The artwork and packaging is top notch as well.  If Amazon ships you one without an outer box or something ridiculous, that is on Amazon, not on this reissue.  It should be the subject of a packaging review and returned to them for a replacement.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|I rated this product 5 stars for quality of both product and packaging.  The story and scenes were compelling and the UK version worked just fine on my USA DVD player.  The sound was good and the subscripts were a PLUS.
B007WR331W|4.0|This is a concert recorded in a studio in 2010.  The product comes with a DVD and CD of the whole show.  The whole show is about 75 minutes long.<br /><br />On the DVD, you have the choice of 5:1 or stereo sound and of course, the CD is only stereo.  The the 5:1 sound is nice but not great.  The stereo sound is a little crowded, but not bad.  The biggest problem is the sound does not resonate like it does on many of the other Caravan albums.  For instance, the viola sound kind of dead and uninteresting.<br /><br />The DVD has a quirk in that there is a dropout between songs, so that the video does not stream smoothly.<br /><br />The band is Pye Hastings, Geoff Richardson, plus relatively new keyboardist and bassist and a new drummer.  Richard Coughlin has medical problems (rumored to be severe arthrist) and cannot play.  He sits in the back on a stool and occasionally plays a percussion instrument.<br /><br />The concert is filmed in a studio in front of 120 people.  The small audience in a cramped studio and the condition of Coughlin make this kind of a sad video to watch. In addition, Hastings has to put on reading glasses so he can read the lyrics for some of the songs (he doesn't remember all the words). It is if the band is on its last legs and this is a last concert where nobody cares.<br /><br />The video is pretty good, with good camera angles and the being focused on the right person at the right time.  But, sometimes the camera angles are not so good.  Most of the time, Coughlin is hidden from view in the back...not sure if that was intentional.<br /><br />There is a mixture of songs from throughout the group's career.  However, I don't think it is the best song selection they could have come up with it.  I am not a fan of some of the songs played here.  But, the main reason I got the album is because it had Nightmare on it.  It is an excellent newer song and I don't have a copy of it.<br /><br />Like always, Caravan rarely plays a song the same way twicein a row.  And here the songs are played differently than on other live albums.  But, I don't think it is the best they have done.  It is too bad it is not like the \\"All Over You\\" albums, which are stunning remakes of older material.<br /><br />Really, if they went through the trouble of doing this show, I don't know why they didn't play longer.  They certainly could have played more songs and this would have been a better set to get.<br /><br />But, there are some great songs/performances on this set.  Most notable is Hello, Hello, with the greatest hedge clipper solo in the history of rock.
B009IJJB8G|3.0|Elementary is just another spin on the &#34;genius detective&#34; genre of crime shows. The show tries to be a little different by placing Sherlock Holmes in modern day New York, making him a recovering drug addict, and turning Watson into a woman played by Lucy Liu. If you suspend your disbelief an accept the premise, the show is okay. The BBC's does a better updated Holmes with its show &#34;Sherlock&#34;
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I loved this book!!!!!<br />I loved the movie too.<br />I didn't disliked anything at all.<br />My favorite book of all time
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I am hooked. The I feel as if I know these people.  Interesting to see how the world changed so drastically from 1912 to 1920
B000002AZX|5.0|What can i say, I love his music, lyrics and style! While I'm not an audiophile (do they still use this word?), I found the sound quality excellent.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I think it was a very sad depressing book I would recommend this book to anyone who likes exciting books I love your book Suzanne Collins
0545265355|5.0|I got the chance in high school to read the first book and fell in love with the characters that are in the book!<br /><br />I also got to see a preview of the second book on my phone, and it left me wanting to read more, so what better then buy then buy the series.<br /><br />Fast and quick shipping i love it!
B008DB2Y3O|5.0|Amazing album with amazing songs. My girls love it (and actually so do I)  These guys are way more talented than people give them credit for.
B00B19DMUE|5.0|I haven't been afraid of many movies, but this one is very well put together. It was worth waiting for and I can't wait to buy it.
B0095ZMMCK|4.0|I read a chapter or two every day.  I also follow the book up with personal analysis of the locations down to viewing the street address and motels.  This is an eyeopener for those who want to see and research about the current places and night life and present day culture of today's world.  Keep up the great work Tom Clancy and all his associates.
B002ECQQZU|5.0|The ending was very twisted. I bought the movie after watching it. It's a movie that every young woman should watch.
0765325950|4.0|While understandable if some readers find this book anticlimactic after so many thousands of pages and 14 books, but I found this book quite excellent.  I thought many of the plot lines were resolved, or at least the end hinted at in a satisfying way.<br /><br />The finale managed to walk the tightrope between convincingly putting the characters in danger, while not killing off every important character.  Give it a try. If you've read 13 books it is definitely worth finding out what happens.  Sanderson also manages to cut down on some of the extraneous descriptions which plagued books 7-10.
B007MAETA8|5.0|Very good work from John Mayer. It is a nice hear the first time around, but becomes increasingly addictive as you go over it again and again. Have at least five favorite songs on this album. Quite the mellow atmosphere there...
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Man, can he write! This is the second in the trilogy of the 20th century. The book takes place before and during the 2nd World War. The history and lavish accounting of the time period is explained and detailed, without boring the reader. I couldn't put it down.
B004GKMV16|5.0|A great journey from the beginning of London to modern days.<br />It gives a fictional slant to the history of a great city. Recommended.
B0055SWM08|5.0|This game is engaging but also beautiful and whimsical! I get lost for hours figuring out the puzzles and zoning on the pretty litte tune playing in the background.  One of the best puzzle games I've purchased for my Kindle Fire yet!
B0083Z614S|2.0|It started off so well that I went and bought a copy for a young friend.<br />However, the book deteriorated into crazy philosophy of 'magic' being the reason for everything.<br />Would not recommend it. Started well, but finished badly.
B007HACDLK|1.0|I truly hope their are no persona as portrayed in this book.  Conservative rabble-rousing to the point of disbelief.  Even if the story was good, the characters are all 1-dimensional.  I gave up after 50 pages.
1607066017|5.0|I truly believe that once this comic gets further down the line, down to at least its 50th issue it will be a movie or tv show. The originality of this comic is so awesome and story is just that engaging! I don't see many sci fi movies or shows coming out anymore and I think Saga can easily become one. I realize this is a very general review but if you like most sci fi comics you'll surely love Saga, It's a mature comic so you'll find a good dose of nudity blood and violence. I personally can't put it down, after getting this volume I started to pick up every monthly issue the day it comes out. I just wish theyd come out weekly instead!
B005K0HDGE|3.0|I read a lot of reviews of this book before purchasing it.  I had hoped it would be a page turner, but it just didn't hold my interest and I stopped reading it.  I may try to pick it back up and plow through when I have no other books to read but I have a hard time recommending this one.  The price is good if you like Stephen King.
B009IEXKXI|3.0|Would it hurt too much to edit the manuscript before converting it to Kindle? What a mess. 'Sheers' instead of 'shears'? Numbers not spelled out? 'What is this?' He asked? Extra words, words missing? Could've been a five-star review, but this kind of sloppiness just irritates the hell out of me.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|One of the most useful apps! Works exactly as intended!! East to use. No trouble with it ever!! I recommend the app!!
B006LMMN8I|5.0|This is one of the most relaxing albums I've listened to recently, Gregory Porter has a very soothing voice .
1476719071|4.0|I truly enjoyed reading Abby and Travis' story! Who wouldn't love a guy full of ink who's in a fight club? I liked reading how Travis and Abby's relationship progressed. It wasn't an easy road to take. Abby was more reluctant that he was which was refreshing. He of course is a true ladies man and wasn't buying his bs from the start. She's trying to live a quiet life on campus far away from the life she led with her father. She believes Travis is the opposite of what she needs and she couldn't be more wrong. I enjoyed seeing how Travis was the one that fell hard for Abby first. I love his nickname for her-Pigeon! That was truly sweet! However, there were times when Abby got annoying with her reluctance towards Travis. She was breaking his heart! I would recommend this book to anyone! I liked reading it very much!!
6305558167|4.0|everything is great in it!!! pictures-score-story!!!! to watch and watch again!!!! for every movie freaks!!!! excalibur make my day, astonishing!!!!
B0092MKTL2|5.0|5 Stars. This is a great band.  Radioactive and Its Time are awesome songs.  Would definitely recommend this to a friend.
B0008ENHTE|1.0|this must be a classic from the classic!! don't make me laugh!! the story is boring, it was a terrible movie!!!!
B005QJZ5FA|5.0|I got this for my daughter for Christmas and she love love loved it. My other daughter loved it also.
0783240236|4.0|great story!!!! cat and mouse between humans and birds!!! miss hedren is the ultimate hithcockien lady!!! i love the scenes in the beginning in the birds store!!! in some internet sites it is said that the character of the schoolteacher is a lesbian!! i never thought about this! but in the scene in the coffee store, in the back (when melanie talk with a old woman), there is two strange girls!! could it be some innuendo???
B004X4R49Y|4.0|Some important ideas are presented in a very entertaining way. I was impressed by the period imagery as well. It was, overall a great movie.
B004SB60OC|5.0|Two of my favorite songs are on thus CD, Christina has a beautiful voice and did not really low of her before these two songs.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|I'm a former planetary scientist, and I was surprised at how accurate the science in this book was. I'm also a fan of this new brand of novels that is written in a more casual, contemporary language -- they feel so intimate and lively. The Martian was one of the best hard sci-fi novels I've read in a long time. I wish the author would raise the price of it to at least $2.99, if not $9.99.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I am  a Hospice volunteer.  Everyone faces death differently.  This was a good inside look into what patients go through.
B00ABXA1HI|5.0|bought into this so I could use my main computer programs I already have so I wouldn't have to keep buying apps, and it's perfect! it didn't work at first but that was because I needed to reset my pop up blocker to temp. instead of always and voila! I have my main computer on my kindle fire he.
B004HX0P2Y|5.0|The move is funny, light, entertaining - and has action in it, too.  Really enjoyed it and have watched it many times.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game. its so addicting. I only got it because my friends recomended it but now I'm hooked. they should make more games like that one.
B0009XRZ9M|5.0|one more movie to add to my must watch for the holidays.how they made it was very interesting to see.
B000IYU9IG|4.0|Give me check boxes and I'll fill out or don't bother asking.  See, eight more words are needed to finish.
B005QJZ5FA|4.0|This a great album and has a super atmosphere. It makes you wonder where she can go next without repeating herself. I look forward to the next one.
B008K8X0IS|5.0|Never saw it during its original run on TV but heard a great review in the newspaper when the blue ray came out so I thought I'd give it a try. Loved it and couldn't wait for the second season to come out on TV. Now waiting for the second season to come out on bluray so I can watch the whole series again before the third season starts up in March.
B0085P2Z6E|5.0|Challenging puzzle game, has a good story and plot twist.  I would recommend this game to anyone who enjoys seek and find games.  My only issue is that it is a little to dark in some areas.
0060531053|3.0|This is a must read for any homebrewer but if I had to choose I would get 'How to Brew&#34; by John Palmer instead.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|Super funny, I loved all the laughs that it brought in. I would recommend it to to everyone to see.
B00A8SPNYW|4.0|Finally this works on my Kindle Fire.  It's a fun game that keeps getting harder with time.  Great for wasting time waiting for my daughter.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|A great and fast read. Once you start you will not want to put it down. I highly recommend this book!
030746363X|3.0|The shear size of this book makes it difficult to digest.  While he suggests places to start, I found this difficult to incorporate into daily living.  Some of his ideas, while sounding good on paper, are impractical to implement.
B005CRQ4XI|5.0|It's rare that you can take an author's words both literally and figuratively, but you can take Cheryl Strayed's words that way in Wild.  This is a riveting true story that is well written.  It has everything - love, despair, humor, you name it.  An amazing and inspiring story.
1451695195|5.0|Once I started to read it I couldnt put the  book down. I read it straight thru. I loved having a Dr write it as he added his medical knowledge also.  Proof of Heaven
B004I744AS|5.0|The Best dictionary app in the app store, hands down. The thesaurus and the links to Wikipedia makes this app top of its class.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Loved the second book and how it culminates ultimately ending in the return of an unprecedented \\"Hunger Games\\". It's an easy read and I couldn't put it down for days! I'm currently reading the next book and so far am enjoying it!
B000SVZIR6|4.0|Every girls dream to meet a king, but for me I know for sure I'm going to meet, dance, and live with the King of kings.
B009HEJXFS|5.0|I thought thiss was a great movie! I was abit skeptical after the lackluster 2nd movie but I really enjoyed this one!
B008QMMEOE|3.0|My daughter has already finished the puzzles. They are not that challenging for her at all and she is 2 years old...
B005HSL626|5.0|This app is great! I love all the different game styles and the swords and backgrounds. the only small annoyance is the weird Internet pop ups that ask you to log into a website to get prizes. all in all I love it!!!!! plus.its.free!
B005XI9456|5.0|My family loves Christmas songs during the Holidays and me and my daughter were dancing and singing around to this.
B008XG1X18|5.0|This app is just like the website<br />I haven't had one problem with it<br />I am on this app 24/7
B000FBFN0Q|1.0|I don't really hate this book--a star rating had to be chosen. It just isn't anything that interests me, a purchase mistake.  Fay
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This book is as great as the first. And turning into a nice love story! Can't wait to read the next one!!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|first off, my roku is awesome! i love the show, so being able to purchase and stream this right away was excellent. no commercials and good picture
B005ERIRZE|5.0|I think this is one of the best books written on willpower. This book not only explains what willpower is, it provides useful information for developing more of it . It is well written and explains things in a very easy to understand format, plus she provides the research and studies that back the information. Again this is an excellent book if you are looking to understand willpower and yourself better .
B006YC74E8|5.0|Easy to use, lots of features and works really well on kindle fire. Load your photos and edit--add frames, adjust colors. Contrast, sharpen., etc.
B008WCP2PG|5.0|It is def a chic flick but I loved it. The price was awesome and came quick considering it was Christmas time. Thanks!
B0096CDG0O|5.0|Love this game.  Lots of family play so we have games going all the time.  I would strongly recommend it.
B004GHNIRK|4.0|Well written novel, a literary masterpiece, but it helps to see the movie first to better follow the intricate plot and cast of characters.
B00006M183|3.0|Some good tunes and some blah ones. I think the album really falls off towards the end, starting with Green Disease. It starts off with a very promising intro and then just goes nowhere. I'm sorry to say it but Eddie just ruins this. His voice still sounds great(i could listen to him sing the phone book and dig it), but where is the ENERGY? He sounds like he recorded his vocals in bed while still 3/4 asleep. This is most noticable on a song like Save You, which just begs for high energy performance and passion. Instead, he sounds like he couldn't care less about saving his friend. Now i realize this is no longer Vs. era Eddie but he still sounds like he mailed it in. Ghost suffers a similar fate, a good straight ahead rocker that could've been so much better. Still some great tunes on here though, like Can't Keep, I Am Mine, the gorgeous Thumbing My Way, and 1/2 Full. I just wish i knew what was up with Eddie during this time. Perhaps his voice was simply too strained, because he sounds better on later albums. Still a must have for PJ fans, just don't expect it to be one of their better albums.
B00A3DZ61W|5.0|This game is a must have for any Angery Birds/Star Wars fan.  A wonderful retelling of the story Angery Birds style.
B00999DFP0|3.0|I bought the set of 1-5 bundle in Australia after coming late to the show. I gorged myself over a weekend- not the wisest choice. I enjoy much about the show, but the Leonard character, Johnny Galecki, is a terrible actor! He can't talk without holding his left hand in his right hand, he always tilts his head back to talk and looks down his nose,(ok, he's short, but can't he move his eyes?) he always furrows his brow, he has a whiney, inflexible voice and his role in the show is too large. The Howard and Raj characters are much more amusing. There's a bit too much of Penny and too much rap rap rap Penny Penny Penny on the door. That little joke got old quickly. And too much filmed in the apartment or the canteen. Having said all that- I really like it, but Leonard loses a star. Incidentally Only $60 in Oz for the whole package!
B0012HQKZE|4.0|Great actors (Anthony Hopkins has always been one of my favorites!) and if you are an outdoors type person, the scenery in this movie takes place in the wilderness.  This movie was one I selected because I had never heard of it and because of the great actors and I can say I was pleasantly surprised!  The movie is alittle suspense, drama,and a tale of wilderness survival with a few &#34;twists&#34; thrown in it so take the chance and you will not be disappointed!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I did read a lot of reviews before I bought this book and it is true ~ I laughed and cried a lot while reading Hopeless. It has a nice twist in the book and the characters are fun and interesting. I read this book in a day, I couldn't put it down. I had to find out what happened next.<br />I've actually read Colleen Hoover's other books, Slammed & Point of Retreat and I really liked those. So, this worked out well, I wanted to read any other book that she wrote. I hope she continues to bring us more great books!
B005OCFHHK|4.0|I would recommend this product to all Harry Potter fans. It is one of the greatest piece of literature of all time. My only problem is not the Bluray disc but the case is comes in. The case is plastic and broke after opening it. The discs are hard to remove and without proper hand eye coordination, you can actually break one of the disc because the case is terribly made. Other than that, Great movies series.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|These books are a great story line!  Since I read book one and now book two can't wait to start book three.  I have not been able to put them down.  I have laughed, cried, fell happiness for both of them so romantic.  Must read so much passion between two people!
B006GWO5NE|5.0|I wish this would have come with the original purchase as it is great and shortens the charging time significantly!
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|I got this book so I could laugh, and laugh I did. Ocassionaly I was put off by the way she put herself down, but usually it was so funny that I didn't care. A good read.
B005YPJ31I|5.0|This is so well written and gives you the feeling of being there when all of this history is being made. It gives you insight into the people and what their motivations were. It tells us about Abraham Lincoln in very human ways. It has made me admire him more than I did before reading this book. Thank you Doris Kearns Goodwin for all of your hard work.
B00A757EFW|1.0|dont waste your time people. it is stupid. thank goodness its free. you might like it if your really awesome at it but im not.have a good day.
B008Z9YGEE|4.0|I like the movie because I watched it with my young adult children and enjoyed with them. They would have given it 5 stars.
0060235152|5.0|His daddy asked me to get it and he says the little guy really likes the illustrations in it.  GREAT!
B0088WK27S|3.0|The story is great one and true, acting was a little bland may have been done intentionaly. Good Moral movie.......with a vigilante-soldier preacher....hmmmmmmmm.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I have been reading through the Bible yearly since 1995. You Version has supplied my reading plans, devotionals, and nice touches of encouragement.

B00AYB20KI|4.0|Its more like 3.25stars. I watched with a room full of females and the screams that came from them was enough to give it the 4 stars. Not really really scarey just the jump out your seat startle type. It even has a story line. watch it at home.
B000Q7ZO8U|5.0|A must have for everyone's Christmas Movie Collection!! So nice to be able to get this classic super fast!!  It arrive
B00A9C3RB8|5.0|Its nice to see a movie that isn't about 20 somethings thinking they have problems in love.  This shows how life may take that turn no one expects
B002PL5GTC|5.0|I purchased this it for my 18 year old daughter and she was very pleased. It comes with two vinyls. They sound great! Even  though she only knew three of the songs, my daughter told me the songs chosen for this set were perfect.
B009RI4FRU|1.0|I'm not sure why anyone who watch this movie.  With all the big name actors I thought it would me awesome.  BORING!
B00AKL1XPU|4.0|It takes a long time to breed animals. If you don't have friends on Facebook to play with then the quests occasionally suck. But overall fun game to play to pass the time and the animals dance moves are as amusing as watching your parents dance.
B009VB7P6G|5.0|I would watch this movie again.  I watched it with my son and he told me not to tell anyone.
B005WUHAX8|1.0|Amazon placed the order through Beesknees ?  The case came quickly.  It was sealed like new and the packaging appeared to be totally legitimate..  When we tried to make the phone fit the case it would not work.  The holes for the buttons of the phone to come through were in the wrong place.  It was not functional.  We called Lifeproof and they asked for the serial number on the box and we were told that they have no such number and the case was fake.  A knock off.  Amazon took the returned fake case and issued a credit.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This book is awesome I love it it's I am katniss the book is amazing I love Suzanne Collins thanks
B008ELUEQC|4.0|Unfortunately the package did not protect the CD and I got the box broken. I got it in time. Thanks
B008LH4YYC|1.0|I removed the ES Task Manager.  I didn't find a use for much of the functionality.  For example, I can see and kill running tasks using the built-in Applications tool.
B007MB5OCE|5.0|This book was great story, believable characters, and hilarious. A great history and geography lesson Ian a bonus. I liked the book so much I bought some hard copies to give to my friends.
B0070Y46UY|4.0|I went to see the Life of Pi shortly after it was released here in the U.K. not really knowing what it was about. I knew from the movie trailer (that made me want to go and see the film) that the book was about two castaways- a boy and a tiger. I also knew that the book the film was based off was a Booker Prize award winner. All of these factors made me excited to see the film, but when I left the cinema the only thing I felt was disappointment. Yes, the CGI and graphics were amazing, but I just didn't find the plot of the film that exciting or entertaining. I mean, the story was about a boy and a tiger been cast away, the movie should have been epic!<br /><br />Luckily, my girlfriend (who watched the film with me) also found it a bit of the let down and decided to buy me the book for Christmas. I'm really pleased she did because the book was much better!<br /><br />As the plot goes, the book was similar to the film. However, there were a few changes in the book that weren't implemented into the film. The one I liked most was all the facts Martel puts in about zoology and facts about other zoos around the world. It added a little humour to the book, which I think the film lacked. In addition, the facts about animals and the way they learn, adapt and live made the book a lot more interesting to read because it shows why Richard Parker acts the way he does and how Pi uses his knowledge to try and tame him.<br /><br />I also thought the book was less focused on religion than the movie. I think in this aspect the movie was trying to push a point on the viewer with religion, whereas the book seemed to be a lot more subtle. I think this was helped in the book because you were reading Pi's thoughts, which obviously the movie would have had trouble portraying. Even though the book was more subtle, it was still thought provoking throughout, especially in the last few chapters.<br /><br />Overall, I really liked the book and Martel's style of writing. As normally happens in these cases, I preferred the book to the film and would suggest that you read the novel first! I don't know who I'd suggest this book to as it was a lot different to novels that I normally read. However, if you like a good, well-written, thought provoking novel that is a little different, then the Life of Pi is definitely for you!<br /><br />For more book reviews google adam-p-reviewshese cases, I preferred the book to the film and would suggest that you read the novel first!

6305754969|4.0|I own this already and got it as a gift for my soon to be son-in-law for Christmas. We are both avid Wayne fans! A well done movie. It has Robert Mitchum, as well as a young James Caan. Nice action. For those of you who are t.v. western fans, there's a brief cameo by the, now a bit older, t.v. son of The Rifleman. This was also directed by Howard Hawks.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This was a great great story. I am so glad there is a book 2 because there is so much more to find out. They seem like a great book couple with a future.
B0045HCJSK|4.0|I got this for my soon to be son-in-law for Christmas. It got he just fine and looks good. I really like this movie, myself. He and I are great Wayne fans and this one is got great action, plus you see some of Wayne's humor. I also like Dean Martin. This one has Angie Dickinson, as well as Walter Brennan. It's directed by one of Wayne's favorite directors, Howard Hawks.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I read this book in two nights because I couldn't put it down. Everyone should read this! The story keeps you entertained til the very end.
0061122416|5.0|My fav book. Inspirational, exciting, well-written.  You need to own this book. PlayBook usually has electronic copy on sale for a low price if you prefer the electronic version.
B001GQ2TGA|5.0|If you like Enya and you like Christmas, you will love this album.  Many of the titles were unfamiliar to me.  I bought it because it was Enya and I wanted her in my holiday collection.  Glad I did.  No regrets.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|very smooth and entertaining read but a little lackluster in the wording. Either way, I am onto Book 2! Can't stay away from grey!
0060760273|5.0|Goodnight Moon was my son's favorite book when he was small.  I must have read it to him thousands of times.  I chose this version to give as gifts for baby showers.  I know my son would have LOVED having the bunny to cuddle as we read the book together.
B0086700CM|4.0|It is my third best game in my life.My first game is.....Jet Pack Jill Ride,then Temple Brave,after is Temple Run
B00005JL2O|1.0|This in all honesty has to be one of the worst films ever made. The \\"humor\\" consists of bathroom, sex, and grossness gags which aren't in any way made funny, but are just presented for us to laugh at because they are obscene. Most people over the age of eight won't break into giggles at this sort of thing. I'm not speaking out of any puritanical objection to grossness in itself in a film: there is a long tradition of comic grossness in art, but for grossness to be comic, you have to do something with it. This film doesn't. If there were an academy award booby prize, Goldmember would deserve it. Advisory: the \\"sexual innuendo, crude humor and language\\" which give the film its PG-13 rating are all too idiotic to be very harmful to anyone of any age.  The New Line Entertainment DVD transfer is very good.
B001UV4XIS|5.0|Of course since I saw this in the theater I knew it would be good.  Enjoy having it so I can watch it at home again and again.
B0017SWPXY|4.0|I love how this story was told by the dog. This is a  great perspective on life. Very worthy of your time.
B0095ZEDTU|5.0|This movie has an amazing actress and the plot is quite enticing! It traps you in a world of wonder.
B009JZTOG8|5.0|Plot is well done and the characters are very are all a little of the normal view of storybook characters which is awesome!
B0084IG7KC|5.0|Great movie at a great price. I was skeptical because of all the &#34;tween&#34; hype, but I can't wait for the next one. Great price, too!
B00008EY7H|5.0|These world class acrobats and sensational music made a wonderful gift. I am thanked every time my friend watches it.
B001GZ6QEC|5.0|Great movie at a great price. You can't go wrong for yourself or the Batman and superhero fan in your life.

0061122416|2.0|I expected something more original. Richard Bach's Illusions: The Adventures of a Reluctant Messiah does a better job of demonstrating the principle of letting go and following your dreams. If only Mr. Coelho had thrown in a busty blonde, a camel chase, and ended it with a bloody shootout at the pyramids. Now, there's a, by-god, story!
B009ZXT4BY|1.0|Horrible app I wish I could give zero stars such a COPY OF MINECRAFT!  really it's still horrible and the controls SUCK. Save your home and don't download this terrible app!  &lt;:(
B002JWD6AS|5.0|I couldn't put this book down.  I felt like I know Sam and Grace,  I'm going to miss them now that I have finished the book!  I can only hope that there is more of their story in the next one.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|the whole family enjoys playing this game. the birds and the pigs makes the game more appealing and fun! wow
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|The show was so good I loved ever minute of it. I would recommend if you haven't seen it that you watch the first season first.
B009U9S6FI|4.0|Excellent book, but there are inexplicable typos-- the word difficult displays as diffcult, and there's another repeated misspelling. Hard to understand when a search and replace in an electronic file could fix it.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|This book is a nice and simple romance with a good upbeat theme to it. It is also a good life lesson for those who don't believe love exists anymore. Good read.
B0095R6OBS|1.0|The idea of a dog brought back from the dead who then goes through misunderstandings similar to those experienced by Frankenstein is well.....Not terribly exciting...too short and lacks a reason for being. I kept waiting for some twist or insight. There really wasn't one. It just ended and I sat there realizing I'd wasted way too much money.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I enjoy playing this game, it puts me in a trance of some sort. I try to play all the time at least every chance I get!
B002HLM4E0|5.0|Of the first four episodes, this is easily the best.  Use of characters and overall story nicely done.  Noticeable falloff with episode four.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|CD is top notch.  Great music by great musicians!  Sound quality is also commendable.  Would recommend to others for sure.
B0086700CM|5.0|I have been playing this for about a week or so and really enjoy it - it can be very addictive - you just want to keep trying over and over again to do better!!
B001AQO3QA|4.0|This collection is great and I caught in sale, which makes it better! It has all the movies and any of them that also had a later release, those are there too. A good deal. I am not, I say again, not, a video/audiophile guru! But on the first Alien and again on then 3rd one I food see some fuzzy black and blurry parts. For Blu-ray I think that is wrong. If I wanted a less clearer picture I would have bought DVD. Not a terrible thing, but if I noticed it then you will too. But I am overall happy
B006LSZECO|2.0|I wish I had read reviews more carefully and believed the warnings,  \\"Don't buy this book!\\"  I will admit that I was immediately hooked as I started to read.  In fact, I couldn't put the book down at first  and raced toward the finish.  The more I read, however, the more I regretted my purchase.  This book is ridiculous!  The ending is one of the worst in history!! The ending was like a slap in the face or a \\"Ha! Gottcha!\\"  Live and learn.....learn to take reviews seriously.  This book is awful!!
B009ZE27US|1.0|Granddaughter downloaded this on my Kindle, kind of stupid and boring,  but it was free  Not worth the time to download
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Wow.  This book was really a page turner for me.  Fabulous characters....twists and turns......heartbreaking at times.....but a wonderful story of forgiveness and love.
B009CPJHY4|5.0|Was expecting a movie about old people growing older...(yawn)...that was not it at all!!<br /><br />It is about reinventing yourself - at ANY AGE!  Enjoyable, clean, (no violence).  Good humor.  Not for kids..they will be bored.<br /><br />Highly recommend as a feel good movie.
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|I have read every book written by Preston and Child.  As with all the other books, this one did not disappoint.  I love the intricacy of his plot and what I learn from all the research.  I finished this one within 2 to 3 days and was ready for the next one.
B003BW0CB6|5.0|Outstanding story-line. Gripping characters and a spellbinding end make this one of his best books in the &#34;Lincoln Lawyer&#34; series and maybe the best of his career to date. Bravo!!!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|The book held my interest throughout the entire book, adventurous.<br />Yes I would recommend it to my friends who read that kind of book.
B001BTG3OQ|5.0|Flash works as advertised full of functions and as we come to expect another great product from Nikon . No overheat issues have been encountered so far.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This is honestly the best post-apocalyptic/dystopian type series that I have ever read. The story is so original and imaginative, yet completely believable. I felt continually compelled to read just 1 more page, then 'okay, I'll just read another' - until hours had passed by & I never realized it because I was so involved in the story.<br /><br />Really, I would recommend this series to anyone who just loves to read and get lost in another world because the world of \\"Wool\\" is so rich that when you are in it, it seems more real than the one you are living in. And the characters are so well developed, so complete they become your friends and you don't want to leave them.<br /><br />I'm so happy I discovered this series!
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Awe... What a sweet story! Waking Up Married is a romantic comedy guaranteed to make you smile. It's a total fantasy, but remarkably heartwarming.
B009ZXT4BY|5.0|It's a great game. If you love minecraft please get this. I play it all the time and it never gets old
B009IRVSVQ|5.0|well i love number two and three respectably and my girlfriend hates number 3 for apparent reasons (the sexual endues) and I would recommend this CD to anyone that still purchases CD's. Great beats followed by great lyrics and awesome singing A++++
B00ABGEFWC|3.0|It is a very fun game I love it so much and the little animals are so cute in it!!(:
B008RA3X5E|5.0|Best .99 app...the clock reminds me of the one that woke me in high school, so retro, I love it and would recommend it to anyone. I also love the night stand feature, so cool!!!!!!!!
B007MAET4O|5.0|John Mayer's Born and Raised on vinyl: JHave always like John Mayer - but now I love watching/hearing him grow and mature as an artist.
0425252868|5.0|A Higher Call is an excellent book, well written and it really keeps your interest.  Also, it provides an insight into the life and  code of conduct of the German fighter pilot. I highly recommend it to all that enjoy aviation, especially WW ll.
1858707536|5.0|This is my all time favorite solo album by Rick, and this recording is just wonderful, I could not be happier with it. I am not going to get into the technical aspects of this recording, I am just going to enjoy it forever. Thanks Rick, this is simply a beautiful recording.
B00457X7IQ|2.0|This review is for the trilogy. I keep looking for good modern fantasy fiction but I keep finding weak imitations. The lead character is likeable and so are his friends but there is no lore, no logic, no difficult trials that are resolved by the character's skills or wit, instead some adults and ghosts show up conveniently to save the day or a new magic power or talisman helpfully appears. And for goodness sakes if the dead mum could send some messages that are actually helpful that would be a nice change. Last but not least, why won't any of the adults in the book just be straight with the kids and then they wouldn't have to go rescue them all the time. Maybe I am too old for this series, too many times the characters attend school dances or parties with people they don't like and bad guys just waiting to get them. Hmmm I am having a rant and I know I said last but not least but why the hey don't any of these evil dastardly bad guys ever take the opportunity to just kill the good guys (especially the lead dude who isn't a caster so pretty much defenceless) when they are near them?!?
1451696191|5.0|Such an incredible story! I recommend everyone read it. It's very touching and heartfelt. I'm hoping the movie stays as close to the book version as possible.
B009O07NDY|5.0|I have been a Tolkien fan since I was in college many, many years ago. To be able to listen to the music in the background while doing work, bills, or just surfing the net, brings back fond memories. When I listen to the CD, it recalls images of the movie, The Hobbit. Can't wait for the sequels!
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|I thought this was a very well written and interesting read!  Definitely held my attention. Must admit the movie got me connected.
B008D36INE|1.0|Junk. Beautiful Girl hooks up with immature momma's boy and messes up her life.  Yet another movie about co dependent personalities.
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|I think anyone who loves ops aka littlest pet shop would love this game and if you do get it add me as a friend
B005LAIHR2|2.0|This i think must be one of Tom Cruises biggest blunders in show business, could hardly understand what he was saying in fact i did not even finish watching it, i might one day but not any time soon.  I hope his new movie Jack Reacher is better if not he better step up his game, after all he cant get buy on his good looks forever.
B006OCM0G0|1.0|It took too long to load and was really slow, should have better graphics! i did not enjoy this game!
0307720950|5.0|I purchased this book for an engineering student who hopes to make a difference in people's everyday lives.  He may be a part of the &#34;new industrial revolution.&#34;
B003R4ZMNQ|5.0|To Hawaii twice. Every time I watch this show I want to go back. Great back drop for suspenseful and action packed TV show.
B005FISC52|5.0|This was purchased for an avid One Tree Hill fan to complete her collection.  Even though the show will not have any new episodes, she can enjoy watching her favorite television program.
B003F3NDP8|5.0|My wife loved this show. She doesn't have to  miss it now. Got her the whole set. She was very very happy with it.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|I was disappointed during the first half of the book thinking I'd managed to read a cheesy teenage love and heartbreak story but once I got halfway through everything changed and I couldn't put the book down.
B001VPJYZK|5.0|Got my wife the whole set of Desperate Housewives. She couldn't have been happier. She really really loves it. Highly recommended.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 this game!! It is SOOO addicting:):) it's like a carnival game u can't get enough of!! The only problem is that it takes to long to regenerate coins:(:(
B002QGUFWE|5.0|Likes Lady Gaga, so I got her this. She really likes the music. The girl may be a little different but she can sing. Highly Recommended.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|Fabulous book. Lessons for young and old. Highly recommend it for parents to read with their children. Great source of discussion.
B00079FUI6|5.0|She really enjoyed this show. Very sad when they cancelled it. I bought her all the seasons. She couldn't have been happier.
B00AMBLXP8|1.0|Thought with the names in the movie it would be worth while to warch. Big mistake, very disappointed. Movie was not funny and I fell asleep watching it
B00008PW2D|5.0|She really enjoyed this show. Very sad when they cancelled it. I bought her all the seasons. She couldn't have been happier.
B00AE2IJIE|4.0|Kids enjoyed it and the adults did too. Funny and the movie was interesting enough to keep everyones attention.  Story line was very good.
B003E8P9G0|5.0|All the Rick Riordan book are the best. This is one of the best book. If you enjoyed this book read the hero's of Olympus sires
B00A6N8F4Y|1.0|I really don't know what has happened to Oliver Stone. This movie was a bad rip off of a bad Quentin Tarantino movie.
B007V4530A|3.0|very informative, but not inspirational, I would recommend this to public speakers such as I , but for informative purposes only.
B005PK1G76|5.0|If you have a Chicco Liteway Stroller...this is the organizer you need.  If fits perfectly, looks like it was part of the stroller, and the best part is that you do not have to remove it when you fold your Chicco Liteway Stroller.  :)
B004U8VWLE|3.0|Natalie Portman is excellent, but the plot is somewhat disjointed and unoriginal. Worth watching - but not worth an oscar nomination.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|This is an amazing book even though it's very sad. I recommmened it for everyone<br />  Amazing amazing amazing amazing amazing
B004K4AVAG|4.0|My 8 year old loves the lead singer and  listens to her when we go to the gym. She doodles in her sketch book and plays in the play area to the beat. Some of the songs are even on my iPod!

B0076L9W9Q|5.0|I'm trying to pull my daughter back out of country music. She likes Halestorm because of the lead singer's voice, and is now back to listening to both country and hard rock. I like this group too, but this particular album has no bad songs. It is worth every dime!
B00005JKGZ|5.0|Got drug to the play meet me in st Louis in Cedar Rapids IA by my wife for my sister's birthday ended up enjoying the play very much. None of us had seen the movie so I bought it for my sister's birthday ended up enjoying the movie also. It was the 2 disk version worth the price.
B008PNBU30|5.0|Since the lead singer of the group just quit, this will probably be the last album with his voice. I'm looking forward to listening to it in my car, the gym, work, and everywhere. Still mourning Three Days Grace!!!!
0765325950|5.0|Loved Loved loved it this is my all time favorite series I'm ready to start at book one and enjoy it all again. Loved how everything came out to an excellent ending with all the twists and turns. I did dread reading the last chapter was afraid it wouldn't very well boy was I surprised.  Loved it one more time but I'm sorry to see it end.
B007N5YIUS|5.0|This is fun. It's a great upgrade to the original version.I can't wait to see what's in store for the next version.
B009IAIBAE|4.0|I haven't listened to this yet, but the packaging is awesome!!! If your a maiden fan like myself and you lost your vinyl from the 80's for whatever reason and you want to recapture your youth I recomend these with NEW packaging it is a win.
B0084IG8TM|5.0|I thought this film was excellent.  The heroics found and learning the way to survive when faced with society's sick attempt at entertainment...well put together.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Flynn is fearless and her writing just gets better and better.  Good thrillers are hard to come by and Gillian Flynn never disappoints.
B005LAII0I|4.0|Not what I expected but it was cute.  There were some funny shticks in there but I expected a little more.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|Great book for middle school kids and adults. Learn about acceptance, compassion, kindness and character strength from a very unique and likable main character.
B00684J49U|5.0|Needed to understand what happened during the plane crash.  Devastated me.  Great season and I couldn't wait for it to come back in repeats.
B005LAIH3G|4.0|Good Movie but not great. I have read the original books and this movie is close but they changed some plot lines. I do miss that in the books nobody on Mars wore clothes (LOL). The image and sound quality are what you expect from Disney, which is outstanding. I like the 3D image on this movie.
B000PAU032|3.0|You often buy an album from listening to one selection, the other are so so pieces and fillers of space, it is hard to believe a philharmonic orchestra actually performed some of these selections.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I never write reviews but this app is amazing! Especially for the Kindle Fire. 100% worth the download. I &lt;3 Pinterest!!!
B001EC3JME|4.0|Good product that has met my expectations.  Fits my belt well and light is secure and snug and easy to access.
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|I chose this version because it was free and it certainly didn't disappoint. I love the book and the digital version was just as good as the paper versions.
B005O7PXNS|5.0|There are intense episodes and funny episodes. Love the show. We watch it together as a family. I highly suggest it.
B006LSZECO|3.0|The first half of the book I found myself saying, \\"This is stupid why do I continue to read this book?\\"  Knowing the reviews for this book were good I just continued on.  Finally, half way through the book it became interesting.  It wasn't a bad story but it could have been shorter.  Bottom line: yawner to mid point, interesting from mid point to end.
B009SJ3H8Q|5.0|Love the actors/acting/storyline.<br />I was confused at first, seeing the people from the first season.<br />Hoping for a third season.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I love this app it is very addicting I can not get enough great download highly recommend fun for everyone
B004H1V5RU|3.0|Not having had the previous perplexus, I find this one difficult.  Maybe I need to try the others first.  My daughter is nine and tries to no avail, I have tried to no avail, husband has tried to no avail...has anyone done this?  Hmmmmm?????
0452289963|5.0|This book changed my life by changing my perspective on life. If everyone read this book and applied it to their lives, then the world would be the beautiful place it was destined to be! Do not allow your egoic thought patterns to get in the way of you enjoying this book with your entire being. This book is meant for all who are struggling to find meaning and purpose! If only amazon would allow me to rate this book with ten stars!
B005VPRETE|5.0|Finally Legos for GIRLS!  These are the cutest sets I have ever seen!  Lots of imagination and playtime.  Will definateky be adding to this collection of ours!
B009IJJ5B4|4.0|At first I was skeptical of this program... Lucy Liu as Watson? But it turns out to be good television. If you can suspend your reality and think Holmes in modern day New York and a woman as Watson, I think it will keep your attention.
B001NHNG64|3.0|This was an interesting book and again lots of action but this time I thought some of the situations were not quite plausible.  Story line is good and it actually revolves around gun control and separation of country.  There is some romance.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|This is the number one site for books and ect. Can't do without it. Must have. Loads on Nexus 7
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|I picked this book because of other reviews and was not disappointed.  There are quite a number of twists in this book which I did not expect and that keeps you wanting to read on.  The main characters are very interesting.  A book that teenagers as well as adults will enjoy.
B007THA4FI|3.0|Strange story. I was compelled to read it as Rowling's writing is always good. But this is the most unlikable collection of characters, I've ever run across. :Like Martha Grimes, it seems she's a one character writer.
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|This book was good from page 1 until the end.  Lots of action with a little romance.  Interesting characters throughout the book.  It was hard to put the book down.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|By the time I got to this book i the series I was caught hook, line & sinker. I thought the first couple of books were slow and really only started reading them because I saw the first show of Game of Thornes on tv and was compelled to read these only because Sean Bean  played Edard Stark. Sure wish Mr. Martin would hurry up and finish this series. It's killing me.
B000JMKTLO|4.0|Gillian Flynn is a fantastic writer.  I have read all three of her books, and I am anxiously awaiting her fourth.  My favorite of her's is Gone Girl, but Sharp Objects is a close second.  This is the story of a girl who's Mother is too horrible to have the title of 'mother'.  As a result of her mother's treatment she flees to a job in journalism in another city, but is drawn back 'home' to cover the brutal deaths of two little girls.  This book has suspense, tragedy, romance, and a big surprise ending!!!<br />One line from the book that has stayed with me:  \\"When I am home I feel like a bad person.\\"<br /> The roles we play in a family and the 'tags' we place on family members!  What a mess we make by doing so!!<br />I highly recommend this book and every book that Gillian Flynn has written.<br /><br />Correction:  Gillian Flynn has written four books...somehow I missed 'Cry Baby'.  Adding it to my Kindle immediately!!<br />UPDATE:  Cry Baby is the same book as Sharp Objects!!!  Confusing!
B007J4T2G8|3.0|Decided to read due to recommendations. BUT in my opinion was not very interesting. The romance in it was there, but it was repetitive. I did not like the fact that Mr Grey was an abusive  lover.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|Funniest movie i've seen in a while. one of the tops so far. i especially like fat amy.....or fat jennifer whichever one she is.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|Perfect. Simply funny nothing like it.<br />Nothing can beat his books.<br />The third wheel shares it is not easy to get a date
B0064TVQ5E|1.0|I play Mahjong a lot, but this was not like the ones I am used to playing.  The board was small and cumbersome.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|What a Great series, with wonderful actors. Can't wait for the next show. The setting is beautiful and the characters either make you want to love them or hate them.
B003O86FMW|4.0|Cannot wait for the next book.  Great suspense and page turner.<br />Collins does it again.  Her characters will be forever known.
B00992CF6W|3.0|Redstone can apparently be mined with an iron pick, but it doesn't drop anything? Do you have to use a diamond pick?  Can't seem to even find diamond =/
B0063IH60K|5.0|I'VE ALWAYS LIKE TO PLAY SOLITAIRE WITH CARDS, BUT THIS IS FASTER AND NO CARDS REQUIRED.  I WOULD  URGE ANYONE WHO LOVES SOLITAIRE, TO TRY THIS GAME
B004ZY0VHY|5.0|This book opens the mental health aspect of mass shootings.  It shows the helplessness of families and the pain that they go through for years.  A must read if you want to consider the real reason for these crimes-mental illness. Life changing and horrific. A must read.
0307596885|5.0|This is a splendid collection by the world's pre-eminent short story writer.  The delivery was fine, and I have already given one of these books to a friend and may continue to do so.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|This is a challenging game with a nice variety of layouts. AWESOME job creating a fun challenge. I enjoy each division and the levels within each.
0385536828|4.0|This is a fine novel by one of England's best writers.  It does not live up to either Atonement or Saturday, but the intricacies of the plot make it very worthwhile.
1439152799|5.0|My second Kate Morton book and I loved it! I wanted to visit the castle and meet the Sisters Blythe myself. Loved the twists the plot took and how all the events were so connected. I am sad that I've finished reading it but look forward to the next of her books on my list.
B005LAJ16I|5.0|This is the best show currently on television, both in terms of plot and characterization.  I ordered this for my brother;however, I have not heard how his is liking it.
B001D8W7CW|5.0|Très beau film ! La fin est grandiose confirmant le savoir-faire du réalisateur ! Sissy Spacek est magnifique et envoutante.
B001FB4VZS|5.0|I just love the show and the disk were in great condition and a great price even with the shipping
B00321MGPG|5.0|I highly recommend getting the HD versions for the planet earth episodes. It's worth every penny ($15). You will find both versions in the player make sure you start the HD ones.
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|This has to be one of the tragedy games ever. G5 has gone out of there way to creat a brest game
0679809015|2.0|The cover of this book was damaged, bent and scuffed up on the corner. I was disappointed but did not return as it was a christmas gift.
B001E5CH0G|5.0|my absolute favorite movie, when you are having even the worst of days you will always have a brighter look, even if it's not December. it just makes me happy!!!
B008XG1X18|3.0|I have no problems with this app, I just prefer using my computer when I want to go to pinterest..
B008QTV3X0|5.0|Just started watching Season 1 when we had a free weekend of Showtime on cable. Took me awhile to get into the show but now am hooked. Watched the last 4 episodes through the Amazon Video Library
B006LSZECO|5.0|Gillian Flynn is such an awesome author.  I love the darkness in her books. There were so many twists and turns and nothing was really that predictable. As the reader I kept being pleasantly surprised.
B0021L8V0W|5.0|This is a great action filled movie that will keep you guessing until the very end. You've got to watch it a few times to &#34;click&#34; everything.
B0086700CM|4.0|I like the game.  It is fun.  I am not very good at it.  My eighteen year old is glad that I have it.
B004IFYN2E|5.0|This movie will keep you guessing, it's great, and for the most part pretty clean. Hope you get to enjoy it too:)
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I use this app all the time.  It is so convenient to have it on my Kindle Fire...much easier to read than using it on my phone!
B007V2UGPE|3.0|I lost all progress, all money, and all Glu credits switching from kindle fire to kindle fire hd.  This translates into a lot of cash I've spent on the game and nothing to show for it.<br /><br />I would not give more than three stars until a method of backup is provided.
B0085Z8F4A|4.0|Alien is my favorite film.  I saw Prometheus in the theatre and didn't care for it, but since I love Alien so much. I figured I needed to give this a second chance.  Still didn't like it.  But lots of extras make this DVD worth having, and it's a great transfer of a very pretty to look at movie.
B00A8ECU24|2.0|Fun for my girl, but you can end up paying a $100 or more with just a couple taps on your tablet...super sketchy!
B008IJTFYW|5.0|I use this on my Kindle while doing homework or resting and it is great! I love being able to create nice background noise while studying, it is less distracting than music and is relaxing at the same time.
B003JJA59K|1.0|The Road is a lousy unengaging film. I like dsytopian movies but this one leaves out too many details and leads one to believe that there is no hope of survival for the human race.
B00433SVP6|5.0|Loved it loved it loved it!<br />I absolutely adore these books by Rick Riordan!!!<br />If you love the Greek gods, mythology and fantasy, it's the perfect book for you!
B00AHSIQWE|5.0|This is one of the best commentaries on both the darker and better side of humanity. There are many layers of consideration for facets of humanity that break stereotypes. The portrayal of the joker is by far the most flat out genius you'll ever see. Great film.
B004QX07G4|5.0|I loved this book!!!  Very funny!  I laughed out loud several times.  I will read all of her other books! :)
B009FZHYKU|5.0|WD is the best show on TV period. I have always liked thriller sci-fi type shows but this takes the prize. It's the only zombie show period but also has a well written plot which is almost always lacking in any zombie film.
B00A9V2JSG|5.0|Really enjoyed the world of Delirium. A must read for anyone who is a fan of dystopian societies.  Lauren Oliver is a fantastic writer and has penned an amazing story that will keep you turning the pages eager to see what happens next.
B003KRJNBW|5.0|This is fantastic movie. It is truly original with plot twists that you cannot guess. It is one of the few movies that comes from Hollywood where the protagonist is not a white person. Hollywood usually spurns minorities for lead roles. I loved it.
B006PHD0RW|5.0|Fun app for kids and adults alike!!  Easy to pick up and intuitive controls.  Strongly recommend this game.  Works great on the kindle for.
0061928356|4.0|Like a history lesson about India.  I felt the ending left the reader hanging.  For the child to spend so much time looking for her parents and then ignore them when she found them didn't make sense to me.
B005LAIHQS|2.0|Poor story line,not funny like the earlier  #1 and  #2..missing the point..<br />Acting is poor.<br />Poor story line..<br />boring..<br />Where is the pug??It made the show...
B003O86FMW|5.0|Awesome Book couldn't put it down. Can't wait to read the next book of the series. Highly recommended this series.
B006LSZECO|4.0|What I loved most about this book is that you never knew what was going to happen. Totally unpredictable. Very good read! Never got bored.
B004P8JPS6|5.0|Lee Child has become my favorite writer in this genre..  He has a very readable style, and a fascinating mind.
B00AAQRNQ8|4.0|I got this mouse for Christmas for my new laptop and I was impressed. It does not feel cheap like most $20 mice and it is very responsive. The programmable buttons are great and do their job just fine. Mostly.<br />Cons: The front middle button is loose and if you shake the mouse you can hear it bounce around which is a little concerning for only having the mouse for a few weeks. But the button does still work so not much of a problem. Also, regarding the custom lighting: it is great to tell what profile you are on but the only light that changes is the logo. This was a small letdown but nothing too big.<br />Overall I really like this mouse and for the price you cannot beat it.
B008FTAAG2|3.0|Five stars rate is not adequate to evaluate this work.<br />It is really good, but four stars, just under the perfection is too much, three stars is too low.<br />In any case this album is a very good puchase!
B00ATSBIIG|5.0|I've played a few puzzle games from Big Fish and this one is by far the best!<br />The textures of the different packs, the challenge modes and the trophies all enhance the experience.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I could not put this book down and wasn't prepared for the tissues I needed at the end of the book. Definitely a must read!!
B007BVOEPI|5.0|Loved the books and can't wait for next release.  Interesting background but kinda dark.  The video follows the books very well.
B00A9X9TIW|4.0|I wasn't sure what to expect with this movie but the trailer looked good enough to give it a try.<br />I have to admit I was pleasantly surprised. The story was very interesting if a little unbelievable, and by that I mean why is it the criminals have access to the technology and not the military. Seemed very odd. Still it was enjoyable and I personally liked the ending, not quite what I expected. Well worth a watch.
B009VB97EY|5.0|Better than the female version, think it was called &#34;Showgirl&#34;.  Better cast, wish the others did more dancing.  How there is a 2nd one in the works.  Loved Mathew
B00338QENI|5.0|Skloot does an amazing job telling the story of Mrs. Henrietta Lacks and her family. The authenticity of the story is strengthened through the use of the family members' and other characters' voices. Additionally, the complicated science and ethics surrounding research was explained in plain language. HeLa became Henrietta Lacks in the pages of this book. If you want to learn about Mrs. Lacks, trying to understand research ethics or you simply want to read a good book I recommend this book.
B008BDZOZY|2.0|The advertisements of the CD &#34;Love This Giant,&#34; captured my interesr and curiosity, specificslly in regare to the codition of the face of the lady in the photo. My curiosity was not satisfied, nor did the music charm me, largely due to my poor hearing.  Nobody's fault but my own  Mollie F Howard, El Paso, TX
B007W8S2MG|5.0|Fantastic game. Very in depth and you actually feel a good connection with the characters. Sometimes it can be a little frustrating, but generally it's just a hard game (on higher difficulties), that expects some level of grinding. Graphics are colorful and funny. Music is a little weird, but totally Japanese.
B000F8O35U|5.0|Got this for daughter, her favorite when younger,  and granddaughter to enjoy.  A real hit at Christmas!  many hours of enjoyment.
B003ODIZL6|4.0|I read it  and don't need it any more and need it deleted<br />Please show me how to delete something that I don't need<br /><br />any more.
B008IGP8RI|2.0|Not the type of music I was led to believe was on the CD.  Plan to give it away. Any takers?
B005CRQ3NY|5.0|This was a great book. It is full of detail. If  you want a good book, Diary of a wimpy kid is for you
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Just loving this series.  Worth every penny!!!  Excellent acting and script, Girl Friend you were right to recommend. Cant wait for Season 3
B003E8P9G0|5.0|an exelent twist between egyption mytholgy and modern adventure. riordans best book since battle of the labrynth. i personall can't wait for his next book.
B00A0R0CG0|5.0|Very enjoyable movie. Beautiful picture on the Kndle Fire HD! It is funny, and inspiring! My daughter (15) loves it as well!!!!!
B00A8ECU24|5.0|I LOVE THIS GAME!!!!!!! IT'S THE BEST APP GAME EVER CREATED AND RELEASED!!!!!!!! Don't listen to the one star and two star reviews. It's just them bitching about how they spent money on extra jewels and coins. And how they are stupid enough to buy them or have their kids buy them.
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|Nicholas Sparks does it again. A wonderful story of reunion and a reminder of the power of first love, no matter how long it has been. I was surprised by the ending, expecting it to go another way than it did. I was a bit confused by the supernatural twist in the story at first, but it all made sense in the end. A great read that I would highly recommend.
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS GAME!!!! IT IS SOOOOOOO ADDICTING!!!!!!! AND IT'S FREE!!!!!! YOU GOTTA BE CRAZY TO NOT GET THIS GAME!!!!!!!!!!
B001HNE3NO|5.0|I love historically based books and as sad as this story was I simply couldn't put it down. I found myself crying along with Sarah as she went through the terror of Nazi segregation, concentration camps and the horror of being separated from her family at such a young age. I also cried with Julia over her struggling marriage and the decision she must make (don't want to spoil it). I love how the two stories overlap one another and come together in the end. I would recommend this book!
0062082353|4.0|This book has good content, but is cheaply made.  Uneven cuts, poor binding.  But good read.  .............. Wonder about their minds
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|After finishing the Twilight Series I jumped right in to Hunger Games. I read all three books straight through, unable to put them down. It was refreshing to see a strong female character in Katniss and a book not revolving around sex. The only thing I didn't like was in the third book I started wondering how many times Katniss would get injured without dying.... but overall fantastic trilogy.
B003K1EYM6|5.0|I ordered this for my husband's iPad.  He takes it to his deer lease to download pics from his game cam instead of hauling a lap top, works perfectly.
B007TNS6JI|5.0|Awesome it will blow your mind the best graphics and good weaponry and armor for your info I would download and play find me on gameloft at blackwarriorky
B000K1P66W|5.0|I think this book speaks differently to everyone. I have read it several times and continue to learn from it. I have shared this book with others as well, some have found it life changing while others didn't receive the message. It is an easy read...I think if you take your time to absorb the lessons and practice them it can change your life.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|The plot got dull halfway through the book. Seemed to just continue on without anything really interesting happening. Would not recommend to many.
B0076DELIG|5.0|This book is as good as all of the Harry Bosch novels they are alway<br />good. I would recommend this book.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|Great add-on to the series I'm looking forward to reading more books Dr poo m you as well<br />Keep up the good work Kinney!
B005LAIH2W|4.0|I'll admit to being a RGB fan and I've looked forward to some studio tackling the Mars stories. I thought it was a nice update of Burroughs characters which didn't lose the essential nature of those characters. A fun adventure. It's what Mars really should be. As a teen first reading Burroughs the women were alright. As an adult, of course they are not. I was happy to see that the &#34;incomparable&#34; Dejah Thoris is  an interesting and intelligent scientist/warrior/princess in the film. Even more incomparable than the original. Great sense of fun in the film!
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I saw the movie and I need to know more, about  the story.  Thing left out of the movie.<br />I like the story, in books
B003THHIEM|5.0|Season one will just entice you to watch the entire five seasons.  I am totally hooked!  Go ahead and take my Castle challenge and see if you agree.  Follow Beckett and Castle through the progression of solving crimes and their involvement personally.
1451624468|4.0|A very interesting and informative book.  However, it does not really explain how something comes from nothing.  It just says that it does.  Krauss uses this book to try to provide evidence that there is no God.  Unfortunately, everything he says in this book is irrelevant to whether God exists or not. The universe coming from \\"nothing\\" vs. God coming from \\"nothing\\" is an equal argument. The book is great for information about cosmology but would have been better if not used to try to push an athiestic agenda.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I log in on my Kindle and my iPad and my laptop! LOL! I highly recommend it for anyone who loves Facebook!
B009A87X80|5.0|If only cancer hadn't taken this beautiful, gifted woman over 18 years ago, EVERYONE would know who she is.  I only found her and her story by accident on YouTube.  I haven't felt compelled to buy a cd in a while...until I found this treasure.  I thank everyone who has brought her music to us.
B0082Z1CVQ|5.0|I AM SORRY , I HAVE NOT READ THIS BOOK AST YET. I KNOW HOWEVER THAT IT WILL BE GREAT. I DID READ IT WHEN I WAS YOUNG. I AM ALMOST 82 NOW AND HAVE MACULAR DEGENERATION, SO IT TAKES ME ALONG TIME TO READ A BOOK.
B00A9X9TIW|5.0|I was pleasantly surprised, I thought it would be more of a popcorn movie, but I thought the ideas and plot were very interesting and thought provoking, a pleasant reflection on time travel.
B003NTSBUG|5.0|When you combine Scorsese and DiCaprio, you are bound to have fine results.  Atmospheric, intense and visually stunning, the opening scene sets the spooky tone that pervades this movie.  I read the book also, and the movie does not disappoint.  This film is not driven by special effects, it is driven by the story, something I miss in many films.<br /><br />Anytime DiCaprio is on screen you can look no where else.  His intensity came through, as in all his films, in the character.  Honestly, I do not think anyone else could have played his part.<br /><br />Scorsese?  What can I say that begins to heap enough praise on this filmmaker?  Even in the film The Age of Innocence the deft touch of a master is evident, so too in Shutter Island.  While I prefer live theater, the advantage of film and literature is the freedom to go back and look at the entire opus (body of work) of an actor(male or female) or director.<br /><br />I recommend this movie to people who like puzzles, mysteries, those interested in mental health, and most of all, to those who just enjoy fine Cinema.
030758836X|1.0|Do you want to spend hundreds of pages reading a book that leaves you feeling like your finger nails have turned to vomit, the oxygen has left your heart and there is no hope for anyone?  If so, then this is the book for you!  The characters are damaged and evil, consistently underwhelm,  are completely unrealistic, and are repeatedly disappointing.  Why would any author choose to create, live with, write about such useless garbage?  The icing, if you can stand to read this long, is at the end when the author advises her real life son to hold off on reading this book for a little while and stick to his kid books.  Are you kidding???  DO  NOT  BOTHER.  Gone Gillian.
B008OOYALE|4.0|Very cool game but does keep force closing on me alot. Love all the different dragons but wish it didnt cost so much for habitats.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|We have used a paper daily Bible reader  for many years,  but find this app very convenient,  especially when traveling.  Really like the feature of being able to make notes.
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|My husband and I always look forward to watching the next episode.  We hope there will be another season next year.
B005S9ELM6|2.0|This movie attempts to prove the moral superiority of Hollywood over Iranians, portraying the latter as a subhuman species that we all hope Our Big Chief will do something about. Just to remind us that we can never have enough covert authoritarianism, the CIA is promoted to a role that some claim is untrue. Viewers who swoon at the kindly charm of the Alan Arkin movie producer are prescribed a few sniffs of \\"What makes Sammy run\\" to recover their senses. It also shows what happens to Ben Affleck after he leaves Charlestown where he gave a similar mediocre lead performance. Here, he has sprouted a big black beard. My goodness, how soon we forget that in those days we all looked like terrorists!<br /><br />One suspects that this film is serving some hush-hush interests in stirring up fear of Iran; technically speaking it sure does a good job of that, the well directed riot scenes, shot in Turkey, made my wife hide under the covers.<br /><br />But never mind, children, it's only \\"based on a true story\\", not actually true. Whadoes \\"based on\\" mean anyway?
B008JGSM6G|4.0|I like this game its great for when I'm bored and need something to do. the only thing I don't like is how you can earn hints that you have to buy them and that it costs a $1. it needs something to work for to not just the next lvl.something like a plot would me nice.
B007V2UGPE|4.0|if you like army of darkness defense you will like this. looks like you might have to spend money closer to the end but we will see
034580404X|1.0|ok, the reviewers are right--the writing is atrocious, the characters are tiresome and stupid (all Ana does is bite her lip, squirm, and blush)(plus she is apparently suffering from Multiple Personality Disorder, judging by the amount time she spends interacting with her inner goddess and subconscious), the sex is strictly generic  romance-novel cliches, and the B&D strictly white-bread.  that said, I'm having a lot of fun picking out the most atrocious phrases and laughing at them with my boyfriend!<br /><br />one thing bothers me though:  I worry that young women will confuse submitting to a brooding, damaged \\"hero\\" with putting up with a bunch of bullying from a jerk in real life...
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Really enjoying this series, but very frustrated with the Amazon app for iPad.  It keeps closing without warning, and more often than not, even when I choose the option to continue where I left off, it starts the show from the beginning!
B005K0HDGE|5.0|The book was fantastic and well written. In the beginning I had a hard time catching up but the book had so many twists I couldn't put it down. I was surprised how it ended but loved it.
145470246X|5.0|Love the beautiful designs from a very talented bead artist who also happens to be a physician.  The book is nicely presented, too.
B00AYB1RGG|5.0|I loved the new dredd movie! Just a good old action movie that dosent spend to much time filling in back story or trying to explain the whole dredd universe in one movie. It just throws you into the action right away with dredd and his rookie fighting for there lives in mega city one. Karl Urban is a very convincing dredd, you can tell he spent a lot of time perfecting the dredd scowl.<br />Watch and enjoy
B008XBCJ34|5.0|Awesome blu-ray flick in 3D. Home 3D has really improved.  The 3D dimension, color and sound is like being at a movie.
B00932A6G4|4.0|I liked this movie, a little more true to the books and the cg is amazing. It is Worth watching
B005K0HDGE|5.0|cool style of writing.  its hard to take a subject that everyone knows the ending too and make it so the reader doesnt know how it will end.
B007XELMO4|4.0|If you have a sturdy day pack i.e.,one with the requisite shoulder strap buckle at the top and hip belt (not hip strap), this bit of gear will free your hands while letting you carry your dSLR conveniently.  I use it with my largest lens (55-200mm) and while it does add weight to just one side of your load, you can offset it easily with a water bottle on the other; not sure I'd use it with a really heavy telephoto lens. Know that the Strap Shot uses a special plate that screws in to your camera's tripod mounting hole, so if you normally use a quick release mount for your tripod, you'll have to replace it with this gizmo's plate. Know that company also has an adapter that lets you use both, IF you use one of the tripod mounts they support. This adapter is pricey, IMO, but it does provide a complete solution is you take your tripod along. If not, the Strap Shot is a great way to carry your camera on a hike for handheld shooting. You can watch a video of how this product works on the manufacturer's website, along with their other products. Their customer support was quick to answer my questions as well.
1419705849|5.0|My daughter is a book a holic!  She read this book in a matter of hours.  It is great as are the others in the series.
B005EVVESM|5.0|It's a new CD - why do I have to write this stupid amount of words, anyway?  Ridiculous, I think.
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|I can not believe how much better the movies look in Blue Ray...even the sound is better!  My husband (and kids) loved it!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game.what makes this game so fun is that you have to really challenge yourself to do better and better all the time.
1449410243|5.0|This book is very funny and you can not help but laugh out loud!  I recommend it for a laugh!
B0063GORYU|4.0|Great way to pass the time. Well designed interface, and the tap feature really speeds up play. My favorite card game
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Second time reading this magnificent book. I haven't gone a day without sharing this book. It has done wonders for my relationship.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this is awesome. it is a really fun game.  it seems realistic. the graphics are really good. it is a blasr!
B007I2BZIE|5.0|Aging rock group still can produce and they even maintain the solid driven rock sound<br /><br />Some excellent medloic mix in this album too
1419705849|5.0|the kids love this book.  if your kids like to read . it easy for them to read and have fun reading
B001IBIHQ4|5.0|I am a retired high school librarian (media specialist) and have become interested in American history.  I am learning so much through media that I missed  in my school years & I think others have also.  We owe so<br /><br />How the producers ever made this as realistic as it is is amazing.  I have seenBand of Brothers & find Pacific much better.  Through this, I have been reading books written by the main characters.  I so appreciate those involved, Spielberg, Hanks, & all the others involved.<br /><br />I could go on & on, but enough to say I recommend it to every American.
B001UV4XIS|5.0|It's of very good quality, I love harry potter I've watched online all harry potters except for this one which is why I only ordered for this.
B0086700CM|4.0|its really good but the second one is more fun and challenging. if u haven't totem this one get this one first then maby a week later or once u get faster get the second one
B008AK8FHM|5.0|This book reminded me what my soul knows is true there are no mistakes and the only thing real is love. It is well written and can speak to people of all beliefs.  God loves all of us and this book shares that message in a way that puts life in perspective.
0345803485|1.0|I think this book was not what I like reading. I read just a little and was not feeling I should read anymore. for I really think a Christian needs to stay away from that kind of books. I burned it so I would'nt have it in my home any longer. When I fight started hearing about this book. I heard that Dr Oz read the book and said he like it , well I thought it was going to be one. Well I think everyboby was wrong on that book
0385535147|1.0|I couldn't wait to get my library copy of The Racketeer.  The first half of the book was so interesting and really had me rooting for the Malcolm Bannister character.  I was really hoping that when he got out of prison, he would find a way to make contact with his son, and through doing that, have a hard time not getting caught by the bad guys.  Unfortunately Malcolm turns out to not be such a stellar guy.  The ending is so disappointing, I do not want to ruin it here by talking about it.  However, even towards the end, I kept thinking John Grisham is going to pull this through somehow and make it a great book.  Nope.  I put it down and said, \\"Well that was a waste of a week of reading\\".  I really don't recommend this book.  If you want a good recent read, I highly recommend \\"The Last Man\\" by Vince Flynn.  That one had me captured from beginning to end.
B002JIEYL2|5.0|I love the original Black Sabbath (first 5 albums). I guess one either loves them or hates them. Great album in my opinion.
B008R9QAY6|5.0|I heard this opera in a concert performance and the singing is just wonderful. Anyway, five countertenors in one performance make for a special event. The recording is true to the live performance.
B0072GPQNG|3.0|Good story but for a Spilberg movie ,it drags and moves too slowly . This has been on the satillite ,but like in the movie theates it did not last so that is why I gave it 3 stars .Amazon did its normal good job of getting it to me by its delivery date ,so that is why I shop with them ,and save money as it is cheaper than the retail stores.
0061692042|3.0|If I wanted to be sexist, I would say that this book couldn't have been written by a woman.  The protagonist, Dell Parsons, narrates the story almost totally without emotion.  He could have been telling about watching paint dry, for all the feeling he expresses.  Is this a male thing?  So much happens to him, and yet Dell comes off as nearly emotionless.  The premise of the book is interesting, and yet the telling can be stultifyingly boring.  There's so much repetition and description and exposition.  I found the second half of the book more interesting than the first, and yet even then I wasn't fully engaged.  I knew I would finish it to find out what happened, but sometimes it was hard slogging.
B00A8SPNYW|4.0|I haven't gone too far yet but am enjoying the game; I understand it does become more challenging as you progress. The mouse is really cute!!
B00ANIEOH4|5.0|Season 8 of Criminal Minds has been great and the best part so far has been the love story for Dr. Spenser Reid and Maeve. The most recent episode of the show, \\"Zugswang,\\" was incredible and beautifully bitter-sweet as Dr. Reid finally gets to see this woman he loves; yet are they able to finally be together?
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|This game is pretty awesome. I wasn't expecting it to be but yeah. I would recommend that you download this game.
B00AKL1XPU|4.0|It's a great game but the only reason I gave it 4 out of 5 stars is because the app crashes often.
B008TRUDAS|5.0|I really really loved this book. I was hoping it would last me more than a day because it was just SO GOOD!!! I fell in love with Will right along with Layken. It was an amazing love story that I will not soon forget. Wonderfully written & intriguing in so many ways . A true love story.
B00785P2QC|4.0|like the game love staying busy and the fact you earn money even when your not playing.Being able to build feels like your accomplishing something. for a free game it's one of the best
B004GUSG4M|5.0|I'm a mom of 2 young children and I value my sleep, but I stayed up until 3:30 am finishing this book because I couldn't put it down!  Fascinating use of flashbacks, exciting twists....I highly, highly recommend it.
B00AYB0TOW|1.0|Wouldn't watch it again if Amazon paid me! Terrible acting and story. About the same as the first Dredd movie.
B000FC1RCI|5.0|I love Agatha Christie and this book is one of my favorites.  It is a fun, easy read. A 5 star book for sure!
B005LAIIKI|2.0|Poor jews in \\"Bastards\\" with Pitt, poor blacks with another \\"star\\" Dicaprio... What's in the next movie? Poor gays with Depp?
B007BVMVDU|5.0|One of the best shows EVER!!!!!!  Can't wait for the next season!!  &#60;3 &#60;3 &#60;3 &#60;3 &#60;3 &#60;3 &#60;3 &#60;3
B007MB5OCE|5.0|It's a story you have to put aside your believable values and just enjoy.  The 100 yr. old man is a delight.  His adventures are<br />funny and intriguing at the same time.  You never know just what will happen next.  It is a book to remember and perhaps re-read again and again.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|I really enjoyed this game.  It took a while to complete so it provided many hours of entertainment.  The puzzles were challenging but not impossible and could be skipped; there were plenty of hidden object scenes and a bit of spookiness.  I'm looking forward to the sequel.
B008FPOIT6|1.0|The preview led me to believe that this book would be unique in its topic and placed in San Francisco with the Google people as part of the story.  However, it was filled with detail that was somewhat annoying and out of the storyline.  The ending was<br />worse than imagined.  Overall, a waste of my time.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book was very captivating, easy to read, and very entertaining. I would encourage others to read this book, because the ending is something you would never expect.
B002ZG976U|5.0|I watch this over and over. I enjoy the music and dancing and there really is a good story. Great Movie
B0091REZMW|3.0|it is a game that you need to find over and over all the things and are missing, it is ok until you get out of coins and u need to but them with real money for $ 5. i think that it is too expensive for a game to pay. i deleted it./
B004LWZWGK|4.0|Whether or not you've seen all the movies (it does help), this movie had great action. and a fitting ending.
B005LA3Z9M|5.0|Couldn't put it down, a beautifully sculpted journey. I loved the characters, especially Victoria and her inner turmoil. A great read.
B000FC12C8|4.0|A simple approach to the complex world of investments. Very impressive differentiation between speculation and investing. I suggest it to all who is about to increase his wealth.
B005GRTNXC|5.0|This is her best album!  I can listen to this album all the way through. I hope that it will be released in the US because people need to hear this.
B001794FOK|5.0|I thought this was a fun movie with a creative plot.  And Hayden Christensen actually does a good job here, so don't judge his acting by the Star Wars movies (any director that can make Samuel Jackson look bad is just a bad director, and that's basically what old Georgie has become).
B005CRQ2DK|5.0|This book is great. The whole diary of a wimpy kid  series has been great, and any child who can read a chapter book should try the series out.
0446580848|5.0|Unbelievably real trip to the worst part of the world. Corey is at his best and the bad men are real. I hope the US has real heroes like these.
0307352145|4.0|Interesting way for us to look at the world and the way we lead and understand those who work around us
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Very well written. Deals openly with feelings that people are faced with in real world!  Author did a great job of not making you feel something for the pain this young man suffered to bring him to his present situation. Very emotional.  Wish the story kept going.  Didn't want to see it end.
B001N8V7KA|5.0|Clint Eastwood was great in this...as he always is!!  I have enjoyed following him through the years.  I know this is an older movie, but he is very good.
B00785P2QC|4.0|Ifr you are a fan of games like Granville then this is a pretty good one. a Too bad it links everything to Facebook.a
B00936A0ZW|5.0|Well the last solo efforts were good and great listening, but this latest effort has been the best piece of music that graced my player in along time. Not saying that I have not have heard some dynamite stuff recently, but this release had my ears dancing and head jumping for joy.<br /><br />If you a musician stop reading this and purchase this CD immediately. This band is absolutely incredible. The imagination, the excitement, and the overall virtuosity is simply mind blowing.<br /><br />But what puts the cake in the oven, is the mesh between Gilbert and Lang. The drum playing is extraordinary, very modern, hip, and there is no mistaking who sits in the captains chair. Add Gilbert's phenomenal playing, and a supporting cast that is rock solid that adds definition and bottom it is nothing but musical bliss.<br /><br />This will sit right next to my GHS3 CD. I am pleased that music of this caliber can reach my CD player. I just hope more continue to come our way.
B0073PZIYI|5.0|Surprisingly good movie.  Interesting, clever and poignant plot.  Fun and beautiful visuals.  I would watch it again!  Recommend it for sure.
1476719071|5.0|I really, really love these intense, dramatic, contemporary romances. Some are better than others and this one is definitely near the top of the list. Travis is everything I enjoy in the bad boy leads. He's hot, he's exactly what a girl shouldn't want in her life and he's got a sweet side that only the most dedicated and worthy girl will ever learn about. Thankfully, while he didn't always use his brain (typical), he wasn't a complete overprotective, angry jerk. He had his moments of course, but for the most part he didn't flip out at the smallest things freaking out both the female lead and those around them, only to beg for forgiveness later.<br /><br />Abby was also a breath of fresh air, when she wasn't being a complete dummy. She wasn't little miss innocent, even though she was trying really hard to be. I wish she had let out her true self earlier in the book and been more open and honest with those around her, but I've been in her shoes before. Trying hard to be someone you're not because you think people, including yourself, will like you better. You try to run from your past and yourself and it just doesn't work. Abby could have saved everyone a lot of pain and trouble if she had realized that sooner, but then we wouldn't have had such an amazing book.<br /><br />There were also some fun side characters in this book. Abby's best friend America is a hoot and I hope we get to see more of her in the future, perhaps in a novella or something. In April, Walking Disaster will be released and it will be this book from Travis' point of view. I'm pretty sure I'm going to read it, but I'm afraid it will kill some of Travis' image for me. I love me some bad boy and I hate it when they lose their edge...even when I already know they have a soft side.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|I heard so many people talking about Downton Abbey.  I decided I wanted to catch up so that I could watch season three when this season started.  Really like it.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Loved this book.  Kept me interested the whole novel.  Many surprises and I had a problem putting it down at night.
B001CVMD4M|5.0|GREAT GREAT GREAT GREAT GREAT GREAT GREAT Great. XXXXX X X XX XXX XXX XX X XXX XX XX XX XX XX XX XX XX.
B0076DELIG|4.0|I gave Harry a 4.5 this time. Book was interesting but was more interested in his love interest and daughter.  The mystery king of bottom out in the middle for me trying to solve the Snow White case.  Need to make that more adventurous.  Could predict what Harry was going to do,.
B000HIVIOW|5.0|Hollywood never makes movies like this.  It has almost no dialogue but children are inthralled by it.  It is the perfect lenght for young children and leaves you feeling that you might want to see what happens the next time he builts a snowman. The journey that the director takes you is wonderful.  It is a must see story filled with wonder and the magic of childhood.
B00ARAO720|4.0|This flick is sheer entertainment.  Bicycle couriers; when you gotta get it there today and now.  Joseph Gordon-Levitt among others,(and their stunt doubles)cycle through Manhattan with split second precision.  The viewer through the eyes of Levitts character(Wilee) follows routes of anticipated disaster or escape.  The chase scenes are hilarious at times but also remind us of the danger that cyclists face on NYC streets.  This film uses the latest digital technology employing highlighted GPS.  Premium, is the importance of the message that our hero must deliver.  Rush, is get it to its' destination ASAP.  Michael Shannon is deviously funny at times, but is down right ruthless as a corrupt cop.  Buffed up fellow messenger cyclists, Dania Ramirez and Wole Parks are part of a love triangle of sorts with Levitt.  Of the hour and thirty minutes filmed, over an hour is on bikes.  Anyone remotely interested in cycling will enjoy this movie for the stunt work alone.
B005NFW0U0|2.0|This show was great at pulling in an audience, but it felt so glum by the time it got very far into the third season. I think it kind of peaked too early and then it just felt like it was trying too hard to maintain intensity after that. I will compliment their creativity in the little twists to the story. If this story was not so deeply morbid and depressing, the twists and turns might keep my attention. Plus, it felt like they just kept trying to add more sexual stuff to make it more dramatic or something. It just ended up making the whole thing whorish and lame. Someone bring back &#34;Pushing Daisies&#34;.
0446560065|5.0|I love Simon's Cat on his website and on YouTube, and just had to get one of his books.  I couldn't put it down.  It was so funny.  I read it the first time from cover to cover.  I loved it so much I went to my local book store and ordered another one of his books.
B0084TWN9K|5.0|The book is excellent. I like both the content and the style in which is written. It has that superb quality that absorbs the reader after a few lines. Stories such as \\"Gravel\\" makes you feel that you've had a brush with genius. Sometimes, however, in certain stories --thanks goodness very few-- the reading turns difficult; it happens when the story looses clarity in favor of too much wordiness. I gave the book 5 stars because the author is a master storyteller. She takes a simple autobiographical anecdote and converts it into pure gold.
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|I was initially skeptical of the whole Jane Watson thing, it seemed like cheap pandering (later found out it was far from the first time it had been done... Which is sort of disturbing), but the characters are well written, there is excellent chemistry and Johnny Lee Miller makes an EXCELLENT modern day Holmes.  The actin is great, writing is really good, it's worth the download, I've already watched several episodes more than once!! This is one of my favorites.
B002BWP49C|5.0|Fantastic!!!!!!!<br /><br />Been a Twilight mum from day one beautiful and superb story go Edward! sad that its all come to an end but Stephanie Meyer has out done herself totally thank you. :)))))
B004LWZWGK|2.0|Where do I start with this movie?<br /><br />!Spoilers are ahead !<br /><br />Batman gets with Catwoman.....after how hard she sold him out? SHE NEARLY HAD HIM KILLED BEFORE BEING IMPRISONED.<br /><br />Batman has enough time to paint a gigantic flaming bat on a bridge while people are literally being executed on the hour? Way to go, bats !<br /><br />The Rocky style training in the prison was a joke, culminating in Wayne smashing the TV Bane had put in there for him. Watching this scene was painfully embarassing.<br /><br />Only a teenage girl (and Bruce Wayne ) have been able to make the prison jump to freedom? Wow, not saying alot for all those hardened criminals. What a joke.<br /><br />Lets send 90 pct of the police force into the sewers !!! Really?<br /><br />What the hell was the point of the airplane scene at the beginning? To show Bane could double as agent 007? They could have cut the scene out of the film and it wouldnt have been missed (like the rest of the boring first 35 or so minutes of the movie)<br /><br />I could go on, and theres much more, but suffice to say , the movie was an epic letdown that somehow managed to make over a billion dollars just by riding the coattails of the \\"Dark Knight\\" film. I have no desire to sit through this movie again, and its a real shame.
B007HGPBRC|5.0|There needs to be more\\"coping\\" type books for atheists, and this defiantly fits that criteria for me. I call it coping because that was what it helped me with as I learned of someone close to me having cancer; however, it is much more dynamic than that. Any thinking person can appreciate this work.
B00AK0X5VQ|5.0|This is a beautiful game.  Easy to play although not always easy to win a level.  Put on a pair of headphones, relax and enjoy.  It is very calming and a great way to unwind and kill time.
B0084AZXKK|5.0|I am very happy with this seller. The book arrived quickly as well as the condition it was described as.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|It is a fun and challenging and a great value for the price.  It is fun for people of all ages.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|I am very happy with this seller. The book arrived quickly as well as the condition it was described as.
B009HEJXFS|5.0|I figured this movie was going to suck because it's been awhile since the last one came out. I was way wrong. This was actually the best one out of the group. Very well put together  Would definitely recommended watching.
B0083Z3O8Y|5.0|I am very happy with this seller. The book arrived quickly as well as the condition it was described as.
B00AMBLXP8|1.0|I was asked by a friend to watch this movie. What a waste of money. This has to be one of the dumbest movies I've ever seen. My wife and I shut it off half way through. I don't recommend this at all.
B008476HBM|5.0|I am very happy with this seller. The book arrived quickly as well as the condition it was described as.
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|I have had this case for a year. I use my kindle daily, primarily for reading books and playing games although occasionally I will watch a movie or TV show. The case has held up very well over the course of the year and other than a few scratches is in excellent condition. I just looked over it carefully for tears, especially where the cover flips back and forth and found none. I frequently prop it up on the case to read and the angle is fine. It would be nice if I could make minor adjustments but I only paid $20 for it and it has exceeded my expectations.
B000JQU1VS|5.0|I am very happy with this seller. The book arrived quickly as well as the condition it was described as.
B009PNQUXO|4.0|I like having an app for Youtube, it makes it easier to use on the Kindle. My kid's and I are always looking up videos; for myself &#34;how to&#34; videos and for my kid's legos.
B0083Z6AH6|5.0|I am very happy with this seller. The book arrived quickly as well as the condition it was described as.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Wow! What a GREAT story!  I was a huge fan of Slammed and Point of Retreat and couldn't wait to read Hopeless and let me tell you it did NOT disappoint.  Well written, emotional, tragic, gripping...a story I won't soon forget.
B009X2CVXA|3.0|I have read all of Kate Morton's books and loved them all.  Whilst I enjoyed The Shifting Fog I didn't find it as wonderful as the others I have read. It seemed to ramble on a bit too much and I kept on losing interest.
B000CCD0HQ|5.0|I choose this rating cause this album cd is off the hook with the live versions in it great hyy
B0086700CM|4.0|temple run is a really fun game and is kind of like the game subway surffers. Temple run is awesome, and its free!
B008FYZIVY|5.0|Loved it!!  Period British drama that does not try to rewrite history. Prejudices that exsited are explored and not deleted to be \\"politically correct.\\"
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|This game is for the patient gamer it is fun in its own design and it<br />Provides an interesting strategy
B0054JZC6E|4.0|i thought this app was amazing. it challenged me and made me think about it. sooo much fun this app was.
B004JZBGWI|3.0|I use the &#34;Things to do&#34; list quite often to get things done orderly.  I haven't got great use out of the app just yet but I bet it will get rid of most of my desk clutter.
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|It does what its supposed to do with no crashing. Shamalamadingdong &#60;---- one word apparently I need to use smaller words to get my quota!
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Great story of war and relationships.  A reminder of how precious is our freedom and how easily it can be lost.  Enough battle strategy to keep the military mind and enough relationship story to pull the romantic.
0071390111|5.0|Doesn't matter if is your first contact with the subject or if you're trying understand more of a known issue, this book is ALWAYS the best starting point. It's my pillow book and i strongly recommend for everyone.
B008AT71WI|5.0|I loved this movie growing up and I couldn't resist buying this director's cut when it came out!  Great deleted scenes, and the original ending is hilarious!  If you love this movie, get this blu ray!
B00005N6KG|5.0|EVERY THING ABOUT THIS IS GOOD, PRODUCT QUALITY,PRICE ,VERY LIGHT WEIGHT,LATERAL HEARING PIECE DESIGN, NON BLOCKING OF OTHER SOUNDS WITHOUT LOSS OF QUALITY. THIS WAS BOUGHT TO REPLACE THE ORIGINAL SONY MDR-W** WALKMAN PHONES....THESE ARE JUST AS GOOD IF NOT BETTER....<br />PS: NEXT TIME THOUGH JUST MAKE THE CABLE ABOUT 6in LONGER..REALLY!!
B000OZ0NXA|3.0|It was an enjoyable read. Some improbable situations but just turn down the reality barometer and you'll be fine. Did not make me want to read additional Jack Reacher novels.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Lowest prices, quick downloads. Very easy to find what you are looking for.  Ties on with existing Amazon account.<br />Nice
B004EPYZZI|5.0|Love the movie but they should not have altered the theatrical version and deleted some dialog the occurred in the ambulance.
0156027321|4.0|Loved Yann Martel writing style and keen imagination.<br />Some of his graphic descriptions were too upsetting<br />for a weak stomach
B00542UMIY|5.0|Thoroughly delightful! I and my child both loved it and can hardly wait to watch the second Beverly Hills Chihuahua 2.
B00AAX68HG|5.0|This is a great game, addictive and colorful with a lot of different levels to play and levels of difficulty!
B005LJKEXS|5.0|Used this to extend my Wifi adapter (link below). Works perfectly.<br />Female end, is a very secure fit. I was beginning to think I had to take plastic piece out of the end.<br />Glad I was able to make connection, because I probably would have ruined the cable, if I took plastic piece out. So, when you think your device won't fit, keep trying, it will fit.<br /><br /> [[ASIN:B003W9TGKG Premiertek PowerLink PL-H5DN-3070 IEEE 802.11n (draft) Wi-Fi Adapter - USB - 150Mbps]]
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|great for the family<br />can't stop playing. we pass it around for family game night. plan to purchase more like it.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I'm not a big Stephen King fan, watched some of his movies, but I did enjoy this book.  Born in  1953 I remember being a kid in school being told our President was just killed.  It changed our world forever.  Reading the book really gave me something to think about.  You always wish you could go back and change something, but maybee we're not supposed to.  Learned a lot of history about Oswald and how things worked back in the early 60's.  Very worth while book.
B0055SWM08|5.0|My husband and I like to play this together.  It somehow manages to be both challenging and relaxing at the same time.
B00821OW8K|5.0|Sci Fi fans wade through long intervals for quality story lines, with quality actors, AND a budget to pull it all off.  I can over look cheap production if the first two elements are present, however Falling Skies has it all!  Story arcs are well thought out, believable characters, talented actors, great set and special effect designs.  I saw the premiere on broadcast and knew I was going to love it.  Since that time I have waited to watch the series as an entire feature.  Fantastic!  Now that Falling Skies has successfully conquered the before mentioned hurdles of Sci Fi, I deeply hope the second hurdle may also be overcome. That would be maintaining the talent that launched the series and keeping the network from interfering. ( Sorry Fire Fly ) You know producers, the fans would give money directly for the production of these quality shows. Just post the instructions.
0446554995|5.0|all the characters come together , one of their better joint ventures..  and here are the extra eight words required
0756686970|5.0|Got this for my seven year old grandson and he loves it.  Has already memorized all the characters in the book.
1451695195|5.0|This is an easy read and I highly recommend it to anyone ever remotely interested in the hereafter.  Warning: It is not written by a Christian.  The author merely states the events that happened to him and lets the reader draw their own conclusions.
B00A4B9A1U|4.0|Well constructed arguments, thoughtful insights, with many controversial view points expressed constructively & well researched.<br />Enjoyed each chapter!<br />Thought provoking & informative.
B00A72989U|5.0|I'm a fan of Alicia Keys, so my review is heavily bias. Girl On Fire has been a daily play since I picked it up. Some moments pop more than others but it's her voice and talent that keep the whole album a source of pleasure for me. Repeat play is the best way to start or wind down my day.
B009GX7IRA|5.0|Best show out there. I can watch it over and over again. I feel like I know the characters so well.
B006L1TT8G|4.0|It got here a few weeks early and I was really happy. The only downside was that there were a few scratches on the back of the case but I haven't opened it since it is a present. Hope the cd is intact.
B004SRPXWQ|5.0|It is a very funny app to get if u want some laughs on a stressful day I really enjoy it my self
B009UX2YAC|4.0|i love this game, but i dont like how you have to be on facebook to have a real account, I don't enjoy being player 48360 or player 61937 random times! this would be my all time fav app if you didn't need to be on facebook just to submit scores or have friends or have a real account... by the way I adore the changes you've made!!!!! :)
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Possibly the best novel King has ever writtenI laughed,I cried,then did both at the same time,then wished the book would never end.BRAVO!
B003F3FJQO|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. I cannot wait to start the next book, the death cure. This book made me wonder and am still wondering if Teresa is the good one or not. It will be very interesting to read the next one. This was a great book and it always kept me wondering what would happen next. If you are debating whether you should or shouldn't read this book, I think you should consider it. This is a great book.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Be prepared to be sucked in.  Outstanding characters, great story line.  Cannot wait to move on to series 3!  Bravo PBS.  I better send in my yearly donation.
1455523550|5.0|I absolutely LOVED this book! Nicholas Sparks is such an imaginative writer and it shows through the story and it feels like you can see it in your mind like a movie. It's definitely a page turner and has a few surprises along the way. I definitely recommend this book.
B002AWX6UM|5.0|I like reading books about less known historical events so when Amazon flagged this book in my recommendations it became a must read. This is the story of Ishmael's initial naive thoughts that the war would be over quickly to his continual slide down to self preservation by joining a boy soldier army. Killing became a shut-off part of his being. This is a real glimpse into what happens (and is still happening) in many parts of Africa where you must kill or be killed. Even rounding up the boy soldiers to rehabilitate them is problematic as the 2 warring factions are put together in the hope that they can live together peacefully and relearn their place in whatever remains of society. War stops, war starts again. Ishmael eventually ends up in am American home in NY where he is encouraged to write his story. It is a courageous tale and one I was profoundly moved by reading.
B007V5CF5K|1.0|Game crashes too much and half way thru the game the puzzle piece is stuck behind menu tab. Cannot finish game. I only read first 3 reviews that were good but I see now that other kindle hd users have the sane issue. Please fix.
0425263908|5.0|i loved this book it had no scratches great condition and it only took me a few days to read it omg Mr. Grey yes indeed :)
0062101897|5.0|Everything a Potterphile could want.<br /><br />I've really enjoyed the Harry Potter series, but I'm not a fan-boy who's going to automatically give anything Potter a high rating. I'm a middle aged guy who loves movies, books, and a little bit of escapist fantasy. I also do graphic design and page layout - areas in which this book really shines. The quality of the cover, the paper stock, the printing, photography, and art work are all exceptional. It's also 500+ pages and weighs a ton.<br /><br />The book covers the making of the movies, and profiles every character, creature, and artifact in the series, including some material cut from the movies (I wish I could get that artwork of an infant-like Voldemort suckling from his snake from my mind!)<br /><br />I've yet to read all the text - it took my two hours just to thumb through all the photos and artwork in the darn thing. I can understand why it has such a high MSRP, and it may be justified, but I'm not a big enough fan that I would have bought it at full price - but at the Amazon, or like-new used price, this book is a must-have for any Harry Potter fan.
B009HQ9UHC|4.0|This game will get you hooked. It is challenging and entertaining and at times frustrating, but in a good way.
B000GCFY0I|4.0|I read this book over the course of two weeks.  At first I thought it was a little slow in the beginning, but it became more action packed and interesting the more I read.
B0070Y46UY|3.0|Slow in the beginning but the story was intriguing and masterfully woven into an eventful saga.  The story was painful but realistic.
B0053TMP24|5.0|Great book<br />As good as the first four. I loved the series and can't wait to read the next one.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I could not put the book down. Really felt part of Skye,s thoughts and feelings. I loved the content and conclusion.
B008AK8FHM|3.0|PROOF OF HEAVEN was written for someone with some medical/technical knowledge. Even though the autobiographical novel was the author's experience while being in a coma. Some of the medical terminology bogged me down. This was a good book for someone researching several sources to determine what the near death process may look like from within.
B0036OS3LA|5.0|I love these boots. I have received some compliments of people that asked me about my boots. They even asked me to show it to them.  They are very comfortable too.
B000FA675C|5.0|Great book - I wish it didn't end!  And this is the 2nd time I've read it and I still found the details refreshing.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|A very well constructed story with good characters. I enjoyed very much the flower parts. I read the book in a couple of days and I had a good time.
B003V1WTMM|5.0|I love this book, the characters, and especially the shocking ending. Honestly...I didn't expect that!  I can hardly wait for the next book by Kate Morton.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|Cute love story that is a very quick read and leaves you with a feel good feeling. Predictable but still fun to read
B00APUYWYA|1.0|Lousy acting, boring story, too much like Glee. No character development. Just a pure waste of time and money. Not recommended.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Spoiler Free<br /><br />I bought a TV pass to watch this season on my Roku.  It is great without commercials and this is a strong season as well.<br /><br />Season three boldly goes where few other than Frank Darabont dared to tread in the past.  It features strong new characters with a glimpse of one of them at the end of season two.<br /><br />Certain characters will be missed; others I am glad to see go.  Carl grows up fast and is a much stronger character now.  Rick has strengthened into a decisive leader as well.
B0044RUSZM|5.0|This is the second laptop stand that I've purchased.  Perfect height and angle as well as small desktop footprint. Thanks Griffin!
B0020BUWX2|4.0|I began reading this about 2 hours prior to learning of the Newtown, CT, school shooting.  In light of such an emotional event, I was not sure I would be able to handle such a heavy subject matter.  However, as I continued reading, it was not only enjoyable, but also helpful in processing some of the emotions I was feeling.<br /><br />I was most impressed by Forman's restraint in addressing such a heavy subject.  Mia's personality was enjoyably warm, while the story structure allowed for a level of detachment that kept it from being emotionally heavy-handed.  Mia's relationship with family and friends, both positive and imperfect, was refreshingly devoid of cynicism.<br /><br />I think this book would be particularly good for parents to read with their young adult children, opening a dialog about how we approach the tragedies of life.
B004H4XDBI|4.0|Picking up three years after If I Stay ended, Where She Went explores Adam's struggle dealing with his own loss, grief and anger in the wake of Mia's accident. When Adam and Mia reunite, each must come to terms with the decisions they made in the aftermath.<br /><br />The continuity of writing style and scene selection wonderfully blend the second book into an extension of the first.  However, the mood of Where She Went is far more melancholy, contrasting moments of harmony and dissonance.  Mia, though not the direct subject, is nevertheless the emotional anchor of Adam's story.  Lawson's exploration of Adam's complexities is key to the story's success.  He is both worthy of sympathy and a cautionary tale.<br /><br />Where She Went made me think.  Adam's complexities speak to issues that no happy ending or reconciliation will magically cure, and yet there is hope.  However, this may be what is most true to life about the book and, for me, its ultimate message.
B008HK3XKO|4.0|I ended up purchasing this case with my Kindle Fire HD because (at lease when I ordered) there were not many affordable cases available. It is a great case! The profile is sleek and the sleep-wake feature is great. The elastic band that keeps it closed is secure and unobtrusive when not in use. Probably my favorite feature is that this case allows the Kindle to stand in almost any position. The front also folds back nicely, with a nice grip on the back/inside cover so it is easy to hold.<br /><br />The only reason for 4/5 versus a 5/5 is that the case smelled rather strongly when I initially received it. The leather is fake (though nice looking) and it smelled like it. However, the scent has faded and I anticipate that it will soon disappear completely.
B004YM6JLO|5.0|Love this movie,very entertaining. I would recommend it to someone who I know likes these kind of movies. I bought the three season for a friend,who I know likes vampire diaries. She loves them,said she was really enjoying them.

B009AMAMF2|1.0|I won't go into all the details of some other reviewers.  Though they do quite well.  Just to keep this short and helpful, just simply don't waste your time.<br /><br />There were some interesting things, though everything good about this unusual movie has at least two things bad.<br /><br />In the end, this movie simply doesn't work.  I wouldn't call it unintelligible, but something along the lines of fractured beyond useful as a vehicle to tell a story.<br /><br />Again, don't worry about it, just don't waste your time viewing it.  Almost anything you might do with 3 hours is better and more satisfying than watching this film.
B009UX2YAC|1.0|I turned my kindle on and it just disanstalled. I had a lot of stuff too. its all gone. sigh
B003VS0CXS|4.0|Definitely one movie to have in your collection.  Has the feel of a Disney musical thanks in part to the legendary song writing team of The Sherman Brothers. Unforgettable songs and beautiful imagery carry this film all the way!
B0068FYZ3Y|1.0|Received product, but not was described.  I was supposed to have received the 100th Anniversary edition of Inglorious Bastards, but received basic version. If this is what I wanted, I would've purchased it at Wal-Mart. .

B0059XTU1S|5.0|Where Elijah Wood played his hobbit, Frodo, as a picture of childlike innocence in a big world, Martin Freeman plays Bilbo as a flustered everyman. His essential Edwardian Englishness, based on predictability and decorum and stability, is almost the exact opposite of the dwarves he accompanies, led by Richard Armitage (who will surely become a name star behind this film). And that tension drives this story forward.<br /><br />Tolkien's mythmaking, which is perhaps less sophisticated than in \\"the Lord of the Rings\\" but no less compelling, relies on two visions of England. The dwarves, eager to reclaim their homeland, are an older, more virile England, that of Shakespeare, Wellington, and the Norman Conquests. Bilbo, with his corduroy jacket and pipe, is the inward-turning England of the years after the empire. Take away either, and England would lose its Englishness.<br /><br />Bilbo thinks the dwarves savage, unkempt, and barbaric. The dwarves consider Bilbo sedentary, effete, and useless. Director Peter Jackson plays this out longer and more explicitly than Tolkien did in his book, which took such distinctions as written. This film is about how the young man and the old man can't stand each other, even as they need each other, and the one gradually turns into the other.<br /><br />Jackson takes pains to emphasize this film's connections to his previous LotR trilogy, finding ways to incorporate sets and characters from the prior films, whether or not they were in the book. But he also distinguishes this film from the prior. Its humor is more explicit and its characters more archetypal, less gritty. And as a story involving no humans, this movie is more absolutely fantasy than Jackson's prior trilogy.<br /><br />It would have been easy for Peter Jackson to produce \\"LotR Redux,\\" and it probably would have made him even more famous. But he thankfully makes this a different movie, with its own identity and themes. He takes risks where he could have played it safe, alternates smartly between boldness and subtlety, and spends more time than before on themes. That difference is what makes this movie work so well.
B005CRQ4XI|5.0|An honest narration, full of lyrical passages and raw emotion. For anyone who appreciates great writing and understands the challenge of our endless search for meaning.
B008XBCJ34|4.0|Good but not great storyline but the cinematography was great.  I'm not sure it deserved the acclaim that it received but maybe my expectations were too high.
1250010489|5.0|I really enjoyed Zero Day and couldn't wait for more.  Wow, Trojan Horse was more than I expected.  Just like Zero Day, I couldn't put the book down.  The details and the technologies are dead on.  While it is fiction, it is extremely possible any of the scenarios in either book could actually occur.  Looking forward to a third book ... soon I hope.

B008FSCNTK|4.0|I do not understand the reviews trashing this album.  Yes - this is not classic Diana Krall singing and playing piano jazz.  Nor is this classic T-Bone Burnett.  So it took me a few plays to get comfortable with the tunes on this album - many of which I had never heard before.<br /><br />Now I play this album regularly.  This is an artfully executed fusion that takes advantage of Krall's wonderful sense of phrasing and ultra smooth voice - which she uses with a thoughtfully restrained power.  Burnett mirrors this restraint with powerful backing arrangements -- beautifully recorded.  On more driving tunes, the arrangements suggest a band that is generally being held back as it showcases Krall's singing and then cuts loose to close the deal.<br /><br />My only complaint is that the album doesn't showcase enough of Ms. Krall's piano.  But that's a small complaint.<br /><br />Thanks to Krall and Burnett for this thoughtful album.

B009IEXKXI|5.0|Very good book. It is very fuuny. I think if the Big Lebowski were a genius astronaut and stuck on Mars this book would be his story. It is true that there is a lot of long math, just blow through that fast as you read if you are not into it. Not understanding the math really will not effect the enjoyment of the story.

B00914JWSW|3.0|Not all of her song choices on this one satisfied me. She is such true talent. I have always been able to listen to this woman sing for hours at a time.
0061743526|5.0|I somehow managed to not find this book on required reading through the many different schools I attended and am most gratified that I was able to experience this with a few years of maturity added on. It's stunning to experience a book that elicits such a wide spectrum of emotion. The characters are fleshed out and practical in their roles with no trimming or additions needed. Atticus Finch is such a spectacle of honesty and integrity that , I'm afraid, it's too impossible for him to exist in real life.  Following the day- to- day activities of Scout and her slightly older brother, Jem, around for a few summers makes me wish I had the childhood and upbringing they had in this story and I feel like I'm stung with such a bittersweet feeling caught in between laughing and crying. A plot synapsis is unnecessary. The writing flows so smoothly and easily you'll be holding most of the pages in your left hand quicker than any book you'll ever read.
B000N3ST7A|5.0|Stevie's voice just drives me wild. I have always loved her sound from the first time I heard it, years ago. She could sing any song, and make it sound better than most anyone.

B0088TG252|5.0|I loved this movie.  It's hard to go too wrong when you have both Ryan Reynolds and Denzel Washington together in one movie, and I certainly wasn't disappointed by this one.  The movie was fast paced, fun, and had plenty of action.

B009GEFXLC|5.0|This is the best that network television offers, and the only program on the big three that I would watch. I get from amazon so I dont have to visit the commercials, but this program is worth watching either way.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I did like this book but I did want more from it. I am hoping the movie fills in the gaps for me.  I wish the chemistry between characters was more evident or described. I would have liked to know what Gale was thinking and feeling. I got frustrated being stuck in Katniss head the whole time.<br />But you gotta read it if you read the others.

B000OZ0NXA|5.0|Saw the movie and just had to read the book.<br /><br />Reacher, as a character, is interesting in the way that he is and he isn't interesting. There are different things about him, such as a generally serious nature, but more importantly, he isn't a generic \\"good guy.\\" He kills, takes no mercy, and generally cares little about those around him. He doesn't like being a place more than a short time and doesn't want to get close to people. Other than that, he's got a military police background and is an expert in deduction. He's got some notable skills, but other than that I didn't see much personality.<br /><br />The story is intriguing. From the opening arrest to the final scene, I enjoyed the plot twists and turns, even the ones I saw coming. It was a very interesting story and never gave up. There were no parts of the novel that I felt were added for length's sake or for any other unnecessary reason. Of course, some things I felt were weird. Big problems were solved in a second and the ending even felt kind of abrupt. His last chapter is basically a \\"this is what happened after\\" chapter which encompasses too much in such a short time frame and isn't realistic, based on the rest of the book. If you read it, you'll see what I mean. However, I prefer to suspend deep thinking when coming to novels so that I am not upset by plot twists or incorrect gun caliber facts because they do not matter. It's enjoyable, and that's all there is to it.<br /><br />I'm reading Die Trying now. I saw the movie, too. Die Trying is third person as Killing Floor is first. I find first person to be a lot more interesting, but I feel that Die Trying will probably build up to a better climax and conclusion than Killing Floor. Killing Floor's climax was the second or third to last chapter, where Reacher does his stuff, and then Child basically declares \\"PROBLEM SOLVED\\" at the end of it. Still, good book, great read.

B009MO5G90|4.0|Don't get me wrong. It was enjoyable seeing returned characters. It's just... it was as if they couldn't find new content to extend the series. The ending was when it stated getting good! Will have to wait for the next chapter. Hope they bring it to the Mansion. Just like in the video game series. There is much content there.
B005HSL626|3.0|I like it but it freezes alot.It says please connect to the inrnet alot. I hear a lot of good stuff about it.
B009D7CP2M|5.0|This is the third fiction book I've read hoping it will answer the question of why teenagers apparently snap and murder their classmates. Jodi Picoult's \\"19 Minutes\\" and Cara Hoffman's \\"So Much Pretty,\\" both fell disappointingly short for me. Perhaps these two books were simply telling stories but I was hoping they would reveal more. The author of \\"We Need to Talk About Kevin,\\" I believe, does not attempt to answer the question per se but to provide a list of plausible who-is-to-blame options in order of their likelihood: 1) The child was simply born evil, 2) The child is the product of a disfunctional family and especially a cold mother, 3) The media encourages mass murders by providing fame, audience, and competition to future murderers, and 4) Violent video games and the general inability of society to shield a child from bad influence. The reader's own preferences and personal prejudices will lead them to the explanation they find most plausible. I will note that there are a few possible explanations that the author takes off the table in order to narrow the focus and probably enhance the believability of the story: 1) Kevin is not bullied and 2) He does not use a gun for his crime. The fact that he does not use a gun is portrayed as a very systematic choice because Kevin does not want his crime to be over-shadowed by a gun control debate. But I'm getting ahead of myself.<br /><br />Most readers will agree that one of the first 2 options will provide the who-is-to-blame answer in this story, and this is of course the age-old nature vs. nurture debate. Within the first page, I couldn't stand the narrator, Kevin's mother. This almost stopped me from continuing, as the first 100 or so pages are nothing but snotty, pretentious drivel. Eva hates her fellow human beings, looks down on everyone, makes absolutely horrid observations about even her ex-husband who she claims to still love, and uses words that are too big and sentences that are too long. It's so over-the-top that I assumed this was a device. The only other conclusion would be that the author is also a pretentious snob but I do not think this is the case.<br /><br />Just because you don't care for her, you can't discount her observations. As the reader, you have to attempt to sort out the facts from her interpretation of the facts. For example, Kevin didn't talk until he was 3. When he did start speaking, he spoke in full sentences. Regardless of the interpretation as to why (was he a perfectionist? was he devious? was he withholding?) the point is he knew how to do something that he didn't let on to. Kevin forced his mother to change his diapers until he was 6! And yes, his intentions are clear as day to me though perhaps others may interpret it differently. Kevin won't give people what they want. He sneaks in eating so that he is not hungry at mealtime. Everything his mother needs in the way of results, feedback, or even feeling like she's done her motherly job, he denies her.<br /><br />He progresses to being a killjoy. Anything that anyone else delights in, he destroys. Only once does he get caught (prior to the big day), water pistol in hand destroying his mother's beloved maps. Otherwise, bad things just happen to those around him. He is adept at finding peoples' weaknesses and nursing them: turning a pretty girl scarily anorexic, helping a child with severe psoriasis scratch her face bloody, ruining a teacher's career with sexual abuse allegations, and so much more. He is interested in computer viruses because they tear down other people's hard work. There are a couple of sub-thematic diatribes in the book about how there is nothing left in life to create, the only possibility left is to destroy. Most notably, the classmates that he singles out for death are those who irritated him, and how did they irritate him? By having interests. That is it. Folks that are interested in things bother him. Even as a child, he wasn't interested in doing a darn thing. It's like he never outgrew the \\"no\\" phase.<br /><br />Even when he's not being blatantly evil, Kevin seems to enjoy making people feel uncomfortable. In complete opposition to the my-pants-are-falling-off-of-me trend, he wears his clothes too tight.  I felt embarrassed just reading the descriptions of pants not quite zipping up and shirts stretched too tight across the nipples. I suspect that in addition to thrilling in making teachers and schoolmates uncomfortable, he is also trying to cast doubts about his wealthy family.<br /><br />There is one omission to the list of possible explanations for the massacre and that is mental health. As a possibility, it is neither presented nor eliminated. I believe that the author is presenting Kevin as a sane individual, but what if he did have some form of mental illness? Kevin does confess to depression and asks for a Prozac subscription but you feel that he is only building a plausible excuse of being medicated. The narrator does seem to be building a case that her son was very deliberate and in control of all of his choices and planning, but I'm not sure if that is the same as clinical sanity. Perhaps it is.<br /><br />Eva knows that her son is very much like her. But clearly he is the worse of the 2 devils because she still wants his what? love? approval? cooperation? and he needs nothing from her except maybe an audience and another person to toy with. By her own admissions, in the courtroom she is bored, manipulative, and uncooperative. I don't think she feels victimized and if anything, she just sees this as an inconvenient fall from grace. I wonder if she regrets the deaths of Kevin's classmates. In her letters to her ex-husband, I sense a competition (only on her part as it is a one-way dialogue) that at least she was \\"on\\" to Kevin and and least he was \\"real\\" with her. This, again, makes her unlikeable to me as her thoughts and emotions are inappropriate and misplaced. Why be in a contest with the ex-husband as to who was the favorite parent of a killer? Where is the regret? What is she doing to try to make amends to society? Does she completely disassociate herself? What human being wouldn't at least feel a little badly about a mass murder even if it wasn't their fault?<br /><br />So as to the nature vs nurture question, here is what I think: it's a terrible child with a terrible mother. He came out of her womb uncooperative, manipulative, and destructive. But his mother possesses at least the first 2 characteristics, so is he the genetically cranked-up version of her?<br /><br />Just when you really can't stand the narrator, the author slightly redeems her but breaks your heart with the introduction of a sister for Kevin. Docile, obedient, \\"doormat\\" Celia is the apple of her mother's eye. If the author hadn't introduced a second, sweet, pliant, and appreciative child you may wonder if indeed Kevin is so rotten because his mother is so cold. But Celia helps to endorse the theory that Kevin is just a bad seed. With dread in your stomach, you realize that Kevin will destroy that which gives someone else pleasure, and his sister gives his mother pleasure. He maims her permanently, and the quiet accepting manner of this little girl, well, it just puts me beside myself.<br /><br />Confession: I've been writing this review as I'm reading the book. The author just dropped such a bombshell that I should go back and edit my reactions to Kevin's mother but I will leave them as testimony to the fact that the author does play with your emotions brilliantly. Now I see that she is not un-remorseful, she is shell-shocked. She has been stripped of everything that meant anything to her. The unfolding of this scene, the scene in which she discovers her 2 loved ones dead, stands in stark contrast to her factual reporting on the school massacre and its victims. As the reader, you are crushed by her discovery and it truly unfolds in horrific, dreadful slow motion. Now I see that when it comes to the schoolmassacre, she simply has no emotion left and resents having to answer for any responsibility in a courtroom when she is in the same position as the plaintiffs; she is in a position of complete and utter loss.<br /><br />I also see now that when she appears to be talking down to her husband, she is doing it in a loving, honest, and complete way. I understand and feel the same, you should not glorify the dead, true love means remembering all the flaws too. I imagined her writing condescending but unsent letters to an ex-husband who had custody over their daughter which of course is not true.  I could be wrong but I think she may even feel complicit in their murders because Kevin is so clearly her child. Her child, who has saved the worst punishment for her: to be left alive and living in the aftermath of his destruction. Does she visit her son in jail because she feels complicit or because he is all she has left of her former life? Maybe both.<br /><br />I imagine that in writing letters to her husband she herself is trying to understand how this all happened. Just as Kevin confesses at the end that he \\"doesn't know\\" anymore why he did it, she doesn't know if she is at fault. She seems to want to think that if she hadn't disliked her son or had been more defensive of him perhaps matters would have turned out differently. I doubt that, given that the father who always defended his son is portrayed as a dupe and ends up dead. She concludes her final letter with this statement: \\"I am too exhausted and too confused and too lonely to keep fighting, and if only out of desperation or even laziness I love my son. He has five grim years left to serve in an adult penitentiary, and I cannot vouch for what will walk out the other side. But in the meantime, there is a second bedroom in my serviceable apartment. The bedspread is plain. A copy of \\"Robin Hood\\" lied on the bookshelf. And the sheets are clean.\\"<br /><br />My aching heart and saddened mind strongly recommend this book as an honest and complicated answer to one of the most difficult questions we currently face. And that answer could very well be \\"We don't know.\\"favorite parent of a killer? Where is the regret? What is she doing to try to make amends to society? Does she completely disassociate herself? What human being wouldn't at least feel a little badly about a mass murder even if it wasn't their fault?<br /><br />So as to the nature vs nurture question, here is what I think: it's a terrible child with a terrible mother. He came out of her womb uncooperative, manipulative, and destructive. But his mother possesses at least the first 2 characteristics, so is he the genetically cranked-up version of her?<br /><br />Just when you really can't stand the narrator, the author slightly redeems her but breaks your heart with the introduction of a sister for Kevin. Docile, obedient, \\"doormat\\" Celia is the apple of her mother's eye. If the author hadn't introduced a second, sweet, pliant, and appreciative child you may wonder if indeed Kevin is so rotten because his mother is so cold. But Celia helps to endorse the theory that Kevin is just a bad seed. With dread in your stomach, you realize that Kevin will destroy that which gives someone else pleasure, and his sister gives his mother pleasure. He maims her permanently, and the quiet accepting manner of this little girl, well, it just puts me beside myself.<br /><br />Confession: I've been writing this review as I'm reading the book. The author just dropped such a bombshell that I should go back and edit my reactions to Kevin's mother but I will leave them as testimony to the fact that the author does play with your emotions brilliantly. Now I see that she is not un-remorseful, she is shell-shocked. She has been stripped of everything that meant anything to her. The unfolding of this scene, the scene in which she discovers her 2 loved ones dead, stands in stark contrast to her factual reporting on the school massacre and its victims. As the reader, you are crushed by her discovery and it truly unfolds in horrific, dreadful slow motion. Now I see that when it comes to the schoolmassacre, she simply has no emotion left and resents having to answer for any responsibility in a courtroom when she is in the same position as the plaintiffs; she is in a position of complete and utter loss.<br /><br />I also see now that when she appears to be talking down to her husband, she is doing it in a loving, honest, and complete way. I understand and feel the same, you should not glorify the dead, true love means remembering all the flaws too. I imagined her writing condescending but unsent letters to an ex-husband who had custody over their daughter which of course is not true.  I could be wrong but I think she may even feel complicit in their murders because Kevin is so clearly her child. Her child, who has saved the worst punishment for her: to be left alive and living in the aftermath of his destruction. Does she visit her son in jail because she feels complicit or because he is all she has left of her former life? Maybe both.<br /><br />I imagine that in writing letters to her husband she herself is trying to understand how this all happened.

B008ASLK8A|5.0|My husband loved our gift. I searched all over for the best price I could find and had to have it in time for Xmas :)<br /><br />Highly recommend this shipper
B007FEFLTO|5.0|I read the first book Fall of Giants and loved it also.  The characters are interesting plus the back drop of the wars also refreshes your historical memory without being boring. The story goes back and forth fluently between the families and brings it all together at the end. Can not wait for the third book.
B008OK4XDI|5.0|This book made me proud of who I am. It validated my strengths and my belief that it is important to have all kinds of people. I would recommend this book to all personality types. I learned so much about myself and the world. I have been recommending this book to everyone I know, especially introverts and quiet individuals.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|This was a great book, I could never really be sure about what happens next. I was so worried about Annabeth, I was hoping that she wouldn't die. I knew she wouldn't because she is an important character but still. When I got to the end of the book I was so mad. It just left me hanging. Now I have to wait until the fall for the next book! This is going to be so hard. But overall it was a really good book, I give five stars. : )

B008F9T76Q|5.0|After watching The Hunger Games and listening to a friend who had read the trilogy talk about how great it was...I had to read it too.  This left me wanting more! I so enjoyed this type of book that I had to seek out more like it.  The Maze Runner trilogy filled the bill, and then some! Wow! I couldn't put them down!!<br /><br />The Maze Runner is the first book in the trilogy.  It tells the store of Thomas who wakes up without his memory of his past, parents, or how he got where he is.  He finds himself in the Glade, a large place that is surrounded by stone walls.  Walls that open during the day and close at nite - to keep what lives outside the walls OUT. Every 30 days a new boy arrives to the Glade. But this time is different...someone new will arrive tomorrow, just one day later than Thomas....and this time, it's a girl! The first girl in two years to be sent to the Glade. The message she brings with her has everyone in the Glade fearing for the future.<br /><br />The Scorch Trials is the second book. After escaping the Glade, Thomas was sure he would get his life back, live happily-ever-after perhaps. He was wrong. The Earth is now a wasteland, burned by sun flares and filled with a new infectious disease known as the Flare. Humans with the Flare are covered with wounds that fester and are driven to murderous insanity by this infection. Thomas and some of the Gladers must now cross the Scorch within two weeks and reach the Safe Haven. If they do, perhaps they can get the cure for the Flare which they have been told they are now infected with. It is their only hope of survival, and not becomeing one of the infected - one of the Cranks.<br /><br />The Death Cure is the final book of the trilogy.  Thomas has started to get some of his memory back thru vivid dreams. And has learned he cannot trust WICKED - the people who put him and his friends thru the Glade and the Scorch. They have promised to return everyone's memory in turn for their help in curing the Flare. But Thomas is not buying it, he's been lied to so much, how can he trust anyone now. Thomas will learn the truth with the help of some of his friends...but what he learns is more dangerous than even he could have dreamed up. He will lose friends and gain new along the way.... will they live to see the Cure?<br /><br />Don't buy one book at a time...get all 3!! You will want to pick up the next immediately after finishing one. The story is so well told and keeps you wanting more! I was satisfied with the ending (for once!) but still find myself needing to read the Prequel, The Kill Order. I'm sure it can't dissappoint!  I look forward to reading more of James Dashner!<br /><br />A Must Read!<br />-smileycat :-)But Thomas is not buying it, he's been lied to so much, how can he trust anyone now.

B002XTBE6K|5.0|After Emma Thompson's 1995 Sense & Sensibility, this is the BEST Jane Austen Adaptation. I wasn't expecting to like it this much, and was frankly very surprised. The first 15 minutes get off to a depressing (and somewhat comic) start, with people dying and rain pouring...I expected it to be one of those bad quasi-Gothic interpretations that Masterpiece Theatre has been cranking out in the last ten years (perfect mood for the Bronte sisters' books, but NOT Jane Austen or even Dickens). However...it quickly goes off in another direction, and becomes very, very funny.<br /><br />Romola Garai as Emma and Johnny Lee Miller as Mr Knightley was the most perfect casting I've seen in a very long time. The acting was phenomenal--and they struck just the right magical balance of both Emma's lovable good-natured naive-headed charm and her interfering brattiness. With Knightley, they managed to make him every bit the cranky, principled, kind-hearted bachelor who is genuinely attracted to Emma in a very non-creepy way. That is another great thing about this movie--it really gets all the complicated emotions of the heart down right, but it is done real--not cheesily. There aren't any hot kissing scenes, and its not about sexual attraction and projected romantic ideals, but good, old-fashioned, down-to-earth familial affection. You know--the people who know you, who REALLY know you, and they know you are a brat and love you in spite of (or because of?) it. This isn't one of those Austen adaptations that is for sexual/romantic thrills...this is one that is about comedy, and how funny and frail human nature is, and why people are worth it any way. It is really a comedy about ordinary human beings (and how they are so obnoxious and beloved), not a romantic escape of anything. Even my 14 year old brother deigned to watch the whole thing, and loved it.<br /><br />Like all movie adaptations, there are a number of departures from the book. However, unlike most adaptations, this one definitely gets the 'spirit' of Jane Austen's works. I suspect if she was alive today, this might be her favorite one.
B003UBTX6S|4.0|After finishing \\"Beautiful Darkness\\", I went back and updated my rating of \\"Beautiful Creatures\\" from 3 stars (technically 3.5) to 4 stars.  Why?  I've sincerely grown to care for several of these characters.  I find myself thinking about them from time to time throughout the day, laughing at their bad jokes, sympathizing over their various predicaments, and sometimes just wanting to shake them and tell them to get it together and grow up.  In real life, I do not subtract points from my friends for doing things that get on my nerves, so it hardly seems fair to subtract a star from a book because of minor character annoyances.<br /><br />\\"Beautiful Darkness\\" picks right up where \\"Beautiful Creatures\\" leaves off.  Lena begins to deal with the aftermath of the climax of the previous novel and it's back to the caster tunnels we go.  Admittedly, this novel took a bit longer to suck me in, but that's probably because I was having a few of those moments mentioned above of wanting to knock some sense into a character or two.  However, as the novel progresses, more secrets are revealed, new identities are brought to light, and more riddles must be untangled; thus, holding me hostage and demanding I keep reading.  By the way, do not expect to get any release once you finish this one.  The last sentences will make you want to start \\"Beautiful Chaos\\" (or \\"Dream Dark\\" if you want a little extra background information, which I recommend)immediately.<br /><br />\\"Beautiful Darkness\\" focuses on how one character blames herself for events she had no control over, and in turn, how the power of love can can provide the courage needed to face lurking darkness and evil to try and save the ones we care most about.  Lena, stricken with guilt over the events of the last novel, begins acting out of character leaving Ethan lost, hurt, and angry.  Because of her actions, more battles must be fought and more histories dug up.  And believe me, some of those histories will surprise you!<br /><br/>One of the strongest points of this series is the fact that just having finished this book a couple of days ago, I'm slightly blurry on which events happened in which book.  Unlike the Harry Potter novels, these books are not divided school years.  The timeline keeps moving forward from novel to novel without any real gaps in time.  You feel like you are moving and growing with the characters almost on a day by day basis.
B000V1Z8KK|2.0|Movies need to have an element of plausibility to get the audience to \\"buy into\\" watching it.  The story line for The Shooter was just way too implausible to even buy into just a little bit. So it got shut off after 16 minutes.  I so disagree that Wahlberg can act - his main acting face seems to be a frowning serious far away look.  When it comes to a choice of continuing to watch the movie or finding something better to do, this movie loses.
B00003CXB4|1.0|It doesn't even work past the previews! I'm so pissed my little sister was dying to see it for christmas and we put it in and ta dah....NOTHING

B004ZA9HB4|4.0|This process is really simultaneous. Reminds both your phone/tablet & your tv or whatever you're trying to connect it to have to be on the same Wi-Fi network for this to work. My tv is not a Wi-Fi tv so I connect mine through my ps3. Love watching my personally downloaded HD movies on an HD tv. if you're on PS3 like me make sure you go to Network Settings>> Media Server Connection>> Enabled. select the video on the app on your phone/tablet & click play. then go on your PS3 to the Video>> iMediaShare>> Video>> Now Playing. Just click on the video and your set. Easy to do and great app. Only have one problem. It's misconfigured to Facebook so you can't log in to it. 4star rating was because of that. [....] Thanks.
0596805527|5.0|Updating my third edition with the newest edition of this seminal classic reference on the Javascript language. I don't believe a more comprehensive yet accessible book on Javascript exists. This classic belongs in the reference library of any serious web developer
B0091REZMW|5.0|great game I'm addicted to it I have to play daily...just cant get enough glad I downloaded it recommend for everyone
0786962984|4.0|This is a light fun game with a fantasy dungeon theme. Explore as many rooms as you can and score the most treasure. My 9 year old found it fascinating and has requested to play this many times over.
B00A8SPNYW|3.0|Has skimpy picture instructions that are sometimes difficult to decipher.  Cute game but I can'tget past a certain level.  Needs some sort of Hint or Helpsection or more written instructions, because when you get stuck, there's no where to turn for help.
B000XR4OC0|5.0|They offer better price compared to store sold Toms. At $34.oo, it was a steal. The shoes performs as expected. It was comfortable and snuggle. At first it was tightly wrap your feet. As you keep wearing it, it was loosen up a bit. Great shoes to travel to tropical countries!
B0087HT36U|5.0|It's kind of like Angry Birds but more fun.  Different levels have different objects to take out, with different actions of those objects,
B009YP9L7U|4.0|I so enjoyed this love story. At first I thought it was going to be very predictable, but it had a few twist and turns I was not expecting. I found myself really pulling for this couple. There was something really sweet about their union. I really recommend it. I will most definitely read other books by this author!!
B007SGM084|5.0|I loved it I was also surprised. I had heard so much about and what it was about. I almost did not read it. A good friend had said that there is more to the books than just the sex and there was so much more. I could not put my Kindle down I enjoyed it so much. I could see that they were in....well I will let the readers learn that. But please don't let people tell you that all its about is bondage and sex because it is so much more and has a tremendous storyline and the Author did so well about sneaking it in. :)
B008JGSM6G|5.0|this game is tons of fun and I love playing it.  You do have to put on your thinking cap, I dont think that can hurt anyone.It might keep my old brain functioning a bit longer, sure hope so!!!!!!!!!!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book touched my heart made me laugh and cry. It is well written, fast paced and a non-stop read. It is a very touching story that had a real impact on me. It's about real life and how some young adults cope to live with past tradedy.

B00AB0AR2U|4.0|If u like the other res evils u will like this one. Always enjoyable to watch milla fight in her tight outfits!
B007BVOEPI|5.0|I have read all the books so far. The series stays true to the books.<br />Well done. I really like the character Tyrion Lannister
B008OOYALE|3.0|The game is ok but its a little slow. Items start to cost way too much way too soon in the game. You could lose interest quickly if you are not willing to spend money. Also things can take some time to progress.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I am hooked on this series. I couldn't stop reading.<br />Loved the characters and the way the story unfolded.<br />Want more.
B00005JSGU|1.0|This movie does not play on my DVD player it says check region code meaning it won't play on American DVD players even though it stated it would
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I am soooo glad they have moved on.<br />In my opinion Season 3 is better because of all the twists and turns the story takes.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|Angry Birds Star wars is so far the best angry bird game ever. How they the game to look like the real star wars is amazing

B000SEFCD8|5.0|read and re-read ,then practice the techniques !  what wonderful stories have been shared in this printed material. I want to read the next publication by this author.
B0095R64AO|3.0|This movie was built up to be wonderfully funny...it was just &#34;eh&#34;. Mu husband and I love Jason Segel and were soooo looking forward to this; apart from maybe three instances of 1-2 mins each throughout the entire film, the best of it was the last 20 minutes.
B005G4TJUC|5.0|This movie ties the other two together like never before. A must have for you collection of all action movies. Great acting, lots of surprises, and the movie keeps you at the edge of your seat. Not for little ones, it's too much fighting and action. I would say 10 and up.
B005LAIH3G|1.0|Fails in every degree: Acting, Directing, Story, Continuity, etc, etc, etc.  I bought this because I read the ERB stories 35 years ago when I was kid.  Thought, despite all the terrible reviews, &#34;how bad can it be?&#34;.  BAD!  I mean really, really bad.  Fight your inner child and don't waste your money.  You'll just end up re-gifting at Christmas time.
B00003Q438|5.0|Great story, full of suspense. The surprises will keep you glued to your seat from the beginning to the end. You practically are in the water with the actors.  Great movie.
B009CGYO0K|4.0|It's a book from The Oatmeal. If you don't know if you'd like the humor, go to the website. Then, if you're human, come back and buy the book!
B0001I55SS|5.0|If you like drama and suspense, this movie is one of the best. It's always creeped me out when I was a kid and it's great to have it back in my collection.
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|This product is a excellent one. Good for FPS and strategy games, if you want it play any MMO is good but i suggest using a gameboard like the g13.
B00ATPVA78|4.0|I really liked this game. Not just for the obvious reasons, the awesome scenes , the beautiful story, etc. The story was BASICALLY about 3 women from different backgrounds & seemingly different ages going on a camping trip & finding themselves on an incredible journey.  That,  & the hunky native American who I called \\"Big Boy\\" (LOL) just made this game for me. Although IMO, it was too short for the price. Had I known how short it was, I probably would not have bought it.
B0091REZMW|5.0|This game is fun. even if u run out of diamonds u can keep playing. each time u level up, you get 5 additional diamonds.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I give this book & series 5 stars!!!!  Highly recommended reads... Captivating, riveting & always keeps you longing for more...I'm going to read them all again & cannot wait to see them on the big screen!!!!!

B00A6PD9I4|5.0|Wonderful film.  Wonderful animation. The whole family loved it regardless of age.  Does include a scary scene that may not be suitable for those under 5.
B005LAII8K|5.0|Time travel is a tricky thing.  There are some stories that can only be told with the inclusion of time travel, but usually when they start explaining the rules and discussing the possibilities things become convoluted to the point where it's really hard to make sense of it all.  Try, for instance, to make sense of the rules of time travel in Terminator and you'll end up with a headache  (only living beings can travel, but in the nude, except liquid metal resembling living beings can travel too, and sometimes the future can be changed but sometimes it can only be delayed, and so on).<br /><br />Looper does not make that mistake.  They cleverly handwave the rules in one piece of dialogue: \\"It doesn't matter!\\".  And they're right, it doesn't.  Time travel is just an accessory here.  A means to an end, which is telling a good, scratch that, a GREAT sci-fi story.<br /><br />On to the plot.  A looper is basically an executioner for hire.  Time travel doesn't exist in the time of loopers, but it will in the further future, outlawed, but still used in secrecy by organized crime.  In the future you can't get rid of a body, so they send them back in time where loopers do the killing and incinerating of the body.  There's a catch, though.  Every looper's last job is to kill their future selves (can't leave any loose threads), and they know that after they do that they retire and they have only 30 years more to live.  They accept it, knowing that their rewards will make up for their shorter life spans.<br /><br />Until one of them decides he won't accept it, and escapes his past self executioner in order to get rid of the future that allows a personal tragedy, and his own execution, to happen.<br /><br />This looper, Joe, is, of course, played by the main actors, Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Bruce Willis, both of whom do a fantastic job of portraying the same person in different ages despite the fact that they don't look much like each other.  They both do an exceptional job at showing a person who suffers changes in two different ways, as we see the same person changing from hero to villain from one perspective and from villain to hero from another.<br /><br />The rest of the cast also does a great job, with Emily Blunt being a highlight playing the lonely mother of a child who gets in the way of both incarnations of Joe, and Jeff Daniels as the man sent from the future to run the loopers.<br /><br />Don't let the naysayers, who get confused at one of the easiest to understand movies involving time travel, talk you out of watching this film.  They probably get confused by anything smarter than The Smurfs or Hanna Montana.  If you want a good, smart sci-fi film that is still easy to understand then watch this movie.  You won't regret it.owing a person who suffers changes in two different ways, as we see the same person changing from hero to villain from one perspective and from villain to hero from another.<br /><br />The rest of the cast also does a great job, with Emily Blunt being a highlight playing the lonely mother of a child who gets in the way of both incarnations of Joe, and Jeff Daniels as the man sent from the future to run the loopers.<br /><br />Don't let the naysayers, who get confused at one of the easiest to understand movies involving time travel, talk you out of watching this film.

B001706I5I|5.0|My daughter, age 4 1/2, asked to watch this movie nearly every day in December.  And, whereas we didn't honor that request we did seem to watch it quite a bit. So much so that we were beginning to memorize the lines.  A funny movie about love and acceptance, and never being judgemental. A lesson that my daughter was very able to understand from this film.
B007EECSFA|5.0|It was very well written.  Just loved the story line all the way to the end. I would definitely recommend it.
B009VB7P6G|3.0|My 4 year old daughter enjoyed it. But, she loves anything with fairies.  Cute movie with a cute story line. Although, some of it was difficult for her to follow.
B003DNN0L2|5.0|This movie was a picnic for the eyes...and a cussin' good time overall!  I didn't expect to love it, but I did :)
B005LAIHCM|4.0|This movie has a basic storyline that is not fresh and it has been done in several movies. You know the abandoned house where the murders were done, a beautiful new girl in town and guess where she goes. Bad things always happen and that part of the movie was repetitive and a repeat of many previous films.<br /><br />I still liked it because it was well acted and several actors just stood out. Elissa was played by Jennifer Lawrence and she was stunning. Her role in the movie and the main protagonist was well performed by her. The storyline and plot were generic but it was fun to see an actress of her quality in this film and it kept it interesting. In addition the role of Ryan Jacobson was played by Max Thieriot and I felt he also played the role well.<br /><br />My wife and I enjoyed the movie and we both rated it as 4 stars because we felt it was entertaining. The story line was not fresh but the acting was of a much higher quality than most B-movie horror films

B007HACDLK|5.0|An excelent and believable plot, told in typical Vince Flynn style. His knowledge of the CIA and how they operate is unbelievable.

B000SVZIR6|4.0|This was an amazing and historically compelling interpretation of a loved and familiar story.  The quality of the amazon rental was poor, particularly in the beginning, but we either got accustomed to blurry images and forgot about it, or it adjusted after a while.  not sure which. Great movie.

I could see the story play out perfectly in my mind and I really enjoyed it reading it so much that I didn't want it to end. This book is full of suspense, action, and romance! If you liked the Slammed series, you will absolutely love this story!! Colleen Hoover is amazing!

B004J4WNL2|5.0|There's a lot to say about this book, but the short of it is, this book really helped me understand both introverts and extroverts much better.  I appreciated the collection and summary of so many scientific studies about the sources of my own behavior patterns and those around me, and how to leverage those different ways of thinknig to better effect for everyone.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|It is a really fun game and I love horse and so does my niece and she is going to love this game :)
B005ZO6NRA|2.0|Conan material has the elements to be an epic movie. This one falls very short of being more than a standard action movie with nothing that really sets it apart from 100 other titles done like this. I was very let down. Glad that I didn't pay for it in the theater or but the Disc version. Free online is the way to go on a rainy day when your expectations are low.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|This book was amazing.......My favorite thing about it was how the author captured by how relationship between Peeta and Katniss. I would recommend this book to anyone that  likes how the story of love can change over time.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I take away something new every time I read this book. The author is brilliant and his characters are believable and yet fantastic. I cry with them and laugh with them every step of the way. It is a cancer book but first it is a love story and that makes all the difference.

B007Z8ZKS2|4.0|This is  a simple, real and honest book. Though its subject matter is extremely sad and a subject most people prefer not to address, John Green has done it with simplicity and maturity. It is a beautiful story of love, loss and the strength of the human spirit. A great and easy read.
B000E1ZBFY|5.0|Captures his life before his religious life.  A true worker, evangelizer and uses his love of \\"the stage\\" to proclaim the Good News.  I would recommend this movie to all.  You would not regret it.  Watch the sequel.
B003UBTX72|5.0|always been a rolling stones fan.... and had a small amount on a gift card to spend......so......first chapter was a little slow... and was disappointed... by chapter 2 i was hooked.... read it in one afternoon......

B002UM5BXW|4.0|For someone who loves to cook, and to read chef's stories, this is great fun. The book helps explain the ego-driven, sarcastic but highly entertaining Bourdain.
B00A4GXJD0|5.0|This is one very cool album. It is a lot different from his early rap days. Rebel Soul is the perfect name for this CD. This is the kind of CD you should listen to on a road trip. Every song has its own sound and its own story. The more you listen the more that you will love it.  This good ole country boy gives Rebel Soul 5 stars and a big hell yea!<br /><br />  Dano
0545265355|5.0|I received this set after I had read it previously by borrowing a friend's set.  I was enraptured by Ms. Collins' writing and decided that I needed the set for myself.  When I received this from Amazon, it was in perfect condition.  I immediately sat down and read through all three books with every moment of spare time!  It's one of my most treasured sets of books and I highly recommend it to anyone who may have seen the movie without reading the book.  It gives you valuable insight into the movie!
B007ONSLLQ|5.0|The Strange Case Of ...  is one great album.  Cool songs that rock and awesome vocals. A hot chick with an awesome voice that loves to rock.  Every song is well written and tells its own story. Halestorm is the next big break out rock band.  A solid 5 stars from the Dano<br /><br />  Dano
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Love John Grisham all his books are great!! Hate write amazon review when I have to use so many words.
B00APUYWYA|2.0|My 12-yo daughter convinced my husband to rent this for her, saying all her friends had seen it and it was about singing groups with &#34;nothing bad, really!&#34;  Very shortly into the movie it was evident that what the movie is really about is the promiscuous sex lives of college students.  There was one scene where a girl confronts another girl in the shower and the suggestiveness is palpable.  After about 20 minutes we turned it off, so I really don't know where the plot eventually went.  Maybe it had a legitimate message, but having to wade through all the vulgarity and explicit references, is not worth it.  Instead, we watched a movie about Paris with Ashley and Mary Kate Olsen.  This much more accurately reflected the life of my tween daughters, and we could all enjoy it without cringing.

072325804X|5.0|I just had 2 great nephews in the past few months. Sent them both this collection for Christmas. The parents remember the stories from when they were children.

B001XUPF2O|5.0|Heath Ledger crushed it in this movie, hands down.  A commanding performance that gets better on repeat viewings.  Gestures, inflection, all of it.  Awesome.<br /><br />Beyond that, this continues Nolan's vision of Gotham, and it's a fantastically thrilling movie with great camera and stunt work, with a clever script in the hands of a more than capable group of actors.  Great viewing.

B009FZHYKU|4.0|My issues with The Walking Dead are the same many others have had.  I want to love this show but it stumbles from time to time with meandering stories, boring plots, etc.<br /><br />Season 3 is finally starting to see TWD evolve into the kind of show its fans want it to be.  The setup headed into the second half of the season has the show raising its game to become a top-tier program.  Also, the actor playing the Governor is teriffic, and the special effects team continue to outdo themselves.
B00466HN6S|5.0|This is a very cute movie, and belongs in every child's collection - no matter how old the child is. :-)  While it's geared towards Easter, there's no wrong time of the year to enjoy it.
B004S5D3B6|4.0|This was a great film for a lazy, rainy Sunday.  Mark Wahlberg is perfect for this sort of role, and Christian Bale stole every scene he was in.<br /><br />I also recommend &#34;Warrior&#34;, a terrific sports flick set in the world of MMA.
B0016BWACI|5.0|I saw this movie in the theater when it first came out and fell in love with it.  It's the age-old fight between good & evil, in the world and within each of us.  I was very excited when this became available on blu-ray.
B005LLSZNM|5.0|This is one of our favorite shows - we bought season 4 on demand since we couldn't wait for it to arrive on Netflix.<br /><br />This season dials back some of the aspects of season 3 that started to get into the realm of silliness.  The show goes back to being a gritty, raw drama with action scenes: Good stuff, since we love the shoot-em-up action but you can't do that every week without things losing the emotional hit.<br /><br />With more seasons on the horizon, it's good to see SOA getting back to what makes the show so good.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|its very addictive, love it!  I play until my battery goes dead on my kindle fire HD. My husband likes to play too!!!
B004US4K2C|5.0|This was my first launcher app, but I found it suprisingly easy to work with.  It does want you want, and makes it easy to do so.<br /><br />I've tried other launchers since, but keep going back to Go Launcher - first time lucky I guess!  It's free and easy to use, so give it a spin.

B002NOH7G6|5.0|If you're looking for an amped-up thrill ride of a movie, 300 gets the blood pumping.<br /><br />It's not a documentary about the Battle of Thermopylae and doesn't intend to be.  The movie's much more concerned with fidelity to Miller's graphic novel (at least visually) and being a great spectacle.  Go into it hoping to be entertained, and you'll leave happy.<br /><br />The visual achievements of this film are inspiring, and Gerard Butler completely sells the role of Leonidas.  Terrific fun.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|Loved every page of this book. Even as an adult, I love young adult lit and this book did not disappoint. It was fun, exciting, heartbreaking, and beautiful. I couldn't put it down :)
B0047WJ12K|5.0|Christopher Nolan's amazing adventure into the world of dreams.  Well written, well acted, with visuals that are as believable-looking in their execution as they are unbelievable in their dream logic.  GREAT film, even on repeat viewings.
B009AMANBA|4.0|Who can't help but love Steven Spielberg? Spielberg, one of the most creative minds in Hollywood, has made films of high historical importance. After making films about World War II and the Holocaust, Spielberg has gone on to another high area of historical importance: Abraham Lincoln and Lincoln's last three months (with a little bit of his four years altogether) as President.<br /><br />The result is Lincoln, starring Daniel Day-Lewis as our sixteenth and, as most people agree, most beloved President.<br /><br />As director, Steven Spielberg takes Day-Lewis and a powerful ensemble cast (most notably Sally Field, Joseph-Gordon Levitt, Hal Holbrook, Tommy Lee Jones, and James Spader)on a ride back through time. Viewers are shown by Spielberg what was going on in the Civil War in early 1865 and, in the meanwhile, the House of Representatives as its members were in the process of deciding either for or against slavery. The stresses of President Lincoln around this time are shown, not only in his job, but also in his personal life, most notably with his wife Mary Todd (portrayed by Sally Field) and son Robert (portrayed by Joseph-Gordon Levitt). Viewers are given a ride inside of President Lincoln's mind, a mind of faith, humor, and sometimes darkness as it was and as it evolved through the most trying times of President Lincoln's life. As a Lincoln scholar, I can tell you that the way Spielberg documents all of these personal traits about President Lincoln--and the way that the personal traits appear themselves--are impeccably portrayed in both quality and quantity. Daniel Day-Lewis, even if his heritage is the polar opposite of President Lincoln's, brings the beautiful talent that we all know and love him for right into his performance as President Lincoln. Every mannerism of President Lincoln, every trait of President Lincoln, is present in Day-Lewis' performance of him.<br /><br />My only real beef to pick with Lincoln is the fact that it does not document the entire life of President Lincoln, which keeps it from (in my opinion) being the ultimate Lincoln biography (compared to the biographies that record all of President Lincoln's life). However, given how many limitations on time filmmakers have, I can't hold it against Spielberg. In \\"making do,\\" so to speak, Spielberg succeeded in giving viewers a whole glimpse of Lincoln in spite of covering a small (but largely important) part of his life.<br /><br />Recommended for ALL, especially those who are and want to be Lincoln scholars.re life of President Lincoln, which keeps it from (in my opinion) being the ultimate Lincoln biography (compared to the biographies that record all of President Lincoln's life).

B005LAIIJY|5.0|After becoming Martin Scorsese's mole and making great American classics with Scorsese (2004's The Aviator, 2006's The Departed, and, as some people agree, 2002's Gangs of New York and 2010's Shutter Island), Leonardo DiCaprio has gone on to work with another Hollywood great, the man inspired by DiCaprio's mole in Scorsese: Quinton Tarantino.<br /><br />The outcome is Django Unchained, which unites DiCaprio and Tarantino in a much-awaited collaboration, along with a powerful ensemble cast supporting both DiCaprio and Tarantino: Jamie Foxx, Christoph Waltz (making his sophomore collaboration with Tarantino three years after Inglorious Basterds), Samuel L. Jackson (marking Jackson's fourth collaboration with Tarantino, following Pulp Fiction, Jackie Brown, and Kill Bill: Volume 2), Kerry Washington, Don Johnson, and, for a cameo appearance, Franco Nero (for those of you unfamiliar with Nero, Nero is the man who played the head villain in both Die Hard 2 and Force Ten From Navarone). The story stars Foxx as Django, a slave in Texas who, many years ago, was sold apart from his wife, Broomhilda (Washington). Broomhilda has gone on to a Southern plantation in Mississippi, owned and controlled by an infamous and cruel slave owner named Calvin J. Candie (DiCaprio). The minute that Django is rescued by a German bounty hunter named Dr. King Schultz (Waltz), he seizes control of the opportunity to rescue Broomhilda. Before reaching that point, however, Django and Dr. Schultz are going to go through Hell and back. And they may (knowingly) never escape up against the cruel and manipulative, yet brilliantly smart tactics used against them by Calvin J. Candie and his fellow slave owners.<br /><br />For the two and a half hours given to us by Tarantino, we find ourselves on a wild trip back through time. For having shot Django Unchained between 2011-2012, Tarantino gives the film a perfect look and atmosphere of the year 1858 (when the picture takes place). The buildings, the streets of dirt, the clothes...everything looks impeccably like it is 1858. The plantations in Tennessee (used for Don Johnson's character of \\"Big Daddy\\") and Mississippi (used for Leonardo DiCaprio's Calvin J. Candie character) are beautiful and look not only old-fashioned, but also just as you would expect for Southern plantations to look like (trust me-I'm a Southerner!)<br /><br />The adventure that all of Tarantino's characters go through in Django Unchained are pretty fun as well, and they have great humor to them. Who could ever forget Don Johnson leading a team of men who have trouble with the sheets used by the Ku Klux Klan, or a slave referring to a slave owner as \\"snowball\\" and getting away with it?!!?!!!!!!!!!?!?!?!?!?!?!!!?!?!?!?! All of the actors execute both the comedy and the suspense impeccably. Leonardo DiCaprio shines in one of his first performances as a villain (and the villain whom Tarantino claims he had the most trouble bringing to life on the big screen, compared to every other villain character he has ever created). DiCaprio and Tarantino, together, bring to life an honest portrayal of the cruelty of many slave owners (next to those who provided an education for their slaves and never even beat them).<br /><br />In spite of all of the good, there will be many people upset by Django Unchained. Spike Lee is one of them (while his criticism is understandable, please remember that Mr. Lee has not actually seen the picture--and says that he is not going to, saying that seeing the picture would be disrespectful to his ancestors who were all slaves). You have Tarantino's constant use of the \\"N\\" word--which is honest to the picture, of course, but always brings an uncomfortable feeling when it is used by a non-African American director. Much of the cruelty inflicted upon the slave characters in Django Unchained is very brutal, and a \\"little bit too much.\\" Entertainment? The picture itself is, but a few scenes are a bit too harsh for entertainment.<br /><br />Regardless, Tarantino does not glorify the \\"N\\" word, but instead uses it to give an honest depiction of what things were like back in the south in 1858. They say that \\"beauty is in the eye of the beholder\\"--and both Jamie Foxx and Samuel L. Jackson have come out and said that they understand Tarantino's material for what it is as a picture, and for what it is not: a picture glorifying racism. Next to this, many of the slave characters of Django Unchained, when in peril, find happy endings. And the end is happy as well.<br /><br />Django Unchained is not for everyone. Regardless, if you are a fan of Tarantino, DiCaprio, and/or western pictures, you will most likely find yourselves in for a great treat.><br />Regardless, Tarantino does not glorify the \\"N\\" word, but instead uses it to give an honest depiction of what things were like back in the south in 1858.

B002TLSSXO|5.0|I love these utensils and have purchased them for other family members who already had other utensils like this they used, but they raved after using these.  They are great because they won't harm teflon pans and are a nice size and cool colors.  However, the BEST feature is that you can stir your food and just sit the utensil on directly on the counter and food never drips off of them onto your counter.  I worried when I first bought this that food on the utensil might fall off onto my granite counter, but it never has.  You won't be disappointed if you order these.

While some very minor questions may be left unanswered, almost every major story arc came to a conclusion within the 900 pages of A Memory of Light. I was repeatedly impressed with how the Last Battle unfolded and how it was presented, successfully showing the chaotic war environment from many viewpoints and personality types.  I had once worried that my expectations were too high for any final book to the series to fulfill, however Jordan and Sanderson did not disappoint.  Definitely worth the read!

I just finished it for a Lifelong Learning class in detective literature, and I wish I'd read it all those years ago!  What a wonderful mystery; what a wonderful, light writing stile; what a wonderful glimpse into mid-19th-century England.  Did I say it's wonderful?  It's also a fairly easy read.  It's the Dickens era, and a bit of the Dickens style, but much lighter and more enjoyable.  It's wonderful!

B00AZVAE1E|5.0|I agree with a previous rater.  There is a plethora of reality shows (too many) and it is great that CBS has produced something other than one of those here. It is wonderful to have  a show that has intrigue and suspense.  The introduction of some of the famous bits of the original Sherlock Holmes keeps the thread of that character intact.  I hope they continue to produce this series.
B000BJS4TO|5.0|Beyond beautiful and magnificent film. This Soundtrack is evocative of that viewing and fits so perfectly. But, stands on it's own for listening anywhere.

B007FC3AAI|1.0|This is one of the worst movies I've seen.<br /><br />I know it's sort of the \\"in\\" thing to hate on Twilight, and there are good reasons for that.  It depicts an abusive relationship between two unlikeable people who have absolutely nothing in common, beyond a sort of warped physical attraction, and tries to convince the reader that this is romantic.  It's been called misogynistic, classist, racist, and ableist, among other -ists, and transphobic.  We could talk about all of this, and more, and many have, but as far as I'm concerned, it all boils down to one thing:<br /><br />It's not entertaining.<br /><br />I only ask one thing from a movie, and that's to be entertained.  It may be cerebral, or melodramatic, or a big, dumb action movie, but as long as it's entertaining, I don't care.  This is why I love Ed Wood, adore The Asylum, and count \\"Birdemic: Shock and Terror\\" among my favorites.  Yes, all of these are, technically, of a lower quality than the Twilight series, but I don't care because they entertain me.  The Twilight series does not.<br /><br />The reason for this is a near-total lack of conflict.  Instead, what you get is a fear of the possibility of conflict.  You see, Stephanie Meyer tries to set up her own vampire/werewolf mythos, which is fine, but then she makes an excuse and sets it aside it whenever it would mean the characters would have to deal with the consequences of their actions.  The result is a series 4,000 pages long and almost completely static, and it translates into some truly agonizing movies.<br /><br />\\"Breaking Dawn: Part 1\\" is the worst offender.  It's two hours long.  Absolutely nothing happens for the first hour, apart from some terrible music, at which point the movie's pseudo-conflict finally arrives: Bella gets pregnant.  I will ignore all of the questions this raises about Stephanie Meyer's mythos because, by this point in the series, she's already made so many excuses of her own to ignore it that, frankly, who cares.  Then nothing happens and there are some CG werewolves that are even worse than the music and nothing happens until fifteen minutes to the end, when Bella goes into labor.  The baby breaks her spine, Edward chews it out of her womb, the CG monstrosity posing as an infant is given the world's most embarrassing name, and Jacob turns into a pedophile.  All of this is especially interesting because Stephanie Meyer has said she doesn't watch or read horror because it's icky and that the \\"Twilight\\" movies had to be PG-13 so she could see them.  I don't like hypocrites.<br /><br />That's it, really.  It's two hours long.  I'd say maybe forty-five minutes of it actually needs to be there.  I only just saw it, and even with the RiffTrax commentary, I was so bored I could barely pay attention.<br /><br />I will say that there are three (3) things worth seeing in this movie:<br /><br />1. Watch it if only to skip the entire movie and see the Volturi scene in the end credits.  The actors clearly don't care.  They're just doing what they want and it's a riot.<br /><br />2. Robert Pattinson's makeup makes him look like he's about to die of alcohol poisoning.<br /><br />3. At the end of Bella's getting-ready-to-have-sex montage, she looks like she's trying to psyche herself up to muck out the pigs.  Seriously, she's finally going to screw this guy she's been trying to screw for three movies, and she looks like she's about to puke.  Being nervous about sex is one thing, but this is just hilarious.
B0063IH60K|2.0|Game plays well but too many ads... I don't know why any body would think putting an ad or two PER GAME is acceptable at all. I spend more time clicking the ads off than playing the game! Obnoxious!! Do not download if you value your time.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I liked this book and immediately began to see changes in the Capitol region and Region 13.  The only reason I couldn't give it five stars is because I found it hard to believe that a 17 year old girl could go through everything that Katniss did.  I would, however, recommend it to others.
B009WO7NQO|1.0|What a horrible thing to do to parents and little kids.  You pay $3 for the game and then have to pay at least another $2 to get more than one level.  My grandson got 3 stars on the first level in 5 minutes, and the $3 investment is over!  Now, if I want to pay another $2 he can get another few levels, until I'm sure it will ask for more money for more basic levels.  Extremely displeased with Rovio and this product.  Listen to the one star reviews (wish I'd read before purchasing from the Kindle) and don't waste your money.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Loved this book.  Could not put it down.  Read all night.<br />I couldn't decide between Peeta and Gale, either.  Hard to know who was right or who was wrong.
B000JMKQX0|4.0|As a lover of zombie and post apocalyptic fiction, I'm surprised I didn't hear about this book sooner.  It was good.  Really good.  Just not what I was expecting.  The story is told in post-WAR interviews by numerous characters.  The only constant is our host, the interviewer.  I had expected more of a play by play as the war on zombies was happening.
B00005Q4CS|5.0|Crazy. Twisted. Real. Heartbreaking.....I l.o.v.e.d it. Takes you on a trip to somewhere you're curious about but don't want to ho,
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a fun game and I love the graphics it so fun too! I guess some people do not know what they ate missing I love it!!!!!!
B004EBT5CU|5.0|Easy to see why it was maybe the greatest album released of the year. Every song is intense and memorable.
0545400163|2.0|I was disappointed in the book. I found the adventures repetitive and predictable after the first few. Clearly, the author really liked his characters and their development progressed, but I didn't care about all the magical experiences.
B008OHV4PG|5.0|I wanted to see this in the theaters, but the limited release never came to my town. I bought the BluRay disc instead.<br />This is not your typical Neil Young media event. Neil has always been pretty serious about documenting, recording, and preserving the present for the future. This is a unique look into Neil and where he is in his life at this time.<br /><br />This movie documents Neil's travels back to his homeground haunts..You see his brother and where he grew up, and at the same time documents his return to Massey Hall for a solo concert. But this is not a solo acoustic gig, this is Neil playing many of his greatest releases in a different manner. Lots of electric and acoustic, but performed solo, you just need to watch to understand what he is doing here. As he describes, it's like he is performing with a band, but you are only hearing his isolated part of the whole...very interesting.<br /><br />The added commentary from Neil and Demme is kinda cool.<br /><br />This is a keeper for your Neil collection....
6305212112|5.0|This movie evokes so many different emotions. Anger-at the unfairness and violence of the inequality of race and social-status, joy-for the love of human beings in general and the strength everyone possesses to survive, and sadness-for the losses of lives and loves.
B004GYY714|5.0|I have used tune in on several different devices and it's amazing on all of them!!!! HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS APP
B002UJIY7A|5.0|The first time I saw this movie, I was completely saturated in the storyline...never expected what was to happen later!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I didn't think it was going to b  this good.  I wonder how the rest of the books will be
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|The book was better, as always! And I realize that Hilly is a fictitious character, but I'd like to punch her in the neck.
B005GVA2L0|5.0|This is a very good CD from Evanescence and I think it is some of their best material to date. I am disappointed however that the DVD that was advertised to come with it is misssing.
B009SJ3H8Q|5.0|I watched AHS Season 1 on television and was pleasantly surprised at how well written and acted this series was and didn't think they could improve or enhance the series. When I started watching Season 2 I missed the first episode and felt that what I was watching was not as good as the first season. However, I watched it on my MAC upon purchase from Amazon and was hooked. I bought the whole season to-date and find the story line and performances outstanding.
B005IZLPKQ|3.0|It got here in great time but when I opened the dvd it was all sticky. Idk what it was, but its all good. After cleaning the disc it plays just fine.
B004LWZWGK|5.0|I recommend this movie, it brings all the Batman movies together and it  gives a very realistic time line of all
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is a really fun game. Our 1st grader loves taking care of her horse. Easy to maneuver through the app and easy for children to read the instructions.
B004GJDQT8|4.0|From what I've seen so for the application is pretty good It could use a little work on the navigation /search<br />system but other than that it's fine and it seems to be getting better so will see how it goes
B003B02PFO|3.0|Nice novel  but  a  tad  slow  starting,  and  as a fan  of  Mr  Grisham having  purchased  every book he writes, i prefer  the more adventurous type  he  writes  so  well...
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I love Colleen Hoover's books...however, they all deal with very deep, dark, emotional life events, an in this case, a sequence of terrible tragedies that all started with one very sick and twisted person. If that's not something you're willing to re-live throughout the lead character's journey, this is not the book for you.<br /><br />She makes you love these characters and her quirky way of blending/creating new words that I frequently include in my daily category.<br /><br />If you've read her other two stories, Slammed and Point of Interest, then you'll know what I mean when I say, I butterflying love this book!<br /><br />Congrats to Colleen in all her recent success!
B00ANGSSWS|5.0|BVB gets better with every album they put out.  They are really perfecting their craft. Give them a deserved try.
B001JIFYSA|3.0|The start of the show was a bit dis-jointed and far-fetched.  I enjoyed ir once, but have no desire to see it again.  Glad I didn't pay to see it in a theater.
B0037NB6QE|5.0|An easy read. I thoroughly enjoyed this book. I loved the setting and the characters and how this shows how people from different walks of life can interact.
0316232955|1.0|I hate this book.  Carson Phillips is a smart, driven, creative kid who lives in a small nowhere town.  Carson is driven, and ambitious, and does questionable things to achieve his goal: to get into the University of his choice.  No other school will do.  He has great plans to be a writer.  He has a sad life, the person he loves most in the world does not remember him, his father left the family years ago, and seems to have forgotten that he had a son.  After all of his hard work towards his goal, he is betrayed by someone who should have his best interests at heart.  We don't even get to see Carson prevail over all of these obstacles.  After I finished the book, I was left thinking, it must have been a joke, i missed something somewhere.  I will definately not be seeing the movie.  Nor will I ever read another book by this author.
B007TK77QE|4.0|This is slow to start but creeps up on you.  It reminded me of Mark Haddon novels but with much more to say on the social structures of England.
B005LAII08|5.0|My family tries to only get movies that includes digital copies, because its so convenient to transfer to our Ipad and iPhones. It's also the best for those long drives with small kids.
B007QUUJMG|5.0|This was a clever book well suited to older teens.  Finally a book that doesn't bother with the typical love triangle of girl and two boys (aka &#34;Hunger Games&#34;, &#34;Divergent&#34;, &#34;Twilight&#34; etc).  A clever book with good parent characters and three dimensional characters.
B005GSVFB4|5.0|My daughters love that it comes with the digital copy so they can watch it on the iPad easily. So Happy with the product
B0074PNCRM|1.0|I've read &#34;Will Grayson Will Grason&#34; and didn't mind it.  However, &#34;The Fault in Our Stars&#34; was like Jodi Picault for children.  Insipid and emotionally manipulative.  I read it and so did my teenage daughter, aged 14 and 16.  None of us liked it.
B005LAII3U|4.0|TOTAL RECALL. Its a good movie, I liked it better than the first.There alot more to this movie I thought.
0385333846|2.0|The first pages of the book introduce Vonnegut himself speaking to a friend about the difficulty of writing a book about the bombing of Dresden. Indeed, this is commonly considered Vonnegut's \\"Dresden book.\\" For the life of me, I cannot understand why, as events relating to the firebombing of Dresden comprise about four pages total. Vonnegut the character apologizes to the reader for the difficulty of telling a story about war and instead offers a lame science fiction story about a man named Billy Pilgrim who becomes \\"unstuck in time\\" and experiences the events of his life out of order.<br /><br />It seems to me that Vonnegut was afraid to embrace a story focusing on his experience during the firebombing. He was afraid to attempt to capture the confusion, disillusionment, and otherwise intense emotions caused by war, as Hemingway so astutely did in A Farewell to Arms and For Whom the Bell Tolls. He was afraid to try and fail, and so he skirted around the actual bombing and immediate aftermath. Those events should have been the primary focus of the book, but were instead buried beneath hundreds of pages describing life in an alien zoo, adventures in optometry, and a sham marriage to an obese woman. Hemingway spent hundreds of pages describing battles and bombings; Vonnegut could have spent more than four describing an afternoon where a city's population all but completely burned to death.<br /><br />It's not as if the book is tensely building up to those four pages. Most of the novel is spent describing the mundane life of Billy Pilgrim, a character who, in defiance of most concepts of good characterization, does not grow or mature in any way. The reader receives virtually no insight as to his motivations. When he does speak, his interactions with other characters suggest that he is mentally retarded. Billy's inept actions and dialogue are so absurd that many times the novel left me feeling slightly ashamed, as if I was reading a Tucker Max story about a slutty midget and expected to share a derisory laugh with the author. In general, Billy simply drifts through life as things happen around him. Somehow, I doubt that this is a postmodern metaphor for the disillusionment of soldiers that is lost on me. More likely, it is simply uninspired writing.<br /><br />Vonnegut's irreverent prose did make me chuckle, but it was marred by one very odd stylistic choice. The author chose to insert the mantra \\"So it goes,\\" after each mention of death in the book as a sardonic expression of fatalism. Used 106 times in 190 pages, the wit quickly turns to obnoxiousness. By the end of the book, I felt that I was listening to a child who repeats a single phrase over and over solely to irritate.<br /><br />Slaughterhouse-Five is a mediocre novel and does not deserve the acclaim it has received. I theorize that the novel's popularity resulted from a combination of Vonnegut's personal popularity and the postmodern and anti-war movements that were prevalent at the book's publishing.
0312962118|5.0|Well done Glenn Meade its got everything I look for in a book. great read. another great plot and finish. worth buying
B000BNI99K|5.0|Who wouldn't enjoy this?  It is Rod Stewart here, to remind Americans what REAL music is all about.  Music that speaks to the heart, and makes sense of this crazy world!
B006WZLCZ4|5.0|Wood surfaces are smooth, set is well made. Our grand daughter loves this set. Glad to be able to locate non-plastic wares.
B003TH14H4|4.0|Great.  In my opinion unless it is an unusual object 20 w0rds are too many words to require us to write & read
1936608618|4.0|This book has a lot of great insight into mobility exercises, skill drills, the philosophy/theory of Crossfit endurance methods, and programming. This style of programming and training definitely delivers results, based on my own experience. The book alone will not be an all-encompassing guide - it is a resource that will fit great in your library right next to anything by Mark Rippetoe. I would recommend training at a Crossfit gym with a skilled coach to truly reap the benefits of this style of programming. This is a good resource if you are interested in training this way, or if your current Crossfit gym trainers are not as well-versed in applying Crossfit to endurance athletes.<br /><br />I am only giving it 4 stars, however, because there are quite a few editing errors. For example, some of the illustration headings don't match the pictures or progressions shown, and there are several typos and grammatical errors. The errors don't really detract from the intent of the book, but I was just surprised to see them.
B008NNNF7G|5.0|I really have enjoyed every song but my favorite is pretty little lie. I don't know why it's making me write so much..
B00APUQT7I|2.0|I suppose the target audience for Ice Age: Continental Drift is children who have never seen a movie before. With no frame of reference, they are likely to enjoy this film. As for everyone else, I am not so sure.<br /><br />The writing itself feels as if it has suffered from too many writers and too little direction. There is the overarching natural disaster of continental drift, the inter-family conflict, the pirates, and the love interest. Not one of these is given more than a few minutes for motivation, nor the proper screen-time afterwards to justify their existence in the final script  Each conflict is left undeveloped until it is miraculously resolved in the final scene.<br /><br />In all, I would say it is wise to avoid this film if possible.
B0000027G6|5.0|I have seen this wonderful movie several times.  I always have and I always will love this CD. This CD is hard to beat !!

B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is so realistic.  I have not found a game as realistic as this one.  I suggest it for all ages.
B002JVWR9U|5.0|I was completly satisfied with this product. There wasn't any compilcations with anything. I totally recommend this product. Two thumbs up.
159420411X|5.0|Kate has taken forecasting to a new level by introducing uncertainty and ability to identify the right uncertainty which can queer up the predictions. Certainly with the kind of black swan events in extreme weather and human psychotic behaviour and irrational economic living outside means...the future is fraught with black swan events taking everything to the brink.
B003YL4L0W|5.0|I loved this story. It was very realistic and represented both sides of two very provocative and powerful subjects. (religious beliefs and gay rights) It was an easy and fast read.  I absolutely loved the surprise ending.
B007VDN1PA|1.0|The product looked good but the functionality was terrible.  First off when trying to insert the film you had to get it lined up perfectly, to do this you had to actually touch the picture part of the negative. Secondly once you got it inserted the first frame wouldn't line up properly because nothing was holding the front part of the negative, so you have to tilt it back and forth some to try to get it to show the first frame.  If you were lucky enough to line it up it was so distorted even if you scanned it it would be unusable.  Now rolling the negative forward the feeding into area for the out portion has two hard 90 degree edges which makes the negative bind and you have to psychically stick this small \\"film retrial\\" strip down into the machine to get the leading edge into the out feeding slot so it wont bind up.  The second picture on the negative only shows up because now both ends are held by the machine, but again distorted beyond belief.  The third picture is basically the same as the first because the first feed roller has now released and the negative half way through the picture and is free floating in the machine.  The fourth I plan gave up on  after several attempts.  I returned this product after about an hour of messing with it because its complete garbage and order a flatbed negative scanner.  I don't know who is writing the 5 star reviews of this product but believe me these people have never seen or used this product.  They are not being truthful in the least bit.

B007IXWL2C|1.0|I am so grateful to be finished with this series. I am amazed that the author was able to drag out this story into three books. I think we got it after the first. I'm unsure of what all the hype was about.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I love the Kindle for Android and I tried to download it onto an older Pan Digital tablet that I had and I could never get the tablet to accept the download.  The tablet came with the Barnes & Noble app but I don't care for Barnes & Noble, just me there is nothing wrong with them I just don't care for them.  I got a Kindle Paperwhite for Christmas and the app was already there and I have been reading ever since.  Love it.

B005DF2QMC|1.0|This tape player is very clunky compared to the top of the line tape players of years ago. The material seems a bit cheap and unfortunately there is a lot of noise that comes through. At first I thought it was my computer USB cable but when I tried it with batteries and a power supply cable the noise was still there, so it is impossible to get good quality transfers of my tapes. This product is now in my garbage can.
B004ZA9HB4|3.0|I got it to work on a ps3, but video took a long time to load and the PS3 and my Asus tablet didn't find eachother right away. It may be better with a tv that was directly connected to the wifi. I can't think of any situation where it wouldn't be easier than to just pass your phone/tablet to the other people in the room and let them watch individually, because more than likely you will be embarrassed when you try to show everyone a video and it takes so long that no one is interested anymore, or you spend 15 minutes troubleshooting. You can skip the Facebook sign in. I'm going to keep it on my phone for now, just in case I find the opertunity to use it. If i haven't used it in a couple of months its getting uninstalled. (definatly not worth 4.99)
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|Some parts of the story line are a little forced but it is a good story. It is worth a borrow on Prime.

B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Colleen  Hoover writes beautifully.  Her ability to bring the emotion into the written word amazing.<br />Her creativity in story telling while consistently supporting time and logic bring a solid plot with no beaches. Her use of humor in conversational exchanges is well done and is expertly woven into scenes where comedic relief is essential. Well done Colleen.

B004A8ZWVK|5.0|At first I had trouble getting into this movie. But I kept watching, and it got a lot better as it moved along.  The only thing left out was at the end, did she get arrested or not ?  I'm going for not, because I like happy endings  AGAIN A GREAT MOVIE
B009YG2ND8|1.0|I have played all of the final fantasy games that i can find<br /> This is the only one I feel I should receive a refund. It stops two hours in after you beat Djinn goes to a crystal screen and then credits role. What a lousy game!
B00A8SPNYW|4.0|Overall pretty good. Very nice graphics with a lot of animations. Game play is fun. I like the fun obstacles like the cat.
B00ATPVA78|4.0|I played this on my Kindle Fire with no problems.  Beautiful and artistic graphics depicting an enchanting and engrossing story that is a perfect balance of difficulty and helpful hints.  It is a wonderful hidden object game entwined with challenging mini games.  Not the typical hidden object game though as the items are rarely grouped in a &quot;sparkle group&quot;  but usually scattered around each scene and not always apparent or easy to locate.  A nice change from the typical hidden object game.  All in all an enjoyable game.  Wish it was longer and hope there is a sequel.  Only complaint is I wish the type was easier for my tired eyes to read and the sillouettes for objects to locate were bigger.
B004Y042N8|3.0|Overall, this game gets a \\"meh\\". It's okay, not anything memorable. Easy to play and figure out. Probably more for kids than adults.
B004TI5N38|4.0|This novel is generally a good read, although I found the plot to be somewhat murky.  Basically a hyper-competent military CID investigator gets caught up in a series of murders in a small West Virginia coal town, and as the plot develops what appeared to be a local problem is seen to have larger implications.  The story generally moves along at a leisurely though steady pace.  I found a number of irritants, however.  Firstly, the author repeatedly talks about people being convicted of \\"treason.\\"  This is a flat technical error, as it is almost impossible to be convicted of treason in the United States due to the restrictions placed on this directly by the Constitution.  God knows there are an infinite number of Federal crimes that the Feds can prosecute anyone for, but \\"treason\\" itself is almost never among them.  Secondly, agent \\"Puller,\\" the main protagonist in this novel, is virtually a super-hero.  He is 6 feet 5, hyper-competent, good looking, and intelligent enough to be a general, by the author's own description.  OK I guess, but most really good stories involve protagonists who are of more human dimensions.  Just my opinion.  Further, the author gets some details about nuclear weapons completely wrong -- without going into detail he appears not to know the difference between fission and fusion (thermonuclear) bombs, although he does accurately describe the difference between uranium and plutonium weapons.  Not a major issue, but an irritant.<br /><br />Overall this is a well-written novel that holds the reader's interest throughout and moves along at a steady pace.  The characterizations are not bad as well, although, as discussed above, agent Puller is much larger than life in almost all respects.  RJB.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Loved this book very much. Such a good read and it keeps you wanting to know more with every side of the story!
B000Y179KO|5.0|its the eagles, what else do i have to say about it. eagles eagles eagles great s*** my man woop!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is my favorite game to play when I'm bored, and every other time of day. I highly recommend this game.
B007R21JJK|5.0|I have built a hand full of PC's now and find the Gigabyte Motherboards are solid and work right out of the box.
B004SBQGHS|4.0|This is a fun, and sometimes frustrating, game to while away some time with when you are some place you have to wait
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|This app does exactly what it is advertised to do, and does it perfectly. Amazingly easy to use, and free? wow! I've always been leery of things that seemed too good to be true, but Clean Master is the exception. Well done, Ks Mobile. I'll have to check out some of your other apps.
B0086700CM|5.0|when is temple run 2 coming out for kindle? I have it for my ipod but kindle doesn't have it yet.
B00AQ3K8IU|2.0|Let's get real:  How did Holder get to be such a \\"Casanova\\" at the tender age of 17?  Kids at this age are inexperienced and immature.  Even if they regularly \\"make out\\", or \\"do it\\" with their boyfriend or girlfriend, the experience is clumsy, awkward, and far from sensual.  The author writes as if Sky and especially Holder, are much older than they are.  I thought this book was going to be better.  Having worked at several high schools as a teacher for over 30 years, and knowing about the help and resources that are out there for kids like Sky, I thought the book was unrealistic.  The kids are left alone to fend for themselves (especially when confronting Sky's dad and later, Karen) with no adult to help.  After Sky witnesses her dad's suicide, she and Holder have sex?  Doesn't make sense.  On to my next read. . .I'm certain it will be a better one.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Was hoping to do some light reading at night but ending up reading till 5am in the morning two nights in a row.  And now that I finished book one, I already want to start on book two...
159420411X|5.0|Nate here has made a fairly accessible and interesting book with some very valuable lessons about predictions and managing data. Some of the approaches he lays out here will make you think deeply about your own predictions and more importantly learn to cleave through the mountain of crap in political forecasting. It doesn't take the cheap route of cynicism about everything but shows how some people make really good predictions while others are just blowhards.<br /><br />If you can parse the stats talk, this is a very valuable read.
B0057KXXFM|3.0|If Limp Bizkit ever wants me to buy one of their CD's again, start including an instrumental version of the album, a.k.a. a \\"FRED-less\\" version.  I mean i can appreciate the sort of intentional stupidity of their work as a whole, but his voice and stupid little wannabe gangsta-ish sayings just get old and annoying very quickly.  Now the instrumentals?  THOSE, i can see myself rockin' out to in my car or in my headphones.  Wes' guitar work may not be anything technically impressive, but its fun and catchy and weird.  Love it.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|I loved this book; wish there were more!! I would recommend it to anyone who loves books of this genre.
B00A6PD8RQ|5.0|I watched in on Amazon Instant and it was worth it. It was good to watch it before buying it. My daughter loved it!
B001UV4XIS|5.0|my son wanted this movie for christmas, it's a great movie no matter how old you are, harry just rocks
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|I love the game but it kept stopping on me why I don't know if u fix the game it would of been funner
B000GBEWHA|5.0|Daughter wanted this movie for christmas, it's a great movie no matter how old you are, blast from the past
B003JTHXOK|4.0|but I really like this book.  It was a little different (because of the ending) but an interesting read. Would recommend..
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|If you don't mind intermittent ads (and I don't), a great way to try this exceptionally popular (& often frustrating - Die you pigs!) game.  While you're at it, get the free Angry Birds Seasons as well.
B006LSZECO|1.0|FROM THE BEGINNING OF THE BOOK I COULDN'T GET INTO IT.<br />STORY WAS SO UNREALISTIC & BORING.............FAST FWD TO NEAR THE END TO SEE IF IT PICKED UP ANY.........BUT NO<br />HATED IT
B005LAJ16I|5.0|thank you, great series, not Damian Lewis at his best as it does not show his comic side, the writing is rather predictable and it is more the dreaded threat from the Arab world kind of thing.  Claire Danes, and I was not a huge fan is very good in this role.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|STORY CATCHES YOUR ATTENTION FROM THE FIRST PAGE.  FAST READING & REALLY NICE STORY<br />CAN'T WAIT TO SEE THE MOVIE NOW
B006LSZECO|4.0|I kept hearing chatter about how this was a very good book, so I bought it for my Kindle while on vacation. For the first half of the book, I read it voraciously, and couldn't put it down. The author kept you guessing, and you wanted to see what would be unveiled next. A twist is revealed around the middle of the book, and that is the point where I think it lost something. It was still good - still enjoyable - but it slowed the pace of the story down. I think if the author had ended the book strongly, that twist wouldn't have mattered. However, I thought the ending kind of fizzled out. I am glad I read it, and can say I enjoyed the story overall. I just wish the second half could have matched the strength of the first.
1475143389|5.0|Informative and easy read.  I took this book with me while I toured Europe and read it multiple times.  I found the book to be very informative, and I wish I would have read it a few years ago, as I have never progressed passed the \\"beginner results\\".  My dad read the book and I just bought a copy for him.  I haven't started on the workout yet, as I lent the book out to a coworker.  I just picked up The Shredded Chef, so once I get BLS back I'll be set.  I'll revisit this post once I've implemented the workout program and diet.<br /><br />On a side note, I received a personal email from the author, Michael Matthews, after I purchased BLS, asking me if I had any questions.  I did have a few questions to which he provided answers to.  I actually find that to be an additional benefit to the book; being able to email the author.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Such a great book....the end will keep you on the edge of your seat!! Can't wait for the movie to come out.
B00723NWJE|5.0|Norah Jones is tops in her genre.  This has to be her best yet.  Every song is uniquely her but each has its own special merits.  This is one of my current favorites.
B00A8SPNYW|4.0|Clever idea, definitely entertaining, sometimes easy, sometimes tricky (to beat the time limit).  I have a few levels that I just can't figure out how to get three stars on - I can't beat the time limit that is set to get the thrid star and that is frustrating! It would be great if there was a help site that would give a solution on how to do it.  I'd like to know!! I have enjoyed the game.
B0038M2AZA|5.0|Not only was I deeply moved by a beautiful movie, the service by which it came to me exceeded expectation in all aspects.
B009D0LBRO|5.0|I just love this character and this game - it is challenging for me, but I keep on trying and trying! Great graphics!! Very fun.
B0014P3N3Q|5.0|I LOVE this book! It is incredible. Arrived in amazing condition, A great read! Leaves me yearning for more and more.
B00AQF8CJ0|5.0|This is a great game - it is a challenge to cover up all the stars and I never want to quit until I can solve it - which is sometimes quite a long time! I love it - very unique and entertaining.
B00A9C3RB8|4.0|I recommend seeing the movie at least  once. It's sad and awkward in parts but has a happy ending.  Prefer happy movies. Meryl and tommy are excellent actors as usual
B004ZA9HB4|4.0|I was able to download and install but once the main menu appeared it wouldn't open. I never got farther than that before I had to delete the app.<br />***  Edited to say that the app did open now that I have reinstalled it.  The developers were responsive to my problem which was nice of them.
B004G5ZY7E|1.0|Couldn't &#34;plow&#34; through it!  Seldom do I quit on a book but this one was too much of a struggle.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|For anyone who appreciates what our military goes though and does, this book is great.  To follow along on the most anticipated mission of our generation keeps the interest at a fever pitch.<br />.
B001ANYDAO|3.0|This book was a very simple read. Straight forward, interesting but nothing that kept me glued to the pages.I like Gladwell 's writing so I'm not knocking the book. Content wise it was a unique concept. Once the thesis is laid out, this who  are wildly  successful are a product of multiple unique opportunities, it predictable. I'd recommend this book to any one who likes Gladwell 's writing topic and appreciates unique topic.
B00AHSMDQY|4.0|even with the fancy special effects, the story was slow.  It did give some background info ending up with a good finish.
B005I6EU7U|5.0|This looks great, is light weight, feels elegant and amazingly resembles a book!  I am so very pleased with this!
B00A757EFW|4.0|The game is fine, just like the original arcade game that I grew up with.  I found the Pac-Pad difficult to use and the Flick option is much better for navigation. Too bad smartphones don't come with joy sticks!
B008MM9630|5.0|I enjoy this game. I wish it was easier to get the diamonds. Also the animals. I will keep playing
B004L9MFM2|4.0|A nice part 2.. though i thought it dragged a little bit about war details, and one really needs to keep referring to the map and appendix every now n again to figure out who is who..<br /><br />Enjoyable read.<br /><br />10 more books to go!
B0076NAVNA|3.0|Tried to get into this, maybe will try again. I'm a big Portnoy fan and i don't think he shines (or stands out) like he does with his other projects. But who am i, i am not a musician.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|Perfect way to store our HP collection without having tons of disks around. The price was great too, couldn't beat $30 for an 8 disk set!
B0010SKUYM|5.0|I really enjoyed this book.  So much that I have trouble enjoying authors whose stories used to entrance me.  This book is a complete page turner.  Everyone I have recommended it to has reported reading it much faster than they usually go through a book, immediatly started the sequal, starting complaining about the third/final book not being available yet, and quoting the book throughout their day.  If you enjoy Tolkein, Heinlein, Asimov, Kim Stanly Robinson, Ayn Rand, or C.S. Lewis, then read this book and add Rothfuss to your list of favorite authors.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Had the opportunity to see how the birds and pigs didn't care for one another.  Having Angry Birds on my last trip made the time go by.
B00A6N8F4Y|3.0|I expected more from this story and was a little let down.  Even though I am not a big fan of his, I thought that Travolta was the best actor in this film.  I am usually a big fan of all the other actors, but they all felt a little shallow/hollow.  I did not think it was an accurate portrayal of the weed trade, but probably more reflected the trafficking of much harder drugs like cocaine or meth.  I do not believe that you can have a successful three-way love affair, for long.
1574214276|5.0|This is a great book if you are into Zentangle!  the illustrations are very simple and I love the projects.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|It took a few months before I could actually get into the characters and story line.  I would read a couple of pages and then put it down.  After seeing the media frenzy about the contents I felt compelled to see what everyone was talking about.  When I finally did read enough to get into the characters I was swept up in their world and wanted to read more.
B005NJ2K6U|5.0|I simply love this game.  I play it all the time. However, I think the puzzle part is hard and I never have gotten one of them.  Lots of other people feel the same way about this part of the puzzle.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I love this cause it keeps you thinkin'! I recommend it to everyone! It helps that it was free also..lol
B003VSVWA0|5.0|There are only 12 songs here, taken from various concerts on the 2009 tour of Europe and the U.S. They are wonderful recordings, long and live versions, the sound is great. I just wish there was lots more. The concert I attended was several hours long and I tried to absorb every moment of it all. Cohen has matured yes, even aged, yes, and his voice reflects it, but he is sincere, heartfelt, and utterly into his music. If you ever liked any of the older songs, you will like his overall style and the gravity he can now bring to his subjects.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I finally get what all the hype is about! I am not a game person but this is just too funny..I actually giggle at the birds!!
B003VIWO8Y|4.0|Great read, anyone that is a fan of Megadeth needs to read this book... So much detail into Dave's life and the workings of the band... I was a big fan of Dave's since I learned that he accepted Christ into his life, neat to read how his failures in life turned into such a great testimony for the love of God... No this is not a &#34;preachy&#34; book either, it is just a great read... so... read it and enjoy....
B0086700CM|4.0|I downloaded this game cause it was free! But it is a fun game and it kills time while waiting in line!  I recommend it for everyone!
B0084U0IEG|2.0|its such a SLOW story, and not much happened or at least not what I was hoping for in a spy novel.
B00AMBH70S|4.0|I am a big fan of the Bourne Trilogy and was skeptical to watch this. I was worried it would be a case of no knowing when to quit. However, it was pretty good and I was pleasantly surprised.
B00846REIS|4.0|Love the story but not the ending. There wasn't an actual ending. It just stopped very abruptly. What the heck.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Minecraft is so awesome. It's so open world and that's really what I like in a video game. Mojang great job in making this the best game ever!!!
B004DM0UII|1.0|I deleted this app from my Kindle Fire because it flat out did not work. I would have hated to have paid money for it.
1401324029|5.0|This is a great follow up to the initial novel. The first one was a little thin but this book is much longer and even better. It's a good suspense/murder novel that is an easy read.
B0052RDHTM|4.0|An epic WW2 novel by Ken Follett, follows characters throughout Europe and the United States. The reader gains a strong sense of the cause, hardships, and aftermath of this devastating event in the world.
B000MNP2K8|4.0|The debut of Daniel Craig as James Bond. It's a good James Bond movie that relaunches the series. I recommend it.
B0022Q8CSC|3.0|I absolutely loved the movie, great american cinema. The trouble is it is absolutely faithful to the book strange criticism I know but I was hoping or depth that was not present
B0053O89WY|5.0|The Big Bang Theory keeps getting better and better each season. I bought this to add to my growing collection.
B0087GZ8YW|3.0|A somewhat disappointing read more suited for true Rebus fans. A shame as it had more promise than final execution.
B00684J49U|5.0|I'm a fan of the series so I always buy the newest set. I like this set for the features.
B0044XRIMW|5.0|No matter how many times I watch this movie, I love to sing along with it.  My granddaughters are now singing along with me.
B001TCHDPS|5.0|I saw the Movie 'Searching for Sugar Man' and was really impressed with his music so bought this new CD.
B0012QVJXS|4.0|I think you should watch it.  Lois Lane is kind of irritating and Christopher Reeve way overdoes the dorky Clark Kent but its still pretty good.
B001BKVWYG|5.0|It was a great surprise to find that Rodriguez had two CD's. I just had to buy the second one!
B00992CF6W|1.0|one day my progress was saved and ok! then yesterday I went back on to finish building my townhouse complex then I go on and its all GONE! I go to check on my other saved games and THAT progress was gone too! I demand for my progress to be back!!!
B005LAII80|4.0|This movie set out to entertain, and it did its job well. I really appreciate that it did not try to be something it's not-  it did NOT try to be \\"cerebral\\" or \\"thought-provoking\\" or \\" mysterious\\"... No, it is just showing you a day in the life of a Judge.  Also, having the contrast of the veteran training the rookie was pretty nice as well.  Vastly entertaining.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|I am thoroughly enjoying season 1 and 2.  I heard about the series from friends and their recommendations were so positive, I had to see the series myself.  Very glad I decided to give myself my own Christmas present.
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|I am kind of disorganized. I forget things and if I write them down I would lose the paper I wrote it on Evernote helps me keep track of everything making my life a lot more productive.
0307346617|5.0|Son is a BIG reader and he requested this for Christmas since he always reads the book before he sees a movie.  Hasn't read it yet so don't know his opinion which he is sure to give.  He should be a critic.
B004GJDQT8|4.0|Some aspects of this app aren't as ideal as sitting at a desktop to browse Amazon, but it gets the job done if you are on a mobile device.  Everything you need is still there, it is just a little slower than using a real internet browser.
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|What a great character.  I hope that the writers don't give up on Pendergast.  I love reading about this obscure mysterious agent.
B009G3T01M|5.0|My new favorite album! The songs are really down to earth and heart felt. The beats are very cool and make me want to listen over and over again. Keep up the great work guys!
B006RXQ0JO|1.0|Paid 99 cents& couldn't watch because there was no volume!  Very frustrating!  We then rented Total Recall & it had volume
B007N5YIUS|3.0|Angry birds is probably the most played video game ever.  This expansion for it adds some new physics but it is still the same objective.  Destroy the pig forts.  It ran well on my device (Asus TF101). Angry birds just doesn't interest me much though.
B0086700CM|2.0|this game is fun but streaker run is 10 times better and is funnier check it out in the appstore
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Nicholas Sparks has a good concept of how to write his characters so that you can get past the fact that they are just characters in a book. They become someone you care about and love, or hate as the case could be.<br /><br />Having read many of his books, he also has a concept that works. A single adult with child(ren) meets a broken opposite sex adult with some sort of baggage, such as an ex husband or wife. They fall in love and have to overcome their issues. It works well in this book. You find yourself routing for the good guy and gal.<br /><br />I love Sparks detailing where his characters live. Not having spent too much time in the south, ne describes the area, weather and people to the extent that you feel you have been transported there.<br /><br />This is a good, easy, fun read. I had to interrupt another book to get this read before the movie comes out. It was worth it.
B0015DROBO|4.0|Very very good<br /><br />Little slow at first but once it picks up you won't be able to put it down
B004UJAOLM|5.0|I read this book when I was in high school and again when I was a young adult. I purchased this to read it again. That should tell you how much I love this book.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I have read every book Grisham has written and I'm always \\"Blown Away\\" by his impeccable writing  and how his brilliant mind continues to produce books that hold your interest at every twist and turn. It baffles me how he produces such fiction with such a real feeling by the reader.. His writing is AMAZING!
B004ZZS4CC|4.0|This was a hard book to read but real. That is why it was so hard. Sometimes it is easier to read this type of story, though I wouldn't normally, when it is just fiction. To think of what this young lady went through and came out strong is amazing. My love goes out to her and her young daughters, with prayers that their life continues on as &#34;normally&#34; as possible for them.<br /><br />Do not purchase this book if you cannot handle man's inhumanity to others. I hope this man and his wife never leave jail and serve hard time while they are their - not unlike what they put her through.
B009YN2M7S|5.0|I have read quite a few Nicholas sparks books and this one tops them all. I loved that the main focus was not only on the couple in love but also on their past and their future and most importantly family. I could barely put this book down he never fails to make the reader on the edge of their seat.
B003BW0CB6|5.0|Michael Connelly is a good writer and keeps his characters real. I love the Lincoln lawyer and Connelly's Bosch stories. I look forward to reading more of them.<br /><br />This is a good story, as the character takes on a prosecution case instead of working the other side of the aisle as he normally does. This lends a dramatic change to how he does business.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I really like this app. I really do. I really really do. I really really really really do. I mean I REALLY like this game
0425263908|5.0|Arrived on time and in great condition. Another Sylvia Day novel that I enjoyed very much. I read this book in less than 2 weeks. Couldn't put it down.
B0070Y46UY|1.0|The story of the book is interesting, Unfortunately, it was stolen from a book from Moacyr Scliar named \\"Max and the Cats\\".<br /><br />I am surprised and sad that most people just don't care at all about the plagiarism, which is blatant. Unfortunately, Scliar was a tired old man (he has died since) and just didn't have the resources and patience to sue. I hope his heirs do. None should get rich and sell seven million copies of a stolen story.<br /><br />Plagiarism hurts art and the artists.<br /><br />Google Scliar for many articles on the press about the plagiarism.<br /><br /> Martel was so dishonest that he said he had only read a (non-existent) review of the book, but the story is the same: someone who flees from a country in a boat full of animals, suffers a shipwreck and survives in a dinghy with a feral feline. For goodness sake, people have been sued for doing 10% of this.
0425263916|5.0|Arrived on time. Great book. If you enjoy adult fantasy books,this is a great one to read. Sylvia Day is an outstanding author. Haven't come across a book of hers yet that I haven't enjoyed.
B008FPOIT6|5.0|This book was a lot of fun to read.  Skepticism, Data Visualization, Google, Maker/Tech culture, combined with old bookstores, secretive groups, a mystery, and interesting characters.  Is this a new genre? I also appreciate the inclusion of female characters who are distinctly different from each other, who have interests beyond the main character, and who have as much or more depth as any of the supporting characters. I'm very much looking forward to more from Robin Sloane.
B009329Y30|5.0|After reading the book I was very excited to hear they were making it into a movie. A very different, great story.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book as awesome! I suggest you all read it! Colleen Hoover your work is amazing! Everyon e read this book!
B00A8ECU24|5.0|I maybe too old for games like this but it doesn't hurt to be young again. Heck, I'm 21 and I'm playing this game. Don't go saying this game is for kids only if u don't trust kids putting their hands on your kindle or any other device. Anyways the graphics on this game is great and when I play this game it takes the stress out of my mind and it helps me pass the time when I get bored. This is a game for all ages but there's one itty bitty problem.... There needs to be more games like this. Needs more ponies!
0143119680|5.0|I have read A Discovery of Witches many times.<br />The writing, the attention to detail, the unlikely love between a witch, Diana Bishop and a vampire, Matthew Clairmont, is beautifully written, and shows love holds no boundaries.<br />Each character comes to life and springs from the page into your heart. You care for them. Root for them. Admire their courage and dedication.<br />Setting us up for the sequel, we too raise up up our legs to go with the pair into the past to find Bishop's teacher.<br />Amazing read.<br />Ellen George, author and reviewer
B008N1V11U|4.0|Great game, but after you beat the story mode, you go into free roam mode and when you clear all the areas, there is nothing left to do but glide around the city like a lunatic.
B000SCHBGQ|4.0|I look forward to reading the rest in the series. Although written for a younger audience, The Alchemist is entertaining to an adult who enjoys light reading. A quick read good for a rainy afternoon.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|subway surfer is awesome. if you get it you can compete and see who can get more coins and or points
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This app is amazing I love it I love it I love it I love it I love it subway suffers rocks
B0091REZMW|4.0|This games is fun but it's way to easy. It's good for kid's if there into mystery games or find it games.
B006LSZECO|3.0|Would have been better if he had been guilty and went through a trial, like Scott Peterson.  At least one of the characters was a sociopath.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|I thought this was good book with a good story line and a major twist. I really got to like the characters.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|this is a very good way to kill some time. it keeps me interested by getting much harder each go around.  I would recommend it.
B003ODIZL6|4.0|It has every thing I need to know when I'm older.<br />I didn't like that a lot of the words I didn't know what they mean and how to pronouce the words.
B000EHSVSC|5.0|A very captivating film with history from both sides and interesting facts about the pre activities before the bombing of Pearl Harbor.
B003YL4LYI|1.0|I read the previous four books. Martin is brilliant writer, but there was no redemption afforded the main characters. Anytime you became attached to a character, whether bad or good, you would anticipate some change of heart to good or have the good characters achieve the completion of their efforts. This never happened! What you can expect is them dying a horrible death. Every main character that did not die was left suspended with no closure. I truly anticipated that this fifth book would have tied all the many plots and characters of the previous four books together. On top of all this, you get tired of the debauchery and foul images painted throughout; too many rapes and too many disembowelments. Evidently, G.R.Martin, although he lived in this world of his, could not bring his characters to conclusion.
B004ZA9HB4|5.0|I must admit, This application is nifty for viewing DLNA shares on your local network either on your tablet or you can push the video to a compatible TV or streaming media devices connected to your TV. But what caught my attention was the ability to view tons of streaming media channels that this application has to offer. Just for that feature alone it is worth the download. You can watch tons of free content like NY times, Revision 3, Discover channel right on your tablet and is seen to work great! without any buffering issues - Earlier one needed to download specific app from those streaming media providers for that purpose, this nifty app does it all and IMHO quite beautifully presented.<br /><br />To add to the list of goodies If you have a compatible TV or a streaming media device like [[ASIN:B005KOZNBW WD TV Live ]]connected to your TV you can push the video to that device and it will play just fine. Basically this is all-in-one solution for media enthusiastic person who has tons of media on the device or stacked somewhere on a NAS share on local LAN may it be those precious family photos or videos which you can watch directly on the Android tablet or push that content to TV to share with family or friends.<br /><br />The app discovers DLNA shares on your local LAN without any difficulty and I was able to stream off my [[ASIN:B0064XAIZY WD My Book Live Duo ]] NAS share and view photos and videos effortlessly. You do need to have compatible media for it to work or it will hand it off to other apps installed apps that will play the video or music files for you on your Android tablet.<br /><br />I use [[ASIN:B008K6DU4Y MX Player]] for my videos and it works great on my Samsung Galaxy Tab 10.1! check that app out and you will find that this [[ASIN:B004ZA9HB4 iMediaShare]] has great potential when used together for playing local media on your NAS share and DLNA servers on your local network.<br /><br />For a FAOTD this is a gem!

B009WJ44KC|5.0|Any fan of John Williams should not hesitate to buy this album. Some tracks are reminiscent of his score for Saving Private Ryan. Great Americana cues as well.
B0063GORYU|5.0|If you love making disorder orderly, then you'll love this game!  Just when you think this is going to be too easy,the next deal makes you have to change your whole strategy.
B002TXZRIG|4.0|This is written in her usual genre - that of forensic medicine/crime. It is a very good read, especially if the reader is interested in this genre.
B0086700CM|1.0|I got this game, and I just had to play it every time I got on my kindle fire, but it only lasted about a week before it stopped working. I read other reviews and saw that on other people's kindle fires it wasn't tilting either, so it wasn't just me. THIS NEEDS FIXED, because I want my game back.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|Great graphics, and a real challenge.  I would recommend to any one who enjoys playing games on their electronic media purchases.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Disappointed with the ending, but other than that I loved it!!! I will definitely read the next book! And the next one to!
B004SBQGHS|1.0|I totally love Angry Birds, but none of the games (Space, Seasons, Star Wars) load on my Android tablet, and when I search the Market on Android phone, none of the games are listed, which says to me, they are not compatible with Android. I'm not sure if the game's inability to launch/load is because of antivirus updates, file incompatibilities, screen resolution, or Apple monopolizing the market, but I think Amazon should remove the product because I've lost $ on the regular Angry Birds game. Be sure to try the FREE games first before paying anything.
B006XF5BTG|5.0|Just finished this book and it was an eye opener for me. I have been training the 12,10,8,6 method (body for life) for quite some time. Very excited to give this new plan on shorter and heavier lifts a try and see how my body responds. Very educational on nutrition as well and breaking down how we really should be eating. Starting program tomorrow. If I remember, maybe ill give an update in 10 weeks. If everything works out maybe ill change to five stars (love it). For now I like it, but can't say love it just quite yet. I would recommend this to others.<br /><br />Update: 4 weeks in and changing stars to 5!
0345803485|4.0|When I first heard about the book, I really had no desire to read it.  However my sister had it and asked me if I would like to read it and after 2 days I am already on the 3rd book.  I'll admit some of the punctuation and point of view of writing could be fixed but the concept of the story is not for the faint of heart.  To truly understand this book, I feel that you need to understand a dom/sub lifestyle.  Every emotion she felt, I could relate to.  I very much enjoy a dom/sub lifestyle and others who do as well will like this book.  Granted that main male character does have some issues, you have to have compassion and understanding for it.  I think the main female character deep down is submissive but due to her inexperience it's hard to accept and adjust.  Some of the scenarios made me laugh because she is so defiant and I could put myself in her place.  All in all I think it is a good read and if you enjoy/live a dom/sub lifestyle, I think you will enjoy it too.  Good luck
B00AREIAI8|5.0|The discription of this game is in the title! This is an amazing game for all horse lovers out there!
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Annenbeth and Percy get chucked in the Underworld,Tarturus. But it was a good book overall. Team Leo is freaken awesome!

B009VLX8FS|5.0|I love this CD! It is probably one my favorites from her. Some fo the songs have a different sound than before and I love it! Great job Tay Tay!
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|This book is so good! It has such good fantasy in it and good descriptions in it, you feel like you are there! You can imagine the Hammer-Heads and Dorothy and the Cowardly Lion and The Wildman. You can imagine the Wonderful wizard.
B006M9NJFG|5.0|best canteen ive ever owned,you should put water in it before you drink it because it smell like shoe plastic,but still great
B008OOYALE|4.0|The game is fun same as the the others ( bakery story, restaurant story)  But like them the game does not offer the same functions or features that the same game gets on the Ipod's.  Also takes longer to get the updates and the new &#34;seasons&#34;  The game is the same as on the other apps but don't talk to anyone who has this on their ipod.  they get a lot more buidlings and extras that are not offered on the kindle app or any android app.
B004RGHWIQ|5.0|Beautiful and witty. worth owning in 3D - the visuals will make me want to watch this again and show it to my friends.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Awesome book!!!  I could not put the book down. Heartwarming emotional love story with very passionate characters. A MUST READ!!!!
B00000DI06|4.0|And I also love religious music. It's nice to see  modern classical music like this. Beautiful, spiritual and charming. I enjoyed it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is fun and I think it is the  best game on the Amazon app store.  I play this game all the time and it is way better when it is bigger on a kindle
B00A80SHFM|4.0|I was disappointed in that it is a not a full recording. Music that I know and love is not there.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This book was just as awesome as the rest. I love this whole story and want to reread it all now!
B0086700CM|5.0|This is a good game for all ages and I love it. My four year old cusin can even play it. Great time passer. Get this game.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|Quite possibly the finest book I've ever read.  And that is no exaggeration, a great read.  Compelling, true science, you grow to know and love the main character and suffer and laugh along with him.  Just amazing.
B004EPYSN2|5.0|I really think that Marion Zimmer Bradley is the most stunning Author.  She writes with authority and has obviously done lot's of study and thinking about what she wants in this book.  Her characters are stunningly defined, and as you read, you feel that you are there with them.  I would recomend this book for anyone. The story line is stunning and you do not want to put it down. It is very intrigueing as the story is told from the womens point of veiw and it makes the Arthurian legends even more interesting.  I sugest that anyone  who is interested in the Period of Arthur read this book. it is absolutely fantastic.
B004NK3MMQ|5.0|Incredibly perfect. Quite possibly the best movie soundtrack yet. Sung by Alex Turner of The Arctic Monkeys; truly a flawless record.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|It is the greatest love story, we have a awesome Father God. It is just like God to make what could have been a tragic experience into a world wide love experience, thank you for sharing your testimony. It is so similar in many ways after I had a sub arachnoid hemorrhage..... in every way I am better since that experience. Keep loving, BTLU
B000GCFY0I|5.0|An amazing book! I can't wait to jump right in to the world again in \\"the pretties\\". I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a beautifully written book to pass the time.
B000HT3PPG|5.0|This is a Timeless film.  My family will be watching it 100 years from now.<br />There are some things to go in a time capsule for future generations.<br />This is what I have put in mine.

B006LSZECO|3.0|This was one of those books that I couldn't put down. I couldn't wait to read each subsequent page to see where the story took me. I was so excited when my kindle showed me at 95% complete because this meant Nick was closer to exacting his much deserved revenge. And then kablooie, the ridiculous, anti-climactic ending. If I wanted to immerse myself in a storyline that ends in this manner, I would waste my time watching reality television where the \\"characters\\" thrive on self-absorbed drama. I will never waste my time reading another book by this author. She apparently enjoys wasting the reader's time and I have no desire to read material that leaves me feeling duped and quite frankly, pissed off.

B005LAIIJY|5.0|\\"Django Unchained\\" is awesome.  Admittedly, I am a Tarantino fan.  All of his movies have such a diverse and interesting cast of characters and such witty and interesting dialog that if one walks away from any of his films not entertained, somehow I think they may have either missed the point or they simply don't like Tarantino's style.  \\"Django Unchained\\" had everything... acts of justice and revenge, a beautiful and poignant love story, self sacrifice and laugh out loud humor.  Every emotion one could possibly have is intricately woven into the story of a former slave, who by chance, is rescued by and partnered with a benevolent German former dentist turned bounty hunter (lol) who ultimately helps his new companion buy his wife's (who speaks German, by the way) freedom from an artificially genteel, sociopathic plantation owner who is aided by a self hating, emotionally misdirected house slave.  How's that for cinematic range - LOL!!<br /><br />Oh... and let's not overlook the fact that the main character is an African American man / hero who has loved, yearned and never forgotten about his African American wife who's rescue, it would seem, had always been his priority.  Sadly, one does not often see, even in today's cinema, two Black Americans cast in such a moving and evolved light (Thank You, Quentin!).  Every actor in this movie did an outstanding job -- -- and, in my opinion, Leonardo DiCaprio's interpretation of his character (plantation owner Monsieur Calvin Candie) in \\"Django Unchained\\" is the best he's done since \\"Romeo & Juliet\\" and \\"The Quick & The Dead\\".  Jamie Foxx, Kerry Washington, Christoph Waltz and Sam Jackson were fantastic...  Heck, even Don Johnson did a fantastic job!<br /><br />A note of caution:  like many Tarantino films (*think \\"Reservoir Dogs\\", \\"Kill Bill Volume I\\" and \\"From Dusk Til Dawn\\"), the graphic violence in \\"Django Unchained\\" is high.  That is the one aspect of his movies that I've always had a difficult time with, but the plots, unique and quirky characters, awesome acting and ingenious dialog more than make up for it.<br /><br />I believe this movie is one of the best, if not the best film Quentin Tarantino has done in his career and that's really saying something since his other movies aren't too shabby!  When it is released for download / dvd I will be purchasing it.<br /><br />Loved this movie!!!unique and quirky characters, awesome acting and ingenious dialog more than make up for it.<br /><br />I believe this movie is one of the best, if not the best film Quentin Tarantino has done in his career and that's really saying something since his other movies aren't too shabby!

I got it on my kindle fire and on my iPhone, but neither one works right. Have also filed support claims with no response or further contact and apology, let alone an actual fix. Save yourself the time and high blood pressure and pick another game!

B00AAX68HG|4.0|family-friendly, fun, our three year old loves to poke the monsters, the music &amp; the game is challenging enough without being frustrating.
B009G78EE2|5.0|While it's hip-hop start to finish, each songs has its own feel and the album take you on a diverse journey. Listen to the lyrics, this album make a bold statement but not at the expense of the music.
B009G8GRX6|3.0|There are a few good songs on this album, but unfortunately it just felt like more of the same to me. I was also annoyed by the hypocracy of it, especially the last two songs (the title songs, I suppose). They're more or less talking about how our current way of life isn't sustainable (as dictated by the second law of thermodynamics), but how much energy has the band wasted touring the world? How big are their houses? How many cars do they own?
0786962984|4.0|My family has been enjoying this game. We are still figuring it out but it can be a lot of fun. My 5 year old enjoys this game but can't play it without help when it comes to the math. If not for the math he would easily be able to play. We just play with all treasure up to make it fair. My husband enjoys it. I think it is an ok game with some strategy and fun too.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|I like some of the games, but some are near impossible, so it can be hard to advance.  Also I accidentally hit a popup and it locked up the game til I deleted and reloaded from cloud, so I lost all my points and progress.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|I adored this book and felt a sense of loneliness when it was finished. The characters became part of my life. Vivid and inspirational. Wonderful.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|Really enjoyed the read.  I like technical detailed descriptions and this book had them.  The story moved along and blended in humor great.
B009UX2YAC|1.0|this app is great but it shut my kindle down and when I turned it back on all my progress from this app was gone. my highscore was zero and my missing was at the beginning. plus I had only Jake and the starter boards. I had unlocked Tricky, Lucy, Tagbot, and Tony but they are no longer unlocked. I wish this app would fix its problems. I don't know who else this has happened to but if you have had this issue then please like this or whatever you can do. Maybe we can get Kiloo to resolve this error.
B00AMBK6J2|4.0|I had heard mixed reviews on this one. We liked it. Kept us in stitches for most of the movie.
B004ZA9HB4|1.0|I have an android phone with Allshare (samsung galaxy S2) and I have Verizon fios which allows me to access the internet on my tv, but this app still did NOT Work on my tv and I don't know why.  According to the description, this app is supposed to work on ANY television without hassle and without jumping through hoops in settings since we cannot control settings on public tvs or our friend's tv.  I tried playing a video from my phone on my tv using this app and there was no request for permission or any thing else.<br /><br />Simply put, this app DOES NOT WORK as advertised!!!!!
B000I9VZJ8|5.0|My son received this for Christmas.  He has already seen it, but was happy to have it added to our collection.  When he watches it, he can't help but imitate the way Napoleon talks.  This is a very funny, different movie that we can all enjoy.  Even our two year old has asked to put it on for her.  Ha!  Thank you to the makers of this movie for a really fun, clean show!!
B005CRQ4XI|5.0|An amazing journey,  could not be put down!<br /><br />It was like you were there, with each step of her journey.

B009X01D9U|3.0|This case is fine, but one thing makes me crazy.  The charging port cannot be accessed unless the case is open.  This may not sound like much, but it is aggravating & I would not recommend buying because of this flaw.  For $50, i expected a little more

B003AVPV1O|5.0|Four Stars  for the VGA Video Splitter Cable.  Works great, easy to use and would highly recommend this.  I would buy it again.
B005IQZB14|5.0|The word for this book is compelling. I really got into the book and many times got so engrossed I lost the awareness of reading. What more can you ask of a book.  Her description of the life that she lived before the hike is painful to read. So is her lack of preparation for the hike. She picked out her equipment and made her way to California and started hiking having never done any hiking before. Her body had to toughen up on the go. By the time she finished months later she could hike \\"the big miles.\\"<br /><br />I give the book five stars out of five. It is really a great read.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Very well written.  Keeps you wanting to read more.  Her format really gets you into the characters.  I loved it
B008JGSM6G|5.0|It makes you challange yourself every time. It is great to have to think about each move. My family all play this game
0670024813|4.0|I was eager to recieve this latest book by Jared Diamond. I now have four of his books in my library and am quite impressed by his work and his ability to relay this information to laymen who may never have the opportunity to view these cultures in person. Some of the comparisons he makes between early civilizations and modern society are both foreboding and at the same time enlightening. The details grant us an opportunity to actually view in documented form the manner in which our own world and way of life may be at risk by continuing to make the same mistakes earlier civilizations have made.
B008133JZG|5.0|understated yet riveting in the inimitable British way.<br /><br />This made me want to read and see the older versions of Hound of Baskervilles, etc.<br /><br />Perfect casting.

B0002VFXFE|5.0|Use this in all builds from i7 to single cores. Have been around the block with other products of the same. This is the best.

Arrived in perfect shape, packed well, and early delivery. Amazon is the place to purchase it.
B00AHSIQWE|5.0|Amazing! Totally true to he 12 cents comic book from the 60's!  I only wish that there could be one more!
B0090SI4KG|4.0|This Movie was Awesome and Action Packed and Big Arnold really did a Good Job since his Last Film which was Terminator 3.And some of the Actors in it I didnt like Like Forest Whitaker which I f#$%ing Hate and that One Ugly old Fat Mexican Guy That is A cop in this movie those are the Only Actors I hate in this Movie that is why I give it 4 Stars But Overall this is a Good Action Film.If your Looking for another Kick Butt Action Movie with Arnold this is it.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Great book. Need more than just these three books. I enjoyed all three of them. Loved the plot. Wonderful book
B002OUT604|4.0|A handful of songs, like the swordfight, don't hold up that well outside of the movie, but some are absolutely amazing. I could listen to Storybook Love and I Will Never Love Again all day. Mark Knopfler is a versatile and amazing artist. Everyone should own this soundtrack.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I love the second book in this emotion riddled saga! There is something so endearing about thus story and I am really looking forward to seeing what's next!
B0036RCVJM|5.0|The author went through hardships that defy the imagination. Let alone any sense of decency and humanity.<br />And yet when he finally meets one of his tormenters 50 years later, he manages to make us understand how he found it possible to forgive.<br />A must for anyone who wants to know how to rise above all the horror of stupid hierarchy and its brutality.<br />It's a book about a horrible side of human war that in the end makes us feel better about humanity.<br />A hard task that mr Lomax fully succeeds at.
B006LSZECO|4.0|This is the first time I have read anything by Gillian Flynn. I really enjoyed how the characters \\"talked\\" to the reader and I liked the flow of the story.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Seriously the best book i have ever read!!!!! From start to finish, i could not put it down! Worth every penny and then some!
B00280LYIC|5.0|The book was filled with action adventure and friendship. There is also a very interesting part in the end<br /><br />Good book
B004ZA9HB4|1.0|Requires Facebook login. That enough is a dealbreaker for me. Especially for a paid app. Stay away if you don't want to be treated as an advertising lab rat.
B000JMKQX0|4.0|Good wish there was a little more action though... but so different and in-depth. Liked it a lot. Makes you really think
B007HACDLK|5.0|Vince Flynn is top notch.  The books are fun to read and hard to put down action thrillers.  I can tell you from personal experience he captures the attitudes of Federal Bureaucrats perfectly.
0316224588|5.0|Old soldiers may never die and John Rebus hopefully will never fade away.  After a couple of years in retirement he's back as a civilian consultant on cold cases (which seems to be becoming a trend in resurrecting protagonists in crime fiction).  In the course of this work he is informed by the mother of a girl who disappeared many years before that her daughter may have been the first in a series of disappearances ( and presumably murders) along a northern highway (serial murders apparently are becoming de rigeur among retired detectives as well).  And Rebus is off to the wars, albeit with no official standing.<br /><br />Rebus worms his way into an active investigation with the help of his old sidekick, Siobhan Clarke.  And he uses all the old techniques frowned upon by his old nemesis, Malcolm Fox, of the Complaints, including consorting with the likes of gangsters such as Rafferty to gain information.  While a massive police force goes about the investigation by the book, of course Rebus goes it alone.<br /><br />It's good to have Rebus back, and hopefully more is in store because the rules have been changed and he has applied for reinstatement.  All he has to do is pass the physical.  Can he do so, despite all that hard liquor and cigarettes?  And, of course, if successful, Fox is looking forward to Rebus making a colossal mistake on the job to justify his enmity.<br /><br />As with all the previous novels in the series, this one is highly recommended.
B004LP3AYI|5.0|This is the best series that I have every read.  I can't wait to read the rest of it. Loved it.

B0076DELIG|5.0|What can I say.  I am a sucker for Harry Bosch novels.  This one is less analizing of Harry and more story.

Lots of preselected Video providers including You Tube, CNN, Vimeo etc. I particularly like the connectivity with Youtube! In short an impressive App could be the future demise of cable tv boxes...? I recommend it.
B005CRQ4OW|5.0|This was a very interesting tale that many can relate to.  I feel that all will enjoy this book , with a surprise ending you'll never see coming
0374214913|5.0|If you put a MacBook and a copy of Perez-Reverte's The Club Dumas into a blender then poured the resultant frothy, semi-intellectual confection into a mug featuring a Google doodle rendered in Latin, you'd have a pretty good approximation of the flavor of Sloan's Mr. Penumbra's 24-Hour Bookstore. Much as I adored every minute, the novel isn't perfect - see: extraneous plot-threads about a roommate's love life, and the suspicion that this whole thing is some kind of novel-length advertisement commissioned by the boys at Google - but it's so clearly done with love for books, bookstores, and book-lovers that I'm inclined to be forgiving. (Plus any work that name-drops the guy credited for inventing the semi-colon automatically gets mad props from me.) Don't expect this bookstore to have the depth of Borges' Library, but if you're looking for something a little light and utterly delightful this may be the right book exactly, at exactly the right time.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|one of the most entertaining games ive played in a while. Very fun and addicting, definitely worth the 99 cents.
0765325950|5.0|Final chapter... after 21 years I get to finish the series!<br /><br />Good, but not great... still worth it for the dedicated fan (which I am).
B001IF277K|5.0|Ordered near Christmas,  I knew the order wouldn't get here until the new year... I received the package the first week of January sooner than expected!  Thanks.  I will be a repeat customer!
B0063IH60K|5.0|I downloaded on my zeki tablet and have enjoye<br /><br />downloaded this game on my zeki tablet - love it<br /> and would recommend to download best part it Free and its fun
B009VA1FN6|4.0|I really enjoyed this book, it kept me wondering until the last page, Kate Morton is a great story teller and wordsmith, if you enjoy a good mystery this is the book for you
B008FYZIVY|5.0|This is a great story line. I really enjoy this show and have suggested to my family and friends to watch it .
B009IEXKXI|5.0|This book is a great read, and anyone who likes hard SF will enjoy it.  Engaging character, dramatic situations, tense and gripping plot, I couldn't put it down.  Some of the science may not be completely accurate, but who cares, suspend your disbelief for a moment and allow yourself to be swept away on a wild ride on Mars. The text could do with a proof-read/edit,  but nothing bad enough to make me reduce my score.  This is definitely a bargain at the price.  More please Mr Weir!
B008HJGPVO|3.0|I have been using this just to set up my Kindle.  Download books and videos and test out the system.  The tip is already fraying and I haven't read anything yet.  I already ordered what I hope is an upgrade.
B00571F26Y|5.0|What I have learned from this book about the post WWI wheat has revolutionized our eating habits. I have suffered with many of the symptoms described in the research iin this book and by cutting out wheat products I noticed changes for the positive!
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|great game, except I play so long I run my battery dead.  Love it! Extremely addicting! I would recommend for anyone that plays this type of game. love love love love. Got for free, but would pay for it.
B009YP9L7U|2.0|The plot is on the silly side and not much character development either.  Didn't hold my attention so I gave up in the middle..
B0092C2X7U|4.0|my favorite game and is the best i have got on my tablet also is a really good game to go on the road when you are going somewhere and bored.
B00ADYY7MA|5.0|I am a native Nashvillian and have never been a fan of country music until I began watching the TV show Nashville.  Since I can't give a true reason why this Soundtrack is different from other country music, I guess I love it because I know the &#34;background&#34; of their origin of the songs from the TV show. Nevertheless, unique voices, great lyrics and all around upbeat feel makes this Soundtrack worth buying!
B00A8ECU24|4.0|I love my little pony and this game does a fantastic job with relating it with the actual TV show. The only thing is if you want to buy some of the ponies you need to have gems and gems cost money which is a real rip off. The only other way to get gems for free is to have facebook friends that have this game or have a gameloft acount with friends who have the game. I don't  have any friends who have the game so i can't get gems without buying them. So if you get this game and have a gameloft account, add cmwlovelife13 please!
B009RI4FRU|4.0|My son recommended this movie and I am glad I added it to my collection.  Fantastic cast of characters and talented young actors make this movie a must see.  Plus the storyline is fresh and one of a kind.  Definitely worth watching.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|it is like you have your own personal horse stable and your own personal horses and you can even buy rare horses as well.
B000V656X4|4.0|True classic tracks from a band few remember these days. The digital version sounds great and took me back to my younger days

B007RI56NY|5.0|Train legit does not have a bad song, and this album definitely didn't disappoint when I listened to it the first time!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|No house cleaning for me today. Started reading early in the . Morning done and in tears. By noon.  Another great read by Mr. Sparks.  Can't wait for the movie!
B00AE2I4WK|3.0|I love watching the dancing. But the story and the acting Isn't the best. I like the sound track also. :)
B003VANOFY|1.0|It will show up when searching for PS3 headset!  It does not work with the PLAYSTATION works fine for pc, but that is not what I wanted
B004SJ3AXI|1.0|I can't figure out how to do it.  instructions would be helpful to me. really nothing more to say .
0956010903|5.0|THis is,, or was, a must have. Save in unopeed condition for the future. Limited edition. Prices going up overall. We read the standard edition, which was fine.
B0090EHVMC|5.0|Wow. They took this story and upped the social commentary even more than the original. We loved it, but wow. The makers of this movie had a clear message. I highly recommend.

B0055B7IPE|5.0|We watched this movie together for a second time, and it's just so much fun. I love pretty much everything Pixar has ever done, and this is no exception. Watching it streaming worked well, although there were a few low-resolution moments while it reconnected.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|I have beat it 3 times. it is so fun. I think it is the best game for the kindle fire or any other device.
B007HACDLK|2.0|I am a fan of Vince Flynn but this book was weighted down with way too much military speak.  The plot is great but getting through it was tedious.  Sorry, this one was not for me.
B000NJXG6S|5.0|Received in a timely fashion and was what was expected all worked well as hoped for in time for Christmas
B003SPCYP8|5.0|This movie has given me a new aspect on 9/11 that I did not previously have.  I love the lesson his mother taught him &#34;Good people who do good things, and bad people that do bad things.  There is no other difference!&#34;  Absolutely aw inspiring.
0307346617|4.0|I wasn't sure what to expect when I first picked up this books. It reads as a series of accounts from people who are experiencing the uprise of the dead. At times I skimmed. But for the most part it was a read that keep me flipping the pages. All in all a pretty good read for fans of everything zombie related. I'm looking forward to the upcoming movie.
B0097C8XL0|5.0|Very fun game to play with the kids or by yourself. You want to just keep trying to make it to the end but It can be very challenging to get there.
