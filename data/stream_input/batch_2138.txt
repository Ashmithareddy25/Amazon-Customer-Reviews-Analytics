B004HO6I4M|5.0|I love this movie (I didn't think I would the first time I sat down to watch it) and it arrived on time in good shape!
B0015FHDRW|5.0|Awesome album from the artist Foxboro Hottubs which you know them as Green Day.<br />I really recommend to you to hear the songs:<br />\\"Stop Drop and Roll\\" \\"Broadway\\" and \\"Aligator\\".<br />You won't regret on this album.
B0064NTZQ2|5.0|What can I say? This is an extreme movie. If you want action, brutality, romance and sentimentality all in one feature, then this is the film for you. I would recomend it to absolutely anyone.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I loved this book it was amazing nothing could be greater than this right now I'm so glad I had a chance to read it.
B0002J4X1Q|5.0|This is by far my favorite 'horror'/zombie movie, and the first, as with most series movies, is definately the best. I would recomend this movie to anyone who likes fiction and being submerged into a world of badassery.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|Loved this book.... I highly recommend it.well written and fun to read!!! I'm anxious to read more of her books..this is the first. Police reAd on my new kindle
B009UX2YAC|5.0|When I first saw this game I thought it was a joke until I played it on my cousin iPad and I just got a new kindle fire hd so I thought \\"hew why not try this game for myself\\" so I did and I really love it a lot. Thanks you guys for the best game of the 21th century!!!
B0053TMP24|5.0|It's the best book ever!!!! I think it's the best book out of the whole series. Rick Riordan is the best author ever
B0054JZC6E|5.0|it is a fun an additive game for the whole family to try an out do each other. would recommend this game for family fun nihht
B004EPYZZ8|5.0|Loved the plot, loved the way it was executed. Good decent family movie with good moral values. Would recommend it to others.
B008GVD6D8|4.0|I was a little late to the '50 shades' party. However, once I'd arrived I wasn't ready for it to end. Left hot under the collar, panting and weak at the knees I turned to the Crossfire series.<br /><br />In terms of the quality of the writing, it was definitely much better. What I did find though was that the characters were a little underdeveloped comparatively and I think this was the reason I wasn't left reeling in the same way.<br /><br />I really wish the third book would hurry along. It may very well be the hamartia of this series and from what i can see, the release date has been pushed back twice. Please get onto it!
B009ANP4F4|5.0|My daughter loves the Step up movies and this adds to our collection!!<br />THis movie is so awesome and we enjoy it over and over!!<br />Thanks!!
B00AQ3K8IU|3.0|Ever seen the movie 'The Face on the Milk Carton'? This book sent me back to a movie I used to watch as a young teenager. A very similar story line and I felt truly transported back.<br /><br />Overall an easy, readable story but nothing terribly memorable. I enjoyed the imagery of the tattoo but I also feel that is overused in contemporary romance.<br /><br />A little more character depth would have been ideal but in saying that, I would happily read Collen Hoover's work again.<br /><br />Thank you.
B005SFR7YE|5.0|Thank you so much for this Amazing movie!! We loved the original show in person and watching it on DVD is amazing too.<br />Thanks!!
B0066WJLU6|4.0|I think this is a very useful app, just don't be looking at it when you turn it on. I would recommend it to anyone.
B007ME5BUG|4.0|If you are looking for an exhaustive account of every single fact, every single country, every single engagement, and every single detail for WWII from start to finish, look no further for you have found it.  And this is definitely a 5-star read if that is what you seek.<br /><br />Maybe it's not fair for me to give it 4 stars, but I will anyway.  I was primarily interested in WWII as it relates to America and Americans, I found the details about the Soviet involvement, Manchuria, China etc. to be a bit too much, and I skimmed or frankly skipped those parts.  This was a very long book, with my skimming technique I reduced it to about 40% of it's entire length.<br /><br />If you are a WWII dilettante like me, this book will likely be overwhelming for you.  WWII is just too vast in scope to be tackled in such a comprehensive manner imho.  I would recommend sticking instead to focused reads on individual battles... Pearl Harbor, Midway, D-day, etc.  If you are a WWII hard-charger and are looking for a very informative, information packed, textbook-like read then this book is it.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Easy to use. Enjoyable and lots of fun.  Great to play while waiting for an appt.  Very addicting.  My 11yr old enjoys it too.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Perfect for waiting room.! There is some glitching....but overall fun game! Makes the time just fly by but can be very frustrating at times.
B003WUYRGI|3.0|It is a great dictionary and I require it to everyone but it is a bit boring. It is also good for beginners who want to learn more about the English language.
B00A0SKFLG|3.0|This isn't a great movie, but neither was the original. In the original, Paul Verhoeven and Arnold Schwartzenegger tore apart Philip K. Dick's story with nonsense about Martian terraforming. In the remake, Len Wiseman and Colin Farrell do the same thing, except with some nonsense about a tunnel through the Earth. It's bad Mars science with good 'splosions or bad Earth science and good 'splosions. They both do what they do pretty effectively, as long as you don't overthink it.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Okay, yes, creator/writer Julian Fellows has a tendency to wrap up story lines a little too quickly and easily, and, yes, Downton Abbey is in some senses a soap opera ... but soap opera elevated to the nth degree of style, wit, and compelling charaterization.  The acting is uniformly superb, the visuals (sets, costumes) are gorgeous, and once you're hooked, you can only rejoice in this further season of stories from the Abbey.
0345803493|5.0|If you have read book one, you MUST read book two and three. The characters are so life like that you get caught up in their lives.  The book was in pristine condition and looked brand new.
B003PTP4S6|5.0|Although he was writing for film, Ennio Morricone created some of the most beautiful, poignant melodies ever written and Yo-Yo Ma does a beautiful job with these sensitive arrangements.  A perfect marriage of artist and composer.
B00846F1YW|4.0|it's a fun hidden objects game. the dialogue is a little holey but there is an option for turning it off. you do not have to post to facebook or twitter. there is an X to close that box. sometimes to see parts of the picture covered by graphics of the game you will need to zoom in.<br />I don't know that I would pay 2.99 for it, but I do think it's a fun game.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book is more fantastic then I could have ever hoped for. Every penny was well spent as I laughed, cried, and felt. The emotions of the novel play into me. No part seemed to drag on, no love scene seeming cliche. It is an instant classic.
B006SV2LWA|2.0|The promo was better than the movie. I thought the storyline took too long to understand, by the time I figured it out the movie about half over. In my opinion, there's nothing special with this movie.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|This book was amazing to read mentally and aloud. I just loved this book and think that everybody should read the book.
1250027624|5.0|For those who love the Downton Abbey television series this book is a must have.  The pictures are bequtiful and the writing gives a good description and understanding of the characters.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I couldn't put the book down! Can't wait to read the other books. I'm going to start number two in a minute
B00B4Z5GDQ|5.0|Sound City is the first streaming video I've bought from Amazon. I must say they've figured out how to get good quality video and sound &#34;down the pipeline.&#34; I'm a video professional and have good eyes/ears for this sort of thing. I was thrilled with the audio and video quality coming out of my XBox 360.<br /><br />Now...onto the documentary. Absolutely stellar. Beautifully edited, shot, audio was stellar...who knew that a video about a recording studio could be so awesome? But it was. This was not just some recording studio...it was THE place to record at. Thank you Dave Grohl for immortalizing and telling the story of Sound City.<br /><br />The film contains insight from major names in the industry. Paul McCartney, Stevie Nicks, Lars Ulrich and MANY others make appearances. This documentary made me laugh, cry and kept my attention throughout. Absolutely brilliant!
B0027MJU00|5.0|I enjoyed this book because of its many twists and turns. The female main character was a little annoying at first but you find yourself cheering for her in the end.
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|Gameplay could use a update but things in the game are very good. Multiplayer could use some optional chat. The game still gets 5 full stars because it's great without these things.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|Love this game!! It's so addicting!  Plus it's one of my favorite things to do for free!! Makes me smile and laugh!!!
0375869026|5.0|I always read gift books before gifting them.  This is an excellent book, easy to read, with a multitude of emotions evolving.  I recommend it highly.  Thanks.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Fun interactive horse game. Being able to groom, feed, jump, and other interactive features make it more like having a real horse opposed to most of the other computer horse games. Best one so far.
0425064344|4.0|I'm not sure what to make of this book. I know there are a lot of people who love it, and I can see why, but I can't include myself amongst their number. There's just something so cold about this world that it makes it hard to open up to. I'm not referring specifically to its harshness nor am I calling it unemotional. I don't mind either of those things. Perhaps detached or contrived is a better word? It's a hard impression to explain.<br /><br />At any rate this book is about Paul Atreides, who is basically a cross between Orestes, Lawrence of Arabia, and Muhammad. He moves with his family to the planet Arrakis (only source of the spice on which the empire relies) where he is entwined in a trap to destroy his family. Something that Herbert does very well is set up a sense of approaching disaster and doom. You know what's going to go down from the beginning but it still feels tense and sudden when it finally comes. There is a lot of political maneuvering and odd religious beliefs and it isn't particularly easy to see where Herbert comes down on these issues, at least not in this book. He generally treats the religious stuff as if it's phony but then he has mystical events that seem to imply some of it is real.<br /><br />None of the characters are particularly likeable. Leto (Paul's father) probably comes off best but in the end he risked his entire family in a gambit to gain political power. Paul's mother Jessica is fiercely devoted to her family, but she's a Bene Gesserit and manipulates everybody else in addition to putting her son in mortal danger through her ambitions for him. Paul is much the same as his mother in that sense (he's trying to play at being god) and once he becomes the prophed Maud'Dib he becomes even worse and less understandable on a human level. His ability to see the future is one of my least favorite elements of the book since I don't think it was handled in a particularly interesting way.<br /><br />This is an eminently quotable book with such famous lines as \\"the spice must flow\\" and \\"fear is the mind killer.\\" Mot impressively of all these quotes do not seem at all out of place when seen in context. It also features a memorable world complete with endless deserts, Bedouin substitutes, and sandworms. Everyone says that this is the world that Tatooine was based off of and it's hard to disagree. Some other claims for Dune's influence are harder to agree with (Brian Herbert's afterward claims that everything from Spock to the Terminator is based off his father's work) but it has certainly had a major impact on the science fiction  community.<br /><br />So I don't know, maybe I'm missing something but this book just doesn't do it for me. I read it when I was eleven and felt the same thing but I thought I'd give it another chance since I didn't like a lot of things then that I do now (the equally deserty Lawrence of Arabia for a start). But while I definitely appreciated it more now with the benefit of my extra years it still didn't thrill me like it does some people. It's certainly a decent book and I'd recommend that people read it but I don't understand all the excessive devotion. I found other classics like the [[ASIN:184159332X Foundation Trilogy]] and [[ASIN:1400120292 The Robot Series]] to be much more worthy of my time.uch famous lines as \\"the spice must flow\\" and \\"fear is the mind killer.\\" Mot impressively of all these quotes do not seem at all out of place when seen in context.

B00B2EWBMI|3.0|It's an ok movie. It has its funny moments and its action scenes. It takes from the old school kung fu shows and movies but adds a modern twist.
1603429999|3.0|Very odd shaped garments.  Some good advice, for example conversion, but not what I had expected.  I will probably not think to use this book.
B00AWTSRZY|5.0|Great finale to the two part story. I enoyed every minute of it. I would recomened it to every Batman fan
1603427244|4.0|Well illustrated with clear directions and very useful information to help you decide when to use which bind off. Good size to take with you and lies flat.
B00B5HQLMI|5.0|great addition to the james bond family. i loved it and would recommend it to everyone. the characters and the action sequenees are unforgetable
B00932AA5G|5.0|Action and suspenseful from the beginning all the way until the end. After watching the film, I felt satisfied with a smile from ear to ear.
B009E9R1IM|5.0|I own every led zeppelin vinyl made except BBC sessions. (Have it on cd though). And this honestly beat my expectations. The concert recording was amazing. And led zeppelin even in their old age Plus bringing in jason, johns son. Still preformed just as the did back in the peak of their career. One of my favorite albums. Reminds me of the song remains the same concert recording. I'd buy it again and again.
B00AKKTDJY|5.0|Cooking dash is great I tried the free version first but got frustrated at not being able to go any further so I purchased the full version
B009AOFNU4|1.0|Never could get it to work even with their tech support.Could not get it to synch up to my computer.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Interesting format, you go through each trial with the main character and can relate to him. Loved it! Definitely worth buying and reading.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is awesome. I love to have the competition with my friends from the connection from Facebook. I would recommend this game to every one I know!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This story turned out to be better than any Nicholas Sparks story I have ever read. I couldn't put it down!
B002Q63JEU|4.0|It's not perfect, but it's better than both of their last 2 albums. Plus, I think I only paid $3.99 or $4.99 when it first came out, which is GREAT for a new album.<br /><br />My favorites:<br />&#34;Careful&#34;<br />&#34;Brick by Boring Brick&#34;<br />&#34;Ignorance&#34;<br />&#34;All I Wanted&#34;<br />&#34;The Only Exception&#34;<br /><br />3 years later, I'm still listening to half the songs on this album fairly regularly. Can't wait for the new album in April 2013!
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|The previous cable hasn't worked too well for a long time, so this is a major improvement. Makes a good connection and charges the Kindle much faster.
B009LT1YZ6|5.0|I have never enjoyed motioned controlled games because they always seems inaccurate. This is not the case it goes exactly where I want it to.. Amazingly good motion control.
B0066WJLU6|5.0|espectacular, la linterna es exelente, con ella se pueden resolver muchas emegencias y resolver inumerables problemas de vision nocturna  muy buena
B009G7ZYPY|5.0|Susan Boyle always gets a standing ovation from me. She has the voice of an angel. I could listen to her all day. I am hoping for the day she records a cd of blues songs from the 30s and 40s. I praise the day she had the nerve to put herself on that stage.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Delightfully smutty read. Enjoyable but a bit predictable. Recommended read for all women who enjoy life and love. Must read for men.
B004P2HMNM|5.0|I greatly like how every floor comes apart and you can see into each unit.<br />Easy to build and fun to play with.
B000S1L7IU|4.0|Great twists and turns.  Loved the uonexpected find of the little lost animals.  Good blending of the multiple characters and plots
B00846F1YW|4.0|Really I'm enjoying this game its fun playing.Clear graphics good simple story. I like to play games to be entertained and destress. Again I really like the ease of use and its fun and easy.
B001ED7C58|5.0|Very good CD and many of the background tunes in this one.  It's a nice way to relive the Twilight movie.
B007VDPMYI|5.0|Poor George is one of the most criminally underrated guitarist, probably of all time. The guy's intonation is second to none, and was as good a slide player as anyone. As good a player as he was, he was equally a great songwriter. It's like I tell everybody when discussing great players (and this goes for Ringo too), there's a reason he was in the greatest band of all time.
B000002LAC|5.0|I just simply love their voices together. I am really happy I bought this album and just get lost in the old time coutry tunes.
B0018QQQK8|5.0|It was such a great book!! I loved it:)) I love how simple their love was and how natural it was.
0679735909|5.0|I gave this as a gift to a friend and she loved it! I am sorry I can't say too much more about it I haven't read it
B008JF2KC4|5.0|This was a great buy. Nice addition to the rest of the lego set. This is a great toy .
B00127RAJY|5.0|I don't like the beginning with all the talking, but don't let the time fool you. She kicks your ass!,
B00992CF6W|5.0|they need to add all the mobs and objects like endermen and red stone stuff. this is by far one of the best apps on kindle fire!
B005LAJ1O0|5.0|The DVD set  arrived on time and made a great Christmas gift.  Would recommend it to anyone who likes this
B001R0KH3W|5.0|Awesome Stevie wonders voice and talent unmatched by any other male vocals and still going strong we are blessed to have his genius
B009G3T01M|5.0|I love this album! Macklemore is outrageously talented and raps about TRUE things instead of cars, women, and money. I haven't stopped listening to this album since I bought it with my MP3 credit. I'll be buying more in the future!
B009JBZH54|1.0|This was a Christmas gift for my Godfather.  The disc1 did not play.  We sent it back for a 2nd set...the same problem..disc 1 did not play...finally Amazon gave refund for purchase.
B003Y74KCK|5.0|Excellent case. It came very white (instead of dingy white) and it fits my iPhone 4S perfectly. If I were getting another case soon I would buy the same one in a different color.
0875428940|5.0|This is a great deck to read with because the images always give you something to focus on. It's traditional, pagan and mysterious. I find it still enjoyable to work with after one year, it is not wearing or vexing. It is my favorite deck of the four I have. Other people seem to enjoy the cards' artwork when I read for them.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Our 4 year old daughter loves playing this and so do we! Very fun and free, can't go wrong :)
B007SGM084|5.0|An extremely romantic, wildly erotic story where two unlikely,complicated characters journey to their \\"Happily ever after.\\" I don't think the movie will do it justice.
B009RH973I|4.0|It's great cover, lowest price of avaulable and really protects my kindle while looking very cute (I bought the pink one). The reason I didn't gave a 5 Star is because doesn't come prepare to place it while vertically... you can do it, and the band support it, but is forced.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|It took me three days to read this book. I couldn't put it down!! Love Nicholas sparks!! Highly recommend!!!Can't wait to go see the movie now.
B00992CF6W|4.0|I love this game but it needs nametags and I would love it even more if this was added thankyou
B00A8ECU24|5.0|Awesome! this game is super fun. I just wish you could earn gems more easily. It is too expensive to buy them.
B005LAII8K|3.0|In my youth I read a lot of science fiction:  Clarke, Heinlein, Asimov, et. al.  But I never enjoyed time travel as a plot device because of the old paradox problem:  I go back in a time machine to the time before my parents met and kill my father.  Therefore, I could not have existed in the future to go back in time to begin with.  Or better yet I go a back in time and kill Albert Einstein when he is a child.  As a result the entire history of the world instantly changes.  Balderdash.  On the other hand, going forward in time is at least a reasonable concept.  But I couldn't meet myself as an old man in that future time, because I had departed from my original time stream to travel into the future.  There couldn't be two of me existing at the same time.  My God, one is plenty.  \\"Looper\\" is just that sort of story and I keep saying, \\"Wait a minute, that just doesn't add up!\\"<br /><br />There once was a fellow named Brite,<br />Whose speed surpassed that of light.<br />He departed one day,<br />And in a relative way<br />Returned on the previous night.<br /><br />Having got that off my chest I can say \\"Looper\\" is a well made and acted film.  I always enjoy watching Joseph Gordon-Levitt who brings an intensity to his roles.  He was particularly fine in \\"The Lookout,\\"  \\"Mysterious Skin\\" and \\"Brick\\"  I even enjoyed his small role in \\"The Black Knight Rises\\" especially when we find out who he really is.  What's in store for him with that franchise?  Oh, yes -- \\"Premium Rush\\" was fun, too.
B007MDB548|5.0|The Secret of the Wings stays on-par with the rest of the series--adorable and cute.  My sons and daughter all love this movie, especially the bonus shorts.  Even my husband and I enjoy watching with the kids. The characters and plots are very entertaining, funny, and sweet.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|i love this game its so fun and adventuress i personally love this kindle app the best and i have alot of apps
B001ANSSDC|5.0|This book teaches you to ju<br />st be grateful for everything and everyone in your life while you still have the chance.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Fun for all must try it can't put it down. Must try this game went be disappointed. Like all the items you can collect.
B001P06GX4|5.0|Blockus is a fun game for the entire family. An extremely addictive game even for a difficult to please board gamer.
B004GYY714|4.0|I got a good selection of music that I listen to. comes in well. easy set up and good sound.
B008XG1X18|5.0|great app and super easy to use. Makes exploring pinterest on kindle enjoyable and fun. the price is right as well ;)
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I am not a big game player but I and my boys enjoy this.  Its a easy game for me to learn
0767810856|5.0|I love this movie so I bought it and watched it again.  It is in perfect condition with no flaws.
B004RJMUJO|4.0|Helps me to get used to the touch screen.  Excellent graphics.  Disappointed there is no 2 player version unless I go online but still an enjoyable game.
B0050DZN4K|5.0|Great app. Absolutely love it and have had zero problems so far. Ive used for about @2 weeks. Try this ap and you wont be sorry. I love being able to put in all my feeds and the touch and swipe screens are really awesome.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|you should monitor whether or not someone used one of the free coins options other than that I love this game/app.
B000JMKNV0|1.0|The story kept me for a while, then my mind would wander and I would lose track of the story line.
B001XCWPAM|1.0|These are great movies, but the Bourne Identity disc freezes in my Sony player.  The other two discs play fine.
140123769X|3.0|I am a diehard fable fan but the cubs have never been my favorite. For one thing they look like they're ten but still talk like toddlers;for another they don't have much, if any, character development as individuals.  There were still good moments and interesting ideas presented in this book but. it really feels like this series needs to wrap up before it completely loses steam
B009T3AE1Y|3.0|too hard to follow.  I love Pattinson, so I can't understand why he did such an  awful movie  3 stars for Rob
B0063M22QO|5.0|Easy, no problems downloading and playing right from the start.  Enough challenges to keep me happy for a good while.  Try it &amp; enjoy.
B007SGM084|5.0|have to admit, was a very good read.  cute love story if you can get past all the adult activity
B0007MWZEK|4.0|This is a good product for making quick clean-ups.  I happen to have two cats who use a cardboard scratching box and this creates bits of cardboard which end up all over the floor.  The Swivel Sweeper is great for cleaning these up in a hurry.
B005CRQ3NY|5.0|I love this book it's so funny and totally awesome!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Definitely read it I love it I had fun reading it
B0099114WO|4.0|Probably best enjoyed by people of &#34;a certain age&#34;  which I am.  Just a lovely story about a wife who is trying to &#34;invigorate&#34; her marriage..  Meryl Streep and Tommy Lee Jones play their parts beautifully.  Steve Carell is great as the marriage counselor.<br />It's a lovely story with humor, no bad words and no car-chase scenes.
B00000637V|5.0|Probably Lou's best. I love them all, but this one is very special. It's not for everyone but it's a totally inspiring work.
B009POCG2C|4.0|Clint Eastwood plays his usual curmudgeon role, but he's so good at it!  Amy Adams is perfect in the role of his daughter.  Just a very nice story to sit back and enjoy.
B008X9Z3UC|5.0|I highly recommend this product.  I chose this case over other styles and makes because I wanted two accomplish two things. First I wanted to protect my Kindle from scratches and other damage. Second, I wanted somewhere to store my stylus and earphones. It's a tight fit storing my Kindle with these two items, but it works.  If I had not bought this case, I know I would constantly be looking for my stylus and earphones just as I do my reading glasses.
0345803493|5.0|Interesting book<br />I the story keeps you excited to turn the pages to see what happens next.<br />I am ready for the next book!
B004X4R3FE|5.0|At times you really feel for the man that would become King George VI. He had a tough time just speaking in public. The story was great. The best scene is were &#34;Berty&#34; cusses and swears in a wild torrent. Really funny.<br /><br />I was amazed the Geoffrey Rush as Lionel Logue in this movie was the same man playing Barbossa in the Pirates of the Caribbean movies. Nice range of acting.<br /><br />By the end of this movie, you see a real bond between Lionel Logue and King George VI. It was wonderful to watch it play out.
B0052U59F4|4.0|Steamy is all I can say. Great first read for this style of book. Definately a fantasy, but still entertaining.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Great book, great story. Saw the movie first but the book is so much better!  Can't wait to read book #2!
B005N0PJJO|3.0|A little less exciting as the first. This book was more the adventure part of the story - more drama/action and less sexual.
0316227706|5.0|I got this book for my parents for Christmas, since we had a labrador who used to swim laps and retrieve toys from the bottom of our backyard pool every summer.  It was a hit on Christmas morning, and my dad even took it along with us when we visited other relatives so he could share it.  It's a great gift for any dog lover, especially people who are partial to labs.
B007IXWL2C|2.0|After the rest, I thought it lacked the steam from the first and second.  It became the &#34;love&#34; story, not what I was looking for.
B00913P6G0|5.0|I loved this CD! I have been a Kendrick Lamar fan for the last two years, and have majority of his mixtapes. So, it was only natural to buy and support his album! The whole album was excellent and not a song was skipped! One of the Renaissance men of our time ;)
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Read this book!  Somewhere in the middle I wanted it all to be possible.<br />What if...<br />Loved this book.<br />Thanks.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I like how this game looks 3D!  I also like how we can earn gems.  I would buy this on whatever costs
B0067Q42BY|4.0|Have played a number of these over the years (probably since the late 1980's). This is probably the best one I've seen so far.
0062082353|5.0|I ordered this book after the murder of Chris Kyle. I love this book and cannot wait to get his other book. The only thing that I did not like was how long it took to ship.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I thought this series is far better than 50 Shades of Grey, and I loved that series! The story line to these books is so much deeper and more intense!! I highly recommend!!!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Love it. Never thought I would like a series about Zombies but the relationships and the cast won me over!
B0034G4OYA|5.0|Super Funny!!  I really enjoyed the movie and would recommend purchasing the DVD to anyone regardless  of their age or education.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Read it in one night. Fabulous read. Intriguing and suspenseful until the last page. Can't wait to see the movie.
B007BFSYMS|4.0|Love it but not enjoying being forced to rate it this morning. It is very convenient and I love the brown noise. I tried to rate it later but it forced me to review it in order to turn it off.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|I was hooked from the very start.  Beautiful concept; beautiful implementation.  The characters are memorable, and their struggles draw you in.  I Highly recommend this book!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This is a great book. I never wanted to put it down. I am looking forward to reading the next book.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This is another good app for a child's Kindle.  I allowed a second-grader to play this on my Kindle Fire, and he had a good time.  The tough part is connecting all the dots and using the whole grid WITHOUT crossing the pipes.
B007B6VOG0|5.0|There are very few albums that I can listen to from start to finish without skipping any songs. This is one of those rare gems. Every song offers something different and great.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|The idea is very simple--it's a 3-D mahjong game with a timer.  If you've played mahjong, you can easily play this. I've only played one mode, but it's quite addicting.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|I love this game. It has amazing graphics and everything. But I don't really get some stuff. Other than that I do like it a lot.
B0088P2A7A|5.0|Wikipedia is a useful app for information.  However, if you're using this for school, remember that anyone and everyone can enter or edit information.  Check the source information as backup.
B0013TXA5Y|4.0|I put off reading the Mortal Instruments books for a while because honestly I wasn't sure what to expect. Finally, after reading and hearing loads of great reviews on the series I decided to give it a try. The beginning of the book is great and really brings you into the world of shadows, but the middle becomes slow and halfway through I was able to guess one of the main shockers of this particular book. The book failed to grab me and lure me in the way a great book should, but it was a good story and something I hadn't seen done before. My main problem with this book is Clary's lack of character growth in the shadow hunter realm. She seems to be thrown into fights at every turn, but never really tries to learn any new skills. Perhaps this will improve with the rest of the series.
B005HSL626|5.0|One of my friends downloaded this for his iPad.  His young son introduced me to the game.  We both like this game (watch out for the bombs!).
B000FBJF7I|5.0|I loved the entire series about Precious Ramotswe and could hardly put the books down. The characters are charming and amusing.
B0046ECFRM|5.0|I enjoyed this book immensely.  I spend my days with teens, so it's easy for me to pop into this world.  That said, Anna and the French Kiss is realistic and accurate in capturing the rush and the pain of first love.  Long past that initial stage now (having been happily married for many years) I was transported to those early days of agony (what is he thinking?  Is he thinking of me?  I love think I love my best friend...oh my god.) and the overwhelming urge to spend every waking moment with someone.  I will read this again and again...and have happily recommended it to several friends and students.
B0087JTAKW|5.0|I have jus started this book and I can't review it yet.  When I finish I will send a review if I am able to.  I have read every thing else he ever wrote and I am sure this will not disappoint.
1602830452|5.0|Although these contents can be downloaded in the form of mp3 files, I still recommend other customs to buy this boxet of CDs. Because the audio quality is really excellent.  Nothing can be compared to the feeling when listening to Conan Doyle's brilliant works.
B0084BMUFA|5.0|My husband purchased this for his Kindle.  We love this story and try to see it in the theatre every year at the holidays.
B009JBZH54|5.0|This is a great box set  for the price. I purchased it for $30. It comes with a  the little book. If all you want are the movies on Blu-ray then this the box set you're looking for.
B009XTF8JM|4.0|Story line was somewhat believable.  An Semite demon added a unique and intriguing element, a break away from the usual Catholic garb.  Great special effects, yet not overdone.  An appropriate ending.
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|This is by far the best game on the Amazon store. It has at least a week of gameplay and is super addicting, I recommend it to anyone.
B002HK9I04|5.0|Arrived quickly in perfect sealed condition. What can you say about this movie, it's a laugh a minute and the musical numbers are hilarious. Gotta have it for the collection.
B0057VDGNK|5.0|The first 3 songs are by far some of my favorite songs ever.  It's awesome driving music - whether you're driving in real life or driving in a video-game.  This soundtrack is awesome in every.  If you are a fan of the movie, this soundtrack is a perfect complement.
B005K01VZS|5.0|I generally don't read fiction, but Mitch Albom has a winner here. I was touched by the story line and have enjoyed reading it and sharing it with others. I must admit, this is not the first Albom book I've bought so I was a fan before I saw it on Amazon. I also enjoyed reading &#34;The Timekeeper&#34; which was released just before Xmas, too.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Very good book, from the first chapter it had you hooked!!! Would recommend if you like both a thriller and romance.
B001F0WXY0|5.0|I would recommend this book to anyone. Even if you dot like science fiction you will love this book. Amazing
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This is a fun, addicting game. Good graphics, and the sounds aren't annoying. I play it on the kindle fire hd, and it works great.
B000DWMYQ8|5.0|Got this for my kid.  Nice HD illustrations, good story and a lot of laughs.  The center of this disc has a slight chip, but it plays fine so no worries.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Maybe a high school person would like to read this trash.  It's all about dominance.  It's stupid and there's no point.
B005K2YTG4|5.0|Not too much. Just right for carrying my Kindle. Looks sharp and not bulky at all.  Love it, its perfect.
B00BB8RKH6|1.0|The movie is titled \\"Flight\\" but has very little to do with flying an airplane.  I was disappointed that the film glorified alcohol and drug abuse and showed very few consequences for this behavior.  I had respect for Mr. Washington as an actor, but he failed to take advantage of the opportunity to make a statement about the true pain of addiction in this film.
B000EHSVQ4|5.0|This film could have been a contender.  From the director of &#34;Gladiator&#34;, it was an amazing depiction of the Crusades and the Middle Ages.  Orlando Bloom, Liam Neeson, and Jeremy Irons are excellent.  Eva Green is haunting.  Marton Csokas and Brendan Gleeson are wonderful villains.  Highlights include any scene with Edward Norton as King Baldwin or Ghassan Massoud as Saladdin and the climactic siege of Jersualem.
B009FZHYKU|3.0|They are really dragging this season out, frankly I'm getting sick of all the boring stuff, and the episodes that nothing happens at all that is relevant are just dumb.  I don't plan on finishing the show.
B0097C8XL0|4.0|I really like this game it is great except that even if you can save yourself u still die and the edges r 2low but I love it
B003CR9BYE|5.0|WAITED FOR THIS CD FOR A LONG TIME AFTER THE 8 TRACK TAPE WAS WITHDRAWN  CONSTANTLY PLAYED IN MY HOUSE MU WIFE LOVES IT
B002M9WW30|5.0|So, I love the movies already and I'm old enough to have seen Rocky III the day it opened in the theater in Philly.  But I like the packaging of the discs and it's certainly nice to have all of them in one place.
B005P5TQPU|5.0|We discovered this series on Netflix. They had up to the sixth season available and it was going to be several months before the the seventh was going to be available. These actors make the characters likable even when their actions are questionable. I think it also helps that they have become as close to brothers in real life.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Flow free is a really fun game if you have nothing to do it is a fun game to play!!!
B008XG1X18|5.0|Pintrest is amazing. The collection of images is endless, the image quality is phenomenal and you can always find the inspiration you're looking for.
034580404X|3.0|Sometimes entertaining, sometimes erotic, sometimes didactic,sometimes elemental, repetitive and boring, but overall I am going to finish reading them which means it has something to it. But for mature audiences (I blush)
B009LROCJI|5.0|From a young age, I fell I love with Vivaldi's Four Seasons.  I never thought that it would be possible to enjoy it again in any other way.  I was wrong, and I simply love this new album with a modern twist that remains very respective to the original score.
B000002KDO|5.0|This is the best black sabbath album there ever was. anyone who doesn't agree can go back to their boy band collection.
B004AQR24W|1.0|It seems as though the writer(s) didn't really care about plot or dialogue.  They just slapped some one-liners together and made a lot of explosions.  Even the fight scenes were hard to get through.  It was just choppy cut after choppy cut of random punches and kicks.  I guess they blew the budget on hiring as many action stars as they could and forgot to actually make a movie.  I'm just glad it was free.  I would have been upset if I had paid to see this garbage.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Addicting fun. Many levels and games available for a free addition. My wife and I challenge each other like a couple of 10 year olds. Makes airplane travel fly by.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|What a great game it's not that addictive so you can pull yourself away but addictive enough so you play it well
B005GFPZYK|5.0|A defining saga in the war against terror. Men like Chris Kyle should be revered and not forgotten. A gripping story of life as a Navy Seal.
B003TSEEDY|3.0|It was a very good book and I enjoyed it very much. All through out the book I felt each and every emotion Charlie did.
B009XY97VC|5.0|Compared to the other TSFH albums Invincible, Archangel and Illusions, Skyworld is my favorite. Even though not all the tracks on Skyworld really worked for me (none of the TSFH albums had EVERY track work for me), the ones that did work were AMAZING!!! My favorites are: Blizzard, Skyworld, Black Heart, Big Sky, For the Win. Other ones I'd recommend: All is Hell that Ends Well (starts orchestral and then turns into where-on-earth-did-this-come-from ????), WinterSpell, El Dorado. Note that across all their albums, TSFH has a wide variety of pieces: some are angelic, some are inspiring/uplifting, some are crushingly dark and heavy. What I like about TSFH's music compared to other trailer music albums I've experienced is its delicious complexity -- so many different layers of music all placed into one single piece. My brain always gets tired after listening, not exactly a bad thing.
B002M5E2DW|3.0|Good perspective on taking control of your life through thought and feeling.  A good read for anyone looking to improve their outlook on life.
B000URWYTS|5.0|I couldn't wait to find time to curl up in front of the fire and read this engaging historical love story.

B009JBZH54|5.0|I've always loved Batman and this blue ray allows an in depth experience into some of the best batman movies of all time. Even for batman snobs these are without flaw
0596007124|5.0|I am an experienced .NET developer and though I was using some of the patterns over the years, I heard of this book from some of the microsoft online seminars and decided to take a look and was very pleasantly surprised.<br />This book walked me, like a seasoned story teller, through scenarios and would stop at logical points, forcing me to think about possible solutions and then would proceed to magically present a design pattern offering the perfect solution.<br />The Strategy pattern and the Pattern of Patterns chapters are a cut above the rest.<br />I then, read through a few other design pattern books, like C# design patterns, ASP.NET design patterns, GOF etc, but then I kept coming back to this book for clarity whenever I get confused. Very highly recommended.<br />And a note for C# or .NET developers:- don't worry that the examples in here are java based; it didn't make a difference to me at all.
B005TPCQ5I|1.0|Are you looking for a beautiful love story with two imperfect people who end up happily ever after? This is not quite that. Think more of a romantic tragedy, on par with Shakespeare.
0674048849|3.0|The annotations, that is, not Emma. Although I confess the first time I tried to read Emma, I didn't get beyond the first few chapters because I thought she was indeed gorgeous but shallow. Happily, I gave it another go and Emma the novel is now my second-favorite Jane Austen and Emma the character is among my favorite literary characters ever.<br /><br />I really wanted to love this edition. I am a huge fan of Jane Austen. I own no fewer than five editions of Pride and Prejudice, at least a couple editions of most of her other works, including the juvenilia and unfinished latter novels, several biographies and miscellanea about Austen and her writing, and at least one movie version of each.<br /><br />And this book is truly beautiful. It looks elegant and old-fashioned. The pages are heavy and rich to the touch and eyes. There are plenty of illustrations and full-color photographs--it's clear the publisher did not stint, and in that sense, this book is a bargain for the price.<br /><br />But alas, like many beautiful things, it is shallow. The annotations themselves do not live up to the book's beauty. At times they are sparse and spare--several pages go by with no annotations at all, or just one or two very brief definitions. At times, they are dense, difficult, and only tangentially related to the text (see e.g. page 409, which leads to a four-column footnote on the use of landscape in literature that only barely mentions Austen). At times, the style of the footnotes is difficult to read, mainly with the longer, denser footnotes--they often spill over a page or two, and the text of the footnote may or may not be located on the page where the number appears in the book. This makes for a lot of flipping back and forth and losing my place. If this was anything other than a Jane Austen book, I'd give it two stars for the annotations alone, but I just can't bring myself to do that.<br /><br />I also own the other annotations by this publisher and they have many of thesame flaws, but Emma is the worst offender. I'll buy the editions for the remaining books from this publisher if and when they come out, because I'm a sucker that way and these really are gorgeous books, especially for the price. But the annotations by David Shapard are more useful and user-friendly.
1402581386|4.0|Looking to get into the head of a smart, unique but slightly kinked popular man not quite sure why people do what they do? This is a freaking awesome book, far better than the series and just as humorous with twists and flow.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|A very good narration of one of the main players in the computer history. He changed the experience of users, giving us the opportunity to enjoy the technology as well as the beauty of his designs.<br />I really enjoyed it!!!
B008LC8TJI|5.0|Terrific, fast paced, and right on the ball. There are several songs that are hilarious and others with actual depth and harmony. Fantastic work, great job y'all
B0029XIWCY|5.0|Great sound quality with a library covering her best decade.  Album art and liner notes are excellent.  But no Strange Fruit -- you have to get that elsewhere because she didn't record it on Columbia.  Luckily the essays and liner notes don't limit themselves to Columbia, so they are excellent and opinionated, especially in panning the lousy movie coverage of her life.  Kinda pricey like most box sets, but satisfying in that you can put it on and just let it ramble from one great song to another and discover new gems.

B00AKKS278|1.0|I bought this for my Kindle at the airport to burn off some time. Long story short: I found it an easy read and a relatively cheap one at that - so it served its purpose in that regard.<br /><br />As for the actual content, that is a different matter altogether. Although Hal's `strategy' for life transformation is quite easy to implement, at the end of the day his technique subscribes to the same fundamental principles you would see in many other self-help materials out there: tenacity and a degree of self-discipline. The difference here is that `Yo Pal' Hal is asking you to get up at 5 a.m. each morning to work on these aspects via unrelated activities, broken into bits that cumulatively take an hour to complete, along with giving yourself a healthy dose of self-affirmation.<br /><br />This is not to say it won't work for you, just that it is not going to work for everyone. Again, the `program' consists of you getting up an hour each day and performing an unrelated series of exercises each and every day, as well as Hal's foolproof plan to motivate you to get up out bed in the first place to implement said program. In the process, you are gaining self-discipline and the tenacity required to achieve those great dreams of yours, by the fact that you are committing yourself to get up each and every morning.<br /><br />The fact that you have done so and accomplished these accompanying tasks brings on that sense of accomplishment, as you lay out the groundwork for greater things. After all, who doesn't want to start their regular day without some sense of accomplishment?<br /><br />Aside from this novel approach, the book is pretty formulaic and, as a consequence, predictable. You get the \\"I had it all and lost it all\\" heartfelt story of Hal, injured in a horrific accident, and how he was able to rise from the ashes. Then you are privy to how Hal came about his revelation, intermingled with feel-good anecdotes, affirming the validity of this program. Finally, the programitself, with all the trimmings.<br /><br />The book sets you up for `greater things', but not in the manner you are thinking. Remember as you read on, that this guy was [and still is!] a salesman, and few things more off-putting than him plugging the terms `Miracle MorningTM' into every other sentence. Notice the `TM' at the end, as if it will become the next hot terms in the arena of self-help books. It is everywhere - you can see that this book is only the tip of the iceberg of a comprehensive program meant to better your life!<br /><br />It got so offensive to me, I almost am tempted to trademark the word 'MiracleMorningTM', so I can lay claim to trademark infringement.<br /><br />Towards the end of the book, Hal gives you links to a few `freebies', which I must say, you could do worse. They are essentially supplemental material to the program. But, once you give out the email address of yours, you can be certain you will be getting hit for more money.<br /><br />Wouldn't you know it, but 2 weeks later I get hit in an email to sign up for this exclusive Hal program for 97.00/month, complete with an autographed copy of the journal he also shills on Amazon. Now who didn't see THAT coming?!?<br /><br />Bottom line, I don't begrudge the man trying to make an extra buck here and there. After all, it is the American way. And under the right circumstances, the book may serve its purpose.  I just take umbrage with the calculating manner this `program' is presented. Aside from fellow reviewer here on Amazon who also wasn't beguiled by this material, do you mean to tell me 70+ reviewers found this to be the Holy Grail of self-help material? Seventy?!?<br /><br />Something stinks here.<br /><br />Do what I do. Write a list every day of the things you want to accomplish, just DO IT. I have been doing this for years and it has served me well. The end of the day, I look at what I accomplished and naturally feel good, and achieved pretty much all my dreams in the process.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I loved this book for many reasons. First, being a hopeless romantic I could appreciate Pat 's desire for a happy ending with his wife. Second, this book gave us a look into the mind of a man that most people would consider \\"crazy\\" and shows us that situations in life can easily drive anybody over the \\"sanity\\" edge. Lastly, I felt that this writer was able to write a story in which we not only understand the way the main character sees the world, but can understand what everyone else in his life is feeling as well. I really enjoyed this book.
B00B4VI8MQ|5.0|I can't wait to see what happens when I get to finish this game. I really like it so far. Thanks for sharing these fun and adventurous games G5!
B000MTDRKE|5.0|As a Christian I found this is a great album. This is my first Neal Morse album and I listen to it every time I drive. It's a mixture of heavy rock, funk, Spanish and easy listening, I guess that's why it's called Progressive Rock. I find a lot of Christian music boring in it's sameness and lack of musical adventure. This album is none of that! It is a bit harder work listening to as the riffs and style change quite suddenly and often. But it's worth the effort. I play both drums and guitar, but nothing like these guys. They are amazing at their respective crafts and tight as. If I had to take one album to a desert island, this would be at the top of my list. The lyrics, whilst sparse, are encouraging in telling Martin Luther's stand against the church of his day.
B00A0SQBDM|4.0|I'm excited about playing this game. So far, this game has great graphics and story line. Hopefully this will be as much fun as other G5 games.
B007THA4FI|4.0|Although it is taking me a longer than usual time to read the book, I am enjoying it.  It is the first book I've read by Rowling and I am liking this particular style.  I find the characters interesting and diverse and enjoy a bit of suspense as to what will happen  next.
B00B4VI8MQ|5.0|This is the best game I have played for a while. T he hidden object part is wonderful. please G5 more like this!

B008K7RGA2|5.0|I have 20 dvd's of Puccini's Tosca- most official releases and a few bootlegs (telecasts never released on video).  They range from the 1950's to this latest release from 2011.  And THIS one is the best of them all.  The combination of all-star cast, terrific traditional staging and sets, and superb sound and video make this a must have for any opera fan.  This is the one to get and watch again and again.<br /><br />Let me start with the cast:<br />Angela Gheorghiu- I see from comments on this and other websites that she is a controversial soprano.  You either love her or you hate her.  Put me in the big fan category.  I've loved her from her major debut in Covent Garden's \\"Traviata\\" (still the one to get).  I am a huge fan of her voice.  It has a hooded tone that to me is very appealing. (Although I can't exactly describe it, I'd call it the exact opposite of shrill.)  She soars and emotes, an all with perfect pitch.  She's still very beautiful (important in this role).  And, as she says in brief interview comments, she IS Tosca.  True, true.  She is a real diva (with all its positive and negative ramifications), and this role is the essential Gheorghiu.  She inhabits it totally.  So, her performance is totally committed and extremely effective.<br /><br />Bryn Terfel- He is my favorite opera performer, and Scarpia is just perfect for him as well.  He has perfected the blend of evil, lust, power, terror and fatalism into a terrifying performance.  He is totally convincing- both as a singer and an actor.  He perfectly enacts each line of text with the right physical gesture.  (Kudos, of course, to stage director Jonathan Kent here as well.)  I've seen comments on this performance which point out that he is unshaven and a little slovenly in dress/hair.  True- and it works very well as his Rome, like him, is in disarray (and falls by the end of the opera).  Masterful.<br /><br />Jonas Kaufmann- he is the more recent sensation, being busy conquering the opera world in the last few years.  His spirito tenor voice is perfect here- and he always looks like the romantic hero. (He has the most perfect hair in all opera.)  I thought him particularly effective in his Act one duets with Tosca.<br /><br />Antonio Pappano- Despite owning hundreds of opera dvd's and CD's, and attending more than 20 opera performances a year, I still find myself unable to appropriately assess/analyze a conductor's work.  It's just too subtle for me to pick out (other them tempo- which is only a small part of his work).  All I can say, which I do here, is that the opera flows perfectly, and he puts the musical emphasis to the physical action in just the right way.  I think he's terrific- but, again, I don't really feel qualified to evaluate it.<br /><br />The traditional sets are huge and terrific. Costumes, too.  This is the best looking Tosca, I've seen.  Also, the filming and sound are superb- get the Blu Ray if you can!!  There is an 8 minute look at the opera by Pappano that is good, but WAY too short.  I would have liked quite a bit more, including more rehearsal footage.<br /><br />Tosca is, of course, one of the most frequently performed opera in the repertoire- a real war horse in every sense of the word.  It is over played and over melo-dramatic.  But when done right, it is a terrific piece of musical theater.  This performance, perfectly captured on the blu ray disc, is excellent and should be in every fan's collection,.  And, it is just the latest in a series of recent releases from Covent Garden that, to my mind, have them on top of the opera world. (See- [[ASIN:B001BWQVW2 Bizet: Carmen]]; [[ASIN:B007CYKHIW Massenet: Cendrillon]], [[ASIN:B0041UG68A Tchaikovsky: Cherevichki - The Tsarina's Slippers [Blu-ray]]] Yes, better than the Met, Paris, la Scala, Zurich, Madrid and Barcelona (in terms of dvd releases).

B009YP9L7U|3.0|This was an ok book it moves to fast in some places and to slow in others. This was a good book all in all though.
B00017LSK8|5.0|For the handful of people who still use analog instant photo equipment, the original Polaroid peel-apart black and white films were the standard for sharpness and consistency. Since the demise of Polaroid as we all grew to know it over the 60 years that they pioneered this medium, Fuji has produced instant materials that match or surpass the performance of these original films and at a very fair price, given the demand. I would absolutely recommend this product to anyone who still loves the &#34;old magic&#34; of an analog instant print and shoots peel-apart medium format instant cameras.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Wonderful book, a delight to read. The author conveyed the raw emotion of how it is to have to trust what your heart feels.
0525953728|5.0|I started this book and didn't stop until the end. It was a nice, easy read. The book felt like a conversation with 'the teams'. I would recommend this book to anyone interested in finding out about the military life and sacrifices made for our country. Thanks for your service, veterans.
0765325950|5.0|I liked the battles, the strategy, the settings but what really satisfied me was the ending which I will not reveal in order not to spoil  it for anyone else.<br /><br />I also appreciated the way the continuing characters were woven into the plot so that everyone had their part to play. I hope that Mat and Tuon have a happy marriage but I think rather than happy it will be &#34;interesting&#34;.<br /><br />I think all of the long suffering fans who waited for this final volume will be satisfied.

B005FISBTO|1.0|One star -- not for content, but for the irritating, unkippable preview that so many others have mentioned. Far from making me wish to purchase additional Showtime entertainment, said preview instead makes me wish to give up buying Showtime DVDs altogether. Is this the plan? Drive purchasers online? It reminds one of the telemarketers who have destroyed their own business model by ensuring that no one answers the phone anymore.
0439023513|3.0|There are lots of reviews that go into far more detail on the internet about why the Mockingjay fell short of expectations, so I'll just list my personal gripes with it. Warning: spoilers.<br /><br />I think most of the people who read Mockingjay understand what Collins tried to do in this book, and I say tried. I loved 'The Hunger Games' and 'Catching Fire' also impressed me (although I felt the ending was a little too quick for my taste).<br /><br />Collins at least made an attempt for character development outside of Katniss in the other books. However in the Mockingjay most of the key characters fall into a one dimensional element to give poor, used Katniss all the space she needs. In the book she becomes less and less like a human being and more like a cartoonish caricature of a character. Which I can understand, up to a point. I mean, the whole point was to show how war is bleak and how Katniss' character is morphed into something else, into 'The Mockingjay'. I get that.<br /><br />However, Collins decides to treat every other character with a brutality I never expected having read the other two books. Sure, one might expect the tributes to die instantly in some horrific way, but the main characters are destroyed in one form or another in the book. All the important themes and questions in the the other two books are either done away with or removed completely.<br /><br />Take Gale, for example. Or Coin. Even Prim (and she was the entire reason Katniss was in the Hunger Games at all). Or worst of all, Peeta. Collins' handling of the Peeta/Katniss pairing was extremely rough. Peeta's madness for me was probably the bleakest point in the whole book. He embodied all the hope and care in the series and he's reduced to nothing more than a raving maniac. It doesn't help that Katniss' conscience takes a bit of a holiday, refusing to face anything that's happened and living by the mantra 'Kill Snow'.<br /><br />One thing I will say about this book, though - it excelsat cruel irony. Saving Prim from the horrors of the Hunger Games was the whole point of the first book, and the fact that it is the catalyst for everything in the first book makes it all the more difficult for a reader to deal with her sudden death, at the hands of Gale's contraption, no less. Saving Peeta from dying in Catching Fire was sort of Katniss' drive in that book, and he's captured at the end and tortured to the point where his character is effectively stripped away from him. There are no such noble ideals or goals in Mockingjay other than to kill Snow, which is also something Katniss fails to manage. The three books essentially show the shortcomings of her character and how her entire life is ruined by the Hunger Games. Everyone that is close to her is dead or has an extremely flat character, and she herself is empty, devoid of all emotion. For that, this book has 3 stars.<br /><br />But the biggest reason I didn't like 'Mockingjay' was that although Collins goals were fair enough, her execution was poor (somehow I doubt this is meant to mirror Katniss). Reading about District 13 and Capitol politics was fairly dreary at the start, and Collins clearly attempted to turn the ante up (as she did so successfully in the previous 2 books). However, this is done extremely badly (in my eyes). It's as if she was throwing darts at pictures of characters whilst she was writing it. Finnick dies in probably the most pointless fashion. He was just starting to become very interesting (what with Annie) and suddenly that's cut short.<br /><br />The ending for me was pretty terrible. Not because it was bleak and short and lots of people died - because hey, isn't that what war is about? It was bad because it was SO bleak and short that it felt incredibly rushed, that there was next to no closure, and that people died for absolutely no reason. Not to mention the joke of an epilogue. I'd have been happier if Peeta had just killed himself. I for one felt that after everythingKatniss and the Capitol put him through, he'd just be happier dead. But no, Collins decides to make him normal again because Katniss tells him what's real and not real. In doing so she makes Peeta less and less human and more like a really stupid lovestruck guy who will really just act as a shock absorber for all of Katniss' mistakes.<br /><br />My conclusion? If you're going to show how Katniss life was ruined by everything, then at least do it properly. Give it a truly bleak ending and at least have the decency to finish what you started. But if you insist on giving it a happy ending where Katniss and Peeta's children will never be in The Hunger Games, don't make it instantaneous. I for one felt hollow and unsatisfied after reading it. Which is also why I gave it 3 stars. The book makes a fairly good stab at trying to be something it's not, and ends up becoming something thoroughly depressing and unpleasant to read, especially if you've grown to like some of the characters. It's not particularly thought provoking in a melancholy sort of way either. I certainly wasn't very happy with it. Let's see if they use the power of camera to improve on this.
B005I6EVUG|4.0|I actually returned this one because like a dork I ordered the wrong size case.  I actually reordered the same one in the right size and still love it.  Exchange process was super easy.
B0002E5O9G|5.0|I love it.  Had to replace my old one and wanted exactly the same CD.  As much as I loved the movie, I wanted the performers on this version, especially the strength of Javert plus Colm.
0988262592|5.0|Originally got a pre-release excerpt of the book and read it in one sitting, then went and bought the Kindle addition so I could finish it. Was hard to put down.<br /><br />But more importantly I found it gave me insights into realms I thought I understood. Even though the story takes place within a large established manufacturing company, many things still applied to our small startup.

B00910Y1OQ|5.0|The perfect mobile game, colorful, good sound, simple play.  Highly addictive.  All ages enjoy playing this, easy to learn, hard to master.
B009Q6ADG0|1.0|CD has static through out and it skips a couple of times.  Not worth returning since it was only a single song CD.
B00125WAWS|5.0|Oprah produced, Denzel directed and Forrest steals this historical movie about the Wiley College debate team in the 1930s.  Some inaccuracies (they debated USC, not Harvard), but tells a good worthwhile story.  Students interested in our Speech and Debate team watch this movie to give them some idea what is generally involved.  I have all students write their own presentations, as opposed to the film.

B004HD61KE|5.0|As I read, I thought about the places the author took me to, and I was there with all of them, fighting, running, hurting, and crying.  I felt what they felt. The writing is great and very realistic.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Many previous reviewers hit it on the head with this book.  Although it is written about teenagers, the characters are quite mature and it is a VERY good book for adults.  I was worried from all the hints in the reviews that it would be too sad or depressing, but by the end, it really isn't.  All the characters are likable and yet not boring.  This is the kind of book you keep thinking about even when you're not reading it.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|I have no idea how good this app is, because whenever I try to get into it on the app, it says &quot;Weather Channel has stopped.&quot; It may be a great app, I just can't get in. Please fix this obnoxious bug!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B003V1WTMM|5.0|The way in which Kate Morton  weaves her stories is encapsulating. Her books are always hard to put down and have a way of carrying you into the story itself.
B008HK3XU4|5.0|This is color matched to the stylus I bought.  It is everything I expected, except for one item.  I was hoping to have a little pocket or somewhere I could slide my cleaning cloth.  As is I have to put it behind the kindle.

B007FOH7UU|5.0|Great album. Keane does not disappoint. You will find yourself keeping Strangeland on your playlist. I highly recommend seeing them perform live too! Fantastic!
B009YP9L7U|3.0|This story doesn't have much substance, but it presented a distraction.  Sometimes that is what I'm looking for.  The characters weren't real believable....but isn't that what a lot of fiction is about.
B004I744AS|5.0|I've tried many dictionary apps, including Websters. This one absolutely beats them all, hands down! The additional information is also helpful, and entertaining. You can never go wrong with this app! You can try the others first, but you will come back to this one, or you can save all the wasted time and just get this one first and be done with it. This one IS the BEST!

B000OT8GCQ|5.0|Was told to read this before watching the movie. So I have, now I just have to watch it. Lol Terrific and bittersweet to read and once you start it you can't put it down.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|A 'can't put it down' read. Sparks does it again, with a twist for him...a mysterious twist. The movie just came out, I'm looking forward to seeing it. I just hope it sticks to the plot line in the book. LOVE Josh! Woo Hoo! Really like Julianne too!
B001K3JF7K|5.0|I hesitated buying this album because of some negative reviews.  So glad that I ignored them and purchased it!  It's one of my favorite Diana Krall albums of all time.  The songs are all classics and she sings them in that special, breathless style of hers and it's absolutely wonderful!  Her accompanying piano playing comes at perfect points and the orchestration behind her is magnificent.  As you can tell, I LOVED this album!
B008ASGP3U|5.0|I've never read any of the other Rebus' books so I wasn't sure if I'd like this, but I couldn't put it down. An excellent stand alone book with realistic characters and questions left dangling,  there are many loose ends, just like real life. Characters had their feelings hurt and there is no nice tying it up in the end. I now have to go back and read the entire series. Excellent pacing, vivid images and no &#34;stock&#34; characters.  Rebus is a flawed leading man, impossible not to like.
B0037YOMWS|5.0|This is a gift to my girlfriend.<br />She is a administration student, and a great amount of homework is based on finance and accounting.

B005I6EU7U|5.0|I am very pleased with my purchase of this Kindle Fire cover.  Like others have mentioned, it does cover up the sound a bit and I do wish there were a way to prop it up like some other covers but I purchased it knowing full well that it could not. It's a sturdy case and I don't have to worry about the Kindle falling out or being nicked. Looks just like a book cover too!

I did buy one of these last year for my Kindle Fire and that one works great.  The difference:  It has a different end.  So I am still looking for a long corded Kindle Fire charger.  Amazon was great though, as I wanted to return them and it has been over 30 days.  They sent me an e-mail that I will be fully refunded and I can print out a label for shipping.

B003PIUBZS|5.0|Was a gift to my son when he was visiting!  We liked the first season the best and he likes it very much.
B00BB8RKH6|5.0|As painful as it is, one cannot look away, and a morally \\"tidy\\" ending does not take away from the power of the message about addiction and the suffering it causes.  Denzel is merely superb and is surrounded by outstanding actors who make each character stand strong.  I could not detect a bad note in any performance, and whether I knew the actor or not, each character held his or her own.  It will be a hard thing to watch, but I feel that it deals with one of the most compelling and troubling issues of our time.<br /><br />I might also add that the plane sequence that begins the movie is absolutely riveting - worth watching just for that bit alone.
B009NQKXYK|2.0|This not a good movie, story-wise. Too many flaws in character development, and behavior. The characters are silly and make ridiculous decisions, especially since they're supposedly experts in their field.<br /><br />There are some positives... production quality and cinematography are pretty good. Special effects are quite good as well, thanks to Weta.<br /><br />Far too many glaring problems with this movie warrant the low review. I know this won't stop people from watching the movie, but I hope after watching this turd, you will not recommend this movie to others.
B005R32L66|4.0|Trouble finding contacts and loggin in on my  tablet. When I use skype on my pc or laptoop it works very well. I like using Skype and think it is awesome.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|I've never been a big fan of history but these first two books have truly enlightened me. I hate I've reached the last page and can't wait until the next book comes out!
B0094BB4TW|5.0|My girlfriend uses Facebook on our tablet and loves it. She likes that it is available on tablets, phones, pc, laptops, etc.
B005LAIGQE|5.0|This movie is based on actual events that occurred in northern Alaska in 1988. The story is well-written, well-acted, and utterly captivating. The dialogue is extremely clean. There were no objectionable scenes. We loved it.
B008K8VDPU|4.0|Pianst- I really don't use this app at all. I think it will work well for those that are interested.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|The story grabbed me right from page one. It was an easy fun read worth more than .99. Read more of his short fiction at his website,Weir is now one of my favorite writers.
B0044RFT8S|5.0|My grandkids love this movie and have watched it over and over.  Having two copies is helpful when traveling or visiting.
B005Q1W10A|5.0|This story is compelling. It's like an addiction. You just keep watching episode after episode. Have already ordered season 3.
B0096PAA6E|4.0|I caught this guy at the Made In America festival. I'm not sure if it was me or him but it seemed a bit bluesier then.
B007EECSFA|5.0|All of Kate Morton's books are a delightful blend of current and historic events. All of her characters are full and satisfying. Almost as satisfying as the way she wraps things up with a wonderful surprise twist. Although I suspected the outcome of this book, it was still a delightful journey getting there. I want to read it all over again.
B00979CS50|1.0|If every song repeats the same words over and over and over and over you probably don't have anything to say anymore.
030758836X|5.0|Not normally the type of book I would pick to read, but it was my book club's pick for<br />the month.  Must say I throughly enjoyed reading it.  I would recommend it to others.
B000066AVF|5.0|Got this for my dad for father's day simply for the song green onions.  which is really the best song on this album, but well worth the buy!
B009P5K4HK|5.0|This CD/DVD is really enjoyable. It contains many songs that I have never heard Amy perform. The DVD documentary was also very fascinating and show cased a very rare Amy Winehouse performance.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Excellent - compelling - could not put the book down - excellent read - author should write more!!  Great late night read!
B000WCDI64|5.0|If you are an Amy Winehouse fan this is a definite must have. In this video, Amy is at her peak and the band performs masterfully.
B004HW7JH4|3.0|Not as good as the previous four series. Worth watching but doesn't have the pace or hold the interest in the way that it did.
B000063V8T|3.0|As a fan of Star Trek TNG, you really cannot go wrong. Season 5 has many memorable episodes. However, 45 dollars for shows that are more than 20 years old is ridiculous. It should cost no more than 25 dollars.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is very fun and addictive! It is right up there with temple run.  Definately a mindless but challenging app.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|Exactly what I needed.  Great help from tech support. Received item right away. Why do i have to keep writing.Thanks!!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|temple run 2 is way better than the first one! it doesn't get boring because of all the new great graphics. I would highly suggest this app. it's a great time waster
B004SRPXWQ|1.0|There aren't enough nice things that you can do with this cat. You can make it purr a little but mostly its geared toward punching and hurting the cat. The interaction is too violent and promotes laughing at hurting an animal. Disgusting.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is just like temple run but better and upgrades and really awesome stuff like the hoverboard and the spray jetpack.
B00A757EFW|5.0|This kindle version is just like you remember the arcade game to be from years ago. Fun and easy to play.
B007HACDLK|3.0|Having read almost all of the Vince Flynn novels,  I came away with the impression that it was not one of his best efforts.  I read this a while ago and it has not stayed with me as some of his other novels have.  I felt that it was just somehow incomplete.
B008K6HN8I|5.0|Very helpful if you have a kindle. It allows you to explore the contents of your kindle like file explorer on a laptop or desktop computer. You need this if you want to use one of the free camera apps available for kindle fire. Wish this had automatically been loaded on the kindle fire when we bought it but it was easy enough to acquire on our own.
B0002XH9Z4|5.0|I glad with this product. I purchased it days after his death for $32.00.. Everywhere else was asking $85.00 for this same product. It came in the original case and was new...
B004VMUS9G|5.0|Seems to work just fine. Have only used it a few times so can't give any details yet about any idiosyncracies in the app. If I learn more later I will update this review.
B005LAIGPU|5.0|This is the closest we will ever get to a live-action &#34;Akira&#34; film. The camcorder gimmick has been done to death, but i still recommend this highly.
B009S8PEHY|3.0|A compilation of previously recorded and familiar songs.<br />Good for Christmas get togethers and family events over the holidays.<br />He has better CDs
B0061JPYX2|5.0|She's gone but now I found her.  She's got a terrific voice, like a touch of Billy Holiday and good arrangements.  This album is great!
B001UGB1X8|2.0|All I can say is it is typical Tommy Lee Jones, this movie is boring with waste-of-time filler.  I was very disappointed.
0345495004|5.0|Library book sales are dangerous, or so says my husband. I always say I'm not going to buy much, just look. And then . . .<br /><br />A book speaks my name. Or, as in the case of Loving Frank by Nancy Horan, the cover art catches my eye. A lover of many things art deco, this cover grabbed my attention. It wasn't until later, before I actually picked up the book to read it, that I realized the full import of the story held between its covers.<br /><br />Mamah Borthwick Cheney piqued the attention of Nancy Horan as they coincidentally resided, at different times, in Oak Park, Illinos. Oak Park is also where Frank Lloyd Wright built his home and studio in the early 1900s.<br /><br />Mamah (pronounced May-mah) and her husband, Edwin Cheney, were enchanted with Wright's praire style homes he was building around Oak Park. Edwin suggested in 1903 that they talk with Wright about planning and constructing a smaller version of a rather large prairie home some friends were now living in. Mamah initially saw no need to move from their current home, an old Queen Anne.<br /><br />However, after their initial meetings with Wright, Mamah was more than willing to supervise the construction of their new home. Now she had experienced the effect of light and space on Wright's designs, and the freedom cast on the senses of sight and sound attracted Mamah. Many consultations between Mamah and Wright were, of course, required. Over time, Mamah, who is an avid diarist, writes struggling to justify her attraction to the famous architect.<br /><br />During those many consultations, a powerful attraction developed between Mamah and Wright. What they do about their mutual affection for each other stuns their families, society and the architectural community. Their actions change Chicago society as well as the lives of many people, including their children.<br /><br />Horan's fascination with Mamah Cheney has its roots in the stunning fact that Mamah has been consistently relegated to mere mentions, almost footnote-like. Someone to be scooped under the rug, so to speak. Perhaps considered an embarassment and someone not to be mentioned in some circles, Horan has researched to the minutest detail the intricacies and intelligence in the persona of the woman who gave up so much for Frank Lloyd Wright.<br /><br />Mamah might be said to have been an early activist in the search for women's rights and freedoms. She was a woman who wanted to be involved and challenged. Mamah struggles as many women today struggle balance conflicting roles: wife, mother, intellectual, dreamer, and in Mamah's case, lover. Faced with choices in her life, Mamah does what her heart leads to her do.<br /><br />Wright certainly did his share of suffering as well, but in his professional life Mamah was an asset. She was willing to face his temperament and often shared her opinions of his work when he least wanted them. Eventally and often, Mamah's advice was what a project needed to be successful. She was a most profound influence on Wright's later work.<br /><br />Nancy Horan has written a debut novel which required an enormous amount of research. In so doing, she has opened the door to us of the inner spirit of an amazing woman, Mamah Borthwick Cheney. Mamah could be called \\"Everywoman's Woman,\\" and Horan leads to this understanding of Mamah's choices.<br /><br />Filled with romance, struggle, poignant scenes, and heartbreak, I offer you a book that provides everything a reader is looking for in a well-written, biographical novel.<br /><br />A FAVORITE QUOTE ABOUT MAMAH FROM WRIGHT:<br /><br />\\"... I love the woman who has cast in her lot with me here not wisely but too well. She too has her remunerative work -- as I have. She is quite able to supply her own needs -- and we work together ...\\"  Source: About Wright: An Album of Recollections by Those Who Knew Frank Lloyd Wright, page 73.tions, almost footnote-like.

B008JMKN4Y|5.0|Love love love this book! Very addicting! Couldn't put it down till I finished it! Can't wait for part two in April!!! :)
B007REV4YI|5.0|Up for 5 Academy Awards, this 23rd James Bond movie is a standalone top notch film for action fans.  The chase scenes are octane, the villain is nasty and the women are at the top of their game.  As one of the longest films in the franchise, the movie never lets go from the viewers minds.  The title song will never leave my heart.
B0027MJU00|4.0|I have read all of Gillian Flynn's books, and while this is not quite as good as Gone Girl, I do prefer it over Sharp Objects.  It's a fast-paced story with another flawed heroine you can't help but root for.
0345803493|5.0|I have read and re-read this book twice since receiving it! I will often re-read favorite parts - this is a very good book! You fall in love with the characters and become invested in their story. Very well written and very descriptive :)
B006LSZECO|5.0|Over the course of this book, I didn't want it to end while simultaneously wanting to know what happened.  The characters are fascinating, and they waver between being relatable and repulsive.  A great read!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Thought provoking!  This book is high paced yet written so well that it really  makes u think<br />If u have not read this I definitely recommend it
B0000E6I1J|5.0|Ravi Shankar said it and you feel it while listening : the spirit and love of George is so present in this music !
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|Great blend of puzzle games. A real challenge and a lot of fun. I thoroughly enjoy it<br /><br />Can.t wait to ply it all the way through
B0002HZHXG|5.0|The Light and sound module is a nice addition to the Bruder truck I gave my grandson for Christmas. Bruder products are well ade.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I enjoyed reading the hunger games series. I couldn't put the book down. I was thrilled to have a happy ending after so much tragedy.
B00000273M|4.0|THE BANGLES-GREATEST HITS: Beginning life as THE BANGS, west coast four-tet THE BANGLES combined BEATLE-esque pop, girl group harmonies, and bubblegummy new wave licks for a solid three album career in the eighties (the same amount their sister act THE GO-GO'S managed before splitting up). SUSANNAH HOFF's kewpie doll looks and flirty pipes were often the focal point, with exquisite harmonizing (and occasional lead vocals) from guitar-and-drums siblings VICKI and DEBBIE PETERSON and bassist MICHELLE STEELE. A strong reliance on outside writers yielded crafty covers of KATRINA & THE WAVES member KIMBERLY REW's GOING DOWN TO LIVERPOOL, PRINCE's MANIC MONDAY, and JULES SHEAR's IF SHE KNEW WHAT SHE WANTS. The gimmicky WALK LIKE AN EGYPTIAN became their albatross, while last gasp hits included the pseudo-psychedelic IN YOUR ROOM and breathless ballad ETERNAL FLAME. ALEX CHILTON's power pop masterpiece SEPTEMER GURLS is a notable omission here, but jangly axe work, cool chick attitude and highly polished studio gloss all figure prominently in this hard to resist time capsule.<br /><br />RATING: FOUR GALS
B004EBT5CU|5.0|Adele is very talented her voice brings a new level of perfection. I truly hope that she soon  cuts another album
B008B9JSKU|3.0|typically great sam jackson performance but average direction and poor writing.if you like sam jackson rent this film.i doubt it will get multiple viewings.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|I didn't expect it to be that good. August is very  mature for his age. He has been through a lot . August has problems that he  sees but none of his friends do.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|On Temple Run 1, all you do is run, but on this version, the graphics are much better and you can change your character.It is a fun game to play.Get it!!!!  :)
B005EY2XFC|5.0|The Crow is one of my favorite movies and one that holds a dear place in my heart. I was impressed with the quality of the high definition bluray, as it wasn't filmed of a high quality to begin with. Not a lot of extras, but I didn't expect there to be. A must-have for any Crow fan!
B006CQLGXG|5.0|I have always enjoyed this book and I try to get to watch all of the adaptions  of it every Christmas.
B0027BOL4G|5.0|Very informative. The food industry is doing a lot of bad things, things that might make us not want to eat it. All should watch this movie. Special features too!
B007SGM084|5.0|This was a fantastic series full of great characters that you fall in love with(and hate) with your whole heart.Excellent!
B0031RAOVY|5.0|IT WAS A GREAT MOVIIE, it had a good story and showed the family reality.<br /><br />it seemed so true and real
0061714372|4.0|I recently got into Megadeth and wanted to learn more about the bands founder Dave Mustaine. Got the book on a Friday and was finished reading it by Monday. It was an easy read and pretty informative. Some good behind the scenes dirt and stories. It was definately worth the money and I would recommend it for anyone who wants to learn about Dave and his band.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|My 7 year-old daughter and I really love this game. It's fun and entertaining. The graphics are great too. Thank you!
B000QCS8TW|5.0|I found it very difficult to put this book down.<br /><br />The way each chapter is from the perspective of a different character keeps the reading fresh, and lends to a very cinematic feeling throughout the entire book.<br /><br />The last few chapters I especially felt made everything I had read before worth it.
B00992CF6W|5.0|this is absolutely the best game ever!! what I really like about it is that it is for everyone. its a great building game for aspiring architects, a fun game on survival mode, and great for the adventurer. over all, best game in the appstore.
B008JFUUIA|5.0|Im not even a big fan of musical movies and shows... butttt... this really is awesome I have watched it maybe 15 times and I still laugh! my husband even enjoyed it he didnt LOVE it or anything but it did make him laugh :)
B009369Z8A|5.0|This came in time for the present that it was ordered for.  He loved it and has added it to his library.
B004SD5GZ4|3.0|I needed it for a program I was trying to download it to the iPad.  It would not work on it.
B0085YNML2|4.0|Kids love to play this game.  I think it is a fun game too.  Good for working on problem solving skills.
B0096PYUE2|3.0|Even though I know I will need this program it's not what I thought it would be. I do plan to keep it even though I don't need it now
B007SYWFRM|2.0|This game is slow, boring and not easy to use on a tablet.  I also got stuck on a level because I didn't want to connect with strangers to let them view my village.  The movie is more fun and doesn't waste as much time.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Very fun game it's a huge sandbox. Minecraft is a very fun game if you love to build. You can build anything you want. Build a house or hotel even city. It's amazing what you can build on minecraft.
B005HSL626|5.0|This is a fun game, and free!  I like the 3 different game modes and can't help but smile when I get the sparkling bananas.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Very addicting game. It keeps you guessing all the time. My kids will love it. This game will keep them entertained.
B004XZR63M|4.0|This book was the beginning of my financial literacy journey, at 25,  I feel on track with building my assests column I just wish I read this 5  years ago.
1926778537|5.0|This artbook was a gift for a friend who is a darksiders fan, by the look of his face while he was turning the pages I had no doubts it is an excellent product.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This book is unlike any I've ever read. It is full of suspense and mystery. It is extremely difficult to explain how good the book is, because you just start reading it and become generated in the story. The basic premise is that a husband one day comes home to find his wife missing and obvious signs of struggle. However, that does no justice to what this book becomes. The investigation leaves you literally convinced of innocence and guilt every other page. Unlike many books, I never had that thought of knowing something for sure, ie: \\"Well, there is absolutely no way that character was involved at all.\\" Literally I had no real clue until Gillian Flynn wanted me to have a clue. I would recommend this to anyone in the mood for a new kind of suspense.
B0073V7YTY|5.0|My office at the hospital has a tendence to get &#34;loud&#34; and this app was great at allowing me to get my point across very well.  Sometimes &#34;silence really IS golden&#34; and this was a subtle &#34;in your face&#34; way to prove it.  Excellent - thank you!
0321701763|5.0|As with all of Adobe Photoshop classroom books it is very informational. Worth it's money. I'm enjoying it very much.
B009VYF5E2|5.0|I love the Arthur legend.  Even though there are changes with the legend, in this series, the forth season is just as great and entertaining as the other 3 seasons.  The characters have been fully developed so things can move along  without having to establish what kind of person he or she is.  I love the magic and hopefully, they will, sometime, have Arthur find out about Merlin's great powers and except it, so there can be more magic in the show.  The big dragon is still around, and there is a new baby dragon.  I recommend this series to people who like the Arthur legend, or just like fantasy.
0783233477|5.0|I believe this was one of the best Brad Pitt movies out. Everyone in the movie was great. It was an excellent movie.
B003UYUP58|5.0|The best resource for anyone who wants straightforward information and explanations of the history of cancer and cancer treatment. It's full of invaluable information that demystifies cancer and the many diseases that fall under that name.
1444737090|5.0|I loved this book. Easy to read and the best of all and which makes more interesting that is a real history. Makes a lot more interesting to read. Great buy.
B008AK8FHM|1.0|Although I am very interestesd in the afterlife this book is very hard to get through.  Its more about the Drs. profession then what the books title implies.  I put it down after trying to plow through the all this.  I probably will not finish it....very disappoointing;
145210655X|5.0|This was such a witty, funny book.  I bought it for my fiance for Christmas and he loved reading it to our daughter.  I can't wait to get the next installment.
B0015DROBO|4.0|Enjoyable read, which fleshed out what the movie left vague. Believable and likable characters and an intriguing modern twist kept me turning pages.
B00APJLFEG|5.0|I might not watch it again very soon but I really did enjoy this movie.  I had no idea the cast was full of such great people.  It was funny but alike many movies, when you see it once the surprise is gone then you might not feel the need to watch it again.  Definitely worth the watch.
B00A8LYYI0|5.0|So I'm not familiar with the games, I've only played the first and I was too young to remember. This movie just blew me away when it came to visuals and sound, usually some movies I have to lower the volume when it gets loud at some parts and then other times you can't even hear the people talking but this wasn't the case with this movie. The sound was well balanced and the picture quality of the blu ray version is amazing!! I don't understand why a lot of people were in happy with the movie...it's a great movie, I had a lot of fun watching it. I mean come on ppl this isn't titanic it ain't gonna be an award winning movie but it is going to be a worth watching movie that will definitely keep you entertained and now it has made me want to play the games :) hope they make another silent hill movie!!!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This Book... I can't say anything BAD about this book! it was amazing the best Colleen has written so far! she made Sky so likable and then Holder, don't even get me started on him! he was perfect, but not too perfect. Just enough to make him...ahhh perfect. The emotional twist and turns the book took me for was just amazing! I couldn't put it down! I love the 'terms' she makes up for all her books! I don't want to give too much away but I needed countless Chapter Breaks throughout the book and If you haven't read this book yet, you NEED TO, like NOW.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|This is a story of a great man, who learned how to 're-invent daily. Just read it and be inspired to do better. The story of Steve Jobs is the story of a man who demand perfection, and required it of those he worked with. I think all people who are trying to be the best should read it. It will inspired and make you sad.
B00A1XOPE8|3.0|What struck me about this story was how similar what the main character did was to developing and writing characters. I enjoyed Sanderson`s view on the process. As always Sanderson provides a unique and interesting magic system and world in which the plot plays out. The main character seems a bit 2D, as do many of his female leads until he has enough time to lead us to loving him as he does. Unfortunately the nature of a novella does not allow for this. Never the less, the story and underlying glimpse into the author`s view was sufficiently novel and compelling to  blast through this book. If you enjoy Sanderson`s writing and appreciate a clever tight plot with interesting characters and magics, this one is for you.
B009EEFTMC|1.0|It doesn't work with FUHU NABI2.  When I push a button, the app locks up.  It is suppose to be compatible with the Nabi.  I hope the programmer will release a new update.
B00AQ71FLK|1.0|ridiculous amount of space and time to download.  Lost patience and couldn't justify the space it takes up.  Silly app.
0393089134|4.0|Clockwork Orange stands as a excellent piece of literature that stands the test of time. At times its characters are offbeat, and also brilliant, and still disturbing. Highly creative and packed with a colorful (and different) view of the world.
B007TK77QE|5.0|This book is well written with beautifully rich characters, honestly drawn. The plot flows smoothly at a good pace.Great read.
0765325950|5.0|unlike Lost, i don't feel like my time spent reading the books was wasted. sanderson got the story to where jordan needed it to go. i didn't read any reviews until i just finished the book and was surprised at all the 1-stars. if you liked the series at all up until this point, this is how it was always supposed to end. maybe you don't like it, but i thought it was as good as i could hope.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|very great game indeed i want to play the game sequal if theres one. i would reccommend this game to whom loves murder mystery
B000B6CO52|5.0|My kids have seen this movie on TV and now they can watch it any time on their hand held gaming device! Great purchase. No problem with seller either.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is very addictive and entertaining. Has great boosts throughout the game to keep things interesting. Hard To stop playing. I tell everyone I know to get it, and the 2x coin deal is worth buying.
B001BKVWYG|5.0|OK , he is or is no Dylan, but here's the thing: he is saying something ( as Dylan did) in his lyrics that is very compelling. I honestly thought I would like the doc and hate the music; I ended up loving both. This is one of the best documentaries I have ever seen.  S***: he pretty much nailed me to the wall with \\"Street Boy\\". simple proof of the power of art to transcend time. I listen to this album a lot, because it's damn good; Motown knew it, they just could not get him over the La Bamba hurdle to be taken seriously.Now look at him; he's on the charts as he should be. Right on, Senor Rodriguez!
B004VDSWQ6|4.0|I think  the performance of Ronnie James Dio is  outstanding<br />I really enjoy this blue ray<br />, and I hardly recommended
B008ZOHCKE|4.0|Good app, works well for taking your notes, I like that it gives you a good amount of choices, color and styles, fonts ect
B0096A9QXC|4.0|This game is AMAZING!!! I have a great time playing it with my friends. What is fun is that there is a goal set for you at the beginning, and you have to earn your way through the game to reach it. There are I think 10or or 11 little games on it. A upgrade worth it from the free version, with only 4 games.<br />  It would get 5 stars if it didn't crash all the time on my kindle fire. Sometimes I am close to finishing a game when it freezes and puts me back to my home screen. It gets so annoying!<br />  Please fix this glitch! Otherwise, I recommend tap the frog to anyone!
0307346617|5.0|Started reading the book and got so into it that before I knew it, 2 hours had pass by. Great book to get lost into.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Great book and greater American, my thanks to all the military<br />I hated the way we treated our Vietnam vets on their return.
0684824906|5.0|This book was impossible to find in hard copy at Christmas time but was a great Valentine's Day gift for my husband who loved the movie &#34;Lincoln&#34;.
B004LWZWGK|1.0|Liked the movie. Not as good as Dark Knight (imho) - Bane can't touch Ledger's Joker. But, I'm not here to debate acting or video quality - others have done that very well already.<br /><br />What drags this title down to 1 star for me is that Warner Bros. opted for NO CHOICE for digital copy! Unlike Dark Knight, I get Ultraviolet or nothing. I'm not going to be sucked down into the debate pit about which format is better. I prefer iTunes but others might like the new Ultraviolet. This disk is part of a flotilla of titles that have been Ultraviolet only - just to avoid a small iTunes charge. And with the exception of Deathly Hallows, the studios have been unwilling to trade leaving me with a format I can't use. I prefer supporting the entertainment business through many Blu-ray purchases but the studios should know that limiting options only encourages more people to torrent sites which is bad for everyone. Equal empathy for those who did not want to or could not use the iTunes-only digitals for the same reasons.<br /><br />So, thumbs down Warner Bros for choosing greed over customer service! Let's vote with our dollars and NOT support this kind of product!<br /><br />Matthew
B009LMBVTW|4.0|This recording of the Velvet Underground at Cleveland's La Cave in 1968 has been circulating in various pirate editions for years now, and while this version doesn't sound any better than the bootlegs, it's a factory-pressed silver disc at regular prices instead of a premium-priced CD-R, so fans who want an affordable physical copy of this document should grab it while it lasts. This was one of Doug Yule's very first shows with the Velvets, but he fits in well and the band is fiery here, with Lou Reed and Sterling Morrison offering up some ferocious guitar work (the wailing blast of &#34;What Goes On&#34; was strong enough to be included on the PEEL SLOWLY AND SEE box set) and Reed offering different lyrics on &#34;Pale Blue Eyes.&#34; It sounds like it was recorded on a portable cassette machine (which it was), but look past the flawed audio and you'll hear a marvelous set from a legendary band.
B0063IH60K|4.0|An easy game to play. Love the choice of how I want to play, random or winning hands. Easy to play to my moods.
B00AF6B22E|2.0|It was interesting for about 1/3 of the movie. The other hour was slow, anticlimactic and very predictable. Good for a drama I suppose, but I expected more suspense and action from Denzel. Don't get me wrong, the acting and cinematography are spot on! But...
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Love this calculator! It comes in quite handy when balancing my checkbook. I don't have to worry about having another appliance to deal with; can just use my Kindle with this calculator and the web and balance my account in a snap. Plus, the size of the numbers is a Huge advantage! Give it a shot! Guarantee you'll Love it!!!
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Fun game to pass the time, easily addictive. Sometimes touchscreen doesn't respond to swipe commands which is a little annoying. Overall love the game.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|If you've been reading the series this long there isn't much else to say about it. The 5th installment of a fantastic book series that I can't wait to read more of. It's extremely detailed and I would recommend it to any fantasy reader.
B004AQR29C|4.0|Decided to watch this with my husband and son on Saturday.  I am no stranger to watching action/adventure movies and I recognized most of the major players.  It was fast paced and kept our attention, but my husband did mention it seemed familiar... to which I answered well they are following a pretty basic formula.  Pretty girls, bad guys, undercover secret agents....while I wouldn't watch it twice it was fun to watch sitting on my couch with on the big screen!
B0075MFS9Y|5.0|I can't recommend this album enough..Get This Album!  This is an incredible price for an incredible album.  Not a bad song here.
B003Y5H5AG|3.0|Good but the storyline was a bit predictable. Nice movie for younger children - older ones will find it a bit ... predictable! :)
B009EEFTMC|5.0|This game is INCREDIBLE! Usually the free app of the day sounds kind of meh, and scores about 3 stars. This one had pretty good reviews and 4.5 stars so I thought I'd check it out. I was immediately hooked. I will play this game for hours, I can tell already. Housework will fail to be done because of this game. The kids may even have to learn to cook for and clean up after themselves so I can play more game!<br /><br />The graphics look wonderful, colors are awesome, game action is addicting. I love that you can turn the cube at ANY angle. You can score matches as quickly as you can find them, there is no lag time. It's easy to play, and challenging but not to the point of being frustrating. If you like mah jong, you will love this game. If you don't like mah jong you will still love this game.<br /><br />Well worth a dollar. Seriously. Even though I got it for free, still easily worth a dollar. SPEND THE DOLLAR. YOU WON'T REGRET IT.
B005LAIHSG|2.0|I was rather taken aback with the violence and &#34;dark side&#34; quality of what is supposed to be a children's show. My 13yr and 11yr old and I sat to look at this, and they were more disappointed than I was. The typical &#34;good vs evil&#34; can be show without it being so dark. We came away wondering what the message really was in all that. The special effects and good acting, which we would normally appreciate, paled into the background. Very disappointing. Too many shows now have too much &#34;dark side&#34; to them. What ever happened to movies that left you feeling edified and entertained?
B008HT4FUW|5.0|Throughly enjoyed the series and purchased season 3 which we have already watched.  Nice to have a place to purchase it
B0034JKZ86|3.0|My daughter enjoyed this movie but didn't appreciate the parts with the dark spirits - rather uncalled for, or could have been depicted less &#34;dark side&#34;.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|it is a game j am happy I down loaded just as good as the first one you will have a great time playing it the way I have.
B000092T6M|3.0|I am a Kevin Costner fan - the man is just talented and ever so pleasant on the eyes. I enjoyed the movie and the humour, and twists and turns. However, this is supposed to be a show that children (older ones) will look at. I did not think it was necessary to make the witch so grotesque, neither was it necessary to have the sheriff hold down Lady Marion the way it was portrayed. Apart from that, it was a good adaption.
0316066524|5.0|I actually had a dream a few days after finishing this book that i found new chapters to read. It was a happy dream until i woke up and remember I had finished the book lol.<br /><br />This wasnt the usual cerebral unsatisfying ending thing.  No for me IJ may be like some are into Harry Potter or Lord of the Rings (I was a big fan of LOTR in my youth).  Once i got to page 300 i was hooked on this book.<br /><br />A bit of irony in this as one character in it gets addicted to the TV Show MASH.  I could relate as though MASH was an ok TV show it was easy to get so absorbed in it you found part of you was there.<br /><br />The book overall deals with some heavy ideas of free will and addiction and how one affects the other.  But as some wink wink kind of joke there is also an aspect to it of the book itself being an addiction.<br /><br />The book is literally (pun inevitable) dense but once you make it in you are immersed.  In some ways it shimmers with brilliance and others it has a snide campy feel but all in all whether by intention, or by necessity the book itself is an addiction.  Gamers and internet junkies can seriously relate I am sure.  Especially with the granularity of the immersion.
B007LB1O3I|5.0|I love this album!  It is state of the art sound and lyrical poetry enveloping an emotional rollercoaster ride.  Madonna always makes us feel her music, not just listen to it.
B000LXHK22|5.0|A movie without violence, in our society of violence, is very welcomed by this viewer. The question for the movie industry; are you listening.
B0013D6LEM|5.0|What is better than classic Michael Jackson. The Thriller album reminds me of my childhood. I love listening to this!
B00B2V66VS|4.0|an awesome game, wonderful graphics. added new objects and new game play areas. still having problems with swiping and commands not perfect but I think it might be operator issues.
0756655307|5.0|This is definitely for the comic book geek in all of us.  This complete guide has the origins, history, and description of all the characters worth following.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|i really like it and it has many nice features and it is very useful to me and its awesome
B001AQO3QA|5.0|There  are  only a  few  motion pictures ever  made,  that<br />can make a claim  to  science-fiction-horror  royalty !!<br /><br />Three  visionary  directors, Ridley  Scott, James Cameron,  and<br />David Fincher ( The Game) bring  storytelling to  a  sharp  edge,<br />in these three  movies  based  on  characters  conceived  by<br />writing / producing team Dan O'Bannon and  Ronald  Shusett.<br /><br />Master James Whale  set  the  benchmark  in 1935, with  \\"The Bride  of<br />Frankenstein\\".  Irving  Pichel set the  bar  again,  in  1950  with his<br />\\" Destnation: Moon\\".  Rudolph  Mate'  set  it  even  higher  with  \\"When<br />Worlds  Collide\\" in  1951.  Fred Mcleod  Wilcox took the  crown in  1956,<br />when  he  turned  in  \\"Forbidden  Planet\\".  Stan Kubrick ripped  the  crown<br />away from  Wilcox  in  1968's \\" 2001: A Space Odyssey\\".<br /><br />\\"ALIEN\\" set  the  bar  once  again,  in  1979, as  Ridley  Scott proved<br />that  you  don't  need  \\"big name\\" actors  to tell a  scary  story.<br /><br />Cameron  took  that  theme, with  \\"ALIENS\\" in  1986.<br /><br />David Fincher's  sense  of visual storytelling came  to the  screen  in<br />1992's  \\"ALIEN 3\\".<br /><br />Own the  box  set, and  be  terrified  for  hours!!  Get your popcorn<br />ready,  folks !!<br /><br />H E Sawyer, PhD
B00A6N8F4Y|1.0|Every once in a while I believe that an actor takes on a poor script because they (like all of us) have debts. This seemed to be that kind of a movie. Make a crappy movie, collect your check, pay your mortgage.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|This is my newest addiction. You get to breed different dragons and feed them and grow your park and it's cool.
B001ANSS5K|4.0|Supposed to be teen- oriented, but well-written. Had a little trouble with the self obsession of the main character at the expense of his friends. I likes it.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|I get on a binge where I just play this game all day. I really like it. I name the stuff after my exes.
B00AQCMK32|4.0|A great game where you manage a new game studio from the very advent (almost) of Video games. Starting from PC's and the earliest game consoles (As parodies e.g. Intendo &#34;Whoops&#34;) to the most recent generation (and then a space probe thingy) this game allows you to make some very wacky combinations of genres and themes, like a cowboy themed dating simulator (genre), though most of zany combinations don't work. you will use combinations of 8 different employee types to work on making games, doing various contract work, and eventually, a console.
B007REV4YI|5.0|I like Daniel Craig as the newest James Bond though I wasn't thrilled with the second movie starring him as Bond. This one has a very gritty feel- like a reboot of the series. And if you can afford the price, the blueray/ dvd/ digital combo is well worth it for any movie nowadays.
B009ZXT4BY|1.0|you have 15 minutes to play and it sucks because it haze nothing it is the worst game ever it is mud
B009O07NDY|4.0|There are a few small pieces from the movie that are missing, but it's pretty complete.  My son loves the song &#34;Misty Mountains,&#34; the song the dwarves sing at Bilbo's place.  That song is a little thin - wish they could have given it a bigger in studio treatment.
0061906220|5.0|Children seem to memorize the book. Pete the cat fits any occasion in their lives. What a good book for children.
B004TJ1H3C|5.0|Just what he asked for. It got here very quickly in time for x-mas. Was very surprised as he'd been look for it a while.
B006OAB3ME|5.0|I got this CD for my birthday in September (2012).  I was so happy to receive this.  I love Paul's music.  He does an excellent job with these old songs and his voice sounds so dreamy.  I just swoon every time I listen to this cd.  \\"My Valentine\\" is a great song with great lyrics which is romantic and appropriate for Valentine's Day.  I think my least favorite song is the last one called \\"Only Our Hearts.\\"  Stevie Wonder plays the harmonica.  The harmonica is loud and it overpowers Paul's soft voice along with the soft violins in the background.  Nothing against Stevie Wonder, by the way.  I just didn't think the harmonica was appropriate for that type of song and it sounds too modern.  Overall, great CD!

0385536828|3.0|This novel was perfectly pleasant, but I found the main character to be unpleasantly dull, considering she should be pretty amazing (both because of her life as depicted in the novel, and because the book is a ll about her).<br />While reading, I thought to myself \\"male writers are never very good at fleshing out female protagonists\\" (which is totally unfair to male writers, but sometimes its true)- and it held true throughout.  The final chapters help explain some of what I was feeling, but the bottom line is that the story is just not that captivating.<br />McEwan's Atonement was a lot better - this is similar in quality to Amsterdam, also not his best.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|I liked it. It made me cry. But there was something missing. I wanted me of an ending as well. Maybe an epilogue.... wedding, future children, something.<br /><br />I expected more. After all, this IS Nicholas Sparks. But, good none the less :)<br /><br />3.5 stars from me
B00AREIAI8|4.0|My daughter has this app and I liked it so much I put it on my kindle too.  The tasks are fun and easy to follow even for a young child.
B000QXDED6|4.0|The men of Sparta did not have short hair... They had long hair, and they combed and groomed each other's hair and rubbed perfume into each other's hair before battle.<br /><br />The men of Sparta... All these guys you see in this movie.... Engaged in homosexual relationships with one another.  The thought being, if the man fighting next to you was not only your friend - but your lover as well, you'd be more likely to fight along him.  I'm not making that up.  You don't have to like it, but it's a historical fact.  Hope you enjoy the movie =)<br /><br />History is fun.
075669812X|5.0|Two of my grandsons have this book and they read it very much to learn about the characters.  I RECOMMEND  IT.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|Such a charming book - both funny and sweet. Very well written with humorous dialect and a story that completely holds your interest.  It is now one of my all time favorites!
B00B2V66VS|3.0|I love this game but every time I get to three thousand coins they take all most all of the coins away from me FIX IT PLEASE
B0042KA4VO|5.0|My girlfriend told me about the series on TV and I wanted to get caught up.  Love it and now I am hooked and watch on the CW.  Great DVD for teenagers
0380713802|5.0|He manages to absolutely &#34;nail it&#34;, either positively or negatively - I share many of his feelings about the places he visits, and even if I do not, he is delightful to read
B009LT1YZ6|4.0|This is a very unique game and different from any other fish game you will play. It is very cool in black and white and the music is great. It is worth 99 cents. The game is pretty difficult but still very fun
B0044C5SCU|4.0|Leave's in a warp and waitin' for more. This whole series is not just another sci-fi show it gets you involved and the writing makes for a touching and believable plot. Makes you wish U had a portal so you could see it in the other 'Universe'.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|I love g5 games and this one is a very good mystery game. you do have to pay for the game though
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is addicting. You are not going to want to put it down. I play it on my kindle fire and I have it on my phone as well. I recommend it to anyone who likes an action filled game.

1932735410|3.0|I'm currently in the early preparation phases for the PMP Certification process.<br /><br />To get a complete understanding of the material I've taken a three-pronged approach. I purchased this (an exam prep book), the most current PMBOK guide (aka PMI \\"scripture\\"), and I'm also working through the \\"PMP Prepcast\\" podcasts (fulfills the contact hours requirement and provides at least some sort of \\"instruction\\"). I'm balancing studying and working so I didn't necessarily expect to take the exam until October or November of this year.<br /><br />Here's the part that escaped my notice... this edition (seventh) is not updated to the most current PMBOK guide (which is in it's fifth edition).<br /><br />In addition, the publisher of this book says on their website \\"This new edition of the worldwide best-selling PMP® exam preparation book is specifically written for people who plan to sit for the PMP® examination before July 31st, 2013.\\" That came as a disappointing surprise. I hadn't gone to the publishers website until after I purchased the book and read the Introduction (it instructs you to go there to sell you additional products). This is not mentioned anywhere in the Amazon Description. Instead the Amazon description says: \\"This book has been FULLY updated to reflect PMI's new Exam Content Outline, for any and all PMP exams delivered on or after August 31st of 2011.\\"<br /><br />I definitely dropped the ball on researching this, but I also feel slightly misled. As a result, I find myself 2nd guessing the material because I really don't know what has changed in the PMBOK between the 4th edition and the 5th edition. I'm also unsure about the exam now...<br />Does this mean PMBOK version 4 is okay to study from until 7/31/13?<br />If I take the exam in November 2013 will there be a version 8 of this book that I need to purchase?<br />Why didn't I notice I was buying a book published in July 2011 to prepare for material published in January 2013?<br /><br />I'm giving itthree stars because after completing three chapters I can see the brilliance behind the book. It is solid on approach and is helping me understand how to process the information. I'm just taking the material it's trying to teach with a grain of salt.<br /><br />I will provide an update when I understand the impact of trying to use the mismatched editions. In the meantime, my advice is to be warned of what you're getting into. It might be smarter to buy an older version of this prep book (much, much cheaper) to get the benefits as far as exam approach and then wait it out for the version that is based off of the most recent PMBOK.
B001EBWING|5.0|Although this movie has had some criticism, I thought it was overall enjoyable. It is much different from movies nowadays - you actually have to pay attention.
B001SMC91M|5.0|Black Joe Lewis & The Honeybears are a band which are more commonly labelled &#34;Retro-Soul&#34; these days. Alike one of their peer bands, Vintage Trouble, the label hardly describes the contents. Black Joe Lewis is &#34;the real deal&#34;. If you don't like dancing all over the house and singing along with a grin from ear to ear then don't buy this. There is no way you can listen to something like this and stay seated. This is a solid tight soulful band the likes of what we've seen come out of Muscle Shoals and Memphis. Joe Lewis has a course but deep and soulful set of vocals that fits them like a glove! If you love Otis, Aretha, Wilson Pickett or Sam & Dave, don't hesitate to snatch this one up!
6305510016|4.0|Unfortunately I bought this accidentally from the USA and not from UK so I cannot watch the movien from the tv but I watched it from my computer.
B007REV4T8|5.0|I enjoyed it a lot....as much as Casino Royal which was imho one of the best Bond movies in a while.<br /><br />I didn't like Quantum of Solace that much, but SkyFall is definitely worth getting.
B005LAJ16I|5.0|Homeland is excellent but unfortunately I bought it  from the USA and not from UK so the area code is wring for me. But I can watch it from my combuter.
B003KRJNBW|5.0|One of Denzel Washington's great movies that sends message to the people of faith. Highly recommended to anyone but kids. Lots of blood.
B00B2QA2F4|3.0|It was good and typical Yarantino. I like the throwback to 70s Kung Fu movie styles. However, the lead actor was bad, very bad. One of the most margibal acting jobs I've seen  in a while. Not even B movie grade.
B0025KVLRY|5.0|Sounds great, started listening as soon as it arrived.  It was packaged well and now I am just writing to achieve enough words to submit this review.  Hey, it's the Beatles, not much to be said other than they are Awesome!
0393061310|3.0|This book tackles an interesting and complicated topic. The author's commitment and scholarship are impressive but it is not at all well written. At times, its style is only somewhat better than the dullest of textbooks. Adding to the tedium, are numerous repetitions of material. This may be due, in part, to the difficulties of organizing such a mammoth topic but I mostly blame poor editing. I expected to enjoy reading this acclaimed book but found it dull and surprisingly lacking in fresh, illuminating ideas.
B003VANOFY|1.0|Pros:<br />Great sound<br />Cool features<br />Very comfortable<br />Good mic<br />Wireless<br />Good battery life<br /><br />Cons:<br />The connectivity sucks- randomly disconnects while sitting right next to the receiver.<br />Cannot connect via USB<br />Bad range, will disconnect across the room<br /><br />Despite being very comfortable and sounding really good, I wouldn't buy this again if I had the choice because of the connectivity issues- you can't experience any of the pros if it won't stay connected.  Its been an issue since I got it and never gotten better.  This is a very common problem with the headset judging by how many hits come back with the same issue with an internet search.  AFAIK there's no fix and Logitech hasn't addressed the problem.  People say that it might have to do with other wireless devices near the receiver but I live in a dorm and cannot control that variable.  Really disappointed in Logitech as I've been a fan for a long time and trusted the brand to deliver a good reliable product.

B00B0NDF26|5.0|This is an excellent album from Tegan & Sara! It's a departure from the sound we're used to from them, but the progression to this sound makes sense after Sainthood.

B0086700CM|5.0|This is the most addicting game I ever played.  I spent hours playing this game.  I also love how you can compare awards and scores with your game circle friends.  Get This Game. It is a fantastic game. I love it.
B009HV2JT8|5.0|We ordered this movie for out date night! Was a great movie and streamed flawlessly on our Sony Dvd player!
B005HSL626|5.0|This is a great game.  You can unlock new backgrounds or blades.  One thing though, a couple times when I would go on my game all the date would be lost and I would have to start the game all over.  I would still suggest this game.
B0091REZMW|4.0|this game offers hours of fun and numerous challenges with its variety of modes to play under.  two thumbs up.
B003O86FMW|3.0|Really good book. I can not wait to read the third book. Will be starting it soon. I will also look forward to seeing the second and third movies.

B005Y423ZC|5.0|Thank You!  This was an excellent film and was of the highest quality!  I would recommend it to a friend!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I almost finished this book last night but had too much left to read. I normally do not read contemporary romance preferring the historical romances. I kept seeing this title on the top kindle sales and wondered but when I saw a blurb in People magazine I decided that I may be missing something.<br /><br />This was my first Nicholas Sparks book but not my last. I am retired and because I read a lot not many books knock my socks off but this one did. I admit I did not understand a lot about an abusive alcoholic spouse nor an abused wife's response. This book was thought provoking about this as well as being an entertaining book. So entertaining that it was hard to put it down.<br /><br />Just when I was thinking I had been to a great informative seminar there was \\"the letter\\". The author snared me again.<br /><br />Great read.
B0098VXE50|5.0|Thank you so much, I love my video.  It came immediately, I was shocked!  It is everything thing that I was looking for!

B00AMBH70S|4.0|Not a bad action movie. I like Jeremy Renner so it was worth the watch. However, it does set up for more of these movies should these one bring in enough money and the lead agrees to sign on for more.

B008MZPUXW|4.0|Soft, soothing sound with 10 nice songs and one masterpiece(Wittgenstein's arm).  What I imagine Nick Drake(not quite up to Drake's  level of song writing) might have sounded like with better recorded sound.  Some tracks have outstanding double bass for audiophiles

B003VANOFY|1.0|I originally bought these so I could have freedom of motion when using voice recognition software. It is only marginally adequate for that purpose. The voice quality of this microphone is below subpar because it generates copious amounts of hiss, interference, clicking and warbling (like the sound of a hard drive spinning). You absolutely cannot use this device to record something like a podcast or PowerPoint narration, unless you intend to look unprofessional and embarrass yourself. And it's a shame because the clarity would otherwise be pretty good (although it seems the record volume only gets but so high no matter how high you set it).<br /><br />The software that comes with it seems impressive when you read what it does. It's not so impressive when you actually use it.<br /><br />The headphones, however, give excellent sound. If you're mostly using these to listen to things, you probably won't be disappointed.
B006IDG2T6|5.0|A lot fit into such a small book, this book has given me a new out look on everything. What if I went into the future and saw what I'd become? Could I Change it if I went back to the past... trippy
B00B2V66VS|3.0|I really like the game but I had unlocked everything and the it wouldn't let me get on even after I redownloaded it to my kindle fire.
B000GCFY0I|5.0|This was one of the best books ever & I can't wait to get the next book in the series!!!!!!
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this game a lot I have it on my 360 and its fun the current trending update is 1.2.3 which I love hardcore is a mode if which you die the world deletes.  I do not have it on my phone but I do on xbox and PC. but I played the demo of pocket edition and it was very very mega fun. so keep up the good work mojang and I have a question for mojang. when will you release 1.2.3 for xbox 360?!
B0037QM8YA|5.0|amazing movie. brought tears to my eyes its a very sad story, but very heart touching. I recommend this movie to all mothers and daughters.
B003O86FMW|5.0|For those of us that thought the movie covered the story in all three books, we were wrong! Easy to read and help Katness fight the fight!!
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|Great book for kids. But adults just kinda odd. It's a great book anyways. I really recommend this book. AWESOME.
B009FZFONO|5.0|This is easily one of the best television series of all time. The introduction of the governor and the plot that's currently unraveling is gripping, exciting and very much undead. I would highly recommend to anyone who can handle their gore and loves a good dystopian adventure where there's more than just zombies to be feared.
B005KQVDH8|5.0|Who doesn't love the Goonies? It's probably the greatest 80's adventure movie that's not only just for kids, but for adults and families as well! It never gets old! It's a movie that grows with the viewer, and is always entertaining to pop in any time.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book was an unexpected page-turner, I couldn't put it down. Initially what I thought would be an easy read about life in high school turned into a very compelling story about human nature. It was a very enjoyable read.
B00AQ71FLK|3.0|Thus is a great game, however gameloft is being unfair with the character vigelos. In ipad version, his arcane missles do more damage and they can slow down or stun. PLEASE FIX THIS ISSUE!!!!!
B009LT1YZ6|4.0|Well done but I will have to get the hang of it.. the game is pretty difficult but still fun to play ! Good thing it was free !!
B005COO1X6|5.0|This story was great. Classic Stephen King . It is the first story I read on my new Kindle. Thank you for a wonderful read.
B00A2H9LK6|2.0|Silent Hill: Revelation follows Heather Mason as her father is kidnapped and used as bait to lure her into the nightmarish town of Silent Hill. The story is a bit deeper, but I'll leave it at that for the sake of this review's length. Silent Hill: Revelation is a decent time-killer, but it's riddled with flaws.<br /><br />First, the story in Silent Hill: Revelation is mediocre. It doesn't exactly follow the story in Silent Hill 3, but does use some of its elements and characters. They changed certain parts of the story and they use most of the characters; they really nailed Heather's look, which is a plus. Considering I've played the game and watched the original movie and I still managed to get lost a bit and question my memory, I believe this film might be a little confusing for those with little to no experience with the franchise. Also, the film has poor screen direction, which negatively affects the story. One moment they'll be here, the next moment they'll be in an entirely different location, with little to no explanation; one thing that made the Silent Hill games great is the dreadful atmosphere and tension while exploring the creepy locations, unfortunately, this is absent in this film. It really skips most exploration, which leaves every scene feel like they're not connected. Also, when things look like they'll get heated and intense, like it would in a boss fight, the fights/chases end quickly and usually cheaply. And, finally, the ending leaves you with a big \\"WHAT?\\", whether you're a fan or not; (SPOILER: skip to the next paragraph if you're avoiding spoilers.) The finale is a battle between Pyramid Head and Claudia, something you'd expect in a movie like Star Wars or anything with sword fights, with blades clashing; and, this also has little explanation. (Pyramid Head's appearance in this film is questionable itself)<br /><br />However, the film's creepy monster design is great and I've always loved the transition from regular reality to the hellish Otherworld. The cinematography and most of the special effects were also great, although there were some special effects I disliked. For example, this film uses computer-generated blood, likely for the 3D effect, which looks very unnatural and hurts the immersion in the film, in my opinion; this problem isn't consistent, though, as I only noticed it occasionally. Fans of violent horror films might enjoy this gorefest; fans of jump-scares will also find a few effective scares here. The acting was good most of the time, although there are a couple of lines of dialogue that felt forced and a few that were just cheesy. Finally, I really enjoyed the several references to the series, including the guest appearances at the end, and I enjoyed the music.<br /><br />Overall, Silent Hill: Revelation has a few redeeming qualities including the haunting setting, mostly great special effects, and the video game references but the poor story, and terrible storytelling hurt the film significantly. On top of that, the film just doesn't feel like Silent Hill without the psychological approach and the haunting symbolism of the game; don't get me wrong, though, I didn't let the film's relation to this series affect my score, it's simply a mediocre movie overall. This is definitely a missed opportunity after the first film, which I really liked. If you're interested in watching this film, I suggest a rental after watching the original.<br /><br />Silent Hill: Revelation has strong violence and gore, some brief nudity.
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|i thought it was alot of fun.  wish there was more of the hidden object games.  it was a little short
B00AVPYT8I|2.0|I bought a Kindle, and It wouldn't work properly for me. Unable to do anything. Returned my kindle and got something else
B0053TMP24|5.0|make me angry. Rick Riordan is pretty amazing. I can't wait to get the mark of Athena. HURRY UP AND FINISH HOUSE OFHADES!!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is so amazing, I play this every day, it has different themes and characters for every theme, it's a must get!!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I really like temple run two. If you loved the first one you'll love temple run two! it has so much more obstacles! its great
B0066W1AZK|4.0|It's a good chess app. Cool sound/graphics and the a.I. difficulty will accommodate a wide range of players (I've played so many chess simulators that seem like you're either playing against a carnival-sideshow chess-playing chicken or a chess master.<br /><br />What I don't like is that it doesn't seem to know when to end the game in a draw. I've had games get to the point where there are only kings left on the board and the only way it will end is if you move your piece  between two squares over and over again. Conversely, it's also ended games on draws while there are clearly more moves to make for either side. The latter example being extremely frustrating, but it's also very rare. I've only had it end in premature draws a couple times.<br /><br />Overall I'd definitely recommend this app.
B0063IH60K|3.0|I enjoyed this game.  It's easy to play, but keeps my interest.  The cards look exactly like the real thing.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|Couldn't put it down, was falling asleep and dropping my kindle.  Would recommend it highly to all my friends and family.
B000QCQ8Y4|2.0|I did not like that Lee Child, speaking a Jack Reacher, criticized American military leadership and condoned desertion from the military.  Seems like the Brit in Child came out more than in his previous books.  I liked the first ten books but this one makes me inclined to discontinue supporting Lee Child.
0547569653|5.0|I cannot fully explain just how much I appreciate this book.  I can boldly say that it is, for me, life-changing, or at least outlook-altering.  I would recommend this book to anyone, especially any athlete or aspiring athlete.  It's not just about running, or eating, it's about life, it's about everything.  So Much appreciation to Scott for writing this book.  I even read the ending acknowledgements section (which I can say I've never done before) b/c I hung on to every word and didn't want the book to end.
B0028RXXE8|5.0|This is an awesome series that depicts the fall of Julius Ceasar & the rise of Octavian & Mark Antony's brash charm & his realtionship with Atia & later Cleopatra, but this one also focuses on two Roman soldiers who share an unlikely friendship, this of course has all the trappings of a nightime soap, but that is what makes it good & downright fun to watch, while taking place in a historical context, Ceasar, Antony, Atia, & Cleopatra are portrayed well & are accurate to the historical context given what we know about them from scripture, when you watch this, one thing becomes clear.....human nature HAS NOT CHANGED IN 2000 YEARS......you get political manueverings, outrageous sex, extra-marital affairs, two women who are lovers, rivalries between two women both power hungry, gang warfare, sex slave operations involving one of the Romans daughters, betrayals, & of course many battles, everyone embodies these characters, especially James Purfoy as Mark Antony, & Polly Walker(Patriot Games, Sliver) as Atia who has gotten more attractive with age, Cirian Hinds (the Russian president in &#34;The Sum of all Fears) is perfect as Ceasar, probably the best actor to ever play Ceaser, & even though only two seasons, everything is summed up nicely, it is a shame it didn't go a few more seasons, but I am sure that it was very expensive to produce, everything is authentic down to every last detail, it left me wanting more, however, I got more with &#34;Starz'&#34; own &#34;Spartucus&#34; which is a awesome companion to &#34;Rome&#34;, both are very much alike but are different in many ways too.....Highly Recommend this HBO series!!
B0087GZ8YW|3.0|I have read several of the Rebus books and generally like them. Whilst the plot differs, I find they are getting to be a bit more of the same so I may not bother with any future editions unless there are Reviews with strong recommendations.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game. My niece actually downloaded the game to play on my android. Now I can't get enough of it.
1451695195|5.0|Very good book.  I didn't want to put it down until I had finished it.<br />Would recommend it to everyone.
B00992CF6W|5.0|this game is awsome funny story tried to go to the nether and tried to add herobrine but didn't seem to work hopefully they add caves for 0.6.1. mojang has to step it up.REALLY!!!!
B004RJMUJO|5.0|This game seems innocent enough but it is not.  You cant help but play.  It is nice to have a game the children like playing that does not involve person on person violence.  Great game.
0316044695|5.0|This book is near and dear to my heart because I am active duty military and understand the sacrifices that were made by these heroes.  I could only hope to be as heroic if ever faced with that type of adversity.<br /> Marcus was part of a Navy Seal team that was deployed in June 2005 to capture or kill a notorious al Qaeda leader.  Less than 24 hours later, Marcus was the only one was still alive.  The book is not just a tale of the firefight that ensued; instead it focuses on the trust and willingness of those men to give their life to save one another.<br /> In the prologue, Marcus is traveling from house to house to visit and console the families of his fallen brothers-in-arms.  One of these was the family of fallen soldier Lieutenant Michael Murphy.  It did not take long for this book to bring tears to my eyes.  In one passage, Marcus writes, “She knew I had been the last person to see him alive.  And she stared up at me with a look of such profound sadness it damn near broke me in half and said quietly, thank you for coming” in which he replied “It is because of your son that I am standing here.” (Luttrell, Prologue 5)<br /> The book then goes on to tell of the intense training regiment that it takes to become a Navy Seal.  From a young age, Marcus seemed destined for this type of career.  Growing up in Texas, Marcus was always athletic and became friends with Billy Shelton, a former Green Beret, who trained local kids for Special Forces.  From grueling 12 mile runs while hauling concrete blocks, to hours of gym workouts, Billy helped to train Marcus for what would be the biggest challenge that he would ever face.<br /> The next couple of chapters tell the intense story of the gunfight that ensued between the Seal Team and the Taliban in the Hindu Kush in the mountains of Afghanistan.  As mentioned before, one of the many heroes in this book is Lieutenant Michael Murphy.  With his team taking on gunfire from all around and unable to make radio contactdue to the lack of a signal to his radio, Murphy made the ultimate sacrifice for his team.  Already shot once in the shoulder, he walked out into the open, in the middle of the gunfire, and called back to headquarters.  Marcus recalls him saying, “My men are taking heavy fire…we’re getting picked apart.  My guys are dying out here…we need help.” (Luttrell, p. 270-271)  Right after that, Murphy was shot again and this time he would not survive.  He sacrificed himself to get help for his team.  If that is not a hero, then I do not know what is.<br /> Marcus lost the rest of his team during this 24-hour firefight, including a rescue helicopter that was shot down by a rocket-propelled grenade (RPG).  Marcus was presumed dead by the media, even though the Navy never made any official announcement.  The family was gathered at their ranch in Texas, but his twin brother knew that he was still alive, saying “Goddamn it, I know he is not dead, if he was, I’d know.” (Luttrell, p. 310) In fact, Marcus had survived and was taken in by some local Pashtuns who defended him from the Taliban.  However, the Taliban fighters did track him down and interrogated him.  After being escorted from this village to safety, Marcus survives days of near death experiences.  U. S. Army Rangers finally rescued him, over a week after the operation had begun.<br /> In conclusion, this book is one that I could not put down once I started reading it.  From the heart-wrenching beginning to the account of the firefights, to the rescue at the end, it was one of the best books that I have ever read.
B009VSW15Y|3.0|The only reason I downloaded this app was because the Kindle Fire HD I purchased did not come with a working camera app already included.  I have not used it much it will not allow for skype which is why we wanted a camera app
B00A8ECU24|4.0|Because you can CREATE your own Ponyville but this is for kids. I am 8. This is good for 3-8. It was weird because it was 3D. Twilight Sparkle was CREAKY. But its fun:). It will never get boring. So, it's awesome.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This is a great game for the children.  Not like the violence you usually see in children's games.  makes wonderful use of the kindles touch features.  Fun for adults too,
B000JIHP88|5.0|I bought this when my baby was 2 months old. It was not really useful for him at that time because it will not lull him to sleep.<br />At around 9 months, he started enjoying the music and it helps him sleep. He also loves playing with it before he goes to sleep and when he wakes up.  He is able to stand up and turn on and off the music himself.  He enjoys looking at the mobile and enjoys &#34;talking&#34; to the animals.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game is fun and frustrating.  It is kind of addicting.  The puzzles definitely get harder as you progress.  And it is rather addicting
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is the best app ever.  but it pls put more item in the next update and sprinting. I reccomend this to<br />other people.
B0086700CM|4.0|My son plays this game and he says it is pretty addicting.  A fast paced game that allows you great opprotunity to play for hours
B003O86FMW|3.0|Engrossing though violent! I liked the creatively and the fantasy. I enjoyed the characters.  There are hero s to root l for and bad guys to be against.
B007D2XSW0|3.0|Again got this because the kindle fire hd we purchased did not come with a working camera app.  Why would something have a camera that you can not access.  This is a fun app but not really useful.
B006JPS1OM|2.0|Every time I get into the game I have to start from the beginning. It freezes on chapter 2. I played it one day for several chapters and it locked again. I guess I will have to play the game all the way through if I want to solve the mystery.
B00ADIT8U2|3.0|Overall the game is ok. i expected better. it was hard to pick things up the first time and i didnt know if they were even supposed to be picked up. i have played a few other puzzle games where there was a lot more give on sensitivity of picking up items. i actually found myself getting frustrated on this one ... i have not even finished the game and not sure if i am going to. nikola tesla was the man so i wanted to give this a try.. good intentions but not made well for certain platforms like a kindle...
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This is a lot of fun to play on the kindle..  (but will drive you crazy until you figure it out)
B00B2V66VS|5.0|A great game, need to watch what you are doing to meet the task, but fun to play. I recommend this game.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|When I saw the trailer for the movie, I knew I would have to read it before I saw it.<br />Safe Haven if different from the other predictable Nicholas Spark's books I have read. There were surprises and some mystery. While I could tell what the ending was going to be, I didn't realize what the journey would be to get there.<br />This book follows Katie, a quiet new girl with a dangerous past and Alex, the small town widower with 2 children. Katie befriends a mysterious neighbor of hers named Jo and a little later becomes friends with Alex. When Katie and Alex start falling for each other, secrets come out and problems start to occur. Katie's dangerous past may not just be in the past.<br />This book had a few major twists and turns.<br />I recommend this book for those who enjoy adult romance novels.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This was a good book that kept me interested throughout. Collins didn't drag out any parts and it was very well written. The characters were developed and the plot was excellent.
0345803493|5.0|We all know why these books got popular but that shouldn't be the only reason. Yes, that part is good but I like the way the characters interact with one another. The book made me laugh, had me on the edge of my seat, as well as other emotions. Great book and well written.
B009FZFONO|1.0|slipping into the dark nest.these stories of undead and the end of the world are junk.its hard to write anything about hopeless crap
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I think this is the best book of 3, the love that Anastasia has for his husband, Phoebe and Theodor! Its so beautiful!
B0000214F0|5.0|THOUGH THIS FILM IS VERY GRAPHIC,IT TAKES YOU BACK IN TIME TO THE DECADANCE OF ROME & GREECE AND YOU BECOME A PART OF LIFE AS IT COULD HAVE BEEN ,IF YOU DARED.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I cry in a lot of parts of the book. Its something I cant manage explain it! I just love the book
B000QCS8TW|5.0|Love the series on HBO.  It's a little difficult to keep all the characters straight so it's not a quick read. It's certainly worth the extra time.
B007NZDES0|5.0|This DVD is almost what I expected.  I had a chance to see Sade:  Bring Me Home Tour, and I really love it.  The DVD has been edited a little too much and you miss some of the best performances she did on the tour.
B0064MT1SA|5.0|I have watched this film on DVD many times, but the blu-ray is wonderful. The bright colors in Julie Taymor's film seem to jump out at you and the music by Lila Downs, a Mixteca Indian from Oaxaca, is magical. You can meet her in the special features. Her DVDs, CDs and MP3s are available here.<br />There are 206 plus reviews for this film, which shows the importance of a film that appeals to a specialized audience. Salma Hayak and Alfred Molina are outstanding as Frida Kahlo and Diego Rivera. Viva Mexico!
0425252868|5.0|I am in the middle of reading this book and  I love the story and the way the author's ability to tell the story. The photo's of the men is a great plus. It puts meaning into the story of who the soldiers were. I love the author and how he came about the stories he discovered. I wished I had been the one to have interviewed these soldiers. I love their stories and what great heroes they are to me.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|it is such an awesome game and so addicting. but also it is very good for the mind kind of like the kid version of Luminosity.
B00979CS50|3.0|I have just about everything Neil Young has done, so count me a big fan of the sound, lyrics, and overall feel. However, I've grown weary.  This music has nothing new to offer - it sounds like many Neil Young songs already released, meaning it has the same tempos and chords but with different words.  Let me comment further on a couple of songs. The first track goes on way too long. I'm usually quite pleased with long song lengths, but you have to do something interesting (e.g., jam with diversity like old Allman Brothers live cuts or make it epic with movements like progressive rock). This just repeats itself over and over.  That said, \\"Walk Like a Giant\\" - another epic-length track on the album - is a very good song, doing interesting things although having standard repetition. The second track is filled with over-produced effects. These might have worked at key moments in the song, but the whole thing is filtered through that with little real positive effect. Because I'm a fan overall and the music sounds like Neil Young, I'll give it three stars.
B005FITIDC|5.0|So impressed with this man's courage and commitment to serve.  &#34;When ye are in the service of our fellow man (woman), ye are in the service of your God.&#34;  or something like that. . . My son loved ths movie, too.
B00418NVLW|5.0|With a career spanning many years and projects, this album ranks as one of the best. The mood and energy are good, and the lyrics quite riveting as they usually are from this artist. If you're a long-time fan, this one will work for you, and if you're not, this might be a good introduction to the Nick Cave phenomenon since it is a little more accessible than some other albums.
B0083Z614S|5.0|Great book for a gardener...it gave a voice to how I feel about gardening.<br />Here are six more words for the review...just sayin'
B00005JKZV|4.0|this is better than the first movie because the saga continues and the action really heats up when the battles begin and the war starts and it seems hopeless when the fellowship is spread apart.
B0070Y46UY|3.0|As entertaining as it was disturbing, with some zoology in between. I would still like to know what the meerkats and carnivorous algae island were a metaphor for. Alas, I guess believing is not always about seeing.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|this game was great until the last couple of times. u will go to open it and then it will load for like five min. then it crashes!!!!!
B0041KKYCY|4.0|The only reason I gave it four stars is, because I thought there was more action in the first movie. Charlie H.
B000MRAAJM|5.0|Extremely wonderful series! Once I watched the first dvd I couldn't wait to watch the rest. Beautiful and informative. I would recommend this for the whole family.
B005Q1W0ZQ|5.0|I'd been hearing about how good this series was and watched the first season &#34;on demand.&#34;  However, in order to catch up before Season 3 started, I ordered Season 2 from Amazon.  It arrived quickly and we loved it.
B0083GQKQG|2.0|Its really weird but different at firsti was like heck yeah this is yon a be good then it started sucking
B008JFUMUQ|5.0|\\"A Good Day To Die Hard\\" is pretty good. This is how the story goes: Iconoclastic, take-no-prisoners cop John McClane for the first time finds himself on foreign soil after traveling to Moscow to help his wayward son Jack -- unaware that Jack is really a highly-trained CIA operative out to stop a nuclear weapons heist. With the Russian underworld in pursuit, and battling a countdown to war, the two McClanes discover their opposing methods make them unstoppable heroes.<br /><br />The cast led by Bruce Willis (as John McClane) & Jai Courtney (as Jack McClane) is pretty good. The directing by John Moore is pretty good. The story & screenplay by Skip Woods is pretty good.<br /><br />The music by Marco Beltrami is pretty good. The cinematography by Jonathan Sela is pretty good. The film editing by Dan Zimmerman is pretty good. The casting by Deborah Aquila & Tricia Wood is pretty good. The production design by Daniel T. Dorrance is pretty good. The art direction by Nick Blanche, Tom Brown, Bence Erdelyi & Andrew Munro is pretty good. The set decoration by Jille Azis & Zoltan Horvath is pretty good. The costume design by Bojana Nikitovic is pretty good. The special effects coordinated by Gerd Nefzer (also supervised the special effects), supervised by Nefzer, Uli Nefzer & Paul Stephenson is pretty good. The visual effects coordinated by Jennifer Duncan, Vanessa Joyce, Chelsea Kammeyer, Dave Kim, Nicholas Murphy, Kim Rampaul, Sharon Roberts, Jeff Winkle & Shanshan Xie, supervised by Ed Bruce, Everett Burrell, Eric D. Christensen, Sean Andrew Faden, Bryan Godwin, Randy Goux & Viktor Muller is pretty good. The stunts coordinated by Steve M. Davison & Mark Henson is pretty good.<br /><br />This is a pretty good sequel to the \\"Die Hard\\" series, it's not the best in the series, but it's a decently good entry that is decently entertaining and well-done. Bruce Willis is still as good as he was 25 years ago when he started playing the role of John McClane, the role that broke himinto movies, successfully. This is also a decently-good action movie.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|Love this season love that they brought back my favorite characters from last season amazing show. Love it a lot

B00A6PD9I4|3.0|Its disappointing for a Disney movie none of my kids liked it.  I miss Disney the way they used to make movies this one was not very good
B000001FN3|2.0|What I got and what they said I would get are not the same thing. The product description said &#34;here's the 1976 album and 1987 remix plus demos, unreleased &#34;experiments&#34; and more bonus material!&#34;. This is not true. It comes with the eleven tracks. That's it. I love the eleven, but where are the rest?
1451648537|5.0|Great book that will take you inside the mind of Steve Jobs and his attention to detail to the nth degree.  His genius was sometimes frustrating to his coworkers, but his desire was to &#34;change the world&#34;.  And, he did.
B003E8P9G0|5.0|I just finished The Red Pyramid on my kindle and ordered the Throne of Fire. If you are expecting books like Percy Jackson, you will be disappointed. However if you are looking for a different book, you won't be sorry. This book starts out slow and picks up speed. This series would be an amazing for a classroom project to complement Egyptian social studies.What a way to get kids fired up about reading!<br />  Carter and Sadie Kane embark on an adventure of a lifetime,that brings them closer together then they ever imagine. This experience will change their lives forever. I can't wait to get my Grandson opinion on this book. ENJOY!
B00005JMFQ|5.0|This is a quirky, funny and touching movie that we like to watch around Christmas time, as it has a little bit of a Christmas theme.  We saw it for the first time in 2011, and then in 2012 decided we liked it enough to purchase it so we would be able to watch at Christmas time.  The whole movie is based on love being everywhere. Just pure entertainment.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is so fun. I love challenging myself to earn more coins or beat my high score. You should deffinitly get this FREE game!! It rocks!
B00632HWOG|5.0|Have had Yahoo maifor quite a while and never have any problems using it. I would recommend it to evryone.  Works real well.
1452110581|3.0|I liked the concept and the sample pages, but found the product a bit much as a whole book, mostly due to the author's inability to resist trying to put a comic twist in the last couple of lines of most of the poems.  Something more deadpan would have pleased me more.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|it's fun for all ages just like the people in my family and it's kid of funny because the monkey's run after u
B001UV4XIS|5.0|Because I have followed Harry Potter from the beginning to the end and I hope there will be one about their kids.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|Great game for any time of day or night...  RELAXING.... keeps the mind sharp I hope there is another se&quot;QUELL&quot; on the way. I have the first quell also...  Will gladly buy ANOTHER version if given the chance!
B005LAIISA|4.0|I liked it but it wasn't like the previouse Ice Age the previous ones I really like and I watch them over and over again.
B008MM9630|5.0|Entertaining and fun. Very addictive<br />Has a decent wait time and plenty to do<br />Have fun playing and checking back often
B007K3JFUQ|5.0|This one is a little better then the other one, this was a little bit more suspense then the other ones
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is the best game I have on my kindle fire it's really good it is a lot for the kindle to handle but I've had my kindle for two months (I got this game the first day I got my kindle) and I've only had one glitch on this game it is a little different from the Xbox like you can't build portals to the nether or make roller coasters but it's still fun
B009S8PEHY|5.0|I love Rod and was excited to see him release this Christmas CD.  The solos and duets are great and it's a wonderful addition to my Christmas collection.
1442339586|5.0|The best book ever made (after the Holy bible). Just great!!! Im reading this every night, and i love it
B009LT1YZ6|5.0|Very zen like game with tilt controls.  Make sure you go thru the setup menu for the controls so you know how to control your fish.  I had to change it form&quot;flat&quot; start to&quot;tilted&quot;.  Worked flawlessly on my rooted Galaxy Nexus running 4.2.2
B009VYF5E2|5.0|Great story from old; well acted and well worth owning.  The humor is subtle when it is used in the telling.
B000UJCALI|3.0|I consider it a fraud to advertise a movie using the same name as the original when parts of the original movie have been removed.  Instead of being truthful the purchase turns into a game of how many minutes does it run. The purchaser is left to figure out exactly what scenes were deleted.<br /><br />In the original the cook is injured, but does not die. The cook and mother attend Danny's graduation.  These scenes are omitted.<br /><br />I am buying a disc of the original to be sure that i am not delusional.
B005NNV73S|4.0|As far as I'm concerned, this album is really about the \\"Atom Heart Mother Suite,\\" which on the original vinyl was their first long composition, clocking in around 23 minutes (one side of the vinyl recording) but with several distinct movements. The Suite includes elements that were untypical for progressive music at the time, such as horns and choruses, but has movements that are pure Pink Floyd, too. To me, it's magical, and still sounds great.<br /><br />What we called the second side contains \\"Fat Old Sun,\\" which also remains one of my favorite songs by PF, and a few lesser pieces including a soundscape called \\"Alan's Psychedelic Breakfast\\" which is worth hearing a couple of times, perhaps, but isn't musical and does not have lasting value to me (YMMV).<br /><br />Overall this album finds Pink Floyd developing a whole new sound for their middle period, which becomes the bridge between Syd Barrett's Pink Floyd (the first album, and to some extent the second) and Roger Waters' Pink Floyd (Dark Side of the Moon and later). It is overstating it, perhaps, to call them by the thought leader named as I have here, because in fact the other members make strong contributions, even if they did not always write the music.<br /><br />This album picks up from the experimental soundtrack to More with even more experimentation, which clearly was necessary to develop their new sound. I like the musical ideas that came from Syd Barrett's growing madness and the experimentation that went forward from his influence the best, which is to say everything through Meddle. Most Pink Floyd fans discovered them with Dark Side of the Moon and later, and probably consider that to be their best period; I think of it as their mainstream period. The main difference is that with Dark Side and on they were less experimental, and I missed the pioneer spirit as the band moved from psychedelic pop music to becoming another progressive pioneer.<br /><br />Wikipedia reports the following about this album: \\"Although commercially and critically successful on release, the band have expressed several negative opinions of the album in more recent years, particularly from Roger Waters and David Gilmour.\\"<br /><br />This comment surprises me, because the Suite is clearly the first of many lengthy compositions the band did in their career. It lays the groundwork for \\"Echoes\\" (from Meddle) and even \\"Shine On You Crazy Diamond\\".<br /><br />I know the album best from a high quality import of the vinyl that I bought in the 70s, and it is really refreshing to hear the pristine remaster with no clicks or surface noise, with somewhat better fidelity, too.<br /><br />It turns out that there is no cost advantage to buying this album as a whole, which means if you decided to buy just one or two pieces, that you could later buy the rest without spending any more money for the album as a whole. Amazon tends to charge more for longer pieces, so \\"Alan's Psychedelic Breakfast\\" is twice the price as a single selection, but in my opinion not worth paying for (YMMV).<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE: 4 stars (I Like It). I reserve 5 stars for the best albums that will stand the test of time. I don't think this album quite merits that, yet it is among my favorite by Pink Floyd.bum: \\"Although commercially and critically successful on release, the band have expressed several negative opinions of the album in more recent years, particularly from Roger Waters and David Gilmour.\\"<br /><br />This comment surprises me, because the Suite is clearly the first of many lengthy compositions the band did in their career.

B009UX2YAC|4.0|I say.this game is imtertaning for when I'm lying around wachting Tv alone and when I'm cleaning and stuff like that.
B004132HZS|5.0|The first season of this project was, in my view, a huge success.  No more are we treating Sherlock Holmes as a historical figure; instead we have him and Watson in a modern era, and Watson is a war vet (that's not spoiling anything).<br /><br />Somehow Sherlock as a quirky and brilliant modern man brings the stories to life better than the original writing and attempts to put that on the screen in its original form as period pieces.  Both lead characters have fascinating aspects to their personalities that you have to see to watch them unfold and develop, which is of course why I'm not saying what they are.  They also have to learn to like each other, or at least appreciate each other, as they learn to work together.  The story elements are modernized and 21st century technology plays a fascinating and important role in most episodes.<br /><br />Watch carefully to find other key characters transformed from the original story as they make their appearances.<br /><br />Generally I have been very impressed with the work of the BBC Cardiff (Wales), which has included the reimagined Doctor Who and its spinoff, Torchwood.  The latter two have been a bit uneven, mainly varying between great to merely good, but there is a lot of energy and imagination in all three programs we have watched.<br /><br />At the moment there are two seasons available on DVD and a third season is planned for TV, I think some time in 2013.
B0045HCJ6M|5.0|One of my favorite movies, I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys musicals.  I loved the story, and the characters..
B004QOB8SO|5.0|The second season of this project continues the unfinished ending of season one, bringing more excitement and danger all the way through, well, where this season ends.  Saying more would be spoiling it.  BBC has announced filming of season three, so we know it will continue and somehow resolve some unexpected plot events.<br /><br />I assume that if you're reading this review, you have probably seen season one and know that the show treats Sherlock Holmes as a modern figure; , and Watson is a recovering war vet (that's not spoiling anything).  We learned a lot about their character and personality in the first season, and as expected they remain true to their reimagined selves.<br /><br />The worst thing you could say is that this season is simply more of the same from last season.  Another way of looking at it is that the characters continue to develop but are consistent to who they were in the first season.  And the first season was terrific, so more of the same is, well, also terrific.  And some of the events are really shocking in this season.<br /><br />Generally I have been very impressed with the work of the BBC Cardiff (Wales), which has included the reimagined Doctor Who and its spinoff, Torchwood.  The latter two have been a bit uneven, mainly varying between great to merely good, but there is a lot of energy and imagination in all three programs we have watched.<br /><br />BBC has announced that a third season is planned for TV, I think some time in 2013.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Very entertaining! Good weekend reading. I really couldn't wait to see how the story would end. I hope they make it a movie!
B00756GRUE|5.0|I'm happy with my Seiko SSC017 solar dive watch.  I've had some other cheaper watches with a rotating bezel that either were too difficult to turn, or turned too easily making it easy to bump off of the setting.  This one works great, is nicely damped, easy to set but doesn't get bumped off of the setting too easily.  I use the bezel for timing things like food cooking on the BBQ or smoker, since the chronograph feature is more fiddley - you have to unscrew the buttons to use them then remember to screw them back down to maintain their water resistance, and can be pretty obscured if you are timing something for example at 5:30, so the hour and minute hands cover up the minute dial.<br /><br />I was able to adjust the watch strap myself, having already read reviews I knew to watch out for the tiny &#34;tube&#34; piece.  At first I didn't even see it, but fortunately had the watch over a clean surface to be able to find it.<br /><br />I've had a cheaper solar watch before, which the battery died on after only a couple of years so it wouldn't hold a charge, making it worthless, I hope this battery lasts longer than that.
1609611543|5.0|I was diagnosed yesterday with Celiac disease.  I have been sick for the last month . . . diarrhea, vomiting, not able to muster up enough energy to get out of bed, and an unbelievable wheat belly. I literally look 5 months pregnant!  I used to be a slim mint, only weighing 123 lbs.  I currently weight 150 lbs, and have been unable to budge the scales despite working out every day--forcing myself with no energy (and likely comprimising my immune system more).  When I started vomiting blood, I high-tailed it to my doctor's office.  I had all the symptoms of Ovarian Cancer.  Scared to death, had a CA-125 tumor marker test done, ultrasound, and extensive blood work (including thyroid) done.  Everything came back fine, but my thyroid test.  Doctor suspected immediately Celiac disease, and recommended immediately removing gluten from my diet.  Then, I found this book and a website wherein Dr. Davis writes people back via a blog.  I am so glad somebody, a doctor nonetheless, is FINALLY setting the record straight for once about wheat and not being trigger happy to prescribe a pill or two, only to make things worse.  Keep up the research, Dr. Davis, as the government and all these associations getting rich off of modifying wheat for the all mighty dollar will never, ever tell us the truth.  They will lose billions of dollars annually if they do.  Reminds me of the doctor who has unveiled THE FACT that the MMR vaccination given to OUR children is directly related to autism.  The government, doctors, and affiliates getting richer by literally killing their patients.  They all deserve an orange jumpsuit!
B000005JA8|5.0|I purchased this album for one reason and one reason only.  In 2003, Rolling Stone Magazine compiled a list of the 500 Greatest Albums.  I thought it would be interesting and fun to collect as many as I could.  Over the last ten years, I have acquitted myself very well toward that goal (even though RS came along later and revised the list).  I say all of this to make clear that I had no real knowledge of Captain Beefheart beyond seeing the album in music stores, and knowing he was an associate of Frank Zappa.<br /><br />Music can be approached from many different perspectives.  To the suits at the record companies, it's a business.  To the consumer, it's entertainment.  To some musicians, it's a living.  To other musicians, it's art.  This album I place in the art category.<br /><br />To me, the purpose of art is to evoke a strong reaction out of the person exposed to it.  By that standard this album succeeds brilliantly.  Hence the five stars.  I don't know much about art, but I know what I like.  And after at least four listenings to this album, I know I do not like it.  It's crap.  Yes, yes, I know; they rehearsed for months before they recorded it.  To me that time amounts to nothing more than turd polish.<br /><br />So there you have it.  This album sucked ass.<br /><br />Now to all of you Beef Fart cultists out there.  I've seen your comments attacking other reviewers who did not appreciate this album the way you did.  To you I say: Do your worst, butt-hurt fanboyz!  Tell me to go back to kazoo practice.  Berate me for showing my distaste for this off-key noise now that the man is dead.  Feel free to hurl as many silly insults as you please, if that makes you feel better.<br /><br />That will simply make me smile.
B0010SKUYM|5.0|This was an imersive, page turning story my husband and I could not put. Always love to find an author we enjoy. We will definitely be reading the rest of trilogy!
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Had I known I would be reading such a spectacular modern romance, I may have offered to pay double it's normal price point. While it bears the markings of the classic romance novel, the story itself goes far beyond the \\"boy meets girl, attraction, perhaps love followed quickly by a ridiculous misunderstanding or two, chapters of angst and the much awaited resolution\\" general formula of most romance novels.<br />The story of Carter...oops...Connor and Megan begins in Vegas the night before Megan is to participate in her slightly obnoxious cousin Gail' s wedding. Having been \\"outed\\" by her selfish and extremely obnoxious Mother regarding her plan  to have a child on her own via medical means...to EVERYONE attending the wedding, possibly everyone ever known to Megan...we find our very intelligent heroine in a casino drinking far too many white chocolate martinis to repress her urge to flee the battling bimbos who happen to be her co-bridesmaids...and happen to be battling through their giggles and insults...over her plan to be a mother via modern medicine.<br />And then she wakes up hungover...and married to Alpha male,Connor...with no memory of the main event.  And her new hubby has a plan which he happily lays at her feet.<br />I loved the honesty they shared, the heat and especially the humor.<br />My only complaint....no epilogue.<br />Downloaded it on impulse...free of charge, read it in less than  a day and quickly added it to my very short list of to be  read  again books...especially when I need a pick me up!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Not a book just for teens.  Great ending to a great trilogy.  Looking forward to other titles by this author.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is awesome, it  has high graphics and it has more adventures to explore!!!!!!you will love this game no matter what age you are ,5 or77 great game!!!!!!!!!

B002MQYOFW|3.0|Everyone seems to love this book and the series including my daughter.  We bought it for a school assignment.  I have not read it yet.  No probelms.
0199537151|5.0|This book was just what i needed for my class that required this it. thank you for this great book.
B005ONTD42|5.0|We love to entertain. At least twice a month we have a big party with all of our friends. During football season, entertainment was easy. Now that we are in the lull between football and baseball, I've had to get a little more creative. That's when I whip out our Sphero Robotic Ball. It really brings the party to life! First of all, most people have heard of it but never used one. So everyone wants a try. We'll also play games with it, which really gets people involved. I control it with my Android and people love seeing that too. Sphero, you are my favorite party toy- and the parties we throw have never been more fun!
0345803507|5.0|i wanted to finish this series but i didnt want to spend too much money on it because its expensive
B008KRJWEK|5.0|this game is awesome I like how its vary cool. I think the game would be better if you get too shoot the mutants not the game don't you think.
B000QCS8TW|4.0|A pretty good book. I think that I will like the next one even more. I wouldn't compare him to Tolkien quite yet but still a very good read.
B004XZ99LO|3.0|This was okay for a one time viewing but will proably not be watching it again. I was expecting more amazing artistic and acrobatic feats than what is delivered here.
0143034901|1.0|A few of us did not like this book.  I pushed through it, began skimming around half way through and it didn't make a whit of difference, so much superfluous writing in there.  It could easily be pared down to 300 pages -- where were the editors?  Finally made it to the last page, just because I was committed to do it, only to find a fairy tale ending of lollipops, sunshine and roses after 475+ pages of darkness, shadows, clouds, smoke and evil.  I felt the joke was on me as I finally closed the book for good, never to recommend it to anyone.
B001OSIV62|5.0|I think a very good story and film.  Watch it.  The incredible extremity of this feat begs the question, did God not make this man for this feat?  Or, as it was to Phiippe and his team, were the twin towers not made for Philippe?<br /><br />I took inspiration from his focus on a task that was at the same time a monomaniacal attraction and terrible peril to his life.  I mean, if there is ever some dangerous call to me and my life, I can say, it can be done.<br /><br />A very intense story.<br /><br />Robert
B0044XV3R8|4.0|Love the movie.  Wish I didn't have to change discs 1/2 way thru.  All of one movie should have been on one disc. 2nd movie all on one disc instead of both being 1/2 and 1/2
0823015017|5.0|The novice to the advanced artist would love and benefit from this beautiful, informative book. Gain color knowledge and be inspired, buy this book.
B003L77FYS|5.0|Best show on TV now. I love the characters, acting, and plots are ever changing. I now have all the season and look forward to receiving season 5 when available.
B00886XQO0|5.0|Awesomely awesome I tell you that they are awesome to the max. Awesomely awesome I tell you people. They are awesome
B0036EH3WK|5.0|Great collectors item, the blu-rays are perfect, extra and great short that shows hugo and ben off the island, great collectables and goodies included
B006NPOB3I|2.0|This was listed as a new product, when I got it in the mail and opened the package it was definitely not new. The disks were heavily scratched and I didn't even bother trying to play them, I just sent them back for a refund.
B004EPYZOO|5.0|also a very good story of a what hell would mean to one (although hell does not exist ) very good built lot of action and a surprising ending not the one you would expect.
B0001YRVN4|5.0|I grew up on Star Wars and always want to watch it again. With that said, the delivery was speedy, the price comparable, and the quality of the delivered product was good.
B000OVLBF8|5.0|a total new concept (the comic), so the idea was impressive although i never read the comic books i liked the concept very much
1616550414|4.0|This book goes into some detail to organize the histories of Hyrule. It is pretty good and at least touches on every game. I enjoyed it.
B0044C3RB4|3.0|Wasn't too pleased with season one , seemed lyke a reamake of  X-files then season 2 had elements of Torchwood.Am watching season 3 now liked the episode with cartooon charactors, give it a tumbs up.
B0018QQQK8|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. So much better than the movie! I am anxious to read many more by Nicholas Sparks.
B007KDFWRG|5.0|bought for a gift, my best friend loves it and so do I, saw Tedeschi/Trucks in concert last summer and this just brought it all back
B004EPYZP8|5.0|This movie is about a lawyer operates out of his Lincoln. At first it's all about the money. But then he realizes that his dad was right.
B00AGKH6D8|5.0|It is really cool to hear these musicians cranking away together.  This cd is the real thing.  Guitarists will love it.  Guitarist's wives?  Maybe not so much.  Turn it up loud and be part of the jam session.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|A story that is amazing,  full of unexpected unexpected twists, romance,and mystery.....  a fantastic story that leaves you wanting more...  but is also strangely satisfying as is.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|One of those books you can not seem to put down. Beautiful love story with an ending you would not expect.
B0027MJU00|5.0|This was another really good book. I loved how it switched between the present and past seamlessly. I read this book so fast as I just had to find out what happened. I would recommend this book to anyone and if you like mystery/suspense books I think that you would enjoy this.
0596805527|5.0|The second part of this book, Client-Side Javascript, helped answer many mysteries about why web pages behave differently in one browser than another and helped me to fix several bugs immediately.  In the month I've had the book, I have referred to it almost daily.  The separation of core Javascript and client-side Javascript has helped turn what appeared to be a black art into a relatively predictable science.  Thank you so much, David Flanagan!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I like any game that challenges you to think and gives your brain a workout. This game is really fun while also being very difficult at times and rewarding when you are able to figure it out.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I liked that there were surprises. The characters were true to themselves but forced to make horrible decisions. The end ties up all the plots.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This was the first book I ever read by Gillian Flynn and I loved it. I was so interestingly written, switching between the characters and the way that she was able to wrap everything up was really cool. I read this one really fast because I just couldn't put it down!
B000W7JWUA|5.0|It was missing the red roads but I called the company and I recieved the pieces in the mail just a week later. I was a little ticked off because it was a gift but they were very nice and completely understanding me being upset. The games are packed by hand and sometimes they leave pieces out. I still give them 5 stars because its a great game and they righted the wrong imediately and they made it easy. One phone call, no being put on hold, completely hassel free, besides having to call in the first place.
B000JMKTLO|5.0|After reading a few other books by Gillian Flynn I was pretty addicted to her stuff. I really enjoyed this book and all of her books. They are really well written and there always some element to them that leaves you wondering. I would recommend this book.
B009EEFTMC|4.0|Too many cubes have similar designs which leads to some frustration but adds to the challenge, so that's all good.<br /><br />4 stars because like others, I want to see my score after every game and want to see a record of these scores. Surely that can't be hard to fix in an upgrade! I accidently push the pause button 1-2 times per game.<br /><br />Ultimately, this is a fun game which leads to battles with family members playing on their devices as we try to finish first.
B002QBS9KE|5.0|Plantronics wants a whole lot more for these replacements and this is outstanding in price.  Great that I found you.
B0045HCJQW|5.0|I really like this.  All of the major stars doing their best acting.  Funny story with a few subtle twist and turns.<br />Add this to your collection.  You won't be sorry.
B000J1AGQI|5.0|I show this to my US History class during the Vietnam unit. It shows all sides of how the conflict affected all involved.
B000FCKGPC|5.0|If you can get the hang of reading one chapter about one character and then wait a while for another chapter that continues, you will find this enjoyable.  However, I was disappointed as I was hoping for some conclusion to this series.  While I like the story line, I feel the author was just stretching out the books for some weird reasons.  I still like the books in the series.
B00A0ABQLM|1.0|I recently bought the Surface Pro to replace my desktop and my HTPC. I had a USB 2.0 GigE Adapter that I had laying around that did not have enough bandwidth to stream my HD content (Bluray backups). This USB 3.0 adapter by Anker handled everything I threw at it! Transfer speeds in Windows 8 Pro x64 are well above 100MB/s downstream from my server (see image); upstream is over 90MB/s to the server. I would recommend this product if you are on the fence about purchasing it.<br /><br />To get the USB 3.0 connection working, I installed the latest drivers from the ASIX website and disconnected/reconnected the device to the tablet and the red LED illuminated indicating a successful USB 3.0 connection.<br /><br />Update 3/14/2013:<br />All of a sudden I am experiencing drops in transfer speed from 97MB/s down to a dismal 2.00MB/s when downloading from my file server. I tested downloads on both my laptop and desktop hard wired connections and get a consistent 75MB/s and 113MB/s downstream respectively, which tells me there is an issue with this adapter. Has anyone else experienced this issue?
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|This series has all of the great things you would like in a series.  This book series moves you along step by step and then throws in a wrench.  Great characters and great story.  Read the book as the movie can't get it all in.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|No regrets in buying or reading this book.<br /><br />Well written with enough mystery/fiction/sci-fi/history/love story to satisfy anyone.  I understand why the reviews are so high, and the reason I chose this book.  Here is another to add to the 5 stars.
B000FC1HBY|5.0|Martin continues his story with it's unique point of view.  Buy the series in one stop instead of each book.<br />The story line is well known and I will not repeat it for you.  More discripitive than it needs to be in some sections but the story moves.
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|After watching this movie on cable tv each time that I saw it was on, I decided to make the purchase.  I love, love, love this movie,  You bewitch me body and soul, and I love, I love, I love you.  Oh Mr Darcy ......
B000FBFN1U|5.0|I had hoped for an ending but not so.  However, this is a great story line with lots of twists and turns.  The author continues to switch characters with every chapter, but once you get use to it, it's fine.  Just wanted to warn you.  Also, buy the series at one time.
1401937519|2.0|I'm wondering what a Christian response would be for this book. Here's mine. While her NDE experience is similar to others that I've read - her conclusion to what happened to her is difficult to digest.  As a Christian I believe without doubt the power of unconditional love.  In fact, as a Christian we are mandated to walk in that love - and to overcome (by the power of God) those soulish emotions such as fear, because fear does indeed cause illness, as it did to the author - and also to myself at times.  Fear and despair lead to depression, often a hopeless state of depression causing great illness and often death.  But the author claims that this experience has only revealed to herself the 'god that is within her' (her magnificence she says) - and that the place she visited was a place that would ultimately lack any judgement by this god that she says she believes in.  In her opinion, everybody - even the bad bad guys - will ultimately get to this place of bliss because they just haven't been loved or experienced unconditional love.  Hmmmmm.  In my book of Holy Scriptures - there is only one way back to a relationship with God, and victory over sin, and that is through Jesus Christ, and those who reject this method of redemption (from Adamic sin) will indeed be judged.  Are fear and despair and depression sin?  Well, they are indeed powerful emotions that we inherit through Adamic sin and it is not my belief that there is some godlike power in us to deal with these things  nor is it really possible to exhibit unconditional love except through Christ.  Regardless of the lives we choose to live I believe this is an absolute and call Anita's experience a counterfeit. I also believe that we are experiencing the Last Days and if this be true - then there are many false prophets and teachers out there pulling souls into deception.  Satan also has power to do these things and we are even warned that evil spirits will also perform feats of miracles.  I guess you can see now that this is what I'm concluding about this NDE experience.  It's a counterfeit to the real thing through Christ and by the power of His Holy Spirit.  It leads one to 'self' when, as a Christian, our investment is made to the Kingdom of God - and in Christ. If an NDE experience doesn't lead one to the one true God, through Christ, then it has to be false.ow that this is what I'm concluding about this NDE experience.  It's a counterfeit to the real thing through Christ and by the power of His Holy Spirit.  It leads one to 'self' when, as a Christian, our investment is made to the Kingdom of God - and in Christ.

B0008ENICU|5.0|There is no comparison with any other remake.  This is a wonderful movie with excellent actors at their best.  The story is all female though you think that there are men present.  Some really unique takes at the beginning and the credits.  Don't fast forward through them or you will miss some interesting footage.<br />I rank this as one of my all time best.
B005LAII1C|5.0|Great movie and blue ray but at a lower price. Glad to have this one in my collection. Won't regret it.

B003TSEEDY|5.0|The perks of being a wallflower was the best book I have ever read. It seems very sad that Charlie was abused by his Aunt Hellenistic because I would have never thought that she would do that.sHe seemed so nice.

080701429X|5.0|Timeless and still inspiring, Victor Frankl boils down the stuff of life to its true essence and, in the end, still leaves the reader to find his or her own way.  I'm only sorry I didn't find this sooner.

B000EYK2GE|5.0|Carl Perkins was at ground zero in the beginning of rock and roll and rockabilly.  This 1985 live recording in front of a studio audience in London was first shown on cable TV and is masterful and celebrative in every way.  With his famous protégés, Ringo Starr, Eric Clapton, George Harrison, Dave Edmonds, and members of the Stray Cats on hand to play along with Roseanne Cash, the occasion is to help commemorate the thirty-year anniversary of the release of \\"Blue Suede Shoes.\\" Perkins is at his best here and in total command of the show. You can't be in a bad mood listening to the songs he wrote and played live like \\"Boppin' the Blues\\" (pure, unfettered rock and roll), \\"Match Box,\\" (Clapton's solo is dazzling), \\"Everybody Wants to Be My Baby\\" (reprised by the then reclusive Harrison), \\"Honey Don't\\" (Ringo doing a lively take on his \\"Beatles '65\\" album entry). Perkins also does a duet with Roseanne Cash of her father Johnny Cash and step-mother June Carter Cash's original song \\"Jackson.\\"  In addition, he plays standards of rock and roll and rockabilly made famous by his contemporary friends from the \\"million dollar quartet\\" club (Elvis Presley, Jerry Lee Lewis, Johnny Cash, and Roy Orbison) as if he owns those songs.  The surprise here is that Perkins holds his own and carries the show amongst all of these celebrated rock icons. You could get the DVD of this event, which is quite entertaining as well. I got the CD because when putting it on in my car while stuck in traffic, my drive does not bother me at all. In fact, this CD is always at the top of my pile on a road trip.  Listen for yourself.
B008CLI3TE|1.0|l bought this for my parents as a Xmas present. I was so disappointed to find that the could not watch past the first 10 minutes of the first episode even though it was brand new because it was so badly scratched. Needless to say, this is the first and last blu-ray I am ever purchasing from Amazon, ever.
0670026603|2.0|I struggled through this book. It was slow moving, skipped periods time, seemed to overkill some details and leave others completely out. I loved the idea of the book, but did not feel it was well written. Then ending was so sad but the author did bring all the pieces of the puzzle together at the end. I found myself praying things would turn out different even on the last sentence. I admit it. I cried.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|This book kind of confused me in the end, but I enjoyed it thoroughly. I can't wait to watch the movie.
0307743659|3.0|I'm just going to go straight into this one. The Shining is King's third novel and it's interesting because it shows that he kept getting better. The Shining is written on sort of a threshold. Some parts (and even chapters) are really good and others are downright bad. We all know the storyline: Jack Torrance is a recovering alcoholic with a history of abuse and over the winter takes his wife and psychic son up to an old hotel as caretaker. The malevolent forces of the hotel being to exploit Jack's old demons, drive him insane, and try to get him to kill his family and preferably, his son.<br /><br />The Good-<br /><br />Nice back stories, as always.<br />The characters are some of King's best, although Danny never really seems like a five year old as much as a twenty year old man<br />There are a few truly scary moments in the book<br />A couple of good lines<br />Descriptions are great<br />The isolation is well done<br />Overall good writing and that's to be expected by Stephen King<br /><br />The Bad (and this stuff really ways the novel down)-<br /><br />Silly and almost comical dialogue (mostly between Jack and Ullman)<br />The pacing is almost snail-like<br />The ending is just plain sappy<br />Plot holes galore (For example, if the overlook can open locked doors and let Jack out of the pantry, why can't it- 1. Unlock the door to the bathroom when Wendy locks herself in? 2. Release the boiler pressure itself? 3. Drop of chandelier or something on Danny and just kill him? They had months to do so but instead possess Jack. It makes no sense.<br />A few pointless characters but that's ok because plenty of other, much worse books have them.<br />The climax is very slasher-flickish and almost half of the horror in this book is non-subtle<br />THE HEDGE ANIMALS!!! (The scenes with them almost destroyed the book for me)<br />Surreal scenes that King obviously wrote when hocked up on drugs-A.E- The dogman scene<br /><br />In the end, I'd say it's mediocre. I always liked the movie more and the 1997 T.V miniseries (directed by King himself because he famously hated the Kubrick version) really shows the book's problems. It's a completely faithful adaptation and really illustrates the point that The Shining can only be done in a book and some scenes can't even be done there. I feel like it would have been a more successful novel (and trust me, it was really damn successful when it came out in 1977) had it been a lot more subtle. It focuses so much on supernatural events and it leads you to believe that Jack is nothing more than a puppet, which King probably had in mind. But I just can't accept that. And even if I could, the scenes with the hedge animals and the Miami cop and the dogman are just so ridiculous that they can never be done. I'm sorry for ripping The Shining apart but this is really what I thought the first time I read this book eight years ago. It was very mixed for me. I can't say it's bad but it isn't very good and it's by no means \\"the scariest novel ever written\\" as many proclaim it to be.<br /><br />Now if we were talking about Pet Sematary, it would be a very different story. (Literally!)
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book held my interest from start to finish!<br />I would recommend it to anyone as it has everything ---romance,adventure,and suspense.I can't wait to read the 2nd one.

0684865130|4.0|Entertaining, funny and extremely well written, Catch 22 lives up to its iconic title. Why did I wait so long to read it?
B0087JTAKW|5.0|If you like his other works, you will not be disappointed. As always, I have been left with something to think about long after I have read the last page.
B0095ZMMCK|2.0|Too many story lines, too many characters,  too slow. Complexities did not add to the read. Borrow from library instead of buying.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|I enjoyed this book very much.  It actually reads like a journal of someone who might have actually been stranded on Mars.  It's realistic with gritty down to earth language.  I find it amusing how some reviewers indicated they were disturbed by the language (maybe a handful of F-bombs).  However, the language was appropriate for the genre and there is no way to perfume one's imminent death on an inhospitable, barren planet.  Andy captures the irony, the humor, and the tedious nature of harsh living and survival.  Therefore, I highly recommend this book.
014241493X|5.0|John Green's books have an interesting feature: after you finished reading, you have it inside you forever. Paper Towns is probably my favourite of his books.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I carry my Kindle everywhere I go. And I hats to put my phone every time I need to calucate something. This app does it all. And it is so simple. Great job Guys!
B0001V6ZJ8|5.0|As a young lad in 1952 I watched this in the Joy Theater.<br />I managed to earn a theater ticket, a bag of popcorn, a candy bar, one ice cream and a soda pop.<br />That was my pay for sweeping out the theater, when the show was over and everyone went home.<br />Night after night that was my job.<br />Being a person who liked to draw faces, this movie stuck with me for many years. Then I found it.<br />As a dwarf Toulouse-Lautrec believes he's too ugly to ever fall in love, so he spends his time painting<br />show bills for the local follies. He meets a girl and falls in love, only to have his heart broken. But<br />will he be able to recognize the true love staring him in the face?<br />A must have for any movie collection.<br />Thank You<br />Great Product Great Service
B000UAFDP2|5.0|Awe man where to start with this one. The film is ultimate cheesy goodness. The plot, dialogue, and a few of the action scenes are goofy as hell and make it hard to take the movie seriously at times but then you get awesome alien killing action and the overall tone of the film feeling like a parody of modern war films. All of the war propaganda and the whole reasoning for the war seemed to share a lot of similarities despite the fact that these are alien bugs we are fighting. I suppose the message would be that war is war no matter who the enemy. Back to the cheesyness tho since this seems to be where the movie really gets it personallity. Spoiler time! Dizzies character constantly made me laugh. The way shes always trying to hard to get her man and making obviously jealous faces and denise richards. This was, well, cheesey and then when she passes you feel bad for her character but cant help but laugh at her passing words. Another part that had me constantly shaking my head was how each character &#34;coincidentaly&#34; continue to run into each other no matter where they go, its incredibly unbelievable but its easy to get over because in a money like this, it kind of fits. One other notworthy part would be the stupid football play they do where buddy does the funny looking flip over his oponents and then they decide to use it in combat, you all  know what part im talking about, its comedy.<br />Now going hand in hand with the cheesyness is the awesomeness, and by this i mean the battle scenes against the aliens. These scenes are incredibly gory to a point that its almost suprising and unexpected. I loved every inute of it.<br />Starship troopers is a badass sci fi, alien war movie that has to be seen to believe. Check it out.
0765325950|5.0|Ive enjoyed the entire series, and was not let down by this book. It was great. I'm sad to see it end. I want more. Robert Jordan's world is a masterpiece. I will always have a place in my heart for this series as one of the best fiction series ever.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love this game so much I also get coins it's not better then twilight my favorite game  is the awesome one
B00846REIS|4.0|I enjoyed the characters they had depth but the ending was abrupt. I assume to be continued. Hopefully  Gideon's past will be revealed.
1847879071|5.0|The book is in good shape. Author tries to write in informal and relate to reader, but a little annoying.
B009R5GR1K|5.0|This app has something for everyone who is interested in language. Excellent dictionary. Whatever mood you happen to be in, this will entertain and exercise your mind. I expect to use this app several times a day. Thank you and hats off to the developers.
B005LAJ16I|5.0|love it. homeland is so intense, and great performances by the two main actors, and great quality DVD. way better than online!
B009HV2JT8|2.0|I bought this movie after reading the book.  I know this is what everyone says, but the book is much better.  I am a history nut so although I did enjoy the movie, it was really cheesy, and something that I will only watch once.
B005LAIHGI|3.0|While THE DICTATOR certainly won't win any politically correct awards, it still has lots of laughs, admittedly offensive and crude, but you still can't help going along for the ride.<br />Sasha Baron Cohen gleefully cavorts through his role as the vile self-serving dictator of a fictitious Middle East country.  Blacks, Jews, gays, vegans....no group is spared.  The delightful Anna Faris is a perfect companion to Cohen, once again proving she's the queen of the spoofs!  Ben Kingsley seems to be having a great time and John C. Reilly has a dynamite cameo,<br />THE DICTATOR is one of those films you feel guilty laughing at, but there are some funny scenes to justify that guilt!
B0063IH60K|5.0|You will like it!  Much easier than looking for a table to play a simple and brain easy game. Try it..
B004J4WN0I|5.0|Sometimes you want that easy going action movie. The kind where there's  little bit of everything. That's what this book is to me. Something fun you want to get back to and see what's going to happen next without feeling so invested that you're angry it's over. Many people compare this series to Jim Butcher's Dresden Files, and it's a just comparison. It has many of the same elements but at least with this first book, this is a bit lighter of a read.  Would I recommend this book to other people?  Yeah.  Am I definitely reading the next one?  Oh yeah! Do I hope the next book and ones that follow are this good?  I hope so, cause this could be the beginning of another great series to curl up with or catch a few words while waiting for friends.
B0013TXA5Y|4.0|I thought it was an interesting story line, it made me want to read the series, excited to see the movie.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|This game is fantastic. Highly recommend. Worth every penny. Definately bends your mind and challenges your imagination. This is a game that's worth playing over and over again.
B00A9T1HUO|4.0|This cd I had to listen to several times to really decide where I would place it among my Josh CD's. I really in enjoy when Josh sings in other languages, and this cd doesn't have much of that, but as I became more familiar with the songs, I have to say I truly enjoy the songs all of them. Josh is growing and embracing that growth and change.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Everything you love about Nicholas Sparks, but with a surprise ending! Extremely suspenseful book that I refused to put down until I was finished. Those who avoid his books because of their endings might just be pleasantly surprised.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Perfectly written. I read the last 200 pages all in one day because I couldn't put it down!  Very descriptive, and paints an amazingly vivid picture of the raid on Bin Laden's compound.
B00AKOB7CG|4.0|I have several of the workouts in this series and love them for being able to get workouts worked into short periods of time.  I recommend these to anyone who struggles to get a workout in on a busy day.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|Addicting and fun. Good challenge with lots of easter eggs. If you like strategy games you will have enjoy this one.
B007THA4FI|3.0|I was looking forward to an &#34;Adult&#34; book written by this author. It was very hard to get into. Couldn't relate to very many of the characters, or division of the 2 town areas. The weathly against the impoverished. I really wanted to like it, as her Harry Potter books were so enjoyed by all age groups. Maybe I wasn't &#34;English&#34; enough to appreciate it.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|I got this game because I like leprechauns, but I started playing it and. Realized its a puzzle! I can control it easily by the buttons and I can collect pinecones to break the blocks. Smashing the golden blocks give you a clover life. Overall, it's a great game and I had no trouble installing it.

B001AQO3QA|5.0|These films have become part of the American Zeitgeist. And S. Weaver's character, Ripley, is a strong matriarchal figure. (with solid instincts) The 2nd film &#34;ALIENS&#34; is my favorite- which pits 'mother' against 'mother'.
0439023521|5.0|The Hunger Games is a wonderfully written story about first loves and survival. It takes you through the emotional ups and downs of any new relationship; like questioning the reality of the relationship, trying to sort out the emotions tied to the relationships and determining if the future of the relationship is plausible for both parties. We get to watch the teenage parties as they struggle with their emotions and do their best to cope with the formidable situation they are in. The audience can not help but to become attached to the main characters and the raw emotion Susan Collins portrays in her writing. Many times I would find myself rooting for them, cheering them on or dreading the dismal future that lay ahead of the main characters.<br /><br />  Collins does a wonderful job of painting a love story that developed under unusual circumstances. The readers are slowly led through the series of encounters between the two main characters and their struggles with the emotions they are feeling and the conflict of the situation. The love story alone is so involving that readers may find it virtually impossible to set the book down. Even after I forced myself to do so, I continually found myself daydreaming back to the story line in my everyday activities. Those of us that read ourselves to sleep will find it difficult to do so with this book. Every page draws you deeper and deeper into the adventure until you have been completely engulfed in the story. Even in pausing for a snack you will find yourself rushing through so you can read a little bit more. The story beckons you back again and again until it has been finished.<br /><br />  This strikingly odd combination of plots makes for an unforgettable adventure whose finale is so incredible you want to immediately search for the sequel. The reader is taken for quite an emotional ride through these pages. Just when you think you can predict the storyline, another twist arises and the reader finds that what they once \\"knew\\" was not what actually occurred after all. Collins does a wonderful job of tying murderous acts and simple acts of love together in a unique way that creates a most enticing story line. She does a wonderful job of providing proper closure to book one while also staging the scene for book two.<br /><br />  From page one to the end Collins does an excellent job of capturing the attention of the audience. As one twist begins to come to a close, a new one is introduced and we are again thrown for an emotional loop that almost requires us to read another 30 pages. The character development of the love story is written so smoothly it calls to its reader's personal experiences and adds to the almost hypnotic effect the adventure contains. I highly recommend this book to all readers and can not wait to see if the film has done the book justice. My best advice is to make sure that you have book two readily available even before you begin book one. You are definitely going to need it.knew\\" was not what actually occurred after all.

B00AGKH7K0|5.0|After hearing his music and distinctive voice in person this week in Los Angeles, I wondered why we have not heard more from him lately.  He is and will be considered one of the greatest influences in music.  This is a fabulous album for those who enjoy meaning to a song.

0545128285|5.0|I didn't pay much attention to this book when it first came out, but decided to buy it after recently watching &#34;Deathly Hallows&#34; (again). The tale of the three brothers that Hermione reads in the movie is very meaningful, and I was interested to read the rest of &#34;Beedle's&#34; tales. The book was inexpensive, in new condition, and arrived very quickly.

B008KOTNVA|5.0|I have never, ever purchased such a quality and complete set of bit drivers for such an outstanding price.  I bought these for the single triwing bit to replace the battery in my MacBook.  Do yourself a favor, bypass buying the single tri-wing screw driver for about 6 bucks and put in the extra 18 dollars for this set.  It has already paid for itself because Apple wanted $129 to change that battery and I purchased this set plus the batter for $90.

B008N1LL42|5.0|It's a better movie that you might think.  It's a very successful &#34;summer blockbuster&#34; three-star movie that gets five stars for execution.  As others have said the effects are spot on.  The main character is pretty flat, even with the attempt at making him three-dimensional - but it didn't really matter because it was plenty enough for us to root for him.  *** mini-spoilers ahead:  ***  As to the complaints about the aliens being &#34;dumb&#34;, one character notes more than once that it's as if they are Chris Columbus coming to America and we're the &#34;Indians&#34;.  So... think about it.  When the Europeans came to the Americas, they didn't try to kill everyone.  They came and if the native people were nice, other than disease, they left it alone more or less.  But if the natives were aggressive then they were attacked.  If you pay attention you'll notice the aliens don't shoot first.  I thought of it as the aliens were making some attempt at peaceful approach but fought to stay alive, and were individuals in that some were trigger happy and others were possibly pacifist and maybe don't agree with the alien invasion plans... maybe that's why... well you'll see.  *** end spoilers ***  Last note:  Don't miss the end of the credits.  ;-)

Amazon should require sellers to give complete pertinent information -- and the use of a microphone in grand opera is certainly pertinent,  Patricia F. Clothier
072252840X|3.0|This book is very difficult to read not because of the content or his perspective on men vs. women but because the writing is HORRIBLE. If I was the editor I would not have let this pass, I'm sorry if I was a 5th grade teacher I would not let this pass! Like others said he is overly repetitive (to the point of being painful to read), obviously is not creative or a good writer because he can't think of different ways to explain the same concept. While I don't disagree with most of his viewpoints on how to deal with the opposite gender (of course there are major generalizations so do read it with a grain of salt) I'm not sure I can continue reading it simply because of the writing

B0018LMZO4|1.0|I'm sure I would like this CD had their been anything recorded on it. But by the time I got around to listening to it, I was past the 30 day return window and it wasn't worth the cost of shipping to send it back.  This was the first time I ever received a blank music CD and I will certainly open and test immediately any I order from Amazon again.

B004K8WPUQ|5.0|I did not believe the battery door on this camera could be as terrible as other reviewers had mentioned - there's always those people who just won't be satisfied! But, in this case, I am forced to agree with them. I have a bloody finger to show for my efforts. I am just glad I did not try to do this in the field - or in cold weather!<br /><br />Otherwise, no complaints. The floating mic mount is stable and isolates the mic from the camera. Some people mentioned the flimsy cord. It is flimsy, but I suspect that's to further isolate the mic from your camera vibrations. (That is, a more substantial cord might carry more unwanted interference.)

1451626657|5.0|This uproarious satirical novel by Joseph Heller prompted me to think of Robert Crichton's 'The Secret Of Santa Vittoria', another novel blending WWII and comedy. Published in 1961, 'Catch-22' was the forerunner of Richard Hooker's 1968 novel, 'Mash: A Novel About Three Army Doctors'. It's not about Army Doctor's in Korea, but about Army Air Force pilots and bombardiers during WWII stationed on the small island of Pianosa, west of Italy. In order to understand the insanity of this story, the reader has to comprehend what Catch-22 means. In chapter five, Doc Daneeka explains to Yossarian ( main character ) and Orr, his roommate, why he can't ground them due to insanity: \\"There was only one catch and that was Catch-22, which specified that a concern for one's own safety in the face of dangers that were real and immediate was the process of a rational mind. Orr was crazy and could be grounded. All he had to do was ask; and as soon as he did, he would no longer be crazy and would have to fly more missions. Orr would be crazy to fly more missions and sane if he didn't, but if he was sane he had to fly them. If he flew them he was crazy and didn't have to; but if he didn't want to he was sane and had to. Yossarian was moved very deeply by the absolute simplicity of this clause of Catch-22 and let out a respectful whistle.\\"That's some catch, that catch-22,\\" he observed.\\"It's the best there is,\\" Doc Daneeka agreed.\\" This catch was why none of the bombing personnel were able to avoid flying mission after mission.<br /><br />The main character is Captain Yossarian, a bombardier who is convinced he is going to die on a mission. In chapter two, he explains to fellow officer, Clevinger why: \\"They're trying to kill me,\\" Yossarian told him calmly. \\"No one's trying to kill you,\\" Clevinger cried. \\"Then why are they shooting at me?\\" Yossarian asked. \\"They're shooting at everyone,\\" Clevinger answered. \\"They're trying to kill everyone.\\" \\"And what difference does that make?\\" Yossarian's fear of dying on a bombing raid was enhanced by his group commander, Colonel Cathcart. His lack of compassion was buoyed by his desire to be a general and more importantly, to be featured in 'The Saturday Evening Post'! If the Air Force wanted 40 missions before you could go home, the Colonel wanted 45. Every time someone came close to obtaining the target number of missions for being sent home, Colonel Cathcart raised the required number again. The Colonel is only one of the complex characters in this novel.<br /><br />I have many favorite characters and situations in this sometimes disturbing, but whimsical story. The first is Lt. Milo Minderbinder, the mess hall officer. From day one, he wheels and deals like no other war time entrepreneur. He gets away with his shenanigans by telling everyone that they have a share in his enterprises. In chapter 22, he explains his egg business: ...\\" I make a profit of three and a quarter cents an egg by selling them for four and a quarter cents an egg to the people in Malta I buy them from for seven cents an egg. Of course, I don't make the profit. The syndicate makes the profit. And everybody has a share.\\" He gets into so many businesses that he even deals with the Germans! In chapter 24, he takes a contract from the Germans to bomb his own base: \\"This time Milo had gone too far. Bombing his own men and planes was more than even the most phlegmatic observer could stomach, and it looked like the end for him...Milo was all washed up until he opened his books to the public and disclosed the tremendous profit he had made.\\" Then he says in the same chapter: \\"I'd like to see the government get out of war altogether and leave the whole field to private industry. \\"As the Milo character gets deeper into the book, it only gets more humorous.<br /><br />My second favorite is Major Major Major Major, the squadron commander, who looked like Henry Fonda! People who met him were always impressed by how unimpressive he was! In chapter nine,we learn: \\"With a little ingenuity and vision, he had made it all but impossible for anyone in the squadron to talk to him, which was just fine with everyone, he noticed, since no one wanted to talk to him anyway.\\" In chapter ten, we find that: \\"Major Major never sees anyone in his office while he's in his office.\\" But you can see him, if he is not in his office. If you try to barge into his tent, he goes out the window. I know it's confusing, but his first, middle and last name was Major, thus the four 'majors' when he got promoted to, you guessed it, Major.This book is a riot.<br /><br />My third favorite is Major-------de Coverley, Major Major Major Major's executive officer. Throughout the novel he has a blank for his first name. His function is uncertain at best. He basically pitches horseshoes all day, kidnaps Italian workers, and rents apartments for his men to use on rest leave. As soon as he hears of a city that the U.S.Army has captured, he's on his way there, usually at the head of the procession in a Jeep. No one ( friend, or foe ) knows who he is! But the reader knows that he is there just to rent apartments for his men. His picture appears in many publications, as if he is is leading the conquering army. I'm telling you this book is a gas.<br /><br />There are two subplots that are absolutely hysterical. The first involves the Chaplain's hostile assistant, Cpl. Whitcomb. The corporal comes up with the following generic condolence letter: \\"Dear Mrs., Mr., Miss, or Mr. And Mrs. Daneeka: Words cannot express the deep personal grief I experienced when your husband, son, father, or brother was killed, wounded, or reported missing in action.\\"This one was sent to Doc Daneeka's wife, even though the Doc wasn't dead. Col. Cathcart feels this letter will prove his concern for his men and finally get him in The Saturday Evening Post. He promotes Whitcomb to sergeant! The second subplot revolves around our hero, Yossarian. After Yossarian tells Lt. Nately's whore that Nately was killed in action, She tries to kill Yossarian and she relentlessly pursues him chapter, after chapter. Nobody knows why she wants to slay him, but it is funny.<br /><br />The reader will also meet: Chaplain Tappman, who is intimidated by everyone; Nurses Cramer and Duckett; Hungry Joe and his screaming nightmares; Chief White Halfoat, who knows he is going to die of pneumonia; Aarfy, the navigator; and Huple, the fifteen year old pilot, just to mention a few. How Joseph Heller kept track of all these characters is unbelievable.There is so much going on in this book that I had to take notes to remember who is who, and who did what.This is a great American classic and should be read by book lovers of all genres. The great American author Studs Terkel states in the `other voices' section of this book: \\"You will meet in this astonishing novel, certainly one of the most original in years, madmen of every rank: Major Major Major, on whose unwilling frame the gold leaf is pinned because of his unfortunate resemblance to Henry Fonda; Doc Daneeka, who is declared dead despite his high temperature; Hungry Joe and his fistfights with Huple's cat; ex-pfc Wintergreen, who has more power than almost anybody.\\" Enough said?we learn: \\"With a little ingenuity and vision, he had made it all but impossible for anyone in the squadron to talk to him, which was just fine with everyone, he noticed, since no one wanted to talk to him anyway.\\" In chapter ten, we find that: \\"Major Major never sees anyone in his office while he's in his office.\\" But you can see him, if he is not in his office.

B0063IH60K|1.0|Used to have this app on 1st gen Fire.  Tried to install on replacement fire but it won't install.  Just gives useless error message saying &quot;try again later.&quot; as if time of day is a factor.  Note to developers: if you are going to go to the trouble to produce error messages, at least make the effort to include meaningful information in it.  Glad I didn't pay for this.  It's priced correctly at $0.00.

B004GHNIRK|5.0|Les Miserables is a rich and layered book, filled with beauty and pain and joy and suffering. If you've seen the musical, you know the plot, but you don't really know the novel. The novel is a different creature entirely, though based on the same skeleton, and with similar themes. Who is Jean Valjean? No one would want to suffer as he did, but it is in suffering that a Jean Valjean is created. Suffering and the liberation effected by the love of God.<br /><br />The frustration of the novel is found in both the distance people in the 21st century have from Victor Hugo's world, and from his style of expressing his thoughts. The plot of Les Miserables seems to make up maybe half, or less than half, of its pages. The rest is Hugo - Hugo about he Battle of Waterloo, Hugo about convents, Hugo about Paris Sewers, Hugo about street urchins. Les Miserables seems to be half a dozen books compressed into one. But in the process, what emerges, is a masterpiece.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|A good read but rather short, I wish he could have expanded more in detail of his NDE.<br />The highlights for me were how science has excluded consciousness and how it will remain stagnant until it does so.
1419705849|3.0|I don't know what went wrong with book, either I am getting too old (I am 14 as of right now) for these or Jeff Kinney is getting lazy. For starters, the book seemed a little shorter then the previous titles. Basically Greg talks about his childhood, gets Rowley into student council, and tries to find a date to the Valentines Dance, and when he does it turns into the usual disaster. That is it. It wasn't like I didn't enjoy, I thought it was a very interesting concept. After all, in the first book Greg was writing about how girls confused him, and now it seems he is trying to go to the dance with one. The ending had a VERY surprising twist in it that makes me ponder the last 6 books. Yet when I closed the book I felt disappointed that it was so short. I am sure if you took out all of the giant illustrations the text would only amount to 20-80 pages. Even my 3rd grade brother finished it within a day. Buy it, its hilarious and ironic, but don't expect too much.
B009UNGYHG|5.0|at first a did not buy this when I bought my Voyager Legend.30.00 for a carrying case was a bit much but after a few days of trying to find a safe way to carry my blue tooth I decided since I loved my ear piece so much it was worth it. It turned out that not only is this a great way to store my ear piece I only have to remember to charge it once a week. My days are long and I use my blue tooth a lot. After 5 or 6 hours I just put the ear piece back into the case and it charges it. this a very handy product
B008DKBPTO|4.0|I like the fact that it covers my entire Kindle, not just a part of it. I can easily slip this into my purse and not worry about something getting inside the sleeve and scratching the device.

Thanks for a creating such an increasing and fun game. It was not too difficult, but just difficult as not to let you get bored.

B009GQ57ES|5.0|I was sucked in by Thrift Shop, but it probably the weakest song on the CD. This is one of the best I have heard in a LONG TIME. Excellent rhymes, great beats (turn up the bass). If you like rap of any kind, add this to your collection.
B00846F1YW|4.0|Good art work, easy to play. Although each puzzle ends with invite to post to Facebook or Twitter, you can click on the x at the upper right corner of the frame to close without doing either. Scenes are brightly lit, making it easier for me to find objects.
B004UG7RQ0|1.0|I thought I solved a big problem when I got this wire. It plugged into my customized car auxiliary cable, worked for about 5 days, then went dead. Nuff said. This is one of those small items, the exchange time, money, and energy of which would cost more than the item itself. It's more economical to just trash the wire and move on. But you all should know that CableJive DockBoss has some quality control issues.
B0091REZMW|4.0|Good free application. Never buy any coins.  I don't spend real money on virtual games.<br />Passes the time while waiting at the doctor and such.
B002RI9BH6|5.0|Regardless of the author's famousness, the book is very correlates with most people feelings which cannot be expressed precisely. In fact, even if the probability of some event is 0.01%, we feel that it is not impossible for this event to take place, but we believe, that we may neglect it. When the event occurred, we think that the model was wrong and we underestimate the real probability. Is it right? Even the probability theory says that there is a huge difference between the variate and the realization. We feel that if the probability is very small than there is some possibility for the event to occur, but still believe deterministically that it is only theory and in our real life there will no such event at all. So, this approach makes us to disregard  the outcome of such events (which may be huge and disastrous). All these problems are perfectly demonstrated and discussed in the book.<br /><br />Would like to recommend this book not only to top-managers/risk-managers and traders, but to all people who lives in the modern world. Because broad usage of financial instruments (such as loans, deposits, pension schemes and etc.) creates an exposure from probabilistic universe often with unknown type.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I started with the first book about Holston as a free book and I got hooked.  I told my husband and kids (ages 9 and 13)  that I think they would all enjoy reading this book.

B008X9Z37A|4.0|I've had several Belkin cases for my electronics in the past and while they're never the top-of-the-line in quality, I've always been satisfied. This Kindle Fire HD case is about as good as expected. The colors are classic and attractive, the materials are high quality (but nothing spectacular)and the general feel is comfortable.<br /><br />Some major PROS include the extremely firm, textured outer casing which is satisfying to the finger tips and easy to grip. The inner texture is very velvety and a little awkward-feeling to touch, however.<br /><br />My biggest con is the corner tabs, which do \\"lock\\" the Fire into place, but are kinda flimsy and ugly, at least compared to the official Amazon case. Certainly they do the trick for keeping your Fire safe, but.. for those who are particular about looks, you might be slightly disappointed.<br /><br />Ordinarily I would say go for it, save a few bucks and get the \\"bargain\\" brand case that's just as good as Amazon's official lineup. However, this time, I really have to say that Amazon blew the competition out of the water. These [[ASIN:B008GGH4FY Amazon Kindle Fire HD 7\\" Standing Leather Cases]] are of such outstanding quality that there is no competition. The snug fit, the comfy feel - Amazon perfected it and truly made every other model out there a low-grade imitation. Considering that the price of Belkin's is only about $20 or so cheaper, I would recommend going for the official case. It's expensive, but so worth it.<br /><br />Still, overall, I cannot complain. The sturdy craftsmanship is better than expected and the overall quality is very good. Not the best on the market, but certainly does its purpose, which is to protect your Kindle Fire and make using it more convenient. I won't be switching from my Amazon case, but I'm still satisfied.
B008X9Z37A|4.0|This item suits its purpose, I wish it had a closure or a pocket. But it is worth what i paid for it. Would purchase again.
B008US4PBY|1.0|I have been trying to get this device to work for a month now to no avail. Every time it's connected it flashes an error code that specifies \\"contact support\\".

B008C0C1Y8|5.0|So many people who don't get what this picture was and is all about.  It's an adaptation of a British Comic book at a time when the comic adaptation was looked upon as a step down for a star of Stallone's stature (go figure - now they're a career maker!).  Stallone paid the price with the critics for his choice but the audiences loved it.  It's got it all and as for those who say it steals from everybody else well they might wanna check their chronology again because it did a lot things first!  It's great action entertainment and tho Stallone's stoicism was tailor made for this role he gives it his all as always.  The sets and special effects hold up magnificently and the action flows like fine wine.  Looking for a slam bang evening?  Then look no further.  Just remember what I said...if this were made today...it would star Slater or Gordon-Levitt and would get much more respect than it's even getting here in misguided reviews.  Think fun.  Think action.  Think enjoyment.  Because that's what this movie has got to offer up in spades.
B006LSZECO|3.0|Slow beginning...fantastic middle...let-down ending. I couldn't put it more simply or straightforward than that. Sorry to say, I'm just left feeling unfulfilled by the whole thing...

0374532281|5.0|Excellent. I have actually seen the movie and I immediately wanted to read the book. The book is much better, you understand better how Pat feels, his mother has a much stronger character and the end is not as \\"happily ever after\\" as the movie, which makes it more realistic to me. Mental illness is extremely difficult and reading the book made me realise how much the surroundings affect the ill people. I loved it!!

0765325950|1.0|Wow.......disjointed writing.....I had to read it since I had already invested in the first 11, and thoroughly enjoyed those......#12 was pretty close to Robert Jordan's writing style.....probably because he had a good portion of it written....#13 diverged toward the new writer's style, but still made an attempt to stick true to Robert Jordan.... #14 appeard to be written just to get it done.....the writer may not have been totally into the book?  What a waste of time.

B005LAIH3G|5.0|Neat story, beautiful girl, exotic surrounding evil immortals with bad habits what's not to like.  I enjoyed it so much that I read the Edgar Rice Boroughs source material.  This suffers because you've seen a lot the effects elsewhere.  I think that it might be more fun to read the books (there are five stories - short pulp fiction - $.99 for all five on your Kindle ) then see the movie.  The Martian Princess, Deja Thoris (Lynn Collins) is quite striking with dazzling blue(violet?) eyes in a red and tatto'd face probably all done with the computer but still a sweet heart and not a shrinking violet with a sword in her own right.  John (Taylor Kitsch) I think is a pretty good leading man although between this and Battleship he's probably selling burgers and fry's on Hollywood Blvd.  If Kitsch is a stage name it's a poor pick (Means junk in German)
B005LAIHPY|5.0|My dad took me to see this movie on his day and I love it. So any looking for an action movie this is a great one.
B005LAIGWS|3.0|This ain't no National Treasure.  Supernatural anti hero and flaming skull who'd have thunk it.  Actually Nicolas is a bit over exposed and needs to back off and take a vacation.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I love that I can read my kindle books on this app on my new tablet! Awesome app and easy to use.
B004XQO90E|4.0|Unusual story, happy ending, Jake Gyllenhaal is both sympathetic and believable in this role  I've watched it several times.  Michelle Monaghan as his handler/controller is also believable. Better movie than you might think.
B0084BMUFA|5.0|Always enjoy reading this at the holidays, puts me in the spirit.  Having such easy access to classics is probably one of my favorite parts of owning my Kindle.
B00A0SQBDM|4.0|If you like hidden object games this one at least has a plot.  Art work is very pretty, Map feature makes this an easy one to work around.  Typical bizarre plot about the ghost of a pirate that kidnaps a young girl  to substitute for his long lost and ghostly lost love.  The player is the girls mother and you have to rescue her.  There is an extension to the game to get home.  Inexpensive good first or second game to get used to the Kindle or if you're just a fanatic for hidden object games.
B0075MFS9Y|5.0|This album is it. Ordered this album with fun some nights album. Was expecting for some nights to be better but I find my self playing this album way more than some nights. Favorites are submarines, stubborn. Love, and parade.
0446554995|5.0|There is nothing about this that does not suggest more ongoing adventures of Agent Pendergast.  Nothing detailed won't be a spoiler but as usual poor D'Agusta gets into trouble with his boss.  Corrie Jackson from Still Life with Crows makes an appearance.  Constance Green and her psychiatrist have some time and it is clear that Constance's son is not dead.  Has the feel of a transition book cleaning up old issues before thrusting Pendergast toward an new case load.  Includes a coven of Nazis in Brazil what could be more fun.  Probably not the greatest of these books but lots going on.
B005LAIGZU|5.0|The acting is lacking, but what do you expect from active duty Navy Seals??  Great Action and an excellent story.  Enjoy!
B005LAIHZE|4.0|Ok it's just for fun.  I enjoyed the pretext of the great emancipator going around chopping up vampires but I like vampire stories.
B003719G40|5.0|Absolutely loved this insightful book of love. Can't wait to share this with my close friends and family! Definitely will recommend!
B004LWZW88|4.0|More from the Shrek team the kids'll like it.  Just enough between the lines to keep adults entertained.  Not an academy award winner but enjoyable.  Watched it with a couple different kids to good reviews
B00A8ECU24|4.0|got the game for my 3 year old but now I play it! the mini games are great for a small child but the main part of the game is more complex.
B007L6VR6M|3.0|I found it watchable but it's been a while and I don't feel compelled to throw it into the Blue Ray player
B009GXHOW4|5.0|great app but 0.6.1 just came out and waiting for it to update. Also I was playing multiplayer with my sister and her inventory cleared when she rejoined, and when I quit my inventory didn't update when I cleared it
B001KVZ6HK|4.0|I've got the two Ironman movies and Thor and the Captain America - OK I am a comic book junkie.  This works well - Robert Downy Jr. who's a power house as an actor compared to the rest of the cast manages to just do his part and doesn't overpower the rest of the cast - which I think is to his credit.  It's a good ensemble piece as intended great special effects.  Watched it several times
B00AVTMCYW|5.0|The movie reminded me of the good old 80's flicks. Great movie in every way. Never read the book, and judging by the negative nancies on this site who have it is a good thing.
B007K3JCAE|5.0|Downy and Jude Law are a wonderful pairing as Holmes and Watson.  Killed off Irene Addler (Rachel Adams) too soon she was a very good foil for Holmes.  The casting of these is really masterful I hope that the studio can coax these folks together again.  Probably killed off Moriarty too soon
B008FRJ1IW|3.0|This product was received exactly in the same manner it was sold. I would definitely say that  I was happy when it arrived. I bought this to complete a collection. I like Lego products and continue to impressed T he &#34; no-frills&#34; packaging!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|An absolutely great series.  I love Downton Abbey.  It is a Masterpiece.  I look forward to each and every episode.
B0055QYKQO|5.0|This motherboard is good, have good price and the quality is so good. I bought this to my pc gamer, and it has all that I want to have in my pc. The color is black, so look so good if you have a chassis black.<br />It looks great with red, I recommend this motherboard... no problems, all is good.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|An absolutely great series.  I love Downton Abbey.  It is a Masterpiece.  I look forward to each and every episode.
B008QZ1ZYQ|4.0|This is a great game.  I played several levels and then have since uninstalled it.  But it was very good and ramping up the level of challenge, start easy and get harder.  Kept my interest, but not really for my kids, at the time 2, 4, 6.  The 6 year old did the best, but not really his style.
B009E3EWPI|5.0|I  was lucky enough to see Led Zeppelin in the height of their &#34;Heaviness&#34; in the 70's at &#34;The Garden&#34; N.Y.C. Of course they were wonderful ! I can still see Robert Plants' golden curls in the stage lights,and Jimmy Pages' sequins on his jacket,and pants reflected in the stage lights ! Now I can relive it all again (although, not the 70's,and not N.Y.C.) here they are with the exception of John Bonham (but,his son does him proud) ! I love this set ! Buy it you won't be disappointed.I do think the extra rehearsal dvd is not needed,it's filmed so far from the stage,you really just hear them,but not good visually.
0393317552|5.0|Such an amazing book.  Diamond is exquisite at traversing 13,000 years of human history and hitting every major aspect of development until the present age, all the while keeping the reader throughly enthralled and wanting to learn more and more as the book goes on.  A superb work which I highly recommend to anyone with an interest in humanity, development or a curiosity into how and why the West seems to dominate the world, while \\"the rest\\" wallow in suffering.  In this book, you'll find the reasons are not what you grew up with, it was merely a result of natural forces collaescing and culminating together at the right place and time which allowed the dominance of the last 500 years of a group of people, and it could easily have happened in the opposite direction had fortune favored others.<br /><br />Highly recommended!
B00A0MJ9ZA|5.0|I have loved the story of Peter Pan since I was a very young girl,now I'm not so young anymore (only in my heart),so when this came out again I had to have it ! It's so beautifully drawn and filmed (when Disney had the best artists,and no computer imagery). I bought a copy for each of my adult sons.I know it's hard not to grow up,but,this movie reminds me of the magic of being a child again !
B0061QD88S|5.0|How could you rate Lady and the Tramp anything less then 5 stars?  Fantasic movie for the entire family. You can't go wrong with this one.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is the best game ever it is really fun and easy but not like baby easy like teen easy
B0010SEMP0|5.0|I really like this series. This is #2, and I can't wait to read #3. Bones is a super vamp hero.
B00B99KJR0|5.0|Very good graphics and story, one of the best match 3 games. The levels are challenging without being impossible. Great game.
B0076DCT2G|3.0|The book started off great but slowed down drastically , to much detail in the middle with little to no action. The ending was a little anticlimactic. Not Nelson' s best book.
B00ATSBIIG|4.0|I love the artistry and it's very relaxing. Plus I'm a quilter so the piecing is fun. But there is no Sound!!!!!!
1475143389|1.0|Fist four chapters are solely defining terms. A lot of utterly basic information. Why and how is this book praised so heavily, I don't understand.
B000SEGEKI|5.0|I found each tip to ring true with what my 17 years of programming experience has taught me.  A good review for the &#34;grey beards&#34;, and a &#34;must read&#34; for anyone starting to learn how to program.
B004SD5GZ4|1.0|I attempted  time after time after time to get it on my Kindle.  Couldn't do it. It down loaded but never actually worked.
B00846F1YW|4.0|Just started playing, on level 4 now.  Enjoying the game,  exercising my mind feels good.  Thank you for allowing me the opportunity to play this game.
B0063GORYU|5.0|It's the classic Spider bit in the palm of my hand! I love it for long waits and it keeps me challenged and alert!
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Not bad reading, one of the better books. There's sure to be more to the story than this. Worth the read.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|This story is unique and touching.  I really enjoyed reading the story from the perspective of the dog.  I think the author has a lot to say about human interaction and the human condition, and it was a story I quickly became interested in.
B009XTF8KQ|3.0|This wasn't a bad movie, made better by the ability to pre-order it. I was a little disappointed with it after the hype the previews made. It was defiantly made creepier by the fact that the possessed was a little girl. Stuff with kids getting possessed is always a little creepier in my book. Overall though, it's a rental at best. Unless you're hardcore into possession movies, I'd recommend renting it from iTunes or some other rental place.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Really enjoyed following the characters (families/offspring) from book one encased in historical facts and locations.<br /><br />Eagerly waiting book three!  Keep plugging away, Ken.
0887306667|4.0|This book was recommended to me by a branding expert I am workign with for my own company. It offers 22 easy quick to read laws for marketing. Some key messages were to  be first, if you are the first to launch something you will be and remain number 1, however you can gain traction by adding something to the products/services of number 1 that they don't have. Law 13, The Law of Sacrifice resonated with me, sometimes to be authentic to your brand and produce great results you have to narrow what you have to offer, stand on your dime and go a mile deep vs miles wide. A great book for all business owners.
B008M87GJK|5.0|This is my favorite news app. The way the news stories are laid out is visually appealing and you are able to add and delete news categories easily.
B002E01LL6|4.0|The whole plot is to follow the perceived manipulations of a young man, desperate to do more with his life, so he fights for money. His handler is slick and seemingly nothing but greedy, but shows a caring spot for his &#34;mark&#34;, the fighter.  But, in the end, the young man everyone thought was being used cause he was inept, came out the winner and achieved what he wanted - a better life without the violence.
B003DZX44I|5.0|I love this product! Everything came and played perfectly! Came in 2 days! Perfect sound and audio! Affordable price! (I got it when the item was $31.99) Recommend buying!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|After reading the Hunger Games I was captivated.  I have never read three books so quickly.  In the story, always surprised by what happened next.  I loved the character's, Katniss, Gale, Peeta, and Haymitch.  The ending as it should be!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Love! Love! Love! this show from England!  I have watched the first 2 seasons at least 10 times each and this season did not disappoint!  I don't know anyone who doesn't like this show.
B000N4SHOE|4.0|I am probably the very last person who has ever been interested in children's books.  Amazon Instant Video provided something to watch on a empty Saturday night, and I stumbled across this film about Beatrix Potter.  Of course, the name \\"Peter Rabbit\\" is recognized worldwide, but I knew nothing about the author behind the successful children's stories.  It's apparent that I've missed much in the area of children's literature!<br /><br />Being 32 and single in 1902 wins her the name of \\"spinster,\\" until Beatrix meets the man she falls in love with.  Played by Ewan McGregor, Norman Warne, is her first love who is in the family publishing business and works closely with her on her various releases.  They become engaged, but her family vehemently forbids the match due to the usual class system between the upper class and working tradesmen.  Nevertheless, Beatrix by now has become a self-supporting, rich woman from her royalties and spurns her parents' advice.  Unfortunately, her beau sadly passes away before they can marry.<br /><br />The story continues with her bid for freedom from her parents' domination, and she relocates to the Lake District where she buys a farm, and neighboring farms, to keep them protected from development.  Another love interest enters her life, and once again she finally finds happiness as she continues to pen her children stories throughout the remainder of her life.<br /><br />Nevertheless, it was an enjoyable film, with a sprinkle of fantasy.  The filmmaker allows her endearing animal characters to come alive on her pages  as she draws them.  She calls them her \\"friends\\" who are the only ones who really know and understand Beatrix Potter.  Though it seems odd that an artist/author should see her characters come to life on a page, I can attest from the muddled mind of my own stories, characters do tend to have a life of their own.<br /><br />With all that being said, I must confess that I thought the movie was horribly miscast. As much as I love Renee Zellweger in other roles, she makes a terrible English woman...no offense Renee.  She is quite toned down and a bit dowdy in appearance, but she has a horrible habit of facial expressions that look just plain painful and unnatural.  Picture a face after eating a sour pickle and that's Renee as Miss Potter. As far as the other performers, I had no qualms, but Renee really did nothing for me in the role.  It appears, though, that Renee was also one of the Executive Producers of the film, which probably is why she played the part that should have been given to another.<br /><br />All in all it was entertaining, informative, and cute.  As an author myself, I'm always intrigued about stories of authors and the creative gifts and expressions that guide their lives.<br /><br />If you're curious about the creator of Peter the Rabbit, it's worth the watch. The scenery isn't bad either.love Renee Zellweger in other roles, she makes a terrible English woman...no offense Renee.

B004J4WNL2|5.0|im an extrovert and i really enjoyed this book. provides a lot of good research, personal examples and just great insight into the minds of both introverts and extroverts. it also discusses this with respect to romantic relationships and raising children which i found valuable. highly recommend.
B007XKEY6Q|3.0|This games very bad for the people who don't have a Facebook. You can not play unless you have someone to play with. Anyways it's pretty fun.
B001BKVWYG|5.0|I listened to this many times in the past but had all but forgotten it. With the recent publicity around the 'Searching for Sugarman' documentary, I was reminded of Rodriguez, especially this, his amazing debut, so it was great to find it at Amazon.

B007SGLZP8|5.0|I've long been a fan of John Grisham. Like his other novels, The Racketeer was full of  suspense and surprises especially at the end.
B000FC2KL0|5.0|Thank you Anthony Kiedis for your brutal honesty in sharing your life story with the world. A true insight into the workings of warped mind and life experience. So often I saw myself in your tales. Life is a crooked road with winding paths. What an incredible roller coaster ride living life can be!
0525953728|5.0|\\"No Easy Day\\" stirred up a tremendous amount of controversy regarding the possibility of releasing classified information.  It is obvious that the author has taken this into account while writing this, since he releases enough information to place you in the mission, but not enough details to compromise national security.  He does a fantastic job telling his story as an up and coming Navy Seal, all the way up to the day his team brought down the tyrant who has haunted our country for over a decade, Osama Bin Laden.<br /><br /> Like many of other books on the special operations community, Mark Owen tells his story from the beginning.  The structure of the book immediately draws you in.  Right out of the gate, the prologue drops you in the assault, just as the teams began to hit Osama Bin Laden's compound.  This tactic turns this book into one of those books you can't put down.  You are wanting to get to the goodies of the assault...then \\"BAM\\", you are slammed right into his infant stages of Green Team, the nine month selection process in place to ensure the Naval Special Warfare Development Group (DEVGRU) receives the best operators of the crop.  This keeps you going, wondering if the next chapter will be the chapter.  Let's face it, the only reason you are reading this book is because you want to know how the teams took the life of a man that has damaged the life's of so many American families as well as catapulting our nation into the \\"War on Terrorism\\".<br /><br />By him starting at his infancy of becoming a Navy Seal, this allows the reader to walk through his life, to understand how much goes into becoming a member of DEVGRU.  You don't finish Basic Underwater Demolition School (BUDS) and just become a full fledge Navy Seal.  This career path and prestigious qualification is tiered for a reason.  You are selected for teams conducting higher profile missions based on your experience, knowledge, and mental preparedness. He walks you through his early years as an operator, and as a member of DEVGRU.  DEVGRU is the pinnacle of being a Navy Seal, and making it to this team puts you in a small circle of professional operators. Using this structure allows him to build on his creditability, embodying the \\"silent or quiet professional\\" mentality, to help the reader truly understand the professionals that were sent in on this mission.<br /><br />The detail he uses on the planning that went into the operation and execution of the mission keep you on the edge of your seat.  He discusses from the very beginning when he was first alerted, to the full scale mock up rehearsals in the North Carolina, to his C-17 flight out of Virginia Beach. You feel like you are standing along side him in the mission and he keeps you wanting more right up to \\"Go Day\\".  The timeline leaves nothing to spare, as you feel your heart rate increase when the infiltration of the mission begins and the crash of the first Black Hawk helicopter in the compound.  The detail that went into the raid keeps you engaged all the way to the methodical trigger press that released a decade of anger in one round to the body of the man who has haunted our country.<br /><br />The stir of controversy had me waiting to get this book on release day.  Like many, I wanted to read the \\"firsthand account\\" of the dethroning of a tyrant who has changed my life as well as many other service members.  The headline news everyday released a little more about the book and the warnings from the Pentagon on its release as well as the possible punishments the author may face.  These threats I feel played into Mark Owen's favor, attracting many readers like myself to dive into it upon release.  This ultimately led to the real identity of Mark Owen being released and we now know him as Matt Bissonnette.  The overall flow of his story makes you feel like you are there in the action, a participating member on this team, exercising justice on the man who has changed our life's, kept us from our families to ensure the security of our nation, and kept our country in a decade long war, combating terrorism at home and abroad.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Better then what I expected.  But it is a pretty obvious story with few surprises.  But I will read the other books.

B007BVMVDU|4.0|I read the first book some years back, but still found season one to be very engaging.  I'm looking forward to watching season two and I don't think I'll read the rest of the books.  Hopefully I don't miss too much just watching the TV series!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I loved this book, once I started reading it I couldn't put it down, it will have you wanting to finish it as soon as you pick it up. The connection between the main characters is so intense it captivates your attention from the first time they see each other.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I started reading this book because my best friend recommended it. I knew the movie was coming out soon so I started reading it. I couldn't stop reading it. I can't wait to see the movie now. I hope it is just as amazing as the book.

B0050DIWFC|5.0|Twist after turn, this is a real page turner and a hell of an ending!  I highly recommend reading this one!
B000MR9D5E|5.0|Inspiring and educational as you can only expect from Discovery and BBC. Excellent narration and beautiful footage. Even those without a nerdy persuasion will enjoy this box-set. I would especially recommend this to anyone that wanted to encourage a thirst for learning in their child.
B00785P2QC|3.0|Not a bad game, but needs less Facebook interaction. Be aware some goals require payment to complete, just skip these! Less waiting and more gameplay, gameplay unlike unlike the story games.

B002QE3CTY|3.0|As a teacher, I am always looking for books that would appeal to my students. That being said, this was a great book for a Jr. High boy. For adult fiction I felt it was a good read, but it missed many opportunities to capitalize on situations which would have  made the story line better.

0553381407|4.0|This is a good read for those who suffered any type of childhhod abuse.  It helps the survivor understand how the abuse may contribute to self perception problems as an adult and how it can effect present day relationships.
B003YL4LYI|4.0|It has the characters you came to love or hated. I kinda wish there was more action and less talking. I still believe storm of swords is the best in the series.
B005S9EKCW|3.0|First off, I am a die hard Les Mis-a-holic and have waited with baited breathe for nearly 20 years for this film to see frutition, only to be HIGHLY let down...and here's why. While visually the film is great, the majority of the performances left me cold and I will break each one down; starting with...<br /><br />Hugh Jackman...The Tony Award winning Aussie wins the role of a lifetime as our hero Jean Valjean. I had such high hopes when I heard this casting, giving Jackman's background and left the theater with his performance getting the title of \\"Biggest Letdown.\\" Vocally I feel this role was TOO big for even Jackman (just watch him attempt \\"Bring Him Home\\"). I will keep saying indefinitely that I feel he could have NAILED Javert instead, which leads me to...<br />Russell Crowe...I actually give the man an A for Effort, given he had the least amount of musical experience of all the main cast. His \\"acting\\" makes up for his lack of singing experience.However, part of the strength of Javert in the musical IS his songs.<br />Anne Hathaway...While she was the surprise performance of the film I DO have some issues of her portrayal of the doomed Fantine. I feel Tom Hopper completely wanted to make Fantine a victim the entire time she is on screen, far from who Fantine is in the stage show, and all culminating with \\"I Dreamed A Dream.\\" This is a song sung by a women who has not quite reached the bottom and still holds out hope but when Anne Hathaway sings it; you feel Fantine has all but given up on herself and her reason for living-Cosette.<br />Sasha Baron Cohan and Helena Bonham Carter...My vote for second biggest letdowns. These two CAN sing and had the chance to knock these parts out of the park-especially Helena. Listening to \\"Master Of The House\\" I couldn't believe what I was hearing (and seeing-i.e. the Santa scene). The song is supposed to be upbeat, bouncy, and yet I couldn't help but feel Sasha and Helena were held back and couldn't be who the characters are really like.<br />Amanda Seyfried...First off, I don't get what is with the hate. When it was announced that this film WAS happening; she was one of two roles I saw cast early on. She may not have the best voice for this type of musical (she shined in Mamma Mia)but she epitomises what older Cosette is about-innocence and a young women coming into her own.<br />Samantha Barks...She was hands down the best performance of the adult leads! I see nothing but good things for this young women who went from second runner up on a BBC talent show to West End star and now prepped to take on Hollywood.<br />Eddie Redemyer...Another performance that went from really bad in the beginning (the vibrato) to very moving in the end (second best \\"Empty Chairs\\" I've heard).<br /><br />Die hard fans will notice the cuts in the songs or rearranging the songs (which HIGHLY annoyed me-especially key parts). Unnecessary scenes (again, the \\"Santa scene,\\" if you've seen the movie you know the scene. If you aren't familiar with the show, then I would say that you'll enjoy this film.

B009LT1YZ6|4.0|I really like the game. The controls are very simple as it is just tilting your device. It is a simple game for the most part. There are a few objectives that recycle themselves with greater difficulty as you move forward in the levels. For instance, one is to just stay alive for 1 minute. All you have to do is swim around the black blobs for a minute. In the earlier levels, this one is pretty easy. As you move up, you get more blobs and &#34;shadow&#34; fish that follow you around as well (which you need to also avoid.)<br /><br />I love the developers for the fact that they allow you to decide how you want to hold your device for control. You can change the settings and have it so that you will start the game in the laying flat position, a near 45 degree position, and an auto detect which will allow the application to figure out the best position for your style of play.<br /><br />I also really appreciate the simplicity of the color scheme as well as the background music. Both lend to a 'fun' feel for the game. This game - even in black, white, and gradients of grey - will appeal to anyone. This game is EXCELLENT for hand/eye coordination and quick thinking - which lends me to believe this would be awesome for kids as well.<br /><br />Also, if you are like me and hate the amount of permissions some games use, have no fear with Last Fish. There are none. It does not ask to even access your screen controls (to allow the screen to go to sleep or not.)  The lack of permissions this game asks for is alone worth it to me.<br /><br />My only complaint with the game is that there does not seem to be a rhyme or reason in its star scoring system. Even if I never hit goo and make it to all of my checkpoints or health bubbles, I may still get a lower star score than I would have believed I earned on the level. As others have mentioned, it seems as though the stars are awarded for time completion and not so much for actual skill. But even with that, the game is still fun and completely worth the time.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|its a great game does get a bit samey from time to time but you will enjoy it as you can connect to fb and try and beat ur friends scores
B0002VFXFE|5.0|I used the paste right after i got it and i can say...it's a BIG difference o.o Great product for this price. Most pastes that cost 3 times that much didn't manage to cool down that good. Thank you :D I'll buy again.

B00AQMSJI2|3.0|It's a good game. Earning more land takes more time as the game goes on, and more money.  Slow paced but still a good game.

B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game the makers of this game did very well . I hope others play this game. Have fun!!
B00B2V66VS|2.0|This game was better the first time. It's really laggy and it doesn't do the movement that you swipe. I have it on my iPod Touch 4th Generation and my Kindle Fire HD 8.9, and I'm not impressed.
B00004WX4X|5.0|Illmatic is by far my favorite Hip-Hop album, I own it on Cassette, CD as well as Vinyl. I listen to it everyday in order to gain inspiration and as a recording artist I would have never decided to record if it weren't for Illmatic. Illmatic embodies exactly what it was like to grow up and live in Queens, New York during the 90's. Definitely a must for any Hip-Hop or music collection!
B001BKTEZA|5.0|The language is beautiful and inspiring despite the sad, grueling subject. read it along side Ken Burns doc on same.
B007REV4T8|5.0|The best of the Daniel Craig Bond movies and possible in the top 5 of all of them.  The story is fascinating and with a few twists and the action is beyong belief.  Nice touches of humor are occasionally interjected.  The time just flew by.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|I am having a lot of fun playing this game. Its a good game to play on brake at work or wile waiting for an appointment at the doctors. This game also keeps my kids entertained.
B00B2YH7D6|5.0|Ok, so I have yet to see this movie. But I'm totally appalled.<br /><br />64 reviews...and yet it's not released until March? Ok, good theory....<br /><br />Come on guys...

B006LSZECO|5.0|This was an amazing (ha!) book. I felt bad  for Nick and really and truly despised Amy. I wish there was a revenge ending, but it was still really good. Sick and twisted but really good.
B0086700CM|3.0|and she let me play it and I decided to download it. I don't play it as much as I thought I would but still a fun game. Seems other people get addicted...
B00881VLCE|5.0|Many different and beautiful puzzles for free, you can choose the number of pieces or if the pieces are rotated which makes it more challenging. relaxing music... very nice!
B009F7ORQW|4.0|It was the perfect size that we were looking for , The child was very happy, I would recommend this item.
0486406482|5.0|\\"Emma\\" is the first Jane Austen novel I read and since then I have read most of Jane Austen's novels.  The story takes you back to old Enland (I guess 1800s)..the main character Emma, is a smart young woman from a well to do family in England.  The story pretty much revolves around our heroine in her attempts at matchmaking, the social norms of England in those times etc.  Though it borders on romance, I would say it is more of drama.  Of course, Knightley (though old) is an adorable character in the story.  Though Emma might seem a little...spoiled to some readers, I would say she is a sensible, likeable heroine.  This book is one of the classics and is a wonderful read...
B00846F1YW|4.0|This is an enjoyable game for those who like playing picture search games. It also gets a little more difficult as you go on. It's a good one for exercising the brain, and hey, after all, it's free!
B007IXWL2C|4.0|Choose the book because I read the first one. It was better then the other books. Not really believeable but entertaining.
B00992CF6W|2.0|Great, but Survivalcraft is better and ALOT cheaper. Survivalcraft is $3.99 and Minecraft is $6.99. So if you get Survivalcraft (not the demo of it) it's the same and you save $3.99, which you could spend on other apps. So it's pretty much a waste of $3.99.
B009UX2YAC|3.0|I have a kindle fire and when I have a lot of money on this game it will start over and I wont have any characters or money left I had 53 hoverboards and now I only have 3 and If I don't play this game for like 3-6 days then it will start over but other than that it is a good game way better than temple run and it has cool graphics:) :(
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|Started out about teenagers trying to get in bed with each other, but as the story eventually opened up, I found I really enjoyed the story and the mystery that the young people had in their lives.
B003VANOFY|4.0|Generally very happy with this. Good sound quality, mic works well, range seems to be about 20 feet or so. Only complaint is that it's not the most comfortable and the battery life can be somewhat short. I'd give this 4.5 stars if I could.
B0055SWM08|5.0|I thought this was going to be easy but you really need to think your moves at least 3  to 4 in advance.  This is a great mind game.
B0039UTDA6|5.0|This product is awsome those documentaries should be free and every kid should be able to watch this and realize that this is not our planet ...
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Awesome book will read again... couldn't stop reading it.. read the book in one day...can't wait to see the movie
B009FZHYKU|5.0|After watching one episode of this series, I was hooked.  It's full of intense action and cliffhangers, and also has a little bit of romance.  This show isn't for people with weak stomachs as it contains very graphic violence.  Check out AMC tonight for a new episode!
B003H4I4JU|5.0|This book was awesome. It was better then the first book. I hope they make this book series into movie.
B008J05EL8|2.0|Agreed.  Purchasing fonts for the app to work properly is beyond marketing stupidity.No issue if  they had just tagged on the $5 orginal purchase price.  Will keep on looking for a source with a better connect with customers.  Mine is a long term relationship opportunity.  They've lost that at the get-go!
B00ARAN9JW|1.0|Horrible movie. Literally a waste of time. stopped half way through the movie to hammer a nail in my head
B008469DGY|5.0|I have this app on both my phone and my Kindle Fire. It is easy too spend too much time playing once you have it.
B001F12J0C|5.0|Nice full screen package! I needed to get a new set as my old ones were all scratched up! Nice price for the set!
0425263916|3.0|This book was actually better than the first one. It is, however, incredibly repetitive, and almost nothing gets resolved. The majority of the book can be summarized in to words: arguing and sex. They argue...and then they have sex...repeat. I just kept waiting for something else to happen.<br /><br />Also, am I the only one who wants a little bdsm? I feel like the author is taunting me. We know Gideon is a dominator, but we have to wait until the very end of the first book to hear him say it (even though we know it all along). I thought something would happen to develop this part of the plot in RIY, but nothing did. It seems like Gideon wants to be the dominator, but the author doesn't explore this at a very deep level. I'm not asking for hardcore bdsm here, but I did think we were going to get a little more of it in the second book. Who knows. Maybe I'm expecting too much, and maybe Day has no intention of going any further than she already has. It's just a little disappointing...in my opinion anyway.
B005LFQRTC|5.0|I grew up watching this show as a child and LOVED IT.  Being able to watch it again on dvd is a plus.  I can hear the theme music in my head over and over.  LOVE IT

B004SDEP38|2.0|I haven't been able to figure out what to do with this yet, or why I have it plus a &#34;Documents To Go Full Version Key.&#34; Probably I'm just dumb, and so far too lazy to google it.
B004EPYZUS|5.0|On a par with the previous movies.  Lots of action and locations were interesting.  Worth watching several times.  My wife was not impressed.
8862933177|4.0|I love watching movies so I thought this would be a fun journal to write down all my thoughts and such on the movies I watch. I really like it-- the binding is good, the pages are thick enough that inks don't bleed through, and I love the cover design and all the little stickers it comes with. The one issue I have with it is that I dislike the alphabetic tabs they set up. Lets face it, you're probably not going to watch very many movies that start with \\"X!\\". I think in the future, I would probably just ignore the letters and fill out the pages in order by date. If moleskine has any plans on updating this, I'd suggest that they do away with the letters and maybe just go by month?
B005LAIIPS|4.0|I don't think it was as good as the previous Bourne movies.  It makes a little more sense if you have seen the previous three movies.
B00AFCEIB0|2.0|In my opinion, Google tried to do too much with this app.  Just give me a Google search!  Too many search options.

B00729M0GO|4.0|All of Andre' Rieu's work is exceptional. However, he is playing a lot of the same music on each one. We love watching him, but it is time he adds new music and only a few of the old standards. Would recommend it to Andre' followers for their collections.

B000NDETLK|5.0|Northanger Abbey was my least favorite in the Jane Austen books.  This particular movie enhanced the novel and its presentation made the story entertaining  and a joy to watch.  I have since re-read the book, and it is now my Jane Austen favorite.
B00A9T1HUO|4.0|Josh Groban has always been a favorite of mine, for he has the most amazing, magnificent voice that does well from pop to classical genre. Now he's expanding into doing some of his own songwriting, which I don't consider myself knowledgeable enough in that area to rate. I'm sure he will excel in all areas of musicality, though.  I rated this 4 stars mainly because I was a little disappointed in this. My initial assessment has remained the same though I've listened to it over and over again-- that it is rhythmic, energetic, well orchestrated, but that orchestration often overwhelms hearing the words. I enjoy his music when the diction is also clear and meaningful.  However, I am not sorry to have purchased another wonderful music experience with an amazing voice!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|The best show on cable keeps raising the bar in season 3. I cant wait to see what happens with the governor - the first great villain in this series that previously featured only threats from zombies!
1439152799|3.0|This is a mix of gothic, mystery,and old romance. This haunting story of spinster sisters in an old castle and the secrets to be exposed was a slower read than Morton's other books.  The author writes very involved, well woven stories that jump between the past and present in different chapters, but I found this less intriguing than 2 others that I great enjoyed.  Those 2 were &#34;The Forgotten Garden&#34; and &#34; The Secret Keeper&#34; which were deep in historical fiction and great characterizations.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|It's ok some games are fun some games are lame. But fun over all. I think that should have diff levels for the single games.

B004UPANGM|3.0|This is a movie that only Bruce Camblell can star in..its fun and crazy..it fit in for the time when zombie and dead back to life movies were the rage
B005KQVDH8|5.0|This is a great movie. One of those that stays good through the years. Thank you for offering it in Blu-ray.
B005S9EK5Y|4.0|****1/2<br /><br />The long-delayed movie version of the stage musical “Les Miserables” has finally arrived - and the good news is that it is well worth the wait.  For the film harkens back to those glory days when musicals were massively-scaled, big-time events, and when all involved in their making wore their hearts unashamedly on their sleeves for all to see.<br /><br />“Les Miz” is, of course, based on the beloved Victor Hugo novel about the hardened convict, Jean Valjean, who devotes his life to helping others after a kind bishop shows him compassion and forgiveness at the darkest moment of his life. Through the course of the story, Valjean touches the lives of many people, but none so significantly as those of Fantine, the waiflike prostitute who has fallen on desperate times, and her daughter Cosette, whom Valjean dedicates his life to raising after her mother‘s death.  Valjean’s main antagonist is Inspector Javert, an unyielding stickler for the law who has made it his life’s mission to bring what he sees as a flagrant lawbreaker to justice, unmoved by all the good Valjean has done.<br /><br />With its vast array of larger-than-life figures, its melodramatic plotting, romantic flourishes and great themes of legal vs. natural law and the possibility of personal redemption - all set against the backdrop of sweeping social injustice in 19th Century France -“Les Miz” was obviously ideal material for composer Claude-Michel Schonberg and lyricist Alain Boublil ( with English translation by Herbert Kretzmer) to work with. In fact, so rich is the vein they’re mining here that “Les Miz” is closer to operetta than it is to those musicals of a bygone era, with very little spoken dialogue throughout the course of the movie. And this brings us to one of the minor quibbles I have with the film and with the show as a whole.<br /><br />For if there is a weakness to the film, it is probably the result of two factors: the inevitable difficulties inherent in trying to cram a 1200-page novel into a two-and-a-half-hour film, and the fact that the movie is entirely sung. The result of both of these limitations is that we lose some of the connective tissue that provides the characters’ motivations.  The story tends to move in fits and starts and lacks the cohesive flow that at least some dialogue might have provided. The constant singing also prevents the characters from engaging one another in conversation, which would help to clarify some of the finer details of the plot.  For instance, we don’t get a sense of why Valjean is so beloved as mayor of his town (he showed them how to manufacture jewelry more quickly and economically, thereby saving the community from ruin). We’re also deprived of the intense back-and-forth struggle between Valjean and Javert for Fantine’s soul.  Moreover, Valjean’s moment of great self-sacrifice, when he turns himself into the court to save the man falsely accused of being him, goes by so fast that many people, unfamiliar with the story, may not even understand fully what’s going on there.  Even worse, Cosette and Marius, the impulsive revolutionary who becomes the young girl’s love interest, aren’t even allowed a moment of communication before they’re pledging undying devotion to one another in verse.<br /><br />Yet, even with these flaws, “Les Miz” is a tremendously  moving and uplifting experience, unabashed in its sentimentality.  Much has been made of the fact that the singing was recorded live on set, a breakthrough that does indeed add a quality of immediacy to the production, even if the soundtrack will probably suffer in comparison to one of the many stage recordings that have been released over the decades.  Hugh Jackman and Anne Hathaway do a particularly fine job in the singing department, with only Russell Crowe as Javert failing to rise to the challenge to any appreciable extent. And there are many scenes, particularly in the second half, that are positively transporting: a poignant Hathaway nailing “I Dreamed a Dream,” Amanda Seyfried and Eddie Redmayne singing “In My Life,” Samantha Banks as Eponine performing “On My Own,” Redmayne singing the heartbreaking “Empty Chairs at Empty Tables,” the whole cast joining in on “One Day More” (the show’s homage to “The Quintet” from “West Side Story”), and the chorus performing the majestic “Do You Hear the People Sing?” which can’t help but lift your heart into your throat. And indeed your heart will be lodged there through significant portions of this movie.<br /><br />Tom Hooper (“The King’s Speech”) has directed the film largely as a succession of close-ups, which does deprive us of a sense of spatial geography from time to time but which helps to enhance the operatic nature of the piece.  And, oddly for a musical, there is no choreography to speak of, just as there wasn’t in the stage production.  For compensation, we have Sacha Baron Cohen and Helena Bonham Carter having the time of their professional lives portraying the campy, comic-relief villains, the Thenardiers.<br /><br />Let’s just hope that the making of “Les Miserables,” and the audience’s obvious appreciation of it, will finally bring back the old-fashioned movie musical.  It‘s been far too long.tively transporting: a poignant Hathaway nailing “I Dreamed a Dream,” Amanda Seyfried and Eddie Redmayne singing “In My Life,” Samantha Banks as Eponine performing “On My Own,” Redmayne singing the heartbreaking “Empty Chairs at Empty Tables,” the whole cast joining in on “One Day More” (the show’s homage to “The Quintet” from “West Side Story”), and the chorus performing the majestic “Do You Hear the People Sing?” which can’t help but lift your heart into your throat.

B00005MP58|5.0|This is the longest but best telling of the Jane Austin novel. The do a superb job and are realistically sized characters. They all look English because its done by the BBC.  You must get this version if you love Pride and Prejudice.  I also think its fun that Colin Firth is Mr. Darcy in this series and in the Bridget Jones modern spin.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|Just a little farther is what I keep telling myself when I play this, before I know it I've been playing for hours. This game is fun for all ages, very cute and addictive, It's simple yet challenging.
0425263908|1.0|I saw the review that said you if you loved 50 Shades you should read this book.  WRONG!  There was no story!  No connection (other than physical) between the characters.  Fifty had a great relationship between Ana & Christian.  The emails alone were awesome.<br />Like someone else said, the story went nowhere and I felt like I was reading a dirty book!
B009MF5BXK|3.0|Nothing like a bunch of old, over the hill has been heroes making their last hurrah (hopefully). Thank goodness for superior make-up artists and computerized enhancements. About the only one who appears to have aged gracefully is Chuck Norris. It is amazing at how the bad guys often can't hit anything while the heroes never miss. Having gotten the negatives, more or less, out of the way, some positives. Kind of turns into a &#34;Magnificent Seven&#34; with the heroes setting out to save a village, and those under the heel of a despot. As long as you don't take it seriously, it is an entertaining film, with a lot of one liners resurrected from the heroes' past rolls. The younger set will especially love its nonstop action, pyrotechnics, and special effects, and of course the good guys win in the end.
B000000ORX|5.0|There is nothing that I could possibly say about this Joni Mitchell record that it does not say for itself.
B009HV2JT8|2.0|Really preposterous film. Without computer generated graphics, like so many today, that make up for lack of acting  and directing skills, this movie could never have been made. For those into &#34;vampire mania&#34;, this movie with its abundant blood and gore, superhuman vampire strength, and ridiculous feats of 'daring do&#34; will be just the ticket. For those not into same, forget it.
B00001W9G0|4.0|A perfect vehicle for both Streisand and Redford. The stars seem to have been made for each other. It's Streisand's best dramatic acting in a film, without any music. Beautiful title song. The film went too light on the politics and too heavy on the romance. It could have been a far more important film had that not happened. Who told Streisand that she was not great when she was strident. When she is strident, she is near perfection.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Loved this book.  Got into it right from the get go.  Kept me interested the whole way through.  A page turner for sure.
B0018QQQK8|4.0|I haven't seen the movie and only read a few Sparks books because they all seemed the same.  This one had me intrigued.  The end is a bit abrupt is my only complaint.
B003YFIUW8|5.0|Great book, I loved it.  Couldn't put it down!  I would recommend this book to everyone.  My entire book club enjoyed it.
B004ZJZPZC|5.0|If you like ABBA at all and want to smile a lot this movie is the movie to buy. It has a good plot and the songs go so well adding to the plot. I laughed a lot at all the actors acting in rolls that I never seen them in before. I am sure that they must have had a barrel of laughs and good times making this film and it shows that they did in their performances and the added material on the DVD. As I said, if you like ABBA,,, this is a must to see.
B0084U0IEG|2.0|Can't get into it. I was still waiting for something to happen when I was at 50% complete.  Maybe it will get better, but I don't want to have to read half of a book to start enjoying it.
B0062NAVXA|5.0|I love all of the Sherwood movies so I am already sold before I see them. If you believe in God and love movies that are family oriented, this is a great movie to see. It is fun to watch, it will make you laugh and it will make you cry. This movie has a great message for any family that wants a strong bond between spouses and their children. If this movie does not touch your heart,, nothing will.
B000E1NWGO|5.0|This is a quality recording in my book even if you only listen to the 2-channel stereo CD portion.  Of course, the full 3-channel  SACD layer of this hybrid disc in \\"high res\\" DSD format takes one to another, higher level of enjoyment.  This represents the essence of RCA's Living Stereo series, which were originally recorded in either 2 or 3 channels starting in 1958 and continuing through the early 1960's -- this one is from 1962 and '63.  Of course, this coincided with the advent of 2-channel, stereophonic recording, which is how they were originally produced on vinyl records.  The original master tapes are now being remastered for SACD multi-channel sound, with minimal \\"adjustments\\", i.e., if it is a 3-channel master tape, it stays as a 3-channel SACD recording. (Technical section and a history of early recording is included in the excellent booklet.)<br /><br />Here Arthur Rubenstein plays 4 Beethoven Sonatas.  The music itself is just lovely.  And as you listen you can not help wonder how such a recording could have been made 50 years ago!  Truth be told, it was with tube electronics (!) and minimalist microphone arrangements in a realistic venue = Manhattan Center, NYC, in this case.<br /><br />I could go on and on, but suffice to say, that if you enjoy classical music, whether it be Beethoven (as here), Mozart, Haydn, or Bach, or just quality musical recordings of any type, you owe yourself the pleasure of latching onto any of these Living Stereo SACD releases -- even if you don't have a 5.1-channel Home Theater sound system with SACD capabilities.

Most of the teen readers will look at that relationship as some kind of standard of bliss, but they eventually grow up and have healthier expectations of balance and healthy boundaries in a relationship.<br /><br />The storytelling feels a little outdated.  This Christian guy, who has billionaire, not millionaire, billionaire so there is POWER, with a religious name, and perfect looks. So there is this godlike quality.  Then Anastasia Steele she is younger, so the power dynamic tips in Christian favor.  She is this archetype of clumsy young thing, flawed, hopeless.  She is not coming from a place of having an identity or strength, but emotional immaturity.<br /><br />Here's a quote of Anastasia thinking out loud:<br />'...searching the photo for some clue as to why he's not the man for me - his own words to me. And it's suddenly, blindingly obvious. He's too gloriously good-looking. We are poles apart and from two very different worlds.'<br /><br />When evaluating the relationship and whether to go further, she is completely basing it on externals, like how rich he is how attractive he is. Not on he treated her right, or was nice to other people, his communication abilities, etc things from his behavior, but she references attributes inherited to him like appearance and wealth.<br /><br />Then when she is being sexually assaulted, Christian Grey shows up and protects her.  The whole book like some perversion of Freud. Anastasia basically wants someone who takes care of her, has control, knows what's best for her more than she does. It's like a paternal influence but he can romantically pursues her at the same time. This is where I feel it's outdated.  It's kind of the reason, that Celebrity couple with the huge age gap Doug Hutchison and Courtney stodden.  I mean if Doug was a billionaire, and ridiculously attractive, would it have been a more accepting match?  Yeah.<br /><br />'He notices my dizziness and grabs me before I fall and hoists me into his arms, holding me close to his chest like a child. (Then later he says to Anastasia ''\\"You're lucky I'm just scolding you.\\"'<br /><br />A woman's sexual identity, expectations, boundaries are defined by her.  They should be actively created and designed by her, not the romantic partner.  This book is based on the same ideology and expectations, that girls need to stay virgins and be sexually inexperienced, but men are suppose to be skilled sowing their oats and be the reference on all things sex.  That when it comes to sex, men are in charge and have the power, and women are dependent on the man for that.  This narrative is outdated.<br /><br />The modern women, the Sex in the City, Gossip Girl, Lena Dunham, Buffy, Yahoo CEO Marisa, Hillary Clinton, Christine Amanpour, Oprah, isn't looking for a father as a partner, but an equal.  And great sexual expression between two people isn't' about an inequal balance of control and power.<br /><br />I just hope this book is popular because readers have accepted that it's a fantasy novel, like Star Wars, and Harry Potter.  I just hope impressionable minds don't match their expectations and boundaries in sexual relationships to Christian and Anastasia.sly attractive, would it have been a more accepting match?

B000005HDT|3.0|Donald Byrd arrived in NYC almost immediately after the death of the peerless Clifford Brown, and within 3 months he appeared on arguably the most satisfying album ever recorded by Art Blakey and the Jazz Messengers: [[ASIN:B0012GMYFK The Jazz Messengers]].  Besides the most challenging, even brilliant compositions of Horace Silver (\\"Nica's Dream,\\" \\"Ecarole\\") the session demonstrated the art of improvisation at its tasteful, inventive, melodic best, as performed by complementary musical twins--Hank Mobley and Donald Byrd.  Byrd was to the trumpet what Mobley was to the tenor saxophone--no poses, no pyrotechnical flash, no extramusical \\"star persona\\" business.  Byrd, like Mobley, was all about the music itself, about improvising the most melodious, lyrical and soulful solos possible (his long, uninterrupted, breathless phrasing, modeled after Sinatra's best work on Capitol, is especially noticeable on the ballads--check out \\"Everything Happens to Me\\" [[ASIN:B000TGZFU0 Donald Byrd And Doug Watkins - The Transition Sessions]] or \\"I'm a Fool to Want You\\" [[ASIN:B000GPI15U Royal Flush]].<br /><br />Still, it's high time for a reassessment of the brilliance and accomplishments of this remarkable player who, upon his explosive arrival in NYC in 1956 was on a course of appearing on a recorded session every month if not every week!  (For starters, check out his overwhelming discography at Wikipedia.)  Even now I'm hearing his peers characterizing him as an \\"economical, tasteful, and melodic\\" player.  It's true that, sensing he could not be another Clifford (who could?), he worked hard on tone and phrasing.  (Unlike Diz and Miles, Byrd wanted a big, \\"pretty\\" sound--listen to his extraordinary extended \\"Stardust\\" [[ASIN:B00004T0LX Motor City Scene]] for evidence of his success.)  But he also had impressive facility early on.  The big tone and long breath stream served him well on the up-tempo tunes as well as the ballads.  Simply check out \\"Lover Come Back to Me\\" or the title tune on [[ASIN:B000HC2PCC Off to the Races]].  But the most impressive Byrd solo I've heard is on Red Garland's \\"All Morning Long\\"[[ASIN:B000000YGB All Mornin Long]], which matches Byrd with John Coltrane.  In fact, Trane's performance brings out the best in Donald Byrd.  Following Coltrane's solo on Tad Dameron's \\"Our Delight,\\" Byrd could have chosen to play it safe. Instead, he puts on his meanest \\"Clifford Brown\\" game-face and goes head to head with Coltrane, arguably taking solo honors!  (Listen for the climax of his solo: after weaving harmonically intricate 8th-note patterns through the tune's chord progression, he begins to probe the upper register of his horn, climaxing with 3 upward glissandos amounting to dramatic exclamation marks to close out the recording).  Small wonder that by the mid-60s he was looking for ways to \\"communicate\\" with larger audiences while at the same time saving his chops!  Still, on much of his early work he demonstrates that he deserves to be placed in the same league as Lee Morgan and Freddie Hubbard.<br /><br />With the arrival of Bob Dylan, the Beatles, the Stones, the music changed drastically, and many of the leading exponents of America's indigenous African-American art were hard-pressed to find recording studios or employment in the USA.  Miles Davis was an exception, turning his back on his past work for Prestige and Columbia in favor of fusion, electronic, rock-inflected improvisation (\\"Bitches Brew' is credited as opening up new doors to the public for Miles, Chick, Herbie, McGlaughlin--and Donald Byrd).  But when  Donald brought his lightweight disco-sounding Blackbyrds to Chicago's Jazz Showcase, they laid a collective giant-sized egg.  (Jazz impressario Joe Segal was practically beside himself, vowing not to invite this \\"dance group\\" for a return engagement.)<br /><br />As a busy musician in a disco group during this time (I frequently surrounded myself with 3 electronic keyboards, 2 at right angles to my Rhodes), I understand the continuing appeal of this kind of music to many who are my age or younger.  But at the risk of sounding like Wynton Marsalis, this music has only the most marginal relation to jazz as an \\"art form\\": it's inferior, ephemeral music (as is so much of the all-original music by young artists today--many of whom pontifically dismiss the \\"Great American Songbook\\" as beneath them), but it still sells to an ever-diminishing audience that remembers the initial excitement associated with one of these groups.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I was initially captivated by the inexhaustible beauty of Mobley, Clifford, Byrd, Desmond, and numerous other modern and \\"neo-bop\\" musicians who applied the original \\"Bird's\\" revolutionary playing to the treasures--from Berlin to Ellington to Cole Porter--of the American Songbook.  It wasn't dance music, it wasn't about high-power sonics or electronics or mixing or \\"effects.\\"  Still, it was necessarily powerful, deeply felt, ceaselessly inventive music--and for ten years Donald Byrd was one of its leading representatives.derstand the continuing appeal of this kind of music to many who are my age or younger.

B0041KKYGU|5.0|If you've ever worked in a school, you will recognize this crew of teachers and staff.  Nice casting job by someone and well acted by many familiar faces.  I laughed out loud throughout.  However, if you don't enjoy irreverent, adult humor, this movie is not for you.
B00011KHTM|4.0|This adapter does exactly what it is supposed to do.  It would be helpful if the item descriptor was more specific as to which models of MacBook this adapter fits.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I love this book along with many other books by Nicholas sparks. I  Can't wait to see the movie very soon.
B007U1FEJE|5.0|This album proved that Brian Wilson rejoining the group really helped maintain the Beach Boy sound.  It is unfortunate that Mike Love dissolved the group and now has created a new group.  Brian really made the difference.  The Beach Boys sound just as great as they did in the 60s.  My only criticism is that the album is too short.

B00ATSBIIG|5.0|If you like jigsaw puzzles, you will love this.  I'm playing it on my Kindle Fire HD, and the graphics are fantastic. I've done some of the puzzles over and over just to see the images take shape again. I'm still on the first level, and the puzzles have gotten progressively harder. While you can go at your own pace solving the puzzles, the Challenge rounds are tough! Great game.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|i very much liked this book. i would recommend it as a great read. i especially liked the mother in the story and did feel sorry for her but she keeps trying so hard. It was a great read
B006GWO5NE|5.0|It works perfectly and doesn't' t heat up at all when I use my kindle while it is still charging.
0547848412|5.0|An amazing book from many angles. An adventure yarn. A parable of life and morality. A book for cat lovers! Well written and composed in the sense of word-by-word, character development, etc. I recall a (probably imagined) discussion between Proust and Degas. Degas lamented the fact that he couldn't write, despite having &#34;beautiful thoughts&#34;. Proust respond that excellent writing was made from beautiful words, not just thoughts. Anyway, Yann Martel writes well, in addition to having &#34;beautiful thoughts&#34;.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
1451673442|5.0|I'm in about 5 days and just feel great about myself and my future. It is a wonderful guide and is helping me to change my attitude.

1451695195|5.0|My wife and I found Eben Alexander's life-changing experience to be an exciting adventure from page one to the very end.  We have given copies of the book to family members and shared the good doctor's faith-enhancing experience with our friends.  A physician in-law of ours said, &#34;thank you so much for sending me this book; it has changed my life!&#34;
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I was surprised to see that my 4 year old loves watching my 7 year old boy play this game. since there is so much going on on the screen the 4 year old can even help by doing some things also on the screen. I wish there were more games that allowed two kids to play at the same time on the same surface.
B004L35GAQ|5.0|I was surprised on how much I liked this CD, I brought this because of one song, then I liked the whole CD not just a few of the songs
B004MC8CA2|4.0|I live in Africa and it is great to have multiple Bibles with me when I travel, but this App could use some improvements for those who live in places where we can't get internet 24/7. For example I would love to have at least one audio recording downloaded ahead of time to listen to later.
B003UBTX7C|4.0|Plenty of twists and turns to keep the reader entertained, but some of the transitions are bumpy and do not maintain the flow of the story.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|love it. it goes fast and is fun. still getting the hang of it. kids like it too. I don't under stand if I have to buy stuff with real money yet to move the game along.
B001HZ9ABM|5.0|Odessa was a great project for the Bee Gee's.<br />I first listened to my brother's vinyl album when I was growing up. Bought my first copy of the CD a few years back.<br />Actually bought this copy for my brother.<br />I pull it out often to listen again.
630542845X|5.0|A real keeper.  Very interesting story line.  One to watch again on movie night.  I would highley recommend watching it.
B000TO0TCQ|5.0|It keeps me on the edge of my seat I only imagine brief parts of it it would be nice to see it on the big screen
B00133KHCY|5.0|Great movie,  One for most of the family to watch.  Great music and even greater story line.  I would highly recommend.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is so cool. It's really fun and addicting.it is a lot like temple run and I think that is really cool. :-)
B00006CXSS|5.0|The  best dvd series on a 'slice of life' on GI's during WWII.  A well acted and realistic portrayal of what it must have been like.  These 10 discs are a must for the WWII historian.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|This is just what I needed for traveling and the sounds are not too harsh.  I enjoy weather on it also.
0790737345|5.0|Great movie to watch on date night.  Excellent acting from two of the best!  A love story even a guy can get into.
0770435726|4.0|[[ASIN:0770435726 The Expats: A Novel]] is a very stylish - chic, even - spy thriller.  Set in Luxembourg, the story of Kate and the people around her spins and weaves and makes sudden, unexpected turns.  It makes me think of the way people drive when they're \\"shaking a tail.\\"  It also makes for a great superstructure for the book.<br /><br />Kate is ex-CIA, having quit a job she wasn't enthralled with to move to Luxembourg with her husband, Dexter.  Dexter doesn't know her secret.  The days in Luxembourg roll past as Kate tries to figure out what to do with her life, cares for her kids, and has coffees with other mothers in the expat community.  Life is more complicated when she meets Julia and her husband - all Kate's instincts tell her they are dangerous.  She just can't figure out how.<br /><br />If you like your spy thrillers stylish and literary (think John LeCarre) this is a great book.  You'll appreciate the intricacies of plot and the prose.  If you like your spy thrillers full of gadgets and macho men (think James Bond) you should try this - throwing shades of gray and deeper complexity into the mix makes the whole thing even more fun.  Highly recommended.
B00005JCAA|5.0|Great movie.  Great musical sound track.  Interesting story line. Very well acted.  Unusual part for Brad Pitt.  I Highly recommend it.
B0013TXA5Y|4.0|It was a very good book. In some parts it was predictable about what was going to happen while others kept me at the edge of my seat. It's a well written book but I don't think it's the best in the series though.
B008TRUDAS|5.0|Wow, what an amazing book. A friend recommend this book to me and I read it originally because I'm a huge Avett Brothers fan, and even though I loved and appreciated every quote and reference, this book is so much more than that. Wow what a great find.
B005WUHAX8|1.0|This was a fake piece of s*** case. Not real. Not waterproof. Do not waste your money on this, buy the real thing.
0385335997|5.0|The Outlander series is just plain awesome. I can not stop reading them.  The characters are so real and the story line so spellbinding.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Having had my own experience in a different way, I could relate to this experience. I appreciate that this author has a scientific approach in one aspect and a spiritual approach in another. Obviously he cared enough to talk to the people who experienced this with him and found out what they were doing, thinking and feeling while dealing with his experience. His family is very blessed to have each other in this lifetime.<br />I appreciate the medical knowledge shared as well and I hope he continues to serve our realm in his heartfelt way. We could all benefit from a doctor who has been enlightened as he is.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|App works as advertised, adding much needed detail to the Kindle Fire's battery life monitor. App includes estimates of remaining operating time under different types of loads like watching videos, reading or web browsing.  I have had no issues with app and there are no obnoxious ads or strings.
B001D0BLTA|5.0|No problems with disk. If you missed this movie, own it and watch it every year or so! I would highly recommend it to others.
B001BKVWYQ|5.0|Vinyl do all the difference! This LP is a new print with execellent sound. Next trip will go to South Africa were Rodriguez is appreciated :-)
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Just like the description above; this app is completely convenient and easy to use. I prefer this one over the other free calculator app out there. This too has very large buttons when using it on your Kindle Fire making it quite user friendly.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Great read, but must read all to understand! I love me some Christian Grey, but Ana takes some getting use to.
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|Recommend this to anyone at any age. Nothing more fun than using your own drawing/artwork to move your stickman through the game. If you like to tap into your creative side; then I highly recommend trying this out.
B004XWMXW4|5.0|I heard of Sulic and Hauser from Youtube...and wow, I could listen to this all day. Actually, I do.<br /><br />Gorgeous music. I loved it so much that I bought this CD for my mother.
0399215921|2.0|VERY SMALL! I expected this book to be much bigger. great for little ones except that it is st risk of being torn bc the pages are thin paper
B003UBTX6S|5.0|Perfect sequel. Crazy twists and revelations. About to start on the third book now :)<br />So action packed and filled with high velocity emotions. Intense.
B005BCE7FQ|4.0|First Blu-ray we ordered wouldn't work, so we thought there was a problem with the disc (we had ordered used).  Second disc was new and had the exact same issue.  Looked at the Amazon discussions and people were having problems playing on their PS3 players (we were playing ours on a Sony Blu-ray home theater system).  They had to disable the internet function on the PS3 to get the disc to work; we did the same and it also then worked.  It was very frustrating having to stop a movie on \\"family movie night\\" to research and fix a problem.....my kids were getting pretty impatient.<br /><br />So I'd give the actual disc 1 star, but the movie 5 stars.  Kid-appropriate humor and they loved the music.  We even played the \\"jukebox\\" songs on the disc afterwards so they could dance their little hearts out.  (My kids are 6 and 3.)
B009LT1YZ6|1.0|I played for about ten minutes and could not make it work. The fish just kept going to the side and stopping. I have a top of the line Nexus 7, so it is not crappy hardware. It just doesn't make sense. Whenever the fish was pointed in the right direction, it would stop, but when it was pointed to a corner, it would dash right toward it.
B00BB8RKH6|3.0|Good story but pretty slow. Acting was great. Seemed like the movie would have been better if it was shorter.
B009XWD02G|5.0|i like using this app.  i can listen to all the music i want and listen to them all day long. i would recommend this to everyone.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I absolutely Loved this book. It Had me hooked from the very beginning until the ending.A beautiful disaster it is.....
B006LL0UZW|4.0|Following Dustin on Flickr and occasionally mentioned on the Strobist®, I picked up this book in electronic form for fun. It wasn't a lot of money and Dustin seemed like a good guy. On my Android phone it was a little difficult to read, and some things were hidden, but was fine on  a larger device. I liked the manner in which he described the basics, tho I remember a little bit of incongruity in the text(sorry, can't think of specifics it's been a while since I read). If I get a chance to re read the book I'll update with specifics. The back to back setup and results layout shots were very helpful. You aren't going to become a lighting master just from this book, but it is useful to add to your lighting learning arsenal. I enjoyed the quirky comments in some of the setup photos.<br /><br />I would almost recommend to get this in print form, as I feel it may be a little better to flip back and forth to see the setup and final pictures together.
B000BJ7BCA|5.0|it is a good family movie. I like it and also good for the kids. always looking for movies I will want to watch too. to spend time with kids
6305426694|5.0|Fast service and pkg wrapped securely!<br /><br />Movie was for a law class and I ndded right away and I got it!
B008D28HYS|5.0|I grabbed this as the FAOTD, but I would be willing to pay for it (and I don't ever buy apps).  I spend hours on this.  It is challenging, but not frustrating.  It takes time, but isn't tedious.  LOVE IT!
B005CRQ4GU|4.0|It was a very short book but anyway it was a good and funny. I liked how it was related to Valentine's day! <3
B005G4TJUC|5.0|Who does not like all the transformer movies? Great special effects everytime. Worth buying and watching several times. Does not get ld watching.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I like because it's easy to read and have a unsuspected final. I like the way to tell the history
B0034G4P80|5.0|Who does not like thor? Really a good movie. Lots of action. Great plot. One of the better action movies.
1451696191|5.0|Nothing like reading something that has so many details it takes you back to your high school experience in what takes to read a phrase
B004EPYZPS|5.0|This one had a lot of suspense but still was kind of slow moving at the beginning until it picked up speed. Then got very entertaining.
B00AEFVRB2|5.0|2012R: This is the R-rated version that cut's some (but not all) of the explicit chicken scene. Maybe it'll make more people search for the originally released NC-17 version.    Matthew McConaughey does an EXCELLENT job as does Gina Gershon and June Temple (Dottie). William Friedkin (director of \\"The French Connection\\" and \\"The Exorcist\\") still ROCKS!    Think about the title of this movie carefully before watching, because you can't unsee this s#it! MFJLabs 4.5x
B002ZG977Y|5.0|Another great adventue movie. I've seen better but pretty good. After awhile they all kind of seem the same as far as plots go. But still pretty good.
0345803485|5.0|I could read this book over and over again and not find myself bored. Well written and not just about Xrated hush hush topic.. Br Colorful. soulful. Sexual. Timid. Honest. Broken. ...

B004LWZW8I|5.0|Great movie. Lots of good special effects. Great acting in this movie. If you like lots of action this one will fill the bill.
B001NHNG64|5.0|5 ***** Wow. Non stop action, plot twists & excitement!! Reacher gets out of one fix and into another immediately.
B004EPZ07K|5.0|I liked it. Lots of adventure scenes. Glad I bought it. I like shows like this and this one will not disappoint you.
0521397812|5.0|I've had this book for decades and have come to know it as a good friend.  It offers quick teaching ideas but beyond that offers inspiration on how existing materials (textbooks) might be adapted. Highly recommend.
B004LWZW4M|5.0|This show had a little of everything. I liked it. Fast moving movie. Lots of twists and turns in this one.
