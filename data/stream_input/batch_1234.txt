B004INNRFK|5.0|David Fosters & Friends concert is outstanding, with such array of talent on show, Seal & Michael Bolton duet is great and for the pocket rocket Charise well what can you say but stunning, this is a must and I thought that it would be hard to be his first concert but this comes very close.  I look forward to his next installment.
B005M92MJ6|5.0|I love the direction Maynard's music has taken over the years. On this album he gets to showcase the sounds he cannot use with APC or Tool, and I feel like it is some of his best work. There have been other album breakdowns posted on here so I wont go into it, but every track flows beautifully; the production is top notch and the sound is perfect when listened to with a nice set of headphones. Well done!

B000YAA68C|5.0|Girl power!  When I first saw this movie, I felt it was some of the worst casting I had ever seen. However, by the end, I fell in love with this movie!    I love how much she loved her husband. I loved that, in spite of how unhappy she had felt in her life, and how unhappy she was when he was gone, she ended up with her own, successful business.  She found her bliss!

B005ELZKWS|2.0|I'm a big fan of Satriani and Hagar. I was so excited when the first Chickenfoot was about to come out, but it turned out to be a huge disappointment. And this album is no different. It's like all the talents don't merge very well. All the songs sound like demos. I'd recommend to listen to it via youtube or other source before buying it.
B000JLSM00|5.0|As I do in all my reviews, I won't say much about the film, and keep focused on the product.  It is certainly one of the greatest movies of all times, and it goes beyond the western genre.  This film was photographed in VistaVision, a process that used a large negative area, resulting in high definition register. For this transfer, technicians turned to the black and white color separation records, since the original camera negatives had long faded and lost their colors.  Those separations preserve the same image area as the original negative, therefore much of it's original quality.  This blu-ray brings the best possible image quality, extracted from the best surviving elements. Picture has good sharpness and good overall contrast (despite of some high peaks of white, specially in the sky, here and there).   I am quite sure there won't be nothing better available for a long time. And this transfer is as close as we can get from the original theatrical presentation of this classic.  As a collector, I would hope for blu-ray release with a gift set edition, full of collectible items, similar to the DVD Ultimate Collector's Edition.  Unfortunatelly nobody seems to have thought of that.   For now, this blu-ray is a necessary item on any film collection.  Go for it.
B005CKPQNE|1.0|I LOVE BREAKING BAD, BUT I HATED TRYING TO WATCH SEASON 4 ON AMAZON.

1439192812|1.0|I have a real problem with someone like Dawkins, who possesses such unshakeable faith in their own infallibility and who never questions their own worldview.  Especially when such a person would deign to preach to children.    On the one hand we have Dawkins.  On the other we have the sum total of human culture and existence, the distilled views of literally millions of thinking intellects over thousands of years, which Dawkins casually dismisses as mere \\"myths.\\"  There is a tragicomic irony in this: a man who dismisses God with the presumptive authority of a deity; a man who disdains religion yet is a vociferous member of that peculiar sect of faith whose members are known as  \\"Darwinists.\\"    Who knows the real truths of life and existence?  Being merely human, can we ever know?  I personally haven't a clue.  But I do have a compelling intuition in my gut that Dawkins is a clueless fool.  Thus, I cannot recommend this book.  Not even for its entertainment value.  Not even for it potential worth as an emergency supply of bathroom tissue.
0553582038|4.0|Standing alone, A Feast for Crows would be for most of us a two-star book at best. The four star rating here reflects an admittedly hopeful perspective in which this story serves to advance the plot lines, characters, and themes that many excellent reviewers have described very well and which are the main attractions for most readers of this (thus far) powerful series. A Feast for Crows, in and of itself, is a truly unrewarding read. Little occurs that is either interesting or apparently significant in the present moment. The story is seemingly simply a chronicle of incidents with little sound or fury, and signifying... well, hopefully we will find out in a later volume. Much of the novel is remarkably unpleasant in every respect. Martin's ability to create characters who are not one-dimensional (all good or all evil) has been much lauded and is in evidence here, but most of the book is devoted to people of diverse affiliations who are unremittingly unpleasant. Many are physically ugly, and a fairly large number get maimed and become uglier still. The sites visited are similarly dominated by dark, damp, ruined places.  Most of what happens turns on acts of violence, betrayal, cruelty, and malice, and little good comes to anyone. Churning through endless pages focused on these things makes for a really oppressive experience not so much because we need the \\"good guys\\" to clobber the \\"bad guys\\" -- seeing preferred characters experience defeat is one of the surprisingly powerful aspercts of the earlier books, and I think most readers can handle that -- but when all the gloom leads us nowhere at all, then it really is just gloom. Like some other reviewers, I found the book to be annoying, boring, pointless (taken on its own), and powerfully unpleasant.  So -- why four stars?  Well, my hope and reasonable expectation is that this volume is setting up something else, and that all of the above will set the table for movement, excitement, and ultimately the strong emotionaland conceptual provocations that most of us believe Martin can accomplish. As I read A Feast for Crows, my own assumption was that Martin is trying to parallel life, where protracted periods in which nothing big happens, nothing is learned or made clear, etc., can slowly unfold as incremental, seemingly invisible little things eventually cause the balance to tip, and an explosion of action to follow. That's my hope, and it's why I read this book. Otherwise, I would surely have set it as a pointless, oppressive, unrewarding read.
1933633867|5.0|Debt is a simple reality of everyday human interaction and at the same time a great moral calculus that rationalizes terrible suffering. It's power ranges from telling someone, \\"I owe you one\\", to the fateful words more and more Americans hear everyday: \\"The bank will be taking your house\\". Debt is both a thing that can be sold, traded, and securitized, as well as a space in which the most basic of human relationships begin.  David Graeber, an anthropologist currently at Goldsmiths, University of London, but also an organizer in the Occupy Wall Street movement, has carefully and systematically sorted out the antinomies that surround the moral arithmetic of debt with the revealing bifocal lens of historical anthropology. His book is revolutionary in its answers to the what he says is the Great Question of debt; it is easy to understand, drawing on anthropology's fascinating ability to shine a light on the ordinary; it is also sweeping, tackling ancient and modern economies. If you have ever been interested in why humans structure relationships around debt, this is an important book.  Graeber begins the book by challenging the founding myths of economics. Theories of capital always evolve out of the impossibility of a barter economy, but Graeber presents compelling evidence to the contrary, demonstrating that no such barter economics ever existed. Debt, instead, has been with us from the very beginning. Debt is a relationship between two people who are \\"equals in those ways that are truly important\\", but are currently in a state of inequality, a state that must be resolved. Both parties seek to restore equality, but of interest are the things happen on that path to restoring equality. Debt as a temporary relationship of mutual need is far older than money, and has its own rules.  His path to understanding the rules of debt, its importance in human relationships, and where debt goes wrong, is found in an examination of the the history of debt culture. The meat of the book is in Graeber's ability to step into and out of the currents and popular belief systems present in these cultures. He examines ancient Sumeria and the Old Testament kingdoms, where periodic resets of debt maintained systemic stability. These Jubilees destroyed the relationships that debt created, but saved people from debt peonage, a practice that many ancients saw as tantamount to slavery. Medieval Islamic empires kept a strict separation between market and government, thus the emphasis was on honor, a subject he investigates at great length because of its own status as a currency. Graeber's historical analysis can be so expansive that it is sometimes confusing, but the payoff is worth it when the big picture is realized.  By the time Graeber reaches our modern world, he has begun to reveal that the \\"moral arithmetic\\" of debt can only be a product of violent enforcement of obligation; however, the contemporary system of obligation is entirely upside down. While we believe everyone has to pay their debts, this is demonstrably false, as the most powerful corporate entities in the world effectively had their debts paid for them in 2008. Coercion, the gun behind the loan documentation, reduces us to bare mathematics, often justifying what would otherwise be disgusting violations of life and liberty. Graeber concludes that we are quickly moving toward a new Jubilee, a cancelling of debts that will restore society. For him, the mutability of the rules of debt is our salvation, and history gives us many examples to learn from.  I can't recommend this book enough.
1439192812|5.0|Richard Dawkins hits another home run with this beautiful book about how we know what we know about reality.  The chapters typically start out with the many myths humankind have invented to explain things they didn't understand, which is quite interesting in and of itself, than it goes to explain the \\"reality\\" of it with facts and science. Seen in this way, it really shows how much we have grown up in this world. However, some of the myths mentioned are unfortunately believed today by the majority of people, so in a sense, we haven't grown up all that much. These are the best of times and the worst of times.  A must book for teenagers and adults who want to know a bit of science and want to know \\"how\\" we know what we know. The illustrations make it analogous to a Stephen Hawkings book but is done with more personality that is reflective of Dawkins. This should be mandatory reading to clear up the fog of confusion between superstition and science. This will be a book that will be read multiple times.

B005PMNBNG|4.0|There is an audio glitch at the end of the track titled Fountains.  It's not a big deal, but it IS noticeable.  Be aware, the audio glitch is at the very END of the track . . . . a few seconds after the music of Fountains has faded away.  In order to determine whether or not this was an issue with Amazon MP3 or an issue with the iTunes Store, I bought the track from both.  The audio glitch is on the music file from BOTH Amazon MP3 and the iTunes Store.  For additional confirmation of this audio glitch, I went to the band's official website.  On the main page, I scrolled down and found a section that has a link that allows the album to be listened to online.  To my surprise, the audio glitch was on it, too.  I wonder if M83 knows about this.  I also wonder if the audio glitch is on the physical CD.  Like I said, it's no big deal.  As far as the album is concerned, I like Hurry Up, We're Dreaming.  It has numerous great tracks.  I also love some of the remixes of Midnight City . . . . which are available on the Midnight City EP.  I hope M83 releases remixes of some of the other tracks from Hurry Up, We're Dreaming.
B005WGBQ9G|5.0|This season premiere does not disappoint. The characters act like really people. Mainly stupid with bouts of breathtaking beauty. The zombies are fantastic! Blood and guts and torn away lips, oh my. And if loving Norman Reedus's dirty, redneck character is wrong then I don't want to be right! Do yourself a favor, don't watch the premier until the second episode comes out; the cliffhanger is a doozy! I really wish I had waited.

B0002XVQNU|1.0|If you mix Tim Burton's Batman and The Crow and Dracula?!!!!!Then add miscasted actor's with a really lame script pathetic fight sceens and what do you get? you get Dare Devil. Another great comic book character butchered by Hollywood.  Here are some obvious comparisons  The Crow: Brandon Lee gets revenge on one of his killers and leaves a flaming crow as a calling card  Dare Devil: Ben afflac (yes the spelling is on porpose)kills a thug by tossing him into the tracks of an on coming train then a police detective throws a cigarette and lights up a flaming DD to reveal Dare Devil's calling card.  Then we see Dare Devil on a church roof top (clearly a tim Burton moment here folks!) How can you go from New York City by day to a fantasy Gothic city by night? Please explain this to me?  Why is Dare Devil sleeping in a coffin type chamber? Since when is Dare Devil a Vampire?  Why is Colin Farrell a lame Bullseye with a really bad irish accient?  Jennifer Garner (poorly casted)makes for a lame elektra with a lame back history. She's not a good actress anyway like EVERY ACTOR IN THIS POOR EXCUSE FOR A MOVIE!!!!!!!!!  Michael Clarke Duncan another miscasted actor in the role of the Kingpin.   The fight scene between Dare Devil anf Elektra is slow, predictable and unbelievably stupid. (when DD throws up his stick in the air then fights Elektra and after they pause he catches his stick! Give me a break!)  Another lame scene. When a young Matt discoveres his powers and magically knows how to do flips and know how to fight. REALLY?!!!!!   I can go on and on about this lame film but I digress. Don't waste your time or money on this lame excuse of a super hero movie. You're better off watching the Green Lantern, at least that one is better and tries where Dare Devil there clearly was no effort in its creation!

B000XA5K4I|5.0|This movie lives up to its title tenfold.  There are just some movies that achieve a certain perfection within what they are trying to achieve.  In this case it's to entertain audience with senseless violence, sex and mayhem.  There's not really a plot to worry about, you can sit back in your chair, open your favorite beverage and watch Clive Owen shoot bad guys.  Monica Bellucci [The Maxtrix Reloaded] is as lovely as ever, but is relegated to an on-screen sex object.  Without giving away a spoiler, she has one action scene with Clive that is unique and leaves quite an impression.  This is not a movie to watch with a significat other for \\"Date Night\\".  It has been proudly added to my DVD rack section of \\"Man Movies\\" of which I'm sure my wife will never violate.  If you like a lot of shooting [like \\"Last Man Standing\\"] then this movie is for you.  This comes with my highest recommendation!
0316098329|5.0|This book did not interest me in the beginning.  However, I stuck with it and it turned out to be FABULOUS.  I was very intrigued by the characters and the situation.  The author did a fantastic job developing the plot and creating a wonderfully real story.  There were a few parts in the book that I had a difficult time believing, but for the most part it was believable.  This book was a GREAT read.
B005EY2XFC|5.0|The Crow on Blu-Ray just rocks... the picture quality is clear, solid and pretty much no grain especially considering it takes place at night all the time and in the dark. Just amazing! Not quite reference but the sound...oh boy, for DTS 5.1, it just destroys many others. I highly recommend this purchase! :)  On another note (rant), it could've used some updated blu-ray extras, but then again, almost all new blu-rays have the DVD standard def extras on them anyway, which could mean they don't care about extras that much, but it's also because they're now using VC-1 codec and AAC audio that HD-DVD used, instead of MPEG-2 and uncompressed PCM audio, so that's all they can fit on 1 disc. If you remember, there were no extras, period, on earlier blu-rays, unless it appeared on a 2nd disc. Perhaps since Blu-Ray has no competition anymore, they can do whatever they want I guess...

B000JML90Y|5.0|Those who wrote poor reviews of this book obviously simply could not read this book. That's why so many books teaching Darwin's views have been written. Do the hard work. Read this book. Cover to cover. It will elucidate your entire existence upon this planet.<br />I differ with Darwin only in this; I believe that God created us through evolution. I believe that if Darwin had lived a little longer, he would have made this leap, as well.<br />Charles Darwin was the most intelligent human whose words I have ever read.<br />Do not deprive yourself of this education.
B000H4QD1O|5.0|Exceptional science fiction that doesn't bore you with technobabble (hint: Voyager) and is character and story driven (hint: DS9).  Unlike how Fox aired it, needs to be watched in order to understand.  The depth of character development is unusual for television, and the humor is sophisticated, even when it isn't.  There is a decidedly western theme, which *does* make sense given the totality of the circumstances.  No aliens, no theatrics, just interesting stories about interesting people in an interesting time.  The best TV series that shouldn't have been cancelled.  If you are a true scifi fan, you've already seen it.  If you like scifi and want to see something MORE than laser gun fights, warp drives and Kirk making it with green space babes, you will like it.
030788743X|5.0|\\"Ready Player One\\" was a page turner for me.  I am not a gamer - I just don't have the patience.  Reading \\"Ready Player One\\" was like sitting next to an expert gamer playing the most complicated game ever.  The boredom that arises when you don't know what to do next was eliminated, because you were with someone who Knows Everything.    The book is the story of a teenage gamer living about 40 years from now. The US and the world have continued to decline into poverty, and Wade Watts actually lives with a grudging aunt and her serial men friends in one of a stack of trailers.  Wade and just about everyone else spend most of their days immersed in a virtual reality world, called OASIS, that offers them a much better virtual life than they can live in the real world.  As the story begins, Wade has been searching, along with the rest of humanity, for solutions to a puzzle hidden in OASIS by James Halliday, its fabulously wealthy creator.  Halliday is dead, and in his will he left his entire fortune to whomever could \\"win\\" his game.    Conflict arises primarily from a group of players called \\"Sixers\\", corporate drones who play to win the prize for the mega-corporation that, if it wins, will make OASIS just another playground of the rich (adding fees and other commercializing features).  The Sixers  have the advantage of endless personnel and endless money employed to pursue the prize, as well as being willing to kill (in the real world) anyone in their way.  We follow Wade and his few friends (all met online) on their quests through the real and virtual worlds to win the prize and evade the Sixers.  A good part of the fun is that Halliday grew up in the 1980s, and filled the universe of OASIS with references to, and items from, 80s pop culture.  As a result, Wade's quest is full of references that will be dear to anyone alive during the 80s.  One of Wade's tasks, for example, is to play the Matthew Broderick character in a recreation of the movie \\"Wargames\\".  If he missestoo many lines of dialogue, Wade will lose the game and have to start over.    As you may be able to tell from the above, \\"Ready Player One\\" is full of twists and clever references that I enjoyed immensely, and I highly recommend it to anyone to generally likes puzzles.
B005KMX866|4.0|I still can't help but feel it could be a tad better.<br /><br />Chris Isaak is a wonderful musician, and from what I've seen in person once and heard on previous albums, I would expect an album like this.  Chris covers 2 discs worth of songs by the original Sun Studios artists.  This album is what I expected and even a bit more at times.  Chris Isaak puts out an effort that doesn't reinvent these tracks but rather tries to recreate them in a tribute to the originals.  I applaud the purpose behind this tactic, but these types of covers can be difficult to pull off especially for well known tracks.<br /><br />When it comes to the music, it shouldn't be a surprise that the best tracks are probably going to be of the songs you are less familiar with.  Chris Isaak puts forth a good effort, but it will be tough to hear an artist cover songs like Ring of Fire, Great Balls of Fire, or Pretty Woman and feel that they are great when the originals are engrained in your mind and were nearly perfect to begin with.  This is how I felt on listening to those songs specifically, but those songs aren't bad... And, there are 25 songs on the album, and Chris puts a lot of soul into the music there.<br /><br />Chris does put fantastic renditions of two Elvis hits, Can't Hel Falling in Love and It's Now or Never, forth.  In-fact, It's Now or Never is so good, it might make you think Elvis never really died.  Specifically, the climax of the song is as fantastic as Elvis's rendition.  Sadly, it's that song that makes me wish the three previously mentioned tracks had that type of soul.  Fortunately, the other 22 songs do have a lot of soul.<br /><br /> Another track I love is one I don't know the original of, I Forgot to Remember You.  I just love how Chris makes this song sound like his own.  That's how I end up feeling on most of the remaining tracks, most that I am not very familiar with.  There are even two tracks that are written by Chris Isaak.  They fit in nicely and showcase his talents right up there along those he is paying tribute to.  This is definitely a 4+ star album.<br /><br />Last, I recommend the CD version for the added booklet.  It really complements the CD well and gives you the story behind the album and Chris Isaak, too.  My only complaint is that the original artists aren't discussed.  Granted, one could look up the artists via Wikipedia, Google, etc, but the package would have benefited with a reference to the original artists of the songs.<br /><br />Most music fans will love this album, and many will probably find it a 5 star recording.aying tribute to.

B004HW7JMO|5.0|This is a prequel to Blood and Sand, the first season of Spartacus.  You get to find out how The House of Batiatus rose to power.  John Hannah's and Lucy Lawless's characters are as conniving as ever.  What they did to wrench the business out of his father's hands might shock you.  But if you saw the first season, really, nothing they do will shock you!  The plot focuses on Gannicus, their prize gladiator.  Dustin Clare is great as Gannicus.  You do get to see some familiar faces like Manu Bennett and Peter Mensah (my favorite) who reprise their roles.  It was nice seeing some back story on Peter Mensah's character, and how he became the gladiators' trainer. Excellent story line.  Excellent performances from the actors.
1416972242|4.0|This series is getting more and more interesting the longer I read it. I am ready for book three and am excited to see where things go from here.

This is not what she expected either, but book three will enhance this.<br /><br />Really great read for Paranormal lovers.
B003PIUBZS|5.0|A friend told me about Spartacus: Blood and Sand.  He said, \\"It's like watching a Saturday matinee when you were a kid, only it's bloodier.\\"  Well, he was right.  So many other reviews have gone into the plot. The action scenes reminded me of those in the film, 300.  Very violent, stop-action to illustrate the movements of the combatants, and lots of blood and gore, making you want to squeeze your eyes shut. You get all the excitement, the action, the pathos that you felt when you were in that darkened theater shoving popcorn in your mouth.  Although now you're an adult and the story on screen is replete with adult themes like bold sexuality, a complex plot, back-stabbing, social climbing at its deadliest.  I have to give the writers a shout out.  They let it rip, no holds barred.  The actors also went for broke.  Andy Whitfield was excellent as the title character.  Although his role was very physical he was also capable of displaying human emotions.  You really will root for his character.  So sorry to hear he lost his battle with cancer.
B00008WT5E|5.0|That Chet Young guy knows of what he speaks. Sin City and Down Payment Blues, two of the most perfect, hard-drinking b#*%#!tch-banging songs ever. And I don't mean just AC/DC songs, of all recorded rock.  These 2 songs do everything, slow to fast, low to high, soft to hard, little to b-b-big. What I love the most about each tho is that toward the end, they both come to a near stop, then slowly build again to an orgasmic crescendo and BOOM...Knock you out! That is not easy to do if the lack of it from so many other bands thru history in any indication. It is the heart of blues rock.  AC/DC made it their hallmark. God Save Their Queen!

1609611543|3.0|I found WHEAT BELLY by Dr. William Davis to be very interesting. As a newly diagnosed diabetic, I have found that carbs are not my friend in the amounts I normally eat them, including fruit. So more information about wheat and gluten and their effects on diabetes was very informative to me. This can be very dangerous because of the way it effects our blood sugar. I found out that it is even worse than plain old sugar I put in coffee or tea. Dr. Davis showed in the book the way wheat not only plays a part in diabetes but also in heart and Celiac disease and to my surprise, dementia! Of course, it also adds to the national emergency of obesity in our country. His book is written in hopes that people will come to realize that wheat plays a very important part in leading a long life of good health. There are easy directions on how to start to eat a low carb and wheat free diet and the recipes that are included are easy to follow for those who like to cook. I think the information was interesting and benefical to everyone who wants to live a healthy life style.

Even though its 3.5 hours long it goes by quite quickly.  A few observations, I thought it was probably a little bit top heavy with the Beatle years.  I realise the Beatles were a huge defining moment of Georges career but a lot of it has been covered before, particularly in the anthology DVD's, so if your a Beatle fan you will have seen a lot of it before.  About 1 hr 45 minutes of it are the Beatle years. They miss a lot of the latter years which i would have liked more of.  For example, no mention of the Somewhere in England Album which had the single All those years ago, written after John Lennons death and released in tribute. No real footage of his reaction to Johns death. Also no mention of Cloud 9 and Got my mind set on you, his biggest single bar My sweet lord which kicked off his comeback in the late 80's.  Also no mention he was sued for plagurism on My sweet lord etc.  There is a lot missing.  Having said that, there is a good bit i didnt know too and its great to see McCartney, Ringo, Clapton, the Phytons, F1 drivers etc etc all talking and sharing stories about the man himself. One tit bit I didnt know, Paul siad when he wrote And I love her, he played it for George and George said it needs a guitar riff and on the spot came up with 4 notes that make the intro to the song and run through the it.  As Paul said, that is the song and he wrote it, very generous credit given from Paul.  As for Blu-ray vs DVD, the DVD is probably just as good, most of the footage was recorded before the days of high definition so probably dont need the blu-ray, a few bucks dearer. However the quality is excellent.  All in all, if your a Beatles fans you will enjoy it and if youre a nuetral, looking to find out some stuff on George and the Beatles, again it should be an enjoyable watch.  What does shine true is what a good littlesong writer George actually was, he just happened to be in a band with Lennon and McCartney, what are the  the odds on that.
B0057MFA42|1.0|Absolutely pathetic that the company involved with pressing this rubbish now want you to believe it's your fault your blu ray disc is out of sync. Do the right thing. Issue a recall. Because the whole planet is experiencing this major issue with the release, and believe me, I've tried all the things you suggest and it's not me or by broadcast quality equipment. It's you and your flawed quality control process. Why would this not occur on every other music blu ray if it's indeed a user settings issue?
B003E8P9G0|5.0|riordan does it again. I love Greek, Egyptian, and Roman history. I was able to understand the characters quite well. I highly recommend this book!!!!!!
B0009X766Y|4.0|Product arrived in great shape as advertised. No delays. Great movie, enjoyed it. It truly is a classic film with great actors.
B001SS3JS8|5.0|this book was probably one of the most incredible books i've ever read. i started it and set it down, picked it back up a week or two later and in a matter of three days i finished this book. it was the most inspiring books i've ever read. i have never cried so hard over a book in my life. this is a must have. and i recommend it to any and everyone
B000MD9UJC|5.0|I've used a Mini Mag-lights with two AA batteries for many years.  They are sturdy and reliable.  The incandescent bulb in the original version eventually burns out, but there's always been a spare in the tail end cap (until you use that one and then forget to replace it).  One thing I never liked was that, to turn the light on or off, one had to twist the headpiece, which changed the focus of the flashlight.  I bought this kit over a year ago, and I have to say it's a great retrofit.  The kit includes a replacement reflector, an LED bulb, and a tail cap with a pushbutton switch in it.  It just takes a couple of minutes to install.  The light is about 100% brighter, the bulb has lasted much longer than incandescent bulbs did (maybe it'll last forever), the batteries last much longer, and there's no more de-focusing to turn on and off.  My opinion: all positives, no negatives, and it pays for itself quickly in reduced battery and bulb replacement costs.
B005JU5JTI|1.0|It's amazing how far celebrities will go to make some money.  I can only assume that's the only reason why those that participated in this film decided to do so.  I'd hoped that this movie would be a fun and witty comedy to enjoy...but was very disappointed.  Basically, it was just a piece trash.  Sorry that young and misled minds that haven't been exposed to real comedy will probably think it's funny.  That's also very telling of how much the entertainment industry has gradually watered down the content in its films making dumb films like this one look appealing to teenagers.  Mea culpa, mea culpa!! Should've followed my gut instinct and dismissed this one!!!
B004SBQALA|5.0|I've watched it 4 times and can hardly wait for the sequel. Too bad my favorite actor Timothy Oliphant won't be there in the next one.
0470876417|5.0|I read this book first form a .pdf, and after reading it, I bought the book because I considered the author deserved the royalties of selling it.   It is an easy to read that provides a very useful and easy to implement approach to devise business models. It includes many examples.  As the book makes use of colors and contains many graphics and pictures, I find it is not a good book to be read in a b&w kindle.
B0052GACNM|5.0|I have been buying TONY BENNETT music since 1950.  I have every album he has released and every single he has released.  DUETS 2 took me by surprise.  Its just BEAUTIFUL.  Tony's son Dae mixed these songs for his dad and he will earn a grammy for his brilliant work!  Tony will earn a grammy for this work of art as well. I have listened to the album countless times and still want to hear more.  How Tony does it at 85 is unknown but I hope he never stops singing!    The artists who accompany Tony in this album are all great!  Tony and his guests make beautiful music together.  I'd love to hear more of Tony with Lady Gaga.  THE Lady Is a Tramp  recording is a great rendition of the old song!  Tony and Lady Gaga make it seem freshly written and are positively brilliant working together.  The duet with Carrie Underwood is also magnificent.  It Had To Be You is a great song to begin with but Tony and Carrie make you feel as if they were singing it directly to you.   Body and Soul with Tony and the late Amy Winehouse was beyond comparison. I am truly saddened by her untimely death at such a young age.  May she rest in peace.  I could go on and on but that might bore you.  You really need to hear this fine album.  It is #1 in the USA for a reason. Its a tribute to great music.  No gimmicks; just singing!  Tony has been that way all of his illustrious career and he sees no reason to change anything now. What a voice and what a man:  Mr. Tony Bennett.

B00007E7K0|3.0|It's pretty overpriced for a piece of plastic.  But if you like your Canon products to match, then this is the way to go.  Just don't lose anymore caps b/c it adds up.
0596806027|2.0|This is a nice book if you're just interested in the newer features of HTML5 and are acquainted with previous versions. I was disappointed because I was looking for a complete HTML reference and guessed it made sense to buy a book about the latest version. It's not a bad book, it only contains a fraction of the information I expected.
B004I654WQ|5.0|Kids love cars and so do adults.  Entertaining, not too long.  Buyer beware, if you have children, they will want everything Cars related after watching. vroom vroom vroom.
034552554X|5.0|This was a beautifully written book and told as if the writer had been a part of the story.  A story of love, caring and how we tend to judge other people by their looks, circumstances, etc.  The author's insight is amazing.  Once I started reading the book, I could not put it down.  Being a foster child is not by their choice but by their parent and one should think twice before giving up a child to adoption.  Sometimes the adoptive parent turns out to be better, however.  All, I think, we all want is to be loved and feel needed.  Excellent book, excellent writing!!!!

0307720748|5.0|This is one fabulously entertaining book.  And it's motivating.  A great read and a great inspiration.  It's not so much about what to do in business...it's about what Branson did and how he did it and the guts and sometimes bulls..t he used to get things done.
0553807919|4.0|I thought this book was easy to read and very thought provoking.  I feel that I already raise my childern in a similar order as suggested by this book, so I thought the suggestions were very good.
B005J7K964|3.0|I saw this in a sneak preview showing a week or more before the theatrical opening of the Moroder version. I got a free poster (which I still have) and a copy of the soundtrack LP. I was practically the only person in the theater. I was running a video store at the time and have always been a big movie buff so this was a treat. Prior to this 1984 release, the existing version was a terrible transfer from aged and damaged film stock. This version did a lot to bring the film back into the public consciousness and for that we should always be grateful. We may not have had the great restored kino version if not for this.  I hope it's clear that I am definitely not one of the naysayer crowd regarding the Moroder version.  All of that said, and my enduring affection for Lang's film aside, the Moroder soundtrack has not aged well and was far from perfect in '84. Remember, the '80s is not a decade known for all-time classic music (or for that matter, all-time classic anything). Some of the songs are frankly embarrassing, almost to the level of 1981's Heavy Metal the Motion Picture. If you recall the Moroder Metropolis soundtrack fondly, bear in mind you may be thinking of it in relation to the time and thinking of the best songs. Check out the Amazon page for the soundtrack and play some of the track samples to remind yourself what it really sounded like. Loverboy? Billy Squier? These artists went the way of the Chrysler K Car. If Freddy Mercury hadn't died, he'd be the only artist of the bunch worth listening to today.  This is the danger of using pop music to score a film, which instantly dates the project to a distracting degree. That's why they've remade Footloose (originally of the same year, 1984), because nobody can listen to the soundtrack with a straight face today (some of the same artists, Bonnie Tyler, Loverboy).  If Moroder was dead set on using modern music he should have stuck with a single artist that knew how to score a motion picture, such as Tangerine Dream (see 1977's Sorcerer), Danny Elfman, Ryuichi Sakamoto, David Byrne, etc., all of which were doing scores around that period.
B00000G28U|4.0|Realy fine. Just a pity he did not understand that the disk censored lyrics. And when a song sounds, just squeaking in columns like on TV. For the seller no complaints.
B005GSVFAK|1.0|$37.49? You've got to be kidding me. Why do I need a SECOND blu-ray in the package of the SAME movie? I just want the 3D Blu-ray. 3D Blu-rays play in 2D on regular players so I don't need a second 2D disc, even if I wanted to play it in 2D which I don't, otherwise I'd buy -- concentrate hard now -- the 2D version of the film!  Let me say that again just so it sinks in. If I wanted the 2D version of the film, I'd buy the 2D version of the freaking film.  Don't make me pay for an idiotic digital copy on disc either. if I'm so technically incompetent I need someone to create a digital copy for me, just provide a download code.  Quit throwing in the kitchen sink, 5 discs is ridiculous.  \\"I spent the money on the 3D TV, I have none left for overpriced 3D movies\\". And studios complain that 3D isn't taking off. If the studios aren't withholding top movies as exclusive bundles, they're charging exorbitant prices for them. Same problem with theatrical 3D.
B003O57L1Y|5.0|This is one of my all-time favorite progressive rock cds.  Excellent playing from all four musicians. I was especially surprised by Chris Botti's excellent trumpet playing.  It added a unique dynamic to this excellent recording.  Highly recommended.
B004VF68AQ|4.0|Eric left while saying, douche  Perry Farrell knows the truth:  Dave can play  Steve can pound  But with no Eric?  Berstein! Put Jane in the ground!  Don't get me wrong -   These songs are good  The music fun  But, Jane's Addiction are long gone...
B001P9KR94|5.0|i'm not much of foreign film so i went to watch this movie back in 2009, man what a story, the directing was really great + one of favorite my game show is \\" who want to be a millionaire \\"-regis philben. one of the best scence  no spoiler  is the restroom scence near the end of the movie. you know what i'm talking about if you watched the movie. wow!! truely stunned. i got my copy of blue ray slumdog millionaire for $ 5?? yesterday and i'm planning to watch the movie tonight. hopefuly i get to watch some extra contents. i personally recommanded to everyone who is looking for a story about love, triumph and tragedy. 5 stars all around.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|I first saw Adele perform on the VMA's and was VERY impressed by her range and beautiful voice- it has so much depth to it. I have to say, the UK seems to be producing some very talented singers and I for one am glad for it. Adele's 21 album is wonderful in its entirety, as every song has a different sound and lyrics that make your heart ache. This album is truly worth owning and listening to every day and I can't wait for her next album to come out.
B005JE7WKI|4.0|We really enjoyed watching this movie. I laughed out loud at a couple of different points. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars, is because the trailer for the movie had me rolling on the floor laughing. The movie wasn't nearly as funny. How does that happen?
B0055SWM08|5.0|Well-made! Priced right. Plenty of fun and challenging through paced progression. I hope the devs make more; it was my pleasure to purchase. For 99 cents you can't go wrong with this one.
B0058OUJA4|1.0|Deleted it when I saw that it was nothing more than a ripoff and a clone of one of the most respected TD games around. I'm not convinced this dev even made a token effort to make something of his own, instead essentially stealing Geodefense and publishing it for Android. No good. I won't support devs like this. Glad I didn't actually pay any money for this.
B005HV6Y5W|1.0|I don't normally review movies but this was SOOOOO BAD that I had to save others from wasting their time.  After the first 30mins I was extremely irritated, annoyed and thoroughly confused. The confusion came about because I couldn't understand why anyone would produce, direct, publish or watch more than 30mins of this movie.  If you like just looking at pretty pictures then this is the movie for you. The movies has no substance, plot, direction, cohesion, or VALUE!  This tree of life sucked the life out of me.  Safe yourself the time, you will be more entertained by watching your trees live their lives.
0545259088|5.0|Fell in love with this trilogy. The author is wonderful and this book, forever, is a great ending.  Read these books!
B005JU5JTI|1.0|If you are a teacher or know a teacher, you are going to hate how the movie glosses over serious teacher misconduct. No, I'm not talking about the cussing or lewdness or drunkenness, which is giggle-worthy once you suspend your disbelief for a couple of hours, but getting away with serious standardized test misconduct? Um, no, that's too far over the line to stay in the comedy range, especially when the guilty party is rewarded and suffers no ill effects from such a punishable offense.  Cameron Diaz and Lucy Punch do their best with what they have been given, but Justin Timberlake's acting and character are equally atrocious.
B004QZ9PLU|3.0|Slow at the beginning and then I got sucked into the story .  Starting plowing through the book to where it kept me up at night.  Was so disappointed when the end loomed as predictable as could be.  All told, a true Nicholas Spark's story however.
0553801473|4.0|I'm a GRRM late bloomer, but hey, better late than never. I ordered the first four novels right before the HBO show started, and tore through them. I only waited a few months for A Dance with Dragons- I can't imagine waiting five years. I finished this one in about a week.<br /><br />If you were let down by Feast for Crows, ADWD is a definite improvement. It paralells AFFC for the first half and then joins the two storylines in the last half. It's not perfect- Dany is mired in an insurgency, and its as tedious on the page sometimes as it is in the news, but there is a payoff that is worth the price. Jon Snow is forced to play politics with Stannis at the Wall, but Melisandre has grown on me to the point that I really enjoy her appearances. The Greyjoy characters have yet to capture my interest- I understood the point of Theon from earlier novels, but his uncles and their exploits so far have had very little point. The novel's pluses are good ones though: Tyrion is back and in rare form, Bran is back and headed north, and Arya stalks the streets of the Free Cities honing her new trade. Even the Dornish chapters managed to hold my attention, and they were tough going when I read AFFC. And of course there are the requisite surprises: Tyrion's travel companions have a secret, a character everyone hated turns tragically sympathetic, the aforementioned Dany payoff/cliffhanger, and then...but I'll leave that one alone.<br /><br />In summary, ADWD is a setup book as the series starts aiming toward its ending, and suffers for that, but it both surprises and advances the plot enough to be very enjoyable. But seriously George, get Dany moving. I can't wait to see where it goes from here.
B00005LC1H|5.0|Wonderful collection and quality at a teriffic price. Probably the finest or one of the finest series of all time.
B002ZG981E|4.0|I went to sleep one evening, dreaming of a me without an exhausting work schedule. That me had more free time, but still had kids to tire him out. That me then fell asleep and dreamed of a me with no children. That me was actually able to go to the movies from time to time. Once, that me went to see Inception. He fell asleep in the theater.   But seriously, you should see Inception. It's pretty good.
B0058VW36U|5.0|Addictive like Angry birds but easier to calculate. after I played all the levels I still had to go back to unlock achievements and increase my score.  I can't wait for updates as every new level brings more addictive game play.  Excellent job!
0345529057|5.0|If you're a fan of the show and want to get caught up on the first four books, this is the easiest way to do it. No frills, just a few thousand pages of GRRM's brutal world of Westeros.
B0059F7I24|2.0|Just like you should never judge a book by it's cover, don't judge a band by their live performances.  I recently saw this band open for Dream Theater in Washington, DC.  The show was great.  Trivium was energetic and fun to watch, despite the fact that they had just flown in from Japan.  The lead singer kept spitting on the stage every 2 or 3 minutes which was kind of annoying.  I feel bad for the photographers that they had taking \\"action shots\\"; at least one of them received a face-full of spit.  Anyway, I digress.    I had never before listened to Trivium and after the great show they put on, I decided to pick up In Waves from Amazon.  As I listened to the album, I became bored quickly.  They start off pretty heavy and keep that pace through the bulk of the album.  But the lyrics - good lord - they are so repetitive!  Frankly, it feels very amatuerish when the title of each song is also the chorus of each song.  I really want to like this band but the quality of the lyrics is very prohibitive.  But enough of the negative.  What is great about this album is the drummer.  He has some fast feet!  When I saw them live, he was great through every song. On this album, he is equally impressive.  He doesn't have a huge kit but he makes due with what he has and really does a fantastic job.  Instrumentally, the album is decent - not great, but pretty good.  The guitars and bass are nice and crunchy, and the vocals are quite good.    Ok, I lied, a little more of the negative.  I wish this band would decide whther they are going to be a metalcore band or a pop-metal top 40 band.  As I listened to the album, everything was sounding good and crunchy but then I hit Built to Fall.  <crickets chirping>  In it's own right, it is a halfway decent song, but it is obvious how different it is from the rest of the album.  Everything else sounds like they were playing the music they like to play, but when it gets to this one song, it seems as if the record label stepped in and said \\"you guys need to have a song we can play on the radio\\"...  Fine, but it's pretty awkward, not at all complex, and even the drummer seems like he fell asleep while recording it.  In short, if you like a crunchy-sounding metalcore band, these guys are worth a listen, despite my 2-star rating.  Why they were playing with Dream Theater, I'll never understand, but I suppose record labels force all kinds of strange marriages...
B004EPZ07U|4.0|UltraViolet Digital Copy is not a digital copy, but a way to stream the content to devices other than what you really want.  Avoid spending extra money on this package and buy the DVD or Blu Ray on its own.
B005ELQVGW|1.0|i am so glad i did not buy this dud, I borrowed it from a friend, and i was glad to give it back. There is nothing great or good, there is nothing but alot of noise, this cd is Un-listenable. I am a big fan, but this, well....until she starts to record some real good music like she once did a few cd back, I wont be buying this junk. this cd sucks. Its a big mess. too bad for such a great singer. What is she thinking. Its not art or music. its just BAD. Buy at your own risk.
B000H4QD1O|5.0|This show is so imaginative - the characters are great and the actors cast wonderful. I wish it had continued  a few years.
B005CS3VQ0|5.0|This is the best book on translation I have read. I am a professional translator (American who does German to English, and I live in Germany). The book is not bogged down in the typical pedantic \\"linguist-speak\\" that you usually find in books about translation. The author ranges far and wide, from oral interpreting, to Biblical translation, to Google Translate and machine translation. I particularly liked his exploding of myths (the \\"Eskimo Vocabulary Hoax\\", and the myth that because Spanish and Chinese have a lot of speakers, that makes them big translation languages). The author shows that only 5 % of books from 2000-2009 were translated into Chinese (into Arabic is even more dismal). Only 10% of books were translated into English in that period, which shocked me as an \\"into English\\" translator. The author cites a figure that 78% of books in that period were into just two languages: French and German, which is truly amazing. This means that English, German, and French are by far the most important languages for translation, particularly for literature and books. It also shows that Americans and Brits don't read foreign books (!).   A good portion of this book is about what translation is. The notion of translating \\"sense for sense\\", not \\"word for word\\" is of course good advice, and very old advice. The author handles things like, what do we mean by \\"literal translation\\", and why it is harder to translate Asterix than Proust.   I loved the discussion of \\"UP translation\\" and \\"DOWN translation\\". (I won't tell you what that is, you have to read the book).   All-in-all, probably the best book I have ever read about translation, and very accessible to anyone, translators and people just interested in language. I can't recommend this book more.   A must read for translators.

But after his 5th birthday everything has to change & he must find out about the world in 'outer space' to protect he & his Ma from harm.<br /><br />This is truly an amazing read. I had never read any of Emma Donohgue's books before & was convinced to read this from a friend of mine & I am so glad I did. I thought it was going to be an awful book when I read the first few lines but I became addicted very quick! Soon I had to spend hours reading it because I was getting so into the book! It is just shocking how this book can be talking about such a horrible situation but have an innocence that comes with the fact that is spoken through Jacks eyes.<br /><br />I very highly recommend this book it is truly money well spent!

1455510319|4.0|So here I am, giving a four-star review to a novel that has received more 1-star reviews than it has received 5-star reviews. What a turnabout. I have to say that of Connelly's Mickey Haller novels, I've read only \\"The Lincoln Lawyer\\" and this one, \\"The Fifth Witness.\\" I've enjoyed them both. In this one, I like the hero, from whose point of view we see the action. I like the pacing, though it does get a bit slow in the middle, and the beating seems forced, just for the sake of having the hero beat up. I really like the way the courtroom scenes are rendered. I could see the ending (I should say \\"endings\\") coming, but that didn't decrease my pleasure in the process.<br /><br />Where I was not totally satisfied was with the way Connelly kept Haller from asking the questions that a good lawyer would ask. Instead, these did not enter the lawyer's mind, so that, at the end, Connelly could conveniently introduce the resolution. This would have been a stronger book if Haller had asked himself the logical questions: I can't reveal what they are without introducing a Spoiler, but I will say that they are about the way the murder could have been committed. Haller and his defense team are wise, experienced, cynical, and thorough investigators. While every legal team must at some time miss asking themselves the obvious, it's nevertheless not satisfying when this is done at the end of a novel.

B0002IQJUK|5.0|After an amazing opportunity to see Gavin DeGraw and his band perform at a private corporate event I had to obtain Chariot Stripped.  His energy and charm with the live audience, jumping up on the piano to pose for pictures when he noticed people with their phones held high to capture a shot was amazing.  This album delivers and takes me back to that magical performance!
B0041KKYEW|4.0|Natalie Portman gave a riveting performance in this film and won a very deserving Oscar in a tough and competitive Oscar year. Though this film would not get my nod for Best Picture contention, I think it was among the better films nominated for awards in 2010/2011.<br /><br />Several reviews and the synopsis give an overview of the plot and events. I just found the acting to be stellar, especially Portman (as mentioned), Winona Ryder (sadly not a lot of screen time but what a performance) and Vincent Cassel. I thought Mila Kunis did well for breaking out of her traditional role style, but her performance was uneven.<br /><br />The film builds nicely to a resounding finale that is firmly etched into my mind for the rest of my life. Love it or hate it, this is an emotional, complex, and striking psychological thriller that is worth watching at least once. Even for someone like me who knows little to nothing about ballet.
1594744769|4.0|From the very moment I happened to stumble upon this book on Amazon, I was intrigued. The cover is fantastic and gives off such a spooky air that I couldn't help but be drawn to it. Although I went into it expecting horror and got fantasy...I was not at all disappointed.<br /><br />Ransom Riggs collects \\"found\\" photos. These old, and often super creepy, pictures are the inspiration behind this novel, which incorporates those images with a fantastical tale about a teenage boy trying to find his place in life.<br /><br />Jacob has grown up listening to his grandfather's stories about an island on which there is a school filled with \\"peculiar\\" children who all have different special talents. When old enough to dismiss such fantastical ideas as magic, Jacob decides to take his grandfather's stories with a grain of salt - that is, until tragedy strikes and our hero realizes there might have been some truth behind it all. The story follows Jacob as he attempts to uncover the hidden secrets of his grandfather's life - with a lot of humor and descriptive language peppered throughout.<br /><br />I must admit this book hooked me really fast and the author's build-up of events kept me reading well past my bedtime. I loved how the photos were incorporated into the text - with descriptions preceding actual pictures. I found myself really excited to turn the page and see what the described characters looked like. I also really enjoyed that these seemingly scary pictures were turned into something more innocent via the story. Instead of scared, I found myself fascinated by the photos.<br /><br />One thing I did not care for was how the story builds up to a sequel (which has already been announced). In plain terms, there is more of a lack of resolution than I usually like. Don't get me wrong, I like to read a series but I especially like to read a series where a book can stand alone. While this one can, it's teetering on that edge of the unknown. And as a totally random side note, I actually thought to myself as I read \\"Hey! There's not many pages left and it seems like too much is still open ended. But they'd have a hard time making this a series, unless they have many pictures of same individuals or enough pictures that kind of obscure the subject's face.\\"<br /><br />Overall, it was a very enjoyable read and I liked the format and the imaginative story. I would highly recommend this book, but be forewarned - if you like an ending wrapped in a neat and tidy bow, you will likely be disappointed.Hey!

B004QZ9PLU|2.0|Was very disappointed.  Read every Nicholas Sparks story and thought the addition of the backwoods cousins was far out for him.  Also the \\"change of heart\\" (read Jodi Picoult as well) was obvious.  I do suppose this story was more realistic in that happy endings are few and far between.

1400049628|2.0|i assumed that because this book has so many great reviews that it would be funny to non-zombie fans. it wasn't. its not like i hate zombies, some of my best friends are zombies...   i got a quarter of the way through without laughing and quit.
B004XGN8W4|5.0|Keeping this short and simple. This is a great product if you game a lot, and travel alot. It takes less than a minute to pack up and less than a minute to set-up. It's not that heavy with a system in it and the case/design is done really well. Right now, I'm overseas in Afghanistan so this is perfect for me. Once I get home, I don't do a lot of traveling but I am going to give this to one of my nephews so they can take their gaming w/them to their buddies.   Anybody who is wondering about the picture, don't be. The quality is amazing, the sound is excellent and I love the duel audio ports. GJ Gaems.

B004VF68AQ|1.0|Prior to the release of \\"The Great Escape Artist,\\" Jane's Addiction could be described as a band rooted in rock the likes of Led Zeppelin and The Who, with their undulating, blues-charged peaks and valleys.<br /><br />But on the band's fourth outing, after an eight-year hiatus during which original bassist Eric Avery rejoined and then left the band again, Jane's added electronics to the mix, with the help of multi-instrumentalist Dave Sitek of TV on the Radio as co-writer and bassist. Now Jane's sounds more like Garbage or Evanescence. Except for that cellophane yowl of singer Perry Farrell, the music is nearly unrecognizable -- and even Mr. Lollapalooza's voice is subdued and often slathered in treatments.<br /><br />There is a sense of gratuitousness to \\"Escape Artist\\"; it's overproduced, overwrought, overthought -- and grandstanding guitarist Dave Navarro is let loose from his shackles too many times, though thankfully not as often as on 2003's \\"Strays.\\" The album takes itself too seriously, even as Farrell wags his juvenile boasts and counterclaims like a self-conscious rapper.<br /><br />About half of the songs start out decently enough, but other than the passable \\"Irresistible Force (Met the Immovable Object),\\" each one eventually devolves into a megalomaniacal farce. It's as if the members have let the success and accolades turn their melons into mush, or they're trying to move hair rock into the age of electronica.<br /><br />As on \\"Strays,\\" Avery's absence sticks out like a sore thumb. Early Jane's hits like \\"Been Caught Stealing\\" and \\"Three Days\\" would never have become classics without Avery's imprint. Brawny bass grooves are sorely lacking on \\"Escape Artist,\\" and Farrell -- who literally phoned in (well, emailed) his vocals -- lacks the ferocity of previous Jane's releases.<br /><br />Unless the grandiose \\"Irresistible Force\\" ends up on one of those monster romance soundtracks (\\"Twilight 5,\\" anyone?), I doubt any of the songs off \\"Escape Artist\\" will be remembered six months from now. Perhaps a more fitting title would have been \\"The Great Vanishing Act.\\"tting title would have been \\"The Great Vanishing Act.\\"
B005M92MJ6|5.0|The first play through I thought I only really loved a few of the songs but then the rest really grew on me, quickly! The first time I listened to Monsoons I thought it sounded odd and not in a good way, but after paying attention to the lyrics it is my favorite song on the album. Absolutely love it!
B004SCN2F6|5.0|Definitely try the free version first, as this game is definitely not for everybody.  However, if you love in-depth, free-form rpgs, then I highly recommend this game.<br /><br />UPDATED - Long overdue upgrade of my review from 4 stars to 5 stars! The devs continuously update the game so, despite the fact that the game has been out for a while, it continues to feel fresh.
0307987647|5.0|This book series is a great addition to the fantasy genra. For fans of the first book, you really get a different perspective on several of the characters from the first book/movie.   The guy they have reading this on audio is also really talented. The guy does a different voice for every character, which is kinda rediculous considering this series, so he actually won a genius record for his work. In addition you can really tell the reader has taken alot of pride in developing the appropriate mood/tones for his voice with different characters and scenes. (ie. snarky characters get snarky voices, and he changes tones sometimes to add suspense.)  I recommend this product. I personally found it a great for commuting to work, when the cars around me don't appreciate a book on the steering wheel.
0316548189|5.0|Purchased for a friend who was interested in the published works of Nelson Mandela a legend of a man and one of the greatest person to have walked the Earth in our time. This book captures most of the success, insights and the struggles of his journey and is well written. Would highly recommend this as a gift to any budding reading enthusiast.
B0055SWM08|4.0|This is a fun game if you enjoy solving puzzles. I give it for stars as I just started playing it and can't be sure I will not find any bugs.
0156027321|4.0|Life of Pi is a coming of age story that has an unbelievable story line. It is a parallel story between something real and something fictional.  It is both a sad story about a shipwreck victim and a tale with a religious message.  Part one was drab, because it lists information about Pi's life. Although part one is boring and event less, it needs to be read because everything we read in part one, comes back to be important in part two. Part two was much more intriguing, although the castaway suffering theme is reoccurring. Part three adds an unexpected twist to the novel that will make the reader either hate the book, or love the book. I personally thought the ending was well thought out and very captivating. One important lesson that I learned from the book, is to always have faith no matter the situation. It is amazing that Pi kept his love of God with all that had happened. We can all learn a lesson from Pi in that perspective. The way Yann Martel used foreshadowing and symbolism made the story engrossing and made it a classic in my eyes. I recommend that you read the book, because not only is it a good read, but it teaches life lessons that are so valuable. I read the book because it was assigned. At first I resented the book and wanted to rid myself of it. After reading farther into it, I did not want the novel to end. Life of Pi was a great book and the best book that I have read for a school assignment.
B005QPGHQU|5.0|Thoroughly enjoyed it...although perhaps I wasn't a DIE HARD fan of the early work I thought this one is phenomenal...even songs I listened to in the samples and didn't care for turned out to be quite good.  Songs really grew on me the more I listened.  Highly recommended.
B004UID2LC|3.0|I added this app on my Herotab C8 and was able to download the first video I wanted and since then (3 days ago) I havent been able to download any video files but it will download them in MP3 format. anyone have any ideas on this issue?
1451637500|2.0|Like many other reviewers/long-time fans of Bujold here, I was thrilled to learn that she had finally added another installment to her much beloved Vorkosigan series, so I pre-ordered a hard-copy. Not unlike other reviewers here, I found the book immensely disappointing, sorely lacking in the wonderful qualities and masterful writing found in other books throughout the series. To add insult to injury, Bujold/her editors saved her best for the very last, no doubt losing a majority of her readers before the big reveal. Bujold struts her stuff in the final chapter, and a series of beautifully written vignettes. It's as if she/her editors are taunting her die-hard readers saying, \\"I've still got it, but I'm gonna make you work for it.\\" Everyone's entitled to a flop or three, but if this is \\"the new normal\\" Ms. Bujold, please put the Vorkosigan pen to rest and preserve the unparallelled quality of the series. Thank you for the gift of Miles and family and their fabulous adventures....
B0002PZVHK|5.0|The usage of sound and tone in this specific Ambient attempt (4) is unique and evocative. Its a tad like George Krumm in concept within his Voice of the Whale recordings, sound representing geologic age and human evolution. It is a totally different work than Ambient 1, and yet, both works allow for individual interpretation and mood change. Love it.
B005MLP5E8|1.0|I find it appalling that I must pay to watch shows that have already aired on free tv! Yet another way Corporate America is sucking our $ from us!!
B003WTE886|5.0|This album is a great addition to the country music world.  I would rate it a 10 because of it's dexterity and willingness to take shape at each turn whirling you in a spell of great sound.  Aurally it is sonic and stellar and holds validity within each vocal and guitar twang.  Overall this album is one of my all-time favorites and I play it the least of my records due to this.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I started using this app on my phone in anticipation of receiving the Kindle Fire. It works great! I love that you can change the background and text colors, as well as the font size and brightness. Really, all the features are fantastic and exactly what is needed for this type of device. I love reading on the train again!
B004FOA84A|1.0|Amazon told me that this game would work on my Optimus V, however it doesn't. It just force closes. Wish Amazon would get better at telling customers which games will actually work on their phone. Also at this point in time there is no refund for apps that don't work.
0439023513|5.0|read book 1 for book club and then had to buy book 2 and 3 because there was too long of a wait at the library...  fast and excellent reads...  a must
B000SEIK2S|4.0|The writing style is brisk and breezy. It's an easy book to just roll through without thinking and not see its depth. Scalzi reminds me of an early Heinlein or Asimov. Good book in its own right, but he's just starting, Greater books will follow.
0439023491|5.0|this series of books is so intense that I couldnt wait to get the next book from the library so I had to buy them...<br />fast read and keeps you on the edge of your seat and then blows you away with the next turn of events....highly reccommend...we read book 1 for book club and then I had to go on...
1593157134|5.0|Yes, this book doesn't reveal any new truths - because there is no such thing. Instead, it masterfully breaks down the concepts into manageable chunks that can be applied with consistency, over time, to add up to great results. I have great respect for Darren Hardy and truly believe that he wants to make the world a better place.
B004ZQRFGM|5.0|This is the first recording that I have of Ms Popovic<br />It is really great material<br />It probably won't be my last
B0034G4P80|3.0|This is one of those small screen background noise films:  the kids can watch it while their parents pay inadvertent attention while occupied with other things and catch a few laughs that are thrown in for them.  Unfortunately, I actually had to watch it in a theatre and was pretty bored for the most part.<br /><br />THe story is about beings that are in other planes of existence.  You have what were taken as Norse gods, but who are apparently advanced humanoid beings whose magic is their science.  THere are also the ice something or others, who are baddies but held in impotence because King Odin has stolen their frozen fire power source.  So the Norse gods are in a succession battle:  Thor is too arrogant to take over, but his putative brother Loki is untustworthy.  Thus, Odin banishes Thor to Earth and sends his hammer as well, which makes a crater and is unmovable.  Enter a gorgeous and eccentric scientist (N Portman), who discovers him and loves him, of course.  A big fight ensues, Thor prevails while seeing the error of his ways (really, that is a spoiler, but would anyone expect anything different?).  Etc.<br /><br />The chemistry between Portman and Thor is woefully, even ridiculously, absent.  The god actors are OK, not anything distinguished though.  I also found the jokes that were thrown in to be rather flat, i.e. not funny.  Also, the intrusion of SHIELD, the bureaucratic security group, is botched, kind of between Tea Party comedy at their incompetence to arguing that they are the good guys.  It doesn't work, which adds nothing to the insipid formula.<br /><br />I would recommend this to kids, not to adults and especially not to boomer Marvel fans.
1614270198|5.0|Amazing book, Amazing Author.  It's obviously extremely difficult to completely utilize your subconscious mind, but the Author will help you understand what it is, and how to acheive it.  This book makes me feel good every time I read it.  I loved it so much that I didn't want to read the whole thing at once, so I was reading a chapter a day, kind of like a dessert. :  I highly recommend this book to anyone, whether if you're educated or not educated, rich or poor, young or old.  This book is for everyone.<br />I'm still learning to use my subconscious mind, even though I'm not quite as far ahead as some people, this book gives me a great hope and happiness.<br />Thank you Mr. Murphy for writing this great book, and sharing your amazing knowledge with the rest of the world.  I truly hope more people can take advantage of their amazing gift.
B0052VUNHC|5.0|One of my favorite books! I NEVER reread books. I have reread this book 3 times already. I LOVE it! The characters are fabulous. All very different, but equally loveable. I found myself putting off my  important daily regimen just to continue reading! I could not put it down!! Buy it! You will not be disappointed!
B005WWBP1O|5.0|A unique blend of fun, education and enlightenment. This book moves you away with this story and plot. The writing language and the use of metaphors are equally impressive.
0803726570|5.0|This is a feel-good, take care of your own, important to have friends sort of story set in a Halloween/Samhain setting. My seven (almost eight) year old Daughter liked it very much. I enjoyed it also. Recommended
0811879542|5.0|This has been the most fun book ever! My daughter loves it (she is 1) and I have just lent it to my friend who is a teach and she is using it as topic for her middle school students. It is a must have
B001E45XT4|5.0|for a so cheap price you could not get something better than this, the sound quality is just awesome, and at the begining they are kinda unconfortable but after a few days of use, they get very very confortable, i dare to say that this heaphones worth even more money. my games sound awesome tottally worth the 25$ ive spent on this
B002HWRYJE|5.0|Perfect DVD - exactly as promised!  It gets better the more times you watch it.  Much better than a reboot, it's a reinvention!  Looking forward to the next movie.  The possibilities are endless.

0156027321|4.0|The Life of Pi is a fictional story that is told as if it is a real story. Through out the entire story, the author, Yann Martel writes through Pi's eyes and at times writes through his own perspective. This is a fictional survival story of a young boy who is forced to grow older and more mature in response to his actions.      I found this book to be very interesting. Pi Patel is pushed to his extreme limit and has to do whatever he can to survive the time he spends on the lifeboat. Most of this novel is written through the thoughts, actions, and sights of Pi. The perspective used gives the reader a feeling that makes them feel as if they are the character. When one reads this book, it is easy to get caught in the action and survival mode of this story. The perspective that the author uses in the novel aids that connection. The perspective lets you absorb Pi's situation easier than if the story were showing you what happened through an outside narrator's eyes. The goal of the Life of Pi is to show how far people will go to survive, to show that we are all similar no matter what religion, and to show that one should never give up on life no matter what their circumstances are.      Yann Martel did a fantastic job illustrating a picture in the readers mind. For example the lifeboat was easy for me to imagine solely from the vivid details given about the lifeboat and raft. The book was fairly accurate as to what would happen in Pi's situation. One inaccuracy I found was when Yann Martel talks about how Pi trained Richard Parker (the tiger stuck on the life boat with Pi) he just blew a whistle and Richard Parker would respond. In the real world you would have to project yourself as the overpowering alpha dominance. An easy way that the reader could tell the story was fake was by Pi's description of the island that he landed on. No real island lives off eating meat. There is also no possibility that an island made of algae could have trees growing on top of it. Anotherfault of Yann Martel in the story was that there could not be freshwater pools in the middle of the ocean.      This book was interesting to me and readily captured my interest into the adventure. I would recommend the Life of Pi to someone looking for a fun book and a book that could keep their attention throughout the entire book. My favorite part about this book was a twist that was not expected and caught the reader's attention. When Pi is floating wherever the current takes him he suddenly starts to notice a ship coming his way. In the reader's minds they get excited for Pi to be rescued and for Pi to end his suffering and live with his family. What we find in this part of the book is that Pi's excitement turns to fear as he notices that the ship may hit his lifeboat. By doing this Yann Martel has just gotten the reader back into the book and interested again.       During Pi's adventures on his life boat, he is lost in the Pacific Ocean. Pi does not exactly know where he is but at first thinks that he will be rescued once people notice that the ship to Canada has not yet arrived. The life boat that the he is on is often swarming with sharks ready to eat him. The sharks are not his only problem. Living with Pi inside the lifeboat are a hyena, an orangutan, a zebra, and a lion. Overall I thoroughly enjoyed the action packed adventure of the book. The Life of Pi gives an up close experience of survival and emotional changes that come with survival.

B00009NHC5|5.0|Dated, but excellent suspense movie about blind wife left alone in basement apartment unaware that a doll her husband brought home from a trip contains drugs. And the bad guys are there to try and retrieve them. Wonderful performance from the cast: Audrey Hepburn plays the blind wife to perfection; Alan Arkin, the textbook sociopath who wants the drugs no matter who he has to eliminate! The climatic final scene was billed the same as my title, and no one was allowed into the theater after the show started to preserve the shocking finale. Well worth the price of admission.
0545259088|3.0|I LOVED Shiver. I really enjoyed it.  Stiefvater's style drew me in.  Her poetic style of writing was enjoyable to read, I loved Sam and Grace's story, and really felt connected.  I HATED Linger.  I really felt it fell short of my expectations.  There were plot holes that didn't make sense and I just didn't feel connected any more.  I just didn't care anymore.  The book failed to draw me in.  I hadn't given up hope though.  I thought for sure Stiefvater would pull it together in Book 3, Forever.  Sadly, I was wrong.  I wanted to love it.  I really did.  But again it fell short.<br /><br />Some Minor spoilers below<br />Sam and Grace's connection seemed forced, Grace's issues with her parents were left unresolved.  Cole's issues with his condition, also unresolved.  The weird connection between Isabel and Cole, also unresolved.  Even the \\"cure\\" is not really resolved.  The whole issue what makes Sam a wolf again is confusing.  Was he reinjected with wolf?  Or did Cole just make him temporarily revert? Then what about the issue that what happened to Grace in Linger, wouldn't happen to Sam as well?<br /><br />Overall, I still love Stiefvater's style.  I think it is beautiful and descriptive.  I just had higher hopes for Linger and Forever.  I haven't given up on her though.  I will still continue to read her novels.
B004XGN8W4|4.0|The TV that I usually game on is an Insignia (Best Buy brand) 32\\" 720p LCD (but some things run higher res, 360 runs at 1360x768 and the PS3 runs blu rays at 1080p but games at 720p). I say this because this is the screen that I have for comparison. With this TV I can see the same image no matter what angle I view it from. Up, down, or sideways it still gives me the same image. This is the viewing angle. This is the one problem that I have with the G155. The viewing angle is pretty limited. You really have to have the G155 lower and mostly directly in front of you to get a good image on the screen. If the screen is higher or more than a foot or so to either side the image quality declines. If you stay in that area it looks pretty good, not as good as my other TV, but not bad. The only other issue that I have with the G155 is that when I use it with my older 360, space is pretty cramped for the power supplies and controller. You really have to be efficient to make everything fit. Other than those 2 things it is basically perfect. The case is good quality and it's a godsend for anyone who needs something like this. For $269 the price is pretty reasonable, but I think Gaems needs to come out with a deluxe model for maybe a hundred or so more with a really nice screen with better viewing angles.
0800141849|5.0|I have this CD in the car and play it over and over. It's wonderful. As was the movie. Barbra's song at the end following Puccini is beautiful.
0307588335|4.0|What the author does well is adding a good personal touch to the story of the collapse of Lehman, however I prefer Too Big to Fail for the complete picture of the collapse of wall street.  For a more personal perspective though this is your book.
B005974CDU|5.0|Another Excellent Dream Theater CD showing a variety of styles. A good mix of Long, short and medium length songs. Once again they demonstrate Power Progressive Hard Rock as well as showing the beautiful art of their song writing in lyrics and music. Prepare to blown away by all five members of this incredible band.

0385732554|4.0|The Giver was moving, beautiful, and deep.  The world reminded me a lot of Matched by Ally Condie. I'm glad I read it as an adult. It might have gone over my head if I'd read it in middle school. It was pretty deep and serious stuff. I'm still thinking about it. To be honest, I'm trying to figure out what happened at the end.  It had a very high-brow literary feel to it, but it wasn't hard to read.  Good literature has three things: first, excellent writing, second, lots and lots of feelings, and third, a nice, ambiguous ending.  The Giver has all of this and more.  As ambiguous as the ending was, it was still beautiful and I walked away from the book having a better appreciation for life in general.
B005SFR7YE|5.0|I went to see the live broadcast of this on Oct. 2.  I loved it so much I wanted to go back and see it every time they showed it, but was busy for all of the other showings.  I was so excited to see that they have it available to purchase now.  This was the first time I had seen the full stage version of the show, however I am very familiar with the music.  The cast did a wonderful job, and in the end Andrew Lloyd Weber gave a speech and introduced the original cast and company.  Sarah Brightman performed Phantom of the Opera with 4 former phantoms who then sang and beautiful rendition of Music of the Night for which they were joined by the Phantom from that nights performance.  In my opinion this is Andrew Lloyd Weber's greatest work, and it is no mystery that it has lasted 25 years.  I would not be surprised in the least to see it last another 25.
B004VSTP4Y|3.0|Love the characters in this book.  Most of them you've known for the whole series, but in this book they start to grow and change the way real people would.  The realistic characters are what makes this story shine.  The plot felt unfinished and unresolved - not like a cliff hanger, but just like we hadn't quite gotten to the ending yet. It was a page-turner with a good pace. It answered a lot of questions from the series, but at the same time I left with even more question than I had to begin with.  Shiver remains my favorite of the series.
B00023B1A8|5.0|Awesome! I bought this as a gift for my dad since we are both huge CSN fans. Great buy! Acoustic is always a good choice.
0545265355|4.0|It's like 1984 meets reality TV and gladiators. I think the series is so popular because it makes you examine and ponder how we as a world are living now.  This is one of the first books to come out in the huge dystopian YA market.  It was recommended to me by Stephenie Meyer (not personally...) and I enjoyed the series as a whole.  The end of the last book grew on me.  I didn't like it at first.  There's a supernatural element to them, too, which I enjoyed.
0743201140|4.0|Yes, the title may be obvious but how many of us focus entirely on our strengths and not mind our weaknesses? The idea of managing a weakness to the point that it does not hinder us but still focusing and growing our strengths - now that is brilliant when put to practice. Thank you Marcus Buckingham! Even though it took me a few years to leave my corporate job where I was all about overcoming my weaknesses and go into business for myself to let my strengths shine, I am GLAD I took the plunge.<br /><br />In fact, I am in the midst of preparing a course for those who want to escape a miserable job, be it from Corporate America or any job anywhere - and to create a smart exit strategy, and I am quoting and using this book as a great resource.<br /><br />The book is a great read and a reference for the future too. What the book lacks in the details around each strength area, it makes up for in articulating the differences between dominant talent, skill set and knowledge. For instance, while it is not easy to identify the exact mix of talent, skill and learning which goes into creating a superlative performance, the absence of talent is to blame in the case of sub par performance for the highly skilled and highly knowledgeable person. Talent we cannot produce; we can simply foster an environment to bring out its best.<br /><br />ENJOY IT! And let those strengths shine. It does wonders for your happiness too!
B005G4TJI4|5.0|Wonderful movie. Great integration of original series in film. I grew up watching transformers as a kid and I love this movie.  Great storyline. Surprising villian. Great special effects and makes you forget about Megan Fox real quick. Beatiful girl. A++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
159562015X|3.0|After reading the first book in this topic, \\"Now, Discover Your Strengths\\", I was rejuvenated.  I learned the 5 areas of my greatest potential strengths. I felt them to be quite accurate. Tom Rath wrote the sequel, \\"StrengthFinder 2.0\\" soon after the publication of Buckingham and Clifton's book and I wanted to read this book for two reasons:<br /><br />First I wanted a free pass to Strengthfinder 2.0 assessment to check my results against my initial score. Despite the accuracy of my 5 themes, I wanted to challenge the fool-proofness of the test.<br /><br />Second, I wanted to delve more deeply into practical applications of my strengths.<br /><br />Funny enough, things hardly go as planned. As for my first reason, curiosity got the best of me and I made my husband take the test instead. What would it be like to know your partner's strengths? Would that help or challenge the relationship? Would opposite strengths be likely to weaken or strengthen the relationship? Would similar partners be compatible or boring?<br /><br />As for the book, it is more of a reference than something you read cover to cover. You want to first take the test, which is a lot of fun but needs focus and undivided attention, and then learn all about your own strengths, then maybe compare yours to others to better understand them and find ways to do things in such a way as to benefit your relationship with them.<br /><br />Overall, I do believe and recommend the StrengthFinder program.
0393072231|5.0|Despite being a narrative about the financial collapse in 2008, this is one of the most engaging books I have ever read.  I literally set copies out to my family as soon as I finished it because it was such a great read.  The information is presented in a manner that a person without extensive financial background can still understand it, while still conveying the intricacies of what was done.  This is not the story we were told through mainstream media.  Even if you think you know the story of why the markets collapsed, you might e surprised at the information in this book.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Very interesting and fun! It's challenging and I don't think it will get boring like so many of these games do.
B005J4TLO8|4.0|I didn't know how this was going to be, However I took the chance and saw it in theatres and must say it didn't dissapoint. It was funny from start to finish whether event wise or just funny lines. I'm surprised to see this rated with anything under 3 stars to be honest. Give it a chance I'm sure the majority that do will like this movie.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|I absolutely LOVE this game.  However, it does not have all the features the iphone version has I really wish it did.  There is no reason why it shouldnt.
B00003JRCQ|5.0|I love PP and Sense and Sensibility, and this movie is just as wonderful!  I did not expect to love it as much as I did.  Definitely worth purchasing!
B005LJK3AC|4.0|I'll start by saying it's a free country, and the beauty of film (hopefully) is that there is something for everyone, and everyone is entitled to their opinion. And while I don't believe HORRIBLE BOSSES will win any Oscars, it is certainly funny for what it is and Kevin Spacey and JENNIFER ANISTON steal the movie.  All that being said, I would like to seque into a couple of questions that I can't seem to answer about people that post \\"reviews\\"  1. If you didn't see the movie on amazon VOD (or likely at all) can you spare us one word reviews like \\"SUCKS!\\" -- how are you helping people?  2. If you did see the movie but go on to write a four paragraph screed about how it is offensive to your 3 year-old, LEARN TO READ. There's something called  a \\"RATINGS SYSTEM\\" designed to help you keep from watching movies like this with your children. Look for the capital \\"R\\" for \\"RESTRICTED\\"  3. In keeping with my opening line, we are entitled to our opinions, but I have grown weary of the reviewer who would like to tell us all about  how they could write, shoot, act, and direct better than the people who just got paid millions of dollars to do so. REALLY? Then WTF are you doing writing  reviews for amazon. Go make your own movie so some loser can pan it here after it hits VOD.  Please forgive the rant.  Horrible Bosses is a better-then-expected silly buddy/gross out comedy one has come to expect from Sudeikis and Bateman, mainly because of Spacey and a bawdy turn  by Aniston.  Thanks.
B000Z27HLS|5.0|I love Pride and Prejudice and Sense and Sensibility and did not think I could enjoy another movie as much as those two.  Northanger Abbey is wonderful!  I was swept up immediately and loved the momentum of the film.  This is definietly worth watching!
B005FUTBV4|1.0|Yuck.  What a mess.<br />Worst and most overrated filmmaker of ALL TIME!<br />Why doesn't Smith just hang it up while people still like him?
B005MYEPXC|5.0|I saw this on the plane when coming back from London 2 weeks ago. As a book lover, to see the depiction of F scott fitzgerald, Ernest Hemingway or even the 'Cubist' Picasso made me smile. All with the beautiful scenery of paris. Old paris. What more can I say...
B0034G4P8A|5.0|People complaining, complain, complain, complain. That's all they do. \\"his helmet is to big\\" \\"his helmet isn't in the movie enough\\" \\"he remembers things he shouldn't\\" boo hoo boo hoo. It was a great movie, great script, great imagery, great acting. Different than the comic book, yet it pays enough respects to it. Can't wait for the avengers.
B005EVVESM|5.0|Hands All Over is the best CD made by Maroon 5.  All of the songs are great. I listen to this CD every day and exercise to the music loaded on my MP3.  Particular favorites when doing a fast walk are Misery, Give a Little More, Stutter, Don't Know Nothing, and Moves Like Jagger.
B004SBS8LA|1.0|I purchased this for only $.99. I have only been able to play this game once. Now it shows an error message and states that I will have to uninstall and re-install. After doing this several times, the game will not load. Not worth the trouble.
B0009HLD0K|5.0|Breaking Away is one of the most underappreciated sports movies ever made.  I have it my top five all-time sports movies (along with fellow underappreciated niche sports flick, Vision Quest).  More than just a sports movie, it is also a great coming of age story and teen comedy.<br /><br />Breaking Away follows the growing pains of four blue collar boys (including a young Dennis Quaid and Daniel Stern) from a college town (Bloomington, Indiana) trying to adjust to life after high school with no bright prospects on the horizon.  Dave, a cyclist obsessed with an Italian team, is the heart of the quartet.  A love interest, a rival, and Dave's parents (including Paul Dooley in an even more hilarious turn as the father than in Sixteen Candles) also factor in.<br /><br />Given the bias toward the homogenization of movie settings driven by a southern California based movie industry, it is refreshing to see a movie that is so much about a particular place.  And Breaking Away is very much about Bloomington, Indiana.  The climax occurs during the Little 500, Indiana University's idiosyncratic bicycle race.  The townies swim in an abandoned quarry and are derisively called \\"cutters\\" by the college kids, alluding to the Indiana limestone industry.<br /><br />This movie tries to do many things, and it does them all extremely well.  You will laugh at Dooley and cheer during the climactic race.  But it's the coming of age stuff that really shines.  There's a lot of bitterness and pain and growth amongst the laughter and cheers.  I wouldn't just recommend this to cycling fans or just to sports fans but to anyone who wants to see a great movie that has heart and soul.<br /><br />The DVD extras include the theatrical trailer, trailers for a handful of Fox movies (Baby's Day Out, My Bodyguard, Rookie of the Year, and The Sandlot), and two TV spots for Breaking Away.
B004L07KWQ|2.0|Some people may find the minimal interface as a positive, but it wouldn't hurt to have a little more control over color selection. My 4 year old kept asking how he could change the colors on his own instead of having a different random color everytime he made a new line.
B003L77G6A|5.0|This series just keeps getting better. I've always liked Johnny Galecki but he may be not be the biggest funny man on this show as Jim Parsons is just hilarious. Free shipping got the item to me fast enough and I'm amazed at some of the details I missed when watching the show on TV.
B005P39GOI|5.0|The artist I tell everyone about and recommend to them is Ben Howard. No matter what kind of music you like, you will probably enjoy Ben's music. If I won a million dollars, I'd gift this album to everyone I know and then some. That's how good it is! Totally worth the money, every penny.   I have been a fan of his music for a long time. So I was ecstatic when I heard his debut album was coming out. Made my day - month even. His guitar skills are incredible (just check out some live videos on youtube). His lyrics show intense honesty and beauty. It is an album that fits any occasion. I would recommend songs, but I would just be listing every track. It really is that good.   I really hope he comes to the US very soon. I will pay good money to see him live and drive any distance to that show. He's just monumentally awesome!

B000WAEK0E|5.0|VAN MORRISON-STILL ON TOP/THE GREATEST HITS: Always a reluctant participant in the fame game, ethereal songwriter/bloozey growler VAN MORRISON's eclectic fusion of roots rock and Irish folk music has rendered him a fave of both fans and critics for over five decades. From GLORIA's early punk swagger and MOONDANCE's creamy ambience to the strutting tribute JACKIE WILSON SAID and WAVELENGTH's unbridled gospel buzz, the Belfast belter has churned up a body of work reigned in only by his own temperamental personality and notoriously perfectionist standards. The stunning triumvirate of BROWN EYED GIRL, DOMINO and WILD NIGHT are cornerstones of classic era AM pop radio, each one a testifyin' truth as only a blue eyed soul preacher like Morrison could administer it. Recent scintillating tidbits like HEY MR. DJ and BACK ON TOP demonstrate his continued commitment to rhythmic quality armed with a message. STILL ON TOP is available in single, double, and triple disc form, but any way you slice it, VAN's always been &#34;the man&#34;.<br /><br />RATING: FIVE DROPS OF TUPELO HONEY
B0050CJNJ2|5.0|This CD is in the right place and just the right time of release.  Typical Lady Antebellum tradition, it will not disappoint. New music with their style of presentation.  Easy to add to the collection with easy listening.
B004J4WKTW|1.0|Night Circus is written in the present tense. I have yet to read a novel that pulls this off, and I was turned off as soon as I realized this book was sticking with it. The technique is an artsy ploy that distracts from the story. It seems to be a trendy feat for authors to undertake, but reading in the present tense does nothing to transport me. I know I am sitting in my house, reading a book, not in a 19th century circus tent. A story needs to offer a lot more than that to suck me in.  After about 50 pages, I thought, \\"I do not care about these characters one bit.\\" At that point, I noticed that the POV did not allow me to connect firmly with any of them. I also did not care about the plot. I couldn't tell what was really happening or where it was heading and the writing style did not contain enough tension to pull me along. I finally gave up on this book.
0385341679|5.0|This was one of my all time favorite series to read, and I do not even read this genre of books. I loved Mac and Barron so much I read the first four books twice to prepare for the fifth. All I can say is what a blast, and what a great author. I would never had discovered her had it not been for Darkfever being free on my Kindle. Great characters and plot, and may I say it seems to be that it could continue, so here is hoping for another set of books with Mac, Dani and Barrons keeping peace in their world.
B000002MJR|4.0|This live album comes from 1992 and features 10 tracks over 75 minutes.  Calling Elvis kicks off, not far ahead there's Heavy Fuel, On Every Street and Money For Nothing, these are not my favourites.  Still they are well presented, then there are the fantastic songs Romeo And Juliet, Private Investigations, Your Latest Trick and Brothers In Arms.  All together a good album, although maybe some of the songs lacked the high tempo of the studio recordings.
0446563048|5.0|I chose to read this book for a leadership assignment for a 400 level course in college. I saw Tony Hsieh in Las Vegas at a conference about a year ago and thought it was completely captivating. The book is the same way. I loved the story and the message!
B004QSQML8|4.0|Great transfer to bluray ........it was also very nice to see both versions on this disc too.  Extras are good.......not great but very interesting.
B0011HF6GE|2.0|I'm afraid I just didn't enjoy this album much.  I started with the eponymous album, \\"Bon Iver,\\" and do like that album, so I was really disappointed after listening to this one a few times. I hope you have a different experience if you choose to purchase this.  If you heard one or two tunes from him and wanted to try a whole album, I would definitely recommend starting with the album \\"Bon Iver\\" first, I find it's more accessible and has a lusher sound than \\"For Emma, Forever Ago.\\"  Good luck
0446547654|5.0|This book is gratifying in many senses. The author takes you places in your mind a person should sometimes go. It helps you to answer mind's questions, especially about love. Like with The Notebook, we're dealt reality. In this \\"reality\\" you appreciate the essence of enduring love. Loved the characters. Each and every one.
030726999X|3.0|Was disappointed in the condition of the book.  Did not know it was coming from a public library so you can imagine the usage of the book.  Thought I was getting it from an individual.
B000002H70|5.0|No one who is serious about maintaining a death-laughs-forever, fashionably-alienated, world-won't listen, prince-of-darkness persona as a \\"gothic\\" musician is also going to record and release the type of sometimes bouyant music that found its way onto \\"The Head On The Door\\" and \\"Kiss Me Kiss Me Kiss Me\\" ,which was not whatever's past dark, remote, and brooding in atmosphere, or occasionally pen lyrics that come nowhere close to being an expression of pure loathing for the continued horror of existence in a directionless, decaying universe (\\"If Only Tonight We Could Sleep\\", \\"Hot Hot Hot\\" and \\"The Perfect Girl\\", from \\"Kiss Me Kiss Me Kiss Me\\", for example, recalled just off the top of my head.)<br /><br />Robert Smith, The Cure's founder and universal constant since their emergence well over thirty years ago, isn't someone who strikes me as a person who chooses to wear black on the outside because black is all that he feels on the inside. With that being said, \\"Disintegration\\", while not a complete reversion to the transient embrace of nihilistic feeling expressed on \\"Seventeen Seconds\\", \\"Faith\\", and \\"Pornography\\", is a return to Smith's preoccupation with some of the most universally troubling emotions or mindsets that a human being can experience.<br /><br />And even the most benignly titled and recorded tracks on \\"Disntegration\\" have sinister or alienating overtones, such as \\"Lullabye\\" and \\"Lovesong\\". Savage and predatory, the \\"Spiderman\\" who advises his victim to \\"..be still/be calm/be quiet now/my precious little boy\\" in a paternal fashion to cease from struggling against his advances \\"...or I will \\"only love you more\\" is not a pedophile, but a metaphor for the slowly devouring nature of unchecked mental illness. \\"Lovesong\\" at first listen seems to be just that, a sensitive tribute to a partner whose entire presence in the lyricist's life is positive and re-affirming, but just listen a little more attentively to the lyrics. \\"Whenever I'm alone, with you, you make me feel like I'm (home/whole/young/fun/free/clean) again\\". Such a confession on one level is deeply appreciative, but on another very disturbing, as his sense of emotional well-being appears to be temporary, predicated upon the receptivity and affirmative behavior of his lover.<br /><br />Significant behaviors and mindsets causing alienation, the failure of a relationship, and the nostalgic yearning for love that can never be recaptured drive \\" Plainsong\\", \\"Pictures Of You\\" and \\"Last Dance\\"; other tracks deal with issues of rejection, abandonment, and aggressive or emotionally embittered  responses to the aftermath of a relationship ending badly, such as  \\"Closedown\\", \\"Disintegration\\", and \\"Untitled\\", and still other cuts are spiteful rejoinders to partners whose rejection has left the lyricist recalling how love has been replaced by a destructive feeling of universal emptiness as a relationship implodes<br />(\\" Prayers For Rain\\" and \\"Homesick\\"), while both \\"Fascination Street\\" and \\"The Same Deep Water As You\\" depict lovers in the last passionate throes of an ultimately destructive relationship.<br /><br /> Robert Smith's rich, emotive vocal tones both contradicted and underscored his plaintive wailing, and never seemed so tortured yet fully harnessed as it did on this release. Most of \\"Disintegration\\" is a rewarding and positive listen despite Smith's cultivation of gloomy lyrics because of the lockstep groove established by heavily resonant basslines and thunderous, echoing pulse of the drumwork, complemented by the massive overlayered washes of synthesizer which create a bed of ambience for the heavily processed, interlocking guitar lines that weave in and out that texture. A sonically lavish recording, the level of production highlights the chiming elasticity of Smith's, highly melodic, heavily modulated guitar lines, delayed, phased, flanged, reverbed, and chorused until they undulate through each track with variable levels of intensity, reaching and achieving an explosive crescendo on \\"Fascination Street\\". Never again have they been able to harness this sense of controlled intensity, and \\"Disintegration\\" is almost certainly the apotheosis of their sound. I submit that you should get your hands on a copy as quickly as possible.
B002KT3XH6|4.0|I really enjoyed this history of Henry VIII's wives. It was well written, interesting, and well researched. It's facinating to realize how much history has been saved through letters written during that time. If I had any quibble with the book it would be to agree with another one of the reviewers who said that the timeline was sometimes confusing. The author would jump forward and backward in time when talking about each wife. For example, she might discuss banquets that were thrown over a period of ten years and then hop back to talk about clothing from the beginning of those ten years. I wish she had used more examples of \\"three years into their marriage\\" rather than actual dates, because I sometimes had a hard time grasping how much time had passed between wives and events.<br />Other than that it was a very informative and well written book.
B003XDZN8A|5.0|I have a small Morton's neuroma in my foot.  Wearing Crocs, and this shoe in particular, during my workday has helped so much.  They are as comfortable as slippers, but stylish with my scrubs! They are so cozy that I've even started wearing them around the house when I get home! If I kept one pair of shoes in my closet, it would probably be these.
B0052U59F4|5.0|Fifty Shades has just become my new favorite series. If you are not into BDSM that's o.k. because you don't have to be a fan to love this book. To me the fact that I have never been interested in BDSM but still became completely involved in this book says a lot. The heart of the book are the central characters Christian and Ana. I don't even know where to begin with Christian Grey. He is a fantasy and nightmare all at once. Ana and Christian have a very unique relationship. It is all consuming love with a lot of self loathing and destructive behavior on both parts, but oddly comes off as believable and a fairytale at the same time. I don't want to say to much because part of what makes the book so worthy is the unveiling of Christian and Ana's unique, intriguing, intricate characters. I can't say enough good things about this book/series. It has honestly left me a little tongue tied... hmm... can't wait until the last book in the series comes out! I miss reading about Christian and Ana already, and I just finished it last night!
0811875040|3.0|Update #3 on 10/20/2011:  Following is a copy of an e-mail response that I received from Miette's Publicist earlier this afternoon...............  It seems to conflict with Cindy's post (see 1 star reviews) where she spoke with someone from Chronicle Publishing.  I do feel for the author as well.  Miette would be a wonderful cookbook to own; but who wants to have to refer back and forth to a card for recipe corrections.  Years from now one of us that bought this book will pick it up to use and the errata card will have been misplaced and the corrections lost forever..........  1.  Copies of the revised version are NOT in stock anywhere. They will be in stock on Amazon and the Chronicle Books website in a few days.  [.....right now ...they don't exist in the world as of yet.]  2.  Amazon WILL be sending revised copies when they come in if you have reached out to them.  3.  The kindle version is the only version currently on Amazon only because they are out of stock of Miette (the book with errors) because everyone is buying it.  Update:    As of today, 10/20/2011, it appears that Amazon is only selling the electronic version of this cookbook.  The hardcopy is no longer available to order directly from Amazon, only it's resellers.  Since I like to physically hold my books, I will not be purchasing the \\"Kindle\\" copy.  I'm so very disappointed :-(  Original review:  I pre-purchased the original Miette book back in June, 2011.  In July 2011, Amazon notified me that there were errors in the recipes and that a revised edition would be released in October 2011.  Amazon also indicated that they would send me the revised edition at no charge.    Well, trying to get the revised edition has proved to be a nightmare of e-mail and telephone communications with customer service.  Ultimately, they refunded me the original purchase price of the book and I'm now left to reorder the book on my own.  I contacted the publisher who confirmed that Amazon should have the revised editionavailable to ship replacements to its original customers the week beginning October 16, 2011.  Any shipments to customers ordering the book after this date from Amazon should also receive the revised edition.  With this information, I will order this book again.  I'll provide an update to this review as to which version of the book I receive.  Hopefully, it will be the corrected version.  I read the original cookbook and loved its simplistic and tasty sounding recipes and decorated cakes.  They seem the perfect dessert for serving at the end of a dinner party or even if you just want to have friends over for dessert and coffee.  I hadn't tried any of the recipes because shortly after receiving the book I was informed of the errors.  In the interim, however, I purchased various sizes of smaller cake pans in order to make some of the wonderful cakes.  I love this book based on what I've seen and read.  So now, I'm very anxious just to get baking!!
0385504225|3.0|Steven Spielberg makes \\"Steven Spielberg\\" movies. Michael Bay makes \\"Michael Bay\\" films. J.K Rowling, Michael Crichton, etc... The storytellers of our generation (book OR film) do what they know and they know what they do. Dan Brown is no different. I think the best comparison I can give this book (as in what I thought of it) is this...  Indiana Jones 4 might have been the most god-awful of the Indy films, but it was still ten times better than the other crap that came out that summer.  Same with this book. There is a formula to his books, a template, if you will... and you know what? That's why I picked the damn thing up! I knew a Dan Brown book would have the following:  1. Robert Langston's inability to turn off \\"professor mode\\" and drown everyone around him in random trivia/facts.  2. A female sidekick who did some sort of scientific/globally prolific work.  3. A antagonist who did weird junk to himself and to others.  4. Secret societies, symbols, codes and sweet artifacts.  5. Robert & Co. would be on the run from an organization out to stop him.  I LIKE those kinds of stories! Now, I agree with other reviews on here that it was by far the least exciting of the three \\"Langston\\" books, but (just like Indy 4) it's still TONS better than any and all of the teen vampire romance books which are now being given ENTIRE shelves at your neighborhood Barnes & Noble. Thanks Stephanie Meyer for showing us that you can still exploit the low standards of middle school girls and really not have to write a good book to start a \\"literary trend\\". Wait, what did I just say? I blacked out...  Uh, yep! Three stars for this one!
0143119788|4.0|John le Carré's, Tinker, Tailor, Sailor, Spy, a mystery novel demonstrates the theme, intrigue leads to important events. The novel is about George smiley investigating the allegations that his old army commanding officer is alive even though he buried him after he died.  In the beginning of the novel George starts his adventure with the intrigue gained from one of his old army buddies retelling of another's encounter with their C.O a few months prior to this conversation. It's George's curiosity that leads him to the events in the book. Even before we meet George we meet little Bill Roach at Thursgood's preparatory school who witnesses the arrival of the new teacher Jim Prideux. Bill goes to Jim's trailer because he wanted to meet him and it turns out that Jim is a hunchback at he has trouble lifting his arm, Bill is fascinated but curious to learn more about him.  The book is a great read but hard to comprehend with vocabulary that le Carré uses. The book has overall good description of characters, energy (though not as much as I like), and suspense.

B004EPZ07U|4.0|Loved the film in theaters!  Just watched extras last night.  The mode to watch pic in a pic commentary doesn't function with any audio!  The graphic/text portions are not affected.  Window after window appears and when you click on the GL ring to access each one results in total audio silence, while the feature's audio is dropped.  Once the window closes, audio is restored to the film's playback just fine. Contacted Sharp who manufactures my BD unit. No update to firmware since last May.  Their email response to me was to do a factory reset, done, nothing changed. Also cleared my flashdrive memory, this also did nothing to restore the audio.  Anyone else experiencing this?  Thankfully the same footage appears to be avail. in expanded form as featurettes elsewhere on the disc!

0393316041|1.0|Years ago, while in college in Berkeley, Calif.,  one of my classmates told me that it was 'overwhelming place' and that everyone here 'has an act'.  I agreed with the friend (who, by the way, had dropped a little too much acid for his own good), but what disappointed me about Feynman's NYT super best-seller that even a Nobel Laureate genius, near the end of his life, feels that he needs to have an act.<br /><br />Let me begin by saying that I share with perhaps most physicists, and science laymen, an unalloyed admiration for Richard Feynman's achievements - not only in physics discoveries but in being able to convey its excitement of the scientific method to perhaps a wider audience than anyone in modern history.<br /><br />However, With the notable exception of the last chapter 'Cargo Cult Science'  this autobiographical \\"Surely you're Joking, Mr. Feynman\\" is NOT about physics, or teaching it. - It is about how cool Feynman thought he was as a  personality and celebrity.<br />And I didnt get it when I read first read this in 1987, and still dont.<br />The early chapters are all about what an irrepressible rebel he was, always questioning authority. This is silly - his pranks and are nothing too extraordinary for a young man his age - and all the more ordinary considering he was well aware how smart &  naturally talented he was, knowing all along he could get away with it.<br />He wasnt  going to get burned at the stake for saying that the Earth goes round the Sun, or that Man was descended from monkeys.<br /> Why exactly does he think that merely taking Astronomy to beat a humanities course requirement in college, or telling Princeton professor's wife that he will have 'both' in his tea are remarkable acts of a free spirit to be recorded for posterity ?!<br />He picked a few locks, and asked some strippers if they would sleep with him - and for this he seems to have earned the eternal admiration of folks who dont even follow his physics!<br />I am not saying that (mostly male) physics grad students cant admire the (apparent) narrative of a man who can get to the point quickly with pretty women, or appear to tell it like it is to the powerful people but Why do people think that someone who is good at science is somehow suddenly qualified to make public comments on society in general?<br />Folks like Feynman (not unlike Watson's 'Double helix') do a disservice by making it all seem easy and just a rollicking adventure.  Feynman, who wrote this while in his 60s, still shows little maturity or circumspection on his life and  pretends to remain the adolescent through much of the book - it all came easily to him because of his rebellious personality, beat of a different drum, dont care do you care what other people think etc..  Really?<br /><br />  I am perhaps most disappointed that Feynman (unlike Einstein) is no (a Jewish/Yiddish phrase)  'mensch' - he pretends that physical reality (and personal gratification)  exists outside of human society and its well-known problems.  [This  tone-deaf world-view seems also to have been with J. R. Oppenheimer who was eager to use public resources  build the atomic bomb in the Manhattan project, fulfilling a need for personal achievement, but then after it had killed 200,000 people as expected, lectured President Truman about his guilt on 'having blood on his hands'  Truman, furious,  never wanted to see that sonof*****h again'.]<br />  Here is crude stereotype:  Why do so many prominent American Jews at the same time seek to upbraid but seek approval or acknowledgement  from the (then  dominant American culture (aka the 'white Anglo-Saxon Protestant').  Much of Feynman's story, as he tells it, seems to me trying to prove  that Jews know how to have fun too.  This is seems idiotic, and is disservice to the manifest creative and intellectual achievements of their heritage. Besides, he wasnt supposed to 'care what others think'.<br /><br />The problem for the 99.999% of humanity that is not naturally talented genius is that they, like it or not, do need to care what other people think, simply to make through life and a career.<br />And how to do this, Feynman's look-at-me stories offer no clue.turally talented genius is that they, like it or not, do need to care what other people think, simply to make through life and a career.<br />And how to do this, Feynman's look-at-me stories offer no clue.

1400069181|5.0|\\"Start Something That Matters\\" by Toms founder Blake Mycoskie is part instructional, part motivational, and part auto-biography.  It's a very easy read with inspiring stories from Toms and other companies.  I found myself wanting to highlight many lines to come back to.

B005LJK3AC|2.0|It's a sort of implausible story, which would be okay, if the humour didn't sound primarily in 'attitude.'  It's not bad, and probably 'middling' but because you expect more from these actors, you come off more disappointed than you'd expect, even if you don't expect that much.<br /><br />If you're bored and looking for decent comedy, there are just probably better options, is all.
B005M92MJ6|5.0|I am thoroughly impressed with this album. I am a big Tool and APC fan, but none of the other Puscifer albums have come close to this effort (in my opinion). What this does confirm to me is that Maynard hasn't lost a step.
B004G5ZY7E|3.0|\\"The Snowman\\", the seventh book in a series, was written by Jo Nesbo a Norwegian author and musician and translated by Don Bartlett a freelance translator living in Norfolk England. The novel features the detective Harry Hole first published in Norway in 1997 under the title \\"The Bat Man\\". Nesbo was born in 1960 and lives in Oslo. He graduated from the Norwegian School of Economics with a degree in Economics and Business Administration and worked for a time as a stockbroker before beginning his writing career.<br /><br />The story is written with anonymous narration and character dialog. The writing is straight forward and uncomplicated. The composition contains numerous references to places and things Norwegian that may be quite unfamiliar to the reader.<br /><br />In short, the story involves the mysterious disappearance and death of several women, their demise preceded by the construction of a snowman. The investigation into the deaths is headed by Harry Hole and his new partner Katrine Bratt.  Harry has some notoriety for his investigative talent that previously brought a serial killer to justice and is now heading up the investigation into the current case. The story opens with young Jonas Becker calling in to report his mother, Birte, missing and the investigative team of Harry and Katrine at the home examining the circumstances surrounding her disappearance including interviewing the husband, Filip Becker, who just returned from an overnight trip. The following scene finds former detective, Gert Rafto taking a phone call and meeting the killer in Nordnes Park. From here, Harry and Bratt set about solving the case. The tale takes a number of twists and turns until the final pieces of the puzzle come together with a thrilling conclusion.<br /><br />This detective mystery was ok by all other standards of review. It's just that so many murder mysteries have been written, it's hard to get excited by another one. The writing was generally good, so the reader is moved along in the tale. The constant references to Norwegian street names that are impossible to say are a notable distraction. Harry Hole is not a particularly likeable fellow - a drunk, no less. It seems strange to depict a detective that operates in law enforcement to be inebriated or at best, hung over, while on the job. I suppose this may be indicative of a socialized country that doesn't value individual achievement much -why else would you do that? The underlying mystery in the tale is not particularly convincing either, but you will have to judge that for yourself for it is the basis for the murders after all.<br /><br />All in all, this novel did not excite me. It was no better than most and there are a lot that are better. If you are a murder mystery lover, you may find some reason to like it. Of my categories \\"Forgettable\\" -\\"Pleasurable-not memorable\\" - \\"Memorable\\" I would rate this Pleasurable-not memorable.tant references to Norwegian street names that are impossible to say are a notable distraction.

0553386794|4.0|Original comments posted:<br /><br />In my quest for the next big fantasy series, I decided to give A Game of Thrones a try. I've heard a LOT about it. The concept sounded very, very compelling, and HBO thought it was good enough to do a series (which I've not seen). I really wanted to like this book because it's supposed to be the \\"greatest modern fantasy\\" of our time etc. What I found out is that it's basically the Sopranos (or any mafia film) set in a fantasy world.<br /><br /> I can't believe people think this book is \\"realistic\\" and \\"gritty.\\" What's even more shocking to me is that people defend the abuse of women by saying \\"Oh yes, that's the way it was in the Middle Ages.\\" Umm, anyone who thinks that clearly hasn't A. read THIS book, or B. hasn't read any source material from the Middle Ages. Yes, Western Europe in the Middle wages was certainly misogynistic -- but nothing like we see in A Game of Thrones. This \\"gritty realism\\" is so over the top, it actually is borderline parody. In fact, I wonder if Martin doesn't intend it as such, and all his fans aren't aware of it?<br /><br /> With that aside, I actually have no problem with the portrayal of women, rape, sex, etc. That's the world Martin has created, that's good enough for me. What I do have a problem with is how incredibly tedious the book is. Nothing happens. There is no story or plot, but rather just a zillion characters who blather on like a bunch of politicians trying to figure out how to screw one another out of an election. If you enjoy politically based soap operas, byzantine intrique and mafia style murders, this book will be the one for you. All of this talk about how Martin has created a fantasy world full of grey characters is both true and false. It's true no one is all good and that his characters are grey -- what's untrue is the assumption that all other fantasy has nothing but black and white characters. People who bash Tolkien for having all black and white characters are simply too dense to get the subtleties of the characters in his world. I think Martin knows this, and therefore beats you over the head and shouts through a bullhorn that his characters aren't perfect. I love \\"grey\\" characters, again, that's not the problem for me. The problem is that it takes forever for anything to happen, and as soon as something interesting does happen, well the next 5 chapters cut away to 5 other characters. By the time we get back to the first character I've lost interest. Maybe I just don't have the patience for this book, that could be.<br /><br />I will say that Martin is a FANTASTIC writer. He is tight, sharp, and essentially brilliant. The story is compelling. Even now I WANT to like it, but I just can't. In fact, I couldn't even finish the book. It just takes too long to go anywhere. If you've always wanted to see Day of Our Lives, or the Sopranos in a fantasy world, this is the book for you, it's just not for me. Martin is a brilliant author -- no doubt about it. But comparing Game of Thrones to other fantasy works is apples and oranges. This really is the Sopranos in Middle Earth -- if that appeals to you, you'll love this book, I guess it just isn't my cup of tea.<br /><br />UPDATED REVIEW as of 2/22/2012<br /><br />I decided to give Game a Thrones a second try -- and I must say this time I actually \\"enjoyed\\" the book (if one can enjoy something as violent as this book). In fact, I have a new appreciation for this book's story. As I said in my original review, Martin is a fantastic writer, but initially I felt that he was a poor storyteller. After giving the book another go around, I found the story quite compelling. I think the problem is everyone kept telling me that this is \\"the next Lord of the Rings\\" and that Martin is the \\"American Tolkien.\\" Look, I get that Martin's fans love his work, but people should STOP saying that kind of stuff. This is nothing like LOTR and Martin writes nothing like Tolkien. To make comparisons like that gives peoplea certain impression about the book which are simply unfounded. I love to read everything, not just Tolkien like work, but when people say a book is the next LOTR and it turns out to be the Sopranos in the Middle Earth, it actually turns people OFF to a book which people might otherwise enjoy.<br /><br />In all honesty, I still think the book drags in places, and I can't figure out if its deliberate on Martin's part or not, but on a second read through I really enjoyed the book and I will most definitely read the second one, though I'm not sure I can read them all back to back.<br /><br />If you're a fantasy fan, this is definitely worth a try. It is NOT Tolkien, or ANYTHING like what many fantasy fans look for. That is both good and bad, but for the most part it is good. Will people be talking about this series 50 years from now? Its too early to tell. I think probably not. I don't think it will have the lasting power that Tolkien or even Terry Brooks' books do, but it is none the less a fantastic book and I'm looking forward to reading the second book.ded.

0486407217|2.0|Not much variety in this book. If one is making a wardrobe for one person, this would be okay, bur for a variety of looks, look elsewhere. The riding habit is  probably the only patterns that I would take from in this book.
B005ER6STG|4.0|this movie is all about shock value. the story line is pretty interesting for the most part. its just filled with disturbing sexual scenes that has blood and gore in it. if your disturbing like i am watch it but if not then be warned to see some sick ****.
B000TXZVGQ|5.0|I've just recently watched this series, my mother has talked about how much she loves it and when I saw it on DVD, I decided to try it out. And Wow! My So-Called Life is an amazing show! A show that will everyone will enjoy and one I'll be happy to let my daughters watch when they're older. It's a real look at the life of being a teenager and reminded me so much of myself at that age, as I'm sure it will remind everyone else who watches it of themselves at that age and what it's like to be a teenager trying to fit in in high school. I recommend this show to everyone! It's definitely a must-see!

B0055SWM08|5.0|I initially bought this because of all the great reviews/ straight forward premise. let me just say that this is easily the best game for the value on the market. you'll find yourself deeply immersed in the gameplay while the music takes you to a serene location. long story short: Great game!
0307352145|5.0|I must admit....when I read the synopsis of this book I hesitated to order it.  I'm an introvert, so I thought to myself \\"what could I possibly learn by reading a book about something with which I'm very familiar?\\"  I went ahead and ordered the book, thinking that - if nothing else - perhaps my extroverted family and friends could read it in order to understand me better.  Well, I'm glad I ordered it, as I found it very enlightening and inspiring.    Ms. Cain really hit the proverbial nail on the head with her explanations of how society views introverts....and the repercussions this has on these \\"quiet\\" people.  She also did a great job of researching various aspects of how introverts are treated in a society that reveres extroversion.  Introverts - the people who sit quietly and take everything in before speaking - can offer just as much (if not more) to society than extroverts, yet they are frequently thought of as ignorant or strange because they don't fit into the \\"norm.\\"  As I said in the title of this review, EVERYONE should read this book.  Extroverts can benefit from it because they will learn more about the introverts in their life.  Introverts will benefit because they will learn more about themselves and realize that they are perfectly normal!!
B002BWQ6H6|5.0|This is the best book I have read in such a long time. The writing was wonderful. The characters were fullbodied. And the plot, with its twists and complexity was superb!
B003Q6D2B4|5.0|Like action comedies with a great cast? This is it! I'm a fan of everyone in the cast, (they even included Ernest Borgnine!) and it makes the movie that much more enjoyable. Watched it for the second time, will be watching it several more. A fun ride!
B002GZQYMK|1.0|I met Muse only recently. Via Hullabaloo. I was blown away. Love at first sight. Bought Origin of Symmetry, as recommended by a friend since these tracks feature on his Hulla... Loved it. Bought Absolution thanks to Chris Billings' most popular favorable review of The Resistance. Listened carefully to The Resistance twice through, attentively. Decided it is an awful disappointment. First track is Muse meets disco. Second track is Muse meets electronica, then Muse meets Queen (Freddy Mercury in fact), and so it goes on until Muse meets symphonic music. Don't let anyone get away by describing lack of inspiration as experimenting with other genres. This can only appeal to those too young to know the sources from the 60s 70s and 80s. Time has gone, and sadly so have those genres, because they were the least interesting. So I find this album commercial in the pejorative sense. There is only one good track on it: 'Unnatural Selection'. As far as the 'symphony' is concerned, why not rather listen to a real one. The cut and paste simply does not work, is contrived and pretentious. Buy it, but in a year or two you'll be using it as driving music or car washing music...
B00005B1W7|5.0|Leon Uris wrote many books.  QBVII was one of his better ones made into first a mini series, then VHS & finally a dvd.  I would encourage anyone who is not familiar with his literature, to purchase any form of it.  You won't be sorry.
B005GVA2L0|5.0|Amy Lee is an amazing vocalist.  This release has a different sound to it than \\"Fallen\\" or \\"The Open Door\\" but the strong lovely range of Lee's vocals carry you through the songs.  I especially like \\"The Change\\", \\"Sick\\", \\"End of the Dream\\" and the bonus track \\"New Way to Bleed\\".  It is refreshing to hear new music from Evanescence after being unmoved by most of the songs played on the radio now days.  I enjoy the music more by listening to a few songs here and there instead of trying to listen to the entire CD straight through.  This music needs to be taken in slowly to really appreciate it.  I find the more I listen to this CD the more I love it.  I am glad I spent the money and ordered this.
B001PJRAUS|5.0|I saw the trailer for this movie and it was instantly put on my wish list. I kept thinking about it all the time, so I finally ordered it and I was NOT disappointed. Although I didn't care for some elements in the movie, it was full of twists and things I never expected and it kept my attention the whole time... there were some parts which I was so surprised that I actually said, \\"Did that really just happen?\\" \\"Did she really just do that?\\" \\"There is no way!\\"  After I watched it, I went back later that night and rewatched all of my favorite clips in the movie. I usually don't care for twists on stories, but this movie left me wishing that something like that could really happen.

B004A8EI9M|5.0|I like zombie survival stories...my top picks for movies are Dawn of the Dead (new one), 28 days later, and maybe Resident Evil 1. I like the fact they actually aim down the sight in Walking Dead.  I made some other good background observations and they have been doing well with the \\"realism\\" if we can even say that about a Zombie movie.  They stole the beginning from 28 days later; however, I knew this would be better because 28 days later is under 2 hours long, this series is up to 5 or so hours now.

B000VS6R26|5.0|Titanic has been spoofed over and over. And most of us can't stand the theme song by Celine Dion's anymore at all. But still, that doesn't detract from the movie. Great cast, great story and ultimately moving. This will pass down as one of the classics.
B0055EDBIE|5.0|I remember, back in 1989, when Lenny Kravitz released his debut \\"Let Love Rule\\" and hearing it multiple times while working in a Soundwarehouse music store in Aurora, Colorado. He was considered retro back then as he tended to capture that 70's vibe in his music, but at the same time he had a contemporary edge. I wasn't sold on Kravitz at the time, though I remember liking some of the songs on that album. In 1991, when he released \\"Mama Said\\", I really didn't enjoy \\"It Ain't Over Til It's Over\\", his best known hit. So it wasn't until 1993's \\"Are You Gonna To Go My Way\\" that I bought a Lenny Kravitz album. I wasn't entirely impressed with it. Since that time I've felt all of his albums have been it or miss, or uneven at best.<br /><br />That is, until now. I rarely, if ever, say that an artist has made the best album of their career this late in the game. That's what I'm going to say about \\"Black And White America\\". This has to be the most consistent Lenny Kravitz album AND his most musically adventurous and diverse. I know this album was originally intended to follow 2001's \\"Lenny\\" (and just take a moment to think if it had been! \\"Lenny\\" is one of Kravitz's finest albums, and at that time he was in top form, so this album would have ensured superstardom), but it was shelved in favor of \\"Baptism\\" which is not his best work. So, \\"Black And White America\\" has been gestating for years, and it's no wonder that you can find no less than 20 songs depending on where you bought this album. I myself only have 17 tracks.<br /><br />It is a rare thing to be able to put together 16+ tracks and they all gel together and each track is a keeper, but \\"Black And White America\\" is just that, with barely (and arguably) any weak tracks here. The three singles that have already been released are diverse and strong choices. \\"Come On And Get It\\" is a typical Kravitz rocker like \\"Fly Away\\". \\"Stand\\" is something new, harking back to an r&b pop sound with a positive message. \\"Rock Star City Life\\" is like \\"Where Are We Runnin'?\\" Elsewhere, \\"Liquid Jesus\\" plays like a long lost Marvin Gaye hit, and there's two power-ballads in a John Lennon, \\"Imagine\\" style, with \\"The Faith Of A Child\\" and \\"Dream\\", two of Kravitz's finest ballads. \\"Sunflower\\" finds him in full electronic mood, sounding (gasp!) 1980's! Yes, you will find more of that on this album for the first time. It's as if Kravitz has decided to embrace the next classic decade. \\"Everything\\" is a nice funky rocker that should be the next single. He's even got some reggae hip-hop on \\"Boongie Drop\\" that works quite well here with a rap from Jay-Z and some MC-ing from DJ Military.<br /><br />It's unfortunate that this album arrived this year, as I don't think it's received the recognition it deserves! This could be the beginning of a renaissance for Kravitz if he continues down this musical path. \\"Black And White America\\" could be his \\"Sgt. Pepper's\\".<br /><br />Here's how \\"Black And White America\\" compares to Kravitz's previous work:<br /><br />1989 Let Love Rule: Four Stars<br />1991 Mama Said: Three Stars<br />1993 Are You Gonna Go My Way: Three and a Half Stars<br />1995 Circus: Three Stars<br />1998 5: Three and a Half Stars<br />2001 Lenny: Four Stars<br />2004 Baptism: Three Stars<br />2008 It Is Time For A Love Revolution: Three and a Half Stars<br />2011 Black And White America: Five StarsAre We Runnin'?\\" Elsewhere, \\"Liquid Jesus\\" plays like a long lost Marvin Gaye hit, and there's two power-ballads in a John Lennon, \\"Imagine\\" style, with \\"The Faith Of A Child\\" and \\"Dream\\", two of Kravitz's finest ballads. \\"Sunflower\\" finds him in full electronic mood, sounding (gasp!) 1980's!

B000G8NXYG|4.0|I watched this movie after hearing so much hype. While I don't think it's the best movie ever, nor even Kurosawa's best, I still believe it was a pretty good movie. It's long, but the main samurai are really good characters, and the war strategy was pretty fun to look at.
B004WDRT1Y|5.0|I watched this movie a hundred times with my oldest son when it first came out. Now it is even better watching it with my 6 year old on our new 3d tv! LOVE IT!!!!
B000N4SHPS|4.0|I grew up watching Rocky movies on TV. I really liked all of them, except the fifth movie. To me, that movie was always a bad way to end the great Rocky saga. Thankfully, this movie was made, and it brings a lot of heart with it. The movie was emotional, and without spoiling too much, gave a decent conclusion to the character we all love. Thumbs up!

B003YL4LYI|2.0|I had a professor once that said you should make any work of art strange enough to be interesting, but if you get too weird, people will get bored and go do something else. I had a lot of time to think about that precept while I was reading this book, because my mind was constantly wandering as I dutifully trudged through these tedious pages.  Maybe I should start off by saying I really loved the first two or three books. In most books you're willing to put up with a certain amount of what you could call informational garbage. Pages that aren't necessary to the plot, but they fill out the characters in an interesting way. The detail on the whaling industry in Moby Dick is an often-noted example. There seems to be a lot of dalliance for its own sake in these books, and although at first it's something I put up with and even enjoyed, somewhere the balance tipped and beyond that point the book became a slog.  I read one review the title of which was apt and creative: \\"The song has become a noodling free jam\\". When a main character dies, it's exciting and chilling, and you wonder who's going to fill the power vacuum. But after five books, they're dropping like flies; you invest time and emotion in a major charismatic player, they get murdered, and you stop seeing the value in emotional investment. On the other side of that same coin, so many of these dead characters become magically resurrected that it's usually two or three hundred pages before I allow myself to believe that someone is actually dead.  I wanted to finish the book, so, even though I wasn't enjoying it per se, I plowed through the final three or four hundred pages. The ending of the book was like the beginning and the middle. Seemed somewhat vague and unsatisfying; why should we care about these characters? Where's the trajectory? What's the point?
B004EPZ08E|4.0|I was watching this last night, and I really enjoyed it. I felt related mostly because my boss is a female version of the Kevin Spacey character. The feelings, the whining at the local bar, etc, those are things a lot of the working class do! Who hasn't dreamed of throwing that evil boss from a 10 story building? I have! The movie really helped me get rid of the stress from work.
B005WWBP1O|5.0|This book set back in the early 19th century is a great read for those that love history, romance as well as a sense of exploration into several character's lives. A great novel from the 18th century.
0439023521|4.0|After hearing so much hype about this book series, I finally decided to give it a shot.  I'll start by saying that the plot and theme of the book really did not interest me at all, but it's gotten so much praise (including from people I know and trust) that I put my personal preferences aside and gave it a whirl.  I'm glad I did.  It took me a few chapters to really \\"get in\\" to the story, but once I did, I didn't want to put it down.<br /><br />I know this is a young adult science fiction novel, but I found it to be appealing.  Parts were a bit brutal, gory, etc., but that's the nature of the beast in this case.  The author tells this story in a first person, almost rapid fire style.  You're reading the book as if things are happening at that exact moment - not in the past.  The science fiction element only added to the suspense.  With names like Glimmer, Foxface, Cinna, etc. you're transported to a different time and place - where hovercraft roam and things can appear by the push of a button or a silver parachute - where jabberjays and mockingjays exist and you never know what is coming next.  I'm excited to get my hands on Catching Fire to continue the saga.

B0055D3EOG|4.0|Horror movies are tough to pull off and be scary all the way through ....usually, something becomes too predictable, or campy or unbelievable or once it is revealed that whatever makes up the 'horror' is , it loses a lot of steam  , real quick. This one fits right in there for me...The movie was really good and suspenseful and most of all believable...that element alone makes any horror movie a cut above because so few are. This one was like that until the point when it got revealed what was going on and particularly where the dad stepped in to save his kid...that part just went to straight camp land for me right to the end. Even with the sort-of-expected twist to the ending.  Before that, it had a great element of the unknown , almost a pyschological thriller on top of a horror movie. But, since precious few horror movies have a good , genuine , believable scary or creepy element thruout MOST of the movie, as this one does, I give it 4 stars.
0156027321|2.0|Life Of Pi follows the life of Pi Piscine Molitor Patel. He is a normal Indian boy until his family moves to Canada by boat. The boat sinks and Pi's mental and physical toughness is tested, along with his faith. He experiences much death a long the way and even at times he comes close to death. Along the way Pi develops relationships with other creatures on the boat with him or even small things such as barnacles on his boat.  The first part of the book seemed dull however was very important in the end, as many of the things in the first part are later found in the second or third. The first part describes Pi's three religions: Hinduism, Islam, and Christianity. He is often ridiculed for having three faiths. Also, in the first part Pi's personal life is described and how he grew up. In the second part is where the book gets better, Pi must survive in a vast ocean with all odds against him. The third is the conclusion of Pi's journey of everything he has been through.  Life Of Pi teaches many lessons. One lesson is that with faith we can survive through anything, had Pi lost his faith in God during his journey he most likely would of never survived and ended up just like the zebra, hyena, or orange juice, dead. The book also teaches to always believe in yourself, Pi may have become sad at times but he believed in his ability to survive.  Life Of Pi will leave you thinking. The ending is not one like many other books. Anyone could interpret the ending differently depending on who you are. Although I did not enjoy Life Of Pi that much I still suggest reading it.

1439153663|4.0|\\"The Kitchen House\\" is a look into life on a Virginia Plantation, circa late 1700s. A touching and personal look at specific individuals; slaves, plantation owners and families and the complexity of their society. It shows us the sad story of race-mixing at the hands of land-owners who abused their female slaves.  This is a fast read, and a page-turner.  The writing is good; it is  straight-forward, though not particularly rich language.  The story is written in the vernacular of the slaves' speech, where that is part of the story-line.  The story is based on specific characters, some are kitchen (house) slaves, others are members of the household. Each chapter describing that character's viewpoint of an event. The story focuses on the life of a young white girl, who, having lost her Irish parents during their ocean crossing, serves as an indentured servant, working alongside the kitchen slaves.  I enjoyed the story and will recomend it for my bookclub.
B004LWZW4C|3.0|To much special effects not enough story line. The writers could come up with a better story line. It seems they made this movie just for the money.
B0058A119G|5.0|I have always loved the music of Alan and Marilyn Bergman and only Ms. Barbra could do it justice. Absolutely stunning. I am amazed at how well she sounded after all this time.
6305212112|5.0|This movie is wonderful! It deals with so many themes - grief, aging, racism, tyo name a few. The two stories - that of a frumpish middle-aged woman trying to come to terms with her own issues, and that of the older woman, life(Jessica Tandy), are juxtaposed and interplay with each other. There are also some nitty-gritty themes such as that of confronting racism. The characters, especially the more vulnerable ones, are sympathetically portrayed by soe really good acting. In the end, as we discover, the wife-beater gets what he deserves!
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|This is a great product to use if you like to have notes in multiple places and have them all be in sync. iPhone, android, pc, Yay!
B00006JDVV|4.0|This is a good movie! Granted, the premise is somewhat absurd (the world has been trashed by fire-breathing dragons), but it makes for a good plot with people eking out a miserable existence, hiding from the threat of the dragons (the movie has echoes of some of the Mad Max movies) Eventually, someone discovers a way to destroy them - there is only one male, and kill him, and you kill the species.   There is, of course, the priceless line uttered by Quinn: \\"Only one thing worse than dragons - Americans!\\"  An above-average movie.
B004RCUJ9E|5.0|I can honestly say I would easily pay full price, this is a great app! I saw that they had a checkers and chess game, bought the chess game as well. My son and I will love playing this on my HP Touchpad (with the Cyanogen mod).
1451629184|5.0|When I first heard of this kidnapping I was just \\"freaked out\\". I was waiting for a book to be publised so that I could understand how a child, now adult, be so close to home and have so many chances,or it seemed, to runaway. But Jaycee gives you an understanding on how hard it really was to just run. She is amazing and after seeing the interview with diane sawyer, Jaycee truly is a wonderful woman with tremendous strength and courage.Her interview shows how strong and beautiful she really is, with smiles and fear. I just can't put what I see in her in words. But the book really gave me a better understanding and shows how the system truly fails so many americans everyday.Since I have read the book, I do not go one night without giving my son a kiss goodnight and tell him more now than ever before how much I love him. A true heartfelt book. Truly amazing.
0920668372|1.0|Rarely have I seen a book so polarizing. The 5- and 1-star reviews combine for almost ninety percent of the over 1000 reviews. By the time you are done reading this review, it should be well and truly clear on which side of the inversely curved bell I sit.<br /><br />The modern classic with which this is often (and ironically) confused is [[ASIN:0763641758 Guess How Much I Love You]]. *That* is a perfect choice for communicating infinite love to a child. There are no doubt many other worthy choices for your family.<br /><br />*This* is not such a book. The cover of this book should be plastered with a warning: Welcome to Creepville.<br /><br />It's not enough that intervention should have been attempted soon after the monster toddler flushed his mother's watch down the toilet, or that the mother's own scream--\\"THIS KID IS DRIVING ME CRAZY!!!\\"--approaches verbal child abuse.<br /><br />No, this book offer much deeper insights into the fractured human psyche. Years later, and on dark nights, we see the mother drive across town (uninvited), climb up into her adult son's upper bedroom (with the aid of a ladder: such activities are known in my town as 'breaking and entering'), pick up her adult son--her *sleeping* adult son--and hold him. Ewwww[...] A more selfish and dysfunctional relationship I have never seen outside the [[ASIN:0890420629 DSM-IV]].<br /><br />At the climax of this sordid tale, the roles are reversed and the son holds his elderly mother, repeating the mantra, \\"I'll love you forever, I'll like you for always, as long as I'm living my Mommy you'll be.\\" He then perpetuates the ritual by rocking his own baby daughter, thus ensuring that the creepy dynamic lives on like some recycled B-Movie villain.<br /><br />In summary, this ranks among the worst children's books I have ever had the misfortune to read. And believe me: I've seen [[ASIN:B000KENMR4 some]] [[ASIN:2894295057 stinkers]]. When I learned recently that the author of Love You Forever has been diagnosed as obsessive-compulsive and manic-depressive, and is in fact a former cocaine addict and alcoholic, everything made sense. Sad, pitiful sense.n fact a former cocaine addict and alcoholic, everything made sense. Sad, pitiful sense.

B005LZYL3G|1.0|The deluxe edition is out of print and won't be reprinted, so if you're a fan and couldn't make it to the ten club in time, Pearl Jam wants you to know that YOU DON'T MATTER ANYMORE.  Also, this Blu-ray doesn't come out until after Xmas because it's a best buy exclusive. It's sickening to see a band like Pearl Jam stoop so damn low.

6304711905|2.0|I've tried to watch \\"Tombstone\\" many times but have been unable to watch it all the way through because it's just plain SILLY.  On the other hand I've watched \\"Wyatt Earp,\\" the Kevin Costner movie a dozen times, and will probably watch it a dozen more.  It fascinates me.
6304118392|3.0|One of my favorite flicks of all time, in a not so great package. The movie played great, but it would have been nice to know the cover was in such bad shape. It had some \\"mystery substance\\" on it that i had to chip off with a knife, had to glue part of it back together as well. It was listed as \\"very good\\". Other than the bad cover, everything else was great. I know the condition of the cover i not the sellers responsibility, however the listing is, and this one was a bit less than \\"very good\\".
B004DMNT2W|5.0|This is easily the best video camera case I have ever owned.<br /><br />I've been a fan of Lowepro products for a while but outside of there packs I've never owned a stand alone accessory prior to this. I travel a great deal and carry a military style backpack that has M.O.L.L.E. attachment points so that I can attach a variety of external pouches on the pack depending on my need for that trip. This case fits with in the frame work.<br /><br />Pro's<br />-Very good padding. I have not had any issues with bumping my camera on things and getting damage.<br />-Internal elastic band to pull the case tight around the camera and hold the camera in place. The band secures the camera without causing issues when putting the camera in or taking it out of the case.<br />-Case handles rougher than normal wear an tear.<br />-Great looped zipper tab that makes it easier to get the case open when wearing gloves.<br /><br />If you need a great digital video case this item is very much worth a look.

B005CM9DX6|3.0|I've been a major fan since Still Life came out. The more I listened to this album, the more irritated I became. The one and two star reviews previously have absolutely and concisely expressed my thoughts. I'm glad I wasn't the only one. If this is to be the future of Opeth, then my collection will end with Watershed, which is no bad pace to end. I just wish if Mikael wanted to do a solo album, that he did one under his own name,as a seperate solo project. It's a shame to be under utilising such talented musicians.    I absolutely ragged on this album upon first listen. But, I'm going to give them the benefit of the doubt.You'll have to make your own mind up as to whether it is to your liking or not. I still am.
B004P8JPS6|4.0|I've always been a huge Reacher fan. I've read or listened to every Reacher book. I bought this on Audible mainly because I love Dick Hill as Jack Reacher. The plot was good but at times a little contrived and when finally revealed, left me a little wanting. This book is sort of a prequel, told by Reacher as the past, and fills in some of the gaps we have all been wondering about from the beginning.For Reacher fans, that alone is worth the price. I agree with another reviewer, \\"mediocre Reacher is still good.\\" In Child's past books, however, Reacher's sexual encounters were mostly intimated. This book is more graphic in nature sexually and a bit too much for me, especially as a listening audience. It's still a fun read. I still liked the book and greatly anticipate the next.
0440241901|5.0|This book is a definite MUST READ. Absolutely HILARIOUS. I couldn't put the book down, I read it in a day. I was literally LAUGHING OUT LOUD. And since I read this at work, people kept looking at me. But I didn't care. It was just so funny.  Definitely worth $1.99! This is the first book I've ever read by Sophie Kinsella, and I think I will check some more out! :)
B0041KKYH4|5.0|I really don't get the bad reviews. I am a college instructor and although the film deals with high school teachers, I thought it was eerily realistic and funny. We all know the goofy overly serious/annoying folks who teach, the people who do it for the money with little commitment, and the people who are just plain nutters. This film has all of the above. Sure, Diaz curses a lot (show me someone who doesn't), and takes drugs (bad because it is dangerous and illegal), but other than those elements, this is a hilarious look at both the profession and at women who work to 'mainly find rich husbands.' Of course, Diaz learns her lesson by the close of the film and settles for real over dollars...but it is a really fun ride getting there. My fave part is when she shows teacher centered films to her class (i.e. Dangerous Minds) while being a terrible teacher. HA! A true spoof of bad teachers. Worth a watch for sure. In terms of a grade, it gets a B.
B0058WFO06|5.0|Steven Wilson's album, Grace For Drowning, is a great album.  His first solo album, Insurgentes, had many unique and interesting tracks.  If you expect this album to follow the same themes, you would be wrong.  Steven has developed a style that changes but remains the same through most of his work.  Grace For Drowning has lots of retro prog sounds, as well of lots of jazz fusion.  It gives off an experimental David Lynch vibe with some of the eeriness of the tracks, while maintaining catch riffs and song structures.  If you are a fan of classic prog rock such as King Crimson or a fan of any of Steven's other bands you will dig this.  Might be his best work to date.
B00004CZDS|1.0|After waiting for a lengthy delivery for the \\"free\\" shipping from Amazon I gave this item as a gift shipping it to the recipient in another state. Unfortunately it was not compatible with the standard DVD player (wouldn't work on 3 different players) and must have been made for foreign players. The child was very dissapointed and I am now out of the purchase cost and he is without his long awaited gift.
B005WWBP1O|5.0|Pride and Prejudice is instant classic.The book is very informative is a a must read. Reading the book felt like it took no time at all because I was swept away in its world.
0385534639|3.0|This book is difficult to review. It starts off wonderful, but slumps quickly. In fact, I found myself forcing myself to keep reading, until the middle at which it picks up steam again, but never quite reaches its potential. Some people suggest there is no plot, but there is. And it's really a wonderful one. It's the execution that falls short. The author clearly has a talent with words. The world she creates particularly with the circus is vivid and magical; unfortunately, she's unable to give the same color and texture to her characters. Aside from the clothes the characters wear, we don't really get to the know them well. The author is able to describe a vivid setting, but she tells (as opposed to shows) us about her characters instead of letting us learn about them through their actions, thoughts and words. Time is a theme in the book as well, but the constant moving between times got confusing. I was always referring back to previous chapters to orient myself when we returned to a character in a different time. Near the end of the book, there is a chapter set in November the next chapter takes place the previous October and the following chapter is back in November. Another time it's October 1902 and the next chapter is August 1902. Then there's the large jumps in time between the 1890's and 1900's. Overall I think the concept is terrific and the circus descriptions were wonderful, but what makes a great book is the characters and they just didn't come alive as you'd expect them too considering the talent of the author to create vivid settings and the storyline.
B005WWBP1O|5.0|I have to say that \\"Pride & Prejudice\\" is my favorite Jane Austen novel, and as an English teacher I have read them all.  This is a great edition.
B004HO6I4W|5.0|This movie worked great, and i had no issues playing it i was very happy with the product. The Digital copy worked great as well.
B004EPZ07K|2.0|I wonder when Hollywood is going to screw up 'Gone With the wind\\" there batting almost 100% with remaking movies from old story's . They did do a good job on superman I must admit and Dick Tracy .I wonder if they had ever read the history of the green lantern ?  The Green Lantern is the shared primary alias of several fictional characters, super heroes appearing in comic books published by DC Comics. The first Green Lantern (Alan Scott) was created by writer Bill Finger and artist Martin Nodell  in All-American Comics #16 (July 1940). lets repeat  that date 1940!!! why do they have to change things  The ring of the Golden Age Green Lantern (Alan Scott) is magically powered.Oh well who cares Hollywood doesn't, but thought I would give my two cents. The special effects where ok but I do think they are getting cared away with them. I'll give this movie two stars..next time try not to change the story make the way it  was written , if you would have done this I could have given it four stars and I think you would have gotten a lot better reviews .

B000OVLBEO|1.0|It was used. Next time you put something in sale plz let the people know if is truly new. The dvd box came with marks all over the front.
B002V9PEUE|5.0|Ok, so this movie is pretty good as is, BUT in Blue Ray with a large High Definition TV and Sound System...WOW!!!!<br />What a difference.<br />For those that have not seen this movie, one of Sylvester Stallone classics. Great action, fast paced and outstanding visuals.<br />The first 5 minutes will get your attention.
B0041KKYH4|3.0|Comment: I don't think this is a piece of crap... but it isn't too far away from it. It's more of that mindless stereo type humor that for some reason finds a place with younger viewers. Was I entertained by this film? Just enough to not turn it off at the half way point. I don't know Cameron Daze and this will probably upset a lot of her fans, but it looked to me like she didn't have to stretch her acting ability much for this role. This is another movie that places (white) males in the role of stupid and dumb, having been \\"de-nutted\\" by women in general. On the other hand it shows how out of control women are getting with them gathering up the \\"de-nutted\\" nuts and adding screaming and anger to their newly liberated freedom and \\"power\\" (I can hear the howls already...).
B005KQVDH8|4.0|As usual, this is a great blue ray version of a classic movie. Brings back memories of childhood adventures. Overall, the movie itself is awesome and is a must for any child or family movie night.<br />My only small complaint is the special features are not put together well and are almost worthless to watch. Can't really say to much as this was done during the time \\"making of\\" and \\"special features\\" really weren't a big thing yet.
0061784788|3.0|I enjoyed the previous Rollins novel I read, [[ASIN:B005LBYQ6M The Judas Strain]], for the gripping, action-packed thriller it was. Good intrigue, good action, good mystery, good suspense, good characters. The pages flew by.<br /><br />I'd love to be able to say the same about The Devil Colony, especially given its fascinating subject matter, but the truth is that the more revealed about the central mystery -- a group of Native Americans as the lost tribe of Israel? -- the less I felt a need to go on. The way that mystery unfolded was enjoyable, but uneven pacing, a few needless subplots, and a too-cartoonish villain had me stalling out repeatedly through the middle third of this novel.<br /><br />Rollins certainly has a talent for making the reader turn pages, but as compelling as the mystery was, it's the only reason I kept chugging forward. Much of the action fell flat (save for a thrilling volcano escape sequence) and I didn't have a strong connection to the characters.<br /><br />Solid beach reading for fans of the genre -- Rollins is usually very good at what he does -- but I felt like this one could have used stronger editing.
0439023513|1.0|I read the first two thrilling and absorbing books in this series intensely, unwilling to put them down.  They are magnificent and I recommend them without reservation.<br /><br />\\"Mockingjay\\" is another kettle of fish.  I was unwilling to put it down, but in this case it was because I kept waiting and hoping for it to rise to the level of the others.  But this doesn't happen.  On the contrary, Mockingjay gets progressively worse and the ending is totally without rationality, consistency, or decency.<br /><br />I imagine the publisher screaming at Ms. Collins \\"We have a hot one here, and we have to strike while the iron is hot.  Don't worry about getting it right, just get it written!\\"<br /><br />I won't get more specific because I don't want to write a spoiler review.  But if you loved the first two books as I did, do yourself a favor and don't pollute your glowing memories by reading this piece of rot.
0385344325|5.0|The Affair is a tremendous addition to the Jack Reacher series from Lee Child.  In this entry in the Reacher saga, Child again takes the reader back to a time when Reacher was still in the military.  Long-time fans of the series will get exposed to some early derivations of the quirky traits they have come to know in previous books that were set after The Affair in time.  When Reacher is again faced with a wrong that needs to be righted, he moves forward with tenacity, ruthlessness and unparalleled survival instincts.  Perhaps a bit formulaic, but for me at least, the formula still holds appeal.  Lee Child remains firmly entrenched on my \\"must read\\" list.  This book should absolutely appeal to long-time fans.  Given that it is set in time prior to almost all of the prior books in the series and, as such is in some ways foundational in nature, it is also a great place for a new reader to jump in.
0385738773|5.0|The epic trilogy has finally come to an end. Finally isn't a word I would like to use, but I was waiting for the last installment ever since I finished The Scorch Trials.<br /><br />  Thomas and his friends are back and WICKED is still good, despite their name. Or so they say, along with Teresa. Decisions must be made, lives will be lost. The secrets of the Flare will be unraveled. Foe will become friend and friend will become foe. In short, the talented James Dashner knows how to keep us on the edge of our seats.<br /><br />  The conclusion to the thrilling Maze Runner trilogy was a web of emotions weaved together like no other. Tears and clenched fists is the least you should expect. If you had a prediction of how it would all end, just like me, you were wrong. Big time.<br /><br />  The Death Cure won't leave you disappointed. It starts with a bang and the ends with one. Rest assured, the conclusion will leave you with a feeling of content. Snag your copy as soon as you can. Unputdownable doesn't even begin to describe it.

B0049P1ZZQ|2.0|I enjoyed the show, forgiving some of the little things that annoyed me.  But the two disk Blu Ray version has a SERIOUS AUDIO PROBLEM!!!!  The volume of the conversation on screen would go from barely audible to VIOLENTLY LOUD as soon as any action occurs.  I understand the concept of raising the volume to denote the action but this isn't a little adjustment.  I would have to turn my volume up to 50 to hear the conversation then it would get so loud I had to turn the volume down to 20 during action sequences only to have to adjust the volume back to 50 when the conversation started again.  This issue alone cost it 2 stars IMHO.
0062060554|4.0|The only mystery/suspense authors I usually follow are Mary Higgens Clark and Joy Fielding but I think SJ Watson will bring great things to the genre. This book kept me intrigued throughout the whole thing, I could NOT figure out who the bad guy was. I felt as confused as she was. The ending wrapped up too quickly for my taste and I felt I did not get complete closure. We are left in suspense wondering if she will remember her life the next day or not but I still really enjoyed it.

It was about 11:00 pm with a really hard rain coming down. We went out on the back deck and turned it on. It cut through the rain and dark like a hot knife through butter. It was amazing how well it worked. We could see stuff 150 feet away like it was daylight and not raining. Buy this flashlight, you will be glad you did. It takes AA batteries and on the low setting you can have light 24/7 for over a week. R. Lee,  Rochester, NY

B003ZSJ212|5.0|I have read other reviews nit-picking this edition.  However, though I have not yet seen all the episodes, I have been quite pleased with the ones I have viewed.  Whether Darth Vader's light saber is red or pink depends on who is looking at it and the light conditions in which it is used.  More light - more pink.  Big deal!!!!  Just go for the entertainment value - it's George Lucas' work and he can choose to modify as he sees fit.
0756404738|1.0|First of all, the first book was one of the best new fantasy books I've read in a long time.  I enjoyed it a great deal and got the 2nd one immediately.  I didn't mind the fact that it rehashed a bit of the previous book, and really didn't progress as I would have expected.  I did mind that about 2/3 of the book was extremely inappropriate and had me skipping whole chapters at a time to try to find something worthwhile.  My basic analysis would be that once Kvothe meets Felurian you might as well skip to the last two or three pages, learn that he can fight a little and still wants to die for some obscure reason.  We already knew from the first book he was famous for living through Felurian, but we could do without know the why in 500 pages of details.  This was especially disappointing considering the overall clean nature of the writing of the first book.    It's really bad to lead people to expect something in the form of moderation from a moral standpoint and then destroy it utterly and completely.  I could understand if the first book had the same issues, in which case I would only have myself to blame for reading the second one.    Don't read this book if you prefer to avoid reading about random sex that supposedly makes the main character more ... well I'd say he's going for more mature, but it seems the opposite to me.  I'm considering reading the third book when it comes out, based completely on the first one, but I'm much less excited than I was after having only read The Name of the Wind.
0062065238|5.0|This book is an unexpected gem!! Surprises, psychological insight and suspense, unique perspective. I could hardly put it down. Just when you think you have answers, as in life, there are new fears, doubts and revelations. Please write more books. We will read them.
B004V50V9A|5.0|***update***  app is now being updated by the author; assume legal issues @ amazon.de have been solved  ***********  This app is great, and the tech support was fast and helpful.  I believe it's easily worth/I'd pay double the price.  Note that you have to install a 'server' program on the windows computer(s) you are using in conjunction with this app.  SOP for these apps though. I use this in conjunction with a silicondust hdhomerun prime tuner, cable, win7, and WMC.  The \\"list of channels\\" is a bit confusing, since it's their callsigns (eg, 612 WXFT); but, since opening the app the first time, I dont use it that way.  The app can list channels by how often you view them, favorite shows, arranges recordings better than WMC does, and is way more intuitive than the other remote apps on the market, and FAR more features.  I find myself using the old idea of the 'remote' on the screen much, MUCH less.  It also passes the girlfriend/wife test of usability.  Good program, and works with tablets too.  one major/minor caveat: developer is german, and due to legal issues w/ app store in germany, they cannot put the latest (tablet, etc) version up.  You can find it in the android appstore.  the version on amazon works fine on phones and is acceptable on tablets as well- we used it on a samsung galaxy and tablet just fine before upgrading to 1.6; it's just 'more better' in the upgrade.
B002VWONB2|5.0|So this was probably my 18th viewing of Casablanca. This BluRay version is the best. I wasn't around during World War II when the movie was originally released, but it wouldn't surprise me if this is a better copy than was available in theaters.

B005HS00NW|5.0|Oh Anthony how did you know to make the soundtrack for my life?  For my dreaming.  For my weeping.  For my loving...  The themes range from science fiction to just a drive in a car in the nighttime.  Touching frogs and Steve McQueen homages.  The synths and voices never waver and in fact get so beautiful that even when he screams it's like an opus.  That is what Hurry Up, We're Dreaming really is.  A mini OPUS.  Two different yet mirroring albums together.  One beautiful record.  I dare you to put this on and not let it flay you into submission.  The soundtrack to a never ending fantastical and empirical flight.  Sure you got some 60's, 70's and a heck load of glorious 80's, but the real deal is M83's effect will never leave your heart, soul or mind after listening.

My gf got annoyed bc i keleadanting to get achievements while we were supposed to be spending quality time. This leads me to believe I need a gf that's more engaging than zombies. This will be difficult to accomplish...   The almanac is hilarious with its character descriptions. the game play is engaging and very fun. worth the couple bucks!

0156027321|4.0|Yann Martel's \\"Life of Pi\\" takes place in India and the Pacific Ocean in the late 1970's, and is a coming of age novel about the adventures of a young Indian boy named Piscine Molitor Patel, or Pi for short. Pi is living a very happy and peaceful life in India when his world takes a turn, and he finds out his who family is moving to Canada,  a land completely foreign to him on the other side of the world! Soon the family's zoo is sold, the animals purchased and everyone, including the animals, are loaded onto a cargo ship called the \\"Tsimtsum\\", bound for Canada. The ship never makes it. Next thing Pi knows, he's stranded in a lifeboat in the middle of the pacific with only one companion. That companion also turns out to be a big problem, a big 450 pound, orange and black, furry problem that goes by the name of Bengal Tiger. Trapped aboard a 26 foot lifeboat with an extremely dangerous animal named Richard Parker, Pi finds himself in a predicament he never could've prepared himself for. As he soon finds out, he must both tame the beast and establish his dominance, or our little protagonist may soon become Richard's next meal. As supplies dwindle, and both Pi and the animal become more and more hungry, Pi must figure out how to handle the tiger, for the situation he is in truly falls under the category of Brains versus Brawns. With only God to guide him, Pi now's he's in for a bumpy boat ride.  While it is not the fastest paced book I have ever read, and surely not the most action-packed, \\"Life of Pi\\" did hold my attention throughout the entire novel. It makes you realize how much you can accomplish when you put your mind to something, and how much willpower can affect the outcome of a situation. It also forces you to put your faith into perspective and ask yourself where you stand in your relationship with God; how much do you trust Him? I think readers will enjoy reading about Pi's travels through the Pacific as they ponder the same questions that Pi asks himself, with the ultimate question being \\"How far are you willing to go to survive?\\"
0515149489|5.0|This was the first Nora Roberts book that I have read and will definitely NOT be the last. I loved it. I did not want it to end. I was almost late to work one day because I did not want to put it down; I haven't felt that way about a book since I read The Help. I can not wait to read my next Nora Roberts book!
030788743X|4.0|Ready Player One is a geektastic novel that invokes a nostalgic feeling for 80s geek culture.  The 80s was, in many ways, the birthplace of the modern geek culture.  Between video games, amazing geek-centric movies, the popularity and damning of role playing games like Dungeons and Dragons and the rise of progressive bands like Rush, much of what constitutes geek culture in the 2000s can trace its roots back to the 1980s.  Author Ernest Cline obviously has a fondness for the time period and knows his stuff as he fills Ready Player One to the brim with pop cultural nods and firmly ties the 80s the entire plot of the novel.  It's 2044 and the world is in shambles.  Poverty, war and other standard dystopian plot devices rule the day.  Most of the population spends the majority of their time in a virtual world (think World of Warcraft on crack) called OASIS.  OASIS started as a video game that grew in popularity to encompass multiple worlds and planets and systems that encompass virtually any geekdom you can think of (e.g. Star Wars, Star Trek, Blade Runner, steampunk, etc.).  Pretty much anything and everything is done in OASIS now.  Even schooling.  Ernest Cline spends a good chunk of the early novel setting up OASIS and creates a fairly believable depiction of what life would be like if we increasingly spent time in the virtual world as opposed to the real one.  Wade Watts is a typical teenager in 2044.  He's poor and goes to school in OASIS, where he is stuck on his schools planet because everything in OASIS involves real world transactions.  In an interesting nod to the current financial situations engulfing our current world, OASIS currency is valued higher than \\"real\\" money and for those who don't have money, you're as stuck in OASIS as you would be in the real world.    Before Ready Player One begins, James Halliday, the inventor of OASIS, has died and left his entire fortune (and OASIS) to whoever can solve three puzzles inside the virtual world.  Since Halliday was an 80s-obsessed geek, all of the puzzles and riddles are tied into the 80s.  Because his fortune is vast and involves control of the ever popular OASIS, everyone and their monkeys start trying to search for it.  The bad guys in this book are IOI, an Activision-esqe company who wants to control OASIS so they can monetize everything and rule the world, so to speak.  What follows is your typical hero quest, filled to the brim with more 80s pop culture nuggets than you'll probably even catch.  The biggest problem with Ready Player One is that Ernest Cline is more a screenwriter than a novelist.  He falls into the pattern of \\"telling\\" rather than \\"showing\\" the action.  So, for instance, when Wade has to traverse a D&D module recreated in OASIS, it reads more like a montage and is over before it even starts.  Instead of building suspense and sharing one or two key pieces of the module, Wade just tells us what he did and then he's at the end of it.  This happens a lot, in particular with action sequences.  He name checks action movies and director (i.e. John Woo) in describing what he did...but it's over in less than a paragraph.  There's no real thrill or excitement in the action.  It reads more like a blueprint for a movie script (which it's been picked up for by the way) than it does a full-fledged novel at times.    That said, I had a hard time putting it down.  It's a very entertaining novel that invokes memories and nostalgia for those who remember the 80s.  It reads quickly and will make a fantastic movies when and if it eventually gets made.  As a first novel, it's decent.  But I really wish Cline would focus more on showing us instead of giving us a quick summary of what happened.
B0002TJGQS|2.0|I've used these batteries now for a number of different digital devices and every one of these batteries only lasted a couple of months--when new ones I bought at a local store lasted more than a year on average.  I can't prove it, but I suspect these batteries were so \\"reasonably priced\\" because they were known to be old stock. Don't waste your time buying from this seller.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|A mi parecer es una de las colecciones más completas que se han hecho hasta ahora de la Saga de Star Wars; en cuanto a la calidad de las películas es descriptiblemente inigualable sin decir que por primera vez en la historia que incluyen el audio en formato DTS.  En relación a los discos de Bonus está de mas en decir que es muy completa aunque deja con sensación de mas, pero en general no me puedo quejar; si me hubiera gustado que incluyeran las versiones originales de la trilogía clásica, pero a la final para que, seria gastar en recursos además ya estas películas están disponibles en el mercado.  Los únicos puntos malos que le veo en esta colección son:  1- Los discos son muy recios, me hubieran gusta mas que se imprimieran con graficas mas llamativas.  2- Los menús de los discos son muy simples.
0307702103|5.0|I've never really been a huge fan of Grisham's work in text, but to be fair, I've only read a few books.  I've always enjoyed his cinematic adaptations, but attributed his collective to subject matter that didn't really reach out and grab me.  Maybe its an unfair assessment, but I didn't get \\"hooked\\".<br /><br />I would, however, after listening to Ford County on CD (unabridged), pretty much devour any and all short stories he writes from here on out.  Not only that, but the way the stories in Ford County mesh together, and run the gamut of emotion, I'd place these stories, collectively, as some of the best I've heard.  Its like if Mark Twain and Quentin Tarentino got together.<br /><br />I wouldn't want to dive in to any specific details and spoil anything for anyone, but the characters in these works are as real as it gets, even when they seem to almost spill over into unbelieveability.  Some are goofily corruptible, others sinister and vengeful, still others cold and sociopathic.  What they all share is a certain sympathy to their plight, however messed up that plight may be.  I'd like to spend more time with these people than I had (most, anyway), which to me is the sign of fantastic writing, and they fact its accomplished in a smaller venue has made me reevaluate my original thoughts about Grisham's modus operandi.<br /><br />Each of the stories stands alone well in its own right, but symbiotically meld to make paint Ford County as the complex place, full of duality, that it is.  You walk away feeling like a resident, and I hope Grisham feels compelled to write more like this; there's a whole lot of the South left I'd like to explore.
0553801473|1.0|I really enjoyed Martin's previous books and was very much looking forward to this one also. After reading it, it is clear to me that he has stretched this series to the breaking point. A series that started as 3 books then went to 5....now 7 has been watered down by greed (IMHO) to get more books and more sales. I will not give away any details but the characters I once loved are now beyond care or I'm tired of them. The storyline is branched and confused that I no longer care. I do enjoy details but this is just adding pages to fill up a book. The `big' event near the end of the book was the breaker for me.<br /><br />I really enjoyed this series and I'm disappointed with where it went. I will not be buying the next books and probably won't be wasting time reading them either. Sad, really.

031606792X|1.0|I liked Twilight.  New Moon and Eclipse were okay, I could at least mostly read them (I agree with many reviewers - Bella made me want to vomit, but Jacob was okay).  I agree with the reviewers who say:  this book was bad from a writing perspective  the author paid no mind to her own rules  they also wanted to slap their foreheads and throw the book across the room  I will now add another reason to hate this book: The scientific perspective.  I have one comment about it, and it's a *spoiler*.  YOU CANNOT GET BLOOD FROM YOUR STOMACH TO YOUR CHILD'S BLOODSTREAM!  Holy cr*p!!  Bella DRINKS blood to get it to the baby?  FYI, some basic anatomy here that I actually confirmed on an internet search - baby is fed through placenta, placenta is connected to the bloodstream, and bloodstream is connected to the heart.  Stomach is not connected to bloodstream other than to BREAK DOWN food into its basic nourishment elements (calcium, etc) which then get released into the bloodstream.  They found out in the 17th century that blood is passed from VEIN TO VEIN, not stomach to vein.  Seriously, if blood could be transfused into another's blood stream via the stomach....I'm not sure if it'd be more or less popular with those folks who need it in real life...  OMG, so much about this book bothered me, but this was the last bastion of anger I held for this book.  I feel like I can now move on with my life...
B004I654WQ|5.0|We don't watch this every day, of course, but my five year-old son would be happy if we did.  We moved into a new, furnished house recently and put our old dvd player in storage. Unfortunately, our copy of \\"Cars\\" was in it at the time and rendered inaccessible for the moment.  I purchased this copy because we just couldn't do without it. My son asks for it every day.  Naturally I've seen it a thousand times at this point, but even though it's not my favorite Pixar film, it is still pretty great and it holds up to multiple viewings. The story is good (as is always the case with Pixar), there are lots of little extra touches (look for the VW \\"bugs\\" on the flourescent lights), and even my two year old gets excited about the race scenes.<br /><br />I like that the BluRay combo has a regular DVD as well, because when we get our BluRay player out of storage, we can use that, but for now the regular DVD works too, and it means we really have three copies:  the one stuck in our old player, and these two. Considering how often we watch the film, we may need them!
193413712X|4.0|Tinkers is a short novel by Paul Harding.  The novel's story itself is a good one, Harding had a lot of trouble finding a publisher and ended up with Bellevue Literary Press, a small joint that puts out fewer than ten books a year and has a focus on books that include medical issues.  Tinkers marks the first time in thirty years that a small press book went on to win the Pulitzer Prize.  I like that story.  On a superficial level, the book is about the final days of George Washington Crosby's life when his mind wanders randomly as he lies, surrounded by family, in a hospital-style bed set in his living room.  The book wanders from George's own memories to the life of his father and even his grandfather.  There are many scenes from before his birth, or that he simply wasn't present for, but this fits with an overall sense of interconnectedness.  The book is VERY literary and many points reminded me of Whitman's Song of Myself, including some very clear references to the work.  It is a meditation on life and time.  There are plot-like stories but more of the book is turned over to philosophical musings (and, well, some sections on clock repair).  There is also a lot in the book about illness and the bod including George's dying body, his father's epilepsy, and his grandfather's dementia (likely Alzheimer's).  I am torn between four and four-and-a-half stars (I guess the lack of half-stars on my rating sites is helpful here!).  I fell into the language quickly and my first reaction was an appreciation of the language's beauty.  I wanted to love it all the way through, but grew a bit tired as I made my way to the end.  It is a book that requires patience and attention, not something you can read with a lot of background noise.  Sentences can run VERY long and complex and many take a second look.  It IS worth it...it IS beautiful.  I am just not sure I gave it the attention it needed and I think I got impatient.    Conclusion...recommended for lovers of the written word who are willing to take the time to enjoy the beauty of language and truly give themselves over to the book.
B004HW7JMO|5.0|This is not my favorite genre. I'm not into this period of history, or gladiator stuff in general. And I never saw the first season of Starz's Spartacus: Blood and Sand. I understand that leading man Andy Whitfield tragically passed away from cancer. While he was battling the illness, Starz made Gods of the Arena as a prequel to the series. It consists of six episodes.   All that said, I thought Spartacus: Gods of the Arena was a thrilling, extremely well-produced epic mini-series. The story concerns the city of Capua before Spartacus arrives. There is a gladitorial arena being built (which is used in the first season, Blood and Sand) but for now we see the bouts held in a very makeshift venue. There is plenty of exciting action, including both violent fights as well as action of a romantic nature. John Hannah is commanding as Batiatus. Lucy Lawless as his wife Lucretia is sexy and delivers a great performance.   With first rate production values (much like Starz series Camelot) and engrossing, deep storytelling (much more so than Camelot), Gods of the Arena is riveting. I will now seek out and watch Blood and Sand. I think it's worth pointing out that Gods of the Arena can be enjoyed without having seen the first season - it stands well on its own.
B0006GANN2|5.0|The French Connection is the ultimate movie crime drama, and is now a yard stick by which all others are judged.  Director, William Friedkin strived for realism in this film by shooting it like a documentary. You can almost smell the seedy streets,  and get an idea what the John Lindsay-era of New York was really like. There is absolutely nothing stagy about this film. Unlike the unrealistic dramatic exploits in films like Lethal Weapon, everything in the French Connection is believable. It helps that this film is based on real drug bust from the early sixties.  Gene Hackman, who plays Popeye Doyle, is a tough, unrefined, but effective cop in pursuit of an international drug dealer played by Fernando Ray (called frog 1). In the entire film the French drug kingpin is elusive. The two leads play a cat and mouse game through various location in New York, including the subway.  No effective cop film with be without a decent car chase scene, and the French Connection has the best ever filmed. Arguments can be made that Peter Yate's Bullets is the best, but it lacks the believability of Friedkin's car chase.  For example, the French Connection car case is filmed under a train bridge populated with cars and pedestrians.  In the Bullet car chase scene, the streets seem to a little absent of traffic and it looks more staged.  In the French Connection car chase, Popeye Doyle is constantly dodging cars and people as he pursues the train above. The director here masterfully edits between the car and the hijacked train.  The use of sound is also effectively used here, and the car engine roar adds to the dramatic tension.  The last scene of the film is shot in an abandoned warehouse where Popeye finally corners his nemesis(frog 1). We hear an eerie sound track as the desperate cop walks through the dank corridors. Unfortunately, Popeye ends up shooting another cop, and the bad guy disappears into darkness.   There is no poetic justice in this film.
B005OYKIJ0|3.0|One of the better of the F&F series, but it's like watching Ocean's Eleven (2001) on steroids. Plenty of action, but more shoot 'em up than the rest of the series. I guess you got to have lots of shooting with \\"The Rock\\" in a movie. Probably in his contract. Anyhow it's fast and bloody, so it will be a big hit. Look forward to the next one, since the ending shows a tease about who comes back from the dead next time.<br /><br />Nothing else to say that already hasn't been said. Good movie, but not fantastic.
B004P8JPS6|5.0|i've read every reacher book, and lee child seems to have to recovered his focus.  fascinating presentation of a lifelong service man's mentality, and how reacher's subsequent nomadic life post-army makes a perfect kind of sense.
1401310400|5.0|I love how fast I received the book. It is in great condition. Have not read it yet but the buying service was great.
1439192812|1.0|This is not the Dawkins of The Selfish Gene or The God Delussion, the author does not  know the subject, is boring, only words to make a book. He discredited himself.
B004LROMSO|4.0|I'm not really into this genre, but I decided to give Starz original series a chance. It turned out to be far more entertaining than I expected. This is the King Arthur story that has been told before, but the level of 'adult' content has been increased since this is pay cable. The production values are very good, the acting ranges from acceptable to very good, and the writing keeps things moving throughout the ten episodes.   I actually really liked Joseph Fiennes as Merlin, Arthur's ally who sees a very dark ominous future for Camelot in the wake of King Uther's death. Jamie Campbell Bower is effective as young King Arthur. Eva Green makes a considerably hissable villian as Morgan, Arthur's half-sister and competitor for power over Camelot.  I must admit, I don't watch Game of Thrones or any other medieval-fantasy type of shows. So my point of reference is extremely limited. I enjoyed this as a time-passer, rather than a massively emotionally involving show.
B005ILWOZA|5.0|This is a really great disc and I'm stingy with my five star ratings.  When I bought this, I thought it was a three star, a few days later - a four star. These songs start out slow and build the way all good soul songs do.  They need to sort of ferment and grow on you after several listens. I'm a huge fan - His debut disc is still one of my favorites and I think this one may top it but I agree that his best work is still to come - this set is a little more restrained than I think he's capable of.    For those unfamiliar, James has a tremendously soulful, raspy tenor that sounds a little like Ray LaMontagne trying to sing like Marvin Gaye and Stevie Wonder rather than Otis Redding and Van Morrison.  His singing is ovbiously influenced by motown and the arrangements owe a lot to the mid '70's, but his songwriting and melodies are inventive and all his own.  It's what makes this album full of variety, yet very cohesive.  He is one of those artists that joyfully takes from the past and updates it - sounding both retro and relevant in the way that Terence Trent D'Arby did.  The album opener \\"In My Dreams\\" is my least favorite. My favorites include \\"6 Weeks\\" and \\"I Won't Let You Go\\", and the mellow reggae of \\"All Around the World\\".  \\"One Life\\" sounds a little Mraz-y where the verse is as interesting and catchy as the chorus. \\"Person I Should Have Been\\" is the most Stevie influenced.  \\"Slave to the Music\\" has the funky sound of Marc Broussard's debut.  \\"Up\\" is a smooth duet with Jessie J, who I'm unfamiliar with but whose voice is a great compliment.   This is one of those discs where I can't pick a favorite to keep playing over and over - that's rare for me. Give this disc a chance to grow on you - James Morrison is one of the best of his generation.
B0031RAOVY|4.0|Although the action is a bit slow throughout, the fact that the movie is based on a true story makes it all the better.  My husband and I enjoyed the movie and yes, we got lumps in our throats and shed a few tears especially at the very end.  I could see it again...it is a good all over feeling movie that will surely stir up some memories and make you want to give that pet of yours a big hug and an extra special treat!  The dog that played Hachi in the movie is adorable and his performance IMO deserves 5-stars.
0756405890|5.0|Very well though out and devised story. The author has done a good job of ensuring his story is accurate, makes sense, and is going somewhere. If you are a fan of fantasy books, you will really enjoy this book. Even if you're not a huge fantasy fan, you would enjoy this book. This series has got me hooked enough to where I will buy the books when the author releases them and I will read them to see where the story is going.
B005QYKE2Y|4.0|Definitely is a trilogy. BUT guys its superb in its delivery graphically and Shia is just simply a good actor. More diverse roles he needs, yet if   the movie was to be watched without biasses or even the knowledge-base of the past two movies the movie would rate 4 stars.   Needs more distinguished and 'heavier' plot... so not 5 stars  ie as an individual film).  I'm being honest on the specific film here. In reference to its repetition of sequences and   the plot generality, the 'trilogy' per say is well ... a more critical discussion.   Sticking with the one movie in crit! d
B004RSCWZ2|3.0|Long-awaited, yes, and some very accomplished musicians, but this cd is disappointing--I expected it to be much better.  Main problem is lack of really great material.  Most of the cuts on this cd were fwritting by Susan and Derek and other members of the band, but only one or two of the songs are distinctive or really engaging.  The lyrics seem mundane and ordinary--heard it all before--many, many times, and the melodies are over-simplified and just plain bland.  Susan's voice is vibrant and strong and the horn sections is fantastic, but the material skirts the boundaries between pop and familiar blues tunes.
B003O86FMW|3.0|Hunger Games was excellent. This one is so-so, and the last of the trilogy was far weaker still.<br /><br />Read Hunger Games ... excellent. The second two of the trilogy are a tossup.<br /><br />BTW, an interesting thing to note is how Hunger Games is sanitized, apparently to avoid losing the giant school library and juvenile market. Although the characters are teenagers, many of them tough as nails and wise beyond their years, sex never rears its head. The characters are sexually neutered, for heaven's sake.
B002N1AEN2|5.0|This is a great album!  I have loved it since my husband got it when it first came out and now I'm giving it for gifts.
1451629184|5.0|I am so glad I purchased the book so that I can share it with others to read!  It came very promptly in the condition it was promised!
0756404738|5.0|Higly recommend this series for any fan of fantasy writing. It is well written, the characters are well developed, and the plot is intriguing. This book is NOT a waste of time, I really enjoyed it.
B00004XOWM|1.0|This album plain out sucks,Significant other was bad enough,but now this we have this garbage?I liked Three Dollar Bill$ Yall,since it had a lot of energy.Chocolate Starfish and The Hot dog Flavored Water is a stupid album name.The only 2 decent songs on the album are Boiler (starts to die after a few minutes though) and My Way.If you really want a NU-Metal album,go grab a System of a Down Toxicity or just get a Korn album (First Album).
B005HG4C4C|5.0|Even if your not a J. Labrie fan(as i'm not) he does do a great job on the LP(he sounds 100percent)  Also, Mangini sounds incredible if they could find one drummer to replace Mike Portnoy this is the guy.  Overall, the mix is excellent I am not crazy for the last 3 songs are kinda filler but the first 6 are excellent.  Outcry is way too slow and airy.  Correction, outcry has grown on me ;) after many listens this track has a lot going on in it takes a few careful listens to fully appreciate.  But the last 3 songs they could have cut(far from heaven-awful)
B003XF1XOQ|2.0|Hunger Games was fabulous in every way.  The second book was much weaker.  The third was weaker still, even weaker than the second book.  My advice? Read Hunger Games. Don't bother with the second two.
B0031Y4ALC|5.0|If you are considering in what format to purchase this album, I must say in order to fully understand its sound complexity and to be able to completely hear all layers and to appreciate the sustain and highs of the distortion, I think you will find no question the full experience is the vinyl. The clarity you receive from the 180 gram at 33 rpm will open your gaze quite a bit more, and even build further the relationship you have with this emotionally intense orchestration.
1451626657|1.0|I didn't even finish this book. Completely lost me. I think I just didn't get it. Hopefully that is not a sign of my intelligence. Maybe it just hasn't aged well.
0765326353|4.0|Well written book, good depth to background story. You have to be a fan of fantasy writing to get into this book. I don't think this series is for the masses. If you don't like fantasy, don't read this book, you won't like it. If you like fantasy writing, this is a good read.
B005I64U5C|4.0|I bought the blu ray/ dvd/ ultra violet digital copy only to figure out I cant put the movie on my Ipad to watch when Im away from home. This is stupid and a BIG mistake. I can only hope other companies keep the BETTER digital copy that I can put on my Ipad to watch. HOWEVER as for the movie I would still say go out and buy it, it looks great on Blu Ray.
B004FOA84A|3.0|The ending was also disappointing but I enjoyed the ride. I played through in the same afternoon I bought the game. Most of the game time was spent running up and down stairs though. It was enjoyable for the half off price.
B004EPZ084|5.0|Silly, rude & hilarious!  If you don't take it seriously, this is a pretty funny movie with the right chemistry that makes it a hit.  I really enjoyed it and laughed after it went off.  Jason Bateman, Jason Sudeikis and Charlie Day made their friendship believeable and Kevin Spacey, Colin Ferrell and Jennifer Aniston pulled off their roles as the psycho, the tool & the maneater.  Special Kudos go to Jennifer Aniston...I could NEVER imagine her in such a role and the fact that she pulled it off made me a believer in her talent.  She should step outside of her box more often.
B001PPGAJE|4.0|The movie itself is great- I tend to enjoy X2 more, but X-men really set the stage for good/entertaining comic book movies.  The blu-ray picture quality of course is great, everything looks great. The second disc (special features) has a pretty cool interactive documentary about the making of the movie, which is definitely worth a look.
0439023521|5.0|Absolutely loved this book!!! Suzanne Collins is a master story-teller. The character development is amazing, even for secondary characters such as Rue. At the end you feel like you know them all. I will be reading Catching Fire and Mockingjay immediately!
0553801473|5.0|I really enjoy this series. I rate this series as one of the best fantasy series ever, up there with Tolkien (on my list anyways...). There is great depth to the story, you can tell the author has spent a lot of time creating a realistic background setting for the current story. This is more hardcore fantasy, it's not nice/pretty/sunshine/etc. or anything, very realistic and the author throws no punches. I would recommend this to any fantasy fan, and any adult looking for a series with depth. You don't have to be a fan of fantasy to enjoy this series, but you should like more realistic/hardcore books if you are going to get into this series.
B0024FAR5M|3.0|A next saga of a criminal family,\\"a bike sports club\\" is a story of a biker gang spreading its influence round the USA and its members' inter-affairs.<br /><br />So far, it would better refrain from commenting the feelings associated with as Occupy Wall Street protest is still around. \\"Compulsive Sexual Syndrome\\" is an only new stuff I learnt from here.

B001KVZ6FW|2.0|The movie itself was excellent, but the quality was terrible.  The words and mouths did not match up, which made it difficult  to follow.  I have never had a DVD that was like this.
B001PPGAJY|4.0|This movie has already been reviewed a ton, so suffice to say if you enjoy X-men or Hugh Jackman, get the movie.  In terms of the blu-ray, the quality is crisp and clear as expected. The extra features include standard commentary tracks, deleted scenes, etc. There are also \\"History of the X-men\\" featurettes- the first one is Stan Lee, Chris Claremont and other talking about the actual creation of the first issues of the comic, which is pretty interesting if you enjoy learning more about the comics (like myself). Of all the special features I've gone through so far, that's been my favorite so far.
1416955070|3.0|I liked this, didn't love it. After reading other reviews, I realize I am not the only one who noticed the Harry Potter similarities. Considering Cassandra Clare was a HP fan-fiction writer, this is not surprising. But, I did enjoy the story and I will probably read the next one. Definitely not life changing...
0345529057|3.0|I'd read a few reviews on this set having issues with binding and packaging. When I got my copy, the first thing I noticed was that the books were too large for the sleeve. When I took the books out to inspect them, everything seemed fine. But when I put them back into the sleeve, they didn't really fit. So I pulled them out, put the first book on the left, the fourth book on the right and put the two middle books between them. The fit was so snug it ripped the top left edge of the sleeve. I pulled out all four books again and put them back in there with care (not that I did it violently the first time) and babied the left edge. This time, the top right edge ripped.  If this isn't a problem for you, go ahead and buy. Though I have heard other complains about this set. Which I have not gotten far enough to determine if my set was affected. I may just throw the sleeve away and stick the books in my book shelf.
B005LY4B0A|5.0|fun way to kill some time. based on the first few levels, i thought it was gonna be too easy and for elementary students, but it ended up being very challenging.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|I love the way it starts off real softly and builds up louder, easier to wake up to calmer too instead off my heart pounding all crazy being woken up by a loud abrupt sound. the crescendo option kicks butt.. the GPS feature is cool si it doesn't ring all crazy when im in thee car or at work .<br />ps this is my 1st review ever :)
0099527561|5.0|This is the best one yet. I have read them all and it has twists throughout the book, keeps your interest and purchasing through Amazon was the answer.
0618918248|5.0|A great read for any skeptic, agnostic, atheist, or if you're on the fence! To be honest, all should read this book! Dawkins tells it like it is and backs his logic and reason up with facts! (Which is something I cannot say about a lot of competing hypotheses)
B005EZJ3MW|5.0|This was a great purchase.  I love the cd, demi lovato does it again with great lyrics and beats.  Her voice is amazing and so powerful, which gives the songs so much meaning.
0439023491|2.0|I put this down to read James Lee Burke's new one. When I came back to it, the differences were more than glaringly apparent. From the sublime to the ridiculous. A poor plot. Weak characters. No logic. I won't bother with the third.
B005P06AAO|5.0|Loved the self comentary by the main character and love her friends comments and quick wit. The self consious but strong Jenna meets the guy of her dreams (Matty) and it turns out he is into her.  But, Matty doesn't want to go public until his best friend (Jake) becomes interested in her.  Matty makes good and poor decisions about his relationship with Jenna.  When he realizes he is going to lose her, that's when he goes into action. But is he too late?    Jenna's quirky friends have great dialogue in high school's everyday ups and downs.  I love how they deal with complicated situations without being too serious.  Lots of social learning along the way.
B003Y5H542|5.0|When I first saw this film in the theater, I remember thinking that these are quite possibly the ugliest characters I've seen yet in a family-animated tale. I was not impressed, but my kids & wife loved it.  Upon my second viewing I looked deeper and came to realize that I agree with most of the other reviews here:  this is truly a brilliant film.    PROs:  STORY.  This movie is an original story without a Pixar/Disney formula driving it.  It has a lot of smart & slaptick humor in it with comic commentary.  EASTER EGGs.  An Easter egg is something hidden in a game/movie/media that is a link to another game/movie/media.  VOICE ACTING.  Johnny Depp is outstanding as RANGO.  Also great support by Ned Beatty as the Mayor Tortoise & Bill Nighy as Rattlesnake Jake.  DIRECTION.  Solid direction from Gore Verbinski. He's inproved upon his previous work in the Pirates of the Caribbean films.  CONs:  ANIMATION.  The charaters in this film are ugly CGI.  [But that's part of the charm for me]  BEANS.  The female heroine is named Beans.  I still don't get it.     I give this film my highest recommendation for families and animation fans alike.  [semi-spoilers] In the beginning when Rango is on the convertible car windshield, it is Johnny Depp driving the car from \\"Fear & Loathing In Las Vegas\\".  I noted several other eggs from Sergio Leone Westerns to Pirates 3.  I'll be looking for more the next time we watch it.
B005M92MJ6|5.0|Dare I say that this may be some of the best music Maynard has ever created, with ANY project (and yes, this includes the mighty TOOL)? As a fan of past Puscifer music, I was only expecting something that could hold me over until the next Tool release, but after listening to this album a few times through now, I realized my expectations were far too low. \\"Conditions of My Parole\\" sounds like a much more sophisticated, polished Puscifer than I was used to. There is a wide variety of moods, instruments, sounds, and genres touched upon, but yet it remains cohesive and perfectly crafted. It's difficult to pick out what song is my favorite. At first, I thought \\"Horizons\\" stood out to me, but now I think \\"Toma\\" and \\"Tumbleweed\\" are right up there with it. Even \\"Monsoons\\", which I initially thought sounded too Enya-esque (or something like that), has grown on me fairly quickly. \\"Conditions\\" is an absolute must-have.
B0000507R2|4.0|You can buy this in .flac digital format 24 bit 98k from HDtracks for $18. You just don't get the silly 5.1 surround sound.
B000AJIF4E|5.0|Worth every penny.  I own a pair of Sennheiser HD595's and bought these to use when I play my Roland electronic drum set because I read that they do a good job of blocking outside noise (which the Sennheisers are not designed to do).  After seeing them in the box, I figured the thin profile of the actual ear cover wouldn't do a very good job...but they do.  It blocks most of the outside noise...where I really don't hear my pads at all when drumming.<br /><br />Better than that, these sound AWESOME!  Using just my iPod, it is like there is new life to the music.  I can't stop listening, they sound so good.  I'll never go back to regular old headphones...studio monitors are the way to go.  There is a good reason why these get so many good reviews...they're truly worth every penny.  Best headphones I've ever owned.
B004T5R2HQ|5.0|really blown away by this app. it took a picture and corrected perspective and quality to an amazing level. well put together.
0156027321|4.0|The Life of Pi is about an Indian boy named Piscine \\"Pi\\" who is a zookeeper's son and are on their way to move to Canada by boat when the boast sinks. The tale is told by Pi and it is his story. The first part Pi talks about his love of animals and living at the zoo, and he also talks about his love of religion and how he becomes a Muslum, Hindu and a Catholic because he believes in them all. This part of the story was a bit dull, but nevertheless it builds the character of Pi.  The second part is the sinking of the ship on its way to Canada and how Pi suddenly finds himself of a lifeboat with an Orangutan, a Hyena, a zebra, and a Bengal tiger that Pi names Richard Parker. This is the meat of the story and it tells of how Pi survived with these dangerous animals on a lifeboat by fishing and trapping water to stay alive. This was an interesting tale, and I enjoyed this part.  And the final part I won't give away but it adds a twist and allows you to view the tale as you wish. This part made the story for me, because up to that point I was only entertained by the story but not overwhelmed, but the ending gave it something a little extra special.  The book was very well written by the author, and comes recommended. Although, I will say I find it to be a little too overrated by critics, even though I enjoyed the story a lot. Take of it what you will.
B000NY17J6|5.0|this cd is a must for anyone who grew up in the sixties and seventies. Listening to it brings back so many memories
B004HW7JMY|5.0|this spartacus series is probably the best series i have seen. i am amazed at how real it is, how good the actors and actresses are. the setting, everything. in fact i could not think of one bad thing about it.
0553386794|4.0|Martin is so abusive to his main characters that we just gotta love him. There has been so many times that I've said to myself, \\"No way, someone's going to save (spoiler blocked!) any minute now. there's no way the author will let him......Oh god, the author DID\\". Expect a lot of switching roles. Characters you think are allies are enemies and ones you think are enemies are actually the worst kind of enemies. Your eyes will be glued to the page, watching all the action unfold. \\"Game of Thrones\\" is a bit morbid and might make you feel miserable when you finish it but the book has a certain charm that will insure you'll be coming back for more soon enough.<br /><br />Good: fast-paced, change of POV keeps things fresh, witty dialogue, realistic and believable characters who grow throughout the course of the book<br />Bad: some characters are annoying (Sanya *coughcough*), large cast of characters to the point where you might need to keep a character list to keep track of them all
B004GHYCKW|5.0|I very much enjoyed this album. Every track is distinctive and well constructed, with a wide variety of grooves. All instrumentation and vocals are top notch, the lyrics also. An invaluable album, like most of PJ Harvey's others.
B005DR64OQ|1.0|Wow what a horrible cliched film. How many breaking and entering movies have you seen just in the last five years or more? Firewall(which was great), Hostage, The Strangers, Panic Room (great), Funny Games, and the list goes on. This movies is basically a parody of itself. The F word flies around like a swarm of locusts, killing any chance of any kid of meaningful, creative dialogue. And a premise? Wow, breaking into someones house who really has no money, seriously? I don't think Joel Shulmaker has really made any \\"stellar\\" films, but he is (was) a decent director. Why big stars like Cage and Kidman are in such a hideous picture, basically straight to DVD, is beyond me. I just hope a lot of these stars aren't getting the Cuba Gooding Jr syndrome. It seems a lot of older actors are being pushed into crappy straight to DVD films these days. And some good ones as well, but few. All this movie does is really irritate the viewer, other than the foul language there is not a quiet moment, or emotional one in the whole film. Everyone rants around like they forgot to take there meds, just screaming and yelling at each other till you get a headache and say ok enough. Don't just kill the hostages, just kill everyone in the movie! This is definitely Cages worst performance, although he has had a few bad ones in the past. He actually uses words like $$#thole and A##F%$k, real great dialogue there. Also he whines like a little girl through most of the film, trying to fend off the bad dudes, but the girls overpower him and end up kicking more tail than he does. He mainly lays on the ground bleeding and/or crying or both.  So sorry it contains spoilers, not that anyone is \\"dying\\" to see this film, but it's really as bad as the critics and audience says it is. Which usually might or not be true. In this case it's painfully true, don't let this movie \\"trespass\\" into your movie collection. The other blu rays will skoot off the shelve just to avoid it. I think you should too. Later. :)  P.S I didn't notice Kidman had her lips redone until i saw a picture on wikipedia, then in this movie. COME ON NICOLE, your 44, and are(were?) hot.
B004I9CXHW|1.0|I Ordered two of these for my 2011 VW Jetta. Both of them stopped working. The first one stopped working after only a day. I returned that and ordered another one which stopped working after about a week.
B004XNGKBS|2.0|I tried this out and then ended up uninstalling after a couple days. I already had apps to take notes. It is cool how you can actually write a note like pen and paper, but I found it to be difficult and more time consuming than just typing, especially without owning a stylus. I tried the writing with my figure and it just was kind of a pain. I'm sure this app would work out a lot better if you have some sort of stylus
1568497369|3.0|I read this book because my friend recommended it to me and I'll be honest, I was bored at first. The book started by introducing ten different characters and a bit of their background. The fact that it was all rapid-fire led to me constantly flipping back to the beginning thinking, \\"who's this guy again?\\". But once all the characters were established in my mind and the first murder occurs, things started picking up speed. While you might guess what happens next, you won't guess HOW it happens. You'll have to read till the end before the last piece of the puzzle falls into place and you find out who's the murderer. This book is short and sweet (well, maybe not sweet but you get the point) but don't let the length fool you.<br /><br />Agatha Christie is an amazing writer and will lead you by the nose with her stunning style. It's just too bad that it takes half the book before she does it.<br /><br />Good: fantastic portrayal of the murderer, detailed writing, large cast of characters<br />Bad: Beginning is boring, some murders are a bit unbelievable, spends a lot of time explaining things that end up not all that important
0439023521|4.0|This was a great book! You will get caught up in the characters right away! Definately worth reading! Can't wait for the movie now!
B00015YVD6|5.0|I hadn't seen this movie since I was teenager.  It's so funny and romantic!  I love the story between the mermaid and the food businessman.  Tom Hanks is a very good actor.
B005FUTBV4|5.0|I have never been a big Kevin Smith fan, but that has now changed (despite his wardrobe). RED STATE is truly incredible. Even if you have no interest whatsoever in the content or plot (which is well done), the performances alone are worth watching over and over again. Michael Parks and Melissa Leo give truly amazing performances, but it doesn't stop there. Stephen Root and John Goodman are also incredible, and the younger actors are certainly worth watching (especially Kerry Bishe and Kyle Gallner).  Some have complained that it shifts around too much, but I think Kevin Smith got it just right (there is a method to his madness). It shocks, but at exactly the right times, and I found the \\"sudden shifts\\" that some found disconcerting add to the story line and entertainment value. The camera work is off the charts and the shoot-em-up scenes struck me as a mix of the very best of the surreal quality of Tarantino and the hard-nosed reality of Spielberg (as in Private Ryan).  In some spots the film approaches the lines of believability, as Kevin Smith is known for, but does not cross it..remaining right there on that edge, often pulling back momentarily. It's definitely not a movie you want to pause often, and might not be a movie you want to watch when you need a good night's sleep. But don't miss it. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.
B005J0VPNC|4.0|I downloaded this on the day they had it for free. I've seen it in the app stores for a little while and I always thought it looked kind of interesting, so the day I saw amazon have it as the free app of the day I jumped on that. I don't use it much, but like it said, it's a fun little app to have. I don't take too many pictures on my phone to begin with, but I'm sure people who take a lot of pictures and like putting effects on them would really enjoy this app.
B005MRUCAY|5.0|Just watched the free trailer on Amazon Streaming, and OK, I'm interested in seeing more.  This will be high on my list as soon as my Kindle Fire gets here 11/17 - or possibly earlier, Amazon????  Joseph was great as Merlin.
B000001FDQ|5.0|Although he's a walking cliche these days, Swedish guitar virtuoso/egomaniac Yngwie (don't forget the J.!) Malmsteen legitimately caused a stir in the heavy metal guitar community in the 80's. In fact it could be argued that Malmsteen made just as big a fuss in that decade as Eddie Van Halen had in the late 70's.<br /><br />What set this guy apart from everyone else was that he was a heavy metal guitarist whose primary influences were centuries-dead classical composers and violinist Nicolo Paganini. And indeed, Yngwie's immersion in the classics lent his playing an undeniable technical and compositional sophistication which was heretofore unheard-of in metal.<br /><br />Malmsteen's first album is his best; mostly instrumental, it is packed to the rim with ambitious (but not overblown) compositions, dramatic classical melodies and scads of blinding solos, delivered in the most accomplished rock guitar technique heard up til that point. The next two albums, Marching Out and Trilogy, lean much more heavily toward vocal songs and shorter arrangements; there are even some stabs at pop metal (Trilogy's \\"You Don't Remember, I'll Never Forget\\" and \\"Fire\\"). Throughout both of these albums Yngwie does a fine job of balancing his indulgent, progressive inclinations with an impressive talent for writing concise, melodic metal songs. The guitar playing is brilliant and there are some genuinely good tunes there.<br /><br />But if you want to hear Yngwie's mission statement in a tight, inspired package, this is it.
B0034G4P8A|5.0|This movie is so awesome has lots of action in it and has lots of colors and is good for the whole family to watch,all my grandkids watch it every time they come over it was worth every dime!
B002VPE1WK|5.0|I am getting this bag after buying several new lenses, including [[ASIN:B00005LEOH Nikon 80-200mm f/2.8D ED AF Zoom Nikkor Lens for Nikon Digital SLR Cameras]] and [[ASIN:B001955P8W Tamron AF 28-75mm f/2.8 SP XR Di LD Aspherical (IF) with Built-In AF Motor for Nikon Digital SLR Cameras]] (both of which from my first few weeks of owning are very nice), I had to upgrade my Nikon bag to carry these with me, and a variety of other goodies. Let me tell you, the bag is splendid. There is a ton of room, and the adjustable velcro slots are strong, and treat my lenses with care. The straps work like a charm, and even has additional straps with buckles just in case! I haven't used them yet. I spent 3 hours carrying this the other day shooting a local softball tournament, and then another few hours at a local charity event, and I didn't get tired and was even able to do some minor manual labor with it on, haha.<br /><br />There are a ton of pockets to put stuff, and the waterproof pockets on the inside are a nice touch. I keep spare batteries and manuals in there. You can easily fit a netbook or table in the front if you want, and there's some additional side pockets for things like cell phones, wallets, etc.<br /><br />Overall, it's a great bag, and definitely a great alternative to some of the other bags out there!
B002NWRMVS|5.0|First of all, i just have to say i love Norah Jones full-heartedly, but when i received the disc, the casing was mangled. considering this is a gift for my father, im very displeased with this. before buying any soft cased CDs from amazon, just be able to accept that it will probably show up with some kind of blemish...im not very happy with the choice of shipping material used by Amazon. but again, to clarify, i very very much enjoy Norah Jones's music and hope everyone out there picks up her new record. it's truly phenomenal!
B00006ZXSK|5.0|This movie is the total package. If you like stunning scenery, beautiful costumes, brilliant acting, and a beautiful soundtrack, you will love this movie. I also purchased the soundtrack CD - it's that good. Actually, it's all that good.

B00466HN86|5.0|I found this movie to be incredibly inspiring. My father is amazing, and sitting in that theater made me value him so much more. I have not appreciated him to the level that I should. This movie was phenomenal. A must see for everyone!
0307341577|5.0|I picked this book up randomly. I hate to say it, but I judged a book by its cover. The description on the back is rather lacking; it makes the book sound really tiresome. However, I read it anyways out of boredom and I'm glad that I did.  Dark Places is about Libby Day. When she was 7, on a cold January night, her two sisters and mother were brutally murdered. She escaped out a window but only after hearing who she believed was her older brother, Ben, yelling. She implicated him in the crime and he was sent to prison at fifteen.  Twenty-five years later, her trust fund from \\"supporters\\" is dwindling and she finds herself in need of money so she agrees to go to the Kill Club, a group of people obsessed with murders. They believe Ben is innocent and that she was lying on the stand. Libby claimed to have seen Ben murder their family although she really didn't. They pay her to find people from her past that may know something about the murders and get information from them. She begins to doubt her memory of that night and wants to know the truth once and for all. Did Ben really kill their family? Is he innocent like he claims to be? Did their deadbeat father commit the murders? Or was it someone else entirely, someone little Libby Day didn't even know?  The book is told from many different points of view: Libby, Ben, and their Mom. The reader gets to see what really happened and what they were thinking throughout the day of the murders and the present day. It alternates from present day to the day of the crime giving little increments at a time of the day's events before culminating at the moment the murders occurred.  This is a really good book. It had me guessing throughout. I was sure Ben was guilty, then I wasn't, and then I was. Then I thought their dad did it. Then I thought a loan shark did it. I didn't catch the subtle foreshadowing until after reading whom the murderer really was. In hindsight I'm slightly disappointed that I couldn't figure it out. It reallyshould have been obvious but that is a sign of a good book. You get so wrapped up in the story that you don't even notice the clues.  I actually wish that it had been longer. I wanted to know more about the characters.   Although the ending is a bit unbelievable, too many coincidences, it was still enjoyable. I would recommend this book to anyone looking for a good, quick read.
B0041KKYGU|1.0|this is a horrible movie. i mean truly horrible. they spliced up scenes for the movie to make a good trailer and then you watch the dvd and it is absolute crap.  I never stop movies halfway through but i watched it with my mother and she fell asleep and when she awoke i practically begged her to not make me watch anymore. it was so unbelievably bad. Not funny at all. Its one of those movies where none of the characters are likeable. Justin timberlake was so clueless i actually felt sorry for him and cameron diaz plays this burnt out mess whos trying to rumage up 10 grand for a boob job after \\"window shopping\\" in a magazine after her gold mine leaves her before the wedding.    you want a funny movie with dirty humor rent or buy \\"Bridesmaids\\" you wont be sorry.

038533348X|3.0|Lately I've been very much into postmodern novels, so I knew I would eventually come across Kurt Vonnegut's work. This is the first book I've read by him and I'm sure it won't be the last -- yet while I enjoyed CAT'S CRADLE and the laughter it brought me, I think it is far from perfect.   The writing itself is simple and direct, yet sophisticated and well crafted. It reads very comfortably and is quite cheeky at times. The prose suits the nature of its narrator (first person) very well, a man who is sparse with his words and quick with his wit (which often goes unnoticed by the other oblivious characters).  Speaking of characters: the ones in this book all have their own idiosyncratic quirkiness. They're as eccentric as they come, and some are just outright bizarre and absurd in a laugh-out-loud (but also head-scratching) way. None of them are particularly deep or interesting, but they're fun to watch.  Now, the main thing that gets me about this book is the plot. It starts out modestly enough: our narrator explains that he once set out to write a book titled \\"The Day the World Ended,\\" but then he became a Bokononist (I'll leave the pleasure of finding out what that is to you). I'm not going give a synopsis of the whole plot, but suffice it to say that the protagonist stumbles through a series of unlikely events and lands himself on an island full of crazy people. As interesting as that sounds, I never really got the sense that anything was really happening. What events do happen never seem to have any real consequence. I never felt any suspense or shock -- only curiosity, confusion and suspicious awe. And then the story just ends. It cuts off without any real resolution, and I'm left thinking, \\"Huh. That's it?\\"  I think that CAT'S CRADLE is carried mostly by its characters, its comedy and the interrelation between the two. I wouldn't call it a profound or impressive novel, but I don't think that's what it is trying to be. I think it's a quirky and fun novel that'sa riot to read, but I can't help but feel let down by its conclusion (or lack thereof). Maybe there is a larger point that I'm missing; this book certainly has the potential to exist on many levels. However, as it stands, I can only give it three stars. Maybe I will reconsider when I inevitably reread this in a few months or years (I always end up rereading books I enjoy).   Until then, CAT'S CRADLE is just okay in my opinion.
B004VF68AQ|3.0|Jane's Addiction return with their new album The Great Escape Artist which signals a shift back to the art rock style of their first two cult classic records. It seems that they have abandoned the more commercial style of the last album Strays and tried to please the hardcore fans by creating a more mood oriented sound with sweeping vocal melodies. Personally I preferred the style of Strays where they went straight for the pop hook and cool guitar riffs but I can see long time Jane's Addiction fans enjoying this move to well produced music that resembles their early style more closely. Dave Navarro's guitar playing is noticeably subdued preferring to focus his playing on building a sonic vibe rather than nailing the riffs and solos he has been known for. Highlights include the nice guitar sounds in \\"End To The Lies\\", the slowly building groove of \\"Irresistable Force\\", and the vocal melodies in \\"Splash A Little Water On It\\". The deluxe edition comes with a second disc containing a live concert from 2011 featuring a good set list focused on the early days. The Great Escape Artist will please fans of the earlier version of Jane's Addiction more than those who enjoyed Strays and represents a good addition to the Jane's Addiction catalogue despite not being as memorable as their previous offerings.
B004SIP9MY|5.0|im not a horror hound but i do like my random slasher film marathons. to me scream was the last good slasher film (that wasnt a remake of someone elses genious).  Like so many slasher films the original was better. It was both bloodier (the death of casey and steve being the bloodiest of course) and funnier (mathew lillard was classic).  the thing is the rest of them were also great.  It unlike the slasher films that followed but like the original halloween knew the power of a knife to put the audience on the edge of their seat. I sift through my horror movies from time to time getting rid of the ones that ive seen too many times and just dont have the same effect anymore but the scream movies always survives the cut. fine friday night fun.<br />Rose McGowan was in this one its gotta get points for that right?
B005M92MJ6|5.0|I was really looking forward to hearing Maynard's new album Conditions of My Parole & to be honest, I wasn't sure exactly what to expect...Being submersed in a culture where we are bred to be impatient in nature, the first time I heard it, I was expecting to instantly separate out the songs I like from the ones I didn't care for. But the album is so much more than that...from the name to the somewhat silly cover, I was really shocked by the incredible content.   Words I would use to describe it would be 'powerful, expansive, moving & unique', but those words fall short of the feelings the songs can evoke if you stop for a moment, close your eyes and just really listen to the emotions that play on the edges of every song. Almost like siren songs, the music pulls you & calls to you.  Every song is really well thought out & delicately woven, each song tells the story and if given a chance, it will move your heart and make you yearn for the Verde Valley and the amazing life that Maynard seems to have found there. Thank you, Maynard James Keenan for this. It is just beautiful.

B004SMD4H2|4.0|After viewing several episodes, I found that the concept of this series is very much like The X-Files without the alien and government conspiracy part--which is very good for me.  Its tone is also lighter than The X-Files--which is also acceptable for me.  Considering that there would not be any new episode of The X-Files again, I decide to like this series.
B005ELQVGW|4.0|At first listen, Biophilia seems unlistenable and almost tuneless. Moon isn't exactly a fire starter. As we move on to first single, Crystalline, with Vespertine-like bells, the album begins to warm up (by the way, the Matthew Herbert remix of Crystalline is absolutely sublime) and surprise, suprise, the ending to Crystalline is pure drum-and-bass delight. Cosmonogy also hits a high note on the album as it changes from slow to emotional and atmospherical midway (excellent remixes by Herbert once again). Then, there is Virus, with a iPad app so apt for the song on how one \\"infects\\" a lover like a virus, penetrating the skin and into the blood. Interesting. I like Sacrifice and Mutual Core the most, as both songs interject beats from albums like Homogenic and Vespertine. Biophilia isn't for the casual listener and require many listens to understand Bjork's weird lyrics and often structureless songs. It is rewarding if you have the patience.
B0002858YS|5.0|I recognize the first five songs from the concert at Royal Albert Hall in London, so I enjoyed those songs on the CD.  I still have to listen to the last few songs again, but I appreciate the work of \\"The Killers\\".  The group is great.
B005DHC6R0|4.0|The much publicized break up of Oasis and subsequent fueding over the last several months have done nothing to diminish the place of the band in the hearts and minds of legions of fans. The only question was: who will make music first, and whose will be better? Was Noel really the brains behind Oasis? Was Liam just the singer of his brother's words and melodies?  Liam and the rest of the boys from Oasis were the first out of the gate with their new band Beady Eye, and I think the album \\"Different Gear, Still Speeding\\" is a fantastic offering. Full of classic rock tunes and swagger. But, it is missing something, and that something is found on \\"Noel Gallagher's High Flying Birds.\\"  Noel has made it clear that he is a songwriter and does not want to be viewed as a guitar player or vocalist. That said, the songs are this album's strentgh. In fact, the guitar playing is beautifully understated which gives room for piano and strings.  The songs are what make this album special. The instantly recognizable melodies, song structures, and that inexplicable good feeling that comes from listening to a Noel penned tune. A good portion of this album is classic, and by that I mean no one else working in music today can write a song that feels timeless. All of Oasis' records, including the few that were sub-par, have these classic songs on them. Noel truly is the Paul McCartney of his generation.  Now, the bad news. This album is missing something vital, and that is the energy and aggression of Liam's vocals. Don't get me wrong, Noel is a competent singer, but several of these tracks beg for the younger brother's voice.   Secondly, the music is more subdued than I would have liked. It feels as though Noel knows he is not in a rock and roll band anymore and has put together a collection of mid-tempo tracks with not much to get your heart going. I'm not saying that it isn't energetic, it's just a different kind of energy.  Basically my conclusion is this: Noel is an amazing songwriter. Liam is an amazing singer. Gem, Andy, and Chris are amazing musicians. Together they were, in my opinion, one of the greatest bands of all time. Now that they've split it has become obvious what each of them brought to the collective.   I'm thankful to have albums from each side, but it only serves as reminder, a nagging thought at the back of my brain that wonders what they could have made together.
B005IZLPMY|5.0|Okay,so i read some reviews,and now I've gotta say something (again).First,someone who claimed to be a fan and comic-book reader made a remark about fitting Cap's transition from WW2<br />to the modern age as being accomplished by the film writers. Actually that story goes all the way back to Cap's resurrection by Marvel Comics for\\"The Avengers\\"comic back in the sixties.<br />In the story Cap is discovered by the already-formed Avengers in \\"suspended animation\\" (one of the favorites of writers back then of dealing with long gaps of time in a character's career),at the North Pole.<br />this is just another example for Marvel's genius at remaining faithful to a character,while retaining,and even improving upon the storyline to fit in today's cinematic world.It was great to discover that<br />Captain America can still make my heart pound while clobbering the Nazis, or anyone else who thinks they can \\"Tread On\\" the good ol' USA!In closing I would like to mention how GREAT it was to<br />see the \\"Howling Commandos\\" (Nick Fury's original platoon during WW2,which developed over the Marvel years into his promotion to Director of S.H.I.E.L.D.), in action during the film.And one last tidbit of nostalgia-I remember being about 12 or 13,and coming across a Marvel re-print of  Captain America's original story,first printed ca.1941, and even the MACHINERY in the movie looks like the lab & electronic equipment drawn in the original comic!<br />  So-KUDOES & LAUREL wreaths for Marvel,Captain America, and the coming of the Avengers!Personally,I can't wait.
B004A8ZWWO|5.0|Just got back from a sneak preview of this film, and it was a blast!<br /><br />The story revolves around the employees and residents of an exclusive, high-rise New York tower.  When one of the residents, a wealthy Wall Street tycoon (played brilliantly by Alan Alda), is arrested for embezzling, the employees learn that they have lost their pensions and savings, all of which were given over as \\"investments.\\"  Several of them hatch a scheme to recoup their losses, and then everything goes haywire.<br /><br />The cast is terrific.  Ben Stiller plays the understated, very likeable building manager.  Eddie Murphy is the funniest he's been in years as Slide, a small time criminal the employees turn to for help.  The rest of the cast is very strong, including Matthew Broderick, Casey Affleck, Gabourey Sidibe, and more.<br /><br />Everyone is in fine form, and director Brett Ratner finds the balance of fun and thrills he's been missing since at least Rush Hour 2.<br /><br />There are twists you don't see coming, lots of laugh out loud moments, and the story is very timely, in light of the Bernie Madoff scandal and public dissatisfaction with Wall Street in general.<br /><br />Go see this!  Seriously!
B002C6A6N6|5.0|I recently discovered Dr.Quinn Medicine Woman and that's because I worked when it came out. They are all \\"new\\" to me and I have not seen any program with so much drama, as well as being fit for family viewing. I ordered 2 sets because the first one had a damaged disk and the Amazon customer service was awesome! I was mailed out the replacement the next day with a more than fair amount of time to return the damaged set before being charged for the second set. It was one day after I mailed it back that the replacement came. I would recommend this set to anyone that wants drama thats fit to watch and the customer service at Amazon is the best I have ever experienced, I will be a regular customer. Thanks Amazon!
B0041TM3LK|3.0|This is a case of getting what you pay for: this 8 classic album Monk set from this company is a great bargain price-wise, but the sound quality is not.  Obviously the original late 1980s-early 1990s Original Jazz Classic masters were used to make this set.  By that, I mean you get the classic music in boxey, compressed sound.  If you are not an audiophile, this may not bother you.  If you are, get the remasters from Concord Records, who owns the original masters.    In my honest opinion, for the most part, the European versions of the (in Europe) public domain classic 50+ year old albums are tempting from a price standpoint, but never deliver on sound quality.
0811875040|2.0|This is a beautiful cookbook, however, there are errors throughout the book.  It did come with an errata sheet, but even that is not entirely correct.  I am glad to see that Amazon is replacing this book when a corrected version comes out.  I would gladly give the book 5 stars without the errors and, in fact, am waiting for the corrections because it will make a perfect gift for my friends who bake.
B005CM9DX6|5.0|With Heritage, Opeth completes the transformation hinted at with Damnation. If you are looking for death metal vocals and blast beats this is not for you. This album has more of a seventies vibe, hinting at Sabbath, Deep Purple and even VanderGraf Generator, if you can believe that! This is one of those recordings that doesn't grab you until the second, third or even fourth listen, but by then it is already too late... you are hooked. I got this on the day of it's release and had already listened to it TEN times by the evening commute. Buy the special edition and you get a \\"making of Heritage\\" DVD, as well as access to two \\"bonus\\" tracks, which are just as great as the rest of the album. Pure genius.
B005D51JQQ|1.0|I have been a fan since the late 70's--listened to The Police with my dad.  My first real (not kiddie music) album was Ghost in the Machine, and from there I backtracked and got my hands on everything else.  I can't (or don't want to) even try to calculate what I've spent over the years on Sting's vinyl, CDs, and concerts.  I've paid for front row seats & been onstage singing with Sting at a soundcheck.  But this boxed set brought to mind The Smiths' Paint a Vulgar Picture:  Re-issue ! Re-package ! Re-package !   Re-evaluate the songs   Double-pack with a photograph   Extra Track (and a tacky badge)   Best of ! Most of !   Satiate the need   Slip them into different sleeves !   Buy both, and feel deceived  I could REcreate most of this boxed set by REorganizing tracks I already own and burning my own cds or putting a playlist on my ipod.  I don't need remixed, remastered, reissued, repackaged redundancy. . .regardless of the price.  How about something NEW, Sting?
B004UVCOZ4|3.0|This boxed set compiles 20 albums from the 1950s from jazz immortal Miles Davis.  Starting with \\"Birth of the Cool\\" through an abbreviated \\"Porgy and Bess,\\" (but NOT \\"Kind of Blue\\") there is a lot of music to enjoy here.  However, as is often the case with these things, there are a lot of key albums that are missing, some of which are included in the later \\"Eight Classic Albums\\" 4 disc boxed set from the same company (including \\"Kind of Blue\\" and some second tier Blue Note and Prestige Davis 50s albums, when he was in the throes of heroin addiction).  The album choices contained in this set seem almost haphazard, as are those found on the \\"Eight\\" set.  Or perhaps they mash up the choices to get you to buy their additional sets?  Unknown.  I would be remiss if I didn't point out the \\"remastered\\" sound is basically the original CD releases of these albums from Capital, Prestige and Columbia.  None of the bonus tracks are included from the Columbia or Prestige remasters and as mentioned above, \\"Porgy\\" is shortened.  But these are public domain releases from Europe, so I guess we can't expect too much.  I'm replacing this material with the \\"Perfect Miles Davis\\" import collection from Columbia, which should contain the most up to date masters of that label's recordings and not the boxey, compressed sound found here for not that much more than this set.
1451629184|3.0|I just finished reading this book. I knew going in that it would be graphic. She tells in some detail what her captor did to her at only 11 years old. As a mother it was a little tough to get through. The most horrific parts are in the first few chapters about the first couple of years after she was abducted. After that the story left me with lots of questions. She makes it hard to figure out what time frame she is talking about. One minute she's talking about her girls being 4 and 1 and the next they are free and she never mentions there age. I googled after I read the book and found out the girls were 15 and 11 when they were free. It doesn't really say much about what happened when the girls were older. Did he rape them too? I wanted to know more about how they were readjusting and less about their pets. I understand that she was trying to convey how important the relationships with the animals were since she had no other interactions but I think she spent a little too much time on that. Also you have to keep in mind this girl only went to school until the 5th grade so she sounds somewhat like a child. I have a tremendous amount of respect for her being able to overcome what she has. I would recommend buying the book if only to help support her.
0792844890|5.0|A classic from the 80s that you must own.  ...and if you buy it, you might as well get it in blu-ray.
B0055V6EZE|4.0|Luv the cd.  He plays beautifully.  Yes, he has a rather thin reedy voice but it works.  Really enjoying it. And it has little to do with  the \\"house\\" factor.
0670022411|5.0|Most of my friends have read the Sookie Stackhouse novels and Twiilight went around our little group for several years. Throughout all the goading, convincing and promising, I could never really get into the vampires and wizards. With the exception of Lord of the Rings in school, and reading the Harry Potter novels to my kids, I typically am not drawn to the fantasy genre. This book may have changed my mind. My usual reading is more nonfiction or historical fiction, so it could be that I don't notice if the pace of a book is a little more leisurely. To use a drinking analogy, if the True blood series is like Tequila (harder, faster, takes less to make an impact), then this novel was more like drinking a really complex wine (layered, revealing details more slowly). I liked it, but we'll see how my friends who really like True Blood like it (I just recommended it to them).
B004RE29PO|5.0|The movie is just as incredible as it ever was. A near-perfect sequel that separated itself enough from the original to stand on its own merits.  This Blu-Ray transfer is the best I have seen so far (of course, I still have to open my Alien BD). The clarity and depth of the image is stunning. The image is rich and inky and just...well...wonderful. This is what real film should look like in HD -- it puts new digital prints to shame.  Having just re-watched the LOTR Extended Edition BDs, I can say without hesitation that the picture on Aliens is superior in every way.  Sound is also tremendous, though my set-up does not allow me to be as discerning as some others may be (sound bar is as sound bar does).  Overall, watching Aliens again on BD was a thrilling experience, almost like watching it for the first time. I can't wait to crack the plastic wrap on the original!
B004ZRV3AU|4.0|Simple tool with solid results. I use it to make glasses out of beer bottles and on my first attempt at 12 bottles i had 10 that were flawlessly cut, while the other 2 were cut, but uneven. As long as you take the time to adjust it properly, you will have good results.
B0045HCJT4|4.0|If you like Kurt Russell, you will like this movie. He grew up a Disney child star, but pulled off the tough guy soldier with this performance. Not any real deep plot, but fun to watch. Kind of a sci-fi Rambo.
0740797719|5.0|Like Gurney, I remember sitting in my college color theory course mixing paints like I was in a chemistry class.  Making those little swatches, arranging them in order on another piece of board and getting graded on how close we came to the original example.  Being taught that red is hot, blue is cool, purple is ambiguous and yellow can make people happy or suicidal.  It was formulaic, boring and well....not enough.<br /><br />Gurney expands on all of that.  I can't even begin to go into what this book touches upon.  Every page is a wealth of information and super, super inspirational.  I noticed a change in the way I think when I paint and the resulting artwork right away after starting this book.  Most art instruction books I own I go through once or twice and then they sit on a shelf in my hobby room.  Not this one, it is kept right by my desk and is used often as reference.  It is in my opinion, a must have for both beginner and seasoned artists alike.<br /><br />And gamut masking...that just blew my mind.<br /><br />I would not however, recommend it to someone who has not learned the basics of color.  This is more like the next step in learning how to utilize color in a realistic way. This is not a step-by-step but a way of looking at things (be they real or in your head) and representing them visually in your work.<br /><br />I recommend this for digital artists as well.  While Gurney is a traditional painter, everything in this book (except perhaps the list of paints he uses lol) is still relevant to digital painting and drawing.  Also, do not let the \\"realist\\" term throw you off.  These principals are also applicable to all styles, not just realism.  If you want believable color and lighting in any of your work (realism, comics, anime etc.) get this book!  And actually READ it.  Don't just look at the pictures!
0142419400|4.0|Cute! Cute! Cute! Did I tell you it was cute by the way! I had so much fun reading this story, it completely captivated me and I read it in one day. It is a great chic lit read with lots of self discovery, first loves, romance, some stupidity, naivety, and immaturity. Oh and I can not forget that it all takes place in Paris. What better place to be to fall in love! There must be a French rule some place, stating one must come and fall in love while you are there. Anna is sent off to boarding school her senior year, awful I would agree who wants to move their senior year. That's how Anna feel too, she can't believe her parents are doing this to her. However once she is there she makes some great friends, and finds that she is losing her heart to one of them who just so happens to be spoken for. The story unfolds from here will they work out or not. What are they willing to do or sacrifice to make it. This story is really a story of self discovery the stupid human moments we all have as we grow and mature. Anne and Etienne, are really immature at times which drove me a little crazy. At the same time it is fitting to their story. It was a lot of fun to watch it all play out, a nice comfy read.   language is frequent through out story two F words.   The romance was clean, lots of drinking and getting drunk, couple of inappropriate situations, with no detail. Not for my teen.   Review also found at once upon a time book review. blogspot. com
B005WWBP1O|5.0|I love this book. When I got my kindle, this was the first eBook I downloaded. Much easier to read on the kindle and much easier to carry. Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austin if by far one of The Best eBooks out.
B0007OZ13A|2.0|After reading the book \\"Good to Great\\" by Jim Collins I really liked the idea of his \\"hedgehog\\" concept. I wanted to have a little figurine of a hedgehog on my desk at work to remind me of the importance of this concept in my own life. So I spent a fair amount of time online trying to find a little hedgehog that looked nice.<br /><br />After looking at a number of different ones I actually decided to buy two different ones since I couldn't decide which one I liked better and they were both relatively inexpensive. The other one I tried was [[ASIN:B00508O3TG 3 inch Animal Figure Hedgehog Hunched Down Collectible Display]]. Between the two, I definitely like the other one by StealStreet better. It's about 1/3rd larger and the detail on the other figurine is more refined. This one is smaller, more \\"rough sketch\\" like, and not quite as cute (not that that was a major criteria for me).<br /><br />Personally I would still like to find hedgehog figurine that is at least partially curled up in a ball so it reminds me even more of how Jim Collins described what a hedgehog does. But the other figurine is a nice one none the less. Of course, the StealStreet Hedgehog is also more than twice as expensive as this one, but I still think it's worth it.<br /><br />In the end, I gave this one to my kids and they have fun playing with it. So it's all good.
0446547654|3.0|Nicholas Sparks novels are kind of my guilty pleasure... I know I'll never come away from his novels with an enlightened or deepened view of the world, but I always know I'll walk away from his novels feeling the love from the characters. That being said, it's hard for me to rate this novel because even though I love his novels, I really am starting to get tired of the recycled plots/characters formula. But I'm gonna try my hardest to explain what I did and didn't like about this one.     The Good: I really loved and appreciated the way Sparks took on the topic of alcoholism. He didn't make the character the stereotypical dirty, violent, raging alcoholic. Instead he chose to showcase the character as a high-functioning alcoholic, a middle class, white collar, nice family man. I think Sparks made a great choice doing this because there are SO many families that experience alcoholism in a parent even though on the outside they may seem completely normal. Even successful, charming businessmen and women can fall into the traps of alcoholism. Sparks also did a magnificent job creating the worlds scariest brothers. Oh my. Ted and Abee Cole are some frightening characters. These are the type of guys who wouldn't blink an eye at killing someone if they were provoked. They are the main character's brothers and I don't blame Dawson for hating his kin. There were actually passages that I cringed because the brothers were that creepy/scary. The one thing I ALWAYS love about Sparks books are the settings. I love the North Carolina southern-ish type of setting. He always describes the setting in such detail that I think I can visit North Carolina in my head rather than actually going there. It makes me want to move there!     The Bad: Okay. Besides being horribly predictable, this book is basically The Notebook/Message in a Bottle/Nights in Rodanthe mixed into one. Rich girl meets poor boy, they fall in love, girl is forbidden to see boy because her parents disapprove, boy and girl have fight, life goes on but both think about each other often, then something happens that brings them back together and they rekindle their \\"one true love\\" status but both believe things should go back to \\"normal\\" until one of them realizes that's the wrong decision and then something tragic and bad happens and there is a sappy ending. Something else I've noticed is that the older I get and the more and more I read, the less and less Spark's sentences seem unique. They seem a bit contrived, forced and cheesy honestly. I'm really not trying to dog on him because I truly do love him and his ideas, I'm just saying there are some things you don't realize until you get older and the quality of his writing is one of those things. As far as the characters go, it's hard to get attached to the characters because as far as I'm concerned, I've seen Amanda and Dawson in Sparks other novels. Whereas when I read The Notebook, Noah and Allie were such unique, different characters that I couldn't help but fall in love with them. I also thought the character of Tuck could have been SO MUCH MORE.  He was supposed to be this great character that represented the past for Amanda and Dawson but he just didn't live up to the hype he was given in the first couple chapters. There's a part where he leaves letters for Amanda and Dawson and Sparks builds up the scene like these letters are going to contain some serious information or advice and once the letters are revealed, they really aren't anything great. I was highly disappointed.     Overall, I'm not denying the fact that I finished this book in a day and a half and that I plowed through it with intensity like I do for amazing books, all I'm saying is that this is a novel I've seen many times before, mostly from Sparks himself and I was hoping it would be a little different. I'm going to give this book a C.
B005HPA2XI|4.0|This is a good album from a talented band of musicians. I like it better than Crack the Skye...it has more replay value to me.  What I don't understand, is why so many people can't understand how a band changes over time.  So many people want Remission part 2 or Leviathon part 2, those albums are great, awesome in fact...and and have been done.  So why replicate?  All good bands evolve, change sounds, and tighten up.  You can't scream your head off on every song on every album, (unless you're Slayer) so the vocals have changed.  I don't need a Leviathon repeat, I already own it, if I want to hear that MAstodon, I put that record on.  Hats off to making changes and keeping things interesting!

B004LUS390|1.0|this seemed like it would be a good app for art, judging from the reviews, so I got the paid version. The 1st time I opened it, it would only make a plain black line on white, and a page showing gestures' taps, &amp; choices, none of which worked. Later, after 1 or more restarts, it worked. But only that one time. Next time, no go. Uninstall, reinstall, update, etc. Well, it never worked again. It's gone now, maybe I'll reinstall it again some day.
B002BU0DPE|4.0|I purchased the PX21 headset with the optional digital signal processor about 10 months ago. The audio and mic work great and the audio adjustment controls are convenient and easy to use. The headset is lightweight and so doesn't bother you while wearing it for a marathon gaming session. However, because it is lightweight, it isn't the sturdiest headset I've owned. I recently dropped mine (off of a tall bookshelf mind you) and the plastic connection between the earpiece and the part that goes over your head broke (turtle beach has replacements for some parts, but not this one). That said, I liked it enough that I ordered a replacement PX21 the same day.
1439153663|4.0|It's books like this one that make me proud to be a reader.  I fell in love with the characters.  It's disturbing at times but consider the subject matter.
B003X5UFWW|5.0|Awesome movie! Love the story, the music and the acting! Somewhat hard to understand with the English dub-over but you get used to it. Highly recommend!
0062011847|5.0|I loved this new novel!  I bought it in the hardback, not the Kindle, and am very well satisfied to add it to my collection.  It's one of his best including the bits of social responsibility!  I am an older reader and am glad to see that Sir Terry's new novel has not left his Night Watch characters suspended in agelessness with unresolved problems.      I will agree with others that the very beginning and very end of the novel verges on the senatorial for a few pages.  But one has to realize that publishers want X number of pages, so the author has to fluff things up at times.  I don't believe I've read an established writer that hasn't had to do this.
B005FUTBWS|4.0|I REALLY enjoyed this movie - the most inventive horror flick I've seen in years. I never would have guessed this was a Kevin Smith film and, honestly, it shouldn't matter to anyone. It feels more like a Tarantino movie in every way. I imagine this as a part of Grindhouse 2. The less you know about the plot the better - the complete unpredictability of it was intoxicating. Great acting from all involved - particularly Parks as the preacher man, Root as a closet-case small town sheriff, and the three actors who play the horny teens.  There are some disturbing scenes in the first half, but nothing too gory, and pretty quaint by today's torture-porn standards. Lot's of low-key, sly humor that made me chuckle throughout. Don't watch it with any expectations, because this is NOT a standard horror film by ANY definition.
B005OYKI1I|3.0|Though I bought and downloaded the HD version, the portable copy that I moved to my Galaxy Tab 10.1 is so grainy Toreto looked like bald Mario on Atari.

1439102732|3.0|Only getting 3 stars 'cuz 2.5 isn't an option and it's not really a 2. I LOVE Picoult's work, but this one felt....rushed? Disconnected? And, annoyingly, it took more than 1/2 of the book to get to the actual \\"story.\\" I didn't really like, or connect with, any of the characters and thought the ending was way too....fairytaleish. I believe Picoult usually does a great job dealing with controversial issues, but there was just too much going on in this one to focus on any of them: embryos, parental rights, lesbian issues, religion......too much.   If you already like Picoult, you'll be okay with this, but if you've never read her before, don't start with this one!
0385732554|4.0|Jonas is a young boy, roughly eleven years old, who lives in a world unlike our own. In Jonas's world there is no pain or suffering, no poverty, and no fighting. Also, in Jonas's world there is no choice or freedom, no love, and no sunshine. In Jonas's world everyone strives for sameness. Anything out of the ordinary is frowned upon by the elders.    Up until the \\"Ceremony of Twelve\\" Jonas was just like every other Eleven in his community. He went to school, played with his friends, went to his volunteer hours afterwards, and on home to dinner with his family unit. However, the ceremony of twelve changes everything in Jonas's life. He is given his assignment, and he must then begin his studies on it. It is in his studies with The Giver that Jonas realizes that there are other ways to life than his own.    The Giver is the first book in a trilogy written by Lois Lowry. It won the Newbery Medal in 1993. Lois Lowry (AKA Lois Ann Hammersberg) was first a photographer and journalist before becoming an author of children's books. She has written around thirty other children's novels including Number the Stars, which also won the Newbery Medal.   At first, I didn't read The Giver myself. My eighth grade novels teacher read it to my class. I was mesmerized and truthfully a little scared by Jonas's world. Lowry does a wonderful job describing a community of sameness. Her descriptions of memories and color are vivid and lifelike. Jonas is such a relatable character that it makes it easy for a young person to imagine himself/herself in his position. The writing style is simple, yet poetic in the way she describes details. The story is also captivating and it keeps the reader wanting to come back to find out more about Jonas's fate and his community.   After having not read the book in seven years, there were a few things that I was disappointed about. I wish Lowry would have given the book a true ending. I don't feel like there was much of an ending at all, and that she just didn't know where to go next so she ended it. After learning that it was a trilogy, I figured she picked his story up again in the next book. The next book in her series, Gathering Blue, is a different story altogether. However, Jonas's character does reappear in the third book of the trilogy, Messenger.    I feel like the simplistic writing style is the only thing that makes this a children's book. The storyline is great, the writing is poetic, and there are many things that I took in as an adult reading it that I didn't catch the first time around as a younger person. This book is a wonderful example of fantasy fiction, and I think that anyone who enjoys fantasy fiction books, child, teen, or adult, would enjoy reading this novel. There is no other book, that I have read, that is like it.
0062060554|1.0|I can't believe the rave reviews for this book!  What a waste of time.  I'm so surprised, as it has great reviews and I had it on hold from the library for a long time to get it.  I found it positively boring and I guessed the end right in the beginning.  Yawn.

0439023521|5.0|HUNGER GAMES  This is definitely one of my favorite books of all time. From the first time I picked it up, i could not put it down. The subject matter was so interesting and like nothing I had ever read before. Suzanne Collins is truly a great writer.  I was instantly enthralled with katniss' story and wanted to learn more.  All the characters are highly developed and the romance is as good as the writing.    I would recommend this to everyone and I already have to all my friends.  Its really an amazing read!  Bravo Suzanne collins!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|While the book may not be the best writing of all time, the story telling is wonderful.  Like any good story, you are left wanting more, which means you end up buying the second and third books!

0062112430|4.0|DELIRIUM  I must say, I really was not a fan of the cover of the first delirium, and was extremely jealous when a newer prettier one came out. Sorry, I just wanted to get that out there, but anyway despite the cover troubles, I quite loved delirium and am becoming to love Lauren oliver's works.  I've noticed that she takes the hard, but honorable endings and quite admire that in an author.  Delirium was a great dysotopian read for those genre fans out there, but it definitely was not my favorite, falling behind fan favorites like divergent and the hunger games.  But nonetheless it was a good story full of intrigue and action down into the last tear jerking page.  Which i might have cried about.  Because Oliver really went that unconventional, sad route of an ending, but i felt it needed to be done and despite the sadness it added a depth to the story that had not been there before and was the best ending i could have imagined.  Overall it was a good read and I so recommend it.   I eagerly await more works by Oliver also!

0439023513|1.0|I am a huge fan of the series and a loyal follower from the beginning, especially loving the first book and katniss from the get go, but this third installment was just awful in my opinion.  First of all katniss morphs into this completely unlikabke character, that annoys you half the time, the peeta situation becomes more cliched than ever, and the ending of gale's story is completely tragic.  Maybe the book would have been alright but the middle chapters are completely confusing and katniss spends about half the book waking up from being heavily sedated.  I was not impressed, it's really a sad let down from the two other books.

B005HS00NW|3.0|I was really looking forward to M83's latest album after hearing \\"Midnight City\\", their excellent first single a few months ago. _Hurry Up, We're Dreaming_ is a well produced, audacious double album more or less continuing on from where _Saturdays=Youth_ left off. It's a pretty decent album overall, but I can't help feeling that Anthony G skimped a bit here and there when it comes to the melodies. You'll find a bunch of electro-pop tracks reminiscent of numerous 80's hits (\\"slappin' the bass, mon!\\") like Level 42 or Propaganda, a lot of instrumental interludes and keyboard driven melodies. This album sounds drenched in keyboards, and that's not always a bad thing. The saxophone can be heard embellishing a couple of songs. And there are a couple of tracks that feature acoustic guitar as well.   I really like most of the traditional, structured songs more than the instrumental interludes. \\"Reunion\\" starts off with some glorious chords and drums that sound like emphatic punctuation marks and remind me of the British band Prefab Sprout circa their _Jordan: the Comeback_ (1990) days. The drums crashing forth from the opening of \\"New Map\\" will take you back to \\"Don't Save Us from the Flames\\" from M83's 2005 release _Before the Dawn Heals Us_. \\"OK Pal\\" is a pretty catchy Howard Jones-ish number. But for me the highlight of the album, besides \\"Midnight City\\" is \\"Steve McQueen\\", a song with a soaring, fists-in-the-air chorus, dense guitars and pretty, swirling keyboards and lyrics that could be about what? The celebration of life, perhaps, self-forgiveness?, rejuvenation? It doesn't really matter. This song is REALLY GOOD.   \\"Fountains\\" and \\"Klaus I Love You\\" are a couple of the shorter, (mostly) instrumental pieces that work. In fact, I would have liked to hear how \\"KILY\\" would have sounded if it was more fleshed out. But most of the shorter songs don't have the melodies to make them memorable.  The album does seem to move along pretty quickly and considering its hour pluslong running time, that's saying something. Perhaps some of the shorter tracks will grow on me as I keep listening. But the tracks worth hearing, the ones I keep going back to, are \\"Midnight City\\", \\"Reunion\\", and \\"Steve McQueen\\".  *** 1/2 stars
B0055V6EZE|5.0|If you're into blues, you need to buy this.  I knew that Laurie was a musician, but hadn't known that he was really into this genre.  A booklet is included with a very short biography as to how he became so entranced with the music, the musicians, and the singers.  Lots of photos.  Blurbs about many of the musicians and singers.  I was familiar with many of the songs and had never heard some of them.  All of them were great.  Recommend it highly.
0143034901|5.0|One of the very best novels I've read in recent years. The fantasy elements may get to be a little much for some readers, particularly if you've read other<br />Ruis novels, but I can't remember the last time a book engrossed me quite like this. Compares very favorably to The Book Thief, though it's obviously a slightly different genre.<br /><br />This would get six stars if I could award it.
B001UV4XJ2|4.0|Harry and his gang of Hogwarts rebels conclude their great 10 year adventure.  In this finale, Harry is indeed the focus as he must face Lord Voldemort once and for all and to the death.  Ralph Fiennes continues his great work as the evil Lord.  This movie also ties up a lot of loose ends and neatly shows us how certain events really took place.  I have to give myself credit for spotting one of those twists some time back.<br /><br />My only beef with this whole series involves Harry and his inability to strike up a real romance with anyone.  He has eyes for Ginny (Bonnie Wright) but she's rarely around and even less so in this finale.  The production value here is as good as any movie out there.  The film is dark, scary and ominous throughout.  As the series progressed and the kids aged so does the tone tends to darken as well.<br /><br />David Yates takes the director's chair again and doesn't disappoint.  Steve Kloves continues as he has from the beginning, to interpret Rowling's books with honesty and consistency.  Warner Bros. should also be congratulated for somehow managing to keep all the key actors together for 10 year and allow us to watch them grow and mature.  This has been a wonderful adventure which concludes with a flourish and a more than satisfying ending; including the epilog that shows our heroes 19 year into the future.  Now it's time to break out the hankies.<br /><br />1-12-11:  Blu ray update.  This film is displayed in 2.40:1 anamorphic wide screen.  The film is purposely shot in gloomy colors keeping with the tone and this is transferred properly.  The contrast is excellent.  The DTS-HD Master Audio is superb.  There are many quiet scenes in the film yet the dialog is clear and centered.  The surrounds come into play when the action sequences are amped up.  There is one scene where Voldemort's voice circles around the room.  Cool.  Included in the package are numerous featurettes & interviews.
B005KMX866|5.0|First let me say that \\"Beyond the Sun\\" is a great album by Chris Isaak. And it is great in large part because it is not just \\"another Chris Isaak album.\\" It is an album devoted to a music he loves, that he has in fact based his entire career on - rockabilly and early rock and roll. But it is also a deliberate departure from the songwriting formula that he has followed, with great success, for his entire professional life. We, and he, are better for the chances he takes here.<br /><br />Like many reviewers, I am an enthusiastic fan of Chris Isaak. I first heard \\"Blue Hotel,\\" from the album \\"Chris Isaak,\\" while driving home from work. I bought the album the next day. I was hooked by the purity of Isaak's voice, his range, and the feeling he conveyed. The amazing guitar work of Calvin Wilsey (now unfortunately long gone from the band) perfectly complemented the brooding voice of Isaak. From the barely contained anger of \\"You Owe Me Some Kind Of Love,\\" to the mixture of desolation and cynicism of \\"Lovers Game\\", Isaak displayed his mastery of a type of singing I thought had disappeared with Orbison and Elvis and Jerry Lee. It was a distinct style. It wasn't \\"Cathy's Clown\\" - to take nothing away from the Everly Brothers, or \\"I'm A Loser\\" - the Beatles had other ways of singing about broken hearts. And it sure wasn't the Stones or the Who.<br /><br />The style adopted in \\"Chris Isaak\\" and the albums that came before and after it, is one of real teen angst, a style of songwriting that first flowered in rockabilly and the earliest rock and roll.  It shows up repeatedly in many of the records by artists associated with Sun Records. These songs weren't just about poor guys who got dumped by their best girl, or were so dizzy over some prom queen that they lost control of their car and flew off the road and up to heaven. The new songs were complex and full of contradiction; at their best they had a depth and expressivenes that knocked the Bobby Rydell's, Bobby Vee's, and Fabian's right out of the box and off the radio. Who wanted to hear \\"Blue Velvet\\" when you could listen to \\"Heartbreak Hotel,\\" \\"Any Way You Want Me,\\" or \\"Running Scared\\"? Those songs convinced you with their lyrics and their passionate singing that their protagonists were as confused, co-dependent, and self-pitying as you and the guy who sat next to you in homeroom were. Those songs said no one has ever felt as bad as I do. They were self-absorbed, like most real adolescents are, and they didn't pretend to have all the answers. Even hard-boiled rockers like \\"Great Balls of Fire\\" were light years away from \\"Go Away, Little Girl.\\" The first lines say it all - \\"You shake my nerves and you rattle my brain, too much love drives a man insane, you broke my will, what a thrill, goodness gracious, great balls of fire!\\" That's pretty powerful stuff, even without the not-so-subtle innuendo of the title.<br /><br />Chris Isaak's genius has always been in his ability to capture that sound - the wailing pain and intensity that were so much a part of the birth of rock and roll. On album after album, he never fails to concoct convincing variations on his introspective \\"forever blue\\" rock persona. I remember a joke he told about himself between songs at a show - he's standing outside the venue between sets, and a man walking by stops, looks at him closely, then says \\"Hey, aren't you the guy who sings all those `sissy' songs?\\" Isaak replies, after a beat, \\"they're not sissy, they're sensitive.\\"<br /><br />Issak has the retro, sensitive \\"blue\\" rockabilly song down pat, from \\"Wicked Game\\" to \\"Funeral in the Rain\\" to \\"Speak of the Devil.\\" Even a \\"light\\" tune like \\"Don't Leave Me On My Own,\\" with its gently rolling rhythm and up-beat hooky melody is not immune - if the girl who ditched him will come back, \\"I'll fix the place up.\\" Offering to clean his apartment in a pathetic attempt to win back his girl.<br /><br />It is precisely because \\"Beyond the Sun\\" is filled with songs that are rockabilly classics but aren't classic \\"Chris Isaak\\" songs, that this record so satisfying. Several reviewers have noted that he is at his best on this album singing lesser-known tunes, particularly rave-ups like \\"Miss Pearl\\" or \\"Dixie Fried.\\" I think that's because those songs are the ones that take him farthest away from his own songwriting style. They are songs that he obviously loves, but generally doesn't attempt. They come out sounding fresh, energized, and rocking.<br /><br />Isaak also says in the liner notes that he tried to stay away from rote \\"covers\\" of the iconic tunes that everyone knows. And that approach generally works. On \\"It's Now or Never,\\" Elvis' great homage to Mario Lanza, Isaak doesn't try to out-bombast the King. He pulls back a little, and his version of the song shines a new light on an old chestnut without being self-consciously different.<br /><br />We can thank Chris Isaak for loving a music that was \\"uncool,\\" so much so that he has devoted his career to it and written a great many songs that are very cool along the way. And we can thank him for taking a deliberate step away from the relative comfort of his own particular songwriting style this time around and giving us an album devoted to exploring some of the other styles that make up what we call early rock and roll, or rockabilly. Highly recommended.gs, that this record so satisfying.

B000ICLRHK|4.0|Usually numb Keanu Reeves shows remarkable action hero status as a L.A. police officer who gets sucked into a series of ransom demands from a crazed ex-cop and bomb making specialist (Dennis Hopper).  The film's opening in a high rise is often forgotten but is the equal to the rest of the film.  Here, Jack (Reeves) and his partner Harry (Jeff Daniels) rescue a half dozen employees from an elevator loaded with a bomb and remote control activator.  Of course, \\"Speed\\" is mostly known for the non-stop action that involves a city bus full of passengers included spunky Annie (a terrific Sandra Bullock).  She is forced into action as the bus driver and must keep the bus above 50 MPH.  The film never lets up even when you think all is well.  The script is nicely developed and damn if director Jon de Bont doesn't pull it all off with a minimum of pyrotechnics (don't worry there's still plenty) and a maximum of tension and terror.  Excellent film that certainly holds up well.
B005IS565S|5.0|I enjoy the music and I loved the low price. This is my 1st FFDP album and I am now a huge fan.
B004B63M1S|4.0|Director Robert Rodriguez takes another stab and what has become a successful run of \\"grindhouse\\" films.  This move was initially shown as a trailer between \\"Death Proof\\" and \\"Planet Terror\\" when they appeared as a double feature a few years ago.  This is a brilliant idea as Rodriguez finds \\"A\\" list actors who elevate the style of the movie.  Granted this is stupid, dark and over-the-top violent but the movie doesn't take itself too seriously.  I had a lot of fun and certainly enjoyed seeing Lindsay Lohan in new light!
0142000655|5.0|John Steinbeck's American epic, East of Eden, is a complex analysis of good and evil in society.  The book follows two families over three generations (from the end of the Civil War to the beginning of World War I) as their lives intertwine and the characters are faced with a series of tough moral decisions.  Reading this book is like being caught in a giant moral dilemma; Steinbeck provides the reader with enough information to form opinions on the morality of the characters in the book.  This forces the reader to make tough decisions about who is good and who is evil, while Steinbeck never ceases to shock the reader with the actions of his characters.     Steinbeck's novel is held together by the complex and highly developed characters he features as the focus of the book.  There are several important characters that can all be defined by a very distinct set of qualities.  There is the extremely wise Samuel Hamilton, the intelligent, but naive Adam Trask, and the notoriously evil Cathy Ames.  Steinbeck spends a great deal of time developing these characters and the reward is a satisfying representation of America in a period of dishevelment as industrialization and west ward expansion are the focus of society.  The plethora of characters created by Steinbeck creates a complex and intricate balance in the novel; the actions of one character will undoubtedly affect all of the characters in either a positive or adverse way.  These characters are what truly makes this novel an American classic; Steinbeck's ability to create a memorable cast drive the rest of the story.     One of these characters, Cathy Ames, may be the most evil, twisted character ever created in all of American literature.  The reader is introduced to Ames as she murders her parents by lighting their house on fire.  From this point on, it is clear that Ames is the embodiment of evil in the novel.  As Ames becomes ingratiated into the main plot, more evil actions ensue, including the attempted murderof her husband and the murder of a madam in charge of a brothel.  These actions occur before Ames becomes truly evil by the end of the novel.  Another of the more memorable characters in East of Eden is Lee, the Trask family's loyal Asian servant.  Lee is meant to play the stereotypical Asian role in the novel, but Steinbeck attempts to break race barriers by incorporating Lee into the main plot of the novel.  Lee is extremely intelligent and very wise.  He puts up a facade of a stereotypical Asian servant around ignorant and arrogant Americans.  However, around people he trusts, such as Samuel Hamilton and Adam Trask, he reveals his intelligence.  Lee is very complex and Steinbeck ensures that he plays an important role in the novel.     The novel lacks a clearly defined plot; it follows two families over several generations as they struggle to establish themselves in the Salinas Valley in California.  However, the novel does act as an allegory to the Biblical story of Cain and Abel.  There are several obvious references to the book of Genesis throughout the novel (East of Eden, Adam Trask, and the twins Caleb and Aaron, meant to represent Cain and Abel), creating an interesting outlet for Steinbeck to analyze religious and social issues prominent in society during this era of American history.  There are times when Steinbeck's commentary is somewhat subtle and there are times when his commentary is blatantly obvious as the narrator provides insight into the state of society during this time.  However, unlike other fictitious novels that attempt to tackle heavy topics such as religion, Steinbeck is able to provide this commentary without sounding too pretentious; he doesn't claim to know the answers to some of the more controversial issues regarding religion.  This adds depth to Steinbeck's already complex and layered novel, contributing to the intricacy of this intelligently written novel.     East of Eden, like all of Steinbeck's novels, is full of descriptive passages that are essential in establishing the setting for the novel.  The novel also takes place in the Salinas Valley of California, the same place that Steinbeck grew up in as a child.  Steinbeck's knowledge of the region enables him to provide deep, descriptive details of the setting for the story.  The setting is almost as important as the characters, as the distinct environment of the Salinas Valley shapes their behavior throughout the novel.  In fact, the Salinas Valley is a metaphor for the lives of the Hamiltons and the Trasks.  The valley appears to be heavenly and fertile, but as one digs into the soil unexpected layers of clay, dirt, and rock are revealed.  The Hamiltons and the Trasks also appear to have it all together, but as the reader is familiarized with these characters, it becomes clear that they struggle with a great deal of internal conflict.  Steinbeck's emphasis on setting also adds to the complexity of the novel, creating a memorable multilayered epic that has become an American classic.     In writing this novel, Steinbeck took on a nearly impossible challenge; he attempted to write a novel that would encompass ideas about morality, religion, and politics, while remaining intelligible to his audience.  Steinbeck deserves to be commended for accomplishing this feat.  Reading this book should be a requirement for everyone as it successfully touches the reader emotionally, logically, and ethically.  The highly complex, but relatable characters will surely find a way to sneak into one's heart and become a conscious reminder of ethical behavior.  This novel will truly change lives and this is what has kept it moderately relevant in today's society.  Reading this novel will not disappoint.
B004EPZ08E|3.0|I knew going into this movie that I would have a problem accepting the fact that Jennifer Aniston is a dentist, let alone the idea that she could ever be a turn-off sexually.  In general, this is a pretty funny movie.  It is better than \\"Hangover 2\\" but falls short of \\"Bridesmaids\\" in the scheme of \\"R\\" rated comedies this year.  Jason Bateman plays Nick in his usual cool, but nerdy at the same time, way.  Jason Sudeikis is Kurt and is always funny.  Finally, newcomer Charlie Day (\\"It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia\\") plays the sexually harassed employee of Dr. Julia Harris (Aniston).  In reality the best roles may be for the mean bosses, Kevin Spacey and Colin Farrell.  And Jamie Foxx steals his scenes as the hit man go between.  The set up is kind of ridiculous.  The 3 friends marching into a `gansta' bar is absurd.  Still, well just enjoy the laughs.
B000FCK8ZK|5.0|Like so many other people, I fell in love with the \\"Dexter\\" saga as a weekly series on Showtime.

B004V6MWFU|4.0|I'd listened to this about a dozen times on NPR Music before realizing that the verdict was in and I needed to own it.  There's little for me to add to the discussion over the quality of the songs on this collection, other than that, for my very limited exposure to the ukulele, this is the first time that I enjoyed it not as a novelty but as a truly effective instrument and accompaniment for vocal performance.   By the way, this definitely makes the case for cd over mp3.  Amazon sells both, as of this writing, for roughly the same price ($8); however, for the cd, you get a nice bit of packaging (I sometimes forget how much pleasure I get in that part of a music purchase).

B0053VKP8S|4.0|To get the best performance, I had to remove my cars antenna. This was actually expected and this works as well or better than three similar devices I have purchased in the past. It is easily the smallest and least intrusive. Would have been 5 stars, but there is very quiet static between songs or if there is a silence in the song. This is very minor and completely worth putting up with for the other benefits.
B0044WUJQ0|5.0|This is a very good sequel to the first Halloween film. It picks up right where the first film ended and will leave you on edge until the end credits. As some other people have stated in their review the picture quality isn't perfect as there are some white specks at the start of the film. They do not seem to reappear after the opening credits, however. This is also the first film I have rented through Amazon Instant Video and I was very satisfied with the quality. It played on my Roku XD in full high-definition and didn't have to pause and reload at all.
1400069181|5.0|Great book for anyone wanting more fulfillment out of life and has thought about starting a company or organization.   Blake shares his story about starting TOMS and his successful \\"one for one\\" business model.  This is not a promotional marketing tool that some skeptics may think, but rather a book that is to the point about philanthropy and entrepreneurship and how you can easily align them together.  This book will motivate, challenge and inspire you to give back to society. Several examples of how it comes back to you in so many different ways (as it always does).   Upon buying this book you will also support a under privileged child through the charity of \\"First Book.\\"  Highly recommend.  It is a great gift type book as well.
B0053TMP24|5.0|When I pre-ordered this book back in August, it said the text-to-speech would be enabled. It's not. Now it is listed that way, but what happened to the book I wanted... the one with text-to-speech. It's crazy that a book which features dyslexic heros does not support this feature! And it's even more crazy that it was advertised to have it and it doesn't. Combine that with the dozens of typo's and mis-spacings and you have a real mess on your hands!<br />I love this series, and have been counting the days for it to be released, but next time I hope they do a better job with the kindle version. It's only $1.00 less than the hardcopy, and the quality is VERY POOR.<br /><br />The story however was wonderful! Love Frank and Hazel. Looking forward to getting all 7 on that ship and moving forward. I wish there had been one more chapter at the end. I felt like the \\"cliff hanger\\" was too abrupt. Starting the count down till next fall when book 3 will be released!
B004LROMSO|3.0|Well, it would seem that they have decided to re-make the Arthurian legend into a modern costume drama like Spartacus and some of the others currently in vogue.<br /><br />It's passable. Though \\"Arthur\\" seems little more than a whiny peasant boy in the first season. I'm hoping that if they make more seasons he'll \\"grow the heck up\\" a bit. If not, this show may be doomed. Other than some gratuitous sex scenes (it was made by Starz, after all), it doesn't seem to have a whole lot going for it yet.<br /><br />Others have noted that it's a bit revisionist and overly 'politically correct' with modern sensibilities rather than being completely authentic to the supposed time period. Though, given the Arthurian legend's general emphasis on 'justice/equality for all,' I suppose it's forgivable that modern notions of the same should creep in.<br /><br />It does come with a few featurettes, if you're into that. I don't know if it's enough to 'save' the show.<br /><br />If you liked the show, you'll probably like the DVDs as they're pretty competently transferred. There's the usual Play All feature, though it would be nice if the intros and credits could be optionally left out when playing all, to save on having to skip around or fast forward. As far as the discs themselves go, I didn't find much to complain about.<br /><br />So, I guess it's just down to whether or not you like the show. Not my cup of tea, personally. Though, seeing Claire Forlani in a new role wasn't unwelcome, even if they did kill her off at the end of the show. Speaking of which, there were a lot of \\"oh, come on!\\" moments through out, not least of all being Igraine's (Forlani's) death scene. I could help myself when rather than naming her murderer to Merlin, she yammers on about pretty much everything else under the sun before finally dying. Seriously? It's nonsense like this that just makes me think the writing is a bit sub-par. And, I'm sorry, but gratuitous nudity can't make up for bad writing...

B005F3XV62|4.0|The positives of the movie are many. The special effects with the animals talking and moving are terrific. Kevin James is as likeable as ever. The main female leads are attractive and interesting There are many laugh-out loud funny gags. There are a few good throwaway lines and several touching moments between the Vet and the Zookeeper. The movie is clean: it has no nudity and no bad language I can remember. The scatological humor is kept to a minimum. Since a monkey is one of the most talkative characters, scatological humor could have taken over the show.  The only negatives are the plot and some of the bizarre characters. The plot is just full of holes. A person starts hearing animals talk and never seeks help? A couple of the minor characters are strange and not really funny. However, in a screwball comedy these defects are really minor.   My wife enjoyed the movie immensely.
0156027321|4.0|Life of Pi is an absolute genius story. It always keeps you guessing what will happen next. The story starts off with the introduction of Pi and his friends and family.

As one person quotes in the beginning of the novel that he \\"will make you believe in God\\" by the end of this outstanding book.

0786868694|5.0|I love this book! The recipes are easy, satisfying, and interesting. My son has memorized the recipe to the pancakes and since he uses vanilla soy milk and refrigerates the batter they are as sweet and delicate as crepes. I love that the book is written the way she talks on TV. If you add the accent it is like she is in the kitchen. Frankly, I haven't had one recipe come out wrong. To the reviewer who stated that they needed to add spice - Good for you! Cooking is personal and recipes are a starting point. Then you make it your own. I prefer cilantro to parsley so in many recipes, I substitute. That doesn't make the person who wrote the recipe wrong, just do what is right for you! By the way, the roasted lamb shoulder with pomegranate and mint is FABULOUS!
B005ELQVGW|3.0|I was really disappointed in Bjork's last two albums, Medulla and Volta.  When the early reviews said this hearkened back to the days of Vespertine and Homogenic, I ordered it with no advanced preview.  While I like it better than the latest two albums.......it is still a far cry to me from being as good as Vespertine and Homogenic.  Just my two krona.
1400079144|3.0|I have been in school for a year and a half and I was really looking forward to finally be able to read this book since I read all of the others. It started strong and I was intruiged with the characters, the plot, and the science. Basically, I couldn't put it down! I was waiting for the big \\"reveal\\"! Finally, as I started to reach the end, I kept waiting... There was one section where I read it 3 times, thinking I had missed something. A subtlety perhaps. I put down the book, quizzically tried to understand the ramifications, and realized there was none. What I read was what I got and what I got was nothing. I am in agreement with one reviewer; it was preachy and just disappointing. Halfway through, I guessed the truth about the protaganist, but once again, I hoped there was something more. This just felt like a book that fulfilled a contract and so Brown used the book to give us his overall world view. I prefer the contraversial to the preachy. He needed to save that for the real ministers. I don't know what to say; it just wasn't worth reading. I gave it 3 stars because until he got to the end, it was an interesting book. But the end made the whole experience futile. I won't bother with the movie to this one either.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This is a must read. The first book is def. the best in the triology. It's a page turner and hard to put down. I highly recommend this book.
B0055S348W|5.0|I have a Canon wi-fi printer.  The app software found my printer easily and works perfectly with it.  I have printed documents and internet pages.  The app contains printer preferences also.
B0058WFO06|5.0|If you're a fan of Steven Wilson, you realize the burden he carries with all of his work....you expect greatness...perfection...and you get that and more every time. Amazing...I heard during the pre-album release period about a heavy jazz influence, and I certainly hear some sprinkled throughout, but mainly I hear Steven Wilson just taking his talent to another level. Insurgentes was excellent, Grace is different...more adventurous, a step forward. Exceptionally beautiful music, broken into two discs but you'll always treat them as one, always. How SW remains under the radar is mind boggling. His music deserves to be heard by the masses.
1423140591|5.0|This second book in the Heroes Of Olympus series picks up right where \\"The Lost Hero\\" ended.Percy Jackson is back,and he's in big trouble.He can't remember anything except his own name and that of girlfriend Annabel.He's also being pursued by two vengeful gorgons.He goes to the Roman half-blood Camp Jupiter and meets two new friends-crafty,courageous Hazel and massive,superstrong Frank.The three are sent on a dangerous quest to save the camp and avert a disaster.This one is even better than \\"Hero\\".Riordan once again brings his most appealing lead character vividly back to life,and he introduces some<br />wonderfully well-drawn new ones(Hazel and Frank are excellent additions to the series).He also presents another solid,<br />well-craftd story that grabs you instantly and never lets go.Riordan just keeps getting better.I can't wait to see how he winds the series up!
0547396945|5.0|A mi y a mi nena de 2 anos nos encanta este libro. Los dibujitos y las palabras son tan divertidos. A ella le gusta preguntarme a mi, \\"donde esta la oveja verde\\" antes que yo lo dijera. Un libro muy bueno en ingles o espanol!
1594744769|4.0|I just finished reading this book on the Kindle app on my phone. It was great! I was able to zoom in on the pictures and letters, I didn't have issues seeing them. I love that the photos in this book are mostly authentic antique photos found in flea markets and collections.   The language in this book is certainly an issue. Not much swearing, mind you, but the main character makes frequent use of crude and suggestive language. I would highly reccommend not letting children younger read this. It's over their heads for the most part anyway.   I like the way this book was written. It was full of hooks and interest. I like books that are a bit creepy, and this one fit the bill. I wouldn't compare it to a Lemony Snicket book, it is not written in that style at all. More comparable to Mary Downing Hahn with bad language. :)
B000GH2YPG|4.0|Seen the movie many times so there weren't too many surprises except for du Maurier's writing style--very sensually detailed, full of beautiful descriptions. The story takes place in England in the 1930s and is narrated by a young nameless woman (played by Joan Fontaine in the film) who may be the most neurotic character in all of fiction. She marries well above her station and becomes the second Mrs. Maxim de Winter, the first being the mysterious Rebecca who died in a boating accident nearly a year before. \\"Rebecca\\" is a mystery, so I'll stop there, except to say that if you haven't seen the film the book will be hard to put down as you brave the suspense and clever plot turns. After I read to the end, I watched the movie again and this time the film seemed vacant.
B000B5MI3Q|5.0|I bought my first Seiko Diver back in the mid 70's and it lasted for than 25 years. I can only say that it was the best investment I have made in my life time. I used it in the military in all environments, from hot, humid, monsoon soaked jungles, hot in the day and cold at night sand filled desserts, the Arctic Circle with temps down to -60F temps, scuba diving down to depths of 125 feet and used it as my first aviation watch.  I could not believe the abuse it took and it kept on working. The only thing I did was to replace several arm bands but the watch was working great till the end.  I have also bought the Seiko Chronograph and enjoy it, but I always come back to the old standby work horse as my favorite being the Seiko Diver.
142311339X|5.0|This book was so good!  I mean I don't think ANYTHING can compare to the Percy Jackson and the Olympians but this was definitely not a disappointment .  It was a page turner and just good as its own series.  I'm reading Son of Neptune now and it's getting better by the page.  I'm happy that Rick Riordan was able to keep Percy alive through another series.  I can't get enough!  Every excited for the next installment not excited that I have to wait a YEAR!  It'll be pre-ordered none the less!!
B003Y5H54W|4.0|Decent movie with good actors to boot. The storyline is close to the original fairy tale, but with some twists and a more grown-up version. Not a good movie for young kids, as it has alot of violence, but teenagers and adults I think will like it. Keeps you guessing at who did what, so that gets your interest. I originally bought this for my teenage daughter, but I liked it too.
B005R32L66|5.0|I have a nextbook p 8 &quot; and it works perfectly audio and video. After i installed it i had to enable video calls before i can use the camera. this can be done from settings . also works perfectly on my galaxy s phone 4g.
B000TGJ80S|5.0|this is one of my wifes favorite films. I got this for her as a gift. she was not disappointed. the extras on these disks are very interesting if you like to see the behind the scenes aspects of the special effects and production details. the quality of the film was excellent. I highly recommend it.
B00407PNY2|5.0|The original RIDE!!!!  This movie is still as good as when I saw it released in the cinema.  Definately worth the watch.
B003YOMNCM|1.0|Once again I am disappointed by a Hilary Hahn CD. The Tchaikovsky lacks fire and is marred by tentative moments that seem at odds with the soloist's reputation as a great technician. The Higdon, despite some good moments, failed to capture my attention. This 21st century concerto is not the first prize-winner to strike me as boring. We still have most of century to find another Bartok, Prokofiev, Stravinsky, or even a Barber. I'd look elsewhere for a Tchaikovsky concerto CD.
B005WWBP1O|5.0|I read Pride and Prejudice in my early twenties. I'm in my 50s now and my goal is to read or reread the classics. This book was one of the first on my list. It is not a quick read but it is so worth it. The characters are exquisitely well thought out and the plot has twists and turns. The dialogue snaps. I just love this book and even recommended it to my four daughters. They love it just as much as I do.
B005LY4B0A|5.0|Good concept, good execution, good game play.  Addictive game and can be frustrating at times.  The hint feature could be better.  It is nice that it encourages you to try harder but the fact it gives the entire solution kind of sucks.  I would like it better if you earned hints through successful completion of a level, and it only gives 1 move per hint.
B002ZG993Q|4.0|As an actor developing his craft, right in front of your eyes, is a pure pleasure. One thinks of George back in the Rossane and ER days a cannot but marvel at his developing gift. Clooney's role in \\"The American\\" revealed this to me without a doubt.<br /><br />Similar to early Italian and French films, the expressions of the actors and what they do (visually) tells the story.<br /><br />Unfortunately, Clooney has become a popular cultural icon as the man that every woman wants - this immediatly put me off him. However, after seeing him in that Cohen brothers film, and \\"The Man Who Stares at Goats\\", my opinion of the man changed for the better.<br /><br />The story is about a professional Hitman trying to get out of the Game. He meets an old Italian priest and begins to reflect on his life and values.<br /><br />This is not a film full of action, but a simple, subtle piece that deserves great consideration.<br /><br />Enjoyed it.
B0052TDGQO|5.0|All I can say is \\"WOW!!\\".  I'm not, nor will I ever be a fan of American Idol, but when I read a about a country singer being in the finals I watched and saw Scotty McCreery for the first time.  I couldn't believe the beautiful voice that seemed to be made to sing country music.  I couldn't wait for his first album to be released.  I never expected that it would be such an extraordinary album.  I grew up on country music and am a huge fan of it, especially the traditional as opposed to the contemporary style.  Scotty McCreery has a voice that is very reminiscent of Alan Jackson and I couldn't compliment him any higher than that...unless maybe to compare him to George Strait.  And, in fact, I like \\"Clear As Day\\" way more than Strait's new album, \\"Here for a Good Time\\".  I hope Scotty sticks to the more traditional form of country music instead of crossing over completely to the new stuff which sounds more like rock...I think of it as \\"bubble gum country\\".  The bottom line is that \\"Clear As Day\\" is a great album by a fantastic new talent.  I highly recommend it to everyone, whether you are traditionalist or contemporary when it comes to country music.
0345479092|2.0|I think this book needs to be taken with a grain of salt. I am by nature someone who is more likely to schedule a baby than to do attachment parenting, however, she just doesn't give enough information or advice on how to do this, especially in the sleep chapter. What if what she is suggesting doesn't work? What if something interrupts that all important nodding off period and the baby is startled? She says to begin the going to sleep process again. But what if it keeps happening over and over? My son always seems to have something happen when I lay him down: hiccups, reflux, a poopy diaper, gas, something and so I start the process over again, and then again, and then again, until he is so overtired he can't calm down until the next feeding time and he falls asleep at the breast (but I don't make him wait if he is hungry...which can mess up the schedule, which she doesn't address.) There is no advice for what to do when her method isn't working. She gives a one size fits all sort of method that doesn't address many problems. Like she says to use the pacifier to help soothe the baby but not to put it back in when baby spits it out. But what if the baby cant keep it in his mouth and keeps knocking it out with his hands before he is really done with it? Do I put it back in again? How many times and for how long? What if losing the pacifier is the thing that startles him awake but he still wants to suck and clearly isn't hungry? There are just so many things that can go wrong when following her advice and she doesn't address those situations at all.  I like that she doesn't guilt parents and makes bottle feeding parents feel validated however I think in her effort to validate them she swings too far and starts to put breastfeeding down. And I really don't like her condescending tone calling the reader \\"luv\\" and \\"duckie\\" when saying that what you thought is wrong.  It sounds so sensible and easy when reading the book but the actual application is messier and less straight forward. I'm sure it has worked great for some people and I don't think it is a bad method at all, but it just doesn't contain enough info for my situation.
B004VF68AQ|3.0|Mountain Song.  Summertime Rolls.  Been Caught Stealing.  Is anything on The Great Escape Artist breathing the same air as these landmark songs?  Predictably, no.  Even the most fierce Jane's defender has to admit as much.  What do those great songs have in common?  Superlative bass lines.  Bass lines that only one person can produce.<br /><br />There are some really good songs here.  But let all of us Jane's fans be honest with ourselves please.  5 stars?  Really?  The best Jane's music was produced at a very specific time in Los Angeles.  It was fueled by narcotics and mutual antipathy.  Those conditions cannot be reproduced.<br /><br />There is a reason that Eric Avery has refused to record new material with this band. I think this record is good for what it is, but I would rather they had recorded it using a different band name.
031237593X|5.0|Ricardians (members of the Richard III Society) will love this book.  People who loved Josephine Tey's book, The Daughter of Time (as in, Truth is the daughter of time) will also enjoy this.  There are few books out there who portray Richard III as anything other than the nephew-murdering King of England whose story was told by those who killed him and came after.  Needless to say, I fall into the Ricardian camp.  I am also an inveterate reader of historical novels of various time periods and places.  Penman's Sunne in Splendour -- her entry novel -- is truly splendiferous and an utterly enjoyable read.  There are the occasional  anachronistic words and phrases where she uses in the 1400's words or expressions that belong to the modern era, but overall the book is just wonderful--an engrossing read that is remarkably well crafted.  I envy anyone who has yet to discover this book for the first time....Enjoy!!!  And broaden your historical horizons a bit---remember that truth is the daughter of time and even after 500+ years it is important that the truth of an event come to the surface.  If you find a liking for Good King Dickon, try also Tey's book and Jeremy Potter's Good King Richard and A Trail of Blood.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|For those who really loves Star Wars......this is a mandatory pack that any CRAZY fun must have... it come with a super extra discs that will increase your Star War knowledge and experience!
B001UV4XJ2|1.0|The movie is great.  I gave this one star because of the digital copy. This is some new streaming digital copy and it is not compatible with iTunes or really anything else.  You will always need to be connected to the web to view the digital copy so it will count against your band width cap.  Read about UltraViolet before you spend the extra money, there is a single disk version. Save some money or at least know what you are buying.
B0034G4P8A|3.0|Although not the best superhero movie, this is an entertaining movie that moves along at a good pace. The video and audio quality are very good, nice movie to add to your collection.
B0041KKYGU|5.0|I'm pretty sure this is a love it or hate it movie. I loved it, because I love the grossly inappropriate humor in this movie. If you have that sense of humor, then this movie is for you. You won't like it if you are offended by drug and sex references. But you will if you enjoy sarcasm and can laugh at the drugs and sex.I love Elizabeth Halsey and I loved the woman who played Amy Squirrel. She was amazing.
B005WTR4ZI|5.0|I highly recommend this book as Erik Brynjolfsson and Andrew McAfee have made some excellent points on the effects of technology, digitization and how those advances have and will continue to impact our society.  I found the examples throughout the book excellent, and lead to even more questions such as...\\"Could inevitable technology enhancements actually lead to a diminishing of society as a whole?\\"<br /><br />This book is a must read for those who are looking to understand the role of technology within society, and for me it demonstrated that education is still the key to advancing a person's standing in the socioeconomic world.<br /><br />Truly a thought-provoking book!
0783225849|5.0|PSYCHO is Alfred Hitchcock's landmark masterpiece of the macabre stars Anthony Perkins as the troubled Norman Bates, whose old dark house and adjoining motel are not the place to spend a quiet evening. No one knows that better than Marion Crane (Janet Leigh), the ill-fated traveler whose journey ends in the notorious \\"shower scene.\\" First a private detective, then Marion's sister Lila(Vera Miles) searches for her, the horror and the suspense mount to a terrifying climax where the mysterious killer is finally revealed.<br /><br />For all the slasher pictures that have ripped off PSYCHO (and particularly its classic set piece, the \\"shower scene\\"), nothing has ever matched the impact of the real thing. More than just a first-rate shocker full of thrills and suspense, PSYCHO is also an engrossing character study in which director Alfred Hitchcock skillfully seduces you into identifying with the main characters--then pulls the rug (or the bathmat) out from under you. Anthony Perkins is unforgettable as Norman Bates, the infamous mama's boy proprietor of the Bates Motel; and so is Janet Leigh as Marion Crane, who makes an impulsive decision and becomes a fugitive from the law, hiding out at Norman's roadside inn for one fateful night.<br /><br />The success of this film jump-started Anthiny Perkins' career and PSYCHO was so overwhelming positive that it led to 4 Academy Award nominations which now also makes this terror flick one of Hitchcock's best films and owners enjoyed long lines of people waiting to see PSYCHO too when it was released in theaters back in the Summer of 1960 along with the fact that the astonishing sequel PSYCHO 2 was released in theatres 23 years later in the Summer of 1983 where Lila tries to get revenge on Norman for murdering her sister when he gets released from the crazy-house after 22 years.<br /><br />As a matter of fact, my mother was a teenager in high school when this phenomenal horror flick was released back in the Summer of 1960.
B0058VA2U4|5.0|Bought it, listened to it, loved it. I bought the previous Anthrax album, \\"We've Come For you All\\" (is that the right title? something like that..) unheard and listened to it maybe 4 times; I was not impressed. \\"Worship Music\\" has been in my car stereo for two weeks; I think it might be my new favorite Anthrax album (and I have them all, by the way, except \\"Fistful of Metal\\", which seems to have gotten lost somewhere). I only took it out to hear State of Euphoria again.<br /><br />So, um, go buy it right now. You won't be disappointed.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Not really a game for me, or so I thought. Could hundreds of 5* ratings be wrong? Nope. Beautiful design and music make the challenge of getting a perfect score less stressful :-) Runs flawlessly on EVO 4G. Get it...
B004J4WKTW|5.0|I thought this book was amazing. It was one of the best I've read in a long time.  I couldn't put it down, it was whimsical without being childish and the multiple plot lines left cliff hangers to cling to all over.  I have no children, but when I do this will definitely be something I'll be reading to them.  The descriptions are such that it'll leave them with fantastic dreams for your whole family to drift off with.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|Good god this book is amazing. Martin absolutely destroys me with his insane cliff hangers and loss of main characters. Definately a 5 star winner. i burned through this book im a week rocking out 200 pages a day probably more since i dont read on the weekends but man a definate must have for fans of the series
B005JCT4B0|5.0|Original Album Series collections are usually pretty good, sold for somewhere around a tenner and containing a fair few albums (housed separately in card sleeves, with one box to house those selves in) by artists with reasonably sized discographies such as Foghat, Kansas, Jefferson Airplane etc and now artists like Dream Theatre, Faith No More and Pantera.<br /><br />Pantera were one of the most important and influential metal bands of all time, they are one of the key figures in the groove metal subgenre and they helped \\"fly the flag of true metal\\" during the supposedly barren 1990s. They are responsible for countless metal artists ever since picking up an instrument and have written many of the genre's most recognizable songs.<br /><br />Pantera's inclusion in the Original Album Series is a pretty perfect collection as it manages to contain all of the band's official record label era full-length studio albums. The line up is: Cowboys From Hell, Vulgar Display Of Power, Far Beyond Driven, The Great Southern Trendkill and Reinventing The Steel.<br /><br />This means that this set contains every big Pantera song you have ever heard of, such as 'Cowboys From Hell,' 'Cemetery Gates,' 'Walk,' 'This Love,' 'I'm Broken,' 'Five Minutes Alone,' 'Drag The Waters,' 'Revolution Is My Name,' etc and so, if you know a bit of Pantera but aren't sure which album to spend your money on, this set will get you them all in one go.<br /><br />The Original Album Series sets do not contain any linear notes, fancy digipaks or bonus tracks, but do deliver the original studio albums which is good enough for a new fan or a quick replacement for your worn out copies. The only real official Pantera output that this set doesn't contain is their live album 101 Proof and the miscellaneous cover songs, remixes and live EPs that they have, as well as obviously not including anything from their unofficial Pre-Cowboys era.<br /><br />Overall; Pantera are essential listening for metal fans and this is a cheap and easy way to get the vast majority of their work, in a small and easy to store little box.their work, in a small and easy to store little box.
B000FCKGPC|4.0|I thought the same as many of you about the book being dull till i got to the review where a person explained that the lamd is currently devastated from the raiding and the utter dissolvement of any safety the people of westeros had. 4 & 5 are setting up a 6th that will probaly rival the 3rd which is clearly the best one. All i can say is that we have to be patient and there is supposed to be 12 books in this saga so maybe better things are to come. we arent even halfway done!
B003L77G6A|5.0|This was a good price on a hard to find movie.  Could not find it in stock in several stores.
B005GVW05Q|5.0|Ashes and Fire is full of beautiful, subtle, deep songs. Ryan's voice is incredible, vulnerable and lovelier than ever. It has the spark of genius found on Heartbreaker, but with a new wisdom that allows some room for the good things in life. Unlike Heartbreaker, it does lack some of the fun. There's nothing like Lucy. But this mellow, content, grown-up Ryan Adams is serious enough to be respected and joyful enough to soothe the spirit. I love it.
B005DI97S0|5.0|The book was no only in great condition it just happened to be a first edition. Will buy from again.
B0009P5YXO|4.0|This screwdriver sounds awesome, looks awesome, and is extremely fun; however, it is very cheap. If you are planning on purchasing this don't expect to use it a lot without breaking it.
B005ELZKWS|5.0|I very much enjoyed this CD,if you loved the first CD ,you will go crazy over this one. I can't stop jamming out to this one,play it loud folks!!
B00459EZSU|5.0|This series was awesome! It had everything (action, humor, drama, suspense).  It was well written, and had excellent speial effects.  It filled the void left by the end of BSG and I'm still disapointed it was cancelled.
B0055EAJ7A|5.0|I bought this because I want to have a good film to test when I get a 3D TV.<br />Great movie!
B0039PK058|5.0|This is arguably the best movie ever.  It is certainly ranked among the top SciFi films of all time, and it's by far the greatest Star Trek film of all time (no offense to J.J. Abrams).  I recommend watching \\"Space Seed\\" from Season 1 of the original series before sitting down for this one.  If you're not a Star Trek fan, this movie should have you hooked, or you can't claim to be a SciFi fan either.
B004LWZW4C|5.0|I actually started liking the characters and getting the feeling that the actors studied their post dated previous films. Great movie!
B005VMVUAQ|2.0|The story line? So so. The acting?? What? So very predictable. The ending? No way!! I was hoping for at least a good ending??!! But....Cage and Kidman didn't fit together. Total waste of time and money. :/
0312427999|5.0|What shocks you? Everything in this book may shock you. On the other hand you may already be numb from the Shock Doctrine we have seen coming from Wall Street, Congress, the Pentagon and the White House. This is not a new doctrine. maybe just more composed and certainly used more often than since the late 70's and 80's. This really could be called the Hit 'Em Hard, and Hit 'Em Again Before They Can Get Up, Doctrine.  It seems that some think good politics is when you leave no room for living, no room for breathing. For some individuals, politicians and organizations, everyday for them is Shock and Awe. They are handing it out and we are to take it. like I said, no room for breathing. Worth the read.
B0055SWM08|4.0|Based on this app's name and icon, I wouldn't have thought that it would be interesting.  Turns out this is a relaxing puzzle game, think labyrinth with a waterdrop as the ball.
B00005O3VD|5.0|I love Barbara Streisand, she is one of my favorites.  Her voice is amazing and the acting is great.  I strongly recommend this movie!
B0055V6EZE|5.0|Better than the PBS TV show.  My wife loved the CD as a gift! Who knew that a good comedian and serious actor was also a fine New Orleans style traditional blues pianist and singer.
1599218011|5.0|First off let me just say that this book has helped me to not only love myself but to fall in love with myself. I like many others have many health problems; i have researched many options on ways to help myself (anything that does not include meds) I have read many books on raw food/vegan etc. Before reading this book i had begun adopting a semi raw food/vegan plan but I always felt deprived, trying to look for a quick fix and just plain blah, then one day i was at Barnes and nobles and saw this book and thought why not(got on amazon it was cheaper). Kris has helped me to realize that eating right is only a small part of the battle, its all about the mind, make yourself feel sexy, know that you are a hot mama, take risks but most of all don't judge yourself if you fail. just get right back up again. Her book and website is amazing tons of information not only about food but about cleansing your life as well. Anybody who is looking for a good book on nutrition and a great book on becoming a sexy, fun, loving being this is for you. Health is just not what you put into your body buy also how you receive (events, thoughts, emotions) and give them out to yourself/world. GET THE BOOK, money well spent.
B004JN1D2I|5.0|These books are addicting!  You can't stop reading them!  You feel like you MUST know what is going on with each character.  The only down side to these books is that at some points it feels like there is TOO MUCH detail given.  Each book describes relationships between certain characters and scenery for areas, even if the book before had told you those same details.
B0058A119G|5.0|BARBRA STILL HAS IT- STAND OUTS INCLUDE SOMETHING NEW IN MY LIFE, SOLITARY MOON, NICE AND EASY, ALONE IN THE WORLD, I'LL NEVER SAY GOODBYE- HAVE BEEN A STREISAND FAN FOR ALMOST 40 YEARS- SHE SINGS WITH SUCH EMOTION AND UNDERSTANDING OF LYRICS
B004259BMM|4.0|I love this CD & Keith Urban, the only thing that could have been better is more songs.    I believe there are only 8 tracks on this CD, but still great!
B000O8OTNC|5.0|My wife and I live in a NYC apartment and there just isn't much room for extra equipment.  The only sharpener we've been using is the standard one that comes with a knife block.  Recently, I decided that just wasn't cutting it(neither were the knives) and we needed a new sharpener.  I wanted something small that we could keep out of the way in the kitchen cupboard that worked better than what we had.  The Smith PP1 Pocket Pal works superbly, better than many electronic sharpeners that I've tried.  After sharpening, our knives now slice tomatoes and onions effortlessly.  The sharpening process takes about 30 seconds.  We haven't tried the serrated sharpener attachment yet but I'm certain it will work as well.  I am now contemplating purchasing a few more to give as christmas presents.
B005DR64OQ|2.0|I love Nicole Kidman and Nicolas Cage, but this movie is awful.  I seem to remember a French movie that was VERY similar to this movie.....just about a year ago.  I wish I knew the name of the French film.  It's much, much better than this.

0736092269|5.0|This book is an excellent resource for anyone serious about strength training. Its illustrations are very helpful. It really helps you understand which muscles are being used during each exercise. It also gives good tips about technique, posture, and body types. It is also a good way to brush up on your human anatomy.
B0032FPVKE|3.0|I bought this to keep a Canon Digital Rebel in and it's too small.  This would be best suited for a camera without a removable lens.  The quality is great, though.  I loved the frustration-free packaging (but beware if sending as a gift! The label displays exactly what it is!) and the zippers and padding were great quality.  Just wish it were a little larger.
B003Y5H4SO|3.0|The producers of Devil pretty much took the idea from the 2007 movie \\"Blackout\\". I think that Blackout was better than Devil. Not saying Devil was dumb but Blackout is better.

B001NEK2GE|5.0|I love this thing. Having gamed for years with keyboards made me a little concerned thinking it would not feel as good but I was wrong. This thing is awesome, feels very good and comfortable, and it's by Logitech so you know you've got a quality product. Definitely recommend it to anyone who plays games on PC a lot. Also works very good with the XIM3 if you have one of these.
0446547654|1.0|****SPOILER***  Nicholas Sparks likes killing people with cancer (A Walk to Remember (Jamie), Dear John (her husband), The Best of me (her daughter, Bea, etc.) There are many other ways for people to die, he needs to think farther outside of the box. There are always violent characters trying to destroy the couples, he rarely writes ANY kind of happy ending, and if couples find happiness it never lasts too long. This book was too predictable, to depressing, and I really didn't like how Amanda was described as a strong woman. She was a coward. She stayed with a husband she never really loved in order to do the \\"noble\\" thing. She supposedly was honoring Dawson and his loyalty by never forgetting him but she stayed in her loveless marriage long after her weekend with Dawson. She loved Dawson so much but she went back to her boring alcoholic husband anyway. Their love was so passionate and strong but she didn't make love to him when they were at the cabin? And what does that say about her marriage to Frank? Yes, she describes it as passionless, but she still was unfaithful for even staying the night with Dawson, kissing him, laying naked with him, holding hands with him, and still being in love with him even 2 years after his death. She hoped their spirits would reconnect when she dies, NOT HER HUSBANDS! I thing everything about her is a sham and I see a coward. There is nothing strong about her besides she can hide her grief and true feelings from the rest of the world. She was exactly like her mother, the person she claimed she didn't understand. I felt like this was poorly written and I feel like I've read this exact story before.
B005IZLPKQ|4.0|Some of the special effects in this movie are incredible, some of the best I have ever seen. I was just stunned how good they were.    The actual filming is brilliant.   The story itself is sometimes a bit weak, still it is from comics so you cannot expect too much there. Whatever short coming in the story was more than made up by some good acting. I thought that everyone played very well.   Most entertaining, I would recommend it.
B001PPLIEG|2.0|The producers made a mistake casting Daniel Craig as Bond. I mean a BLONDE James Bond? Whatever happened to tall, DARK and handsome?  Perhaps, it is not Craig's fault but more the producers' and directors'. Craig's Bond is kind of a perfunctory action figure. There are plenty of kicks and punches but he is strangely cold and lifeless, just like someone who's had a lobotomy. The previous characterizations by Sean Connery, Roger Moore and Pierce Brosnan are full of British wit and humour to say the least.  Finally, there was a shot of Craig in the earlier movie rising out of the sea in square trunks ala Ursula Andress and Halle Berry. What are the producers trying to do? Capture a slice of the pink market? I mean, Bond is as straight as hell. Jane Bond anyone?

B0015I2P0Y|2.0|Let me start by saying I expect to hear it from devoted Elbow fans-- and there are a bunch out there-- about how I missed the boat on this, and maybe I did.  But on first listen, \\"The Seldom Seen Kid\\" was a record I just thought was kind of limp.  Somewhere in the post-Radiohead territory, Elbow is almost a prog rock through alternative filter, but what I found this left me with was limp balladry (opener \\"Starlings\\"), understated atmosphere pieces (\\"Mirrorball\\") and the sort of alternative pop that's made the '90s British bands never make sense to me (\\"Weather to Fly\\").  I grew up on progressive rock, and I've often heard Elbow compared to the bands I grew up with, but much as I tried, this one just didn't catch me in any way.

Now waiting for Kevin to go solo!!!
0374531269|5.0|This book is among the top 10 non-fiction books I've ever read. I only finish about 50% of the books I start. Unless it's really interesting I usually lose interest. This book, at 214 pages (roughly), I finished in two days. I just couldn't put it down. It was so clear and vivid in the way it was written - and so heart-wrenching and sad. Given the danger he faced, it's a miracle that the author is alive to tell the story, and he does it in such a masterful way.
030788743X|4.0|As a rule, I do not enjoy reading fiction.  When a friend recommended this book as 'written by the guy that did Fanboys', I thought I might break that rule...<br /><br />Just a few pages in, I was hooked. This story of an orphaned, rogue, '1337 hacker' really captured my imagination with its frequent exploration of an almost 'living internet' of the near future. Throw-in some high school romance, a rags-to-riches quest, fame, exploration, lampooning geek culture and a evil organization that you'll love to hate and you're left with a very fun read.<br /><br />I fear that the book may limit its audience to those born from 1970-1982 or so.  Many of the pop culture references come specifically from 80s geek culture (ie. Matthew Broderick, Joust, Oingo Boingo, etc.), and without that base knowledge, some of the fun may be missed. I'm currently testing that theory out by forcing my wife to read the book. Still, its a timeless story of young love and adventure with broad appeal tying the nerdy touch points together.

B004G6009U|5.0|First, a little background, to give some perspective as to what the Disney animators have achieved with this movie:  The brothers Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm, great XIX Century scholars of all things related to the German language, collected popular folk stories, refined them, removing blatant inconsistencies to make them easier to understand, eliminating obviously non-Christian and sexual elements, and began publishing their monumental collection of \\"Children and House Fairy Tales\\" in 1812. In the end it consisted of nearly 300 tales, including \\"Red Riding Hood\\", \\"Cinderella\\", \\"Snow White\\", \\"Puss in Boots\\", ... and \\"Rapunzel\\".  My paternal grandmother used to read me fairy tales at bedtime, or when I was sick in bed, which was often. So she read me \\"Rapunzel\\". All that I remember of her reading was that a girl with very long hair was locked up by a witch in an isolated tower and used her hair as a rope to lift, with the help of a pulley, the witch. One day a prince happened by, saw her lifting the witch into the tower, fell in love on sight with the hairy maiden, and somehow they ended up married, and lived happily ever after.  The actual story was only memorable to me because of the maiden's very long hair (more than 20 yards) and its use as an elevator, as well as the witch's call: \\"Rapunzel, Rapunzel, let your hair down\\".  The story itself is, briefly, thus: A poor couple is expecting a child. The pregnant mother craves some rapunzel lettuce from their neighbor's garden. The neighbor is an unfriendly witch. The husband climbs her garden's wall, steals lettuce. The wife craves some more. At his second attempt, the witch catches him in the act. They make a deal: her lettuce for their child, when it is born. The child is a girl, they call her \\"Rapunzel\\"; the witch takes her away promising to treat her as her own daughter, which she does, but then locks her up in a room atop a tower once she reaches puberty. A handsome prince happens by, sees her, falls in love, watchesin hiding and so figures out how to get in via her hair. The witch, after many a visit by the prince to the little room atop the tower, finds out. When the prince shows up, she confronts him and he jumps out the window. Lands on some briers and the thorns pierce his eyes. He is left to wander in despair for years, while the witch takes Rapunzel, who is now pregnant, to an undisclosed location, far, far away. One day the blind prince stumbles on Rapunzel's hideout, they recognize each other, she cries for joy and her tears restore his sight. They, and their twins, a boy and a girl, go together to the prince's kingdom, where there is great rejoicing, and they live \\"happily for a long time afterwards.\\"  Now, about the movie:  The tale told in the movie is a very different story: the prince is here a charming rogue, a fugitive of justice, the hair is not just very long, but magical, with life-prolonging and healing properties, and glows when certain incantation is sang. Rapunzel is a princess, and she was kidnapped by the witch, not given to her. Also, she does not get pregnant (she has no occasion, what with all the action). And the story is so changed that now it has also poetic touches and flights of imagination that the Grimm brothers conscientiously avoided. But that was because their purpose was a scholarly one. The creators of the movie worked under no such constraints, and set out to make a swan out of an interesting but rather drab duckling. They succeeded, producing another memorable Disney film. First of all, this is the best CGI animation I remember ever seeing (if only, alas!, in 2-D). The figures are fully animated, with skins that look warm and soft, not plastic-like, as in many otherwise good CGI animation films. The all-important hair truly flows and moves naturally and credibly (and it is moved a lot, being an essential participant in the action), it also looks and feels \\"as fine as spun gold\\" in the words of the original tale.  But there is more herethan great technical achievement. There is also sparkling dialog (by some excellent voice actors), some serviceable songs that, at worst, do not get in the way. And very importantly: no cute talking animals, or even remarkable ones -- with one exception.   Finally, there are two sequences that, in my opinion, must rank among the best ever in animation history: a dance started spontaneously by Rapunzel, in one of the squares of the kingdom's capital, that then grows and grows in excitement until the dancers reach the point of wild abandon; and the scene in the boat, just after sunset, during the launching of the lanterns that slowly lift into the air, forming a floating, golden constellation, and about which others have already commented with obvious, and deserved, admiration. During these sequences the movie is not only a technical triumph, but also becomes memorable cinematography. With them, it does touch the heart, filling it with enchantment and awe, as only true art can do.  And then there is \\"Maximus\\", the horse. Here is a character that, if there was any justice, should have gotten the \\"best supporting actor\\" Oscar in the 2010 Academy Awards.  It is both a truly horsey and truly intelligent (if non-speaking) individual with lots of attitude.  I rarely watch a movie more than once. Because of circumstances beyond my control, I have seen \\"Rapunzel\\" three times already (always in 2-D), and every time it has been a real pleasure to watch.  I firmly believe that this is a movie that will long be remembered for: wondrous animated hair, engaging characters, the two superb sequences already mentioned, and, last but not least, for Maximus, the horse.
0061784788|5.0|I have read several prior books by James Rollins and he is now an author that I look for on the new release charts.  His books seem to have a scientific and religious theme to them and The Devil Colony is no exception.  However, instead of Catholic themes this story evolved around Mormon ideas which was something new and fresh for me.  I found the story to be exciting and the descriptions used had me wanting to discover more information so I did some internet research and discussed with a Mormon friends to see how off base the ideas were.  Clearly the ideas in the book were far fetched but they did make for a really good read.<br /><br />If you are looking for a book that blends fact and fiction together to make a believable story I think you will like the Devil Colony
B005G4TJI4|2.0|I mean, 2.5 hours? Really? The story line is so simple, this could easily have been a taut 90 mins and we all would have been a lot happier. I actually have not seen the first two in this series, so this only starts to make some limited sense after a long while. Anyone should be able to watch, though, and get it, thus the editing here needed more work. The absurdly plumped up lips of the girlfriend continuously transfixed me, way more than the silly transformer action fight sequences. Speaking of which, that is where all the fat is here. The fighting could have been seriously cut and no one would have complained except maybe the kids who made this comic book movie. Is anyone surprised to learn that the bad guys/good guys theme ends with the good guys in charge, yet again?

B002U3CCKQ|5.0|I really loved this book. I finished it today, and I feel orphan... I want more!<br /><br />I'm not going to get too much into the plot (which is absolutely terrific!), since other reviewers have already done that, and I believe it's better for you to read this book not knowing what is going to happen. I will just say that the characters are amazing. I haven't read about people so well drawn that come out of the pages in a while...<br /><br />I deeply care about not-that-enjoyable characters. You know, the problematic ones, those that proclaimed themselves as bad people, like Libby Day does. And she is so twisted, you end up loving her. Her whole family is like this.. There's something really disturbing about how much one may get attached to the Days, giving the way they are - but that's exactly what happens, and it's all to Gillian Flynn's credit.<br /><br />Gillian Flynn's style has a good resemblance to Karin Slaughter's. This, by itself is enough to tell you how good the book is. If you've ever read anything from Karin Slaughter and liked it (what's there not to like on Karin Slaughter's books, by the way...??) you're going to love Dark Places.<br /><br />The moment I finished this book I bought Sharp Objects, her first book. Can't wait to read more from her...

B005GVW05Q|5.0|Yes,  it is a departure, but an equal, or as good as, departure from previous albums.  I have loved all of Ryan's different music incarnations (except maybe Orion b/c I don't listen to metal) and he is actually about the only artist that has kept my interest. All my musical tastes are fulfilled by one person.  Ashes and Fire (like most of his music) gets better with each listen.  At first you might think hmmm... kind of slow,then next thing you know you can't get the song out of your head, that is how I felt about \\"Save Me\\" and now it is one of my favorites.  I highly recommend listening to this while taking a walk outside or sitting around a fire. Excellent choice to have this released in the Fall too.  I highly recommend this album and if you are new to Ryan Adams, check out his back catalog and enjoy the ride.
0374532990|5.0|I considered myself to be in-the-know on the history and creation of The High Line, after 13 years of living in Manhattan and reading endless press in Time Out NY, New York Mag and The NY'er.  Now that I've finished reading \\"The Inside Story of New York City's Park in the Sky\\", I realize how little of this remarkable story I actually knew.  We are so often promised \\"behind the scenes\\" glimpses into famous people and pop-culture storylines yet are left disappointed by lackluster revelations and glossier-than-actual trips down memory lane.  I found this book to be a brutally honest tale of two regular guys who lacked experience, resources and time yet somehow managed to keep their partnership and dream alive in spite of repeated challenges, fights and, what seems like, an entire city of naysayers.<br />In addition to sharing a great story in candid, often hilarious voices, the photos in the back half of the book are worth the $19 price tag alone.  I suspect the next time I walk along The High Line, I'll recognize it even more as the greatest gift to New Yorkers, and all Americans, since the Statue of Liberty.

You cannot watch this on your iPad or iPhone without an internet connection and installing the Flixster app.  The movie itself made good use of 3D effects, but suffered from a common problem of trying to stuff a universe of comic book awesomeness into a limited time.
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|KIki & Jules Ratings:  5+ Stars<br /><br />  A Discovery of Witches was released to Kindle on February 8th and we jumped right on board purchasing our copies February 12th. So, needless to say this review is long overdue. It has been difficult for us to come up with the right words to do this book justice. This book is intellectually and beautifully written.  It is rich with culture, science, and history, wrapped in passion, love, and of course...magic!  The imagery set forth by Deborah Harkness is so vivid it will awaken all of your senses, and you won't have to be a Clairmont to feel it. From cover to cover, we laughed, cried, gasped, and loved every minute. Very few books have us burning our cell phones up with texts and calls as this one did.  We have read, re-read, and will absolutely re-read this book again, and again. How many books can you do this with, may I ask??<br /><br />  Diana Bishop is an intellectual scholar teaching alchemy at prestigious Oxford, but more so she is writing a paper on the alchemical marriage.  One day while doing research at the famous Bodleian Library Diana requests a manuscript, Ashmole 782.  She senses instantly that this is no normal alchemy manuscript, but filled with magic.  See, Diana is a witch from a long line of witches dating back to Salem.  The only problem is that Diana does not want to be known as a witch nor does she even want to practice magic.  So when Ashmole 782 oozes magic Diana wants nothing to do with it and returns it to the stacks.  What Diana soon finds out is that Ashmole 782, until she called it from the stacks, was missing.  And every creature, from witches to demons to vampires would kill to get their hands on it.  The only problem is that even if they could call forth the manuscript they wouldn't get past the spell on it, but Diana could do both.  Now this witch, who doesn't even want to do magic, is the most popular being at Bodleian.<br /><br />  One of the first people's attention she catches is that of geneticist professor, and vampire, Matthew Clairmont.  As Matthew sets forth to convince Diana to give him the manuscript he discovers something more in her.  Even though she claims to have nothing to do with magic, she glows with the power of it.  But it appears to Matthew that she has no real control of this power, and when pushed it makes her ill.  So he soon finds himself using his primal instincts and protecting her.  As every creature comes through the Bodleian walls the welfare of Diana Bishop is at risk.  Every minute Matthew spends protecting her, the less he thinks about the manuscript and the more he thinks about loving her.<br /><br />This book takes you from the campus of Oxford, to Matthew's home in France, and back to Diana's home in upstate New York. You discover many of the secrets of Ashmole 782, then you discover some more.  All along the way you watch the relationship of Matthew and Diana grow.  You get lost in their rich pasts and get wrapped up in all the possibilities of their future.  And at the end you will be begging for more.  Five stars is never enough for this first installment in the All Souls trilogy. While Deborah Harkness travels the globe introducing all to ADOW, we impatiently wait for Shadow of Night, the second installment in the series, which is due out in the summer of 2012.  Oh well, I'm sure somewhere in the mean time, we will find ourselves getting lost in this story all over again!!<br /><br />Happy Reading<br /><br />~Kiki & Julesvampire, Matthew Clairmont.

B005LJK3AC|5.0|If you enjoy the TV show It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia or the Hangover, you'll love this movie.  The cast was great and the chemistry between these guys was phenomenal. Please don't watch the movie if you're extremely religious or lack a sense of humor because you'll end up writing a review like some of the others who focused on Jennifer Aniston's haircut, which is sad. This is a raunchy in your face comedy and should be appreciated as such.
B0058VW36U|3.0|The game itself is beautiful and the gravity works great. My problem with this game is that it is way too easy. With each box (level pack) they add a new twist, which is nice, and I don't have any idea how they could make it harder, but it is really, really easy to get 3* on each level.
B005WWBP1O|5.0|I read this first in junior high school, than many times since. Very impacting the first time, and even more so each time after. Would recommend getting on your Kindle and reading free, seeing as it is a classic.
B005HXGE9G|4.0|Well, I guess I will add my two cents although it is not that different from many other reviews. I really like the way the songs were deconstructed, re-arranged by John Metcalfe, and then new vocals laid over the orchestra by Peter. This presents a new take on many of these songs, some more than others. I also like the way he avoided using any of his \\"hits\\" because to do that would be much more cliché. (Solsbury Hill is probably only a \\"hit\\" to his fans. It never received the air play of songs such as  \\"Shock the Monkey\\", \\"Sledgehammer\\", or \\"Steam\\".) Some may think this CD is a \\"cop out\\", saying it is easier to re-release the old stuff rather than coming up with new material. When I look at the amount of effort that went into the project and the song choice I do not feel that way. He purposely avoided his more popular songs. Nor do I feel that there was a \\"hit and miss\\" on the reworking on the songs. I find them all enjoyable with some just being more true to the original song and others being almost a completely different take on the song.  To me, this makes the overall project more appealing as it forces me, as a listener, to think outside of the box. Not all songs may appeal to all listeners. So? Why should they? Odds are, if somebody likes all of them then someone else will dislike all of them.  Peter's voice is amazingly strong after all of these years. I cannot believe he can still hit the high notes! Besides maybe a lower timbre that comes with age, I can detect no diminishment in his voice. I recommend this CD on its overall merits as a project well done and a concept (that although has been by others) that was executed very well.

0062011847|4.0|If you look at the books he's written since being diagnosed with alzheimer's, it may occur to you that we're witnessing a trend. Storylines are being closed, and it looks in general as though the Discworld series is coming to an end. The impression I get is of an author trying to leave no loose ends. This could definitely explain some of the darker tones, especially in I Shall Wear Midnight as well as in Snuff. Also remember the brief update we got on Rincewind in Unseen Academicals, this could easily be another level of closure for us.  If you read this book and simply compare it to other discworld novels, you may not be entirely satisfied. If you decide to read it as an insight as to what's happening when a great mind sees the end of his ability to write approaching, and wants to ensure that his fans aren't left hanging, you will likely take away a completely different opinion of the book.  I myself enjoyed the story, and the evolution of the characters makes sense to me, when you consider this book takes place 6 years after Thud!.  The bottom line is that I would recommend this book, while communicating the above take on it to any Pratchett fan. To anyone new to the series, I would recommend they start with an earlier novel.

He's tried to keep his head down, learning coin tricks and cell block aphorisms from his low-key cell mate.  And then the world he's been reaching out for shatters.  Summoned to the warden's office, Shadow learns that his wife has been killed in a car wreck and he will be released early to attend her funeral.  He subsequently learns that he has also lost his best friend, his prospects for a job, his illusions about his marriage and any reason to stay in an empty house in his little town.<br /><br />Shadow accepts an offer from Mr. Wednesday, seemingly encountered by chance on an airplane.  He will be Wednesday's chauffer, bodyguard and... something like a straight man.  As they travel through small-town America, Shadow--and the readers--figure out that his employer and those he meets with are more than quirky human beings.  They are gods created and sustained by human belief.  The gods now face a crisis.  As Americans forget about them, they begin to fade away.  Already too many are gone.<br /><br />Wednesday tries to do something about this crisis while Shadow plays a strange and increasingly central role in his plans.  We meet several gods and see signs of their waning influence in an America that has turned its attention to television, technology, and more modern diversions.  Guiman paints the gods large, with expansive personalities, diverse powers, and astonishingly short attention plans.<br /><br />The gods' need for human belief creates a fascinating world where nearly everything important happens behind the scenes.  The slow development of Shadow as a more engaged human being and perhaps something more, is a well-woven plot element.  As we follow him, we ponder mysteries in plain sight that others overlook.  Why are roadside tourist attractions places of mythic power?  What goes unexplained in the small places that draw back from the outside world?  There are answers.<br /><br />Neil Gaiman's story is imaginative, pleasant to read, and captures something of what seems definitively American to a transplanted British author.  It is recommended.  Appreciative readers may enjoy Shadow's further development in [[ASIN:B000FCKENQ Anansi Boys]].s.

0066620996|5.0|I just completed the audio book and found it to be great. I agree with comments in the other reviews, and I am not 100% convinced that the research methods were perfect and  I agree that the author provides personal opinions throughout, even though he claims that all of the research is data based. However, it raises some really interesting points for consideration. And the points seem to make sense to those of us who have worked in large companies and whom have also lived through the dot com boom and bust.   The audio book is narrated by the author and his voice sounds a bit arrogant, but he is very energetic and passionate about the material so I don't mind the arrogance. I strongly recommend the audio book, especially if you are a corporate commuter.

0439023513|1.0|After spending three days doing almost nothing but reading this trilogy, I am completely disappointed in the ending.  It's as if Suzanne Collins was on a slash and burn campaign to destroy every character that we had grown to love.  To top that off, I'm somewhat convinced that she designed her ending with her first priority being maximum shock value.  Obviously, war is ugly, but if I wanted to only feel the brutality of it I'd be watching the news, or reading non-fiction.  **(spoiler alert)**  In the end Katniss is a copy of her comotose mother that her true fiery self so resented in the first book, and ultimately, and you can't help but realize that her personal sacrifice was for nothing since her poor sweet sister just got killed off horrificly with her family watching anyway.  To me, the trilogy was simply ruined when it had true potential for awesomeness.
B003L20IJW|1.0|if you just want a mindless flick to keep amuse little children, this flick is suitable as light fluffy forgettable kiddie fare. I give it 1 star because thats about all it rates after the superb first film which is so so much more than just a dumb kiddie movie.
0439023521|3.0|This book is awesome.  I've got no complaints- I was hooked from the get go.  But, consider yourself warned; when you finish the trilogy, after investing all that time and emotional energy, you will be heartbroken and wonder if it was all worth it.
0142419400|5.0|Dear Stephanie Perkins, can we be friends? Please??<br /><br />No? No worries, it's cool. I'll just be here. Weeping silently on my copy of your book.<br /><br />*sniffles*<br /><br />I'll make this short because I don't want to give anything away.<br /><br />This book was recommended by a lovely Australian girl I met at an event at Books of Wonder here in NYC. She didn't tell me what the book was about, only that I had to read it. The mystery behind her recommendation made for a really great reading experience. So, I am going to share that with you...<br /><br />I read Anna and the French Kiss within twenty-four hours. I was hooked on page one and cracking up by page two.<br /><br />True story.<br /><br />I even catch myself daydreaming about Paris, where the majority of the book takes place. Here's the thing: I've been there twice, and I loved the city, but I feel like I need to go back and experience the sights as Stephanie described them. I feel like I missed out on something special. Or maybe her writing is so special it makes even the most common tourist destination sound like a world of rare enchantment. Does that make sense? Was that too much for you?<br /><br />Honestly, I just can't stop thinking about this book, especially the characters. They came to life so easily in my head because they were flawed and imperfect (as they should be). Stephanie didn't create typical or predictable relationships either and, sadly, we just don't see enough of that.<br /><br />*le sigh*<br /><br />My words can never describe just how fantastic this book is. Just go buy it.<br /><br />I'll leave you with one word, though: Ettiene. *swoons*<br /><br />Side Note: I am really looking forward to reading Perkins' follow-up novel, Lola and The Boy Next Door (September 2011).<br /><br />**Follow Me on: growingupya.blogspot.com**
0393064476|5.0|In the early 15th century Western Europe was just emerging from a couple of centuries of plague, famine, and conflict.  Led by the city states of northern Italy, the Europeans were attempting to find their footing, and to do so they looked back 1500 years or more to the classical civilizations of Greece and Rome.  Scholarly humanists began to search out and restudy old scrolls and ancient manuscripts in order to relearn much of what had been lost during the Dark Ages.  Of these none was more important than Poggio Bracciolini, a papal secretary whose Pope had been overthrown and replaced, and who dealt with his loss of power and income by searching monasteries in Germany and Switzerland for forgotten scripts.  His greatest discovery was Lucretius' long poem On The Nature Of Things, which he copied and had distributed, ensuring that it became a seminal document of the emerging Renaissance.<br /><br />Lucretius had been a Epicurean philosopher during the Roman Empire, who taught that the soul did not survive death and that all living things were made up tiny particles or atomi. Epicureans called on people to enjoy a good life (not a hedonistic one as is often supposed) without worrying about the wrath of God or the gods, who did not concern themselves with anything so insignificant as human affairs.  This has a modern ring to us, as it should since Lucretius' writings, as Stephen Greenblatt so ably shows, helped to shape the Renaissance and the Scientific Revolution.  Lucretius' ideas were unwelcome to many in the Church hierarchy, and those who followed his ideas were often in danger of perseuction or even execution.<br /><br />Stephen Greenblatt has produced a fascinating chronicle of Lucretius, Poggio, and the worlds they inhabited.  Much of the book is concerned with Poggio's life and times, which were very long for the period and rich and full of incident.  There is also much excellent material on the tumultuous political world the Church and secular powers struggled to dominate, as well as some fascinating discussion on how Lucretius probably came to create his poem and on how its rediscovery and publication influenced the world, whose development turned or \\"swerved\\" dramatically as a result of Lucretius and other classical writers renewed popularity.<br /><br />The Swerve should become an essential part of the library of anyone interested in the late medieval and early Renaissance eras.led to dominate, as well as some fascinating discussion on how Lucretius probably came to create his poem and on how its rediscovery and publication influenced the world, whose development turned or \\"swerved\\" dramatically as a result of Lucretius and other classical writers renewed popularity.<br /><br />The Swerve should become an essential part of the library of anyone interested in the late medieval and early Renaissance eras.

Each song is perfectly written and performed. If you love his songs like Damn Sam, La Cienega Just Smiled, Come Pick Me Up, you won't be disappointed.  He really is Brilliant! This is the side of Ryan that first made me notice him. Of course, he's a natural as a rock and roller and he is at the top on my list, but this more mellow side is what I love about his music.

B005COO1X6|3.0|Most Stephen King novels  really \\"grabbed me\\" and made me hate to put the book down. This one just didn't do that for me. Of course, they all can't be his \\"Best book\\" but this story was not the caliber I was used to from Mr. King. If it wasn't for his name being on it, I wouldn't think that it was written by him.
0439023483|5.0|You simply will NOT be able to put this book down- no matter how hard  you try. It is simply phenomenal. Just so riveting.
B004FGMDOQ|4.0|The photos are very important to the story, and as some other reviewers mentioned some may not be as easy to see on a Kindle. I didn't really have a problem with it. If I had felt it necessary, I could have just checked the pictures out using Kindle for PC or iPad. The photographs in the book are a great addition to the writing, but seeing them in high definition is not imperative to enjoying the story.<br /><br />Although this book has certain elements of horror or science fiction, and some scary images are described, in many ways it is a lot less dark than many of the more popular middle grade and young adult novels available. The protagonist is high school aged, but I think the story is easily accessible to middle schoolers as well.<br /><br />All in all it was a quick and fun read with a very interesting cast of supporting characters and the world of the book is very consistent.
0810989956|5.0|I LOVE that this book is about interaction.. I will be giving it to my nephew for xmas and can not wait for him and his Daddy to be able to fill it out together
0817439390|5.0|After looking through countless books, forums and internet videos for information on how to better understand and use my camera I came across this book.. As always (due to constantly stumbling upon books and info that either over-complicates or leaves you hanging with with only half developed thoughts and articles) I was hesitant (again) despite reading all of the excellent reviews..If you find yourself in this same position please do not hesitate to purchase this book.. It was an excellent and extremely insightful book from start to finish. The information was clearly laid out and easy to understand with tons of excellent examples to help further cement the ideas into your head. I'm not going to go into detail about each chapter because there were several reviews before this that I feel already laid them out nicely.. But, each chapter is loaded with great information and not only helpful but inspiring pictures. Also it should be said that this book isn't just limited to the absolute beginner or amateur I feel it would be more than helpful from novice to advanced (possibly helping the advanced fill some holes in their shooting technique or with the extremely helpful section on Metering)and of course Peterson is more than just some guy spewing out photo knowledge he is a teacher and a fantastic on at that. Every bit of this book was excellent and I would have gladly paid even more than I did for it..So whether you are an absolute beginner/amateur (to whom I would suggest this book as an absolute must if you plan on going anywhere with photography) or  the advanced I highly recommend this book all across the board :)

1596680296|5.0|I got this book a few weeks ago, primarily to supplement another book I'd gotten that left out some critical information for beginners.  I found now that this is the only book I'm using to learn more about socks.  I'm finishing up my 2nd sock of my 2nd pair of socks, and this book even makes the dreaded Kitchener stitch understandable!  Excellent photos and diagrams.  As noted by other reviewers, this book is primarily aimed at double point needle (DPN) users, not so much towards circular needle users.  I just got a couple of circs, though, and I'm going to try it out to see if theres enough of the instructions of it to help me figure out the circular needles.  Not too worried about that, though, because I just purchased Socks a la carte, mainly because its focus is on circular needles.  This book covers basic information very well for those of us that are not accustomed to knitting in the round; little things like joining the stitches to work in the round after you've divided your cast on stitches among the needles.  It offers alot of flexible patterns that are easy to make your own by just changing a few things with the cuff or the leg.  All in all, an excellent beginner sock knitting book!
B0051T47NQ|3.0|I can't understand they hype this film has received. I found it boring and lacking in plot. The special effects are fairly good, what there are of them (not much). There are supposedly several types of trolls, but viewers get to see only 2 types briefly. The filming pretty good quality, but there is little suspense as you know this is supposed to be found footage, thus the viewer knows from the start that the film crew didn't survive the super fast and confused attack at the end of the film.  I thought it was a fun idea to use the troll concept, but the idea was wasted. Most of the film is trying to locate living trolls, chasing the clues, and then there are the quick moments during which we actually see a troll. The CGI is good but goes by too quickly to enjoy. Rent this one.

The Blu Ray Disc is absolutely worth the upgrade. Colours pop, detail is fantastic. Don't expect Oscar performances from the cast,you wont get it, but they look like they are enjoying the romp. The film just gets better and better with repeat viewings. For me 10 out of 10. Buy it, [you know you want to]

B004BLTNL6|5.0|They left out the part at the beginning when the lady goes to the grocery store and sees Matthew working there. She orders her groceries then asks Matthew to deliver them to her house. In this movie, the first time we see Matthew is when he rings the doorbell and she opens the door and he's standing there with a grocery sack in each arm. I know this sounds insignificant to the story but i always hate it when they remove parts of a movie.....the one thing about this bluray that amazes me is the TRANSFER...its unbelievable....there are no scratches or blemishes in the movie at all....its as if the original master tape was put in an air-tight vault back in the 70s and has never been touched since...i did NOT expect that when i bought this movie....i have blurays of movies from the 80s and 90s that look kinda &#34;grainy&#34;...not so with this movie....either the master tape has been handled delicately over the years, or someone actually took the time and trouble to go frame by frame and remove whatever blemishes were there....i know they do that with some huge blockbuster movies like Gone With The Wind or The Wizard of Oz but i never would have expected it with this movie, just because of the nature of the film.... So hats off to whoever is responsible for this bluray transfer......ALL blurays should be treated this way.....
B005FUTBV4|4.0|Kevin Smith loves to make movies that alienate people; it's just his thing.  His horror/thriller RED STATE isn't quite as potentially-infuriating as DOGMA, perhaps, but it's certainly right up there.  The premise is simple: three teens seek sex from a woman who turns out to be the daughter of a Christian fanatic who has taken his religion to extremes.  His family cult kills homosexuals, and even though the three teens don't fit the profile, they're close enough for government work.  Speaking of which, the A.T.F shows up, and a Wacco-esque standoff ensues.  Add in an epilogue worthy of the Coen Brothers, and some wise-cracking that is decidedly Smith's own, and you have an entertaining thriller.<br /><br />The thing is, religion isn't Smith's target.  Yes, Abin Cooper (a superb Michael Parks) and his daughter (Melissa Leo, not quite getting to shine) are religious in the extreme; but the three teens (among whom Michael Angarano stands out) aren't exactly likable either, driven more by their hormones than anything else.  On the A.T.F.'s side, we have a morally-confused agent in the form of John Goodman, following orders but not entirely happy about it.  None of these characters is entirely likeable (Goodman remains the most sympathetic), but they aren't supposed to be.  Smith is exploring humanity's desire for blind belief: in God, in sex, in politics, and every combination thereof.  He even divides his cast, in the end credits, into those categories.  He condemns, bloodily so, but that doesn't mean he's happy about it.<br /><br />Parks and Goodman are phenomenal; whatever your political/social views, watch the film for their performances.  The supporting cast is solid; look for a great Stephen Root as the local sheriff, and Kevin Pollak as another A.T.F. agent.  The dialogue flows smoothly, and the action is actually pretty cool; Smith knows how to show someone getting shot.  The film is admittedly a bit didactic, but that's part of its charm: it's nice to see a filmmaker not hedging his bets, and instead giving us exactly what's on his mind.  Make no mistake about RED STATE: Kevin Smith isn't setting his sights merely on religious fanatics.  He has all of us, to some extent or other, in his cross hairs.s bets, and instead giving us exactly what's on his mind.

B003V1WTMM|5.0|This is the second book I've read by Kate Morton and I wasn't disappointed! Similar to The Forgotten Garden, she weaves a story from the past into the present.<br /><br />Edie is a young woman who's childhood love of reading was sparked by The Mud Man. When she's able to unexpectedly visit the castle where The Mud Man's author lived, she is delighted with the opportunity. But we've already learned that her mother spent time in the castle as a child during the war, and has a strange and complicated past with the castle's inhabitants, the mysterious Blythe sisters.<br /><br />The story moves quickly, alternating between the past - when Edie's mother Meredith was a resident in the castle and the happenings of the sisters during that time, to present day, where Edie's relationship with her mother is tenuous at best and she's drawn further into the mystery of the Blythe sisters - what caused young Juniper to lose her mind? Why have Percy and Saffy never left? What happened to Juniper's finance and what are the true origins of The Mud Man?<br /><br />Each chapter reveals a little more, the story growing and changing before your eyes, surprising you (or at least me!) with every revelation.<br /><br />I tore through this book, reluctant every time I had to put it aside. An excellent read that is entertaining and engrossing. Highly recommended. =)

It's an excellent port of an excellent game, and although the file size is gigantic, it moves to the SD card, so anyone running 2.2 or higher can enjoy it.
B0057AOOZ0|2.0|I'm not a beyonce hater nor really a fan.  I do have a few songs on my ipod from Beyonce that I listen to and for the most part I think she is very entertaining and fun to watch.  However, I honestly didn't feel this album really stood out in any major way.  There isn't any ground breaking cuts at all. I listened several times to her album and left rather unimpressed.    I think what the problem was for me is that I made the mistake of listening to the ArchAndroid before I listened to Beyonce's 4.  On a creative level the ArchAndroid blew 4 out of the water.  My impression of Beyonce's 4 overall was that it came off as easy listening and definitely more mature than previous albums, but very ordinary. There really wasn't anything in 4 that hasn't been done before and I would be bold enough to say done better by other artist past, present, and future.    Compartively speaking,  Monet comes off as an artist who's work is unlike anything I've heard in a very long time. I think of past albums that stand the test of time would be Stevie Wonder's \\"Songs in the Key of Life\\", \\"Talking Book\\", Roy Ayres \\"Running Away\\".  Monet has the potential of being like these artist in which her work can hold up for years to come.  Beyonce albeit very talented, really is more of an entertainer and trend setter than a ground breaker.  She's fun, sexy, and definitely packs a crowd, but groundbreaking creative genius she is not.

1439192812|3.0|Previously, I have reviewed \\"The God Delusion\\" and found it incredibly lacking. The reason some found it convincing was that they were unfamiliar with the arguments and thought that Dawkins knew them well. He doesn't. Of course, one can look at my review to see my reply to his \\"arguments.\\" The Magic of Reality does not have anything new in argumentation.<br /><br />Nevertheless, I consider it the most dangerous book that he's written.<br /><br />Remember that earlier Richard Dawkins has said we shouldn't \\"indoctrinate\\" our children?<br /><br />Apparently, the new atheists get a free pass.<br /><br />\\"The Magic of Reality\\" is a book that could easily be a textbook and is recommended for young people who are Dawkins's main targets. Dawkins is in this book a brilliant writer. One can easily imagine hearing his voice as one reads it as Dawkins is a good speaker and a good writer generally. For instance, while I did not believe The Blind Watchmaker, I did think Dawkins made an argument that was much more persuasive than The God Delusion. (Okay. That might not be saying much.) I think there were basic flaws in the arguments, but it was a well-written and well thought-out argument.<br /><br />For this book, there is not the ranting going of The God Delusion, but I could not help but be reminded of The Green Book as talked about in C.S. Lewis's book \\"The Abolition of Man.\\" In that case, a book on another subject was also being used to teach children philosophy and a child could go to do his lesson not learning much about grammar, but learning much about philosophy and already is a casualty in a war he had no idea was going on.<br /><br />My concern with this book is that The God Delusion was written for adults to persuade them to be atheists. This one is written for children before they start grappling with the big issues to teach them to be atheists in their thinking in advance. This is preparation for an atheistic worldview.<br /><br />There's no doubt that much of the science in this book is very good and very fascinating. I found several parts simply remarkable and I would not deny learning much about science from reading this book. Unfortunately, I also learned much about Dawkins and also with the realization that while he goes to great lengths to make sure that he's speaking accurately about science and can admit when he's out of his expertise in a scientific area, he does not grant the same courtesy to religion. Dawkins is not an expert in theology, textual criticism, historical evidence, or philosophy of religion, but yet he speaks about them anyway.<br /><br />It is my stance as a Christian that I will not comment on the scientific aspects of this work except as a layman. I do not claim to be an authority on science and I do not believe that Christians who are not trained in the science should comment on the sciences. Instead, we are to leave that to the scientists. We can evaluate arguments to an extent, but to do it effectively, we need to be reading in the relevant areas.<br /><br />Dawkins would probably agree that Christians who do not know about science should not argue over it and should not used arguments along the lines of \\"If we came from monkeys why are there still monkeys?\\" However, Dawkins would not do the same with religion not realizing that the arguments he gives have been addressed by those more qualified than he and of course, Dawkins does not give any impression that they have been addressed.<br /><br />Let's start with the review itself. On page 13, Dawkins asks that in defining reality, \\"if we are only going to call something `real' if we can detect it directly with one of our five senses?\\" (Parts of this edited due to the mistake noted below on my part.)<br /><br />Page 19 does come back to this. For ideas like jealousy and joy, happiness and love, he says these are real but depend on our senses. The conclusion being that they depend on the brain which means that which is real is sensory or depends on the sensory for it being real.<br /><br />I would not seriously doubt that if something is detectable with the five senses, it is real. That is sufficient for its reality, but is it necessary. Dawkins does not give a reason why. He states that knowledge begins with what we sense, and I agree with that, but he does not go beyond that. His starting point and the end point are the same, although his starting point can be enhanced through tools and technology.<br /><br />Does this mean however that things that cannot be detected with our senses cannot be real? What about universals such as human nature or triangularity? What about moral truths and mathematical truths? What about love and jealousy and joy? Now on the last group, as said, Dawkins says that these are real, but that these are dependent on our brains for their existence. He does not explain this. In what way are these things real, especially given his earlier definition of real? If jealousy and joy cannot be detected by the five senses, then it would seem that Dawkins needs to change his definition.<br /><br />How do these things depend on the brain? We don't know. Dawkins doesn't tell us. Is this an epiphenomenon? Is it entirely material? Dawkins leaves it unclear. Is there a reality of such a thing as mind that interacts with the brain or is it all brain? The student does not know, but the problem is also that he doesn't know to ask either. These questions are not being discussed and the student has not learned science here as much as philosophy. Dawkins also says jealousy and joy could exist on other planets but only if they contain brains. No argument is given for this. It is merely an assertion, which is odd considering Dawkins's insistence on evidence for beliefs. Apparently, the rule is that all beliefs have to have evidence, except for beliefs of the new atheists.<br /><br />Dawkins also in this part describes three kinds of magic. The first he calls supernatural magic, and uses as examples fairy tales and miracles, a classic case of poisoning the well. Dawkins says he will address miracles later. For now, these two are tightly connected with no explanation. For those who are curious, the other kinds of magic are stage magic and what he calls poetic magic, the wonder that we feel at the universe.<br /><br />In describing stage magic, Dawkins tells about people who claim to be able to bend metal, stop clocks, or contact the dead as charlatans. Now it could very well be the case that all of them are. I have not examined them, but for the sake of argument being of a skeptical mindset, I will gladly grant that every case that has been examined thus far has proven to be false in someway. The problem is that it does not follow from this that there are no such works. It is no proof that psychic powers cannot be real or the dead cannot be contacted.<br /><br />An analogy could be shown from UFO's. Most people think that at least the majority of all UFO cases are serious mistakes of some sort. They do not believe the others even though they're not sure how to explain them. This is fine because any worldview has some difficulties explaining some matters and some UFO cases we'd have a hard time knowing what to say. However, if it was the case that all UFO cases were shown to be hoaxes or something of that sort, does that mean that Dawkins would say \\"Very well! We must concede we have absolute proof that there are no aliens out there!\\"<br /><br />Now realize that I am not saying necessarily that one can contact the dead or have psychic powers. I am saying that Dawkins cannot say that because the cases we have have been shown to be hoaxes or inconclusive, that we can conclude that the reality does not exist. It can justify our skepticism, but it cannot prove our skepticism. Unfortunately, the young student reading this does not know this. Naturally, I agree with Dawkins that it is a shame that some people scam others in this way. However, I also think it's a shame that students are being told what to think this way instead of a lesson on evaluating data and exactly what conclusions can be drawn.<br /><br />On page 23, Dawkins says the supernatural can never be a true explanation. The reason for this is because the supernatural is beyond natural explanation. It is beyond science and the scientific method that has caused a huge increase in knowledge. To say it is supernatural is to say we don't understand it and we'd better not even try.<br /><br />But this just begs the question. Why should it be assumed that everything has a \\"natural\\" explanation? It cannot be known by science or the scientific method, but neither can jealousy or joy which Dawkins admits are real. Neither can mathematical or moral truths or universals like triangularity. The argument assumes that all knowledge is scientific or can be discoverable by the scientific method, which itself is a knowledge claim that is not scientific or discoverable by the scientific method.<br /><br />Furthermore, science has increased our knowledge, but that knowledge is specifically scientific knowledge and what kind of knowledge would it be expected to improve upon? Science progresses differently than philosophy or theology since its subject matter is, well, matter. To do the necessary studies, you have to have better and better technology and to have better technology, you have to have better science, and on and on. Science and technology help build one another. Ptolemy could not have known about a particular planet without a telescope he did not have and the technology needed to be there to build it first as well as the leisure time and ability to build it.<br /><br />Philosophy and theology however rely more on foundations and the rest of the time is spent working out what those foundations mean. Plato and Aristotle are still arguing against one another. Neither school denies the other school exists, but both schools have different starting metaphysical principles and outworkings from those. For the sciences, the disputes are largely philosophical as well. There is probably little disagreement on data, but much interpretation on what the data means.<br /><br />For instance, some young-earth creationists point to the low level of moon dust on the moon as evidence of a young-Earth. Old-Earthers do not dispute that, but they do not interpret that data as meaning the Earth is young. They have another explanation. Old-Earthers who are not theistic evolutionists can likely agree on what fossils are left in the fossil record, but have different ideas on how to interpret the data.<br /><br />Also, the foundations of science are rooted in Christian theism as it was believed that since the universe came from a rational mind, then it could be understood rationally. Scientists who were \\"filling the gaps\\" did not see themselves as limiting God but rather in giving more glory to God. I'm of the belief that the idea of \\"God of the gaps\\" is a straw man position that has been created by atheists for Christians to defend themselves from when really, the Christian church has historically wished to fill in the gaps. (The retreat of a number of fundamentalists from academia in response to evolutionary theory is a sad example of what we ought not to do.)<br /><br />We have the same on page 31 again stating that evolution is a real explanation as a counter to a supernatural explanation. The assumption is that if there is an evolutionary explanation, there cannot be a supernatural one. (Although I question the so-called natural/supernatural dichotomy.) This does not follow. My stance on debate is that I am more than happy to grant macroevolution to the atheist. I think this was a great mistake of the Christian church in that we wanted to be reactionary to evolution rather than just saying \\"Wait and see what the evidence says and then respond.\\" Evolution could be true and Jesus still rose from the dead. Evolution is at best an instrumental cause rather than an efficientcause. Dawkins has committed an either/or fallacy.<br /><br />(Interestingly, the paragraph where he derides the supernatural is the one quoted on the back of the book. Left out is the derision of the supernatural. Could it be because many parents would not buy it then?)<br /><br />At the start of chapter 2, Dawkins says he is aiming to give the best possible answers to questions, which is the answer of science. I'm sure that is the case for some questions, but it does not follow that it is for all. When we want to know if it is wrong to commit adultery, we do not use the sciences to determine. If we want to know what a line of Shakespeare means, science is not the way to answer the question. If we want to know what the square root of 4,096 is, we do not go to science. Dawkins is again poisoning the well giving students the idea that the best answer is always found in science and that in turn, the only questions that matter are scientific questions. (Note that in his debate in Mexico that Dawkins said that questions of a \\"Why?\\" sort are often meaningless questions.<br /><br />Dawkins also presents in chapter 2 a view about the Garden of Eden. He tells of two creation accounts. Naturally, he means Genesis 1 and 2, but he gives no argument that Genesis 1 and 2 should be seen as what he refers to as two versions. The former account is simply a cosmic account. The second account is a more in-depth account at one particular spot of creation with a focus on preparing us for chapter 3 and what follows. He also says that Adam and Eve ate the fruit acquiring knowledge, losing their innocence he supposes. The problem was not knowledge as Adam was to subdue the Earth which would include learning about it, but going apart from God.<br /><br />Dawkins tells us on page 52 that we all share a common ancestor. We know this because we all have some genes in common. This does not follow however. All cars have something in common, but it does not follow they all have a common ancestor. They do all have a common designer in that all cars are designed by men. All creatures having some genes in common could be because of a common ancestor or because of a common designer or it could be a sign of both. Unfortunately again, the student has the answer given to him before he even knows there is a relevant question.<br /><br />On page 74 and 75 Dawkins tells us that when we see an animal and when we look in the mirror we need to realize that we are looking at a survival machine for genes. One wonders what the moral implications will be for this if it is embraced. If I am just a survival machine, why should I care about these other machines provided I get my genes taken care of? As has been asked, why not rape and pillage and get those genes passed on? Others might not like it? Who cares?<br /><br />On page 95 after talking about microscopic organisms, Dawkins tells us that none of this information is included in so-called holy books given by an all-knowing god. In fact, none of them tell how big the universe is, or about gravity or electricity or any modern advances. If these were works of God, wouldn't we expect to see that in them?<br /><br />Well, no.<br /><br />I immediately think of Proverbs 25:2 where it is the glory of God to conceal a matter and the glory of kings to find it out. I think God did not tell us these things because He wanted us to discover them on our own and do our homework. The things He did tell us are things that we could not know on our own or at least not know easily and things that were necessary for our salvation.<br /><br />Besides, do we expect Paul to be writing an epistle and then say in the middle \\"And in the 20th century since the first advent of Christ, expect a disease called AIDS that attacks something called the Immune System. One only wonders what Peter would have said to say about Paul's writings then! This was to be copied down for centuries without anyone having a clue what relevance it had to anything, a largedistinction from that of prophecy such as that of the coming Messiah in the Old Testament.<br /><br />Dawkins would condemn many fundamentalists who think they are to find messages especially for them in the Bible, but he has done the exact same thing in thinking that the Bible should have been written with his time in mind if it came from God. Considering how in the time of the Bible paper was valuable and one would not write more than they had to, it is not a shock. Furthermore, prophecy is not meant to be just God showing off, but God showing who He is for the benefit of His people. Today that has been done in Christ and that message is the one to be given.<br /><br />Finally, what does that have to do with science? Nothing. Dawkins has made a theological claim in a book about science. If Dawkins was just wanting to write a science textbook, there would be no need to mention such a thing. No. Dawkins writes this with a goal in mind of getting students to be atheists. Now I think that is perfectly fine for him to do. He has all freedom to do that. I also have the freedom to write a response to what he has said. Parents also have the freedom to decide if they want their child to be taught atheism or science. The two are not identical.<br /><br />On page 123, Dawkins tells of how in the Hebrew account, YHWH created light on the first day, but did not create the sun until the 4th day and says that we are not told where the light came from on the first day. It is not mentioned that young-earthers, old-earthers, and theistic evolutionists who hold to the Inerrancy of Scripture all do have answers to this objection. Some may work and some may not, but they are there. The student does not know this. One could even say \\"Well it could be Genesis is not Inerrant, but that would not disprove Christian theism.\\" To be sure, losing Inerrancy would change our approach to Scripture were it to happen, and for the record I am an Inerrantist, but it would not be the end of Christianity. Proving a contradiction in Genesis does not prove that the gospels and epistles are in error in all they say.<br /><br />At the start of chapter 7, Dawkins starts with telling about flood stories and begins with Gilgamesh and then says the story should be recognizable to children reared in Christian, Jewish, or Muslim countries. It's the story of Noah's Ark with one or two minor differences.<br /><br />For those unaware, let me tell some minor differences<br /><br />In Gilgamesh, the boat is not seaworthy. In Noah, it is.<br />In Gilgamesh and in Noah, the length of time and flooding and receding is much different.<br />In Gilgamesh, the flood takes place because the gods can't sleep. In Noah, it is for punishment of sin.<br />In Gilgamesh, it is polytheistic. In Noah, it is monotheistic.<br />In Gilgamesh, the hero gets immortality in the end. In Noah, the hero gets drunk.<br /><br />These are just basic differences. A whole list can be found here: [...]<br />On page 208 and 209, Dawkins talks about earthquakes and uses Sodom and Gomorrah along with Jericho as examples. I would have no problem with these being the results of earthquakes. In this case, these would be second-class miracles in that the miracle was not the event itself but that the event happened when it did. Dawkins seems to think that if a natural explanation of something is found, then it can no longer be the action of God, but this does not follow. Dawkins also tells of how a real story could have eventually become the folk legend of Joshua, but his analogy is simply a telephone game. Were the accounts of the events written years afterwards? Dawkins says so, but he does not give a reason why. Unfortunately, the student has got a lesson on oral tradition and historiography, but not on science. He has also learned that lesson from someone who is not an authority.<br /><br />Finally, one eventually gets to the last chapter on miracles. What does this have to do with science? Who knows. Dawkins acts as if any miracle will destroy science. As he says on page 263, it would never be right to call something we cannot understand or explain a miracle. That would end discussion and further investigation. This does not follow and in fact, let us assume for the sake of argument that Jesus really did rise from the dead and did not do so by naturalistic means. To say \\"We will keep searching until we find the naturalistic means\\" is to say \\"We will search in futility.\\" Because one wants a naturalistic means does not mean there is one. At the same time, because one wants a supernatural explanation does not mean that there is one. What we need is to be open to miraculous and non-miraculous explanations.<br /><br />On page 254, Dawkins says miracles would be disturbing to science since that would involve breaking a law of nature. However, while I do not agree with the definition of breaking the laws of nature, does this not entail that there are laws of nature still? If I pick up a box, I have gone against gravity in a sense, but it does not mean I have violated science. God just has more means to do things than I do. The laws of nature can be intact and still allow for miracles. In fact, it is because we believe in laws of nature that we know about miracles.<br /><br />How so? A miracle is seen as an exception to that which is \\"natural.\\" The reason we believe a virgin birth would be a miracle would be because we know that it takes sex naturally to make a baby. The reason we consider the resurrection of Christ to be a miracle is because we know dead people naturally stay dead. Those who believe in miracles do not dispute scientific facts. We know that water does not instantly become wine. We know that it takes sex to make a baby. We know people don't walk on water naturally. We know dead people stay dead.<br /><br />The big shock is also that the ancient people knew that too! That is why they recorded these as miracles. That they believed in these miracles is not because they were ignorant of science. Certainly they did not know all we know about science, but even if they could not explain the interaction between the molecules in one's feet and that in water to explain how someone could not walk on water, they knew that someone could not. They recognized these as miracles because they knew these facts already even if they didn't know the main details of these facts. They buried their dead because they knew their dead were staying dead. Joseph sought to divorce Mary because he knew what it took to make a baby and he knew he had not done that.<br /><br />The only way you could have exceptions then is if there is a natural order. If there was no natural order, there could be no miracles because all would be random. It is only because there is a natural order that there are miracles.<br /><br />Dawkins's argument against miracles is Hume. There is no mention that pretty much every Christian philosopher and their mother has commented on Hume. There is no mention that Hume said that past experience cannot be used to prove future events. If you release a stone and it falls 1,000 times, that will not prove it will fall the 1,001st time. If that is the case, then it would seem Hume himself has destroyed any basis for trusting the laws of science. Of course, Hume was sure it would fall, but he was making a claim on how that could be known, or rather not known.<br /><br />The answer to Hume is that he was essentially begging the question. Hume assumes that all has occurred naturally and we know this because miracles have not occurred. How do we know that they have not occurred? Because all has happened naturally. The question of if a miracle has taken place is a historical question. The question of if they can is a philosophical and theological question. Neither is in the domain of science.<br /><br />On page 262, Dawkins describes the turning of water into wine saying it only occurs in one gospel, which is true enough, but then says all four gospels were written long after the events they describe and not one of them by an eyewitness, so it is safe to conclude that they are not accurate. No mention is made that the history of people like Alexander the Great was written centuries after and not by eyewitnesses. No mention is also made that Dawkins's own claim is disputed, notably by someone like Richard Bauckham in \\"Jesus and the Eyewitnesses.\\" Again, the student has been given a lesson on historiography and not science, and Dawkins is not a historian.<br /><br />As I finished the book, I pondered that the title is about how we know what's really true, but Dawkins did not tell us that. Dawkins no where gives an epistemology. He affirms the scientific method, but does not say how we'd know it to be valid, especially for truths that are not scientific. Dawkins does not really define what it means to be true either. One could say there is a close parallel between that and real, but that needs to be explained.<br /><br />No doubt, as I said, much of the science is good and fascinating to read, but the parts I highlighted here are those that show Dawkins has something different in mind than just teaching science, something he would condemn by Christians. I recommend we need to follow C.S. Lewis's advice here. Lewis wrote once that what needs to be done is that the main authorities on academic matters need to be Christians. They do not need to be Christians necessarily writing apologetics works, as good as those are, but Christians just wishing to pass on knowledge. A Christian can write a book on how to do history without seeking to show his Christianity at all. He can write on doing medicine without having to quote Scripture. He can write on astronomy without having to talk about the grandeur of God.<br /><br />In fact, I would prefer he write in those ways so it can be that he is not writing seeking to tell readers what to think but how to think and when it comes out that he is a Christian, well the community realizes Christians can be great thinkers. What if it was the case that all best-selling books on subject matters like this were by Christians? What would it mean if we could re-enter the academy in that regards and be the authorities not on the details of the matter but on how to do the work of the matter. A Christian is the one who knows the most facts about medicine. A Christian is the one who has the most knowledge of how to best use a spectroscope. A Christian is the one who best knows how to do a sum in geometry.<br /><br />The response to this book then is not to run from the academy. It is to enter it with full force. It is to meet the enemy head-on and engage. Dawkins has done in fact in a sense what we should have been doing. Christians are to be in pursuit of knowledge just because it is knowledge. This is God's world and we need to know all that there is to know about it. We also need to be educating our children on the value of their minds and encouraging them to read everything they can on what interests them, and read both sides. I want my children to read Dawkins, and I want them to read what disagrees with Dawkins so they can know what to choose and make an informed decision.<br /><br />If we believe the facts are with us, and they are, we need not be afraid.<br /><br />Share this:. They do all have a common designer in that all cars are designed by men. All creatures having some genes in common could be because of a common ancestor or because of a common designer or it could be a sign of both.

B005VMVUAQ|2.0|This movie was known to be (right from the beginning) a film where a family was kidnapped and held hostage in their own home. Not a problem with the movie plot; we like the action and felt like seein it to see how these particular ppl wouild get out of their situation (Harrison Ford starred in one lately, as well: \\"Firewall\\"). With that said, we noticed the rating was an \\"R\\" and when I heard the credits begin to roll I was certain this movie was going to be good.Not all \\"R\\" ratings are the same and this one did not describe in detail or even in partial(that I can find) that the language was pervasive...strongly pervasive. When words like this are so repetitive they actually destroy the picture. I don't know a single person who goes to a movie and says to himself,<br /><br />\\"hey buddy, I can't wait to see that new picture showing this weekend that is loaded with pervasive foul language.\\"<br /><br />On the other hand, I HAVE heard ppl say to themselves, \\"I've heard the story line (or plot, etc) is really great and I want to see that movie this weekend!\\"<br /><br />Film Directors and Producers: do the world a favor and produce some movies with a few less lines of the foul stuff that is so over done that one groans and has to leave the theatre or take their DVD back and ask for a refund.<br /><br />Great story line with far too much language to make it realistic. I give it 3 stars for the movie plot alone.

There is an eclectic mixture of international Christmas songs - and the one Christmas CD that I never tire of - my other 12 Christmas albums from the last 15 years, are rotated on alternate years.  But this one, I will be playing every Christmas!

0099519852|5.0|This book is a must-read for anyone who wants to support the efforts of children or young people in excelling at whatever they do.  Unique insights include the concepts of \\"deep practice\\" and \\"ignition,\\" among others.  Daniel Coyle writes with wit and humor, mixed with evidence-based findings that make science understandable in figuring  out why some youngsters, teens and adults appear to be genius-types, but in fact have built up layers upon layers of neural connections that are the \\"broadband\\" messages underlying their talent.
B005CMSDLE|3.0|The acting was pretty good in this movie and the story was pretty cool, so great fighting sequences. I only wish there could have been a little bit more to it...more action and whatnot, but it wasn't too bad. An average thriller. I did very much enjoy the Chemical Brothers music in it.  Overall, worth a watch I think, but not sure it's one I would probably own.
B00005YUNY|5.0|Thursday November 22 found Yes playing and recording it's second show at the Heineken Music Hall in Amsterdam. The band had used the first show to get everything 'just exactly perfect\\" for filming on the second night. The band was on tour supporting it's new album Magnification and this show was recorded with the European Festival Orchestra. The band had asked Rick Wakeman to play but he was unavailable so Tom Brislin was brought in on Keyboards and backing vocals.<br /><br />The show opens with a nice fanfare before giving way to a classic reading of Close To The Edge. This is followed by a strong version of Long Distance Runaround. Next up, the band offers up two of the strongest songs from the new album, Don't Go and In The Presence Of.... The Gates of Delirium gets an absolutely stunning workout with the orchestra sounding absolutely perfect on the song. Steve Howe then takes over for Concerto In D, 2nd Movement and Mood For A Day. The band comes back out blazing on Magnification before offering up a great And You And I. The band then gives us another treat with The Topographic Oceans classic Ritual. I've Seen All Good People is it's usual great self. Owner Of A Lonely Heart is next and Steve absolutely SHREDS the guitar solo. The show ends with...yes, you guessed it Roundabout. The picture quality and sound are top notch for this release. There's also an option to watch with animation. Unfortunately, on the Blu Ray version you don't have the option to watch without the animation. The second dvd has the music video for Don't Stop as well as a nice documentary.
1606865617|2.0|Arundhati Roy wrote a very interesting story and has a good command of the language. Unfortunately, I was lost in the stream-of-consciousness style of writing. She jumped from person-to-person much like Virginia Woolf, without using the Woolfian sentence structure. If that's not difficult enough, I had to unravel the chronology. She jumps between two different time periods and often jumps again within the same time period. It made for a confusing mess, to say the least. Nonetheless, the plot lines are solid and the writing itself is solid.   If you understand Indian culture or have been to India, you would probably get a lot out of this book. If you have no interest in India, feel free to skip this one.
0385738773|3.0|The thing that I wanted most out of this third book was answers. And they never come. Sue, some things are explained a **BIT** more but nothing that really matters. Thomas doesn't get his memories back and those who do offer nothing to explain anything that is going on. The ending was fairly anti-climatic and a bit of a downer. It doesn't exactly end on a high note. Not that this was a high-note type of series, but I guess I got to the end and was left unfulfilled and left wanting for more.  The series started off so wonderfully, but in finishing this I'm of the opinion that not even James Dashner understood the intricacies of what WICKED was up to and just hoped that most readers wouldn't ask the real questions at the end. Disappointing considering how much potential this series had at the beginning.  I did give it three stars. The story itself is pretty decent as Thomas escapes from WICKED and experiences how things have become in the \\"real world.\\" His adventures and experiences in Denver seemed to be the highlight of the book for me, but as I got closer and closer to the end things just didn't seem to click well with me and I knew I was going to end up disappointed.  If I could go back in time and advise myself if this was a series worth picking up, I would probably advise otherwise. If, however, you've read the first two books and liked them, I would recommend picking up the third. Some things are answered, even if to me they didn't jive with everything, so you might find something more fulfilling than I did. Better than wondering forever how it ends.
B0008ENIAC|5.0|Among the many cultural resources of the Washington D.C. area is the American Film Institute Silver which is in the middle of its annual retrospective of classic noir films called \\"Noir City D.C: the 2011 Film Noir Festival\\". The Festival is presenting 18 movies over a two week period, including \\"Mildred Pierce\\" the 1945 film starring Joan  Crawford. Crawford received the Academy Award for best actress for her portrayal of the title character. I saw the film in the AFI's large, period style ornate and upholstered 400 seat theater on a rainy afternoon. I find this a much more appealing way to view a classic film than watching a DVD.<br /><br />I wanted to see this movie because I read not long ago the novel on which it is based, Mildred Pierce (1941) by James M. Cain.  [[ASIN:0307946592 Mildred Pierce (Movie Tie-in Edition  Vintage Crime/Black Lizard)]] Cain's novel and the movie were great popular successes when released, but the novel for a time drifted into obscurity. Then in 2011, HBO presented a mini-series of Mildred Pierce which I have not seen.  With the movie and HBO adaptation, Cain's novel gained additional attention. I think the book is an important work of American literature, as evidenced, among other ways, by the adaptations.<br /><br />Cain was a tough, hardboiled writer of noir. His novel, Mildred Pierce, is unique in the noir genre because its primary character is a woman and because the emphasis of the book is on understanding a complex individual. Most noir, movie or novel, does not delve deeply into character and still fewer works develop a female character. Unlike most noir, there is no murder in Cain's novel and no detective as a main character.<br /><br />Directed by Michael Curtiz and with dramatic music by Max Steiner, the movie changes Cain's story in many respects, primarily by opening the book with the murder of one of the main characters, a once wealty ne'r do well named Monte Baragon (Zachary Scott) who was Mildred's second husband.  Mildred is brought in for questioning and relates her story to the detective in the process of finding the murderer.  The story Mildred relates loosely tracks Cain's novel, again with several differences.  Character development is not emphasized nearly as fully in the movie as in the book. The movie becomes instead a fast-paced melodrama. It is something of a tear jerker in addition to noir.<br /><br />This is still an outstanding movie faithful in broad outline to Cain's book. In its portrayal of Depression era Los Angeles, the movie captures a great deal of the spirit of noir. The black and white photography and the shaded lighting add a great deal to the tension of the film.  The dialogue is short and clipped. Mildred Pierce in book and movie is a story of class conflict, greed, lust, betrayal, and ingratitude.  Mildred separates from her first husband Albert (Bruce Bennett) with little in the way of skills to support herself and her two daughters.  She secures a poorly paid job as a waitress in a hash house and rises to own a chain of restaurants called \\"Mildred's\\".  The death of her younger daughter and troubles with men bring Mildred sorrow.  But the focus of the book is on Mildred's relationship with her scheming, evil and jealous older daughter, Veda, (Ann Blyth). The portrayal of Veda in the movie is much sharper and less nuanced than in Cain's novel.<br /><br />This film version of Mildred Pierce is included in a reference work on film titled \\"1001 Movies to See before you Die\\".[[ASIN:0764164228 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die]] Here is a portion of the book's description of the movie.<br /><br />\\"A definitive 1940's women's picture and a seething domestic soap opera, {Mildred Pierce]... is also a superbly nasty noir, one that plays havoc with the era's ideals of maternal devotion and mom's apple pie.  Mildred is admirable for her hard work and self-sacrifice. She is smart, ambitious, and driven, qualities respected and rewarded in the American ethic.  But gradually as she detaches from her decent but unsuccessful husband.... and as she favors the insolent Vera over her sweeter younger daughter, putting the child's death behind her with no evident afterthought, we begin to sesne an unhealthy, even pathological, aspect to Mildred's compulsion.  Throbbing melodrama does not come with more conviction.\\" (p. 202)<br /><br />Mildred Pierce would not be mistaken for a modern film about an independent career woman. Crawford's role is smoldering and her attentions are invariably taken and sought by men.  Yet Mildred's character is strongly portrayed.  The film shows her desire to make something of her life and to give her daughter the advantages Mildred herself lacked. Mildred is her own person in this movie rather than only the love interest of a male character. Mildred remains the heroine in this movie, albeit a sad, broken heroine.<br /><br />There sometimes is a tendency to downgrade products of American popular culture, whether in the forms of books or movies. Cain's novel will survive the pejorative terms of \\"pulp\\" or \\"trash\\" that it on occasion received. So too, the film, and Joan Crawford's acting will reward watching.  I was grateful to see this movie as part of a noir retrospective in a beautiful theater where it rightfully belongs.<br /><br />Robin Friedmanssful husband.... and as she favors the insolent Vera over her sweeter younger daughter, putting the child's death behind her with no evident afterthought, we begin to sesne an unhealthy, even pathological, aspect to Mildred's compulsion.

B002QKZLZ6|5.0|I've had this for several weeks now, using it daily. The clip is quick snug and fits nicely on the side of my backpack or slips into my pocket. It's nice and soft and the headset fits in really securely. The little lid using a magnetic clip to hold itself closed and it works perfectly. I'm very pleased with it so far but have only used it for about a little while so far. Feels like it can take normal usage but I wouldn't subject it to abuse and expect it to hold it's shape.
B005WGBQ9G|3.0|I really want to like this show but i cant because of how stupid the characters act. From letting the kids wander around in a unsecured area, not replacing their cars and motorhome with new and reliable models since every car they come across is going to be for the taking and worst of all most of them are not even armed when outside vehicles.   The writing staff needs to be fed to the zombies.

B005M92MJ6|5.0|Not much music made these days is worth listening to, much less paying for.  Not this, this is one of the best albums of the past 2-3 years.  Do yourself a favor and buy it.
B005ETANC2|1.0|The image quality is excellent on this DVD but the sound recording is beyond horrible. At many points, even with the sound at maximum, the actors seem to be whispering. At other points, with the sound at a medium level, the actors seem to be screaming their lines. Constantly having to raise and lower the volume was a constant headache and ruins the movie.
B0041KKYGU|4.0|I've been a fan of Cameron Diaz since her days as the sweet characters in THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT MARY and MY BEST FRIEND'S WEDDING. Get ready for  foul-mouthed and sleazy teacher Elizabeth Halsey, played by Diaz. I didn't know the whole premise of BAD TEACHER and I imagined Diaz would be a good-hearted but unconventional teacher who is \\"bad\\" because she doesn't follow the rules. Well, she is bad in every sense of the word...and not the \\"good\\" bad of today's slang.   Justin Timberlake co-stars as a substitute teacher from a wealthy background. He's perfect or Elizabeth since her goal in life is to find a wealthy husband, but first she has to raise money to pay for breast enlargement surgery. How about the fund-raiser car wash the students are having? It's time for the sexy teacher to get wet in her short shorts. Diaz plays the role with total enjoyment. And don't miss the fully-clothed \\"sex\\" scene between Diaz and Timberlake.  It's fun to see Diaz in a different role. Along with BRIDESMAIDS, BAD TEACHER is part of a new and growing genre where the women are the raunchy deadbeats out for a good time. It's no longer the guys who are foul-mouthed and irresponsible. The tables have turned and it is great fun.
B002B44KDG|5.0|The great thing about Neil Young is that he continues to adapt his stype and try new things. Don't get me wrong, this is still clasic Neil Young; just Neil Young with a bit of a different twist like during the days of Crazyhorse. If you're a true Young fan you'll definitely come to appreciate the sounds of his acoustic on this album and that old twang in his voice.
B000G03RJA|5.0|All her songs are very good on this CD.  Best song is, \\"Ti Amo\\" and \\"How Can I Live Without You.\\"
B000059TEQ|5.0|I bought this on impulse and it was a pleasure watching this movie after so many years. Back in the day when this movie was released, it was a classic right then. Now of course things have changed, teenagers have a lifestyle with far less restrictions so it's hard for them to appreciate the essence of this movie. Watching it again now took me back to the simpler times of those decades. And yes, I cried even now watching this movie. Lovely movie, would love to watch again.
B005C7SXNW|4.0|This wry, sly, acerbic and often off-center coming of age story is the best UK indie import I've seen in a long time.  Stylishly directed by British comic Richard Ayoade, the story revolves around a quirky, precocious, sometimes mordant teen (Craig Roberts) who works at impressing a semi-pretty classmate in his seaside Welsh village while simultaneously attempting to save his coolly remote parents' marriage.  Dramatic and funny, this great looking film perfectly conveys the awkwardness of adolescence as well as it's fleeting rewards.  I love these \\"English Village\\" movies with their dark humor.  If this is your cup of tea, check out TAMARA DREWE, KEEPING MUM and UNDERTAKING BETTY.
0439023513|3.0|Loved the first two books like everyone else here.  Then you come into the third.... and it actually gets a bit tedious and boring at times! Pretty surprising given how gripping the first two were.<br /><br />But does this review or any other review of the third book really matter? The fact is, once you reach the end of Book 2, \\"Catching Fire,\\" you have no choice but to read Mockingjay because of the cliffhanger ending at the end of Book 2.  So my suggestion simply is to realize that you may find yourself skimming parts of Book 3.<br /><br />There are a few shockers near the end, which leave Katniss as a battered psychological wreck (as if they haven't been working on destroying her mind thru 2 books already!).  But Suzanne Collins neatly cleans this up in about 20 pages until it's a \\"and the remaining battered survivors lived (mostly) happily ever after\\" kind of pat ending that skims over any details or scenes we've been hoping for thru three books. (Say, for example, a young-adult appropriate love scene???? Come on, Ms. Collins, you couldn't even give us that????  It's best that if you were hoping for this, to know ahead of time that it doesn't really happen in any satisfying way.)<br /><br />So, just realize in reading this that it will wrap things up in a tidy bow for you, but you may not be wholly satisfied with how it turns out.
B003ZSJ212|3.0|The big news on the home video front is the release of the six-episode STAR WARS saga in true high definition.  Long awaited by fans and collectors - after all, there are now two generations of potential buyers - this set offers many small changes George Lucas considers improvements, but there's not much that's really new here.  And that's true of the (mostly) retread of the bonus material.  The possible exception is the \\"Conversation With The Masters\\" feature on disc nine.  New extras, fillers of little substance, include the Star Wars Spoofs and the \\"Star Warriors\\" feature.<br /><br />There's no question this iconic series has embedded itself in the cultural fabric of the late 20th Century and remains an enduring element of our sometimes-nebulous zeitgeist.  Initially released on May 25, 1977 as one segment in an imaginary cliffhanger series (done a la Saturday matinee style), the brilliance of the notion, the setting and the hero's quest struck a nerve among young - and older -- filmgoers worldwide.  Perhaps it was that seemingly endless opening shot of the battle cruiser as it entered the frame.  Whatever it was, we immediately knew we were in good hands and we eagerly suspended disbelief.  Everything about the production seemed new and yet familiar.  It had a vivid comic book pace and look, while also invoking a patina of spirituality.<br /><br />But I sense a disturbance in the force.  Can you hear the screech of die-hard Lucasites?  Even though George Lucas has sought to smooth out and improve elements that have bothered him, these alterations, however small, are made in the prequel trilogy (Episodes I, II and III), those effects seem to ripple in the original trilogy (Episodes IV, V and VI) which follows.<br /><br />It seems silly, but the original episodes have accrued a sacred status with many fans.  Kind of like embracing only the King James Version of the Bible.  But since George Lucas is creator and thus god of his cinematic and digital universe, he can do what he likes. Still, it's unsettling.  There's a feeling that the changes in the prequel somehow contaminate the original trilogy - when in normal chronological story telling, it's should be the other way around.<br /><br />Some of the minor changes, however inconsequential, are quickly noticed by those of us who have seen the films countless times first as kids and now with our kids.  There's the insertion of a scene in \\"A New Hope,\\" where R2-D2 hides behind digitally rendered rocks, Obi-Wan Kenobi's altered dragon call (also in \\"A New Hope\\") and the blinking Ewoks in \\"Return of the Jedi.\\"  I'm glad the Ewoks blink.  That blank stare really bothered me.  Seriously.  Now they seem alive and not so much little people in costumes.<br /><br />Exactly how many versions of STAR WARS do we need?  Times are difficult, and it's hard not to feel exploited.  No doubt fans will buy the Blu-ray set (you can also buy the original trilogy in BD), but a persistent, pervasive element of greed sours the whole experience.<br /><br />For the time being, I suggest enjoying Luke, Leia, Obi, Yoda, Han, Darth, Chewie, Boba, Jabba and the gang on whatever DVD version you have but on an up-convert player.  See it in near true hi-def but wait until the 3-D version comes out.  It's already in the pipeline.  And hey, who knows, rumor is it will be the first of the 3D home videos that can be experienced without those cumbersome glasses!  Now that would be worth the wait!<br /><br />By then, I predict, Lucas will finish the set with Episodes VII, VIII and IX (in Holographic Surround D©).  And the home versions will start all over again -- no doubt with a few tweaks here and there as Lucas, in his endless act of creation, searches for perfection.

B000PMLFRA|4.0|If you are like me and is only out for the picture/audio quality, I recommend getting both trilogy sets rather than the overpriced `saga' set (I myself got both sets under 25 dollars in the Marketplace section).    Yes, the movies look great and sound great.  Unless you've been living in Yoda's hut, you are fairly aware that these are the altered sets.  I am sure if you do your homework; you know what kind of changes was made here.    After doing my own homework of the various sets, the consistency is the movies look great/sound great, and the saga set does have bonus stuff these trilogy sets do not, but it's the quality of the bonus material that's lacking.  Considering there is 1,000+ 1 star reviews on the saga set, and 1,000+ 5 star reviews on this set (as well as 700+ 1 star reviews on this set), you make up your own mind whether you want to buy this set or not.  On the merits of the Blu Ray set, I got what I paid for. Maybe, someday, when a REAL COMPLETE saga set is unleashed to the world, I will shell out the extra money.  Until then, I am content with what I bought.  It didn't break the bank.  I did not have to ask for a mortgage. And I still have the 2004 DVD set for the superior bonus material, and burn DVD copies of the original ORIGINAL trilogy.

1463514581|4.0|I don't usually \\"do\\" murder mysteries, but this book is fantastic. The characters are charming, amusing, and life-like. They do stupid things, make dumb mistakes, and are generally wonderful, horrible, funny, wrong-headed, mean, and lovable. I won't tell you which ones are which.  I sat down to flip through something on my e-reader because I was cross with some friends, and the next thing I knew, I was done. Now, admittedly, I'm a fast reader, but this book never let up. There was never a moment where I thought \\"this would be a good place to stop reading for a while.\\"

The characters are interesting and just when you think you have the book figured out, she brings in the smoke and mirrors and twists the story in another direction. Great read.
B0017OB12O|5.0|This is an epic that never had a good transfer for home video.  Untill now.  In fact, the DVD transfer was dark, blurred, with huge problems with consistency in color correction. A sad way to experience this great film for generations that - such as myself - could never see it in a movie theater.  But now, with this blu-ray release, it's all changed.  One of the most pleasant experiences one can get with blu-ray is to get the feeling like you were watching that old film for the first time. As if it was a completely different movie.  And this blu-ray transfer of The Bridge on the River Kwai does that.  Picture quality is not as astonishing as in transfers made from films shot with large format negatives, such as Technirama, UltraPanavision etc. But it is certainly as good as a Cinemascope film can look, in my opinion.   In that sense, this transfer is as perfect as it can get. And it did really well on my 120-inch projection screen. A tough test for many transfers.  Besides the Blu-ray, this edition brings a DVD copy of the film, good extra features, reproductions of lobby cards, a book with digi trays and a slipcover with embossed details on it.  Worthy to be in any collection.

At first it seemed as if this were a childrens book - and i suppose in relation to Dawkins other texts this could be considered a childrens book, but it more closely resembled a TEXTbook, really. And i mean that in a nice way. It's a fascinating read, wonderfully illustrated, and the format - as i mentioned - is akin to a textbook - but incredibly readable.   In the end, i find it an honor to own this book. It's contents are exciting, empowering, thoughtful, powerful, entertaining & TRUE. If you have even an inkling to buy this book, just go ahead and do it without another thought - it's a fat, colorful, entertaining, showpiece of a read.
B00000272N|4.0|In 1991, the Seattle music scene exploded and that has been well-documented but the rumblings of this explosion had been stirring through much of the late `80's. One of the great bands to come from the grunge movement, one who was also probably in many ways the most traditional heavy metal band of the era was Alice In Chains, who made their debut with `Facelift' in 1990. Led by lead guitarist and main songwriter Jerry Cantrell and gravelly voiced singer Layne Staley, the band cut an impressive first record and suddenly became a force on a metal world that was in the process of rewriting commercially acceptable metal. Recalling the doom of Black Sabbath but with a more modern melodic sense, Alice was one of the heaviest bands to get regular airplay as lead single \\"Man in the Box\\" got heavy radio and MTV rotation.  Other gems include first track \\"We Die Young\\", \\"Sea of Sorrow\\", \\"It Ain't Like That\\" and \\"Love Hate Love\\". Not as even or as carefully crafted as `Dirt' which made them superstars or as diverse as the follow up `Sap' and `Jar of Flies' nonetheless `Facelift' was an accomplished debut and contained many of the elements that made the band an absolute monster in the `90s. Much of their later music focused on the inner turmoil which plagued the band, most notably Staley, throughout their career and there is some of that on `Facelift' but the sheer heaviness of the LP seemed to dominate the message.  Scary's on the wall...

B004ZNARH4|5.0|Yep, it's steep but, worth it.  I bought this set for the original quad mix and for that alone. I am happy with my purchase.  I heard this album 30 some odd years ago on a reel to reel quad set up and it blew me away.  When the SACD version came out I was hoping for a similar experience but, I was not as impressed as I was with the original quad.  One would think 5.1 is greater than 4, in this instance however, it isn't!  If you are a roughly 50-60 year old who grew up on this album, you certainly will be glad to have it.  If you haven't gotten into home theater and modern audio, save your money.  The remixed stereo version is very good and much less expensive.  The concert footage and screen films are cool but limited, the entire album does not play during the screen films, just the part of the song that accompanied the film, disappointing.  The extras are fluff most adults can do without.  The 5.1 mix is very similar to the SACD, very cool version but, if your getting it for the 5.1 and you already have the SACD, save your money.  If you always wanted a copy of the quad mix and are willing to pay for it, you won't be disappointed, I certainly am not.

B005WY8YZW|5.0|I think this is the best Puscifer cd by far. I am a Tool fan first, APC second and listened to some of V, I was very shocked that this cd moved me. This is a great cd that you can play without skipping any songs.   I guess I am getting old, but looking at these reviews I agree with the content but my favorite song is Monsoon, which is low on everyone's radar. Can't wait for the new Tool cd.  On a side note I think the new Jane's Addiction cd is the best since Nothings Shocking, good stuff as well, check it out.

B005LJK3AC|5.0|I found myself laughing out loud during most of this movie! I think a few bad ratings must be dragging it down because it was one of the funniest movies I have seen this year. Over the top comedy...Jason Bateman was fantastic, as was Kevin Spacey...and Jennifer Anniston is the perfect sexually harassing female boss!  Just when you think they can't take it any further, they blow you away.  Really, really funny.

B0054JZC6E|1.0|I read the other reviews and I figured that no game could be THAT bad. If nothing else, this app could be something to play with while waiting in line or something. It IS that bad. I \\"purchased\\" this thing on October 7th. It's October 18th and I can't even download it, nevermind installing it!   The thing doesn't even show up in My Apps. I've seen it there only twice, and both times I attempted to download/install it, only for the Amazon app to give an unknown download error. I don't think it's Amazon's fault at all, since I've installed almost 50 apps from the store here.   Maybe if the dev ever fixes the game, I'll be able to play and change my review.
B005G4TJUC|5.0|The movie is awesome it's by far better than the rest. I highly recommend it. However this version of the DVD sux, no special features, AT ALL. Not bloopers, not deleted scenes or even the trailer. NOTHING. Wait for the bigger version coming later this year. The price is not bad, but you get what you pay for, I guess.
B005ELZKWS|5.0|If you don't like this album you probably didn't like Fair Warning or Happy Tails on Diver Down either.  This album is more diverse than the previous album and it's a great thing!  There are plenty of good rock tunes on here like Alright, and Big Foot.  But there are some other gems in Come Closer, Something Gone Wrong which is reminiscent of Van Halen's Big Bad Bill from Diver Down but more bluesy.  All the songs on the album have a slightly different flavor.  Sadly, one of the best songs is the unlisted \\"No Change\\" from the CD release that is not included with the online download.  This album has multiple good songs with great variety like the early Van Halen albums had.  \\"Alright\\" is already handsomely endorsed by my 2 1/2 year old son who keeps asking me to \\"turn it up\\" when we are in the car.

1416562605|5.0|This readable and entertaining novel by Aravind Adiga comes with an incredible amount of hype. Its portrayal of an Indian \\"entrepreneur\\" who launched his career by murdering his employer (this is not a spoiler, it is revealed early on) is described as \\"dark and unsettling.\\"<br /><br />Dark, yes, but as in dark comedy. It may be there is somewhere in India a prosperous entrepreneur who got his start through murder and robbery, just as there certainly were in the U.S., the UK and any other country built on the industry of entrepreneurs. But it would be silly to think that this is the rule and it's not likely that is what Adiga was trying to convey.<br /><br />It is satire, an Indian Babbitt, in a way, but not, as one blurb would have it, a book as powerful as Native Son or Invisible Man. It won the Man Booker Prize and is written with dazzling wit and surprising grace. The construction of the book as a memo to the Chinese premier is clever, and allows the narrator, Balram Halwai, to declare that the age of the white man is over and the future belongs to the brown and yellow.<br /><br />The wonderful characterizations of Balram's family, his employers, his servant milieu carry the reader along on a fascinating journey into the micro-economy behind India's new-found economic success. The withering cynicism of Balram's description of Indian democracy makes the country at first seem uncivilized, though this rampant corruption is not totally unknown in the history of Western society, either.<br /><br />Balram, the rebellious and murderous servant, is as rare as the white tiger, and as ferocious. His rise as the son of a rickshaw-puller and server in a tea shop to manager of a car service catering to the high-tech startups in Bangalore via a stint in Delhi as driver for the \\"landlords\\" of his hometown is an enlightening saga.<br /><br />In the end, as with Babbitt, the reader is left with an insight into the hollowness of materialism, but also with a debunking of alternative ideals like family, socialism, or democracy. The optimist in me sees it as testimony to the robustness of India's economic awakening. In the normal course of events, India will grow out of the morass of injustice and corruption portrayed in the novel -- as the U.S. continues to evolve from Sinclair Lewis's grim description of early twentieth century life here -- hopefully without violence.he optimist in me sees it as testimony to the robustness of India's economic awakening.

B0013FSL3E|1.0|I've ordered, and now returned, two copies of this DVD in the past couple of weeks (October 2011). Each DVD's shipping package was in great condition, however both discs were in crushed/flattened DVD boxes. I can't speak about the quality of the discs themselves, because I refused to break the shrink wrap to open (and do not desire to own) crushed DVD boxes. Regardless, the present listing description does not accurately reflect, nor does the present listing price excuse, the inferior quality of the present product.
0062068423|5.0|Jo Nesbo tries and largely succeeds in blurring the lines between crime fiction and literary fiction. There is murder and police and something like a procedural in The Redbreast, but this Norwegian writer is plumbing the depths of individual psyche and also political consciousness.<br /><br />Most good crime fiction tries to do this, but some succeeds more than others. I had gotten bogged down in a first go at Redbreast because the hero, Harry Hole, disappeared from the early pages as the author developed a back story set in 1944 on the Eastern Front.<br /><br />So I started over in a more receptive frame of mind and let the back story play at its own rhythm. It is of course vital for understanding the action set in contemporary Oslo. It is something of a challenge to an English reader because the unusual Norwegian names, while not as bad as Russian, are difficult to hold onto. It is further complicated by the fact that characters have similar names, names similar to their birthplaces, nicknames, identity switches and, one begins to suspect, multiple personality disorders.<br /><br />Nesbo lays out his plot in a leisurely but well-paced manner. Harry remains largely sympathetic, though he does rub you the wrong way sometimes. There are more murders, including a nasty philanderer who messed with the wrong woman at the wrong time and one victim whose murder is still left partly unsolved at the end of the novel -- a thread to be continued no doubt in the next installment in the series.<br /><br />These Nordic crime novels do convey the curious charm of Scandinavia, these northern countries that are a fascinating blend of European culture and frontier ruggedness. Can spring feel so good without the rigors of a dark, cold winter? Oslo and Norway, more so than Stockholm and Sweden, carry those echoes of Vikings and Atlantic harshness.<br /><br />Like Stieg Larsson in his Dragon Tattoo series set in Sweden, Nesbo is fascinated by Norway's Nazi past and neo-Nazi present. Dark undercurrents of fascism run through Norwegian society then, during the war, and now. Even Americans who know what Quisling means are probably unaware that he was a Norwegian official who headed the collaborationist government during the Nazi occupation of Norway. The Norwegian resistance, in Nesbo's portrayal, was a feeble movement that gained mythic proportions only after the Nazi defeat.<br /><br />All of this creates a rich environment of conspiracy and political betrayal that lends impetus to the narrative in Redbreast. A full cast of well-drawn characters, not one but two love stories, a villain who is evil but still arouses a touch of sympathy, some nail-biting suspense, murder and gore -- it's all here in a well-written and well-translated 521-page package.society then, during the war, and now.

B00454U1O2|3.0|I ordered this CD for one song and one song only - the Perfect one.  I wanted the clean version because when I heard this song on the radio, I immediately thought it was exactly what I wanted to say to my kids, so of course I wanted them to listen to it.  Not that they aren't familiar with curse words, in this day and age, but it didn't add anything and why flaunt it without purpose.  So, I ordered the album.  The song sounds exactly like someone played it at the same time they recorded it, and just blipped out the curse word.  There are stretches of obvious blank space.  I know I've heard a clean version on the radio and I assumed that was also what I would be getting.  The real question is - why isn't it the same song??  I believe what I purchased was a brand new copy.  I wonder if others have found this to be the case as well.  Other than this, and it's a biggie because remember that one song was my WHOLE reason for buying the CD, it's a great album.  There's only one song I don't care for quite as much - where the dad leaves and it's the mom's fault.  Given my past experience, I don't like hearing that because the dad left due to huge character flaws and the mom stayed. But that's a personal opinion.  I love the CD and play it all the time - along with Adele - and I would give it 10 stars if the Perfect song was the same as the radio, no curse words but also no long, obvious silent periods - and one or two times the word is cut out, so it's clear something wasn't handled quite right on this CD.
0061537969|5.0|This was literally one of the best books I have read EVER!  It made me laugh, it made me cry, it made me want to scream at times.  It was a wonderful roller coaster of emotions--better then watching a movie.  If you are a pet lover, or even if you are not this is a book I think every type of person could find some enjoyment out of.  Its dramatic but with a happy ending...my favorite type.

B001V9LPWQ|5.0|A wonderful classic.  The quality of the blu-ray is exceptional.  I still have a VHS copy and it looks as though it was made the same time as the movie, but this disk is wonderful.  I like the added touch of the Disney view.  It sort of adds to the theater look.<br />The added bonuses are great too.  Dopey's wild Mine Ride is a lot of fun and my 2 year old grandson loves it.  Although we have figured everything out, he still wants to watch it every time.  The sing a long is fun also.<br />I highly recommend this version to all.  What better way to improve your collection with a timeless classic.

B003O86FMW|5.0|As the second book in The Hunger Games series, Catching Fire picks up right where The Hunger Games ended.  Victors Katniss & Peeta have returned to District 12 for what they predict to be a life of ease, however things are not as they seem.<br /><br />Their controversial actions in winning The Hunger Games have sparked a sort of rebellion and hope among the Districts against the Capitol and President Snow has it out for Katniss for instigating the rebellion.<br /><br />With the Quarter Quell (a Hunger Games of special circumstances that happens every 25 years) approaching, events unfold that shock the characters and of course the reader a like.  This Hunger Games will be like any other Hunger Games before.  This time, they will send victors into the arena. And again, only one can win.

0439023521|5.0|When I first got this book, I put off reading if for months.  I knew it was popular, but I didn't really know what it was about, nor did I think I would like it.  I was COMPLETELY wrong.  I couldn't put it down and was reading it in class, on the bus & staying up late.<br />Suzanne Collins has formulated a story that you can't help but want to read.  The Capitol (the controlling government) has set up a plot to keep the Districts (like States) in line and avoid uprising.  Each year, every district must sacrifice two of their children to The Hunger Games, who are \\"reaped\\" through a public drawing of their names.<br /><br /> The concept of The Games is simple.  Only one can survive.<br /><br />The competitors must play up their skills, form short-lived alliances, and use their knowledge of the land to survive.  Oh, and they have to kill all the others, because that's how it works: for one to survive, the others must die.<br /><br />This \\"competition\\" is a form of entertainment for the people in the Capitol, and viewing is forced on the districts, who supply everything to the Capitol citizens so they can have cushy lives, as a reminder of what the Capitol could do to them if they were to rise up against the Capitol.<br /><br />Be warned now. This is an addictive series. If you read the first one, you're going to want to read them all!

B004VF68AQ|3.0|This is a competent album.  The songs are decently written and very well executed.  And that's why it's getting only three stars. Because while this album might be seen as a totally awesome release by almost any other band, Jane's Addiction issued it and it just doesn't stand up to the greatness of Nothing's Shocking or Ritual de lo Habitual.  Perhaps I am holding them up to an unfair standard (keep that in mind when reading the rest of this review).  What was striking about their first two efforts was their willingess to push the throttle until the train went completely off the rails.  There were more than a few songs on those albums where they never got control of things and the results weren't so good.  But when they did somehow get things back on track, the results were magic (Mountain Song, Pigs in Zen, Stop, Three Days).  Additionally, many of the songs on those albums featured some of the best guitar work I've ever heard, both in terms of riffs that held a song together as well as more focused solo work which was seemlessly integrated into the songs.    Unfortunately, these two key aspects are largely missing in The Great Escape Artist.  This is a \\"safe\\" Jane's Addiction album in which few serious chances are taken.  I suppose the best analogy is to what Metallica has become since their Cliff Burton days.  Or perhaps Velvet Revolver (from the ashes of early GNR and Stone Temple Pilots).  Competent songs with some decent melodies.  But nothing really pushing the envelope.    The second shortcoming is the deemphasis of Dave Navarro's role relative to their first two albums.  Yes, he has some good riffs that are the basis of a few songs (Underground and End to the Lies come to mind).  But the few focuses on solo work sound understated to me and often sound like they were shoe-horned into the songs because a solo of some sort was expected and not because it naturally fit into the song.  Come to think of it, most of the songs on this album fall into the familiar verse-chorus-verse-chorus-solo (perhaps)-chorus model that is so typical of formulaic rock songs.  Contrast this to something like Pigs in Zen, when not 30 seconds into the song Navarro starts wailing off on some tangent that would be the crowning achievement of many guitarists' careers (but which is only a little side trip in that song).  Or Three Days, which had me wondering what the hell was coming next when I first heard it.    All of this negativity having been said, I am still pleased with my purchase.  It's not like they came out with a slow jazz disc.  There are some decent melodies on the disk and, as a long time fan, I am curious to see what Perry and Co. can continue to come out with.  Underground and End to the Lies are pretty good harder tracks that feature some good guitar riffs.  Curiosity Kills is about the only song I can easily recall from memory note for note (great bass line and beat).  And I'll Hit You Back has a pretty good melody and beat.  While this is also a good purchase for those new to Jane's, it is really just a small taste of the greatness they are capable of (see their first two albums for a better representation).

B0055V6EZE|5.0|Anyone who is familiar with Laurie in Jeeves and Wooster knows that he can play some piano.  In this album he proves that he can make a really good and entertaining song collection with the best of them.  I disagree with those who rip his voice.  They may not realize that Laurie is English if they only know him as House.  It's one thing to talk with a different accent, another entirely to sing in a different accent and a distinctive regional accent at that.  This is a great album to play on the road.  I saw his performance at San Francisco's fantastic Hardly Strictly Bluegrass free concert in early October 2011.  His commentary between songs was done in his natural accent and, combined with some fine music, was a delight for a mid afternoon.
B00466HN86|5.0|The folks from Sherwood Pictures have been putting out some great movies of late, such as Fireproof and Facing the Giants.  This one tops them all though, in my opinion.  You will not be sorry you watched this movie.<br /><br />The acting is definitely not Hollywood standard, but it is good.  The story is gripping and emotional.  The action is fantastic.<br /><br />Our society is in dire need of courageous men who will take responsibility for their actions and lead their families.  This movie is a call for that kind of courage.<br /><br />As a husband and father of four, as well as a pastor, I was challenged to take my role as a Father more seriously and to equip the men of our church to also be that kind of a man. I was encouraged to help my two sons be the men that God created them to be.<br /><br />Thank you, Sherwood Pictures, for giving us something wholesome to watch that is also entertaining and life-changing.

0439023513|3.0|Having just completed the entire series in less then 3 days you could easily say I was fascinated with the books. I couldn't hardly put them down and was drawn into the plot. That is until the third book.  When I started the first book I said to myself, finally a strong heroine thats not too stupid to live or incapable of taking care of herself. Her inital strength and resiliancy even in the face of all the opression and hardship was uplifting. Katniss was less then perfect which made it even better, I envisioned her growing and becoming the face of the revolution, just not the mouth piece puppet for it.  Without going into much detail as to not ruin the whole book (which really if you have stuck with the series up to this point you had just as well see it through)I found the book a bit of an anti climax. I understand what Katniss went through would haunt her, it would change her in alot of ways. The one thing I didn't expect was her almost recession from being a strong willed survivor to a fragile, cowering (at times), shell of the warrior she once was. I was fighting for her to become the woman that would lead and not just act for the revolution. She spent far too much of her time hiding away from everyone and everything, allowing herself to be used by so many people and in my opinion, becoming a literal \\"Mockingjay\\". She was nothing more then a well trained bird parroting what she was told. Now don't get me wrong, she did break through so of that, just not to the extent her first character showed promise for in the previous books.  I was left with a bad taste with the way Katniss' and Gale's relationship ended, there was no closure there for me. For me, it just seemed cold and unfinished in so many ways. I knew who she would end up with pretty early on but I expected more from the final goodbye as well as when she obviously made her choice. Endings are a big thing for me in a book (as I am sure it is for most readers), no matter how poorly a book starts or if itfaulters in the plotline, it needs a strong ending that gives me closure on issues and this one just left too many open sores.   I loved the first book, liked the second, tolerated the third.
B005I64U5C|2.0|The volume on the audio is ridiculously bad. Played this on my new 3D laptop and the sound was barely loud enough for me to hear the dialogue. What do the laptop makers want, the viewer to wear earphones with 3D glasses? Jesus! They are idiots.  MicroSoft and the DVD makers are morons. They should know the sound on Blu-Ray is not worth a damn in Windows. And basically the same for the sound levels on Blu-Ray players on 3D TVs too. What the hell do these crooks want, a consumer to run out and buy a sound system for their poorly and crookedly engineered discs?  The DVD makers should make the sound artificially louder so the audio can be heard. It is easier to turn the volume down then turn it up.  The picture is fine. The sound is lousy. All these Blu-Ray discs have lousy sound. Plus, Blu-Ray is hardly any sharper visually than regular DVDs. 3D can be put on regular DVDs too. The 3D plastic film and paper glasses work just as well as a 3D Blu-Ray disc as far as the 3D is concerned.  The 3D is not in your face in the Green Latern either when it should be. They need to make em in your face or they are useless.  They deserve to go bankrupt.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I stumbled upon this book in my search for novels that feature strong heroines, Katniss fits the bill (at least in this book). The author does an incredible job building a world so different and yet so similar to our own, you can easily see it being the future of our very own country. It's thought provoking on many levels and enticing. I couldn't put it down and finished it in less then 24 hours, it made me eager for more at the turn of every page. This is probably one of my favorite books of all time now! I will say the rest of the trilogy, especially the ending, is a bit disappointing. After this first book I had my hopes so high for the rest of the books but was left a bit disheartened to say the least. Never the less, this first book was a stroke of brilliance and I will be eager to see the movies take on it.
031261246X|5.0|This book is well written and chilling in it's message: Don't rely on technology!  Written by one of the world's top Microsoft gurus, certainly not just for nerds..  Think of The Davinci Code, throw-in some cyber terrorism and female distractions for our hero and you will be on the right track..   Some of the scenarios made my blood run cold - things described in this book could be happening now!  This book will be one that defines the times we live-in - a modern classic - read it!

B004QZ9PLU|3.0|I'm also a huge Nicholas Sparks fan, but, this is definitely not my favorite novel.  VERY slow to start, didn't draw me in as quickly as his other novels have.  It's still very typical Sparks, not bad, but definitely not his best..the title is a little ironic.  If you're a huge Sparks fan as I am, you'll still enjoy the book, only wish there was a little more to the story.  Agree with another reviewer who commented that Dawson's relatives - the villians in the story - were cartoonish caracters...so stereotypical they would have been better left out and more concentration on the relationship between Amanda and Dawson.  I think I would have liked the novel more had they been left out.
0711986746|1.0|It's rare that I never finish a book, but this is one of those cases.  The book is more about the author than Mercury . . . I did this and I did that, and I got the hair brushes for the band members.  It's (poorly) written dialy-planner style - no insight into Mercury's emotions, feelings or thoughts.  I could not finish this book. Simply terrible.
B002SJIO5E|5.0|No joke, it's good.  Inspired even in some places.  I would give a pinky toe for a sequel.  It set one up so well.  Here's hoping.  Good writing, acting, plotline, and wonderful setting.  It feels incredibly real.    Treat yourself to this.

B000BW7QWW|5.0|Joss Whedon has created a masterpiece with Serenity/Firefly. The movie is better than the series.....and that says a lot. The movie has the perfect balance of action, drama, comedy, and special effects. It blows the new Star Wars prequals away, and was filmed on probably less than half the budget.  One great thing about the movie is how you care for the crew. Throughout the movie you care for the characters. It was a great addition to the Firefly story and I really hope someday that Joss Whedon comes to his senses and makes a second one. I know he said that there aren't any plans to, but there is so much more to be told. I definitely recommend this to any fan of sci-fi action.
0143119788|4.0|I bought this as a gift. It arrived right on time and was sealed. It was brand new as advertised. What more can i say? [[ASIN:1427608954 The Stork Market: America's Multi-Billion Dollar Unregulated Adoption Industry]]
B004HSMPT0|5.0|An excellent read - I just couldn't put it down and bought about four copies as presents for friends.  There are numerous great reviews here so I won't duplicate what's already said so often and so well.  One of the reasons I was so taken by this story was that I was naive enought to have believed Robert's claim that the story was true in all details. As time passed it gradually dawned on me that Robert doesn't let the truth get in the way of a good story and that his numersous escapes from death and the fact that just about everybody else of consequence in the story was dead at the end are all a bit far fetched.......... or at the very least enhanced and glorified with wonderful writing.  Robert was a self confessed cheat, liar, criminal and quasi terrorist type who befriended gangsters and all sorts of low life. He finished the book changed but ready to go on to the next adventure.  Why should we believe such a person is telling the truth?  He so often glorifies criminality with the finest word-smithing.  It's still an excellent read but consume it with a pinch of salt. He cured me a little of my naivety.
B001EAWMGA|5.0|This is one of the better movies I've seen in a while (theatrical releases included). The characters are rich, not forced into stereotypes (e.g., the jealous rival). The extended backstory is revealed in manageable bits that add to rather than detract from the suspense. Plus, Jim Caveziel, Jack Huston, Sophia Miles, Ron Perlman, and John Hurt - how bad can it really be? Take a risk and rent this - you won't be disappointed.
B000FC1AGG|5.0|Really enjoyed this book.  Was pretty unpredictable for me, so it was fun and not typical like other books.  Laughed out a lot a few times.  I think I liked it better than her Shopaholic series.
B005DBFZQU|5.0|After his Mozart, Bach, Schubert and Beethoven cycles, Andras Schiff continues his exploration of Schumann. The pianist seems to have privileged cyclic performances of the important piano works. Faithful to his attempt to constantly provide listeners with a well informed view of the works he interprets, Schiff gives a chronological narration of Schuman's work from Papillons to the mysterious and at times lugubrious Ghost Variation\\", composed before Schumann's attempted suicide. Following his highly praised \\"In Concert' album\\", this recital includes Papillons op. 2, the Piano Sonata No 1 in F sharp minor op. 11, Scenes from Childhood op. 15, the Fantasy in C major op. 17, Forest Scenes op. 82, and the Thema mit Variationen.  What strikes me most at first in András Schiff's rendition is it's incisiveness. The texture of the works has never been so evident for me. Schiff gives Schumann's music a rare transparency. In this vein, Fantasy in C is played with such unexpected clarity of lines that it seems lighter than ever. All the works are played according to this approach. They are thoughtful and carefully detailed as if they were informed by his Bach reading.  Nonetheless, the tension never ceases to inhabit this live performance. Fantasy in C is one of the finest and most moving (compare with wonderful Pollini's performance) interpretations. Schiff might surprise at the end of the work making it sound more personal that in the familiar version. Habitual reproaches of coldness or detachment are difficult to maintain here. Listen how, In Schiff's hands, the F sharp minor Sonata becomes much more introspective than usual. Overall, it's a convincing rendition, poignant at times without ever showing excessive pathos (compare with Hewitt's splendid albums).   Pursuing his reinvestigation of Schumann, Schiff has already led me to rediscover overplayed works with new ears (Kreisleriana,) and incited me to include other ones such as Humoresque, Nachtstucke, Novelleten in my listening habits. In Schiff's hand, they all seem to me are worthy pieces of the romantic repertoire. This well recorded double album is very insightful and places Schiff as an unparalleled Schumann interpret. All lovers of Schumann music should let them tempted by this set.
0446547654|3.0|Bought this book for a change for me and was slightly disappointed.  The first half of the book, he could have condensed to fifty pages.  I kept saying 'get on with it'.  Entirely too descriptive with a 'sadly' ending.  Could I recommend that you spend at least $15 to buy this book, a bit less on Kindle, No!  Wait for paperback.
0316056863|5.0|This book made me laugh so hard.  My children were watching TV at one point and my daughter told me how they needed to turn up the volume if I was going to laugh so much!  I love reading about other peoples lives and getting a peak into what makes them tick and what made them who they are.  I was reminded of Billy Crystal's 700 Sundays book while i was reading.  Partially because both Fey and Crystal work in comedy and also because of how they include their families in their writing.<br /><br />I've never watched 30 Rock, it isn't that I think I wouldn't like the show, I just don't watch a lot of TV in general.  When we moved six years ago we decided to forgo cable.  After two or three years we decided to get it again because we could bundle the phone, int4ernet and cable together so we've had it for three or four years, but the break from being able to tune in got me out of the habit of watching much of anything and I've tried to be sparing in what I decide to watch.  If our cable had better On Demand features I would probably watch more on my own time line, but it doesn't.  Same with SNL, I've seen episodes here and there but I've never been a regular viewer.  So why did I want to read this book?  I really think Tina Fey is funny and I loved her in Date Night.  The book did not disappoint!<br /><br />It really takes talent to find the comedy in every day events and make them funny.  I can't even tell jokes very well because if I think something is really funny I tend to get the giggles before I finish the joke.  I do get people to laugh, but they are laughing at (or maybe with) me because I am laughing so hard.  At this point I've given up on even trying to tell jokes, which makes me appreciate people who can so much more!<br /><br />In discovering Summer Theater Fey became friends with a number of gay people.  Her quote about her friends and gay people in general really made me laugh, \\" Gay people don't actually try to convert people.  That's Jehovah's Witnesses you're thinking of\\".

B0050SYS5A|3.0|I, like many other people here, had big problems with the Nyko Zoom. I want to make a review detailing my experience. I started with it not being able to pick up anything and not being able to even navigate menus. After letting it sit for a few days I decided to give it a go again. I made sure the Kinect was off and that the Zoom was off, then I calibrated it (even though it doesn't work in this tiny room). I turned the sensor bar off and then turned the 360 off. I put the Zoom back on, then fired everything back up and tuned the sensor bar again. It found my hands face and did the cool little grid of, \\"Hey I found your face and hands!\\" Then I attempted to play some games...  I put in Kinect Adventures and my 360 wanted me to update the game. I couldn't even navigate the menu for that. It has a grey background with two big options at the bottom, I tried everything. You can't even use the controller to select an option. I picked up the controller, hit B and it cancelled the update and let me into the game. It surprising worked after that. I was able to navigate the menus and play the games no problem. When the kinect took the stupid pictures of me they looked normal. I then put in Dance Central and was able to get through the tutorial and regular play of Poker Face with only one hiccup that was my fault (I stepped too far back). I would have played more but its 3:30 in the morning and I live on the third floor. Those are the only two games I own for the Kinect, I have Rise of Nightmares coming from Gamefly sooner or later and I may update.   The bad part, which I already alluded to, is that menus don't work well at all. Trying to navigate the Kinect portions of the dashboard was almost impossible and I had to stand almost directly in front of my TV. I can't sit on my couch (about 8 feet away from the kinect) and use it at all, it will not see me at all. I couldn't update either of my Kinect games and the calibration is a work-around at best. The facial recognition isnon-existent.   I'll note that my kinect is about 3 feet off the ground in front of my TV, I moved it from being about 6 1/2 feet off the ground on the wall behind the TV (which is where I couldn't get it to work at all). So my advice is, if you absolutely need this, its worth a try because it kinda works. If you can move furniture, just do that.
B002JVWR9U|5.0|My daughter and I have both enjoyed the series and now she has the season to watch over and over.

031606792X|5.0|The review that stated \\"Don't be fooled by the 5 star reviews\\" made me right my review.  This is actually my second favorite book from the series. I like Twilight best, but I really love Breaking Dawn. Is it sappy? Yes. Is Bella \\"perfect\\"? Yes Do things \\"not add up\\" Yes! But I like happy endings. This is nt real life. Real life is full of dissapointments if I am going to involve myself in fantasy I want it to be great.  As far as sex goes, these books are considered Young Adult, and I dont believe steamy sex scenes are appropriate for younger readers. If you are an adult reading Breaking Dawn - use your imagination. Every age group will come up with their own version of sex according to their age and experiences. As far as the other issues mentioned:  Pregnancy - Correct Bella never mentioned in the other 3 books she wanted to be a mother, but in Breaking Dawn says she never wanted to be a mother until she was pregnant. That has happened to people in real life also. The book is portraying \\"you will get pregnant the first time you have sex\\" That is not the impication. The book also portrays vampires and werwolves Do you think those exsist outside of fiction...  Wedding night - sex will hurt for the first time and your husband will regret it. OK again fiction she is having sex with VAMPIRE. This is no two humans - she is not equating it to a human marriage experience.  Bella as a newborn - Did you not read she had the gift of self control???  I could go on, but there is not need to fight. Everyone is entitled to their own opinion. I will now quote the review that inspired me to write this  \\"So, Bella gets everything she wants, including Edward, a baby, a family, immortality and tons and tons of sex? Check. Jacob has someone, even though she's 2 months old and it makes him a pedo? Check. The Volturi are defeated without actually engaging them in battle, causing the most depressing let-down in the history of potential battle scenes ever? Check. Sugar cakes and muffins and gummy bears rain from a glittering sky and Carebears run frolicking through the meadows of innocence as the final ending?\\"  Now without the snide comment about gummy bears I AGREE   I want Edward and Bella to live happily ever after CHECK I like happy endings CHECK reality is unfair fantasy is CHECK  Read the book and decide for yourself
0307454541|5.0|This is an exciting book.  It is also  violent, disturbing and thoughtful. I'm glad I read it, I saw it everywhere and wanted to see what the fuss was about. I'm not sure if I'll read the others. Too many books too little time!
B004FQX5CK|5.0|Great picture and sound on this Blu-ray release.  A excellent movie for any one's sci-fy collection, and well worth the money!
B004J4WKUQ|4.0|Awesome read, but perhaps for too narrow an audience. If you lived through the 80s as a teenager or adult, and loved the iconic TV shows, movies and videogames of the era, you will very likely LOVE this book. If not, your mileage may vary.<br /><br />The more of a videogame geek you were in the 80s (and maybe still are now, like me), the bigger kick you will get out of this book.  I very nearly gave it 5 stars.
B004VF68AQ|4.0|I never really listened to Jane's Addiction when they were popular -- I was (and still am) more alone the Stone Temple Pilots, Metallica, Anthrax, etc., vibe. But, as I've grown older over the years (approaching 38 in Nov 2011), my tastes have grown wide and far, though I still keep to my aggressive rock roots. Regardless of my history, I never was into JA for whatever reason -- but I saw (on Spotify) they had a new album, so I had a listen.  And I liked what I heard.  Not being a \\"fan\\" per se, I don't come to this release with any sense of being let-down by the band with some change in style or what have you. I simply approach this release as someone just discovering this band. And like I said, I enjoyed what I heard -- enough to buy the album.  Solid songs, great musicality, catchy riffs...I like what I hear. Is this the future of JA? Maybe so. Will this possible new direction alienate old skool JA fans? Maybe so. BUT, for those of us just starting out with JA, this album firmly sets them on my radar for future releases.
B005S7GT32|5.0|I have been a PG fan for many years, but have drifted away in recent years as my musical tastes have shifted to other areas and moods.  After browsing Amazon and stumbling upon this cd I decided to get reacquainted with Peter's music.  This disc delivers on every emotional level imaginable.  WoW!  The arrangements of his songs with the orchestra are stunning and simply inspiring.  It has affirmed my feeling that Peter Gabriel is a real musical gem and his songs speak to me in ways that other music seems to fall short.  His emotive voice just fills in all the empty spaces and makes me grin.  The guy is a genius.  One that I am rediscovering again with this cd.  It's a relaxing and emotional trip through some of his best songs.  Simply amazing.
B00005KBJK|5.0|When I was just 13 years old, we has a music teacher who kept talking about \\"Die Zauberflöte\\" but unfortunately never played any excerpts to us. So I decided to find out what it was all about, took all the pocket money I had saved and bought a good seat in our local opera house in Nuremberg. It was an overwhelming experience, the stage production was very good, something only the MET can afford nowadays. So I was introduced into the world of opera by one of the greatest works of all time. Since then I have become an opera lover and been visiting opera houses all over Germany and Austria.  \\"Die Zauberflöte\\" is still one of my favourite operas to which I can listen again and again without getting bored (the other one is \\"Don Giovanni\\"). This recording was made just when I had become an opera lover. To me it is still the best of all available recordings though others have their merits, too. The singers have been praised in previous reviews, they belong to the best Germany had to offer at that time.  Today they would all be world stars, but just after World War II an international career was difficult. I love them all. Joseph Greindl's voice is the lowest I have ever heard and Rita Streich, who was called the \\"German nightingale\\", has been unsurpassed. It is breathtaking how she manages the difficult coloraturas of the \\"Queen of the Night\\". I owe dozens of different recordings of these arias, but no other singer can match Streich. (Another great example of her wonderful voice is the Zerbinetta part in Richard Strauss' \\"Ariadne auf Naxos\\".) Ferenc Fricsay was considered the best Mozart conductor of his time and this recording is his definite legacy. Buy it and enjoy it.

B004QXJZXA|5.0|IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN LeMans, READ ON ... THIS SHOULD CLOSE THE DEAL FOR YOU  I just ordered my BlueRay copies of LeMans and Grand Prix.  Can't wait to get LeMans BLUE RAY VERSION, hope the audio distortion in some areas is fixed.  But ... this is about the car ...  42 years old.  I submit this is the greatest racing car ever ... in it's final 917/30 iteration, it raced, won and qualified with the following performance stats.  0-62 mph (100km/h) in 1.9 sec., 0-100 mph (160km/h) in 3.9 sec., 0-200 mph (320km/h)in 10.9 sec. and on up to a top speed in excess of 260 mph (420/km/h).  The engine was a flat 12 cyl air cooled 5.374 liter, twin turbo design.  at full boost, (\\"a simply astonishing 39 psi\\") it produced 1580 bhp for qualifying and raced at 1100 bhp. It came to the US and dominated the CanAm unlimited series, causing McLaren to go home.  In 1975 Mark Donohue took it around Talladega Super Speedway in Alabama with a closed course, land speed record of 221.160 mph, a record that went unbroken for 4 years.  This car could probably qualify for and win Indy against the current cars, qualify for and win any Nascar race including the SuperSpeedway restricter races and the road courses, beat all of the above in the quarter mile, go 300 plus mph at Bonneville and keep on, keepin on above 200 mph for 24 hours with only different tires and gear set for the Salt Flats. There were only 25 (50 chassis) made, few are left, but it will still blow the pants off the newest Styron and yah might find one for 2.5 million euros, new cost was 140,000 DM. Two were licensed for the road, No. 030 was issued Alabama lic. 61-27737  Check out a great write up at [...]  IF THIS DOESN'T ENCOURAGE YOU TO BUY THIS MOVIE, YOU WILL MISS THE BEAUTIFUL SOUNDING 917 AND THE RATTY SOUNDING 512 FERRRAI BLASTING THROUGH THE  MULSANNE WOODS AT 235 PLUS MPH.  ALL YOU WANT, NO STORY, NO BS, JUST UN-BELIEVEABLE RACE CARS FOR TWO HOURS ... NOW IN BLUE-RAY ... WOW  PS ... just remember when I say qualify,  Imean an 1875 lb. racecar with 1580 qualifying horsepower, 1000 plus horsepower more than Nascar and Indy cars.
B005MW5CWW|2.0|This album is entirely ok. not good, but not bad either. I found it to be very average and mediocre, nothing out of the ordinary. I'd say its a pretty archetypal hard rock/metal album. No real flares, no real character. Definitely lacks the personality of their previous records. This is what I thought was going to happen after they became the biggest metal band on the planet when Crack the Skye came out. Unfortunate, but at least they have three magnificent albums (the first three) and one that's very very great (Crack the Skye). This one is, I don't know its just ok.

0307474275|5.0|As I have said before, I am not an avid reader so for me to find a book that I truly enjoy is very rare. I first read this book which got me hooked on Dan Brown novels. I think he is a fantastic reader and does a great job at describing the story so you can create your own images in your mind.<br /><br />I recommend this book to anyone who doesn't love to read because this will be the type of book that you read in a few days (3 days for me! Very impressive for anyone who knows me).<br /><br />Give it a shot!
B00068CVJ4|2.0|Maybe I'll be drawn and quartered for this, but this is their weakest effort. Just because it had the \\"best\\" producer, biggest budget, and they had a cookie cutter three and a half minute song with a chorus sung 8,000 times on MTV doesn't mean this is an album of the decade. Honestly it took me three times before I could even get through the first half of this record. I found it that unimpressive. And still do. Its slightly above generic alt rock or whatever the hell MTV would label this as. If you're going to get any ATDI, please do yourself a favor and get Vaya and In/Casino/Out, then Acrobatic Tenements third. Actually, don't even bother with this one at all.
B004VF68AQ|1.0|I can't believe any true fan from the 80's would give this doorstop anything more than 3 stars. The only passable song I hear on here is \\"Immovable Force\\". I had to grab the booklet and check to see if Perkins and Navarro were still in the band. These rhythms are so straightforward that any radio band can pull this off. Perkins drumming is the most 'in the pocket' I've ever heard him - and that's NOT good. No experimentation, no polyrhythms, no Jane's. This just plays as any other cd you've heard that could be filler for any moment on the radio. The last song is the most rockin' but that is just an underwhelming end to a mediocre cd. Barely any guitar solos. I know lots of bands build and come up w/ song ideas in the studio but this sounds like no rehearsal time was given or much thought going into the song structure. Average music from a stellar band. And, please don't get me started on the album cover artwork. I know that Perry likes to build his sculptures but someone should have told him that this sucks! I burst out laughing in the store when I saw it. The album art reflects what you get inside. The Perry Farrell show instead of Jane's Addiction. This is one instance when you DO want to judge a book (or CD) by its cover!
B0055Q5F36|5.0|I bought this case for my AT&T SGS2 (i777).  It fits perfectly as other reviewers have noted already.  Some reviewers say they have had issues installing the screen protector, but I already had a screen protector on my phone so I didn't even use the one that came with it.  The case itself fits tightly on the phone and holds it securely.  The power button requires a hard press for the first few days after installing, but seems to settle into a normal pressure after 3 or 4 days.  I think this is the rubber material settling in & seems OK.  All ports (charging, headphones, speakers, camera) are aligned properly and this case fits the AT&T model nicely.  The bevel cut around the camera is done nicely as well.

I'm sure my granddaughters will get lots of use out of this, because it can be taken on road trips and vacations. Mommy & Daddy will be grateful for easy clean up and organization. I would recommend this size over the mini ZipBins. The minis are just too small to be useful. The graphics are also well done.

Thank you Keith.
B005NGKLX2|4.0|One reviewer's blurb said: \\"A classic old-fashioned western, every bit as good as 'Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid'.\\"  It is neither.  It should not even be compared to that film since it's only marginally in the same genre.<br /><br />There are many good things about \\"Blackthorn\\" -- Sam Shepard's acting, for instance.  The scenery is also excellent, albeit dully colored.  I would have chosen a better film stock.  Most of the colors seemed drab and lifeless to me.  That may be partially due to the generally overcast skies that were the norm in Bolivia - at least that appears to be the case when they were shooting this film.  But I believe that either the film they used did not reproduce the colors well or there was something wrong with the projector at the theater in which I saw it.  Yet even with the lack of color saturation, there were some spectacular vistas as our hero made his way across the country.  The director made excellent use of the widescreen format.<br /><br />Another interesting aspect of the movie was the back-story - the flashbacks to the early 1900's with Butch, Sundance, and Etta Place.  Those flashbacks provide a possible explanation as to how Butch and Sundance survived the infamous gun battle with the Bolivian army and why they split up.  Enough said about that. (No spoilers here.)<br /><br />I will mention that, historically speaking, while there is evidence of two American bandits being killed in a gun battle with a few soldiers (not an entire army) and a couple others from a small Bolivian town, later DNA evidence ruled out those bandits as being either Butch or Sundance.  Also, many people have stated they met with and/or knew Robert Leroy Parker (aka Butch Cassidy) after he moved back to the U.S. (using an alias, of course).<br /><br />But the story and the characters were rather bleak and left me feeling as cold as Blackthorn working his way through the high mountains of Bolivia with the young criminal who owed him money.<br /><br />I would recommend this film with reservations.  Don't go in expecting a fast-moving story with colorful, genial characters.  It is tense and somber.t go in expecting a fast-moving story with colorful, genial characters.  It is tense and somber.

B000C1YPY4|5.0|I had not previously been exposed to John Legend but kept hearing his name.  When I got an SACD player I decided to buy a few disks and check out the sound.  Holy cow, this is an awesome disk.  First of all, several of the songs are great.  A good sub-woofer is helpful, I had to turn mine down to get the sound just right.  The quality of the sound is unbelievable, lots of details.  The surround mix is one of the better ones that I have heard.  While it is in a totally different genre, I would rate the surround mix up there with Avalon, the better parts of Dark Side of the Moon and some of the Elton John releases.  Really a must buy for anyone with a decent sound system and an SACD player.  Wow!
1433503808|5.0|The ESV Study Bible is the best study Bible currently on the market. Alongside the English Standard Version as its text, the most accurate word-for-word translation to date, the thousands of study notes, charts, articles, and maps make this work a veritable library of biblical scholarship. One needs only to consult the list of theological contributors, a virtual \\"who's who\\" among contemporary scholars, to see that some of the best minds have collaborated to give the church this incredible gift in one volume. As a pastor, it is my desire to see this Study Bible come into the hands of every family in my church. I use it daily in the preparation of my sermons and expositions, and ethusiastically recommend it to anyone who is serious about doing studying the Scriptures.<br /><br />Matthew Everhard<br />Senior Pastor, Faith Evangelical Presbyterian Church<br /><br />Follow me on Twitter @matt_everhard
0385534639|5.0|visual masterpiece. beautifully written. wanted to be inside this story and witness the circus myself! the characters were unique and enjoyable to follow. sometimes the time frame was a little confusing, but loved it nonetheless.
B004X4QW42|5.0|Not often do sequels live up to the first movie so this was a real treat. The action was great and the martial arts were spectacular. Great story line and the cast was superb as always.
B000GH2YPG|5.0|classic story of a young girl marrying a mysterious man she barely knows. Complete with eerie characters and a lavish setting, this book left you asking question after question. Unfortunately, it dropped off with an open ending.
B003X5UFWW|5.0|Great cast, great action and amazing martial arts. I can watch this movie over and over. Bound to be a classic!
B000NH7SZ0|5.0|Can't say enough about this memory! Just put the memory into it's socket and my printer saw it right away. I would recommend this memory to anyone.
B0052GACNM|5.0|This Album is really really great! I think everyone will enjoy something about this album! I know I sure did!
B000008GS2|5.0|Man of colours was one of my Favourite albums back in the 80s. It has many great songs. It was extremely hard to find on CD and I was lucky to get a copy here. There are many wonderful songs like Crazy, Electric blue, Heartbreak kid, My obsession, Nothing to serious and of course Man of colours. I highly recommend this album.
B002T836XE|4.0|Gave a listen to some of the audio samples & decided to pick this up. Next step will be to burn the audio files to a set of CD's to play in my home & pickup truck CD players. Samples seem to be good so why not?   Of course I recently found a 7 disc stereo LP box set of the symphonies only without all the extra pieces included in the Amazon offering. It doesn't say that it's a live recording anywhere on the box or the Phillips (Holland) record labels so I'll just have to play it to see whether any of the symphonies in that set are the exact same recordings as whats offered here on Amazon. It might be an earlier studio recording of Haitink with the LSO instead. Who knows? Only to find out is to play it. Speaking of playing, I plan to enjoy this Amazon offering once I burn it to a set of audio CD's....  11/11/11 Update. Well I'm playing the 1976 Phillips LP box set & it doesn't sound like they are live recordings however it's still some nice recordings. Gave a liaten to a pair of the symphonies from this digital download & it's a completely different set of quite good recordings. I don't think you'll be disappointed if you bought & downloaded this set as I really like it. Hopefully you will too.
B000RIWAVW|5.0|Halloween.... A marvel of it's time and yet people disliked it when it first came out... but then it sort of grew on them as fast as an infectious craving that keeps you wanting more and more!<br /><br />Plot: Halloween, 1963.... A seventeen year old woman named Judith Myers was stabbed to death by her six year old brother Michael Myers... Now, 15 years later he has come home to attack his sister (Laurie Strode) and her friends! But the only person who knows of the real threat is Michael's Doctor (Dr. Samuel Loomis) from when he was locked up in an asylum (But alas he broke out). The doctor must alert anyone who has control or who will at least listen!<br /><br />Review: With his $320,000 budget, John Carpenter and Debra Hill came up with a great idea and turned it into a masterpiece! This film has pretty much everything, spellbinding music, a great cast, intense and horrific atmosphere, a mean concept and a Helluvalot more! The film itself has a great back story followed by a long, drawn out middle and end that really works well for the motion picture! The film has absolutely no gore but that's the beauty of it... its atmosphere and suspense makes up for it all! This in my opinion is the best holiday horror movie of the 70's next to Black Christmas (1974) and I also believe that this has the one of the best conclusions to a movie I have ever seen. Just the fact that you know that he his still on the prowl sends shivers up my spine!<br /><br />Acting: Jamie Lee Curtis and Donald Pleasance stole the show.... Jamie adds screams that will stick with the audience for a very long time and Donald shows us how determined and crazy a man can go to protect as many people as he possibly can!<br /><br />Gore: A man is pinned to the wall with a kitchen knife, a woman is stabbed to death (some blood), an off-screen slit throat, and a strangulation..... In my mind I agree with a lot of people when they say that \\"gore is the aftermath of violence\\" and a movie with violence but without gore makes it even creepier in some ways!<br /><br />Bottom Line: Intense, creepy, and downright evil... This is one of many kinds of movies but I still believe it is one of the best slasher flicks of all time... This ranks along Psycho (1960) any day!<br /><br />Suggested MPAA: Rated: \\"R\\" for intense sequences of terror and violence, thematic elements, and brief drug use<br /><br />Is it worth the Buy on a scale of 1-10: 10 (Depends which version you buy, I prefer the 2007 DVD version (and no I do not mean the remake which came out the same year)<br />For the Movie itself on a scale of 1-5: 5<br /><br />P.S. I made an awesome music video for this, the title is called \\"Halloween 1978 Music Video Using a Song by Rob Zombie\\" and it is on Youtube.. Enjoy :)ways!

B00027JYLC|5.0|FREAKS<br /><br />One of the most unique films ever to be produced was Freaks.  It is quite possible that no other film in the history of horror provoked as much controversy as did Freaks.  It was cut to sheds by the studio, banned from many theaters, thrown into obscurity for decades, and was the catalyst for ending director Todd Browning's career.  Yet, the movie has not one monster, or murderer, or drop of blood.  No paranormal activities or demonic possession.  Instead, Browning cast real freaks in his movie side by side with supposedly normal people in what is a masterpiece of horror.<br /><br />The film takes place among the inhabitants of a carnival, particularly Hans and Frieda.  These two lovebirds are the star midgets of the carnival, but another star, beautiful Cleopatra--a big person--is after Hans' money and seduces him with the intention of acquiring some of that money.  When Cleopatra learns Hans' fortune is extremely vast, she devises a plan to marry and then poison Hans.<br /><br />The story is interesting, but the real story is with the freaks.  They are a varied group including a bearded lady, Siamese twins, human torsos lacking limbs, microcephalics, and more.  Society sees these people as freaks, invalids, mental defectives, better to be locked away from the eyes of good, honest citizens than allowed to travel freely.  Indeed, this attitude is the cause that has bound the freaks together into their own tightly knit community.  The outside world shuns and degrades them, and so, they have created their own society, one where loyalty, cooperation, and fraternity are of absolute importance.<br /><br />Even within the circus the freaks are ridiculed and taunted by most of the normal members.  Nobody takes them seriously and the freaks are frequently abused verbally.  The freaks take these injuries with a grain of salt.  They even make an exception and declare their intentions to accept Cleopatra as one of them when she weds Hans in the wedding feast scene that is easily the best part of the entire movie.  But when things go badly and Hans becomes ill, the freaks go into high gear.  They establish a surveillance of Hans and Cleo, and when their suspicions about her intentions turn true, they quickly go into action to protect Hans and punish Cleo and her lover, the strongman Hercules.<br /><br />Besides the fascinating scenes that showcase the individual freaks in the movie, scenes that explore not just the physical deformities they posses, there are also many scenes that spotlight the freaks special abilities and normalcies.  We see how Prince Randian, born without arms or legs, lights a cigarette.  Lacking arms doesn't stop one from eating and drinking just as one with arms would.  All enjoy lives that are considerably more normal than most.  Perhaps even more delightful is just how kind and helpful the freaks are to each other.<br /><br />The point the film makes is terrific.  The freaks display more human attributes than the normal folks of the circus.  Despite their limitations, they band together to fight back against Cleopatra and Hercules in order to protect Hans and enact revenge against these two despicable individuals.  By the end, the passive, almost laughable freaks transform into strong, fearsome beings.  Do not take them for granted, for once crossed, the freaks will exact terrible revenge.<br /><br />It sounds silly, but Freaks really got people going when it was released.  The film was cut from 90 minutes to 60.  Mot of the footage is lost, including the finale that was particularly gruesome.  People cringed when they saw this film.  One woman claimed to have miscarried after she saw it the images were so horrible.  I think Browning makes a great point with the film.  People were horrified not by graphic violence or sexuality, but rather by normal people.  That's a concept to think about.f the entire movie.

B00425S1H8|5.0|We received new laptops in our office, but our older Garmin (tm) GPS units could not connect due to not having any 9 pin ports available. We could have bought a similar adapter at a local electronics store (at $45 a piece!) or upgraded to newer GPS units. When I found these adapters I figured what the heck and bought two of them to try. Set-up was a breeze and since I had bought two of them for less than half of the price of one adapter at the local electronics store, I was the star of the office. Highly recommended as I doubt if you will find a better product for the price.
1439156816|5.0|I first read \\"On Writing\\" o/a January, 2004 when Calliope was quietly whispering in my ear, beckoning me I suppose to take up writing after a decades-long hiatus.  I read it again last week while Calliope was screaming in my ear, having prompted me to write a novel, start on several others and undertake some short stories.  It seems now that the writing bug, in the guise of a muse, will not let go.  Hence, my first reading of SK's work was entertaining whereas the second reading was educational and instructive but not from a scholastic or academic perspective, which I suspect would not have pleased King anyway.  Rather, the book provides an insight into the life of just one author, certainly unlike any other author, but shows some common traits with all authors.  Meanwhile, the same can be said about the uniqueness of any other author's story as well.  The value in \\"On Writing\\" to at least aspiring writers is his honesty and matter-of-fact approach to the hurdles, personal and professional that, I daresay, all writers face, from the pen ... uh, keyboard ... of someone who knows whereof he speaks.  Still, after the last page, aspiring authors will gain renewed hope which prompted them to pick up the book in the first place and accomplished authors may be reminded, by some of King's passages, why they hear the muse.
B005F44X36|2.0|Even with the exchange rate you'd be better off ordering this package - and it's a real fanboy must-have package for the completist - from Amazon UK. Works out at about $420. Stil ludicrous for what you get, but if you desperately want it...

B003Y5H5C4|4.0|\\"Chet, if I don't get to the money in time this thing's gonna blow.\\" Dwayne (McBride) and Nick (Eisenberg) have different lives but they both feel the same way about them. Dwayne is sitting around waiting for his dad to die so he can get the inheritance money. When a stripper tells him she can find a guy to kill him, his life changes. Rather then getting his hands dirty he forces pizza delivery driver Nick to do it for him, by putting a bomb on his chest. Contrary to what the plot of the film is, this is very, very funny. The combination of two clueless people forcing two clueless kids to rob a bank is hilarious and very fun to watch. Eisenberg is back in \\"Zombieland\\" form, and McBride is the funniest he has ever been. The supporting cast adds a lot to the movie, and there really isn't a dull moment in this movie. Most comedies lately try to add to much heart (where it doesn't need it) and it takes away from the laughs. This one plays more like a \\"Seinfeld\\" type, where everyone is mean and rude to everyone else, and that is what makes it so much fun. It doesn't try to be something it's not. Overall, the rare type of recent comedy that makes you laugh all the way through. I give it an A-.<br /><br />*Also try - Your Highness & Zombieland
B00436GNVC|5.0|I love every song in this album. Duffy cames to my attention on her song SMOKE WITHOUT FIRE in movie AN EDUCATION.  The recording is very good. I felt she is singing in front of me. The instrumentations are excellent. The song styles varies from track to track.
B005JU5JTI|1.0|If I could give this .01 of a star, I would. This was by far one of the worst movies I've ever seen. The characters had no personality, the story line had no point, the ending made no sense, skipping from one thing to another and I found it so boring I actually fell asleep about 45 minutes in. Cameron Diaz's character was so vulgar and such a B&$%# I found myself wanting to punch her in what seemed to be this movies center of attention,(her chest). Don't let the all star cast fool you. This isn't the product of bad acting, but bad writing. Very bad writing. This possibly could have been a good movie with a little more effort from the writer and director. Instead it just turned out to be 97 minutes of my life that I will never get back. The only character who actually got a smile out of me was Jason Segel's,(the gym teacher), but in the end it was just that, a smile. Huge disappointment...I'm really peeved I spent money on this.
B004UQPM4E|5.0|This collection is a must have for any fan of the Man of Steel.  Seeing this films in stunning HD picture quality and sound is unlike anything you have seen before.  With Superman and Star Wars on Blu-ray, the decision to upgrade has already been made!
0156027321|4.0|Life of Pi is one of the most diverse books, I have ever read from the beginning it seemed to be a dull book about an Indian boys abnormal life. Then as the second part of the book progressed I started to relive a lot of the first part of the book as it foreshadowed and reflected on things in the second part. From the moment the Tsimtsum sank I found myself hooked.  As I read, I was astounded by the bravery of the young zookeeper's son, and his ability to be thrown overboard and to survive on a small life boat with a Bengal tiger.  I wanted to know how he could do this and I therefore continued to read.  I found some parts gruesome and graphic others astonishing and then some that were terrifying.  There were definitely parts in the book that didn't make me want to go on a boat anytime soon.  I like to put myself into the positions of the characters and think whether I could do what they did.  I certainly could not do what Pi did.  I found the ending a bit frustrating and confusing.  Overall it was an intriguing book about one boy's struggle for survival with nothing but the Pacific, a tiger, and God.
0805047905|5.0|I read this book on a near daily basis to my baby.  She loves the sounds, colors, and rhythm of the words.  It's a classic and must-have for any young child's library.  Our favorite animal character is \\"purple cat, purple cat.\\"
B000002KK2|5.0|One of the greatest female singer songwriters of all time.the 70's were a great time for female singer songwriters Joni Mitchell Carly Simon i could go on forever. I knew a few songs from the radio before i discovered Rickie but a few songs don't tell the whole story!Rickie is at the top of the list of great singer songwriters she has one of the sweetest voices ever and writes great melodies with great acoustic guitar and piano on her songs and great muscianship.the best songs on this album to me are not the big hits Chuck E In Love or Youngblood which i love are the only songs from Rickie that were ever on fm radio.the other songs Last Chance Texaco and Nighttrain should of been big hits great singing incredible hooks and Coolsville which is a live favorite and Rickie still performs live are the standouts.there are also songs that were covered by other artists like Easy Money.this is the best album Rickie ever released.the other albums have some great songs on them Pirates and Flying Cowboys the best of her albums after this one that i reccomend to anyone getting into Rickie, but none of the albums are as great a listen as this whole album no bad songs at all .you can't go wrong with this album I give this one 5 stars
0307454541|2.0|*Spoiler Alert*<br />I did not appreciate the fact that the girl with the dragon tattoo was brutally raped and then just a few weeks later (or less) was coming on to a journalist her father's age. Women seemed to just throw themselves at this man (the journalist who is the protagonist of the story) and no woman seemed to require any sort of hint of commitment from him. I bought the book because I had read it was intended to be a feminist work of fiction intended to speak out against violence against women. The brutal rapes, the horrific sexual torture and mutilation described in enough detail, and the fact that all of the women in the story seemed emotionally disconnected from sex made me feel this was less a feminist work than a man's fantasy world. I will not be reading the other books in the trilogy.
B0018RVJWM|5.0|I thought it was a great book! It was heart jolting story of survival between a boy of 16 named Pi, and a 450 pound Royal Bengal Tiger named Richard Parker. It was really good. Just how Martel wrote how Pi got his food and how he trained RP and how he recovered. I would recommend this story to all young adults, and children who love to read!
B0054JELS4|5.0|This is for the NCIS junkie, for sure. Great set purchased at a great price. I jumped on the NCIS bandwagon late in the series, and I have been DVR'ing the shows for quite a while now, which kind of stunk because they don't replay them in order. This set takes care of that issue, and I can free up the DVR for other shows now.
B00536OCZA|2.0|I bought this at my local record store and was pretty excited to see how it sounded...turns out they did a pretty bad job.  The vinyl is noisy and has lots of random pops here and there.  Unacceptable for new vinyl.  I saw another review saying that the UK version is actually produced properly and sounds as good as the original.  Out of curiosity, I decided to buy it and see how it sounded, and yes, it sounds excellent and the vinyl is not noisy like the American version.  So, I advise you to go on amazon.co.uk and buy it there and wait it out on the shipping.  You won't be disappointed.  Also, the UK version has a paper sleeve with a plastic liner.  American version only has paper.

B005I64U5C|4.0|I know this one did not get the best reviews, but hey I went and saw it in the theater in 3D anywho and was glad I did. You can not trust the critics these days, if you think it looks interesting go see it for yourself. Now that being said, I purchased the 3D bluray set and it arrived in great condition on the day it was released. Now watching the film I have had a few glitches in the picture and the audio has lost sync with the film.  This does not happen all the time, but I feel it should not be happening at all.   I hope they will make a Lantern 2 very soon.

I couldn't shut it off. Awesome show, very well done. Not like most TV crap shows. I am completely hooked on the show and will totally be watchen season 2. Its a must have for Zombie fans. Buy the Blu Ray forget the standard copy, the picture quality is incredible

B00005Q4CS|4.0|As other reviewers have noted, this film is unique in its harrowingly honest portrayal of addiction, from the inside out. Though it can't entirely capture the intensity and inwardness of Selby's book, it comes as close as anyone can reasonably expect. A grim, horrifying depiction of a subject that should never be glorified or prettified; an encapsulation of a nightmare.
B0007Y89ZM|5.0|The video and sound quality was excellent, with DTS 5.1, sounded terrific thru my multi channel system.  The performance was second-to-none.  The guitar playing was outstanding with great camera work.  The camera work put you right on stage.
B0055B0MIO|5.0|I could write a lot, I could write a little. I could tell you this album is \\"awesome!\\" or I could tell you why its awesome. Either way I don't think I could really express to you how much I really really like this album. I am honestly shocked. Unfortunately, it is EXTREMELY rare that I listen to a cd that was released post 2000 and like the entire album from start to finish. I can't say much more than that. I used to think Trivium was a no name band. I have so much respect for them now. This is a solid release that for me gives them not only credibility for musicianship and songwriting, but a spot on my greatest hits of metal albums. Like I said before I can't verbally express how impressed I am with this album compared to so much bland metal that is being released. Hats off to you Trivium.

B004P8JPS6|4.0|This was my first encounter with Jack Reacher and I enjoyed it very much.  I had been looking at the Jack Reacher books and had more or less decided to start reading them when this book came out.  Seeing as how it was a \\"prequel\\" to the Reacher series, I decided to dive in with this book.  I was not disappointed.  I felt that the narrative was great and I like the toughness of the Jack Reacher character as well as the strict military bearing of the character.  I now look forward to reading the Jack Reacher series starting with the 1st Reacher book, \\"The Killing Floor\\".
B001POX73C|5.0|I loved this novel! I had never heard of Heyer, but knew this was a best-seller from CNN news that Kindle readers are downloading everything from \\"Books about a soldier's life in Afghanistan to Cotillion\\". It made me wonder what in the world \\"Cotillion\\" could be! So I downloaded it and decided I needed to expand my world (because I am the type who would read the Afghanistan book), or a bio of Carl Rove, etc!<br /><br />Well, after a teeny bit of patience with the first few pages,I was addicted! I cared about the characters and went on to love this book...the subtleties of the conversations had me roaring! Especially the English/French misunderstandings (Literal vs. Drama) I think I also learned some fine-tuning to improve my own manners from this, as well...and how often can you say THAT about a book?

B004ZGI2KK|3.0|I am a fan of the director; I prefer her somewhat gritty style. I felt sufficiently misdirected by the possible wolf candidates, so that was good. What really annoyed me was the voiceover. This was weak exposition and resolution. A little dialogue would have been a sufficient replacement. A little spring thaw would have sufficed to show the passage of time. I was disappointed by the structuring of the story.

B00466HN86|5.0|I am a born again Christian, and I generally hate Christian movies. They are usually too preachy and are more of a 90 minute sermon then an entertaining piece of art. While this movie obviously has a clear message, they managed to deliver it in a pretty non-preachy, entertaining, tear-jerking way.  Another reviewer said this is an \\"AMAZING MOVIE!!! Just like with FLYWHEEL, FACING THE GIANTS and FIREPROOF\\". This movie is not like Flywheel, Facing the Giants, and Fireproof... it's way better. Better storyline, stronger scenes, nice cinematography, not too sappy, had a balance of comedy and even the weakest performances didn't take away from the overall enjoyability of the film. If anything they added a nice \\"home spun\\" feel to the movie as a whole.  Probably the only Christian movie I'd spend my money on.

1596680199|5.0|I bought this book on recommendation from other reviews here.  Am I ever happy I did!  This is definitely THE book for learning how to make faux effects!  It happened that I had already been searching in vain for information on how to make imitation bone without having to purchase the product \\"Faux Bone\\", which is not within my budget. Lo and behold both imitation bone and ivory are in this book, and it looks real - as do the pearl, mother-of-pearl, abalone, coral, agate, jade, silver, gold, bronze, wood, turquoise, amber, lapis, etc. all appearing perfectly natural!  The only effect that was not an exact facsimile was the malachite -- but with all those other delicious choices, who cares?  But the book goes way beyond making fabulous fakes, the fantasy pieces are amazing, from wind-chimes to kaleidoscope! There are even pieces that look like blown glass.  This whole book is just making my imagination go wild! There are techniques in this book that I have found nowhere else. Really, this book is a dream come true.<br />If you are looking to find a book on using polymer clay and can only afford a single, all-purpose book, this is it.  Buy it!

1400069181|5.0|I have to be honest, I'd never heard of TOMS shoes until Blake Mycoskie spoke at my church, WILLOW CREEK COMMUNITY CHURCH. I was instantly intrigued by his story, as well as admired his morals. I've been serving, mainly in the prison and Jail ministers, since 2004. I know firsthand what it means for God to place in your heart a passion that blesses you as well as others.<br /><br />After the service they were selling TOMS shoes, along with Blake's book out in the lobby. I was tempted, but low on funds and needing to pick my kids up from their classes, had me opting out. I went home not purchasing anything, something I often don't do when it comes to books, yet the story of TOMS and the book START SOMETHING THAT MATTERS was never far from my mind.<br /><br />Within days I received my Amazon Vine Program picks. To my utter amazement, START SOMETHING THAT MATTERS was one of the choices I could choose from! Clearly a God thing. I didn't hesitate. I immediately ordered the book.<br /><br />Right from the first pages I was captivated. START SOMETHING THAT MATTERS is a quick and easy read. I wasn't even twenty pages in and I was itching to write and post a review. But I held off. I wanted to make sure I captured every essence of the book from start to finish.<br /><br />In my copy, that I will forever keep, it's marked with many highlights and dog-eared pages. Before I was even finished with the book I was emailing TOMS, telling others about it, and started a new blog to START SOMETHING THAT MATTERS.<br /><br />I certainly could have reservations on starting this endeavor, but as Blake's book clearly states, don't over think it. Don't let worry and fear cancel out what you know in your heart to be true. And don't be afraid to make mistakes.<br /><br />I'm NOT letting this opportunity to serve the least of theses for the Lord, slip away due to fear, doubt, and lack of.

B005IZLPMY|4.0|After seeing Iron Man one and two, The Incredible Hulk, Thor, and now Captain America, it seems pretty clear that Marvel knows what it's doing when it comes to making its comics into movies. So far, none of Marvel's cinematic offerings have flopped commercially or critically, and Captain America is just another notch on its belt.  My basic view of the movie is that it fits into the overall tone and style of Marvel's previous movies, it has an excellent cast, its story and script are quite good, and it made me even more excited to see next summer's unprecedented movie project The Avengers.   Chris Evans is great as Captain America.  If anyone has any qualms about him because of his involvement in the mediocre Fantastic Four movies, then they will be put swiftly to rest within the first twenty minutes of Captain America. There is nothing about his portrayal of Captain America that made me once think of Johnny Storm (Human Torch). Nor, happily, did it put me in mind of his hilarious turn as an Evil Ex in the epic and underrated Scott Pilgrim Vs. The World.    Hugo Weaving as Red Skull is predictably awesome, and the rest of the cast does a great job as well.  One interesting aspect of the movie is that the character Howard Stark (Tony Stark's father) has a prominent role in the movie.  So in  The Avengers movie there will already be an interesting dynamic between Captain America and Iron Man, since they will have both known Tony's father in a different capacity.  Also, if you've already seen Thor (And why wouldn't you have?) then you will recognize  that the mysterious relic of power in Captain America is shown in an \\"Easter Egg\\" scene after the final credits in Thor.   As some have noted, there is a marked similarity between the whimsical and classic adventure tone of Captain America and that of the Indiana Jones series, although Captain America is far more in keeping with the vintage Indiana Jones spirit than the disappointing Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. This is what the fourth Indiana Jones movie should have been like-- well, sort of.   In any case, anyone that has enjoys Marvel's offerings so far is sure to enjoy Captain America.  Let's hope they can pull off their major movie gamble next summer so they can continue putting out excellent action movies without delay.
B000002P7R|4.0|Boy am I glad I didn't go by the reviews I read about this album. I did actually put off buying this for a few months but then curiosity got the better of me and i purchased it.  Sure this is a collection of demos alternate takes and jams but anybody else would kill to be able to put out an album of this quality. it rocks.  For a long time I thought Hendrix was an over hyped icon. Sure ,i liked the \\"hits\\" like \\"Purple Haze\\" \\"watchtower\\" <\\"Foxey Lady\\" etc... but a few years ago a friend gave me a copy of Elecrtic Ladyland and I' ve been a Hendrix freak ever since. I buy anything i can find.  And South Saturn delta being my latest acquisition, I loved it. \\"Message To The Universe\\" blew me away. the solo is just amazing. As I drove down the road i nearly jumped out of my seat, it was so intense i was grinning from ear to ear.  Tax Free\\" \\"Pali Gap\\" and \\"Laughing Sam's Dice\\"? Wow! all great tunes.  While I wouldn't recommend this as your first Hendrix Album. I do recommend it to hardcore fans and those familiar with Jimi's work.  This is a great collection of tunes.
B004EPYZUI|4.0|Every so often a movie comes along that gains a poor reputation for no apparent reason.  It becomes the target of unfairly harsh criticisms on the part of cynical mobs of professional and \\"armchair\\" critics alike.  Such a movie is Sucker Punch, one of the most visually dazzlingly and narratively experimental action/fantasy movies of all time.<br /><br />Let me begin by pointing out its only real flaw:  It isn't long enough for the story; which means there isn't enough time to fully establish its group of femme fatales. Even after seeing the much better extended version, I still feel like the characters needed more \\"down time\\" to breathe and interact between the insane action vignettes that are its main attraction.  The theatrical version seems stiff and remote because of this, although it is significantly improved by the extra footage in the extended version-- just not as much as you would want. I think Sucker Punch would be stronger overall if each of the five main girls were fleshed out (not a pun) a little more.  Perhaps as little as ten extra minutes of characterization would have helped.  Anyway, that is my only legitimate gripe.  Stay tuned for a comically illegitimate one later on.<br /><br />As you might imagine, the visuals in the movie are awesome.  That is at least one thing the movie's detractors will allow it: it looks and sounds amazing.  The battles are well-staged and exciting, and I find it hard to imagine that anyone could not be entertained by watching these particular scenes.<br /><br />If you are confused about the nature of these scenes because you have seen video clips here and there of giant samurais, machine guns,  World War II planes, dragons, etc.  then I have a simple explanation:  each of these scenes is an metaphor.  That's it.  They aren't dreams or visions,  just wildly imaginative metaphors for each stage of the girls' struggle to escape from the asylum they are forced to live in. Some people find this difficult to understand.  It isn't.<br /><br />Now, I will address one more thing before I close.  There have been charges that the movie is chauvinistic and degrading toward women, that the girls are dressed scantily all the time, that the movie panders to drooling neanderthals who only want to see T&A, etc.  Well, fortunately (and unfortunately), this is not the case.  During the action vignettes, the girls are dressed only mildly inappropriately for the conditions of the fight-- by which I mean, you might see a bit of thigh or midriff, but they aren't wearing chain mail bikinis ala Red Sonja.  Their fight-scene garb should not raise any eyebrows.  During the \\"real\\" part of the story, which I forgot to add is the first layer of metaphor that blankets most of the movie, the girls are metaphorically in a 1920's style club where they have to entertain the rich and significant.  Well, not much of the movie actually deals with their interactions with patrons, or their dancing for that matter, so you still end up not seeing that much T&A even when logically you would expect to see a fair amount of it.  So, the movie under-delivers on this score and yet is unfairly said to contain too much of it.  There is no nudity in the entire movie, I might add.  Sucker Punch has a solid R rating, but only because of stylized violence and language.  Sin City has quite a bit of nudity and scantily dressed vixens, yet this is generally not counted against it in reviews.  Anyway,  as I was mentioning earlier about a comically illegitimate complaint, it is only that given the R rating and the fact that you have five dazzling girls as leads in a shady dance club, it is oddly disappointing that you never do see anything truly tantalizing.  Yes, I know, silly of me to mention it, but I'm sure someone was wondering.<br /><br />In closing, I think Sucker Punch is a really entertaining and innovative action-fantasy movie and deserves far better treatment that it has received thus far.  Don't miss out just because of the critics.
0446547654|3.0|I was very anxious to read Nicholas Sparks novel the Best of Me...when I read about Dawson and Amanda, I was already wondering, will they get back together...could it be like the Notebook?   While I got caught up in the plot of Dawson's and Amanda's lives...I could still see how much that they meant to each other and the pitfalls of her being in an unhappy marriage, well it just seemed that it was time for both of the main characters to have a second chance at happiness, together, inspite of any pitfalls that come their way.   But I was also disappointed as well. Most of Nicholas Sparks novels always involves either one of the main characters dying or someone dying...making most of them a tragic love story. I was hoping that this story would be different.   When the accident happened involving Amanda's son and husband and then the eventualy heart donor needed, I was only getting more sadder, since I had an idea where the story was leading. And then when Dawson was killed by his family...it was bittersweet.   Would I recommend this book to others? I hate it say it, but no. I wanted a happy ending.   If you're a Nicholas Sparks fan then you'll know what to expect....its just not one of my favorites.   The Best of Me....so-so.

B000007U6W|5.0|After the experimental prone and quite anti-musical approaches of the first three albums (Kraftwerk 1+2, RalfundFlorian), Autobahn marks the beginning of a great series of albums to come. It is the first actual Kraftwerk opus, having a tight concept (driving on the Autobahn) and a generally poppier/catchier approach.  The title track \\"Autobahn\\" is already the highlight and most important track on the album. It has an incredible length of over 22 minutes and four or five different musical sections. With this bombastic length and the interchanging musical sections, it seems more complex, more inventive, even more mature and less repetitive than later Kraftwerk material.   The little disadvantage of it is of course, if you don't have enough time, you can't listen to the whole 22 minutes. But you should really listen to this track (if not the entire album) as a whole, in one sitting, as only thus can you comprehend its full value and meaning. It is a kind of total work of art ('Gesamtkunstwerk' in German), which evokes the feeling of driving on the Autobahn very well. It has a propelling electronic percussion rhythm (having the distinctive 'motorik' beat in the final part), nice synthesizer work and textures, fine melodies (played not only on synthesizers but also on conventional instruments like flute and guitar), and some sparse but well-crafted vocals. Approximately at half length, there are also several noises that sound like cars driving and overtaking (rumour has it that the band actually held a cassette recorder out of the window while driving on the Autobahn to record all these car noises, but I think it was actually reproduced in the studio through synthetic means; cannot tell for sure though).  My only little complaint is that the rest of the tracks are comparatively short and all instrumental.  These instrumentals are all quite good (though non of them can achieve the magnificence of the title track).  \\"Kometenmelodie 1\\" has a dark reflective mood, some ominously pounding bass drum sound, a comparatively minimalist instrumentation, and some creepy sounding synthesizer melody (first playing various arpeggios and then halting on a G tone drone). This track reminds me a bit of the early Cluster work. It evokes the feeling of lonely contemplation under a murky star firmament.  On \\"Kometenmelodie 2\\" the 'firmament' seems more colourful/vivid, as this track is much lighter in tone, less minimalist, more optimistic and upbeat than \\"Kometenmelodie 1\\" (these two songs share a common musical motif, though on \\"Kometenmelodie 2\\" this melody is played at a higher octave level and with a more 'cheerful' sounding synthesizer).  \\"Mitternacht\\" is quite brooding and minimalist again, a small foreboding synthbass riff played over and over, being accompanied by some weird 'dripping' beat and various scary sounding noises.  \\"Morgenspaziergang\\" closes the album in quite a harmless and joyful tone. It has only few synthesizers, instead more real instruments (flute and piano among others), and of course various sounds imitating animal activity in the morning (birdsong and frogs croaking among others). It closes the album quite well (and more positive than some of the darker sounding tracks in the middle part).  All in all Autobahn grants me with a pleasing listening experience (especially the title track) and is the first true Kraftwerk album with a tight concept and a poppier approach. It is less sterile than later albums though. Here Kraftwerk sound still quite human, man and machine being in good harmony (not machine-dominated as later on). The music, though already incorporating synthesizers heavily, is still warmer and more organic, sometimes also quite raw or 'dirty' sounding, when in direct comparison to later Kraftwerk albums (that's not to say that later Kraftwerk albums are bad, on the contrary, they're all good, with the exception maybe of Electric Café and The Mix).  --------------------  Btw, the original release featured a backcover photo showing the band as if seated in car driving on the Autobahn. On it, Ralf Hütter and Florian Schneider don't seem to be as optimistic as the other two (especially Florian looks quite grumpy, maybe being a bit upset about the fact that this photo depicts Klaus Röder and Emil Schult as if they were full-time band members, when in fact they contributed little to the album {Emil Schult just co-wrote some lyrics and Klaus Röder only played electric violin on \\"Mitternacht\\", as stated on the 2009 remaster}; even Wolfgang Flür {who isn't depicted on the photo and wasn't a full-time band member yet} contributed more)

B00005JOFQ|1.0|This was a terrible movie! It's so very sexist. This movie condones men treating women like dirt so that the men can get off on whatever desires they may have. The fact that you're gay doesn't mean you have the right to treat women like that.
0385738773|3.0|The final book in the Maze Runner trilogy is finally out! The Death Cure, by James Dashner, brings the story of Thomas to a close.<br /><br />The Story- Thomas and his friends are now in the hands of WICKED. They've escaped the maze and the scorched lands and now they are lab rats. They are told that the time for lies is over, that now they will have their memories restored. But, Thomas doesn't believe them. So, when everyone else opts to have their memories returned, Thomas and two of the Gladers escape.<br /><br />They arrive in one of the protected cities in Colorado, only to learn that the Flare is present even there. With no where to run, things look grim as the city is over run my man eating Goners. Thomas and friends join up with a rebel group intent on bringing WICKED down. The end finally comes as Thomas tries to rescue other immunes before the rebels blow up the building in which they are being held.<br /><br />My Thoughts- I have to be honest, the first book, The Maze Runner, was the best. Even though this book sums everything up, it is just not as suspenseful as the first. But, I have to admit the end was a shocker. SEMI SPOILER** One of the main characters dies and it turns out that after all the kids have gone through, all the brutal violence and death, that WICKED is no where near a cure. The reality is, there is no hope for those left behind.<br /><br />I've enjoyed the character of Thomas. He stays true to himself in all three books. He is a hero, a boy that won't leave a friend behind, and in the end, the right choice for a leader.<br /><br />I do have to wonder at the ending. Sorry, another SPOILER**, but they end up somewhere green and lush. I thought the entire Earth was basically ruined by the Scorch and only the protected cities were left. Where do they go? Is it another dimension? In all, it is nice to know that they are finally out of the hands of WICKED and able to live there lives in peace.<br /><br />The books in this series are very visual, full of brutal violence and disturbing images. Dashner does a great job bringing his world to life. You can actually feel the desperation of the people living in the time of the Flare. The emotion he invokes whenever you read the name WICKED is amazing. You just want to punch a wall every time they are involved in a scene. They are so evil, but disguised as good. A very common theme in today's world.<br /><br />This book isn't as violent as the previous two, but I still say this is a read for ages 12 and up.<br />[...]al, full of brutal violence and disturbing images.

I am the type of person who cook and bakes for my self alot, 95% of the time since I realised that I can make food for cheaper and better tasting then restaurant (and I know whats in it REALLY)so I think that this book is good for someone who eats out alot or only some times likes to bake or cook for them selves wich I would say is the average person because every one I know from my generation hardly ever cooks/bakes so I think that the average persons standards are lower asuming you dont cook or bake often... for the price this book is good/okay but personaly I find WAY better recipes on \\"allrecipes.com\\" if you just type in the search box \\"best ever\\" cup cakes, pies, muffins... whatever you want and pick the recipe with the most votes and highest ratings and best of all its free! so me personaly I would say save your money on this mediocre book.

1400052181|5.0|There is little I can add to the cacophony of reviews that are already out there. Still, I have to gush about how wonderful this book is. I am typically a fiction reader but often  dip into nonfiction as long as it proves to be interesting and insightful. This seemed like it would be right up my alley, but I shied away from it because there seemed to be so much hype surrounding it. I dislike hype, on principal and try to stay away from most bestseller lists. Actually, I picked this book by default because the audiobook was in my partner's car. Halfway through the first disc, I was completely enthralled. I even crossed state lines to go to a bookstore and buy a paperback copy so I could read it 24/7. After I finished it, I wanted to so back and read it all over again!  Unless you live under a rock, you have probably heard about this book. Still, I'll give you a brief overview just in case you've been trapped in a time capsule. Henrietta Lacks was an African-American woman who lived in Maryland when she felt a hard ball on her cervix. Having no health insurance and little money, she went to Johns Hopkins where they removed her tumor and took some of her cells for future testing. However, the doctors did this without anyone's knowledge or approval. Though Henrietta eventually died from this cancer, her cells became the first immortal cells. Since her death, they've been used in thousands of experiments in numerous field. Though people have made millions on Henrietta's cells, her family saw none of the money and still has no health insurance.  What makes this book so fantastic is that the author takes a holistic approach to her writing. She doesn't simply focus on the science of the cells but spends an equal amount of time on Henrietta's family and their history. This adds an emotional edge that left me crying at times, which a book strictly on cells would never do (unless I was crying with boredom). The most exceptional aspect of the book is how well researched it is.Clearly, Henrietta's family has been misrepresented since the 1950s. Fortunately, the author took years to get to know the family, understand their plight, and write objectively. I could ramble on for pages and pages but I will end by saying this: \\"The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks\\" is by far one of the best books I have read in my entire life (and I read a lot).
B0030Y11XS|5.0|I bought this movie for my husband, but I didn't particularly look forward to watching it.  Turns out, I loved watching it.  Whether you agree or disagree with the content, Michael Moore is just a darn good documentary film maker.  He makes his point clear and entertaining.  I don't think anyone watching a Michael Moore film is expecting a non-biased look at the issue of capitalism (and its failures) or at least I hope they're not.    In this film, Moore looks at some of the failures of our government - or politicians and corporations in particular - and also at some of the successes of private enterprises - employee-owned enterprises.  Moore succeeds because his view is a personal one and he makes no effort to hide that.  Not only does he not hide his bias, he flaunts it, by once again returning to his home town and interviewing his own father.  For him it's a personal story and he succeeds in making it feel like a personal story for the viewer as well.  And if you live in the United States, it should be a personal story for you... you just may or may not have the same personal view as Michael Moore.  Keeping those thoughts in mind, I found this to be a very informative (though biased) and thought-provoking film, as well as an entertaining one.

B005HV6Y5W|4.0|This is not your run of the mill film with a linear story, but instead is a brilliantly impressionistic piece that mingles a disjointed plot with images - of nebulae, aquatic creatures, even of dinosaurs, and paint blobs akin to 2001's descent into infinite.  All the while vivid music adds to the mood.  It is hard to piece the story together and hard to concentrate on the film, though if one does there is a genuine lyrical beauty to it.<br /><br />The story is about a troubled family from the early 1960s.  While there is much love in the family, there is also an authoritarian father (in a rare good performance by Brad Pitt), needy kids, and soulful mother, who is in crisis because her religion has failed to protect her from the death of a child.  The moods are very strong, offering clues to the disjointed storytelling, forcing the viewer to fill in the dots.<br /><br />In the end, it is a matter of personal taste.  I liked the film very much, though my attention wandered a bit.
B004QZ9PLU|3.0|Typical ending for his books. Why can't they ever end happily? Also you could see the ending coming a mile away. I don't know it I will read anymore of his books. This is definately not his best effort in my opinion. A little to coincidental.

0062060554|5.0|Christine Lucas wakes up in the morning, every morning, in a strange bed, next to a man she doesn't know. She makes her way to the bathroom and is shocked by what she sees in the mirror, a woman some twenty years older than she was expecting. Her husband, Ben, is eternally patient. Every morning he explains, when she confronts him in panic, that she is an amnesiac, that she's incapable of forming new memories, that every night when she goes to sleep the experiences she's had during the day are erased. That's been the pattern, at least, until she starts keeping a journal surreptitiously, at the suggestion of a doctor whom she's also seeing behind her husband's back. The journal allows her to piece together more information than Ben shares with her in any one typical day. It provides a connected narrative of her life, if no memory of it, and thus makes her condition a bit more manageable. And it lets her catch her husband when he lies to her. Christine is utterly helpless because she only knows what's she's been told. And now she's coming to realize that some of what she's been told isn't true. It's enough to make one paranoid.<br /><br />Before I Go to Sleep is told from Christine's perspective, much of it in the form of the lengthy journal entries that she writes feverishly, trying to capture what's happened before it's lost to her. For the most part the story is filled with small events, doctor's visits and dinners, rather than pulse-pounding action scenes, but it is suffused with an undercurrent of delicious tension. It's a book that's hard to put down.<br /><br />-- Debra Hamel

B004W4N55C|1.0|I was really looking forward to finally having a unlimited library of TAB at my fingertips without gigantic stacks of books and magazines.  Ninety-five percent (95%) of the TABs I've tried to look at have caused a \\"Forced Close\\" on my Motorola XOOM w Wi/Fi.    $7.99 for worthless, frustrating JUNK.  Support?  Have they tried to fix it?  Did they give me my money back?  NO. NO. NO.  They got my money though.  It sucks.  Hit your thumb with a sledgehammer if you're considering buying this, it will be better than trying to use this CRAP called an APP.
B004RJMUJO|1.0|Unfortunately, it's completely unplayable on my Droid 2 Global, both with Froyo and Gingerbread. It loads, but on every screen it is virtually unresponsive to input. The game keeps going, ignoring anything I do on the touchscreen. On the rare occasions when it does pick up my gestures, it is incredibly laggy (though I have to admit, it is funny to watch it try to complete 30 seconds worth of swipes all at once).  While the game looks like fun, as it currently stands it's useless to me. Uninstalling until they fix it.

B0015XHQTY|4.0|THE ENFORCER is not the best of the Dirty Harry films, but it's not a bad romp through Frisco, either. Unremittingly brutal and violent, it also shows more heart and character-complexity than its predecessors, and arguably has the best acting-chemistry of any entry in the series.<br /><br />In DIRTY HARRY (1971), Clint Eastwood's man-alone detective, Inspector Harry Callahan, was pitted against a vicious serial killer. In MAGNUM FORCE (1973), he crossed revolvers with a gang of ruthless vigilante cops. But by the time THE ENFORCER came round, in 1976, terrorism - domestic and international - had become the public's principal anxiety; so it's not surprising Dirty Harry was summoned to give it a sound thrashing with his .44 Magnum.<br /><br />THE ENFORCER opens in true D.H. style, with two brutal murders, as a domestic terrorist group called the People's Revolutionary Strikeforce steals a gas truck, which they soon use to rob a weapons warehouse of a huge supply of machine guns and rocket launchers. The robbery is detected by Harry's sometime partner, the tubby but tough Inspector DiGorgio (John Mitchum), a veteran of the two previous films, who gets a Bowie knife in his liver for his troubles. Enraged by the loss of yet another partner, Callahan sets out to hunt down these killhappy terrorists, a motley crew of idealists and mercenary-types led by the psychopathic Bobby Maxwell (DeVeren Brookwalter). Unfortunately, he has to deal with the constant interference of his boss Captain \\"criminals have rights too!\\" McKay (Bradford Dillman), and his new partner, a newbie female officer named Kate Moore (Tyne Daly). Maxwell's gang terrorizes the city for a time, before finally electing to kidnap the mayor (John Crawford) and hold him for ransom. This being a Dirty Harry movie, the City naturally agrees to pay the ransom. Funny thing, though; making a deal with the City doesn't protect you from Harry. He makes his own deals, and he makes them with a Magnum.<br /><br />THE ENFORCER has its problems; it isn't as visceral as DIRTY HARRY or as visually pleasing and well-constructed as MAGNUM FORCE, and the villains are bit generic, but it has a lot of enjoyable moments. Harry's shall we say...creative...solution to a liquor store holdup, his verbal evisceration of an annoying feminist from City Hall, his rage over bureacratic inefficiency (\\"I'm comin' down there in five minutes, and you'd better have those files ready, you pencil-pushing son of a ----!\\"), his ten-minute foot chase of a suspect (that ends up interrupting a porno shoot), his flabbergasted reaction to being assigned a female partner, his thrashing of a militant priest (\\"I ain't got time to argue religion with you, boy!\\") and the anatomically uncomfortable suggestions he continually makes to Captain McKay are all classic D.H. To top it off, Eastwood has great chemistry with Tyne Daly, with Albert Popwell (who plays different roles in four different D.H. films), and with Dillman, too.<br /><br />Beneath all the shallow charges of \\"fascism\\" that this series had to endure from witless clods who couldn't define \\"fascism\\" if you gave them three years to do it, is the simple truth that Harry simply represents The Man Who Is Fed The F Up And Ain't Gonna Take It No More. Not from his boss and certainly not from the criminals. If his methods are about as subtle as a stick of dynamite, they merely reflect the secret fantasies of nearly all of us, namely, that bureacracy be given the finger and the bad guys given a taste of their own medicine. Is that so bad? I don't think so.

B000006XSD|1.0|This album is one reason why alcoholism is a bad thing. The follow up relase From the Inside would fare much better musically and chronicled Vincent's time in rehab/the institution. Alcohol has destroyed many a career and as another review states this album sounds flat. There are some good moments. It's Hot Tonight is a good start. Alice has even played in concerts within the last five years. But this is only his third solo record and is a far cry from Welcome to My Nightmare. It's a good thing that there are only a few albums that are this underwhelming in AC's output.<br />Overall on Lace and Whiskey some things work and somethings don't. It is hit and miss.

B0034G4P80|3.0|Branagh's Thor is kinda hard going, and I love science-fiction fantasy when it's brilliantly executed, like Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings and Star Wars (the original 3 films).  Thor is pure derivative Hollywood by-the-book script writing.  The acting is television calibre for the most part and the music utterly forgettable.  The best aspects of this flick are the f/x on the planet Asgard.  They are evocative and beautiful.  The earth action is forgettable, and hobbled by a very lame romantic interest in the non-charismatic person of Natalie Portman as Jane.  Her Tarzan (you Jane) is played well by Chris Hemsworth who looks more like and advertisement for Golds Gym than a lead in a major Hollywood production.  But he does well with little.  His brother, Loki, is much more interesting, played by Tom Hiddleston.  But villains always steal the show with a script this weak and sophomoric.    The ubiquitous and versatile Anthony Hopkins is a fine Odin but he spends most of this movie in a coma watched over by Frigga his wife played by the lovely Renée Russo who is utterly wasted in this part.  The other lesser gods are anonymous action hero figures from Diablo II.    Everything about this movie is derivative.  Parts of it reminded me of the great computer game Diablo: Lord of Destruction, mixed up with other computer game imagery.  The earth characters are only half-drawn persons and of no interest at all.  The script lacks humor which is fatal in a comic book story like this.  I remember Tim Burton's Batman films as having that tongue-in-cheek irony that is completely absent in Thor.  Thor was made for the 13 year old market and I fear that any sequels that are spawned from it are doomed to failure.  Pity.  Branagh should stick to Shakespeare, preferably as the brilliant actor that he is.

B002VPE1WK|5.0|I am an amateur hobbyist with an entry level DSLR and 4 lens. I used to have a camera bag that looked like a lunch box and it was just awkward to work with. I used to take it to Theme parks and other visits out and so I decided to get a backpack - nothing fancy, just usable. This Amazon bag is pretty nice, fits my camera, 4 lens, a flash, extra batteries and all other wires as well. Its not top loading, which a lot of users want, but I don't really mind that.  You'll also note that the bag is smaller than your average backpack which is also nice. Overall, I am very satisfied.

0812550757|4.0|That's what you find when you excavate an outhouse: intriguing but often inscrutable trash. I'm not talking about an outhouse in current use; I mean one that's been abandoned for a hundred or a thousand years. It's not a smelly task, this excavation. I know because I have done it, as a volunteer helping archaeologists excavate a pre-1849 outhouse in the san Francisco Presidio. So what do you find in a historical outhouse? Durable bits and pieces, of course, of things thrown away, or lost, or deliberately hidden -- a broken cup, a key that fell out of a pocket, a knife or a pistol. That last would be an extremely lucky find for any archaeologist, demanding interpretation.<br /><br />Excavating the imagination of Orson Scott Card -- reading his novel, I mean -- is very much like excavating an outhouse. I don't want to imply that \\"Speaker for the Dead\\" is a pit full of stinky muck, though some readers will think so. I enjoyed it. It's bizarre and original. But it's chock full of rubbish -- bits of languages (Portuguese, Swedish & neologisms), fragments of science, shards of ritual artifacts of seemingly religious significance. That's the thing about any excavation; you find the material objects but it's up to you what to make of them, and chances are you'll be wildly wrong.<br /><br />The title character - the Speaker for the Dead - is Andrew Wiggin, nicknamed Ender by his sister when he was child some 3000 years ago. Andrew is 35 now. That discrepancy of age is explained by his frequent inter-stellar travels at near light speed. Andrew saved his species -- Homo sapiens -- by apparently exterminating another species of intelligent insect-like hiving beings; that was in his first youth as portrayed in the prequel novel \\"Ender's Game\\". Andrew/Ender suffered intense guilt when he realized his 'sin' of genocide. Now, surviving incognito in a universe of 100 planets inhabited by humans, Ender seeks redemption by trying to save another intelligent but technologically primitive species threatened by contact with fear-driven humans.<br /><br />There's a lot about 'redemption' in this sci-fi novel, and a lot about notions of 'afterlife'. No surprise! Much of science-fiction is metaphysical and/or quasi-theological. Author Scott Orson Card grew up in the Mormon faith and served as a Mormon missionary in Brazil (hence the Portuguese in this novel). If you know anything of Mormon cosmology, you'll be equipped to identify some of the scraps of cosmography and 'xenobiology' in \\"Speaker for the Dead\\". But Card also took advanced studies at Notre Dame, so fragments of Roman Catholicism are common in his midden of discarded beliefs. Actually, Card has not, in real life, discarded his adherence to the Church of Latter Day Saints; he's a faithful practitioner, a social conservative vociferously opposed to 'same sex marriage'. Card also maintains at least some communication with the Church of Scientology. Any excavation of \\"Speaker for the Dead\\", I warn you, will uncover broken tablets and charred palimpsests of theology aplenty! Whether they'll make any sense will depend on the confidence of the interpreter ... who will no doubt be wildly wrong.<br /><br />The gift that makes Andrew/Ender Wiggin unique among humans - the quality first recognized by his trainers in his boyhood and intensively cultivated by them to prepare him for his role as saviour of his species - is Empathy! Wiki says \\"Empathy is the capacity to recognize and, to some extent, share feelings (such as sadness or happiness) that are being experienced by another sapient or semi-sapient being.\\" And this is the oddest, most inscrutable thing about the novels of Orson Scott Card -- I've read two of them now -- that Card seems utterly incapable of 'character development' in his writing. Not a single character in \\"Speaker for the Dead\\" or \\"Ender's Game\\" is a plausible human being! In \\"Speaker\\", the intelligent other species ('ramen' in Card's neologism), are extreme metamorphs with threelife stages, but in their mobile interactive life stage as 'piggies' they are every bit as 'human' in personality as Ender and any of the inhabitants of the planet he conspires to save. Honestly, Orson Scott Card's people are as stiff and stagey as Egyptian hieroglyphic profiles or the stylized figures on Minoan pottery. What to make of an author who can't create a believable character? Is Orson Scott Card \\"one of us\\" or is he himself a \\"raman\\"? An obviously intelligent alien species? Reading his words and reading about his career, I almost wonder whether he isn't an extremely high-functioning autistic. Perhaps that's why he awards his hero Ender the power of superhuman empathy, since empathy is the one human attribute he knows he lacks in himself.tive life stage as 'piggies' they are every bit as 'human' in personality as Ender and any of the inhabitants of the planet he conspires to save.

B004J4WKUQ|5.0|I won't go into detail on the book as others have already done so. I just had to get online after finishing this book and let everyone know that it is a great read! This book grabs you from the first pages and keeps you going to the end. You wouldn't think it would be as action packed and exciting as it is when you read the story line but don't take my word for it... get this book and you will be hooked!  The writing is smooth and the characterizations are flawless. This is now one of my all time favorites... one of my top ten. Way to go.

0062011847|3.0|\\"Snuff\\" is a Discworld novel and Pratchett is suffering from Alzheimer's so it's anyone's guess how much longer he'll be able to write so I desperately wanted to love this book. I have found his books have been growing more subtle and refined with time so my hopes are not ill-founded. However I found Snuff a bit of a chore to finish. I like Vimes and the story was generally fun but it felt unfinished. The ending in particular really dragged. After all of the action was done, after everything had been revealed, after pretty much everything important had been concluded, there was still 25% left to go. Some little things get resolved in a whimper and a dribble - we knew they would but since the climax is long past, these little revelations take far, far too much time.  I also found that the main theme of the book - what is \\"human\\" or valuable in life - was almost too trite. It's an important question and I like that the characters are so ugly as to be all but unlovable but instead of dealing with this, we get a character who plays \\"ethereal\\" music which moves everyone to tears and voila, debate and discussion over. Too convenient, too trite.  In the end it was predictable and forgettable. I feel I should give it at least three stars since it is a Pratchett and some of it was very good (especially the young Sam) but I do wonder if this had appeared under any other byline I would have given it a two.  I'd say \\"Snuff\\" is for fans only, otherwise pick one of the many, many other good books in the series.

They're challenging enough that you'll scratch your head for a bit, but won't be too difficult for the sake of being difficult.   My main problem with this is that its too expensive. Almost 2 dollars for a game that you can beat in less than an hour? I've spent 4 dollars on other apps that have a gameplay of 20+ hours and its still going. Wish it was longer, or at least that they would make a free version with advertisement throughout the game.

B005MP28B2|3.0|Let me talk about what is good about this film first.<br /><br />All of the actors in this film do really well, even in some of the more uncomfortable scenes. I am a big fan of Brad Pitt and Sean Penn, both are excellent actors and in particular, Brad Pitt's abilities are on display in this film.<br /><br />The cinematography is excellent and ethereal at times, real craftsmanship here.<br /><br />I like that the film has a post-Christian slant to it, that it displays a sense that much of what life is about, and what makes life possible is outside of the realm of Religion. But the film really dances around the subject. Its a tease that won't offend.<br /><br />Now, for the problems, I was really disappointed. The film is too long and too slow moving. Also, I have a problem with films that try to \\"say something\\" like this movie does. Life isn't fair, Life isn't a Disneyland visit, so what? Things could be worse. The film centers around the experiences of a young Boy, the eldest of 4 boys. So he's spoiled as the only child at first, then by about 3 years of age another brother arrives. This \\"loss\\" seems to cause him grief and ends up being an excuse for all sorts of weird thoughts and actions. The boy never seems to realize that raising a family isn't easy, that being a father to 4 boys isn't easy, being married isn't easy.<br /><br />The problem with films that try to \\"say something\\" always seem to tell one side of the story, such is the case with this story, the whole thing was kind of whiney, the kid grows up in a middle-class family at the peak of Americas wealth and privilege but because he's got too much time on his hands he's doing things that cause him \\"guilt\\" and confusion. Obviously the original story was written by a member of that pathetic Generation that we call the \\"Boomers.\\" The Boomers who cannot shuffle off without inflicting as much angst and sorrow as they think that they're entitled to.<br /><br />Unless you are a pathetic attention-starved Boomer I recommend you skip this one, unless you just love beautiful Cinematography and Peak Art-House production methods.iful Cinematography and Peak Art-House production methods.

B00000JSJC|5.0|I first saw this brain blower of a film at the chinese theater in hollywood ca when released to a packed crowd and let me say this, THE CROWD WENT NUTS AT ITS ENDING to a thunderous applause with angela bassett and ralph fiennes getting massive applause when there pics came up along with DEEP FOREST and PETER GABRIELS song WHILE THE EARTH SLEEPS is pulsively playing. ive been a big fan of cameron and the ex ms cameron, kathryn bigelow. im also a huge fan of female directors and bigelow is right up there with jane campion, jodie foster nora ephron and whoever else im forgetting. kathryns films are hyper kinetic and very visceral and not mention visual. her first being 87s BLUE STEEL with jamie lee curtis then 1991s totally awesome POINT BREAK then came STRANGEDAYS. 2002s K-12 THE WIDOWMAKER with harrison ford. then THE HURT LOCKER. way to go kat on your well deserved oscar. I know your forthcoming movie about the hunting of bin laden is sure to be provoking. STRANGEDAYS really blew my mind like one the characters literally does to himself. this is a dazzling but uneasy mixture of futuristic action and social relevance capturing the addictive thrill of virtual reality. had this film come out today i think it would surely be a hit. the short but exciting car chase scene is thunderous. The last 20 minutes of this film is truly epic in downtown L.A. ralph fiennes has never been better in his grungy long haired sexy look. and talk about smoking, sexy, crazy hot, angela bassett, she was born to play \\"mace\\", a decent woman just trying to survive and raise her kid in a crazy world. she works hard, She fights hard, and drives hard! cameron is known for making his heroins in his films strong and brave. Sigourney weaver and jeanette goldstein in ALIENS, linda hamilton in TERMINATOR 2,and mary elizabeth mastrantonio in THE ABYSS. he once said in an interview that his mother was a strong woman which is why he made woman strong, smart, and kick ass in those films. i cant say enough about this film except wheres the friggin' bluray!? 20th century fox CMON GUYS! give us want we want instead you give us BABYS DAY OFF!!!. commentary, featurettes, DTS 5.1 HD master audio, and anything else PLEASE. until then i'll enjoy my dvd copy. pick this up here on amazon, sit back and JUST HIT PLAYBACK!!!h about this film except wheres the friggin' bluray!? 20th century fox CMON GUYS! give us want we want instead you give us BABYS DAY OFF!!!. commentary, featurettes, DTS 5.1 HD master audio, and anything else PLEASE. until then i'll enjoy my dvd copy. pick this up here on amazon, sit back and JUST HIT PLAYBACK!!!
034552554X|5.0|This book will make you think and feel about the important of having loving parents. When reading and also writing this review, I had to stop and let my thoughts mill around. There were two times in the book that I wanted to reach in and prevent something from happening. There also was a surprise ending. There was no way that I would have guessed how this book would end!<br /><br />Vanessa Diffenbaugh says that she was inspired for this book by the flower dictionaries that she had discovered in a used bookstore. The story would not work if the language of flowers was not included. But she married the story and the language so expertly that it is almost two stories that you get at the same time. Besides being an entertaining story, it also teaches.<br /><br />The author handles time shifts seamlessly, revealing little bits of history as the book progresses that add so much understanding of Victoria. The strange thing is that I felt at home with almost all the main characters except for Victoria Jones, the main character. I could understand them better. But now, I think that this book helped me to understand why Victoria was the way that she was and that in turn helped me understand why some foster children are similar to her.<br /><br />Abandoned by her mother before she really knew her, Victoria had been in many foster homes but never stayed long enough to bond to her foster parents. She never learned trust or felt comfortable about being touched. A hug would be an invasion instead of an expression of love to her.<br /><br />When she became too old to live in foster home, she was given a chance to make in the adult world but she couldn't adjust. When she was turned out of her temporary apartment, she slept in the park and ate leftovers at restaurants. But her hunger drove her to try to get a job at a florist. This is where the story really takes off. She had learned the language of flowers at one of her temporary homes and she started to use it in her own job. The Language of Flowers was the only way that she could communicate emotions.<br /><br />There is a Dictionary of Flowers in the back of the book. When you read this book, you may be consulting it for meanings in the story but also just to explore the meanings. For example Chrysanthemum means truth, pink roses mean grace. Before reading this book, I knew there were some meanings attached to different flowers but I did not know that in Victorian times, there were whole books with the meanings of flowers. Victoria learned the meanings and loved the flowers; they made her feel at home.<br /><br />I think book can be enjoyed by anyone interested in the meaning of flowers and can also be beneficial to foster parents or people thinking of becoming foster parents.

He spent part of 1936 and all of 1937 fighting for P.O.U.M., one of the communist factions in the Spanish Civil War. This is his personal account of the events of that time. He spent most of the time on the relatively quiet Aragon front. Orwell and his outfit lacked adequate food, clothes and weaponry - as did the Franco troops on the other side. Late in 1937, he was injured by a stray bullet through the neck.<br /><br />Orwell was an idealist. For him, communism meant empowerment of the working class. He desired a true democracy and opposed facism and capitalism. But, he also opposed the Soviet model of communism, which he saw as just another way to oppress the working class. Ultimately, he left Spain disillusioned by the politics of war and the compromises made by the communists. He was dismayed by the incessant battles between the various communist factions.<br /><br />Orwell tells many wonderful stories of his experiences in Spain. He gives an unvarnished view of a poor-man's war. The Spanish fighters - on both sides - were poorly trained, ill-equipped and generally lacking a will to fight. On the Franco side, most of the Spanish soldiers had been conscripted. On the communist side, the Spanish were just happy to have a paying job. Orwell's outstanding writing effortlessly combines many tales from the front with his political observations.
B005CM9DX6|4.0|The only reason I don't give this record 5 stars is because it's Opeth, and \\"Heritage\\" simply is not as good as \\"Blackwater Park\\", \\"Still Life\\" or \\"Ghost Reveries\\"...then again, this IS Opeth that we're talking about here!  This album would've been considered a masterstroke by probably any other band beside Akerfeldt and Co.   Easily.  I was definitely taken aback by the prog style they've adopted for this album, but reading these reviews nearly scared me away from listening to the record. I'm glad I went with my gut and gave it a try. If someone were to play this album for you and ask you who it was, you would answer Opeth immediately. It sounds just like them, and not very far away from what they've played for us before (albeit contained within a death metal wrapper). Having listened to the for a long time now, I find this to be a very natural progression.  One thing I do have to admit is that when Opeth had indulged in their proggy flourishes in the past, the results sounded to me like imitation. Akerfeldt has so often professed his love for that style, it seemed like a love letter to those Prog-Rock Gods of yore. This album perhaps sounds so odd because I think here he's attempting (rather successfully) to take that style and make it his own. I find it more natural in execution than in times past (maybe not as beautiful or haunting though).  I wasn't nearly as confused this time around as I was when I rushed to the store to buy \\"Damnation\\". I recommend this record 100%. Give it a chance. Pick it up. Listen. Revisit it ever so often. I think by the time the next album rolls around you'll learn to appreciate it.
B005WTR4ZI|5.0|This really is a perfect book on the topic. It's a short read, but dense with well-researched information. The ideas are presented clearly and engagingly, and the authors seamlessly shed light on how and why humanity has been racing against the machine in the past and will undoubtedly continue to do so in the future. Very timely in its content, thus not neglecting to address the damaging socioeconomic effects some aspects of the digital revolution have had, it proposes upbeat yet realistic solutions for winning the race going forward, giving a nod to the advantages the human spirit possesses. It makes a bold case for the ability of the human mind to manage and exploit digital technology in beneficial ways.
B002YDTPHA|2.0|For the laughs alone, this one's worth renting--for a dollar. Indistinguishable from its predecessors except for its premise, which begins at a race track. There, a group of obnoxiously moronic, attractive, foul-mouthed college kids are the focus of a catastrophe about to happen. One of the boys has a premonition of a disaster, which begins as a multi-car mashup culminating with vehicles and various auto parts and even the stadium itself becoming shrapnel missiles attacking spectators.<br /><br />In a blink, everything's back to normal the way it was just prior to the accident. It was a vision but suddenly everything in the vision prior to the disaster is identical. From here, the film becomes a menagerie of how creative can we see someone die. And the basic question is this: do we control our fate, or does fate control us? Also, what happens if we thwart fate by intervening and saving a life? The answer in these films seems to be: fate gets really pissed! I've found these films to be a good mindless excursion, actually funnier than films that are made to be so. Maybe these films should be labeled Horror/comedies. Definitely fun for the whole family!
B004T5R2HQ|3.0|So maybe I was hoping for something different, but I was disappointed in this app. I have a great camera on my phone but this thing make it look like a 3 MP instead of the 8 MP that it is. Photos came out blurry with wavy lines. I guess it could be good to have something that can convert photos to pdf format but really that's why this should be called a pdf camera or converter and not a scanner. what they need to create is something that can use the photos in your gallery and convert them to pdf if you really need pdf format. That way you can take a decent picture to send
B0015XHQTY|5.0|Once again, Eastwood reprises his signature role as Dirty Harry in this third, and imo, funniest installment. This time Harry and his rookie partner, played by Tyne Daly,are out to catch a group of hippie terrorists who look like the Village People. Like the other previous films, Harry's blunt but effective style of police work isn't to the tastes of his superiors who want him to work within the system. Just to piss him off, they assign a female rookie to be his new partner after his old partner goes down.<br /><br />Daly is perfect in her feminist \\"I-can-do-this-job-as-well-as-a-man\\" role. Though book-smart, her lack of experience is glaring, one time almost getting her head blown off by a bazooka. Eastwood captures perfectly the sexism of the time in which this film was made, gradually warming to his female partner as the film progresses. There's a funny scene where Eastwood is in pursuit of one of the terrorists and lands literally in the middle of a porno movie. My favorite scene is the one at the barbershop belonging to a Black Panther-looking soul-brother named Mustafa who is Harry's street-level informer. Can't think of his name right now, but the same brother played in the previous films as well, as a pimp in the second movie and as a bank robber in the first one. Then there's the hip long-haired hippie-looking priest in the cathedral: \\"Hey, man, you can't bring a gun in the church!\\"<br /><br />I rank this one up there with Penitentiary 1 as far as laughs are concerned. Like I said, my favorite of the series. No one has, ever, or will do it like Eastwood. What I'd give to shake his hand.
B005I64U5C|1.0|I was very peeved when I found out the \\"digital\\" copy cannot be played on iTunes. They get around this by making you download the app for Flixster which allows you to play the movie. However before you can do this, you must create an Ultraviolet account and a Flixster account. Yes, just what I need. More stupid accounts.
B000Q9IZ5C|5.0|This was a show I didn't watch while it was on.  The series was given to me as a gift and still it  took months, and a day of total boredom to finally watch it.  I loved it, every episode was wonderful.  I had to buy  Serenity.  It was fabulous, too.  I know it's impossible,  but, I sure do wish it would return with new seasons. A  science fiction series in space-without any aliens or  transporters or smug, selfrighteous, egotistical,   comanders.  Just ordinary people. with a criminal leaning   when ncessary (mind you), trying to stay under the  radar of the meddling, overbearing, overreaching, alliance.
B000PHX4VA|5.0|What can I say, If you don't have any The Police in your music collection this is the one to buy.  Great CD.
0316134082|5.0|I love the books and had the first three Collector's Editions so I was thrilled when I got the email saying this was now one! Beautiful condtion and I just love the look :)
0316010669|5.0|As soon as I finished this book, I wanted to read it again.  I have given this book to so many people I've lost count.  As someone who works in sales or with the general public, this is a must read.  The amount of researh in this book and the insight in to human behaviour is beyond anything you believed about your own behaviour, emotions or preconceived notions.  To be made aware of human behaviour at it's most instantaneous reaction based on experience, cultural factors, familial characteristics and training will astound you.  I wanted to buy this book to make sure I can re read it at any time that I loose focus of how I am interacting and affecting other people.

B004EBUXSA|5.0|I have assembled 12 workstations for my clients with the CPU.  The only changes I have done is to also get an aftermarket CPU cooler, Cooler Master Hyper 212, for $26. For higher end workstations this is a great deal.  Amazon is recommending Corsair RAM when you click on the CPU.  NO, no, no.  I have had more trouble with that RAM than I have time to complain to you about.  Get Kingston RAM and don't skimp on the motherboard like the Asus P8Z68-V.  This will create the foundation of an awesome computer.  Add a SSD and hang on.
B003X5UFWW|5.0|Loved the acting, the drama, the music, the subtle humor and all the fight scenes.  One of the best movies I've ever seen.
B005PMNBPY|4.0|My first steps away from my parents and into a more independent lifestyle was in falling in love with Jane's Addiciton. I have been obsessed with this band and have been watching in horror as reality T.V, Satellite Parties and Twilight Soundtracks have reduced them to a circus act. They were a band that electrified a sub-culture of disillusioned youth. I understand that they no longer have the capacity to be pioneers in that regard anymore, their  bank accounts, plastic wives and lives do not permit them to be as vital. If they simply went through the motions and tried to persuade us otherwise, we would have gotten Strays pt. 2. We did not. At least I suggest we didn't.    With this album we have a band that decided to step away from their shadows and make something new and exciting.  This album will and has disappointed many fans, and for legitimate reasons. These songs may not represent your current musical taste and since it is removed from their established sound it is a bit jarring. I found myself captivated by it's warmth. Like a U2 album in minor keys with a REAL rhythm section, this album takes on a wonderful sonic personality.    I don't feel like writing anymore, because no one reads this garbage... and you shouldn't. But if you did, listen to the album with new ears. You may not like the new direction, but you should at least be grateful that they had the sensibility to not retread the same ground.

1586487981|5.0|The authors of \\"Poor Economics\\" start by contrasting the 2 polar positions found in \\"The End of Poverty\\" and \\"White Man's Burden\\" and they carefully walk not a middle ground, but on a plane above either of these simplistic viewpoints.  And in the end, \\"Poor Economics\\" is careful not to draw any \\"sweeping\\" conclusions. But the authors do offer several smaller specific viewpoints supported by their research, each of which points the way to better allocation of whatever resources we do choose to spend on poverty. Some of these observations include:   The poor often don't have access to correct critical information that could help them and are often hurt by misinformation they believe. They need credible sources of good information and a corollary is, govt misinformation undermines govt credibility and efforts. So, small investments in credible, specific useful information on nutrition, health, and education can go a long way.     The \\"poor\\" are responsible for too many of their own \\"decisions\\" that the \\"rich\\" have decided for them. In this item, almost everyone in the US would fit in the \\"rich\\" category because for example, we don't have to decide to drink clean safe drinking water, it's an almost automatic assumed fact of life. The \\"poor\\" in other countries have to know how to make water safe and decide that it's worth that effort and expense. Would anyone reading this know how to sanitize unsafe water from scratch or to fortify raw cereal?  And of course, the maxim that people live up or down to your expectations, or expectations are self-fulfilling. Especially in education, teachers who see no hope for their students will end up with failures, teachers who believe in their students will see success.  The one big picture sweeping conclusion they could have made is: there is no universal approach and every solution will be localized based not only on the local conditions, but also on the societal norms there. We have to understand a society and what drives the individuals in it before we can help.     This book is to poverty what gene therapy is to cancer treatment: not there yet, but hopeful and citing some very specific helpful research. Gene therapy and successful poverty reduction both depend of specifics.  The last thing I concluded (and this is me, not the authors) is their research shows the poor make the same less-than-perfect decisions we all do. Americans (on average) borrow too much, eat too much, and have unhealthy lifestyles that we know are unhealthy. If we get a tax refund, instead of paying down debt we buy something big and new. It's disingenuous for us to criticize the poor for their \\"bad\\" decisions about how to feed themselves or allocate their limited income when we're so bad at it ourselves.   I'd recommend this book to anyone interested in how the rich world treats countries and people in poverty. Unfortunately, I don't see it being the bestseller that either \\"White Man's Burden\\" or \\"The End of Poverty\\" is because it doesn't appeal to either extreme or use inflammatory rhetoric that will get it the kind of media attention those 2 books have.
B004G600A4|5.0|i recieved what i paid for.  the movie arrived on time for my daughter's birthday and it was undamaged. we saw it in the theater and now we can watch it together at home.
B000F1IQNC|2.0|We finally sat down and watched it after all the positive reviews we read and after the recommendations from friends and family.  And yeah we sat and watched it and yeah it isn't something we care to do again.    The only thing I can say I liked about the movie was the sets.  The sets were colorful and attractive.    I don't know if it is because we haven't read the books or what but we were all confused by this film.  The nanny never really explained about herself and the characters were all ok by this??  As the children learn her lessons the warts, moles and other \\"imperfections\\" disappear??  What is the point to her \\"imperfections\\" disappearing once the children learn their lesson?  Also, the children were indeed ill behaved; yet, the father didn't dicipline them at all because.....??  The father let the bad behavior continue and let the children have the run of the house.  The father was even fine with them terrorizing his \\"fiance\\" because he wasn't that fond of her himself??  Ahh, yes that makes the bad behavior acceptable......  My daughter asked the above questions to me and I just had to tell her I don't know.   All in all I felt the movie was rather pointless and nothing was really explained.

0385738773|5.0|By Natalie<br /><br />Once I started The Maze Runner, I didn't stop reading until I had turned the last page of its sequel The Scorch Trials. So why did I refuse to pick up James Dashner's final book in The Maze Runner trilogy for an entire week after I received it in the mail? As a reader, the anticipation of the conclusion of one of my favorite series is always nerve-wracking--especially a series like Maze Runner, with so many plot twists and unanswered questions. With the high standards that the two previous books set, I found it hard to believe that The Death Cure could ever measure up.<br /><br />However, once I started reading, I was not at all disappointed. Dashner's final installment finds Thomas and the rest of the Gladers struggling once more with WICKED as they attempt to complete the blueprint to the Flare's cure. There's so much I would love to say about this book, but with all the unexpected twists and turns, it's impossible to say much and stay spoiler-free. One of my favorite aspects of this trilogy has always been its utterly unpredictable nature. Suffice it to say, you'll be on the edge of your seat until the very last page.<br /><br />He's the master of the suspenseful plot twist, but Dashner also excels at tying up loose ends without letting them hinder the story and expanding on characters throughout a series. The Death Cure is everything that the final installment in a trilogy should be. My only complaint about this book is that I would like to see a bit more of Teresa; readers don't get much of a look into her past with Thomas. But James Dashner does everything else so well that it's easy to overlook petty grievances.<br /><br />Overall, The Death Cure takes what you love about its predecessors and adds even more mystery and depth. You definitely won't regret picking this one up--in bookstores now!
0439023521|4.0|I was never really into this Hunger Games trilogy until my girlfriends son made me read it, I knew the premise ;kids fighting to the death, last one standing wins. I've read stories like this a few times. I compare it to Robert Heinlein's 'Tunnel In The Sky', Stephen King's 'Running Man', William Golding's 'Lord of the Flies', and especially Koushun Takami's 'Battle Royale'. Every one of those amazing in there own way.   And 'The Hunger Games' IS amazing. Worthy of the books mentioned above. Much like the 'Harry Potter' series, once I objectively began reading I became hooked. Suzanne Collins writing style is comparable to J.K Rowling. The details she gives the reader are real with feeling as well as layout.   This is not just a late teen book, it will even grab the most experienced reader. Very violent and savage,in a post apocalyptic time period where the United States is no more. It is known as Panem, the central capitol of the 12 Districts. Once which had 13, the 13th District chose to rebel against the capitol, which was not tolerated and the entire district was wiped out. And now to remind the population of the slaughter of District 13, the annual Hunger Games begin. One boy, one girl from each district in a huge arena and a fight to the death.  I flew through the book and am now a fan of a great tale of perseverance, the will to survive, kill to live, hunt to stay alive and trust those you love.

Now put the bagged book in your \\"Go Bag\\" of emergency supplies or with your camping gear. Used sparingly, the pages of this book should provide fuel for starting dozens of fires for cooking or warmth.

0545265355|3.0|Girl takes sister's place in cruel battle to the death of two children in each of 12 districts by the Capital as punishment and reminder of them losing a rebellion. Protag shows super strength in fighting and is physically attractive. She is featured by the media. She defies the Capital by insisting on two survivors instead of one. At a second Hunger Game the new rebels extract her and make her their symbol in a new revolution. A lot of sickening creatures appear that have to be slain and/or dealt with. Protag anguishes and blames self for all deaths. Good thriller but for me it had too many weird and awful bad guys. Protag too mentally weak, continually down on herself, and politically correct.

B00000272N|5.0|FACELIFT is one of the best albuns of all time...All the songs are AMAZING, with the phenomenal vocals from LAYNE STALEY and the incredible heavy guitar of JERRY CANTRELL...WE DIE YOUNG, the ultra hit MAN IN THE BOX, SEA OF SORROW, I CAN'T REMENBER, IT AIN'T LIKE THAT, PUT YOU DOWN...in my opinion, this is a masterpiece...They created a metal style that many bands start to mix in their sound....Well, this is one of the most complete albuns i ever heard, without any filler moment!!! REALLY AMAZING, and one of the most relevant albuns of the music world!!!!WELL DONE, ALICE IN CHAINS!!!!! MASTERPIECE!!!!!
B0034G4OXQ|4.0|From my pov, this is a fairly good movie. The premise of the existence of a 'hereafter' is intriguing and this movie takes a unique approach, but it works only to a point. The script tells the story of three people whose lives will briefly intersect and carries the viewer through the process of what brings them together, but in the end it really doesn't make any attempt to answer the question of is there an afterlife and what happens when people die.<br />While I found the ending oddly plausible, it seemed to veer away from the main theme of the movie.<br />I gave this movie 4* because despite what I considered an uneven ending, it had an interesting script. The actors were very good as was the direction, the photography was stunning, special effects ranged from awesome to haunting, and the movie had a european feel to it. What kept it from being ultimately memorable was the somewhat low-key conclusion that wasn't completely satisying.
B0000028M7|5.0|DIRT is really great...All the songs are total amazing, with such BRILLIANT metal lyrics like on the gens THEM BONES, RAIN WHEN I DIE, ROOSTER, WOULD, ANGRY CHAIR and DOWN IN A HOLE!!!

B00004XONN|5.0|Well, RADIOHEAD really become another creature on the turn point from OK COMPUTER to KID A.....i mean, on OK COMPUTER there[s some signs that RADIOHEAD was becoming a strange psichodelic rock band...They could had done lots of Fake Plastic Trees and CREEPS, but they change their rock to something more unique and artistic....When i heard KID A at first, i thought that RADIOHEAD had TOTALLY lost the sense of what[s music!!!! What[s that????? Where[s the guitars???? Where[s the melodys????but after some spins, i gotta say that KID A is one of the MOST INTERESTING albuns of ALL TIME!!!! I don[t know how to classify what RADIOHEAD did here.....It[s just AMAZING MODERN MUSIC!!!!! By now, i think that this strange change in their sound was one of the most BRILLIANT attitudes ever!!!! RADIOHEAD stop doing conventional rock pop radio tunes to  become a piece of art....MODERN ART in MUSIC!!!!REALLY GREAT, RADIOHEAD!!!! BRAVO!!!!!
B004EPZ08O|4.0|Granted it was not as good was the first three, and after the major let down on the fourth, I had expected this one to be bad if not worst than the last one. But surprisingly this one actually delivered valuable entertainment and some pretty awesome and gruesome deaths. I especially enjoyed the ending; Because I did not see twist ending even coming. All in all it was without a doubt far, far, far more cooler and more scarier than that god awful last one they made.
B000092ZYX|5.0|HAIL TO THE THIEF is one of the best albuns from RADIOHEAD!!!! It[s a crazy collection of songs....some eletronic beats, psichodelic music textures and some guitars. bass and piano...it[s one of my favorites from the great crazy RADIOHEAD...i think HAIL TO THE THIEF is even better than KID A...it[s right there with THE BENDS and OK COMPUTER, at the top of RADIOHEAD[s best stuff....REALLY WEIRD AND GREAT!!!!!
0307341550|5.0|Gillian Flynn is now one of my favorite writers. Her books are dark but so engrossing that once you begin you feel compelled to finish. Her descriptive talent is amazing, she makes you feel as of the world of the book  has enveloped you. Love love her books. Next one please!

B0051QIGP4|5.0|I rarely listen to anything pop or rock. Aside from Elton John, Queen, Jewel, and the fabulous voice of Lady Gaga. She is a fascinating character and her voice reminds me of a mix between Freddy Mercury and Elton John.   It's the tracks that are less well known that I like the most. 'Americano' and 'You And I' and 'Hair' are just three of my favourites.   I can watch some of her interviews over and over on Youtube because she is hilarious, a real character. Her voice, stripped down to just piano is absolutely beautiful. She recently performed 'You And I' live on UK TV and it was magical.   This album is not perfect, there is a lot of overly heavy background music and I hope that she will produce an album of ballads one day?   The fact is, she is one of the most inventive characters to grace the music industry AND she is a genuinely talented musician and vocalist too.
B0050PYNP8|2.0|Paul has an okay beginning, but it falters when it becomes homophobic. The word \\"fag\\" is used at least four times that I counted in the movie's duration. Even Sigourney Weaver says it. The alien Paul is pretty annoying and I got no laughs from him whatsoever. Really, Kristin Wiig is the only bright spot here.
031603438X|4.0|I really enjoyed this book, and was surprised at how intelligent Keith Richards actually is.  I thought that it was interesting how he states that he hasn't used heroin in 30 years yet can't shake the image everyone has of a stoned out junkie.  Yes, he does appear cold hearted at times.  The death of his son being one of them.  How do you not know whether or not your son was buried or cremated?  And how do you not have a conversation with his mother about what happened?  However, the fact that he sometimes comes off as extremely self-indulgent and sometimes down right mean doesn't take away from the fact that it was a good read...
B0053Q9DQI|5.0|There have been numerous comments about the parts of the book omitted from this version.  I haven't read the book in many years and still felt an emotional reaction remembering the omitted sections of the novel (Lowood in particular.)   I think that Mia Wasikowska should win a ton of awards for her performance. She beautifully communicates the underlying fierceness and fundamental self-respect Jane has as well as intense feeling/passion with limited dialog and physical action. The effect is an emotional tension in the character like the vibration of a single violin string.  Of course, this is amplified by the score.  I love the romantic versions of Jane Eyre but I loved this one for different reasons.   Although a gothic romance, the novel is a 19th century one and the film's characters are true to this.  Rochester is not quite so Byronic.    The cinematography brings the isolation and loneliness of Jane (and Rochester) to the fore.  The lighting is also true to the 19th century as well as adding a gothic touch.     But most of all this version is about passion rather than romantic love -- the passion that can only develop between two equals.  Makes you wonder what Charlotte Bronte's life would have been if she hadn't spent her life in a freezing parsonage in Haworth watching her sisters die of tuberculosis and her brother drink himself to death.
B004D4ZZM2|3.0|I looked up the Bevington edition of the complete works of Shakespeare and was astonished to see a Kindle version available for only 99 cents.  Following the link to the kindle version, it shows \\"back cover\\" description for the Bevington edition.  I bought it, only to find out that it was the Project Gutenberg edition--without Bevington's essays or annotations--in other words a completely different \\"complete works.\\"  On top of that, there is no table of contents, so that the 2000-plus pages are impossible to navigate.  Customer service refunded my 99 cents, and I explained the problem.  Whether the description will ever be changed remains to be seen.  Caveat Emptor!
B003Y74AZ2|3.0|I wasn't expecting too much, and that's pretty much what I got (I purchased the silicone version, not the leather one...why do they combine the reviews for two different products?).  In fairness I bought it as a temporary case until I could figure out what I really want to protect my new iPhone 4S.  The biggest negative is the case puckers pretty badly wherever there are openings along the sides (like at the volume buttons, etc.), which I found so annoying I ditched it after a couple of days.  I found a Case-Mate Barely There case on clearance at an office supply store (the case I really wanted anyways and it cost less than this one!) - it provides even less protection than the AmazonBasics case, but it sure looks a lot cooler, and no puckers!
B003YL4LYI|3.0|A disclosure - I am a great fan of GRRM and a bigger fan of A Song of Ice and Fire series. I have read the first three books 3 times and the AFFC 2 times (could not stomach a third read).<br />I doubt I will ever read the ADWD a second time.<br />The book felt like a long march round and round (or a long sailing) and in the end reaching nowhere ...
B0058A11AK|5.0|Barbra Streisand continues as on of our greatest singers. In fact, as she's gotten older she's added something (experience?) to her vocals.

B00536OCZA|5.0|Being a big vinyl fan, I was extremely happy to see Dark Side re-mastered and released on 180 gram.  The packaging is great and the sound quality greater.  I was also excited to find the digital copy download so that I can take it with me whenever I want.  Can't wait for Floyd's future vinyl re-releases.
B0055V6EZE|5.0|It's a gas to hear Hugh Laurie sing.  A Brit with a southern soul.  At least on the album.  Great price, fast shipping.
0060558121|5.0|An excellent book with a deep and well-woven plot and mythology delivered in strong prose, and that well embodies Gaiman's dark and gritty style. The book holds its own as purely a good fiction, and also as a novel which makes you think. I also highly recommend Gaiman's and Pratchett's co-authored works, and Pratchett's own works. I also recommend the \\"Sandman\\" graphic novels by Gaiman; they are an excellent foyer into the graphic novel genre.
B004TTMYQG|5.0|I came from over 10 years of Palm OS experience that had a great calendar and I used it extensively. I was rather disappointed in the android one. This app is dramatically better and I highly recommend it.
B004V6MWFU|5.0|One man and one ukulele is all you need to put a great album out. This album proves that talent and not five tons of equipment and amplifiers is what makes good music. Eddie Vedder's soulful voice and simple ukulele music is a great acustic combo. You may not be banging your head to these tunes but it pays to listen to them.

B005ETA5K2|3.0|Installed the drivers (latest for 10.6.8) and worked fine at first, but stopped connecting to the internet about 30 minutes later.  Upon checking the Network Preferences, the STATUS would be Connected, but beneath that would be the following message: \\"ALFA  AWUS036NHR has a self-assigned IP address and will not be able to connect to the Internet.\\" The dot next to it was amber. When I connect using the built-in Airport (green dot), it works just fine (as always). Can anyone post a solution to fix this problem? The Network Wireless Utility by the way, when reading the Alpha, picks up 20 or more addresses so it's picking up plenty of signals just fine.
B0043EV774|5.0|Movie was a great new version of Alice in Wonderland. The 3D worked perfectly.  We all enjoyed it very much.
B005H1SDQU|5.0|Here's a great new album from Steve Hackett. He's one of the few artist who's music can be bought without listening first. It's always that good. Starting with Wild Orchids, his music keeps getting better.<br /><br />I won't give a track by track rundown of the music, but I will say it ranges from Jeff Beck style pyro-blues to huge orchestral pieces.<br /><br />Here are a few fun facts:<br />Steve's wife Jo Hackett shares writing credits on most of the songs. Jo, where's your solo work? These songs are surely stronger for your influence.<br /><br />A few tracks share credits with Steve Howe and/or Jonathon Move, which makes me think that they originated during GTR sessions all those years ago. Don't worry; they sound fresh and great.<br /><br />Chris Squire of Yes fame plays on several tracks. These must be tracks from the so called \\"Squackett\\" sessions.<br /><br />One song on the bonus disc is credited to Thijs van Leer of the famous Dutch band Focus. (Everyone let's yodel!) The song is an excerpt from Focus II (aka Moving Waves) called Eruption: Tommy. Strangely the song on the original Focus album is actually credited to Tommy Barlage of the Dutch band Solution.<br /><br />Apologies to Amazon, but I have to tell you that you can buy this music from Steve's Hackett Music (dot com) web site. You can even get the 24 bit \\"Studio Master\\" version of this album with a second bonus disc of material. As always, the bonus material is first class. The price is quite reasonable too, but the download is 1.5GB and in FLAC format.
B001VU1QGU|5.0|This amazing story of a Navy SEAL's training, and his team's mission in Afghanistan redefined the meaning of the word 'macho' for me.  I don't read many books about soldiering and war, except those pertaining to World War II, so Lone Survivor's tale of a modern American warrior knocked the wind right out of me.  How do these men survive their training, much less their combat experiences?<br /><br />If nothing else, this book will refresh your memory as to why we are in Afghanistan.<br /><br />I'd seen TV programs that gave me glimpses into the SEAL training program, but almost half of \\"Lone Survivor\\" is devoted to an extended description of what it's actually like to go through BUD/S (Basic Underwater Demolition/SEALS) and Hell Week.  The author puts you right there, pushing 'em out, hitting the surf, and rolling in the sand:<br /><br />\\"He drilled us, gave us probably a hundred push-ups and sit-ups, and he drove us up and down the big sand dune in front of the compound.  He raved at us because our times over the O-course were down, which was mostly due to the fact that we were paralyzed with tiredness before we got there.\\"<br /><br />It wasn't until the second half of the book, when the author and his SEAL team were ambushed by the Taliban that I understood why the training program was so harsh:  it was his ordeal-by-training that kept the author alive and fighting after the rest of us would have given up and died.<br /><br />Once started, this book is impossible to put down, which is not to say I agreed with all of the author's opinions, especially those concerning the Abu Ghraib prison scandal and the Geneva Convention, but at least I gained an understanding of why Marcus Luttrell feels the way he does on these subjects.
B00005JLK1|1.0|This movie is a underwhelming ride to weak plot points. The only A+ in this film is the blood & gore but most of the killings happen offscreen. The cast is so-so and so is the acting. The opening is pretty good but fails to help the film in the long run. It also has pointless jump scares. The Special effects are mediocre at best. Not to mention,the many plotholes in this film. I give Ghost Ship a 1 out of 10.
1573222038|5.0|The plot of this fine book has been summarized by previous readers, but all I can say is you are in for a treat with this book. The characters are fully developed and interesting; it reads much like a novel by Charles Dickens, with imaginatively created monikers and memorable characters. I could not put this book down, and when I did, it was very reluctantly. The writer draws you in and takes you on quite a journey. Very fine writing from a talented author. There's nothing formulaic or predictable about this story. TERRIFIC read.
B005FUTBV4|5.0|Sat down and watched this on Tuesday and I found it as a well done movie and it shows John Goodman doing something very different.
B000VE439Y|5.0|The movie lampoons religious devotion in a host of ways, such as the apocolyptic preachers, the statement that 'only the true messiah denies his divinity', the following of absurd signs (such as gourds or shoes), etc.  As John Cleese said, they make it clear very early in the movie that 'This is not Christ'. Yet in many ways, many of the depictions are truer to life that many of the so-called life of Jesus movies (I have yet to see a Jesus movie that was well done. My experience is that the bigger the claims they make about it, the worse they are)  That aside, many aspects of the movie invert the reality of the situation: for example, the crucifixions seem to be regarded by the victims as a minor inconvenience, instead of the horrific torture that it really was. And when that administator is processing the victims for their crosses, he makes it sound so urbane and civilized. (Watch Terry Gilliam's body language when Eric Idle says 'No, freedom for me.'  The sound effects when the soldiers enter the old man's house for searching are hilarious - it sounds like someone's shaking a money tin in mock immitation of the clanking of the soldiers' armour.  I would love to bring back a group of Roman soldiers who served under Pilate, and show them the famous 'Biggus Dickus' scene!
B005CK76ZA|2.0|Crap, returned, don't buy. All the reviews here thus far are dead on, save your money and get the ORG/RTI pressing.
0345495004|5.0|If the measure of a great book is how it returns in your thoughts long after you've finished it, this is indeed a great book. It's more than a \\"love story\\".  It's more about how a woman very much ahead of her time, made difficult decisions that aligned her with who she really was. So as not to spoil the ending, I'll only say who knows what the future would have held if only....
B002UM5BXW|5.0|I really didn't know what to expect since I had never read any of Anthony's books or articles before.  I have watched No Reservations quite a bit, and like the show, but I figured the book would be similar.  The book is fantastic.  Much more detailed and funny and honest than I expected.

B001EN71DG|5.0|I have not opened this set but was happy to find this set that has the original version of the first three released movies of the Star Wars trilogy, not the altered versions, but ALSO has the three altered movies, so you have the option of watching either. I got this as a gift for my husband because he wanted to get the new boxed set BUT changed his mind after learning of all the alterations and changes made to the original releases.
0385534639|5.0|I just finished this book via Audible.com, read by the incomparable Jim Dale of Harry Potter fame.  Mr. Dale is one of the reasons I wanted to get the book on audio, but it is just a good book!  It drew me in, and kept me there.  Reminded me of a bit of Neil Gaiman, a bit of Lev Grossman's The Magicians.  I was very happy with the ending, and now that I know how it all plays out, I'm starting it over!
1596432594|5.0|Before I picked up this book I didn't really know who Richard Feynman was.  I mean I heard the name, but it didn't really mean lot to me.  And then...I picked up this book.  And within 4 pages I was captivated by him and what he meant not only to our understanding of science, but our understanding of the world at large.  I didn't even get 15 pages in the book and I started looking to see what other books my library owned about Feynman, just so that I could learn more about him.  That's how well this book is put together.<br /><br />Ottaviani weaves together this coherent and captivating story from Feynman's own words.  Instead of feeling like we're being talked to by some anonymous narrator, Feynman himself talks to us.  It feels like we're sitting next to him, maybe with a good meal or a couple of drinks, just shooting the breeze.  It's a masterful way of letting us hear Feynman's story.  And the artwork works perfectly.  We can see the frustration on Feynman & other scientists faces as they face the challenges before them, from the atomic bomb to why one wheel of color seems to move faster than the other on a spinning plate.<br /><br />I can't imagine a better book to hand a high school student to help them understand the world around them better.  Or a better book to give to anyone.  This book needs to be on every library's shelf.
B004LWZW4C|1.0|There are 2 redeeming points in this movie:  1) Kevin Bacon. He is always great, even in this drivel.  2) Cameo appearance of certain actor was pretty funny.  Other than that acting was really terrible (other X-Men movies suffered from the same). January Jones and Jennifer Lawrence were especially annoying.
B005HG4C4C|5.0|When I heard the first song snippets that they put out, I wasn't too excited....even on my first listen-through of the disc, I wasn't getting it.  But the second time through, I was hooked, and now I can't stop playing it.  Give it a chance, you might not get it the first, or even second time through.  There is an amazing depth of music here.  It's sad to see Mike Portnoy go, but the band did not miss a beat in the transition, and may be even better off in the long run.  I was hoping for a great new Dream Theater disc, but I got something better than that - this one ranks at the top of them all for me!
0446547654|2.0|Too much sad, not enough happy.  A good cry is best when followed by happy.  This book really lacked the happy!
B005JU5JTI|3.0|I rented this on a day where I was starting to get sick. I had no ambition and did not want to watch another kids show with my 3 year old.  This worked perfect. It was light and fluffy and made me giggle. Miss Squirrel was awesome! I was very amused by sidekick Lynn's marshmallow playing off Elizabeth's perpetual crunchy attitude. Would have liked to see more of the gym teacher, and loved how \\"that\\" ended. It is a challenge to lead a story with such an anti-hero, but I thought it worked.  You do have to suspend your concept of reality - if this were really a school, most of these teachers/ staff would have been brought up on charges of some kind or another.
B002ZG99A4|2.0|I bought this movie and was so excited to see it again, but the surprise was huge when I put the movie on my Euro (PAL) Playstation 3. Movie didn't work at all on my PS3, because the region zone was different. I was able to see digital copy on my PC but it's picture and sound quality was horrible. I bought this version for HD sound and picture quality. Movie itself will get 5 stars! I hate these regional zones.
B004VF68AQ|4.0|OK, I understand all the reviews that criticize this for not being a clone of their first 2 studio releases (3 if you count the self-titled live debut), and there are some timeless classics on those 3 releases.  Trip Away, Whores, Pigs In Zen, Jane Says, Ocean Size, Classic Girl, No One's Leaving, Standing In The Shower Thinking, Mountain Song, 1%, Had A Dad, Been Caught Stealing, Three Days, etc. are stellar songs that may never be duplicated.  But after listening to this release back to back 3 times in a row just today, I have to say it isn't as bad as some of the fans reviewing it thus far have said it is.  As a Jane fan from the beginning, I am happy with this release.  Maybe not \\"blown away\\", but this is a good listen if given a chance.  It is not as straightforward a hard rocker as some might expect, but the songs are more along the line of some of their slower paced songs (Classic Girl and Three Days come to mind).  That is not to say it is slow from start to finish.  There are still plenty of nice riffs to go around. Perry Farrell's voice is still what it used to be, and I think these songs just need a couple of listens for some of the naysayers to get used to it.  I first heard this on iTunes as a free stream before the CD was released, and no, I was not immediately blown away, but in subsequent listens it has definitely grown on me, and as I write this, I am on about my 6th listen in total.  I do hear shades of the early releases in this.  I think true JA fans owe it to themselves to give this a try.  If you go in expecting a re-recording of the early classics, you're setting yourself up for a letdown.  But if you approach it with an open mind, I think you will be pleased with this.  And if you aren't at first, give it a few listens before dismissing it as trash.  All in all, I would give it 3 1/2 stars, but I will round up because I think the overall rating has been hurt by some of the 1 star reviews that I feel are unwarranted.    I recommend the DeluxeEdition with the live bonus CD.  While not as great a live recording as the self-titled debut, it contains some early classics.  The song list for that CD is listed on the inside cover, so you can't see it before you buy it, but here is the song list for the live bonus CD:  1. Whores  2. Ain't No Right  3. Ted, Just Admit It  4. Superhero  5. End To The Lies  6. Three Days  7. Mountain Song  8. Been Caught Stealing  9. Ocean Size  10. Jane Says  11. Stop!
B004SUDQ72|4.0|Typical Cronenburg fare. Very interesting concept, especially if you're into videogames & I'm not talking about \\"Tron\\", \\"Lawnmower Man\\" or \\"Max Headroom\\". Cronenburg never really deals with \\"real\\" technology. Everything about his films seems to combine the biological with the technological, the latter always given a bizarre twist. Nice companion piece to \\"Videodrome\\" with a great cast.
B003INBNXO|5.0|This movie is AWESOME!  This is a period piece film, about Japan invading China.  Also, about the man who inspired and trained Bruce Lee.  Donnie Y is a great fighter/actor. Very cool and he kicks azz big time.  Every night I do the Ip Man moves on my man.  All that's missing is him sliding down the pole after I punch him in rapid succession!  Just kidding.  My whole family LOVED this pic.  Part II is good also, but not as good as Part I.  Do youself a favor, see this pic.
B000P0J0EW|5.0|A wonderful drama about finding hope where one least expects to find it. Also, one of the most unexpected and fantastic endings of any film. If you appreciate good drama, and great acting, I highly recommend this film!
B001DF68MA|4.0|All in all, I like this bike seat. My one year old fits well in it. I love that he can sit in front of me when we ride. It gives me better peace of mind being able to see him. However, it isn't super stable, it has a tendency to wobble a bit. Id feel better if the seat back came up higher, and if there was a chest clip like on my child's carseat.
B0042RJWTC|5.0|was a gift for my self I saw the first 12 on Net Flicks but I loved it and could not weight for it to come on Net Flick so I looked on different web store it was $60-S100.

B005M92MJ6|3.0|This album got old fast.. Why? There's no verses. All that drives most of the songs is these lingering on the same choruses over and over again. The writing is great, the instruments are near perfect and production brilliant. Some songs have decent structure and verses,thats why it got 3, but minus 2 for a lack of creativity and being repetitive with the lyrical structure. Neophyte or overzealous fans can gripe me, wont make a difference. I've been with tool since the start (saw them in 89) Thats how you write a song. Maybe maynard should get justin chancellor to write for puscifer. HA'
1423140591|4.0|The Percy Jackson series relies on riffing on classic mythological concepts and bringing them into the modern world (previous books have featured the entrance to Hades in Los Angeles, Mount Olympus in New York City and Hera's Garden in Oregon). In this book, Percy Jackson finds himself in the Roman demigod camp located in Berkeley after being pursued by a pair of gorgons. On arrival, his motivations are questioned and he must venture North to Alaska to challenge the threat of the titan Gaia and her giants.<br /><br />Riordan paces the book fairly well but it feels like we have tread the same ground before in his previous book, The Lost Hero, which featured an amnesiac demigod switching sides and attempting to stop Gaia. It's handled competently but the plot feels a bit recycled. This book represents the second book Riordan has spent setting up the sequel series and though they have been good so far, it still feels like a long time to get to the action.  Moreover, it suffers from the series' previous issues of relying on the source materiel to the extent that anyone familiar with Classical Mythology should be able to predict the outcome of the story.<br /><br />Still, for a young adult novel, Son of Neptune is uncompromising. The efficient military brutality of the Roman demigods is brought into the forefront and we never cut away for brutal monster deaths. By the same token, the Greco-Roman gods aren't altered to make them more \\"kid-friendly\\" and appear in their wild, cold and borderline sociopathic glory. Caught between vicious threats from the titans and the bitter indifference of their divine parents, Riordan makes it very easy to sympathize with the demigods.<br /><br />Flaws aside, Son of Neptune is very well done and a worthy addition to the Percy Jackson stable. Definitely worth a look for younger readers and even I, a twenty-one year old college student, managed to enjoy it.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|What an absolutely magnificent and deeply moving book!  It's puts me easily in the category of wanting all my friends to read it which is made easy by Kindle.  May young adults jump right in, but, really, this is a book for all and should be firmly in the adult reading category.  Do not hesitate, The Book Thief will long stay with you.
B000R7GKQE|5.0|Great series to get into, start watching it if you haven't yet! Trust me it is worth your money if your interested in dead, scary monsters

B005VGWT2K|5.0|A documentary on a music celebrity can be measured by content and insight - what footage did they access and who was willing to contribute and what new light did it shed on the subject? On the first point Martin Scorsese knocks the ball out of the park. Though I didn't feel I knew George any better than before by the end, I was treated to nearly four hours of dazzling and emotionally moving entertainment.<br /><br />I watched both parts of the film at UK preview and at no point did my attention or enthusiasm flag. In fact I would have happily sat through any outtakes! This beautifully crafted film is packed with concert footage, home movies, press conferences, interviews, photos and documents that I've never seen before, even though I've been researching the Beatles quite heavily for several years for Beatles Songwriting Academy. There are interviews with (or at least footage of) everyone you would hope to see. Beatles, wives, brothers, son, Pythons and peers. Everyone from Eric Clapton to Eric Idle.<br /><br />The documentary is constructed entirely from interviews and clips without explanation or analysis. The closest we get to a voiceover is Dhani Harrison reading excerpts from his father's diary and letters to his mum. Though the film is visually stunning it's strange watching the practically square picture forced upon us by the source material. Equally quirky is the sound editing. Scorsese doesn't know the meaning of 'fade'. All the music cuts brutally, sometimes after a few seconds. Sometimes this is cool. Mostly it's odd. The film is largely chronological and there are some great juxtapositions of sound and visuals like All Things Must Pass accompanies footage of the WW2 bombers that plagued the Liverpool of Harrison's birth. The first part covers George's life up to the White Album.<br /><br />It's hard to pick out favourite parts. But Harrison's obvious delight watching archive footage of the Beatles miming This Boy, laughing and singing along, is one. The Beatles performing If I Needed Someone, Harrison playing What Is Love? with Billy Preston, and seeing the Travelling Wilburys in the studio would be others.<br /><br />There are moments of laugh out loud humour, especially TV footage of crusty professors discuss the significance of Pop music while Beatles and Mick Jagger seeth like captive wild animal in the background and Tom Petty recounting Harrison arriving at his house with a trunk full of ukeleles. But Harrison's story of how Lennon and McCartney inspired him to start composing is the best - \\"If John and Paul can write [songs] everybody must be able to\\". The Maharishi (a spiritual Joe Pasquali) and Phil Spector (a croaking, unblinking vision of craziness with a permanent twitching thumb) also provide some unintentional humour.<br /><br />Scorsese deserves praise for not going down the revisionist myth making route trodden by the Anthology series, especially as Olivia Harrison was one of his producers. Olivia is honest, though vague, about George's infidelity as is Klaus Voorman is about his drug problems. But the lack of a narrator almost makes George a mirror in which we see his world. We know he was loved, deeply, by friends - racing drivers, comedians and film makers, musicians, but we don't whether he was truly loveable. Terry Gilliam describes George as a mix of \\"grace, humour and a weird kind of angry bitterness\\" but what made him that way? Did he ever find a release from that bitterness? Was he a good father? Nearing death Harrison asked Olivia if he had been a good husband. She never tells us what her answer was.\\"What's the secret of a long marriage?\\" She asks herself. \\"Don't get divorced\\".<br /><br />It may sound strange but the highest point for me was simply hearing the music. Listening to Here Comes The Sun and While My Guitar Gently Weeps I was almost moved to tears at the transcendent beauty of those recordings.<br /><br />Perhaps the fact that the film cause me to fall in love with the music allover again is it's greatest recommendation.
1401216676|5.0|Amazing! Rare are comic books which stay as incredible, even after so many years!   \\"Batman: The Killing Joke\\" is one of the best Batman comics ever, not only due to the color composition or the story line, but because the Batman Universe was rarely as well described as here.   Focusing on the the duo Joker/Batman, and there never ending fight, is a recurring idea in the DC universe. However, successfully put the Joker mind in the first plan has never been done so well!  I need to add a point though. The way the Joker history is described, and the quality of this story, have been used along the years by some as an actual DC history fact, while it is not. Be assure that something happen to the Joker, which made him who he is now. But the answer has been lost in his crazy mind.   And the way the Joker history is described here is only a mental illustration of the idea he's trying to develop: A sane person can turn crazy, only due to one bad day.   Of course, this is only my opinion, but I think it is shared by most.  Anyway, read it, that's an order!
B005WGBQ9G|2.0|I really enjoyed the first season and have just completed reading the graphic novel series. All in all, the AMC series does a good job. Not better than the graphic novel series, of course. Pretty good, but now great.   I expected more from the Season 2 premiere. For one thing, and let me say that this is true for most TV series from regular TV to Showtime, the characters are written to do stupid things in order to drive the \\"drama\\". What are these stupid things? One big one is letting a 10 year boy approach a deer in the wild because...?! I'm not a huge hunter type but writers, this is so stupid. Really? Another, dropping your guard just because its daylight? There are other moments in this episode, that follow this type of TV series style formula. So I beg you writers, or maybe their bosses, please don't fall into this trap. Create something original, expand on the Zombie genre with fresh eyes and take it to the next level. Do something original for pete's sake. Or, I, like so many others will just stop watching.

B000X67ZZE|5.0|If you've always wanted to read a book about spiritual  inspiration, but didn't feel you had the time, this is the book for you.  The four principles are easily understood. There are many clear examples.  Ruiz's style is straight forward and pleasant.  My one criticsm is that maybe it is too repetitive.  Otherwise, the principles can be put into practice immediately.

The audio is beyond amazing. The 7.1 sound had my 2000 watt DTS system, in overdrive.  This set is worth the money.I preordered Jurassic Park bluray box, when Tuesday arrives it is going to be similiar to Santa Claus
B0058RN85O|5.0|Fantastic DVD of the Best Comedy on TV. No car chases or crashes, no explosions, no bloodshed, no vampires, no in-your-face sexual titillation----just excellent writing, acting, and delivery. Every member of each of these families makes you fall in love with and care about them with their hilarious quirks, interactions, and constant and obvious love for one another. That is something singular on TV nowadays.
B0052KJ5TK|4.0|In the first two rotations of this NEW 3DD album I thought like some of the other not so good reviewers did. Now that I have really listened to the cd a few more times I JUST LOVE IT!  Heavier than my first impression.  LIVE NOV 19! See Ya
B002ZG976U|4.0|My husband and I enjoyed Burlesque and thought it was made for Cher and she didn't disappoint.  Cristina Aguilera's performance was fantastic.  And the remaining character actors' performances were very good.  Yes, it is a little soapy but the music and acting more than made up for what is lacking.  It is a fun musical rather than a classic (or classy) Broadway 5-Star musical.
B000UVT3OI|5.0|Great compilation of the best of the best songs! I was a fan long ago and had misplaced my G.B. CDs. This is really a great set! Love it.
0439023491|5.0|Few books ever draw me into a story so well that I find myself wanting to slam the book shut because I'm angry... Angry at their situation... Angry at the injustice... Angry because I find myself saying \\"If that was me...\\" Catching Fire was just as good as the first... Drawing me further into a cast of characters I have come to love and enjoy... Katnis, Petea, Haymitch, all are back again and find themselves thrust back into the arena in a twist I never saw coming... This time their approach and position have changed... Absolutely amazing... My only complaint: Is that just when I felt as if I were about to find out more about Gale, Prim, & Katnis mother they suddenly disappear from the story... Oh well.. Book three here I come... Can't wait to see where this series goes next.
B005CM9DX6|5.0|I have enjoyed Heritage as much as any of Opeth's ablums, and maybe more, despite the \\"change\\" that so many reviewers are focused on.  Every one of Opeth's albums has sounded different from its predecessors, which is the whole point in creating, or buying, a new album.  I bought Heritage simply because I wanted to hear a good Opeth album, and that's exactly what this is.  If it sounded the same as earlier albums, I would have been disappointed.  I don't want 8 carbon-copies of Blackwater Park (or any other album); I already own it.  I was a little disappointed, however, that the CD does not contain CD-text info for the album and track names and that the CD does not contain the bonus tracks.  Pyre is an excellent song and I would like to be able to hear it in my car without MP3 compression.  These are small issues that don't justify a lower score.
B00005R62N|5.0|Bought this as a gift for my boyfriend.  He loves Judas Priest and needed this for his collection.  He says it is a great cd.
B003NB8K8W|5.0|great product. i bought these pants for my husband who knew about the range, they fit great and are great quality. the package arrived in no time and i got a discount to boot, hooray!
B004VF68AQ|4.0|Okay, is this the rock album of the year?  Hardly...    But Jane's Addiction still has it, but I can definitely tell the tank is running on empty.  Be it the uncoordinated studio issues with a bassist or whatever, this is hardly the Jane's Addiction of old.  My first ever Jane's Addiction song was True Nature off of their 2003 album Strays.  I first heard it on the video game MLB 2005 when I was 14 years old.  From that moment on, I was hooked.  As the years passed I looked more into Jane's and bought their first two studio albums and their 2003 album as well and loved them.  Three Days, Mountain Song, Ocean Size, True Nature, Just Because.  Those are some sick sick rock songs right there.  When I heard End to the Lies I thought we were all in for a treat.  But sadly, this was hardly the Jane's of old.  I gave the album a couple solid listens and just couldn't get into it.  So many tracks after Irresistible Forces sound so mellow and contemporary.  They don't really have anything special about them that pulls you into the songs.  The reason I give this 4 stars is the effort.  Perry, Dave, and Steve put a lot of work into giving the fans some music we've all been waiting years and years for.  And we all greatly appreciate it.  Will I listen to this album religiously, no.  But I'd be lying if I didn't say I'll be browsing through my iPod and giving it a listen now and again.  A solid try, but just short on this one....
030726999X|5.0|This book is the fascinating conclusion to an amazing trilogy (originally supposed to be 10 books long) written by Stieg Larsson.  It was the ending I was looking for, but getting there was the amazing part.  I had a great time reading this book and I could barely put it down long enough to make or eat a meal.  Thoroughly enjoyable from cover to cover.
B003EV6DBW|5.0|There's the doctor, his weird creatures, and then the aliens.  Great in blu-ray.  A kiss-o-gram girl, absurd riddles, witty lines, fantasy creatures aplenty, plots that twist and turn any mind watching.  \\"Never underestimate a Celt.\\" Suits my humor, hhhaahahah.  It's fantasy nonsense and a delightful set of movies.  Love'm.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|I'm generally disappointed when reading a book that receives a lot of early hype, but The Night Circus is the exception to that rule.  The book is beautifully written, and its stuffed with amazing details.  I think it's the density and ingenuity of these striking details that really differentiates the book, and let's the reader buy into the world of wonder and magic that the author is trying to create. For once, you can believe the hype!
0439023513|2.0|A great beginning with Hunger games and it grew greater with Catching fire. But was a very bad ending.  I wish a better ending was in place.
B004SI0VL8|5.0|I remember this book from when I was a child, and have been looking for it since I had my little boy.. I'm so happy I finilly found it.. its in great condishion!!! And is perfect.. I cryed when I read it to my little boy... thank u sooo much
B005OUB7MQ|5.0|Feist has one again crafted a solid and beautiful album that could outdo her previous work! Every song on this album is expertly crafted and sound amazing. The lyrics once again stand out, acheing with sadness, beauty, and mystery. Stunning writing and it ties in amazingly with the music. Haunting, exciting, fun, and beautiful, Feist's Metals is definently one of my favorite records this year. I expect this one to be a fixture in my playlists for quite awhile.
B004RCUJ9E|4.0|This is a pretty good and enjoyable game.  Easy on the eyes and enjoy it a lot. Good work dev but make it so it can be a two player game and get your 5* status.
0061729078|4.0|Doors of Perception is an account and dissertation in support of mind-expanding practices told in a way that only Aldous Huxley could.  If you like Aldous Huxley's writing, his social agendas, and/or are generally curious about him and his counterparts of the 60s this is worth the read.
B004L07KWQ|5.0|Then I read some reviews & found that this app is actually quite good..<br />No visible menu items (blank screen) is good feature for kids so that they don't accidently press exit, clear buttons etc.<br />One option you/kids can play/enjoy is, keep your one finger on screen, move other finger (keep some distance between fingerS) on screen.. It will draw straight lines with differnt colors.. Or move both fingers in same direction to draw different colored parallel lines.. or move fingers in different direction (clockwise/anti clockwise).. (may be I don't know how to put this in words :))
B005HPA2XI|3.0|To preface, I first discovered Mastodon when I was in high school after I picked up \\"Leviathan\\" at a local record store solely on the merits of the awesome cover art. Since then I've been a huge fan and collector of their music. My expectations for all of their releases has always been high, but have always been exceeded by the bands remarkable ability to craft fantastic records with larger-than-life archetypal themes, over the top gorgeous artwork and packaging, and above all, stellar musicianship.<br /><br />Mastodon has already released 4 excellent album (5 if you count \\"Lifesblood\\"), with each album setting the bar higher for the next album. For the first time Mastodon did not top themselves. Understandably, the band's progressive masterpiece \\"Crack the Skye\\", could be considered to be nearly impossible to top and will probably remain the bands magnum opus. Mastodon knows this. So instead of trying to top Crack the Skye, Mastodon simply went in another direction with their music.<br /><br />Unlike the previously long and arduous recording process were the band placed particular focus on every little detail that went into \\"Blood Mountain\\" and \\"Crack the Skye\\" albums, \\"The Hunter\\" was quickly written and recorded. The album sees Mastodon moving in a more hard rock/ traditional heavy metal direction, although there are definitely still some proggy moments here and there. Opener \\"Black Tongue\\" and the later \\"Spectrelight\\"(feat. Scott Kelly) echo the bands sludge metal roots, both of which were pleasing to hear. Also the album is fairly lighthearted this time around; the bands signature sense of humor can easily be found in the lyrics and song titles. Otherwise, overall I'm not the biggest fan of the new direction Mastodon took...<br /><br />The bad: For one, the album feels more like a compilation of songs just thrown in together. There is no unifying theme or concept or even a good or interesting logical progression from song to song. I wouldn't go so far as to call the music on here filler material, but the songs to me do come of as very 'sameish'; it feels like the tracks were just being cranked out of a Mastodon assembly line, with no real purpose or feeling behind them. I wouldn't be a really far off assumption to guess that \\"The Hunter\\" was just recorded and released for the sake of recording and releasing a new album. I suppose to further reiterate what other critics reservations are about this album, by and large it seems like Mastodon decided to stay closer to their comfort zone; they didn't push the envelope and they did't try to touch their audience this time around, and therefore did not release anything nearly as intriguing as they have in the past. In other words, it is unlikely that I would choose to listen to this record over and over again like I would any of their other releases.<br /><br />Also, as a side note, the Deluxe Edition with the DVD wasn't really worth it. I can't imagine anyone wanting to watch it more than once, same goes for the 'augmented reality' experience. Having to download the bonus tracks with warner bros. downloading program was annoying as well... I think the jewel case version has cooler artwork anyway.<br /><br />The Hunter is not a bad album, it's just not very captivating work. The songs are well written, but are not challenging to the listener. There are some interesting moments to found but also some very stale moments. This is the first time I have had a very mixed/split down the center experience with a new Mastodon record, but I still consider them to be my favorite metal band and will support them until their next release.<br /><br />Hope this review helped.material, but the songs to me do come of as very 'sameish'; it feels like the tracks were just being cranked out of a Mastodon assembly line, with no real purpose or feeling behind them.

B005I64U5C|1.0|Like a number of reviewers here I bought this combo-pack for the digital movie too.  Trying to support the legit ownership of a digital copy.  DC Comics and Warner Brothers have failed miserably here with their partnership with Flixster and this so called company UltraViolet.  To \\"own\\" your digital copy you must register with Flixster and somehow link an account into the UltraViolet website.  After a few days of trying this - complete failure!  There must be no one at either company supporting this.  We are being forced to support another portal, another format and very few devices (if any) that can play ultraviolet content.  Amazon is pretty liberal with their return policies, and I am considering returning this combo-pack.    As for the movie - I give it a five star.  Its a fun ride.  But for this releases utter lack of respect for the consumer a solid one-star.
0385534639|5.0|This book was such a fantastic ride through a beautifully painted world. it was poetic and artistic. i loved the adventure. i look forward to a second book???  it was transporting, mystical, and sensual. one of the best books that i have read in a very long time.
0553801473|2.0|With this latest book Martin has found a steady predictable pattern. It goes like this:<br /><br />Stalling, stalling, stalling , stalling, interesting, boring, stalling, stalling, exciting (a few paragraphs, not a chapter), boring, boring, boring, stalling, interesting, boring, stalling, stalling, exciting (again only a few paragraphs), boring, boring, boring, stalling, stalling, stalling, depressing, depressing, depressing.<br /><br />You come to realize that when something exciting happens, you will turn the page, the chapter will end abruptly and you will be whisked away to the most boring threads he has, even if he has to make a few new irrelevant threads to do it.<br /><br />What I have come to realize is that my initial expectations were wrong. I expected an epic adventure, but Martins intent does not seem to be to write a \\"story\\" in the usual sense. That is to say, it isn't meant to have a beginning a middle and an end. There is no character who comes from humble beginnings, works through his trials and saves Westeros in the end. What Martin is writing is more like one of those generational dramas. The characters mill about and then die and their sons and cousins mill about and then die. The value in this type of book is that it gives you a thorough look at life in an interesting time and place, but they are seldom what I would call entertaining.<br /><br />If I had known this would be a generational drama instead of an epic adventure I would not have bothered in the first place. Martin can be a great writer when he wants to, but he is in desperate need of a strong editor who can help him with plotting and pacing. I will not be buying the next books when they come out. Instead, if by some miracle he lives long enough to finish them all, I will have a look at the final chapters and decide then if there is enough payoff to justify sludging through the final books.
B004JVXTL8|3.0|This movie was ok, but I was annoyed by the ending.  It was kind of phony is all I can think of at the moment.  It was like looking at a Blair Witch documentary.  Basically, I don't think I would watch anything else like if for fear I will be wasting a few minutes of precious time I could spend on something more worthwhile.  I will have to put this one in the B category.
B004SBX112|5.0|Where is ham-o-ween? Amazon market is forgotten again? Hopefully we will see it soon. This app is so awesome, please please please we want the new episodes with the new bird!
B000021Y7X|2.0|I bought this DVD a while back to replace my aging VHS video. Naturally I expected to get the same concert film only with better sound and picture quality however that was not to be the case. The first thing I noticed was that two great tracks were missing, \\"Cities\\" and \\"Big Business / I Zimbra\\". Actually the tracks are included but they are separate \\"bonus\\" tracks and they have not been converted to wide screen like the rest of the tracks. The best thing about this concert was the unique concept of building up the stage as it progressed. And because of this you absolutely ruin the film by removing segments or showing them out of order. Its kind of like cutting up a priceless painting and putting the pieces back together in a different order. It's almost a sacrilege. Well you might be saying to yourselves at this point that its worth it for the superior sound quality of digital media but unfortunately you don't even get that. I have listened to the original so many times that I know every little sound by heart and when I first played this DVD I noticed that certain sounds were missing. In fact it was so bad that I thought that one of the channels must be out on my sound system. For example in most places on the DVD Alex Wear's guitar can barely be heard at all. Also certain sounds have completely been dropped. For example where Alex points his guitar at a running David Byrne like it's a gun there should be a sound effect there which is now completely absent. Basically it's just a terrible mix. I mean I understand that when you have three guitars playing at once plus a bass guitar you have to lower the volume on some of them in the mix to not have it sound jumbled but you should still be able to hear all the instruments clearly. The original mix was just right as far as I'm concerned and in any case no mix should be so bad that it makes you think that your sound system is broken. Anyway if you still have a VCR player or DVD VCR combo as I do I would recommend tryingto find the original VHS tape instead, especially if you have never seen this one before. You should see it for the first time the way it was meant to be seen.
B002ZG99QS|4.0|So I had kinda gotten the impression that nobody liked this movie and that it sucked. No one was willing to watch it with me, for some reason. Maybe because the first one sucked, I don't know. I don't really remember the first one very well, considering the last time we used the VCR was...a long time ago. I was probably ten when I last saw Tron. I do recall that it wasn't terribly impressing, so that's something.  Anyway, I liked this movie. It started out with a not-particularly-likable main character. The kid has daddy issues and doesn't see the common sense of taking over the company himself rather than playing the occasional practical joke on them, which probably cost them a good deal of money. In this particular area, the writing is lacking. The character shows himself to be a dynamic character, sure. He learns from his experiences and comes out with a greater respect for what his mentor has been saying all his life, but this is not presented well, I think. \\"You're right.\\" he says.  \\"About what?\\" Alan asks.  \\"Everything.\\"  The problem is that this particular interchange is not explained very well. I, for one, had no idea what the \\"everything\\" was. For all I knew, it meant he should take out the trash.  So it could've used some work.  The story, however, mostly takes a backseat to the graphics. Most of the time, they are spectacular. In fact, I almost got a headache from all the spectacular graphics. Some of the time, like with the digitally-altered face of Clu, it's kinda obviously CGI, but that's OK, considering it IS a movie about a CGI WORLD.  For some reason, despite a lot of things not working well in this movie, I really liked it. It was pretty clean, it was pretty slick, and all-around OK.  Though I think perhaps a good deal of my liking it was because of Olivia Wilde...oh well.
0062011847|4.0|It is with a heavy hear that I give this 4 stars. I have read every pratchett book ever written, even though I started in the middle with Men-at-Arms. (Remember this one: Colon: Can you kill a man?; Angua: How long will i have?) But the last time I had the just-finished-the-latest-Pratchett feeling was with Going Postal. After Moist's lackluster performance in Making Money, I thought, hang on, this might be one of those things, wait for the next one, then we got Midnight and my misgivings were quieted. But......Snuff.....where to start?   Now I love Vimes, I want to BE Vimes when I grow up. And Thud was his best performance ever. And I searched in vain in the book for the next hidden facet of this cop. I did not find it. What I did find was: a crime, a chase, Sam Vimes, loving-husband-doting-father-but-duty-always-comes-first-don't-harm-my-family, a very evil bad guy with no redeeming qualities, a group of beings that needs understanding and saving..... Did I hear someone say Night Watch? Thud? Or Unseen Academicals? (don't even get me started on that one!) That's right, all of those themes are here in this book. Now, I love the way Pratchett intertwines humor with human faiings and current issues, but I would have liked less of the \\"my heart bleeds for this downtrodden people\\" and more of the wit that makes you laugh even as you search inside your own hypocrisy.  The characters: Sam Vimes is a hero on a mission. Fight with the local blacksmith? check. Chase bad guys through a terrifying flood? Check. Give advice to uppity girls on how to land husbands? HUH? A one page speech to aforementioned very evil guy while being tossed about on a barge? Pull the other one, its got bells on! And that mystical relationship with the Summoning Dark, which sounded very spine-tingling in Thud but now really feels like filler. Quis custodiet ipsos custodes? who watches the watchman, Mr. Vimes?  Willikins: butler with a warrior's heart (or brass knuckles), fastidious Willikins, now suddenly bosom buddy and sidekick, who can interrupt his master and go on lone-warrior missions. Not that I mind their close relationship but the clear line that he always maintained between his love for the family and knowing his betters made him such a great character, and I don't see that any more.  The reason previous Sam Vimes novels were such deliriously good reads was because of the intricate relationship between Vimes and his team. Without Carrot, Angua, Fred and Nobby, and away from the cobblestones of Ankh-Morpork, Sam Vimes seems lost and incomplete, thus resorting to what he does best: all out, no-holds-barred, bloodhoundogged pursuit of the crime. It gets monotonous after a while, and Flutter and Beedle and Stratford just aren't multi-dimensional enough to hold our attention.  Oh, and Sybil's being relegated to the role of lady of the house holding parties and waiting for her warrior to come home, not cool! Even young Sam saw more action.  And Nobby nobbs might have a future with a goblin, who may or may not have out-of-this-Discworld musical talent, or other mysterious powers.  I know reviewers have wondered whether Pratchett is indeed writing his novels by himself or if there's a shadow author somewhere. I am going to give him the benefit of doubt. I believe Pratchett wrote those books, i can see glimmers of the Sam Vimes who stood up against the dragon king, and made sure his baby boy did not miss story time even when he was trapped in an underground cave, but he seems a little lost. Maybe the Ducal tights are reducing blood flow to the brain. Hope you are all better next time, and I sincerely hope there will be a next time for all the Watchmen.
0205313426|5.0|I. Elementary Rules of Usage<br />1) We still need to be using the apostrophe s introjection without the consideration of the last consonant. This means the Charles' cat becomes Charles's cat.<br />2) When creating almost a list of things that contain more than just two items use a comma. For example: The boy's bike was green, white, and gold.<br />3) Use commas in phrases that would usually be parenthetic. This means if something was to be placed in parenthesis then phrase such as a direct title in the midst of a sentence as follows. If, Sir, you decide not to eat the soup that is fine!<br />4) The next thing the book covers is the idea of placing commas where two part sentences begin being introduced. For example if the words or, as, nor, for, or while, even but appear then you should preface them with a comma.<br />5) Independent clauses should never be separated by a comma, but should always be separated by a semi-colon. This allows for you to not have to use a period, but still separates the ideas.<br />6) Do not use periods in place of commas. This means do not separate sentences that should flow together.<br />7) When creating a list preface it with a colon. The example here would be: His bag consisted of three items: a wallet, a razor, and a toothbrush.<br />8) The dash is used as something stronger than comma, less formal than a colon, and more relaxed than parenthesis. This is something I still yet to feel comfortable using in my writing mainly because it is used when you feel all other punctuation is inadequate.<br />9) You want to use a singular verb after words such as each, either, everyone, everybody, neither, nobody, someone. Verbs are to match the number of subjects.<br />10) Use the proper case of pronoun. Do not use the wrong form of pronouns in your writing. For example: Howard and I stayed home.<br />11) A participial phrase at the beginning of the sentence is used to refer to the subject later in the sentence. This means that the participial phrase cannot be used to describe a subject before.<br />II. Elementary Principles of Composition<br />12) Once you choose a design in writing be sure that you stick to it. You do not want to change your style of writing half way through your writing.<br />13) Be sure that your paragraphs in your writing are there to serve the purpose of your writing. Begin each paragraph either with a sentence that suggests the topic or with a sentence that helps the transition.<br />14) Always remember to use and active voice rather than passive. This means to write from a present form rather than a past as often as possible.<br />15) Be sure that in your writing you keep your writing positive. This means try to avoid statements such as not as often as you can.<br />16) Use language that is specific and concrete. Do not overstate your sentences. Be sure that you keep them concise if possible.<br />17) It is important in writing to omit words that are needless. This means that you do not want to ramble on in your writings.<br />18) It's not bad to have some loose sentences. Be careful of using too many loose sentences in a row.<br />19) As you write take ideas of similar form and express them as close to the same as possible. The example of this is the be attitudes in Matthew 5.<br />20) Keep related words together. The author expresses this to be sure that your writing is not given over to ambiguous statements that do not make clear sense.<br />21) When writing be sure you do not change the tense of your writing. If you start in present stay in present.<br />22) Things you wish to emphasize should be stated at the end of the sentence. These are sometimes referred to as emphatic words.<br />III. A few matters of form<br /><br />The author takes the opportunity here to address forms of writing that are commonly misused. Things like headings, margins, and References.<br />IV. Words and expressions commonly misused<br /><br />This is the area where the author addresses the common misuseof words and expressions.<br />V. An Approach to style<br />1) Be sure that your writing puts you into the background. That you are not at the forefront of your writing.<br />2) There are many rules of writing, but sometimes this means that we need to step outside the rules and find our own language and style of writing.<br />3) Be sure you have a design for your writing. Do not neglect your emotions for the sake of design sometimes it is good to step outside of the mold of your writing to fully express your feelings.<br />4) Be sure you use nouns and verbs in order to fill in the perceptions of your writing. It is good to give deep description in order to make your writing pop and to draw readers in.<br />5) It is ok to revise and rewrite your works. This means you do not have to get it right the first time. Allow for major surgery on your paper.<br />6) Do not be too wordy. As many of us write we are told to make papers a certain length therefore are forced to make things longer than they need to be.<br />7) Do not put your readers on guard. Overstatement is a common fault of most writers.<br />8) Avoid qualifiers, words like little, very, rather. These create a sense of insecurity in the writing.<br />9) Do not point the writing to yourself when writing about a different subject. Readers want the information being pointed to not just the perspective of the writer.<br />10) Do not use weird spelling or slang in your writing. This creates a disconnect from the reader.<br />11) Do not tell all. It is good at times to be sparing and not reveal too much.<br />12) Do not construct awkward adverbs. Things like the word tangledly. These are hard to read and disrupt the flow of your writing.<br />13) Be sure that the reader knows who is speaking. Do not put your phrases \\"he said, she said, or he stated\\" in the wrong places.<br />14) Do not use million dollar words if a penny word will suffice. If you use big words people will know you can use a dictionary, but then you force your reader to use a dictionary to understand your writing.<br />15) Be sure that you do not use dialect unless you understand it well. This means do not use ungrammatically correct terms in your writing unless you know how to properly use them.<br />16) Again be clear and specific. Do not be ambiguous or scattered in your writing.<br />17) Do not inject your own opinions into your writing. Too many of us tend to give our opinion on the way that things should be viewed. Do not do this in your writing.<br />18) Use figures of speech sparingly. When you use metaphors make them clear and do not compare a swordfish to an hourglass.<br />19) Do not take short cuts at the cost of clarity. Shortcuts can be self-defeating in a lot of ways.<br />20) The use of foreign languages is strongly frowned upon. It does no good, but to show the knowledge of the writer. In other words write in English.<br />21) Better to write within the standard rules rather than escaping away to natural tongue and speech. Write according to the rules not off beat language.<br /><br />My Personal Opinion of the book is that it is really helpful in clearly and concisely stating the rules of writing to the reader. He uses a very clear Roman numeral construct that makes it clear in the points that he is trying to make. I really enjoyed reading the book.<br />I plan to apply as much of the book as possible, but more than anything I would like to apply the comma rules to my writing as I grow in better understanding of them. This was a hard thing for me to grasp, but would like to continue in growth in this area of my writing. I would like to be sure my writing is clear and concise as well. I tend to use a lot of ambiguous statements.<br />I highly recommend this book to others who struggle with their writing. I feel like it was very helpful in me better understanding the rules of writing.you are not at the forefront of your writing.  2) There are many rules of writing, but sometimes this means that we need to step outside the rules and find our own language and style of writing.  3) Be sure you have a design for your writing. Do not neglect your emotions for the sake of design sometimes it is good to step outside of the mold of your writing to fully express your feelings.  4) Be sure you use nouns and verbs in order to fill in the perceptions of your writing. It is good to give deep description in order to make your writing pop and to draw readers in.  5) It is ok to revise and rewrite your works. This means you do not have to get it right the first time. Allow for major surgery on your paper.  6) Do not be too wordy. As many of us write we are told to make papers a certain length therefore are forced to make things longer than they need to be.  7) Do not put your readers on guard. Overstatement is a common fault of most writers.  8) Avoid qualifiers, words like little, very, rather. These create a sense of insecurity in the writing.  9) Do not point the writing to yourself when writing about a different subject. Readers want the information being pointed to not just the perspective of the writer.  10) Do not use weird spelling or slang in your writing. This creates a disconnect from the reader.  11) Do not tell all. It is good at times to be sparing and not reveal too much.  12) Do not construct awkward adverbs. Things like the word tangledly. These are hard to read and disrupt the flow of your writing.  13) Be sure that the reader knows who is speaking. Do not put your phrases \\"he said, she said, or he stated\\" in the wrong places.  14) Do not use million dollar words if a penny word will suffice. If you use big words people will know you can use a dictionary, but then you force your reader to use a dictionary to understand your writing.  15) Be sure that you do not use dialect unless you understand it well. This means do not use ungrammatically correct terms in your writing unless you know how to properly use them.  16) Again be clear and specific. Do not be ambiguous or scattered in your writing.  17) Do not inject your own opinions into your writing. Too many of us tend to give our opinion on the way that things should be viewed. Do not do this in your writing.  18) Use figures of speech sparingly. When you use metaphors make them clear and do not compare a swordfish to an hourglass.  19) Do not take short cuts at the cost of clarity. Shortcuts can be self-defeating in a lot of ways.  20) The use of foreign languages is strongly frowned upon. It does no good, but to show the knowledge of the writer. In other words write in English.  21) Better to write within the standard rules rather than escaping away to natural tongue and speech. Write according to the rules not off beat language.  My Personal Opinion of the book is that it is really helpful in clearly and concisely stating the rules of writing to the reader. He uses a very clear Roman numeral construct that makes it clear in the points that he is trying to make. I really enjoyed reading the book.  I plan to apply as much of the book as possible, but more than anything I would like to apply the comma rules to my writing as I grow in better understanding of them. This was a hard thing for me to grasp, but would like to continue in growth in this area of my writing. I would like to be sure my writing is clear and concise as well. I tend to use a lot of ambiguous statements.  I highly recommend this book to others who struggle with their writing. I feel like it was very helpful in me better understanding the rules of writing.
B00008CMR6|1.0|OK, I didn't know when viewing that the leading ladies were not actresses.  I assumed they were girl friends of somebody putting up the money.  Any high school drama teacher could have done a better job with the actors -- I refuse to believe Hawks was on the set at any time the scenes we saw were shot.
B003L77TZI|5.0|Great, well done fun CD!  I'm not normally a big pop fan, but I love this CD.  If you enjoy a great voice you'll love this.
B005JU5JTI|3.0|If you are a Cameron Diaz fan you will probably like this movie.  I have always been a fan of hers and I laughed out loud at quite a few points.  If you don't like Cameron like most of my fellow reviewers probably don't, then don't see this movie. Jason Segal was also very good in this movie, and Eric Stonestreet from Modern Family also plays a good part.  The reason I only gave it three stars was because of Lucy Punch and Justin Timberlake.  Both of their characters were utterly annoying.  But still, if you are looking for an hour and a half to escape into a mindless movie like me, then this is probably for you.
B004L07KWQ|2.0|I'd have a hard time justifying this as a paid app, even for a buck. What it does is glitchy: try drawing a bunch of circles and watch lag build up until all you get are line segments. Bizarre behavior if you multitap, too. I'm keeping it for the grandbaby, but I'm glad it was free.
B0055OK2T0|2.0|David Norris (Matt Damon) runs for U.S. Senate, loses, but meets a fascinating ballet dancer. But a group of mysterious men using supernatural powers work to keep them apart. It's just too silly and non-sensical to be taken seriously, or viewed.

0446547654|2.0|Seems like the author ran out of ideas - his other novels are much more interesting and much less predicting. I also was surprised by the sudden addition of the violent characters - Nicholas Sparks has always been a safe bet when I need a gripping story without the Hollywood movie requirements - i.e. sex+violence. I think this story lacks in depth and gets very predictable towards the end. By far his weakest work to date.
0307454541|4.0|Now, I'll admit that I hoped on The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo bandwagon when I heard they were finally making an American version of the film.  It took me a good 200 pages in before I actually started to get invested in this book, with all the hype surrounding it as a fast passed, intriguing, mysterious, and all around epic read I really expected it to pick up a little faster than it did.<br /><br />This is one of the only cases where I am glad I was forced to continue reading.  Once you're past the setting of scenes and introducing of characters the story really picks up.  You start to feel for Salander and root for Blomkvist.  Everyone becomes much more personal and the story starts to take shape.  There are still several chapters where Larsson's wordiness seems to take over, and there are lots of details about the economic structure of Sweden which, while somewhat relevant to the plot, don't add much if you're reading this book for the intrigue and aren't too interested in the economic/business aspect.  If I understood or could read even a little Swedish I might try reading this book in its original language to see if that does anything to make the wordiness a little more literary, but since I don't possess those language skills I just have to rely on Keeland's translation and assume it hasn't lost too much in translation.<br /><br />Overall this book really did live up to all the hype, and after finishing this book I had to read the other two immediately afterwards.  Larsson's books really seem to suck away your free time and this one was a very compelling once it got started.  It does take some dedication to that point where you can't put the book down without finishing just one more chapter though (push through, you won't be sorry!).
B005VNOPDO|5.0|Having bought and watched Season One and Two and now watching Season Three, I find Vampire Diaries to be highly original. There seemed to be a lessening of the killing in season two than the first season (a good thing I thought) with greater development of the characters, especially Caroline Forbes (played by Candice Accola). When the human Caroline was on the screen in Season One I wanted to turn off the T.V. she was so anoying, then she freaked out when changed. But now her character has bloomed into my favorite in the series, caring and fun loving she works for goodness and I totally love her! Tyler (played by Michael Tevino) became much more likable in season two, but now that Klaus has made him a hybrid it is hard to know to whom he is loyal or if he will abuse his new powers. I think the one chance he has is if Caroline can keep him from going off the deep end (he is a fool if he doesn't worship and stay with her)! Nina Dobrev is, of course, amazing...how she switches from the good Elena to the evil agenda of Katherine is a tribute to her acting abilities! Elena is showing even greater strength in season three! Elena's younger brother Jeremy Gilbert (Steven McQueen) is a real assest to the plots. IMHO his character exudes kindness yet strength and he clearly loves the young witch, Bonnie Bennet (played by Katerina Graham) who seems to always be the one to \\"save the day\\" with her magic. Alaric Saltzman (played by Matt Davis), gives a solid performance as the teacher and substitute father figure for the Elena and Jeremy Gilbert who tries to keep Elena and Jeremy safe while helping Elena fight for Stefan to break free of Klaus and return to her. Stefan Savatore (played by Paul Wesley) has gone from self-loathing vampire who loves Elena and who doesn't want to be the \\"Ripper\\" he once was, back to a Ripper under the influence (if not the total control) of the evil Klause. Stefan made a \\"deal with the devil\\" (Klause) in order to save his brother Damon Salvatore (IanSomerhauder) who had been \\"nipped\\" by a werewolf (deadly to vampires). Now, in the third season, the plots are thickly inter-woven with new challanges and characters (as well as some supposedly dead characters) entering or re-entering the action. My wife is in LOVE with Damon, who can say more with his eyes than hundreds of spoken words...Ian Somerhaulder is amazing (and I'm glad he isn't killing everyone and everything in sight as he was in season one - it's allowed him to have more depth of character)! This is a great series and my wife and I will continue to watch season three and purchase the DVD's or Blue Ray's when the whole season is avaiable. I'm finishing my book, \\"Immortal Relations\\" to be available through Amazon's \\"Create Space Publishing\\" late December and while completely different, I hope readers find it half as good as Vampire Diaries.
B0050CQY1W|1.0|It amazes me what marketing departments will do to make an extra buck, but sending perfume samples in a CD is a health risk for those of us with chemical sensitivities. I really love Beyonce. I normally consider her a class act, but I can't imagine why she doesn't think she's making enough money and needs to sell herself to the chemical companies. I guess if she wants to smell like a French whore, she'll also sell herself as one, but she's alienating a large percentage of the population who might want to buy her CD. Needless to say, I owned this CD for about 15 minutes, promptly wrapped it in plastic and was forced returned it the next day. As a Beyonce fan, you can't imagine my disappointment and frustration.
0553381695|5.0|Already there are many reviews. I would like to address some of their criticisms...  It seems many are angered by the mass of suffering dished out to the 'good guys', in contrast to how the 'bad guys' thrive. But this is not a story with clear cases of good and evil, the hues blend. still, it would be fair enough to say that, in general terms, the Starks are more sympathetic than the lannisters, but even so, the criticism rings hollow. We are reading a series. And this is but the second book of what may end up as many as eight. No matter what the fairy tale, no 'good guys' will triumph so early into the piece. First they must plunge and plunge deep. it would be a rather dull affair if they didn't. Certainly it could not hope to comment on anything existential or historical in any meaningful way, nor would it be very entertaining. Bran has suffered the loss of his legs, and in this installment he loses Winterfell and many of his people as well. But he has gained the third eye of the Seers. At last he is becoming interesting.   The same is true of Arya. She is developing nicely, and this is only possible through the suffering she encounters. She is a little too 'bulletproof (or swordproof)' perhaps, but she has gone from being a troublesome and awkward child, into a young killer. She is motivated by good, but willing to engage in cruelty. She is becoming interesting. She is becoming a product of the medieval world in which she lives.  And her sister, Sansa too. No character in the book has caused me to groan as much. She is dull. Her chapters only fascinating because they provide a lens through which we can glimpse Joffrey and Cersei. She is intersting only by way of exposition. Yet their is hope. And this is only because of the suffering which constantly besets her. The wool is beginning to tumble from her eyes as she learns that a lady's life is cruel; war is peril, and that knights exist to kill. In fact Martin very expertly is bringing her into focus; preparing her for later on. There is a moment when she sees the Hound in a sympathetic light, the first shift in her consciousness; and then, near the end of the book, there is a moment when the Hound, fleeing battle, enters her room drunk. She is faced with the possibility of cruelty, but this is the only time that i sat up and truly took interest in her story. Was he to rape her, perhaps? As it transpires, little happens, except that Sansa thinks maybe he will kiss her. I am hoping that some kind of twisted romance may develope, once more smudging the lines of what we consider good and evil.   And what of Tyrion, the anti-hero of this particular book? his suffeing, told as back story, is fleshed out, and consequently he becomes the most fully realised of all the POV's. And come the end he is left bed-ridden, missing half a nose, and scarred. Will Shae still love him? Will his whoring and fooling around, his sharp wit, be lost with his pride? It is a quiet cliffhanger, but all the more gripping because of it; it is the suffering, told so expertly and in a neutral voice by Martin, that makes his work so compelling.   Which brings me to the second criticism, namely Daenerys. Sadly she is the flaw of the work. All the sadder since she is most likely the real main character of the book, who will no doubt end up as queen of the seven kingdoms. She is dull. At no point does she feel like a real person, like Sansa, only more so, an object of exposition. After her excellent introduction in a Game of thrones, she now finds herself in something of a no mans land. There is quite literally nothing for her to do. It would be too fast, easy, and impossible for Martin to suddenly grant her the army she is seeking, but yet she must do something, and you can almost feel the author scratching his head trying to flesh something out for her. Part of the problem is that she exists in isolation from the interwoven fabric of the power struggles of Westeros which benifits the other characters and provides them a sense of urgency. Daenerys by contrast languishes. It might have been better if she did not appear in this installment at all, allowing her presence in the first to serve as something of a prologue, so that she might turn up later in the series, ripened, ready to enter the story in earnest. Instead she goes to Quarth and the whole set-up feels rushed and bathetic. Why does everyone show so much interest in her? Ah, because of the dragons. So why then do they not simply try and steal them away from her? And what of the dragons themselves? We have barely any description of them at all. No musings, no introspection; Dany does not contemplate them or their meaning one bit. And then the section concerning the House of the Undying - sure, it's brilliantly written, but their is no deliniation. Why do they try and steal her life-force, and what is life-force anyway? In what way did Pryat Pree try and trick her? It's not adequately explained.   The series also seems to be moving into the more magical terrain, and though i personally don't really wish it to go there, it is fantasy after all, and no one by rights can begrudge Martin the direction of his own story. And it is through Malisandre that these magical elements appear most pronounced. She gives birth to a shadow which slays King Renly, and then shortly after it slays a lesser lord. It is well told, as always, but it does smack of a plot devise, since after being used twice, it is then discarded when it is most needed, for the show down with the Lannisters at the end. It sticks out, I doubt the validity of the plot, a plot which usually feels so utterly real. But the biggest weakness here is not the plot devise, for it can be overlooked, it is how that plot devise relates to Martins concept of religion in general. As great and awsome as the histrionics are, his dealings with religion are crude and scant at best. This is actually a hangover from the Game of thrones - we never learn what the old and new Godsare? How are they concieved? What are their histories? what are the beliefs? And until we know this, how can we fully appreciate the danger or power of this new One God, the Light in which Malisandre has faith? It doesnt give a context for her magic.   But to anyone who is reading negative reviews here, and feels swayed, don't be. The sweep of the story is epic. It's characters beleivable. It's tone and it's concerns adult. It speaks as much for today as it does some imaginary medieval world. And as for the prose themselves, they are neutral yet gripping, controlled and assured. Oh and the scene with Asha is hilarious. But I do think that this story is more conventional than people think - it is just told in unconventional ways.
B005CMSDLE|2.0|Overall the movie is entertaining to watch with some great action scenes. However I did feel that there was some part of the story I was missing. The movie lacked fluidity from chapter to chapter or lacked substance. The main characters of good and evil were not convivincing enough in their roles as ruthless assassins, something was lacking - may be because I have seen them in their alternate roles.
B000X107GI|5.0|I have wrote an earlier review and complained about not receving the batteries.<br />The thing is that the package arrived and mixed in a bunch of<br />other mails. It is my fault and I have wrongly blamed them. I am sorry for this mistake.<br />The  batteries are good. The price is EXTREMELY low--this is another reason that I think the batteries are  not delivered.<br />Five nice CR2032 at the half price for one from Wal-Mart.<br />Too good to be true. So it can not be true.<br />I ordered it only because it is from Amazon.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Stylish, thought-provoking, and the music is perfect. Love this game! Dev put a lot into it, and the price is very little compared to the enjoyment I've already gotten from playing.
B003YL4LYI|1.0|I was very disappointed in this book.  Way too many words and no plot movement at all.  I'm with Lucas in that I don't really care if there's more.  There are getting to be too many characters and nothing happening to the ones I really care about, the Stark's.  Some of the deeeetttail and nuances could be left for a movie or tv.
1400064287|5.0|Made to Stick is a great read!  After reading a few of the pages that were available online, I was hooked.  As a teacher, it gives me ideas on how to teach so that my students remember what is being taught.  I especially liked the chapter on \\"Getting and KEEPING a student's attention.\\"
0316134082|5.0|I originally pre-ordered this on amazon.co.uk as I'm from the UK, but was sent an email telling me that I would not be receiving my product as it was out of stock. I then cancelled my order and ordered it from amazon.com. It arrived so quickly! I was expecting it to take quite a while but it was there within a few weeks. The book is great, it fits perfectly on my shelf with my other Twilight collectors edition books!
B0058VW36U|5.0|Good time waster.  First several boxes aren't very challenging and getting all 3 stars is usually pretty easy.  It starts to get challenging in the 7th box.
B003V1WUKS|1.0|I didn't read the whole book-- only the first story. My God, it is far worse than I could ever have imagined. The first story wasn't a story at all but a poorly recounted anecdote. There's no character development, no tension, no real description.  I perhaps should say, I'm a graduate of an MFA program. I wanted to like this book. However, I see that the reality is, Mr. Franco is simply not ready to be published. That doesn't mean he'll always be a poor writer and story teller, but honestly, this work (what I could read) is so far from completed as to be absurd.  I rather feel sorry for Mr. Franco and whoever told him this work was publishable. it's not. It's bad. It's really bad. It's so bad that I had to stop at times to laugh out loud at the prose and the clunky nature of his writing.  I don't know what to say other than I feel very bad about Mr. Franco putting this out because I can't imagine that anyone would read this stuff and feel anything but embarrassment that someone let him publish this. The emperor is naked and no one bothered to tell him!  Don't buy the book. If you like him as an actor and want to continue to like him, just turn around and walk away. You aren't going to get anything here that will foster good feelings toward him or his work. Go buy something good. Which, honestly would be just about anything.
1845767055|5.0|I rate the item 5 stars because it is.  That's why I wanted to purchase it.  I ordered this book through a second party and the order was cancelled for some reason.  mistake in inventory or I just missed the last book by moments.  It doesn't appear to be in print anymore.  I hope it comes back around or Paul Bonner is working on a new book.
B005D9MUWY|3.0|App its self works well but it keeps trying to update daily,  real hassle. Not sure if the update counts towards the download quota,  makes me wonder if the developer figure away to pad the total download popularity gauge...
B003V5HWWA|5.0|I have no idea why other people are saying it is different than the original. I read the reviews and then just bought it because I don't care about the 2 dollar charge for an instance movie. It is totally the regular movie and everything you have already seen before, nothing unusual. SO WATCH IT!
B000GPIPSS|5.0|Was looking for the original version of Dracula with the ORIGINAL soundtrack, not the redone music from 1999. And disc 1 is the exact version I was looking for! Could not find this anywhere else, even on turner movie classics or AMC's website. Only here! Love the extras and the packaging of this anniversary set just beautifully done! Would highly recommend this set if you are a big fan of the original untouched Dracula...my wife and I enjoyed it very much, as she had been asking me constantly to try to find it online...of course, only on AMAZON do you find everything you want...very happy with amazon's service every time!! If you truly despise the redone overpowering musical soundtrack that seems to be the only one anyone plays on tv now, this is for you!!
B00000I8UK|5.0|I've been listening to this album for over a week now and think it's outstanding. The main thing that stands out here is Eric Dolphy's unique combination of style and instruments-Alto Saxophone, Bass Clarinet & Flute! Vibes play a significant roll as well, played a bit dissonantly giving this album a one of a kind feel to it.  If you're a bit like me and like to search out cool new sounds, I highly recommend giving this disc a spin. I think you will be delighted!  Apparently most if not all of Eric Dolphy's CDs are still in print, so I hope to enjoy more of this great music.  Enjoy & God bless!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I was absolutely in love with this trilogy, and I am already considering re-reading the first book since I loved it so much.  I read all 3 books in about 4 days on my down time.  Normally I read a book a week but I could not put this series down. There is alot of action so I think it is a good series for both male and female readers.  Suzanne Collins makes you feel as though you are in the arena with Katniss, definetly a must read!
193413712X|5.0|The book I requested arrived in three days since I first placed an order and in condition as stated in the description.
0307454541|3.0|The actual story is ok...interesting enough but if you are an avid reader of mysteries or just complicated plots, you will find this book disappointing.  About 1/3 of the book is unnecessary details that do not add to the richness of the story and in fact only succeeds in making it move at an incredibly slow pace.  The main characters are likable enough but you don't really get attached to them.  When you put down the book, you will be content in leaving their stories rather than feel like you have lost a great friend.  If it wasn't for the fact that this was such a popular book, I would have put it down a long time ago but because of the hype I kept reading it hoping it would get better.  In the end, it was ok but I don't feel that I would have lost anything had I chosen to put it down instead and move on to another book.
B0055V6EZE|5.0|I enjoyed the different side of Hugh Laurie..other than 'House'  :-) I love the style of the music...it's nice and easy
B003I55BIA|5.0|I could not put this book down and finished it within a few hours.  Since Alex and Britney come from 2 completly different lifetsyles their relationship is strained.  Britney comes from a wealthy family who has to put on a perfect act for everyone since her older sister is handicapped.  Alex comes from the poor side of town and is involved in a gang to protect his family.  This book is easy to realte to and hard to put down!  I loved this entire series but Perfect Chemistry was by far my favorite of the 3!
B005I64U5C|1.0|Don't be fooled by the almost fraudulent claim of a \\"digital copy\\" included in this package. It doesn't exist. What you get is a streamed version of the movie IF (and only if) you download an App (Flixster) & sign up to TWO different subscriptions (Flixster & Ultraviolet) & even then - according to some reports - it may not work.<br /><br />The movie is brainless fun. The packaging is a crafty con job. I returned the item & paid for my copy through iTunes.
0316134082|5.0|Well it took a while, but I finally have the last book in the collectors set. I am very pleased with these purchases and with amazon. I have bought many things from them and plan to continue purchasing from them for many years to come. The book was like all the others in perfect condition, and one day I hope to pass them on to my niece. Thanks for such great deals and products.
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|This book is amazing!!!!! I am obsessed with Nicholas Sparks books and he definitely delivered in his latest!  It's a combination of the love story from the notebook and the action/drama of safe haven. I absolutely loved it and highly recommend!!!!!!

B0052GACNM|5.0|Excellent album!  Tony Bennett just keeps getting better and better and this album is just as good as Duets I.  Shipping was fast and I would buy from this Seller again!
0439023521|4.0|I have heard so much about this book that I was finally able to read it. Beyond being totally brutal I felt like some chapters I had to hurry up and read just to get through it. I enjoyed the book but there were a lot of slow parts. Reading this book you do start to grow a hate for the \\"Capitol\\". It is unfair how they treat these children and the children literally have no say. Once I started comparing this book to reality and seeing it in a 3-Dimensional state, it really is amazing and sadly true. I guess the reason I didn't like some of the parts is because I didn't want to admit that the world can really be that ugly. Great comparisons in a \\"fictional world\\"! Also a great choice if you liked the Harry Potter or Twilight series and are looking for a new series to read!
B000002IP1|5.0|Dispite the cover this is a great cd  of course with the every popular hits  somthing happened on the way to heaven wish it would rain down  another day in paradise  and another favorite hang in long enough which is good jogging music it makes one want to take on new york.  but the other songs are good to relax to with guest it has a good soho new york vibe to it.  heres to you phil you always knew how to write the right music that makes us all glad to have been around in 89. However it seems as though most of his songs deal with the lost of a woman which is not just this album but some of his others as well. never give up phil
B000FC1AGG|4.0|This was the first time I've read a British novel and I'm embarrassed to say that it sometimes felt like I was reading a foreign language. haha. I was surprised by how many British terms I wasn't familiar with. I really enjoyed this book. It's an entertaining and easy to read piece of chick-lit. I look forward to reading more from Sophie Kinsella.
0321701763|5.0|I am writing a general review for the 4 CS5 books I currently own .  These Books are a fantastic alternative to traditional classroom instruction.  The lesson plans are easy to follow and for the most part very well layed out and take about 2 hours per chapter to complete.   For the beginner they provide a step by step plan building upon the previouse lesson.   I travel constantly and these books make learning on the go great no internet connection required.   For those of you that are self taught or need a refresher course they are a fantastic reference.  For a total learning experience I recommend supplementing these books with Adobe help and Adobe TV   I recommend these tutorials to everyone.
B005C9YZIW|5.0|Is simple: Amazing realize.  The sound in DTS HD is great and the video... only one word: smooth.  The first edition should have been so.
B002JVWRAO|5.0|This movie came three days early :  the box was slightly damaged, but the discs were in great shape. I would recomend this to anybody
0307913090|2.0|I am so disappointed in the audio version of this book. The narrator does a terrible job reading it and its hard to understand him and follow along. He slurs words, speaks real fast in some areas and normal in others. But the worst part is he uses the character voices when he says the 'he said' or 'he said with a shudder' or whatever. So as you listen, its hard to make any sense of it!<br />Very disappointing. Guess ill have to just read it myself.
0156027321|5.0|Picking up this book, I did not know what to expect. I read the first few chapters and didn't really find it appealing. I continued reading, and by the beginning of Part 2, I was hooked. At this point, the story picks up and surprises all when the main theme is completely changed. The main character, Piscine Molitor Patel, (known to all as Pi Patel) Is whisked away from his family and carefree, intelligent life when a ship transporting him sinks, along with the entire crew and family. Pi seeks refuge in a lifeboat, but this part is the strangest: there are more passengers. It is not the fact that other passengers are aboard that is surprising, but the fact that they are wild animals pulls shock. The rest of the story follows Pi's struggles as he attempts to survive being in close quarters with a orangutan, a hyena, and a killer Bengal tiger. Stranded in the sea, Pi is also faced with many other struggles. The main struggle Pi faces is his relationship with God (explained in Part 1). This story reels you in with the kind nature of Part 1 and then hits you hard with Part 2, forcing you to read on. I found this book very entertaining and I now consider this one of my favorite reads. I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys adventure and survival stories, especially the \\"Hatchet\\" series by Gary Paulsen. I would also recommend this to anyone who is studying religion, this story gives different interpretations and ideas to different religions and compares them as Pi is choosing his faith. Great book. Essential read.
B0043GAZYS|5.0|Great, great movie. I love that you get the Blu-ray and DVD together. That way you can use the dvd when watching it with people who don't have a BR player. The extras were pretty cool, and I enjoyed the overall design of the menus.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Graphics are polished and well done. Music is very relaxing. Great puzzle game that is nice to unwind to. One of my favorites.
B0000A98ZP|5.0|The movie \\"The Breakfast Club\\", directed by John Hughes, is arguably one of the best movies of all time. It is a unique film that takes the different \\"typical\\" personalities of teenagers in high school and brings them together for Saturday detention. The different characters include Andrew Clark, the jock; Claire Standish, the most popular girl in school; Brian Johnson, the geek; John Bender, the rebel; and Allison Reynolds, the outcast. With all of them being completely different, they don't agree on much or have much in common. But when you leave a group of people in a room alone from seven in the morning until four in the afternoon, they will eventually talk and discover new things about themselves. The beginning of the movie is mainly the group arguing, until they come to a point where they find things in common. They realize they don't get along with their parents, and they undergo much pressure from their friends.  Although I am a big fan of this movie, some things bothered me. In the end of the movie, the jock ends up with the outcast and the rebel ends up with the popular girl, but where does that leave Brian? There are three guys and two girls so one of them will end up alone, but I think it would have been better if Brian ended up with someone because he is the \\"geek\\" and it is stereotypical that he wouldn't end up with a girl. Another thing that upset me was when they agreed that Monday morning wouldn't be any different than usual. They spend nine hours together bonding, but will pretend they don't know each other at school? It contradicts the point of the movie in my opinion.  I think the best part is when Vernon, the cruel teacher in charge of detention, makes them write an essay describing who they are. After the entire group has been through, they decided to write one essay for them all. The essay is about how they are not who society thinks them to be, which is a great moral in the movie. Again, I think \\"The Breakfast Club\\" is a fantastic movie andpeople will really enjoy it.
B002GTZSZU|5.0|THE STORYLINE IS WELL WRITTEN AND WELL PRESENTED BY ANY SENSE OF THE WORD. VERY ENTERTAINING FILM AND IF YOU ADD A BLU RAY VERSION, IT ADDS TO ALL IT'S SPLENDOR !
B005FUTBWS|4.0|This film is loosely based on the actual true life massacre of 80+ American children and their families on February 28, 1993 who were burned alive in their homes by the ATF and FBI at Waco, Texas.<br /><br />SPOILER ALERT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br />This account introduces a supernatural element (in the original ending) and the movie engages you immediately with a kidnapping and later the subsequent attack by the ATF & FBI with incendiary rounds and automatic weapons fire on American families (including very young children) until all the children were dead after which the entire site was bulldozed to destroy incriminating evidence which could have exposed the ATF & FBI agents for these murders.<br /><br />Well worth watching for the historical perspective of an event that has been wiped clean from the history books. John Goodman stars as the field Agent In Charge and as usual his performance is a pure pleasure to watch. That guy is a real talent.
B0019NG73G|5.0|Everything I hoped for great price . fast delivery , love it. Thought I had it on DVD but did not , I was down at Gettysburg a few weeks ago and now have a better understanding of the battle and layout of the battle field , would suggest to anyone that has an interest in this cicvil war battle to visit and then watch the movie again you get so much more out of it.
B004A8ZWSS|2.0|Wow, slow and disappointing. Lots of eye-candy but that doesn't justify a movie---we want a good story. This comes off as just odd, strange juxtaposition of quiet moments and harried action, soundtrack is meant to be James Bond-like but comes off as a plastic fake. Jolie is starting to look ghoulish instead of elegant, too thin, too bony, too much makeup and long, boring hair. Bedecked in couture, she's almost got the silhouette of a 60 year old Park Avenue widow who eats two bites once a day. Depp looks puffy and old. I long for the days when making a thriller like this seemed easier to achieve, because the backbone of the story was solid. This movie is full of twisting plot turns and can be confusing---all distractions that are meant to hide missing plot holes because the story is so weak. Could have been great if it were done right the first time.
0385302320|5.0|Mrs. Gabaldon does a masterful job of character development. I have fallen in love with Claire and Jamie. This is the third book in the \\"Outlander\\" series and will be enjoyed a lot more if the other two books are read first since parts of the overall story come full circle in this book. Great job of tying the past to the present, as well. Now I have to get the next book and read it so I can see what happens to Jamie and Claire in the New World!
0811869261|4.0|The illustrations are fab, they remind me of those ultra -colorful & -busy Tokidoki patterns and so are visually congested for sure. The story is actually letters from Mouk, the main character, who visits many different places, like Madagascar, greece, japan, india and even NYC, so reading this can be a lot of fun and a culturally enriching experience...it can open up a little dialogue about ethnicities and differences in a friendly way.<br /><br />The book itself is quite large and well-made, with thick, puffy covers and heavy, full-color glossy pages. This book will not fit in most child-sized bookcases.<br /><br />My nearly six y.o. Daughter likes the stickers, which are actually repositionable but they're kind of translucent so you can see through them somewhat, which is kinda strange IMO.
B004XJHBCE|5.0|This app handily  solved my problems with cluttered screens. I can't believe that this functionality isn't included in the base Android.
B005HGZVEM|4.0|i am a big chris isaak  fan since i saw the \\"dancin\\" music video on MTV. i was working at a record store and immediately  opened the \\" silvertone \\" and loved it. the bluesy feel of the song \\"dancin\\" the 60's  girl group in the video all  let me know immediately chris  isaak was gonna be different a good kind of different. his voice,  songs, style all have  that 50's music sound with a fresh approach. it was like he was transported from the 50's. and  his music, look,  style, lyric's all have been his own distinctive sound. i am really tired of artists doing cover albums to me it is  a last effort to do something different when they reach a point in their career when they get stuck. i only hope  this  release is not  part 1 of many to come. when i hear the songs \\"can't help falling with you\\" it is just to close to  elvis  version. that is why the lesser known songs are more enjoyable to me. they are like different chris isaak songs to me.  the lesser known songs work for me the  big hits are just to familiar and sound like the original. i still am a chris  isaak fan but i prefer his original  music
B0018RVJWM|5.0|Life of Pi is the kind of book that many people would look at the first page and put the book down, walk out of the room, and lock the door. These people could not have made a worse decision. For what starts as what seems like a boring and dull book, Life of Pi slowly evolves into an incredible adventure. Once the story picks up its pace, it explores life and death, faith and disbelief, and survival and humanity. Yann Martel captures the struggles and challenges of the young Piscine \\"Pi\\" Molitor Patel in one-hundred gut-wrenching chapters. Each turned page exposes another heart-stopping trial for Pi. Each page brings another cross for him to bear. Each page brings you to a more kindred feeling towards the innocent protagonist. Soon, Martel's main character becomes very real to the reader indeed. Down to the last detail, Yann Martel makes every inch of his character's world jump to life with dazzling reality. All in all, this book is not to be missed.
B004T5K3OK|5.0|one of the most useful apps on my phone. the quality of the scans is excellent, even with an average camera. droid incredible
B004EBUXSA|5.0|Very nice processor, I picked one up awhile back from another store, but it runs everything I do flawlessly.  I only hope Intel gets better ads, the grandma one on here even is very M$ lame.  If these guys would hire me to make an ad for them I could hit ever demographic in under 90 seconds and increase sales guaranteed.
B001CW7ZXA|5.0|I saw this as a young teen at the theatre (the folks had no idea what they were in for) and have yet to see a movie of this genre that sniffs it.  Great cast, script and soundtrack make for a truley hilarious movie (I consequently bought the soundtrack which I still spin to push a party over the top).  The original In-Laws is the only movie since that makes me laugh as much.  This two disc package is especially cool as there is a 45 minute documentary on the making of the film that any enthusiast will find interesting.
B0027BOL4G|5.0|This explains \\"why\\" beef and chicken just don't taste the same anymore...and a great debate for \\"why\\" 10 and 11 year old girls have busts like giant watermelons!!!!!!  Interesting to look at a bag of frozen chicken now, having been informed about what goes on behind the scenes.  I now am being very discerning and prayerfully careful about what I am buying at the market.  Reading lables to see what is in certain foods, etc.  Try to stay clear away from Fast Food too!!!!  Yuk!!!!
B00005QCVT|4.0|I am extremely glad I ordered this movie. I could not find it in stores anywhere, and this was my last option. I like that I paid a cheaper price for it and got good quality. The shipping was great and I recieved it in an exceptable amount of time. Although I am having trouble with the orders I have placed now, but not anything major. Just need them to be here by a certain date and trying to make that happen. Other than that, this order was a great success. Thank you to whomever it concerns.
