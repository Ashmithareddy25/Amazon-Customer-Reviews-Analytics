076790592X|5.0|I happened to start reading this exquisite book on a Tuesday and before the day was out I encountered the following (repeated twice by Morrie and attributed to a wise man identified only as Levine). \\"Love is the only rational act.\\" This quickly propelled me to the following (providing a final touch for a project concerning the permanent incompleteness of all rational knowledge). Only love is complete. Thank you, Morrie.
B000000HRP|5.0|In the mid seventies jazz-fusion was at it's peak and there was no shortage of quality records being released. For me, one of the fusion bands that stood out was Brand X. Their music was captivating, all band members were tremendous talents, but most importantly, they had an original sound. Thirty years after it's release, this debut disc still is amazing and would be a great introduction to this band. John Goodsall shreds with the best of them but his soothing guitar work is just as striking. The chirping tones that Percy Jones creates on his fretless bass are unmistakable. Robin Lumley enhances it all by playing the perfect keyboard riff at the right time, and Phil Collins, on a break from Genesis, laid down some exciting drumming, maybe some of the best he has ever done. Enjoy.
B00003CXC7|5.0|I saw this movie on DVD recently after having not seen in for many years.  Grace Kelley is a beautiful as we all remember her and Jimmy Stewart is as handsome.  I always like the part about \\"Miss Lonely Hearts\\"...somehow that part always \\"gets to me\\".  And, I noticed this time that Mr. Hitchcock appears in one scene in the apartment of the single guy with the piano.  I don't think I noticed that before.  I think everyone should see this movie at least once.  It's not quite as \\"exciting\\" as the loud and noisy \\"Pirates of The Caribbean\\";  but I'd rather watch \\"Rear Window\\" anyday over \\"The Pirates\\"---it's \\"easier on the ears\\"!  And, it has \\"heart\\".  Email:boland7214@aol.
B00005JO5L|5.0|I saw this movie when it originally came out<br /><br />and I was blown away by it.I got sick of waiting<br /><br />for it to come to dvd so I transferred it onto<br /><br />a blank disc just so it wouldn't deteriorate any<br /><br />further.<br /><br />How do I begin to describe this movie.When it<br /><br />first came out it shocked both the gay and<br /><br />straight community.I can understand the shock<br /><br />of the straight community and the anger of the<br /><br />gay community.<br /><br />  It was the 1980's and most gays were in and<br /><br />not out of the closet.They needed positive images<br /><br />of themselves to be projected to the straights.<br /><br />So far there had been The Boys in the Band (1970)<br /><br />and Le Cage Aux Folles ( 1979).So from these two<br /><br />movies,gays were either suicidally unhappy or<br /><br />limp wristed fruity tuities.And then along comes<br /><br />Cruising.To state at the beginning of the movie<br /><br />that it is not representative of the entire gay<br /><br />community was a political move engedered to make<br /><br />the gays less angry about it.It failed miserably.<br /><br /> Here's why.A whack job is knocking off gay men<br /><br />in leather bars.( straights were probably saying<br /><br />so what's wrong with that and what's a leather bar).<br /><br />Al Pacino a straight cop is asked to infiltrate<br /><br />the gay community posing as a gay leather freak.<br /><br />The longer Pacino spends time in this sub culture<br /><br />the stranger he acts with his girlfriend.He also<br /><br />seems to be losing touch with his own reality.<br /><br />The scenes in the leather bar are as scary as hell.<br /><br />Scenes with f*** F****** and every one taking poppers,<br /><br />along with the coloured hankerchief signals is enough<br /><br />to turn most straights into anti-gays if they weren't<br /><br />already.( I must say however that Pacino trying to<br /><br />dance in the leather bar scene is hysterically funny)<br /><br />In the end Pacino really loses it and kills someone.<br /><br /> I guess that's what happens to straights when they<br /><br />try to enter the gay community. ( I'm joking)<br /><br />Why did I like this movie?Because it did give a<br /><br />true portrayal of the leather scene sub culture.<br /><br />It wasn't one of those black water melon movies<br /><br />that make todays black people cringe at.<br /><br />Al Pacino does give a compelling performance of<br /><br />a man who is losing himself in this sub culture<br /><br />life style.<br /><br />Is this movie worth seeing ? DEFINATELY<br /><br />BRING IT OUT ON DVD !!!community.

0060899190|5.0|Dear Frank--you must have the best mail ever.<br /><br />This book is such a simple but brilliant idea.  It would be great as a very hip coffee table book, its not hard to flip through and read the entries, get a discussion started on a post card or two.  Each card is unique and fits what it is saying (or not saying) perfectly.  Makes me want to know these people, and say \\"me too\\" well, to some of the post cards, not all of them.<br /><br />I secretly hope he puts out another book of these, there have to be thousands more postcards that are just as fascinating.
B000EOTTV8|3.0|What therapist would insist that a person going the week before for a sex change must fly across country to bail out a criminal who MIGHT be related.  Bree could have been killed by this strange and messed up boy.

0783233477|5.0|As a child the original \\"Death Takes A Holiday\\" was a midnight favorite.  With that in mind, this film was under close scrutiny. It excelled.  If you have ever been love, truly in love, you will be moved to tears by this film.  It is breathtaking.   <br /> <br />Brad Pitt nailed it and held his own against the great Frederick March.  Anthony Hopkins exceeded his predecessor in capturing what a man who has been in control all is life will do when he loses that control.  Claire Forlani was amazing when Death asks her who he is and she says \\"You're Joe.\\"  The play of emotions on her face is gut wrenching. <br /> <br />The supporting cast is equally skilled and Marcia Gay Harden is a gem in her role as the oldest daughter who runs her social life the way her father runs his corporations, with the same exacting attention to detail. <br /> <br />If you allow yourself to suspend disbelief and remember when you first truly loved and lost, this film will haunt you.
B000F5GNX8|2.0|It is easy to appreciate that Shane Black has made some of the classic action genre movies and was playing off that in KKBB.  However, I found myself pretty much hating the manic tone, the sheer stupidity of the characters, and the constant breaking of the narrative to speak directly at the audience.  One reviewer stated Black threw everything but the kitchen sink in and that hits the mark perfectly.  It was a contrived plot that forced serendipity where it shouldn't occur.  <br /> <br />Val Kilmer's character was under used, forcing the audience to spend far too much time with the least interesting member of the cast.  Some people might like this movie as I can tell from the reviews, but to me, I found myself fast forwarding through sections that were painful to watch.   <br /> <br />Watch LA Confidential, The usual Suspects or Snatch if you want a hard hitting mystery/drama.
B00000K19E|5.0|I love the Matrix.I've watched it plenty of times,the first few to try to understand it's confusing storyline,the next few times for entertainment.The story's about a man,living in celibacy in a world  of computers.One day,he is contacted by Morpheous,a mysterious stranger who tells him he is in danger from renegade programs called Agents.Neo goes to see Morpheous,where he is reborn into the world of the Matrix,a series of green code.He is taken onboard Morpheous' ship,called the Nebechnezzer.The crew of the Nebechanezzer are constantly dodging the deadly Sentinels,spider-like machines that float throughout the never-ending pipelines in which them any ships travel.The crew occasionally jack into the Matrix,to revisit the old world,for where Neo was reborn,it now the year 2199.Soon,Neo and the crew are attacked by the program Agent Smith,played by Hugo Weaving.Morpheous is captured,and Neo must engage Agent Smith in battle.It's definitly a must-see for all ages.
1572814349|3.0|I gave a lot of thought before purchasing this deck. I wouldn't say it's a disappointment, it's just the cards are somehow difficult to shuffle. I am not saying the size (I have the Nigel Jackson tarot which is way bigger than this). The cards simply stick together. But I believe it'd get better later, it's not a big concern. Other than that, I expected the color of the cards would be a little 'brighter'. perhaps it's the paper material that makes it less impressive. In general, it's a great deck and worth the $$.

B00004Z459|1.0|*Puts in -The Jester Race-, computer plays \\"Moonshield\\"*<br /><br />*sighs* \\"Ahhh...this is nice\\"<br /><br />I remember doing the same thing with Linkin Park. Though I never made the mistake of buying any of their records (I was almost going to with this one), I remember the days where I would play one of their songs right on my computer. I would then end up going out with my parents and turning on the radio to either 104.9 or 107.7 (Seattle peeps know what I'm talking about) and I would end up hearing the same, if not another, Linkin Park song. I felt like I was popular and that I was listening to good music.<br /><br />Then In Flames hit me, and I grew into them. I then searched more of them and soon enough Metal began to consume me. I really distanced myself from this and began to despise it with each passing day. Now...now I just pity it. If I remember correctly, the power of the band relied on the vocals, not the guitarists; playing their power chords end on end.<br /><br />There is much more out there in the world than this. People who still like this are still stuck with MTV, there is no denying it.  I mean c'mon, collaborating with that leech Jay-Z was our sign to move on.

B00000JSJC|5.0|This movie was a suprise arrival in late 1995 to theaters, a sci-fi movie that was overlooked by many. Based on New years eve 1999, this movie revolves around the dealings of former LAPD detective Lenny Nero, now a \\"dealer\\" of the next big drug, Mindjacks. These are recording of a persons real Life experiences, captured through a Hair-net like piece of equipment and recorded of Minidisc. These can be played back on a player for anybody to see using their own device. The best part is, you feel like you are really their in the event, just like living it as it happened, every gust of wind, every drop of rain etc.  The part thats appealing is that it give people the chance to indulge in \\"the darker side of Life\\", whether it be risktaking like robbing a store or fighting, to pornography, and its just like being their without leaving your chair. Lenny Himself is addicted to the disc he had captured while with his former girlfriend Faith. In the days before the New year, Lenny finds himself wrapped up in a conspiricy involving \\"blackjack\\", Discs of Memories that are captured of true crimes, not just staged, It starts with an encounter with one of Faith's old aquantences, who is brutally murdered (again captured on disc for Lenny to view), and ends with one of which is of the execution of a prominent Rap artist Jerico one.  Tranking the trail of this person Making \\"Blackjack\\" prove to be difficult and Dangerous for Lenny, having him cross paths many times with his old flame Faith and her corrupt new boyfriend, philo gant.  Gant repeatedly has Lenny beat for his interactions with Faith.  Gant is a controll freak, and a cronic user of \\"jack\\" himself. With the help of an old friend, \\"mace\\" Mason, Lenny bust apart a plot that takes him within inches of his life. Along the way will Lenny learn from mistakes of the past, or will he change with the new Mellinium?  Find out, a great movie to watch. Again, one draw back it the fact it was set in 1999, and was a film that came out in1995. Now that we have lived through Y2K, it doesn't seem like a huge deal, but I just kept in mind what the fears and issues of 1995 were (still fresh from Rodney King and O.J. Simpson, and Fearful of Y2K computer glitches), and realize that they were very appropriate for the time.  At least it is not just another \\"big brother is watching\\" movie.  Give it a try, I think it will suprise you.
0790731479|2.0|I really hopes that Beetlejuice would appear again. At least on DVD. Because this is a very poor edition with no extras at all. Just the plain old transfer with no remastered sound or nothing new. The only good extra features in this disc are the spanish and french tracks that doesn't mean that there no spanish and french subtitles also. As with any Tim Burton title, I wish a special edition would come up with all the backstage and in the making footage that make us understand the dificulties of doing a complex (and simple) movie like Beetlejuice.
0307263118|4.0|Initially, I almost didn't read this book on account of several reviews that say its vocabulary is too difficult and pompous, or that its sentences are too long. I approached the book with reservation and wondered if I'd even want to finish it. By page 2, I relaxed and started to enjoy it once I understand that the narrator was someone who speaks in an antiquated and embellished manner.  <br /> <br />Unfamiliar words make a book interesting, not difficult, so long as a dictionary is accessible. (Salmon Rushdie's \\"Shalimar\\" has 14 words I didn't know, not counting a plethora of Hindu and Muslim terms.  \\"The Sea\\" has about 35-50: this being a library loan, I couldn't jot them down in the front to check later. By the end, I'd missed 15 entirely, but that didn't ruin the story because fairly often their meaning can be deduced as much as is needed from surrounding text.)   <br /> <br />As for long sentences, Banville's aren't that long and they don't change focus midway as some writers' frustratingly do. The prose never drones. A maintained rhythm, infrequent dialogue and the absence of place names make this book fast to read.  <br /> <br />The vocabulary is grandiose because the narrator, Max Morden, is conceited and egotistical.  As for the criticism that no plot and no suspense add up to no story, that there's no point to Max's thoughts, this is an internal story - an examination of past events, perceptions, and responses rather than a tale of impending experience or action. Max makes clear early on that all he wants is to escape bereavement of his recently deceased wife and to find a place that's \\"concealed, protected and guarded\\". He's still bothered by a traumatic event of his youth while he contemplates the state of his disappeared marriage. This story is well-done and subtle. <br /> <br />Sparse action provides an ideal canvas for Banville to showcase his pungent and unconventional prose and the power of language to enthrall us when it's lent to a master. Thankfully, prose and fiction are not bound by the `plot/action/ big ending\\" formula of televised and filmed dramas (so that they might be remembered after just an hour or two). Banville distils and releases the intangible, the invisible, the things that occupy the moments between activity.       <br /> <br />Especially impressive is the imagery he creates by applying verbs to unexpected phenomena, by rendering physical those things without substance or outline, and by breathing life into the inanimate. To paraphrase a sampling of these: a breeze smacks down on the beach, swarms it slantwise and then chops the water's surface into metallic shards (p.28). Waves monotonously, repeatedly collapse. Days are hung with big-bellied clouds (p.108). An old suit that's too tight under the arms has pockets bulging with memories (p.116).  <br /> <br />At a time when fiction seems to be focusing on colloquial dialogue, it's refreshing to be mesmerized by the descriptive  reach and possibilities of language itself.   <br />
0872863107|4.0|I am not exactly sure of the general influence that Allen Ginsberg's classic anthem of the 'beat' generation had on my generation, the children of the 1960's because most people I knew then, including myself, had only read the liberation poem long after seeking an alternative lifestyle or becoming radicalized (not necesarily the same thing). However, no matter what its immediate influence on my generation it nevertheless spoke to me more than any other modern poem since reading T.S. Eliot's The Wasteland back in high school.     In retrospect I would pay a very high price to have been able to be there in San Franscisco in that garage in 1956 sipping a little wine and listening to the great yawlp. And Howl is very definitely a poem to be listened to and only read later to try to figure out what all the symbols mean. Walt Whitman finally had company as Ginsberg spoke in one song the anguish that his generation was feeling about the turn industrial society had taken.     On a recent re-reading I found it rather funny that the scandal that surrounded publication was such a big deal with most of the language and references to sex, including homosexual sex now rather commonplace and unremarkably.  Finally, does anybody feel as I do that if one did not know that the poem was written over 50 years ago that that it could have been written about today's technologicaly-driven society. Timeless, in short just like Whitman.
B000GDH9RI|5.0|I bought the NTSC/All Region version off another website (for only $25.00 including shipping!) and it plays fine on all my DVD players, except my older model. The show is great and everyone is in top form. The picture and sound quality blows away the From Wishes to Eternity DVD by far. Too bad this was the final show with Tarja, but I have a feeling that they will get back together after a little time apart.
B000089RV6|5.0|...about this album that every other reviewer hasn't already said? Probably very little other than this album epitomizes everything I know to be 'Hard Rock'---- crunching guitars, driving bass and drums and \\"over the top\\" vocals (often resonating with lewdness). Now, what I CAN say (if anybody gives a hoot) is what this great album means to me personally. \\"Back in Black\\" is directly linked with many \\"firsts\\" in my life. My first encounter with Mr. Jack Daniels was accompanied by this album blaring from a set of speakers-----I recieved my first \\"real\\" butt-kicking (courtesy of said Mr. Daniels...lots of adolecsent Testosterone...and the local civic center parking lot after an extra rowdy concert from the band). Heck, this was probably the background music during my first female \\"encounter\\" as well. I'm guessing some of the above mentioned experiences probably \\"ring true\\" with many males out there that spent teenage years \\"rocking-out\\" to \\"Back in Black\\"----and to this day it remains a powerful testament of \\"No holds barred\\" R-n-R. I rarely write reviews to analise or discuss individual songs, so I'll simply say I don't associate song terms such as 'weak' and 'filler' with this great album. It ends the same way it begins and it's ALL ROCK BABY!!!....truly one of the most raw, energetic statements of 'Good-Ol' Rock-n-Roll ever recorded. On top of that, its one of only a few cases where a basically unknown vocalist (Brian Johnson) has stepped-in to \\"fill the shoes\\" of a much beloved original singer (Bon Scott), and made it work in a BIG WAY. I really feel fortunate to have grown up listening to what is now considered a 'Classic' album (despite what other reviewers have said). The few times I listen to this album anymore,(Hey...I'm pushing 40!) it still conjures up those 'Milestone' moments in my life and still leaves me smiling when its all said and done. However, I do find myself wondering whats out there right now for today's youths to \\"latch\\" onto that has the POWERof an album like this...is there an artist or band out there producing music of this caliber? I don't know...but what I have come to the conclusion of, is that they don't make em' like this anymore. A DEFINITE MUST BUY!!!
B0006ZE7G2|4.0|Excellent DVD, I watched it with my wife and my kids  25 and 15.  <br />This music spans through the generations.
B00004Y6O7|5.0|Yes...mighty is as fitting a word to describe this band as any word found in Webster's. Just when the 'listening public' was starting to give up hope of finding a group that could \\"dish-out\\" some serious Rock (ala, Led Zeppelin, The WHO, Etc...), along comes Van Halen with their 1978' self-titled debut that shattered any myths that 'good time' Rock-n-Roll was a dying breed. All of a sudden, the 'Hard Rock' bands that I grew up loving such as KISS and Aerosmith, took a 'backseat' to this new \\"entity\\". As a quick sidenote, 'Hard Rock' is something of a 'tricky' musical genre to define....personally, I can think of only a handful of groups that I would label as such----AC/DC, Aerosmith, KISS, The Cult and of course, Van Halen. Of course bands such as Kansas, Boston, Et Al. could certainly qualify as 'Hard Rock' as well, however, I group those bands in other catergories. Likewise, I would classify groups like Motley Crue, Def Leppard and many of the \\"Hair bands\\" as 'Hard Rock'....But I'm here to talk 'Classic Hard Rock'...and it doesn't get any better than \\"Fair Warning\\"! Please....name a song that pulverizes the \\"rock senses\\" like \\"Unchained\\" or \\"Mean Street\\"...I'm waiting! These guys had every ingredient of a great Rock group---- talented individual musicians; driving, though catchy rhythms and lyrics;  a 'Front Man' that was nothing short of Unstoppable; and a stage prescence and show that was something not to be forgotten (remember the city back drop lined with Marshall stacks in the \\"Unchained\\" and \\"So This is Love\\" videos....impressive to say the least). As for talent, each one of the guys \\"had it going on\\". Besides the obvious innovations of Eddie and David (which have been much praised in most other reviews), one must NOT dismiss Alex and Michael's contributions to the band's sound. Being a drummer myself, I can say that Alex was \\"instrumental\\" to my own personal development as a drummer----his convincing double-bass beats, his left-foot 8th note Hi Hat accompaniment, his \\"choking\\" and \\"riding\\" of crash cymbals, and the overall 'bombast' of his playing style (not to mention the sheer massiveness of his kits). And Michael...besides contributing some of the higher register back-up vocals in Rock's history, he added a 'pounding' low end that was the foundation needed for all involved---- one of the thickest, rumbling bass sounds heard since Squire and Entwhistle. As much as I would rather not use a certain phrase to describe what this album means to me, I feel its more than fitting----this is definitely one of the \\"Soundtracks to my Life\\". It brings me back to a specific time in my exsistance that I wouldn't trade for the World...and leaves me 'snickering' to myself every time I hear it. These said \\"Soundtracks\\" are albums that are very \\"near and dear\\" to me, and seems to never grow old to me. They are also albums,that 9 times out of 10, I will happily listen to from start to finish----Me skip a song on \\"fair Warning\\"....NO WAY! \\"FW\\" will always rank right at the top of my VH collection, though ALL releases from the Roth-era VH belong in any Rock Fan's collection. Enjoy this one with your \\"buddies\\", the Ladies, and of course, your favorite drink!
B00008PX8P|5.0|This DVD captures raw Led Zeppelin at its best. Never having the opportunity to see Led Zeppelin live, this DVD put me right there. I was completely mesmerized. I have a whole new appreciation for the talent of Led Zeppelin. This DVD is a valued addition to any Zeppelin collection.

B000GTLQXU|3.0|Petersen's remake of Ronald Neame's classic is a good attempt to bring the story to the new generation. Too bad the new generation won't sit still for a gradual buildup of suspense, and deeper characters. Petersen has said, of the 1972 classic, \\"It's charming to see that film, today. It's delightfully old fashioned.\\" I wonder if anyone will remember this version, thirty years hence, but this time around, there is suspense and spectacle. The problem is, once the ship turns over, the sets, though impressive, don't really look upside down (something Neame went to great lengths to showcase in the original). Josh Lucas had some unkind things to say about the characters and script of the 1972 version, but his statements would have carried more weight if this film had improved upon them. The capsizing is fine, but like many modern spectacles, is edited for confusion rather than clarity: somehow the shots don't \\"read\\" as cleanly as the similar shots from Neame's version. Purists will miss Manny, Belle, Nonnie, and especially Stella Stevens' Linda Rogo, and I'd advise them to go into this without the expectation that it will remind them of the first version. I suspect this film was at least a half hour longer before some studio boss decided to cut it down. A longer version on DVD would be welcome, because it would offer more of what many people felt was missing: suspense, story, and character development. Completists should want to own this, and it's worth viewing once.
B00008XEP5|5.0|It seems that several people on here chose to use the review of a Diamond Head album to rip on Metallica, and although they were very influenced by this spectacular band they are a different band of a different movement from a different continent that began release 4 years after was released. On to Diamond Head.  <br />Track One, Lightning to the Nations, is a NWOBHM classic, as is the rest of this album, but this first track was the all important first step to making the original vinyl copy of the LP so sought after in heavy metal circles. The song sets forward a \\"mission statement\\" of sorts and all the subsequent songs build off of that song as a base. Classic Song on a classic album <br />Track Two, The Prince, had the luck of being covered by the metal juggernaut that was once Metallica, so the song is better known than some of the others. A solid song, the riff that comes in after a great intro is one that all heavy metal fans should be aware of. <br />Track Three, Sucking My Love, is a fantastic song, musically the song just melds together into yet another spectacular song. Thus far on the album the boys are three for three for wonderful songs. <br />Track 4, the ever present Am I Evil?, this song is beyond words to describe, it's the center piece of the album in my mind. Metallica obviously embraced it as well as it is one of their most famous B-Sides (check with your parents kiddies) that the Bay Area folks ever recorded. The song is impossibly good and the album can revel in that fact. Most people will buy this album because of that song, whether or not they realize it. <br />Track 5, Sweet and Innocent, although not one of my favorites off of this album it is a solid tune none the less. The intro riff is still echoed in music today and the fast pace keeps this song afloat. <br />Track 6, It's Electric, is a classic. Its about rock and roll and making it in the biz. Metallica covered this fellow for its 1998 release Garage Inc. and it is track two on Disc One of that album. The only real thing that can people can honestly complain about with this album is poor production, and this song is a casualty of that. Irregardless the song is a classic. <br />Track 7, Helpless, is yet another song covered by Metallica and is once again an undeniable classic. It's a spectacular song and everyone that buy this album should be enjoying this song as an album closer. This concludes my review of the original LP. Whether or not this review helps you is not too important, the buyer should just be positive that if they buy this that they will not be let down. Millions of metal fans worldwide love this relativly \\"underground\\", at least \\"underground\\" here in the USA, NWOBHM band as they are still talked about in a sort of an awed sort amazement. They should have been the next Led Zep but were stifled by the record companies on the later releases, as were many of the other NWOBHM bands that weren't Iron Maiden, Def Leppard, or Saxon (they stifled themselves until bursting back with Unleash the Beast. Take a listen to that too). Know that this is a marvelous album and invest in this band.
B000F7CMRM|4.0|Following in the footsteps of The Constant Gardener and the Lord of War, the film sheds light (as it should do) on the reality of major oil companies' dirty dealings in the Middle East, Central Asia, and around the world, with the support of various governments... More importantly it does a good job of showing who is, more often than not, behind the various plots, schemes, and wars, not to mention how corrupt the world has become, and how successions often occur in various parts around the world.  The quote: \\"Corruption is why we win,\\"says it all. <br />Syriana brings to the screen a set of parallel stories (four to be exact) that take place, involving an unlikely group of people who are linked to each other in various ways. <br />To a certain extent, the setup is rather similar to the movie Crash. <br />George Clooney, Alexander Siddig (from Star Trek DS9!), Matt Damon, and the rest of the cast carry out their performances very well. <br />The major setbacks are in relation to:   <br />1) The annoyingly politically correct Woodman family, especially the wife! <br />2) The Committee for the Liberation of Iran is not necessarily a bad thing. <br />In a nutshell, it's probably not a movie you would want to add to your collection, but it will provide for an evening's entertainment.  3.5 Stars <br />

B00006CXSS|5.0|Tom Hanks and Steven Spielberg have honored the Greatest Generation as it deserves with this superb based-on-a-true-story film version of Easy Company's long march through various kinds of warfare from D-Day through the fall of the Third Reich.<br /><br />Others have written extensively about its dramatic and cinemagraphic achievements. Let me add a word about its value as a lens on the phenomenon of leadership under profound stress. The men of Easy Company surprised themselves with what the had in them. This is one of the enduring lessons of battle.<br /><br />However, Easy Company was better than it would have been because it was led by a man of integrity, honesty, humility, self-abnegation, and truthfulness. He was not a man of many words and he occasionally led the charge because it would have been more awful to send someone else first.<br /><br />I often sell dvds after viewing them. However, this collection of HBO's ten Band of Brothers episodes will go to my children when I'm gone as a family treasure.
B00005ATQF|5.0|Stanley Kubrick has made eight film's, \\"Full Metal Jacket\\" was his second to last film, made in 1987. Personally I find all eight of those films good even though \\"Lolita\\" and \\"Eye's Wide Shut\\" dont have half of the goods of the other six. Five of his eight films are all about the same, they are all near perfection. Those include \\"A Clockwork Orange\\", \\"The Shining\\", 2001: A Space Odyssey\\", \\"Dr. Strangelove\\" and the one at hand \\"Full Metal Jacket\\". I think that all eight of his films are worth seeing but those five you simply cant die until you see.<br /><br />This may seem a bit weird but I found \\"Full Metal Jacket\\" to be just as scary as Kubrick's \\"The Shining\\". Even though there is really only one scene in \\"Full Metal Jacket\\" that can be considered scary, the transformation of the \\"...unfortunate\\" man into what he becomes is frightening as well. The thing that I really loved about this movie is that it feels like you watch two short films in one movie. Not only do you watch Joker, Leonard, Sargent Hartman & the other men go threw Boot Camp but you also get to watch as Joker enter's the actual war (Veitnam). You continuously see the effects that the war has on the people fighting as well as an ending that keeps you fully involved to say the least.<br /><br />Stanley Kubrick's Directoral habits (I use habit's in a good way...) and tendencys are fully apparent. The screenplay is flawless. The acting is all around great. The Visuals are unforgetable. The film has a deep impact that you will never forget. \\"Full Metal Jacket\\" is an absolute spectacular display of film-making at it's finest!<br /><br />Grade: A
B0001MDQ2G|5.0|Raging black/death metal, melodic passages filled with acoustic guitars and piano, female vocals, chanting choirs, exotic instruments/percussion, cool lyrics in multiple languages, and overal jaw-dropping compositions all make \\"Mabool\\" one of the best metal albums of recent times and beyond.  And to think, it's only a debut!  These boys from the Middle East have a promising future indeed.  For any fan of metal that goes above and beyond, this album is an absolute must.  I am certain that \\"Sahara\\" will be incredible as well.
B000E1ZBGS|2.0|There is no denying that turning a book as rich in characterisation and plot as \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" into a film is a dicey proposition. It's no potboiler with forgettable dialogue. Its characters are not two-dimensional. The story threads interweave and there is delicious wit and rather wicked social commentary from the pen of Jane Austen. How can a film adaptation hope to capture all of that?<br /><br />Of course, it cannot.<br /><br />But need a film adaptation transgress as heinously and thoroughly as this one does against the intentions of the author?<br /><br />There were some inexplicable blunders that don't make sense at all: Darcy actually CAME INTO ELIZABETH BENNET'S BEDROOM to give her the letter he wrote (inexcusable blunder - this is simply inconceivable); the Bennet dining room had servants serving the food in far too small a room (English country houses do not have dining rooms of such miniature dimensions, and certainly a normal meal rather than a grand occasion for a family of the straitened circumstances the film attempts to portray would not include servants standing at the ready to serve. It seems as though the director has melded the serving practises of larger country houses with the idea of a poorer yet still genteel family, but that is entirely historically inaccurate); Darcy was wandering about with his shirt undone and no cravat (as sexy-looking as that is, it's so inauthentic as to constitute an unforgivable faux pas); the ball held by Bingley had far too many people to constitute a country ball held to get to know his neighbours (again, it seems the director is going by vaguely and inaccurately held ideas of English country habits - could some real research not have been done?); the entire embarrassing and ridiculous scene with Elizabeth Bennet lasciviously viewing and caressing naked statues could only strike a 20th or 21st century American audience as appropriate; and Darcy proposing in the rain... (as anachronistic as a watch on the wrist of Michelangel's David); and an utterly bewildering moment occurs when Lady Catherine de Bourgh arrives at the Bennet's house in the middle of the night. Unless she came with urgent news, she would have been neither heard nor admitted at such an hour, nor would a gentleman have dreamed of appearing in front of a lady in his nightclothes. Those are only some of the ill-conceived and inappropriate moments.<br /><br />Let us pass over the strange family dynamics - clearly neither the director nor the actors bothered to read the novel in order to discover the complex relationships involved. For one thing, Mr and Mrs Bennet's marital relationship was clearly written by Jane Austen to be the worst mismatch in history; Mr Bennet is intended to be so disgusted and bored by most of his family (wife and daughters, except for Elizabeth and Jane) that he can find refuge only in perceiving them as amusing, and hiding in his study to avoid having to deal with them.<br /><br />Let us pass then to the casting. Keira Knightley is a lovely-looking young actress, but the character of Elizabeth Bennet is beyond her. She does not have the complexity to understand such a character, and her acting skills are not at present sufficient to convey the depth of such a richly drawn character. However, for the purpose of this film, the characters are completely altered anyway. In terms, then, of this film, within its confines (and not in respect of Jane Austen's Elizabeth Bennet), Ms Knightley was perfectly adequate, although she looked odd at times. Partly this is because her thinness was highlighted rather than flattered, and partly it's because her hair was so very strangely arranged. I could not understand the \\"washerwoman\\" hairdo, I confess - it is historically inappropriate for the period. If the purpose was to make Elizabeth Bennet look less beautiful than Jane Bennet, a very strange idea has occurred. Elizabeth is certainly not plain in the novel. She has a loveliness that is characterised more by her liveliness than feature-by-feature, but she is considered by all who know her to be one of the prettiest girls in the county. Jane is considered by the regularity of her features to be the most beautiful, but the whole Bennet family is known for their beauty (save for Mary). How has this been translated to mean that Elizabeth is not lovely-looking? Why the insistence in this film on downplaying Keira Knightley's looks? Simply because Mr Darcy does not instantly find Elizabeth Bennet beautiful...? And because Miss Caroline Bingley and her sister will not do justice to her looks? The difference between Elizabeth and Jane is one of kind, not of quantity. Both the director and some of the viewers seem not to have realised that.<br /><br />The Darcy looked beautiful, and it's not really the actor's fault that he was not conveying Jane Austen's Darcy. Again, really I blame the scriptwriter who did such an appalling hatchet job, and the director who seems to have thought of this film in terms of making the cinematography look beautiful but eschewed any care with regard to historical detail or the requirements of the story itself.<br /><br />The dialogue flip-flops from modern \\"I'm writing an historical novel\\" style to authentic Jane Austen - and the difference between the two styles is embarrassing. Unless a scriptwriter is prepared to enmesh him/herself into the writing style of the period, complete with an understanding of the grammar of the English language as spoken at the time, and specifically the style employed by Jane Austen, such an obvious clash is bound to occur. And furthermore, a modern idea of dialogue can only create further flaws in the style of the dialogue. It simply doesn't work unless the scriptwriter is prepared to let go of a 21st century idea of how the characters OUGHT to be. If he/she isn't prepared to do that, the scriptwriter had better stick to modern dramas.<br /><br />What a pity that the scriptwriter felt it necessary to make Darcy \\"misunderstood\\" rather than truly \\"proud\\". This reduces the title of the book (and thus the title of the film) to meaningless drivel. In the novel, Darcy really WAS a proud man - he acknowledges it, and through his love for Elizabeth and the travails in their relationship, he found within himself a more proper understanding of how he could maintain his sense of self yet become more approachable. Elizabeth, too, acknowleged in the novel that her prejudices led her astray, and she, through knowing Darcy and through the troubles of her own family, comes to learn herself more thoroughly. \\"Until this moment I never knew myself\\", she says - but she does not say it in the film. Indeed, she could not - for in the film, she too is just \\"misunderstood\\". The characters do not grow and develop in this film - because, like a Mills & Boon romance novel, they don't need to. The characters are two-dimensional - but most viewers don't seem to notice that.<br /><br />To compare this film to the splendid 6-part adaptation with Jennifer Ehle and Colin Firth is to compare a somewhat battered meringue with a superb full-sized gateau. The BBC series had everything right; this film sadly does not.<br /><br />I suppose the main flaw of this film was its obviousness. Moments such as \\"sexy open-shirted man strides through the mist, his cloak flapping in the wind behind him\\" abound. Oh dear. Very, very Mills-and-Boonish. The lack of subtlety is everywhere... and the same holds true for the character dynamics. Instead of the subtle 18th century character interplay, the audience is served with lashings of modernised ideas of love sans any of the biting social judgements that add spice to Jane Austen's excellent writing.<br /><br />By the end of this film (indeed, fifteen minutes into the film), I no longer cared whether Darcy and Elizabeth ever married. I could not consider them real. They had no claim upon my sympathy. What a contrast to my emotional involvement in the BBC series!<br/><br />I recommend this only for viewers who enjoy soap operas, or for people who don't care about historical accuracy or subtle performances.

B000FGGE68|1.0|Now before we get into this I want you guys to know one thing: This movie is bad. I mean really bad. Catwoman bad. Its so bad that it's acutally funny! When I saw this movie with my friends we stopped trying to take the movie seriously after the \\"Pin-ball Ninja's\\" in the very begining. Afterwards it became the funniest thing I've scene in a long time. I'll never forget the Final Bad-guy's line right before they fought: \\"You got your blood on me. It's on!\\" That's right folks this guy said \\"It's on\\" in a movie trying to be serious. It doesnt help his case that he has nose plugs on the entire movie. The only thing I can saw was good about this movie was the special effects, nothing more. 1 star for good effects. Rent it and watch it with your friends if you want a good laugh.

B0000A118M|5.0|Clearly influenced by his years free from heroin and alcohol, and his subsequent spiritual odysseys into Islam and other eastern orthodoxies, and his theretofore newfound sense of freedom to make music according to his own inspiration, A Love Supreme is unquestionably Trane's cleanest and most spiritual music. \\"Allah Supreme....Allah Supreme.\\" Is that a refrain in A love Supreme? Well, that's a question for the ages, but it sure sounds right and I wouldn't bet against it. This is the Album....this is Trane! This album has long reigned as the supreme work in its genre.    It's difficult to discuss Trane and only discuss Trane.  It's impossible to fine-tune the late saxophone prophet with a review of one album--and I'm not saying that can--but if I were to attempt such a thing, this would be the album. Trane was a ubiquitous musical innovator, and only God knows where he was going with his music. No one could fathom the depths of Trane's creative emotions, he all but yearned to make the meek strong, cure the leper, make the lame walk, and turn water into wine (no pun intended), by simply manipulating breath through a reed instrument. Did he work all those miracles? We could argue. Now I'm not implying that the man was Moses, but he did things with his ax that no one had ever done before. Trane parted the red sea of the jazz world and came through with a new sound and many followers. His music was at once, his crusade and miracle, and his saxophone was his staff.    Now some would argue (perhaps very successfully) that Trane's best jazz plays from a much darker period in his life, when he and others on the jazz set were perpetually inebriated or stoned beyond cognition on and off the set; nevertheless, I'll accept all takers in saying that this work represents the best of the person we know as John Coltrane, and is perhaps his best music, if it's not his best jazz.     The great John Coltrane is one of the most important and influential jazz musicians of all time, andone of the greatest musical masters of the twentieth century. When I listen to John Coltrane, honestly; I don't hear a soprano saxophone--I hear John Coltrane. And that's exactly what he intended. A sound Supreme.    Now have I shaped a halo above Trane or this album? Both.
B000FQJAIW|1.0|A long time ago, in an era far far away, a young, relatively unexperienced director had a vision. In his mind he saw spaceships, an unknown galaxy and broad characters. He wanted to make this vision come true, so he summoned a group of brilliant craftsmen, artists and actors. The rest is history. <br /> <br />Basically, there are two issues with this \\"new\\" DVD Set that have to be talked about. First, the lacking respect for what has to be the most influential film of the past 50 years, and secondly the purely commercially- driven release- mania of George Lucas. <br /> <br />I completely agree with an earlier reviewer who wrote that without his excellent matte artists, model makers, sound designers, helping writers and so on, George Lucas would have had nothing, and we would probably don't have many other now classic films. <br />Without his team, Lucas would still be a 2nd grade director, running around sets yelling only \\"faster\\" or \\"more intense\\". Granted, he had the vision, but others made it a reality. Face it, Star Wars wasn't carried by dialogue or story. It was the extraordinary environment, the characters, the actors and the music. <br />The proof of that is the prequel trilogy. There, George Lucas did have complete control over everything, and he just couldn't handle it, he was not even close. <br /> <br />But his incredible heritage remains. And he just owes it to those brilliant people, who made Star Wars what it became, to cherish these original films and preserve them for future generations because they were indeed the fundament for today's movie industry. <br />That Lucas treats these originals like crap is just arrogance and lacking respect for fans. It's that simple because there's absolutely no sane reason to do what he does. <br /> <br />And what is George Lucas' opinion? \\"I'm sorry you fell in love with an unfinished film.\\" <br />Consequently, he \\"fixed\\" the original trilogy by adding in all kinds of modern CGI things. But there's a fundamental mistake in his way of thinking. He thinks the effects are imperfect, so the whole film is. He says these movies are imperfect, but all he does is replace the effects. What George Lucas really doesn't get is this: the films WERE perfect because effects, actors and story (although very melodramatic) formed a unity. And the effects WERE perfect for 1977 stadards. Even more than that. <br />And Star Wars IS a 1977 film and NOT a 2004 movie. <br /> <br />Now, it would be perfectly fine to release these revised editions *once*. <br />But how many times did these things come out already? And every time with a new \\"feature\\", but the movies stay the same. And you don't know whether to buy it or not because you don't know whether the latest version will be the last. And don't tell me Lucasfilm doesn't know this, they are fully aware of it. <br />But you know what? The line has finally been crossed. I think not even the most fierce Star Wars fan will ever buy a DVD again without severe doubts.  <br /> <br />Many fans defend this shameless charade by saying that other blockbusters also have different DVD Editions.  <br />Of course they do, but isn't the difference flamingly obvious? When, for instance, Spider- Man, Batman, Chronicles Of Narnia, King Kong or Lord of the Rings are being released as DVDs, these individual DVD Editions are relased either *simultaneously* or the customer is fully aware that a Special Edition will follow soon. People can CHOOSE which one to buy. With those never- ending re- releases of the SAME films, you can never choose between buying or not because you never know whether a Special Special Special Edition with \\"all- new features\\" is already planned. <br /> <br />Often I read reviews that moan: if you don't like it, then don't buy it and stop complaining! Yes, well, we are not complaining about people actually buying this rehash, we condemn the product itself and the motivations behind it. <br /> <br />Don't let Lucas fool you! Next year we can celebrate the 30th anniversary of \\"Star Wars\\", and no one can honestly believe Lucas doesn't have concrete plans. <br />Another reviewer said it best: by releasing such a DVD set and by his behaviour, George Lucas spits in the face of movie history and everyone who learned to love it. <br />
B00006EXL5|4.0|I was introduced to MCR through Three cheers for sweet revenge, which is one of the best albums to ever be released. I brought you my bullets, you brought me your love is a very, very good release. All the songs are awesome, and the intensity and ferocity that drew me MCR in the first place is well in place on this album. But, it seems that they were still finding their sound and direction on this album. Very good album, but the recording is very raw, semi-okay production. But nevertheless a great release that you must check out...My favorite song is Drowning lessons.

Disc 2: Everything    If youre a fan of Metallica you need to go buy this now, highly recommended!
B000FFJ85I|4.0|I confess, prior to this album, I had barely heard of AFI.  Further, if not for the dramatic video to Miss Murder, I would never have been interested in the band or this album.  I have heard long time fans deride the song as a \\"sellout\\", but I disagree.  I can't begrudge the band for wanting to have a hit record, and Miss Murder and this album certainly deserve to be that.<br /><br />Although shelved in the \\"punk\\" bin of record stores, AFI is really a fantastic alternative rock band, and this album would be a crowning achievement for any group.  The songs are subtle, atmospheric, and draw you in more and more with repeated listenings.  Now, for some, that might be code for \\"boring, slow stuff\\", but that's not the case.  There are slower songs on this album, to be sure, but there are songs that rock as well.<br /><br />Above all else, it is obvious that the band CARED when it put together this album.  Every effect is deliberately placed for maximum effect.  Cryptic lyrics on many tracks leave you thinking about the album hours after you've finished playing it.<br /><br />Best lines:  \\"If you believe in me, how can I be dissolving?\\" , \\"For a change, I'll refrain from hiding all of me from you,\\"  and \\"I lose the joys of life, one at a time.\\"  This is an album for intelligent adults, ladies and gentlemen.<br /><br />With that in mind, if you are looking for a great \\"car\\" album or an album to play at the beach, this isn't it.  This album demands...and deserves...your full attention, at home, with no distractions.<br /><br />I can't wait to hear other AFI albums.

It leaves me spent and empty and sad. I suppose I would watch it to see Streep's astonishing performance. But the themes explored are so brutal, so unspeakable, that they leave me dumbfounded.<br /><br />Yes, there is beauty here. Cinematography, music, acting, writing. But there is a sense of hopelessness that leaves scars.<br /><br />It is worth seeing for a beautiful, haunting and incredible acting performance by Meryl Streep.
B000A7Q2DM|5.0|Some people classify 30STM as a space metal or space rock band.  At least people recongnize that their sound is different than mainstream modern rock.  Leto gets a bad rap being an actor/musician (see Russel Crowe), but he pulls both off very well.  I went to a recent 30STM concert and they sound awesome in concert and pretty close to how they sound on the CD, but you really appreciate how good Leto's brother is as a drummer in concert. <br /> <br />As for the CD, I can't count the number of times I have listened to it and everytime I enjoy it.  The radio songs: The Kill, Attack are very good and are very catchy in a good way...not a teeny-bopper way.  I would rate the best songs on the CD as The Kill, Yesterday, The Fantasy.  The bonus tracks are ok, but seemed kinda just thrown on there without linkage to the mood of the other ones.  I will definitely be buying their next album.

B000001FGG|4.0|I bought this one only for one song, Pressed Rat and Warthog.  I already had Cream's first album Fresh Cream, and a best of album, The Very Best of Cream.   Pressed Rat and Warthog is unusual in that the \\"singing\\" is a vocal recitative, done in the usual deadpan British vocal style.   The British deadpan vocal style can be found, e.g., on any album by the Gang of Four, almost anything by Squeeze, for example, Up The Junction, and in Keith Relf's work with the Yardbirds.    What is more unusual in Pressed Rat and Warthog are the British Isles folk tunes provided by the trumpet and other instruments.  I am certain that these melodies also appear in some of Ralph Vaughan Williams' shorter symphonic pieces which, in turn, were copied from folk musicians.  There are so many fine British and Irish folk melodies available.  It is too bad that these tunes have been popularized only by the Byrds, and by less than a handful of other rock'n'roll bands.      I saw Cream twice, once at the Fillmore in San Francisco where they played with Gary Burton Quartet and the Flaming Groovies.  Also, I saw Cream at the Oakland Coliseum, where It's A Beautiful Day was the opening act.       Also, I highly recommend the DVD of Cream live:  \\"Cream - Royal Albert Hall - London May 2-3-5-6 2005 (2005).\\"  This disc, which provides a generous selection of songs performed over a four day period, features plenty of close-ups, sharp in-focus images, and high quality sound.  We get to see how craggy faced and wrinkled Jack Bruce and Ginger Baker have become.  Aspiring guitar players will be awestruck by close-ups of Mr.Clapton's whizzing fingers, as they dart about the fretboard.  We get song after song after song, including a furiously grand performance of Toad.  It is well-worth every penny spent.

Just wrap Old Glory (that would be the American flag, children) around your candy arse like a big red white and blue diaper, and look up \\"VFW Hall\\" on Google while you sip your latte at Starbucks.

B00079FUI6|5.0|Let me start out by saying i'm a guy...and I absolutely love this show. My girlfriend bought the first season and had been trying to convince me to watch it since christmas. Finally, I agreed just to make her happy. All I can say is after the first five minutes I was hooked. I ended up watching the whole season in three days. It has everything. Great acting, beautiful women, amazing stories with cliffhanger endings that make you mad when the show ends leaving you in complete suspense, but can't help but love at the same time. I know this is considered by most men as a soap opera and just a girl thing, but I gotta tell you, give it five minutes and you won't be sorry. As for the DVD, it has some great special features with interviews with the cast and directors, a tour of the set and all kinds of stuff. In my opinion, this is one of the best shows on TV right now and here is your chance to pick up the first amazing season and see what the fuss is all about. Don't let this pass you by.
B0009YA3YU|5.0|Although the umd format seems to be going the way of the beta max, I'm a fan of videos on the psp.  I'm a gamer and a cinephile so the psp is perfect for me.  While one can transfer tivo recordings to a memory stick and watch video on the psp that way, owning a classic like Akira on umd was a must for me.  It's just one those films that can be watched over and over.  On the few occasions the pay cable movie channels do show Akira, it is often dubbed in english ruining the essence of the experience.  You must be able to hear the original japanese voice actors shout \\"Kanada!\\".  This version does offer english dubbing, so you have it if you want it; but, I think it should heard in japanese with english subtitles.<br /><br />I think anime is particularlly well suited for viewing on the smaller psp screen, so if you're just wanting to buy a movie you haven't seen before to watch on the go, anime is a great choice and Akira, (a dramatic and explosive thinking woman/man's scifi action adventure), is the best.
0792162803|5.0|In this Saturday Night Live skit turned into a movie (another one), orphan Mary Katherine Gallagher (Molly Shannon) lives with her grandmother (Glynis Johns) and attends St. Monica's High School.  Mary Katherine has a Dream - to be kissed by Sky Corrigan (Will Ferrell), the school's self-proclaimed best dancer. She thinks if she becomes a SUPERSTAR her prayers will be answered.  With the help of her friends (also misfits) she works on winning the school talent contest. Her main competition is the popular and cute (but evil on the inside) Evian who is dating Sky.  Evian is Mary Katherine's Arch-nemesis and will stop at nothing to see that Mary Katherine does not win the contest, the winner of which will be flown to Hollywood to star in a movie with positive moral values.<br /><br />For an SNL skit turned movie it's surprisingly good, mostly due to Molly Shannon and a strong comedic supporting cast including Ferrel, Harland Williams, Mark McKinney and even Tom Green in a small role as student Dylan Schmultz-Plutzker.  This is actually one of the few SNL movies that delivers a message as well as a laugh and proves that anyone can be a SUPERSTAR!
B0000AI45P|5.0|I don't know how Dr. Gonzo can even compare the solo in \\"Marquee Moon\\" to such great solos by Jimmy Page (Stairway to Heaven) and David Gilmour (Comfortably Numb).  I know it's easy to downplay such solos just because they also happen to be popular, overplayed, and overhyped over time.  But it's not the song's nor the artist's fault.  And comparing it to a solo like this doesn't even warrant an argument.  I also think Gilmour's solo is great but not the best, but still it ranks much higher than this one, namely for its melody.  Also, on the contrary, Page does not rely on fuzz pedals to carry/make his solos...leave that to today's guitarists.  He's the man, especially in the studio, and should not be trivialized along with other arena rockers that couldn't make 1/10 of quality songs or riffs as him.  They made it, played it, and paved the way for the inferiors to copy them; thus, Zeppelin and Page should stand apart from the punk cliche/ideology that Zeppelin sucked (though I'm not implying that is what Dr. Gonzo is saying).  The Verlaine solo was okay, but nothing more than similar solos done countless times, namely in the 60's.  The Peanut Butter Conspiracy's lead guitarist Bill Wolff comes to mind when I hear the solo.   <br /> <br />That said, their guitar work was great as a duo, and they always found new ways to surprise, which is always fun for me as a listener.  And it paved the way for an impressive album full of edge, rawness, melody, insight, and fun.  It spoke to you the way other punk bands, save the Clash and Jam, couldn't do as well musically or lyrically.  I hope the album finally gets the props it deserves once and for all...and for all the good reasons.
B00008GKEG|5.0|The Beatles Anthology DVD set was a great delight.  It is great to have the complete Beatles' Anthology on DVD.  I remember the old days of checking out the VHS versions from the library, but now I have the DVD set.<br /><br />The only issue I came across was that disc 4 and 5 would skip on my DVD player, but they worked fine in my DVD-Rom.

B0002DRDBE|4.0|Like many others, I believe, I got hold of the original 1994 \\"Clerks\\" because of the recently release sequel. What I found in this first installment is a good, authentic, sometimes quirky, sometimes hilarious comedy which I think we should take a bit more seriously that it takes itself.<br /><br />Despite being shot pretty much in its entirety in the same two basic settings - a convenience store and a video rental store - \\"Clerks\\" manages not to get stale as it progresses because Kevin Smith is inventive in the way he shoots. The fact that this movie was done in a real life setting, where Kevin Smith actually worked at the time, lends it a lot of authenticity. The dialogue contributes for that and even the grainy amateurish black and white picture helps it.<br /><br />According to Smith - who has this brilliant little role as an actor himself - this was meant to be the proverbial \\"movie about nothing\\", with a lot of F-word jokes. In theory, and then in practice, this kind of sounds like an R rated version of Seinfeld. Instead of Seinfeld's place and the coffee shop you have both stores, the relationship problems are also ever present even if in a much more earthly fashion. The real difference is that you get a lot of cursing. Other than that, it's just a day in the life of these two guys running two rusty little stores in Central Jersey.<br /><br />Dante is the main character and his day shouldn't have gone down this way in the first place. He's just covering for a colleague at the store and all hell breaks loose throughout the day. Who really steals the movie for me is Randal, his partner at the video rental store right next door, with his acid view of life. The way he messes up with the head of all his costumers - including Dante's - is brilliant and funny. Nevermind if he should act like he does.<br /><br />The dialogue ranges from fascinating to downright boring sometimes and it's definitely Tarantinoesque when at its best. It does suffer a bit on the acting department, which could have benefited from being a little more natural - seems rushed some of the time - but overall it's a great insight into the minds and state of affairs of Generation X America of mid 90s.<br /><br />Which leads me to ask, where are we now? Maybe \\"Clerks II\\" will answer that, but I haven't seen it yet as I write this.cting department, which could have benefited from being a little more natural - seems rushed some of the time - but overall it's a great insight into the minds and state of affairs of Generation X America of mid 90s. <br /> <br />Which leads me to ask, where are we now?

B000AMJG4Y|5.0|If you loved FFVII and you want to add on to the story line this is a great way to do it. For those people that say this isn't a great movie I have no clue why you don't think it is. <br /> <br />A little warning: The first time you watch it, make sure it is in Japanese. The first time I watched it in english and The voices were just not picked right at all for the villans, they all sound like little girls. They also sound like they are wineing all the time. I was a little diapointed watching it in english. Then I watched it in Japanese and it was much, much better and less distracting. <br /> <br />The story line is quick and the movie is short about 1 hour 10 min. But it is great watch it for your self and you will understand.
B00005JOML|4.0|My two cents on MV <br /> <br />After watching Mann's Miami Vice and subsequently reading several polarising reviews, I was reminded of bands like The Fall and Yo La Tengo, or albums such as \\"Trout Mask Replica\\" and \\"Bitches Brew\\", the thing they have in common is - either you get them or you don't.  <br /> <br />Unlike most filmmakers who works in crime drama, Mann's interests lie not in overt emotions (Scorcese, Woo, Coppola), bombast (Scott brothers, Michael Bay, Donner), schematics (Hitchcock, De Palma, Fincher) or didactic/polemic (Spike Lee, Tarantino, Oliver Stone) but in mood and psychology. His lineage is that of John Ford, Kurosawa, Leone and Anthony Mann, along with contemporaries such as Cronenberg, Mamet, Chris Nolan as well as a few non-genre world cinema directors, such as Wenders, Wong Kar Wai and Johnnie To.  <br /> <br />In Mann's hyper-realistic worlds, characters are defined by the careers. Like their creator, they are artisans, consummate professionals and borderline obsessives. They rarely let each other, let alone the viewer, into their world and motivations. The viewer is left to observe them at work, and the detail is God environment they inhabit. As UK critic Nick James noted in his essay on \\"Heat.\\" In Mann's films, the Style IS the substance. From the negative reviews, this doesn't sit well with critics weaned either on Sundance humanist aesthetic or more traditionalist/literary-bias where story is king. It almost like listening to a Steve Reich movement or a percussion piece and complaining that they couldn't get the melody when it's the rhythm that they should be appreciating in the first place. I am interested in seeing whether reviews from other parts of the world, say Japan and parts of Europe - where a monastic \\"work ethic\\" is still widely practiced and held in high esteem by their culture - would see things differently. <br /> <br />As most critics and viewers realised by now, Vice 06 is not Miami Vice at all, save for the character's names and Nonpoint's cover of \\"in the air tonight\\". What they hadn't pointed out is that it is actually an expanded and retooled hybrid of 2 stories in Mann's 2002 series \\"Robbery Homicide Division\\" which starred Tom Sizemore and Barry Shabaka Henley. The 2 episodes in question are episode 8 \\"Wild Ride\\" and episode 9 \\"Life is Dust\\". In \\"Wild Ride\\" - in which Tom Towles (Coleman in Vice) played a White Supremacist drug dealer on a crime spree which culminated in a crackdown in a trailer park which ended in a thug blowing up a trailer/meth lab. Then \\"Life is Dust\\" - based on a \\"story by Michael Mann\\" but directed by Mario Van Peebles, had Sizemore going undercover to track down a Vietnamese arms dealer, fell for his Vietnamese lawyer wife and ended in a gunfight at a sting gone wrong. As the two synopsis illustrated, the episodes served as the \\"LA Takedown*\\" to Vice 06. Whole snatches of dialogue and scenes were reshaped and refined for this film. <br /> <br />In fact, the interpersonal dynamics and characterisations of Vice 06 drew more from the Sizemore/Henley and co, than 80s Vice. Like many relationships in workplaces and unlike most cliched \\"buddy movie\\" pair ups, there are those which you hung with and there are those who you could rely on to get the job done, and 90% of the time they are not the same person. Like RHD, in Vice 06 C/T appeared to be working partners rather than friends.  <br /> <br />On the dvd commentary of \\"Collateral\\" Mann mentioned that he is interested in developing that film as \\"a third act\\" of something larger. I feel that this tactic was quite subtle there, as there were plenty of exposition - both visual and aural, to establish the story. In Vice on the hand, this structure was made explicit, the viewer is literally dropped, mid-scene, into Vice's world, almost like \\"finding\\" a show whilst channel surfing. Mann's conscious and deadpan homage to tv viewing? Maybe. Mann then propelled you into their mission in a \\"fly on the wall\\" manner. What happened over the next 2 hours was the cinematic equivalent of ECM album covers, Asian minimalist art, or a pared down sports car - form and function becoming one. <br /> <br />The film itself was all about deceit, from playful lies of Tubb's love scene, Crocket/Isabella's relationship, to Crockett/Tubbs persona and posturing, towards both the dealers and to the FBI. The surface sheen of the jargon, big boats, big guns and fast cars are also part of the lies/facade. Truth and character were gleaned through work and action - trademarks of Mann's pop existentialism. For those who didn't catch RHD, a natural non-Mann companion to Vice is Mamet's Spartan. Like Mann, Mamet is another artist who revel in dealing with machismo and professionals (Glengary Glen-Ross, Homicide, Heist, House of Cards and more recently, the Heat/Mann-like tv series, The Unit) yet Mamet's worlds had two things which made them more \\"mainstream\\" and \\"populist\\" than Mann - his \\"gift of gab\\" (quotable lines) and schematics (plot twists). One can only imagine what might happen if their worlds collide! <br /> <br />Like a pre-Michael Moore documentarian, Mann captured this \\"Mann-made\\" world and all its lies for the viewer to experience, the editoralising is done not through conventional dialogue but through purely cinematic/technical means. Visually, what is most uniquely Mann is that, despite his affinity to the handheld aesthetic - often seen in cinema verite, documentaries, reality and procedural shows like Homicide, NYPD Blue, Cops or the Shield - the results, to this viewer at least, were always perfectly composed and considered as opposed to frenetic. Its usage stemmed not from the desire simulate kineticism but rather to visually illustrate the interior of the characters, this was true in Heat, The Insider**, Ali and by and large in Vice. The same applies to the soundtrack which serves to underscore the emotions, and songs were used to define the time and place.  <br /> <br />Atmospherically, the word foreboding comes to mind, like Heat and RHD the smothering sense of dread were all consuming. Mann and his cinematographer's complete mastery of HD (not to mimic film but as a new medium) serve to instill the ambience with heat and texture. Violence is portrayed swiftly, realistically and had deadly or traumatising effects, in this respect, it reminded me of Cronenberg's \\"History of Violence\\". <br />  <br />So, on the surface at least, this makes for a ultimate Mann film, and while it is true in some ways (visual realisation, mise en scene often rivals The Insider and Heat), there were severe lapses of judgment that for me, made it a \\"flawed\\" piece. A few minor ones could be deemed \\"fixable\\" in the eventual dvd release (Nonpoint's appalling cover, relooping of some of Gong's dialogue, awkward timing on a few transitions), all but one of these flaws have to do with the four major \\"unfixable\\" flaws - the film's name, Colin Farrell, Jamie Foxx and Gong Li.  <br /> <br />I cannot say that the actors lack acting chops, rather, I feel that they were let down by their relative \\"newness\\". What made Heat so remarkable and affecting, even to non-Mann admirers - despite the similar lack of overt backstories - was the audiences' collective memory of DeNiro and Pacino's past works. Their twenty-odd year or so of baggage that helped to inform the audience subconsciously of who the characters were. Neither Farrell nor Foxx had the history or gravitas for viewers to latch onto, thereby the viewers were forced to see them as extensions of the persona created by Johnson and Thomas. Had the film went for a different title or had Mann chosen either more established actors or complete unknowns the result might be altogether more positive. Then there's Li, who, besides her difficulty in mastering English (a big problem in the US, but definitely less in the rest of the world), seemed miscast and was unable to fully convey the harsh yet tender aspect of her character. I couldn't help but imagine what someone like Maggie Cheung might bring to the role. <br /> <br />As someone who admired most of Mann's output, (in fact my least favourite were his more \\"traditional\\" work like \\"The Last of the  <br />Mohicians\\" and the 80s Miami Vice), I find this cinematic version of \\"Robbery Homicide Division - Miami Vice\\" to be an engrossing cinematic experience, and his output has been underappreciated by both the mainstream, critics and film scholars alike. <br /> <br />* \\"LA Takedown\\" was Mann's little seen tv movie from which Heat was derived from. <br />**Compare Mann's Insider to Stone's JFK, Nixon or even the earlier works of Alan J Pakula, and you'll begin to respect Mann's masterful riff on paranoia films, transforming a \\"ripped from the headlines\\" docu-thriller into an intense character study, by subverting the visual/aesthetic cues of a Stonesian conspiracy thriller.
0316666343|4.0|This is a great book and will give you the chills!! Good chills!  <br />This book is about a 14 year old girl named Susie Salmon who is murdered and watches her family from heaven. Alice Sebold wrote so beautifully that made you feel like she went through the experience. It will make you cry, but it is also a heart warming novel. It shows the life of a family that goes through the life of losing their daughter and how all the people in Susie's life is affected. <br />This is a novel I would reccomend to anybody.
B00005JOML|2.0|I have to laugh at these 4 and 5 star reviews that look like they were written to promote the film, instead of an honest opinion. First, this movie should have never been called Miami Vice. It is an insult to a great 80's TV series, that rivited people to there TV sets on Friday nights. What we have here is a 175 million dollar movie that looks like it was shot using cheap video cameras by amatures, and a story that was thrown together. <br />Mann should have taken Jamie Fox advice when he presented the idea to him to make a \\"remake\\" of Miami Vice. Not a film that just uses the name. I cannot begin to explane my disapointment in this film, and how bad it looks. I only gave the film two stars because of the action shoot out scenes which Mann is able to do very well. If there is a Miami Vice II movie, which I dought there will be, lets hope it's done right.
B000F0UV0E|5.0|My husband has not listened to ANY music since college days.  I bought him this CD for Father's Day, and he has already worn out copy #1 and now he is on #2.   <br /> <br />This CD WILL become a classic.  The collaboration of two of music's best story tellers and musicial artists is simply brilliant.  It goes down like fine wine...smooth, earthy and very complex.  Mark is an unparalleled song writer and Emmylou sounds like an angel. <br /> <br />There is a bit of everything on this CD.  Rock, Blues, Country and Folk.  If I had to pick out favorites, it would be the last two tracks...\\"All the Road Running\\" and \\"If This Is Goodbye\\".   <br /> <br />So much music that we are force fed on radio by programmers and music executives is...simply...wretched.  We hear what THEY want us to hear.  Finally we have an album with lyrics that actually make sense and tell a story and music that is beautifully crafted....all in one package. <br />
B000E1ZBGS|3.0|Firstly, if you have already seen the Pride and Prejudice miniseries with Colin Firth, don't expect too much from this movie or you will be disappointed, as I was.<br /><br />It seemed that the dialogue was \\"dumbed down\\" for the general audience.<br /><br />This film is one of the worst adaptations of Pride and Prejudice ever filmed and if Jane Austen were alive, she would demand that her name be removed from the film. Austen's novel is only superficially a story of the development of true love between Elizabeth Bennet and Fitzwilliam Darcy.  If one is making a period movie, one must be true to the period. The best thing that can be said about this film is that it contains many pretty scenes of the English countryside.<br /><br />I guess the main flaw of this new version is Darcy himself, a role played by Matthew MacFadyen. In the story he is rather dull and generally uninterested in what's going on. It must be difficult to replace Colin Firth as leading man and the Darcy of the miniseries of course had more screen time to show his inner struggle. But the new Darcy is so dull that frankly you don't care if he ends up winning Elizabeth's heart or not. There is absolutely no spark between Knightly and MacFadyen. At the end of the move they don't even kiss and as an audience you couldn't care less.<br /><br />I don't recommend this movie to anyone.  Go rent the miniseries with Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle if you want a real Jane Austen story.
B00005JKCH|4.0|Nerdish Peter Parker [Tobey Maguire]is bitten by a radioactive super-spider on a trip to a spider museum or something like that. This gives him all the powers of the spider, including being able to shoot webs, jump from building to building and the power of Spidey Sense.<br /><br />  Norman Osborn [Willem Dafoe], a businessman at the head of a company, wants to test the same genetically enhanced spider on himself. It ends up turning him into the Green Goblin.<br /><br />  That's sort of the plot for the movie \\"Spider-Man\\". It is based off of the comic book \\"Amazing Spider-Man\\".<br /><br />  Given how the Superman and Batman franchises had their movie debuts in the 80s, it's kind of amazing how the Spider Man comic book held off making a movie for this long.<br /><br />  But you don't care about all that stuff. You care about... Was this movie good? And the answer to that is yes. Tobey Maguire was not any fan's choice to be Peter Parker/Spider-Man, I don't think, as a lot of people have complained about him playing Parker.<br /><br />  He did a fine job, however, as did the rest of the cast. I don't see what all the complaining is about.<br /><br />  The action scenes leave a little to be desired. Although the fight scenes are less dark than \\"Batman Begins\\" or something like that, they are just okay.<br /><br />  The movie stays true to the comic book for the most part, but the movie is too long for its own good and some parts are pretty boring.<br /><br />  That being said, I still think this was pretty good. I have yet to see \\"Spider Man 2\\" so I don't know how that squares up to this movie, but if it is better, it will definitely deserve 5 stars.<br /><br />I will ultimately give it a 4.5/5.<br /><br />PROS: Good acting, stays true to the comic book, Okay action scenes.<br /><br />CONS: Just okay action scenes, a bit long.
B000EMGAOY|5.0|I've been a Chili Pepper fan since they first got started and this is their best album yet! Usually I'll buy an album for its cover song and then find out that I only really like a couple of tracks on it, but I enjoyed this one all the way through (both CD's). The Chili Pepper's sound seems to have matured a bit and I really like it! Highly recommended even if you are not a fan of their older material.
B000EGCITG|4.0|This cd is a big step up from miss Pink's last record. It has some great beats, and while it is still rocked out in true \\"Pink\\" style....it delves back a little into the r&b style she was first discovered for. I liked her better when she was the new voice of r&b so to hear songs that exhibited the natural soul in her voice was a great treat. Also, most evident to me, was the fact that this record was in fact the first time this artist has been so truthful and honest in her music. She has thoughts and ideas and feelings and messages for the world to hear and they are very well interpreted onto this cd (*note- Dear Mr President) There were only two songs that I didn't like but other than that I would hugely recommend this CD
B0002W18MU|5.0|I'll admit, there isn't much else to say that hasn't already been said in all these reviews of this wonderful album.  Yes it's a titan's last breath, yes it's a masterpiece, and yes it is an excellent way for Cash to ride off into the sunset.  At first I didn't want this album to come out, simply because I thought his last album ending with \\"We'll Meet Again\\" was an incredibly touching way to end his career.  With all the unreleased material on \\"Unearthed,\\" I was curious just what was left over for American V.  Little did I know of the high quality material Cash recorded in the short time period between his wifes death and his own. <br /> <br />This album is touching, heartbreaking, emotional, and outstanding.  Some of these songs like \\"Rose of my Heart\\" and \\"If You Could Read My Mind\\" just break your heart.  This album is much better than American IV.  His voice sounds better, the music is better, the songs are much better.  The feeling is there.  It's John's last statement to us all.  Where American IV had a lot of recognizable covers that just didn't live up, here he is back at recording songs that mean a lot to him.  Out of a desire to share his renditions with us, not out of a desire to get fans of Nine Inch Nails, Depeche Mode, Sting, the Beatles, and Simon & Garfunkel to buy his album. <br /> <br />Every song on this album is strong and moving.  From \\"Legend in my Time\\" to \\"Like the 309\\" to \\"God's Gonna Cut You Down\\" to \\"I Came to Believe.\\"  It is an excellent way to end an amazing career.  God Bless you Johnny and thank you for all the music you've given the world.
B000002A3T|5.0|If there is any list for best lyrics for a song \\"High hopes\\" would probably be an undisputed winner. The more I listen to this song the more I get from it. Every line and every word seem to have been carefully chosen. Sometimes I feel how can one get so perfect. May they just happen to put it by coincedence and Im just really deriving those thoughts with my own scrutiny. Ah! and the music its just breath-taking. It's definetly not inclined towards the old psychedelic content which I really like but in itself a whole new phenomena. <br />There seems to be absolutely no flaw in this album at all. Each track leads to another not only musically but also meaningfully. The album art too, how did they pull it off? About the individual tracks of this album \\"Cluster One\\", \\"Poles Apart\\", \\"High Hopes\\" are really nice and can be listened to as singles. But the whole album sounds great and best heard at one streach. <br />An album for everyone no matter who you are... how old you are... or what kind of music you prefer.
1594481938|4.0|Four people meet by chance on top of a high building in London on new year's eve, all with the plan of killing themselves for very different reasons. It's a fascinating beginning of a novel, which makes you wonder, where will they go from here?  <br /> <br />The book is a rather cynical description of people who have nothing in common - in fact, they don't even really like each other, resulting in constant bickering and bitching -, but feel somehow tied together through this strange meeting. They decide to wait 90 days, to see if they still want to commit suicide then, and that's where the book ends. If you are looking for likeable characters, personal revelations and all's-well-that-ends-well endings, this is NOT the book for you. In that sense, Hornby deviates from his previous books, which all end rather satisfactory with the knowledge that things will be OK. A LONG WAY DOWN is told through the eyes of the four lead characters, Martin, Jess, JJ and Maureen. None of these characters is very likeable, being either a rather pathetic victim or incredibly self-absorbed and obnoxious. But this is exactly what makes their original meeting all the more convincing and what makes A LONG WAY DOWN such a fascinating and entertaining book to read.  <br />
1878424319|4.0|I thought this book was excellent.  It is a good book for anyone who wants to get their thoughts in order.  It is a good reminder to not let others words hurt us.  It is good for self esteem and confidence.  I highly recommend it to anyone who feels they need a boost in these areas and for others to know if they are on the right track with their thinking and life.
B00005JOML|4.0|I like the new Miami Vice.  It was good to Jamie Foxx in a serious movie.  I know this was not his first serious role, but it was the first one I saw.  I'm an action movie lover, so I enjoyed the shooting scenes.  Great Movie!
B000E1ZBGS|1.0|The BBC version is the definitive Pride and Prejudice. In this they try to second guess the master of prose by re-writing Jane Austen's superlative writing. It can't be done and the result is total garbage. Don't waste your time or money.
0312995423|3.0|After reading the other three Dan Brown novels, this one was a disappointment. The premise was good, but it became too unbelievable at times. On the other hand, it is a better story than I could ever come up with. I just completed the biggest exam of my life last week and the last thing I wanted to do was start some heavy reading. I wanted to sit and relax in a park and read a fast-paced novel. This book did it for me. Although there are much better novels out there, this book kept me reading until the end and got my mind off other things, thus, fulfilling its purpose as a cheap, paperback fast-paced novel.
B000FA57NK|5.0|Great movie! Make it part of your collection. Good story, beautiful video and great sound. Turn your volume up on the blast-off and you will feel the power!
0812548094|5.0|Stone of Tears is a great sequel.  I read the first book and wasn't impressed with Goodkind's writing; however, I loved the characters and the idea behind the series so I decided to keep reading them. <br /> <br />This book exceded my expectations.  It seemed like Goodkind's writing improved alot, maybe it was just good editing.  Anyway, the character devlopement was throughly enjoyable and storyline progress seems to go at a perfect pace.   <br /> <br />One thing I didn't like was in the beginning of the book everyone seems to cry, about everything, all the time.  Fortunately that pattern didn't continue after the first 100 pages so I was happy. <br /> <br />If you liked the first book or just thought it was OK then I still recommend giving the second book a chance.  I thought it was much better then the first.

0471413909|2.0|The Paleo Diet is based on an interesting premise- the idea that what we ate before agriculture suited our needs perfectly because our bodies had been bred by evolution in response to our what we could find to eat in our environment. It seems like a giant leap to assume our paleolithic ancestors naturally gravitated towards exactly what we need to eat. Animals in the wild do make sensible choices most of the time, because their decisions are instinctual. Self-awareness creates a problem that doesn't exist for other animal behavior as it does for humans. Sometimes we do things out of curiosity, or laziness, or false beliefs. So, considering the erratic behavior of present-day humans, who is to say our paleolithic ancestors were any more intuitive about their nutritive needs? Even the book suggests humans ate what they did out of trial and error, frequently just trying whatever they encountered in the wild.<br /><br />The fact that wild foods are frequently much richer in nutrients than domestic foods does not mean that you must subscribe to a strict paleolithic diet to take advantage of this fact. Rather, eat more wild-sourced food. Just about anything edible from the wild will be a healthy food, unless the environment from which it comes is polluted- and that is a very real problem.<br /><br />Meat is a very dodgy thing nowadays, not like it was in the pristine wilderness of the paleolithic era. The Paleo diet would be a healthy thing if we were still in that world. Now, we need to worry about heavy metals in fish flesh, and antibiotics and growth hormones in feedlot animals. Beef will have some naturally occuring omega 3 if the animals were allowed to wander in a more or less natural fashion, as they did when the most commonly employed mechanism for animal control was the cowboy. This is no longer true. The average cut of meat in your supermarket is taken from a feedlot animal, fed the wrong food and in conditions unsanitary in the extreme. Basing a diet on meat in this day and age can be dangerous. You must choose your meat sources carefully. Meat made from free-range animals raised on pesticide-free in a caring manner can be very hard to find.<br /><br />I found Loren's rejection of all products of agricultural development a little too simple minded, and in some cases irresponsible. There is nothing at all unhealthy about whole grain foods or legumes consumed in moderation, and significant weight loss could occur for most people if they ingested organic whole grains and legumes but conscientiously avoided only the major evil products of agriculture: high fructose corn syrup, trans-fatty acids, artifical sweeteners, uncleaned foods raised non-organically with pesticides and herbicides, and improperly raised food animals.<br /><br />My main objection to the book is nearly one hundred pages (about half) of the book is dedicated to the spiel- convincing you this thing is real and valid and worth your time. I think the forward to the book or perhaps the first chapter alone would have been sufficient for that purpose. After a while you get the feeling Loren is trying too hard to sell this idea to you, and it really interferes with the flow of the book.<br /><br />Further, a lot (but not all) of the studies cited show only marginal advantages of different aspects of this diet. The claims that you will experience great weight loss and feel better than you ever have are quite nice to imagine, and peppered throughout the book. But it's hard to believe with the less than overwhelming studies cited.<br /><br />One last nitpick. One great way to compensate for the lack of typical food taste enhancers like salt and sugar is the use of herbs and spices. something very much like the paleo diet already exists as part of peasant cuisines around the world. It's a pity the recipes included do not explore those, but instead offer somewhat watered down and uninspired fare instead. Espscially asian cuisines frequently make due with alot of the ingredients that are ok on the paleo diet, and their interesting spices make it all the more entertaining. I found the recipes far too traditional and western-centric.alot of the ingredients that are ok on the paleo diet, and their interesting spices make it all the more entertaining.

2067002627|3.0|very interesting purchase. its actually a map you used to get in gas stations. shows where bunkers are & VERY detailed road, towns, & terain. not much on where battles fought & also from 1947. there are probably lots of changes to map now, but still for the money i like it.

B000002J1U|5.0|Though the first two albums are quite well liked this review sees them especially the first one as not being what zeppelin is the best at when they traded there blues roots for a more folk approach IMO they really came into there own as not another blues rock act like the stones but have there own sound. This album is one wild ride with the huge hit imagrent song which far surpasses communication breakdown or good times bad times to the amazing ballid since i've been loving you this album is a beautiful folk rock tiumph not to be missed.
B00005JKGZ|5.0|I first saw this movie when I was seven years old and it has been one of my all-time favorites ever since. The cinematography is gorgeous. The technicolor brings out the lush set designs and costumes. This is one those movies that you should watch if you're feeling sick or depressed. It never fails to make me feel better! The catchy tunes are beautifully sung by the talented Judy Garland. Among them are \\"The Boy Next Door\\" and \\"Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas\\". The uncomplicated problems of the Smith family are a great escape from the complex lives that modern people lead.
0060989157|2.0|If this is supposed to be the best in rock writing, then rock really is dead.  Here we have the story of next to no talent musicians who can't write and play music to save their lives, telling their sad and happy tales of life in the rock and roll meat grinder.  Its incredible that a book this long can take up so many pages telling you next to nothing.  Page after page of nothing but excess in taking drugs, the groupie scene, more drugs,more groupies, with an occasional change of scene and then back to the same old boring things.  I got dizzy just reading this junk and went back to see if it got better.  It never does. I found myself laughing out loud at some of it.  All these groupies and no paternity suits?  No hush money?  Nothing about paying them off to keep quiet?  No STDs? No death threats from jealous boyfriends and other unhappy people? I've read a number of books about the great life celebrities are supposed to have... its anything but.  If rockers know that groupies are after their money and status, then why do they keep going to bed with them? Then its the number of groupies these guys claim to be with and yet no problems.  What it must be like to be a rock star... if only that were true. Do they have unlimited funds to pay them off?  Or is it just another rock legend?  Most people who have kicked off drugs spend years in rehab and more years after that drying out.  Yet these guys do drugs as if running out and come out of it without hardly any problems.  Man, give me a break.  This is the dirt alright, dirt thrown in your eyes. The Dirt is just another in a long line of hyped up bunk to take your money, while having you fantasize.  Its not even a good fantasy. Sixx supposedly had 30 or so groupies in one day.  He had a few groupies before a concert and a few others after the concert.  The authors forgot to mention that to pull that one off he must have consumed a \\"mountain\\" of viagra or other sex stimulants.  The rock group Hanoi rocks, questioned the claims of these guys and its easy to see why.  Millions of records sold etc. means millions of dollars in their and producers pockets. They get your money and you still fantasize.  The book should be sold in the fiction section of the bookstore.
B000F5GNX8|4.0|Harry Lockhart, (Robert Downey Jr., CHAPLIN) is a down-on-his-luck petty thief who accidentally gets his partner-in-crime killed one fateful evening while trying to burgle a toy store. Harry is able to slip away from the cops by stumbling into a movie audition and, to his surprise, procuring the part! He's whisked away to Hollywood where he meets up with Gay Perry (Val Kilmer, TOMBSTONE), a private eye who's supposed to help train Harry for his upcoming movie role. But things aren't as they seem. The only reason Harry was sent to Hollywood was to be the fall-guy for the murder of a young socialite. Harry also meets up with his childhood sweetheart, Harmony (Michelle Monaghan, NORTH COUNTRY) and sparks begin to fly ...right after she slams Harry's hand in a door, causing him to lose a finger.<br /><br />Harry and Gay Perry are forcibly teamed up together due to their circumstances. Harry turns out to be one helluva detective with the oft needed help of Harmony and Gay Perry. He also becomes deadly with a gun, forming a sort of running cliche throughout the film (this was pulled off VERY well, by the way).<br /><br />KISS KISS, BANG BANG is one of those films you have to watch to believe. So many stereotypes are ripped apart and so many cliches manhandled that it truly boggles the mind. Most -- if not all -- of this is done through dialogue, and it's wonderfully ridiculous how well Kilmer and Downey Jr. play off each other (there's even a kiss between them that makes for an interesting scene). Example: when Kilmer (who plays a tough homosexual) watches Downey pull a tiny gun out from his glovebox, Kilmer remarks, \\"That's my faggot gun.\\" We also get to see Kilmer use the \\"faggot gun\\" in a very trouser destroying manner.<br /><br />The comedy in Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang is dark, similar in tone to THE MATADOR (another flick I absolutely loved). If you're \\"in to\\" those kind of films, you should most definitely check out this one. I'll be watching it again!
B00005MP58|5.0|This is the best Pride and Prejudice I've seen.  The recent movie version pales by comparison, in my opinion.  The portrayals tug on my heart and all are well-acted.  I highly recommend this film to lovers of period comedy and Jane Austen.
B000055QHO|5.0|Enya brings us once again the haunting music that is her trademark, written in multiple languages.<br /><br />The CD kicks off with the mellow instrumental \\"A Day without Rain.\\" A piano provides the principal musical instrument with Enya humming in harmony. The music evokes nature at peace; woods with a light breeze on a cool day, light clouds dotting a peaceful sky. You could readily sleep to this music. The instrumental leads into \\"Wild Child,\\" a faster paced song that stays within the musical theme of the peaceful outdoors, but now the music has the theme of the wild, yet innocent child, frolicking in the benign environment. Enya's vocals are as much instrument as the instruments themselves. This song is beautiful in its conception and execution.<br /><br />\\"Only Time\\" follows. Enya proves once again that she has the ability to create beautiful musical poetry. The deceptively light lyrics can pull the listener into a deep contemplation of love and life and the roads that we choose.  The lyrics also explain that we must have patience because only time will allow all to be revealed in fullness.<br /><br />Enya then switches themes and styles as she moves into a Latin song with heavy bass backing. The literal translation of \\"Tempus Vernum\\" is \\"Spring Time.\\" The lyrics appear to be a series of words that might be considered to be opposites, such as east and west, earth and star, and autumn and spring. Thus in one sense Roma Ryan's lyrics appear to be exploring the Yin and Yang of some Asian philosophies, the contrast of opposites. The serious ponderous tone of the music is heavily contemplative, deep philosophical evaluation of a subject; beautiful in the selection of words and the musical match.<br /><br />The musical tone then becomes a Gaelic lament, \\"Deora ar mo chroi,\\" or \\"Tears on My Heart.\\" The gentle, sad music belies the actual translation of the Gaelic, which is full of beauty and happiness. The effect is more in the poetry of the Gaelic and how well the music is matched to it rather than the actual meaning of the words. The execution is very artistic and poignant.<br /><br />Enya then lightens the music with \\"Flora's Secret,\\" which has a faster pace than the previous two selections. This love song is musical poetry is beautiful and full, a musical wine. You may either interpret the song from an aspect of nature, or of two lovers. In either case, this song is an experience.<br /><br />\\"Fallen Embers\\" is a dream, a memory of a former love. Mellow, slow, but sufficiently ethereal to keep from being ponderous. Enya's beautiful voice is the centerpiece of the song. The instruments add fullness, but her voice alone could have carried this song.<br /><br />\\"Silver Embers\\" is another instrumental with a moderate pace. Short and, as always, beautiful, this song leads into \\"Pilgrim,\\" yet another lament. I personally enjoy this song because the theme is that there are many roads to choose in life, some of which lead to nowhere, and yet we have no clue as to which is which, and which is the best. We are all pilgrims in life, and this song is our song.<br /><br />Sometimes I have difficulty in interpreting Roma Ryan's lyrics. Such is the case with \\"One by One.\\" I understand that this song is about love, but some of the lyrics imply there is a constraint between him and her, and she is longing to be free of those constraints. Yet the final stanza implies that love binds them and will never die; a bit confusing for my poor brain.<br /><br />This version adds the song \\"Isobella,\\" a sumptuous four and a half minute bonus track that is worth.  I usually avoid recommending alternative releases that contain unnecessary bonus tracks.  In the case of this CD, \\"Isobella\\" should have appeared on the U.S. release.  The layered vocals are beautifully done and rank with some of Enya's best, which is disappointing because it did not appear on the original U.S. release.  Perhaps a future U.S. release will include this song.<br /><br />The quicker-paced \\"Lazy Days\\" finishes off the CD. Given the general theme of nature and love this song appears to tidily wrap up the CD with the promise of things yet to come.<br /><br />Enya has once again created another sumptuously beautiful work of music that you can listen to time after time just to begin to appreciate the complexity and poetry of this music. This music is unique and nearly stands in its own category. It is artistically and technically flawless. The only possible flaw this CD has is that it is only about 39 minutes long. I could argue that for the beauty and quality of the music 39 minutes is a great length, but it seems to me that a bit more quantity would have made this CD absolutely phenomenal. As it is, it begs to be combined with another short work to create a full CD's worth of music; admittedly a minor flaw.  Enjoy!/> <br />The quicker-paced \\"Lazy Days\\" finishes off the CD.

B00000G3PA|3.0|Armageddon is one of those movies that have ridiculous science scenes, retarded plotlines, and horrible acting; yet, it ends up with enjoyable scenes and hilarious moments.<br /><br />First of all, the thought of NASA, and the entire world for that matter, relying on a bunch of moronic drillers to save the planet by flying two space shuttles to an asteroid that is hurtling towards the earth to drill into said asteroid and insert a bomb in the middle...well, that's a mouthful of stupid.  Whoever thought of this idea for a movie should be castrated.<br /><br />Let's get to the specifics.  Space shuttles don't quite fly around like planes; they just aren't that maneuverable.  Secondly, if someone is driving a go-cart on an asteroid, which doesn't quite have the gravity of a planet like Earth, the vehicle will not be able to perform any jumps and then land back on the surface of the asteroid.  Also, when a space shuttle crash lands on an asteroid, chances are there will be explosions and few survivors.  Finally, there is NO WAY IN HELL that the world would be able to put together a plan to save the planet in just over a week, when an asteroid suddenly appears to be on a collision course with the planet.  There are, however, redeeming qualities to the movie.<br /><br />Michael Clark Duncan steals every scene in which he appears.  His tough guy with mental issues is spot-on and hilarious.  Steve Buscemi as the deranged, slightly insane second-fiddle is a perfect compliment to the stars of the show.  Billy Bob Thornton performs well as a subdued, but worried NASA chief in charge of figuring out how to save humanity.  Liv Tyler is beautiful and competent as usual, playing the daughter to Bruce Willis, the most experienced driller on the planet, and a guy who rules with a little laissez faire and a little iron fist.  Unfortunately, Ben Affleck ruins the otherwise decent acting.  His unbearable scene with animal crackers made me vomit just a little bit.  Whatever Affleck was trying to accomplish, whatever feel, look, or emotion, it never worked.  It was off the entire movie, and he nearly took the rest of the cast down with him.<br /><br />Overall, the movie is decent, and the lesser known actors provide real entertainment.  If the science can be ignored, there are enough mindless action scenes, comedic scenes, and drama to save the day...just like the drillers.k was trying to accomplish, whatever feel, look, or emotion, it never worked.

B000G03RJA|5.0|Those of us who had the opportunity to know and love Laura Branigan when she was at her peak are a bit surprised that so many are just now discovering how wonderful she was. From rattle-the-walls dance hits to moving ballads that could take you to the very edge, Laura Branigan delivers. <br /> <br />This remastered collection includes some of Laura's greatest hits, such as \\"Gloria\\", \\"Solitaire\\", \\"Self Control\\", and \\"Power of Love\\", as well as a few songs that somehow missed being a big hit, like \\"Moonlight On Water\\" and \\"Shattered Glass\\", both of which were certainly worthy of Top 10 status but somehow - amazingly - were overlooked at the time of their release. <br /> <br />Laura Branigan had an incredible octave range, as well as an ability to communicate emotion to the listener that was unique, which set her apart from her peers. It's impossible to just listen to a Laura Branigan song, because Laura invites you in and makes you a part of the song when she sings. <br /> <br />Laura is no longer with us, but the music she left behind for us is her greatest gift. The songs in this collection range from trendsetters that set the world on fire when they were originally released, to classics that are timeless, and sound as good today as they did years ago. Compare Laura's version of \\"I Found Someone\\" to Cher's, and Laura's \\"Power of Love\\" with Celine Dion's rendition. Most will agree that Laura took both of those songs to a dimension that is a cut above the other versions. <br /> <br />The music world was never the same after Laura came along, and her absence now only reminds us how special she truly was. This latest release from one of the greatest is a snapshot of time, when a young lady named Laura Branigan redefined music as we knew it, and won over millions of loyal fans who to this day are her other half.
B000F5GNX8|3.0|As its title suggests, \\"\\"Kiss Kiss Bang Bang\\" is a film noir spoof whose energy and style  compensate for its overall dearth of laughs.<br /><br />The highly complicated plot begins when Harry Lockhart (Robert Downey Jr.), a petty thief living in Manhattan, literally stumbles into a movie acting career while fleeing the police on a heist gone wrong.  Before he knows what's happened, he's standing by a pool in Hollywood surrounded by a slew of moviemaking hotshots and wannabe starlets including Val Kilmer as a gay private eye and Michelle Monaghan as an aspiring actress who also happens to be a childhood chum from Harry's days growing up in Indiana.  Then, as if he had suddenly fallen into one of those dime store crime novels, Harry finds himself plunged into a dark mystery involving not one but two unexplained murders.<br /><br />Writer/director Shane Blake has a great time lampooning not merely the conventions of film noir and Chandler-esque pulp fiction - the convoluted plotting, the self-conscious dialogue, the smart-alecky narration and the casual popgun violence - but Tinsel Town phoniness as well.  In both storyline and style, the film often blurs the fine line separating mundane \\"reality\\" from the contrivances and absurdities of movie fiction, most notably by having Harry frequently address the audience directly in his narration.<br /><br />There's no denying that \\"Kiss Kiss Bang Bang\\"  is a high energy lark, filled with creativity and imagination and featuring sharp performances from Downey Jr., Kilmer, Monaghan and a whole host of excellent supporting players.  The problem with the film, though, is that for all its cleverness, it really just isn't as witty as it should be.  Although we can sense what it is we're supposed to be finding humorous, for some reason the laughs just never seem to come with any great regularity.  Too often the humor feels forced and strained so that at best the movie elicits a chuckle here or there instead of a series of full-throated guffaws.<br /><br />Still, this is a fast-paced, clever, if not particularly memorable film that captures the quintessence of L.A.-derived fiction.l, this is a fast-paced, clever, if not particularly memorable film that captures the quintessence of L.A.-derived fiction.
1400032717|3.0|The plot of Haddon's \\"Curious Incident\\" is straightforward and peripheral: an autistic 15-year-old named Christopher discovers his neighbor's murdered dog and vows to solve the mystery, write down his efforts, and meanwhile pass A-Level Maths. This small mystery spirals to involve humans.    Since the mystery itself is thin (including the Larger Mystery) and Christopher lacks the capacity to divine human motivation and make socially based connections, the bulk of the text is made up of tangents in which Christopher teaches us about logical reasoning (e.g., the counter-intuitive natures of consciousness and probability). Point taken: Christopher knows as much as or more than we do about approaching truth, even if he can't penetrate human drama.    The novel is fascinating, provocative, and (I've heard) dead-on if you have enough direct or indirect experience with autism. As an outsider with an autistic relative, I considered the plot contrived - most of the adults are sleeping with each other, to Christopher's bemusement - but the characterization of our protagonist is remarkable. If I lacked a real-life basis for comparison, I might find Christopher's implausible family drama and clueless arrogance tiresome.    However, having seen my relative moan and scream over unplanned deviations from his routine, I always assumed that his mind at those moments must be chaotic. Christopher explains lucidly, \\"I make this noise [groaning] when there is too much information coming into my head from the outside world.\\" He goes on to compare his reaction to that of a computer whose memory is overloaded and must be rebooted. \\"Groaning\\" reboots his mind such that he can process information again.    If you have the patience to focus on Christopher, \\"Curious Incident\\" is well worth the read. However, if the sentence, \\"[A]nd I was brave and I wrote a book and that means I can do anything\\" makes you cringe (it made me cringe), you might want to opt out.

B000E97X66|5.0|My only complaints are that songs I would have preferred to hear up-tempo (Kitty's Back and For You) are slowed down.  But this collection is a live, greatest hits of the first three Bruce records ... the musicianship is second to none (they were as tight as Zappa's Helsinki concert on YCDTOSA V. 2), with amazing bass work and superb keyboards.  I don't remember hearing Weinberg sound so powerful, nor Clarence Clemons so passionate or alive.  All I have to say, is if this record were released after the concert, it would have beat Frampton Comes Alive as the top selling double album of all time, and possibly the best live record ever.  It's that good.
0525457585|4.0|This book invokes alot of nostalgia, purely for being just as good as the movie, and letting you recall that experience more intimately, through reading.

B000F7CMRM|1.0|The story line of this film is a complete muddle! They tried to toss everything into this movie but the kitchen sink. This film makes the movie Heavens Gate look like a masterpiece as far as a story line that can be followed and making sense. To me it seems this film was just thrown together to make a buck by including anything and everything to cover any and all bases! What a hodgepodge mess! And people paid to sit through this in movie theaters?
B000001ZS4|5.0|This is one of my all time favorites,even though I'm all jazz now...I got my first recording of Equinoxe in '79/colllege, [from my Turkish boyfriend ooh la la,] and was sooo impressed...and still am.  Through the years it has been the soundtrack/backdrop in my life for activities from studying,to day dreaming, to vacations, to 'head' trips, to trippin' in the bedroom!,to beddy-bye sounds for what I got after trippin' in the bedroom,[three sons, 10,8, & 3 yrs.]  We all love this selection. IT MAKES US HAPPY, albeit, for different reasons!  I recommend this for tired minds and dreamers of ANY AGE.
0684824906|5.0|This is a very enjoyable book to read.  At the end of each story and blurb about Lincoln, I found myself already wanting to start looking for more books about this amazing man. <br /> <br />This book also speaks volumes about Doris Kearns Goodwin.  She obviously admired the man and with her research cut through much of the dirty laundry other authors had aired for Lincoln and addressed it very objectively with first-hand accounts from his friends, rivals and family. <br /> <br />I recommend this book to everyone.
B0001XAPX8|4.0|Not a bad interpretation of Philip Roth's novel; Anthony Hopkins is, yes, a little too British and not entirely believable in the racially ambiguous role he is assigned & Nicole Kidman does bring a little too much star power to her part, but the bones of the story remain intact (and I have indeed read the Roth novel). I think Gary Sinise is a fine choice for the role of Zuckerman, the novelist whose outside perspective tells  the story, <br /> <br />The inner nexus of themes has to do with a number of important and archetypal issues that circle around each other, never reaching full closure.  To what extent can a person \\"opt out\\" of full participation in life, either because society or nature makes it hard? Who do you betray when you make that choice? Does society (or your employer) bear any responsibility? Sex and love, what is the relationship, finally and in the last analysis?  <br /> <br />The genius of Roth's novel is to raise such difficult questions; thankfully, the film does not shy away from them. Really, it's a praiseworthy effort to convey how complicated it is to negotiate the difficult passage between full participation and cowardly retirement from the business of life. I'd definitely recommend this film; its flaws are venial; its accomplishments are mortal.

B00001U0DP|5.0|Released to movie theaters in 1998, like many people, I could not conceive how a comedy and satire about the Holocaust would be an award-winning film ... yet having viewed it, I *do* now understand: it is the personality of Roberto Benigni who uses Charlie Chaplinesque comedy techniques to emphasize the tragic events which seem even more intense as the viewer knows the truth. Roberto Benigni plays Guido, a waiter who moves to Arezzo, Italy and literally bumps into Dora (played by Nicoletta Braschi, his real-life wife), a stylish and attractive young lady, with whom he instantly falls in love, only to learn she is engaged to someone else. As luck would have it, he is the waiter at their engagement reception - where all kinds of mishaps occur, as Guido tries to engage Dora's attention. He accidentally drops something on the floor and crawls beneath the table to retrieve it while Dora peeks under the table and crawls half-way to meet him ... where they exchange a secret kiss (despite her fiance sitting at the table). One thing leads to another, Guido magically rides in on a green-painted horse, sweeping Dora up onto the saddle with him, as they ride off ... together to be married.<br /><br />Next, more than five years has passed, as the present turns into the future, within the courtyard of Guido's home ... Their son Joshua is the sunshine of their lives, as he sits on the bicycle along side his mother, as Guido peddles into the town. Joshua tends the bookstore while his dad is taken off to the police station, to register as a Jewish store owner. Guido does the famous goose-step routine to entertain his son ... Shortly afterwards, on Joshua's birthday, the local Jewish population is taken off to internment. Guido tells Joshua a story about going on a trip, a secret trip, only his mother knows about it. Guido establishes the rules of the game, where on this trip, if they earn 1000 points, Joshua wins a *real* tank. As a little boy, Joshua is in love with his toy tank ...<br /><br />There are numerous poignant scenes within the film which emphasize the risks Guido is willing to take to keep his wife and son safe from harm. He manages to send Dora a very personal message by playing an opera song on a loudspeaker, and even Joshua gets in a loving message to his mother. Guido continues the game, despite Joshua's suspicions, as other prisoners give him messages of what is truly happening at the camp. One of the most bizzare twists is when, Joshua manages to escape from taking a shower ... his dad says, you should take the shower (as meaning a real cleansing one) ... not knowing that Joshua's life was held in the balance, and tilted toward \\"life\\" by having refused and run away from the shower which meant *certain* death. The rescue scene by an American soldier, who has Joshua hop on board for a ride is very moving ... especially when realizing Guido who was dressed as a woman with a babushka tied beneath her chin, had just been caught, and led away into an alley, where gunfire was heard in the distance. The German soldier walked out alone ... The fact is, Guido sacrified himself in search of his family after the war was declared over, and in the end, had died in the attempt to keep his family alive. To appreciate the magic of this film ... it must viewed, with an open mind. There is no doubt in my mind, the film deserves the 70 world-wide film festival awards it has won ... including the prestigious Gran Prix at Cannes, three awards in Jerusalem, including the Mayor's award and the Jerusalem Medal,  Best Actor, Best Score, and Best Foreign Film at the Academy Awards and at the European Film Awards, Best Film and Best Actor. Erika Borsos [pepper flower].<br /><br />There are numerous poignant scenes within the film which emphasize the risks Guido is willing to take to keep his wife and son safe from harm. He manages to send Dora a very personal message by playing an opera song on a loudspeaker, and even Joshua gets in a loving message to his mother. Guido continues the game, despite Joshua's suspicions, as other prisoners give him messages of what is truly happening at the camp. One of the most bizzare twists is when, Joshua manages to escape from taking a shower ... his dad says, you should take the shower (as meaning a real cleansing one) ... not knowing that Joshua's life was held in the balance, and tilted toward \\"life\\" by having refused and run away from the shower which meant *certain* death. The rescue scene by an American soldier, who has Joshua hop on board for a ride is very moving ... especially when realizing Guido who was dressed as a woman with a babushka tied beneath her chin, had just been caught, and led away into an alley, where gunfire was heard in the distance. The German soldier walked out alone ... The fact is, Guido sacrified himself in search of his family after the war was declared over, and in the end, had died in the attempt to keep his family alive. To appreciate the magic of this film ... it must viewed, with an open mind. There is no doubt in my mind, the film deserves the 70 world-wide film festival awards it has won ... including the prestigious Gran Prix at Cannes, three awards in Jerusalem, including the Mayor's award and the Jerusalem Medal,  Best Actor, Best Score, and Best Foreign Film at the Academy Awards and at the European Film Awards, Best Film and Best Actor.

B000F4MLZ8|5.0|Josh Radin was introduced to me by \\"Scrubs\\", in the unforgetable 314 episode (I will not elaborate, if someone didn't see it) and I was deeply moved by his tunes. <br />Radin have a very distinct line, in which he can do charms. <br />If you heard even one song of his, and liked it - You'll surely like the whole disc.
B000EMGAOY|5.0|Music sucks today, let's face it. Emo and punk run the airwaves, and I've more or less lost faith in the people's current musical ability. Almost. Somehow, Red Hot Chili Peppers keep making awesome music....i don't know how, but they do. Stadium Arcadium isn't a masterpiece, but it's definitely a damn good double album. I've been looking for something like this for awhile, and I'm happy that there is a band in 2006 that can come up with good music. I'm seeing 'em in October, and they're gonna be awesome. Snow is the best song I've heard in a while, and Dani California, Stadium Arcadium, Hey, Torture Me, and Turn it Again are all excellent songs. Obviously it's a lot different than Blood Sugar Sex Magik, but c'mon these guys are getting older, physically and musically. This easily tops By the Way and Californication, and is different but on par with Blood Sugar Sex Magik. Its mellower, less funk-influenced, but if you listen to both albums it's kind of a nice change of pace. John Frusciante is without a doubt a very talented musician and I love his melodies. He has some cool solos in here, not too mention some addictive hooks (i.e. Snow). And Flea....that guy is what bass is all about. You don't hear the bass as much as you used to in their albums, but he's like a minor deity of bass guitar, so bow down. I mean, I'm more of a classic rock/metal kind of guy, but the Peppers are fantastic. They just know how to make music, plain and simple. I see a bright future for 'em. So do the musical universe a favor and buy this instead of whatever filth some trendy screamo group came out with and enjoy.
1580084621|5.0|When I first came across this book in the stores, I have to admit I was highly skeptical about the authenticity of the recipes contained in this book....was it by another Westerner who declared himself an expert on Thai food after one or two short vacations to the country?  An Australian restaurateur you say?  With an award-winning restaurant in London?  Was the award judged by Thai people?      Thailand has a rich culinary heritage which has, in part, been shaped by foreign influences.  Thai food in turn is a highly complex intermingling of tastes: salty, sour, sweet, spicy and umami (a Japanese term to indentify the 5th 'taste').  Furthermore it is a fairly impenetrable cuisine least of all because of the language barrier and the mysterious ingredients.  To top things off this book was written by a non-Thai.  That said, my initial concerns turned out to be completely unfounded and I am happy to say that this is one book that I would wholeheartedly recommend to anyone who is serious about real Thai food.  Needless to say, the book extends far beyond just Tom Yum Kung and Pad Thai!    At the beginning of the book, Thompson gives a brief (but highly informative)introduction to Thailand and its history, religion and regional cuisine which sets the tone for the rest of the book.  There is also a whole chapter about the most common cooking techniques as well as ingredients.  His recipes are written in a fairly conversational manner, which I really like, and, most importantly, he does not advocate taking shortcuts or making substitutions which the Thais wouldn't normally make/take themselves.  Thompson clearly explains in his introduction that his reason for doing this is so that he doesn't compromise his goal of accurately capturing the Thai cuisine.  Personally I don't understand the other reviewer's gripes about ingredients being hard to find!  Don't bother cooking those recipes then!?!  Anyway I digress....the recipes produce highly authentic and tasty results.  I have travelled extensively in Thailand and the results I've had with this book match my wonderul dining experiences there.    One final point to bear in mind: some recipes are laborious, others less so.  However, that is keeping with the true spirit of the Thai cuisine!         In short, this is an excellent book well worth the space on your bookshelf.  I'll even add that it'll probably become a classic cookbook!
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|I am a fan of Jane Austen and while this film does it's best to stick to the reality of the book it does omit characters and takes the liberty of adding scenes or altering them completely.  This does not bother me as I know that seldom do movies follow an author's intention.  Having said that, this movie is a pure delight!  Decidedly, Elizabeth Bennet is the most well rounded character in English liturature! Keira Knightly does her justice although I think with plenty of help from Max Factor!   <br />If you have never read Pride and Prejudice, do so!  It is a must!  Then buy the movie and enjoy the breathtakingly beautiful escape it is!  The love story, the scenery, the wonderful characters! Mr. Collins is so utterly annoying you can't help but feel for Lizzy's dear friend, Charlotte for marrying such a self-important baffoon. <br /> <br />
B00005RIKI|5.0|People have been buzzing about Lynyrd Skynyrd's music for years...The group's legend has been flying high since that fatal plane crash in 1977.  The band has a mystique about it and it all began with \\"Pronounced\\"...The guitar work has quite a sting to it and the melodies like \\"Tuesday's Gone\\" and \\"Simple Man\\" are like honey...\\"Free Bird\\" is like a flower's pollen: fragrant and lasting...
B0000047CX|5.0|One of my favorite CD's.  I can listen to it repeatedly without complaint as I love Astrud's voice and style.
B000E0OBK6|5.0|Who would think that little old feminine me would watch war movies....well, one thing I am, thanks to being a genealogist and having studied the behaviors of my ancestors, is patriotic. My husband is very patriotic as well...and I suppose maybe that is a 1940's mentality rare to find among 30-something's in this day and age. We rented this movie and I have to say that the acting was great, the characters were believeable, and it was an eye-opener into the emotions of those fighting overseas. While I lay on the bed with a fan blowing on me, post-dinner, someone is laying in a sand hole right now to preserve what our country stands for. I have a newfound respect for Jamie Fox - I have always loved his humor, and loved him in \\"Collateral\\" but with this film and his portrayal of Ray Charles in \\"Ray\\" he has truly shown how he has come into maturity as an actor. How anyone could not like this film...I would tend to think they must be so opposed to the war going on now that they are pre-biased. Two thumbs up! Will definitely look for the Collector's Edition.
B0002OERI0|1.0|This cd is complete and utter garbage.  If you enjoyed listening to  old Greenday then do not go out and buy this cd.  Greenday makes music for 11-14 year old boys and girls.  They are over political and come off goofy.  One of their Singles \\"Wake Me Up When September Ends\\" is supposed to be about Billy Joe's father dying.  When they released the music video for this song, they somehow made the video seem to be about the war?  WTF?  this cd is trash and you probably shouldn't buy it, enless you are a 13 year girl who is just starting her period.
B00005JOFQ|4.0|I have not watched this picture but I heard good reviews about it. I am looking forward to watching it.

B000028U0Y|5.0|I have always admired Mr. Cash's music, loved to hear people sing it at  bars I have gone to during Kareoke sessions. He is a Legend in my book. I recently viewed the movie, \\" Walk the line\\". I loved this film so much because it brought out everything I never knew about this great man and musician. While on Amazon, I purchased, \\" At Folsom Prison\\". I would say that this CD be a MUST for all fans of Johnny because it really brings out all of the charisma of the man as well as his loyalty to his fans at the prison. I would suggest this CD to all... It is truly one of my new favorites!!!
B000F1IQNM|5.0|this is a very good movie about a nanny who comes to take care of 6 extremely bad children.  she gets the children to do as they are told.  this movie is great for all ages.
B00004ZAV3|5.0|A greatest hits by any other name, but with a title only Elvis Presley could share, the 27-track 1 delivers what it promises: all the Beatles' British and American number one singles, from Love Me Do (one American week on its belated release there in 1964, but still 1's opening track) to The Long and Winding Road, which spent a fortnight on top of the American pile in 1970.  <br /> <br />That means 24 chart-toppers, plus three that made up double A-sides. This also means no Strawberry Fields Forever, a British number two that was relegated to Penny Lane's B-side as it climbed the Stateside charts. By virtue of the Beatles' extraordinary American popularity, there are berths for Eight Days a Week, Yesterday, Penny Lane, Come Together and Let it Be. The Americans were slow to catch on, but they were equally reluctant to let go.  <br /> <br />1 also equates to an ersatz history of popular music. Of course, this music is mostly wonderful, if over-familiar, but its qualities cannot prevent 1 from being a cynical exercise. We learn nothing new, except that the Beatles both trailblazed musically and established the career template for successful pop groups. Bumbling beginnings (From Me to You is sub-Searchers); hitherto undetectable blossoming (Help! and Eleanor Rigby seem to be the work of a different band entirely); a slide into self-indulgence (not even hindsight can help The Ballad of John and Yoko); the final disintegration - these would be mirrored by almost every subsequent major band. Few, however, would take just eight years to complete their journey, and fewer still would resist the temptation to re-form.  <br /> <br />While preferable to unearthing yet more inferior Anthology-style offcuts, 1 remains unnecessary. They were a great singles band, but they were also the first band to understand albums. Their golden period was not just Help!, Eleanor Rigby and Lady Madonna, it was In My Life, Tomorrow Never Knows and Back in the USSR, too. Not that you'd know it from 1, a bowdlerisation that fails to understand the Beatles' legacy.  <br /> <br />All of the proper Beatles albums are still available for purchase and all, after Beatles for Sale, tell a more rewarding tale than 1. For completists, the \\"red\\" 1962-1966 and \\"blue\\" 1967-1970 collections may be skimpy individually, but jointly they are Anna Karenina in comparison to the Jeffrey Archer-esque 1.  <br /> <br />Surely the Beatles are a barrel that should not have to be scraped. Treat yourself: buy Revolver or The Beatles (aka the \\"white\\" album) instead.  <br /> <br />
B000FS9FC6|5.0|And I used to take AP Film, so I've seen them all. This movie has it all as well: breathtaking shots, touching dialogue, extraordinary musical score. It reminded me of Phantom of the Opera and 1984.  <br /> <br />Evey Hammond: I don't want you to die.  <br />V: That's the most beautiful thing you could have ever given me.
0739313126|5.0|The story is all around awesome, but the audio reader is what made it such an incredible piece. He had a voice that fit the character and also fluctuated with tones and perfect accents to fit all the other characters. I listened to it on my commute to and from work- I was a better driver because I went slow to hear as much as possible. The only dissappointment was that a couple of the discs were scratched and skipped sometimes. That is what I get for buying used! I suggest listening to a different type of book between 'Davinci Code' and 'Angels and Deamons.' They carry an idea similar to the 'Indiana Jones' series, but the readers are completely different people with completely different styles, which messed up the image in my head for a few chapters.
B000001DZQ|5.0|If you haven't heard of Roy Buchanan, you will be glad you did.  This is the one album to get.  In my top 10 of all time for sure.
B000AYEL1A|1.0|This movie is terrible.  It is one of the most poorly directed films ever made.  It looks as if it had been directed by a high school student.  Oh no, here comes a closeup on Barbra I bet.  Sure enough, there's the closeup on Barbra.  The directing is embarrassingly horrid.  This trash gives chick flicks a bad name.
B000AP04L0|5.0|Week one: I found myself laughing hysterically at poor old Peter Gibbons in his unbelievably boring and sad little job complete with awful boss and brainless collegues.    Week two: I found myself doing exactly the same job, same boss, same dull cubicaliens.     Weeks three to five: At my whit's end wondering how my life went so wrong so quickly.     Week six: Took matters into my own hands and started pulling a 'Gibbons' - lazing around, web surfing, turning up late, not turning up at all etc.    Week seven: Fired. Unfortunately no Hollywood ending for me.    That was the last job I had. I now work for myself and watch Office Space to keep myself motivated. Watch and learn my friends.
B000006Y5L|5.0|Reviewers have taken at face value that name of the album and the name of some of its tracks perhaps a bit too much to heart. Yes, this is the darkest of the DM albums. But, Pornography it is not. Closer it is not. It's more a romantic album than a dark album. Even Fly on the Windscreen with lyrics like \\"there are lambs for the slaughter\\" feels more romantic than the alienation of Joy Division's Closer or the schizophrenia of the Cure's Pornography.
0060751967|4.0|Honestly I didn't know what to expect since this writer was new to me and I simply thought, \\"Oh another vampire, eternally walking the earth searching for a soul mate book.\\"  It was and was not.  The was not part comes from the sheer hilarity of the book.  I found myself chuckling in many parts and once I put down the book, new I needed to read the next book in the series!
B00007BH3Y|5.0|The Hours is a very good film, but the music is so good that it makes the film seem more extraordinary than it actually is. I saw it at a theatre and, as is usually the case, it was much more impressive than when seen at home. Those who have the soundtrack will notice that the music in the film is significantly different in some places; the songs are the same, but they have different effects, like glockenspeil. <br /> <br />The only thing that would make this music better is if some of it would have a slower progression of ideas in the tracks. This issue is particularly apparent in the Solaris soundtrack (by Cliff Martinez), and less of a problem with this one. I've heard some Glass that I absolutely detest (Music in Twelve Parts) because it's so repetative and tacky. The music here is nothing like that. As another reviewer said, it's warm and the tempos are smooth, not forced.
B000ASDFJU|3.0|I followed this show when it aired on HBO and I just had to get my hands on the entire collection. I Love it, I love it. It is funny, sad, entertaining and just plain fun!!. I just had a problem with a couple of DVDs that would not work properly but I think I'm just going to skip those chapters. <br /> <br />Happy with SEX and The City
B0002W18MU|5.0|Mr. Cash was a man of few words, so I'll try to be succinct here.  \\"American V: A Hundred Highways\\" may just be the best of his American Recordings work.  As others have noted, Johnny Cash balances poignancy with power and he views death, not with fear, but with a view toward new life.<br /><br />He wrote two of the CD's best songs, \\"Now I Believe\\" and \\"Like the 309,\\" which are both deeply personal and heartfelt.  He also does great interpretations of classic songs like \\"If You Could Read My Mind\\" and \\"A Legend in My Time,\\" which take on added meaning in the context of his singing.  I have all of his American Recordings, and many other albums of Johnny and June Carter Cash.  I know...Johnny Cash is not typically \\"chick music.\\"  But there's something real and absolutely genuine about this man in black that I find completely captivating.  Seldom before has such strength been clothed in such brokenness.<br /><br />This CD reflects all that was Johnny Cash, which makes it totally essential for any serious music fan.
B00006DEFA|3.0|Amadeus is a terrific movie but the Director's cut isn't worth the additional cost. Lengthy scenes of operatic performaces have been added, offering little to further the storyline. Unless you're a true opera fan, stick with the original version and save yourself a few bucks.
B000000H3W|5.0|In 1991, Sepultura released their fourth full-length album \\"Arise\\". This album was their third best just behind \\"Chaos A.D.\\" and \\"Beneath the Remains\\". This album marked a change in Max's voice. From the Tom Araya style vocals in their first three albums to the death metal growling that's present on this album and on \\"Chaos A.D.\\" and \\"Roots\\". The drums on this album by Igor Cavalera are awesome. Igor has to be one of the most underrated drummers in metal! Andreas Kisser although he has done better on other Sepultura albums still does a good job on here handling the solos. My favorite song on this album is \\"Desperate Cry\\". Other highlights are the title track, \\"Dead Embryonic Cells\\", and \\"Altered State\\". Don't forget to get all of Sepultura's studio albums from \\"Morbid Visions\\" to \\"Chaos AD\\". And once again avoid all of that Derrick Green, \\"Roots\\" and Soulfly cr a p!
B00009Y3L4|5.0|I hadn't seen this film since it came out decades ago. It's as fresh as ever. Who, seeing this Cabaret, wouldn't want to attend performances every night! Loved it! <br />JJP
B000002JPA|5.0|Dream Theater have to be one of the most progressive and talented metal bands ever! Before Opeth, this was the metal band with the longest song lengths.<br /><br />First of all to that fu c k \\"chingy's #1 fan!!!!!!!!!\\" you should shut your as s up! You like cr a p like Chingy and 50 Cent and hate awesome bands like Dream Theater and Led Zeppelin. Go get some brain surgery and lay off the MTV!<br /><br />Now on to the album. This is Dream Theater's first album with vocalist James LaBrie who is an excellent vocalist who sounds quite similar to Queensryche's Geoff Tate. John Petrucci is one of the most underrated guitarists ever! He's a classically trained guitarist but his solos are breathtaking. My other favorite member is keyboardist Kevin Moore who almost gives this band a European flavour even these guys are American. \\"Pull Me Under\\" is the album's most \\"popular\\" song but it wasn't really mainstream which is cool. My favorite song has to be the 11-minute epic \\"Learning to Live\\". Other standouts are \\"Pull Me Under\\", \\"Metropolis, Pt. 1\\", and \\"Take the Time\\".<br /><br />So you should definatly buy this amazing and progressive album. Ignore idiots like \\"chingy's #1 fan!!!!!!!!\\" or \\"Luci\\" who hates this but likes cr a p like Puddle of Mudd, Good Charlotte, and Evanescence.
B00000K0T8|5.0|With this album, Ghostface's blossoming into one of the best Wu rappers was completed. He was a minor presence on \\"Enter the 36 Chambers\\", but with his sidekick performance on Raekwon's \\"Only Built 4 Cuban Linx...\\" his flower cracked, and blossomed fully on his first solo album. In time he has become the most visible (and let's face it, relevant) member of the Wu, and this album is the genesis of that stardom. His raps, and the support he gets from his Wu-Tang gangmates are as sharp as they got in this time era. He shows off his versatility on this album, which was produced by the inestimable RZA. Ironman - and its numerous Al Green samples - is seen as the bridge to the Wu-Tang's sound after 1997: cinematic and often soul-infused. For me, this is also the final brick in the Wu-Tang's solid gold wall of rap creativity and envelope-pushing, three years and five albums of genius rap. Every collection needs this!
B0000028M7|5.0|Grunge was a good but not great genre. I liked Soundgarden, Stone Temple Pilots, Pearl Jam, and even Foo Fighters but not so much that it goes into my top 10 list. I didn't like Nirvana at all and thought they were extremely overrated. However there's one grunge band that I really liked. It was Alice in Chains...<br /><br />This piece of art is classified as grunge but as the editorial review states it does sound a lot like Queensryche thus making it half grunge and half progressive metal. Layne Stanley(RIP) is one of the best vocalists ever! He sings with a ton of passion and he isn't annoying like Kurt Cobain of other pu s s ys like Jonathan Davis. Guitarist Jerry Cantrell although not my favorite member(that honour goes to Layne) is a very good guitarist. My favorite song is \\"Rooster\\". It's very emotional and has an amazing video that wasn't severly overplayed like Nirvana's cr a p. So just buy this album now and listen to the best of grunge, NOT NIRVANA!!!<br /><br />RIP Layne Stanley :'(
B000000OUJ|5.0|By 1995, the RZA's five-year plan for the Wu-Tang Clan to take over hip-hop was surely well in motion. While their albums were hardly the blockbusters they deserved to be, their quality was unimpeachable. From the group effort \\"Enter the 36 Chambers\\" to Ghostface's \\"Ironman\\", was three years of unparalleled excellence from all involved parties, but especially producer mastermind RZA. Teaming up with his cousin Genius/GZA, they created \\"Liquid Swords\\", one of the eeriest, most cohesive and just plain ridiculously amazing rap albums ever made. Simply put, this belongs in the top five of the best hip-hop albums. <br /> <br />The first listen will probably be the hardest, as it is so anti-thetical to any sound rap has produced - excepting the Wu, and even then it's a stretch. Lasting only about 55 minutes, it is simply without any filler: the extensive kung-fu samples from \\"Shaolin Assassin\\" add to the thematic unity of the album and increase the doom. The real stars of this album are the RZA and the GZA, two artists firing on all cylinders: the RZA's production has never been dense and expressive, while the GZA is the real \\"razor sharp\\" rapper here. Listening to El-P's production on his own and Cannibal Ox's albums, you can completely hear RZA's production work from this album being paid homage to. This is the highpoint of the Wu-Tang's golden reign from 93-96. A RAP CLASSIC, JUST GET IT NOW!
B000F3AAUW|2.0|Pretty much all the songs on this album attracted me at first because of their catchy beat, but after actually listening to the songs a couple times I just became fairly annoyed and then aggravated to hear these songs. If I never hear Crazy again on the radio, you won't catch me shedding any tears.
B00004SC3M|3.0|Zeta-Jones is not lousy, she's gorgeous; although he was born in 1930, Connery still has clout. Otherwise, I tend to agree with those reviewers who found faults with this caper. It is oddly uneven: parts of it are not bad at all. The scenery is splendid. The technology is well above my head. Some of the action is quite exciting. Totally implausible, anything is possible,  particularly as it draws on almost every other suspense heist ever made. Some parts drag, others seem unnecessary. The whole thing doesn't gel, and in the end it's all too complicated to understand. Moreover, after all the strenuous work that Connery puts in, in the final scene he definitely looks as if he's had enough, and is just looking to put his feet up, and perhaps take a wee dram before hitting the sack. I wouldn't call Sean an introspective actor. He gets on with the job, and always turns in a reliable performance, but the only part which fitted him like a glove, and which he seemed truly to have enjoyed, was the role he played in The Man who would be King. Still, I did keep wondering what was going to happen next.
B00005JMCW|3.0|Having been a lifelong fan of Mary Rodgers' classic novel \\"Freaky Friday,\\" as well as the Disney version from 1976 that let Jodie Foster and Barbara Harris play superego and id respectively, I approached this remake with a mixture of curiosity and apprehension.  Though much of Rodgers' novel is again (needlessly) reworked and cast aside, this remake has a flat-out scrumptious bonbon wrapped up in the recycled packaging: Jamie Lee Curtis.  If the 1976 version gave the edge to Foster's crisp, no-nonsense adult-in-a-teenager's body, this version lets Curtis as the teenager-in-the-adult loose on the park swings, and she doesn't stop until she's conquered the entire playground.  (As the daughter/mother, the adorable Lindsay Lohan mostly plays an adult via a bright, hyper-competent smile and careful elocution, though her punk-pop singing is joyfully  effective.)  Supporting actors like Harold Gould and Mark Harmon are mostly furniture (Harmon looks like you could dust him).  It's Curtis, with her vulpine smile and sexy swagger as she racks up the charge card, who inspires giggle fits of happiness, and when she and her daughter's boyfriend (Chad Michael Murray) breathlessly discuss bands they love in a coffee shop, it's pure, mooney bliss.  Great art it isn't, but it sure is fun, especially for tweeners and their ex-90's-riot grrllll moms.
B0002W18MU|2.0|A very sad album.  Johnny`s voice sounds weak and like it`s cracking and wavering.   Almost every song is about dying.  Listening to it depressed me.  It is a very raw album, with a lot of emotion in it.
B0000028RR|1.0|Ah, Rage Against The Machine, the foundres of rap metal. If ever there was a title which should never be celebrated, this makes for a strong contender. Here, my friends, is the album which, along with Korn's debut, is virtually solely resposible for the total mangling of metal during the 1990s. Yep, you heard me. \\"Rage Against The Machine\\" is ABYSMAL.<br /><br />The music Rage Against The Machine have to offer on their debut is crude beyond belief. Guitar and bass playing mostly consists of ugly, amelodic, childishly simplistic riffs churned out in maddeningly repetitive rhythms. These are so utterly unmemorable, so unimaginative, so utterly devoid of anything whatsoever which makes music worth listening to that I can't help but wonder who the hell is buying this? Almost to add insult to injury, sometimes at the start of a song we'll hear a slightly touching melody or a riff with a trace of passion, only for it to be utterly obliterated after about ten seconds by more banal slop, lacking any momentum. Honestly, after 52 minutes of this I wanted to end my misery and make the song \\"Bullet In The Head\\" a reality. It isn't even the lack of technicality that kills this album - one of my favourite albums is Bathory's \\"Hammerheart,\\" one of the least technical albums ever written. The long and the short of it is this: the riffs on \\"Rage Against The Machine\\" are just simply badly written. Hell, they're just BAD, period.<br /><br />It doesn't help that RATM fail to think outside the box in the songwriting department either. Indeed, the traditional verse/chorus cycle is not deviated from in the slightest. The upper limit of the intricacy demonstrated is when the guitar and the bass begin trading lines... that's it. The fact that the likes of this is hailed as genius by so many I find to be a blatant insult towards bans who try to make at least some of their songs original and interesting. Even Poison The Well, who I attributed as incompetant songwriters in a previous review, at least TRY to integrate something different into their song structures once in a while.<br /><br />Let's talk about speed, shall we? Oh, wait what's that again? I seem to have forgotten after listening to 10 tracks of mid-tempo, energy-derived crap. This can be largely put down to the fact that the drummer (seemingly solely reliant on the bass and snare drums and a single crash cymbal - I repeat: unimaginative) never varies from simplistic eighth-note rhythms, the double bass peddle nowhere to be seen. The fact that the guitar work seldom ventures into up tempo regions, let alone shredding, isn't exactly much consolation. \\"Rage Against The Machine\\" is cited by so many to be a passionate and furious album. I, on the other hand, had to stick on \\"Death Is Certain (Life Is Not)\\" by Dark Angel after three tracks, simply to remind myself what a true musical expression of passion and fury sounds like lest this stuff leech my soul out through my ears.<br /><br />And then we come to the vocals. Zack Delarocha, on this album, prooves definitively that rapping is an abomination and should be banned from the face of the Earth. The last thing this already appalling composition requires is his incessant whining over the top. No, it gets worse; incessant whining WHICH DOESN'T EVEN SYNCHRONISE WITH THE MUSIC. When it gets to his screaming parts, I can't help but notice his voice sits ludicrously high in the mix; probably a failed attempt to disguise the fact that he sounds prepubescant. Christ, once or twice we're even treated to hearing his voice crack!<br /><br />The only - and I mean ONLY - redeeming feature of this album is Tom Morello's solos. While these break no new ground, contrary to what the fans may have us believe, they are in keeping with the tone of the music, satisfyingly technical and even - god forbid! - pleasant to listen to. We can only be thankful that now he's with Audioslave, a band who are at least half-decent and where his talent can find fertile soil.<br /><br />However, not even Morello's skill can save this monstrosity. To all of Rage Against The Machine's, I beg you; there is a whole world of passionate, well written, innovative music out there which does more than just sloppily tack two or three other styles together, throw in some angry lyrics and call itself revolutionary. As Delarocha is heard to claim on the track \\"Fistful Of Steel,\\" \\"Sometimes silence makes me sick.\\" My only answer to that is; \\"What a pity.\\"soil. <br /> <br />However, not even Morello's skill can save this monstrosity.

B00005BJ9W|5.0|This is like manna from heaven!  Most artists' fanbases would be drooling over the ORIGINAL LP being reissued, complete with original mix.  I can't understand the negative reviews.  Yeah, it's not the old US version - but this is in my mind what the band themselves originally wanted us to hear.  It's incredible and parts sound like a different album.  \\"Hold Back the Rain\\" has always been my fave on this LP since I was 12 when it came out.  I love this mix so much better and am really enjoying this.
B000EHRVP6|2.0|Three young men travel by train to Eastern Europe, Slowakia if I recall well, and are kidnapped from the hostel they're staying. When they awake they find themselves tied down to a chair facing a sadistic maniak who is in a surgery mood. Sofar  the film is looking good, but then the director finds it necessary to show all torture scenes in the most explicit way  he can think of. If you are really into sadistic violence you will enjoy all kinds of body parts getting chopped of, but if you are not, you may also think that the director should have left a little bit more to the viewer's imagination.   Still the movie has a few strong moments....it is a shame the movie is kind of missing its balance. If Quentin Tarantino was truly connected to this movie, he would have noticed this as well. (SARR)

0767817486|5.0|As I think back over the decades, there have been a fair number of memorable films that I originally saw in the theatres and which have endured as favorites on DVD. Films like ONCE UPON A TIME IN THE WEST, DRESSED TO KILL, ALIENS, THE STUNT MAN, THELMA & LOUISE, and THE ABYSS.     But for every decade, I can identify one theatrical release that hit me like a freight train, and which in my mind has become a cinematic monument. In the 1960s, it was BONNIE & CLYDE. In the 1980s, it was BETTY BLUE (37'2 LE MATIN). In the 1990s, it was BASIC INSTINCT. And so far in the current decade, I would give the honor to CHICAGO. I skipped the 1970s, but you know which film it was: MIDNIGHT EXPRESS.     I have read the reviews, and a good many of them deal with political issues, and whether the film is faithful to the facts. But just as I don't judge, say, Madonna's music based on my views of the singer as a human being, or whether the lyrics she writes are expressions of honesty, I don't judge films based on anything beyond what is actually produced on celluloid.     Various reviewers have praised the gritty cinematography, the Oscar-caliber acting, the riveting storyline, the Moroder score, and other aspects of this film. I cannot agree more. To my mind, a masterpiece is born when every element of the filmmaker's art converges perfectly to create a rare cinematic experience. This is the case for MIDNIGHT EXPRESS. When I walked out of the theater on my first viewing, I was shaken to the bone. The impact has since been diluted somewhat due to repeated viewings on VHS and on DVD, but my opinion of the film has not changed one iota. For me, MIDNIGHT EXPRESS is still the number one cinematic masterpiece of the 1970s. This is a very personal appreciation, but I'm sure that any serious film student who is able to objectively analyze the film within the exclusive context of cinematic art would have to conclude that MIDNIGHT EXPRESS is a true masterpiece.     When it comes to purchasing afilm for viewing, there are any number of criteria: the artistic achievement of the film (e.g., MOULIN ROUGE), the extent to which the story is compelling (e.g., JAWS), how well the story is told (e.g., CLUELESS), and the psychological impact the film will have on the viewer (e.g., THE EXORCIST). Notice how the cited examples (I chose some obvious ones) arguably only satisfy one or two of these specific criteria.    Films that thoroughly satisfy are BONNE & CLYDE, MIDNIGHT EXPRESS, BETTY BLUE, BASIC INSTINCT, and CHICAGO, and they all achieve masterpiece status in my pantheon. Not that others don't (e.g., MY FAIR LADY). But these are the films, one per decade, that I've placed highest on my altar.     I highly recommend this film to the objective viewer. You may or may not agree with my qualifying MIDNIGHT EXPRESS as a rare cinematic masterpiece, but you will never forget the raw emotional experience of it (personally, I've always found it more uplifting than depressing). In fact, in every way that a film can, this one will haunt you for life.
B000FMGTTE|5.0|Since the storyline of Superman Returns is set 5 years after the events in Superman the Movie and Superman II (Richard Donner was supposed to helm both films), the score reflecting the themes from the first film (Main Title, Planet Krypton, Leaving Smallville, and Love Theme from Superman) was appropriate.  The themes were orchestrated extremely well, in contrast to the hack job that Ken Thorne did for budget tightwad producers the Salkinds and director Richard Lester on Superman II.  Compare that garbage soundtrack to the job Ottman did, and you'll have a better appreciation of Superman Returns.

B000EHSVQE|1.0|Nothing happens in this movie. Nothing. All of the 'humor' involves characters stereotyped to the point of hyperbolic. It's marginally racist too. The Mexicans are thugs in a lowrider and the one black person is all 'ghetto booty' and is just there to teach the lame white boy how to be cool. <br /> <br />\\"Duurrrrr your mom goes to college!\\" <br /> <br />Thank God the constant quotation of this thing in the past. <br /> <br />If you want 'loser' comedy then Beavis and Butthead is so much better. So is Daria.
B000F0UV0E|3.0|As a devout fan of Mark Knopfler, it's hard for me to be too disappointed any time new product appears in the market.  Admittedly, this joint effort with Emmylou Harris doesn't approach some of the notable heights he attained with Dire Straits (e.g., \\"Brothers in Arms\\") or flying solo (e.g., \\"Sailing to Philadelphia\\"), but I always welcome some new guitar mastery as performed by Mr. Knopfler.  The old saying I've heard applied to sex might work for my assessment of less than the best efforts by Mark: \\"When it's good, it's great; and when it's bad, it's still pretty darn good.\\"  \\"All the Roadrunning\\" is pretty darn good.
0446608955|4.0|Please note my rating is really a 4.5 but that is not an option.  Nicholas Sparks is a gifted writer who has a spark (pun intended) for making the reader feel the emotions of the characters.  In this story you meet Landon and Jamie who are an unlikely pair that fall for each other over the course of a few months.  Jamie teaches Landon the meaning of love and makes him a better person as a result. This book will make you laugh and cry.  I have never watched the movie so I did not have that to compare it to this is a good book.  Just be sure to have plenty of tissue near by to dry your eyes.
B000G7PNAE|4.0|This is a reissue of the 1996 remastered edition along with the 4 bonus tracks.  I bought this hoping that it had been newly remastered, but the sound is identical to the 1996 cd.  \\"The Essential Journey\\" from 2001 is louder and has a better mix (as in you can hear the instruments better and clearer) than this 2006 cd.  The live tracks on this cd can all be gotten on the 2006 \\"Live in Houston\\" cd and the sound on that cd is better, clearer, and louder than on this reissue cd (\\"Reissue\\" is written on this cd wrapper not \\"remaster\\").  I'm a bit of a fiend for remasters and I did play them \\"side by side\\" and can hear no difference from the 1996 to the 2006.  The only true new thing on here is \\"La Raza Del Sol\\". <br /> <br />So this is great if all you've got is the original cd release, but do realize that this is not a 2nd remaster.  Get the \\"Essential\\" disc if you want that; it's the closest there is and it does sound better than the 1st edition remasters.  Of course, not all the songs are on there that I'm sure you want.  I'd like to see all their albums remastered like the \\"Essential\\" is.  But oh well, it's not here.
B000E1YVZU|1.0|* Firstly , I'd like to state for the record, that I originally rated this item , 3 stars. Once I finished my review , I noticed that it was rated a 1 star. Unfortunately I couldn't change it. Now , for my review.Considering the great \\" bumps\\" in the road , about filming a broadway play ( especially a musical ), I think Chris Columbus's film production of \\" Rent\\", is a remarkable achievement. From translating the meduim to film , and editing what should stay in and out of the finalized product , is pure genius. Is there a cionsiderable difference in the play and the film ....YES. Will there be any missing momentum and energy lost in the play's transition from stage to film ?......YES. However , \\"Rent\\" , as a film , stands on it's own merits and highlights enough of the characters and storyline , to give you the jist of the phenominal play. You'll never get out of a film , what you get out of a play. Never ! However , much like the fantastic musicals such as \\" Fame , Grease , Hair , and Little Shop of Horrors \\" , the success ,of this \\"transferring of mediums\\" is dependent upon teh storyteller ( aka: the director). Chris Columbus does a fantastic job. Enough of my technical talk. The story itself , is a mezmerizing and unforgettable journey into the lives of several friends caught up in the bohemian lifestyle.  The story takes place in 1980's NY , and thusly the problems such as poverty , homelessness , drug use , and AIDS, play a huge factor. Ironically , the plot hasn't aged muich , because we're still living in that era. The only difference is that some of us are older and wiser. However , the problems still plaugue our society and this film does brilliantly at highlighting these issues. The film features phenominal performances , musical numbers , editing , directing , and cinematography. There is also a bonus dvd , that takes us to the humble ( to say the least ) beginnings, of the development of \\" Rent\\". This bonus dvd , is well worth the purchase price. Another mentionable and commendable aspect of \\" Rent' , is that it features the majority of the original broadway cast. After viewing the bonus dvd , it is impossible to cast the film any other way. The actors burst back into their characters , like a teenager rides a bike. They simply perform better than anyone else ever could. Plain and simple , this movie is tight. I highly recommend it , even if you don't like musicals. I believe that you will find yourself watching it again and again and even humming some of the songs. Whereas , \\" Rent \\",  might not be the best musical I've ever seen, it certainly is one that I will never forget. Where it lacks in song originality , it makes up for , in script. Where is lacks in acting , it makes up for , in character development. Just open your mind and your heart and measure your life in Love.mentionable and commendable aspect of \\" Rent' , is that it features the majority of the original broadway cast.

B000FS9FCQ|5.0|Is this movie exactly the same as the graphic novel?  No.  Is this a good movie?  Absolutely.  The adaptation makes a few changes, especially in the final third or so of the story.  Some of the changes are good, some are bad, but for the most part, this is an outstanding movie that manages to be faithful to the source material while still forging its own path.  The emotional lynchpin of the story remains intact, and that alone is enough to have me recommend it to anyone who likes good, well-told stories.  I confess, while I am a fan of several of Alan Moore's works, I don't hold the man in the same high regard that he holds himself.  With that said, I would have been proud to have my name on this movie, whether or not it was word for word my story.  Very highly recommended.
B000EULJLU|5.0|I was waiting patiently in anticipation for this new album to come out, and, of course, purchased it on the first day it came out (for cheap, too).  The art was totally sweet, and the packaging was icing on the cake to an album yet to be experienced.  When I got home, I plugged it in and listened to it from start to finish, and loved every moment of it. <br /> <br />this album has a fresh sound to it.  It has a whole new attitude from the band.  Undertow was angry, Aenima was dark and mysterious, Lateralus was all about reconcilliation (sp?), and 10,000 days was \\"Surprise!  5 long years of waiting and you get a musical experience like none other!\\" or something like that... <br /> <br />I loved the lyrics (they weren't throwaway or boring, as some of you say), the guitar was in your face (ACTUAL kickin' solos for Adam...that's a first), the riffs were great, the bass was thicker than God, Danny was exploding out rythms like an octopus, and Maynard's voice was matching the mood of each song perfectly. <br /> <br />I don't think that this is a continuation of Lateralus, nor do I think that this is a lazy album.  I don't think that criticism like that should come from people who have never tried writing songs like that (which, haha, I do constantly and could never achieve things like 10,000 days).  That's the beauty of Tool: you can never see just where they are coming from until they do another interview that only a few people will ever see with their spare time on YouTube.  Then you can go \\"oh, okay, that's why \\"The Pot\\" is so angry\\" or \\"That's what Jambi means\\" or whatever.  You really can't assume that they just sat there for five years and boom! the music industry has all their songs made for them (who do you think they are, Simple Plan?  Any emo band in that case?) <br /> <br />For all of those who just think this is filler or that this isn't tool:  I'm laughing to myself subtly because YOU JUST DON'T GET TOOL AND YOU AREN'T A REAL TOOL FAN.  You're just jealous at the rest of us for being able to UNDERSTAND the album.  Haha!  There I go again. <br /> <br />Overall, a great album, dissatisfied fans aside (and by aside I mean in the room with \\"I'm too inept to understand great art and I try to act like I know what I'm talking about to get some sort of uproar from the real fans\\" written on the door), I love it.
B000683VI4|5.0|This movie really makes you appreciate what true love is and how it enters our lives no matter how long it is for. When true love exists it is so clear as to what the difference is between this special bond vs. the emotion of love, which we can feel for our brother our sister or a good friend. If anyone can have this feeling for a lifetime then they are the luckiest person on earth. I have experienced it for 9 months and I can't explain it, it is just a great feeling the best in the world. It doesn't seem that it will work out but at least I have had the chance to experience it.

B0000C23DO|4.0|I've never been a \\"Dead Head\\". Had no desire to see them in concert and never bought an album...until now. I was listening to the \\"Classic Rock\\" radio station when \\"Ripple\\" came on. I was humming it to myself thinking, \\" What a great tune this is\\". I logged on to my favorite on-line music source and checked out the selections and decided that it's time to chuck my attitude. Sure it's entertaining to make fun of Dead Heads, but This is a band that was an instrumental part of the sixties and not to be overlooked. I was amazed at how much I enjoyed hearing all those cherries, aside from \\"Touch Of Gray\\" I like every song on the disc. I think this is the must-have choice for anyone who's NOT a Dead-Head, but still likes their tunes.

0802130208|5.0|This book is farce. You are not supposed to identify with the main character, Ignatius. He is a despicable, foolish person. <br /> <br />The few readers I know that didn't like or understand the book, had trouble with this concept. I heard, \\"I just hated that Ignatius\\" or \\"I don't get it.\\" <br /> <br />Ignatius is delusional, and his twisted view of the world gets him into a lot of trouble. Think of Voltaire's Candide. Though Candide's problem was optimism....Ignatius' is something darker,  more outlandish. <br /> <br />A wonderful read. I've read it many times, and it never fails to make me laugh.
B000BW7QWW|4.0|having never seen an episode of Firefly, I wasn't quite sure what to expect.  Since I am a fan of sci-fi, I was thinking that it would probably be a run-of-the-mill, mediocre film, showcasing everything that's already been done.  I was pleasantly surprised and must now rent the series!  What was I thinking not watching the series??!! <br /> <br />Okay, the plot is a little over-the-top, but that's exactly what I enjoyed the most.  That coupled with the \\"space-cowboy\\" theme, throw in a little comedy and a tear-jerker moment - mix it all up and voila --- Serenity.   <br /> <br />Fun movie, completely entertaining!

1400062756|5.0|Dweck creates a fascinating and clean distinction in mindsets: fixed and growth oriented. For a fixed mind person, external feedback is very important, validating or invalidating the person. For a growth mind person, the feeling on one's effort is what matters. The result is less important than the effort.<br /><br />Fixed minded people look for things that make them feel secure, powerful, superior, unbeatable.<br /><br />Growth minded people look for things where they are not safe, secure, where they feel uncertain about the outcome and risk failing because of the learning it provides them. They welcome questioning, criticism, and separate it from their value as individuals.<br /><br />If you believe that your life is built around your journey, and that your learning is more important than your end results, you allow yourself to enjoy a walk, hold someone hands, sing out loud in the shower, blink at a bird, and indulge yourself on a special treat.. and walk away from doing things so the others can see how wealthy or not you are.<br /><br />If you believe that you can change the way you manage your wealth learning form your mistakes and NOT feeling uneasy about your state right now, you will be empowered to move forward, without wasting one single minute in feeling sorry for yourself... and that is the first of the unwealthy habits too.<br /><br />This is one of the best books I've read.
B000FA57RG|5.0|I'm more of the neo-generation of Madonna fans. I remember her peak in around 1989-1990 (I was five) when Madonna literally hit, one of her many, zeniths with songs such as \\"Like A Prayer\\" & \\"Vogue\\". But I cognitvely began to experience her in the 1990's, with material like \\"Rain\\", \\"Take A Bow\\", & \\"Ray of Light\\".  Basically, I watched as she grew up. I mention this because there are those who may only appreciate her earlier era, & those like me who appreciate latter day Madonna, as well as early Madonna. There are those who don't get latter Madonna, so they might not enjoy this documentary as much, it depends really. If you enjoy evolution, then this is for you.<br /><br />This is a part two of sorts to the 1990 \\"Truth or Dare\\" documentary shot during her Blonde Ambition Tour. \\"I'm Going to Tell You A Secret\\" is filmed during 2004 on her Re-Invention Tour.  This originally aired (and I watched & taped it then) back in October of last year on MTV, MTV 2, & VH-1 as one of the many launch pads for her then upcoming opus, \\"Confessions On A Dancefloor\\".<br /><br />What you get her is a two-hour revelation. You see a woman who has come full circle as a human being, artist, & mother.  Madonna has grown up.  But she stills like to get down & have fun.  Some of the things I liked about this is how you got to see her dancers more & that the dancers were far more diverse that on \\"Truth or Dare\\". These people came from all walks of life & that diversity showed in their exuberant performances.  Madonna, still the mother hen, manages to be the boss, the fun lady, & cultural teacher (she takes them to Paris for a spot of culture).<br /><br />Madonna herself has clearly found something to give her a path in life: her silly, comical husband Guy Ritchie, & two adorable children Lourdes & Rocco, & faith.  So to me, I never saw her as \\"preaching\\" as someone disrespectfully stated, but rather imparting wisdom that is there to take or not to take.<br /><br />From a performance point of view, Madonna still has it.  She is one of the last pop icons we actually have, & for further proof, just watch the concert clips of \\"Vogue\\", \\"American Life\\", \\"Nobody Knows Me\\" (excellent!), or \\"Holiday\\".<br /><br />The actual editing of the documentary is done well, Jonas Ackerlund is very talented.  The performance stills are in color & the rest is black & white usually.<br /><br />This set comes with a live disc of selected material from the Re-Invention tour.  It is actually pretty good.  I enjoy how Stuart Price, such a genius, re-worked some of her classics.  The most original is the \\"Susan Macleod/Into the Groove\\" number.  He interpolates the Irish element, then mixes in the \\"Into the Hollywood Groove\\" from the GAP commercial she shot in 2003 with Missy Elliott.  \\"Vogue\\" sounds so refreshed here, like it was resurrected.<br /><br />Madonna is ever the stylist supreme.  She isn't Aretha Franklin, but the woman can sing, & sing well.  She not only holds the tune, she belts it out with a power & charismatic passion rarely seen in pop. You feel her conviction.  A last highlight, is the original edit of a cut from the \\"Confessions\\" album, \\"I Love New York\\". Though I prefer the cut that made the album, this is a great bonus for fans.<br /><br />In conclusion, buy this if you are a Madonna fan, if you aren't buy it anyway it might just make you one.  It shows one of the last epic artists of our time doing her thing.<br /><br />P.S.-Saw her at the 7/13/06 \\"Confessions Tour\\" gig in Philly, my first Madonna show.

B000AP04OM|5.0|Some may say that the Sound of Music is too \\"corny\\" or dated for current sensibilities, but it rises above with its innate goodness and the wonderful Julie Andrews. The great outdoor shots, the magical songs, the enchanting love story, all combine to provide a very satisfying cinematic experience. One of the all-time greatest films!
0307277674|3.0|Vargas Llosa, Garc&iacute;a M&aacute;rquez, Clavell and Le Carr&eacute; come to my mind as what I call quality entertainment reading, however differing those qualities are.<br /><br />Now, for a good holiday read I do prefer the level  of violence of any kind to be real low, and I value the ability to arouse a smile, or complicity understanding the characters.<br /><br />This is such a book.<br /><br />Hopefully the murders described here will be admitted among those of a literary quality not conductive to anguish.<br /><br />In this book one's attention is immediately and easily gripped, and if the tale is not on an even level throughout it still makes for a satisfiying review of some of our forgotten or never learned history and history of art lessons.<br /><br />I believe it should be noted that the author makes a careful effort to quench by  the end of his story, all motives for the uproar it's  been said The Da Vinci Code caused.
B0007GAEGC|5.0|I can't say enough about how utterly fantastic the music and the voices are on this CD. It is as if I have gone to heaven and am listening to angels. The voices of Orla Fallon and Chloe Agnew are probably the most entrancing I have ever heard. <br /> <br />The arrangements are stunningly effective to showcase these amazingly talented singers. It is impossible to find a flawed performance on any of the songs. Get this CD, you will not regret it!
B000FFJYCU|5.0|For years, fans of the movie Grand Prix have been clamoring for it to be released on DVD. With that said, I will spare the formalities of reviewing the movie and get down to brass tacks - Was the DVD worth the wait? <br /> <br />The Good/Great: First of all the film looks and sounds great - comparing it to the VHS version doesn't give it enough justice. The transfer is stellar. In addition, the bonus documentaries provide a keen insight into Frankenheimer's desire to direct it, behind the scenes details, and cars and drivers of the era. To me, these features alone make the disk a must buy. <br /> <br />The Not So Good, or perhaps just a bit annoying: This DVD comes packaged on two disks. But be advised - it's not a deal where the movie is on one disk and the specials are on another. No. The movie itself is played out utilizing both disks. This means that at some point, you'll have to get up and switch disks in order to watch the entire film. For those familiar with the VHS version of the movie, the break occurs at the same intermission point, before the final race at Monza. While this may be a small annoyance, it would have been nice for the movie to be contained on one disk and the added features on the other. And for what its worth, its something that isn't pointed out in the product specs.  <br /> <br />The Bottom Line: Fans of Grand Prix and movies of this genre will have a blast experiencing it on DVD. Crank up the volume! <br />

B00029QXAK|5.0|Danish Director Lars Von Trier is a very unique film maker and has a very interesting view on the world. Dogville is a masterpiece that was kept under wraps until it's release. Dogville stars Nicole Kidman, in one of her best roles yet, as one of the leading characters Grace. Paul Bettany is excellent as Tom, who is an aspiring writer, who's plans are to get the towns people together to talk about the town plans. The film is told in nine chapters and is narrated by English actor John Hurt(Alien, 1984). The film was all shot in High-Definition hand held camera in a studio in Sweden. This film had been kept very secretive by Lars Von Trier and the rest of the cast and crew. Before it's release, there was no clips of the film, no pics, no plot synopsis, you would have had to actually go see the film to find out what it's actually about. Dogville was actually in competition for the prestigous Palme d'Or award for best picture at the Cannes Film Festival.<br /><br />Dogville is part one in Von Trier's USA trilogy, with Manderlay and Wasington as the follow ups. Dogville is a small town in the rocky mountains where it is filled with innocent hard working American citizens and have very forgivable problems about them. They are all viewed through Tom's eyes who is a man who enjoy's his quiet little town. Soon a young woman arrives that goes by the name of Grace, she's on the run from gangsters who she claims are after her. Tom feels he can't just give her into these gangsters and decides to hide her and give her shelter. The gangsters come by and ask the towns folk if they've seen her anywhere and tell them to contact them if they do. Tom decides to call a town meeting and introduce them to Grace, he tells them her dilema and asks them if she can work and live in the town if they don't go on to tell the gangsters. Throughout the film we see how society take advantage of blackmailing and how they take advantage of her problem and start to show betrayel and hatred.<br /><br />Dogville is stunning in every aspect. It has everything a theater and and an art-house cinema fan loves. First of all, this is Lars Von Trier, an absolute dynamite at storytelling and writing. I'm not just saying this because my dad's Danish and Von Trier is, I'm saying this because it's absolutely true. His previous stunners like Dancer In The Dark, Breaking The Waves and The Idiots are sparkling examples of why he's a genius, and this is one of them. Dogvile's uniqueness lies in the sets, acting, cinematography, and ofcourse the storytelling. The film is shot on a stage in Sweden, and has a very small production cost, the sets are very simple but effective and something that has never been done before. The buildings for example are simple lines of chalk, the doors and everything are drawn in chalk, so you can see everything that the people are doing, the characters obviously can't though. The camerawork is very much the same as Dancer In The Dark and has a very arty and independant feel to it. The acting is marvelous, it's pretty much like stage acting, they have alot of dialogue, they have detailed characters and are most certainly in character here. The musical score is very beautiful in this picture and keeps you more and more involved in the movie.<br /><br />Overall this film is nearly perfect but can't reccomend to the average movie goer/watcher. Dogville is nearly 3 hours long and has alot of dialogue, the average joe will find this boring, but the cinema fanatic who truly knows what is good and bad should have a go at this. As I said before the film is bassicly a filmed play, and will most likely not appeal to the average person, but the patient avid film fanatic should love every minute. This is truly an exhilarating experience and the finale proves to be a brilliant sign off to a truly magnificent film.<br /><br />The extra features on the region 2 disc aren't very impressive, it only has a trailer(it's actually quite good), the confessional box is a very good feature, it was a box confessional they had on the set where the actors could talk to the outside world so they didn't feel so alienated, and then there's a documentary about the film being shown at the Cannes Film Festival. Either way, you're getting the film, not the extra features. The film: 5/5, the extras: 3/5.nfessional they had on the set where the actors could talk to the outside world so they didn't feel so alienated, and then there's a documentary about the film being shown at the Cannes Film Festival.

0307120007|5.0|I am pleased with the quality and content of Pat the Bunny. It is small enough to carry along with the baby, and all the textures are very attractive to little fingers. I highly recommend this to everyone with a little person.
B00003CWN3|5.0|This is another of those movies that makes you quiet and lost in your thoughts. Its a true life story of Brandon Teena, a person with a sexual identity crises and how she tries to deal with the awkward situations that she faces. Boys Dont Cry is definitely a movie to be seen, for it addresses some rather serious issues, not by focusing on them, but by focusing on the trials and tribulations of this poor confused soul. <br />Hilary Swank has acted brilliantly, her expressions of joy, sorrow, hope, frustation, fear, excitement, confusion, shame, regret.... all these are played to near perfection, giving the character of Brandon Teena such lifelike feel, that one is amazed to \\"return-to-reality\\" when the movie ends. The movie also exposes the darker side of relationships & is an indictment on society's callous attitude and holier-than-thou hypocrisies. And it is in managing this dichotomy so well, that the movie clearly scores nad is disturbing. <br />I would be dishonest to say that frequently, my own biases came to the fore & I realized my own conditioned thinking, but then as  this story progresses, I keep feeling ashamed at my views and wonder how the many who undergo such issues deal with them & thats where the movie is disturbing : For it portrays reality with a certain stark-nakedness with ones own opinion as the canvas on which reality plays itself out. <br />This is a brilliant movie & a hard story with some screenplay & sets. Definitely worth a watch.
6304698526|5.0|Just added to my dvd collection. One of my favorite \\"guy/car\\" movies. also purchased \\" Dirty Mary, Crazy Larry\\" & Vanishing Point\\".
6305263248|5.0|So you think you've seen car chase movies? Ronin is one heck of a ride! There are mutiple aspects to the movie which make such an awesome one that can be seen again and again (but yes, please dont sit with your reality-thinking cap on, just enjoy the flick) <br />1. The cast & characters : Ronin is one of those movies which has about 8-10 key people in the movie, and is probably the only movie I have come across where every single character is etched out to near perfection and played by its actor to the hilt. Be it De Niro as the supercool ex CIA agent, Jean Reno as the frenchman, the KGB dudes... each and every one of them, even if only in a cameo - every character has enriched the movie. And in doing so, the movie softly caresses themes like male bonding without probably really intending to, but does so in a brilliant manner. <br />2. The plot : Typical of any thriller, the suspense is kept till the end. The extra features DVD shows two alternative endings, showing clearly how complex a task it must have been for the director to actually end such a high paced and good movie. From the very first scene till the end, it is a plot that will keep you glued and waiting for the next scene! <br />3. Locations & Car chase sequences : Its a bit like \\"Tour de France\\" in a car, at 120mph. The locales from Paris to Nice to another small town with its own amphitheater, the angles in which the locations are shot and introduced, the narrow streets, the market on the roads, the coffee shop with the sit-out in the sun, the guided tours of tourists... its wonderfully pretty on the one hand & is the scene of some incredible high speed car chases that has one truly at the very edge of ones seat. I keep wishing I'd seen this movie on the cinema full screen, and hope its released someday again! <br />Once again - probably amongst De Niro's top 10 movies, Definitely worth a watch. <br />PS : The musical score is a haunting melody which is another reason to return to this movie time and again!

0060832819|2.0|I'm a big Coelho fan, but this book was disapointing.<br />To begin with, the first part is really dragging and you have to press hard to break through it. After that, you are witnessing the easy-to-read style that's so characteristic of Coelho's books. The plot is OK, but not exciting and many ideas are coming from other sources (the author gives credit to those people at the end of the book).<br />The author is also bragging way too much about his accomplishments (the main character seems to be the author himself) to a point to which it gets irritating.<br />The idea of Zahir in itself is fascinating and beautiful. It is the idea of love to the point of making it obsession (hence, 'A Nover of Obsession). And the author argues that everybody should experience a Zahir at least once in their lives. Can't argue with that!<br />Overall, though his worst book so far...
B00008WT5E|4.0|Powerage is one of those albums that's in the middle of the Bon Scott era, so he's at his peak here. With a lot of catchy rockers, and some not so catchy, Powerage is a great pick-up for AC/DC fans. <br /> <br />1.Rock 'n' Roll Damnation- Extremely catchy guitar beat and chorus make this song stand out. 10/10 <br />2.Down Payment Blues- A bluesy song with a good beat; Bon sings about having no money. 8/10 <br />3.Gimme A Bullet- Very catchy song in the same vein as Rock 'n' Roll Damnation. 10/10 <br />4.Riff Raff- A funky riff by Angus in the beginning starts off this fast-paced and fun rocker. 8/10 <br />5.Sin City- A mediocre song; repetitive chorus and verses. 7/10 <br />6.What's Next To The Moon- Starts off kind of slow, and never really builds from there. 7/10 <br />7.Gone Shootin'- This song has a really catchy groove and beat in the beginning, and keeps it throughout the whole song. 8/10 <br />8.Up To My Neck In You- Fast and loud song, but not really a standout. 6/10 <br />9.Kicked In The Teeth- Interesting beginning with Bon and the rest of the band trading off parts. Not really that great though. 7/10 <br /> <br />Overall, Powerage is a perfect example of AC/DC, with rocking guitar beats, and a hint of blues. Not a perfect album, by all means, but definitely fun to listen to.
B00008WT5M|4.0|The Razor's Edge is another great rock album with many more hits than albums before it.    1.Thunderstruck- Incredibly awesome song. Angus' guitar is amazing. 10/10  2.Fire Your Guns- Okay song, fast but gets repetitive. 7/10  3.Moneytalks- A very upbeat and extremely catchy song. Another one of AC/DC's big hits. 9/10  4.The Razor's Edge- Extremely ominous song with a great chorus. 9/10  5.Mistress For Christmas- Funny song, but not a standout track. 7/10  6.Rock Your Heart Out- Fast, upbeat rocker, but gets repetitive. 7/10  7.Are You Ready- A great solid fist-pumper with outstanding guitar and catchy chorus. 9/10  8.Got You By The Balls- One of the many songs on this album that  is boring and repetitive. 6/10  9.Shot Of Love- An infectious beat can't stop this song from getting boring. 7/10  10.Let's Make It- Kind of awkward guitar, but okay nonetheless. 7/10  11.Goodbye And Good Riddance To Bad Luck- Kind of catchy beat and chorus, but gets old quickly. 7/10  12.If You Dare- The guitar is very catchy, but another boring, repetitive song. 6/10    Overall, The Razor's Edge has its ups and downs, but it's worth listening to for just the first four songs.
B00009MGR6|5.0|Blow Up Your Video is one of my favorite AC/DC albums, because almost all of the songs on here are incredibly catchy and give AC/DC a new, innovative feel. <br /> <br />1.Heatseeker- One of the albums' hits, this upbeat song keeps the rock pace the whole time. 8/10 <br />2.That's The Way I Wanna Rock 'n' Roll- One of my favorites, because the chorus is catchy and the fast beat never stops. 9/10 <br />3.Meanstreak- One of AC/DC's catchiest songs ever. The guitar during the verses is awesome. 10/10 <br />4.Go Zone- A good solid rock song that does not disappoint. 8/10 <br />5.Kissin' Dynamite- I love the guitar riff during the verses, and the chorus. Just a great song. 8/10 <br />6.Nick Of Time- One of my favorite songs, because the chorus sounds innovative and it is catchy. 9/10 <br />7.Some Sin For Nuthin'- One of the only songs on this album that isn't really a standout track. 7/10 <br />8.Ruff Stuff- More sexually-charged lyrics add to this songs already good beat. 8/10 <br />9.Two's Up- Sort of an ominous song, but catchy and great nonetheless. 9/10 <br />10.This Means War- One of the two songs on this album that aren't really that good. It's fast, but repetitive. 7/10 <br /> <br />This album is surprisingly among the greats with \\"Back In Black\\" and \\"Highway To Hell\\". So that means buy it immediately.
B00008WT5C|4.0|Let There Be Rock is an amazing album filled with smash hits such as \\"Whole Lotta Rosie\\" and \\"Let There Be Rock\\". And other great songs like \\"Dog Eat Dog\\". This is a must-have album for anyone that likes classic AC/DC. <br /> <br />1. Go Down- This song is okay, a pretty good rocker. 7/10 <br />2. Dog Eat Dog- One of my all-time favorite AC/DC songs. It has a catchy beat and a good chorus. 9/10 <br />3. Let There Be Rock- A classic rocker, this song tells the story of how rock came to be. 8/10 <br />4. Bad Boy Boogie- A mediocre song, gets kind of repetitive, but has a good bluesy feel. 7/10 <br />5. Problem Child- A very catchy song, but why did they put it on here again? It was originally on Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap. 8/10 <br />6. Overdose- This song's kind of filler, but has good guitar. 7/10 <br />7. Hell Ain't A Bad Place To Be- Good song, just a plain rocker. 8/10 <br />8. Whole Lotta Rosie- Funny song, and has good guitar. A little disturbing though. 8/10 <br /> <br />This AC/DC album is almost like a AC/DC: Greatest Hits, because it has a lot of good songs on it. Definitely something to have in your collection.
B0001NBMBC|4.0|First of this review is gonna be another short one. I dont like slipknots music but this album made me change my mind. There sound is still metal but Rick Rubin managed to make Corey sing on this one! (instead of screaming the whole time). Therefore its a much more listenable album than there previous efforts. Its wortha  purchase definitely though.

B000BTC5LW|3.0|Sure I put this disc up on an Impossibly high pedistal a few things <br /> <br />1. Full screen..Ick..However It was filmed very well and gives you time to focus on the show ( no MTV rabid camera changes, that NEVER end ) they did a great job cleaning it up. <br /> <br />2. 5.1 mix is alittle limp ( and I have a very good sound system ) however concert films are subjective, and all newer surround receivers have a slew of soundfield settings, I put my denon to large hall and plyed with the settings, added alot of surround and a whole lotta warmth. I seldomly use soundfields except when listening with LIVE music...some of em really sound great! <br /> <br />3. Lots of extras ( man, their videos suck as much today as they did when they first came out, but they are English so styles are different. <br /> <br />4. Pink Floyd was never a flambouyant band in terms of their action on stage, No dancing about, no banter, no \\" moshing\\" with the band-mates, they let the Lazers and Circle amuse the crowds <br /> <br />David Gilmour = Meloncoly <br />Roger Waters = Cynic <br /> <br />Together they had the whole ying/yang thing going, apart their solo stuff has much to be desired ( like my spelling ) <br /> Rogers voice is Going quite rough, while David seems unchanged. seeing Pulse and seeing a live Waters show are 2 very different takes on some Pink Floyd tunes, and thats a good thing. <br /> <br />
B00003CXD5|4.0|The movie was terrific, and the only reason I didn't give it 5 stars, was because there was quite a bit of Spanish in the film, and the subtites from Spanish to English didn't seem to work on my copy.   English subtitles appeared for Engliish, and Spanish subtitles appeared when they spoke Spanish!  Strange.  Fortunately I know some Spanish, so i could sort of pick it up, but I don't know why the sub titles didn't work. Anyway,  Bogie was very good and the story was too.  Three men set out to find gold, and naturally greed and suspicion overtake one of them complicating the whole journey.  Besides all that were the usual bandits and Indians and so forth.  But it kept you watching and that's what really counts.  Won't tell you if they got any gold!
B000BYCAJE|3.0|The music gets five stars.  The 3 stars are for the lousy remastering job.  There are so many problems here, let me list them for you: <br /> <br />1.  I did a direct comparison between this new remaster and the older remaster job from the mid-90's.  The older version blows this one away!  This new remaster lacks any high end, making a lot of the songs sound flat. <br /> <br />2.  The beginning of \\"49 Bye Byes\\" is cutoff.  Crosby sings \\"You better come on in my kitchen / because it's going to be raining outside.\\"  This part is missing.  Apparently, the estate of Robert Johnson objected (why now, after all these years?). <br /> <br />3.  If you're thinking of buying this disc for the bonus tracks, save your money.  The best one, \\"Song With No Words\\" is already available on the CSN boxset.  The others are nice demos, but don't really lend themselves to repeated listening. <br /> <br />4.  THE KICKER: They removed a picture of Dallas Taylor from the back of the CD booklet.  On the original LP and subsequent CD issues, drummer Dallas Taylor is seen peering through the door.  Since he is currently in litigation with the band, they saw to it to remove him from the album jacket! <br /> <br />The sound is NOT an improvement, the bonus tracks are lackluster and one track is actually edited.  Stick with your older copy and save your money. <br /> <br />
B00005JOML|5.0|After being disappointed by the flicks that were marketed to kickstart summer 2006 into high-gear (movies such as Mission Impossible III, X-Men 3, The Da Vinci Code, and the somewhat bloated Pirates 2) comes Miami Vice, the (in my opinion) the best and unfortunately the most unfairly received movie of the summer. And it really is a shame, because this one has so much merit lurking in the grainy high-definition universe Mann has rendered it in.  <br /> <br />Michael Mann is definitely one of my favorite directors, so this review will sound biased, so I'll be as objective as possible.  <br /> <br />When I went to go see this, prior to watching it, many people who had seen it already were grumbling about the movie, calling it crap and a waste of time, this could only mean one of two things. 1 - The movie is actually bad. 2 - It it too artistic and cinematic. And when the final reel ended, fortunately it was latter.  <br /> <br />People slag Miami Vice either because it doesn't adopt the stylistic conventions of the universe it was born in. This includes pastel suits, shoes without socks, synth-heavy themes, etc... But here is the thing you have to remember, this is 2006, not the mid-to-late '80s. If anything we should be thanking Michael Mann for this. Mann successfully reinvents the show so as to fit into the modern times of Miami. The use of high-definition film, hand-held cameras, tense editing, and modern club-music and electronic, a tense world that exists in glarring overpowering white light, and deceptive and dangerous black shadows is created. From the first frames to the final fade we are fully submerged into this universe where it seems that something terrible is bound to happen. To simply go back to the '80s style would've basically been recycling '80s, and lets face it, the '80s are long over. I've had many people coming up to me after viewing this movie and saying how it is exactly like Miami in real life. To be able to portray and get the feeling of a real life setting and put it on screen and immerse the audience in it is a skill only the most talented filmmakers have. <br /> <br />The movie has also been slagged for being all talk and no action. People expected a big action movie where the buddies always have a big adventures, do death-defying stunts, get the girl in the end, and save the world (or the day) from something bad. But you should never judge a book by it's cover. Crockett and Tubbs are just two Vice Squad officers doing their jobs, not invincible heroes. Crockett is a brooding guy who's job has consumed his personal life and while working undercover falls in love with a member of the drug cartel (Isabella) which he is trying to bring down. Ultimately though, Crockett has to choose between his professional life with the Vice Squad, and his personal life with Issabella, who is high up in the drug trade. Tubbs has the same sort of conflict, falling in love with a fellow detective, giving him a major vulnerability in his line of work. Crockett and Tubbs are fully developed characters played perfectly by Colin Farrell and Jamie Foxx. The plot is at times hard to follow, but it is delivered in such a way that one discovers more and more with each repeated viewing. If you're looking for the typical action movie formula, you will probably hate this movie. Following suit of post 9/11 movies like Munich, Syriana, and Good Night and Good Luck, Mann chooses to take an uncompromising, unforgiving take on society and what's wrong with it. Because in real life, the good guy doesn't always get the girl, sometimes things don't make sense, and one is always facing some form of conflict.   <br /> <br />This is just picking out the obvious from the film, but there are many more aspects of this movie which have yet to surface. Like any good movie, this one rewards the viewer on repeated viewings. Much more so than any other film Mann has ever released. This may not be Mann's best film, but it's by far the best major movieto come out of Hollywood this summer.
B00008BRBG|4.0|THE BAND: Sting / Gordon Sumner (bass, guitars), Andy Summers (guitars), Stewart Copeland (drums & percussion).<br /><br />THE DISC: (1978) 10 songs clocking in at approximately 38 minutes. The digi-pak (2003) is a tri-fold case. There are no liner notes. On the tri-fold itself - printed song titles/credits/times, various black & white photos, and production notes. This is their 1st of 5 studio albums. Recorded at Surrey Sound Studios, Surrey, UK. All songs written by Sting with the exceptions of \\"Peanuts\\" (Copeland & Sting), and \\"Be My Girl - Sally\\" (Summers & Sting). Label - A&M Records.<br /><br />COMMENTS: How would I describe \\"Outlandos d'Amour\\"? It's a breakout album by a young UK band (though Copeland is American). An album that's fresh with ideas and original sound. Punk influences, but more rock and pop with a bit of reggae mixed in. It's a good release, but by no means the band's best album. Some great songs, mixed with some filler. I whole-heartedly agree with Amazon's statement, \\"a handful of tracks are far more interesting than the rest.\\" The songs \\"Roxanne\\" and \\"Can't Stand Losing You\\" made it to all 3 of The Police's \\"Greatest Hits\\" discs. The song \\"So Lonely\\" made it to 2 of the 3. The 4th best song is the opener - \\"Next To You\\" - what a great way to start off an album and career... in your face and simply won't let up. Sting's songs are the best of the group (as we would grow to expect... Sting was the creative force behind the band). The less interesting songs include Copeland's \\"Peanuts\\" (more like a free-form jam); and Summer's \\"Be My Girl - Sally\\" (an odd song with a minute-and-a-half piano break right in the middle of it with Summers poetically describing his blow-up female doll); the album closer \\"Masoko Tanga\\" is the longest song on the album at 5+ minutes and a decent melody, but sung in Japanese. \\"Outlandos d'Amour\\" is not the first Police album I usually reach for. A good debut album and a definite sign of things to come from Sting and The Police (4 stars).rs).

B000E6UWE4|2.0|I rate this book a 2 for the effort that the author put into his novel.  Erikson definitely tried to build a world with detail and intrigue, memorable characters and action.  I feel that no matter how hard he may have tried, he failed to accomplish nearly any of these things.   <br /> <br />I am very very discriminating when it comes to picking a book to read, a process of choosing a new book by a new author can take months for me.  (Amazon and it's users have been very helpful in this process.) I also find myself depending upon author recommendations... which this book has a hefty load of positive reviews on both accounts.  So I finally picked up the book and began reading it. <br /> <br />Well, the first 120 pages were a BEAR to get through.  Sometimes a new book or series can take a while to get their hooks in me so I will usually give them a chance, and 'Gardens' was no different.  However, my difficulty in getting through the beginning of this book was not because the author was setting up a lot of back story to set the stage, it was a lot of incoherent meandering;  short bursts of story that seemed to hold no bearing or connection to each other, and speaking of people, events or objects as if they were common knowledge, without any explanation as to who or what anything was.  I have no problem with varying perspectives and scenery changes, and I like learning the intricacies of a new world but as a reader I feel the author should not completely leave the reader in the dark as to what is going on.  This is a common theme throughout the book.  I do not expect to be led by the hand through a story, but I do not want to feel like I'm reading a book where a toddler has torn page upon page from the story. <br /> <br />After this initial struggle of the first 120 pages or so, the story became more coherent and interesting.  Much more easy to follow.  But the problems continue to persist.  Erikson does little to discribe his characters, either physically or emotionally.  Even less to depict the history of the world, it's races and basis for magic.  So we are left guessing as to what these characters look like, who these various races of people are, and why they act as they do, or why any of the 'main' characters are in their current situation.  I would like an author to tell me more about a character other than 'so-and-so is fat but attractive in a way.'  (this is, by the way, all we learn about a main character)  When characters are placed in dangerous situations, I find myself not caring as to whether or not they live or die.  I don't know why they act the way they do.  Whether it be the sudden, random romance, flip-flopping of loyalties, or whatever, I find myself indifferent to the characters actions... this is not good storytelling. <br /> <br />The middle section of the book is interesting, but the end is as difficult to get through and follow as the beginning.  New characters, events and monsters suddenly appear, that alter the story, as if the author needed more to throw at the characters.  Much of the ending's story arc is completely incomprehensible.  Not that I don't understand what he's trying to say, its just that it is told very poorly and with little to no continuity to the story, and weak characterization... for the most part.  (Also divine intervention should NOT be the only means by which characters survive any and ALL potential dangers.) <br /> <br />The more I write this, the more I realize how unsatisfying this book was.  I do not want to bash Mr. Erikson... I understand that this was his first book, and I will most likely try to read the next in the series, to see if he has matured as a writer, but if you want deep storytelling, memorable characters and action that grips, look elsewhere.   <br /> <br />There are some good ideas here, there truly is... (despite the scathing review), but execution of these ideas is dismal.  I feel that a book with weak or tired ideas and good to great storytelling far exceedsthat of a book with good ideas and terrible narrative.   <br /> <br />If you are checking this book out you have most likely already read George R.R. Martin's Song of Fire and Ice series, if not read it, it is amazing.  I also recommend Gene Wolfe's Wizard Knight dyad and Robin Hobb's Farseer series is also very good.
0062502182|5.0|This novel is a very simple fable about following your dreams while finding meaning in the larger universe. The writing just took me away from the stresses of every day, and helped me think about my own journey in life: the obstacles in my way, the possibilities that lie ahead, the strength gained from nature, and the ability to find inner peace and strength. I am not the type that usually goes for \\"inspirational\\" literature. One thing I really liked about this book is that it is more spiritual than religious. It can be appreciated by people from all religions, even those who perhaps don't believe in a God at all. There is a \\"universal language\\" here (to use the author's words). I just can't say enough good things about it. It's short and a very quick read. Definitely a book everyone should read -- well worth a day or two out of your life. It will inspire you!
0671027387|3.0|I'll preface my review with: this is the third book of Dan Brown's that I have read, and after Angels & Demons and The DaVinci Code.<br /><br />I supposed if I had read this book prior to reading the Robert Langdon books (A&D and DVC), I would've been astounded by the mastery of words and clever writing of Deception Point. And truly, as a stand-alone book, Deception Point is just that. But for many people, who've never read any pre-Da Vinci Code Brown books are interested in expanding their Dan Brown collection, I'd save this one for a library trip before committing to buying it. It's an excellent tale, again, a thought-provoking intriguing one, that carefully dabbles and plays on both parties involved (NASA/US Government, the NASA haters). Brown raises some interesting questions, such as questioning the true purpose of NASA, but he also explicitly points out that NASA's existence is crucial to the delicate balance of venturing into space. As an aerospace engineering student currently working on a NASA project, DP was a great read. It made me realize how delicate, and yet, how entrenched NASA sat in the current governmental politics. I can only imagine what a non-aerospace person may think.<br /><br />However, as Dan Brown work, compared to A&D and DVC, this book reeks of 10-cent cardboard novels that I'd be able to pick up at any drugstore. The unfortunate thing is that this book was written prior to the other two, so A&D and DVC are really mere copies of DP. Thus, choose carefully when reading your first Brown work. I had less patience with this one because this type of story becomes very predictable and very dull after reading two other books of the same formula.
B000BCE918|5.0|I am not normally a collector, but I enjoy having classics such as this.  It was ahead of it time and continues to be a thriller.
006054094X|4.0|This is a truly fascinating story, and if you ask me whether I believe China actually found America in 1421, my answer is affirmative YES. On the contrary, China should have known this Continent even before BC turned AD.  <br />Moreover, there are a lot of evidences that the Ancient knew this place -- in fact the Ancients were not just Chinese, but Egyptian, Phoenician, ancient Jews, Arabians, and Indian of Indian Subcontinent.  <br />While Mezies' painstaking researches have been severely criticized by some Academicians, I not only support his claim that Chinese under Zheng He travelled the \\"Seven Seas\\" before the Great Britain ever reached to that fame, it is for this reason I am not altogether in fond of his thesis. <br />It is too much of a stretch that Chinese alone did all that in one sweep of 1421 exploration. Many things Menzies claims done by the Treasure Fleet during the period of 1421 to 1423 -- such as exportation and importation of birds, plants, animals between the Continents of Old and New, and most of all Mapmakings, are done over centuries from the Ancient times, by few different groups of people (Chinese included, of course). <br />It is only for this reason I cannot give this book a five stars. <br />The history was written from the Ocean, not from the land. Our remote ancesters were truly adventurous who knew the Ocean currents, the stars, and four to sixteen directions. Columbus was the last!
B00006RINF|5.0|<br />  This album is perfection in every sense. There's unique guitar riffs, atmosphere, great vocals and incredible keyboarding. In my opinion this album is the only worth buy, the latest is not for my tastes and \\"Unleashed Memories\\" is lack of somethig but its a good album also.
B0009X766Y|4.0|The story opens in a small Illinois town during the Great Depression. Johnny Hooker (Robert Redford) and his companions, Luther (Robert Earl Jones) and Joe (Jack Kehoe) are small time grifters who get in a little too deep. As soon as they find out that they grifted the money from one of the town's most notorious mobsters, it's too late, and Luther is killed.   Johnny looks to get revenge by recruiting the help of an old con artist and friend of Luther's, Henry Gondorff (Paul Newman). With Henry's assistance and a masterful plan Johnny is able to avenge Luther's death.  <br /> The sets, music, dialogue, and actors help complete the feel of the 1930s American life.  The plot has many twist and turns that leave the audience wondering just who is conning who.  I really enjoyed watching Johnny in some of the action scenes; the way he cunningly avoided the mobsters chasing him was hilarious.  He seems to spend most of the movie avoiding being killed.  The final scene, which brings together all of the characters into the big sting has some more wild twists, and was a great way to end it.  I would highly recommend this movie to those who enjoy movies with enough comedy and action to satisfy one's taste for good fun.
B000F0UV0E|5.0|This CD is sublime, subtle, mature and sentimental. It's about love, growing older and the bittersweet of it all. It is masterful in the depths of poignancy it achieves through lyrical simplicity, as in the rockin' \\"This Is Us.\\"  It is playful in its passion: \\"Red Staggerwing\\" and \\"Belle Starr\\" and zen-like in questioning the value of the path one takes in life: \\"All The Roadrunning\\" and \\"Donkeytown.\\" And there are the just plain ol' beautifully crafted, heart-tugging journeyman love songs like \\"I Dug Up a Diamond\\" and \\"Beyond My Wildest Dreams\\", as smooth and rich as velvet tapestries.    This is a recording that people will grow into, rather than grow out of. The craftsmanship here is so absolutely perfect and humble that the undiscerning or the impatient may overlook its richness,  while others come back again and again, reaping the jewels.    There is cohesiveness that distinguishes this CD as a whole piece of enduring, wrought-iron art by two stellar musicians and not a strategic collection of songs lashed together by a quickly fading silk ribbon marketing ploy called \\"duet\\".  The chemistry between Knopfler and Harris--again more subtlety, more understatement--is strong, clearly grounded in something real, something of the earth, something that resonates the bittersweet of heartfelt emotions, hinting at feelings even deeper and more tender witheld from these tracks.    Artistic integrity has been a hallmark of the careers of both Knopfler and Harris. They are artists, not acts, and they are certainly masterful, journeymen musicians and this recording demonstrates this from beginning to end. It is tasteful, it is beautiful, it has its brights and darks and in-betweens and it bears repeated listens.      It also, admittedly leaves one wanting more, like a glittering Maseratti driving around city streets,  prudently restrained, but brimming with all the components, all the refinements and power begging to be let loose in wild abandon. This CD hints at even greaterthings rumbling beneath the hood. And that's the way it is with most, if not all, great art.     I will consider this a classic.
B00000I41G|5.0|The pairing of Kenny Burrell and Stanley Turrentine makes for music that is as hot as a fire cracker!  Without a doubt, some of Kenny's finest moments are found here.  Stanley Turrentine lends his talent to cook up those grooves.<br /><br />The opener, \\"Chitlins Con Carne\\", is one of Kenny's best-known sizzlers.  \\"Soul Lament\\" is both gently and deeply touching.  The title song, \\"Midnight Blue\\" has a care-free and easy feel.  \\"Saturday Night Blues\\" features Stanley Turrentine at his best.  \\"Gee, Baby, Ain't I Good To You\\" highlights Kenny Burrell at his inspired and awesome finest.  There is also a bonus cut, \\"K Twist\\" that was not included in the original album.<br /><br />Kenny Burrell touches music afficienados from all generations.  His guitar portrays a subtle exuberance that most musicians envy.  Inspired, artistic, and soulful, Kenny Burrell is timeless!  Kenny's flawless sound is ageless and color-blind.....his music is world class.
0679422714|2.0|Ms. Chang obviously dislikes Mao very much.  I am not a Mao defender -- much of what he did matches the actions of Stalin or Hitler -- but history is best presented as evenly as possible.  There were times when I felt that Ms. Chang's hatred of Mao was clouding her description of events.  After reading \\"Mao: The Unknown Story\\" I do not feel that I have been given the complete story.
B000E41MS6|5.0|I've been a Doctor Who fan since 1975, when the abominations known as the Howard Da Silva/ Time/Life versions first hit the Colonies.<br /><br />Fast foreward to 2005. The show, along with the doctor, has gone through some astounding changes.<br /><br />But our beloved Blue Box has never changed.  Reday and able to whisk us to adventures set in the deep past, the relative present, or the farthest, most flung future.<br /><br />Pity that Christopher Eccleson was the shortest lived doctor of the entire series. And just when he was hitting his stride.<br /><br />Ah yes... what's his name of the Universial movie. Sorry, he does not exist. Just like the two Cushing movies.<br /><br />Other than that, I'm looking foreward to the new voyages of the T.A.R.D.I.S.  May she continue for another 30 years, at least.
B000FILW86|5.0|Yeah, the majority of reviews here are very positive and almost everyone is saying it's their best release since 'Dream Police'.  But c'mon people, let's be honest -- I have as much warm-hearted retro memories for the '70's as anyone else, but this album blows the roof off of everything Cheap Trick has done EVER !!  Of course, their first five albums are classics, and they've had good ones since ('One on One', 'Woke Up With a Monster', 'CT '97' and 'Special One' - all fine albums), but this disc is truly a power-pop masterpiece...and I do not use that term lightly.  However, it's fully deserved here.  Robin's voice has never sounded as powerful in the studio as it does here...and this is a man who truly SHINES on every CT album (even the weak ones).  Rick's guitar playing and songwriting here bring out every Beatles, ELO and Raspberries hook he ever learned, and at least three tracks -- \\"Welcome to the World\\", \\"Dream the Night Away\\" and \\"This Time You Got It\\" -- are stone-cold classics.  This baby just rocks from start-to-finish and the production is the clearest I've ever heard on a CD.  Tom's bass, in particular, rumbles so loudly that I had to change my CD car stereo tone setting from 'Rock' to 'Manual'  because I thought the speakers were going to blow out !! <br /> <br />Who would've thunk it...perhaps the best power-pop band ever puts out their ultimate album over 30 years since their inception.  'Rockford', I believe, will be the rock album to beat for the second half of this decade.
B000AYEL6U|5.0|North & South is one of my new favorites (as is Richard Armitage!).  Acting by all is excellent, script is well-done, sets/costumes are just amazing, & it is so nice to see chemistry on screen again.  The story does share some similarities with Pride & Prejudice, but in my opinion N & S is much darker and intense.  I just love it & recommend it to any one who enjoys BBC productions.
B000F0UV0E|5.0|You picked this one for me and you were so right!  I don't own any other cd by either of these singers but I can not get enough of this music.  Thank you!
B00005AG7K|5.0|As a keepsake video of The Beatles 1966 classic BBC broadcast, this digitally remastered release from Avenue One can not be beat. Keep in mind this an almost 40 year old analog video tape that it was copied from. However it was copied from the orginal master tape and as such, it's far superior to the earlier releases I've seen. So don't expect HD clearity, not by a stretch. What you do have here is a prestine copy of MMT, primarily shot from hand-held, somewhat primitive equipment, at least by today's standards.     None-the-less, there's a warmth and a subtle charm in watching the boys in one of their very last video performances. They ham it up with the same sort of wreckless abondament which won us over with on A Hard Day's Night and Help. Consider this, Magical Mystery Tour preceeded M-TV by at least twenty years and can be seen almost as a prototype of that format. Indeed further testiment to The Beatles lasting influence on the music industry and the marketing of pop culture. And finally there's the sublime soundtrack: I Am The Walrus, Your Mother Should Know, Baby You're A Rich Man, Hello Goodbye, Strawberry Fields Forever, Fool On The Hill, Penny Lane, Flying, (The Beatles one and only instumental) and George's pyscidellic sitar opus Blue Jay Way. Irresistable stuff if you consider yourself a Beatle-Maniac of any degree. You've got to love this DVD.........Afterall \\"All You Need Is Love\\"!!!!!!!!!!Step Up To The Mystery Tour!!!!!!

B00005QFE5|5.0|This beautiful film will stay with you for days afterward.  Zhang Ziyi's sweet portrayal of Di is perfection.  I would imagine there wasn't a dry eye in the house when it was first shown to audiences.<br /><br />I just finished watching The Road Home for the second time and I cannot get the refrain of the film's score out of my head - not that I mind! : )  It beautifully matches the cinematography and the story.  Unfortunately however, the soundtrack does not appear to be available - at least not at the moment.  I'll keep my fingers crossed for sometime in the future.<br /><br />I like this film so much I'm going to purchase the DVD so I can revisit it whenever I wish.<br /><br />I have a recommendation for another sweet film you may like if you enjoyed The Road Home.  Although the story is not a romantic love story, it is still a story about love.  The film is called Shower.  Check it out when you have time.
B00005JP0C|5.0|Ruthless ambition is rampant when money or power is at stake.  Ruthlessness applies to anything at the top of its game.  For example, how ruthless is politics known to be, or religion???  Thus, Miranda Priestly (Meryl Streep) is the only choice for top editor of Runway Magazine, as is defined in the final scenes, when the publisher realizes there are no second choices for the job. She balances success with all the right elements, such that others might crash and burn immediately, trying to walk in her shoes.  Probably, this character will inspire many a \\"rising star\\" to be the best that they can be.<br /><br />I have been \\"abused\\" by managers in many different fields.  I find that competition breeds and demands fierce commitment.  So, if you can't stand the heat, then get out of the kitchen.  This axiom sums up practical defense of ruthlessness in contrast to the morality play that impresses so many of the reviewers here.  To me, it's about being able to perform your job, not about what you trade in morals or emotions to do your job.  Imagine that Andy worked at The New York Times, Washington Post, New York Magazine, The New Yorker, Esquire, or wherever, for a male editor-in-chief with way more testosterone than Miranda.  (He, he, he)  And I, for one, prefer competitive people who can survive competing with the world's finest to produce the finest goods and services.  It may be that some people might confuse people orientation with business orientation, or even religion.  I am not confused.  All these are valuable in their spheres.  However, I loathe tokens or quotas on the front lines of battle, no matter the forum.  The front lines require champions, even when they are fighting for more grant money for poor children or senior citizens.<br /><br />I have been a fan of Meryl Streep's for such a long time, especially since Sophie's Choice.  A part of Sophie is revealed in Miranda, when she confides in Andy.  That one time.<br /><br />Anyway, I actually cheered in the first third of the movie, when all the fabulous clothes of the \\"clackers\\" strutted across the screen. (Including the montage of Miranda arriving at work with her coat and bag.)  I own 96 pairs of shoes, including Prada, Miu Miu, Dolce & Gabbana, Gucci, Kenneth Cole, Ralph Lauren, Giorgio Brutini, Cole Haan, Diesel, To Boot New York, and Jill Sander.  This kind of superficial shallowness is either in your blood or not.  I have found some \\"victims\\" who use fashion as a hobby, and others who merely try to fit in by wearing the \\"right clothes.\\"  Fashion is my hobby; I willingly buy clothes rather than food.  Fashion is not my career.  It matters not to me why people dress up; I just love to see it.  I often compare a human to a blank canvas, and clothes to paint.  Often, there are resulting masterpieces.<br /><br />Please do see this movie, if you haven't already, for the sheer luxury of the clothes and corporate lair set as the background to the beautiful clothes and accompanying drama.<br /><br />Aside from the fundamental theme of moral choice, this movie is more form than function.  And if you just kick back and enjoy the sight of it, you'll leave with the best impression.  I give it five stars because I love fashion just to look at, and I love Meryl Streep as she opens my mind.vie, when all the fabulous clothes of the \\"clackers\\" strutted across the screen.

0393312836|3.0|This version of the book starts off with a rant from the author.  He explains that this book is not what he considers his best work.  He also tells the reader that this is the first complete version of the book in the US.  The first release or the \\"Kubrick release\\" left out the last chapter.  Burgess tells us that he believes this to be a mistake.  He was correct when he says that this is not his best work.  It isn't his best work.  It is a great concept and he has a way with words but it's much too \\"mathmatical\\" and less creative.  I had trouble creating my inner animation.  Which many would not agree with that assessment considering his creation of a slang, which was to highlight youths ongoing penchant to create an esoteric lingo to distiguish themselves from authority.  Now, Burgess was incorrect in saying that his original version is the best.  The Kubrick version of 20 chapters is the better book.  That last chapter is not exactly fitting and doesn't satisfy the theme as Burgess imagined it would.  It's tired just like Alex.  His use of \\"What's it going to be then, eh?\\", leaves me grey.  I can't make up my mind on whether it's quite intelligent or pretentious or contrived or all of the above.  It is not the prophetic masterpiece many believe it to be.  Violence has always been a constant in human society.  Prophetic would be speaking of peace.  It's a good concept, too technical outside of the slang, and can be difficult to read.
0393327655|5.0|This incredible, well thought out, well researched, eloquently written and profound book should be required reading all over the world.  Finally an intelligent disucussion that puts faith to the test of REASON!  Unless we discuss, hash-out, and understand these faiths for what they truly are and why they were created, we are doomed to a life of ignorance, something many relious people enjoy today.  Living in denial and without the religious courage to find truth is no excuse for maintaining an outdated 14th century view of God.  Thank you Sam Harris for your brilliance and courage!!!
B000F1IQN2|2.0|20 Years ago \\"Sword of Gideon\\" was produced with a viable cast of characters and althought slow at times as is \\"Munich\\" I feel it gives the viewer an easier to follow format and although S of G doesn't have the blood and gore of Munich, I believe the \\"Sword of Gideon\\" is a far better movie and leaves its viewers emotionally a part of both the circumstances and issues surrounding the massacre at the Olympic games and the stress and resolve of the Israelies to avenge their losses. I fell asleep through Munich and cried through the Sword of Gideon.
1400079276|4.0|Like some other reviewers here, I thought this book started off amazingly. The dark mood, the crow character, the two protagonists, the amazing Johnny Walker scene.... it looked like it could easily be Murakami's best. However, it just went downhill (albiet slighly) for the rest of the book.  <br /> <br />The end of the book was both to predictable and too unexplained (what was Crow? what did the battle between crow and that corporate icon have to do with anything? How was it resolved? etc.) <br /> <br />Still a worthwhile read, to be sure, but it is not the best book my Murakami by any means. If you are new to Murakami I'd suggest these three above Kafka on the Shore:  <br /> <br />The Elephant Vanishes (stories) <br />Wind-Up Bird Chronicle (his best, but very long) <br />Hardboiled Wonderland and the End of the World <br /> <br />If you read those and like them, then try Kafka on the Shore.

This guy can really sing without all that horrid, standard hiphop production that you so often hear within the genre.  Im not even the slightest bit of a hiphop fan (at least today's hiphop... 99.8% of it is talentless garbage, over horrible, stupid beats that don't do anything musically for anyone's mind).  PICK THIS CD UP NOW, and SUPPORT REAL MUSIC, and maybe more of it will be supported by the f***ing record companies, and not just within the hiphop genre, but ALL genres of music!

I'm not going to write a review of NG because if you're looking at this you probably are a fan of it.<br /><br />The big problem for me is that there is no episode synopsis for the dvds.  [...] is a great resource but I wish a companion book came with either the individual seasons or the complete series.  Episode titles really aren't good enough when you have 20 hours per season with 7 seasons.
B000FDEU12|1.0|I am quite dissappointed in this CD, being won over by the sound bytes that I sampled here at Amazon, which are very beautiful. Imagine listening to one of the samples presented here 20 times in a row.  The sample represents the whole of the song, which is repeated over and over and over with a solo over the top.  To me, this signifies a lack of creativity.  There is so much potential in each of these songs, but it is as if Avishai wrote 4 measures and then put a repeat sign at the end to finish the song.  Maybe my expectations were too high, expecting a Billy Childs type of song structure.  I will be looking at selling my CD so I can recoup at least a portion of my investment.

0316172324|2.0|Way to long for the content delivered.  Essentially one big idea; experience, and I guess a little personality typing, makes for solid \\"gut\\" decision making.  So much for the old saying \\"don't judge a book by its cover\\".  If these ideas are implemented in the business world (I am an executive in the computer software industry) I guess it could lead to some real decision making efficiencies.  On the other hand I can see the \\"shoot from the hip types\\" using Blink to justify their ongoing lack of elbow grease!  By the way, the Tipping Point by the same author is a 5 star read....can't win them all.

Of their four studio albums this one is the best one in my opinion by the fact that it has the greater number of really good songs than the others. Very good European pop rock with a touch of Old Spain for extra flavor.

B00008WT5E|5.0|AC/DC's POWER AGE is one of the band's best production pieces.  The stand out song here is SIN CITY which is probably the precursor to the future HIGHWAY TO HELL. However, RIFF RAFF and ROCK N ROLL DAMNATION come in close. The patented Young and Young rhythm section of three chord guitar crunches and Bon Scott's wailing with slight humorous tone is perfect for their song writing abilities.  Their take on clich&eacute;s and giving them a rock point of view is what they do best. If Chuck Berry was rock 'n' roll's poet laureate, AC/DC were the poet laureate's of hard rock. Classic line from ROCK N ROLL DAMNATION: \\"You say that the music's too loud? Well, Baby that's tough!\\"
B0000844I8|4.0|The best part about this release for me is that it's widescreen and has a pretty nice commentary. Though I will say one thing about the commentary, it is entirely from the view of the directors. No actors take of a scene or anything, it's mostly the design of the sets, musical score, &etc. Having said that, it's nicely done for what it is. <br /> <br />The movie itself is still as cool as always. While it doesn't have any of the deeper thinking stuff that you find in the series, it does have a few nice plot twists, decent character development, and even a bit of a romantic side. Overall a groovy movie :)
B00008WT5C|5.0|AC/DC made it to the ROCK N ROLL HALL OF FAME because they stuck to their guns and just played to their strengths and capabilities. Never a love ballad in the mix, and if there was anything slow, it was always blues rooted. However, all their songs had the patented three chord crunches provided by Angus and Malcom Young and Bon Scott's vocals compliments their power. The standout song here is HELL AIN'T A BAD PLACE TO BE. The rest of LET THERE BE ROCK is typical AC/DC, all with great production.  The Scott,Young & Young songwriting team always has a touch of sly tongue-in-cheek humor which always told the fans that AC/DC took their music seriously, but didn't take themselves too seriously.
B0002Y4T92|1.0|I have still not received this product and am being bounced from staff to staff by DHL Global Mail. <br />This is a ridiculous and unacceptable situation. <br />I will never use Amazon again, I feel cheated.
B000EULJLU|4.0|I've been a fan of Tool for many years now, and I do believe they bring fantsatic new stuff with each album. Some people claim that they get better record after record, and this is partially true. Certanily they get more experimentat. <br />The fact is I really liked 10,000 Days. True, it has it's annoying fill tracks, but it grows in you with every listen. Personnaly I think Right in Two is the best song of the album. The hole mix sounds excellent, the voice is low and cristalline. And lighter in songs like The Pot, where it has an A Perfect Circle/Tool pre Lateralus  feel to it, the way the bass sound is in my personal opinion the best and punchiest Tool has ever had. Drums are five star quality(as always), and the guitar riffs seem to be more evolved and experimental, although boring and repetitive at some points of the record. <br />To say these record is their best would be a heavy statement, But certainly it is a must have to everyone who has a taste in real music. <br />The art(I'm a big Alex Gray fan), and the package are amazing.
0743277708|5.0|This book, so loved by scholars, has an equal appeal to those of us who just plain love a good story well told.  Mr. Adams's rabbit characters are at once alive, interesting, and believeable.  It took an amazing art to wind this woodland story into the sophisticated, complicated novel it is.  Hats off to this modern classic, and may we all grow to be as wise as Holly.
B00005JOQS|2.0|I thought Singer's XMen movie was decent. I thought XMen 2 was awesome! I know first films are difficult. The director and the writers have to set the stage for the characters which have been living in comics for decades. There had never been an XMen movie until Singer directed the first one. There have been four Superman movies before this one. <br /> <br />My filmgoing companion loved the film. I was sorely disappointed with Superman Returns. Actors aside, the script is just not enough different from the original Superman film. So what's the point of recreating it? There's all sorts of \\"big\\" action (he stops a plane from crashing - the best action in the film - and other \\"big\\" stuff) but it ends up being non action, because it's all just too big and outlandish. And isn't anyone else out there getting more than a little bored with Lex Luthor - a mere mortal, albeit a megalomaniacal one - being the be all, end all nemesis for the Man of Steel? For Pete's sake there are many other villains that they could bring to the forefront. Let's see Superman fight for crying out loud! I'm sick to death of seeing him (on the big screen) stop trains, planes, buildings, signs, etc. It's all too big, too predictable. He can't fight Lex Luthor because Luthor will drop dead with one punch. After all Superman is SUPER! Give Superman someone SUPER to fight! What about Brainiac? What about dozens of other villains he's fought over the years? Geezaloo, are the writers/producers that narrow minded? <br /> <br />Now, to the CGI (special effects)...didn't anyone else find Superman's look to be more than a little \\"plastic\\" looking? I was jarred out of my suspension of disbelief repeatedly by the smooth appearance of Superman's face and tights etc. He looked like a computer generated character rather than a living breathing actor (the handsome but stiff Brandon Routh). <br /> <br />All in all, the best Superman storyline and proper updating of Superman has been getting done in the televisionseries \\"Smallville\\" which has breathed far more life into the character and the stale storylines than Singer's blockbuster budgeted film ever could. In the television series Clark Kent isn't a complete bumbling dolt and as such he is fresh and believable. <br /> <br />Unless Superman (read: producers, director, and studio) can come up with some better storylines and fresh villains, I'm afraid any future outings will just be further dull, listless outings. Give me the XMen, Smallville, Spiderman, HellBoy, Buffy the Vampire Slayer and such as my super heros any day over the stiff and repetitive Superman Returns. The super heros in those films are hands on and the action is more \\"real\\". Sure, Superman is supposed to be \\"superior\\" and stand for truth, justice and the American way, but what's he's turned into is a big ol' dull goody two shoes with more muscles than sense.
B0006L16N8|2.0|Most negative reviewers of this album appear to be people who have no inclination to like it anyway, regardless of its actual content: heavy metal fans, people who have no taste for light rock, and scorned Radiohead fanboys. So, seeing that my rating for this album is as low as it is, you'd expect me to belong to one of the above camps; quite to the contrary, however, I long held \\"A Rush of Blood to the Head\\" to be one of the best albums I had ever heard, and eagerly anticipated this follow-up. All of the former being said, however, I found \\"X&Y\\" to be quite possibly the most disappointing artistic accomplishment that I've ever experienced. <br /> <br />It's almost impossible to talk about the majority of the tracks on an individual basis, as they so closely resemble one another in their dull, vague lyrics and monotonous, repetitive melodies. More than once, I would often check my CD player to see if I had accidentally hit \\"repeat\\" and was listening to a previous track. While I will refrain from an exhaustive comparison of the two albums, and thereby expose a bias that I do not have towards wishing this album to sound like the band's former work, \\"X&Y\\" seems to be attempting to achieve a similar status as \\"A Rush\\", an album that was melancholy and remorseful while simultaneously being pleasantly retrospective and uplifting. The main difference between the two is that \\"X&Y\\" is much more depressing and quiet in tone. I would be open to this stylistic feel if it was executed in such a way that was moving and, most importantly, interesting. Instead, the band takes the idea of \\"less is more\\" to such an extreme that they delude any substance or message that exists in the music. Lyrically, the album is a just a collection of pre-suicidal, clinically depressed anecdotes and generic philosophical ponderings that mirror the emptiness of the narrative. Musically, the music follows suit, coming across as quite bland for all of the band's obvious ambition. Bluntly, the music andthe lyrics just...are. Period. Nothing more, nothing less. <br /> <br />Of course, that's not to say that every single track on the album follows suit with the aforementioned pattern: there are the stand-out songs that up my overall rating a star. While it does tend to get old, partially due to its being overplayed on the radio and the video subsequently being shown constantly on television, \\"Speed of Sound\\" is nevertheless a very well-crafted, melodically and lyrically inspiring song in the style of \\"Clocks.\\" Like the band's previous single, its meaning is ambiguous, yet it still manages to soar musically. More impressive is \\"Fix You\\", the underrated and underplayed second single off of the album. A truly moving tale of the narrator's attempts to console a loved one, the song builds from delicate piano and sincerely soft vocals to a multiple harmony finale featuring the voices of the entire band, complete with a great and memorable guitar riff that perfectly compliments the song's gentle tone. It's certainly not an accident that the sole two good songs from the album became its first two promotional singles; it almost appears as if the record company knew that the other tracks would never sell the album if mainstream audiences heard them on the radio. Of course, then again, they did release the tepid \\"Talk\\" as the album's third single, the epitome of the nothingness of \\"X&Y\\", so I could be wrong.  <br /> <br />Plain and simple, this album is disappointing on an epic level and not worth buying or downloading, even for free. I would recommend getting \\"Speed of Sound\\" and \\"Fix You\\" separately and skipping all of the other hollow attempts at songwriting on this bomb.  <br />
B00005TQKQ|5.0|A signal in my Sony camcorder said the head needed to be cleaned. So I used this head cleaner and the warning went away. It should work as it's a Sony head cleaner.
1558807381|5.0|Long before the success of the \\"Lord of the Rings\\", there was \\"Legend\\", a movie about good and evil, darkness and light.  The story revolves around the mythical faerie creature called the unicorn.  As long as unicorns roam the earth, evil can never come to the pure of heart.  Due to this, the evil Lord of Darkness (Tim Curry) has sent his most evil goblin Blix (Alice Playten) to cut off the horn of the unicorn.  Without their horn, the unicorn loses its power and the earth will be shrouded in darkness. <br /> <br />However, two other mortals, Jack (Tom Cruise) and his beautiful young friend Lily (Mia Sara) live in the forest as well.  Jack takes Lily to see the mythical creatures, but Lily mistakenly touches one of them, and, unknown to her, she has secretly led Blix and his minions to the creatures in the process.  Frightened by Lily's touch, the unicorns bolt, but not before Blix unleashes a poisoned arrow at them.  The arrow strikes home, and soon one of the unicorns is down.  Blix raises his sword and severs the unicorn's horn.  Triumphantly, he begins his journey to the Lord of Darkness, the prized horn accompanying him. Immediately after the horn was severed, the forest is covered in frost and snow.  Gone is the sunlight and warmth. <br /> <br />Soon, Jack is joined by several other forest creatures, led by the elf Honeythorn Gump (David Bennett).  Their task is to retrieve the horn and heal the unicorn before the Lord of Darkness gains possession.  To make matters worse for Jack and his friends, the other unicorn and Lily have been captured and taken prisoner.  Will Jack arrive in time to free Lily and regain possession of the horn, or will the Lord of Darkness succeed in his quest to rid the world of all unicorns so he can rule the world in total darkness? <br /> <br />This is a very good movie.  Tim Curry is simply magnificent as the Lord of Darkness, and Tom Cruise and Mia Sara do a fine job as well.  The story is exciting, and the special effects are well-done.  I am a big fan of fantasy fiction, both books and movies, and I was very impressed with this movie.  Although the special effects are nothing like those found in the \\"Lord of the Rings\\" movies, they are still very good. <br /> <br />I give this movie my highest recommendation.  Watch and see an epic battle between the forces of good and evil.
B000GJPL1S|5.0|This is out of the world stuff. Keanu Reeves excels as Neo.
B0000047CX|5.0|This is truly a classic Stan Getz album. His rich, distinctive tenor sax sound melts into the bossa nova beat as if he had  invented it. Getz's smooth collaboration with Joao Gilberto, Astrud Gilberto, and Antonio Carlos Jobim produce silky, sensuous melodics on every track. This is a must-have for the longtime Getz fan or anyone who has just discovered the legendary 60's bossa nova genre.
B000AMJDHY|5.0|This is the greatest CD I've ever heard in my life! All the songs rock. The songs make you wanna get up and dance, it'll make you wanna scream the words to the world and the songs are incredibly contagious. The songs are so great that my 10-year-old sister who doesn't like rock, loves it. Even my parents like it. This band is kinda like Fall Out Boy, but better and hotter. This is a MUST BUY CD!!!!
B000000OUW|1.0|I litterally mailed this album to Hell.  I microwaved it (if you've never done it, you must microwave at least one CD), broke it into pieces, then addressed the envelope to Hell, stamped it, and mailed the MoFo.  It was that bad.  Manowar, once Kings of Metal, have become Clowns of the Armageddon.  Avoid later Manowar at all cost.  Everything Triumph and back is awesome.  Steel and death and kings and might, we are strong and bold and right.  Fight and kill and die and fight, steel and kill and fight and might.  They've become cliches of themselves.  You suck Manowar.  Eat Shizite and die. <br /> <br />This album deserves NO stars, but the world demands one.  I hate you world.  Burn in hell.  I will deliver thee to ash.  ROAR!

B00029QWII|5.0|That is right. God bless Mel for making one of the most loved and profound depiction of Jesus' crucifixion. <br /> <br />Let's face it, there were people in this country who've had it in for Mel sice production on this film began years back. When the worst they predicted failed to materialize they looked like the alarmist fools they are. Mel's tirades just gave them any excuse they needed to attack him all over again. <br /> <br />Where is the condemnation for Gary Busey and Billy Zane for starring in an outright antisemitic movie depicting Jewish doctors as ghouls lusting for the body organs of Arabs? <br />Where was the outrage for Marlon Brando when he called Jews \\"kikes\\" right on the Larry King Show?  <br />Or what about Russell Crowe who not only once referred to the Maoris of New Zealand as \\"niggers\\" but hit somebody with a telephone? <br /> <br />Mel did a really stupid, horrible thing with what he said. <br />But you know what? Suck it up. Accept the asology and let the man get on with his life and the great flicks he makes. <br />
B000002H97|5.0|When I heard this album, I loved it! The best songs are 'Enter Sandman', 'The Unforgiven', 'Wherever I May Roam', 'The God That Failed', and 'My Friend of Misery'. Metallica are one of my all time favorite hard rock bands along with GN'R. They just rock really hard. They are definately much better than the Beatles. <br />If you want a great heavy metal album, you definately need this. <br />Go get this with Ride The Lightning, and Master Of Puppets today. <br />Those are both other really good albums from Metallica. <br />One more thing, ONE OF THE GREATEST RECORDS EVER!!!!!
0767817486|5.0|This movie was an incredible adventure on the dangers of getting involved in the drug culture, especially in a country where you're not familiar with the laws.  Billy Hayes was a stupid American college kid looking to score drugs in of all places, Turkey.  He got what he deserved and he's lucky to be alive.<br /><br />Some footnotes, Oliver Stone wrote this film and is notorious for exagerating the truth in his works (i.e, Platoon, JFK, Salvador).  He recieved an Oscar for his screenplay adaptation of Hayes' book.  This movie was filmed in Malta, not Turkey as some uninformed writers have posted for this film.  People should do their homework before posting a review.<br /><br />Take this film for what it's worth, an entertaining adventure.
B00008BXJG|1.0|I hate AC/DC as they are one of my top 20 worst bands of all time. BON SCOTT IS A REALLY ANNOYING SINGER WHO JUST SCREAMS..EVERY SONG IS AWFUL EVEN JOKES LIKE TOUCH TOO MUCH. AVOID THIS LOUSY BAND AND <br />GO WITH METALLICA BLACK ALBUM INSTED.

B00005JOYM|5.0|I haven't seen the Oliver Stone film as yet, but I'd like to address the question of timing that so many people are concerned about. <br />There was a little upset in the day-to-day life process 65 years ago called WWII!  <br />Guess what?  <br />Hollywood imediately started making films about it. They made \\"Purple Heart\\" about the Doolittle raiders, as well as \\"Sands Of Iwo Jima\\" just to name two.  <br />Apparently our parents and grandparents were made of sterner stuff. They didn't feel the need to hide their heads in the sand of shopping malls, pretending that all is well as long as it doesn't affect ME or MY loved ones. <br />It's like getting back on the horse that threw you! <br />It happened! <br />We can't change the horrible event, but we shouldn't ignore a well made film that honors the bravery and sacrifice of that terrible day. <br />Too soon? <br />I say, \\"Not soon enough!\\" <br />And if I sound like a Fox News junky and Bush supporter, you're wrong. <br />I was against the Iraq invasion from the beginning, because I knew we were going after the wrong enemy. <br />Just because I don't support (in my opinion) the failed Bush terrorist policy, doesn't mean I can't be a total flag waving patriotic supporter of those who sacrifice to make the rest of us safer. <br />THAT is what I think this movie is about, and it's never too soon to honor that sacrifice. <br /> <br /> <br />

B00007KWHG|5.0|A flood of memories pour in when I hear Frankie belt out the high notes on all their wonderful hits from the 1960's. <br /> <br />I'm a teenager again when I hear their Disco hits such as Who Loves You, December 1963, Swearin to God and Grease. <br /> <br />The sound mixing is very clear especially on Opus 17 Don't You Worry Bout Me when the baritone sax has a solo.  If you're a true Four Seasons fan, you will not be disappointed with this CD.  Enjoy.
B0002J4ZWS|5.0|I really believe that this is the best story ever told on film. I have watched many movies in my lifetime, and none have been close to as powerful or as moving as this one. <br /> <br />This film has some of the best acting I've ever seen, specifically from Tim Robbins, Morgan Freeman, and James Whitmore. Normally when I watch a movie, I like to root for the bad guys, but this is one of the only movies where I truly feel for the characters involved and I desperately hope for them to have a good outcome. The twists and turns are truly amazing, and the ending will leave you breathless. <br /> <br />The quality on the DVD is superb, and they even fixed a goof at the end of the film, regarding the placement of a \\"wound\\", just for this DVD release. There are some great extras such as commentaries, behind the scenes documentaries, a 20 minute spoof of the movie, trailers, and some other things that make this set well worth the money. <br /> <br />I cannot stress how great this movie is, and how it's a *must own* for anyone looking to start a respectable DVD collection.

B00029QWII|5.0|Despite Mel Gibson's recently foolish behavior I still stand by this movie and Mel Gibson as a fan and a Christian.<br /><br />Over the last few years, what more can be said about this beautiful -and yet so controversial- movie? THE PASSION OF THE CHRIST, depicting the final hours of Jesus' earthly life, has become for believers a symbol of adoring love. This deep feeling amongst faithful Christians for the film and its director has also spurred deep resentment, spite and anger in those who never wanted it released in the first place. Throughout the film's production and presentation there were many detractors who hammered away at Gibson and the American Christian public, predicting the most ridiculous scenarios of anti-semiticism, which they believed would be the result of us ignorant gentiles viewing this movie.<br /><br />Naturally all of this ended up being seen for the irrational fear-mongering that it was. If anything, this movie left Christians and others with more positive attitudes towards the Jewish people.<br /><br />Understand that for the first time in a big budget film, Mel Gibson, that notorious \\"Jew Hater,\\" showed us not only an earthy and realistic Jesus - but also a Jesus who was Jewish to the core. Gone were the traditionally depicted blond-haired and blue-eyed Jesus and disciples, and the pseudo-Shakespearean speech of so many Biblical films was replaced with first Century Aramaic. Gibson attempted to present as realistic a depiction of the Man and His times as much as he wanted it deeply spiritual and reverent.<br /><br />As for concerns about the films \\"negative depictions,\\" anyone who views this film with an open mind will see that all humanity -ALL!- is depicted so-called negatively. Gibson shows the ugliness of all men made the worst on that fateful day. It is important to understand that Christ suffered, died and was resurrected for those very Jews who mocked and jeered Him and for those Roman soldiers who sadistically brutalized and crucified Him. The point of the Gospels, and thus this film, is that we all carry sin and we all need the redemption which that Jewish carpenter offered up for us on that sad and ugly day.<br /><br />As a man who carries many sins and transgressions upon my own soul, I was humbled and heartened after watching Gibson's magnificently beautiful movie. I would hope that anyone who has taken up their valuable time to read this far into my review can also understand that the director of this film is only as human and spiritually fragile as all the rest of us. True, Gibson has said and done things that were horribly wrong. But who of us haven't? And as all of us want to be forgiven our own particular trespasses and regrets, then let us also forgive the trespasses and ease the regrets of others.and crucified Him.

0385338686|4.0|Another cute, silly story from Sophie Kinsella.  The main character, Samantha Sweeting, has the same quirky personality as Becky Bloomwood in the Shopaholic books.  Fast and fun read.  If you're looking for a thoughtful book, this is not the book for you.  However, if you are looking for a quick, no-brainer, look no further!

B00008BXJG|5.0|night prowler is the best ac/dc song there ever was, to me anyways... i love brian johnson's voice alot, and its hard to say who's better bon or brian. cause they are both my favorites. but thats another story. this is one of the best albums of all time. highway to hell and back in black are my top picks by ac/dc. the whole album is awsome.
B000ETQRCM|5.0|I'm an old guy whose resume' includes seeing Little Richard live in 1956, Led Zepplin in 1969 and Patti Smith in 2003. After the great Patti Smith concert I planned on retiring from rock shows and just purchase cds such as Prairie Wind [Neil Young]. You know, just kind of fade off into the wistful melancholy rock suitable for someone my age. Well through some form of resurrection synchronicity I followed the suggestion of a music store employee that I should hear the new Pearl Jam even though she knew I almost never purchased hard rock and that I did not own any of their previous cds. Well so much for retirement from live performances. I will try to see this band even if I have to struggle through the drama that an arena or stadium venue will impose on my old bones. I know that Pearl Jam is known for great live shows. In  regard to the cd which I am supposed to be reviewing here, I have about 10 cds that at the time of their release I considered to be the best album I had heard in my life. Today that is how I feel about this new Pearl Jam cd. This album [and yes it is an ALBUM] rocks with a combination of fury, intelligence and visceral beauty that would be hard to match by any other band. I would not delete one track if I were to transfer this to an Ipod. It will be a long time before I hear a new release and I say &#34;this is the best album I have heard in my life&#34;.
B000002JS6|5.0|all i can say is back in black is the best album of all time by ac/dc, every fan has a favorite by them and this is mine...
B000093BDX|5.0|Finally, a comprehensive look at the Beach Boys that covers all the bases.  'Endless Summer,' one of the best titled compilations, and 'Good Vibrations' both have considerable merits, but 'Sounds of Summer,' and the subtitle, 'The Very Best of The Beach Boys' both live up to the collection's names.  Every essential song is included:  \\"Good Vibrations,\\" \\"Fun, Fun, Fun,\\" \\"Surfin' Safari,\\" and \\"I Get Around\\" to name very few.  This time, however, we get at least two ethereal songs seldom put on the same disc, including the essential classics, \\"Don't Worry Baby\\" and \\"In My Room\\".  Generosity is extended with the 'Pet Sounds' classics \\"Sloop John B,\\" \\"God Only Knows,\\" and \\"Wouldn't It Be Nice\\".  Wisely, there are lesser songs that are added, too, like the title track of 'Wild Honey,' \\"Do It Again,\\" and \\"Heroes and Villains\\" (from the ill-fated and fabled 'Smile' album).  There are also minor hits that are fabulous, such as \\"Dance, Dance, Dance,\\" \\"When I Grow Up to Be a Man,\\" and \\"Be True to Your School\\".  The seventies are well represented with a fine cover \\"I Hear Music,\\" and a so-so, but popular cover of \\"Rock and Roll Music\\" (a song propelled no doubt by a resurgence of interest in the band during the mid-seventies).      On the other hand, while the selection is impeccable for a CD, the sequence is somewhat flawed. It is understandable that \\"Good Vibrations,\\" their multi-layered magnum opus, is chosen to be the final song, but it is less appealing to go in sequence into the seventies; then back up again into the sixties.  Perhaps they could have retained the first two-fifths; then taken the rest of the sixties; continue with the seventies; and finish with \\"Good Vibrations\\" after their last number one, \\"Kokomo,\\" a surprising and good 1988 hit. (The first portion of the C.D., however, proves that it doesn't have to be compiled in a strictly chronological order, either.)      Despite some particular criticisms, 'Sounds of Summer' is a magnificent summer celebration of The Beach Boys' music.  Since there have been more collections than original albums, maybe the perfect CD is still in the making.  This one comes remarkably close.
B00009V7P8|5.0|I first heard Damien Rice in 2003 when he was one of the new CD's you could listen to at Tower Records.  The first song, Delicate brought tears to my eyes with its melodic cello played brilliantly and the song was sung without holding back the emotion that obviously inspired the song.   <br /> <br />That's what this CD is all about.  A songwriter who knows how to write lyrics and can match it and expand upon the feeling with the music.  Damien Rice and Lisa Harrigan sing one duet after another with perfection. Her voice is the female equivalent of his voice, with all the passion infused and exposed though her emotion is much more demure.  She is a huge part of the CD. I was happy when Herbie Hancock's great collection \\"Possibilities\\" included a duet of Damien Rice and Lisa Hannigan.   <br /> <br />If you're thinking about buying this CD, just stop thinking and buy it. It's a classic already.  His challenge is to come up with something as a follow up now that the expectations have been raised so high with this great work.
B000F3TBIO|4.0|I bought this album the day it came out.  It usually takes me awhile to fully love an album.  I listen to it non-stop, then I take a break from it, then I start listening to it again to gain a fresh perspective. I realize that the critics get an early copy, but I don't know how they can properly review an album on just a few listens.  My first instinct was that Don't Even Trip was the weakest song on the album, and though I've gained greater appreciation for the song on repeated listens I stand by that instinct.  Five Seconds is the best by far.  The refrain, counting seconds backwards from five, make me want to run through a wall.  I recently saw Peeping Tom in concert, and that song was the standout for me.  Capirinha is my second favorite song.  It's a sultry tune that reminds one of Sade or Maria Muldaur's Midnight at the Oasis.  How U Feeling is the one that crept on me.  I've only recently started getting into this song.  Then there's Mojo.  Another excellent concert song, but if you're reading this I'm guessing you already know this one.  I'm not sure why Pre School was left off the album, because it is far better than Celebrity Death Match and Don't Even Trip. As another reviewer said, seek this song out.  You'll love it. Kill the DJ is a good song, great beginning, average refrain and the ending drags a little.  Getaway is a little disappointing, but it's better than 100% of the songs lining up on Billboard charts. Sucker is awesome, but I'm not one of those who is awestruck by the use of cursewords when used in a song--even when they are sung by Norah Jones.  I've always found swear words a distraction from the beauty of a song, but artists feel a need to add them to give their listeners a sense of the artist's rage against the machine.   <br /> <br />I've read some reviewers claim that the lyrics aren't up to Patton's usual standards.  While I will admit some of them are cheesy, and some of the (Will and Grace?) lyrics are downright stupid, Patton's musichas never been about the lyrics.  The lyrics have always been a secondary concern to the man.  His lyrics are written to flow with the music.   <br /> <br />Overall, the album doesn't kill like some of the projects that Patton has taken part in.  If you're wondering, I'm talking about his Mr. Bungle albums California and Disco Volante and his Faith no More album Angel Dust.  Having said that, this is probably a better place to start for the uninitiated.  Once you've spun those CDs a couple hundred times, check out the rest of his Faith no More work, the Mr. Bungle album, the Tomahawk work, his Fantomas work, his Lovage work, and the various other projects to which he's lended his vocal skills such as on the John Zorn projects.  You will not be disappointed.
0966638328|5.0|Any new project I have, this is the first book to come out. It's great for everything from inspiration to seeing colors put together to working with clients!<br /><br />I personally love color and am able to just look at swatches and figure out what I want and what goes good together; however, most of my clients are intimidated by everything from color to fonts, etc. This book makes it easy and fun to sit with them to pick colors. This is a friendly book and it takes the intimidation away from looking at color swatches.<br /><br />My only complaint with this book is that the Pantone conversations in the back of the book are no where near accurate. Use the book for its strengths and get the conversations from PhotoShop and save yourself a lot of headaches!

B000E6GBV2|4.0|When I first heard of Band of Horses I never really thought to myself that I should go out and buy the cd. Maybe it was the boring cd cover, or the weird band name (similar to Horse the Band), or just the fact that I thought there was better stuff to be boughten. But, given time, and a view of the Letterman show when they played. I first thought to myself, \\"they sound exactly like My Morning Jacket, the same reverb on the voice, same beat on drums, same guitar.\\" A couple weeks later I watched their performance on Letterman again on some random blog and I realized that this band was really good. I then bought the cd, and have been listening to it ever since. It does sound a lot like My Morning Jacket, but in my mind they are better because Band of Horses talks about death, and depression. With that and the music, it makes a great mix.<br /><br />The songs that stand out the most are \\"The First Song\\", \\"The Funeral\\", \\"Weed Party\\", and \\"St. Augustine\\". \\"The First Song\\" is, coincidently, the first track on the cd, and it comes in with epic guitar and vocals. \\"The Funeral\\" is the bands saddest song and lines like \\"At every occasion, I'm ready for a funeral\\" stand out the most. \\"Weed Party\\" is the most fun song and also upbeat, and \\"St. Augustine\\" leaves the cd on a soft note, but in a good way.<br /><br />This is a good cd, and I was surprised.
B000GIWS7E|5.0|My friend and I flew to NY from TX that weekend just for this concert. <br />It was worth every penny of it. The production was top class and it was the first time DT performs with an orcestra. <br /> <br />Radio City Hall is magnificent and perfect venue for DT to perform. Many people including me do not necessary agree with the song list, but I was still blown away with their technical ability as we all know they are capable of. <br /> <br />I cannot wait to buy the DVD to watch many things that I missed during the show.
B000002OMN|5.0|Love all of Meat Loaf's songs. The DVD Live with the Melboune Symphony Orchestra is a must see. Wish he had more DVD's to watch.
B000063DFQ|1.0|This is music (!) for little children. <br />MOVE ON, ACT YOUR AGE! This horror freak show may be fun for teenagers but it eventually MUST become boring if you're healthy! <br /> <br />The same chord progressions, the same kind of guitar solo, the same basic (yeap, basic) bass chops. <br /> <br />Open your minds and try to find something really woth listening to...
B00005JO9J|1.0|If I had wanted to watch a slightly upbeat and younger ER...well...I wouldn't. And that's why I gave up on this peice of junk! (to be fair, I did watch most of the episodes rather than just watching one and baging it). <br /> <br />The show spends far too much time on the personal lives of the characters...I mean it might just be a misunderstanding, but I was lead to believe that these characters were doctors...am I wrong? They are the most unpassable doctor characters I have ever come across in a TV series. If I wanted humour and drama in a medical series, I would watch House, because at least the cases are interesting and the people intricate puzzles. If I wanted just the humour, I would watch Scrubs. <br /> <br />In essence, if they were curing the bubonic plague on this show, then people might find it worth watching...otherwise, avoid like the plague.
1577314808|5.0|This book has really helped me to open my eyes to a newer style of thinking.  The title DOES say it all!!!!  Living in the power of the now has helped me to eliminate unneccesary stress from my life.  I would definately reccomend this book to ANYONE!!!  There is a lot of detail into the mind and phrasing which makes it easy for anyone to read!!!!  This book is WELL worth the price!!!  After all, you can't put a price on a stress-free life!!!!
0735619670|5.0|I don't know how much more I can say about this book that hasn't been said already but I will do my best to describe my experience with this book.    Have you ever looked at a class, or a method that seems to work fine but it just doesn't \\"feel\\" right? For some reason it seems as if that method or class may be hard to debug in the future or that the code is hard to understand. Or have you gone back to a class file you wrote months ago and you spend an awful lot of time trying to figure out what the heck is going on with that class file? Maybe the methods in the class are spaghetti like in nature, or maybe the names of your methods don't have a very good description so it's hard to figure out how everything ties together. I have had this problem. This book will teach you how to get out of those habits. You will learn what a solid class or method looks like. You will learn how properly naming your classes and methods can greatly reduce complexity in the long run. Everything is backed by hard evidence. I should also mention that this is just one chapter in this wonderful book.    This book really drills down proper programming practices. A lot of times you may read a passage and think to yourself \\"well, of course!\\"... but then you realize you don't practice what's contained in the passage you just read. This book is great for both new programmers and experienced programmers alike. New programmers benefit greatly because they will learn how to construct software properly without having to go through all of the hoops. Experienced programmers will also learn a great deal, as well as be reminded that some of their habits that they've developed over the years can hinder production and cause software development to become more complex then it really is.     Steve writes in a very clean style. It's very easy to read. You don't need to memorize anything in a book like this, instead you just need to gain an understanding of the concepts he brings forth. After reading this bookI definitely follow a lot of his advice. When I build a new class, method or what-have-you I get a certain feeling of when it seems right and when something seems wrong. I am now much better at analyzing my code and figuring out what doesn't seem correct and I take his advice I learned in this book to help me to figure out - and correct the problem. After reading this book I feel like a lot of my rough edges as a developer have been rounded out. I feel as if I gained a years worth of experience just by reading this book.    This book is friendly for any software developer. The concepts he presents apply to all languages. This is a book that teaches you how to think about programming better and how to construct good solid code. This is one of the best books I've ever read. If you're even thinking about buying this book, then buy it.
0553579908|5.0|Reading some of the reviews people have said that this book is a great continuation of the series or that it is a good sequel but not as good as the first or that it's a prelude of what's to come (where the first book was an introduction) but to be honest... Clash of Kings isn't any of those things.<br /><br />It's just a really, really good novel.<br /><br />Sure, it's a continuation of the series. Sure it's a sequel. But that's like saying Empire Strikes Back was just a continuation of the Star Wars saga and that Godfather II was just a good sequel. This book, like those movies, transcends such identification.<br /><br />Clash of Kings is a great novel, hands down. It brings you a cast of characters (sometimes very long - do not be afraid to use the appendix in the back) that are utterly real and sets them in motion. Unlike a lot of fantasy, the characters are not moved by plot but plot is by characters. And what amazing characters they are! From Tyrion the Imp to Bran the cripple to the heartache of Sansa and the plight of her mother and the arrogance of Theon Greyjoy - man, you can't say that these are cookie cutter characters! These are flesh and blood men and women. And their horrors, joys, and adventures are as real to us as any great novel should be!<br /><br />George R. R. Martin is an amazing novelist. He gives us fantasy in its most brutal and unbelievable form. This verisimilitude makes the most fantastic elements of the books (Stannis' shadow, the dragons, Bran's \\"link\\") seem just as real.<br /><br />And before I go, I have to mention how fantastic some of the scenes in the book are. There are certain segments that are written so well, so vivid, that you can just imagine them as if they were up on the movie screen. I know this will be a book that will stick with me for many years to come and I know that I will be happily leaping into the third book just as soon as I get home and find it on my shelf!<br /><br />Long live the King, George R. R. Martin!. Martin!
0743490304|3.0|I thought this book was very thought provoking in terms of how it is possible for a politician to think too much of himself. I really did enjoy this book and the descriptions of military technology, but I'm pretty darn sure that any Delta force soldier would not blindly obey orders and kill US Citizens if it didn't make sense. Some of the kills made by members of the Delta Force in this book made it seem like they can not think on their own.
B00004SZWD|5.0|I'm one of those reviewers that rarely rates music that hasn't touched me in one way or another. So when I felt that I wanted to write a review for a Stevie Wonder album, I ended up struggling over which of his great releases I should review. I love ALL of his mid-seventies releases....most notably, \\"Innervisions\\", \\"Fullfillingness...\\", and, of course, \\"Songs...\\". I guess I finally decided to 'tackle' this one based on its historical significance to the art of Music. For one, Stevie was \\"coming into his own\\" as far as musical expression and social commentary within his songs. Other than the great Bob Marley and Marvin Gaye, Stevie was at the forefront of writing about the joys, pains, positives and negatives of Human exsistance on Earth...and he did it very well. Songs such as \\"Village Ghetto Land\\", \\"Pastime Paradise\\", \\"Saturn\\" and \\"Have a Talk with God\\" among others, were as powerful 'messages' one could experience through a set of speakers. Secondly, He was able to finally gain TOTAL control of his musical vision from Motown and Berry Gordy....even more so than Marvin had done with \\"Whats Going On\\"...and this TOTAL control shows most prevelant on \\"Songs\\" than any previous release leading up to this one(IMO). There's certainly a little bit of everything on \\"Songs\\"---- the joy of life on \\"Isn't She Lovely\\";  black man's contributions to evolution in \\"Black Man\\"; World Love and Peace in \\"I am Singing\\"; the joys and pains of childhood in \\"I Wish\\"; Spiritual guidance in \\"Have a talk with God\\"; Desperation in the World's Ghettos in \\"Village Ghetto Land\\" , and even some \\"Props\\" to Mr. Ellington in \\"Sir Duke\\". One could literally go on like this for every song on this double album....Yes, very moving, significant statements indeed! As for the actual music and musicians, they are \\"all over the board\\" here (and Stevie certainly plays his share of the instruments, however, not as exstinsively as past albums). Every musician involved in \\"Songs\\" played exactly what each trackcalled for, and, at the same time, still managed to put their 'mark' on these great cuts. The listener will be happy to find mellow, introspective songs...Upbeat, funky rockers...Spanish-tinged music....and even Stevie's brand of Fushion (Contusion)... Overall, A wonderful assortment of musical styles and genres mixed into one of the most important double LPs ever released. As a closing note, I am somewhat of a new-comer to this great artist, and yes, I am white. However, I feel this is one of a handful of artists that crosses/bridges ALL ethnic groups...weather black, white, yellow, or red. Please don't let the color of your skin (or Stevie's) stop you from experiencing some of the most important 'Art' ever produced. Strongly recommended, along with any other releases from this Genius!
0393317552|4.0|well writen for the most part. A little too meticulous at some points,and repetitive. The author fails to address or at least answer to my satisfaction some questions regarding scientific discovery. The author devoted more pages to putting the natives of New Guinea on a pedestal than to the european exploitation of steel and implementation of firearms. You can judge which has had more impact on world history. I would have rather read more about guns and steel than about The native new guinea culture.
B0002SROT0|5.0|First of all, let me start of by saying I am a huge fan of Elliott Smith since his basement four-track recordings of \\"Roman Candle\\" down to his upbeat \\"Figure 8\\" album. Being that this is the last Elliott Smith record to ever be released (outside of the chance that a b-side will be released) this record didn't dissapoint me in the least bit. <br /> <br />It starts off with the track \\"Coast to Coast\\", which happens to be my favorite on the whole record. First of all, it doesn't sound like what Elliott would make, but in a good way, it's a change for the better, and he's brilliant at expierementing and trying new sounds. That song starts of like a punch in the stomach but when the track is over it descends into this beautiful happy kind of high song, \\"Let's Get Lost\\", which I think will be a a favorite for everyone that listens to this album. <br /> <br />Though those songs may be good, I think \\"King's Crossing\\" and \\"Fond Farewell\\" definetly hit it home. Those songs, you can tell are so gut wrechingly personal it was like you were there with him just watching him spill everything he had to the song. His everlong struggle of finally kicking Heroin to the curb, those two songs are just so eye-opening, you have to listen to each lyric and each word and rewind it numerous times just to make sure you heard what you just heard. <br /> <br />Elliott never ceases to amaze me, I think we lost someone so imperfectly perfect, someone so unassuming of their own talent, someone with a beautiful way of expressing even the most vulgar of subjects. 5 Stars.
087349976X|5.0|Very good book for wire work!  The instructions are pretty easy to understand and the pictures are very helpful.  The jewelry in the book is beautiful!  <br /> <br />I am fairly new to wire work and I was able to do one of the advanced pieces in about an hour.
0312995423|2.0|I'll give Dan a break on this book by giving him two stars. The book is very fast paced, but while it is fast to read it lacks technical accuracy. Much of the encryption technology discussed in the book is just plain wrong. In addition, the book compares some encryption technology with compression technology, which didn't make any sense to me at all. Over all, the initial concept of this book which states there is an unbreakable encryption technology is true and in use today.
B000E41MS6|5.0|My only quibble with this excellent series is Christopher Eccleston's wardrobe.  It's too stylish and tasteful.  All the previous Doctors have had a quirky (not to say loud and garish) mode of dress, and each had a signature accessory.  Tom Baker's scarf, for example, or Peter Davison's stalk of celery worn as a boutonniere.  Now here comes Christopher Eccleston, slim and elegant in basic black.  Where's the fun in that? <br />    That said, I thought Christopher Eccleston's doctor was wonderful--his manic persona overlaid a very real sense of haunted tragedy.  Rose was a feisty heroine who could more than hold her own.  She saved the Doctor at least as often as he saved her!  I'm only sorry that Eccleston left after only one season.  DOCTOR WHO is only improved by having an actor of his caliber playing the lead.
B000GCFO0I|1.0|Yes this movie is certainly better than any other video game film ever made, but its really not that great anyway.  I really wasnt expecting much though, so i wasnt surprised when they completely destroyed the plot and tried to explain everything to the dumb american audiences who can only understand sarcasm and irony, half of the time at that.  Bottom line they took away what made silent hill so great, the unexplained, the surreal, and the atmosphere. But hey if you like movies like Saving Silverman and Donnie Darko than you'll no dought love this movie.
0140288503|5.0|Mr. Bowden is one of the greatest authors dealing with documentaries on this subject. Again, he descibes in detail what happened on the ground on that dreadful operation and soldiers that read this can clearly see the lessons learned in comparison to modern day operations. Mr. Bowdens ability to describe in articulate detail gives the reader the twisted feeling of actually being shot at without the rounds whizzing by your head. I truly couldnt put this book down!!!!
B000F7CMRM|4.0|Great film, especially with what is going on in the Middle-East.  I recommend it to everyone.
0060516402|3.0|I don't have much to say about this book.  I am finishing reading it now; it took me 2 years off and on to finish it.  It seemed like more of a chore to read than Good to Great, which is funny because I had to read Good to Great for a class and I am reading Built to Last \\"for fun\\".   <br />It's a good business book, their research and conclusion makes sense, and their are some good stories about the various companies in there.  However, the book is dry at times, which makes it hard and not very enjoyable to read.   <br />If you want to learn about the prequel to Good to Great, read this.  It's a good book.  But, if you're looking for something entertaining to read, you probably need to find something else: read Good to Great if you haven't read that or go to the fiction section.
B00004STPT|2.0|It's really amazing.  <br />Ah, not the score itself, no, what I mean is: this score is now 6 years old, and it sounds like Hans Zimmer recorded it yesterday. And in case you don't notice, this is not a compliment. <br />I listen to \\"Am I Not Merciful\\", and I hear Da Vinci Code and Batman Begins. <br />I listen to \\"Barbarian Horde\\", and all I can think of is Pirates Of The Caribbean. <br />Alright, this is not really a point against this soundtrack, since the scores mentioned above came after Gladiator, but an inevitable fact remains - Zimmer obviously isn't able to create an original score even if his life depended on it. His music for ancient Rome sounds just like his music for a superhero, a mystery thriller or pirates. <br />And here's another fact: this score doesn't fit the picture. Yes, the structure of Roman music is unknown, but I doubt that it consisted of synth bass, synth horns and synth orchestral crashes. Yes, Hans, we know you don't care about the individual atmospheres of the films you score, but do you have to make it that obvious? <br />And Zimmer's original material for Gladiator isn't even his own. Other composers also take bits and pieces from classical masters, but Zimmer's use is so blatant that he got himself a lawsuit from the Gustav Holst foundation. <br /> <br />Then let's talk about the orchestration. Frankly, I'm tired of bringing this up in every Zimmer review, but he forces me. I will tell you what I think: Hans Zimmer has no clue about how to use the orchestra, much less how to properly combine it with synths. That's why every score of his makes a 100 piece orchestra sound like a 9 piece school band. <br />He figured out the basics of how the string sections can be combined, and now he slaps it onto every score he does. <br />Everyone who had basic musical education in school and does some research in the web can write like this. I must know because I do. And I had no formal musical training whatsoever. <br />No wonder Zimmer's musicsounds so monotone when he doesn't take advantage of the woodwind sections at all, which further proofs my point about Zimmer not understanding the orchestral apparatus at all. He rarely lets different sections interact, but this is what can make music sound diverse. His music here isn't diverse, it's pale and faceless. <br />The wailing female voice by Lisa Gerrard is indeed the only thing that evokes a wee bit of atmosphere, although her lines seem barely written at all. <br /> <br />I'm not saying Ben- Hur or Spartacus or King Of Kings or El Cid hit the right tone for ancient Rome, but at least these were done by skillful musicians who could write, expand and orchestrate an original tune. <br />I've heard numerous times that Hans Zimmer is an experimental composer; this is the most ridiculous joke I've ever heard about the film scoring industry. There's nothing experimental about his music, Gladiator or any other score, it's just the same thing in a new package. His former ghostwriters, who were able to detach themselves from Zimmer, like Harry- Gregson Williams or John Powell, have become far more creative than Zimmer has ever been. <br />All Zimmer did was make synthesized music that could be produced without any originality within two weeks the idustry's standard. <br />And that harmed the fine art film scoring used to be more than anything that ever happened within the past 50 years. And Gladiator was a huge part of that because it elevated Zimmer to the level of popularity he is on right now. <br /> <br />And Gladiator seems to be the score that Zimmer constantly revisits to take bits and pieces from, just to flesh them out and sell them as scores for other films. Gladiator combines all Zimmer scores that followed it, and aren't all Zimmer scores of the past 6 years combined worth 2 stars? <br /> <br />But who knows how many composers really worked on Gladiator.
B0000A36J5|2.0|The 1st 2 shipments that i received for the LOTR - The 2 Towers was disappointing.

B000C65Z1G|4.0|This movie is a tale that could happen, and that makes it compelling. The anti-drug company message is a little overbearing, but it works.<br /><br />Certainly, there are evil corporations in the world, and the plot is mostly plausible. On the whole, it's easy to believe that the events portrayed in the movie could occur - after all, the U.S. government has numerous times experimented on its own citizens. Look up the Tuskegee Experiment for an example. There are a thousand other examples of government doing evil to its own citizens. That's why I was kept spellbound throughout.<br /><br />The acting and cinematography are gorgeous. The African settings were wonderful and felt authentic.<br /><br />This is a murder mystery with an underdog hero and an ending that will leave you in a very meditative state of reflection on your own humanity. How do you treat those around you? This is a good flick with lots of inneundo and gripping drama. The characters feel like real people and I like that.

0790729342|5.0|`The Road Warrior', directed by Kennedy - Miller, and starring Mel Gibson, is one of those movies which seemed to appear out of nowhere and become, much to critics' embarrassed admission, an important work of fantasy / science fiction / adventure, thereby making its title actor into an important cinema star.<br /><br />The importance of `The Road Warrior' has grown with the years, as it has spawned numerous imitators, most especially Kevin Costner's `Waterworld', none of which are quite as good as the original. Even the sequel, `Mad Max, Beyond Thunderdome', with its higher production values, iconic presence of Tina Turner as the primary heavy, and somewhat more interesting story manages to quite match the raw impact of `The Road Warrior'.<br /><br />Most of the movie's success may be due to the same effective mix of two or more genres that we see in `Alien' and `Blade Runner'. While both have strong elements of science fiction, where the back story is driven by a fictional scientific premise, which the authors run with to see what may happen, if only .... And yet, these two movies are more the traditional horror movie and the traditional thriller, but elevated to a higher level by the great mix of qualities.<br /><br />Of course, `The Road Warrior' is itself a sequel to the original `Mad Max', however the connection is tenuous both in story line and in shared back story. I was never really sure `Mad Max' was really supposed to be happening in some post-apocalyptic Australian world (told by survivors of an `On The Beach'), or just in a run-down corner of Australia, which happens to be experiencing a bit more motorcycle gang outlawry. The mythic road warrior character certainly shares enough in common with Max of the first movie to see a continuity, but unlike movies like `The Matrix' trilogy and the `Lord of the Rings' series, one looses nothing from `The Road Warrior' if you did not see `Mad Max'.<br /><br />Just as `The Road Warrior' may be borrowing some cachet from `On The Beach', it also seems to owe something to `Lord of the Flies', another `lets see what happens in a post-nuclear holocaust' movie. One can interpret this as the way things end up if the lost boys of `Lord of the Flies' grew up and got wheels.<br /><br />And, unlike `Mad Max, Beyond Thunderdome', `The Road Warrior' benefits from a very simple story, exquisitely scripted, if not to excellently acted by the supporting cast.<br /><br />Just like `A Hard Days' Night', `The Road Warrior' manages to transcend the conventions of its genre, the say way as an Andy Warhol silk screen of a Campbell's Soup can turns something ordinary into art, thereby becoming a new paradigm of artistic expression, to be imitated by its successors.cachet from `On The Beach', it also seems to owe something to `Lord of the Flies', another `lets see what happens in a post-nuclear holocaust' movie.

B000FGGE5Y|2.0|The film is cinematically gorgeous but way too unbelievable to be enjoyable. If I wanted to imagine a dark near future scenario, I could have done way better than this.<br /><br />Ultraviolet is a film about a babe who is also a killing machine. She lives in a fantasy \\"near-future\\" world run by a technocratic pseudopriest and divided between humans and those infected with an unbelievable virus that has turned them into superstrong, superfast \\"vampires.\\"<br /><br />I had a hard time not falling asleep because the entire premise of the movie is silly and the action is so over the top it bored me. The only thing that kept me awake and paying marginal attention is Milla Jovovich.<br /><br />The only reason I can see to watch the movie is if you're obssessed with her. I'm not, but she kept my attention on the screen - barely.
B00024I2Z4|3.0|There is lots to love about Mulan. A wonderful score, great animation, lots of good vocal talent. <br /> <br />The biggest area in which the movie fails, however, is the scriptwriters' irritating overuse of comic relief. They have a tendency to interrupt scenes quite inappropriately for  <br />Eddie Murphy or Harvey Fierstein to deliver gags. It gets immensely tiresome. I'm divided as to whether this is worth three stars or four; but I'm opting for three.
B0009A40ES|4.0|The story of Patrick Bateman, the serial killer of Bret Easton Ellis 1991 novel, seen through the eyes of a woman director. Would this have been the same movie if it was done by a man? It probably wouldn't. And that's a good thing.<br /><br />There's black comedy, satire and gore in equal proportions. The way violence is shown to - or kept from - the viewer reminded me of \\"Reservoir Dogs\\" in the way that the camera slightly deviates from the target forcing us to imagine exactly what's happening right there. Andrezj Sekula cinematography struck me as particularly good as it perfectly resembles that 80s look and feel in a picture that's been released in 2000.<br /><br />And then there's a brilliant performance by Christian Bale, one of the best serial killer impersonations I've ever seen and Bale's best acting ever if it wasn't for stuff like \\"The Machinist\\" which would come later in his career. What's really difficult about doing a serial killer role is not exactly the killings but rather, and very much so in this case, the downward spiral of their mind. Bateman is a victim of the mid to late 80s lust in America, Wall Street in particular, like all of his colleagues. He's just gone a little bit overboard (this is obviously an understatement but you get my point). His insanity is in fact a by product of his lifestyle. There's this scene where Bateman, in a state of complete despair, admits all his crimes to his lawyer over the phone which is utterly brilliant and Bale nails it.<br /><br />The final stages of the film are kind of open, lending themselves to different interpretations and personally I prefer having to rethink the whole film under a different light after I've seen it.
B000FP2OPY|5.0|Nowadays it's not easy to captivate the atention of the audience. Writers have to be more creative than ever to produce stories that will really entertain an audience eager for better shows every day.<br /><br />Supernatural is not the typical spooky series. It can be as believable as this topic can endure with two maybe three very handsome stars in the lead. These are Sam, played by Jared Padalecki, whom many of us remember as Dean in Gilmore Girls; Dean, played by Jensen Ackles and finally, John Winchester, played by Jeffrey Dean Morgan. Too many Dean's ? Mere coincidence?<br /><br />Anyways, every episode is a story that range from mere ghosts and superstitions to the typical urban legends. But that would be only at the surface. The story around the Winchester's is what mantains the story going on smoothly. It all begins with he death of Mary Winchester and that's when John's real crusade starts. Now 20 years later, Dean and Sam Winchester have to follow their father's steps into the supernatural on their own.<br /><br />There's no doubt Supernatural is just excellent. It appeals to anybody, whether you like the stories, the characters, the actors, etc. one thing is sure, there are moments you're bound to be scared, maybe it'll be the Wendigo, or the Hookman, or Bloody Mary, but at some point you'll feel the chills.
B0002ZDVEU|5.0|I bought this DVD because I enjoyed the first one that came out and I also wanted this one to add to my collection! The service of the place I bought it from was excellent AND true to their word of quality of the product and delivery! I definitely shop with them again!

B000001GQR|5.0|--- and 5 stars for each of the remaining movements + 5 stars for Haydn. 25 Stars. <br /> <br />Yes, Virginia, there really is an Alexander von Pitimac. A Google search finally yielded a Great C Major with the Munich Phil. available (perhaps no longer) on a German label. For those who care to search, it may be buried treasure, but much more than treasure is buried far more often. <br /> <br />This Furtwangler recording is what gave Yehudi Menuhin the nerve to begin his own conducting career. He was cajoled into conducting the Great C Major, and he resorted to this recording (then on Decca/London and DGG lps) while studying the score. Menuhin was the first \\"allied\\" artist to perform with Furtwangler after the war, and he admired him above all other conductors. <br /> <br />The string sonorities produced at the conclusion of the first movt. -- one phrase of the horn theme -- are unlike anything I've ever heard, in performance or on record. In the slow movement that follows, Furtwangler evokes the spirit of the Winterreise song cycle -- the song of the barefoot man in the snow immediately comes to mind. The range of moods and emotions to be experienced in this performance, through all 4 movements, are beyond description. <br /> <br />-- and then there is the Haydn No.88. another treasure to enjoy. <br /> <br />\\"Now, even potted palms might rejoice <br />To hear this counterpoint, these lambent chords. <br />The infinitely baffled speakers voice <br />A heart-to-heart that leaves me wanting words.\\" <br /> <br />-- from \\"The Listening Room\\" <br />
B000AL730O|5.0|I've been listening to Paul's music for awhile and have heard all of his albums and this is my favorite. Why? I guess because it IS darker. When this first came out, I was going through a pretty tough time and when I put it in and heard these songs, they just helped somehow. Looking back, I wonder if the darkness in this album had any connection to his marital struggles. There are not odes to his new wife like the songs from \\"Driving Rain.\\" It's not a bunch of chirpy love songs or weird experimentals. It's pretty much just, well, music. Paul sitting down, playing, and singing songs that he wrote. It just all seems so very natural. For me, it is forever linked with the memory of a drive through the winding backroads of Vermont. And I think \\"This Never Happened Before\\" is one of the greatest love songs he ever wrote. I recommend playing this on a cool day while sipping a cup of tea. Is it a coincidence that one of the songs is called \\"English Tea\\"?

B00005JNJV|4.0|This is Batman back to basics. The unique and great thing about the Batman mythology is that he is not a Super Hero; other comics heroes have some super natural power butBatman is a regular human who suffered and continues to suffer and who is trying to avenge his suffering. This movie brings Batman back to that circle of the human factor and focuses more on the human side of Batman unlike the other fluffy Batman movies.<br /><br />Being a long time Batman reader and fan I recommend this movie.
B00004X01U|3.0|The release of Ray Of Light in 1998 catapulted Madonna straight to the top of the charts, while proving to the critics that the chameleon of pop had not lost her staying power. Ray Of Light managed to sell over 15 million copies and generated hits such as Ray Of Light, Frozen, The Power Of Goodbye, Doesn't Really Matter and Drowned World/Substitute For Love. Yet by 2000, Madonna released her follow-up, Music, to her alleged comeback album Ray Of Light. The anticipation was enormous, yet everybody wanted to know whether or not she would be able to outdo the masterpiece Ray Of Light. Naturally, Madonna couldn't live up to the high expectations. And she didn't have to. Many were perhaps hoping for Ray Of Light's love-child, yet imagine an album sounding almost identical to Ray Of Light? Where is the fun in that? Despite not matching the success of Ray Of Light, Music did extremely well, selling over 10 millions and entering the number 1 slot in respectively the US and the UK. <br /> <br />Madonna has always been excellent at spotting trends before they become truly mainstream (the truth is probably that she has people informing her of the upcoming trends), and the supposed cowboy-look had everybody wearing cowboy-hats like there was no tomorrow. Yet the style of the Music album was leaned more in the direction of pop and dance. The intention of the Music album was to get people on the floor and did it ever! `'Hey Mr. DJ put a record on/I wanna dance/With my baby''/ starts off the album's title track, soon revealing the heavy dance-beat with strange lyrics accompanying it. The sound was surely different from anything Madonna had ever had her hands out, yet it managed to hit the top spot in the UK, establishing that Madonna's new-found style was a hit among the record-buying public. Undoubtedly an underrated hymn, Impressive Instant deserves all the praise heading its way. Performed on the Drowned World Tour, its popularity was massive as the audience loved the song. Thesong is quite gloomy, yet the trance-like sound has everyone stunned. Definitely worthy of a single release, but even more interesting would have been the music video for the song. Runaway Lover is perhaps one of the weaker songs, I could imagine someone like Britney Spears singing the song, however I don't think it suits Madonna very well - probably a matter of taste. I Deserve It is a slow-paced mid-tempo offering which appears to be a token to her husband, while also acknowledging her own success. <br /> <br />The William Orbit production Amazing sounds almost identical to the theme of The Spy Who Shagged Me, Beautiful Stranger. Amazing is by no means a bad song, however compared to Beautiful Stranger, Amazing doesn't hold a candle to the sassy song. The William Orbit productions on Music are, in my opinion, the weakest, they are simply not as good as the Mirwais productions which is one of the reasons why this album only manages to receive 3-3½ stars from this reviewer. Nobody's Perfect is a slow-down mid-tempo, revealing that despite being Madonna - she is not perfect and nobody is!! The pop-country inspired song Don't Tell Me rocketed to the top of the charts, landing Madonna a top 10 hit in both the US and the UK. Undoubtedly, a Madonna classic and the best track on the album. Madonna is no stranger to controversy and she certainly proved capable of pushing everyone's buttons, as she portrayed herself as a raving lunatic in the video for What It Feels Like For A Girl. The video version was quite different from the song appearing on the Music album. The album version was a mid-tempo hymn, whereas the video version had been remixed into a wild dance mix - quite suiting for the outrageous behaviour of the heroine in the music video. I prefer the softer version as I think it conveys the overall message much better than the single-version. Paradise (Not For Me), a Mirwais production, sees Madonna speaking French. Yep, it is not a hoax!! Despite the use of vocoder effects, the song peeks one's interest from the very start. The sway-ish emotion created throughout the song keeps you interested despite the lengthy time. Gone begins with an acoustic guitar and Madonna's voice accompanying each other. A lovely song, yet not very memorable! <br />  <br />Madonna has always managed to generate buzz and interest concerning her music releases and her persona. The anticipation for her Music album was massive and Madonna didn't disappoint. However, it is no secret that Music isn't Madonna's best album, but it is a well-round effort. Despite the weak William Orbit productions such as Runaway Lover and Amazing, there are several stunning tracks on the record such as Music, Impressive Instant, Don't Tell Me, Paradise (Not For Me) and I Deserve It. Overall, Music is worth a listen if you like Madonna's recent music within the last couple of years. <br /> <br />Overall Rating: 7/10  <br />
B000003TA4|5.0|Just stop it! Stop comparing Nirvana to your precious Led Zeppelin or whatever legendary rock band you can think of. Half of you people only pretend to like those bands because it makes you look \\"cool\\" and the other half are just stuck so far up their butts that they go around bashing other bands they deem \\"unworthy\\". Nirvana cannot compete with them because of its short lifespan, OK? So all of you people just go back to your room and listen to Led Zeppelin instead of that nasty little Nirvana band. <br /> <br />Onto the review... <br /> <br />Nevermind, while Nirvana's most mainstream album, is still a good listen. This one of those albums where you can't really analyze the lyrics, because that will only confuse you. However, the musical talent of Kurt and co. is superb. It can make up for the lyrics easily. Dave's drumming is beyond words. Novoselic's bass lines are great. And Kurt gives us some memorable riffs as well, with a great \\"grunge voice\\", I guess you could put it. <br /> <br />And please, let's not shout that we hope Kurt burns in Hell. One, it's not very nice, and two, it's very childish. And to stab back at the comments on how he was just a druggie, that's like saying a bird has feathers, or the sky is blue. Think about it. Almost EVERY great rock band has had at least one member that did drugs. I'm sure if you cared to look, you'd find drug problems to be common amoung classic rock and roll bands. Bottom line: So your point would be....?     <br /> <br />Just get the album and enjoy, OK?
B00099BRUO|5.0|This was my first experience with Manowar, and I am impressed.  Their lyrics are somewhat untraditional with heavy references to Nordic mythology and history.  However, most of the tracks have a driving, exciting feel that really pump you up as you listen. <br /> <br />My favorite track on this CD is \\"Call to Arms\\".  It's a rallying song that would be great either playing games (where I first heard it), or say, starting a sporting event.  \\"Warriors of the World\\" also has this feel of getting everyone all riled up for something exciting to happen. <br /> <br />However there are also some calmer tracks on the CD, some of which are instrumental.  One song, \\"Nessun Dorma\\" is done entirely in Italian with an operatic feel, and is a tribute to the mother of one of the band members.  Needless to say, it is not metal at all. <br /> <br />If you were unfamiliar with the group, a first listen of this CD would probably make you think that not all these songs were performed by the same band.  This CD is a showcase of the many talents of this group, because they can make both awesome and beautiful music at will. <br /> <br />Not only are they talented musicians, but contrary to a lot of metal groups, they can also sing as well as scream. <br /> <br />I would encourage a first time listener to preview \\"Call to Arms\\".  If you don't feel awesome after hearing it, this CD may not be for you.
B000B0WODA|5.0|Although I'll admit I like the eponymous album a little better, I find this album a breath of fresh air to my somewhat-jaded soul.  I've seen FF on SNL and Austin City Limits; the lyrics blend very well with the music, and there's enough of the unexpected to keep me entertained.  I look forward to hearing a lot more from these guys!
B000FS9FCQ|5.0|Like The Matrix, \\"V\\" is ultimately about ideas, symbols and questions.  It deftly exposes fascism and the insidious nature of power, while causing the viewer to consider for themselves the issues of privacy, civil liberties, abuse of power, terrorism, resistance, and whether under similar conditions we would be willing to give up our freedoms to a tyranical regime in exchange for \\"protection\\".  Most of all it is a study in fear, and how it is used to manipulate us. <br /> <br />The actors hit their marks admirably, and the casting of Hugo Weaving (Agent Smith from The Matrix) as \\"V\\" is the ultimate in irony.  Additionally the plot, action and quirky Brittish setting are all \\"spot on\\". <br /> <br />If you enjoy movies that make you think, this will be one of the best movies you'll see this year. <br />
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I saw one show half way during its fist season and I was hooked. <br /> <br />It is one of those rare shows that is different yet makes sense and flows well.  It is like Star Trek meets the old west.  The writing is brilliant and the actors fit their parts perfect. <br /> <br />Picture the future where society has crumbled, such that survival returns to bare basics food, trade and fight to survive.  It is a shame that Fox did not put it on prime time and give it a chance.
B0007OCG4W|3.0|Towards the end of the film I was expecting someone, (anyone)! to go completely mad and commit a violent act in blind rage.  There was so much penned up rage throughout the entire film I thought that at least one of the neurotic characters would find themselves commiting a felony assault or at least end up on the slab.  \\"Closer\\" built itself up to be a \\"thriller\\" type movie but ended up trying to pass itself off as an edgy, thought provocing chick flick.  I was hoping one of them would, well you know, end up on the slab because in reality they all deserved it.  All four of them were creepy pretentious losers and were just askin' for it.  The film did have me goin' for a while but when it ended, I felt like I was the one being cheated on.  Not to say getting revenge and violence is the answer, but it's a movie and that's what I wanted to see.  Out of the four of them you really didn't know who, at certain points was going to suffer royaly for....(gasp).........adultery!!!!  Who hasn't had their heart broken? How dramatic.  It would have been more dramatic if at least one of them got thrown off a balcony at least.  They should have capitalized on the mystery aspect and surprised everyone.  Out of the four I really think they shoud have killed off Clive Owen's character, he was so annoying.  There were so many angles to this film that could have been exploited, but they chose to be moralistic and give it a happy feel good ending.  It's like the final thought on Jerry Springer, no one cares!!! GO-TO-OPRAH-GO-TO-OPRAH.

It is a real treasure to still be able to have Laura's music around, especially now that she is no longer here, it's nice to still hear that voice, the one that can make you feel better and take you back to your youth.  Laura as told in other reviews I have done will always have a very special place in my heart,  it is a very big shame that she is gone after only 47 years, but maybe she was taken away to do more important things.  Some of today's artist wish they could hold a candle to Laura, but they fall well short.  As with the CD of course it gets an A++++++++++infinitely,  what else could I give, I'd give it more if I could. <br /> <br />The songs that have never been graded are done now: <br /> <br />1) Will You Love Me Tommorrow- A+ <br />2) All Night With Me- B <br />3) Lovin' You Baby- A <br />4) Satisfaction- A++++++ <br />5) If You Loved Me- A++++++++ <br />6) Silent Partners- A+ <br /> <br />Great Hits Package, by a fantastic lady and artist, an artist with a tremendous heart and voice.  <br /> <br />Laura you will always be with me. <br />Live on Laura, and she does here.
B00005ATQF|4.0|Stanley Kubrick is one of the few directors who's actually mastered just about every popular genres. He is(in my opinion) the master of many genres and the greatest director of all time. Full Metal Jacket proves that he was a master of cinema and that it deserves the acclaim it gets. Although this isn't his first war film(Paths Of Glory is excelent and you should check it out.) it is still an excelent achievment to hi name and stands with his other famous and brilliant films such as 2001: A Space Odyssey, A Clockwork Orange, Dr. Strangelove, The Shining, Spartacus, and Barry Lyndon, just to name a few. Kubrick's infamous Full Metal Jacket still has an impact on the viewer, like it did at it's time of release.<br /><br />Full Metal Jacket is based on the novel titled \\"The Short-Timers\\" by Gustav Hasford, who also wrote the screenplay with Stanley Kubrick and Michael Herr. The film is based around the Vietnam war. It is about a soldier's experience through the Vietnam war and what his experiences were like training for it, and surviving in it. The first half of the film is set in the training camps in America, where we get a full experience of how hard the training, the discipline, and the overall experience of the whole deal was about. The central character of the film is Private Joker, he is a young man who is a very humouros and determined character who joined up to kill. In the beggining of the film we have a sequence where we see young men who are getting all thei hair shaven off. After the opening credits, we're thrown into the army barracks, where the drill sergant is introducing himself and telling them that there normal lives are over and that they belong to the marine corps. The first half of the movie's main character, in my opinion, is the poor Private Pyle. Private Pyle is one of the key reasons you should watch the film, Private Pyle is an overweight, helpless and just useless soldier. Pyle is an example of what happened to the troops that fought in and trained for Vietnam, this shows us how a war can change a person's life, and those around him. His helplesness soon effects those around him, the drill sergant starts to punish Pyle severly, but only makes Pyle's mistakes more often. Eventually the hardened drill sergant starts punnishing the rest of the squad members instead of Pyle. So, the rest of the others get into trouble when Pyle messes up. The others eventually get back at Pyle to make him less clumsy, this is all very affective in the storyline which give us what the madness of nam' was really like, and how everyone changes at the time of war, some even driven to madness.<br /><br />The second half is situated in Vietnam itself, and follows Joker through his time in Vietnam. Private Joker is a journalist for the military, but wants to get a taste of the action in the actual warzone, and get the true visions of war. He is then called to go and report on the action that's going on in the Hue City area, because of a recent violation of a ceasefire that was taken advantage of from the enemy. Joker has to take a fellow soldier with him, who also works with the stars and stripes(the army paper they work for in nam), he is the photographer that's on the report with him, his nickname is Rafterman, and is joker's responsibility. The rest of the film bassicly follows that one day he finnaly got out into the action, we also get to see the horrors of war and what it took to survive in Vietnam.<br /><br />This is a typical Kubrick feature, with alot of his trademarks. There are alot of his quite oftenly used tracking shots, and has alot of dark humour and gritty violence. The writing is very well exacuted, with snappy dialogue and scathing dark humour, joker's character is well written, with his lines that are ironic and very enjoyable. The acting is also great. Private Pyle is one of the standouts here, as we see him go through the nightmare of basic trianing, and his spiral into madness. The music is what you can expect from a nam' picture, with some original music(the actual motion picture score) that puts us into the intensity of the action and the fears of the characters. The other music is the typical nam' music, the 1960's rock music and culture that gives us the essance of what era we're being taken through, and to, ofcourse, give the film the authenticity.<br /><br />Overall, the film is a great companion to Kubrick's films and other classic war films. This is certainly a film you can watch more than once and is a definate reccomendation to anyone who is wanting to watch a truly brillliant, entertaining and gut wrenching film. The film has lots of swearing, and plenty of blood, so if you're a person that gets turned off easily by those things, then you might find it a tough watch. All in all, you should definately have this one in your collection. If not, then buy it.<br /><br />The extras aren't something to write about. A trailer, and scene selection. That's why I didn't give the full DVD five stars, the film: 5/5 The Extras: 1/5.with some original music(the actual motion picture score) that puts us into the intensity of the action and the fears of the characters.

B000FS9FCQ|4.0|Though the packaging of both the theatrical release and the DVD suggest that V FOR VENDETTA  is yet another action hero comic book foray, nothing could be further from fact.  James McTeigue has directed this Wachowski Brothers adaptation of Alan Moore's comic book into a story that is intelligent, frightening, spectacularly produced and acted and the result is a fable for our minds to consider.<br /><br />Swooping out of the time in England in 1605 for some background as to the mission of our hero, V (Hugo Weaving)  appears as a masked grinning man who uses terrorist tactics to take down a British government as corrupt as any one might imagine.  The time is 2020 and England rules in a totalitarian manner, its greatest enemy, the United States, has self destructed, and the government controls the lives and thoughts of the British citizenry.  One remnant of the government's destructive forces is a beautiful girl Evey (Natalie Portman) who rapidly becomes V's apprentice/accomplice in the fight against the corrupt powers. The police (Stephen Rea and Rupert Graves) work to capture V and Evey, thinking they are terrorists out to destroy the government.  But the heads of state (John Hurt et al) fanatically attempt to brainwash the populace through the television madness of a talk show host.  Gradually the horrors of the current regime are revealed and it is a case of the good guys versus the bad guys with Portman and Weaving towering in importance by the end of the film.  The quality of acting form this fine cast (including such actors as Stephen Fry among many others) is first class, making the potential silliness of the story dissolve into horror.<br /><br />Well crafted films such as this serve the public well: sometimes it takes a visual depiction of the 'comic book look' of government officials to make us more sensitized to the direction we could be taking. It is an entertaining, fine movie - but it is more importantly a red flag warning we should all be heeding!  Grady Harp, August 06Grady Harp, August 06   <br />   <br />
B00005UW9T|5.0|When I first watched Anastasia as a young child of eight, it didn't take much for me to fall in love with the movie.  A romantic sap even then, I appreciated the skillfully written plotline and couldn't care less about the historical accuracy - or rather, complete disregard for historical accuracy. <br /> <br />After a couple of years, I outgrew typical Disney animation (which this movie isn't, by the way - it's Fox, their first animated feature) and lumped Anastasia along with that.  Somehow, however, it got saved when we sold the majority of our animated films in our garage sale, and three years later on a whim I popped our dusty VHS copy into our VCR...and fell in love with it all over again. <br /> <br />The movie deals with the still-vibrant theory that, when the Bolcheviks under Lenin overtook Russia and executed the imperial family, the youngest daughter, Anastasia, survived.  In this film, the Russian Revolution is set in the year 1916, with an eight-year-old Anastasia; already, the historical inaccuracies are present.  It shows how Anastasia was able to escape the rebels who had come to kill her family, but has her falling to a train platform and losing her memory while still in St. Petersburg.  Ten years later, she winds up an amnesiac orphan, who is picked up by a pair of conmen to pose as Anastasia for reward money offered by Anastasia's grandmother, the Dowager Empress Marie; of course, none of them know that she is the true Anastasia.  It's fairly easy to guess what happens next. <br /> <br />The film follows a basic formula and includes the necessary romance, soul-seeking journey, and, of course, comically evil villain with equally comical sidekick.  However, the way the story is presented is what makes it unique; the animation is fabulous and the heroine is intelligent and spunky.  Some of the songs are fairly unremarkable, save the hauntingly beautiful \\"Once Upon a December\\" and the inspiring \\"Journey to the Past\\", but the score is beautifully welldone.  The plotline is strung together well and the romance is mature and believable. <br /> <br />Most complaints that I've heard about this movie is that it's very much a fictitious story and that children are confused when their parents say it's true.  However, that doesn't act as a critique for the movie or its creators, but rather for the parents who cannot coherently convey to their children the difference between fact and fiction.  The filmmakers have created a beautiful journey from a tragic history, and while it's highly unlikely that this truly happened, it's nice to suspend disbelief for awhile and pretend that the princess does always live happily ever after.
B000FS9FCQ|5.0|This is my favorite movie of 2006. It's thought provoking and a feast for the eyes, ears and mind. I even ( in my estimation) see  the sequence of the Natalie Portman character's ordeal of arrest, stripping of identity, torture, until the jailor tells her she's free (after she reaches the point of not fearing death), as a sort of spiritual? shamanistic iniation to liberation from the world.
B0007LXPBI|4.0|This was the first movie I had seen with Lindsay Lohan and her performance has made me quite a fan of hers.  Throw in an absolutely charming performance from Dennis Quaid, an ideal mom played by the lovely and talented Natasha Richardson, and a smart and warm housekeeper played by...er, I forget..and you'll see why this film gets so many rave reviews. <br /> <br />Not having seen the Hayley Mills version until I was well into my twenties, I had no warm and fuzzy attachment to that film.  In fact, I thought it started out strong but fizzled early.  Kudos to the screenwriters for deftly following the basic storyline while at the same time infusing it with comedy that is mature without being tasteless.  Oh, and it's actually funny, too. <br /> <br />One aspect of the story that has always tickled me is that these identifical twins meet up at summer camp.  It always reminds me of the summer I was at camp and there were two younger girls who looked so much alike that no one could get the right name with the right girl.  In the end the camp director made them stand up during a Saturday gathering so we could all get a good look at them and mutually agree on their distinguishing features.  Who knows, maybe they were actually related....
0743454537|4.0|this is a wonderfully written engaging read and overall great book!  i think everyone can relate to this story in some way, and it's wonderful how the narration changes from the first person of the main characters.  really enjoyed this book!
0800141660|5.0|This is a first-rate film (screenplay by Emma Thompson).  The performances of Emma Thompson and Hugh Grant are terrific ; so are those of the suitors of the younger sister (Kate Winslet).  I'm not a Kate Winslet fan, but she did well in this role.  Be sure to watch Emma Thompson's speech in the Special Features section.  As charming as this story is, as a female, I'm glad, I didn't live in England during this time.
B000EDWL82|4.0|A lot of bands have come close to emulating the retro 80's post-punk sound but, except for Interpol, none have really captured my <br />attention more than Editors.  As soon as I heard \\"Munich\\" on the UK XFM radio in early 2005 I was hooked. I had to work a little <br />bit to find other Editors songs since the album wasn't available here at the time.  <br /> <br />Tom Smith's vocals have an earnestness as if he's trying to convince a jury to find him not guilty, as if his life is <br />at stake. Chris Urbanowicz's razor sharp guitars at times pulse, wail, or soar throughout the album. And Russell Leetch's <br />bass blends well with Ed Lay's tight drumming. <br /> <br />\\"Munich\\" is a song that has to be played loud, one of the most thrilling songs in the last 5 years, and my pick for  <br />single of the year for 2005. \\"Blood\\" is another track to be played on repeat and it contains some of the albums'  <br />more memorable lyrics. The opening bars of of my recent fave \\"Someone Says\\" are practically a homage to any early U2  <br />song you can think of, with it's driving beat and staccato guitar tones. First single, \\"Bullets\\", has less of a melancholy <br />feel than some of the other tracks and a great thrashing, repeated chorus. There are a couple of slower tracks too, including <br />\\"Fall\\" and \\"Camera\\" where Smith employs some simple keyboards.  <br /> <br />The bottom line is Editors can write and perform some impressive tunes, songs and riffs that stay in your head days <br />after you hear them. And I'm hoping for even greater things in their future releases.   <br /> <br />For all fans of this album, I would strongly urge you to check out the following releases if you haven't already: <br /> <br />Joy Division - \\"Unknown Pleasures\\", \\"Closer\\" <br />The Chameleons - \\"Script of the Bridge\\", \\"Strange Times\\", \\"Peel Sessions\\", \\"What Does Anything Mean? Basically\\" <br />Kitchens of Distinction - \\"Strange Free World\\", \\"The Death of Cool\\"
0451147367|2.0|I've only read Rage, so far, and haven't finished it yet, but am so stunned by the sickening events that have taken place in this story that i was shocked to find that so many people on this board liked the story so much.  After what's happened in Rage, so far, i'm not sure i even want to finish it.  I just finished the part where the 'pretty girl' was telling the class about her relationship with Ted and their 'first time' together.  I couldn't believe she revealed so much personal stuff about them--in front of their whole class ! I think Ted was just as shocked as i was  lol.  I was equally stunned at the way Charlie talked to the psychiatrist.  I hope that would not be a realistic way for a crazed student to handle a doctor/psychiatrist in a situation like that.. i don't remember hearing about that kind of thing happening at Columbine.  I sure hope no one else dies in the story (except Charlie, of course) but i might not finish reading it.   <br /> <br />I'll read the other stories and see how i like those.
B0002234LS|3.0|I saw a preview for this movie on another DVD and it looked like a really great thriller.  Little did I know that the preview had all the good parts.<br /><br />The movie itself did little for me. It was pretty straight-forward through most of it, nothing terrific, nothing unexpected. Man shows up at door claiming Mort (Depp's character) plagiarized him. The man turns out to be a psycho, or so we think.  Things get a little more interesting when Mort starts thinking that maybe his estranged wife's new boyfriend might be behind everything, that he might have sent this psycho after Mort in the hopes of speeding up the divorce but things have gotten out of control. Mort even confronts the boyfriend about it. Their conversation does not fit into the twist near the end of the movie, however. In fact, nothing fits in to the twist.<br /><br />This is a film with a secret, something we understand pretty soon. I will not reveal it, but most people will come up with an idea and find out they are right. Even though it has a secret it plays too much like a lot of thrillers we have already seen.  This is a film for Stephen King and Johnny Depp's fans.
B000F5GNX8|2.0|I expected great things from this film considering the cast.  I, however, was very disappointed; In fact I didn't watch it all the way through.  I found the plot and style far too affected for my taste.  This could have been a very funny movie, but the screenplay got in the way.
B000B2YQX4|2.0|First of all, let me qualify this review by stating up front that I have been a DM fan since its inception and think that the band has single-handedly influenced a whole generation of musicians. That being said, I think this album is a symptom of a much larger problem with the band: a real lack of vision and originality. <br /> <br />On the good side, many DM diehard fans will like the majority of the tracks because it reverts to familiar fodder - dark lyrics with machine-driven rhythms. On the bad side, it's all too familiar stuff with  beats that could have been lifted from earlier efforts. The only real difference is that the tracks on \\"Angel\\" sound like they've been fed through a fuzz-box.  <br /> <br />The first time I listened to this disc, I thought I had blown-out the speakers because the drum tracks clipped and everything else sounded distorted and fuzzy. I soon realized this was intentional, but had to ask myself, why? \\"Exciter\\" was experimental, but a truly drained effort. This album sounds like a pale imitation of Bjork. They even copied the toy piano and music box stuff like on Bjork's \\"Vespertine\\" album. The difference between Bjork and DM is that Bjork knows how to use weird sounds to enhance a lyric and create a musical mood. This album just sounds like conventional mid 80's DM music that was fed through badly recorded effects. <br /> <br />I really could feel the creative slide with this band when \\"Ultra\\" was released, but this record confirms what I have sensed for some time. The band has really struggled to achieve artistic relevency since the departure of Alan Wilder. Martin Gore is a musical genius, but he has limitations when carrying 90% of the musical vision and writing. I really think Gore needs an intellectual foil to conterpoint and challenge his ideas. Unfortunately, this album sounds more like a Gore solo effort than a true DM product and as a result, the music has greatly suffered. Gone are the famously catchy hooks and relevant, edgy lyrics. Here comes the gloomy ballads with headcase-jilted-lover lyrics (yawn). A new member or creative colaborator in the band would inject some fresh ideas into their music or I fear this may be their last record. <br /> <br />Word of advise: although this album does show some promise at times, your best friend here is iTunes. Download \\"Precious\\" and preview the rest of the record before making any additional choices. You may find it very hard to find another tune worthy of keeping on your iPod.
B000FS9FCQ|4.0|Target has an exclusive promo of this DVD that includes the comic and a lenticular cover. Had I known, I'd probably have bought there. Other than that, this is a great movie, a great story, and looks to be a great dvd set.
B000002OX7|5.0|You get who's next every song on here is just amazing and much like led zeppelin 4 has spawned 4 hit songs (ironicly the who hate zeppelin). This is strait out amazing music better then tommy better then most anything truely a classic from a band that has the best drummer ever probally the best bass player a singer that is only rivaled maybe by mick and john lennon and a great guitar player that wrote two fantastic rock operas and this gem.
B00005JOQS|4.0|SUPERMAN RETURNS is a good/bad film. What this means is that there are good things within the film that outweigh the bad.<br /><br />Because positive reviews should end on an upbeat, this review will cover the negatives first then delve into the brighter side of the movie.<br /><br />But first, a little history...<br /><br />Superman (Brandon Routh) has returned to Earth after a five year absence. He traveled to Krypton to see if it was really gone and if he was truly alone as a species. Rest assured, he is. Nothing of Krypton -- save himself and a few asteroids -- remains. Returning to Earth isn't easy, either. Lois Lane (Kate Bosworth, BEYOND THE SEA) feels jilted because he'd left without saying goodbye. And she has a new beau ...and child! Jason (Tristan Lake Leabu) is this unique young boy and if you're observant you can figure out a few things rather quickly (for instance, add up the child's age and pay attention to a few subtle clues). Also, due to Superman's abrupt disappearance five years ago, Lex Luthor (Kevin Spacey, THE USUAL SUSPECTS) got a lesser sentence because the Man of Steel wasn't around to corroborate evidence against him. And now Lex is on the loose, trying once again to wrangle some illegal and deadly real estate dealings against the people of America.<br /><br />The bad: This story has been done. If you've seen the original Superman film (Christopher Reeves, 1978) you know the story all too well: Lex Luthor, Gene Hackman, wants to shove California into the sea so that he can be a land tycoon but first he has to get rid of Superman, yada, yada, yada... I'm sure some of this may have been done intentionally, as a sort of homage to that first film (more on that in a minute, too), but here it just felt very unoriginal.<br /><br />Casting. I can see why they picked Brandon Routh as Superman. He's good-looking, has a sort of chiseled quality to him, and he's got that boyish charm. The boyish charm is the biggest problem. Since he's now five years older, and perhaps paternally bound, a fatherish figure would seem more appropriate. Mr. Routh looks younger than Chris Reeves did during the first Superman film. That's a problem. In fact, everyone looks younger, not older. Even Frank Langella's character looks younger than Jackie Cooper (the original Mr. White).<br /><br />The Script. It's corny. Sorry but had to say it. The dialogue is often stilted (\\"All I hear are people crying out for a savior.\\") Barrrrrf!<br /><br />Okay, now that we've dissected the innards, let's get into what's good.<br /><br />Director Byran Singer does his best with this tough script and pulls the film up by its sagging bootstraps. The visuals are absolutely stunning. The outerspace shots (from the opening credits) are, to use my son's expression, \\"Wicked!\\" This makes it a must see on the big screen.<br /><br />The costumes. Loved the fact that Superman's outfit is a bit darker. The cape isn't blood red anymore but is purplish. The \\"S\\" on his chest is also darker, indicating Superman has faults. He's a shadowy man now. He has jealousies (towards Lois Lane's fiancee) and feels out of touch with humanity.<br /><br />I mentioned a bit of homage going on and Mr. Singer puts some of it to good use. Most notably a kind of tribute to the late, great Chris Reeves, whom many of us movie-goers consider the ultimate Superguy. The smug super-smiles (especially at the end of the flick), some similar dialogue (\\"Statistically speaking, flying is still the safest way to travel\\"), and the emotional weight hefted upon Superman by all the women who faun over him are all there and done exceptionally well. Many may feel a closeness with Mr. Singer's approach for including these items in the film. I know I did.<br /><br />So there you have it, a mixed bag. Not great but not horrible either. Definitely worth your while, especially for DC comic book fans and those who enjoy a stroll down Super-memory lane.five years older, and perhaps paternally bound, a fatherish figure would seem more appropriate.

B00000AFWZ|3.0|This box set ultimately represents a missed opportunity.  It could have and should have been the ultimate collection of Garage-Punk classics and yet so much of it is substandard and unlistenable.  Many of the recordings here are little more than copies of more famous bands' works.  It has often been said by aficionados of this genre that out of every 100 copy-cat records of the mid-60s that offered little more than pure derivation, there was always one record that was blindingly transcendent.  The search is perpetually on to discover that one record.  Sadly, this set contains too many of the remaining 99. <br /> <br />However despite the plethora of dull and uninspired recordings here, the ones that ARE part of that elusive 1% are absolutely staggering in their calibre.  It is for this reason that I would absolutely recommend this set.  I would say that these tracks encompass circa 40% of the set and represent 60s Rock n Roll at its absolute pinnacle - tracks like The Seeds' \\"Pushin Too Hard\\", 13th Floor Elevators \\"You're Gonna Miss Me\\", The Brogues \\"I'm Not A Miracle Worker\\" and my favorite The Bees \\"Voices Green And Purple\\" (gotta be heard to be believed).  Also, the sound is very good and although much of the material here has been available before, it has never sounded this potent. <br /> <br />As for education, I found that I discovered much new stuff from this box set that I hadn't encountered previously and which made me seek out in depth more material by the artists (particular recommendation:  Davie Allan and The Arrows).  So ultimately, provided that you are prepared to make the effort to sift through the garbage, there are plenty of gems to be discovered here that are sure to enthrall and expand the tastes of all 60s aficionados and retro sound-hounds.
B00029QWII|5.0|I just saw that Amazon is starting this new group of reviews, while it changed the other DVD reviews (to VHS - even though it was for a DVD too...come on, it was only a little over a year ago...). For what reason? There are almost 2,000 great reviews of this movie (on average), but that is not represented here. I think the public will want to know, also. <br /> <br />It's a shame people are so ready to tear down a person who has made a mistake, rather than trying to show understanding and forgiveness. \\"He who is without sin, cast the first stone.\\" Lots of stones being thrown here, and I for one, do not appreciate it.
B000FS9FCQ|3.0|First off, this is a thrilling movie, both visually and in its performances. Colors bounce off each other, great performances feeding off each other. You really can't take your eyes off it.  <br />\\"V\\" is an obvious amalgamation of Guy Fawkes, the Scarlet Pimpernel, The Count of Monte Cristo, with a little of Batman and a few others thrown in for good measure. That makes for thrilling action and wonderful set pieces. <br /> <br />However, as political commentary, it's laughable. This movie can't decide whether it's anarchist, liberal, terrorist, or something in between (if that's possible.) It owes its anarchist tendencies to Alan Moore obviously, and its liberal sensibilities to the moment. But it cannot be both. It doesn't seem to be arguing for anything so much as rebellion against Orwellian tyrants, which isn't really that much of a bold political statement. \\"We'd all love to see the plan...\\" <br /> <br />Finally, the ending, with masses turned out in Guy Fawkes' masks to watch the destruction of the old order is unintentionally chilling, in that it seems to drive home the idea that we will be free in the future when we are all thinking and acting the same way, in the shape of radical terrorism. Frankly, that's the sort of thing we're fighting against, and isn't all that different from fascism. \\"But then it will be a good fascism!\\" isn't really what Orwell and Huxley and the rest of them were on about, is it?  <br /> <br />Sorry to point it out, but it's necessary to inject a little bit of reality into these male juvenile sadomasochist fantasies. England prevails.
B0000DEPO1|5.0|Albums generally do not become classic 20 years after they are released. Albums typically become classic a few years after their release and their reputation continues to build from there. Such is the case with \\"Rumours.\\" When this album was released in 1977, it was the eclectic combination of rapid pop songs such as \\"Second Hand News\\" and \\"Go Your Own Way\\" combined with surreal Stevie Nicks' songs like \\"Dreams\\" that created an album that was able to realize the artistic ambitions of rock music.<br /><br />You could write a review only on the range of music on this CD. You get a blues and country influenced song, \\"Never Going Back Again.\\" There are lush orchestrated rock songs with strong blues influence like \\"Don't Stop.\\" The quiet ballad \\"Songbird\\" sounds as though it would be at home in a lounge. \\"The Chain\\" with a strong bass backbeat shows influences from metal to blues. There are songs like \\"I Don't Want to Know\\" that would fit as easily into a country album as a rock album. \\"Oh Daddy\\" is another ballad that could be almost anything, but has elements of an abusive relationship. \\"Gold Dust Woman\\" is a dark foreboding song; the words are poetry and generate surreal images.  This song is rock as art.<br /><br />The range of elements and the excellence with which they are achieved are why this album became great. Even though this album was recorded 25+ years ago the variety and skill of execution plays well today and allows a new listener to understand why this album is considered great.<br /><br />Generally I spend a significant amount of time going into what each song contributes, and how the music was performed and so on. However, this album is one of the few that requires little explanation. There are few albums that rise to the level of art that is readily accessible (as an example, I also consider R.E.M.'s \\"Automatic for the People\\" in this same category). This album is one of those. If you appreciate rock when it becomes art and great music in general, you must have this CD for your collection.  However, also consider the newer release of \\"Rumours\\" that adds \\"Silver Springs\\" to the original lineup and a second disk with 18 tracks of outtakes, jams and run-throughs.<br /><br />With more than 18 million copies sold, \\"Rumours\\" has become a phenomenon.  Every fan of classic rock and fans of the greatest rock music needs at least one copy of this CD for their collection.  Enjoy!, you must have this CD for your collection.

B00005JOVN|4.0|Poseidon is a great ship, a massive cruise liner with all the amenities, a disco, a lounge singer, a giant ballroom, and all sorts of top of the line bells, whistles, and ritz.  It doesn't matter how much you spit shine the Titanic, however, it's still going down.  Naturally, a tragedy is about to strike the ship.<br /><br />Evidently there are things called \\"rogue\\" waves, gigantic walls of water that come from nowhere and are impossible to predict.  This \\"rogue\\" wave blasts the ship, flipping it on its side, and nearly capsizing the Poseidon.  The buildup and explanation of what's happening is non-existent during this portion of the movie.<br /><br />Eventually, the ship turns upside-down, like a cup in the sink.  What follows is a race to climb up through the bottom of the boat, an escape from the probability of a watery grave.<br /><br />The acting is neither the saving grace nor the downfall of the movie; it's simply adequate.  There was fairly little character development, letting the viewer establish the character traits from the action on screen.<br /><br />Kurt Russell plays the tough guy, concerned father, expedition leader fairly well.  He exudes strength and confidence while displaying highly uncommon heroism and sacrifice.  He provides at least two genuine goose-bump scenes.<br /><br />Josh Lucas is the confident loner - who plays poker professionally - he's the brash risk taker desperate to exit, willing to risk it all.<br /><br />The rest of the escape crew fills in the cracks admirably, providing tension, excitement, and a helping hand in the escape.<br /><br />The added bonuses to this movie, of course, are that Leonardo DiCaprio is not a star, and an old lady doesn't mindlessly chuck a priceless diamond into the ocean at the end of the movie.<br /><br />Overall, the movie is slightly anticlimactic, and somewhat unreal (who knew there was so much material on board of a ship that was incendiary), but it's a very good thrill ride nonetheless.  The ending is what the viewer wants, and it's a worthwhile movie that had several exciting scenes, some stunning CGI, and enough action to enthrall.eless.

B000DWMYQ8|3.0|The animated film \\"Chicken Little\\" takes the classic story of the tyke who thought the sky was falling and turns it into a parody of \\"War of the Worlds,\\" \\"Independence Day\\" and \\"Signs,\\" with  a little of \\"E.T.\\" thrown in for good measure.  Chicken Little, an undersized nerd who doesn`t fit in with most of his more athletically-inclined classmates, becomes the laughing stock of the town when he announces one day that he has been hit on the head by a piece of falling sky.  The full-scale rejection seems to extend even to his own father, whom Chicken Little senses is trying to distance himself from him.  As a result, the little tyke goes on a quest to gain his dad's acceptance by doing something that will make the old man proud of him.  Eventually, this will mean making the world safe from invading aliens bent on taking over the planet.<br /><br />\\"Chicken Little\\" doesn't have all that much to offer the sophisticated adult, but young children should be entranced by its adorable central character, its frenetic action scenes, its colorful animation, and its universal theme of parent/child relationships.  The movie reveals its laziness by utilizing famous pop songs to serve as commentary on the action, but the final scene is a genuinely funny jab at the kind of romanticizing of reality one finds in Hollywood movies \\"based on a true story.\\"<br /><br />This isn't in the big league of animated treasures, but it scores pretty well in the minors.
B000HBK3MM|4.0|A little Shelby Lynne, a little Alicia Keys, a little Madeline Peyroux, and you have Corrine Bailey Rae. Thanks to our U of P station WXPN, I have heard almost the whole album just on the radio (though not anywhere else, but that may change; maybe some commercials or TV soundtracks). Don't get me wrong, she is a lot more than just the artists I cited, but I am mostly reminded of those three (Macy Gray and Zero Seven were mentioned, which I also agree with).  <br />This is definitely laid-back, daquiri-sippin, chillin music. Just the right touch of light hip-hop, without being too heavy or too trippy. Kind of the same feeling Nora Jones or Diana Krall gives you; just put your feet up and mellow out. I imagine a sleepy little southern main street somewhere, or maybe a barbecue in Philly's Fairmount Park. You can almost feel the dew running off your tall glass of ice tea when you listen to \\"Put Your Records On.\\" And this is only her debut. <br />Corrine follows in the footsteps of other Brit-Soul artists like Joss Stone, Tasmin Archer, Joan Armitrading, Paul Smith, and Seal (though I swear I thought she was American at first, which speaks of her refreshing authenciticy). And, with any luck, she'll be more than just WXPN's \\"Artist of the Week\\" soon.
B000F39MAQ|5.0|At last, 50 years later- a traviata that matches the Callas/Giulini epic at la Scala in 1955. This production is different enough to be judged on its own merits; I'm sure it will be used as a reference for many years. The modern sparse stage setting is very effective, and the ever-present clock enhances the tension. The flow from one scene to the next is different to any other production I've seen, and is very cleverly done.    Anna Netrebko is a very convincing Violetta- she looks like a million dollars, she's a very good actress, and has an excellent voice. To nit-pick though: I find her loud breathing distracting, and the placing of her voice is not always as secure as it should be- this is evident especially in sempre libera. To my mind the star of the show is Rolando Villazon. His acting is very intense, and his singing is absolutely wonderful- magnificent phrasing, superb breath control, easy handling of both dramatic and legato singing- the best singer I've heard for a long time. Giuseppe di Stefano complained in an interview that in la traviata 'the tenor always has his back to the audience- everything revolves around Violetta'. Well, Villazon proves him wrong: he manages to dominate every time he is on stage, and keeps one on the edge of one's seat all the time. If he carries on like this, we have a super-star on our hands. Thomas Hampson, as usual, is very polished and portrays the part of the implaccable father very well- his formal haircut and suit are perfect. A baritone with a darker voice might've been a better foil to the round, full sound of Netrebko's voice. Rizzi conducts the opera well, with very effective changes of tempo; the chorus scene at Flora's party is the best I've ever seen or heard.    This traviata is a winner.
B00005JKBC|5.0|It is refreshing to watch an older Robert Redford pitting his acting skills against a younger Brad Pitt in this spy thriller movie. Both of them acted very well despite the sketchy plot.<br /><br />To me, the storyline is pretty straight-forward: A retiring CIA operative, Nathan Muir (Robert Redford) learned that his protege, Tom Bishop (Brad Pitt), had been arrested in China as a result of a botched rescue attempt of his girl-friend. He was due to be executed shortly. Because of vested interests, CIA refused to mount a rescue. Out of friendship, Muir engineered a successful but unauthorised rescue.<br /><br />The entire movie is beautifully choreographed through black & white flash-backs & pure dialogue, during which Muir recalled his personal encounter & close friendship with his protege. That relationsip spanned across a timeline of about twenty years, from the Vietnam War in the 70's, to the end of the cold war in Berlin during the 80's & then to the mean streets of Beirut in the 90's.<br /><br />The movie moves on to show how Muir had taught Bishop all the skills (or dirty tricks?) of spycraft...how to case a restaurant, fix a radio,...to be callous, look at the big picture...to stay remote...to sell out people if that's of use...to kill.<br /><br />There is no typical high-octane action sequences in this spy thriller movie, except for a heart-pounding escape scene in a China prison.<br /><br />Throughout the movie, one can see how Muir had to use his wits & all the skills (or dirty tricks?) he had learned while working for the CIA to out-smart the CIA's top echelon as well as his fellow CIA operatives to mount a personally-financed rescue mission.<br /><br />I really enjoyed watching his brilliant machinations as he moved from scene to scene in the movie. I just loved the part where he juxtaposed CIA satellite images to fool his bosses. He even forged the signature of the CIA Director. At the end of it, all of them apparently did not have the slightest clue as to what was happening & had happened.<br /><br />On the whole, I have enjoyed watching this spy thriller. It is also comforting to know that an accomplished  Singaporean actor, Adrian Pang, had a small role in the movie. He played a medic during the botched rescue attempt.the whole, I have enjoyed watching this spy thriller.

B00009W0U4|5.0|I never thought I would be giving 5 stars to a film so sickening that I never want to see it again, but here it is. How can I NOT give the highest rating to a film so emotionally vile, that it made me physically kind of nauseaus to watch it, and yet I could not tear my eyes off this film? I can't think of any other movie that's ever had such a striking effect on me. And on others, obviously.<br /><br />A lot of people call this movie perverted, gratuitous, pretentious. Well, here is what I want to ask - what is truly sicker, depicted violence that hooks 13-year-old kids, that makes moviegoers whoop with glee, and makes them want to see more of it? OR, violence that is depicted so faithful to reality, that it makes people physically ill, that makes people denounce it, and never want to see it again? What do you think those two scenarios represent? The first, in my eyes, is standard Hollywood violence, whereas the second scenario is Irreversible. And how would REAL violence make most normal people feel? Would a healthy, normal person enjoy watching a real beating, or a real rape? Or would he/she be disgusted and disturbed?<br /><br />Well, the reason I believe Irreversible is a very brave film and quite genius, is because it courageously depicts violence as it really is and makes the viewer feel a TRUE reaction... That first 30 minutes is very difficult to watch, and the use of motion-sickness-inducing camera angles, along with very disturbing audio, all cleverly combine to induce that feeling of unease and nausea in the viewer that makes the experience REALISTIC. I've never seen anything like it before. Objectively, cheap horror movies depict worse violence than in this movie, but never do people react in such a visceral way. With good reason.<br /><br />And, that visceral emotional reaction that this film induces, is why it really is a valuable work of art, and NOT merely some cheesy crap made for shock value. Those who think otherwise either don't understand the point of the film (I am disturbed, if they didn't have such a reaction to this film!), or perhaps they were so disturbed by their own reaction that they wallow in denial of their emotions by denying the artistry of this film.the point of the film (I am disturbed, if they didn't have such a reaction to this film!), or perhaps they were so disturbed by their own reaction that they wallow in denial of their emotions by denying the artistry of this film.
B000EMSU6A|4.0|Old friends Ronnie Lane & Pete Townshend join forces in late Winter 76 / Spring 77 and the result was: \\" Rough Mix\\".<br /><br />The Who had been idle in the studio for almost two years at this point. Their last project \\"The Who By Numbers\\" was a great record but more than a few folks took it as if it was a Pete Towshend solo record because of the theme of  Pete's songs were very personal and Roger didn't sound comfortable singing that batch of songs. The overall sound of \\"The Who By Numbers\\" wasn't considered a bold move forward and Pete was  writing songs that looked back and his tone was quite angry on that recording. Overall, that project wasn't as popular than if Pete had writen another rock-opera and it wasn't considered worthy to stand next to his greatest works.<br /><br />That said, a lot of us approached: \\"Rough Mix\\" as if was the new \\"Who\\" record. Well, it's not that BUT it stands on it's own merit as one of the best projects that Pete was ever involved in. Ronnie Lane, had been on his own for a few years at this time and he is an important partner for Pete on this piece of work. He is of great contrast in style to Mr. Townshend and helps \\"Rough Mix\\"  work as a balanced record. His tunes: \\"Nowhere To Run\\", \\"Annie\\" & \\"April Fool\\"  seem to have had an amazing effect on Pete's writting and playing to free him up from the turmoils of The Who and the results here are some of the best  Pete Songs, some of you have never heard.<br /><br />It all begins with \\"My Baby Gives It Away\\" a very loose and happy but raunchy love song that sounds nothing like The Who has done since \\"Magic Bus\\", Pete sounds like a new man on a mission and it's a good opener. Ronnie, get's to shine on \\"Nowhere to Run\\" &  \\"Annie\\" and he seems a little more relaxed than Pete, but he sure can write good tunes. The title tune is from a studio jam the boys undertook with Eric Clapton, and it's just OK but it does not hold interest for repeated listenings. Same goes for \\"Catmelody\\" as you can tell this also devolped from a jam featuring a few guys from The Rolling Stones.<br /><br />But, \\"Keep Me Turning\\" is the great lost Who song that we had been waiting to hear for years...fantastic !!! The same could be said for: \\"Heart To Hang Onto\\", as this could have been an epic number if  Roger had the chance to sing on this, both of these  great songs, still pop up in Pete's solo concerts to this day . For my money the best thing recorded for this project was the great: \\"Misunderstood\\"  it is as loose as you could ever get from Pete, but at the same time it has a very tight  focus due to his writing...fantastic plus two. And let's not forget: \\"Street In The City\\" which is  just Pete, and an orchestra doing a: \\"Mini-Opera\\", this experiment works for some but is a shock to lovers of:  \\"Live at Leeds\\" as our hero has done a 180 from the power chords of old, and on this has steered close to a classical work.  I think it is an experiment,  that he indeed pulls off well,  and it's rumored that Pete has demos of more along this line, I hope they get to see the light of day Things come to a close with one of Baba's favorite songs: \\"Till The Rivers All Run Dry\\" and it's like a prayer, as was the intention.<br /><br />This being the: \\"Deluxe Edition\\", there is an essay on the making of this classic and complete lyrics and recording information. Three bonus tracks are added here; \\"Only You\\" & \\"Silly Little Man\\" by Ronnie Lane and another studio jam called: \\"Good Question\\",  they are OK,  but they are not the great lost recordings we are searching for.<br /><br />\\"Rough Mix\\"  still holds up well almost thirty years later and this is the edition to purchase, Ronnie went on to rock in Heaven, and Pete didn't die OR get old, thank goodness.<br />This is one of Pete's finest efforts, and with Ronnie's help, the mix is good.<br />Four Stars!!!this also devolped from a jam featuring a few guys from The Rolling Stones.<br /><br />But, \\"Keep Me Turning\\" is the great lost Who song that we had been waiting to hear for years...fantastic !!!

B000002KDO|5.0|Black Sabbath didn't \\"invent\\" metal like so many say, but they were one of the first metal bands and they have influenced many bands within the genre.  Most metal bands (with the exception of nu metal) consider Black Sabbath as an influence.  Even bands like Nirvana were influenced by Sabbath.<br /><br />With their first two albums, they set standards for the genre and caused mixed reactions among people.  Young metal heads at the time loved Black Sabbath, but parents, critics, and churches weren't so thrilled.  Everyone who thought Elvis's hip swinging was shocking was in for a bigger shock when Black Sabbath came out.<br /><br />Onto the songs.<br /><br />1. Sweet Leaf- This is song is about Ozzy confessing his love for marijuana.  The main riff is very catchy and crushing, but the rest of the song is where the fun comes in.<br /><br />2. After Forever- Like many others have said, Ozzy is not a satanist, and this song is proof.  Not too many people expect the \\"prince of darkness\\" to sing a song about god being the only way to love.  Don't be turned off by it, it's still a good listen.<br /><br />3. Embryo- this is a brief instrumental that leads into Children of the Grave.  It's very catchy, and it shows how guitar driven the album is.<br /><br />4. Children of the Grave- My favorite song on the album.  This sounds similar to Metallica in many ways.  Not much else can be said, other than it's one of Sabbath's best songs.  This song was also played at Live Aid.<br /><br />5. Orchid- another instrumental.  Not as good as Embryo, but it is a good intro to Lord of this world.<br /><br />6. Lord of this world- Not my favorite song on the album, but it has a catchy riff in the middle and it is a good addition to the album.<br /><br />7. Solitude- Some people don't like this song as much, but for some reason this is one of my favorites on the album.  Sabbath usually puts a slower, undistorted song on their albums.  I like this one better than Planet Caravan, the slow song on Paranoid.<br /><br />8. Into the Void- This is another high point on the album.  Lyrically, this song touches upon an interesting subject, and the fast middle section is an obvious influence on countless metal bands.  Has anyone ever noticed that the opening riff sounds similar to slayer's South of Heaven?  This song is one of the best on the album, and in Sabbath's career.<br /><br />There you have it.  Master of Reality isn't as good as Paranoid, but the nice thing is, you don't hear these songs on the radio everyday like the ones on Paranoid.<br /><br />I reccomend Black Sabbath's first 6 albums, then Heaven and Hell, and Mob rules.Caravan, the slow song on Paranoid. <br /> <br />8.

B000FP2OPY|2.0|The uniformly shadowy lighting which is exactly the same in every shot whether it's day or night is annoying and contrived, while the casting and wardrobe choices for the chiseled-jaw catalog model looking brothers and the plot device of having them hunting down a demon that killed their mother seems to serve the exact opposite purpose to the dark lighting, making paranormal subject matter relevent to family values and more palatable to conservative middle america. The individual episode plots aren't necessarily badly written but the show couldn't be more insipidly conservative and dull if it tried.
B000002H33|5.0|Whenever anyone asks what my favorite album is, I always mention Master of Puppets.  Metallica's \\"Master of Puppets\\" is thrash metal at its finest.  The songs are written intelligently, there are amazing riffs with excellent song structures, and the bass is amazing.  As a bass player, I look up to late bass player Cliff Burton (who sadly died not too long after making this album).  Metallica is metal, but they can appeal to people outside the metal fan base.<br /><br />During the '80's, one of the most popular, more mainstream forms of metal was glam metal.  Lyrically, glam bands mainly sing about sex and partying, while bands like Metallica wrote songs about more serious subject matter, giving them a more sophisticated image.<br /><br />I won't give a summary of every song on here, but I will say that Battery is an excellent opener, Master of Puppets is an amazing epic, Orion is a great instrumental, with great bass playing from Cliff Burton, and the most underrated song on here is Leper Messiah.<br /><br />This is easily Metallica's best album, the song writing is more mature than Kill 'Em All, the production value is better than ...And Justice for All, and it is more ambitious than Ride the Lightning.  I also consider this to be the best album ever made in general, I rank it up there along side Led Zeppelin's Zoso, Pink Floyd's Dark side of the Moon, and Nirvana's Nevermind.<br /><br />Whether you like metal or not, you may like Metallica.  I strongly recommend them.  Everything from the accoustic opening of Battery to the thrashy ending on Damage Inc. is a perfect music experience.  Listen to this album at all costs.
0156027321|1.0|This novel gets off to a great start, with beautiful language and a main character who uniquely participates in three major religions and doesn't understand why different religions are viewed by most as mutually exclusive. <br /> <br />Then it lost me. Before long I found all the endless concrete survival details rather tedious ... Robinson Crusoe and Swiss Family Robinson are far better survival tales IMHO. And the twist at the end ... the bottom line is that neither storyline is credible, and my buy-in had been lost to the point that I no longer cared to expend any mental energy considering the question. <br /> <br />Since I was reading the book for my book group, I was forced to consider it anyway.  <br /> <br />I was left puzzled by all the raves I've heard about this book--and the fact that it won the Booker Prize. I was also quite puzzled--and so was everyone else in my book group, some of whom believe in God and some who don't--by the claim that this is a story to make you believe in God. All this story made me believe in is the fallibility of reviewers. <br /> <br />Your time and money would be better spent elsewhere, unless you're specifically interested in the religious aspect of the first part of the novel. Had this beginning been finished, I would probably be writing a very different review. <br /> <br />

B000FC2FVA|4.0|I'm more and more impressed by Phoenix the longer I listen to them.  This record has a beautiful sense of the power of repetition in a pop song.  The subtle sonic and lyric shifts allow the songs to flex and bob about themselves, creating songs that more akin to woven compositions than just verse/corus/verse. <br /> <br />Standouts like Rally and One Time Too Many show the bands confidence and ability to know when to layout or build up to strengthen the feel of the song. <br /> <br />My only complaint would be that many of the songs seem truncated right as they might be well served by a real release or extended coda.  That said, it gives one a good reason to play it again and again.
0380973650|4.0|After hearing about American Gods for a while, I finally got around to reading it. I am a great admirer of Gaiman's work (Sandman, Neverwhere, Good Omens, etc), but while I found American Gods an enjoyable read, in the end I felt somewhat dissatisfied. The scale of the basic premise - that all of the people who came to America brought their gods with them -- is awesome and intriguing. And his treatment of what became of those gods is engaging; it's a rare book indeed when one finds oneself pitying forgotten gods who've been reduced to things like running petty scams and driving cabs to get by. I particularly liked the chain-smoking Russian god Chernobog resorting to playing checkers in order to get sacrificial victims. And the Egyptian gods of the dead Anubis, Thoth and Bast who -- of course! -- end up running a funeral home in Cairo, Illinois.<br /><br />But while I enjoyed the individual characters and sympathized with their personal dramas, in the end, I felt like the novel never quite reached its potential. I think that part of this was due to the \\"new\\" gods - avatars apparently of the media, the internet, etc - coming off as rather vague sketches rather than compellingly fleshed-out characters as the \\"old\\" gods were. And part of it was due to the central character, Shadow, being somewhat vague himself, neither fish nor fowl as they say. His personal dramas were frequently moving, particularly the scenes with his dead-yet-not-quite-dead wife Laura, but his role in the overall gods plot was never really clear or convincing, and his actions in the climactic scene felt more plot-forced than truly natural. Shadow's obsession with sleight-of-hand coin tricks was actually far more interesting than his seeming function in the grand scheme that is supposed to be at the novel's center.<br /><br />But don't get me wrong. American Gods is a definite good read, if only for the ideas presented, the characters you meet, and the highly visual road-trips taken where you get to discover things delightfully Americana from The House On The Rock to the world's largest merry-go-round. If you like fantasy that stretches the frontiers while acknowledging the past and brings the fantastic back into our current-day lives, then this definitely qualifies.to discover things delightfully Americana from The House On The Rock to the world's largest merry-go-round.

B00070DK1E|5.0|If you are any type of Tull fan, this album needs to be in your collection.  Farm on the Freeway is an Ian Anderson masterpiece, and along with Hot Night in Budapest, Jump Start and others, it represents an album displaying originality and musical diversity that Ian is known for.  If you are looking for musical wallpaper, this isn't your album, but if you enjoy complex musical elements, prepare yourself for an aural treat.
6301966562|5.0|I went through a random song playback on my iPod when \\"Together in Electric Dreams\\" started playing. Then I realized how much I loved this movie and how it touched my heart (yeah I was only 13 years old in 1984) when I saw it.<br /><br />So I checked everywhere (netflix, blockbuster.com, amazon) for the DVD and I couldn't find it (I felt really old by this time). And I started to read the reviews and I realized there are at least 100 reviewers who felt the same thing.<br /><br />This movie is such a cult classic of the 80s that it MUST be released on DVD. Great music, great characters, and great storyline despite its cheesiness. The movie makers did a brilliant job of humanizing an Intel 8088 IBM PC into a fascinating, but all too vulnerable Edgar.
B000F1IQN2|5.0|Formed in 1948, the modern state of Israel has survived in the midst of her enemies by divine Providence and the support of the United States and Great Britain. Otherwise, she surely would have been overwhelmed by the forces of evil which threaten her even today.<br /><br />Members of the youngest generation may not realize that terrorism is not new, it has been with us for decades and nowhere more painfully than in the Middle East.<br /><br />\\"Munich\\" is about terrorism, hatred, revenge, and survival. Having withstood the slaughter of eleven athletes at the Munich Olympics in 1972, Israel retaliates by mounting clandestine operations to punish the twelve complicit Arabs. Israeli leadership is intent upon extracting justice by punishing her foes; an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth.<br /><br />Spielberg gets it right. The film is dark, threatening, thrilling, and suspenseful. Politics and war make for unlikely bedfellows and there are surprises and plot twists which add to the suspense. In Munich, nothing is certain but death.
B00009ATIX|4.0|Soderbergh's film has suffered from the widespread misconception that it is a remake of Tarkovsky's 1972 masterpiece.  If it were, the criticisms would be quite justified, as Tarkovsky's is, in my opinion, a far superior film.<br /><br />The confusion lies, I think, in a failure to understand that Tarkovsky's and Soderbergh's films are really just two very different adaptations of Stanislaw Lem's novel.  Since I haven't read the novel, I'm in no place to judge which film is a better adaptation, but reviewers (and readers) should keep that very important distinction in mind.
0312932081|5.0|It has been a couple of years since I've bought and read the revised hardcover edition of Ender's Game from Amazon. I am still waiting for a moment to pick it up again. To this day I am simply amazed at the character of Andrew 'Ender' Wiggin and how smart and vigilante he his. The world created by Card is captivating set in a unique science fiction universe where the children are doing the jobs that the adults are afraid to do. While reading Ender's Game you feel connected with the characters and their lives and almost makes you feel like your with them in deep space. Orson Scott Card did a superb job when it came to writing this novel.  It's so good that I compare it's excellence to my other favorite Sci-Fi novel: Dune by Frank Herbert, which is a favorite of mine I can't put into words.  Buy Ender's Game if your interested in not only an intelligent scifi read but a great romp through space as well.<br /><br />Enjoy!
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|I am a fan of the miniseries, but come on, how can you resist this movie? It is fantastic. A good movie is faithful to the book, but a GREAT movie is one that can portray the story, characters, setting faithfully and still be an entertaining FILM that isn't 6 hours long. Keira is wonderful and both the leads capture the essence of the characters with body language and superb acting, something that Austin only succeeded in doing with a lot of dialogue. The rich scenery and music is delightful and it all comes together like a masterful painting. I absolutely recommend this movie. It is the best.
B000005J56|5.0|Here is a CD that is like so many records in the late sixties, when you could play the entire album and enjoy every song. There is soul, there is passion, there is virtuosity, this has it all. Ry Cooder did us a great service in putting this together and adding his own guitar touches. Get this CD and enjoy the warmth and humanity of these amazing cuban musicians.
B00005NRN9|1.0|At the opposite of the C.D.S. spirit. This DVD sounds like an old fashion Hollywood film. They tried to use SFX, but that's really too much and we can't enter the adventure.  <br />There are only 3 real performances, one from Quidam, one from saltimbanco. <br />The esthetic of the film sounds like plastic. Really too expensive. Uninteresting. Keep your money or let's buy the dvd of saltimbanco, alegria or quidam.
B000F3AAUW|4.0|Gnarls Barkley's \\"St. Elsewhere\\" I picked up after hearing their first single off the album, \\"Crazy\\". I also picked it up after finding out that Cee-Lo did all the vocals forDanger mouse's eclectic arrangements. I was surprised to see myself enjoying the whole album and not just a few of its tracks.<br /><br />In addition to the catchy \\"Crazy\\" I also enjoyed the R&B soul-crooning by Cee-Lo in \\"Necromancer\\" which puts a new spin on loving someone even after death. The funk stylings mixed in with abit of the Wu-Tang Oriental-style of sampling in \\"Feng Shui\\" comes in as another favorite in the album.<br /><br />The whole album mixes so many different styles that calling the whole project eclectic and experimental is a big understatement. Danger Mouse and Cee-Lo have crafted themselves a very good album that tries to be different and be abit daring. Some of the tracks don't reach the same levels as the one's I've mentioned but even when not reaching for the heights they still turned out to be very good.

B000GYI32M|5.0|The O.C. is byfar one of the greatest tv shows I've ever seen! Josh Schwartz created an unbelievably addictive drama that will keep you on the edge of your seat. The third season is full of twists you wouldn't see coming. The fab four face a series of new pressures. Seth experiments with drugs and is having trouble getting into the college of his dreams. Marissa has trouble coping with the death of one of her good friends and is still haunted with memories of shooting her now ex boyfriend Ryan's brother. She also becomes involved with a boy from the wrong side of the tracks, yet again. Summer worries how she'll do in college and wether she and Seth will be able to stick it through. Ryan is confused over his feelings for Marissa; he can't decide if he still loves her or not. But nothing can compare to when The O.C. is faced with the greatest tragedy yet, when Marissa dies in a horrific car crash. This may not be one of the best seasons, but I assure you you will not be disappointed. And be sure to watch season's 1 and 2 as well! And to find out what happens in the aftermath of Marissa's death, check out season 4 of The O.C. staring Thursday November 2 at 9/8 c.
0061015725|2.0|Over the years Michael Crichton has provided some fine entertainment, but you have to wonder exactly when it became federal law that \\"techno-thrillers\\" must be stiff and awkward, serving up by-the-numbers storytelling, typecast characters and humdrum dialogue.  Not zipping along, spirited and alive, and intelligent, but rather mechanically sputtering and clanking along Bestseller Trail, like, say, a big clumsy runaway swarm of self-sustaining nanoparticles on their way to absorbing their first desert bunny.  <br /> <br />Not that this killer-micro-robots-on-the-swarm idea isn't worthy, and just the sort of thing that humans would knowingly or unknowingly unleash. But, to take one example, the lead character is this cutting-edge evolutionary-nanoparticle predator-prey computer programmer, with kids, cute kids, and a wife, a very lovely wife.  After numerous strange occurrences (sure, there might be some short period of denial), wouldn't any one of us become hyper-alert, especially when family safety is involved? Not our boy Jack.  This savior of humankind seems more like Homer Simpson distractedly searching for a lost jelly doughnut.  Why would such an intelligent writer create so torpid a hero?  Because Jack is Everyman?  (Wouldn't say much for Crichton's view of Everyman.) But then why make him so otherwise brilliant? <br /> <br />As far as the plot is concerned, it isn't as if there aren't some unique and fascinating ideas here, but once they are dropped down the hopper of the grinding Techo-Thriller-0-Matic, what comes out seems so much like what we've trudged through before.  That Crichton can take subjects this technically obscure and turn them into popular novels, then movies, is commendable. We definitely learn more about artificial intelligence, nanoparticles and predator-prey behavior. However, it would be helpful if such an accomplished author were to take at least half the energy he devotes to periodically stopping the action to explain arcane technology,and shift it to creating gripping, more believable plots, vivid detail (the more fantastic the story, the greater the need for convincing, if limited, detail), life-like idiosyncratic characters and crisp intelligent dialogue. This would allow new scientific concepts to filter down quietly, almost unnoticed, into the minds of readers who are deeply involved in the story. <br /> <br />\\"Every attempt to destroy them has failed. And we are their prey,\\" says the back-cover blurb, apparently referring to the plucky micro-robots, rather than another of these clunky techno-thriller formats they are forced to inhabit. Run, reader, run!  <br />
B000HBK3MM|5.0|When I first saw Corinne Bailey Rae's video for \\"Like a Star\\" a couple of months ago, I thought nothing of it. It seemed like she had potential. As I watched it more and more, it was evident that she was born to do this. After listening to her album on AOL's free listening party, I found myself listening to it 4 times in less than 48 hours. By the end of the week, I'd listened to it more than 10 times! The CD as a whole is an honest effort, and it's great.<br /><br />My favorites are \\"Till It Happens to You,\\" \\"Enchantment,\\" and \\"Choux Pastry Heart.\\" Her voice is just so melodic, soulful, jazzy, saturated, just overall magnificent. This album is what music should sound like these days: a perfect CD you can listen to straight through without skipping to any song. And if you do push the \\"next\\" button, surely, it was an accident.
B00004Y6NX|5.0|I have the first two CD's by Dire Straight and I think that you are either going to get Mark Knopler or you aren't.  I enjoy his work but I would imagine, like most of his fans, I realize he doesn't have a great singing voice in a traditional sense.  However, the way he works that to his advantage is what is so interesting about his work.  Plus, he's a maestro on the guitar.  I think that if you like the first album, you'll like this album and vice versa.  I think I like \\"Skate Away\\" more than \\"Sultan's of Swing\\".   \\"Solid Rock\\" is real spirited rocker and I don't think I will get tired of that one.   All the other cuts on the second album are enjoyable if you can appreciate Knopler's clever songwriting.  But, if you don't, he always has some nice guitar work to latch onto.  But, if you don't like tasty guitar licks, then you probably won't enjoy Dire Straights.  <br />
B000000OAN|5.0|Yup, A Night At The Opera was the 1st Queen album I bought. So far it's the only one I own, but it's certainly motivated me to buy more of their albums. The version I bought has the DVD on it, so I'm going to review that as well. I'd write a review on the particular version I have, but it seems everyone over there is only reviewing the DVD. But enough of that, how about my thoughts on the songs?<br /><br />Death On Two Legs - 10/10 This one clicked with me immediately. I love Freddie's piano intro, and Brian's guitar is killer. This song has really dark and sarcastic lyrics about insulting and putting down a low-class guy. This is just an all-around great song.<br /><br />Lazing On A Sunday Afternoon - 8/10 I'm down with having a sense of humour and all, but this song just seems silly. But still, it's Queen. And I really like Brian's guitar solo at the end.<br /><br />I'm In Love With A Car - 9/10 The first song not sung by Freddie; Roger Taylor (drums) sings it. .5 is taken off because his voice is a bit too raspy for me. Another .5 is taken off because some of the lyrics seem kind of silly after a while. Still, some great guitar riffs by Brian (as always) and some amusing car sounds at the end.<br /><br />You're My Best Friend - 10/10 One of the catchiest off the album, and one of Queen's biggest hits. I like the keyboard intro too. Nothing needs to be said about it that hasn't already been said.<br /><br />'39 - 10/10 This is my 3rd favorite off the album. Let me just say that Queen really should've released this one as a single! It works in all directions. It's sung by Brian, and he has a great voice. '39 is the folksiest song off A Night At The Opera. I think it's about sailing to a new country or something (\\"The Volunteers came home that day and they bring good news of a world so newly born\\"). But whether I'm right or wrong, it's still a killer song.<br /><br />Sweet Lady - 8.5/10 To me, this son sounds a little dated. I can't explain why, but it does. And other than that, it just doesn' stand out compared to the other songs on the album. It's about a man who's treated \\"like a dog\\", or in other words, *makes sound a whip makes*.<br /><br />Seaside Rendezvous - 8.5/10 The better of the 2 humourous songs on the album. It's just a lot less annoying than Lazing On A Sunday Afternoon.<br /><br />The Prohet's Song - 10/10 WHY does everyone hate this song so much?!?!? This is my favorite song off the entire album, and even though I'm not that familiar with their discography, I think this is one of Queen's best songs. It's an epic 8-minute tale about apocalypse (\\"Oh oh, people of the earth, listen to the warning. The seer he said, beware the storm that gathers here. Listen to the wise man.\\"), or about a man warning the world of apocalypse. It seems to have been inspired by Noah's Ark. Killer song. Don't skip it!<br /><br />Love Of My Life - 9/10 A pretty piano ballad. Basically about an unsteady couple that represents how marriages can fall apart. Not a bad song, but it's really overshadowed after the last track.<br /><br />Bohemian Rhapsody - 10/10 The most popular song off the album, Queen's 3rd most popular song ever (We Will Rock You is #1 and We Are The Champions is is #2), and one of the most popular songs in history!! It's a ballad about a poor, hopeless boy who kills someone (\\"Put a gun against his head, the pulled the trigger, now he's dead\\"), is put on trial, begs to be let go, but is locked up anyway (well, I'm only assuming that last part). He then looks at his life and realizes that he really doesn't have anywhere to go (\\"Nothing really matters... anyone can see\\"). But it's more than the lyrics that change. Bohemian Rhapsody is a crazy song with quick tempo changes, awesome guitar solos from Brian, and even operatic vocals. Certainly one of the greatest song ever written. Only an idiot would skip this song.<br /><br />God Save The Queen - 7.5/10 A very guitar-based instrumental. If you ask me, they should've made ita part of Bohemian Rhapsody. Still, an interesting instrumental.<br /><br />Review for the DVD:<br /><br />Well, it was kind of dissapointing. Instead of showing live performances of the band or music videos, it's just the album played with some video clips of the guys playing. Sometimes it's just pitcures of them, and other times it's not Queen at all!! Unless you like watching muted performances of the band with the album playing over it, the DVD doesn't have much to offer.<br /><br />Well, that's my take on A Night At The Opera. This was one of the best albums of the 70s, was the best album of 1975 along with Pink Floyd's Wish You Were Here, and is one of the best rock albums ever. I had a great experience with this album, and I can't wait to buy more of Queen's albums.D:    Well, it was kind of dissapointing.

B0009W5K0Y|5.0|First off, I have to say that I think giving this album anything less than a five is something to be ashamed of. Now that I've got that covered, let's get to the review.<br /><br />Paramore is a young and extremely talented quintet out of Tennessee. Their music is heartfelt, honest, epic, and super catchy. There is so much to say about the record, and I could probably fill up pages talking about how great it is, but I won't. I'll tell you these things: the musicianship on this record is extraordinary. The guitarwork from both Hunter and Josh is technical and intricate, all while remaining tasteful and appealing. Zac, their drummer, presently 15 years old, has a sense of rhythm that very few drummers possess. Hayley (16 when the album was made) flawlessly steers through winding melodies and elaborate harmonies. Their bassist Jeremy has active and precise bass lines that carry the songs perfectly.<br /><br />Paramore is quickly on the rise to becoming one of the biggest bands of '06 and \\"All We Know Is Falling\\" is definitely one of the  best albums I've heard in a long time. Every song on the record is a gem and has something different to offer, but my favorite is \\"Conspiracy\\". This album has not left my CD player or my head for a very, very long time.<br /><br />This record will have you singing, thinking, rocking, dancing, and begging for more. I caught some of their set at Warped Tour and they did an amazing job. I'm going to see them again in less than a month and I'm stoked! Go see them live if you get the chance!! And of course, buy this ingenious album. You won't be disappointed.
0802130208|5.0|No other book captures the spirit of New Orleans as does this one, with a main character so fascinating in his constant revolution against everything that is. His mother runs a close second, with all her oddities, and her hold over a perenially anarchistic, defiant, and flamboyantly overweight adult son.<br /><br />The real life story of author John Kennedy Toole is equally spellbinding and, were it not for the insistant persistence of his mother, this Pulitzer-prize-winner would have remained undiscovered.<br /><br />One of the funniest books ever written. Humor mixed with pathos is difficult, but Toole managed it brilliantly.<br /><br />Every character and deed in the book come together at the end of this overwhelming dramatic farce -- a work as magnificently gigantic as the protagonist himself.<br /><br />And how many other fictional characters have bronze statues erected in their honor in the very area where the book opens?<br /><br />If you can't buy it, get it from your library. Just be sure to read it.
0767827902|5.0|\\"The Last Picture Show\\" is a film of great artistry without being artsy.  Director Peter Bogdanovich imbues the film with deep texture but there is a context for this.  In other words, this is a film with great style and substance.  I don't know if the studios would bankroll such a film today.  It's not a film that can easily be described but once you experience it you'll be forever haunted by it.  Some would say the film is a litany of disparate vignettes but these episodes when taken as a whole cohere.  What is amazing is that there are many characters here but all are allowed to develope.  It would be fruitless to cite any over the other because it is a true ensemble effort.  What's interesting is that Ben Johnson and Cloris Leachman won Oscars for their work here.  In both cases these are not showy performances but works of great understatement and subtlety.  Though not unworthy of such accolades, I'm amazed that the Academy would recognize these performances because they don't detract from any others in the film.
B000000WHX|5.0|Hard to believe Blue Lines is an album from 1991. Taking elements from hip-hop beats, adding dub and ambient effects, plus a few rap rhymes and vocalists created the genre known as \\"trip-hop\\". What impresses most is the vision and creativity from Massive Attack to produce an album with such timeless and amazing sounds that it still sounds brand new 15 years later.<br /><br />An essential recording. Few albums produce the ambience that Blue Lines creates. Blue Lines is the soundtrack of an urban landscape, it turns elements of city life into sounds, a soundscape of the city.  From a musical standpoint there is no argument against the genius of this album, looking at it 15 years from its release date only adds more greatness to it.
B00000260F|3.0|Released in 1985, this was sort of Jeff Beck's return to rock and roll, after a wonderful romp through jazz fusion.  The album is almost 50 minutes long. <br /> <br />The sound quality of this CD is mediocre.  It is slighty flat and muddled.  This is an example of why there were vinyl snobs in the 1980's who insisted that CD's would never be as good as LP's.  The sound quality isn't horrible, and the mix is pretty good.  It just isn't as good as LP's, or the CD's released now a days.   <br /> <br />This CD is reflection of the times, incorporating almost every music genre that was popular in the mid eighties.  There is new wave, a bit of disco, Sunday brunch jazz and corporate rock. <br /> <br />Despite what others say, there are great bits of searing guitar work on every track.  The only problem is that they are mixed into some pretty bad songs.  Not all songs are bad, and some are even pretty good. <br /> <br />There are the basic corporate rock songs, along the lines of Journey, Starship or Foriegner.  There are even a few bits of Van Halen guitar cliches, but thankfully that is kept to a minimum.  Gets Us All In The End and Nighthawks are the worst cases. <br /> <br />Back on the Streets sounds like something Pat Benatar might do.  It is actually a fairly good song. <br /> <br />Get Working, is a typical, bouncy New Wave song.  Ectasy is along the lines of what was going on in Disco music, as Disco started blending with New Wave. <br /> <br />Escape, which was written by and features Jan Hammer one a Grammy.  It comes right after Hammer's popularity exploded with the Theme to Miami Vice.  Escape and You Know, We Know are the softer jazz that was popular in the mid-eighties. <br /> <br />The best song on the CD is Ambitious, a driving rock number, featuring some piercing guitar work from Beck.  People Get Ready (a blues/soul number written by Curtis Mayfield) is the famous track on this album, featuring the reunion with Rod Stewart. <br /> <br />Overall, this isa collection of some mediocre to bad songs. There are 3 really good tracks on it.   <br /> <br />The only thing that really saves this CD is Beck's great guitar playing throughout.  It has that menacing, distorted sound that Beck would feature in his metallic band in the nineties on such CD's as Guitar Shop and Live at BB King's. <br />
0767847431|5.0|I vividly remember seeing The Golden Voyage of Sinbad as a child one Christmas and it both terrified and thrilled me. Years later, it still sticks in my mind. The film kicks off with Sinbad (John Philip Law) setting sail for an uncharted island with a beautiful slave girl (Caroline Munro) and his motley crew. Along the way, he meets up with a mysterious vizier and does battle with the evil sorcerer Koura (Tom Baker who would later go on to play Doctor Who) who is on a quest to find the fabled Fountain of Destiny.  <br />As with any Harryhausen vehicle, though, the monsters steal the show. Exciting as the final battle between a centaur and griffin is, the one you'll always remember is the six-armed sword-wielding goddess Kali. That scene alone is worth the price. The film has dated amazingly well and is a fitting testament to Harryhausen's genius. All in all, a classic and terrific fun for all the family.
B000000OUJ|5.0|Basically every Wu Tang album up until \\"Forever\\" is worth owning. The GZA (Genius) second album (not the first people) \\"Liquid Swords\\" is one of those albums that need to be in your collection. Backed by some of the most inelligent lyrics and RZA's razor sharp production, this album was a success.<br /><br />GZA's rhymes are some of the most thought out lyrics that I've ever heard comming from the Wu. On the first track \\"Liquid Swords\\" he says \\"..I drop more bombs faster than you can think...\\". Or how he uses major record labels to put a rhyme together in the song \\"Labels\\". Other notable solo tracks are \\"I Gotcha Back\\" and \\"Living In The Cold World Today\\".<br /><br />Guest wise is pretty sick also. Everybody who appears on this album brings their A game behind the mic. Inspectah Deck, Masta Killah, and ODB appear on the track \\"Duel On The Iron Mic\\", backed by a dope beat. Method Man makes a notable appearance on the track \\"Shadowboxing\\" as he and GZA show off their mic skills. Killah Priest makes an appearance on \\"4th Chamber\\" (along with Ghostface and RZA) and he would also get a solo track by himself on the final mindblowing track \\"Basic Instructions Before Leaving Earth\\" about religion.<br /><br />So overall, I enjoyed this album. It showcases one of the finest Wu-Tang Clan talents that you will ever hear. I know this review isn't saying much, but if you're a Wu fan of anykind, and enjoyed mid 90's albums, I highly recommend this album to you.<br /><br />Lyrics: A+<br /><br />Production: A+<br /><br />Guest Appearances: A+<br /><br />Musical Vibes: A+<br /><br />Favorite Tracks: Liquid Swords, Duel Of The Iron Mic, Living In The World Today, Cold World, Labels, 4th Chamber, Shadowboxin', Basic Instructions Before Leaving Earth.
B000E6UK5K|5.0|To me, the beauty of David Gilmour's guitar playing is his ability to do so many things incredibly well.  Not just the technical capabilities to pull off these things, but the impeccable musicianship to merge these elements into a well-crafted, highly emotional sound.  Sometimes his guitar is a gliding whisper, other times a forceful rage.  But there is a balance there.  A Gilmour guitar solo can start with an achingly beautiful melody that suddenly erupts into a cascade of squealing notes and feedback.  His guitar sings, cries and screams...sometimes all within the same song...certainly throughout an entire album.  It is this balance of delicacy and brute force that has always impressed me.  I suppose the 12 year hiatus between Gilmour's last studio output (Pink Floyd's The Division Bell) and this, raised my expectations to ridiculous levels as I yearned for that magical sound.  That's why my first listening to On  An Island left me with a bit of a feeling that that balance had been lost.  Too much of that power and aggression had been set aside.  However, after digesting the album a couple more times, it became clear that...as always...Gilmour played exactly what was necessary for the songs he chose.  Though his aggressive approach is not necessarily in the forefront, it IS still there.  The power is in the subtleties. <br /> <br />As for the songs themselves, they are like wonderful snapshots of Gilmour's current state of mind and truly do represent his most personal work.  The album appears to be reflections on life and mortality.  More specifically David's life and his views on his life-long fears of death.  Memories of wonderful times with friends now passed flow out of the title track, while songs like \\"The Blue\\" and \\"A Pocketful Of Stones\\" seem to indicate some sort of acceptance with the hereafter.  At the same time, heartfelt expressions found on \\"This Heaven\\", \\"Smile\\" and \\"Where We Start\\", paint the picture of a man who has found a genuine sense of fulfillment in the here and now.  The music itself is largely lush and tranquil, filled with gorgeous gentle melodies and sweet harmonies.  The instrumentation used is not at all overbearing and, despite some of the intricacies, remains extremely digestible.  Gilmour's guitar is as stunning as always, filled with brilliant melody, liquid lines, shimmering vibrato and gorgeous tone.  What's more, the combination of music and lyrical content does...for ME at least...hit a wonderfully emotional chord.  Whether it's the honesty and openness expressed, or merely the feeling that a dear old friend has found true contentment, the fact remains that this music strikes where it intends to.   <br /> <br />Scanning through some of these other reviews, I came across several negative responses that seem like a quick dismissal. That's too bad because I really think this music grows deeper with each listen.  Just try to drop your expectations and take it for what it is.  This is a beautiful album meant to be heard all the way through without interruption.  No party background noise for this CD.  It is especially suited for a summer night under a star-filled sky.  I would have bumped this up to five stars just to help balance off those senseless one star reviews, but thankfully this album has earned it all on its own.  Like most works of art, what you get out of it depends greatly on how open to it you're willing to be.  If your intent is to hate it, you'll probably hate it.  If your sole purpose for buying this is in the hopes of finding lyrics about flying pigs and dead fathers, keep walking.  But if you want to hear the maturing sounds of a world-class musician still in his prime, give this a chance.  This is a blissful relaxed album filled with honest sentiment and brilliant music.  Especially for fans of Meddle and Obscured By Clouds
B00003CXPD|4.0|An amazing film that should be shown in every grade school in the country. Dance is the vehicle that Billy chooses as his challenge yet it works as a simile for your daughter who is pitching her first T Ball game or your college son who yearns to be a fashion designer. Quite a kick in the pants for the older generation of grandparents and parents who were raised in the help wanted men and help wanted women classified ads of their generation. It's more about breaking stereotypes and staying true to your vision than it is about dance steps. Alternate futures are something we seldom think of -- there always seems to be one future or the urge to still follow in our father's footsteps or rebel against our mother's advice...this shows how many other options there are....Charmingly filmed, a small movie that opens up a big world out there.....
B000003JA7|5.0|For rock listeners, the idea of releasing a single, album length, composition is foolish at best, self-indulgent at worst.  For those of us who enjoy jazz and classical music, the concept is less of an oddity.  After all, \\"A Love Supreme\\" is a single album length composition!  Like \\"ALS,\\" \\"Thick As A Brick\\" is really a suite rather than a single song.  While it is performed without interruption over the course of forty-odd minutes (other than a fade at the end of side one and the beginning of side two), the piece contains thematic \\"movements\\" that occur (and recur) throughout the album.  When I was in my teens, this seemed very long and difficult to listen to indeed!  Today, I recognize it for what it is:  A pop album with ambition.  In that, it surely suceeds.
B00005JO1R|4.0|Charming film....power to the June Carter depiction which shows not only love and lust but also the other side of each of those coins which may not be so glossy or shiny...when you're with a charismatic personality like Johnny Cash who strives to overcome his own self-made obstacles and skeletons in his family closet and at the same time keep your true to yourself. Reese Witherspoon is fabulous...her singing, her charm...is this the same actress as in CLUELESS or Legally Blond? What a sophisticated performance with many shades of color and tone. Phoenix does a good job and especially when he's seen as a performer. The prison scene is awesome and probalby worth the price itself to see that concert. You can go home again and this movie proves it helps to have your own cheerleader and soul partner.
B0007TKNII|5.0|While Christine in this film is not Sarah Brighman, although accetpably close, the phantom's voice in the film captures the underlying anger which is absent from the original soundtrack.  The libretto (close captioning) is quite useful when the score travels into the song Prima Donna; the liberties taken from the original musical enhance the story; and, of course, there are just some things which cannot be accomplished on stage which are easily accomplished today with cinema technology.  BRAVO!  Mr. Schumacher on remaining true to Mr. Weber's masterpiece.
B0000DIXDR|5.0|This is an amazing film especially because it is one of the first of the independent films to break through the glass ceiling versus studio films. It is a great film to see for anyone who wants to write their own script or yearns to turn their own novel or life story into a movie. Nostalgic look at coming of age through a summer experience of awe. Jennifer Grey is hauntingly warm and amazingly open in her performance. Patrick Swayze remains eternally sexy. Dance is simply a vehicle for showing passion and expression especially in a generation gap world like the surroundings of where they work in the Poconos. This film has a heartbeat that just keeps on going -- kind of like the Energizer bunny-- you can watch it at different phases of your life and find that it reminds you of something in the past yet at the same time hints at the potential for your future even if you can't waltz or Foxtrot your way to the same spotlight they chose.
0380820846|5.0|The Bridgerton men and women are incredible. This plot is again a \\"can't put it down\\" and the complexity of the characters draws you in like a moth to a flame. Great read!
0812550706|5.0|My mom gave me this book to read and I thought it was going to be boring.  Instead, I couldn't put it down until I was done.  I enjoy the way Card writes.  He made Ender easy to like.  I felt like battle school was very real, like I was there.  I was impressed that it was similar in many ways to my middle-school experience.  I can't wait to read the next book in this series.
B0007GAEW6|5.0|This review is actualy just a way to get something off my chest. Regarding the news of Jon Theodore's departure amongst a couple of other things.  First of all keep in mind this is just one fans opinion and no matter what happens I will most likely love everything that The Mars Volta will ever create even though they are evolving so much. Jon Theodore is my favorite drummer and really gave the band structure and wasn't just a backdrop or filler. What upsets me is that he left right before I was going to be able to experience The Mars Volta live for the first time.  Another thing that I am not totaly pleased with is the amount of guitar work Omar actualy contributes on the new album.  Don't get me wrong John Frusciante is a phenominal musician but I love the magic that Omar creates and I wish people would stop criticizing his performance as a guitarist. Of course he isn't a Hendrix, Slash,or Van Halen but I love his self indulgent, unpolished, imperfect noodling riffs. It is his form of expression and is a thousand times better than all the corporate packaged Idol garbage that alot of our kids have been subjected to endure. Ok I feel better. Listen to all their Albums from start to finish so you get the whole effect, crank it up and let it take you places. Afterwards read a good science fiction/or horror novel before you go to bed and then you can go back to your routine of dragging your feet to work.
B00009Z576|3.0|If you're reading this review, you're probably already familiar with the original release of this album.  It's largely been forgotten by Yes fans, which is a shame.  Regardless of the lack of Anderson's vocals, Drama is by all accounts a fantastic mesh of classic Yes (e.g. Squire and Howe) and the new wave movement as provided by Horn and Downes.  There's nothing like it.  However, I'm not writing this as a review of the album proper.  I am rating it based solely on the re-release that includes the bonus material. <br /> <br />The single versions in and of themselves are essentially irrelevant.  \\"Have We Really Got To Go Through This\\" showcases some classic chops from Steve Howe, who is in my opinion one of the most underrated guitarists of his time.  There are no vocals and the song sounds incomplete as it ends somewhat abruptly.  It could have easily been turned into something worthy of release on the original album, though. <br /> <br />\\"Song No. 4 (Satellite)\\" sounds even more incomplete than the previous tune.  Again, there are no vocals and a lot of guitar noodling.  It sounds more like a Howe/Squire/White jam session, but is engaging enough to keep your toes tapping. <br /> <br />The tracking session for \\"Tempus Fugit\\" is a nominally interesting look into the development process of the song, especially as many of the words are replaced with \\"doo-doo-doos\\" and there are apparently no effects on Horn's vocals, leaving them somewhat rough sounding.  Similarly, the tracking session for \\"White Car\\" sports a different set of lyrics with a very basic keyboard backing, but is otherwise uninteresting. <br /> <br />The remaining four songs are from the previous lineup (prior to Horn and Downes).  \\"Dancing Through The Light\\" is a remix of sorts of a portion of \\"Run Through The Light\\" and is basically a throw-away.  \\"Golden Age\\" sounds like it could have been at home on Tormato.  \\"In The Tower\\" is a keyboard-heavy Anderson-style ballad and \\"Friend of a Friend\\" is anotherTormato-era holdout. <br /> <br />It's somewhat striking to listen to the original Drama tracks followed by these last three or four bonus tracks that included Anderson and Wakeman.  My immediate response is that Drama was so much more than what would have likely transpired had the previous lineup finished their work. <br /> <br />I don't regret having purchased this disc, but except for some historical interest to Yes fans, I'd consider this a disc for Yes completists only.
0743455967|5.0|As someone who has had a lot of personal experience with a lot of craftbooks and a pessimistic view of most writing in general, this book was definitely a breath of fresh air, even if it came from the coffin wherein Stephen King sleeps.<br /><br />Even though it's a \\"Memoir of the craft\\" rather than a craft-book, it holds in itself a lot more idea of potential and possibility than a lot of transcendental artsy craftbooks, probably because King just approaches himself like a regular guy.  It, uh, also helps that he's actually published a lot of novels and stuff rather than having his entire literary career revolving on a book telling other writers how to write.  Yeah, there's something to be said in that.<br /><br />It's the writer's version of Robert Rodriguez's highly inspiring book, \\"Rebel without a Crew.\\"  It says the most important thing any inspirational book says (\\"Do what you like until your fingers and eyes bleed\\"), but it sells it as a basic concept anyone can enjoy, rather than any of that, \\"Hey you, you have to decide and if you decide you must realize you're beautiful and special inside.\\"  Nah, forget all that.  Read this (it takes a little bit longer than a sitting) and move on with your life and your ideas.<br /><br />It's kind of funny that I don't really care that much for either Stephen King nor Robert Rodriguez.  But both of them are very important because of their ability to look past the world of \\"art\\" and \\"commerce\\" and make it into a fun necessary thing.<br /><br />--PolarisDiB
0783233477|5.0|A fine quality movie.  It is a wonderful love story and we watched it several times.  Quality acting and wonderful visual effects.  I highly recommend it.
B0007Y08QA|4.0|<br />The Machinist is an utterly compelling and highly atmospheric psychological thriller in similar vein to Memento and Insomnia and also ringing faint echoes of Fight Club, Sixth Sense and Angel Heart. In my opinion though,  it far outstrips each of those.   <br /> <br />Bale is superb as the tortured soul Reznik.  Baffled as to why he cannot sleep and to the reason behind his dramatic weight loss (that truly has to be seen to be believed!), he becomes increasingly paranoid about life. Weird post-it notes depicting a game of hangman materialise on his fridge, which exudes a rather bloody-looking gunge.  His only fleeting moments of something approaching happiness are in the arms of a prostitute - sympathetically played by Jennifer Jason Leigh and his seemingly successful attempts to strike up a relationship with waitress Marie.  <br /> <br />Convinced that his work colleagues, who find him increasingly creepy and unsociable, are out to get him, he loses his job after a violent outburst. Determined to track down the mysterious and unsettling \\"Ivan\\" (check out those disturbingly long teeth!) who always seems to be around when negative things happen,  Reznik eventually discovers the appalling truth.  <br /> <br />Those of you familiar with the movies mentioned above will probably be alert to the \\"twist\\" but, I must admit that I only got that blinding flash of realisation shortly before the grand denouement this time. <br /> <br />So, whilst slightly derivative, The Machinist remains a very clever and satisfying morality tale.  <br /> <br />Remember, always take the Right path!  <br /> <br />PS. the scene in the grotesque fairground ride really does contain some prolongued strobe lighting, so anyone who is flicker-sensitive should be prepared to avert their gaze. <br /> <br />
0694003611|5.0|This was one of our family favorites.  This is the board book for infants so it can be chewed and loved.  Get the real book for Toddlers so it can be saved.  We have ours from 35 years ago and were able to pass it on to our grandchildren.  An award winning story with a lovely calming effect.  Your child will learn the story quickly and be saying goodnight to everything in his room and forget he didn't want to go to bed.
B000B5XOY8|5.0|In 1989, Tim Burton and Warner Bros. brought Batman to the bigscreen, giving both Batman and Bruce Wayne a severe overhaul and finally giving him a movie that truly captures the purity of the character. Gone were any and all elements of the corny Adam West show of the 1960's. Here, a new and improved, darker and more complex Batman emerged. Personally, I love this movie. Always have, since I was [...] and was frightened by my first home-viewing of the movie. Opinions seem to go in every direction about this movie, but one thing that cannot be denied is that this incarnation of Batman was way ahead of it's time.<br /><br />To play Batman/Bruce Wayne, an unlikely candidate in Michael Keaton was elected. Delivering a somewhat neurotic and mysterious version of the Dark Knight, Keaton was complimented well by his nemesis in the Joker, as played by Jack Nicholson. Some may say Nicholson went over the top with his performance, but that's the way it should be. Balls to the wall is how Nicholson plays the Joker, and I wouldn't want it any other way. Nicholson delivers pure evil with a grin, and nearly steals the show from the Caped Crusader. These two performances alone just about make the movie what it is, and behind the direction of Tim Burton, create a movie that is really intelligent, moody and layered, but still has the accessible, popcorn movie feel that one should expect from any superhero flick. \\"Batman\\" delivers the goods, with just as much action as there is character development. The story itself may be a bit dodgy, but does a good job of telling the origins of Batman in a quick, and to-the-point manner, which helps push along the pace.<br /><br />Some may say that time hasn't been too kind to this film, and I'm likely to agree. Afterall, it was made in 1989, and with a soundtrack heavy on the Prince tunes, it's not hard to feel trapped in the 80's. So parts of it may be corny and truly dated, but it's still one of the best superhero movies to date. It set the standard for many movies to come, and for better or for worse, paved the way for many other Bat flicks and pushed Batman's relevancy to the point where now, he is just about the most recognizable superhero the world over. \\"Batman\\" is simply revolutionary, inspiring and way ahead of the curve. Worth watching over and over again.movies to come, and for better or for worse, paved the way for many other Bat flicks and pushed Batman's relevancy to the point where now, he is just about the most recognizable superhero the world over. \\"Batman\\" is simply revolutionary, inspiring and way ahead of the curve.

0399226907|5.0|I love the story and the illustrations.  I used to buy this book for my children and now am buying it as a first book for our new grandchildren.  I would get the real book, not the board book for the toddlers.  Then it can be saved and won't be chewed.  Wonderful award winning book.
B00005JMCN|4.0|The most striking thing about this film is the fact that this is actually a real story. This makes you set high expectations. You want to feel what the characters feel, you want to be part of it. Then there is this \\"horse thing\\" about the film. People who love those animals will be blind to the shortcomings of this film. <br /> <br />To me, this film is inspiring and disappointing at the same time. The cast is magnificent. The locations are spectacular. So are even the props. The race scenes look very real and very convincing (except for Seabiscuit's accident with the 2nd jockey, which is only hinted at, not actually shown). The film has all it takes to become a classic, and yet it won't, because it fails to live up to this unbelievable, touching true story. <br /> <br />The main reason I think is this chaotic storytelling in about the first half of the film. The cuts are amateurish. It kills the story and the performance the cast may have delivered does not carry over to the film. I was quite disappointed with the director's explanations for this kind of storytelling. In the Extras he speaks about his way of doing things and it actually tells you everything. Fractured, even \\"disjointed\\" is actually a fitting word for his way of thinking on this film and the storytelling.  <br /> <br />Whoever else would have directed this film could have hardly delivered a worse performance. This is a magnificent story worthy of a magnificent film, not such a half-baked cut as is the case here.  <br /> <br />As long as there is no other film on this, I suggest you buy this one and see for yourself. The story will cheer you up.  <br /> <br />Or buy the book.

1400079179|2.0|I finally got around to reading this the other day and I can't figure out what's the big deal or why it's any more popular than, let's say, any formulaic Dean Koontz (or pick any number other thriller stories where guy and girl run from some mysterious baddy.) The surprises are totally unsurprising and weakly hidden from the reader. The whole Teacher character and how his identity was kept from the reader -- when it would have obviuosly been revealed early on by a certain character he interacted with -- was ludicrous and unfortunately one of the main plot elements of the book. Many other of the plot devices were just as poorly handled. The payoff was totally retarded. I laughed out loud numerous times while reading and any time I actually got into the story some bad choice pulled me right back out of it.
B00065MDSQ|5.0|I love this album.  It's the conclusion of arguably Crimson's most creative period, and it's a brilliant, terrifying album.  The title track is one of the more nightmarish (that's a good thing) pieces of music I've ever heard, and I play it consistently.  The other tracks are outstanding, until the final track, Starless, which is a major masterpiece.  It has some of the best lyrics in a Crimson song, and some of the most intense playing that Crimson (or any other band) ever produced.  It's a shame Crimson broke up after this, but they got it back together in 1982, and have been together ever since.  King Crimson rules!

0156027321|5.0|The truth is, this book has made it this far because of its unusual form and themes. Part fiction, part fable, part . . . well, good writing and good storytelling it is not like any other book.  Most successful novels nowadays seem to take on odd forms or ideas and this one is no different.  Won't go into the story here as others have, as much as possible without giving it away, but suffice it to say that this is a worthwhile read.
0440241588|2.0|This book made me full.  Every time you turn a page, Joseph Backman is eating or drinking something.  By the way, he's the \\"hero\\" of this book.      It's really more a culinary book than anything else, or better said, a travelogue.  How nice that Mr. Grisham could travel through Italy!  Must he bore his readers with this follow-up drivel?    Sorry, it is a bit interesting, especially if you know Italy (I don't).    I kept hoping that the \\"hero\\" would get it, that the bad guys would catch him.  They never do, and what a shame.  Backman seems like an egotistical pig, but he's smart, if he can elude the CIA, FBI, Mossad, a serious Chinese hit man, and still manage to hold onto his Swiss bank account.    I trudged through this book with persistence.  It is not what I would call a page-turner.  It's like: \\"Oh, where are we going for lunch?\\"  Or, Backman fixed some coffee and ordered Italian pastry.... or Luigi met him at a famous old Bolognese restaurant.  On and on with the food.  You could get fat just reading this thing.         Diximus
0743454537|2.0|Usually I'm reading 5 books at the same time, cycling through them, but every so often a book comes along where I'm absolutely engrossed. My Sister's Keeper was one of those books which immediately caught my attention, and kept it until the last 30 pages, only to then be completely shattered at the entirely unnecessary ending. If an author has to defend her ending in an interview (which was included in the book), then it probably should give her a clue that the ending is completely gratuitous (to borrow from other reviewers, but which fits perfectly) and disgusting. It seems as if she didn't know how to finish her own story, and then tries to wrap it up in the last five pages. I have never commented on a book I've read, but there is no way I could not respond to this, and I have to agree with another reviewer who said that if Jodi doesn't know how to get us out of the story, then she shouldn't put us in it. I was going to recommend this book to everyone, but now I can't recommend it to anyone....very disappointing.
6304383177|5.0|Now regarded as one of the greatest comedies ever made and perhaps the best example of screwball comedy to reach the silver screen, \\"Bringing Up Baby\\" was a box office failure in 1938. The film was adapted from a story by Hagar Wilde that had appeared in Collier's magazine, directed by Howard Hawks, and starred Cary Grant and Katherine Hepburn in her only screwball role -before her triumphant return to Hollywood in the 1940s. This was Hepburn's last film for RKO. She bought herself out of her contract and returned to Broadway. \\"Bringing Up Baby\\" was rediscovered and began its ascent to iconic status in the 1960s. I'm not usually a fan of screwball comedy, but I have to admit that Hepburn and Grant make this one irresistible. So what explains the film's initial failure? Some have speculated that the wealthy characters are not portrayed as sufficiently unworthy to please audiences during The Great Depression. Or perhaps people wanted to see a more romantic, less adversarial pairing.<br /><br />David Huxley (Cary Grant) is a nice, geekish zoologist engaged to marry his rather stiff assistant Alice Swallow (Virginia Walker) tomorrow. They are also expecting the last bone that David needs to complete the brontosaurus he's reconstructing to arrive in the mail tomorrow. In the meanwhile, David is asked to cultivate the favor of Mr. Peabody (George Irving), a lawyer representing wealthy Mrs. Carlton Random, who is considering donating a million dollars to the museum. On the golf course with Peabody, David's ball goes astray and is mistaken by goofy, headstrong Susan Vance (Katherine Hepburn) for her own. No sooner has the ball mix-up been straightened out than Susan mistakes David's car for hers. Exasperated by Susan's highjinks, which have prevented him from making any progress with Mr. Peabody, David vows to avoid her. But Susan is determined to win David over. As it happens, her brother has sent a tame leopard named Baby from Brazil. So Susan dupes David into helping her deliver Baby to her Aunt Elizabeth's (May Robson) home in Connecticut  -Aunt Elizabeth who is also known as Mrs. Carlton Random.<br /><br />\\"Bringing Up Baby\\" has a spot-on cast and a funny, implausible, but not really impossible script. I think that's important, because screwball comedy can easily alienate the audience by barraging us with too much nonsense. For the most part, David and Susan's actions under these peculiar circumstances are plausible. The far-fetched aspects of the plot are the animals: two leopards of opposite temperament on the loose in Connecticut and a dog that's run off with a brontosaurus' intercostal clavicle bone. But it's funny stuff. Katherine Hepburn reputedly had trouble with the comedy and was coached by vaudevillian Walter Catlett, who plays Constable Slocum in the film. But in the end, she couldn't have been better. George the dog is the same pooch who played Asta in the first \\"Thin Man\\" movie several years earlier. David and Susan's adversarial, absurd, accident-prone relationship begins to look like a whole lot of fun at some point. That is \\"Bringing Up Baby\\"'s great appeal. Remember, \\"When a man is wrestling a leopard in the middle of a pond, he's in no position to run.\\"her deliver Baby to her Aunt Elizabeth's (May Robson) home in Connecticut  -Aunt Elizabeth who is also known as Mrs. Carlton Random. <br /> <br />\\"Bringing Up Baby\\" has a spot-on cast and a funny, implausible, but not really impossible script.

B000GCFO0I|5.0|Silent Hill is a very good example that good games can be translated into a movie without losing its essence. I've played every Silent Hill game that has been released, so when I first heard rumors of a movie I had mixed feelings. Very few games can make acceptable movies. Besides Resident Evil 2: Apocalypse, I can't think of any other example. Don't let this fool you, Silent Hill manages to grasp the creepy atmosphere that was so characterstical of the games, especially the first one. The story is very similar to the original game, with certain adpatations that really work out for the big screen. The music, the surroundings, every step taken in the movie makes you remember every step taken while playing the game a few years ago. The foggy streets, the school, the strange characters. It's all there! I can say I'm really pleased to see one of my favorite games ever turned into a really good movie. Silent Hill will definitely scare you and confuse you. Things are never the same after being in Silent Hill.
B000E6UK5K|1.0|I'm not sure why David Gilmour decided to waste his time on something so incredibly bland. Every song sounds the same, same slow mediocre melody, no energy, no creativity. The sad thing is that this might be good for a fading star like David Crosgy but this is David Gilmour. He is so much better than your average rock artist, so much more creative, lyrically as well as musically. What was he doing at the piano, sleeping? That's my only guess as to why this album turned out to be so monotone.
B000AJJNPY|5.0|...or whatever. Sigur Ros does ambient music (not the techno kind) as well as any band recording now, and this record is a stunning departure from their emo-inspired loud/soft song format from the last album. This one is more even, very melodic and immersive. It's wonderful music to rest to, and I often put it on when I'm studying, as there's veryl ittle here that's jarring or hard on the nerves.<br /><br />A sensational record, for those that enjoy atmospheric music.

I'll admit, she and her husband look like they belong in a trailor park of the slums of Beverly Hills, not Malibu, but this show makes you want to see more and more.<br /><br />It's nice to see the self proclaimed virgin who once said she would wait until marriage to have sex drinking, smoking, and talking about the great sex she has.  I still adore all things Britney, but this show is like a train wreck... You can't help but to watch.  If fact, you enjoy watching it.

0684824906|3.0|If your wardrobe includes a significant amount of tweed (denoting a serious student of history) or a scratchy wool suit, either blue or gray, circa 1864 (denoting the true Civil War buff), then Doris Kearns Goodwin has published just the book for you. Team of Rivals tells the political story of the Civil War; its thesis, which is well argued throughout the tome, states that Abraham Lincoln was not the podunk rail splitter whose destiny was determined by chance, a decent man who happened to be in the right place at the right time. Instead, Goodwin argues that Lincoln masterfully pulled the strings of the entire Republican party in order to receive the nomination in 1860, and then he Lincoln's magnanimity allowed him to forgive his rivals/enemies, many of whose condescending words truly warranted not just a cold shoulder but pistols at dawn.<br /><br />Instead, Lincoln chose to lead in the only way he knew how, by putting the country first, soothing everyone's ego but his own, and saving the US from a fate that could have changed the entire history of the twentieth century. In a feat that has been accomplished by few, if any other politicians, Lincoln was able to ignore the machinations of William Seward, the hubristic animosity of Edwin Stanton, and the muckraking self-aggrandizement of Salmon Chase in order to utilize their talents for the good of the Union. Seward and Stanton became not only an admirers of the president, they were converted into two of his closest friends, whose grief at their friend's death surprised even them. (Seward's grief is even more poignant when one realizes that he too was the target of the assassination plot.)<br /><br />Goodwin has made a significant contribution to the already voluminous collection of Lincoln and Civil War studies. Impeccably researched, there are near 150 pages of notes, referring often to previously unknown primary resources. Though many will buy this monstrosity of a book because of all the buzz, the truth is, few will finish. Goodwin is no David McCullough; she is not a storyteller. She is an historian, and her writing is often stilted and overwhelming to the reader, two of the traditional hallmarks of historical writing.<br /><br />One last complaint. Goodwin dedicates too much time and too much ink to her favorite tangents: Kate Chase and Mary Todd Lincoln. She could have significantly slimmed down this tome by removing the repetitious accounts of the Washington social scene during the war. Instead, Goodwin could have made a second contribution to the literature by writing a book on Kate Chase, Mary Todd Lincoln, and the women of the Civil War.ew will finish.

B000EGFVQS|5.0|I really do not see how this book is conventional and only good for school girls, and serves as a warning...I wonder if the reviewer that said this had read past the opening chapters. <br />Considering the fact that the narrator speaks from heaven, and watches her f and f move through grief, the book is not nearly as sickly sweet, predictable and unbelieveable as it could be. From someone who previously resented that simpistic view of heaven, I can say that it really was different, and strangely realistic and human.  <br />I was moved to tears many many times in this story, it is so so sad, with such beauty and different emotions coming from the central tragedy of her murder.  <br />Ok, so as has been said many times, the end sequences don't live up to the rest. It's true, but really, the rest of it just completely makes up for it a hundred times over.Again, i'd say it's very human. <br />It may not have suspense and dramatic plot twists (till the end- pobably the fault in it) but if you like reading books with real emotion, dignity and hope, then this is for you.  <br />It stays with you and I highly recommend it.
B00005JOML|2.0|Miami is the most talked about city of the year 2006.  <br />First, there was the Miami Heat that won the title of the NBA finals championship, and then there was Miami Vice that wins the title of lamest excuse for a movie. <br /> <br />Michael Mann (Heat) directs the film based on the famous 80's TV series with the same title. Colin Farrell (The Recruit) and Jamie Foxx (Ray) star as Miami detectives Sonny Crocket and Ricardo Tubbs, originally played by Don Johnson and Phillip Michael Thomas respectively, who go undercover and become extremely involved in a drug ring. Sonny falls in love with the wife of a major drug trafficker, and Ricardo puts his family life on the line.  <br /> <br />There's plenty of scenes of the Caribbean (no pirates though!), unnecessary nudity and sex (especially the dreadful Jamie Foxx shower scene), very little action, but perfectly shot action (Michael Mann is an expert at shooting action sequences, just watch the Downtown L.A. shootout scene in Heat for extra proof), and dull performances by the entire cast, with no exceptions. The plot, along with Mann's gritty cinematography, seems disturbingly hazy, and the resolution leaves you hanging like Colin Farrell's laughable mullet. <br /> <br />Not recommended <br /> <br />D <br /> <br />
B000003C2U|5.0|This is a classic metal album from the early 90's possibly by the most important death metal band ever. They're not my absolute favorite extreme metal band, but they're definetly becoming one of them. They may not be the very first DM band but they are those who put the genre in a whole new direction (face it, without em, DM would not sound like what it sounds today). Right now I have 3 death albums (this, Leprosy and Perseverance) and this is the best of the 3, IMO. Don't get me wrong, the other too kick as s but I like this one better.<br /><br />Human is a kinda fusion of the gore albums and the prog ones.  Although it's not that progressive it has some great changes of melodes and it's very technical. Like what Heavymetalninja said, they made a good thing, experimenting. This doesn't only sound like an improved version of Leprosy, but it has a whole new sound. For those who are new to the band, Chuck's vocals are not your typical DM growl. They're more high pitched and are comprehendible. But on the guitar department he totally shreds. He was easily one of the best metal guitarists in extreme metal (the other one is Alexi Laiho, although Suffocation still has the best duo in DM). Paul is another great guitarist ans Sean is a cool drummer too (I haven't heard yet their work with Cynic so I'll keep you posted). But they all made here a good job. Another upside here is the guitar sound, some of the best I've heard on a metal album. My favorite song here is possibly 'Suicide Machine', I love the main riff and the chorus.I also like 'See Through Dreams' for the change of melodes and it's main riff is kinda catchy. 'Flattening Of Emotions' is an amazing opener too. But SM is worth alone the price of the album.<br /><br />All in all, if you like metal, this thing is for you. Even if you don't like DM. Or even if you're a nu-metal fan there is still a hope. It's easily one of the best metal album of '91, along with Sepultura's Arise and Suffo's Effigy of the Forgotten.Sorry fans of Metallica's Black Album but this absolutely destroys it (I actually think that album was kinda good but it just has nothing on this).<br /><br />...RIP Chuck Schuldiner...
B0000021RB|3.0|My favourite Chicago moments largely occur from 1976 and before: during the time when they gave more vent to their impulses to infuse slightly jazz-tinged horn charts into their rock and ballads. Unlike probably the bulk of their fans, I don't remember the initial release of the albums (born in 1970) so it was with high hopes of unearthing a \\"lost classic\\" that I came to this album. My hopes were mostly dashed.<br /><br />For the unitiated, Chicago Transit Authority (the band shortened their name after a legal threat from the Windy City subway system) married horn charts and a jazz sensibility to rock guitar  at this point. (They would later evolve into adult contemporary pap merchants in the 80s with Cetera at the helm.)<br /><br />HIGHLIGHTS:<br />The still popular \\"Does Anybody Really Know What Time It Is?\\" continues to be one of the band's nicest combinations of melody, a bit of somewhat jazzy improv, and a memorable hook: in the AM radio \\"single edit\\" anyhow. Here you also get a meandering piano prelude that doesn't really progress into the melody properly. The epic \\"Beginnings\\" is probably the best synthesis of the band's chops and a good tune. It runs long but doesn't overstay its welcome unlike others on here. When Pankow's trombone blast cuts in, the moment is ebullient rapture rather than the lazy wandering that mars other cuts on the disc. Somewhat bluesy \\"South California Purples\\" is a decent mid-tempo chugger. A charging cover of Spencer Davis Group's \\"I'm a Man\\" nearly stands up to the original's power.<br /><br />LOWS:<br />\\"Free Form Guitar\\" is wankery of the first order. All \\"check out my technique\\" and no \\"dig the melody\\". What differentiates Kath and other guitar luminaries like Hendrix or Clapton is the ability to know when to STOP. Kath doesn't seem to find that line here. The self-important politics of \\"Prologue, August 29th, 1968\\" (a soundbite of protests before that year's Chicago Democratic Convention that led to riots) may have made this album \\"relevant\\" at the time but now it renders the disc more dated than Kath's prominent wah-wah. \\"Poem 58\\" and \\"Liberation\\" begin promisingly enough but my attention's wandering about 2 minutes in.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE:<br />Chicago at their best continues to be as a singles band. Only 'jam-band' fans should find the whole CD essential, otherwise you can get the best bits here on the [[ASIN:B000068ZVQ 2CD anthology]] or the single CD set  [[ASIN:B000AYEI90 Chicago IX: Greatest Hits]].

B0007CNXUK|5.0|This is by far one of the best movies of all times. It should be remembered forever. Johnny Depp's performance was so sincere, you would  almost forget he was acting( not to mention the accent:impeccable!)<br /><br />What I got from watching this masterpiece is that we never actually grow up, none of us. Also, that there's a Peter Pan inside of everyone of us even if we chose to keep it hidden.<br /><br />It makes you believe you could do anything you wanted if you only imagined; it teaches you to never underestiamte your imagination for it could take you anywhere.<br /><br />As for the little boys, they did an outstanding job and I am expecting a marvelous career for each and every one of them.
B000EMGAOY|5.0|I bought this two-disc set the day it was released and, on August 5th, I have not tired of it. There is something highly addictive about this expansive Red Hot Chili Peppers album, and therefore it's stayed good and probably will continue to. I was in love with Californication when I was younger, and grew up listening to BSSM, but was disappointed with By the Way (excluding the slightly weird On Mercury, by far the coolest song on that album). This proved to seemingly everyone - both veteran listeners and newcomers - that RHCP is a genre unto itself. A lot of these songs share the same vibe as other songs RHCP has previously done, but that's okay - everything feels reasonably fresh and absolutely current. Since it's a 28-song CD, I'm not going to review all of them, but  <br /> <br />Dani California: A solid song with a very summery feel. Feels like a summer afternoon driving song, somehow, lyrically and otherwise. Obviously catchy enough to become the first single. Has a nice little falsetto bridge a la Under the Bridge that really pulls it together... I'm a sucker for falsetto bridges. - 8.5/10. <br /> <br />Snow (Hey Oh): I think this song is about cocaine. One of my top three favorites, immediately catchy from the intro and it sustains itself. Musical ability really shines through here, and Anthony Keidis gets to use the gravelly voice at the end. - 10/10. <br /> <br />Charlie: This rounds out the drug-themed duo... Charlie is obscure slang for heroin. A cool funky track, an old-style song. It's not spectacular, but it's fun to listen to after Snow. - 7/10. <br /> <br />Stadium Arcadium: Once in awhile, I like this song's mellow and smooth feel. I know that it's probably emotional and 'beautiful,' but I think it's boring. You either love or hate this track, and I fall into the latter category. It's too slow to be positioned as the fourth track. - 5/10. <br /> <br />Hump de Bump: It grows on you. There's a certain amount of ridiculousness to the lyrics, and that's what makes this song cool. Flea does some pretty nice trumpet work in here, and it builds to a kind of epic end. Light, fluffy, funky. It has the word 'hump' in it. Highly addictive chorus. Another favorite off this CD, and by far one of the best off of Jupiter. - 9.5/10. <br /> <br />Torture Me: Loud. Kind of depressing. Great song. Flea's trumpet work adds a nice touch, and the sudden slowdown for one of the verses makes it a more interesting song. It's not one of my favorites, but it's fun to blast it with the windows open... makes me feel like an annoying teen driver. -8/10. <br /> <br />Especially in Michigan: One of my favorite songs. Catchy, classic, cool. Stupid lyrics though, about Detroit sports teams, and mother ducks. Doesn't change the fact that it's musically very fun to listen to. - 9.5/10. <br /> <br />Warlocks: It took awhile to get into this song, but I love the chorus. Strange bridge, weird lyrics, a pretty twisted song in general. Fun to listen to while driving, and has a taste of the funkiness we know and love from RHCP. - 8/10. <br /> <br />C'mon Girl: Most of the time, I like this song. The chorus doesn't live up to the promise of the verse, but as a whole, it's an appealing track. I don't skip over it often, and it has good bass/guitar work in it. - 8/10. <br /> <br />Wet Sand: Reminds me, in feel, of Scar Tissue. A soft track, not slow, but easy to listen to. I just love it, it's supremely catchy, and probably another favorite off this album. It builds to what, in my opinion, should have been the end of Jupiter. -10/10. <br /> <br />Desecration Smile: Reminds me a LOT of Dosed. Lyrically, a really good song, breezy and fun to listen to. Catchy chorus and a good start. - 8/10. <br /> <br />Tell Me Baby: Fun song to listen to. One of the catchiest choruses on this CD. Stylistically, it's set up like Can't Stop -- quasi-Rap verses with an easy transition to a great chorus. Easy to get stuck in your head. -9/10. <br /> <br />She Looks to Me: Classic style. Reminds me of a Californication song, and has probably the best bridge on the album. It's a little bit sad, but the guitar talent shows here. -9/10. <br /> <br />Readymade: A cool funk song. A bit repetitive, but it's really a decent track, and is a good loud one to play. Great bass in this song, as is always the case with Flea. -7.5/10. <br /> <br />Make You Feel Better: The 'weird song' of the CD. Doesn't even sound like RHCP, especially in the light and pop-styled chorus. In fact, the entire song just screams pop, but it's RHCP's brand. Addictive. - 9/10. <br /> <br />So Much I: Another favorite, this song reminds me a great deal of the old-school stuff. The two-part chorus is an interesting choice, and honestly works very well. A REALLY fun one to play loud on the road.  - 10/10. <br /> <br />Turn it Again: This was a surprise track. For some reason, it didn't catch my attention right away. This is by far John Frusciante's best work on the CD. Not one that many people I know listen to, but I really enjoy it. -8/10 <br /> <br />Death of a Martian: The weirdest song on this album. Its lyrics make no sense, Anthony Keidis sounds possessed, and then he starts reading a very twisted blurb that takes the song down to completion. Yeah, it's freaky, but it's good freaky. A great ending to this compilation, it goes out in style. -9/10. <br /> <br /> <br />Overall, one of my favorite releases by RHCP, with very few songs that aren't destined to be classics. I love this album, and will likely keep it in my car as a classic. No matter what style of RHCP you like, something on this album will appeal. Even those who have never heard of the band, the songs, or the legacy have found themselves absentmindedly humming 'Hump de Bump' when they think no one's listening.
B000EHRVP6|3.0|I never really got any sort of adrenalin boost from the film.  The plot was more focused on drama and gore than unexpected action.<br /><br />The movie started out really great.  Oli had a lot of strength as a character but the movie had a rough transition from three European backpackers into a slaughter fest.  It didn't transition smoothly in my opinion nor was there any particular climax to the movie.  It plateaued with minimal suspense and just stayed at that level before cresting down.  I think if the movie had some sort of CONTEXT and REASON for the events then it would have been more enjoyable.<br /><br />It was, however, a film about depravity in all sorts of graphic ways.  The detailed, intimate portrayl of human torture had an element of realism to it that made it uncomfortable to watch at times, unlike movies like Saw I & II.<br /><br />I was not terribly impressed with this movie.  It was more a documentary on torture than an actual dramatic, titillating horror film.
0385474547|1.0|This book started out promising, but after the first 50 pages we learned about their customs,the author was literally out of things to fill the pages with. The book changed speeds from incredibly slow to multiple events happening within several pages. The author's describtive ability is extremly limited. Overall the book was very poor.
B000FIHCTY|5.0|It's easy to see why this is usually listed as among the best albums of the 70's.  Coming off a very decent debut album, few could have been ready for this brilliant follow-up which reminds me a lot of Tom Petty's best work with the Heartbreakers.  The musicianship and songwriting has improved greatly over the debut effort due no doubt to the more polished backing band that represents the Attractions as well as Costello himself imcreasing in confidence and maturing in ability.  The sound quality of this remastered version is also brilliant and together with the wonderful mini-lp sleeve design which includes all the lyrics in English and Japanese as an insert make this the best version of this album that is out there at the moment.  Highly recommended!

B000FS9FCQ|5.0|I didn't get to see V for Vendetta in theaters unfortunately, but I am really glad that I purchased the DVD.  I have no experience with Alan Moore's graphic novel which is the foundation for the movie, but I did find the movie to present a world very similar to George Orwell's 1984--one of my favorite books of all time.  I was wowed by the thoughtfulness of the dialogue in the movie.  V has a few excellent, thought-provoking monologues throughout the movie which really make the viewer think.  The acting is also some of the best I've seen.  I am glad to see that Portman's portrayal of Evey was much better than her performance as Amidala in the new Star Wars movies.  The film also makes great use of different characters' perspectives to make the movie complete.<br /><br />I do believe that one could criticize the movie for its seeming over-emphasis on discrimination based on sexual preferences, but it is a minor fault which can be easily overlooked given the broad scope of the film as a whole.  That said, V for Vendetta is an excellent movie well worth owning.

B000002UZ1|5.0|Si sólo quieres tener un álbum de la discografía de The Beatles, creo que debería ser éste. Abarca los tres últimos años del cuarteto (en el año 1970 no grabaron ninguna canción como grupo), lo que, discográficamente, nos lleva desde \\"Sgt. Pepper's lonely hearts club Band\\" (1967) hasta \\"Let it be\\" (1970) (si bien las canciones de este álbum se grabaron en 1969). Incluye la mayoría de las grandes canciones de ese periodo, y escribo \\"la mayoría\\" porque, en mi opinión, faltan algunas: Getting better, She's leaving home, Blackbird, Julia, Two of us, You never give me your money  y, sobre todo, la secuencia final de Abbey road: Golden slumbers, Carry that weight y The end, el perfecto epitafio para el mejor grupo de todos los tiempos. Intuyo que, si estas canciones no se incluyeron fue porque magnificarían el trabajo de McCartney durante esta época (de las canciones anteriores, todas son suyas salvo Julia) en detrimento de, seguramente, algunas canciones del resto de los componentes y, aunque este disco (editado en 1973) no contaba con el beneplácito de ninguno de los integrantes del grupo, intentaba reflejar la importancia de cada uno de ellos. (De hecho, de las 28 canciones incluidas, trece son de McCartney, una es una composición conjunta Lennon-McCartney, nueve son de Lennon, cuatro de Harrison y una de Starr). <br /> <br />             De este disco se puede decir, sin temor a equivocación alguna, que no contiene ninguna canción que sea un relleno: todas y cada una de ellas son pequeñas obras maestras (bueno, algunas son grandiosas obras maestras) y es un resumen casi perfecto de los últimos años del grupo que, con el paso del tiempo, será sinónimo de MÚSICA.
B00003CXCT|1.0|We all love the original Star Wars movies don't we? Well most of us at least. <br /> <br />These are not the original movies, they are tidied up versions with 'extra' scenes. The cleaning up of the special effects is effective in places, however the extra content is not. <br /> <br />What has been done is to add ridiculous, ill-fitting CGI sequences in order to prepare us for the lamentably poor prequels. We get a daft sequence of Han-Solo talking to a CGI Jabba which looks like a college graphics project. Worst of all is the new song and dance routine in Return of the Jedi which makes Fraggle Rock look like West Side Story.  <br /> <br />A digitally remastered version of the original movies would be unmissable, these tacky cash-ins should be left in the bargain bin along with the colorised versions of Black & White classics.
B000002UYZ|5.0|Esta recopilación de la primera época de The Beatles (desde el primer álbum (1962) hasta Revolver (1966)) tiene una maravillosa colección de canciones pero, como indica el título del comentario, en mi opinión, podría ser mejor. Y me explico... <br />      a) ¿Cómo es posible que en un álbum de este tipo no tengan cabida canciones tan maravillosas como \\"I'll be back\\", \\"No reply\\", \\"I'm looking through you\\" o \\"Here, there and everywhere\\", por citar algunos ejemplos? (De hecho, estoy seguro de que esta última canción estaría entre las veinte favoritas del 75% de los amantes de The Beatles) Si es por espacio, hay que decir que las canciones que aparecen en estos discos a duras penas pasan de dos minutos y, consecuentemente, había hueco para muchas más. Además, el disco azul (1967-70) tiene 28 canciones y podrían haber puesto, al menos, otras tantas en este álbum. Si alguna vez se realiza una nueva edición de estos discos, podrían poner, al menos, las cuatro canciones indicadas como extras. (Y aún así, no duraría lo que el álbum azul). <br />      b) Creo que algo en lo que muchos fans están de acuerdo es en el hecho de que Revolver es uno de los mejores trabajos de The Beatles y, sin embargo, en esta recopilación sólo está representado por dos canciones: \\"Eleanor Rigby\\" y \\"Yellow submarine\\" (¿¿¿¿????). (Intuyo que por el hecho de ser las dos canciones del single extraído del álbum) Aunque es cierto que las otras 24 canciones son fabulosas, a mí me parece más representativo del trabajo de Lennon \\"Tomorrow never knows\\" que, por ejemplo, \\"You've got to hide your love away\\"... <br />      De cualquier manera, si alguien quiere tener el mejor resumen de la carrera discográfica de The Beatles, este álbum, tal y como está, junto con el disco azul (1967-70) forman la opción perfecta. (Aunque lo ideal sería tener toda la discografía oficial del grupo porque en todos los álbumes hay piezas maravillosas que no caben en estas recopilaciones) (Además es imposible hacer un resumen acertado de la MÚSICA de The Beatles con menos canciones)
B000099T2L|4.0|Beyonce's credentials run so deep into almost every section of the entertainment business (singer, actor, songwriter, co-producer, clothing line spokesperson, businesswoman, etc.), it's far beyond funny! Do I need to say much? Everyone should know about her almost-immeasurable success, so I won't even bother going into it, otherwise this review will take forever to complete, so I'll stick to reviewing this album. The big question is...with 4 smash hits (2 of them being #1 in the U.S.), multi-platinum sales & 5 prestigious Grammies, could Beyonce's debut album, \\"Dangerously In Love\\", live up to all the hype? Thankfully, I can proudly say \\"yes\\" (along with millions of other fans) to that question.    Luminous highlights are abundant on this stellar debut. The most obvious one amongst the bunch is the #1 lead single \\"Crazy In Love\\", a classic R&B/Hip-Hop club banger that combines Beyonce's sexy vocals with some addictive lyrics, Hip-Hop legend/lover Jay-Z's 16 hot braggadocious bars & Rich Harrison's wild, Go-Go-inflected production. Beyonce also hooks up with Dancehall sensation Sean Paul for the reggae-inflected R&B #1 smash club jam \\"Baby Boy\\". Beyonce can still rock club bangers all by herself, as displayed in the classy infectiousness of 4th smash hit single \\"Naughty Girl\\" (peaked at #3 in U.S.). There's also the rock-inflected hip-hop of \\"Hip Hop Star\\", a relentless release of lyrically sexual, daring come-ons from Beyonce, the always-humours Big Boi & the almost-stoner-esque vocals of R&B/Hip-Hop/Soul crooner/newcomer Sleepy Brown.     As expected, standout ballads are also clearly in sight. 3rd smash hit single \\"Me, Myself & I\\" has Beyonce soulfully crooning compelling lyrics about finding independence after moving past a rotten relationship, while the self-penned title track is Beyonce's emotional (and poetic) ode to a man she can't live without. Both tracks have excellently smooth production, which partially consist of some mellow guitar strings. \\"Speechless\\", however, has Beyonce slowly -and effortlessly- drawing listeners into 6 musically lustrous minutes of sexually indulgent pleasure with soulful, sexy vocals, funky guitar riffs and outstanding lyrics. \\"Speechless\\" is definitely the best track by far, as Beyonce's stunning vocals and undeniable sex appeal take centre stage.    Unfortunately, Beyonce's debut album has expected flaws. \\"That's How You Like It\\" has Beyonce pairing up with Jay-Z once again, but unlike \\"Crazy In Love\\" -where Beyonce & Jay-Z had instant chemistry over a wildly addictive song-, this song is a somewhat-boring 3 minutes & 40 seconds of monotonous balladry. The more-than-dreadful \\"Gift From Virgo\\" & the painfully cheesy hidden track \\"Daddy\\" -a shameless ode to her possibly money-greedy father- also expose moments of cringe-worthy weakness.    Another problem lies in the fact that the album's second half is FAR TOO BALLAD-HEAVY (even if it's nowhere near as annoyingly hefty as Ashanti's albums)! While the album's first half is constantly bubbling with lively energy & unexpected surprises, the second half turns out to be a bumpy ride, where gems like \\"Speechless\\" & \\"Me, Myself & I\\", are lost amongst tracks like \\"Gift From Virgo\\" & the album's appropriately placed centre of gravity, the Missy Elliot-produced (and Missy Elliott-featuring) \\"Signs\\". Sure, \\"Signs\\" is incredibly creative with its intriguing metaphors & lyrical cleverness (comparing her lover & his many different sides to the 12 constellations is anything but common), and Beyonce's vocals perfectly blend in with the light, pillow-soft strings. The even better part is the track isn't ruined by Missy Elliott's useless hollering (see Tweet's sophomore album \\"It's Me Again\\" if you wish to see the musically murderous potency of Missy's random shout-outs), but there's still something unsettling about it.    Another problem with this album lies in the excess amount of guest stars. Each guest star provides some nice flavour to each track, andwith all the hard work Beyonce's been doing, she's deserves all the success & support she received, but having too many guest appearances defeats the whole purpose of a solo album, which is to get to know the individual artist. Beyonce easily manages to maintain her presence throughout the whole album (unlike some other singers, who don't), but the guest appearances can be distracting.    Ultimately though, Beyonce has come out with a great album. I can't wait for her sophomore album \\"B'Day\\" to come out! 4 stars!        P.S. I also suggest that you guys get Letoya's self-titled debut. Trust me, you'll love it!
076531178X|5.0|...then you're going to love this!<br /><br />The world this story takes place in is governed by a small martial force with a dictator in control.  The oppressed people, here called 'skaa' instead of slaves, are treated poorly, and it falls to the efforts of a charismatic leader, Kelsier, (who is much like V in Vendetta) to right the wrongs that are being done.  Kelsier takes on a female protege, Vin, who is able to master the same scientific/magical forces he can, and trains her in the ways of fighting and spreading dissension.  There are some great action scenes throughout the book, as well as some marvelous Game of Throne moments.<br /><br />This book was a terrific read, and I had a hard time putting it down, staying up much later than I wanted to on successive nights so that I could find out what happened next.<br /><br />I highly recommend it!
B00007G207|5.0|What can I say about one of the best movies ever made, certainly the best foreign movie ever made -- if you enjoy the power of story, feel that it is (mostly) lost in American film, or deep \\"Hollywood\\" pockets, this film will take you on a journey, one you will never forget, and one that may even renew your faith in the power of storytelling.
0790732203|4.0|A much better film than I imagined and was led to believe. Even we mature males fantasize about these things, at least I do. I enjoyed it much to my surprise and so did my wife. (Don't tell her about my fantasies, allright?) Surprisingly good acting by Cruise and the lovely Rebecca de Mornay who I saw only a few days ago in \\"The Shining\\". I wonder what she is like now, 23 years later. I'm sure she is still lovely. Light but fun.
B00005JP5J|5.0|I caught a free screening of Little Miss Sunshine in Chicago the other day at the reccomendation of a friend of a friend.  I had seen previews for the film and I thought that it looked good, and when I learned that the producers were holding promotional pre-screenings to get word-of-mouth going, I was very excited.  I went to the theater with high hopes of a quirky road comedy with Steve Carrell, who never fails to make me laugh.  I did have a slight worry in the back of my mind; road comedies tend to be trite and formulaic, but I was relying on the fact that this is an indie film to show me something new. <br />I was not disappointed; in fact, the film was much better than what I was expecting.  Even though I knew the entire story going into the film, the family's journey was the focus of the film, not their destination.  For anyone who doesn't know, Little Miss Sunshine is about a bizarre lower class family from New Mexico.  When Olive Hoover (Abigail Breslin), the young daughter, wins the local Little Miss Sunshine beauty pageant by default, she is entered into the nationals in California.  She and her family pack themselves into an ancient VW bus and take a two day drive west.  Father Richard (Greg Kinnear) is a wannabe motivational speaker who takes his schtick a little too seriously.  He preaches about the difference between \\"winners\\" and \\"losers\\" and tries to use his routine on his fed-up family.  His inability to actually get an audience is a big factor in keeping his family barely above the poverty line.  His wife Sheryl (Toni Collette) is probably the most normal of the group, but she seems to be constantly on the verge of a nervous break-down.  She tries to keep the rest of her wacky family from killing each other, and resorts to smoking (a loser activity by Richard's standards) to relieve the stress.  Olive's brother Dwayne (Paul Dano) is a kooky Neitche fan who wants to be an Air Force test pilot.  He has taken a vow of silence and claims that he will keep it up until he achieves his goal of becoming a pilot.  He also claims to hate \\"everyone\\".  Richard's father Edwin (Alan Arkin) and Sheryl's brother Frank (Carrell) also live with the nuclear Hoover family.  Edwin is a heroin-snorting old man who uses profanity-laden speech, loves pornographic magazines, and tends to offer lewd advice to people who don't really want it.  He also is Olive's coreographer.  Frank is a homosexual Proust scholar who tried to kill himself when someone he loved rejected him. <br />If nothing eventful happened to the Hoovers on their trip, their personalities alone would be enough to drive the comedy of the film.  However, crazy things do happen, such as the clutch failing.  This forces them to park uphill in order to have an easier time getting the car going again.  If a hill isn't around, they have to push the car, then jump in while its moving.  Navigational errors, getting pulled over, and an unfortunate encounter with a certain person from Frank's past all factor in to the trip, and many of the events are simultaneously hilarious and sad.  The film's climax at the pageant is amazing because it is both hilarious and creepy.  I don't want to give away why, but suffice to say that I was trying to figure out whether it was ok to laugh at certain things. <br />It's interesting to watch how these different characters react to the situations around them.  Richard has his motivational speaking, Sheryl has her smoking, and Edwin has his drugs.  However, the best person in the family is Olive, who completely embraces everything that happens.  Walking around in huge glasses, a sweatband, and huge headphones, Olive doesn't care that she and her family are odd, she only wants to do LMS, and is the only genuinely happy person in the family. <br />Little Miss Sunshine is a great film that I think most people can enjoy.  Even if you claim not to like indie films, Steve Carrell alone is worth the ticket price.  I will say that his performance here is like nothing he's done before, but he is great playing this new kind of character.  Little Miss Sunshine did well at Sundance, and it earned every award it got.
B000FP2Z0S|4.0|Not nearly as good as Siren but still worth the buy. Siren was an amazing album this one rocks good just nothing mind blowing, but like I said still worth the purchase, plenty of good tracks.
B0002VE1XO|5.0|And that secret would be Loreena's beautiful voice and seemingly effortless singing on this album.  This album has been her biggest commercial success, due to the song \\"Mummer's Dance\\" which hit the charts in 1997, but the other songs more than carry their own weight.  Meticulous research of her songs and a knowledge of people and history aid immensely in Loreena obtaining the right feel for a song. <br /> <br />During the height of this album's popularity, Loreena's fiance died in a boating accident, leading her into mourning and away from music for years.  I, for one, hope that her mourning has been resolved and more music is on the way, if possible.  She's a major talent and deserves all of the accolades and musicial fame
B000FBGBPC|5.0|There first was easily a 5 star album, this one is probably 4 1/2. There's two weak tracks towards the end but for the most part another great hard rock album with lots of catchy songs. Their songs sound more mature this go around. Wish it hadn't taken them 3 years, hopefully we'll get a 3rd cd in 2008, not 9. Still a great cd from a great new band.
B00006JSS8|5.0|I think this is by far one of the best collections of Stevie Wonder's music I've seen.  If you're a lover of his music, this CD is the one to have because it includes many great songs that he's done.  If you're into more recent stuff that he's put out, then this may not be for you, but if you're like me and love his older, feel good hits (many of which are often featured in a lot of period films and romantic comedies) then you'll love this disc.  I am definately satisfied with it.
B0000028M7|5.0|Truly one of the most underrated bands of Rock!! Every cd was incredible no glam no bullsh##t just hardcore TALEN! We wont see a band like this again!! Alice in chains were monsters for there time. If you never listened to them what are you waiting for??? If you love rock and metal at its finest!!! Alice in Chains are it!

B00026WUBE|4.0|Don't mess with record companies. When Dylan left Columbia for Asylum in the early 1970s, Columbia apparently retaliated by releasing \\"Dylan\\" (as of this writing still not available on CD; not that anyone is really complaining). This album contained rather unnerving outtakes from \\"Self Portrait\\" (considered by many as his worst, or at least most confusing, album), including covers of \\"Mr. Bojangles\\", the Elvis Presley classic \\"Can't Help Falling in Love\\",  and Joni Mitchell's \\"Big Yellow Taxi\\". Dylan returned to Columbia two albums, and a little more than one year, later.<br /><br />While on sabbatical from Columbia, Dylan played with The Band and \\"Planet Waves\\" appeared in very early 1974. Some rather exciting things followed. Dylan, in seclusion for years, toured for the first time since 1966 (and with the very same band). So, once again, fans had yet another \\"comeback\\" on their hands (1970's \\"New Morning\\" was also called a \\"comeback\\" as well as 1975's \\"Blood On The Tracks\\"; this speaks volumes about Dylan's repertoire). But this time the tour wouldn't stop. \\"The neverending tour\\" continues unabated to the present day.<br /><br />On its appearance, \\"Planet Waves\\" divided fans and critics, and continues to do so. Some listeners outright hate it, calling it \\"rushed\\", \\"sloppy\\", and \\"obsessive\\". Others hail it as a hugely underrated masterpiece, calling it \\"edgy\\", \\"rough\\", \\"personal\\", or \\"from the heart\\". Most would probably agree that it isn't one of his worst, while conceding that it stands a little distant from his absolute best work.<br /><br />A number of moods pervade \\"Planet Waves\\". The bouncy opener \\"On a Night Like This\\" will cause all still feet to twirl with glee. But the suicidal follow-up, \\"Going Going Gone\\" will plant those feet in concrete while perking up ears and brains. And then the very heavy and sandpaper rough \\"Tough Mama\\" (with the classic line \\"Today on the countryside it was hotter than a crotch\\") kicks the tempo up again, but in a very different way than \\"On a Night Like This.\\" The album appears uneven but it actually conjures up a collective mood after repeated listenings. A straight reading of the lyrics reveals obsessions with love, death, the past, and youth. Dylan pleads with countless lovers on this album: \\"Tough Mama\\", \\"Hazel\\", \\"You Angel You\\", \\"Never Say Goodbye\\", \\"Wedding Song\\". Arguably, the songs on \\"Planet Waves\\" may explore the complicated dimensions of his deep love for Sara, his ex-wife. Perhaps all of the referents point to one person? After all, who hasn't felt both a deep passionate love and a self-deprecating hatred for the same person? \\"Dirge\\" demonstrates the latter, spewing invective such as \\"I hate myself for loving you.\\" This intense love finally gets fed steroids on \\"Wedding Song\\". Here Dylan turns the phrase \\"I love you\\" into a dizzying mantra. And it's obvious by this point that he's hurting. Thematically, \\"Planet Waves\\" sits comfortably in front of, and in the shadow of, \\"Blood on the Tracks\\". That album also explored the many aspects of emotional and existential love (though \\"Planet Waves\\" arguably showcases more of the physical side).<br /><br />Of course one exception shouts out: \\"Forever Young\\". And why do two versions sit side by side on this album? Apparently some friends of Dylan made fun of the slow version, and he decided to keep it off the album. But the engineer loved it and insisted that it remain. So maybe the two versions remained a compromise? Also, side one of the original vinyl lp ended with the first \\"Forever Young\\", so the CD somewhat ruins the affect of flipping sides. In any case, \\"Forever Young\\" has joined the ranks of classic Dylan.<br /><br />\\"Planet Waves\\" stands as yet another complicated, sophisticated, and stratified Dylan project. His work always invites heaps of discussion that, for some people, never ceases. Not only that, \\"Planet Waves\\" was Dylan's first number one record (which seems impossible), though sales weren't as impressive as expectations. Though Dylan never regained the heights he attained in the 1960s, it doesn't seem like he really wanted to. In \\"Wedding Song\\" he sings \\"It's never been my duty to remake the world at large, Nor is it my intention to sound a battle charge.\\" Dylan had openly abdicated the throne imposed on him by some of his fans. He instead retreated into the personal and complex world that \\"Planet Waves\\" continued to explore. And he kept going going.hts he attained in the 1960s, it doesn't seem like he really wanted to.

B00005JOML|1.0|This movie is the worst movie I've ever seen. Reasons why: It just starts. No title. No actor names on the bottom. The lighting is too dark in the film. You can never see anyone in any scene. Colin's gritty voice is horrible. Colin and Gong Li have no chemistry and I do not understand why they had so many scenes together. Gong's accent is horrible. I can never understand what she's saying. The dialouge is horrible. There is a part in the movie where I am sure Jamie was supposed to say FEDS but he says FEEDS. I could go on and on but I don't want to.
B000FS9FCG|5.0|Yes, \\"V\\" is for Victory.  And the victory here celebrated is the triumph of the individual over the state.  This is the essential and overwhelmingly powerful message of this most important film.<br /><br />The movie is set in a futuristic London when a fascist government has seized power.  \\"V\\" is the shadowy anti-hero who, tortured and disfigured by totalitarian government agents, launches his own program of retribution, brilliantly begun on Guy Fawkes Day, the anniversary of history's first \\"false flag\\" operation, and played out to the strains of the magnificent \\"1812 overture\\".<br /><br />In an early scene, a beautiful young woman, stranded after mandatory curfew, is about to be set upon by tyrannical government agents.  \\"V\\" comes on the scene, saves her, roughs up the government thugs, shelters her, and reveals to her his fascinating secret life, all the while hid behind his enigmatic \\"Guy Fawkes mask\\".  His story is compelling.  He is the perfect anti-hero.  And yet, the young woman can't accept the brutality of his vendetta, until she herself experiences the evil of the government's torture regime.  In time, the romance that develops between the young girl, played brilliantly by Natalie Portman, and \\"V\\" is as wonderful as is the movie's terribly important philosophical message.<br /><br />Also, early in the film, the Rush Limbaugh figure of the government controlled television station is seen watching his own ranting relative to the now devastated former United States of America and bragging as to what he would do if he ever got his hands on the \\"terrorist V\\".  Of course, the lights in his luxury abode go low, and then, who should appear, but \\"V\\".  It is positively delicious.  \\"V\\" always leaves a red rose at the conclusion of his grisly work.<br /><br />As the plot unfolds, the working class stiffs of the fascist state begin to see more clearly through the government propganda they have been \\"spoon fed\\" through the media.  \\"V\\" plans a final climax on, of course, Guy Fawkes Day, a year following the beginning of the action.<br /><br />There is much truly amazing and terribly important historical significane built into this outstanding screen play.  The beginning scene describes the false flag operation of the \\"Gunpowder Plot\\" used ever since to offer a rationale for ever increasing government control of the populace.  And the climax, the actual destruction of the Parliament drips with historical and politica significance.  In English history, it was the triumph of the oligarchy, represented by the Parliament, over the popular monarchy that represented the enthronement of the money power and the crushing of indiviudal freedom.  It is the cry of freedom that screams out throughout this wonderful and truly amazing movie.  No wonder neoconservative Trotskyite apologists like Michael Medved hate this film so much.  It is the articulation of the argument of individual freedom and morality against the crushing power of the state.  A more important message than this has never emerged from Hollywood.  In your face, Michael Medved!<br /><br />The final scene is breathtaking.  See it.  And keep in mind \\"V's\\" admonition:<br /><br />\\"Remember, remember, the fifth of November,<br /><br />Gunpowder, treason, and plot<br /><br />I can think of no reason that gunpowder treason<br /><br />Should ever be forgot\\".<br /><br />This is truly one of the greatest movies of all time!f course, Guy Fawkes Day, a year following the beginning of the action.   <br /> <br />There is much truly amazing and terribly important historical significane built into this outstanding screen play.  The beginning scene describes the false flag operation of the \\"Gunpowder Plot\\" used ever since to offer a rationale for ever increasing government control of the populace.  And the climax, the actual destruction of the Parliament drips with historical and politica significance.  In English history, it was the triumph of the oligarchy, represented by the Parliament, over the popular monarchy that represented the enthronement of the money power and the crushing of indiviudal freedom.  It is the cry of freedom that screams out throughout this wonderful and truly amazing movie.  No wonder neoconservative Trotskyite apologists like Michael Medved hate this film so much.  It is the articulation of the argument of individual freedom and morality against the crushing power of the state.  A more important message than this has never emerged from Hollywood.  In your face, Michael Medved! <br /> <br />The final scene is breathtaking.  See it.  And keep in mind \\"V's\\" admonition: <br /> <br />\\"Remember, remember, the fifth of November, <br /> <br />Gunpowder, treason, and plot <br /> <br />I can think of no reason that gunpowder treason <br /> <br />Should ever be forgot\\". <br /> <br />This is truly one of the greatest movies of all time! <br />
0312321376|4.0|I already think reincarnation in some form is a given, so the parts of the book that ponder other explanations for the research reported in this book didn't interest me that much, but I loved reading the stories and really loved the correlations he conducted.  I would have liked more of those - I'm sure that's something that will come in the future.  Most important, I think this book demonstrates the positive balance between the scientific model and the psycho-spiritual approach.  Neither one approach throwing out the other, but using the best of each to enhance the other.  Easy to read and extremely interesting!
B0001HAHXW|2.0|Hate to admit it but this just isn't very good.  Been a fan since 'Slowhand' so i've been frequently disappointed and underwhelmed by Clapton, but this is just amazing.  This has everything going for it but it just doesn't come together.  The featured review by 'Woomer' mirrors my feelings that nothing since 'From the Cradle' has been worthwhile barring 'Riding with the King' and that was helped immensely by King himself. <br /> <br />Toss this onto the heap along with 'Reptile' and 'Pilgrim'.
B000EWBNMS|5.0|My wife picked this up while shopping since she could not find some CSI she was looking for. Both of us had never heard of the show since we do not watch TV but the premise seemed good. What a suprise! From the pilot to the last episode cliffhanger, This series is just cheer joy. The chemistry between the players could not be better. It also makes CSI look like a jar of Cheez Whiz. We have watched tons of boxed sets and this one is even better than Boston Legal. My wife began her DVD mania by borrowing  two seasons of Monk last year and since then, we cannot watch anything with commercials in it. <br />( Watching \\"24\\" with commercials can actually kill you!) <br />We have become Amazon DVD freaks and love it. Don't miss this one! It is perfect imperfection!
B000AU9UYM|5.0|this is a great movie im 13 yes my birday was yesterday to thums up way up
B000E6UK5K|5.0|this is great gilmore stuff.  he was a kid when he joined pf.  but this is mature music.  the addition of crosby and nash shows hat he can extend his muse.  thanks cc
B000EWBNMS|4.0|\\"I had a weird dream.\\"<br /><br />\\"Of course you did. It's a day ending in a \\"y\\".\\"<br /><br />I have a deep-seated emotional and intellectual prejudice against two things: blond women and psychics. Combine the two and my disgust becomes more than the sum of it's parts. So this show had some serious compensation to do before I'd like it. It was made worse by the fact that it claimed to be about a real woman.<br /><br />It did. This show, despite everything, is terrific. It's funny, smart and complex. Patricia Arquette does a wonderful job, and the rest of the cast does just as well. I manage to enjoy it because I'm able to suspend disbelief; I'm able to suspend dispbelief because they do such a great job making the show.  As fiction, this is brilliant. (Vastly better than it's closest competitor, \\"Ghost Whisperer\\" - I actually had to stop watching that one partway into an episode because it was just...so....dumb.)<br /><br />So, I recommend it - from the opening credits to the married sarcasm of the leads, the perfectly adorable irritating kids - nothing is \\"hollywood perfect\\", and that's what makes this show wonderful. I know I'll irk someone by saying this, but - It's got a greater dose of reality than the psychisc it's based on.
B000EHSVSC|5.0|Much has already been written about the fidelity to history exhibited in this movie, and I won't pretend to improve upon it. Indeed, the excellent quality of all aspects of the movie's production is only enhanced by its accuracy.     One reviewer pointed out that there is about five minutes missing from the earlier DVD version and this new 2-disk version. I have compared the new version against my old (but excellent) VHS widescreen version dating from several years ago. I cannot find that anything is missing from the new 2-disk version. The only thing I can think of is that the \\"intermission\\" period in the new DVD version may have been shortened. Intermissions were not uncommon in \\"blockbuster\\" movies of the 1950's, 60's, and very early 70's. They varied in length. I timed the intermission in this new DVD version at ~3 minutes, which would have been short by the standards of the day.     I have read a number of books about the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, including the best of all, \\"Infamy\\", by John Toland. The movie and that book are very closely in alignment.    Did the Roosevelt administration know the Japanese were going to attack? Watch this movie, read that book, and make up your own mind. And beware -- history has an unsettling habit of repeating itself, as George Santayana warned us....
0486274268|5.0|For anyone learning to draw animals, to do animation...this is a gorgeous guide.  I just love looking at these poetic drawings.  This is the only book out there that I know of that really explores movement.  I share this book with my students.  I love it, they love it.  I'm never parting from my copy!!!
B000FILW86|5.0|\\"All Those Years\\"-- Track 11; listen to it. Then listen to everything else. You will truly understand how unfair the music business is when such a gem of a CD is snubbed....
B00005O3VC|5.0|This is definitly one of the funniest movies of all time. you will want to watch it over and over. the dvd itself gets 4/5 stars. the extra features really aren't great at all, but it is still a must buy!
B00005JOML|3.0|Action wise, it was stunning!  But the storyline/plot, the pace was kinda slow moving and i didnt know what was going on most of the time.  Colin Ferrell and Jamie Foxx played good parts!  I thought Miami Vice was gonna be way better than it actually was. It didnt suck, but it wasnt amazing either!  Watch it and judge for yourself what you think!
0064430227|4.0|I bought this fiftieth edition for my daughter because it was one of her favourite books when she was young. She is twenty-five now and the old book is falling to pieces and still has her added drawings in it. She was very happy with the new shiny copy, even though the original was smaller in size.
B00004Z459|5.0|In my mind, I believe Hybrid Theory is a great cd and is very much worth buying...even though its not the type of metal you hear out of bands like Slayer and stuff like that...its more of an easier to digest metal blended in with rap perfectly the only way you can do it. <br /> <br />I don't think Linkin Park should be considered with bands like Limp Bizkit and constantly put down because of some of Limp Bizkit's certain shames to rock and rap.  If you like rock, and you like a little rap, or a little rock and some rap then you should definately pick up HT.
B00008BXJG|5.0|WELL,I THINK I WILL GO WITH THE FIVE STAR REVIEWER.AC/DC CERTAINLY ARE AMONGST THE BEST AND MOST CERTAINLY BETTER THAN DIRE STRAITS,GREE DAY AND NIRVANA.HIGHWAY TO HELL IS ONE GREAT ALBUM.GET THIS TODAY.
B0000797IO|1.0|This is a movie that starts out nowhere, and for 95 minutes takes you further than any nowhere you ever dreamed of.  Unimaginative, lacking in humor, and a senseless plot, The Good Girl is definitely a movie for anyone who loves other bad, nonsensical current movies like Crash.  Jennifer Aniston plays a new version of Rachel, and the writing is just awful.  The only good thing about this movie is Zooey Deschanel, but then, Zooey can sparkle like a diamond in any old trash heep.
B000002KHH|5.0|I love black sabbath.they are without a doubt the greatest heavy metal band that ever lived.paranoid is as good as their debut.dont miss out on both these albums.highly recommended.avoid all albums from overrated bands like foreigner,green day and dire straits.
B00001U0CP|2.0|I've generally liked Cornwell's books, but this one was weak.  I'd look elsewhere if you want to read Cornwell.  The ending came very abruptly, with little climax or excitement.
B00004ZAV3|5.0|WELL TOO BAD THAT I CANT GIVE THIS GREAT ALBUM ANYTHING MORE THAN FIVE STARS.THIS FANTASTIC BEATLES COLLECTION HAS 27 OOF THE FINEST SONGS WRITTEN BY ANY BAND.DONT LISTEN TO THE ONE STAR REVIEWERS FOR ANY BEATLES ALBUM. <br />THE BEATLES AND PINK FLOYD ARE ICONS AND LEGENDS.
B000FS9FCG|5.0|Screen Played by the Directors of the Matrix, directed by the First Assistant Director, Stared by it's Villain \\"Agent Smith\\", this movie is a harsh yet, well framed renouncement of our current political system. This movie is naturally highly controvercial, thought provoking, and ironic. Yet, don't let that scare you off if all you want to see is special effects, this is loaded with beautiful knife work. Do be scared off if you can't think or see out of your political and social box.
B000002J09|5.0|THIS IS IT.LED ZEPPELIN ARE THE GREATEST WHO HAVE PRODUCED SEVERAL LANDMARK ALBUMS ALL OF WHOM ARE CLASSICS.IGNORE ALL PAST AND FUTURE ONE STAR REVIEWS.THIS ALBUM IS GREAT,PURCHASE IT TODAY.
B000GGOCIE|5.0|I absolutely loved this book. Although this book is very long, I found myself unable to put it down. There are certain parts where the plot seems to get tireing, but read on, it is all important for completely understanding the story.This book is even more exciting if you read all in the series: Forest house, Lady of Avalon & Priestess of Avalon. Those books actually precede this one.
B000000OF6|5.0|the previous reviewer is a really annoying person who is worse than a rat.QUUEN ARE THE GREATEST ALONG WITH PINK FLOYD,LYNYRD SKYNYRD AND LED ZEPPELIN.THIS COMPILATION FEATURES CLASSICS LIKE WE WILL ROCK YOU,WE ARE THE CHAMPIONS AND BOHEMIAN RHAPSODY.FORGET FOREIGNER,DIRE STRAITS,QUEEN ARE THE BEST.
0064400557|5.0|I've purchased this book for my daughter who is almost 9 years old, I end up reading it before her.  This book is great for growing up kids; how wonderful and variable it is to have a friend he/she can depend on and be with to share fun, sad and so so stories to one another.   <br /> <br />Wonderful, educational and life experience can be experience in this boo!
B00004Y6NV|1.0|I HATE DIRE STRAITS.THEY ARE AMONGST THE MOST ANNOYING BANDS AFTER GREEN DAY AND FOREIGNER.ON EVERY STREET IS ASTONISHINGLE ROTTEN.HEAVY FUEL IS THE WORST SONG EVER MADE AFTER WAITING FOR A GIRL LIKE YOU.TOO BAD ZERO STARS ARE NOT AN OPTION.GET PARANOID FROM BLACK SABBATH INSTEAD.
B000F7CMRM|3.0|This is typical of the current trend in movies, partially started by Quentin Tarantino in Pulp Fiction, the scenes jump without rhyme or reason thus keeping you on edge, you lose track of who is the good guy and who to avoid, so you are almost forced to see the movie over again... then there is the language, it is partially incomprehensible, so again you can catch up a lot of the dialog when you see the movie again.  One redeeming feature of such filmmaking is that you soon lose track of the story and seeing the movie over again is very cost effective, it's like seeing a new movie for free.   <br /> <br />Fianlly, this is a good movie if you are an American who owns shares in oil companies and if you sympathize with the US position in Iraq.  I don't know how a Muslim would view this movie, it seems quite anti the culture in the Middle East. <br /> <br />Bottom line, while somewhat disappointed I am glad I bought the DVD.
B0002F1CO6|4.0|Although some might find the concept matter a little kitschy, the music underpinning it is fascinating.  I would even compare moments on it to Dream Theater's \\"Scenes from a Memory\\" in terms of being a better-executed musical composition.  The keyboard layering manages not to detract from the guitar, which is a criticism I sometimes find relevant to a lot of bands in a similar vein; I think it really deserves it's categorization as \\"orchestral.\\"  The singers' variety also fills out the music nicely, with guests from Tiamat, Bruce Dickinson from Iron Maiden and others adding different vocal textures. Post-apocalyptic mergers of humanity with computers may be an oft-used motif in metal concept albums, but Ayreon manages to make it enthralling.  If you can sit down and listen to it all the way through (though I usually replay \\"My House on Mars\\" and \\"Chaos\\" several times), it's a new and rewarding experience.
630463949X|5.0|I caught this concert on TV a few years back when it first was on. I enjoyed The Mac's music for years, but never saw them perform. I was floored. The whole show was magical, I felt entranced. THIS is true musicianship. Even after all the years, all the semi-private bickering that is so legendary with Fleetwood Mac, they all seem so happy to be there on that stage together performing all their old hits together again. Of course onstage, the chemistry between Lindsey Buckingham and Stevie Nicks takes center stage, and when one or the other is singing a song you know is directed a the other, you can almost see the sparks fly. I gained a whole new appreciation for Lindsey Buckingham as a musician after seeing this show. What a guitar player! It's obvious Stevie Nicks has lost alot of her vocal range over the years, but she has lost none of her on-stage magic. What presence. Christine McVie still sings like a songbird, and brings her own unique presence to the stage. The absolute highlight of the entire show is the performance of \\"Silver Springs\\". This song clearly shows the attraction-push of the Buckingham-Nicks collaboration. The performance is amazing. The overall sound and picture quality is exceptional. This has to be one of the best concert DVDs I've ever seen. Please add this to your list of must-have music discs, you will NOT be disappointed.
B00005IC2H|5.0|The first song I heard from this album was \\"Viorar Vel til Loftarasa,\\" and even years after hearing the song, there's something beautiful...and sad about listening to it, and the way the music drops out in the middle of the song, as if to illustrate a point at which someone's hope seems lost, only to build into a beautiful, triumphal sonic climax filled with strings, piano, drums and waves of oddly reassuring guitar feedback.  It's one of the few songs that really evokes a concrete emotional response even without the benefit of a lyrical narrative, and most of the songs here have that same ability to resonate.  I listen to everything from death metal to African folk music, and there really isn't any other group I know of that sounds quite like this.  Buy it; you'll be moved.
B000F48CD8|3.0|I get mixed feelings listening to this CD, but I'm not sure if it's because I have to shake the crisp, clean sound of Jack White back in The White Stripes and just get used to the rawer, group sound of Raconteurs, or if there really is just something lacking to this disc.  Songs like \\"Hands\\" and \\"Steady As She Goes\\" are quite phenomenal, but overall I get the feeling at times that the members of this group have stepped backwards from their respective progress as Greenehornes and White Stripes and have taken some shelter in trying to sound like a newbie band starting out.  The problem is that none of them are newbies, so the expectations are a little higher.<br /><br />And that is where the confusion comes in, because I normally like the taste of raw and up-and-coming.  So why do I expect otherwise from this group?<br /><br />I will admit that perhaps I just need to get over the history and background of this group and just get into the music.  As I said before, a lot of good stuff on here.  Maybe I just need to mix these tracks into my iPod so I can just listen to the songs as songs and not the overall sense of an album.
B000FS9FC6|4.0|V FOR VENDETTA is a superbly orchestrated and well made movie, with evidence of its MATRIX lineage highly evident in the stylized feel of the movie.  Hugo Weaving does a remarkably good job considering we never see the actors face, so with his Guy Fawlkes mask always on, his character has to be accessed with his voice more than anything, and Weaving is amazing in conveying V's mission and feelings.  Natalie Portman is equally impressive as Evey, the girl he rescues from police and hides her away in his hideaway.  Their relationship develops interestingly and convincingly.  Stephen Rea as the determined Police Inspector does some of his best work since THE CRYING GAME, and John Hurt who plays the tyrannical Chancellor rises to the occasion.  The film's message is pertinent to a society where the government certainly squelches individualism and creativity, nnd the direction and camera work are brilliant.  It isn't a pleasant picture the movie paints, but it is certainly well done and worth seeing.
B0001ADB8C|5.0|This is a 5 star (and more)investment.  A must for fans of Harrison and all fans of music....everywhere      It seems as if nothing else in the world can bind 7 continents of peeps, except music, and so Mr. Harrison actually lives, lives on through his music, most of which I actually heard for the first time.      In 1974, I walked away from Harrison's music. I didn't get it. Now I do, and the only thing wrong with Harrison (tongue in cheek) is that he was way to old when he was so young.  Perhaps we have all caught up with him now, and so now we have Amazon to provide us with Harrison's treasure chest of gems, spanning the years of his musical journey.  This collection is a jewel in the crown of a musician who unfortunately left us too soon.  With the Dark Horse Years collection, every time we play the music, George is very much here with us....      RIP, Our Sweet George.    From the Blonde Rocker.
B000002UVX|5.0|This is Absolute genius , the violence inflicted on his strat is mindblowing ,this album was slated when it first came out by reviewers.It is one of the best live albums of all time ,pity no decent video footage exists.If you're a guitarist buy this album , you ll love it ,and if you don't you ll take ideas from the myriad of licks in the music . Its a essentially soul album with great basslines etc. This record has a essential lesson to all in the music industry ,be careful what pieces of paper u sign he got swindled by a record company for a one dollar contract when he was unknown .
B000CBSHK2|1.0|This entire album is melodically and lyrically boring.  Metaphors  are poorly executed and content just boring.  I will never listen to it again.
B000FS9FCG|1.0|V for Vandetta is simply a Hollywood propoganda film, designed to make conservatives and Catholics look like monsters. It refers to \\"America's War,\\" as a prelude to a dark and dismal future ruled by conservatives despots who use the media to brainwash the populace into believing everything they want them to.<br />It seems that Hollywood has been frustrated at their party of choice, the Democrats, inability to win elections, so they have declared all out war upon conservatism.<br />As a conservative, I feel descrimination every time I see a film like this and had I known this was simply a propaganda film, I would never have even bothered renting it.<br />So, if you are a conservative or a catholic, skip this one entirely. If you are a liberal who needs media to reafirm your belief that conservatives are bad people, this may be yet one more film from Hollywood which will do that for you.<br />In one scene, the conservative equivilent of the SS breaks down the door of a house and arrests a man for having a copy of the qoran in his house. The Islamofacists must love this film for giving them positive public relations. Very unAmerican film.<br />The bigest irony here is that the film does exactly what it acuses conservatives of doing: using mass media to spread lies and propoganda.
B000003TA4|5.0|People need to stop comparing horrible bands like Led Zeppelin to NIrvana. Nirvana were one of my favorite bands of all time. <br />They are legends and make pretty good music. I can get a little bit tired of Smells Like Teen Spirit but the other 3 are great. <br />I suggest you ignore the people who love Led Zeppelin, and The Beatles and get this album with Dire Straits, and Metallica today.
B000GIXEIG|5.0|This is a story that took me totally by surprise.  I expected an action story with a hero clearly on the side of 'right' and a monster clearly evil.   There was plenty of action and peril but there was something more.   The hero did not go blindly into the fight but questioned why there was a fight in the first place.   The 'monster' was not clearly evil, he had motives for his actions. <br /> <br />I had a feeling of people huddled together against the dangers in the dark, seeking safety while sending the young and bold to fight the danger.  It was a story of the circle of revenge and a question at the end, Can this circle ever be broken? <br /> <br />Gerard Butler is perfectly cast as the strong, brave and questioning Beowulf.  He is a natural leader and hero.   I also thought that Stellan Skarsgard and Ingvar Sigurdsson gave wonderful performances.  I am on the fence about Sarah Polley.  I understood her position and her motives but there were times she left me cold.  On the whole,  this cast including Beowulf's comrades in arms, took me on this quest, the journey of questions that maybe have no answers, only hope.  What more could I ask for.  <br /> <br />I thoroughly enjoyed this film, the incredible scenery and the excellent performances.  Not your usual fare, but something exquisitely different.
B000000OQF|5.0|GNR are great...They are one of my all time favourite bands along with Metallica. My favorite songs on this are Sweet Child of Mine, and Rocket Queen. I would suggest you get this with Metallica's 3 best albums in Ride The Lightning, Master of Puppets, and Black Album today. <br />
B000FGGE68|5.0|First of all I have to say that I like every kind of movie and this one actually surprised me! I know it's not perfect but it's worth every cent, especially for Milla! <br />Many movies are slammed by the audience and the critics, film such as Catwoman (which I liked very much, and I have it in my dvd collection!) or an Uwe Boll film (I only watched Alone in the dark, which was not that bad, and soon I'm going to watch Bloodrayne)... <br />You should give this movie a try! I'm not telling you to buy but at least rent it! It's entertaining!
B00004Y6NV|5.0|I love Dire Straits. They are one of the most enjoyable bands of all time next to Metallica. On Every Street is my favorite album <br />by them and Heavy Fuel is my favorite song of all time. Buy it along with Brothers in Arms, and Love over Gold today. <br />
B00008EY65|4.0|An overall good movie.  In a day in which every other comic book is getting its own movie, this is better then most.<br /><br />Ron Perlman is excellent as always and remains own of the most underrated actors of all time.<br /><br />For fans of the comic book, comic book movies, and films such as Van Helsing and Evolution, then you will like Hellboy.
B000000OF6|1.0|Queen are one annoying band! I can't stand lousy awful songs like We Are The Champions, Another One Bites The Dust, and Bohemian Rhapsody. They got to be one of the worst bands besides Lynyrd Skynyrd, The Beatles, and Pink Floyd. They are not anything driving like Metallica. Do me a quick favor, and avoid this boring lousy band and get any album from Dire Straits insted. They will always be legends.
B000E41MS6|5.0|I have been watching Doctor Who for over 22 years, and I am pretty sure that I have seen nearly every episode except for the new ones that are not available on DVD yet from the BBC (from 2006). If you liked the old episodes -- in particular, Tom Baker's -- you will love this series. It has all of the old charm: a sense of humor, the Doctor's silly smile and desire to jump into danger, the lack of severe physical violence, the Doctor's respect for women and youth, and a couple of the Doctor's old enemies. However, you can add excellent effects, great sets, decent music, and the best directing and acting of any Doctor Who series bar none.  <br />     The writing is good, not quite as heavy on the pseudo-science-techno-bable of the old Tom Baker episodes, but it is good. Also, I don't normally appreciate cute, blonde actresses. As a matter of fact, Billie(Rose) had a lot to prove to me so that I wouldn't think she was just picked for her cute looks, but she did a fantastic job. Christopher (the Doctor) ties for first right up at the top with Tom Baker. It is too bad that this is a one season Doctor, but it will go on my shelf as a permanent part of my collection. An excellent series. Great acting. Good entertainment.  <br /> <br />Will
B000002KHH|1.0|Yuck!! I hate this overrated band, Black Sabbath. Anyone who gives this awful band 5 stars are a jerk. I know my girlfriend, Waiting for a Girl Like You dosen't listen to this kind of music <br />dosen't she. She listens to my legends such as Metallica, Dire Straits, Green Day, Foreigner, GNR, and Nirvana. Don't buy this awful album, go get Metallica Black Album insted. <br /> <br />Metallica Rocks So Hard.
0345347951|3.0|I read through the first half of this book in a very short amount of time, it was very interesting and very well written.  But it became evident about half-way through the book that the story wasn't really going anywhere.  This created an anti-climatic, disappointing end to the story.  The idea of aliens is a common thread to science fiction, but this story is like nothing I have ever read, much more philosophical than plot motivated.  The problem though, is that I didn't understand what the author was trying to get at through the philosophical driven story.  This could have been a deficiency in my own thinking, but either way, I didn't get much out of it.<br /><br />The following are a few parts of the story I would have liked to seen elaborated on.  The human opposition in the early part of the book only got a few pages, and then was totally dropped.  I would have liked to have known what the true feelings of the overlords were toward this resistance, and also what other conflict the Overlords would have experienced on other planets.  That leads to another part of the story that seemed lacking- the other parts of the universe which had experienced the same things that the earth did.  It would have been helpful and enjoyable to see how other species reacted to the overlords and the impending doom (if that is how you want to see it) that they brought.  And lastly, what happens after the humans join the `force'?  What is next?  Are they truly lost into a melting pot of species consciousness?  Also, it would have been interesting to get a better look into the lives of the Overlords.  What really makes them different than humans?  Was there ever an Overlord resistance to the `force?'  I plan on reading more of Clarke, for it is clear he is a good writer, but Childhood's End was a disappointment.
B000002H97|5.0|I can't get enough of this band as they are great! They are one of my favorite bands period! On this album, I've liked each and every song..The weakest songs are probably NOTHING ELSE MATTERS, and OF WOLF AND MAN. I think Nothing Else Matters makes me think <br />too much of my girlfriend, Waiting For A Girl Like You as she's stuck in the rain and makes me a little bit sad. The rest of the other songs are fine. This album came out when I was just born. So on my 15th birthday, I'm gonna play this great album. The best songs are ENTER SANDMAN, UNFORGIVEN, WHEREVER I MAY ROAM, GOD THAT FAILED, and MY FRIEND OF MISERY. I can't get enough of those tunes. If you don't have this great record, please get it right now..it is one of the best metal albums ever!! Get this with Foreigner 4 today.
B000F3AAUW|5.0|Cee-Lo is a very versatile musician, in lyrics and sound.  I love all his work, and this cd with Danger Mouse is literally amazing and very good from beginning to end.  My favorites on the cd are Crazy, St Elsewhere, Smiley Faces, Boogie Monster, Just A Thought, Necromancer.  I think anyone who purchases this cd will be amazed and and pleased with it.
B00008BXJG|1.0|I think I'll go with the previous 1 star reviewer, Waiting. AC/DC <br />are one of the worst most boring lousiest bands of all time. They <br />are even worse than Nirvana and have no talent. This album only has 1 good song in the title track. Rest of the other songs are really, really awful. Avoid this lousy album at all costs along with Back in Blacka and get On Every Street from Dire Straits insted.
B00000JCOV|1.0|Slipknot, the 24438484 man group and counting, that everyone either really, really hates or really, really loves. And I am the former.<br /><br />What makes me hate this band? Is it the bazillion group members they have? The wanna-be Kiss-like secret identities? Or how about the lame powerchords, sloppy drumming, bad yelling, and turntables? Hmm, probally all of them. But what really irritates me are the fans, and I dont mean the ones that play this once or twice, maybe three times a week. Im talking about the ones that listen to this 24/7, whos entire wardrobe is nothing but Slipknot shirts and black baggy pants, and whose character is that of a used condom. That thing alone is enough to go out and break some kneecaps.<br /><br />Why is this band taken overboard so much? Why does this over-rated rapcore band still exist? How much d1ck did they have to suck to get their angst ridden song Wait and Bleed voted as one of the top 40 metal songs of all time (even though greatest ___ compilations almost always suck, that had me cracking up for well over an hour.)<br /><br />And as for the Corey Taylor groupies, I mean Slipknot fanatics out their, how about growing up and stop thinking about yourselves? Ever heard of the Malaysian slaves who toil away in a sweatshop so you could wear that pathetic Slipknot hoodie?<br /><br />Well, as for good music, many of you probally wouldnt know good metal if it d1ckslapped you in the face, but try out Opeth's Ghost Reveries and Slayers Christ Illusion due out soon if you want some quality metal.
B000002H33|5.0|Metallica are great!!! Master of Puppets is a good CD that has a few terrific songs in Battery, and Orion!! I suggest you get this great CD with Ride The Lightning, and Black Album today. <br />
B000002G7G|5.0|After two mold-breaking classic albums, \\"The Velvet Underground and Nico\\" (1967) and \\"White Light/White Heat,\\" (1968) founding member John Cale was fired from the group and replaced by Doug Yule. While the loss of the avant-garde classically trained Cale, arguably the most artistic member of the band, in favor of the vanilla Yule, may have seemed like a major misstep, it actually wasn't a hindrance at all. While Cale and Reed were both sort of copilots on the first two albums, the loss of Cale and the addition of Yule gave Reed full artistic carte-blanche, allowing him to point the band in the direction that he wanted to go. While Cale favored experimentation and an abrasive sound, Reed favored a softer, more polished one. This is clearly evident on \\"The Velvet Underground,\\" (1969) the band's first post-Cale album, which is far less course and far more conventional than its predecessors.<br /><br />While Cale is responsible for the ultramodern styling of the band's first two albums, and he is no doubt far more inspired and original than his replacement Yule, his absence on \\"The Velvet Underground\\" isn't really mourned. As the solo leader of the group, Reed took the band in a softer, more contemplative, yet haunting direction. A clear influence of folk music is also apparent.<br /><br />In contrast to the band's first two albums, Reed's singing is more submissive and the songs more confessional. The sound of \\"The Velvet Underground\\" is probably most akin to \\"Sunday Morning\\" from \\"The Velvet Underground and Nico.\\" In addition, while morose at times, especially on \\"Pale Blue Eyes,\\" overall the album is more hopeful and optimistic than its processors.<br /><br />Drummer Maureen Tucker and guitarist Sterling Morrison who had played on the band's first two albums rounded out the rest of the lineup. While Morrison wasn't the lead guitarist in the band, as he traded off lead and rhythm parts with Reed, his guitar work remains underappreciated as his playing helped define the band's sound. While Tucker wasn't the most important member of the group, her contributions should not be overlooked either, as her offbeat styling also was integral to the sound of the Velvet Underground.<br /><br />It should be noted that while on tour, the band's vox amplifiers were stolen, which also accounts for a change in the band's tone.<br /><br />Newcomer Yule sings on the opening dreamlike \\"Candy Says\\" which is as light as a feather yet unforgettable and tranquilizing. The hard-rocking \\"What Goes On\\" features a really cool interplay with simultaneous organ and guitar solos. The offbeat \\"Some Kind of Love,\\" is a sort of Country/Folk hybrid with a somewhat ambiguous but sexual theme. Probably the album's highlight, the beautiful \\"Pale Blue Eyes\\" may be the most personal, most melancholy song Reed ever penned. With its theme of unrequited or otherwise unattainable love, Reed wears his heart on his shoulder and seems despondent yet coping. While much of the band's previous work seemed to have embraced nihilism and drugs as an escape, \\"Jesus\\" seems to offer a glimmer of hope, as Reed pleas with a higher power to help him find his way. The soft-spoken vocals and supporting background vocals never saw the band sound more poignant. The infectious and poppy sing-along \\"Beginning to see the Light\\" demonstrate Reed's pop-craft mastery, in this optimistic number. \\"I'm set Free\\" continues this optimism, as Reed seems to pronounce himself free of inner demons. The song is epic and grand, as it slowly builds until Reed's release and total declaration of overcoming his inner-plight. \\"That's the Story of my Life\\" is a short little ditty which also demonstrates Reed's more upbeat outlook. \\"The Murder Mystery\\" takes the album in a 180 degree turn and doesn't sound unlike \\"The Gift\\" from \\"White Light/White Heat.\\" With its barrage of simultaneous vocals and offbeat organs with repetitive guitars, Cale himself would have been proud to have penned such an offbeat, way-out song. Reed asked Maureen Tucker to sing of the album's closer \\"After Hours,\\" as he himself felt that the song was too naive and wholesome for him to sing himself. (Source Wikipedia)<br /><br />While \\"The Velvet Underground\\" may not be as immediately breathtaking and stunning as the band's first two albums, it is no less grand. Over time and with repeated listens, the album only gets better and better. Its sparse, haunting confessionals and humanistic touch makes the album truly shine. Some indie rock artists site \\"The Velvet Underground\\" as an influence. (Source Wikipedia)<br /><br />It should be noted that there are two versions of the album, one by sound engineer Val Valentin and one by Reed himself. The one by Reed is called \\"the closet mix\\" and is available on the band's massive, definitive box set \\"Peel Slowly and See\\" (1995). The other, more well-known version is the one available here. As the title suggests, \\"the closet mix\\" is somewhat stuffy, sounding as though it were recorded in a closet. While some fans don't care for that particular mix, it has a certain charm and quality of its own that is wholly unique. It is recommend for fans to listen to both versions. So even if you already own the \\"Peel Slowly and See\\" boxset, pick up this non-closet mix as well.at, way-out song.

B00004Y6NU|5.0|Don't read all tbe 1 star reviewers as they will kick you out. <br />Love Over Gold is my favourite DS album after Brothers in Arms, and On Every Street. Telegraph Road has to be one of the greatest most rocking songs I have ever heard. Get this with albums from Green Day, Nirvana, Foreigner, GNR, and Metallica but avoid all albums from crappy bands like the Cars, and the Beatles who suck.
B000FIMHJ4|4.0|After achieving almost overnight success with their debut album \\"Look What the Cat Dragged In,\\" (1986) Pennsylvania's Poison returned two years later with their sophomore release \\"Open Up and Say Ahh!\\" (1988).<br /><br />Much like any Poison album, upon its release most critics hated, hated, hated the album. But Poison aren't Elvis Costello; Poison has always been a band of the people rather than the darling of the critics. And the people spoke. \\"Open Up and Say Ahh!\\" was another huge smash for the band, selling more than eight million copies world-wide, yielding several hit singles/videos and radio/concert staples.<br /><br />Compared to the punky/glam styling of the debut, \\"Open Up and Say Ahh!\\" is more meat-and-potatoes. The total over-the-top outrageousness and quirkiness that made \\"Look What the Cat Dragged In\\" so much fun is eschewed, in favor of making a KISS/Van Halen-esque, AOR friendly stadium-rock album. This ultimately worked in the band's favor as they avoided remaking the same album yet came up with another solid collection of songs, moving the band forward.<br /><br />Like most albums of its type, \\"Open Up and Say Ahh!\\" is based upon having a few songs that will be the hits and padding them with filler. Even if one is completely unfamiliar with the album, the singles are obvious; the (light-weight) head-banging \\"Nothin' but a Good Time,\\" the lush \\"Fallen Angel,\\" the power-balled to end all power-ballads, \\"Every Rose has its Thrown,\\" and a song that's already a hit, a cover of \\"Your Mamma Don't Dance.\\"<br /><br />However, even if the aforementioned songs are what the album is sold on, the rest of the album is still pretty strong, even if it is just \\"filler.\\" The opening \\"Love on the Rocks\\" is rocking and has proven to be a regular concert staple. \\"Back to the Rocking Horse\\" is melodic and infectious while the rest of the album isn't too shabby either. While C.C. Deville may never be put on Rolling Stone's list of the world's all-time greatest guitarists, the dude is more than capable of churning out tasty riffs and solos. Singer Brett Michel's charisma is infectious, making it hard not to rock along with his songs. As for Bobby Dall (bass) and Rikki Rocket (drums)...ahh, they can play...<br /><br />Some causal fans may not want to buy this album as they can pick up the hits on one of the band's compilation albums, the most recent being \\"The Best of Poison: 20 Years of Rock.\\"  However, if you are more than a causal fan or are really into 80s rock in general; pick up \\"Open Up and Say Ahh!\\" as most of the non-hit, \\"filler\\" songs are still quite strong.<br /><br />The 2006 remastered edition is a huge improvement over the original CD, with a much crisper, clearer sound. The bonus tracks include \\"Livin' for the Minute\\" and the world-premier interview. While \\"Livin' for the Minute\\" may not be a lost classic, it's still a fun song and should please most fans. The interview is also pretty cool and helps put the whole album in perspective.<br /><br />An additional comment about the album's cover: The remastered edition features the original cover, a sort of man-lion with a huge phallic-like tongue. Deemed offensive, this cover has not been imprint since 1988 when the album was first released. It's amazing how standards of decency have changed in the last twenty or so years. A cover like that wouldn't raise an eye-brow today.re than capable of churning out tasty riffs and solos.

B000000OSE|4.0|This is goood..maybe not as great as the appetite or the greatest hits...Use Your Illusion came out when I was born and has terrific songs like November Rain (One of my favourite songs of all time), Dust and Bones, and Right Next Door to Hell. if you don't have it get all 3 albums today. GNR ARE JUST AS GREAT <br />AS METALLICA SO PLEASE BUY ALL 3 ALBUMS TODAY.
B0007OASII|5.0|Kamelot have always been one of the best power metal bands, and this album is probably their best yet.  The thing that sets them apart from the rest is their songwriting, with way more interesting instrumentation, less formulaic song structures, symphonic elements that aren't too cheesy, and a really awesome vocalist in Roy Khan.  This is just really solid melodic metal, with plenty of surprises, like the piano ballad \\"Abandoned\\", and the guy from Dimmu Borgir even does some vocals on \\"The March of Mephisto\\". <br /> <br />If you like power metal at all, this is a must have.  Even if you don't like power metal, it's worth checking out, as this is way better than your average power metal band.  Really cool stuff.
B000002H2H|5.0|I love Metallica, they are one of my favourite bands period! <br />Ride The Lightning is great and contains my favorite song, For Whom The Bells Toll. Get this with Master of Puppets and Black Album today. <br />
0399230033|5.0|Most of the books that my baby daughter has loved have been written before I was born, and I am an old dad.  But this book, which we received as a gift, was written after 1990, and it is a favorite in the house.  If you find yourself reading it more than once, or more than ten times (as you will) you will see little funny details that you miss on early readings.  (Check out the balloon's life throughout the book.  You don't remember a balloon?  See what I mean?)    <br /> <br />The pacing is WONDERFUL and the story is genuinely funny.  And there is a real love of children that permeates every page. <br /> <br />(I must boast - she's 11 months old and she waves at each animal after the zoo-keeper says \\"Good night\\" to it.)
B00004Y6NP|5.0|Dire Straits are legends, and are as great as all the legends of Metallica, Green Day, Foreigner, Nirvana, and Guns N Roses. Brothers in Arms is a fine album which has the best song ever in Money for Nothing. Sincerely if you don't have it, buy em all.....not kill em all.
B000E41MS6|5.0|Our whole family loved watching 'Doctor Who' and was happy to get these DVDs. We can only hope that the next season makes it over to the U.S. The characters, dialogue, and even bad guys, were interesting and clever. Thanks.

B000FILW86|5.0|This is without a doubt one of Cheap Tricks greatest albums. This time they've got it. Once again this record proves that although most rock can seem formulaic great music smashes the formula within any genre. The songwriting is fantastic, the lyrics have great meaning within the band, everyone is playing with a ferver not heard in bands of this age in years. With the death of John Entwhistle of The Who the mantle of rock's greatest bass player who isn't Paul McCartney passes to Tom Petersson. As the only person on the planet to ever master the instrument he helped invent, the twelve string bass, his playing on this CD is majestic. If you only buy one CD this year make it this one.
B0002OERI0|5.0|I love Green Day. They are legends! They are 30 times much better than lousy bands like the Cars, and the Beatles. American Idiot is a great recent album of mine and has terrific songs in Jesus of Suburbia, Holiday, and Give Me Novacaine. This one is a must have so please buy this with the other legends that rock and get this with Warning today. <br />
B000E6GBV2|2.0|Despite all the other opinions, I find that they sound much more like Porno for Pyros (Perry Farrell's post-Jane's Addiction band) than My Morning Jacket.  They are much poppier and, IMHO, more boring than MMJ.  This is very run-of-the-mill stuff that doesn't stand up to repeated listenings.  I liked it most after a single spin, and my enthusiasm has shrank with each repeat to the point that I can't imagine a mood that would warrant another listen.
B00004ZAV3|1.0|Too bad I can't go even more below one star. The Beatles are one of the worst bands I have ever heard. They are lousy, stupid, overrated, and lame. This album only has 1 good song in Ballad Of John and Yoko. Rest of the other songs are bad! Metallica is <br />much better than this..go get Ride The Lightning, Master of Puppets, and Black Album insted and don't listen to the 5 star <br />reviewers of this pathetic disaster. <br />PS. BEATLES AND PINK FLOYD ARE PURE TRASH SO AVOID ALL ALBUMS <br />FROM THOSE BANDS.
B00005NVDF|4.0|After Take the Money and Bananas but before Annie Hall, this movie is Woody at his very funniest but with relationships and personal growth as themes nicely holding the jokes together. <br />I have seen this movie maybe 20 times and still laugh.  Plan to show it to my teenage kids.....I really think they will laugh and enjoy it too.  Diane Keaton is sooo young.  Woody is so comfortable making fun of himself. Also can not believe how many \\"jokes\\", lines, from this movie that I have been using these past 30 years plus.........\\"I was no where near Oakland!\\"
B0000TLA9G|5.0|I think I'll go with the reviewer \\"The Kid Who Loves Waiting for a Girl Like You\\"..I think GNR are one of the best bands along with Green Day. This greatest hits album contains all these classic hits like Sweet Child of Mine, and November Rain. I can't get enough of Civil War. Do yourself a favor and get this with all 3 Metallica albums and avoid crappy lousy bands like Pink Floyd, and the Beatles who suck.

Both were tremendous stories and I would recommend them to everyone who wants action! Can't wait for John Corey's next adventure.  And when are they going to make a MOVIE? <br />
B000002J09|1.0|This is it!!! The most boring band in history. Led Zeppelin...<br /><br />I hate this band. They are just as bad as Pink Floyd,and The Beatles and never made anything decent. They are overrated, stupid, lousy, and lame. This album only has 1 good song in Stairway to Heaven. Rest of the other songs are really, really bad. Metallica and Dire Straits are much better than this, avoid this and go with the bands I mentioned who are actully great and enjoyable and avoid all albums from LED ZEPPELIN who suck.<br /><br />Don't read the previous 5 star reviewer, LED ZEPPELIN ARE LEGENDS. He can go straight back to hell or heaven.
B0007CNXUK|5.0|This movie was moving, and as always, Johnny Depp's performance was flawless.   <br /> <br />I got this movie on a whim because I love fairy tales and older Disney movies, and I love hearing history of where certain things came from.  So I had heard this story but the way I heard it, he was having the affair.  I love the way this movie was done, the intimacy and the tenderness and the closeness of Johnny Depp's character to the little boys was touching.   <br /> <br />I recommend this movie for a couple to watch, because watching it alone will make you feel lonely. <br /> <br />
B00006M183|4.0|Thinking this record would never grow on me when it was released I was kind of dissapointed, and hope better for their next one. Good job this one slowly started to sound better and better each time becuase their latest one is an absolute chore to listen to, and is sooooo boring, the music is so formulic. <br /> <br />Anyway the album starts of in the same way \\"No Code\\" did, slow lower temp sounding song, and resonibily short as you'd expect. <br /> <br />And then like \\"No Code\\" again, edgingly thuds into the opening guitar of Save You. (Except Hail Hail, sort of crashes- but anyway). <br />Its actually quite a strong album, despite the songs don't sound like anything they've ever done before, the way some of the songs are arranged is unusual, and some like \\"Save You\\" and \\"Love Boat Captain\\" do have a chorus that sounds the same but different words to it each time, this is why it takes a while to sink in. <br /> <br />Anyway, its a pretty good album  especially compared to their latest which should'nt be considered a Pearl Jam album anyway.
B00005JOX6|3.0|I liked the movie.  A lot.   <br /> <br />It was about a man that was working so hard to improve his family's life that he loses sight of what's really important.  There is an analogy in the movie that relates the Lucky Charms leprechan to Adam Sandler's character, because he's always chasing a pot of gold and a rainbow that just ends up being cornflakes.  I thought it was a beautiful story and had an amazing lesson. <br /> <br />That said.  The movie is about Adam Sandler getting a remote that controls his life, and what happens when his \\"prefrences\\" go out of control.  The remote allows him to fast forward through things that would ordinarily cause him stress and delays.  Like, showers, sex, and deadlines at work.  Once he uses the remote one too many times, it automatically flashes through the aspects of his life that he had previously chose to skip through.  He ended up missing his kids grow up, missing out so much on his marriage that he got divorced (autopilot), and missing his father's funeral.  It was so sad.  But, it was all his decisions. <br /> <br />His wife was brilliant in the movie and beautiful.  I don't know her name but you have seen her in movies like Underworld where she's kicking butt.  I enjoyed seeing a softer side.  And I love Adam Sandler with his softer side showing alongside his comedy. <br /> <br />But, I'm not really a slapstick person and used MY remote (thank you bootlegs) to flash through parts that I didn't like, such as him playing with the setting on himself for color.  That was stupid. <br /> <br />I would recommend watching this one, it's a great chick flick.
B000ETQRCM|1.0|This is just awful, they sound completley washed out and lifeless on this album, a huge dissapointment, get any other Pearl Jam release except this one.
B000B8QEZG|5.0|Late in the 1990s saw the rise of Post Grunge music.  The elements of Post Grunge music contain simple chord progressions and gentle verses followed by louder choruses. For whatever reason, Post Grunge sounds became 2006's dominant form of music. Many longtime popular music fans have accused this type of music of being very \\"cookie cutter\\" and all sounding the same.  While this movement was taking place, Disco was also going through a revival of some sorts on the dance club scene integrating many of the themes from the 1970s.  For the most part, the revival was pretty stale with nothing groundbreaking and no big name artists participating in the revival - thus putting Disco in a similar \\"cookie cutter\\" mold.   So along comes the controversial Madonna - who I felt had lost some of her musical edge in recent years.   Madonna had been dabbling in techo style music in recent years, however on this album, \\"Confessions on a Dance Floor\\" - not only does Madonna get it right, but she adds a spark to both the Disco revival and the Pop music scene.  It is this impact on the pop music scene that proves there is more to radio music than Post Grunge.  She also come full circle in her career going back to her dance club roots.  The result is so successful that this might be considered the best album of 2006 (while it was released in late 2005). <br /> <br />To give the album a feel of \\"dance club\\", Madonna employs fast tempo'd songs with a European Dance Club feel - with each song segueing into the next.   As mentioned the tracks bring back a feel for the Disco revival - employing the classic bass sound found on many dance club songs.  This album isn't going to demonstrate deep lyrics (although they are stronger than one might think) or intricate instrumentation.   By going for a Dance Club sound, the mixing and engineering of the album.  Much of the credit for creating this sound has to go to co-producer Stuart Price. Price is known for his remixing skills and has a lot of experience with techo-dance sounds.    Ultimately, Madonna is going to deliver some powerful vocals that will put this album over the top. <br /> <br />Here is a quick song by song synopsis:  <br /> <br />\\"Hung Up\\":  This song takes a sample from Abba's \\"Gimme Gimme Gimme\\" and builds a very catchy \\"Euro Disco\\" sound around it.   Madonna's vocals shine - particularly midway through the song when she sings \\"Don't cry for me...\\".  That was a reference to her \\"Evita\\" role.   The line \\"Time goes by slowly for those who wait\\" is a line from her 1989 duet with Prince on \\"Love Song\\". <br /> <br />\\"Get Together\\": For this song, the tempo is slightly slowed down.  This song is the perfect \\"change of pace\\" song following the high-paced \\"Hung Up\\".  The change of tempo is often done in dance clubs. While not a sample \\"Baby we can do it\\" reminds me of the SOS Band's \\"Take Your Time\\". <br /> <br />\\"Sorry\\": The European feel is really emphasized in this song with Madonna saying \\"I'm Sorry\\" in several different European languages at the beginning and end (she adds Hebrew at the end).   The song then segues into more of a modern dance feel. <br /> <br />\\"Future Lovers\\": Many have said they hear a sampling of Donna Summer's \\"I Feel Love\\" in this song.   There definitely is a parallel as you hear a similar beat in the background, but I wouldn't call it a sample.   Madonna makes use of spoken words at he beginning. Once again, this song employs a modern dance club spin. <br /> <br />\\"I Love New York\\": This Madonna's tribute to New York.   She does take some shots at Los Angeles, London, and Paris.   While the song is good, when she uses \\"Other places make me feel like a dork\\" - it was a reach for rhyming with \\"New York\\". <br /> <br />\\"Let It Will Be\\": The opening classical style chords sound a bit like \\"Papa Don't Preach\\", but then song slowly evolves into a high-tempo dance song. Great vocals by Madonna.  Lyrically it might be the strongest song as Madonna puts a semi-autobiographical spinon things. <br /> <br />\\"Forbidden Love\\": The tempo slows for this song.   Madonna employs some computer augmented voices throughout the song - giving it a haunting quality. <br /> <br />\\"Jump\\": This might be the best song on the collection.  While not a sample, I can almost hear a bit of the faint background from the Pet Shop Boys' \\"West End Girls\\".   This song is high tempo and high energy - driven by Madonna's vocals.  Lyrically this one is also good as again Madonna draws a lot from her own life experiences. <br /> <br />\\"How High\\": After the high energy \\"Jump\\", there is a slight down tempo.  This song does use some computer augmented vocals as well.  I found this one of the weaker tracks. <br /> <br />\\"Isaac\\": This song generated a lot of controversy with its Judaism connection. This song makes use of Hebrew chants.   I found the use of the chants to be something different and out of the box.   Listen to how Madonna positions her vocals along-side Yitzhak Sinwani's chant and words - its near flawless. The dance beat even employs a Jewish feel to it - and is high tempo again.  Removing the controversy aside, it's a very solid track. <br /> <br />\\"Push\\": This probably is the most modern sounding dance song on this collection.   Not a bad song, but I wouldn't put it among the album's strongest. <br /> <br />\\"Like It or Not\\": This song employs a funk-like beat to it.  Once again Madonna comments on her own experiences and perceptions of what others think of her. <br /> <br />It's too bad the lyrics weren't included with this album.  Overall, this album breaks the mold of the cookie-cutter music of the 2000's.   It provides a retro style while incorporating some modern sounds and provides a true \\"dance club\\" sound.  Highly recommended.
B000EULJLU|1.0|The album sounds dreadful, absolute crap, it took them 4 years to make this heap of bollix. The packaging is lame as well.

B000066I6N|3.0|When I first got this CD I wrote a bad review of it. But after listening to it for a while more closely It's not that bad. I guess I had heard such great things about it that when I got it my expectations were so high that I was disappointed when it turned out to be just a CD. There are some really outstanding cuts here Darkness Darkness, Another Cup of Coffee and Funny in My Mind to name a few. I'm still not happy with the production and sound quality though. Maybe it's suppose to have that retro feel or Robert in the raw touch?  I understand that they have remastered it and improved the sound quality and have added two additional tracks, get that version if you can. Also if you re write your review you cannot change the star rating I would probably give it a 4 or higher now...
0679746048|5.0|Anyone who has watched this movie without first reading the book wants to see inside the journal Susanna is constantly writing in.<br /><br />In my experience a book typically has a lot more information about each character and a lot more situations to have them in than the movie version would. This book was the first exception to that rule that I have ever come across.<br /><br />Girl, interrupted had less interaction with the characters than the movie did but offered a more in depth look into how Susanna felt about her illness, the ward, and ultimately the world.<br /><br />I read this book in one day, I absolutely could not put it down.<br /><br />I recommend Girl, Interrupted just as highly as I would recommend The Bell Jar by Sylvia Plath. It is truly on that same level.<br /><br />I urge anyone who is even considering this book to read it, you may gain a whole new outlook on not only the differences but the similarities of the \\"sane\\" and the \\"insane\\".
B000E97Y6K|4.0|One of our neighbors loaned my husband his copy. I didn't want to see it for two reasons. The biggest was it's too long. In my opinion, no movie should be over 3 hours long. The other is I've watched both the 1933 original version and the 1976 one with Jessica Lange.  <br /> <br />I walked in when the woman was being offered to Kong by the natives. That's where it gets interesting so I sat and watched the rest. I don't feel I really missed anything. And I have to admit that it was pretty darn good. The time went fast with all the magnificent special effects. And even if I thought the plot of Kong and Ann Darrow (played this time by Naomi Watts) silly, it did manage to be touching at times. Well, at least I felt for the big beast.  <br /> <br />I think anyone can enjoy this movie once. It's a good popcorn movie.
B000FS9FCQ|4.0|I simply adore this film. It's intelligent, sophisticated, emotional, vivid, beautiful, well written, well acted, and well filmed. I saw it in the theater 5 times, I just kept feeling pulled back to it. I cried like a baby every time I saw it. It's utterly brilliant. If it were for the movie alone, I'd unquestionably rate it 5 stars. <br /> <br />Such a pity, then, that the DVD transfer has obvious video problems. Particularly, the video brightness pulsates ever so slightly on about a twice a second rate. In scenes with bright color and lots of motion it's hardly noticable, but this is a story told in shades of black, so it gets rather glaring at times. In many scenes where the foreground subject, such as a person, takes up only a small part of the screen and the rest is a murky background, the background seems to subtly pulse and throb behind the person. It can get distracting. <br /> <br />I'm rating this DVD 4 stars because of this icky video problem, which I feel should have been caught and corrected before any discs were sold. I'm tempted to rate it 3 stars for that reason, but I just can't bring myself to give such a low rating to such an unbelievable film strictly for technical reasons.
B000E33VWW|4.0|I remember reading In Cold Blood when I was a teenager but don't remember the details. I've always thought Capote was an interesting character and Philip Seymour Hoffman an above average actor. So I knew I was going to see this movie sooner or later.  <br /> <br />Hoffman didn't disappoint me and kept the movie interesting, but I wasn't as enthralled as I thought I would be. Perhaps it's a case of high expectations. I wasn't sure watching it if Capote did feel real compassion for Perry Smith the intelligent talented and dare I say sensitive murderer or if he was fascinated with him for personal reasons. One line that stayed with me was Capote saying \\"It's as if Perry and I grew up in the same house. And one day he went out the back door and I went out the front.\\" At the end of writing his book he was drinking excessively and near a nervous breakdown (which he did have later). He didn't want to publish the book until the two killers were hung. They keep getting a stay of execution.  <br /> <br />I found Capote, or at least the film's version of him as an intriguing and complicated man. I'll probably look up some more about him because the movie did get me interested in Capote as a person.
B000002KIE|5.0|Let's get a few things straight. They may have been manufactured, on a major label, blah, blah, blah. Who cares? The Sex Pistols were one of the greatest rock 'n' roll bands ever and this album is as essential as it has been hyped to be.  <br /> <br />For all those moronic 19 year old \\"punks\\" (the kind who can't accept the fact that punk is dead) who complain about The Pistols being poseurs because they preached anarchy and where on a major label, well you don't get it. The Pistols never had any desire to make a political or social change. They weren't anarchists, they were nihilists. They wanted to shock and piss people off as much as they could. And you know what? They did a damn good job. The lyrics are biting and sarcastic, and more often than not hilarious. Also, the riffs are fantastic. Can this be said about Crass and their inept \\"Lets destroy Margaret Tatcher\\" diatribe (zzzz)? The Pistols could actually write a song. Besides, even if they were poseurs or not, that doesn't matter anymore (its been almost 30 years). All that matters is the fact the music has stood the test of time. <br /> <br />For all the classic rock fans and hippies who complain about The Pistols not being able to play, well you miss the point also. Punk was never about the lame theatrical dynamics that plagued a lot of your dull dinosaur bands. It was about showing the fact that anyone could make a great rock 'n' roll band. All that was nessescary for rock 'n' roll since its original incarnation was three or four chords and a catchy melody. This has been true since rockabilly in the 50s. The dinosaur bands from the time such as The Eagles and Queen needed to be destroyed for their crimes against rock 'n' roll. <br /> <br />Finally, for the person who said Green Day and The Offspring are great but The Pistols are not. Sorry to say, but even the aforementioned bands would disagree. <br /> <br />This album has stood the test of time. It is essential and great from begining to end.
B00005JM1F|3.0|It was silly and goofy as expected. I actually laughed a few times. I got this movie because I read that it was funny and it was. Not rolling on the floor tears coming down my face funny but funny enough. I'll never will be a big fan of either Vince Vaughn or Will Ferrell but they did okay this time. <br />
1400049628|5.0|Okay, he's the son of Mel Brooks, so we can expect him to be a loon...but The Zombie Survival Guide: Complete Protection from the Living Dead is HILARIOIUS!  It's also really well done, and would make a funny movie.  I can never look at my beloved zombie flicks the same way again. <br />
B0001XAPX8|2.0|British actor Anthony Hopkins was playing a African-American man who pretends he's Jewish. Hopkins did the role well and he managed to make me forget that he's playing a Black man from New Jersey. I can understand learning to speak properly but you don't pick up a slightly British accent. That would be pretentious. I just think there are actors that could have been more believable as Coleman Silk. Coleman is accused of racism after using the word \\"spook\\" when he mean \\"specter\\" or \\"ghost\\" because two students never appeared in his class. He never met them so he didn't know they were Black. <br /> <br />Nicole Kidman was playing a woman who came from a rich family who ran away from home at 14 after being sexually molested by her stepfather. She got on my nerves because she came across as she was on smack in every single scene. Coleman Silk falls in love with her despite the fact she seems psycho. I found it impossible to feel sorry Nicole's character. I thought she was capable of doing what her Vietnam Vet husband accused her of.  <br /> <br />The best part of the movie were the flashbacks that Coleman (Anthony Hopkins) had of his youth. A younger Coleman was played by Wentworth Miller who was much more believable. <br /> <br />I don't want to say too much about the movie. I bet the book by Philip Roth is better and if anyone is interested maybe should read that instead.  <br />
B000059TEP|5.0|I bought this on a whim from Amazon...haven't seen it in years and thought it would be way too dated and corny; but it holds up pretty well.  Worth watching, and if you do then bring a date.  Definitely a chick flick.

2218717166|5.0|I am a serious francophile and am preparing to live in France for a few months with my wife.  I have been reading extensively in preparation for our trip.  A reasonable understanding of french verbs will be critical if I am to communicate effectively with the people of France.  I have used and become quite familiar with the following verb books:  \\"501 French Verbs\\" and the \\"Blue book of 555 French Verbs\\".  First of all let me say that both are fine books.  I will say that the explanations about what the different tenses and moods actually mean are better in the \\"555\\" than \\"501\\".  In terms of the physical size of the books I would say that they are BIG (\\"501\\") and BIGGER (\\"555\\").  \\"501\\" lists an additional 1500 or so verbs and \\"555\\" lists an additional 2500.<br /><br />I have recently finished reading the french version of \\"Bescherelle - 12000 verbs\\".  I needed to look up a few words in the grammar section in order to fully grasp the ideas.  My understanding of the tenses and moods increased exponentially.  The writing style was highly lucid and direct.  Just the grammar section alone was worth the cost of the book for me and well worth the effort to translate it fully on my own.  The conjugation tables, as alluded to in other fine reviews, simply blow the competition away.  The brilliant (literally and figuratively) verb charts are a masterpiece of organization and memory enhancing devices.  The verb charts alone are worth twice the cost of the book.  Finally, there is the index of ALL 12000 VERBS IN THE ENTIRE FRENCH LANGUAGE.  This is far more than in \\"501\\" or \\"555\\".  Incredibly, \\"Bescherelle\\" packs this punch into a book a tiny fraction of the size of the competition.  This book should be on the shelf of EVERY student of the french language be they a beginner or hard-core linguistic master.
0553804677|4.0|\\"The Lies of Locke Lamora\\"-- the first novel by Scott Lynch-- is an excellent first novel and start to a series. <br /> <br />Locke is a very enjoyable protagonist, and his capers-- whether monetary or 'vindicative'-- were thoroughly entertaining. <br /> <br />Lynch lost his way, a bit, during the last third of the book, but recovered nicely at the end. <br /> <br />It's not the best thing since sliced bread, but it is much better than the vast quantity of tripe in the Fantasy sphere.   <br /> <br />Give it a read, you won't be sorry.

B00006AW2G|2.0|I do want to clarify that this review is not of the album Let it Bleed, which is one of the all time greats in rock history, but of the misrepresentation given by Universal Music Group about the release. <br /> <br />This album was released advertised as an SACD Hybrid disc.  I see that it no longer is.  The inference is that the audio is 5.1.  It is not.  If you purchase this or any of the ABKCO re-release discs expecting 5.1 audio you will be disappointed.
B000FVQM2Y|2.0|I was not originally planning to review this film, as it didn't make much of an impression on me. What changed my mind was the fact that all of the reviews posted so far are highly favorable, so I felt a dissenting opinion should be represented. I had heard that Brick was done in film noir style set in a modern high school. What I didn't realize until I started watching it is how far they took this gimmick. Brick is not really pure film noir; it has a strange, surreal style of its own. The settings are mostly deserted landscapes. The school that these \\"kids\\" attend is usually devoid of students, aside from the few who are playing in the scene. Characters are frequently shown lethargically lying on the pavement. There is a perpetual mood of exaggerated somberness. I'm sure there is a deep explanation of what this is supposed to convey or symbolize, but I just found it oppressively dull after a few minutes. The high school characters exist in a world almost devoid of adults. In this respect, it is reminiscent of Bugsy Malone, the musical gangster movie starring all children. That film, however, was lighthearted and unapologetically silly. Brick, by contrast, is heavy, serious and stilted. It's hard to judge the acting in a film like this. I suppose, given the concept and direction, they all do a pretty good job. Joseph Gordon-Levitt does a fine impression of a teen-aged Bogart --if you can buy into it. In a way, the super-cool teens of Brick are magnified versions of the hipster cast of shows like Beverly Hills 90210. While most teens in real life are a balance between cool and self-conscious awkwardness, in Brick everyone exhibits flawless film version sang-froid at all times.<br /><br />I should confess that I'm not a huge fan of film noir. Even when watching a classic film of this genre, or perhaps a modern David Mamet film, I may enjoy it on one level (if the acting and plot are good), but I can't help but thinking things like \\"who really talks like this all the time?\\" In Brick, what we have is a double layer of artifice -teens imitating an unnatural adult manner. I just couldn't get into it.e time?\\" In Brick, what we have is a double layer of artifice -teens imitating an unnatural adult manner. I just couldn't get into it.

B000E33VWW|5.0|'Capote' is an absorbing and fascinating ride through the life of Truman Capote.  It does draw a lot from the power of 'In Cold Blood' without being redundant to the classic movie chiller reinactment of a heinous heartland murder of an innocent family.  The film is focused, but it does retain the personal life of Capote.  It isn't a particularly flattering portrayal (although Oscar winner Phillip Seymour Hoffman certainly earned his place here), even though the unvarnished portrait isn't just a hack job--it exposes the man's vulnerabilities as well as his duplicity.  The movie shows a man of compassion with some strong human frailties to boot.  His personality comes through at cocktail parties and through his lifelong friendship with famed author Harper Lee (played with Oscar-nominated prowess by Katherine Keener).  The best scenes are when Capote interviews the killers.  The Capote story and the killer's story are well represented in this very fascinating movie biography.
B00005RDSM|4.0|Just a brief correction of the previous review.  Your heart's in the right place, Charles (fellow Atlantan!) and you're absolutely correct to insist that PETER PAN isn't a widescreen film...but KING & I most definitely WAS NOT the first widescreen movie.  That honor likely falls to Abel Gance's 1927 masterpiece NAPOLEON.  Even in the modern era, Fox had had their Cinemascope process going strong for 3 years by the time KING & I appeared.  The first Cinemascope film was THE ROBE, released on September 16, 1953, followed by BENEATH THE 12 MILE REEF the same year and then dozens of others.  It IS true that the first widescreen cartoon feature did not appear until 1956: Disney's own LADY AND THE TRAMP, also in Cinemascope.  At any rate, buyers can approach this disc with confidence; nothing at all is \\"cut-off.\\"

B000000OQF|5.0|We'll skip right to the song-by-song breakdown, since nobody wants to read my lengthy write-up.<br /><br />Welcome to the Jungle: 10/10. Hey, come on, it's Welcome to the Jungle. Cool riff? Yep. \\"Sha-na-na-na-na knees, knees!\\" thing in the chorus? Check. Slash and Izzy rockin' out? You bet. Essential GN'R listening.<br />It's So Easy: 8/10. A riff-based rocker with interesting lyrics, though the lack of a solo is reason not to like. Slightly overrated by fans, but whatever.<br />Night Train: 10/10. A completely brainless ode to getting utterly, totally, unforgivably smashed. Maybe not the most original song, but it rocks like hell, so we can forgive that.<br />Out Ta Get Me: 7.5/10. While it's kind of annoying that Axl is whining, \\"I'm f&#!ing innocent!\\" (nothing could be further from the truth), the rest of the group makes up for it. Kind of, anyway - Axl's so self-centered here it's downright annoying.<br />Mr. Brownstone: 10/10. If it were for the intro riff alone, this would be a pure ten in my book. But there's more:Adler hammers the point home with his drum kit. And those lyrics, man... a stark, honest portrayal of drug addiction, like The Velvet Underground's Heroin, only written on the streets of L.A. rather than in a New York art school. I also love Axl's lower-register vocals and the tongue-twistin' bridge (\\"I used to do a little but a little wouldn't do, so the little grew more and more\\"). If it weren't for a certain song somewhere down the line, this would be the best here.<br />Paradise City: 10/10. Seven minutes of sheer, gritty glory. This is surprisingly complex for a Top 5 hit, containing about six sections and one of the most awesome extended codas in history, with the band kicking things into overdrive and staying there. Axl's pseudo-rapping shines as well.<br />My Michelle: 10/10. Axl's twisted version of a love song - he obviously loves Michelle (his real girlfriend at the time), but since he's a borderline sociopath he also points out her faults. As usual, Slash and Izzy give their all and the rhythm section's downright fearsome.<br />Think About You: 6.5/10. Let the filler begin - an average sex song at best, though there are worse here.<br />You're Crazy: 6/10. Sorry, but I'd rather hear the far superior acoustic version on GN'R Lies. Including it on the real album would've added some variety, which I would've appreciated.<br />Sweet Child o'Mine: 10/10. An unabashedly starry-eyed tribute to a girl, you'd expect this to completely blow as a result, coming from Guns N' Roses. But it WORKS! How? Well, Axl doesn't go completely overboard with the vocal, instead choosing his usual scratchy whine, which convey much more emotion than the operatic treatment. And Slash is all over this thing, man... he came up with the famed intro riff, and delivers some smokin' wah-wah in the coda, not to mention his greatest guitar solo ever not found on November Rain. My favorite here. Amazingly, though, this ISN'T their greatest song - I'd give that title to (wait for it) November RAin.<br />Anything Goes: 5.5/10. The only real disappointment on the album, it's another lousy sex tune with lyrics seemingly nicked from Think About You.<br />Rocket Queen: 8/10. Am I the only one who finds the sex noises in the break obnoxious? Yeah, I thought so. Other than that, it's a solid, riffy rocker, though I think it's overrated by the hardcore.<br />I suppose I COULD complain about the lack of stylistic variety (it ranges from hard rock to heavy rock), but then it's the band playing their strengths (dare I say sticking to their guns?), so I can't whine about it too much. The group can PLAY, too. Too bad they lost themselves in self-indulgence, ego, and generally bad music JUST aftewards - had they continued in this direction, they might've been, as Ozzy Osbourne predicted, the next Rolling Stones. That would've been supremely cool.their all and the rhythm section's downright fearsome.   Think About You: 6.5/10. Let the filler begin - an average sex song at best, though there are worse here.

B000FGGE5Y|2.0|In the backdrop of a dazzling glass world, where the people are shiny and clean and discardable cell phones are made from paper, ULTRAVIOLET is a dreamy spectacle starring Milla Jovovich in her tightest, most ridiculous outfit yet. She belongs to a group of disease-ridden exiles called the Hemophages, whose characteristic long canines have landed them the slur \\"vampires.\\" With digital projectors, loud motorcycles, and the ability to manipulate gravity, scorned and vengeful Violet (Jovovich) is infiltrating the government's facilities to obtain a weapon that would be used to eliminate the Hemophages once and for all. <br /> <br />Sound interesting? It's not. The plot makes a cheap 180 with the introduction of a child named Six (Cameron Bright), allowing battle-hardened Violet to touch into her matronly roots - a brave stab at injecting emotion into a movie that no one expected, or wanted, to be anything more than ninety minutes of explosions and an angry hot chick. Plot threads all race to the screen at the same time, forming a scrum - oh, we gotta get a weapon, now we gotta rescue a kid, uh-oh, I'm dying, he's dying, OH WAIT, there's a cure to the virus, nope never mind, now I gotta go rescue the kid. And death, apparently, is nothing sacred to writer/director Kurt Wimmer, who mows them down and brings them back like an X-Men comic. And why do Violet's hair and clothes constantly change colors? It was never satisfactorily explained. <br /> <br />Don't expect too much more than gunplay and swords in ULTRAVIOLET - but expect to be wildly entertained with awful dialogue from the main antagonist (\\"It is on,\\" he declares at the climactic final battle of the movie, brandishing his sword).
0765315246|3.0|I was mightily impressed with the relatively literary treatment many sci-fi conventions receive in Scalzi's book.  It's a quick read and covers some interesting science and sociology/psychology territory.  The nicest thing is that a lot of seemingly random circumstances and events wrap back up with no glaring loose ends and an ending that's more \\"Local Hero\\" than Walt Disney.  Definitely worth a read for people who enjoy Heinlein.

B000002JQ6|1.0|I'm the kind of person who loves going to live concerts (I've seen B.B. King, The Temptations Review w/ the Spinners and James Brown, and had a blast each time), and had I have been alive during the Bon Scott era, I would've sprung to see AC/DC live. However, live albums are hard for me to recommend. Sure, there are a handful of greats (The Stones' Get Yer Ya-Ya's Out!, the Allmans at Fillmore East, B.B. King at the Regal, Live! by Bob Marley & the Wailers, Bob Dylan at the Royal Albert Hall), for the most part you get note-for-note renditions of the group's hits. This record is no different. They spend the entire concert either making good songs bad (Thunderstruck, Back In Black, Highway to Hell - can you imagine this without Bon Scott?) or bad songs worse (Heatseeker, Who Made Who, The Jack). And stay even further away from the two-discs collector's edition, which contians endless, jammed out versions of Jailbreak, High Voltage and Let There Be Rock that say absolutely nothing, even though each one is extended to over ten minutes. The Bon Scott studio albums and Back In Black are all essentials, but if you must an AC/DC live album, go with If You Want Blood, which was merely forgettable instead of bad.
0670034711|5.0|There is nothing I like better than to find a book that is so interesting that I don't want to put it down. Eat, Pray, Love was funny, well written and thought provoking. Elizabeth Gilbert has broadened my horizons by writing about places and experiences that most of us will never have. Her search for inner peace and balance takes her to Italy, India and Indonesia and she describes each experience with beautiful prose and great humor. This book will expose you to a variety of perspectives about life, love and religion...I am a better person for having read it.

B000F1IQNM|4.0|The flustered and poor undertaker Mr. Brown (Colin Firth) is having a terrible time with his children. Unruly and precocious, the Brown brats have invaded the kitchen, tie up Mrs. Blatherwick -- the family's russet-colored cook (Imelda Staunton) and have exhausted both the resources and the patience of the local nanny agency.  <br /> <br />After their 17th governess flees the premises in hysterics, Mr. Brown at the agency's door, but is denied admittance. Luckily, he hears the voice of Nanny McPhee (Emma Thomson) who abruptly and unceremoniously arrives on his doorstep just in time to rescue the cook and the kitchen from being destroyed.  The Nanny is a foreboding presence indeed, calm, cool and collected, she quietly tells the children to clean up the kitchen and go to bed.   <br /> <br />She is indeed a shocking sight, dressed in black, Her eyes are beady and black, her nose a bulbous monstrosity, and from her upper lip a single snaggletooth descends in the direction of her two frighteningly whiskered warts. There is nothing about her that could be described as warm or fuzzy, and her manner sets the children on edge: We will never want you,'' says the oldest boy Simon (Thomas Sangster), the oldest boy and also the most incorrigible. \\"Then I will never go,'' she replies.  <br /> <br />Her arrival is an absolute godsend for Mr. Brown, as he needs to get the children in order so that he can attract a wife. His evil parrot-nosed, semi-blind aristocrat Aunt Adelaide (a fabulous Angela Lansbury) has threatened to withdraw the stipend that keeps the family together, unless he can find a bride control his children.   <br /> <br />In the meantime, the lovely Evangeline, the Brown's scullery maid (Kelly Macdonald) watches over the family and seems more like Mr. Brown's type than the wicked and tacky Mrs. Quickly (Celia Imrie) who seems more concerned with obtaining the family's inheritance than being a mother to the children.  <br /> <br />Nanny McPhee is a real delight andhighlights some fine British talent. Colin Firth is very good as the harried and ineffectual father who turns to his late wife's empty chair to consult with her on a mounting list of family-threatening problems. But most extraordinary of all is the wonderful Emma Thompson, who gives a performance that is without vanity and without flaw. She never allows Nanny McPhee to become cute and overly nice and she never sells out the children's wishes.  <br /> <br />The film has a real Dickensian feel to it, complete with gaudy and vibrant colours and it tumbles along at the speed of a cartoon, with everything over-accentuated and all so very British. The dialogue is also wonderfully droll, as when Aunt Adelaide huffs, \\"If there's one thing I won't stand for, is loose vowels!\\" Fairy tale or not, the film is a real charmer and great fun for adults and kids alike!

B000002I4S|5.0|Seriously, even the weakest song (Countdown) is still better than any good Kenny G song (all zero of them!) But every song here is brilliantly brilliant. The title song is a jazz classic, and even then it's not the best song here (I'd go with the haunting, melodic Naima, a tribute to Trane's then-wife). Of course, I'm also a fan of the bluesy Cousin Mary. But the slightly less famous Syeeda's Song Flute and Mr. PC (Paul Chambers, not Politically Correct or Personal Computer - this was decades before computers, after all), both sporting excellent melodies and great soloing from Trane, not to mention Tommy Flanagan's brilliant-as-always work behind the ivory keys. Literally the only complaint I can make about Giant Steps is that it isn't as good as A Love Supreme, but finding an album that's in the same league as A Love Supreme is literally impossible. And please, buy Trane instead of Kenny G, since Kenny's pure product while Trane's pure genius.
B000FS9FCQ|1.0|Not since Heero have I seen such an overrated movie, just like that movie I am dumbfounded to talk to people who actually liked this movie.  And not just Liberals who have a blind admiration for this film due to its political message but some right wingers too.<br /><br />This film was over-acted, over dramatized and under written.  The story line is full of holes and where it is not full of holes it tries way too hard to make connections between the present and the events of the past, and the connections which all of our characters seem to have falls into that forced category.<br /><br />The dialogue is drawn out and tries to come across as artistic, many times I found myself zoning out long after the point was made in these pretentious conversations.<br /><br />The fight scenes are nothing revolutionary or exciting, its the same familiar fight scene you see in all \\"over-hollywooded\\" movies.<br /><br />This film also perpetuates the growing anti-Christian movement by using a red, modified cross as the Evil State's symbol.  On the surface this film tries to preach against hate with the over-played anti-gay thing, in reality it promotes more hatred, bigotry and fascism than Mien Kompf.  If there is any political future that this film alludes to it is one of a new wave of hatred against the majority of Americans.
B00008BXJG|5.0|I just love AC/DC.I really think that they are one of the best bands in the world both with Bon Scott and with Brian johnson.Each and every song is superb,so dont waste your time reading my review,buy this album today for your collection.Very highly recommended.Five stars.  PS:PLEASE IGNORE THE PREVIOUS ONE STAR REVIEWER AND HIS RECOMMENDATIONS.
B000ESST6U|5.0|Great recording of this work.<br /><br />Forget Sills recording! This was made before people really understood Handel and Opera Seria.<br /><br />Good new vision of the work. Would have been a little nicer with more countertenors, but heck! It does have the scrumptuous Danielle de Niese.<br /><br />If you're a de Niese fan, surely they must be growing? - then check out the Les Arts Florissants / William Christie DVD recording of Jean-Philippe Rameau's \\"Les Indes Galantes\\".
B00004SA8A|4.0|How can it be that the Schiff cycle is out of print? How does that concept even make sense in 2006?<br /><br />The one review on the late sonatas by Schiff holds some clues as to why they are so special.<br /><br />I know that years of listening produces version biases, but I really did try and look past that here, but the C minor 958 is so much less dramatic and compelling in this version. The Schiff version is very hypnotic. Kempff's tempos are totally different. It is interesting, during the runs, there is a tremendous sense of fluidity in Kempff's sound, but in the rest of the piece, it sounds too mechanical.  The same holds for some of the others, though in some of the pieces, for instance, 568, the results are less pronounced.<br /><br />Ironically, I usually like the less embellished versions of pieces, especially when a composer like Beethoven is involved and performers reinterpret him as a romantic, but in this case, the opposite is true. 958 in Schiff's version sounds like one of the towering achievements of solo piano. Here, the elements are all there, but the overall effect is lost.
B000EMGAOY|1.0|Yes they are from California, yes Californians like their home state.  Yes I am sick and tired about hearing about California and I would love for the Chili Peppers to release an album without a song about California because despite every Californian's beliefs most things that come from California arent very good.  Inlcuding this album.
B00006L7XQ|5.0|I'm not one to really be reviewing this, but here goes anyway.  This is heart felt stuff  from a guy on deaths door. I'm a metal fan, but this  brought tears too my eyes.    If you want music to reflect to and think about one's mortality, this is it. If Cash's other recordings are any where near this quality, count me in, they are top of my purchase list!!!   I recommend this to anyone wanting something above the usual everyday stuff.   Any  music lover, go buy this album NOW
B00007LTIB|5.0|not for the tame of heart.  on THE GATES OF DELIRIUM, a song that spans the entire first side on vinyl, there is more sound coming at you than you've ever heard in your life!  and, they could still play it live note for note (just to make the point that they could i think) years later with all the sonic force still intact.  this song builds in dissonance over several minutes - several minutes - to a climax then a very mellow ending section.  to me (and all my friends) it's the progressing dissonant passages that are the \\"experience\\".  once one catches on that this is something special you will spend more listenings getting to know it than any other piece you've loved.  i look back at it with warmth.  WARNING: on first listen the average person does not like this song!  they want to end it before even reaching the climax.  but, if you want to hear the most difficult parts any five rock musicians ever played together - and remember, all these sounds they can create without dubbing (ala, the live performances) - listen to this!  and good luck catching on. <br /> <br />oh, the other two songs (that were on the original) are good by any other standard but do pale in comparison.  with that said there are some very interesting solos! <br /> <br />finally, if you ever wanted to figure out what the hell they were playing, the extra tracks are gems and irreplaceable. <br />
B000BVD460|5.0|<br />Eminem is arguably the greatest lyricist of our time.  The English language seems to bend backwards for him, instead of the other way around.  Other then his lyrics, his voice and the power behind it are superb, and the songs are just plain GOOD.  He's created two perfect albums, and two other good ones-- now he has released Curtain Call, his greatest hits album. <br /> <br />As we all know, the job of a Greatest Hits album is not to create a CD of the fan's favorites; it is to assemble all of the hit SINGLES and arrange them on one CD, sprinkled with a few new and/or unreleased songs.  Curtain Call does just that.  The Intro is snazzy, and the three new songs all bring something new to the table-- Fack is silly, but catchy; Shake That is good song, but feels more like a Nate Dogg song then an Eminem one; and finally, When I'm Gone shows a retrospective Eminem, and I think it is one of his best tracks. <br /> <br />As for the arranging of the other hits, I approve for the most part.  I strongly feel that \\"Mockingbird\\" should not be on this album, as it fails to create the emotional impact as Hailie's Song, which was the more popular song with the radios and fans alike.  \\"Superman\\" should have been on here, as it is a single that the radio still plays to this day.  Finally, I think that the version of Guilty Conscience on this album should have been the Radio Version, because it contains that catchy chorus which the album version did not.  Other than those little flaws, all of the songs are well deserving of their place on this album of hits. <br /> <br />The bonus CD, \\"Stan's Mixtape,\\" has a great concept.  However, I think it would have worked better if it were made up of seven songs Eminem and a buddy were featured on, as opposed to a few of those and a few tracks from his previous album.  Including \\"Dead Wrong featuring The Notorious BIG\\", \\"$#!* on You featuring D-12,\\" and \\"Renegade featuring Jay-Z\\" were great choices.  However, I feel the other album tracks on this Bonus CD should have followed the same concept as the others.  Examples of the songs that could have been on this are \\"Forgot About Dre featuring Dr. Dre,\\" \\"Patiently Waiting featuring Fifty Cent,\\" and any of his songs with Royce Da 5'9\\".  Otherwise, good bonus CD. <br /> <br />9/10 <br />
B000FS9FCQ|1.0|Where do I start?  The story line tries too hard to create a web of intrigue, instead it weaves a web of forced tie-ins and the relationships between past characters and the present story line falls together far too easily. The fight scenes are badly rehearsed, they are few and far between and not exciting.  There are sometimes endless dialogues which are over acted and really drag the movie out an hour longer than has to be.  The end is anticlimactic with everything falling inot place way too easily.  Natalie Portman is good but her agent should be fired for letting her star in some of these pictures.
B000002NC4|4.0|Perfect From Now On was hard for me to get through at first, but after each listen I grew to love it, and it is now one of my favorite albums.<br /><br />I say to the person who just bought this album, or is even considering this album, to have patience.
0340838035|5.0|OMG. <br />this is my favourite book at the moment. <br />i chanced it at my neighbourhood library after i saw jodi picoult's works being featured in the straits times,the local press here. <br /> <br />i lurve the pact to bits ends. <br />this is really indeed such a love story. <br />two teenagers who grew up together,practically inseparable since they were children,and later fall in love.the story started off with a big bang (no pun intended).The girl dies,and the boy,Chris, who fainted from shock,is now being charged for homicide and alleged murder. <br /> <br />The story now procedes.Did Chris,a star athlete and schloar killed his girlfriend? And before you knew it,dark secrets starts to appear.The girl,Emily is found to be pregnant.Chris's mother and Emily's father began a passionate harmless affair,as they found their other halves being either nonchalent or grieving throughout the ordeal.More dark truths were suddenly revealed. <br /> <br />Its a good book.Seriously,there were all loads of twists and stuff that you couldn't expect.But i won't and i can't reveal it all.Except for another one,Emily was molested as a kid by a janitor and that she thought being in a relationship with her best friend and neighbour Chris was like committing incest.Did Chris shot Emily,or was it like what he said,theirs was a suicide pact? WAS EMILY suicidal all along? <br /> <br />Well well,coveting a neighbour's wife,teenage pregnancy,angst and sheer emotional torture,as well as an intense court trial,this is a really good book.I'm not surprised it a Hollywood adaptation of the book (heard there is one) will be a blockbuster.
B0002W18MU|5.0|No regrets in buying this final album ... everyone I know who listens to it is struck by his honesty and humility.
B0002W18MU|5.0|What power and feeling is in this album. You can hear how ill Johhny Cash was as he made this album, but the feeling is there in abundance. It has to be one of the best of the year.
B00005JOQS|2.0|Before I even start this review, let me say that I was greatly excited about a new Superman movie, mainly because I've never seen one on the big screen and rumors have been around for years. <br />And what can I say? You won't believe a man can fly.  <br />You won't even believe this man is indeed Superman. Why oh why do some many superhero flicks these days have to take itself so freaking serious? Some superhero characters do have the substance to carry a more dark, personal and down- to- earth movie because they were also intended to have some serious conflicts. <br />Bryan Singer and his criminally poor script however burden Superman with problems he was never intended to have.  <br /> <br />You take away the campyness, the fun, the somewhat emotional distance and the over- the- top characters from Superman, and you carry your film to the grave before it's even out. <br />This isn't Superman, it's some gal's boyfriend who left her for some time and is shocked to find out she doesn't dig him anymore. <br />You put Superman into the 21st century, and you lose another bit of atmosphere. Superman is the epitome of entertainment; you go to the movies to be entertained, not to watch other people having the same problems as you. If I want that, I'll just talk to friends or relatives. <br /> <br />All of this renders this film, in a word, pretentious. Even the dumbest audience member can see that Singer stuck Superman in a place he doesn't belong. <br />To bring this pretentiousness to a mindboggling climax, this movie even implies a philosophical subplot of Superman being Prometheus.  <br /> <br />Seriously, where's the adrenaline, where's the confrontation, where's the fun? And most important: where is the story hiding?  <br />It's all incoherent to the extreme. <br />The characters move from place to place without any motivation. <br />About the confrontation: what's the point in having Clark revisit Kansas and Martha when the character doesn't learn anything there (on a side note: why did Superman need a spaceship to get to Krypton? More important, where did he get it? And why did he have to go at all? Doesn't the 1978 movie make it pretty clear to Superman that Krypton is gone?)? <br />What's the point in having James Mardsen as Lois' Joe Everyday when there's no conflict between them? <br />And where's the actual threat for Superman? You would think that after zillions of rejected scripts, they could have come up with something more special than revamping the Methusalem-old \\"Luthor gets Kryptonite\\" scheme. Even the 1978 original used it as the B- or even C- storyline. <br />  <br />The essential difference between Lex Luthor's evil schemes 1978 and 2006 is that the original was tongue in cheek and therefor believable. By making that (essentially same) plan seriously threatening, the writers have rendered the whole movie breathtakingly cringe- worthy. <br />And to top it all off, Lex Luthor's storyline isn't even properly wrapped. This silly \\"morooned on an island without gasoline\\" is almost too stupid to be true. When Luthor takes off his wig at the end on \\"Superman\\", at least that was camp and truly humorous. But Supes doesn't even have a final confrontation with him. <br /> <br />Then the actors: do they have ANY fun? Clearly not. Brandon Routh is so shockingly stale as Superman, he isn't the charismatic, yet strong hero Christopher Reeve was. Now, one might say this is a new Superman; that point would be valid if this was actually a reboot, but it isn't. It's a sequel.  <br />But there's nothing in his character, or any other, that indicates that this is the Superman from 1978.  <br /> <br />And while watching the film, it seems like Singer didn't know whether he was doing a sequel or a reboot. I believe there are more lines and nods to the first movie than there's original stuff. Couldn't he at least get his continuity right? <br />The audience isn't even given a chance to get familiar with the characters again, simply because their age is wrong. I understand that producers want young, attractive actors for their films, but in this case it means compromising the believability of the storyline. The characters are supposed to be older. Alright, you don't want to do this, at least pick someone who is at the same age, but not 10 years YOUNGER for heaven's sake! Or are we supposed to believe that Superman accidently made earth rotate slower at the end of the original? <br />But the main problem is the peformance. Good god, give at least ONE smile, Routh! <br />Kate Bosworth is in absolutely NO way the character Margot Kidder was, but instead a mother who has to balance job, kid and (pretentious) family turmoils (hooray for another boring and stereotypical modernisation!). <br />Kevin Spacey's Luthor also has not one tiny little shred of his 1978 alter ego. He tries to be serious, but he isn't. He tries to be witty, but he isn't. He tried to deliver one- liners, but he fails. It's all the worse because the movie isn't conscious of its cheesyness, unlike Fantastic Four for instance. Something similar ruinous I have indeed only seen in the Star Wars prequels. <br /> <br />And of course the movie is full of CGI. And I don't mean this in the \\"action scenes full of CGI\\" sense; actually, the lack of real action is pretty refreshing (which would be good, but the acting and no plot makes this action- free time just boring). <br />I mean that CGI is used because it's easier than building and lighting sets/ models. But it doesn't look better. On the contrary, it gives the film a sterile look and feeling that is so typical for this kind of movie nowadays. <br />I've rewatched the original film last night, and the scene in which bullets hit Superman looks so much better than that awful Matrix- like scene in Returns (you know, when in a moment of sheer badness a bullet hits Supes' eye). <br /> <br />This is hardly unusual for today's \\"Blockbusters\\", but it's always worth mentioning. <br /> <br />In short, I have never seen a superhero film that resembles its origins less.
B00005JMYI|5.0|first off let me say to all these basics out here; NOONE cares that you didnt like this movie but yet still need to explain that you love will farrell, as far as im concerned, anyone who watched this movie and did not think it was one of farrells best movies just doesnt completely understand comedy, I give this move a  5.  and two thumbs way up!
068484267X|5.0|Loved it! I read it while still in high school and I was moved by this story. Being of Irish ancestory myself, I felt like a piece of my own families history was intertwined within this book. Wonderful and thought provoking. I believe that I shed a tear while reading this. Recommend it to anyone trying to capture the essance of what it means to be an immigrant.
0740748475|5.0|I never bought any Calvin & Hobbes book before, so when I got interested in them, I decided to buy this massive collection. It really is heavy; carrying it will be sport, believe me. But it's worth it. The classiness of the thing is just grand: 3 volumes in a slipcase, there even were a thin sheet of paper to protect from friction and else. This may not be very important but I do enjoy the pickiness of all this. <br /> <br />Now as to the cartoons themselves, well I do love Calvin & Hobbes. It's the smartest cartoon I ever read (just know I am not a cartoon specialist at all) and it is so profoundly humane and witty and clever and... and... and a lot of other things. I can't say enough about this article. The introduction, or preface, by Bill Watterson is quite good; and very interesting.  <br /> <br />This is a must for anyone who enjoys good cartoons. Definitely worth its price.
B000050IL0|5.0|I bought this DVD new on ebay--one seller has it almost always listed--for only $39.95 brand new. The DVD is pure amazement. I've watched it over and over and over. You'll see the best Bach student ever molding the masters work. Don't pay crazy prices here...keep looking on ebay unless the prices come down here.
B000FVBLEI|5.0|It is as much of a progression from TDH as TDH was from BSS.  It is heavier, faster, AND more melodic (even with acoustic guitars at points).  If they keep them coming like this, I will keep buying. <br /> <br />IMO, a must buy.
B00005K3NR|4.0|Brian De Palma's Carrie is a pretty good horror movie.  Based on Stephen King's novel, the movie centers on a young, outcast teenager (Sissy Spacek) trying to fit in among her high school classmates, which is difficult given her extremely religious mother (Piper Laurie). <br /> <br />The movie is full of great images--I'm pretty sure you know how the story is going to end.  But the real treat is how engaging the story is.  I think a lot of this is due to Sissy Spacek's performance (which was nominated for an Oscar). She makes Carrie sympathetic, honest, and goodhearted (in the book, she was sometimes hard to relate to due to her hidden cruel nature). <br /> <br />The DVD includes several special features--the best is the documentaries that focus on how the film was made and the great cast was assembled (including John Travolta, Nancy Allen, and Amy Irving).  It's interesting to know that De Palma staged his screen tests with another director who was casting another movie (the director was George Lucas, and the movie was Star Wars).  The weirdest special feature is the pointless discussion of the short-lived, hated broadway musical that was based on the movie.
B00005RYLE|5.0|The Independent Film Channel has been showing a few classic horror films here lately. A week or two ago, it was the first and third \\"Texas Chainsaw Massacre\\" films, and now this 1983 classic from Sam Raimi. I hope the second film is on the way!. This was my first real viewing of the film that I remember. I saw it in bits and pieces some years back, dug it, but didn't remember much of the film as a whole. Boy, I've been missing out!. The movie is unabashedly filled with splattering guts and grue, and any horror fan will relish in the film's over the top gore. Is this the same guy that did \\"Spider-Man\\"?. The always great Bruce Campbell heads up the small cast as Ash(Ashley), who goes along on a little outing in the woods with three other friends. Only one gets out alive. They come to a creepy old cabin, and things pretty much go downhill from there. They find odd things including a book made of human skin and a recording from a previous tenant. Before you know it, our little group has resurrected an ancient evil, and they won't be getting out alive. Soon, the demonic forces start to take over the gang, until Ash can put a bloody and gory stop to it. Raimi sets the right tone and delivers his chills and thrills in a nice, organic fashion. Looking back on these older films, one appreciates them more when comparing them to modern ones with fancy effects and CGI. Raimi doesn't skimp on the awesomeness of the idea, and let's it all rip in bloody good fun. The only thing that was skimpy in the film were the characters. With the exception of Ash, The three other friends were mainly decoration to be taken down in the most awful of ways. The setting itself was wonderful, and brilliantly shot by Raimi. Let's face it, the woods are scary. The woods at night are downright terrifying. Raimi uses wonderful skill to make the most of the wooded areas and making them not only sinister, but making them feel as if they were really alive. Some of the make-up and gore effects get chintzyhere and there, but most of the time they are a gorehounds delight. What can you expect here?. Impalements, dismemberment, chainsaws, shovels, and so on. It remains to be seen if Raimi will ever return to his low budget horror film ways. It would be too bad if he didn't because he was one of the masters.
B000002BBY|5.0|Great cd that you can listen to hundreds of times and never use the skip button. All the songs are accesible and catchy from the first listen, there is no \\"letting it grow on you\\" on this album. From the first song \\"Hello\\" to the majestic masterpiece that is \\"Champagne Supernova\\" it's one big fun rollercoaster ride of british (pop)rock.
0800141660|5.0|This film looks beautiful with that particular fresh and green loveliness that typifies the gentlefolk's 18th / 19th century England. It's a delight to watch, and the screenplay itself is wonderfully done, combining the sensible and likeable characters with the truly absurd characters, not to mention those whose characters are morally enfeebled. Jane Austen's depiction of human frailty as well as goodness has always impressed me as being true and very apt, striking home not merely with insightful viewing of human beings but also the very particular aspects that define a person of English gentility in the 1800s.<br /><br />Emma Thompson has certainly done a splendid job with the screenplay. Unlike the recent unfortunate adaptation of \\"Pride and Prejudice\\", this adaptation includes virtually all of the essential story threads, and gives appropriate screentime to all the characters. One becomes thoroughly engrossed not only in the travails of the two Dashwood sisters, but also all of those they encounter.<br /><br />Kate Winslet is simply perfect as Marianne Dashwood, the sister with all the sensibility. She embodies every aspect of the character - her winsomeness, her charm, her gaiety, the immoderate way in which she throws herself into life, and her lack of prudence. In appearance and behaviour, no better Marianne could have been found.<br /><br />Alan Rickman as Colonel Brandon, the somewhat shy but intelligent gentleman of excellent morals and strong feelings, whose qualities Marianne learns to appreciate after the tumultuous miseries of her relationship with Willoughby, is excellent - which is no surprise. Is there a role in the world that Alan Rickman cannot play, and play more convincingly than anyone else?<br /><br />Greg Wise as the unreliable Willoughby, whose dashing good looks and romantic persona gain Marianne's love but who ultimately proves to be a man of straw whose self-interest will always lead him to disappoint the hopes of others in pursuit of his own gain, is wonderfully cast.<br /><br />The scheming Lucy Steele is played with extraordinary deftness by the excellent Imogen Stubbs, who portrays not only the machinating and self-serving aspects, but also the encroaching sweetness that deceives so many.<br /><br />Every part, in fact, with the exception of two, is superbly cast.<br /><br />I do consider the film has two flaws - the casting of Emma Thompson as Elinor, and far worse, the casting of Hugh Grant as Edward. Emma Thompson is a wonderful actress, but I find it impossible to think of her as Elinor, both on account of her being visibly too much older than the nineteen of Miss Dashwood in the novel, and also in her portrayal somehow seeming rather too ruefully pragmatic. I suppose I have always envisaged Elinor as being a different type - sensible, calm, yes, but not visibly self-dampening, and of course younger. Hugh Grant as Edward seems to me to have been the film's only major mistake. One does not sense from the novel that Edward is supposed to be a completely inarticulate gentleman, stiff-necked, addicted to such high cravats that he appears to be choking, and with scarcely any qualities that would lead one to suppose him the type likely to attract Elinor. I have always thought of him more as a calm and sensible young man with deep feeling, whose reluctance to communicate with Elinor after he realised he was falling in love with her was due ONLY to his knowledge of his existing entanglement with Miss Steele - not to a reticence and inarticulation that are embedded in his character.<br /><br />I overcame my qualms with regard to the casting of Elinor - after all, Emma Thompson is never less than charming, and she is a wonderful actress indeed. But Hugh Grant as Edward strikes me EVERY time I watch this DVD as... simply wrong.<br /><br />Yet in spite of these things, the film works beautifully in almost every way for me. I'd prefer to give the film 4 and a half stars rather than five, but without thatoption, let it be five.<br /><br />Abandon the few qualms and enjoy the delicious beauties and witty understanding of human nature in this delightful period piece.s beauties and witty understanding of human nature in this delightful period piece.
B000002H97|5.0|I love it. \\"Enter Sandman\\" might be overplayed and hyped but it's still friggin great, and so is the stuff that follows. \\"Sad But True\\", \\"Unforgiven\\", \\"Don't tread on me\\", \\"Of wolf and man\\" and \\"The struggle within\\" being the album highlights.
B00003CX95|5.0|This and \\"The Patriot\\" are my two favorite movies. This move is based on some fact and takes place in Scottland where they were fighting the British hundred of years ago. A very dramatic and violent move. If you have a weak stomach for the reality of the violence of war this move is not for you. If you like good drama, good war films and history, then this is a great movie!
B000003TAR|5.0|Kurt really shows his songwriting talent on this one. It has a Darker tone than Nevermind but is more emotional and beautiful at the same time.
B000059Z8J|5.0|The older Superman is better then the new 2006 Superman, better actors and on a more personal relationship between Superman and Louis Lane, and has the spirit of the fun of the comic strip. The new movie actor's don't show any emotion together, just act and read their lines. The old Superman is funny and true to the comic book. The only saveing grace to the new movie are the special effects. Superman the Movie is a \\"Classic\\".
B0000035E7|4.0|This might not be on par with Nevermind or In Utero but it's still a mighty good album. Blew, About a girl, School, Negative Creep, Scoff and Swap meet being the highlights.
B00000K3CR|3.0|The movie \\"Big\\", starring Tom Hanks, is about a 13 year old boy named Josh, that wants to grow up too quickly. One night, at the carnival with his family, after being totally humiliated in front of his crush, he finds this wish machine and grants him one wish. He wishes to become `big'. The next day, he wakes up to find himself to be an adult. When his mother sees him, he is chased out of the house not knowing what to do next. He and his best friend find some money and they travel to New York. There he finds a job in the toy making industry. There he meets a woman named Susan. She finds his childish behavior kind of weird in the beginning but later on gets use to it. He soon realizes, with the help of his best friend, that he is only a 13 year old and helps him find the wish machine to get him back to normal. Josh has to make the decision between staying a 30 year old with Susan or going back to being a little kid. Overall this movie was pretty good. My favorite part was when the main character, Josh, is playing in the toy store on the large piano.
B000002AS3|5.0|This never fails me if I'm down in the dumps, a great mood raiser. Some of the greatest songs of the 90's have a home on this record. Definitely one of the greatest albums of the 90's.
B00000K3D4|4.0|In many ways Labyrinth could be considered the finale of the two part Jim Henson Masterpiece Epic which began with the visually stunning The Dark Crystal.  While Crystal could easily be taken as Henson's answer to the then popular Star Wars, Labyrinth is all over his answer to the 80's - and who better to serve as ring master then David Bowie?   <br /> <br />A sort of grown up fairy tale Labyrinth is about a girl who, faced with the inevitable truth that she must one day soon leave the comfort of her fantasy world of games and make believe, must travel into the real life realm of magic and  fantasy to save her young brother from the Goblin King Jareth, and it is here that all the things she picked up playing dress up and reading Tolkein work to her advantage.  On the surface, Labyrinth is fun self indulgence on Bowie's part, as he's the only character who really gets to sing his synth heavy, sweeping score, but, as many Laby - Heads have already said, the film has a deeper message about growing up, not just how fun it is to watch Bowie prance around in tight leather riding pants. <br /> <br />The puppetry is fantastic, but then this is Jim Henson we're talking about.  However, visually, the film lacks the depth and scope that the dark crystal brought.  Having seen the film only 3 times - once in the 80's, twice in the present - I found myself upon that second view a little dissapointed.  Certain scenes (Especially Magic Dance) which I remember brimming with puppets and on huge sets, are on a much smaller scale then I recalled - but that's a minor complaint I guess - Irrelevant even, because even if it lacks that kick in the balls scal eand scope of other Henson productions, it isn't a particularly bad thing. <br /> <br />My only real complaint is the shortage of famous Muppet performers - Seriously Jimmy, would it have killed you and Frank to voice a few characters yourself? <br /> <br />As an added bonus though, you get Kevin Clash in an early muppet appearance voicing a \\"Fiery\\" in the \\"Chilly Down\\" song.  He does his Elmo voice, which made me laugh :) <br /> <br />Over all a good movie, and one that a lot of people grew up on.
0517223546|5.0|Impressive work. If you like context and perspective combined with captivating story based on actual history facts/events, this one is one of the best. Yes, at times the stories and personalities are bit underdeveloped, or the writting here and there is lacking artistic depth, but considering the main purpose and scope, these are minor issues. The real pleasure for me was, that considering the lenght of the book timeline, author devoted significant part to the Salisbury cathedral construction. It seems that we share the same passion :). Oh, and, its better to buy a hardcover, this book deserves it and also - asuming its proportions - its more pleasant to handle. Strongly recommended, kind regards, Mario.
B000002B35|5.0|the cd i had been looking for was not in music stores at the mall, so i checked out amazon for the first time and there it was. this is my favorite pink floyd cd. and i had to have it again. I gave my first one years ago to a good freind leaving for a new carreer in Texas. so i had to get this cd back. My teenage kids love pink floyd know. Thanks to Amazon I have it back.
B00008HCCF|5.0|Yes, Norah seems to be bit nervous and not too confident...but it is not distracting or unpleasant. It is just her, and her live performance, not actress in a movie blockbuster. And since it is music (and singing) that matters - this DVD deserves 5 stars. Kind regards, Mario.
B000A7Q2DM|1.0|Wow what a pathetic excuse for music. Far from good music. I just happen to see them live at an Audioslave concert before Seether. How embarrassing it was for them..they were worse than awful. Regardless, Seether and Audioslave both put an amazing show on that night! Don't waste your money on this...go get a Seether or Audioslave cd instead.
B000BEZQ0Y|4.0|The music evokes the mood of the film and period well, and is enjoyable on its own.
B00013RC8O|4.0|This movie is one looong car chase. Starting just a few minutes from the opening credits, until he hits that ,\\"Vanishing Point\\", this man & his muscle car just won't stop. The police are gathering lots of men & firepower to end his joyride, and a lot of regular folks want to see him keep going. Sort of a ,\\"Stick it to the Man\\", cheering section on the sidelines. And this car has the horsepower to stick with it. In 1971 a V8 engine had lots of guts, and gas had lead for lots of octane. On this trip, Barry Newman burns plenty of it. Sure, there are other people in this movie, but I'll always think of a souped up Dodge Challenger as the star of this road trip.
B00005MP58|5.0|The DVD itself, as another reviewer mentioned, doesn't have the greatest sound.  I had to crank up the volume to the highest, so that would rate lower.  But the movie itself is unbelievably good and ranks more than five stars. <br /> <br />The side characters are terrific.  Mr. Collins is hilariously servile, and Mrs. Bennet may be over the top but she's entertaining to watch.  Wickham may not be the most handsome, but the actor makes him so charming that Wickham's appeal is entirely believable (despite knowing from the book he's slime).  Mr. Bennet is exactly as Austen described--reserved, but with \\"sarcastic humour\\".  Miss Bingley is at her catty best.  Jane is wonderful--her own person, so different from Elizabeth but terrific in her own way.  She may not be the most gorgeous, as Jane was written, but the actress does brilliantly portraying Jane's sweet, good nature without making her saccharine. <br /> <br />Lizzy and Charlotte's relationship is a bit underdeveloped--Lizzy saw her as a great confidante before her acceptance of Collins' proposal, and that doesn't quite come out.  (It's understandable, though, since Collins' proposal is fairly early in the story.)  Elizabeth and Jane's relationship is spectacular--they are friends as well as family.  Elizabeth and her father's relationship is a wonderful one, too, and it is quite easy to see how Elizabeth is her father's favorite. <br /> <br />The miniseries does well in showing how both the Jane-Bingley marriage and the Elizabeth-Darcy marriages are successful however different they are--each marriage is a match of similar personalities.  Bingley looks so cutely disappointed in the scene where his sisters and Darcy are convincing him that Jane is not in love with him (with Darcy's voiceover in the letter). <br /> <br />Darcy and Elizabeth are spectacular.  Firth does Darcy's proud haughtiness across without being entirely hateful, and he plays flustered well, too.  Elizabeth is truly the gentleman's daughter--sheis proper and refined while being quick and clever within those social lines.  Ehle owns the language, and when it comes out of her mouth, it's like she's always spoken that way.  They smolder when they're onscreen--the restraint only cranks up the heat, when all they're doing is looking at each other occasionally.   <br /> <br />Normally something this long could drag at the beginning, but this one doesn't, and it only picks up speed towards the end.  It doesn't feel long at all.  Quite a tribute to the novel.
B000059HB7|5.0|Rio Bravo is one of my favorite John Wayne movies. It has plenty of action, along with well placed doses of humor. This is a film that my whole family enjoys watching together.
B000E1ZBGS|3.0|This version has its merits.  The scenery is terrific, and the one scene in the morning mist with the sun rising is incomparably beautiful.  Mary and Anne de Bourgh are treated more sympathetically than in the BBC miniseries' version, and Jane and Wickham are very good-looking (as they're written in the novel).  Judi Dench as Lady Catherine is good. <br /> <br />The two-hour time frame makes it difficult to develop the story very much, so basically everything that isn't Lizzy-Darcy is truncated (Lizzy-Jane, Lizzy-Mr. Bennet relationship, even Lydia and Wickham is shortened).  Some of the period stuff (another reviewer mentioned the bedroom visits, and the costuming) is a little off.  But these aren't major problems, at least for me. <br /> <br />My main issue with it is that it feels like a twenty-first century version of the story.  It is more angsty, and it takes a very modern young person view of Lizzy and Darcy--that is, it has them behave emotionally more like us moderns would at their ages rather than the Lizzy and Darcy of the novel and of two centuries ago.  It's got a twinge of the WB teenage drama in it. <br /> <br /> <br />The cleverness and the wit of Austen's work are minimal here, and it feels more somber.  Mr. Bennet's \\"sarcastic humor\\" is gone; his lines are delivered seriously.  Mr. Collins' servility and Mrs. Bennet's nerves and silliness are much toned down from their BBC versions, making the characters more personable, but it feels just a little less.  (Less amusing, for sure.) <br /> <br />I had trouble caring for this movie's Lizzy and Darcy.  Austen's Elizabeth had an easy playfulness and a quickness about her.  This Elizabeth has lost most of her witty humor (albeit fitting of the more serious tone of the movie) and thus comes across a little shrill, without the lively charm to cover for her more \\"insolent\\" moments.  <br /> <br />She is emotional and flighty, swinging from smiling and giggly to crying hard, to yelling (raising her voice) at Darcy during the first proposal--which seems a little weird for the restrained manners of that time period.  This Elizabeth feels more like a modern, fiery teenager than the proper, confident but lively novel heroine. <br /> <br />Darcy, here, instead of being proud, just comes across as sad.  He has sad puppy dog eyes the entire movie.  To me, it makes Lizzy's rejection seem a lot harsher.  Even the end scene (for American audiences?) didn't make me like them any more--it just felt hokey instead. <br /> <br />The novel has Lizzy and Darcy as equals in intellect and in faults--Lizzy to drop her prejudice and Darcy to learn to change his pride.  In this movie version, Lizzy just comes around to where Darcy is; he doesn't change. <br /> <br />As a movie taken by itself, not bad, and a fast way to acquaint onself with the basic storyline.  To see a much truer version of the novel, though, watch the 1995/1996 BBC/A&E miniseries with Ehle and Firth.
0767847431|5.0|Golden Voyage of Sinbad places second in a trio of master FX pioneer Ray Harryhausen movies starring Sinbad - the dashing Arabian folk hero whose exploits involved sailing the seas in search of adventure.  Throughout this well produced fantasy, whose low budget can't be felt anywhere, Harryhausen's creatures fly, dance and gallop to life with a smooth fantastical grace which showcases some of his very best work.  However, the highlight of the film has to be Kali, the six-armed sword wielding statue Goddess.<br /><br />Harryhausen's final creation is a true wonder to behold.  With a mysterious, inscrutable visage that would make Mona Lisa proud framed by an impressive headdress which adds to the height and impact, this Kali looks authentic to it's cultural roots, while slickly imparting the dramatic heft and fantastical aura necessary to forge an unforgettable cinematic presence.  Harryhausen's attention to detail is legendary and everything from the decorative designs on the headdress to the creepy skull belt to her six bracelets boasts detailing.  Finally, Kali controlled by the movie's villain starts to dance.  As a startled primitive tribe looks on, their enormous effigy starts to move - slowly at first - spookily creaking all the while.  What follows is some of the most surreal and wildly hypnotic movements ever seen on film, set to traditional Hindu music which is both lively, mysterious and infectious in encouraging dance.  Harryhausen hired one of the most popular Indian music composers at that time to create the dance music and it adds much to the scene.  The dance moves are classical and their subtlety in achieving just the right feel is tremendously realized.<br /><br />Kali's bobbing head movements alone are worth the time to view the scene - which only clocks in at about 2 minutes 10 seconds.  Harryhausen's incomparable touch which bestows upon the puppet truly lifelike movements along with that non-committal facial expression achieve a singularly brilliant illusion of life.  We know it's only optical illusion, but then the entire concept behind film is one big optical illusion, however the Kali dance sequence due in large part to Harryhausen's brilliant facial sculpt, design and exacting dance execution excites one on a level few others approach.<br /><br />Inevitably, the creatures of Harryhausen, as in any action fantasy film, must fight.  And this is noteworthy to emphasize; Harryhausen always called his creations exactly that - creatures - not monsters or demons or things - they're creatures who may be from another world, or sent by the Gods or in this case courtesy of a magician's mystical potion.  Harryhausen left the moralizing up to the audience, while he focused on their actions.  Here of course Kali fights Sinbad and his sailors.  Alhough it's one mystical creature against a group, Sinbad's men may indeed be outnumbered, for Kali has six limbs and wields a deadly sword skillfully with each one.<br /><br />Kali isn't the last of the fantastic creatures for Sinbad and crew to deal with, she's just arguably the coolest.  This film showcases fantastic stop motion magic while providing a fun romp for the whole family.  The DVD contains great extras including a wonderful documentary on Harryhausen narrated by Leonard Nimoy of Star Trek fame.<br /><br />Today digital FX realized through computers can achieve much more complexity than Ray Harryhausen could alone in his small work shop.  However there's something to be said about the artistry of producing something yourself, by hand and with a unique vision and in terms of that, the stop motion work here is some of the most artistic you'll ever see.

B00004RF97|5.0|Excellent movie for all movie lovers.  Good, old fashion fun with the best possible cast.  Worth watching a lot more than once!
B000E6FSPW|4.0|Advertised as a remastered re-release, longtime fans of the original release of this soundtrack may be unpleasantly surprised to learn that most of the songs appear to have been somewhat remixed as well.  While the remastered sound quality is excellent, giving many of the songs, especially the Vince Di Cola instrumentals, a fuller and richer sound, almost every song appears to have been altered from its original form in some way.  While some of the changes are rather subtle, a few songs are noticeably different.  \\"The Sweetest Victory\\" is vastly inferior to that of the original release, something I found particularly disappointing given that the song was always one of my favorites from this album. <br /> <br />Still one of the better soundtracks of the 80's, but if you're looking for the original soundtrack, this version may not be what you want.  Also, unless you're a collector, I wouldn't recommend buying it just to have the added Survivor song.  It's a ballad that was probably cut from the film for good reason. <br /> <br />This album still earns 4 stars for it's sentimental and inspirational value, but that's one less star than I'd give to my old, worn out cassette.
B000002JQ6|2.0|There are good and bad things about this album.<br /><br />I'll start out with the good things.  AC/DC has proven that they can put on a good live show, and some of the songs on here are almost as good as the studio versions.<br /><br />However, concerts are more fun to go to than they are to listen to in your room, something that is very obvious here.  This would have been a fun concert to go to, but listening to it can get boring.  Brian Johnson's voice is not very good live, and it distracts you from the music in the background.<br /><br />The live versions of their songs butcher the original songs, like Back in Black, Highway to Hell, and most of the good songs.  However, TNT and Whole Lot of Rosie sound pretty good live, even though Bon Scott isn't singing them.<br /><br />This is very passable.  I only recommend this to AC/DC completists.<br /><br />If you like AC/DC, get Highway to Hell, Back in Black, High Voltage, Let There Be Rock, and the other Bon Scott albums.  Most of the Brian Johnson era is passable, with the exception of Back In Black.
B0000C7PQK|4.0|I liked Enigma becoause their sound was different from the mainstream. In this album they step away form the more ambient relaxing sound of their past works. They venture into more of an upbeat sound yet it is still relaxing and refreshing to here, and in keeping with their past works they still manage to be different. I have been a fan of electronica music and trust DJ Tiesto, 4 Strings, Ian Van Dahl, and their likes can't touch this stuff though ATB kind of comes close, but not quite. It is something truely unique as Enigma has always been. <br /> <br />What keeps me form giivng this 4 out 5 stars are the first three songs on the album, they are in a word terrible. But from track 4 onwards you won't stop playing this album. <br /> <br />(4) \\"Page of Cups\\" is very relaxing trancy song <br />(5) \\"Boum Boum\\" is an energetic upbeat dance song, boum means party in French- nice use of semantics there (Enigma always the innovators) <br />(6) \\"total Eclipse of the Moon\\" is one of those less then a minute to 2  minute songs that Enigma are famous for putting on their alubms. <br />(7) \\"Look of Today\\" is an upbeat catchy song that falls short of dance floor material <br />(8) \\"In the Shadows, In the Light\\" is an overall good song <br />(9) \\"Weightless\\" and (10) \\"The Piano\\" we see a return to the relaxing trancy sound evoked in (4) \\"Page of Cups\\" <br />(11) \\"Follwing the Sun\\" is an awesome song and as closing out the album it somewhat incorporates the sounds you have been hearing throughout the album fomr the relaxing trance to the upbeat energy.
B000002VCU|5.0|The duo of Eric Woolfson and Alan Parsons, better known as The Alan Parsons Project, produced ten studio albums from 1976 through 1987.  The pair always had a theme with each album, crafting each song to comform to the subject matter.  \\"The Turn of a Friendly Card,\\" produced in 1980, contains their most easily accessible theme - the addiction to gambling.  The album spawned two hits:  \\"Games People Play,\\" a fast rocker and the ballad, \\"Time.\\"<br /><br />My dad exposed me to this album in the early 1980's and it is by far my favorite (I own all of their albums but two).  It is replete with amazing orchestration, masterfully arranged by Andrew Powell, a long-time friend of Alan Parsons.  The melodies are the the most addicting, the title track being my favorite tune.  Lyrically, the album is extremely poetic, with similies and analogies strung throughout.  Of course, no Alan Parsons album would be complete without an instrumental.  This one contains two, my favorite being \\"The Gold Bug.\\"  It's a piece, like Pachebel's canon, that builds on a bassline (better known as a passacaglia) for each verse, culminating in an awesome sax solo.  The other instrumental, entitled \\"Ace of Swords,\\" is really an orchestral piece, utilizing mixed meter and a cool harpsichord part.<br /><br />As a public-school music teacher, I have often used this album as a listening example for my band and choir classes.  Roughly 70% of the kids like the album (even though it is 20+ years old) because it speaks to any age level, both musically and thematically.  I believe any \\"Projectologist\\" will agree - this album is the best place to start!  Enjoy!
B0000DIJO2|5.0|This live event captures at the MGM is absolutely flawless. The sound and picture is the best that one could expect. Although I skipped through the disco numbers, there was all a ton of top quality production left for me to enjoy. The introduction of the graceful \\"Celine Dione\\" who does an incredible job with this trio is a bonus to this piece of GENUINE GOLD. The crying vibrato voice that only Robin Gibb can claim fame to is exquisetly stunning in \\"Massachussets\\" and \\"I started a joke\\". The tribute to Andy is also comforting. This is a DVD that everyone should have regardless of taste. We, that have been alive during the last 20-50 years have witnessed the finest music that this planet has ever delivered. This DVD is a prime example. Buy it........you will not be sorry.
B000B8QEZG|1.0|Geez, how could anybody take Madonna serious? I don't, neither should you. This garbage is plastered over every \\"music\\" channel known to man. If her kids weren't such spoiled brats, i'd feel sorry for them. You're getting old Madonna, so is your act, and you're false religious lies. In fact, everything about you should have died long ago. I only give you credit for not dying yet. Nothing about her music is talented. End of story. There is hope though. Back in 1986, when she was around, making music just as bad. A little band called Slayer released the masterpiece \\"Reign in Blood\\" as a slap in the face to mainstream pop. Twenty years later, this Tuesday, Slayer is back to do it again. Christ Illusion will destroy this unworthy piece of trash.
B000E6UK5K|5.0|The best things in life are consistent and emulate a quality we can always come to expect.  This is also true of David Gilmour's latest CD 'On An Island'.  The music on this CD is both pleasant and mature.  Gilmour's guitar playing is at times very melodic, while at other times it's as hard as the best Pink Floyd cut, but always set to lyrics that convey class.  You won't hear anything whacko on this CD, such as Roger Water's screaming on 'The Pros and Cons of Hitch Hiking', instead, you will hear some very personal introspection about life and death and relationships set to beautiful music.  For some listeners, they may not be able to fully appreciate this CD until they've matured in their musical taste.  If I had to mention one thing about this CD, which I would change, it would have to be the tempo of the opening track.  Most people who are familiar with David Gilmour's music know that he plays guitar very well and \\"Castellorizon\\" stands out like a call to get to your seat.  I usually jump to the second track \\"On An Island\\" were it all flows to \\"Where We Start\\".
B000002UB3|5.0|Suffice it to say, this was the first album I ever bought as a 13 year old, and one of a handful of albums I've continued to own at every stage of my life since. I don't listen to it that often - the inevitable result of being more than familiar with the music. One reason I really enjoy this album is because George Harrison began to shine. I always enjoyed John Lennon, but in later years began to more appreciate the spirituality of George, and the warmth of his voice during these few years when he was at his height. <br /> <br />But all the songs shine on this album - I don't think there's a weak moment, though some of Paul's contributions do tempt with their pop sensibilities. You haven't lived till you've heard this album - the Beatles finest hour (and, I guess, their last).
B000002UB6|5.0|Arrived fast , perfect condition , I had this on a 33 record and it was old . Beatles let it be is one of my favorites from my younger days , Stll enjoy it > Thanks
6304779356|5.0|What a classic! \\"The Lost Boys\\" still rocks! Jason Patric, Corey Haim, and the Frog Brothers are always great fun for a saturday night, or any night. And best of all, unlike the horror movies of today, this movie's gore level is pretty minimal.
034544678X|1.0|I bought this book and was looking for some insight of what one can do to help with my dog's behavior due to trauma from her past owner and dog walking issues and social issues. This book was so boring to begin with.  The Other End of the Leash, this book didn't even go into any training techniques, Patricia Connell just was so into her own dogs, that I felt like I was reading a expose' on her dog's lives.  Did I gain any insight on remedies to help me along with my dog I rescued who has trauma and is an alpha female dog and can't walk on a leash or socialize with other dogs/people.  No, I ended up giving the book away before even finishing the last chapter.  Enough of Ms. McConnell's writings, my time was wasted and I could not use any of what I read in her book to my situation.   <br />I would not recommend this book for anyone's reading if it is to solve your dog's issues.
B00005N6KG|5.0|Love these headphones!!  I have been using them religiously when I run for the past 10+ years.  I typically run 6+ miles most days of the week, and one pair will generally last me 6 to 9 months.  For the price and quality, I don't mind replacing them that often.  The buds stay in my ear, the cord is the perfect length, they're lightweight, and the sound quality is amazing.  Highly recommend these to anyone who enjoys music with their high-impact, high-intensity workouts.
B0007TKNL0|5.0|The camera role was especially excellent.  One would think the viewer was  in the Theater.  I saw the movie some  years ago, but this version was even more realistic
B0002W18MU|5.0|The last album from Johnny Cash is an absolute masterpiece with brilliant songs that truly convey a deep message. <br /> <br />From the first strokes on the guitar strings on \\"Help Me\\" till the last one on \\"Free From The Chain Gang Now\\" you get to hear Johnny perform songs with soul and authenticity. Important themes are life, death, love, journey through life. The atmosphere and sound is beyond belief and it really leaves me with the impression of a man who has been through good and bad times, but now he is \\"free from the chain gang\\". <br /> <br />I've rated it 5 stars, but compared to most pop-albums this one is beyond being ranked in such a manner. Truly outstanding.
B000FS9FCG|4.0|Here is a classic plotline co-opted so many times, I've lost count! \\"Brave New World\\" has been the ghost behind \\"Fahrenheit 451\\", \\"THX1138\\", \\"Gattika\\", \\"1984\\" and \\"A Clockwork Orange\\". Oppressive, sprawling government plows on unchallenged, until one individual decides to rebel/conform/escape. In the case of \\"V For Vendetta\\", we're talking a rebellion based on the inimitable botched plot of Guy Fawkes, on the fifth of November, 1605. A character, who we only know as \\"V\\", saves a media go-fer, played by Natalie Portman, just as she's about to be raped by two \\"enforcers\\" of the fascist government that has come to rule all of Britain and Lord knows where else, as the USA has declined into chaos and lost its position in the world. This character, a very well educated, cultured individual dead set on bringing down the Orwellian nightmare that is all around him, draws the grateful young girl into his world, giving her selective information on himself, judging her own possible inclination toward rebellion.<br /><br />This character wears a stylized Guy Fawkes \\"mask\\" 24/7, giving him a bizarre, stage-like appearance, with his permanent \\"expression\\" basically a smug grin topped by narrowed eyes. Hugo Weaving gives a terrific performance as the cultured \\"V\\", amazing you with his eloquence and style, not to mention his ruthlessness and determination in his mission. Another fine performance is given by John Hurt, as the main villain in the piece, the grand leader of the dystopic government, Chancellor Adam Suttler. Odd that the actor who played the victimized Winston Smith in 1984's \\"Nineteen-Eighty-Four\\", should play Big Brother in this piece. Natalie Portman provides a waifish, affecting visual as Evey, \\"V\\"'s essential \\"sidekick\\" in the film, but her attempt to synthesize a British accent leaves a little to be desired.<br /><br />\\"Blackadder\\" and \\"Wooster and Jeeves\\"'s Stephen Fry portrays Dietrich, a government approved wag that broadcasts his show to mollify the masses, until he decides to go after Suttler himself in one final episode of his TV show. Other actors involved are Stephen Rea as Inspector Finch and Sinead Cusack as a medical technician that has some history with \\"V\\".<br /><br />There is a Mephistophelean quality to \\"V\\" that will have you fascinated with him from the very beginning. Weaving's subtle, sometimes graceful performance, (the violent scenes are choreographed like ballet!) ought to at least have him CONSIDERED for an oscar nod! You are constantly amazed at: how well informed he is, how cultured he is, and how intelligent and resourceful and adept he is.<br /><br />But all this still doesn't counter what I think is an ending that sends a bad message. In the end (spoiler alert!) both Parliament and BIG BEN are blown up as \\"V\\" is given a viking sendoff by young Evey. This is after, in one of the opening scenes, Old Bailey is blown up as well! Somebody doesn't like Blair's Britain, eh wot?<br /><br />A VERY intriguing movie that gives the whole \\"1984\\" storyline a new spin.

1400032717|4.0|I spent my last 10 Australian Dollars on this book,just before flying out of Australia. I know its worth spending your last cent and dollar on this book because Ive been hearing about this book long before I finally got the chance to have it.<br /><br />It is an easy read, as it is a book for young adults. Fast readers can consume this book in a matter of just a couple of hours, but I wanted to prolong it because I didn't want the story to be finished so soon. (Rightly commented by The Observer, `Gave me that rare, greedy feeling of: this is so good I want to read it all at once but I mustn't or it will be over too soon'.)<br /><br />15 year old Christopher Boone lives in Swindon with his father. But he is no ordinary 15 year old. He is extremely intelligent, with a liking for prime numbers, and solving difficult mathematical equations. He also only recognizes 2 emotions: Happy and Sad. He cannot fathom how there can be emotions in between. He cannot tell any lies, and he does not understand metaphors. He does not like people or places that are unfamiliar to him. He wants everything planned and organized. He does not like to be touched, and does not like his food touching each other.<br /><br />He does not consider himself `not normal' though, and thinks that everyone is a `Special Needs' person. One night, his life takes a turn as he discovers his neighbor's dog murdered with a fork. Christopher decides to embark on an investigation to find out who murdered Wellington the dog.<br /><br />As he sets forth on his search for the dog murderer, Christopher discovers a whole lot more than just who killed the dog. His adventure takes him as far as reaching London on his own, and in the end, he gets a renewed courage and confidence as he discovers that there are a lot more things that he is capable of.<br /><br />Christopher manages to face both his inability to be `normal' and the pressures of a broken family. When `normal' people breakdown at the onset of a broken home, this book shows that Christopher, a `not so normal' person considered by society, faces his dilemmas with a beautiful determined and non-fatalistic attitude.<br /><br />I initially thought that this book would be a sort of \\"Forrest Gump Junior\\" story, but its far more than just a simple person/great success story. This book is really deserving of being a Whitbread Book of the Year. Young people and adults alike can learn a lot from this book--both about being a `special needs person' and believing in yourself.e, this book shows that Christopher, a `not so normal' person considered by society, faces his dilemmas with a beautiful determined and non-fatalistic attitude. <br /> <br />I initially thought that this book would be a sort of \\"Forrest Gump Junior\\" story, but its far more than just a simple person/great success story.

B000FVQYYK|5.0|I've listened to this CD a lot for the last week. I'd have to say it is my second-favorite Muse album (Absolution is better). This is a great CD. I think they took their foot off the accelarator a little bit, and it hasn't lessened the dynamic sound they have. Lots of driving, pulsing music, great vocals, and a wonderful orchestral sound that Muse has mastered.
B000B8QEYC|5.0|If you like \\"Enya\\", you will love this C.D.. It has been years since her last recording. This was worth waiting for. At times I am moved to tears by the haunting beauty and angelic clarity of her voice.
B0007TKNIS|5.0|The DVD is terrific. Good sound, colourful and brilliant. But it have not additional information about the composer and the production process.
B000F3AAUW|4.0|Gnarls is best when they stay close to the formula of \\"Crazy.\\"  Cee-lo has a great, soulful voice and Danger Mouse creates very cool beats.  There are some tracks that get a little too strange or try too hard to be \\"Dirty South.\\"  I like the first 5 tracks and the last 3 the most, there's some filler in the middle.

B00003CXZ1|4.0|Hard to make an action film with a woman as the main character, against all the Indiana Joneses and Bruce Lees of the world. Difficult to transform a video-game character into a real flesh and bone cinema character, against all the Draculas and Frankensteins who did the reverse trip. They had to bring some kind of English fabula into the picture, accent, tea and everything else, plus a touch of Cambodian safran buddhism and an ice-cube of Siberian whitish russianism. And it all works if you also add a pinch of extra-terrestrial magic that looks more like some Arabian astrology than anything from another constellation. But it does not really matter. Lara Croft is ready to run her first race with her chamber-valet and her rocking technical agent. And it works as much as we can hope, and in the end we can say the most admirable characters of the film are the sleigh-dogs who bring her back to her English mansion somewhere in a somewhat rainy tolerable climate. We recognized though some typical inspiration from the extremely British Clive Barker, but that might have been an illusion.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University of Paris Dauphine & University of Paris I Pantheon-Sorbonne
B00005JP4U|5.0|Anybody who has children, grandchildren, etc., must see this movie.  If future generations mean anything to you, you must see this movie.  If you expect to live another 20 years, YOU MUST SEE THIS MOVIE!  Enough said.
B000EGF0B4|5.0|I am one of those people who has seen Brokeback Mountain so many times that I am considered to be a Brokeaholic.  From the very first time I saw this magnificent film, based on the short story by Annie Proulx, brought to the screen with the words of Diana Ossana and Larry McMurtry under the direction of Ang Lee, we have two fictional characters, Jack Twist and Ennis Del Mar, who have been achingly and heartbreakingly brought to life through the performances of actors Jake Gyllenhaal and Heath Ledger.  Even the author was amazed at how deeply the actors delved into their characters.  Add to that the spectacular cinematography of Rodrigo Prieto and the haunting musical score by Gustavo Santoalalla, and the sum is a truly memorable piece of artisitic film work that will be venerated for years to come.   <br /> <br />Until the DVD was released in April 2006, the only way to view the film was in the theater in the widescreen format as created by Ang Lee.  Normally I would shy away from any full screen version DVD of a film that I truly admire, but after a careful comparison between the two formats, I must admit that there are definitely reasons to invest in a full screen version.  The immediate, obvious difference is of course the width of the screen, giving the widescreen the supposed advantage.  However on very careful examination, one finds additional visual material at the top and bottom of the full screen frame, for example, the scene immediately following the \\"reunion kiss\\" scene.  Taking place inside the Siesta Motel, we see Jack cradling Ennis with his right arm and Ennis's left hand caressing Jack's arm.  In the full screen version we see Ennis' wedding ring throughout the scene, in the widescreen version we do not see Ennis' wedding ring at all -- the frame is simply cut so that Ennis' ring is not visible.  This is but one of 15 examples that had been given a side-by-side scene comparison.  For the avid devotees of the film, having both versions will be an absolute necessity.  For those concerned about the big-screen scenic photography of the Canadian Rockies, the DVD makes a successful translation to the TV screen.   <br /> <br />Many devoted fans of Brokeback Mountain are anxiously awaiting the possible release of a Special Edition DVD, which will hopefully include many more bonus features, such as behind the scenes footage, outtakes, director/cast commentaries, etc.  The version that was released in April is considered by most to have been a \\"rushed out\\" version aimed at capitalizing on the very recent awards won by the film. <br /> <br />Recommendation:  If you have not seen the film, devote an uninterrupted period of 2-1/4 hours to fully experience this film.  Although it was summarily described as \\"that gay cowboy film,\\" Brokeback Mountain far transcends that simple catch phrase.  Plain and simply, Brokeback Mountain is a story of a relationship between two people, a relationship that would not have the approval of society in general, and how that relationship affects all those around them.  Have a box of Kleenex all ready to go . . .

6305718954|1.0|This movie was comical as to both content and production.  Yet, the producers brazenly add a concluding unscientific postscript about the gospel of Thomas discovered in 1945.  This movie overdid the trashed apartment theme a la Blake Edwards of Pink Panther lore.  The male voice coming from the woman probably sealed the priest's vow to remain celabite.  The supernatural power in the woman that trashed the New York subway train was apparently careless of the safety of the people on the subway, as well as reckless in disregard of the insurance claims.  The priests in this movie must have been modeled on the Anti Defamation League in their consummate fanaticism.  The one priest was fanatical, the other a borderline libertine.  Ironically, both appeal to the spirit of Hollywood and serve its purposes in giving credance to gnosticism by discrediting symbols of Christiandom.  However, in its ad hominem attacks, gnostic Hollywood stays free and clear from addressing any factual questions, such as the actual dating of the socalled gospel of Thomas.  If the \\"kingdom of God lies within you,\\" then why are people so selfish, greedy and rotten?  Gnostic Hollywood cannot answer this question.  What is brainwashing?  Who has that as their priority?  Brainwashing creates the appearance of appealing to the intellect while all the long censoring the person from contravening facts and arguments.  We don't hear both sides of the story in this film.  All we get is the classic informal fallacies of appeal to emotion and ad hominem attacks.  I hope the viewing public has enough self respect to pick up work written by Christian scholars who, unlike Hollywood, actually give you facts and information.    I recommend reading John A. T. Robinson's book \\"Redating the New Testament,\\" or F. F. Bruce's book \\"The New Testament Documents: Are they Reliable,\\" or Geisler and Nix's book \\"Guide to the Bible.\\"  While the canonical books clearly share an ideological parlance, they also can be dated withina few years of Christ's crucifixion.  The gnostic texts don't have this merit.  Furthermore, the gnostic texts are in contradiction to the teachings of the canonical texts.
B000000W5L|5.0|I listen to everything in the wide gamut of music from Marylin Manson to Nick Drake and out of my 1500+ CD's this would be in the top 5 albums ever recorded. I bought it as an impulse purchase one day after someone that I worked with said it was a great album. I was totaly blown away by it, it is dirty and dark and kicks out attitude like Pantera couldn't muster. If you don't feel the need to move your body while listening to 'Hip Shake' up loud you must be either dead or deaf as it is possibly the most infectious rock n'roll, dirty, dark, back room blues club, over driven amp sound you will ever hear. <br /> <br />Just buy it and when you listen to it forget it is the rolling stones and don't compare it to anything you have heard from them as nothing on 40 licks or the radio is on there, but you have to listen to the album from begining to end it is not a singles album, it is a night out in what rock n' roll was meant to be. I would give my left arm to have heard this whole album live at the time it was recorded in some dirty little bar somewhere in the south of france.
B000002BE9|5.0|I remember buying this album without hearing a song on it.  My instinct told me to, despite that I hated indie rock because of its whiny, adolescent, childish tone, and, mostly, because indie rock DOESN'T ROCK.  I was afraid that Ms. Apple was going to be another insipid Lisa Loeb clone (whose music is insipid), but hell no!  This woman has depth, soul, and what a voice.  She looks like a waif, but she has some of the greatest pipes on her.  This album (and her followups) are incredibly powerful, tuneful, and magnetic.  The production here is superb as well, making Apple's great songs even greater.  There were a few artists that managed to come out of the 1990's, and Fiona was one of them.  Sure, she didn't always behave in a mature way, but then, does the press really behave in a mature way?  Not the illiterate, American one, who drools over the stupidity of someone like Brittney Spears, but who makes fodder of someone like Apple who actually has some talent.  Fiona is a phenomenal woman.  I don't think she was ever a girl.  She's too smart to be just a girl.  Brilliant stuff....
B000055X3U|5.0|Along with Paradise Lost and My Dying Bride, Anathema were England's pioneers of doom-death, releasing a string of amazing albums before they realized it was time to expand and experiment. While My Dying Bride is still carrying the doom-death torch, pretty much any band from the early 90's, from Katatonia to Ulver to Tiamat to Moonspell, has changed, updating their sounds and dropping the growls in favour of crystal clean vocals.<br /><br />Anathema's transition began with Eternity, the album after the amazing The Silent Enigma, and blossomed with Alternative 4, perhaps their finest work from their post-doom period. With Judgement, however, the band became a completely different act, with polished production and tight arrangements defining their compositions. The songs focus heavier on Vincent Cavanagh's vocals and melancholic lyrics, and while there is plenty of guitar work, the melodies are mostly guided by Cavanagh's harmonies along with John Doughlas' straightforward yet very fitting drumming. Danny Cavanagh, on the other hand, provides the album's intense instrumentation. This is some of his finest playing, not only acoustic guitars but also fierce electric leads and stunning synth textures that lend the pieces a more Floydian touch overall.<br /><br />Judgement isn't as radical a change from Alternative 4 as Eternity was from The Silent Enigma. It is important, however, that a key member, bassist Duncan Patterson, parted ways with the band before they started writing this album. Patterson was an integral part of the Anathema sound, supplying the band's rock-solid rhythms along with long-time drummer John Douglas, who, ironically, would also leave after this disc. Patterson is replaced by Dave Pybus, another competent bass player. And while there isn't much room to showcase his talents, songs like \\"Pitiless\\" and \\"Wings of God\\" both feature his signature style. \\"Pitiless\\" is already a welcome change after the extremely dark and moving opener \\"Deep\\". It weaves heavier guitar work by the Cavanagh brothers, some spoken poetry and hummed harmonies, and a great lead solo drenched in sound effects. The band was still trying to inject new elements into their sound, as they had never released the same album twice. Whether you are a fan of the band or not, you have to give it to them that they always tried to break new ground without being afraid of putting their influences on display. Speaking of influences, traces of Radiohead can be heard in the intro and effect-laden guitars on \\"Don't Look Too Far\\", something which they would expand on in the future; and on the Floydian album finale \\"2000 & Gone\\", a strong piece to close the record on a somewhat psychedelic note. It is a beautiful instrumental that proudly boasts lush keyboard textures, spatial ambiances, and guitar feedback.<br /><br />The best songs are scattered around on the disc. From the mood-setter \\"Deep\\" to the desperate \\"One Last Goodbye\\", with great soloing and powerful vocals, Judgement still manages to be as varied as its predecessors. On an emotional level, the way the beautiful female vocals (by drummer John Douglas' sister) over delicate piano on \\"Parisienne Moonlight\\" bleed into the moving title track, which boasts plaintive synths blanketing textured acoustic guitars is simply intense. This is one of their most well-crafted songs, especially the way the guitar riffs build to that killer crescendo amidst rapid-fire drumming. \\"Emotional Winter\\" also deserves a mention. Very melancholic in its essence, the keyboards and guitar effects establish a thick soundscape through its course, with mirage-like guitar lines heard ringing distantly, thus providing added atmosphere.<br /><br />This album was dedicated to Helen Cavanagh, the Cavanagh brothers' mother, who passed away during the writing stages of these songs. I feel it's a very fitting release dedicated to her memory.ork by the Cavanagh brothers, some spoken poetry and hummed harmonies, and a great lead solo drenched in sound effects.

B000002JOH|1.0|I liked this so much better when it was called \\"Master of Puppets.\\"  That was a better, more original album anyways.  This one sounds like a grade school rehash.
0385504209|1.0|That such a poorly written piece of rubbish has sold so many copies and spawned such a craze regarding the origins of Christianity bodes ill for Western society.  The whole \\"holy blood, holy grail\\" nonsense has been shown repeatedly to be an incorrect reading of historical material; the \\"Priory of Sion\\" is a known fraud; the alleged \\"mystery\\" of the Templars is so much stuff and nonsense. I'm only surprised that the Nostradamus nonsense wasn't included for good measure; maybe they ran out of pulp.<br /><br />But people would rather read a badly written potboiler filled with horrific verbiage, terrible imagery, a badly presented version of both the English aristocratic system and organizations such as Opus Dei, and one-dimensional characters.  How sad.  And worse, they now flock to the scenes described in the book in great numbers, apparenly under the delusion that events described therein, or at least the circumstances behind them, were real.<br /><br />Another reviewer said the book was written for \\"Americans with the attention span of a gnat and the depth of cultural knowledge of a sea cucumber.\\"  I couldn't have phrased it better.<br /><br />It's too bad that negative numbers aren't allowed for Amazon reviews.  I give it one because zero isn't permitted.
B000ERU6QC|3.0|This cd is fun, the music is okay (there is no lasting quality, great work, feeling that you will get) but it is a fun, almost perverted work.<br /><br />The title \\"Death by Sexy\\" and cover artwork is a good representative of what you will get. Not serious, have a good time, riff oriented music.<br /><br />This is a side project for these band members and it sounds like it since the band is obviously having fun.<br /><br />The best songs are \\"Want you so Bad\\" and \\"Sweat\\"

B00005YXZH|5.0|This is what music should be... beautiful, challenging, daring, simple, melodic, enlightening. This is truly a tremendous album.<br /><br />This is not a singles work...it needs to be heard from start to finish...like Dark Side of the Moon.<br /><br />The cd is simply melodic, tuneful songs surrounding by and infected with a variety of noises. The noise, at first, makes the songs annoying but then you realize that the noise makes the songs more rewarding.<br /><br />There is an obvious pacing to the cd. It goes from loud to soft, noisy to quiet. If you saw the film \\"I am trying to break your heart\\" you will know that there was a tremendous amount of thought put into the album.<br /><br />The cd starts out with I am Trying to Break your heart. This is a preview with things to come. Tweedy is saying this cd is not going to be easy listening. Camera sounds noiseless but strange sounds do sneak into the tune at the end. Heavy Metal Drummer is another seemingly poppish song but shifts towards the end.<br /><br />My favorite song is \\"pot kettle black\\". It has an unusual structure and the instruments all change throughout the song.<br /><br />The last song is interesting because it is the most serene... its almost a reward for sticking with the album. The last song is just \\"pretty\\" like Wilco saying you made it through the album and now it will just nice, peaceful sounds.<br /><br />Wilco duplicates these songs live. They are tremendous musicians. Unlike most of the other crap out there, they take chances on each new work. Every cd is different.<br /><br />Wilco is the Pink Floyd/Sgt Pepper era Beatles of today. Anybody that is a musician, song writer or music affectianado will love them. Just remember, Wilco won't come to you...you must go to them.

Running Time: One Hour, 46 mins.<br />Directed by William Shatner.<br />Produced by Harve Bennett, Brooke Breton, Mel Efos, Gene Roddenberry, Ralph Winter.<br />Written by William Shatner, Harve Bennett, David Loughery.<br /><br />  Stardate: 8454.1. Year 2287. In Yosemite National Park, Kirk (William Shatner) is attempting to climb El Capitan while on shore leave.  McCoy (DeForest Kelley) is nervous watching Kirk through his high-tech binoculars.  Spock (Leonard Nimoy) propels in his jet boots to Kirk to help him understand his dangerous situation.  Suddenly Kirk falls and like Superman, Spock saves Kirk from a deadly fate.<br />  On the planet Nimbus 3, an evangelist/metaphysical Vulcan, &#34;Sybok&#34; (Laurence Luckinbill), who is Spock's half-brother, has befriended a new believer, J'onn (Rex Holman).  Meanwhile, Scotty, (James Doohan) is upset trying to get the new NCC 1701-A Enterprise to work in tip-top condition.  Uhura (Nichelle Nichols) offers Scotty some dinner.  Suddenly, the Enterprise receives an emergency call &#34;red alert, priority 7&#34; from Starfleet.  All shore leave officers are summoned to beam up, however Chekov (Walter Koenig) and Sulu (George Takei) are lost.  Leave it to Uhura to find everyone.<br />  When Kirk and Spock make it down to Nimbus 3, they are met by Caithlin Dar (Cynthia Gouw), Talbot (David Warner) and Kurrd (Charles Cooper) realizing they have been set-up.  Sybok intends to take over the Enterprise.<br /><br />Also in the cast: Melanie Shatner, Todd Bryant, Bill Quinn, Cynthia Blaise, Beverly Hart, Jonathan Simpson, Carey Scott, Mike Smithson, Spice Williams-Crosby, George Murdock.<br /><br />  During the campfire scene with Kirk, McCoy and Spock, Spock introduces a Marshmallow dispenser.  In 1989-90, Kraft Incorporated actually released  Marshmallow dispensers as a special offer (request of UPC symbols and fee) and sold the over-sized Marshmallows for the dispenser.  The kit came with utensils and a note from James T. Kirk.  I still own one in its original mailing box unopened.<br /><br />  Good line: &#34;... that I made the wrong choices in my life?

This album was so far ahead of its time, that it is still pertinent to today. This is truly a rare gem on the planet. None of the songs were ever in the top 40... so what? Do you wish to follow the sheep or do you wish to experience excellence?  <br />Okay, not into higher planes of thought? How about: No hype, it's good stuff! Guitar work excellent. Vocals excellent. Lyrics excellent. I guess I don't write reviews because it's so hard to put real meaning about something like this into words...

B000008JI5|5.0|By the release of SYNCHRONICITY, their fifth album, The Police were the biggest band in the world.  It came as quite a shock when the band members went their seperate ways at the peak of the group's popularity.  Fortunately, SYNCHRONICITY is as magnificent an epitaph as a band could wish for.

Though the other band members contribute some compositions (Stewart Copeland's charming \\"Miss Gradenko\\", Andy Summers' bizarre \\"Mother\\"), it's clear that Sting was running the show.

There's still some high-velocity songs here (\\"It's Alright For You\\", \\"No Time This Time\\"), but the majority of the tracks are a little more laid-back.  Half of REGGATTA DE BLANC features some of the band's best work, namely the classics \\"Message in a Bottle\\" and \\"Walking on the Moon\\", while the other half lacks the power and originality of some of the group's other compositions.  The result is the group's most unfocused and weak effort; the band has admitted that many of the songs were written simply as filler.  The album has many highlights, however (beside the aforementioned classics), including \\"The Bed's Too Big Without You\\", the Grammy Award-winning title track, \\"Bring on the Night\\", and Stewart Copeland's quirky, amusing \\"On Any Other Day\\".  It's not a bad album, but it is the least impressive album from The Police's portfolio.

B000F4LPJ6|5.0|This is a great movie.  Its is so disturbing not because a bunch of friends are forced to kill each other but because of the way everything is handled.  Every violent act is done is a screwed up humorous way.  I prefer this movie over the long winded book which you have to strain yourself to read the violence.  Also the manga gets a little boring at times and is more of a porno than anything else.  The movie has great acting and is never hard to understand. Its also not 'too artsy'.  its perfect.  It is way better than the second one.  Every character is fully developed and most have back stories.  Its hard to do that in any movie especially one where there are so many characters.  There was one weird moment where the main girl character has a dream.  That's really the only part I didn't understand.  In all I would say that this film is a turn gold standard of Japanese films.  Its one of my all time favorites.
0143036556|1.0|In his magnum opus, 1984, George Orwell famously wrote,  \\"Who controls the past, controls the future and who controls the present controls the past\\". This is a lesson that Jared Diamond has obviously learned well. <br /> <br />In his latest book \\"Collapse\\" Jared Diamond\\" continues to push the Europhobic liberal agenda. Hiding behind the facade of environmentalism Diamond crafts a sub-text that calls for Europeans to embrace the values of failed third-world cultures and abandon the pursuit of technological advancement that has created global European cultural hegemony. Unfortunately for Diamond, genuine scientific research is revealing much of his work to be based on nothing more than wishful thinking and an overactive imagination. <br /> <br />Diamond makes the assertion that Easter Island experienced a cultural collapse due to depletion of natural resources and overpopulation. This may conflate well with the tenets of liberalism but unfortunately for Mr Diamond, it does not conflate well with the factual findings of the latest archaeological investigations. Radiocarbon dating of soil samples, by Carl Lipo and Terry Hunt, indicate that Easter Island was not inhabited until two to eight hundred years after the occupation time that Diamond's theory would require. Quite simply, the new evidence uncovered by Lipo and Hunt indicates that the period of human habitation of Easter Island was far too short for Diamond's putative collapse to have been the result of overpopulation. To quote Carl Lipo,  <br /> <br />\\"It fits our 21st century view of us as ecological monsters. There's no doubt that we do terrible things ecologically, but we're passing that on to the past, which may not have been actually the case, to stick our plight on to them is unfair\\" <br /> <br />It is difficult to over-emphasise just how badly compromised Diamond is by this evidence. The Easter Island chapter is a major plank in his argument, the fact that Diamond is rank ignorant of the latest archeological research reveals him to be an amateur polemicist rather than a scientific authority figure. <br /> <br />Those who may think that Diamond's Easter Island fantasy is simply an abberation might want to introduce some hard science into their analysis of Diamond's version of the history of Greenland. The extinction of Greenland's Viking colony is used by Diamond to enforce the ideology of modern liberalism. Diamond claims that the Vikings perished because a racist contempt for the Inuit prevented them from assimilating ideas that would have prevented their slow starvation. A cultural superiority complex caused the Viking colonists to cling to an unviable agricultural lifestyle and, in Diamonds words, \\"The Greenland colonists starved to death surrounded by oceans teeming with fish\\". This is an analysis that neatly dovetails with modern pro-immigrant, liberal cultural relativism and the dogma of multiculturalism. The major flaw in Diamond's argument is that the latest historical research shows that by the time of the colony's extinction the Greenland Vikings had, in point of fact, switched from a diet that was 80% farm food to a diet that was 80% marine food.  In otherwords, the Viking colonists proved to be perfectly capable of adapting to environmental change without having to learn lessons from stone age primitives. To present the Vikings as beloning to a soley agrarian culture in the first place would be the cause for much derisive laughter among genuine historians. The Vikings are well known (unless you are Diamond) to have exploited a rich variety of marine life as a food resource.  <br /> <br />The alternative explanation for the Vikings demise is that the mini-ice age that caused the Vikings to switch diets also witnessed a mass immigration of Alaskan Inuit who competed with the Vikings for food and finally massacred them in an unrecorded genocide. We know about the mini ice-age from the evidence of core samples and tree rings. We know about the Innuit peregrinations through archeology and folk record. In the face of genuine science and history I'm afraid Mr Diamond is left up a certain creek without means of conveyance. Historians tend not to write about evolutionary biology, perhaps evolutionary biologists might in future restrain their urge to embarrass themselves by writing about history?  <br />
B000F7CMRM|5.0|After being subjected to countless hollywood fluff movies with some sort of far fetched love triangle or what have you, Syriana is a breath of fresh air.  The plot is amazing, don't believe what people tell you about it being muddled or not making sense - everything is connected - Syriana amazingly portrays the heartlessness of a cold, cruel world only interested in money.  More importantly for myself, it opened my eyes as sometimes we as 'patriotic americans' tend to forget that America can be just as ruthless as anybody else.

1592401791|3.0|Emerick provides the most in-depth perspective yet of the Beatles' recording methods. We've all heard about how innovative the Beatles were in the studio, and here we get specific examples. Emerick also tells us about the role he played in creating the sounds the Beatles were going for. <br />Emerick focuses on the music, but on occasion he delves into the personal about the Beatles. He was never personally close with them. He never had more than a working relationship with them. <br />This may seem kind of harsh, but the impression I got was that Geoff Emerick is your typical dork with little social skills. This doesn't mean that he's a bad person. I'm sure we've all known people who have been excellent at their jobs but aren't anyone we'd want to hang out with. Emerick constantly talks about how he never got to dine with the Beatles and how he had few conversations with them other than discussing work. I can't speak for John, Paul, George or Ringo, but he certainly comes across as a guy I wouldn't want to have a meal or a drink with. <br />I think the best way to describe Geoff Emerick is this: He's exceptional at his job, but he's a complete nerd. <br />As for the little war between Elizabeth and Candice: I've read the entire book, and the truth probably lies in between, although it might be a little closer to what Candice says. <br />I don't think he was Paul's lapdog, but since Paul paid him the most attention, he was more partial to him. If you're as uncool as Geoff was, and someone as cool as Paul McCartney acknowledges your existence, you'd be pretty grateful. But to say he's not wildly impartial to Paul is a flat-out lie. <br />Also, Emerick makes quite a few mentions about George's ineptitude playing solos. He doesn't go into George's songwriting much, but he does say how poor the others seemed to think his early efforts were. He does say quite a few times how sullen and dour he found George. <br />He doesn't say much of anything about Ringo. <br />He mentions how sad he was when John was shot and how he remembered the good and the bad about John, but I don't recall many passages in the book where he focuses on the positive. Just about every reference to John seems to be about his violent mood swings and how impatient he could be. That wasn't every reference to John, but it was most of them.
1586217194|5.0|I listened to this book on my way to/fro work and I loved it. About first impressions, snap judgments (and misjudgments) and facial expressions and from topics ranging from marriage to military war games, this book kept me interested from beginning to end. It is definitely not a \\"thriller\\" since it is not fiction but spell binding nonetheless. The author quotes from relevant research and it does made me wonder how much control my sub conscious actually has over me. <br />The narration for the audiobook is by the author and is read in a matter of fact and conversational way, which is easy on the ears. <br />A must read if you loved Freakanomics and/or The Wisdom of Crowds since I feel the book belongs to same genre. <br /> <br />

B0000029GA|5.0|The word \\"classic\\" is thrown around quite abit. What makes a classic? If it has acceptable lyrics, is it a classic? Does it have to have inspiring beats? Does it have to be accepted by underground hip hop heads? Does it have to cross a 10 year period for it to obtain \\"classic status\\"? Not necessarly. Nasir Jones debut \\"Illmatic\\" was a classic the day it was released. It was accepted by everyone. Reading all the respectable reviews on this album, everyone seems to know what an impact \\"Illmatic\\" was in the hip hop generation.<br /><br />In 1994, Nas lead the Golden Hip Hop Era with his debut of street poetry and intellegent street rhymes. Tracks like \\"NY State Of Mind\\" and \\"The World Is Yours\\" (Produced by Pete Rock) is just some small examples of perfect lyricism. \\"Life's A B****\\" features AZ comming off hungry on the mic and Nas carring out the second verse with rhymes like \\"When I was young at this, I used to do my thing hard/robbing foriegners, take their wallets and jewels, and rip their green cards/dip to the projects, fast, in my quick cash/got my first piece of (...), smoking blunts with hash...\\", while his father Olu Dara closes off the track with a trumpet solo. Q-Tip produced the dedicated lyrical letter \\"One Love\\" to Cormega who was incarcerated at the time, that carries a nice xylophone beat, makes it one of my favorite tracks on this album. Another one of my favorites is the head nodding last track \\"It Ain't Hard To Tell\\", ending this album off on a good note. Production is curteosy of DJ Primer, Q-Tip, Pete Rock, Large Professor.<br /><br />And if you purchased this in 2004 (referring to the 10 Year Anniversery Edition that is also available on Amazon), it has been remastered (for people like me who were too young to buy this at the time) with a bonus disc. The bonus disc features some remixes of some of the origonal tracks, and some newly recorded tracks that Nas made. The remix tracks I like is the \\"Life's A B**** (Remix)\\" and \\"The World Is Yours (Remix)\\", because they are able to match the origonals in a way, but stll allowing them to matain their clasic status. \\"It Ain't Hard To Tell (Remix)\\" and \\"One Love (Remix)\\" are good too, but to me, they don't carry the vibe of the origonals. The recently recorded tracks \\"Star Wars\\" and \\"On The Real\\" are good additions to the bonus disc, as neither track fails.<br /><br />To think, many people were raised off of classics like these. Every track is rememberable in it's own way (even the opening skit is rememberable), as Nas' street poetry, and the production in this album takes hip hop into a new height. We all know Nas (or anyone else) has never topped this album, but he has came close to it under many ocassions. Whats really sad about this is that there are people out there who claim to listen to hip hop, but never heard this album at all. Well, if you don't have this album and you claim to be a \\"Hip Hop Head\\" shame on you. If you're new to hip hop (not rap people!) and are looking to start a classic hip hop collection, I recommend that this will be the first album you pick up, then go from there.

1883217040|5.0|Mark Levine's \\"Jazz Theory Book\\" is an important resource for anyone interested in learning jazz harmony, in a complete fashion. Most books on jazz theory leave some things out, or don't explain something fully, forcing the player the buy another book to try to fill the holes. This book covers all the bases and the concepts can be applied to any instrument (reading music is necessary).  <br /> <br />The book starts off pretty basic, but then quickly gets into such wide-ranging concepts as chord/scale theory, reharmonization, Coltrane changes, and others. Levine explains things clearly, sometimes in musical examples rather than words (this means you must be self motivated and actually analyze the examples, that's why they are there). Some reviewers have complained about the amount of musical examples, but I liked seeing the concepts applied a few different ways in the context of real tunes. For me, all the examples were a plus, not a minus. The footnotes were also helpful.  <br /> <br />This book is not going to do the work for you. It has the answers, but simply reading the words while you are waiting for dinner to cook is not going to make you into a great jazz musician. Play through the examples, read things over more than once, apply the concepts to other tunes in your own playing, and you will have everything covered. Also, the spiral binding is a great touch; the book can be opened easily to any page and stay there (I wish every book had this binding, actually).  <br /> <br />Overall this book is a great learning tool for musicians of any skill level. It has a wide variety of topics, all well laid out, and will provide the musician with some much-needed skills.
0743243153|5.0|Peck's definition of love is unparalleled in any of the literature I have read concerning the matter. I have always been particularly fond of Kahlil Gibran's depiction of marriage and love. However, I feel that Peck redefines it in modern English and provides a contrast to the \\"mainstream\\" view of love and \\"falling in love.\\"  <br /> <br />One caveat, though I agree with his position concerning psychotherapy, readers should be aware that due to the late Peck's profession, he was biased towards psychotherapy.
B000FP2OPY|5.0|Television drama seems to have its peaks and troughs. No sooner do we lose shows like Buffy and Firefly, then along come high calibre shows like Dr Who and Supernatural to take up the slack.<br /><br />Supernatural follows the adventures of two brothers - Sam and Dean Winchester, played respectively by Jared Padalecki and Jensen Ackles. The show focuses on the these two guys as they do battle with a variety of monsters, all the time trying to locate their missing father and find the demon that killed their mother 20 years previously, and that more recently killed Sam's girlfriend. Having been trained by their father to hunt down and destroy ghosts, monsters etc, following the death of their mother, each episode sees them take on creatures such as The Wendigo, Bloody Mary, vampires, spirits, dead serial killers, killer trucks... to name just a few!<br />All the time though, little bits of information come their way regarding their father, and the nature of the demon that they are trying to track down. This gives the whole series a real flow and while each episode is a self contained and generally excellent story, everything builds up nicely to the series finale which is superb when it arrives.<br /><br />Characterisation is really good, the banter and bonhommie between the two brothers is well realised and enjoyable. Jensen Eckles is great as the wise cracking and protective older brother - Dean. Jared Padalecki shines as the sensitive and thoughtful Sam, the younger brother who has been forced by events to go 'hunting', rather than be there by choice. Equally clashes between the two brothers are shown and realistically depicted.<br />Their father is very well played by Jeffrey Dean Morgan when he makes his appearances, and is a well fleshed out portrayal of sadness and pathos.<br /><br />I have watched every episode of Supernatural and like any series, some episodes are better than others. Taken as a whole though, this is first class entertainment and really is a credit to its cast and makers. I am really looking forward now to the imminent start of Series 2.m really looking forward now to the imminent start of Series 2.
006056251X|4.0|Sebastian is probably one of the sexiest heroes ever created! He is HOT. Evie, on the other hand, is certainly lovely. She's sweet-tempered and alluring, but also strong and independent. Sebastian, although an insensitive brute in the beginning, gradually grows soft and warm where Evie is concerned. Although a bit formulaic at times, Kleypas still writes an entertaining and passionate love story. Just one minor issue that I didn't like in the book: the brief encounter between Cam Rohan and Daisy Bowman! (That one kissing scene was a scorcher!). And such an exciting episode that I'm sorely disappointed (like other reviewers) to know that they aren't the romantic leads in the last Wallflower installment. In SCANDAL IN SPRING, Daisy is going to fall head over heels in love with some stuffy American called, Matthew Swift! But Kleypas is currently in the works with Cam's own story (A MAN FOR ALL SEASONS). Can't wait for its release.    Overall, DEVIL IN WINTER, is a fun and engaging romance novel with two very endearing protagonists. Highly recommended--especially for those who have read, DREAMING OF YOU.
B000EQ47HC|4.0|(Just as a note, this review concerns the remastered sound). <br /> <br />Boston has always had a great sound on CD, at least in my opinion, but Tom Scholtz decided to take it one step further and remaster the sound. <br /> <br />And because of that, Don't Look Back has a great sound on CD.  It's sound quality is comparable to any CD released this year.  I must admit that Tom Scholtz did an excellent job, and I would definately recommend buying the remastered edition, even if one already has Don't Look Back on CD.

0743487583|5.0|Frankenstein is one of the most beautifully written novels I've ever read. Besides its smooth style of writing, it has also enlightened me thourgh two major themes. The first is its revelation of indivudal's fragility compared to nature's unparalled power. The main character Frankenstein's desprate endeavor in creating a monster of perfection is equivalent to an attempt to completely control one's fate and get ride of nature's influence, which results in nature's retaliation as the monster slaughter all the people connected Frankensten. The second is the excitement and fear from solitude and loneliness. The former feeling exists before Frankenstein successful created the monster and the latter feeling arises after the experient is accomplished and done. These two extreme feelings  shown in the book, coincide with our daily experience, showing how loneliness can help a person achieve the extraordinary and how it can make a person suffer from the unthinkable, the despairing, the worst.

0684824906|5.0|This is a fascinating book that does more than grab the reader into learning about Abraham Lincoln and his impact in changing the course of history for the better.  It also is a well researched presentation of the important Cabinet advisors who not only helped shape the outcome of the Civil War and the end of slavery, but shows how Lincoln had the wisdom and foresight to sculpt outcomes he desired.  Lincoln did this in a unique manner, knowing how to position himself while using his rivals to work towards his common aim, with Lincoln slyly in control.<br /><br /> If Lincoln's Presidency was an accident of fate, it was a fate that it turns out that Lincoln himself provided significant input.  After all, he is the only one term Congressman who lost two races for the U.S. Senate to ever become President.  Despite this seemingly lack of proper requisite for the job, Lincoln deliberately knew that by both eloquently and, importantly, honestly opposing the spread of slavery from a moral view, he would gain much respect as he toured the country in giving his thoughts on the idea.  While the awkward looking man with the high pitched voice might have been overlooked as Presidential material, the rave reviews on his comments brought Lincoln to heightened public attention.<br /><br /> This book presents how Lincoln deliberately took what was then a moderate position on the slavery issue and, more important, avoided the code words that stirred the passions of the radicals yet would achieve the disapproval of the conservatives.  This proved crucial, for while few Republican factions favored Lincoln for President, he was acceptable to the various factions.  While Lincoln's availability for the President was known, he was essentially viewed as a favorite son candidate from Illinois with strong support in neighboring Indiana.  Astute political observers would have noted those were two critical battleground states that Republicans needed to carry in order to win, which would assist in Republican delegates turning to a candidate that could carry those two states.  Yet, initially, Lincoln's Presidential candidacy was not viewed as serious so Lincoln supporters were able to convince the Republicans to hold their 1860 nominating convention in the supposedly neutral city of Chicago, which allowed Illinois Republican to pack the audience with vocal Lincoln partisans to help convince delegates that Lincoln had great support.<br /><br /> The book provides a detailed portrait into the lives and thoughts not only of Lincoln's, but of his opponents for the 1860 Presidential nomination.  William Seward, the champion of the more radical anti-slavery faction, was the front runner, yet was unable to gain the support of a majority of the delegates.  The two other main candidates, Salmon Chase and Edward Bates, had their followings but their bitter enemies as well.  Chase avoided the rhetoric of Seward in hopes of appearing more acceptable to a wider range of delegates, yet factionalism and opposition form within his home state of Ohio severely harmed his candidacy.  Bates had a stronger political background than Lincoln and was helped by the support of New York newspaper publisher Horace Greeley, but he was from the relatively small state of Missouri that offered little political pull at the convention.  Greeley did help block the nomination of fellow New Yorker and early front runner Seward.  In the clash of these titans of their era, the delegates turned to the one candidate that a majority could agree upon, a candidate who had always been in the Republican center (unlike his rivals who tried to reposition themselves in that center) and that was Lincoln.<br /><br /> President Lincoln later made the unusual, but wise move, to incorporate these opponents into his Cabinet.  It is important to note that while Lincoln valued their advice, Lincoln incorporated them more to subjugate these factions under his leadership.  Lincoln proved to be a commanding leader, especially for one with such limited previous government experience, which became critical in ultimately holding the neutrality of the border states, emancipating slavery permanently, and leading the Northern states to win the Civil War.<br /><br /> This book provides an excellent portrait of the life of Lincoln and how that life helped shaped the man who would bring an end to slavery.  This book uniquely is a Lincoln biography, biography of the people who influenced Lincoln and his times, and a history of those times including critical background leading to important events.  This is an outstanding of analysis of various aspects of Lincoln and his era.  These were times that included a war that cost more American lives than all other American wars combined, and what up until then were the largest military operations in world history.

These were times that included a war that cost more American lives than all other American wars combined, and what up until then were the largest military operations in world history.  It provides insightful analysis from an author who views Lincoln as man of much empathy, rather than melancholy as many other biographers concluded, and how that honest concern for others drove his life's missions.   <br />
B00004RFFS|5.0|Interview with a vampire was a amazing movie to say the least.<br /><br />I saw this movie shortly after it come to video only because I was kind of busy giving birth to see it at the theaters lol.<br /><br />I must say I did not read the book until after I saw the movie,but the movie was the reason I started to read her books on vampires.<br /><br />I was surprised after reading the book how closely Neil Jorden tried to stick to Ann's story. It's a rare thing for hollywood to stick closely to the authors story.<br /><br />Another thing that amazed me was how good Tom Cruze and Brad Pitt where in the movie. Like a lot of people I thought Tom would not be cut out to play such a dark role and Brad well I did not really have a thought on him at the time. Brad shows such depth in the role of Louis the vampire of regret and sorrow for all things pasted. And Tom really did surprise the hell out me and after reading the book I felt he kept true to the feel of Lesta.  One thing I can say that will blow you away about this movie is Claudia played by Kristin Dunst, a young vamp like maybe the age of 10 when Lesta turned her. Cursed to remain forever the child. Given that the matter of this movie is dark and not really a movie you would normaly think of a child playing a role in it. After all we all grew up thinking vamps were growning ups. Any way Claudia was a prowerful character and I think Kristin at times out shined even Brad and Tom's characters. You had no problem believeing she was a vamp and that this was a first for her to play. She played it well and held her own in this movie.<br /><br />  Really ladies and Gents this is a good movie and its just a shame Hollywood and Ann could not have gotten Neil Jorden to direct the last vampire movie Ann let hollywood do. If she had the last one would of been so much better.
B000EYK4KI|1.0|I knew little about the film when it came on TV.   Naturally, I heard about Pitt and Jolie.  Who hasn't?  He left his lovely wife for a new cutie that he met while making this movie.  Both actors were boring and so was the script.   I thought I'd seen it all, but this one takes the cake.  The plot (what plot?) was a disaster.  You think, at first, they are just an average rich couple bored with each other and marriage.  And why not?  They barely talk to each other!   But soon you realize that this couple are each secret assassins married to each other, but neither one knows what the other does, despite the fact that all the high tech assassin stuff is hidden all over the house, in the oven, in the garage, under the kitchen cabinets, the microwave, the cutlery drawer, and anywhere a movie director and a computer geek can think of to hide it.   <br /> <br />These assassins are very, VERY  high tech.  (All of Jolie's associates are very sexy women)  In one scene Jolie escapes like a scene from Spider Man, where she slides down a very tall building on a thin little cord.   At that point, I nearly turned it off.  <br /> <br />Finally the two discover the profession of the other, and that they are working for two different organizations.  What kind?   We don't know.  Organizations that murder people, whoever they're supposed to be.   Then they get an assignment in which they are both going after the same person (but it's not too clear, why).  Never is.   Anyway, on this mission they spot each other on opposite sides, so they figure out that each of them is in the same business.  At first they decide to kill each other, and at that point it becomes totally ridiculous as they chase each other around the house and down the road.   <br /> <br />While preparing for the End Time, a few kids come up to Pitt and ask \\"What are you doing?\\"  Answer:  \\"Uh, preparing for a block party.\\"   (or something like that. Don't remember.)   <br /> <br />At some point, the two change their minds about killing each other and from there the movie is just a jazzed up chase film.  I don't know how it ends, because at that point, I turned it off, and my husband had already fallen asleep.      <br /> <br />Personally I think films that resemble Spider Man or Batman should remain cartoons.  That's what they were meant to be.  I like a film with a good plot, good acting and as little high tech movie nonsense as possible.
B00005IC2H|5.0|Sigur Ros' debut is one of the weirdest CD's I've owned for a few years.  I just listened to it the other day and I am still blown away by its awesomeness.  It's sung in a made-up language by Icelandic space rockers.   <br /> <br />The songs are beautiful, long and well-crafted.  There is generous use of the string sections.  The entire album is dreamy.  It sounds like it was made on an alien planet, or music made in the future. <br /> <br />This album is gorgeous music.  It always calms me down.  This is always a good album to put on if you want to fall asleep to - it works for me every time.  Tremendous debut - they'll never top this.  I can't recommend this one enough.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|Serenity is a very well rounded, and exciting sci-fi film. I was very happy to find out that you really didn't have to see the TV series to understand the film. I am now watching the series, and I am enjoying it very much as well. Someone in a review way before mine commented that the tv series was basically \\"Gunsmoke in Space\\". Is this a bad thing? I watched Gunsmoke when I was a kid, and loved it! The entire cast works very well together, even for already being on an unfortunately short-lived TV series. This is a very good film, just give it a chance, and you shouldn't be disappointed.
B0001KZM3O|5.0|This is a *superb* masterpiece of an album.  It was recorded in several studios in the UK in 1982 and is the last Pink Floyd album to feature Roger Waters, who wrote it alone.  Some people like to refer to it as a solo Waters album using the name Pink Floyd since it was dominated by Waters, but it does feature one Gilmour lead vocal, \\"Not Now John,\\" and Gilmour's masterful guitar playing can be heard throughout this album.  Waters actually offered to release it as a solo album, but Gilmour insisted that it be a Pink Floyd album.  The songwriting is poignant and deep, and the lyrics are poetry. The production quality, of course, is flawless.  In keeping with all of Waters' albums, this is a concept album.  It deals with several different concepts.  One of them is the state of world affairs at the time it was made, particularly the Falkland Islands War.  It condemns Thatcher, Reagan, and Begin quite explicitly.  Another concept deals with a WWII veteran who is now a schoolteacher who takes out his problems on the children and generally laments his life.  There is also a story of a depressed man (likely, Pink from The Wall) who ultimately tries to kill himself but is stopped.  The album ends with the theme of nuclear annhilation, and perhaps Pink's fate, left unclear at the end of The Wall, becomes clear. The songs really have to be heard to be believed - they are very emotional, deeply moving, and somber.  Definitely nothing to be listened to while having a wild party or something like that.  The album cover, designed by Waters, is also very interesting, including ribbons - stars, medals, and crosses for service in WWII.  The album is dedicated to his father, who died in Anzio during WWII.  All in all, this beautiful album is a true work of art and a very proper and graceful way for Roger to bow out of his musical relationship to David Gilmour, who was actually fighting against the creation and concept of this album tooth and nail.  My personal favorite songs on thisalbum are \\"The Gunner's Dream,\\" \\"Paranoid Eyes,\\" \\"Southampton Dock/The Final Cut,\\" and \\"Two Suns in the Sunset.\\"  I love how the last song on this album, which Roger had intended to be Pink Floyd's last album, closes with the words \\"the end.\\"  (\\"Ashes and diamonds, Foe and friend, We were all equal in the end...\\" - what lyrics)  These are some of the most emotionally moving songs Pink Floyd has ever recorded.  This album can bring you to tears if you listen carefully.
0446677450|1.0|(Feb 2007)I got Rich Dad Poor Dad about 5 years ago, and I earnestly tried to put Kiyosaki's ideas into practice. I have yet to make a dime directly out of it. I re-read the book quite a few times over the years, just in case I had misunderstood any of it, but I still am completely unable to make his principles work. Kiyosaki's writing does stir up strong emotional responses, yet nothing more. His principles fail because, in reality, vast amounts of start up capital and the ability to predict the future would be required for HIS methods to produce the consistently high yields he claims. He says \\"don't work for money, make money work for you\\", but in reality, you always have to put in SOME effort, somewhere along the line, to make money.     If not for the fact that I also read other books and pursued other plans over the years, I'm sure Kiyosaki's advice alone would have bankrupted me, as it has done to at least one person I know.    The inaccuracies in the book outweigh any good points the book may have. For example, most people now KNOW that Martha Stewart went to PRISON for insider trading, and so for the author to BLATANTLY recommend it, is absurd. Anyone who has read that part of it, and then goes on to positively recommend the book to other people ought to be ashamed of themselves. Yet people CONTINUE to recommend this book! Insider trading is ILLEGAL. If you don't believe me, just check the internet.     It's interesting to note that Donald Trump has now written a book with Kiyosaki. Trump had no problem publicly doing business with Martha Stewart, even after she had been exposed as a convicted felon.    The high sales of this book only points to how desperate people are to become rich. On the subject of book sales, The Bible and The Koran have both sold BILLIONS of copies. Both of those books also contain some financial advice and have sold far more copies than Kiyosaki's trash ever will, so if you are considering buying into Rich Dad based solely on evidence of high book sales, you would obviously be better off buying one of those religious books instead, as they have sold much more copies.    I have met many Kiyosaki devotees who claim to have a so called \\"positive\\" outlook. These Kiyosaki cultists have a tendency to LIE about their current financial status, in order to keep their mis-guided dreams going and to make themselves look like some kind of big-shot. One Kiyosaki devotee I know, went on to have their house re-possessed, as they had left their job to start a business which they thought would be easy to do without much effort . \\"I don't work for money, money works for me\\", he would say, parrot fashion. Kiyosaki might say these are all learning experiences, but these devotees have families with children, and real responsibilities toward them. If Tom Cruise can be hoodwinked into believing Scientiology, its not that big a surprise that Kiyosaki has used the same tactics to dupe millions. You would be amazed if you knew how little money these Kiyosaki followers actually have. I found out purely by accident that another of my friends who constantly raves about Kiyosaki, now has a credit rating so poor, that now banks will not allow him to open an account at all! And all that time he had been pretending to everyone that he was rich! Next time you meet a follower of Kiyosaki, ask to see his bank statement.    Millions of people have purchased this book, yet only one person (John T Reed) has even bothered to do a proper investigation into the author's background. Why aren't all the millions of people who purchased this book, going out there, and doing their own research into Kiyosaki's business history? Kiyosaki is now one of the best selling self-help authors of all time, and considering that he is dispensing financial advice, he surely deserves far more scrutiny from the investigative media than he has so far been getting. For all those people who are STILL positively recommending this book, please go out and do aninvestigation into Kiyosaki, then tell us all about it.    Kiyosaki's cash cow continues to milk the innocent public dry. He has a board game costing many hundreds of bucks. I personally know of 3 people who have spent money on the game, and now regret the purchase. The game has a huge price mark up, yet is nothing special, just paper and cardboard. I have sat down to play it a few times with different groups, and it is more boring and time consuming than monopoly. Robert Kiyosaki has around 20 books out now, and shockingly, even his wife Kim has written a book to cash in. His seminars cost many thousands. If you want to be poor and unhappy.....take out loans you can't afford to repay, and waste the loot on Kiyosaki's \\"educational tools\\".    In my quest to get rich, I have read many books and websites, attended a few seminars, and I continue to seek out new information. The best book I have ever read on making money is \\"The Richest Man in Babylon\\" by George Clason, which has made me many thousands, simply by saving money working at my normal, boring job, and quietly amassing enough money to survive for many years without a job, and for investing. Other books to buy on getting rich (that actually work in real life), are: \\"The Millionaire Next Door\\" and \\"The Millionaire Mind\\" (both by Thomas Stanley). To reach my own financial goals will probably take me about ten years, as getting rich is a slow, step by step process. I have yet to find a get rich quick scheme, and I consider Rich Dad poor Dad a bad investment, as I lost money by buying it.     When I first got the book, I thought the incomprehensible techniques he proposed were secret formulas that only \\"The Rich\\" used, and as soon as I understood it, the big money would come rolling in. After 5 years, I still don't understand the techniques in the book, and I eventually came to realise that Kiyosaki was just talking garbage. I do not recommend that anyone buys Rich Dad Poor Dad, as it really is just a nice fantasytale, and nothing more. Trust me on this because I, (and other people I know) have had 5 years of using it and have not yet made one dime out of it.
B000002H33|5.0|Master of Puppets is Metallica's best album.  It is absolutely amazing from start to finish in every regard.  Every track is excellent.  There is nothing I can say about this brilliant, groundbreaking album that hasn't been said before, so I will rank Metallica's albums instead, from best to worst:      1.  Master of Puppets  2.  And Justice for All  3.  Ride the Lightning  4.  Kill 'em All  5.  Garage Days ('87-88? release - hard to find now)  6.  The Black Album    \\"Nothing else matters...\\"
B000002MUN|5.0|This album, Petty's second solo billing, is somewhat of an artistic peak for the singer/songwriter with his musical and spiritual sensibilities and a mixture of feelings and emotions coming to the fore. <br /> <br />Rick Rubin's production was a refreshing change for Petty after some success with the Lynne sound was starting to repeat itself on Into The Great Wide Open. This change worked for Petty and sounds refreshing to this day. Rick did a terrific job on the Heartbreakers hit the year before, Mary Janes Last Dance. <br /> <br />Like that single, this album was well recieved, building on the attention and respect that Tom Petty was gaining at the time after many wrote him off as an act whose best was behind him.  <br /> <br />The album went platinum three times over and remains a fan favourite to this day. It is fresh, inspiring, catchy, honest, emotive, spiritual, joyous and class from start to finish. <br /> <br />The hits from this album, \\"You Don't Know How It Feels\\" \\"You Wreck Me\\" \\"It's Good To Be King\\" are a great taste of what to expect on this album, and they recieved alot of airplay for Petty on both radio and MTV. <br /> <br />One song that stands out for me is the achingly beautiful \\"Crawling Back To You\\" it surely is up with the best the man has ever done. \\"Don't Fade On Me\\" has Tom and Mike, Heartbreaker guitarist, both on acoustic guitar delivering a somber and harrowing song that was different as anything Petty ever recorded. <br /> <br />There are catchy songs such as the shining \\"A Higher Place\\" and the infectious \\"Cabin Down Below\\". <br /> <br />This would have to be up there with Damn the Torpedoes and this and the aforementioned are the two records I would recommend to anyone who enjoyed the Greatest Hits. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B000002UA0|5.0|If there ever was an album in rock music that can be taken like a fairy tale, this is it.  Pink Floyd's first album, written mostly by their first leader, Syd Barrett, is a work of creative genius.  This album will cause the listener to experience a world of childlike wonder.  It is full of whimsical lyrics about scarecrows, gnomes, cats, unicorns, stars, and bicycles, as well as lots of psychedelic instrumental music.  It should definitely be considered a psychedelic album.  In my opinion, it is the best psychedelic album ever made, and it had a tremendous influence on psychedelic rock music in the 1960's.   The album's title comes from the seventh chapter of the children's book The Wind in the Willows.  Interestingly, it is the only Pink Floyd album without David Gilmour present.  He had not yet been asked to join the band, and Syd Barrett was singing and playing guitar.  The other three members of Pink Floyd are on this album - Roger Waters on bass and vocals, Richard Wright on piano, organ, and vocals, and Nick Mason on drums.  I would say that this is Pink Floyd's most unique album, mostly because of the presence of Syd Barrett, who is all over this album.  I would also characterize this as Pink Floyd's happiest album, because of Syd's artistic outlook.  Listening to this album convinced me that Syd Barrett was actually a creative genius.  It is sad that he became schizophrenic and had to leave the band.  David Gilmour, who replaced Barrett, helped take Pink Floyd in a different direction musically, but Syd Barrett was indeed a \\"diamond.\\" This very interesting album is one of the most priceless gems of the late 1960's.  In a sense, this is Pink Floyd's  \\"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band.\\"  A truly fantastic, very influential album that no Pink Floyd collection is complete without.
B00005JNTX|4.0|This is one of the best films i have seen in awhile.  Bruce Willis reminds us why he is one of the best action stars of all time(behind Charles Bronson).  Rosario Dawson shows she has true gritt.  The girl from Gilmore Girls keeps it real all the way to the end.  Duncan should have retired from acting after the Green mile.
B000002C1W|2.0|I am an avid Pink Floyd fan, but I have to say this is BY FAR Pink Floyd's worst album.  The most obvious reason this album is so weak compared to Floyd's other albums is that Roger Waters is not in the band anymore and the lyrics and music really suffer as a result.  Strangely enough, Richard Wright is not an \\"official\\" member of the band, though he makes an appearance as one of many session musicians.  Of course, there has been plenty of controversy over the legal battles between Waters and Gilmour, but David Gilmour deserves plenty of criticism for releasing this album under the Pink Floyd name, especially when one takes into account the minimal contributions of Richard Wright and Nick Mason to this album. Much of the drumming and percussion is actually electronic, and session drummers are playing most of the \\"real\\" drums.  Nick Mason apparently felt out of practice, so he wasn't up for playing much drums on this album.  Rather than Richard Wright, Jon Carin plays a lot of the keyboards, as well as Bob Ezrin and Gilmour himself.  The bass is played mostly by Tony Levin of King Crimson fame. All kinds of other session musicians are featured on this album as well.  Gilmour also had plenty of help from other songwriters outside Pink Floyd in writing this album.  For me, it's pretty easy to see, and hear - this isn't really Pink Floyd, folks!!!    Anyway, the best song on this disappointing album is \\"On The Turning Away.\\" This is a memorable song, and Gilmour does a very nice job on this one.  \\"Learning to Fly\\" is also quite entertaining and enjoyable to listen to.  \\"Sorrow\\" is adequate (the guitar intro is tasteful), but the lyrics are not up to par, especially in the context of Pink Floyd's larger body of work.  Aside from a few nice guitar licks here and there, the rest of the album is boring and lacks both direction and imagination.  I have always thought that this should have been a David Gilmour solo album, and it's pretty obvious that Gilmour was just cashingin by using the Pink Floyd name.  This album always leaves me feeling unsatisfied, and ex-Pink Floyd leader Roger Waters had every right to be unhappy about its release.
B000FIMHJ4|4.0|Awesome cd and a fantastic idea to re release it for the 20th anniversary with bonus tracks.'Livin For The Minute' is a great bonus song, they should've also included 'Face the hangman' and the cover of 'Rock n roll all night',despite being on other poison albums they were first recorded for Open up and say ahh.
B0002TX4QQ|3.0|On my own, I would never have chosen this book. The topic of school massacres, combined with the sensationalistic style of the cover, would most likely have resulted in my passing it by. But I have recently joined a book club and this book was the one up for discussion this month, so I made the purchase and dug in. I was immediately dismayed by the letter writing format the author chose to tell the story. Ugh! I realize it is my own personal bias, but I rarely think this format works to the author's advantage.(a recent exception is Lori Lansens' new novel, \\"The Girls\\") In Shriver's case, it forced much of his narrative into second person; always referring to \\"you\\" (Franklin, the husband,to whom the letters are addressed). I found this irritating to read, and nearly abandoned the book during the first 100 pages. It didn't take long to think I had figured out the ending--which I had--and I thought it was ridiculous to continue on for another 300 pages with this awkward format for such a cliche' dramatic ending. Nevertheless, the thought of the forthcoming book club discussion AND Shriver's overall excellent writing skills and humor (I LOVED Shriver's humor!!)kept me going through to the very end. <br />   Shriver is obviously an exceptionally skilled author and I would LOVE to read more of his work--providing he doesn't use a letter format! I'm very glad that I finished the novel and appreciated all of the messages that were conveyed to the  reader. And these messages went beyond the more obvious issue of school massacres and family/community responsibility. I do, however, maintain that it would have been a much more effective novel if it had been written in a different style...perhaps even in first person and using foreshadowing or time changes. Doing so may actually have resulted in a more surprising ending and allowed more believeability to the dialogue. (I couldn't get over the fact that these letters contained long expanses of dialogue that the letter writer,Eva, would never have remembered). So, do I recommend the book to others? Yes. And if you don't mind the letter writing format, I would recommend it with 4 stars. <br /> <br />
0060872675|1.0|This is not a children's book at all. The pictures could be upseting, there is not story behind it, the language is not what you want your kids to learn at an early age or ever! I have never read this author before, but I will certainly won't do it after this book. I am glad I did not buy it, my son picked it out at the library misled by the front picture.
B00000J2L8|5.0|I am an apocalypse junkie. I was in the Army Chemical corps in 1978. I read and enjoyed Hal Lindsey's LATE GREAT PLANET EARTH. This is really a very funny movie! I noticed that it had been produced in England. And I would have had a hard time imagining any studio in America back then permitting such an irreverent movie to be made in this country. Yet even Bonzo Headrest Reagan had seen this movie had asked where the War Room was after he was elected president. There was no \\"War Room\\" in real life.It reminds me of a famous anti nuclear poster in the 80's that could be interpreted as either insulting to Reagan or Breshnev!<br />I had seen the trailer where they said that Stanley Kubrick had read 50 books on the subject of nuclear war in preperation for this movie. I'll bet Hal Lindsey did not read that many books as background research for his bestseller THE LATE GREAT PLANET EARTH!<br />The Cold War paranoia stuff about the Soviets was hillarious! I remeber myself in 7th grade in 1972 that I would not sing WHEN I'M 64 by the Beattles because I myself thought rock music was some sort of communist conspiracy! Although it is true that they did not let rock music into Russia until after the Cold War, so said Van Halen or David Lee Roth! So, maybe there was something to this. But the things that they say about the Soviets is so ridiculous you know it is all just a farce!<br />Generally, I also believe that the end of all things is near as the Bible says. So, why not go out with a laugh?<br />And the thing about the wheelchair bound Nazi scientist is a real laugh to me. I had studied in German in college that the US Army had recruited a bunch of former Nazi missile scientists from Peenemunde. But that guy is a real nut job as many scientists in real life are! I had to laugh hard when he kept giving that raised arm Nazi Roman salute to the American President as though he was saluting Hitler-\\"Mein Fuhrer!\\" Maybe some of our presidents remind me of Hitler, too!<br />Dr. Strangelove had talked about hiding enough people in underground mines to wait out the nuclear armageddon to insure the survival with society. In TIME  magazine in 1992, I had read a story about Mt. Weather in West Virginia where the government has a bunker built under the mountain to shelter the President, Congress and Supreme Court in the event of a nuclear war. so, the people who will cause the nuclear war will be sitting pretty themselves!bout hiding enough people in underground mines to wait out the nuclear armageddon to insure the survival with society.

B000HBK3MM|5.0|Thoroughly enjoyed this CD---I would agree with the selection of \\"Put Your Records On\\" as its \\"play on the radio\\" choice. Great background for entertaining.
B00000J7RZ|5.0|I am one of J-lo's biggest fans, but the albums after this are one disappointment after the next.  Luckily she's redeemed herself more in talent with the most recent album release, but this very first one had the true latino influence before she started 'forgetting' which minority she was representing in order to get more bucks.  This CD expresses true singing talent, amazing tearful ballads (Marc Anthony, for crying out loud!!) and that wonderful feeling of sitting on an island beach.  Even the photos of J-lo were sexy inside.  This is truly art.
B000000WCX|5.0|This is techno/space/head-banging/emotional stuff all in one package.  For the people who have problems with all the Changes Bowie goes through, THAT's Bowie.  He is elastic and timeless.  His old stuff is still fresh, his new stuff metamorphasizes with him. <br />If you want the same old song and dance, listen to aerosmith. <br />(which i like, btw).
B000EQ4G5K|1.0|I don't understand why \\"Unfaithful\\" was chosen as the single.  She's just a dance act.  Pon De Replay and SOS were songs popular only because of the mixes and remixes.  When it came ballad time in \\"Unfaithful\\", she had a voice that squeals like a dying animal.  If this really happened, I feel sorry for the guy she was unfaithful to.
B0000584V3|5.0|Opeth are not Death Metal, well not really. They bare elements similar to some Death metal, i.e deep gutteral growls and heavy piercing guitars and double bass up the butt. But, unlike other Death Metal bands, Opeth doesn't suck! Most Death metal bands in the Death Metal genre play out the same cliche's and act and look the same and play the same boring style of music that its hard not to hate them. But Opeth, is a breath of fresh air in a stink filled room of stale and over played, tired music. Their style is so original that it is way beyond its time. Way beyond. Their fusion of Death Metal, Metal, acoustic folk and progressive rock far surpasses anything most bands on the radio can even attempt to think of doing. Mikael's lyrics are deep and poetic, if most times depressing, and his vocal range is WIDE! His gutteral growls are piercing and demonic and some of the best growling I have ever heard. Their ex-drummer(who played on this album), Martin Lopez, is one of the best drummers in the music biz, fusing Death Metal traditions with traditional Eastern beats and funky beats, something that is rarely heard in genres such as \\"Death Metal\\", and Metal(save for Danny Carey, and the drummer from SOAD(I don't know his name)). Each song on Blackwater Park is a sonic epic journey that takes you from intense to the very peak of beauty, and then back into the descent of madness and darkness. Their dynamics are so on point you will find yourself rewinding parts over and over again just to capture the true essence of a particular melody or section. The music is arranged so superbly that it could be seen as written classical sheet music, yea its that good! Instant classics that are heavy and rough as the best of them, yet silent and beautiful and melodic like no one else. Add in a jazzy influence and impeccable musicianship and you have a band that knows what they are doing and how to do it, all the while expanding their musical boundries and pushing the envelope. I highly recommend this album to music lovers, metal lovers, and those that love out of the ordinary music. I hated Death Metal before I heard of Opeth, but they have a way of changing ones view about things. And if you have already heard this beast, check out Damnation(70's prog rock by Opeth, it'll blow your mind), and Ghost Reveries(their bet album hands down).
B000007MVM|1.0|Sorry, never understood Syd, nor can I feel sorry for him.  His music was at best, a training bra for Pink Floyd.  No disrespect intended, except for being a founding member, he didn't count for much. <br />
B00006IU73|5.0|I first blew this album and this band off as another \\"European\\" band in the ocean of European bands that craft prog rock. I was way off! In Absentia is a musical, sonic journey into the mind unraveling and unknown. Instrumentation on this album is amazing and the lyrics are poetic and beautiful. There are so many heartfelt moments and wonderful melodies on this album, it rivals anything Porcupine Tree has done past and future. This is a must own for all music lovers, especially Prog rock or Porcupine Tree fans. Lots of weaving progressive jams and a litle touch of heavy, yet the overall tone of the album is sort of an acoustic and melancholy happiness, a blissful joyride into insanity. The cover explains it all. The mastermind behind Porcupine Tree, Steven Wilson, also had his hand in three of Opeth's most amazing albums(Blackwater Park, Deliverence and Damnation). Wilson has a knack for beautiful melodies and wonderful arrangements, a true genius, and this is his masters thesis. One of the best albums in the world. Highly recommended!
B0002VL0KQ|5.0|Perfect for putting the little one to sleep.  What a great voice!!
B0007XT87G|4.0|Dead Wing follows a more pragmatic and programmatic approach to the prog.rock genre than its predeccesor, In Absentia. In Absentia was very progressive but it featured very intricate guitar riffs and creative drum beats and wonderfully arranged pieces crafted by the master himself, Steven Wilson. In Absentia makes you feel something different and amazing. It is truly a must own album. Dead Wing feels much more like the older days of Procupine Tree. Rock, yet progressive. Somewhat dishelved and de-evolved from In Absentia. Its almost like they went backwards in evolution. I was awed by In Absentia, it is an amazing album. Dead Wing seems to drag on a little too much. Don't get me wrong, I really enjoyed it, and I am sure all of the Wilson fans are going to hate me for this review, but that's how I feel. Great instrumentation, but not on par with In Absentia. And there really shouldn't be any comparison, but the de-evolution is so appparant that it is hard not to notice. In typical prog rock fashion Porcupine Tree has crafted epic songs and wonderfully progressive pieces that twist and weave, and they are amazing. But, like their older albums, this album did not leave me in the awe state like In Absentia did.

B000E1ZBH2|5.0|I pretty much only buy DVD's for movies I can enjoy watching over and over and this is one of them.  Great acting, beautiful to watch, a wonderful romance.  I recommend it highly.
B00006D295|5.0|This classic DVD still captures the imagination, just as it did for a whole generation years ago. It's probably still playing in a movie house somewhere in the world!  The cast is  wonderful, each one bringing something unique to his/her role. Susan Sarandon and Barry Bostwick went on to bigger and better things, but it's Tim Curry's performance that totally steals the show!  Don't expect serious drama. Rather relax and enjoy well-done high camp, an absurd but charming storyline, and music that will repeat and repeat in your brain.  And don't forget the important message, don't dream it, BE IT!

0930289528|4.0|Alan Moore does a fantastic job making a world that you can immerse yourself in, which is why he is universally respected as a comic author.  <br /> <br />This graphic novel is a good buy even for people who have watched the film. This is only the third book/movie combination wherein the two are sufficiently different to be capable of being independently considered. The other two are Fight Club and The Club Dumas/The Ninth Gate. In all three cases, the book is a wonderful purchase. In two of the three cases, the movie should be purchased as well (do NOT buy The Ninth Gate. It is simply awful).  <br /> <br />As I said, this book is quite different from the movie adaptation. The reasons for this are unclear to me, but they are not really that important. In both cases V is fighting againt Norsefire (the totalitarian government of the United Kingdom) using the same tactics. In the book, though, Evey is a much less sure woman. She does not find herself in her predicament by breaking curfew to see a producer. Instead, she is trying to make ends meet through illegal prostitution. This in only one of many differences between the Evey characters, which is the most dramatic difference. In the book and the movie, there are two different characters, and they shape (and are shaped by) fundamentally different worlds.  <br /> <br />If you enjoyed the mbvie, pick this up. I think that you will like it. If you didn't enjoy the movie, pick this up. You might like it. If you hated the movie, well, why are you even looking at this? :)  <br /> <br />Buy it, read it, lend it to friends. But make sure to get it back. You will want to read it again. <br /> <br />Harkius
B000EQH2QK|5.0|This is my first album by Shakira, and personally, I loved it. She has a strong and hearty voice, and is good to listen to. I play it often. Her songs are thoughtful and catchy. I love Hips Don't Lie and How Do You Do the best of all, though all of the songs were wonderful, with great music accompiant.

B0009HLDFU|2.0|Good band, good songs, this review is for the product itself - the physical CD which is completely worthless.  Doesn't matter how good the music is if you can't listen to it.

In this case I can't rip the music so I can't listen to it with my existing hardware.
B00005JOML|3.0|In Michael Mann's \\"Miami Vice,\\" the tropical skies flash with lightning, but never burst with rain.  Why is that? The answer lies in the sensitive high definition camera technology - nicknamed the Viper - Mann and cinematographer Dion Beebe use to film the movie. What the Viper does - turning night backgrounds into Monet prints complete with purple/grey skies - and does not yet do - film well on the run, in the rain, in the supreme heat, for very long takes - is half of why \\"Miami Vice\\" becomes what it is: A series of artistic stills, one after another, injecting a kind of mesmerizing unease that you get after swimming in the sun too long or rousing from sleep fueled by cough dope - but it never really progresses into the kind of kinetics that its milieu - Drugs! Sex! Fast Stuff! - suggest. It simmers and froths and then just stretches on into the heavens - pointlessly, for in the end it's just some macho cop flick that, if it does its job, ought to buzz you. Not drill the kind of somnambulant tone you'd hear in a Japanese elevator into your head.  <br /> <br />And when the movie reaches this stasis 30 minutes in, after the story's been set, a joke's been told and you're attuned to the fuzzy-yet-pungent color scheme of the Viper, nothing in the production breaks free of it. Not the performances from Colin Farrell and Jamie Foxx as Sonny Crockett and Rico Tubbs. Not the tepid villains. Not the sex scenes. And certainly not Mann's script, his worst, which has no payoff and trades in a kind of nonsense cop code that uses the phrase \\"fabricated fundamentals\\" to describe \\"fake identities.\\" Everybody talks in smug, ridiculous platitudes with words like \\"OPSEC,\\" \\"AWAC,\\" \\"skillsets\\" and \\"go-fast boats.\\" That means, you know, speedboats. It is hard, considering they act like bemused aliens in civilian clothes, to much like or believe them. <br /> <br />\\"Miami Vice\\" opens in a club where the Crockett and Tubbs lead a team - Mann wordlessly introduces them - to bust, one wouldguess, a prostitution ring (although that too must be insinuated) when Crockett receives a call from an informant about a drug sting operation about to go bad. It eventually leads to an FBI chief (Ciaran Hinds) deputizing the team to find the leak that tipped off the white-supremacist suppliers. That means masquerading as a transport team for the Columbian drug lord Arcangel Jesus de Montoya (Luis Tosar), who is fronted by Cuban-American lawyer Isabella (Gong Li) and henchman Jose Yero (John Ortiz). Yero's a sporty, manic creep whose teeth would drip with food spit if Mann ordained it. Isabella is a total fiction - borderline incoherent in both Spanish and English - created so Mann could help foreign box office with a Chinese movie star. <br /> <br />Crockett and Isabella fall quickly and deeply in love for reasons unexplained -considering that Gong Li is difficult to understand half the time, it can't be the witty banter - while Tubbs is essentially separated from his cop girlfriend (Naomie Harris) until she's kidnapped later in the picture. The plot lurches toward a static shootout in a boatyard that essentially consists of Mann stationing a camera behind an actor shooting his semiautomatic machine gun at an indiscernible enemy. At its end we cast our eyes back at what started this plot in motion - a leak - are unable, as far as I could tell, to decide who, if anyone, that was. A small hope for this picture was that it would shame Michael Bay's \\"Bad Boys\\" pictures with its artistic expertise and capture of cool. While \\"Miami Vice\\" is not the vile thing those pictures are, it does not deliver.  <br /> <br />The acting choices that Foxx and Farrell, two excellent, demonstrative performers, make here are a shock: They're dull, flat and terse. Mann must've shot Farrell, who has a not a little Mel Gibson in him, with horse tranquilizers. Mann needs great stars who know, to quote the movie, their skillsets - Daniel Day Lewis, Russell Crowe, Tom Cruise and Al Pacino  -to drown the director's urge to stand quietly apart from it all and dispassionately observe. He sunk the uninspiring \\"Ali\\" with that drive, and though this movie is much lovelier to look at, he sinks it too.   <br /> <br />Mann shoots all over the Western Hemisphere - Uruguay, the Dominican Republic, the spectacular waterfalls of the Amazon - but, aside from the admittedly jaw-dropping helicopter shots, he doesn't use the locales to any great effect and in fact spends what must have been millions of dollars to simply prove he \\"went\\" there, indulging in a kind of idiotic hubris that once sunk the great 1970s directors. In an era where dollars genuinely count, it begins to make sense to ask: To what did the x amount of money used to create this creature go? \\"Miami Vice\\" cost $125 million to make. Any single entry in the \\"Lord of the Rings\\" trilogy costs less. Does that tell you something? <br /> <br />And, my goodness, he wants to make a sequel.   <br />
B00005JOIH|5.0|Steven Spielberg scores again.  One might initially look at this film as an advocacy for revenge.  It isn't.<br /><br />The story takes place after \\"Black September\\" in which Israeli hostages were killed during the Munich Olympic games.  It is about an elite team of Israeli assassins who are charged with finding the masterminds behind Black September and eliminating them.  It is a story about revenge.<br /><br />Eric Bana delivers a powerful performance as Avner, an Israeli man who appears to be enjoying the life he is living with his young wife who is pregnant with their child.  Avner is recruited and asked to perform a difficult task for the sake of the country of Israel.<br /><br />Ephraim (Geoffrey Rush) is the Israeli who is in charge of making sure that Avner is able to carry out his duty as well as providing him with four other men as well as unlimited funds to acquire the necessary intelligence concerning the whereabouts of the men they're supposed to kill.<br /><br />Avner finds, initially, that the first couple of targets are difficult to carry out for him, especially emotionally.  He all but panics when he realizes that the young daughter of one of his targets has gone back inside the apartment (since they've agreed not to kill civilians).<br /><br />At first it seems that Avner and his team are having no trouble finding and eliminating their targets thanks to the help of Louis (Mathieu Almaric) and his father (Michael Lonsdale).  But then, one of the members of his own team is found dead in the bed of a woman who has obviously been hired to kill him.  Avner quickly realizes that the hunters have quickly become the hunted.  One by one members of his team are killed.  At first this compells him to kill those responsible as well as the men responsible for Black Sunday.<br /><br />Avner soon reaches a state of paranoia and distrust.  He doesn't know if Louis and his father have sold him out.  He doesn't know if the Israeli government may be behind it as well.  He soon finds himself sleeping the closet of his hotel room and longing to return to his wife and daughter who are living in New York.<br /><br />Avner concludes that the killing can never stop.  He finally understands that he, himself, will never be rid of the fear that he might be killed some day as well.  He realizes that vengeance only begets more vengeance.  Ephraim all but acknowledges this, even though he tries to reassure Avner of the \\"great work\\" he's done for his country.  Avner can no longer view it in these terms, as he doesn't even feel it is safe to return to Israel.<br /><br />One of the most compelling shots in this film is at the very end.  As I stated earlier, this film is about the dangers and sickness of \\"vengeance.\\"  Spielberg ends the film with a shot of the two towers of the World Trade Center.  In his own way, he is stating that no amount of vengeance is justifiable.  Because, where does it end?  Avner realizes that for every person he's killed, more have risen to take their places.  In his heart, he understands that it causes only pain, and mostly to himself.<br /><br />Munich is a powerful, important film, which says a lot about the world we live in...because it doesn't have to be that way.behind it as well.

0440241588|2.0|The Broker by John Grisham - if the cover is to be believed - was once a New York times bestseller which boggles me completely since this was such a bad novel. But taking a step back I see how it is easy to mistake this book for an intense thriller. One: the piece in question is written by John Grisham a widely acclaimed writer. Two: the plot summary makes the book sound like the perfect spy thriller. <br /> <br />The main character Joel Backman has just been granted a last minute pardon from the president and the CIA whisks him off to Italy. Why? Because before he was arrested Backman was the most powerful lobbyist in Washington and during his career he compromised the world's most advanced satellite system. This led to his subsequent arrest; his jail time working as both punishment and protection. Protection from some angry people not only in the US but also in other countries. Now the CIA intends to keep Backman in Italy, leak his whereabouts to several foreign governments, and see who gets him, hopefully answering some of their own questions about the satellites. <br /> <br />Sound ominus and exciting? That's exactly what I thought when I first bought it. But boy was I wrong. The plotline has as much bang as a wet firecracker. It is also frequently illogical and un-realistic. Grisham, known for his lawyer stories, warns readers that espionage novels are not his speciality. The only problem is he tells us this in the afterword. If only he warned me in the introduction!!! <br /> <br />Two moderately good things come out of this mess. One is the  main character. Even though he glosses over physical appearance, he makes Backman a very charismatic character. Witty and intelligent I began to like him despite his slimy background as a lobbyist. I also give Grisham props for his research of Bologna, Italy the main setting for the story. History, landmarks, streetnames, he knew it all. Besides Backman and Bologna though Grisham fails miserably to bring anything else to life. <br /> <br /> <br />My Verdict: Don't under any circumstances buy this book unless your a hardcore collector of Grisham books. Or maybe you want a narrative guide of Bologna, Italy.

B000E1MXSW|5.0|Seen again for the first time in a couple of decades, Warner's beautifully restored DVD of The Nun's Story is a real surprise, avoiding the mawkish sentimentality that usually accompanied old Hollywood's approach to Catholicism with a sober, quiet unostentatious majesty and a mostly successful attempt to avoid cliché (there's no romance with Peter Finch's surgeon as you might expect). Fred Zinnemann, who now seems on the verge of being completely forgotten, constantly does things slightly differently - not just jump cutting from continent to continent, but avoiding convention in subtle ways. When Sister Luke departs for the Congo, not only is her departure handled in the bare minimum of shots but they're also not the ones you usually expect: no head on shots of the ship leaving for the open sea, but instead zooming out from a sideways view before cutting to the ship's wake. The visual economy never feels Spartan, but at the same time it fits the subject matter perfectly.  <br /> <br />Audrey Hepburn too is something of a revelation. Too often an irritatingly kooky pixie clotheshorse, here she abandons many of her usual affectations that you either find charming or maddening to give the kind of sincere and grounded performance that was too rarely asked of her. It's a quietly powerful and surprisingly honest film that stands up to the test of time. Shame that for some reason Zinnemann gets Dean Jagger to voice one of the bit players as well, which briefly takes you out of the movie before a sudden act of unexpected violence shocks you back in, but there's little else to fault in it. <br /> <br />The only extra on the DVD is the original trailer.
B000EQ4G5K|5.0|Wow, I knew this album would be good. After the disappointing chart performance of her debut album, \\"Music Of The Sun\\", Rihanna has already come out with this mind-blowing sophomore effort, \\"A Girl Like Me\\", 8 months later. Whether or not this was a rushed effort, it's still amazing how an 18-year-old 1-smash-hit-wonder can display so much unbelievable artistic growth in a matter of months. Whereas her decent debut album set her apart from the growing female R&B pack with smooth, Caribbean-inflected R&B/Pop, \\"A Girl Like Me\\" has Rihanna broadening her horizons by exploring all kinds of genres. <br /> <br />A perfect example of this is \\"Kisses Don't Lie\\", which effervescently melds Rock & Reggae for an exciting listening experience. On the aforementioned cut, Rihanna sings about her unsureness of a relationship & how a kiss will tell the truth apart from the lies of the world. \\"Kisses Don't Lie\\" truly is a well-written song. #1 smash hit club rocker \\"S.O.S. (Rescue)\\" also takes a sample from Soft Cell's classic \\"Tainted Love\\" (which everyone should know by now), resulting in another vibrant, Rock-inflected highlight. The lyrics to \\"S.O.S.\\" aren't that creative, but it's a club banger...what do you expect? <br />Another club banger not to be missed is the addictive Rihanna/Sean Paul collaboration \\"Break It Off\\", which was originally meant for Sean Paul's sophomore effort, \\"The Trinity\\". Despite the fact that Sean Paul's voice fills up most of the track, Rihanna still manages to keep up with the Dancehall superstar with seductive vocals over an infectious beat. <br /> <br />However, Rihanna is more than your typical club-going seductress, as displayed in many of her gorgeous ballads. Penned by label mate Ne-Yo, the emotionally charged piano/violin ballad, \\"Unfaithful\\", shockingly puts Rihanna in the perspective of a woman wrapped up in her own heartbreaking guilt through emotional vocals, as well as touching lyrics & quirky metaphors (\\"I don't wanna be a murderer\\") about her two-timing ways. There's plenty more room for confessional heartbreak on songs like the reminiscent slow jam \\"We Ride\\" (which also makes for a relaxing summer tune, especially when you're taking a drive), & the dramatic, saddening ballads \\"Final Goodbye\\", \\"A Million Miles Away\\" & \\"P.S. (I'm Still Not Over You)\\", all of which hold almost just as much lyrical brilliance & smooth production as \\"Unfaithful\\". <br /> <br />If you're still waiting for a lacklustre track to spit, s**t & p**s on, don't hold your breath. Rihanna still takes time to croon the truth alongside singer Dwane Husbands on \\"Dem Haters\\", an obvious anti-haters tracks complete with top-notch lyrics & catchy guitar riffs. Some of the lyrics in the laid-back, balladic, contemplative, guitar-driven title track could easily be confused as hidden stabs at your typical, average female (\\"Some girls play the game / They all walk & talk & dress the same / Nothing new to say / Don't they realize, that it's so easy to see through their disguise/ Makes me wonder why), but it's still another great ballad to include in her lengthy selection. The obsessive \\"Selfish Girl\\" & the catchy dreaminess of \\"Crazy Little Thing Called Love\\" also give her a chance to keep herself close to her Caribbean roots (as shown through the beats), while also providing more balladic magic. The way she shows her Caribbean heritage in her music is what kept me hooked to her in the first place. <br /> <br />The bonus remix of \\"If It's Lovin' That U Want (feat. Corey Gunz)\\" isn't as great as the original, but it's clearly marked bonus for a reason. Rihanna has delivered an incredibly solid sophomore effort which has more consistency than Beyonce's \\"Dangerously In Love\\" (even if it follows the same template), more variety than Christina Milian's \\"So Amazin'\\" (damn, it hurts me to say that so much) & a less explicit, but equally convincing realness than Teairra Mari's debut. As much as I hate Jay-Z for mismanaging Teaiira Mari & droppingChristina Milian, you can't deny that he really knew what he was doing when Rihanna & everyone else made this album. 5 stars, easily! BUY IT! <br /> <br />5 Best Tracks: <br />\\"Kisses Don't Lie\\" <br />\\"Unfaithful\\" <br />\\"S.O.S. (Rescue Me)\\" <br />\\"We Ride\\" <br />\\"Break It Off (feat. Sean Paul)\\"  <br />

6303942830|4.0|Note - I recently saw the original version of \\"Mohicans\\" released on VHS in the 90s.  This is not a review of the expanded or widescreen editions, nor the DVD version.<br /><br />The film itself was very good.  Cinematography was excellent, acting was fine.  The plot/storyline varied somewhat from the original tale as written by James Fenimore Cooper; however, the film was done well enough so that I didn't mind too much.  The essence of the novel was still very much intact.  Director Mann did a great job with this one.<br /><br />Four stars!
B000EHRVP6|1.0|The idea for the movie was good, something slightly different from the norm.  Other than the main idea, this movie was just plain horrible.  It wasn't the blood, guts or violence, the movie had no point to it at all and the plot was insanely stupid.  You hate to see a good horror movie idea go to waste, but this movie is just not worth watching.

B00003CXMG|5.0|Almost Famous is my favorite movie of all time and Cameron Crowe is my all time favorite writer/director. This movie is by far one of his best films yet. <br /> <br />Set in 1973, Almost Famous tells the story of 15-year-old William Miller (Patrick Fugit), who's dream is to become a great rock journalist while his overprotective mother strives for her son to go to law school. After writing some pieces for local magazines, the editor of Rolling Stone magazine contacts William (not knowing that he is only 15) and sets him up to go on tour with the up and coming band Stillwater. While on tour, William falls for a \\"Band-Aid\\" named Penny Lane (Kate Hudson). He becomes torn between wanting to belong with his new rock star friends and his wanting to be a \\"honest and unmerciful\\" rock journalist. <br /> <br />Almost Famous is an adaptation of Cameron Crowe's real life. He was William Miller. Cameron Crowe actually did write for Rolling stone when he was in high school and really did tour with all kinds of rock stars (i.e.- Led Zepplin and the Allman Brothers). He even reveals in the commentary (which unfortunately is only located on the directors special two-disc edition) that there was a girl he knew while on tour who went by the name Penny Lane. The character of Penny Lane was derived from many girls who went on tour with the bands simply because they loved their music.  <br /> <br />Amazing movie, amazing performances by the actors, amazing music. Do yourself a favor and buy this movie! <br /> <br /> <br />I also recommend Say Anything, my second favorite movie (also written/directed by Cameron Crowe).

B00000099Y|5.0|I've been a tool fan since right day Aenima came out.  I was like 8 at the time and i stole the cd from my dad.  Since then Maynard has been my idol ever since, with his warped in-depth lyrics, the solid rythum in EVERY song, and obscure artsy aura that surrounds maynard.  I can't say aenima is my favorite tool album, but only because i love every album, every song just as much as the next one.  Tool is my all-time favorite band.  But i'm also not some stupid kid who says \\"I love tool so you should love tool\\".  But i will say \\"You like metal, but you dont like tool.  Give me one good reason why not.\\"  Every one has their right to like differnt music, but if you honestly call youself a head-banger you have to at least respect tool for what they are.
B00000JR2A|5.0|Tears For Fears' grand masterpiece.  A rare case when over-producing works.  Every song is an amazingly crafted piece of pop music.  \\"Sowing The Seeds of Love\\" is the upbeat classic that most will recognize from this record.  But there are other songs here that are downright haunting and introspective, like \\"Standing On The Corner Of The Third World\\" & \\"Famous Last Words\\"  Didn't get nearly the credit it deserved when it was released in 1989.  It took 4 years to make this record which seems like a long time but the results are near-perfection.  Proves that taking your time pays great dividends.
B000FA57RG|5.0|This may not be Truth or Dare...but This is not the same Madonna.  Through the years we have witnessed a transformation within Madonna both spiritually and emotionally.  In Secret, we see that Madonna hasn't lost her sense of humor or candor but mellowed with age.  This is a great insight who she has become and also what fame has taught her.  I recommend this film not because of my love for the woman but for how it depicts life and how religion and belief may enhance it.

B00005JOML|5.0|Maybe people watched the trailers expecting fast cars, fast women, and your standard roller coaster ride.  That's definitely not what this is.  Rather, it's a dark journey into the underworld of undercover narcotics where everything is transient.  Everything in this world is temporary: love and friendship never achieve any meaningful level, because the object of your affection could end up dead or simply dissappear to another country.  <br /> <br />There's a line in the film where Farrell's character says to his lover, that their relationship \\"has no future.\\"  That's pretty much the case with everything in the world of Tubbs and Crockett.    <br /> <br />  Some reviewers complain that Fox and Farrel lack chemistry, but that's not true.  The characters they play are disconnected from one another because they live in a world where no connections are possible. Again, nothing in their world has any future.     <br /> <br />Their only meaningful connection is to the case they are trying to solve. Fox and Farell are the end product of under cover police work in Miami Florida, a career that ultimately leaves a person jaded and  nearly souless.   Tubbs and Crockett are two characters bearing the scars of years of undercover police work: they are sullen, withdrawn, and battle hardened.   <br /> <br />This is more depth than you'd expect from a \\"cop movie,\\" but man it's great.

Well, hate to tell you folks, but if you're going to subscribe to that school of thought, you actually have to say that Syd Barrett is Pink Floyd. All the bulls**t aside, this is a really good record. \\"Learning to Fly\\" and \\"On the Turning Away\\" are as good as anything Floyd has ever released. There are realy beautiful melodies all over this album and as always, Gilmour's guitar playing is excellent. Maybe some of the Floyd snobs should come down off their high horses and acutally listen with their ears instead of their short sightedness.
B00000K3UU|5.0|Honestly this is one of my favorite Adam Sandler movies. I honestly don't know why. There are just so many hilarious things in this movie. My favorite are Steve Buscemi and Rob Schneiders characters, especially when they are arguing in the court room. If you like Adam Sandler, then you should get this movie. I highly recommend it!
0618526412|2.0|I love to read as much as any other bookworm, and normally I force myself to go all the way to the end. This was one of those books I had to put down. And being that it's deemed 'classic' and 'brilliant' made me feel somewhat dumb at first when I dropped it, but after I thought about it, I don't think that putting it down was a 'dumb' thing to do. It was so boring, I'd rather watch bread mold. Nothing happened, the characters were bland, and I found myself looking at the page numbers, making sure I read my twenty pages a night before bed. After putting this down, I cleansed my palette with Margaret Atwood (also brilliant, but with good, interesting storylines and characters). I don't think I'll be picking up another McCullers book. Who cares if a twenty-three year old wrote it? Does it make it 'genius'? Christopher Paolini wrote Eragon at fifteen, and that was [...], yet he's also being lauded as a 'wunderkid', but that's a story for another day. This book would have been genius if it had a point, but I didn't think it did.
630529142X|5.0|This movie is top-notch hilarity, this is a must-own for Sandler fans or slapstick comedy fans. This movie is a classic in many ways and has a lot of firsts for later Sandler movies(like Rob Schnieder). A great movie, has almost non-stop laughs, I recommend it!
B000EXZ9P4|5.0|This CD is sublime, subtle, mature and sentimental. It's about love, growing older and the bittersweet of it all. It is masterful in the depths of poignancy it achieves through lyrical simplicity, as in the rockin' \\"This Is Us.\\" It is playful in its passion: \\"Red Staggerwing\\" and \\"Belle Starr\\" and zen-like in questioning the value of the path one takes in life: \\"All The Roadrunning\\" and \\"Donkeytown.\\" And there are the plain ol' fashioned, beautifully crafted, heart-tugging journeyman love songs like \\"I Dug Up a Diamond\\" and \\"Beyond My Wildest Dreams\\", as smooth and rich as velvet tapestries.     This is a recording that people will grow into, not grow out of.     The craftsmanship here is so humble yet so perfect the undiscerning or the impatient may overlook its richness, while others come back again and again, reaping the jewels.     There is cohesiveness that distinguishes this CD as a solid piece of enduring, wrought-iron art by two stellar musicians and not a strategic collection of  of songs lashed together with a quickly fading silk ribbon marketing ploy called \\"duet\\".   The chemistry between Knopfler and Harris--again more subtlety, more understatement--is powerful and authentic, clearly grounded in something strong, something real, something of the earth, something that resonates mutual respect and the bittersweet of heartfelt emotions, hinting at feelings even deeper and more tender witheld from these tracks.     Artistic integrity has been a hallmark of the careers of both Knopfler and Harris. They are artists, not acts, and they are certainly masterful, journeymen musicians and this recording demonstrates this from beginning to end. It is tasteful, it is beautiful, it has its brights and darks and in-betweens and it bears repeated listens.     It also, admittedly leaves one wanting more, like a glittering Maseratti driving around city streets, prudently restrained, but rumbling with all the components, all the refinements and power begging to be let loose in wild abandon. This CD hints at even greater things bulging beneath the hood. And that's the way it is with most, if not all, great art.     I will consider this a classic.
0553804677|5.0|Scott Lynch's very first novel THE LIES OF LOCKE LAMORA is one of the finest debuts to come along in a long, long time. It is a great read that puts back the joy in reading, but at the same time it is not without ambition. Unlike Hollywood blockbusters it is not only entertaining, but has some brains as well. <br />If you read one book this summer just for fun, for sheer joy of storytelling, please read THE LIES OF LOCKE LAMORA. You'll love it.
B000005HFH|5.0|Over years of listening to jazz, this is the album I most often return to. It has absolutely everything: great songs (some of the greatest). A spectacular voice unlike Frank's or Ella's or Sarah's or anyone's--a voice that's all things to all people. (Whatever you want to hear in Baker's voice--depth, surface, warmth, detachment, male, female, and just about any other pairing of opposites--is right there for the taking.) You get ballads and lilting uptempos. Accessibility (this is not music to struggle to enjoy.) Innocence and experience. Summer-afternoon arrangements to float you away. A brilliant trumpet soloist (who was, however unlikely, the same guy as the amazing vocalist). Melody and improvisation.... If I were introducing a newbie to jazz, this is the album I'd start with. Then, after you listen to a thousand others, play Chet singing again and realize: this one tops them all. How did Baker do it? He probably shouldn't have been able to, given the way he lived--and that too feels like a piece of this recording's pleasure.
B000EQ4G5K|5.0|I can't stop listening to this cd, it's too good!  I've heard this twice so far, and i think i'm gonna listen to it again later on.  \\"SOS\\" starts this album off with a funky beat.  Apparently the backbeat is the same as Soft Cell's \\"Tainted Love\\".  You know if i didnt read a review saying that, i wouldnt have known.  Yes, i agree with this other reviewer, this album lacks more songs like SOS.  Also includes a lot of ballads (slow songs).  I recommend getting this album if you love Rihanna and enjoy her music.
0596007124|4.0|The cover art is a turn off, and the style of the book is a litle childish, but get past this and it explains design patterns in with simple clarity.  The GangOfFour book may have collected these patterns originally, but this book sets the gold standard so far on explaining them.

B000002UAO|5.0|Hello!  To all those people who are complaining how this isn't the original, may I remind you this IS the original!  Capitol is the one who  tore the Beatles albums apart in the 60's. The American version is not the way the Beatles and George Martin envisioned this album.  I will admit getting the cd was a little strange because it was different, but at least I realized that this was the original.  Great, great album!
6305268177|5.0|I remember seeing this show on TV when first performed. I was impressed then, I'm still impressed now. Naturally, a person's voice will lower in register with age, so it should come as no surprise that Barry and the Brothers Gibb don't go sky-high in their harmonies as they used to. That said, they still have a three part harmony that's just beautiful and unique in all of pop music. Their unique vocal harmony and chemistry are front and center here,as they go through four decades of song, both their own hits and songs written for others. This show was performed and taped at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas, and the crowd seems a bit dressed up for a concert, but I guess they were dressed for a night out. The sound quality on this disc is fine, but I had to turn the volume higher for this show than on other concert discs I have, so perhaps a move up to DTS wouldn't be a bad idea. The picture quality is fine and razer-sharp. I don't think they left any song in their catalogue out, even having Andy Gibb, sadly departed, \\"Guest\\" in a beautiful quartet,\\"Don't Throw It All Away\\". Celine Dion appears as well, in \\"Immortality\\", and they sound so GOOD together one wonders why they haven't done more together since. Of course, all the \\"Saturday Night Fever\\" songs are here, and they are wonderful. All in all, this is a fantastic show, very straight-forward, with no gimics or flashy stage show to distract form the incredible three-part singing that is the hallmark of the BeeGees.
B000FVQYYK|5.0|I've never written a review here before, but after seeing this album getting only 4 stars overall, I had to pitch in. <br /> <br />I've been too busy to keep up with music over the past 6 years or so (yup, that means I'm too busy!), but this album has forced me to rock again.  Every song is a winner -- listening to this album makes me feel like I did when Siamese Dream came out.  It's an ethereal, engergizing feeling, and I don't know where it comes from, but Muse does it for me.
B000G73U5Y|4.0|Let's see, we've had Greatest Hits (available as an import) which was a stopgap between Aja and Gaucho; Decade (which roughly picked two tracks per LP and had some questionable choices); Gold; Citizen Steely Dan (a great way to get all the studio tracks with great sound to boot); Showbiz Kids ( a great 2-Cd anthology) and now Definitive. <br /> <br />What we have is pretty much Decade with some track re-shuffling: East St Louis Toodle-oo is dropped (wise move), it is replaced by Dirty Work, and one track from the two CDs that were released in the 2000's are tacked on the end.  <br /> <br />However, instead of picking all the top 40 tracks (Josie, Time Out of Mind) we get album tracks such as Dirty Work. <br /> <br />For me as a single disc Steely Dan comp, Then and Now (with the Carhenge cover is your best bet (of course FM on that, Gold, the box set, and Show Biz Kids features the sax outro, not the guitar outro as on here and Decade.

B00003CXCT|5.0|If you are a Star Wars fan and you do not have this DVD set in your collection this is a must have!  It is better than the VHS tape set of the re-mastered Star Wars Trilogy Episodes 4-6.  You won't be disappointed with this addition to your collection! <br /> <br />Jeb P.

0321334876|4.0|This book, and its vol2 (More effective C++) is a must have for any intermediate level C++ practitioner. <br /> <br />Unfortunately, the new material comes across as muddled, perhaps because C++ is now so complex that maybe even Dr Meyers doesn't quite get it? Who knowns. <br /> <br />Whatever the reason, this volume is markedly more muddled and therefore less impactful than its previous editions. But it is still an essential tome, hence the 4 stars. <br /> <br />
B000003TAR|5.0|\\"Now I'm bored and old\\".....That line as I'm sure you all know comes from the track \\"Serve The Servants\\" the lead off track to Nirvana's final album the amazing \\"In Utero\\". (I know \\"Unplugged in New York\\" came after but all the material was released already and I don't consider it an official album. It's still awesome though).  Not only does this record trump \\"Nevermind\\" (which a lot of people disagree with) but is Nirvana's defining statement and one of the top albums of the 90's.    I heard the first single \\"Heart Shaped Box\\" when it debuted on MTV (remember when MTV was actually awesome??). I immediately thought it was terrific. I was only 10 when \\"In Utero\\" was released and did not get it immediately. I finally bought it when I was in high school because that's when my cd collection began to take shape. I bought it, listened to it and did not like it. I only liked \\"Heart Shaped Box\\". Call it being young and dumb because when I went to college my roomate knew I was a huge fan of music of all types and demanded I listen to it again. It was one of the best things I ever did.    \\"In Utero\\" from top to bottom is immaculate. The beautiful thing about music is that everyone hears something different and it affects people in completely different ways. One critic wrote that the way he hears \\"In Utero\\" is of a suicide note. I don't agree with that. This is a darker record than \\"Nevermind\\"....\\"Nevermind\\" was a very shiny, clean punk record. Not this record though. \\"In Utero\\" is dark and unrelenting. Steve Albini (producer) did a great job with the band's sound. Compare Dave Grohl's drums on this record to that of \\"Nevermind\\". I prefer Dave as a drummer then a guitarist/singer. The drums are postively thunderous on this record. Kurt's guitar sounds great and Chris (Krist) blends in perfectly. This record never made me sad. I was sad when Kurt died but listening to \\"In Utero\\" makes me smile just for the amazing music of this amazing era. This IS rock music.    The music though....The songs are utterly amazing. This is Kurt's album. This is Kurt baring his soul on most of the tracks. I say most because songs like \\"Milk It\\" and \\"Tourette's\\" I believe was Kurt having fun. He chuckles in \\"Milk It\\" and \\"Tourette's\\" is him flippin' out for crying out loud!! Aside from those though....he is doin' his thing. Cobain made the opposite of \\"Nevermind\\", a huge hit in its own right and made a better record in the process. How many bands would have the foresight to try and do the opposite to something that made them successful and yet still be accepted??    To me, this album holds together the best of those in Nirvana's catalogue. Tracks such as the aforementioned \\"Serve The Servants\\", \\"Frances Farmer Will Have Her Revenge On Seattle\\" and \\"Dumb\\" are some of the best songs Kurt ever wrote. The most popular songs are \\"Pennyroyal Tea\\", \\"All Apologies\\" along with the single \\"Heart Shaped Box\\". Taken all together this record is just plain sick 13 years later. To me, Nirvana was successful because they were the first Punk rock band to break thorough to a mainstream audience in America. Sure, there were a TON of Punk bands before Nirvana. A lot of great Punk bands (The Clash, Sex Pistols, The Ramones, Dead Kennedys, Husker DU to name a few) but they were all underground. Not saying they did not make great music but Nirvana was the first to have serious mainstream success. Think about it....Was \\"Nevermind\\" more important?? Sure. \\"In Utero\\" was their best though....    One other thing....For all of us that rememeber this music and the other bands of this era....I believe we were spoiled. The bands that were commerical artists at this time were awesome. Rage, Tool, Pearl Jam, Alice In Chains, Smashing Pumpkins, Soundgarden, Jane's Addiction....all made great records. Commerical rock today just is not as good. Go back and listen to these records. These bands rocked and seemed to care about their music. Kurt Cobain was the man....and this record was the greateststatement of his vision. If you don't have \\"In Utero\\" pick it up and listen to all of it. You will not regret it. R.I.P. Kurt....the music will live always.
B00000K3UU|5.0|Big Daddy is about a guy named Sonny (Adam Sandler) who adopts a 5 year old kid (Julian) under the name of his room-mate, Kevin Garrety (Jon Stewart) to impress his girlfriend Vanessa (Kristy Swanson). He finds out his girlfriend is dating an older guy and Sonny is dumped and left with the kid. Sonny decides he can take care of him until Social Services can find an foster home for him, but Sonny falls in love with the kid and avoids Social Services. Then Social Services finds out Sonny was using Kevin's name and they take the kid away. Sonny tries to fight for him, but unable to get him and custody goes to the real Kevin who is in China for most of the movie. Juilan wants Sonny to be his dad, but Sonny says he can't, but he can always be his friend. So the movie ends at a happy note. <br />During the movie you'll have some laughs, giiggles and some tear jerking scenes. The funniest part of the movie is the court room scene, with Nazo, Mr. Hurley and the Bum. I almost cried when Social Services takes Julien away. <br />Overall great story-line. By far the best comedy and great story to a movie. <br />Rating: 10/10
B0002OERI0|5.0|I respect people's opinions on how Green Day has become more pop, but oh well! Music is music. If it's good, then you just listen to it. Who cares if these songs continue to be on MTV or other shows for teens. Who cares if it has a little pop to it? Rock is rock. Pop is pop. Period. Music is music. <br />You can't just say Green Day is the worst band ever just because you don't like the kind of music that they put out.
B000FIMG68|5.0|LOST Season Two Review <br />I'll review each episode and give the season an overall season rating. <br /> <br />Man of Science, Man of Faith <br />The Good: We find out what's inside the hatch with the great opening segment. Shannon sees Walt; the guy that is in the hatch is the guy in Jack's flashback that was running the stairs with him. <br />The Bad: The flashbacks were a little long; there wasn't anything about Michael, Jin, and Sawyer and the raft. <br />Rating: 9.5/10 <br /> <br />Adrift <br />The Good: It finally focuses on the raft survivors; Michael, Sawyer, and Jin (at the end). We find out what happened to Locke and Kate inside the hatch, really short flashbacks, and a great cliffhanger. <br />The Bad: Michael's flashbacks were kind of boring and it left off at the same place as in MOSMOF. <br />Rating 9.4/10 <br /> <br />Orientation <br />The Good: We find the purpose of the hatch, Michael, Sawyer, and Jin are thrown into a pit and Ana Lucia comes in, and I love Hurley's reaction when he sees the food. <br />The Bad: Locke's flashbacks weren't all that great. <br />Rating: 9.7/10 <br /> <br />Everybody Hates Hugo <br />The Good: We find out that the people who threw Michael, Sawyer and Jin into the pit are the tail section survivors. Hurley finds a solution to the food, and his flashbacks were interesting. I like the Sayid and Jack under the hatch scene and Jack seeing Kate coming out the shower. <br />The Bad: Some slow parts and there wasn't much of a cliffhanger.Rating: 9.3/10 <br /> <br />...And Found <br />The Good: The tailies are going to bring the rafties back to their camp. Jin and Eko see the others. All the tailies stuff was good. <br />The Bad: STUPID plot with sun's wedding ring, CRAPPY flashbacks with Sun/Jin, it seemed that when the episode ended, we ALMOST started off it the same point from the episodes beginning, and it was truly a \\"filler\\" episode. <br />Rating: 8.8/10 <br /> <br />Abandoned <br />The Good: Mind Blowing Cliffhanger, Sawyer's wound becomes more fatal, and Shannon is shot. Hooray! <br />The Bad: BORING flashbacks about Shannon. <br />Rating: 9.2/10 <br /> <br />The Other 48 Days <br />The Good: Everything about the tailies was pretty neat. I like the twist of Goodwin being the other and the radio scene. <br />The Bad: It didn't advance the story from Abandoned. <br />Rating: 9.5/10 <br /> <br />Collision <br />The Good: I like the whole Sayid captive stuff and the scene were the camps reunite. <br />The Bad: The writers dragged the episode a little bit. I didn't like the flashbacks. <br />Rating: 9.4/10 <br /> <br />What Kate Did <br />The Good: We find out what Kate did, we see the other part of the orientation film and the scene with Michael and the computer. And for you Jaters, the Kiss <br />The Bad: The flashbacks were kind of boring like always and I hate Kate episodes. <br />Rating: 9.2/10 <br /> <br />23rd Psalm <br />The Good: We find out the connection with Eko and the drug plane, Eko's encounter with the smoke and Michael's conversation with the computer. <br />The Bad: The story didn't progressed that much. <br />Rating: 9.4/10 <br /> <br />The Hunting Party <br />The Good: Michael taking off and Jack and others going after him and the scene with Mr. Friendly. <br />The Bad: Jack's flashbacks were boring and the whole episode was showing Jack, Sawyer and Locke hiking. <br />Rating: 9.1/10 <br /> <br />Fire+Water <br />The Good: Ummm...Charlie's flashbacks were kind of good. I like hearing the Kinks in the background and Charlie's new song was good, but when the flashbacks are better than the island story, it means the episode SUCKS with the exception of the on-island flashbacks like Maturity Leave and Three Minutes. <br />The Bad: EVERYTHING ON THE ISLAND was a complete waste. It was so bad, it can't be called a filler episode. Heck, I wouldn't mind if they deleted on the DVD when it comes out. My suggestion: never watch it, skip it, and for the writers, NEVER make anepisode like that again! <br />Rating: 8.0/10 <br /> <br />The Long Con <br />The Good: The only thing that I liked was that it was interesting....umm...never mind that. I just didn't like sawyer conning the guns and stuff. It wasn't my favorite story line. It didn't progress with the story with the others, the hatch, or anything like that. <br />The bad: Sawyer's flashbacks. Nothing new. We already new he was a con-man. Didn't we already know that? The whole island con was stupid IMO. <br />Rating: 9.0/10 <br /> <br />One of Them <br />The Good: Danielle catches an other. Sayid interrogates \\"Henry Gale\\" and a GREAT scene between Locke and Jack regarding the Button. In Flashback, we find out how Sayid becomes a torturer. <br />The Bad: A corny side plot with Hurley and Sawyer. <br />Rating: 9.6/10 <br /> <br />Maternity Leave <br />The Good: Kate, Claire and Danielle go into the jungle to find a vaccine for Aaron, they find another hatch, we find out what happened to Claire when she was taken, and the scene with Eko and Henry. <br />The Bad: Nothing was really bad in this episode. <br />Rating: 9.8/10 <br /> <br />The Whole Truth <br />The Good: Sayid, Ana, and Charlie go find Henry's balloon, and Sun becomes pregnant therefore Jin is not sterile anymore. Flashbacks were solid. <br />The Bad: I don't really dig the Jun romance. <br />Rating: 9.4/10 <br /> <br />Lockdown <br />The Good: Lockdown in the hatch, Henry is a fraud, the poker scenes with Jack and Sawyer, and Locke's flashbacks reveal that Locke's dad is a con-man, possibly the real Sawyer? <br />The Bad: Nothing was bad, really. <br />Rating: 9.7/10 <br /> <br />Dave <br />The Good: The TWO scenes in the hatch with Henry and others. We find out why Hurley was in the mental hospital and how he gets out. And we find out Libby was in the hospital. I also liked the kiss with Hurley and Libby. I like the joke Sawyer made with Hurley. <br />The Bad: Imaginary friend was stupid. You can just skip the Hurley and Dave scenes and just watch the hatch scenes. <br />Rating: 9.2/10 <br /> <br />S.O.S. <br />The Good: I liked Kate and Jack going into the jungle to find the others and Henry messing with Locke's mind, and the getting caught in a net scene. <br />The Bad: Who cares about Bernard and Rose's flashbacks, there just useless secondary characters. SOS sign was pointless because it was NEVER finished. It was a pointless plot. When I first heard about this episode, I thought it would be sweet. I thought Rose & Bernard would use the radio transceiver to send out the SOS signal. Boy I was wrong; yet another \\"filler\\" episode. <br />Rating: 8.9/10 <br /> <br />Two for the Road <br />The Good: Michael returns with news about the others. Ana has a tumble in the jungle with Sawyer, if you know what I mean, we find out that Ana goes to Australia with Jack's dad, and Hurley and Libby Scene And the most shocking cliffhanger in the history of the show. <br />The Bad: Absolutely nothing. <br />Rating: 9.9/10 <br /> <br />? <br />The Good: Eko and Locke find the Pearl and the whole emotional scene with Libby. <br />The Bad: Eko's flashbacks were O.K. <br />Rating: 9.5/10 <br /> <br />Three Minutes <br />The Good: We find out a lot about the others and what happened to Michael. A great scene with Sawyer and Jack, and Sayid catches on to Michael's plan. Lots of GOOD dialogue. <br />The Bad: Pretty slow story line <br />Rating: 9.6/10 <br /> <br />Live Together, Die Alone <br />The Good: EVERYTHING! Desmond, the button, the others and their camp and we find out the outside world is still out there! BEST EPISODE EVER BROTHER! <br />The Bad: NOTHING! <br />Rating: 10/10 <br /> <br />Overall, Season Two was ALMOST on par with Season One. <br />Rating: 9.5/10
B000FP2Z0S|4.0|I have all of Rise Against's CDs.  I've been a fan since I bought my first one, and I've been to see them live.  My favorite album has always been Revolutions Per Minute, and the songs on The Sufferer and the Witness sound like they could have been written at the same time. <br /> <br />The hardcore punk rock is still a very powerful part of their sound, but the strong melodies of the vocals always come through to give the songs something more than you would normally expect from the genre.  I especially like tracks 1,2,6, and 7. <br /> <br />I miss the screaming guitar solos of their past albums, but the musicianship on The Sufferer still impresses me each time I listen to it. <br /> <br />If you liked their other CDs, this one will not let you down!
B00005JOX6|5.0|Click is about an artitect Michael Newman (Adam Sandler), who goes into Bed Bath and Beyond to find a universal remote. He goes asleep on a bed and wakes up and goes into the beyond section of the store. A guy named Morty (Christopher Walken) gives him a universal remote and tells him how it works. The remote can fast forward time, rewind, etc. Mike has fun with it and fast fowards anything he doesn't like such as showering, traffic, and arguing with his wife (Kate Beckinsale). The remote remembers stuff like this and starts to fast foward through Mike's life without Mike using the remote; auto-pilot. Mike tries to get rid of it, but the remote doesn't go away. It fast fowards through his life and gets out of control and eventually Mike dies. Then he wakes up at the Bed Bath and Beyond near the beginning of the movie. So the almost the whole movie was a dream. The message to this movie is that family comes first and appreciate your life while you can. <br />Overall another Adam Sandler classic. Probally my favorite AS movie besides Big Daddy. <br />Rating: 9.8/10
B00005JOQS|5.0|Well superman fans of all ages and countries,he's finally back!For two years plus,I've read about the Brian Singer movie,and it was worth the wait!The action is intense and the story line is very well written.I went to see this with my nephew,and I must say I got a little teary eyed watching it!I thought about my dad and how much he would have loved to seen the return of our favorite super hero.When there was nothing else for us to talk about or agree on,we knew that superman was our common ground.The special effects alone are worth going to see the movie,however,the story carrys itself well,even if it's a little slow at times.It should be kept in  mind that this is a sort of re-introduction of the man of steel.Not so much as to us who have known him,but rather to those who are coming behind us.Superman is portrayed well by Brandon Routh,he is intense and strong (as the superman should be!)Kate Bosworth plays a convincing Lois Lane with all the right elements in her part(she shows that she can't stay mad at superman forever!).Kevin Spacey is an excellent Lex(even though I kept hoping to see Gene Hackman).Go see the movie yourself,and decide whether the man of steel has truly returned...I'm sure you will agree...YES HE HAS!!!<br /><br />If by some chance someone from DC comics,or Warner bros;or Mr. Singer should read this review,let me just say this.Since my father is not here to say it,I would like to say thank you...for the BOTH OF US!!!<br /><br />Hope you make another superman movie!
B00006RU5B|3.0|I can understand why this band is popular- Joining 2 established products in Chris Cornell & the band of Rage against the machine. Cornell's vocals are classic rock style- very easy listening. My opinion is that this band had outstanding backing from its label with an aim to be as popular as possible. This albums theme is an Ultra-polished sound made by a high dollar production. If high quality vocals & music styles aimed to be popular & sell records is your dream- I can't fault your opinion.  <br /> <br />My problem is that this band doesn't comply with the basic rock fundamental of high tempo, energetic ROCK! Now I've read other reviews arguing that songs like \\"Exploder\\" are fast & lively but those who write that don't have Motorhead & Iron Maiden in their listening environment. Simply put- these guys play medium mixed with slow tempo's and NOT one time do they let go & charge! <br /> <br />I think much of it is part of what I said first- The label backs this band with a lot of money & probably handcuffs their creativity. Think this band would ever start a track with a heavy, 2 minute guitar solo? NO WAY! The label wants this to be as mainstream as possible & would first tell them to cut the solo & slow that track down & obviously they do.  <br /> <br />In spite of lack of energy in their writing I do, however, really enjoy the bluesy slow track \\"Like a Stone\\". The vocals drag but in a good way. Reminds me of a comfy  rainy night drive to see an old girlfriend.  <br /> <br />The other songs I would not rate as bad.. just suffer from luke-warmness. None of these tracks really stands out. Reminds me of Vivian Campbell's solo records in that nothing specifically wrong with this stuff other than it suffers from some blandness.

B000FS9FCQ|4.0|the political tinge on amazon is beyond the brim.  instead of interpreting the bill of rights as our founding fathers intended, conservatives are on this site insulting a movie.  hits a bit too close to home, does it?
B000053V7Q|3.0|I'm being very generous giving this film 3 stars, only because it DOES include a lot of great never-before-seen footage...however, this so called \\"Special Edition\\" is ruined for me because in order to GET this extra footage, they deleted 3 songs from the original version of the film! (\\"I Just Can't Help Believin'\\", \\"Bridge Over Troubled Water\\" and \\"Sweet Caroline\\"...probably my favorites!!!) To make matters worse, the original version of this film has been GONE ever since, and doesn't look like it will ever be re-released! Another insult is the fact that there is a short documentary included on the special edition all about how this edition was edited!!! (butchered would have been a better word!!!) I'm not saying this new edition is not enjoyable...it is...but why was anything from the original version deleted from this one?!!! This new version runs for only 109 minutes...that's well under two hours!!! Why were these three great songs taken out???!!! I wouldn't have minded this new edition so much if the original version was still available, but it's not!!! I have the original on VHS and it looks like I'll have to keep it. I didn't buy the DVD when it was still around because I heard the special edition was coming out...big mistake!!! If I had only known!!! For some reason, Elvis products usually have to be released about 3 times before they get it right!!! The recently released box set of the \\"68 Comeback\\" could have been better too!!! The entire production number of \\"It Hurts Me\\" is only on this set in segments, the way it was originally taped! In order to get the song in one piece, you have to get the newly released single disc version of the special!!! I've read somewhere that this was just a mistake, but I'm not sure I believe it...I think it's just a way to get the fans to buy the same product over and over, because this kind of thing happens all the time!!! Imagine! A 3-disc set of the \\"68 Special\\" and you STILL have to buy it again to get something they leftout!!!
B000EMGAGW|3.0|Mobb Deep - Blood Money (Interscope, 2006) <br /> <br />I can hear the comments now. \\"Oh no, here comes another Mobb Deep hater just because they signed with G-Unit.\\" That's far from the truth. It's also not fair for old fans to say that Mobb Deep have fallen off because they signed with Fiddy and company. Because honestly, Mobb Deep have been slipping for some time now. They tried to make a comeback in 2004 with Amerikaz Nightmare but although it got critical acclaim (I personally thought it was average), it didn't translate into sales and the album was their first and last for Jive. So now they drop Blood Money on G-Unit Records: put 50 Cent on a few tracks with some hard beats and you got a hit, right? <br /> <br />Wrong. Though this album debuted on Billboard's (Hip-Hop/R&B) chart at #1, it fell off faster than you can say \\"dunny\\". It's hard to pinpoint exactly what went wrong but I noticed that after repeated listens, the great songs are merely decent while the weak songs are really bad. For example, \\"Have a Party\\" featuring Nate Dogg is pure garbage (why they chose this song from the Get Rich or Die Tryin Soundtrack over \\"Yous a Shooter\\" is anybody's guess), as well as \\"Click Click\\" (with Tony Yayo, who should be banned from the mic) and \\"Give It to Me\\" (featuring Young Buck). Also, I'm not feeling their new personas in \\"Capital P, Capital H\\" (\\"Hollywood Hav\\" and \\"V.I.P.\\") and 50 Cent totally outshines them in \\"Creep\\" (yes, 50 can actually rap when he wants to). <br /> <br />All is not lost, though. \\"The Infamous\\" is the lone track produced by The Alchemist and it brings signs of a comeback as well as \\"Speakin So Freely\\", \\"Pearly Gates\\" and the introspective \\"Daydreamin'\\". But it'll be pretty hard to think about \\"Shook Ones, Pt. II\\", then listen to one of the weaker tracks here and not cry. Even Havoc is starting to sound uninspired (but his beats remain decent). Maybe they should go back and listen to the album, The Infamous, to remind them of how hungry andraw they once were (by the way, fans of that album will recognize the title of my review as one of their tightest songs).  <br /> <br />All I can say is how funny it is that Mobb Deep (more so P than Hav), Jay-Z and Nas were all beefing with each other in 2001. Today, Jay-Z and Nas make amends and what is the Mobb doing? Signing with 50 and ultimately still trying to save their careers. -EJR
1592400876|2.0|After reading Lynne Truss's mega-bestseller on grammar that claims not to be about grammar, I was left with just as many questions as when I started. Questions not only about punctuation usage (she calls it the `zero tolerance approach,' but gives plenty of examples of when tolerance is ok after all), but also about why so many people would be interested in this rather dusty, highbrow attempt to make punctuation cool.<br /><br />While I found myself chuckling at some of the examples of ambiguity caused by the lack of (or over use of) punctuation, her attempts at humor were just that--attempts. A joke isn't funny if the audience doesn't get it, has to look up the punch line in a footnote, or is forced to reread it half a dozen times to try and untangle the obtuse meaning.<br /><br />Although apparently millions of people worldwide enjoy her approach, her arguments for the use of proper punctuation left me unconvinced. The goal of writing is communication, yes. But it is also to reach people, touch people, connect with people. And the thought of endlessly editing my emails and chat sessions and correcting other people when they use an apostrophe in a way I would rather they didn't doesn't seem like a very fulfilling way to spend my life. And I can also think of better, more evocative, ways to ruin a friendship than nitpicking.
B000002KO1|5.0|This album really did change everything. Even if you were not a fan, and not alive in the dawn of what we called \\"New Wave,\\" you won't be disappointed by this first growling achievement to come from a band that delivers everything rock ever convinced us it could do. It has guts, and I doubt I was the only girl who heard the voice of C. Hynde, watched the 'Brass in Pocket' video,  and soon decided to  ditch those scary shoulder pads and pick up a guitar or a microphone.<br /><br /> It's always about what we personally find appealing: so if you don't care for her voice, I can't explain why it works for me. It seems as if she's alone in a room and singing her own lyrics just for herself. That's the highest praise there is, to my mind.<br /><br /> Doesn't anyone find irony in the name of the band?  Maybe you had to live in true Pretender-land...Los Angeles, in the eighties,  to understand how many barbarians were storming the gates of the new frontier that was music video, with lots of hair and no talent. It was a wide open moment in music history and The Pretenders were part of a turning of the tide against some of the things that came back to kill the music industry in the 90's. No names, please.<br /><br />The band's subsequent name change followed this  album's release, was not even noted by most, and I don't know why people  seem to consider a \\"The\\" placed before the name of the band as anything important. KROQ left it alone. Good enough for me.  Critics are talking about it now but that stuff is way too far over my spiked crop top. We can refuse to care about the ridiculous, can't we?<br /><br />I suggest that if you like any one song ever done by Hynde, you'll like pretty much everything she has done so far.  There's a lot, so far, and it stays on this same track.  Not many artists can give you this sort of continuity, without falling into stylistic potholes along the way.<br /><br />'Brass in Pocket' will get you started, but if you do what we did (play this until the vinyl melts, your family stops speaking to  you, and your earsdrums evaporate)  you will find that 'Precious'  'Up The Neck'  and 'Tattooed Love Boys'  all sneak up on you pretty fast.<br /><br />This album set a decade back on its haunches to regroup and it doesn't look as if anyone ever could quite catch up. Certainly Hynde  had a lot of excellant talent in the trenches with her, but I think that she won the war she waged against plastic music on this first album, and continues to fight, basically on her own merits. Unmatched honesty in her voice and in her lyrics.<br /><br />Everything you could possibly hope for; but you'd need all of The Pretender's work and years to roll around on it before you would be completely convinced.<br /><br />That's a prescription, if you like.(play this until the vinyl melts, your family stops speaking to  you, and your earsdrums evaporate)  you will find that 'Precious'  'Up The Neck'  and 'Tattooed Love Boys'  all sneak up on you pretty fast. <br /> <br />This album set a decade back on its haunches to regroup and it doesn't look as if anyone ever could quite catch up.

B000GCFO0I|5.0|Now, in all honesty, I've never played the game, so I can't even say how closely it followed the storyline or the premise of the video game. I can say, however, that as far as horror movies go this one can stand on its own. The atmosphere that the director makes is one so dark and moody it's just creepy. The actions behind the faith and religion of those left in Silent Hill is downright scary, and the acting wasn't half bad. I know there aren't a lot of moments that will make you jump or scream, but the movie is disturbing and it is psychologically overpowering in moments. I may be wrong in all this because I've never played the game, but I feel that this is one of the better horror movies to come out in a while.
B00005JOVH|3.0|I guess I went to the theater with too great of expectation.  While the ending was exciting and full of actions, the first 2/3 movie was not so great.  On certain movies, I don't much care for character building or great plots.  I just want to be entertained.  Well, the first 2/3 of the Last Stand failed to do so in my opinion.  In fact, I actually saw two people walk out.  Even I was getting bored.  There were too much talking and explaining that was not needed.  I am guessing that the actors wanted to show their acting skills.  Now for those two who walked out, they missed an exciting ending.  There were great actions and wonderful graphics, which I was accustomed to from the other Marvel movies.  If I had to compare the Last Stand to another movie, then I would have to go with \\"DOOM\\".  Just like \\"DOOM\\", nothing worth while happened until the end.  In summary, I have bought the first two X-Men movies, but I am not planning to buy the Last Stand.  I recommend others to watch before purchasing this movie.  You may decide that once was enough.  I hope this helped.  549th!!!
B0002DB0FO|5.0|Good entertainment. Gentle characters that reflect a simple way of dealing with the events of life. Not realistic in terms of the real world but easy to accept. Maybe the acceptance is based on our own perspectives on how we wish the world was???? <br />Never the less the show is entertaining, acting is very good. Characters are easy to like, no matter how crumpy or querky. I wish all kids where so highly intelligent and understanding of adult failings but...... Here again part of the charm of the show. Reminds me a little bit of Northern Exposure. Not sure why. <br />You won't be disappointed unless you need your entertainment complexed and intense.
B00049QQHI|5.0|I absolutely loved the movie The Basketball Diaries.  The acting is just incredible.  Leonardo Dicaprio is absolutely breathtaking.  Also, the message of Don't Use Drugs is clear and really will persuade viewers not to use them.
B00003CWTI|1.0|The cast of Boogie Nights does the most depressing movie since the Passion Of The Christ.  If you don't feel like being entertained by a movie, and want to be bored, upset, depressed and otherwise SICK, watch this [...] One of the worst ever.
B000FFJ85I|4.0|First of all, anyone might have seen this change coming; it is evident on such songs like Death of Seasons on Sing the Sorrow. Davey has been interested in putting electronic beats or whatnot for some time (if anyone went to their website months and months ago, they had Head Like a Hole on there - extremely industrial). Therefore, one could have seen this coming. It's not bad at all, the album is actually very well-written; though it may take some listens before it catches your attention. True, the album is far more poppy than Sing the Sorrow, but does that matter? Don't be musically smug or an elitist when listening to this album (actually, don't be one at all).  <br /> <br />Nonetheless, the album was a change for AFI to delve into some experimental waters, and they did not do bad at all.
B000FA57RG|4.0|I'm definitely reviewing this from the perspective of being a huge fan - and have seen several shows of Madonna's last two tours.  I held off on purchasing this until a couple of days ago when I decided I needed something to \\"get my fix\\" once Confessions was over (LOL).  I'm giving it 4 stars, but I'm not going to fawn all over it just because it finally got released.  It deserves a bit of criticism. <br /> <br />The live CD: <br /> <br />First of all, this is the first ever full live CD release of at least a portion of a Madonna concert in her career.  Its about time!  Given that vocally her last 2 or 3 tours have been her best (perhaps RIT her absolute best) this was a good choice of shows.  There are a handful of really stellar performances captured on this CD.  Madonna's amazing rendition of \\"Like A Prayer\\" from the show is the real standout for me.  \\"The Beast Within\\" leading into \\"Vogue\\" is the best opening ever for a Madonna concert, and especially for a fan, its great having this in a collection.  Madonna's vocal performance of \\"Die Another Day\\" which segues to \\"Lament\\" from Evita is another highlight on here.  But the one I keep listening to over and over is \\"Susan MacLeod/Into The Groove\\" which has bagpipes, drums, Missy Elliot - all thrown into a great remix of Into The Groove.  It was definitely one of the highlights from the show and its captured in its entirety on this CD.     <br /> <br />However, I am disappointed that they did not include the entire show on the CD - and there are some key tracks missing.  \\"Nothing Fails\\" was one of Madonna's best vocal performances from the show yet its not here.  And toward the end of the show she dedicated \\"Crazy For You\\" to all the fans that have stuck by her for the last 20 years and belted it out in all its glory - its not on the CD either.  Instead they included the \\"Hollywood\\" interlude where Madonna doesn't even sing, the \\"Holiday\\" finale which was fun, but where a CD rendition doesn't do it justice, and \\"Nobody Knows Me\\", which was basically Madonna lip-synching (there were 2 such performances in the show).  Fans may agree or disagree on some songs but I think most would agree that Nothing Fails and Crazy For You were essential.  The only way to satisfy everyone - include the ENTIRE SHOW - which could have easily been done - especially when the CD is released 2 years after the fact!! <br /> <br />The DVD documentary: <br /> <br />I don't really have much to say about the documentary, other than its a lot more tame than Truth Or Dare.  I really enjoyed it as a fan, but if you're not a Madonna fan it could go either way for you.  However, the real valuable part of the DVD is the live performance clips.  All I can say is - this tour was AMAZING - and must be seen to be believed!!  Unfortunately, there's no special menu for just viewing these - in other words, no way to just view the concert.  And again, only like 2/3 of the performances are included.   <br /> <br />Unlike what a few others have said, I believe a live DVD of Re-Invention Tour would be WAY more valuable than this release - or better yet, we should've gotten it released with \\"Secret\\" at the same time.  Its an absolute travesty that this concert has never been televised or fully released on DVD up to this point!  <br />
B000FS9FCQ|5.0|There are times when it is difficult to watch this film.  In a post-September 11 world it is not easy to watch a film that makes a terrorist into a hero.  However, if all you see in V is a terrorist then I think you've missed the point of the film, because there is also a strong undercurrent of patriotism throughout.  V for Vendetta is set in a not-so-distant future that looks dusturbingly like a future that could easily be formed out of real-life current events.  In this future the government  has taken away basic civil liberties in the name of national security; government policies are based on fanatical religious doctine; and those who are different (gays and lesbians) are vilified and blamed for the ills of the world.  Sounds familiar, anyone?  This was also a well-cast film.  Hugo Weaving is simply great as V; and even though you never get to see his face, Weaving is able to convey real emotional strength.  Weaving is a very under-valued actor.  Natlie Portman was also great as Evey, the shy girl who comes around to V's thinking.  It says something about this film that when the final, horrific scene happens you find yourself cheered and excited.  This film is disturbing, but one of the finest of 2006.
B000FS9FC6|4.0|<br />Let me first start by saying that i REALLY WANTED TO HATE THIS MOVIE, when i first heard the title, i thought it somewhat weak, then i saw the protagonist hero wore a clown-like mask while fighting evil, which sorry to say really didn't help win me over, and when i heard that the Wachowski Brother's helped put the movie together, my opinion was complete(I'm still boiling over their final installment of the Matrix Trilogy which i enjoyed about as much as inflamed genital boils). <br /> <br />However, despite my prejudgment,i must confess this movie is a triumph. Its almost like taking Batman and putting him in a Shakespearean modern conceptualization of George Orwell's 1984.  <br /> <br />Simply put, the story is a romanticized view of a lone hero set out toward opening the minds of his fellow English brothers and sisters oppressed by a fascist government gone crazy. Although she gets top billing, Natlie Portman provides nothing more than a pretty face and limited acting skills as the sometimes unwilling disciple of V, the blade wielding, eclectic,(possibly sociopathic) protagonist (played by Hugo Weaving, AKA..Mr. Smith from the Matrix trilogy) who more than adequately makes up for Ms. Portmans terribly limited acting skills (sweety you had your five minutes of fame in Star Wars, take it, and may the FORCE BE WITH YOU).  <br /> <br />The most interesting aspect of the movie, was in how realistic the future painted is, to the life and society we live in today. <br />If you play close attention you will see how the insane fascist dictator seems vaguely familiar to a certain American leader who like in the movie is against homosexuality, has ostracized his nation from the rest of the world, and uses continuous fear to keep his country in line (i.e. 9/11, Bird flu, Axis of evil, and the continuous war on terror)....... but i digress.. no point in beating around the er..um.. BUSH.  <br /> <br />Another point that should be mentioned is the groundbreaking aspect this movie sets in regards to many action flicks in that it doesn't hold its own on fancy special effect, but on simply an intelligent smart story(sadly a rarity in many action films these days). The weak points i figure can only be seen in that I would have liked to have seen V in more fighting scenes, and the fascist dictators demise at the end seemed a tad anti climatic (sorry for the spoiler). So if you're like me dispel any first rush assumptions you might have had. This movie leaves you with the same message the first MATRIX movie (another triumph by the way) left many with........FREE YOUR MIND.

0060872675|5.0|We got this book as a gift from my Mom-in-law.  We are Pratchett fan family.... Logan my 16 month old... LOVES IT, and has loved it for Months on end.... he always grabs that book and hands it to  us to read, and re-read and re-read.... you get the picture.  LOL.  We just love it..... but you know.... I wonder where the cow is???
0064440346|5.0|This book is marvelous. All the stories in this book are so charming, innocent and beautiful. I dont believe my own eyes. Now, all the illustrations are also absolutely wonderful. They are incomparables. As I said, I dont believe my own eyes, because in today's book market (dominated by emptiness, futility and commercial [...]), it is like a glass of pure water in the desert. More, it is a miracle! I read it every night to my children, and cannot put it down myself. I am sad on only one point: I cannot give it 6 stars. Please, buy this beautiful little book to your children. It is a wonderful gift they wont forget. One of these few wonderful souvenirs we all love so much to remember from our childhood.
B000E6UK5K|2.0|In short, if you are a floyd fan and are expecting any type of floydish song-writing / musical style, than you will be very disappointed with this album.  If you are a fan of gilmour's vocals and guitar playing, than you will probably like the majority of the tracks on this album. <br />I unfortunately, based on many of the reviews on this site, expected the former and so was very disappointed.  Since I am a fan of pink floyd, I left this album on my mp3 player for a few weeks hoping that it would eventually grow on me after listening to it more, but it did not.  The lyrics are embarrassing weak and after the first few tracks I got tired of the same old guitar riffs that we've heard gilmour play before. <br /> <br />Yeah, I know, I shouldn't have expected a floyd album, but come on, being part of such a great band with so many incredible albums, you would think that dave would set the bar a bit higher for himself.  I honestly beleive that if it was not for his name and history, this album would have probably never been produced. <br /> <br />Save your money and get the new pulse dvd...
B00008O89K|5.0|What can I say that you don't known now. These movies live or die on the music and we all know that. Poledouris and Zimmerman rule the pack but, \\"There are more little brother!\\" as the Irishman told Antonio in \\"The Thirteenth Warrior.<br /><br />\\" Excalibur\\" Conan, Lord of the Rings, The Exorcist all owe much of their fame to the music. This soundtrack is very nice and will not disappoint you.
B000CNFC76|5.0|This was SUCH a great movie. You don't have to know anything about golf to get into this movie... I don't, and I still was gripping my hands together in suspense at the 18th hole! I had always found golf to be tedious, dry and boring, but this movie makes you understand why so many people love it.<br /><br />I thought this was some obscure sporting underdog story that the filmmakers just dredged up from the backwaters of history to have something to make an inspiring movie out of. But it's not obscure at all: it involves two of the most famous golf players of all time going head-to-head in the U.S. Open Championship that changed the face of American golf.<br /><br />I was really surprised at how much I enjoyed this movie. I even watched the bonus features afterwards, and I'll probably read the book! I'm also going to buy the soundtrack because the music was so good.
1400077915|5.0|Munro is an absolutely gorgeous writer. I was discussing this book with some friends over dinner and we all realized that the more we talked, the more sadness we saw in the stories. The prose is so luminous and the characters are so real, it is easy to forget the quiet and unquiet desperation that their lives are describing.<br /><br />Runaway seems to be a meditation on several themes. The obvious one is the idea of flight. Her characters flee in a multitude of ways-- successfully, unsuccessfully, with large rebellion and small. Small town life with all its constraints and beauty is explored through the context of young women trying to come to terms with its limitations.<br /><br />This book would be suitable for anyone who is a lover of strong character-driven fiction (short or otherwise). If you read and appreciate writers like Marilynne Robinson, then this will likely be a book for you. It will be high on my list of books to be given as a gift this year.
B00023B1LC|5.0|The Bourne Identity is high on my list of all time favorite movies.  Matt Damon plays a former government agent who thanks to a series of unfortunate events finds himself with amnesia, unconscious and floating in the sea, which is where the movie starts.  The rest of the movie follows his journey trying to figure out who he is and how he came to be floating in the sea with bullet wounds in his back.  Of course his quest is made a little more difficult when the government decides they would rather he just disappear.<br /><br />This movie will hold your attention from the very beginning, the plot is interesting and the movie very well made.  The main character Jason Bourne (Damon) is likeable and intriguing.  The action is exciting and there really is no part of the movie where you start checking your watch to see if it is nearly over.  In fact this is one of those movies that holds your interest from start to finish.<br /><br />Now for the negatives:  I've heard that the movie does not follow the book too closely.  Well boo hoo, if you'd rather read the book then do so.  The government agency portrayed in this movie is a little ridiculous.  Basically they make a phone call and immediately get the cooperation of police and agencies all over the world.  They tap a few computer keys and immediately have access to surveillance camera images and other detailed information from all over the world.  Sure America is a superpower, but the level of cooperation between America and the rest of the world is simply not this good.<br /><br />Finally on the negative side, there is one stunt where Borne falls several stories down a stairwell shaft while accurately shooting people and uses a body to cushion the fall.  This takes the suspension of disbelief a little too far.  I don't see anyone surviving such a fall in real life.  I don't really see how this sequence was necessary to the plot.<br /><br />But for all the petty negatives this is one of those movies that I loved the first time, and continue to watch to this day.  I'm sure I've seen it more than a dozen times, and there are not many movies I like to watch that often.<br /><br />If you like cool action movies with an intelligent plot, this one will not disappoint.time, and continue to watch to this day.  I'm sure I've seen it more than a dozen times, and there are not many movies I like to watch that often.<br /><br />If you like cool action movies with an intelligent plot, this one will not disappoint.
B00005UKE0|5.0|I just couldn't rate this one below five stars. Music to perfection at its best. What else do you want for when you got the finest musicians(Harrison, Clapton, Keltner, Starr, Preston, Badfinger etc.) and producer(Phil Spector)on the planet in one album.
B000FP2Z0S|5.0|I love old punk most but a good recent day album can be a good change of pace (all depending on the band). Rise Against is one band in which I find brilliant in music, vocal, lyric, and song-writing talent (owning all their previous cds). This album is nothing too new after Siren Song of the Counter Culture, but a good place to start. You can see the difference in overall sound from The Unraveling to this which is good. I reccomend this and Siren Song of the Counter Culture for any new Rise Against fans.
B0000248L0|5.0|On a personal level, Never Neverland is a very special album to me, by the fact that thanks to it I discovered one of the most fantastic and overlooked guitar heroes on the face of the planet: Mr. Jeff Watters. <br />The dynamics of the songs, the great execution and the incredible amount of technical resources shown by the musicians on this recording makes of Never Neverland an overwhelming and bombastic sonic experience. <br />The chemistry between Watters  and the killer rhythm section (Ray Hartman on drums and Wayne Darley on bass) is simply out of this world. <br />My actual rating is 4.5 stars. Never Neverland falls short from perfection due to vocalist Coburn Pharr's performance, which I found somewhat stiff and unexpressive, excepting the aforementioned complain everything else is state of the art. <br />Favorite songs: \\"The Fun Palace\\", \\"Sixes and Sevens\\", \\"Never Neverland\\",\\"Road To Ruin\\", \\"Reduced To Ash\\".
B000AP04FG|2.0|There has been so much hype surrounding this movie and I really expected it to be better than it was. The premise of \\"Mr. & Mrs. Smith\\" is pretty interesting: Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie play John and Jane Smith, a couple that has been married for five (or six) years and finds themselves stuck in a bit of a rut. John and Jane are both assassins, but neither of them are aware of their spouse's real profession. The truth comes out in a big way when their careers suddenly cross paths and their respective agencies order them to take each other out. Half of the movie revolves around the couple shooting at each other, but then they're both ultimately turned on by all the violence, which rekindles the passion in their marriage. Then their respective agencies decide that both assassins pose a conflict of interest because they're married, and the second half of the movie revolves around the Smiths working together to stay alive.<br /><br />I was pretty disappointed with this movie. It has a lot of potential because the premise is so interesting, and also because Pitt and Jolie have an undeniable onscreen chemistry. However, the script SUCKS! All these characters do is run around and shoot at people. Some people might enjoy that kind of thing, but I think the dialogue could have been much better and the relationship between John and Jane could have been scrutinized in much more detail.

0224076051|5.0|Woit has written a very good book! Having studied strings since their inception (following on the duality work of Veneziano in 1968, and then many others) my work fortunately took a different path... The unique position that now appears is that of one who knows what strings are all about, but who enjoys seeing how long it'll take the rest of the physics fraternity to catch up - this claim is backed up below with a few solid predictions! Unlike a large proportion of stringy 'aficionados' (seemingly driven by egos rather than desires to advance physical understanding) Woit has taken pains to be unemotional (unlike Motl) and to present  the hard facts (both in reality and as conceptually hard) to an  intelligent readership. Woit has completed a difficult task well without relying on the 'descriptive' cover of mathematics - even though he has the maths tools to have done so. <br /> <br />A vital aspect of Woit's book is that it approaches the strings debate scientifically; that is, from its conceptual basis, although words are used to decribe the physics instead of mathematics. In my opinion this was hard. The well-chosen phrases that Woit uses to explain the physical concepts have an effective mathematical shorthand, but that's just another language; you don't need math to make useful contributions to physics - although to be heard it certainly helps. Woit's book is the first to ask the very 'hard' questions of a fraternity that does not liked to be questioned - he allows the readers to form their own views after presenting most of the hard facts. <br /> <br />The problem with strings (it is not a theory since nothing about it can be falsified - just as there is nothing falsifiable about a pretty picture even though it can be said to be descriptive of what the artist was thinking at the time) is that it attempts to describe physical reality from the side-in. The concepts of both quantum mechanics and general relativity describe reality from a top-down perspective, butreality is only generated from bottom-up in a very simple way. Looking in from the side one sees many things, depending on one's field-of-view; all different and parts of the whole. What strings attempts to describe is othogonal to reality as seen from above or below; thus, it is not surprising that the number of edge-on views available to strings is nearly infinite and so the true landscape of reality unseeable from its stringy perspective. <br /> <br />As promised above, some predictions that come from a bottom-up view of reality. The Higgs energy is 34.25 TeV, supersymmetry is true, but to see it needs high resolution, not high energy; a good example is the energy space between electron 510999 eV and selectron 512104 eV, and between proton 938272194 and sproton at just 7429 ev up-scale at 938279623 eV and spin-zero. Every mass is able to be calculated easily and exactly. The universe that we occupy is uniquely described by a very simple mechanism, and it cannot be any other way! I enjoy seeing how difficult all the stringy people are making things; they need to revisit 1972 and find the proper path. Woit's words will win in the end. He has had the courage to tell the story how it really is, and the truth is all that really matters in the end... <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B000031XCR|4.0|Celine Dion is a terrific singer but I wished there had been a few more upbeat songs included on this CD (like I Drove All Night, etc).  It seems like it's all ballads.  Other than that, great listening.
B00005QEO1|5.0|Pump definitely consolidated Aerosmith as one of the top and dearest Hard Rock bands for a second generation of fans, who missed the first wave of Stones on steroids sonics of the group.<br /><br />Althought Pump is intended since its conception for a mass market and has printed the dollar sign all over the cover, the album is an excellent musical work. The songs are exciting, well executed and neatly produced (courtesy of Bruce Fairbairn). \\"Love In An Elevator\\", \\"The Other Side\\" and \\"F.I.N.E\\", will make you pump your fists on the air, \\"Janie's Got a Gun\\" is a classic sing along, if you're on the mood \\"What It Takes\\" will make you shed a tear or two, and \\"Voodoo Medicine Man\\" is an underrated gem.<br /><br />Hoorray!!!!, for mercantilism with musical quality!!!!
0793518326|4.0|Overall this is a very good book. It even has the notes for some of the more obscure instruments like the sitar. However, the print is very small and at times hard to read, especially the tablature.
0618477942|5.0|Once I started reading \\"Fun Home\\" I was immediately absorbed and <br />could barely put it down. It is a well-told & thoughtful <br />autobiography that gives the reader the essence of herself and <br />her family relationships (though mostly with her parents and much less so with her brothers). The courage for telling it like <br />it was (\\"[she] thinks\\") and chronicling of the world around her is <br />incredibly touching and impressive.
B00065U08Q|5.0|I read some of the reviews and I don't believe that they do so much dislike it. I know that you have to have a special sence for music to like Jonhfru. But, if you once start loving him, you can't stop. I mean, there are always Synthesizers and stuff on his lps. i have to confess that ASITHOS was maybe the hardest of the six albums for me to get into it. When I started to understand the rough beauty, it really catched me.  <br /> <br />The best way to get to the album's soul is to listen to it backwards, start with the typical Johnfru-song My Life and end with the mind-smashing Sphere. Of course, noone should buy this CD just because he likes RHCP or the single The Past Recedes. This CD is better for dy-hards. I'm disappointed of them because only a few of them seem to have written a review. <br /> <br />This album isn't easy, it's electronic, still some pop, but never mainstream. And I love it.
B00005ASOC|5.0|Two well different solitudes will meet each other. One of them represents the isolation among four walls, filled of books and writings but without human warmth; the other is most widely known, a talented young who possesses high caliber sensibility, gifted to scrutinize, analyze and even write but without a leading voice who talks with him and be able to exchange ideas and advise in determined moments. This street boy knows about his skill in basket and is aware the basket is by far more fruitful than the culture; and he makes all his best to win in this legendary sport.<br /><br />But this meeting, anticipated by these destiny ironies will enrich each one another. Haunting and predictable but powerfully written,: Sean Connery shines in this role. One of these rare films without special effects, rivers of blood or common vulgarity that seemed to be fundamental features of the ninety per cent of the actual billboard.<br /><br />Absolutely recommendable.
B0000C6E4D|5.0|Sarah McLachlan's 2003 album \\"Afterglow\\" has been criticized by some for lacking good songs. People who feel this way should give album a second chance, because most of the songs are really great and the album as a whole is as least as good as her best.<br /><br />First impression may be that the songs are generally less catchy and harder to get into, compared to her previous albums.<br /><br />Personally I found both \\"Fallen\\" and \\"Push\\" very good and cacthy from first listen, while other songs like the waltzy \\"Time\\" and the quiet and beautiful \\"Answer\\" took a little more time for me to realize how great songs they are.<br /><br />The album is ,at times, lyrically slightly disillusioned and dark, but on the other hand it shows a strong belief in love. Musically it's a quiet and mature album; like always well-produced.
B0002W18MU|4.0|CHECK IT OUT!  Some really nice covers andf heartfelt singing if you don't mind the sound of a human voice cracking and fading. <br /> <br />like when a dear departed loved one returns to you in a dream.
B0001NBMBC|5.0|I had already read a lot about the album even before it was released. The picture that i had in my mind was that this would be an insanely heavy album. But this album was truly just not metal, it was something more. I guess lyrically this one is no better than the rest. Actually all their stuff is decent in this respect. Slipknot was raw and somewhat not well polished. IOWA was outright heavy and angry. Vol. 3 has it all the anger, the extreme heaviness. And ofcourse the new element - power ballads. Wow these acoustic ballads really seep into your skin and make you feel creepy, like \\"Circle\\" and \\"Verm 2\\". \\"Danger Keep Away\\", well its different, slow and a bit scary. But it is this sense of creepyness that I love when I listen to bands like these. \\"Pulse Of the Maggots\\",\\"Before I forget\\",\\"Welcome\\",\\"Scream\\" are just outright heavy with an awesome rhythm. \\"Duality\\" is my personal fav. the chorus is awesome on this one. This album I admit is a more nu-metal that proper metal. But its still a masterpiece. It's never too late to pick this one up.
B0000AUHPB|5.0|Following the essential canons of the golden ages of the British comedy in the Fifties, this light thriller is masked with a set of memorable vignettes and suggestive flashes of acidic humor a la English way; where two brilliant minds (each one in its field) are planning to rob four millions $ in pure gold, thanks to the biggest traffic jam that Turin ever knew thanks to the collapse of the breakthrough of the computation system that rules the traffic signals.<br /><br />There is big difference between this first op. and the remake of 2003. On one hand, we have a sinister challenge to a respectable mob' s executives who made disappear to the pioneer of the idea; so it's not a simple match; the revenge spirit underlies. On the other hand, the leading acting of Michael Caine (one of his best performances); the spectacular locations, the brilliant chases and the disturbing and ironic finale that to my mind is a very smart homage to \\"Wages of fear.\\"<br /><br />Under any circumstance you should not miss this singular and amusing film.
B00028HBKM|1.0|As a movie viewer, I find the movie incredibly boring.  It is entirely devoid of any plot or drama.  Even the cheeziest horror flicks provide some suspense before they flood the screen with gore. Showing a guy getting beat up for two hours is simply lazy film-making.    As someone who has done advanced work in ancient history, I'm amused by the claim that this is a truthful representation of historical events.  A crowd under Roman rule would not have been allowed to influence a death sentence -- the Roman governor would have been the only person with such authority. The notion that the wife of Pontius Pilate would have taken pity on Jesus is impossible, not to mention the fact that the episode is not contained in the New Testament.  Anyone familiar with the ways of governing Romans would laugh at the idea that any Roman present would have shown any degree of sympathy.    Finally, as a Christian, I find this film highly insulting to my religion.  None of the basic messages of the New Testament -- love, mercy, forgiveness, humbleness -- is conveyed.  My religion is not a violent, blood-thirsty, or self-righteous one.

B000EMGAOY|5.0|The Peppers came along on the punk/funk scene in the 80's when I was in high school.  They challenged mainstream classifications as an innovator of a sound that boldly and stylishly fused punk, rock, funk, and R&B into their own unique Red Hot sound.  They got our attention.  Their album lyrics and live shows were filled with intense energy and a sexual/macho undercurrent that appealed to both men and women alike.  It was badboy fun and we rocked to it in our cars, at the parties, and at the small and large venues in San Francisco, Los Angeles, and throughout the U.S.A.! <br /> <br />The Peppers have maintained their rowdy boyishness through their career, and this is what has kept their music relevant and exciting for their fans.   <br /> <br />Enter this latest album.  As an early fan from the 80's and 90's I have had the opportunity to sample their albums as they hit the market.  I can honestly say that this new album is one of their best since Blood Sugar Sex Magic.  This truly is a great album.  This album definitely represents a more mature Pepper, but still harnesses the energy and mischieviousness that is Pepper.   <br /> <br />I hope you enjoy and appreciate this album as much as I do.  Have fun, go see the live show, and let loose! I can't wait to see them on this tour; see you there! <br /> <br />Mark
B000GCFO0I|5.0|By Far This is the best movie based on a game ever created. DOOM(sucked) House of the Dead(sucked) Resident Evil 1 and 2(eventhough i love the game the movie sucked a lot Paul Anderson please dont finish making the part 3).. <br />The only thing i loved about this movie is they focused on the same plot as on the game was with a lil extra changes but still works fine. story was based on the SH1 game wid a little extra storyline to understand more of wat happens to the people on silent hill. dont want to spoil the whole story just buy the movie. most of you people will definitely get confused of how it all started but as u progress thru the movie it reveals piece by piece of the reason behind all the nightmares Sharon is having.  <br /> <br />All i can say is an Awesome Movie for all the Fans of the game. and as for people who dont know the game and judging the movie and comparing it with some other lame movies (saving silverman? cmon alexander u still watch those movies? why give examples of movies that u love and compare it with this movie.) this is for people who got BRAINS to think coz is a little bit of a mystery movie and some suspense that creeps you out at night. I LOVE THE NURSES!!! they're so well adapted from the game and even better.  <br /> <br />ANYWAYS i recomend this for people who loves scary movies and obviously who loves the game.  <br />CHRISTOPER GANS please keep your promise as you said if this movie was a hit then you'll make a sequel. i cant wait for the sequel.  <br />PAUL ANDERSON please never ever EVER make movie-based game anymore you dont know what u doing with it.
B00011F5DK|4.0|We love these strategy games like this.  Anyone can win.  It is definitely more fun to play when you have 3 or 4 players.  It is not a challenge with only 2 unless you each play two colors - not the ideal way to play.  Great family game for all asges.
B0001MDQ2G|5.0|Big as a metal fan as I am, I still sometimes worry that there isn't much creativity left in the genre.  Every once in a while, something comes a long that gives you hope for the future of the genre.  Israeli quintet Orphaned Land's 'Mabool' is one such album that gives you hope.  This is definitely the most exciting metal album I've heard in a long time, and probably the finest metal cd from '04.  (Beating out first-rate efforts from Dillinger Escape Plan, Converge, Mastodon, Pain of Salvation and others.)<br /><br />On the Orphaned Land website 'Mabool' is classified as 'Atmospheric Gothic & Oriental Death Metal'.  This isn't an terribly apt classification, but this can be forgiven because this album is just damn hard to classify.  You just have to fall back on the correct but vague title 'progressive metal'.  Here, however, we don't mean 'prog-metal', not some innovation free Dream Theater clone.  Make no mistake, songs tend to be lengthy and complicated and the bands displays superior musicianship, but similarities between this and traditional prog-metal end their.  I think the comparison to Pain of Salvation is most obvious, though still a bit misleading, meaning that they don't actually sound much like PoS, but they do display a similar aesthetic.  Both bands focus on condensing a wide variety of disparate elements into a metal format,  while focusing on vocals and melody before flashiness or rhythm guitar work.<br /><br />Now, I've listened to plenty of brutal death and progressive or avant-garde metal bands in my day, and I do enjoy that kind of thing, but I am, at heart,  a traditionalist, preferring that my bands display a of sense of melody, or at least some catchiness .  The best bands, of course, display a depth that keeps their music interesting while still containing something that makes the album interesting the first time you listen to it.  Too many progressive albums are a purely intellectual experience, for me anyway.  They're interesting (sometimes very interesting) to listen to, but not really much fun.  Simply put, `Mabool' is a great pleasure to listen to both from an intellectual standpoint and in a more gut-response kinda way.  Not many bands can do this, and Orphaned Land does it better than most of the select few who even attempt it.  They simply understand song and melody writing, so even if you stripped away the eastern influences and progressive elements they'd still be a good band cause they just know how to write a song.<br /><br />'Mabool' is a concept album, and it contains no missteps whatsoever.  I could easily discuss each track individually, so I'll have to restrain myself.  The opener, 'Birth of the Three', is a very representative track, containing pretty much all the major elements of the band:  chunky riffing, piercing melodic leads, tasteful keyboards, acoustic and eastern instrumentation and melodies, an unconventional, winding song structure and wildly varied vocals. (Ranging from spoken word to conventional metal singing to death growls to distant moaning to choral vox.)  And these elements aren't necessarily spread about the song, but often piled upon one another, and they somehow manage to fit together beautifully rather than clash.  'Ocean Land' is another first-rate track, with incredibly dense instrumentation both electric and acoustic topped off by more immediately memorable vocals.  'Halo Dies' is fine epic, moving from their thick, melodic wall-of-sound approach to a pure death-thrash movement to a long, involved instrumental section and finally returning to some epic-sounding vocals.<br /><br />The album moves in a different direction about midway through with 'Building the Ark', a very beautiful acoustic song with competing choirs, male and female, which eventually come together. (I was afraid that Orphaned Land would abandon the metallic elements to often, but they don't, and these occasional sidetrips always pove enjoyable.)  'Norra El Norra' sees the electric instruments comeback, but it's still got a simpler, chant-like vibe to it.  Another very memorably song<br /><br />Other than two sparse, pretty and vocal-free acoustic pieces all that remains  is 'Mabool/The Storm Still Rages Inside', the 16 minute centerpiece of the album.  (Yeah, they're two tracks, but there isn't any cutoff between them and they're obviously of a piece.)  This song is perhaps a bit more conventional than most the album, downplaying the eastern sounds somewhat and coming across as more of a standard metal epic.  Still, it's a first-rate one, with an extremely lengthy but always intriguing solo, and it comes to an appropriately powerful climax, not just for the song, but for the album as a whole.  (Which is, of course, the gorgeous, haunting refrain 'Hear Your Orphan Child', particularly the harmonized extension of the word 'child'.)<br /><br />I guess I'm done.  Honestly, I was a bit skeptical about this album initially.  Sometimes people love things simply because they're different, and eventually the spell wears off.  Perhaps this is what's happened to me as well, but I doubt it.  It's definitely got a certain novelty value to it, but these guys clearly know what they're doing.  Can't wait to hear some more of their stuff.ll got a simpler, chant-like vibe to it.

1401302378|4.0|Most of us are familiar with the famous Wired magazine issue which had a cover story titled -The Long Tail. It was written by the editor of Wired magazine, Chris Anderson. The article became immensely popular among the business and geek community for it offered a simple framework by which the various forces were shaping the internet market place. The author also started a blog and I had managed to read quite a few of the entries. Given this background, I really did not want to read a full fledged book on \\"The Long Tail\\" which came out recently. But the fact that the entire framework, logic and examples would be at once place was enough to lure me in to buying it. It turned out to be a No-Regrets decision. <br /> <br />For the first time I was reading a book whose content resonated with my taste of readings. The book had examples of Clay Shirky's ontology essay which I had come across earlier, Barry Schwartz - 'The paradox of Choice' which I happened to read a year ago, and a hell lot of stuff which I had come across earlier. Since there were a lot of known and read things that were used to explain Long Tail phenomenon, I just loved the book. Its so very different from a lot of economics related books that I have read recently. For example, \\"The Undercover economist\\" by Tim Harford  revolves around the principles of scarcity and incentives. But the Long Tail economics thrive on the principle of abundance. <br /> <br />What is Long Tail ? It is a collection of millions of micromarkets. It is complete contrast to the hit driven markets and cultures. The types of goods sold in Long Tail Businesses are <br /> <br />    * Physical Goods - ebay, Amazon <br />    * Digital Goods - itunes <br />    * Information goods - google, wikipedia <br />    * Community - myspace, bloglines <br />    * Advertising - Craiglist <br /> <br />The Long Tail has come to existence because of three forces <br /> <br />   1. Democratization of Production - Dave Winer in a presentation says consumers are producers . The enabling tools like garage in Mac, blogging, utube, wikis, are enabling people to be producers rather than only consumers    <br />   2. Democratization of Distribution - The cost of distribution of goods has become next to nothing <br />   3. Aggregators / Filters  who match the Supply and Demand of the goods <br /> <br />The book then goes on to give umpteen examples to lay out the business model of the Long tail companies.Netflix,Amazon,Rhapsody,Mp3.com,salesforce.com,LEGO,Wikipedia,Garageband in Mac, Kitchenaid,BitTorrent are a few cases which find a mention in the book. The economics of abundance is brought in each of the above cases and thus bring home the point that traditional economic theories are no longer useful in explaining the Long Tail Markets. <br /> <br />The book leaves a lot of open questions in the book <br /> <br />    * Is more choice better or worse ? <br />    * Does more content translate to more sales ? <br />    * If the tail becomes longer, does it mean the shorter head ? <br />    * In the Long tail, is there a demand shift or an overall increase in demand ? <br /> <br />I am deadsure that there will be many many more businesses that will follow the Long tail economics. Its just a matter of time when entrepreneurs use this new economic framework and apply in various industries to create gazillions of markets.

0553212737|5.0|This book was a pretty funny societal review from Jane Austen's point of view, pointing out the hypocrisies of London at the time but not failing to do justice to the integretity of the characters. I loved the book...what more can I say? It's definitely geared towards females, obviously, but anyone can read it for lighthearted, enjoyable reading. It isn't that long of a book, and, after all, its a classic. So read it as soon as possible!

The defineing song on this album, which is comparable to \\"Holywoods - Fight Song\\" is definately \\"1996\\".

0792164903|5.0|Tim Burton really is an artist. Johnny Deep was perfect for the role of Ichabod Crane. The other cast are also perfect for their parts, especially Christopher Walken (in his second Tim Burton film) as the horseman. I also adore the gothic atmospher that Tim Burton puts into his best films.
B00005JNBQ|4.0|You have to have a weird sense of humour to enjoy this.  I do, and so I did.  It's a little strange and slow, but it's a black comedy and won't appeal to everyone.  Everyone is deadpan and secure in their nerdiness.  It's such a bizzare movie, I can totally understand why it has a cult following.  His friend Pedro stole each scene.  He was hillarious.  He wants to become class president and runs against Halie Duff's character, Summer.  Napolean saves the day when after giving your election speech, it needs to be followed by a skit of some kind, so Napolean dances to Canned Heat and is so funny.  Needless to say, he wins the crowd over and Pedro is now elected. <br />I took off a star because there are definately parts where it is slow and stretched out to much, but overall, if you like obscure comedies, then check this out.  It took me a while to see this, but I'm glad now that I have.

B00008WT5J|2.0|Certainly not AC/DC - this is a quick cash-in record. On this soundtrack to Stephen King's Maximum Overdrive, we get three crappy new songs (Title track, instrumentals D.T. and Chase the Ace), as well as a selection of songs that can be found elsewhere: the even-worse Sink the Pink and Shake Your Foundations (Both off of Fly on the Wall) as well as a few older, much-better AC/DC tunes (Ride On, You Shook Me All Night Long, Hells Bells, For Those About to Rock) that are best heard on their original albums (yes, this is worse than For Those About to Rock). And I know that this is supposed to be a pseudo-compilation. In that case, more from the Bon Scott era would be necessary. Avoid.
B000E1ZBH2|4.0|Yes, I guess I'll be saying what most have said, but I'll say it again... NO COLIN FIRTH !  <br />This movie is really splendid visually, and very great acting by all the cast; I think if I'd never seen Colin Firth as Darcy, I'd never be in a position to compare or miss something/someone in this movie... But unfortunately, once you've seen Darcy played by Colin, you just can't help it ! <br />Maybe someone could tell me if the part in this movie was ever even proposed to him???? <br />Apart from all that, I find the movie is of course SUPERIOUR in every way to the BBC mini-series, not only visually, but in the choice of actors, apart from Colin Firth of course ! hehe... <br />The performances are much more \\"natural\\" and subtle, and it's filmed in such a vivacious and beautifully romantic way, that you won't find it hard to be swept away... <br />Even though I've never thought Keira Knightley to be good enough for such a part, I was very pleased, and even Darcy is good, if you don't keep reminding yourself about Colin Firth ! And Donald Sutherland doesn't need to say much to give a very very powerful performance. <br />My all-time favourite Jane Austen movie adaptation is Sense & Sensibility with great Emma Thompson and Kate Winslet and etc... If you haven't seen it, it's a must !

It was during this explanation, He recommended \\"The Inovator's Dilemma\\".  All I can say is that his verbal synopsis was far m ore interesting than this dry two-hour lecture on CD.

B000HBK3MM|4.0|It is hard to get me awe struck, but I heard the track 'Like A Star' prior to its U.S. release and had to order this cd from the U.K. And I tell you when I had the opportunity to hear the rest I was highly impressed. Corrine's balance of jazz, R&B, and blues is absolutely marvelous! I just hope that this isn't a lucky freshman cd and she proves to have some longevity. Her music is a refreshing reminder of how R&B used to be absent of all the predictability and vulgarity that you are bombarded with now. I plead to any DJ that reads this review to take it seriously and get this young lady into rotation if you haven't done so already!
0143036556|5.0|To me Diamond's book \\"Collapse,\\" like his earlier title \\"Guns, Germs, and Steel,\\" is a valuable work of synthesis.  Here he weaves together important patterns of history and science to explain crucial policy choices facing us, in a way that is easily understood by non-specialists.  His work as a populizer of important scientific ideas earns Diamond a place on the concerned citizen's bookshelf, alongside writers such as Stephen Levitt and Carl Sagan. <br /> <br />What caused the societies of Easter Island and Norse Greenland to collapse?  Diamond delves into the evidence to see how environmental damage, climate change, hostile neighbors, trade patterns, and most crucially, these societies' own responses to their challenges shaped their histories.  He offers similar, shorter treatments of several other societies, including both hopeful and alarming examples. <br /> <br />Given the subject's complexity, he bravely and in my view convincingly applies these lessons of history to the question of environmental management in our own day.  As you would guess, they usual suspects are at fault in our environmental problems:  The tragedy of the commons.  \\"It's someone else's problem.\\"  The interests of the decision-making elite in power may be at odds with the long-term interests of society as a whole.   <br /> <br />Diamond's analysis is moderate and balanced in tone, villifying neither big business or environmentalists.  Go check out his arguments; I bet you'll agree. <br /> <br />I saw several one-star reviews below that were similar in style and content.  There must be some sort of letter writing campaign going on to discourage people from reading \\"Collapse\\" -- people with a vested interest in suppressing this important topic?   <br /> <br />I'm sure Diamond wouldn't claim to be perfect in every detail, and would welcome real corrections like the scientist he is.  It is obvious he made a sincere effort to uncover the truth about a complex and important subject.  The resultis a valuable book.
B000FP2Z0S|5.0|I had very high expectations for this album, and they were almost met. <br /> <br />\\"Chamber the Cartridge\\" 10/10: A very good opener, but still not as good as \\"Black Masks & Gasoline.\\" <br />\\"Injection\\" 9/10: Possibly the follow-up to \\"Rumors of My Demise Have Been Greatly Exaggerated,\\" but not as good as the original. <br />\\"Ready to Fall\\" 10+/10: From the first chord, you know this song is going to be amazing.  The lyrics are superb. <br />\\"Bricks\\" 10/10: They can still play pure punk. <br />\\"Under the Knife\\" 9/10: A slightly calmer song.  It's a good change of pace after \\"Bricks.\\" <br />\\"Prayer of the Refugee\\" 10/10: A few simple chords get real addictive. <br />\\"Drones\\" 8/10: The chorus is kind of disappointing. <br />\\"The Approaching Curve\\" 5/10: Call this experimental if you must.  It sounds like somebody reading stream of consciousness poetry with a chorus thrown in. <br />\\"Worth Dying For\\" 7/10: It starts good, and then it just deteriorates. <br />\\"Behind Closed Doors\\" 10/10: This is what I expect from Rise Against. <br />\\"Roadside\\" 5/10: The \\"Swing Life Away\\" / \\"Everchanging\\" track.  Some people like it, but I don't. <br />\\"The Good Left Undone\\" 9/10: This song is missing something lyrically, and I can't quite put my finger on it.  The instrumental at the end is cool. <br />\\"Survive\\" 10+/10: Just like with \\"Rumors of My Demise Have Been Greatly Exaggerated,\\" they close with their best track.  I was wondering why the album had an explicit language warning. <br />\\"Built to Last\\" 7/10: For those fans like me who have to collect every recording, this is a cover of Sick Of It All's \\"Built to Last\\" available on the import version.  I wouldn't recommend it.  Sick Of It All isn't even that good of a band.  Tim's best cover was The Killing Tree's version of \\"Jesus Christ Pose.\\" <br /> <br />Overall, it's a great album, possibly the best album of the year, but it's still not as solid as \\"Revolutions Per Minute.\\" <br />
B000FS9FC6|5.0|We here in the United States have been blessed with the right to tell others what our opinions are concerning politics, religion, and other areas of life. While we may disagree with one another, we are still able to live a free life with our own beliefs and lifestyles.<br /><br />But what if that was not the case? What if, instead of living the way you wish, you had to live the way the government tells you to? What if you lived under totalitarian rule, and to speak out against your government was a crime punishable by death? What would you do then? Would you live in fear, or fight against the oppression?<br /><br />This is the question raised by \\"V for Vendetta,\\" a powerful look at life under total rule, a world similar to George Orwell's \\"1984.\\" The Wachowski Brothers, coming off the success of their \\"Matrix\\" films, have produced a rousing, exciting, and amazing story of one man who decided to fight against the system that left him scarred.<br /><br />Hugo Weaving gives an exceptional performance as V, who uses terrorist tactics against the government, but never against innocent people. Natalie Portman gives another fine performance as Evey, a person whose parents were murdered by the government, and who finds courage with V's help. The rest of the cast, including Stephen Rea and John Hurt, give wonderful supporting performances.<br /><br />The storytelling is fantastic, while the action sequences and visual effects are thrilling and visually-stunning. And while some may question V's actions, his actions rally the people against the corrupt government of Britain in 2020.<br /><br />\\"V for Vendetta\\" is a thrilling film, full of exceptional storytelling, great performances, and thrilling action sequences. Fans of the graphic novel will not be disappointed!<br /><br />Movie/DVD Grade: A-
B000FS9FC6|5.0|This film for me was Sheer Entertainment and needs to be watched at least once, if not more than once a political thriller with all the elements.     This Film is based on the Graphic novel V for Vendetta, written by Alan Moore and illustrated by David Lloyd. The Novel has a comic adult sophistication with an amazing piece of full literature. But I will say if you've read the novel before watching this film get the book out of your head.    V for Vendetta is set in London, Britain in the near-future has been through a nuclear war, an extreme fascist party has arisen called Norefire. This New Fascist Government in the year 2020 holds England in an Iron grip through fear and Propaganda. V who projects himself as Guy Fawkes in this film (Guy Fawkes goes down in English History as a revolutionary who plotted to blow up Parliament with gunpowder in 1605) In this film V is shown in different ways a terrorist to some, a freedom fighter to others, an Anarchist, a Monster, who has ideals. V had been imprisoned, tortured extreme, physical and mentally abused, after surviving he thinks he can bring about great ideas and change in society but on the other hand he has a vengeful vendetta to get back at what society has done to him, a very dark and complex character. V uses his thread of elaborate, theatrical, violence to bring down the government. Will he succeed?    Well done to James Mcteigue who used lighting and angles to give the V mask layers of emotion.  Many serious issues weave through this film that makes you watch this wide eyed, and then out of the blue it lightens and pulls you into its comical/ironic side, it grabs attention, although this is based on a fictional world, fascism portrayed in this film is not far off the mark. Best Film I've seen for a long time. Outstanding cast.    A.Bowhill
0783240236|3.0|I suppose that film buffs have to choose a favorite director, and seem to have settled on the extremely overrated Alfred Hitchcock.<br /><br />This is just not that good a movie.  It is interesting enough to get three stars, but not nearly good enough for four.<br /><br />I don't care very much about any of the characters.  That has to diminish the impact of this movie.  We don't get to know any of the characters particularly well, and what we see, we don't like.  There's a playboy with a glib attitude, who is only out for some womanizing.  How can we like him?  There's a woman prankster, rich, without emotion, lying and playing with people.  How can we like her?  The only ones I can see rooting for in this movie are the birds.<br /><br />Hitchcock's direction of children is inept.  Or to put it more bluntly, he sucks at directing children.  Every scene with a child in it is an embarrassment.  The kids are too goody goody, too well behaved, too quiet, perhaps too proper English.  He seems to have forgotten that this film isn't placed in England.  He seems to not know anything about how real children play and talk and react.  They are just pawns used poorly in a show that really isn't about them.<br /><br />It's not very frightening either.  The characters are sometimes morons.  Why did the Robin Williams type male character decide to stay, rather than leave for San Francisco, when he had the chance?  Why didn't he protect his family by taking them away from danger?  Why did the women and children behave so helplessly and stupidly under bird attack?  Why did they just fall down and cry?  Are women and children that helpless?  Hitchcock thinks they are, apparently.  But a real woman or child would get something to whack the birds with, instead of just going into embryo position and getting pecked at.<br /><br />In any event, I'm not afraid of birds.  Birds are stupid things to make a horror movie about.  If you are going to make a horror movie about birds, make them scarier than they are in this movie.  The movie was a failure.  I wasn't frightened by the stupid birds.<br /><br />In summary, the movie was not scary enough, the characters didn't give us anyone to root for or identify with, some of the directing, involving children, was so bad as to be distracting, and this movie is lucky to get three stars for its overall interest level, because the only other choice is two stars.ake them scarier than they are in this movie.

B0002W18MU|5.0|This is a side to Cash I was not familiar with but it is really a wonderful end to his singing life. His voice may waiver every now and then but it only adds to the powerful sound of that incredible tone we have come to love in his music. It took a while for the difference to sink in but I now consider this CD one of my favorites.
B000A7DVRC|5.0|This is a fabulous film, one that I had rented so many times it was starting to look far more economical to purchase it! <br /> <br />Jeff Labowski's rug is compromised by a thug who mistakens Jeff for a millionaire he is trying to squeeze some money out of. Jeff \\"The Dude\\" sets out on what should be a very simple mission for compensation of his rug. This is when things go awry.  <br /> <br />The Dude becomes involved in a kidnapping rescue mission, meeting ponographer's, a police chief, a child molester, a feminist artist and a teenage runaway on his quest to replce his beloved rug. It really tied the room together, you see. <br /> <br />If you haven't already, you must see this film.
B0000CABJ1|5.0|i love most of the songs on here, but it's the songs that aren't included that really made me a donna summer fan. songs like \\"working the midnight shift\\" and \\"now i need you\\" .... those were the precursors to what we call Techno these days. that said i certainly hope the journey isn't over yet. she deserves to go out with a bang like Cher did with \\"Believe\\" ... but with Donna it should be a pounding rock song to remind people that she was much much more than \\"the queen of disco\\".
B00000K3D4|5.0|This is a magical story about a girl's quest to save her little brother. I think it appeals - or did appeal to so many kids when it was released in 1986 - because so many of us have wished our siblings out of our life.  <br /> <br />When Sarah's brother is taken away from her she realises her mistake in wishing him gone and will go to great lengths to get him back.  <br /> <br />The characters are fabulous, David Bowie is a bit of a sex god, and Sarah Connely is the perfect princess. This film will always be a favourite in my collection.
B000EMGAOY|5.0|With their new album,Stadium Arcadium coming in double discs,The boys from California have never looked better.<br /><br />The Red Hot Chili Peppers(RHCP)have always appealed to me.They never seem to stick to a single theme.The diversity they have never ceases to amaze me.Therefore,I had no problem picking up the new CD when it hit the stores.After listening to all of it I'm convinced that the guys haven't lost their magic.The tracklist consists of 28 tracks.They're in a passable order,not the best.But the songs'll really knock you out.Flea's basslines or John Frusciante guitar prowess havn't diminished.But I can surely say that they have changed their style again.<br /><br />They're laidback as ever,but they seem to be reminiscing their career,magical of course.<br /><br />On the album, the Peppers return to their funk style while still retaining the melodic sound as in By the Way and Californication. The album has overall received positive reviews, and John's skills as a guitarist are clearly evident on the album. As stated on the bonus DVD, John, who usually is a \\"less is more\\" style of guitarist, has gone all out on the album using a full 24 track mixer to display the full range of his guitar arsenal. As always, John has added benevolent backing vocals on the majority of the tracks. In addition to masterminding the guitar arrangements John is so well known for, he has also varied his sound, with guitar stylings ranging from the Blood Sugar Sex Magik days all the way up to By The Way. In short, John Frusciante's innovative techniques and range of playing style are prevalent throughout the album.<br /><br />Remember BloodSugarSexMagik?I don't think there's anyone who's not heard at least a track from there,the favourite being Under The Bridge.Well,they recorded it in a mansion in CA and didn't have much contact with the outside but created such awesome music.It's been a good succession of records since then.<br /><br />Their music can be best savoured by of course,listening to the tracks.Kiedis and the boys deserve all the credit for coming all the way.Kiedis and the boys deserve all the credit for coming all the way. <br />
B0000025DV|5.0|While Eldorado (1974), Face The Music (1975) and A New World Record (1975) are each great recordings in their own right, they are little more than demos compared to the grandiose Out Of The Blue (1978).    Out Of The Blue is a tightly-focused collection that even includes a mini-suite (\\"Concerto For A Rainy Day\\"). Each song stands on it's own. There is no filler.     One of the high points is the Beatles-esque petition to the sun, \\"Mr. Blue Sky\\". But, as outstanding as \\"Mr. Blue Sky\\" is, it's followed by an even better song. When Jeff Lynne sings \\"everything is alright, alright\\" in \\"Sweet Is The Night\\", it gets to me every time.    Unfortunately, the lavish packaging of the original double LP set was not reproduced. Today's listeners are missing out on the detailed interior and exterior paintings which shows the members of ELO in various locations within the spaceship/recording studio. Also originally included was a cardboard spaceship mobile and band poster with lyrics on the back.    Maybe one of these days this classic recording will be given the proper respect it is due.

B0002A2WDQ|5.0|Let's face it - this movie is Mecca for guitarists interested in modern \\"stunt\\" guitar.  The comparison with neoclassical rock (Via) & superbly played slide blues (Cooder) is pure genius.  The quality of actors vary (the blues crowd are convincing to me but Ralph seems to have only two personas - \\"annoyed\\" & \\"down trodden\\").  Steve Via looks a bit wooden whilst in acting mode.  When playing he looks like every cool guitarist in the world wrapped up into one (I've seen all of his commercially available dvd's, as well as live on stage twice).

B00000IQC8|4.0|- REVIEW<br /><br />One way or another, we as people can relate to the Jersey folks in \\"Clerks.\\"  For me, I may not have lived in NJ, or work in a crappy job, or have a girlfriend who gave oral-sex to 37 guys (38 if I was included), but I can understand one key perspective from one of the main characters: life is full of disappointments.  \\"Clerks\\" is not a disappointment, but it is a reminding tale of how disappointments lead to resentment, or at least lead to whining.<br /><br />I find it impossible to give a lengthy opinion to a film like this without hinting any repetition.  What else about this film that hasn't been said already?  Some acknowledge the effort that Kevin Smith has put for this project, through the sacrifice of selling everything he has, and the result leads to this certifiable piece of indie.<br /><br />I do have one constructive criticism about \\"Clerks\\", and I'm sure that's been irked many times, but still that's the one thing which hold the film back from what I think would be truly awesome: the acting.  I don't mean the obvious-amateur audacity of the flaw, it's the script.  The script is smart and cleverly-written, but when people are actually reading the lines, the dialogue is a bit farfetched.  Some characters are alright with their acts, but others act like they're just reading the script and only hastened their performance just to hide that fact.  Randall is sadly one of the others, and though his role is natural, his cohesive monologues are anything but.  Seriously, no one ever talks that like.  Then again, I'm criticizing at people who have no cinematic experience whatsoever.<br /><br />Other than that, \\"Clerks\\" is a likable film with likable characters, if you can handle the harsh obscenity, which it has...a lot.  I certainly like Randall, despite my issue with him, mostly because of his outrageous personality.  He can say whatever he want and do whatever he likes, and he doesn't give a damn about anyone, except for Dante; he's free-spirited in a crass manner and very unapologetic.  He's an a-hole that fans are rooting for.  Dante's not so bad as the other half, his \\"I'm not suppose to be here\\" mentality makes him a relatable character.  This film is just a taste of the \\"snootch-to-the-nooch-ness\\" of things to come, which created the insane iconic duo that is Jay and Silent Bob: say what you will about them, these two won't stop.<br /><br />\\"Clerks\\" dealt not only with Star Wars references that made geeks have nerdgasms, but it dealt with the most thought-provoking subjects ever discussed, like 'not sucking your own ****'.  No wonder the movie was a cult hit in the mid 90s; of course, I was only in elementary school back then, so I didn't know much of it.  But watching the movie proves that to this day, it's still fresh, absurdly funny, and insightful to handle the new generation.<br /><br />This is Del Keyes, saying \\"They might not like us, but we like them.\\"ry unapologetic.

0756603749|5.0|I wanted to let potential readers know that Dawson's book DOES include the Taut-line Hitch, though you might have to know a bit about knots going in to realize it.  The Taut-line Hitch is simply the Rolling Hitch (page 82 in Dawson), with the rope turned back and tied around its own standing end rather than around a pole as Dawson shows it.  Dawson probably could have made that clearer, but it is there. <br /> <br />It's true that it doesn't include the Trucker's Hitch.  It probably should in the next edition.  Dawson does include the Waggoner's Hitch (page 90), which is a slightly inferior but still serviceable knot that performs the same function as the Trucker's Hitch: allowing a line to be quickly tightened to hold a load. <br /> <br />Even given this minor room for improvement, I think this is one of the best books of its kind ever written.  The illustrations are exceptionally clear, the selection of knots is almost ideal, the book itself is small enough to easily pack with you, and its binding is unusually tough and durable for use in the field.   <br /> <br />I think Ashley's Book of Knots is THE knot book, still unequalled after over 60 years.  Yet Ashley's book is so huge and comprehensive that in some ways it is less useful than smaller books such as Dawson's.  Buy Ashley for reference, by all means.  But buy Dawson's book for everday use.
0517548232|4.0|THIS SHOULD BE MANDATORY READING FOR MIDDLE SCHOOL STUDENTS STUDYING THE WW2 ERA and others who have never been exposed to economics but are interested. I highly encourage parents and teachers to add it to their childrens' curriculums.  <br /> <br />That said, this book is not perfect. Rather than \\"Economics in One Lesson\\", it is more like \\"A Series of Economic Fallacies Debunked.\\" Hazlitt does not lay out the basic principles of economics, which could be done in about 5 lessons: 1)self interest, 2) TANSTAAFL (opportunity cost), 3) division of labor, 4) maybe price equilibriums/supply&demand, and 5) maybe something else. Instead, he riffs on some common misconceptions. <br /> <br />The problem with that is: <br />- The fallacies he addresses are not as commonly espoused today as they were in the recent past (WW2 era). Today's interest-party-backed fallacies are much more insidious. <br />Since the 80s free-market capitalism has become more mainstream, so it may be better for novices to dive into a book that lays out the principles of economics as above. Or maybe a more contemporary econ topics book like Steve Levitt's Freakonomics.  <br />- By not laying out the principles backing his critiques, Hazlitt may not have much power to convince those who are misguided (as evidenced by the negative reviews here). <br /> <br />A few comments on those reviews: <br />\\"A look at any number of third world countries will reveal the true outcome of relinquishing government and social controls of the economy.\\" - ironically true.  <br /> <br />\\"Read the rabid ranting temper tantrum of the one reader who amazingly was accepted to the University of Chicago\\" - as a Chicago grad, I can assure you the reputation of some of its professors is not deserved by all of them, nor by all of their students. <br /> <br />To the guy defending the factory-bombing fallacy: please google \\"opportunity cost.\\" <br />To those saying \\"this book is against modern economics, right-wing, etc\\": no. The book applies the basic principles of economics, which are timeless (though still poorly understood).

B00005JP4W|5.0|A brief explanation - I did not intend to go see this movie, I was waiting for it to hit the video stores. Michael Moore's last two releases being an exception, I rarely buy tickets to see documentaries. In fact, I was going to see Superman Returns, in IMAX. The film started out fine, but thanks to the dreadful heat wave that hit New York last week, the air conditioning was turned up as high as it could go in the huge theatre, and five minutes into Superman the power went out. I received tickets to go to any movie that I wanted, and the only thing that was on was this - Al Gore's film about Global Warming. The simple truth of it is, if it wasn't for the effects of Global Warming, I never would have gone and seen this film. Do you think Mr. Gore would have appreciated the irony? <br /> <br />Hats off to Mr. Gore. Gore did not, like so many other failed presidential candidates, let himself be tossed into the trash can of politics; and rather than being content with entering the history books as The Man Who Was Almost President - and let's face it, his loss was particularly painful and controversial as elections go - he found an agenda that is close to his heart and pursues it with all his might. Despite what some Bush-ists might tell you, this is not a Gore propaganda movie; the 2000 elections are referred to very briefly, and he does not linger on it. Instead, he precisely and strongly makes his point. And a good point it is. <br /> <br />An Inconvenient Truth is a wake up call, and it draws attention to a subject that is not generally given remotely enough attention. The United States all too often pokes its nose so deeply into the problems of the whole world, it fails to see the problems at home; the statistics that Gore reveals are staggering and worrying, and it's time somebody took the issue seriously. Is the film biased, are the statistics at times treated in a less than objective manner? Does Gore use at times emotional manipulation to help make himself heard?The answers to these questions are yes. And if that's what it takes, I'm all for it. You might also argue that Gore gives the viewers very little practical advice of what they can actually do to solve the problem. That's true. The sad truth is, an individual can do very little to actually change this frightening reality. But if with this film Gore succeeds, little by little, to raise awareness to the problem and to make just a few more people care and think about it, then little by little it will get better. Eventually, maybe enough people will care that someone in a position of power takes notice, too. If that happens, the film did its job. <br /> <br />An Inconvenient Truth is hardly fun, but I honestly think everyone should watch it. Take no heed of the closed-minded people who say that Gore is dull, charmless or pretentious; he is in fact a highly skilled speaker, incredibly intelligent, with bags of charisma, and also, you'll be amazed, a great sense of humor. I had only two regrets while watching the film: one was that I could not ask Gore any questions - his speech drew me in so deeply. The second was that this man did not become president. I have a hunch we'd all have been better off.

Get this book, don't even think about it. Just grab it and pass it along.

But Reynolds drones on and on about sci-fi baloney that would only interest a physics PhD or a geek that thinks he knows science, coincidence?  I think not.  And where was the editor for this book?  Reynolds writing isn't good enough to spend a couple paragraphs describing a bio `war' at the molecular level.  He may have had some cool new ideas but I couldn't get through all the bio-tech B.S.

But as one reviewer pointed out, Reynolds somehow kept me thinking that something was finally going to happen.  Nothing happened, honestly I couldn't take it anymore and skipped the last 30-40 pages and read the last chapter.  Even that was painful and completely anti-climactic.  But I was determined, just so I could warn you off.
B0000640VN|5.0|Hugh Jackman carries the movie which he's supposed to do in my opinion as a film 'un'educated viewer ...it's his character that's stretched by jumping from nineteenth century gentility into chaotic modern New York. Not that the other major three actors aren't fantastic, they are. Liev Schreiber's comedic timing tickles me to no end, and while Meg Ryan is sometimes typical Meg Ryan (and what's wrong with that?), she also does a great job portraying a jaded, work-wearied career woman who as her character's boss rightly comments \\"doesn't do pretty\\". <br /> <br />The music is great, the dynamics between the actors are like a dance and the scenes flow. Though the film isn't a musical, I get the impression that it is because it melds so well, especially the juxtaposition between the modern discordant imagry/sounds and the sepia-toned dream world past connected by the story and score. <br /> <br />Watch the director's cut. The humor of the descendent/ancestor romance angle isn't at all distasteful to me (it's make-believe comedy for Pete's sake!) and ups the stakes of the plot. <br />
B000BTC5LW|4.0|(this review and others may be found at my blog, [dailyrevolution.net])<br /><br />Last Friday, I stopped by J&R here in NYC to pick up a copy of Pulse, the latest dvd from Pink Floyd. I couldn't find it in the Floyd section of the music bin, so I asked for help. The salesman looked, shook his head in disbelief, and walked away muttering, \\"Third time this week.\\" He called out to someone, announcing that they were out of stock again on Pink Floyd Pulse. Then he turned back to me, saying, \\"I just don't understand it...this is the third order we've gone through this week--check back on Wednesday and we'll have more.\\"<br /><br />Well, having finally gotten Pulse and watched it once, I can't say I share that salesman's astonishment. This is a dvd that deserves to jump off shelves. If you are or ever have been a lover of Pink Floyd's transformative art; if you have ever admired the visuo-sonic splendor of this British band that changed everything in modern music; then you'll most likely want to have this set in your library.<br /><br />The package (I paid $[...] at J&R) contains two dvds and about four hours of content. The featured show is a 1994 concert from Earls Court, London, that has appeared before in VHS and is here remastered, given some additional content, and geeked-out to maximize the Floyd experience.<br /><br />The concert opens with the band's classic overture piece, Shine On You Crazy Diamond, which was originally written as a kind of an appeal, a call back to sanity toward their founder, Syd Barrett, who died last month. For my money, whether you're an auto mechanic, a computer programmer, a painter, writer, or poet--if you have any creative spark within you (and we all by Nature do), this song can be your inspiration.<br /><br />Much of the concert material comes from the band's two albums that are most likely to outlast them by a long stretch: Wish You Were Here and the epoch-making Dark Side of the Moon. DSOM is in fact played in its entirety during the second half of the concert. The extraordinary artist Storm Thorgerson, who created all of the band's album art, contributes video and animation, in collaboration with the Floyd's producer and light man, Marc Brickman. The film is shown on the \\"pupil\\" of the eye-shaped stage, on a circular drop screen bordered, as is the proscenium, by strobes, lasers, and box spots. If, like me, you've had the misfortune of never seeing a Floyd concert in person, then this is likely to be your closest experience of their often breathtaking symphony of music, poetry, film, and light.<br /><br />What's missing on this disk is Roger Waters. If you can't have Pink Floyd without Waters, then perhaps you'll want to pass on this one. But after a few minutes of...you know...wishing he was there; it is very easy to settle into the experience of \\"dry Floyd\\" (without Waters). Gilmour provides inspired performances and solos throughout, and Richard Wright's keyboard work is, under any circumstances, soaringly moving and imaginative.<br /><br />The performances of the material from DSOM alone are worth the price of this dvd. Although the lack of Waters' steely edge is noticeable here and there, it's a very satisfying performance overall, even in Great Gig in the Sky (though it must be added, there will never, ever be another Clare Torry). When they came to the end of Eclipse, I stood up and applauded loudly in my living room--with no one to hear it except my befuddled cat. It is an irresistible impulse: after all, this band received a gift, a visitation such as is rarely encountered, in art or anywhere else, for that matter. Some 40 years after they formed this band and began the process of transforming modern music, watching them perform still stirs the soul. If you listen to Time, Great Gig in the Sky, or Shine On, and aren't moved to the core of your being, then maybe it's time to check your \\"Pulse.\\"rdinary artist Storm Thorgerson, who created all of the band's album art, contributes video and animation, in collaboration with the Floyd's producer and light man, Marc Brickman.

B000E1ZBGS|3.0|We all know that Austen was a woman ahead of her time.  And yes, I enjoyed the '95 version w/ Firth much more than this one.  And it could be an age thing.  The older/mature actors compared to this youthful one which albeit would probably be more appropreiate and to true to the novel.  However, I never connected with this Darcy.  He didn't take my breath away nor did I feel this palable tension of will they or won't they.  I did find a lot of the scenes quite beautiful.  It's worth seeing-especially if you're an Austen fan.
B000000OQF|5.0|When we look back at the moments that chaged the face of music, certain times stick out.  <br /> <br />The Beatles arriving in the US.  <br />Elvis shaking his hips on Ed Sullevin. <br />The Doors on Ed Sullevin singing \\"... girl we couldn't get much higher. <br /> <br />When disco ruled the charts Bruce Springsteen released \\"Born to Run\\" and essentially killed it off.  <br /> <br />As the years pass we look back at 1987 as the point when Glam/Hair Band rock stood all full of make-up, hairspray and bubblegum guitars looking down the barrel of a shotgun known as Appetite For Destruction.  <br /> <br />Almost twenty years later and this GN'R album gets richer and richer. It belongs to stand proudly in the company of Led Zeppelin IV, Dark Side of the Moon, Sgt. Peppers, Revolver, Are You Expreienced? and the like as some of Rock N Roll's greatest albums ever.

B0000004F9|5.0|I just got this records separately and I must say that I was very surprised, I was expecting somethig good but not outstanding from Pink Floyd's 'rival' band in the sixties.  Volume 1 is a psychedelic exploration, the good thing is that is not your typical flower album like Satanic Majesties, Sgt. Pepper or Forever Changes, it is instrumental in most part and is more jazzy than rock. Volume Two continues the evolution towards a more experimental approach musically and instrumentally, in which neither rock nor jazz or psychedelia are predominant, is just The Soft Machine Style.    I can understand some good rock fans not digesting very well this music, a reviewer compared it negatively with Jimy Hendrix; while they indeed are from the same period (they even toured together), this music is a very different league: the guitar is not the main instrument, in fact there is very few of it. There is some of rock, more of jazz, weird keyboards and piano, horns freestyling and excellent drumming; this band, they are all great performers and musicians.    The best thing is that Soft Machine were not reaching for commercial recognition, they followed completely their own artistic rules and that makes this band the very few in a million. Music like this is very rarely made nowdays, highly recommended to fans of classic rock (a la Frank Zappa, Pink Floyd, King Crimon) and fussion / jazz (Miles Davis' Bitches Brew, Jack Johnson tribute; Sun Ra) that do not think the hardcore way.
B00006HBUA|1.0|Loud, obnoxious and generally unfunny live-action adaption of the Hanna-Barbera cartoon.<br /><br />After watching this film I realized that the legendary 80's mega-flop \\"Howard the Duck\\" was almost twenty years ahead of its time. There's very little difference between Scooby-Doo (and most of the other current films of this type) and that classic bomb! Perhaps the only difference is that today this garbage is actually successful and is even considered \\"sequel worthy\\". Also, Just to be fair to Howard the Duck, at least that movie had the visual appeal of Lea Thompson.<br /><br />If your idea of fun is bombastic, poorly produced special effects, a crappy modern soundtrack and a plethora of booger and fart jokes then this is the film for you! Certainly worth checking out if you're a fan of the Scooby-Doo character, but just be prepared to end up wanting two hours of your life back!<br /><br />The sequel deserves the exact same review.<br /><br />-JM
B000E8QVWY|5.0|These days it is difficult to know what you are going to get when you watch a movie from Hollywood.  Is the movie going to be a classic, or a pale copy of a pale copy?  There are no worries about this movie; it is a wonderful overview of Johnny Cash's life that hits the highlights and the feeling of his career without bogging down in excessive details.<br /><br />The movie fast forwards through Johnny Cash's early years, stopping briefly at incidents that had a profound effect on Cash in his adult life.  While little attention is given to details, a viewer quickly gets the sense of how Cash's life was affected by poverty, his brother's tragic accident, and his years in the Air Force.<br /><br />The movie really begins to take off in 1955.  Johnny tries to be several things that he clearly was not.  A chance encounter with a recording studio soon had Johnny launched on the perpetual touring circuit that was required in that era to popularize music.  Unfortunately, the constant touring was a strain on Cash and the temptations of touring, particularly alcohol, drugs and beautiful women, caused Cash's marriage and career to suffer.<br /><br />Moving in and out of Cash's life was June Carter.  June was the opposite of Cash - stable and level-headed.  Fortunate for Cash, who realized early in his career that he loved June Carter, June was always there when he needed her.  This movie ends with an overview of the latter part of Cash's career and marriage to June Carter Cash, again providing impressions and snapshots rather than excessive detail.<br /><br />Johnny Cash was, as many people are, and incredibly complicated person.  It would have been impossible to present the complexities of his life in any detail in two hours.  Director James Mangold went for impressions and key incidents, and we walk away feeling that we understand the person of Johnny Cash.  Mangold leaves lots of room for others who wish to fill in the vast detail of Cash's life, but Mangold has provided the outline and all the detail necessary for the critical early part of Cash's career.<br /><br />In addition to hitting only the highlights, which keeps the movie moving along briskly, the choice of actors was outstanding.  Joaquin Phoenix proves that his acting talents are as good as or better than those of his peers.  Reese Witherspoon proves that her acting talents have been underutilized in light comedy as she makes the role of June Carter Cash all her own.  Even more incredible, both actors sang the music you hear in the movie.  Considering particularly that Cash had a very unique voice, Phoenix was very brave in attempting the songs, and his outstanding effort helps make his role multi-dimensional.<br /><br />To further lend support for the quality of this movie, it received 26 awards, including an Oscar, and was nominated for another 20 awards.<br /><br />Hollywood seems fixated on glitzy special effects movies with mega-million dollar budgets and plots that exist only to support the special effects.  \\"Walk the Line\\" is a rare movie that reminds us all that Hollywood can still make a great movie that will appeal to those of us that like to hear stories of average people that became winners.  \\"Walk the Line\\" is one of the best movies of 2005, and is likely to be one of the best movies of the first decade of the new millennium.  Enjoy!vided the outline and all the detail necessary for the critical early part of Cash's career. <br /> <br />In addition to hitting only the highlights, which keeps the movie moving along briskly, the choice of actors was outstanding.

B00018D3RI|5.0|Isn't it fun to watch again a show you used to like as a teenager and discover it still holds up to this day?STARSKY and HUTCH belongs to that category.It is not only because of the GRAN TORINO ,which became a cult item for collectors.If you remember 1975-76,we had lost IRONSIDE,MANNIX and HAWAI5-0 was starting to wind down when those two cops arrived on the scene.Sure we had KOJAK,but STARSKY and HUTCH were younger and could really compete physically with the criminals and chase them everywhere.We had HUGGY BEAR for comic relief,DOBEY the captain who has a strange fixture towards food and often interrupts STARSKY's meals ,who is himself a fast food addict.Mostly,STARSKY and HUTCH had great chemistry and as the season progress ,you also discover the human side of their characters.Although they are heterosexuals,there are some homosexual overtones in some of their scenes together that completely eluded me back then.It is funny sometimes to discover how time changes perception.STARSKY and HUTCH season 1 is worth buying and you'll get to see the guys on disc 5 discussing their characters and the producer,creator and writers about the genesis of the show.

B00009RDGA|5.0|One of my favorite movies of all time.  Tatum O'Neil richly deserved her Oscar for this.  She steals the show as a hard-nosed realist and no-nonsense type dealing with her guardian's flakey, get-rich schemes.  Both funny and moving, it's not only a great story but a powerful period piece about Depression-Era Kansas. Caveat: while the star is a child this movie contains adult material and is not suitable for viewing by children.

B000F7CMRM|2.0|Let me say this straight out... the movie is fictional. For me to try and understand, truly understand, how corrupt business and politicians have hijacked our foreign policy by watching this movie, would be like trying to understand the dogma of the Catholic church by watching another work of fiction, \\"The Da Vinci Code\\". <br /> <br />Are we Americans so stupid in our understanding of international history, and the currents and eddies behind world events, they must be explained to us through fiction? If so, we deserve our current predicament, which should only worsen our ignorance. <br /> <br />I challenge filmmakers to educate us with accurate portrayals of history. OK, so these movies may not have headliner opening weekends. But truth will educate throughout the years, and a movie true to history will continue to teach even when it sits on the DVD
B000FVBLEI|5.0|Most bands release their best album first. All That Remains on the other hand have improved dramticly on every album. The Fall Of Ideals is no exeption. Lets start from the first track The Calling. Hit play and you are floored by a tumultous double bass flurry. Right off the bat proving ATR arnt messing around this time. Phil Labonte has matured emensly on this album. He has the death growls, the solid clean range, the harde edged thrashy vocal and the I stole my throath from sweden or norway shriek. One reviewer called this an emo scream. No in the slightest. He needs to get out more. The songs are very well constructed. Adding the right amount beautiful twin guitar harmonies to contrast the almost thrash quality of agressive riffing and swedish melo death flair. The solos are brilliantly played and expertly placed. Here you listen to guitarists writing solos as opposed to just wailling. Are their clean vocals? absolutly. But they fit like a glove on most tunes.There are some where they dont IE Six. As opposed to the tunes they do fit. Not Alone,wispers..... The songs are stripped down and overall far more aggressive than this darkened heart, or behind silence and solitude. Now to compare this album to a Killswitch record other than the fact that Adam D worked his mastery behind the boards on this exellent piece of work is just way off base. This does not sound like a Killswitch record. You hear more maidenesque harmoines than In Flames on this. There are solos  on every tune. The drumming is far more varied and complex. And to top it off Howard or Jesse are hard pressed to match the range of Phil Labonte. To say that because they added mellow vocals on every track they are going commercial is ludacris. I dont see three 2 ballads on the cd. IE Shadows Fall and The War Within. I dont see anyone saying Shadows Fall sold out for having melodic vocals on every track? Vocals can be melodic and not be clean.This cd is its own. No question about that. Those who try to lump them in with others like KSE and ShadowsFall simply dont have the metal vocabulary to find bands other than the two front runners. And please keep in mind ATR came about before KSE. When Phil was still in Shadows Fall. This album solidifies All That Remains rightful place with the best of the genre. Dont be dissillusioned by those who claim they went trendy or soft. They havent. This is a must have. So go get it.
B00005JOML|1.0|I never watched the TV series.  But I was interested in the film because I tend to like action movies with bad guys and good guys and a fast plot.  There's star power here too with Jamie Fox, Colin Farrell and Li Gong, and a well known director, Michael Mann.  It's also fun to go to a film on its opening night when every seat is taken in the theater.  Alas, though, the anticipation I felt was the best part of this particular film-going experience.<br /><br />The plot involved our heroes working with the FBI to catch some high-profile drug dealers.  The plot, however, was impossible to follow.  The dialog was mumbled.  And the film editing was cut too fast and produced scenes that didn't make any sense.  To top it all off, it was just plain boring.  There were a couple of romances, of course, but they didn't have any chemistry.  And, basically, I just didn't care.  There were a lot of fast boats and mean bad guys and an inept FBI.  And, in the end, the crime was solved to the characters' satisfaction.  But by then it didn't matter whether or not I ever followed what was happening.  I was just glad that it was over.<br /><br />This film didn't work, plain and simple.  And I wouldn't recommend it to even the most ardent of action-film fans.  Don't waste your time or money.
B000FGGE68|4.0|Ultra Violet is an allegory about how a totalitarian regime creates a social class of scapegoats -- in this case, the hemophages or \\"vampires\\" -- upon whom it blames all social ills in the relentless, cold quest for absolute political power. Milla Jovovich is intense, stylish and effective and surprisingly touching as the hemophage woman willing to sacrifice everything for a little boy who could be the savior of her diseased people. Visually stunning and highly recommended.
B000002KKD|4.0|I bought this record back in 1979 or 1980 and I loved it for it camp sensibility, catchy pop and danceable tracks. This is a FUN album with great songs, especially \\"Planet Claire\\" and \\"Dance This Mess Around\\". Turn the volume on these tracks and blast back to New Wave interpretations of early 60's pop.
B000FS9FCG|5.0|V for Vendetta calls into question our post 911 assumptions about war, society, politics, culture and human relations. Ever think about conspiracy theories?

Ever wonder what the difference between a terrorist and a freedom fighter is? Ever wonder where governmental protection stops and totalitarianism begins? Ever think about what it would feel like not to live in fear? This film is highly recommended. It is an allegory of our times and our potentially dangerous future. YOU MUST SEE THIS FILM.

0446677450|1.0|Robert Kiyosaki's \\"Rich Dad, Poor Dad\\" is a poor story on 2 different styles of investing. I say poor because the book shows an almost visible disgust for his hard working poor dad and a fawning admiration of his rich dad instead of offering just financial advice.     But the title is clever and is designed to get you to pick up the book. Most people looking for a way out of financial trouble will snap this up because of the clever marketing. Too bad the contents don't live up to the hype     Most of what Kiyosaki says about passive income is just recycled material you can find in other books. His constant bragging on what he has attained through his methods which involve Mostly Real Estate buying makes you wonder if he realizes that money isn't the only key to happiness.     It would make a good novel if Kiyosaki as the man recieving advice realized what he was missing by concentrating on money so hard. Unfortunately this isn't fiction.     While this may seem a rather strange review for a financial book if you read between the lines this seems to me to be nothing more than a cleverly marketed book recycling old advice. If this is the way to wealth forgive me but I will stay poor and keep my self respect.

0141301066|5.0|A reader always wonders how many more masterpieces Roald Dahl would've created had he not died from leukemia in 1990 at age 74. This belovedly candid children's author, who writes in the intro, \\"Bring us a basin! We're going to be sick!\\" on parents who brag about the \\"brilliance of their own revolting offspring,\\" delights in meting out justice to characters with befittingly bad names such as Miss Trunchbull.<br /><br />When young Dahl himself was a lad of 8, according to a bio, he and four friends \\"were caned by the headmaster after putting a dead mouse in a jar of sweets in a sweet shop owned by a 'mean and loathsome' old woman called Mrs. Pratchett.\\"<br /><br />This could be a synopsis of his future books, where a tiny innocent child is pitted against a monstrous grownup who will eventually get his comeuppance due to the superior wisdom of the child and necessary allies met along the way.<br /><br />As an American adult, I love learning through Dahl about the UK, the language and customs, as well as the daft British sense of humor so well portrayed in BBC comedies.<br /><br />Delightfully unpredictable, this 240-page book was written toward the end of Dahl's prodigious writing career. A true genius in character study, plot and ambience, he keeps even the most sophisticated of readers surprised and delighted and laughing out loud at what the main character cooks up in her satisfying search for revenge.

B000059TPN|5.0|As an inmate of The Rock for a good number of years, Sean Connery's fictional character knows the place all too well which was also home to thousands of real life convicts for decades.  The Rock of course is the colorful name for Alcatraz Prison sitting high on a rocky island in San Francisco bay.  Now a national landmark and tourist attraction, Alcatraz has been the focus of the public's fascination for years and The Rock wasn't the first movie set in the humongous penitentiary.  But it's arguably the most exciting one and certainly it's the most expensively produced.  The Rock serves as high gloss, high octane entertainment which works as a thunderous action packed popcorn movie, but also as an indictment of America's treatment of war veterans and \\"enemies of the state\\".  In many ways, the issues in the film couldn't be more topical.  We still have a major military presence in Iraq and our treatment of veterans and enemies is coming under fire with the Abu Gharab debacle and the like, along with the less than shocking revelation of the existence of \\"secret prisons\\" where American intelligence agents detain, debrief and interrogate enemy operatives.  The controversy has boiled over and now has political leaders discussing a major overhaul of the way in which the USA fights wars.  Is it at the expense of basic human rights?  Is the Geneva convention regarding such issues being violated or just being misinterpreted?  Director Michael Bay's movie never tries to answer any questions, but they always loom large in the background as the intriguing story unfolds.<br /><br />Maybe I should say four stories:  Nicholas Cage and Connery share protagonist duties equally while Ed Harris shines as the sympathetic antagonist as they collide against the backdrop of terrorism and mass kidnapping fueled by desperate mercenary mindsets.  The screenplay skillfully balances the three men's fascinating lives and each story could easily hold a film on its own.  Cage plays Goodspeed, a scientist first and federal agent second.  He's a biochemical weapon's expert whose education and chemical expertise both eclipse his necessity for carrying an FBI badge and using a firearm.  He's not quite a geek, but he's no Elliot Ness.  There's more than an element of Fox Mulder in him - the brainy, paranormal expert of X-Files fame.  But while Mulder never could get the family thing together, Cage's girlfriend is pregnant and they're on the verge of marriage.  When Goodspeed is ordered into action after a group of ex US soldiers steal several missiles armed with deadly VX gas, Goodspeed must leave his girlfriend immediately after she gives him the good news about her impending stork visit.<br /><br />Ed Harris plays a highly decorated war veteran whose outrage at the manner in which the US handled his men's deaths and how their families were treated has brought him into the darkest of decisions and perhaps over into insanity.  He leads the mercenary group who steals the VX missiles and then proceeds to take an Alcatraz tour group hostage to ransom the US government of millions of dollars.  His motive so he says his financial restitution to the family's soldiers who died under his watch and weren't treated fairly by the country they helped to protect.  It's a difficult role and one which could be played too broadly.  Harris makes the character into a true human being, never a two dimensional villain.  His character is torn between his high moralistic value regarding his fallen subordinates and the savage terrorist action he has masterminded.  The conflict tears him up and Harris plays up all the emotions like the master thespian he always shows us.<br /><br />Sean Connery plays a kind of older Bond without benefit of gee whiz gadgets or a license to kill - but kill he does.  Even at his age, his larger than life presence and demeanor make you firmly believe he could snap your neck with little effort and do it gracefully and with class.  Most of Connery's scenes are with Cage and their chemistry definitely works.  Connery's character is beyond bitter for is treatment at being hidden away in a federal prison after being an inmate of Alcatraz years before.  He's still treated as a dangerous enemy of the state even now and his quietly controlled anger at his situation explodes at just the right moments.  After a promise of release and clearing his name, he agrees to help.  He's really the only one left alive or willing to aid the strike force assembled to free the civilians now inmates themselves of Alcatraz.<br /><br />The supporting cast is stellar and includes Michael Biehn and David Morse, both consistently solid and always more than watchable.  Morse especially brings a quiet sadness to his roles and this one is no different.  He's loyal to his commander, yet almost as torn as Harris over the sticky moral implications of their actions.  Biehn a veteran of James Cameron actioners like The Terminator, Aliens and The Abyss plays the military leader of the strike force which Cage and Connery must assist in freeing the hostages and dealing with Harris and his soldiers.<br /><br />The Rock's visual FX are a mix of old and new.  It was filmed during the time of Hollywood's greater reliance of digitally produced opticals.  The result was so well conceived and executed that a special episode of the cable series MOVIE MAGIC was devoted entirely to the film.  In one of the stirring finale scenes, Nicholas Cage is slumped over barely able to stand while framed overhead by two high powered air force jets as they streak across the sky  At the time. it surprised viewers to learn the aircraft were created totally by artists in a computer.  It gave a clear glimpse into today's movie world which relies almost exclusively on computer generated images for more expensive FX demands or ones nearly impossible to achieve through other means.  There are 3 versions of the rock on DVD a bare bones movie only, a studio special edition release and thenthere's The Criterion Collection version.  Criterion treats the movie to an excellent 2 disc set complete with informative audio commentary and the aforementioned Movie Magic episode.<br /><br />The Rock is definitely more of thinking man's action movie.  It moves along at an electric pace, never fails to deliver the thrills and it's 2 hours and 15 mins running time never lags.  But where some action thrillers merely offer up snappily executed set pieces with little story or character, The Rock embraces its plot and characters.  The motivations behind them are believable and genuinely performed.  Michael Bay would go on to give us Armageddon and Pearl Harbor and most recently The Island.  He's a director whose popular tastes and sensibilities don't always translate well with audience and critics.  With The Rock however, it's safe to say he's successful in pleasing most any viewer or critic alike.
B0002IQEHI|5.0|Certainly one of the great classics of alltime and proof positive that they don't make movies like this anymore! From the instant when the dazzling 3-D artdeco credits appear, we're onboard for the ride of our lives, actually the lives of hero Cary Grant (1904-86) and Eva Marie Saint. The plot of this 100 percent attention-keeper thickens as its characters sicken. Notable in the glorious cast are the handsomely ignoble James Mason (remember him? 1909-84) and ever-dapper Leo G. Carroll (who later played the ghost in the TV series Topper). Superbly angled cinema shots feature lush hotel interiors - the elegant UN - an aerial shot of ant-tiny Cary Grant in existential torment against desolate grasslands - and closeups of Mount Rushmore, which Hitchcock had dreamt of shooting, here becoming a backdrop of life-and-death drama. Of the 50-some films of Sir Hitchcock (1899-1980) I'd rate this in the top three, with Psycho and Rebecca rounding out the bases.
B00078XGRO|5.0|In science fiction, most anything can happen and in time travel most anything routinely happens.  In Star Trek, it's nearly guaranteed something fun, engaging and uplifting will happen.  With Star Trek: First Contact, these high expectations are met to the fullest.<br /><br />Although released in late November 1996, the movie plays like a big summer popcorn flick.  From the dark opener, a chilling nightmare flashback suffered by Captain Picard recalling his time under the influence of alien invaders, to space battles, to combat which explode aboard the starship, the movie delivers incredible action on all fronts.  The Borg is the enemy the valiant Enterprise crew must defeat.  Borg can be best described as 'cybernetic zombies' - an effective cross between Resident Evil like shambling creatures and wired in Matrix like cyborgs.<br /><br />This was the second feature film based on The Next Generation TV show.  Despite the polished romp of the previous film Generations, the Next Gen crew's first, in many ways First Contact comes off as their debut.  Generations relied on Captain Kirk as an important linchpin of its plot and the TNG crew were almost glorified guest stars in their own film.  Here they are more confident and committed.  Maybe it's even the fact that the TV Starship was destroyed in the last film.  As great as it was to see our heroes walking around the old sets of the show, at times it felt like a pricey two part episode.  With a new ship, new uniforms and a newly designed Borg - complete with a weirdly seductive leader, The Borg Queen, First Contact allowed the new generation to stand on its own.  Co-stars James Cromwell and Alfre Woodward sparkle as scientists intent on launching the first warp drive capable ship from the ashes of a planet whose populace exist in a sad twilight world of grimy shanty towns with only faint traces of planet Earth's former glory.<br /><br />The optical FX provided by ILM remain some of the most convincing Star Trek footageever realized.  This was the first Star Trek movie to broadly use digital ships.  Models are still used in the film, however it's nearly impossible to distinguish them from the digital.  A main set piece - perhaps the film's most electrifying moment  - not counting the Borg Queen's fantastic entrance - consists of dozens of Starships battering a Borg Cube with everything they have and then some.  It's in this moment that we see more Starship designs at one time than in practically any other Star Trek moment, although the finale of Deep Space Nine which aired three years later, may indeed rival this incredible battle.  Granted, it's a rather short engagement, but the spectacular visuals leave a great impression of just how powerful Starfleet can be and maybe more importantly that a Borg Cube stands nearly impregnable.<br /><br />Alice Krige arguably steals the movie.  She \\"brings order to chaos\\" as she explains to a puzzled captive Data who wonders how the massive amount of Borg thoughts could ever be controlled by one entity.  Krige's Oscar nominated make-up and her truly other worldly performance are real highlights of this outing.  I've watched her entrance a dozen times and it still leaves me in awe.  Krige does more with her voice and eyes than most actors do with their entire bodies.  Her portrayal ranks up there with many of the most compelling Star Trek villains or villains period in film history.<br /><br />The DVD brims with fun and informative extras.  This is one you'll pop in many times.  First Contact lives up to its name in more ways than one.  It's the first Star Trek movie to show how humanity became a space faring civilization which would lead to the birth of the Federation, the first to showcase a new Starship design along with new uniforms in quite sometime.  It's also the first Star Trek movie to be released on DVD and the first one I ever watched or purchased.  The Borg Queen really was wrong, this isn't the end of the future - but the beginning.
B00005JNTX|4.0|5 stars for Style, but only 3 stars for Content. <br /> <br />Visually stunning and with enough gross-out moments to throw your stomach out the window, but the characters lack depth and crediblity. <br /> <br />The three main characters are virtually the same:  lone vigilantes ready to sacrifice all in a killing spree to avenge a woman who they love.  Unfortunately, in each case the woman is someone who they either don't know at all or have only just met - so as motivation this is totally unbelievable. <br /> <br />Frank Miller's Dark Night Returns had a lot more depth than this.  Perhaps Miller is running thin on ideas and is repeating himself.  If the two planned Sin City movie sequels are made, perhaps he will redeem himself with a broader range of character types with more depth and believability.
B00003CXAW|5.0|King Kong remains the most entertaining cautionary tale on the \\"civilized world's\\" encroachment upon the wild untamed regions of our planet.  Today's rainforests, frozen tundra and the old growth forest which disappear at a frightening rate could be seen as real life equivalents of Kong's mythical birthplace - Skull Island.  Despite substantial age and the \\"quaint\\" handmade optical FX, it's a film which still dazzles in a purely escapist way, but also communicates to each generation more complexity on many levels.  Perhaps its most effective subtext lies in the simple  discovery of a beast too fantastic for the movie folk who find him to resist capturing and then the ultimate horror as they helplessly witness his untimely and thoroughly senseless murder.  Global history is littered with too many unfortunate instances! of modern man clashing with the primitive world from which he sprang.  Often the results end disastrously for the primitive tribe or the once untouched terrain which becomes spoiled by the tireless march of modern society and ever expanding progress.  The clear message:  Don't fool around with things you don't understand or control - especially where precious life is concerned.<br /><br />Kong numbers among many a film lover's favorite film and often it's numbered as the first one remembers watching as a child.  Maybe it's the larger than life size of Kong and his incredible battles with the equally impressive fantastical denizens of his tropical home which leaves a mark at an impressionable age.  But Kong isn't just for the kiddies.  Why doesn't the fascination ever end?  Adults are just as captivated by the big ape's saga and become just as transported as kids by the rousing adventure and touching finale.  And speaking of finales - Kong's shocking demise ranks as one of the most memorable and powerful finishes of any movie.  In his desperate bid to escape his tormentors, Kong journeys up the very symbol of man's dominance over his natural world carrying the closest thing to a friend and companion only to die at the cold dispatch of a few noisy toys.  Kong heroically survived brutal clashed! s with the most dangerous life on Skull Island, only to be felled by the lethal toys of war - our weapons of death.<br /><br />Much has been said about the groundbreaking animation which brought Kong to life and when experienced in this crystal clear print and clear soundtrack, it's obvious the artistry of Willis O'Brien who pioneered the stop motion process has stood the test of time.  While more modern stop motion efforts such as Tim Burton's efforts or Nick Park's Chicken Run are beautifully realized, they're more cartoon and comic like.  Here we have primal savagery - a true lost world found and there's something about the raw power and energy of the Kong scenes that have never really been equaled.  Ray Harryhausen, Willis O'Brien's prot&eacute;g&eacute; who would go on to assist him on Mighty Joe Young and become an FX stop motion master in his own right has often said that Kong's stop motion is still the indisputable King.<br /><br />Let's not forget the human cast.  Fay Wray and Robert Armstrong make the non Kong scenes more than worthwhile.  Each are fine actors and the dreamy pristine beauty of Wray is the perfect counterbalance to Kong's fearsome though magnetic beast.  Armstrong's Denham, while loud and blustery never comes off as truly villainous.  He's not shy or one to mince words, but he's almost cuddly when making demands of his crew.  Even the island native extras and Chief come across as more authentic than many of the throwaway stereotypes of those less than enlightened days of Hollywood.<br /><br />So maybe Beauty killed the Beast, but we'll happily continue to resurrect him.  No matter how many new versions pop up down the pike, this original will always reign alone as King in a class all by himself.
B000EWBNMS|1.0|Complaining, whinning, mumbling, beer drinking, bathtub soaking, unattractive Alison and her overgrown, teenage hairstyled, beer drinking kid of a husband and their apy middle daughter.  The most horrible series I've seen on TV, in the end Alison seems to \\"solve\\" whatever the problem is but it's not worth the watch. No one in my family enjoyes this show.
B000BB1MI2|2.0|How do you receive a remake of one of the most beloved family movies of the last three decades?  A movie rerun each year on TV as a special event and boasts a fanbase as close in number or at least as fanatically dedicated to that of say The Wizard of OZ or It's A Wonderful Life.  I guess you tread carefully for both the original's and new version's sake.  Afterall, both movies are based on Roald Dahl's children's book and so both are merely filmed interpretations of written material.  However the Gene Wilder one is a cherished classic all over the world, so obviously Tim Burton's Charlie & The Chocolate Factory was in for some definite close scrutiny.<br /><br />How does it stand up?  Fairly well.  The film's fantasy look is beautiful.  Especially well realized is Charlie's family's bleak shack of a house.  When the chocolate contest is announced and Charlie's grandfather comments that only rich fat children will win because their families can afford chocolate daily and considering Charlie's family only can afford to buy him a chocolate bar once a year on his birthday, not only do we pity the boy, but we firmly believe the statement because of the spot on art direction.  Charlie's family is so poor, they can't even afford a proper door to the house - it visually screams poverty at us every time it's opened because it's cut into the wall at a cartoon crazy like angle.  Burton's animator's penchant for the bizarre is still very much alive and always welcome.  And since the story is basically a big fantasy, we buy it and love it.<br /><br />The cast is all more than competent, but none ever approach the sweetness, mischievousness or outright brattiness of say the actress who played the original Veruka Salt.  They serve their roles nicely, but that's all.  Charlie's is a strong performance, but again since the movie is ultimately really not about him, you're left not really caring.  And last but not least there's Johnny Depp.  Sigh... Ok here goes.<br /><br />I like Johnny Depp.  I really do.  I like him in everything he does.  He's one of the most versatile actors around and he never bores me.  He picks fun, intelligent and just great movies to be a part of and Charlie & The Chocolate Factory certainly is well produced and directed.  However, his performance is uneven and ultimately I feel he's been miscast.  There was a quiet authority in Wilder's performance which always made you believe he was in charge - albeit in a wacky way.  Depp feels a pretender to the throne, not only inheriting the role, but in just our belief in him being a candy magnate.  We don't buy it.  He seems more akin to the childlike pop star he's denied mimicking for the role.  The bottom line for me is Depp's performance never takes off, it never soars.  He's always just ok or slightly amusing.  There's little depth to the character as written, so that should be stated as well, however what he is given he does very little with.  Wilder's explosive condemnation of the children's behavior and most specifically Charlie's at the original's finale shocked us and was believably powerful.  Here we have a ho-hum sort of conclusion which then turns into a schmaltzy family reunion.  It nearly reminds one of Scrooge's redemption at the close of A Christmas Carol, but what a dull Scrooge this Wonka is throughout his journey.<br /><br />How about listening pleasure?  The original while not a true musical had several memorable musical numbers and catchy tunes.  Some so popular they hit the pop charts and have become classics themselves - most notably \\"The Candy Man Can\\"  These tunes served to push the story forward and were entertaining.  Danny Elfman's music for Burton's version is alright, however it's restricted only to the oompah loompahs and feels almost out of place here.  I think Burton should have either gone with more music like the original or none at all.  This half hearted attempt never gets your feet stomping or hands clapping and basically falls flat on asour note.<br /><br />Honestly, I expected much more from Burton's treatment and will definitely only watch one version of Dahl's popular story when I'm in the mood for a Wonka chocolate fix.  I just hope there's room for both versions now.  I'd hate to have this one take the original's place and be the one to watch each year as an event movie.  Of course, those days may indeed be over with so many ways to watch and time-shift films.  And not to get maudlin, but maybe film's way of stoking our imagination is over too.  Burton's version clearly shows us everything that happens - to the children, to Willy - there's nothing left to mystery or our limitless imaginations.  Let me end this review with a quote from the original.  And let me greatly thank Gene Wilder for truly one of the greatest characters ever seen and enjoyed in film and pop culture.<br /><br />\\"Pure Imagination.\\"
B000FMGTTE|5.0|As iconic as the Superman character is, John Williams' score from 1978 is equally so.  Instead of devising an entirely new theme like Hans Zimmer did in last summer's  \\"Batman Begins,\\"  John Ottman and company opted to keep Williams' theme and build around it. <br /> <br />The opening theme on track one is very similar to Williams', but offers a more powerful, updated feel.  Due to the movie's emotional nature, several tracks measure up and blend in nicely.  Including  \\"Little Secrets/Power of the Sun\\"  (4),  \\"How Could You Leave Us\\"  (6) and  \\"Not One of Them\\"  (8).  The tracks which feature most of the drama and action are nicely arranged as well; including some of the Luthor movie scenes.  The sountrack ends appropriately with the ending sequence and fly away  (15). <br /> <br />A large part of cinema is the usage of music, and if you enjoyed this summer's  \\"Superman Returns,\\"  Ottman's score probably had something to do with it.  This is well worth adding to your collection.
B0002OERI0|5.0|To all the bands I titled my review is the bands that are legends. <br />American Idiot is one of my favourite CDs. I love Jesus of Suburbia, and Holiday...those are the best. Boulevard of Broken Dreams is overplayed!!!!! But anyway, get this album along with the legends and please read Metallica Rocks Really Hard's review.
B00005JOMN|1.0|We expected better than this!  The color was dull. At times we couldn't understand what was being said.  The plot was choppy and hard to follow. Not an \\"A\\" movie, more like a \\"B\\" grade movie.
B00004Y6NX|4.0|This is a good album from Dire Straits. But not the best one... <br />The best song is probably Espresso Love as best!! I'll give it 4 because Espresso Love is one of my favourite DS tunes ever.
B000BVQ9JO|5.0|This is their best album, and it isn't even close. The first 7 tracks on the album are enough to make a person go \\"Hooray!\\" Mediocre songs like \\"Electricityscape,\\" can't hinder the remaining tracks. I've never heard a greater guitar solo than Albert going insane on \\"Vision of Division.\\" Nick and Julian on \\"Ask Me Anything\\" is an instant classic, so stop hating on the remnents of Room On Fire. Room On Fire was actually a better album than Is This It, if you look in terms of commercial success. First Impressions Of Earth will likely be their least publicized album, but everyone in the band stepped their game up. Also, \\"Heart In A Cage\\" is probably their best song since \\"New York City Cops.\\"
B000002H2H|5.0|Hey look at me. I'm orginally from Metallica Ride the Lightning. <br />I'm one of your favorite songs, huh!!!! Anyway, Ride the Lightning <br />is great. Get this with Master of Puppets and Black Album today.
B00005JM0B|2.0|I found this movie to be a big disappointment.  For the first time in a terminator film, I felt bored for about the first 20-30 minutes.  Terminator 3 certainly has a much different feel to it.  It seemed to be a semi-comedy with some action thrown in there so it might resemble a terminator film.  The great music from the first two films that gave the terminator series a feeling of darkness?  That's been thrown out, despite the fact that it worked so well before.  And what about the comedy?  Well, if you think lines like \\"We need a new vehicle\\" and \\"She'll be back\\" are funny, then this film might be for you.  However, I didn't hear much laughing when I saw it in the theater.    Another thing I felt for the first time was annoyance.  I was very shocked and disappointed at how weak John Conner was.  Throughout the film he spends a lot of time whining, running, and saying dumb things.  For example, at one point in the film Conner whines because he has to teach the T-101 everything all over again.  Well, duh.  Like Arnold's character said, that was a different terminator.  Another example is when Conner sticks a gun to his head and threatens to kill himself.  Dumb, dumb, dumb.  Moreover, Conner is poorly educated.  I don't even think he possess a high school education.  He does, however, manage to get himself locked in a cage.  I don't know about you, but I wouldn't want someone like him to be a world leader.  Some people might think that it's okay for Conner to be a regular guy, but they're missing the point.  He isn't supposed to be a regular guy.  He is supposed to be John Conner.  In any case, even if Conner was more like his father, or more like his mother in Terminator 2, I wouldn't complain about him as much.    Conner even looks like he could be a wimp.  He looks a bit too short and skinny.  In other words, Conner looks like he never even spent a day of his life in a gym.  I don't think he spends any time fighting in the film at all.  He just runs away and hopesthat Arnold can protect him.  Throughout most of the movie, the woman he is interested him shows no interest in him.  If he struggles so much to impress a woman who isn't even attractive, I'm baffled as to how he could impress the rest of the world enough to become their leader.  As a result of all this, I think I'll just go with what Conner said in the film:  \\"Look at me, I'm no leader, I never was, I'm never gonna be!\\"    I also had a problem with the villain in the film.  She didn't look frightening enough to be a villain.  In the first two terminator films, the T-101 and T-1000 looked like something a person would want to run away from.  In Terminator 3, the T-X looks like something that someone would want to go to bed with.  Some teenage boys might get a thrill out of seeing brief nudity on TV, but other than that, she adds nothing to the film.  This isn't an adult film, it's a terminator film.      There were a few other things I didn't like about the film.  I had a problem with some of the dumb coincidences.  For example, Kate Brewster turns out to be the daughter of the general who activates Skynet.  Uh, yeah.  And that adds what to the movie?  Also, a message that keeps getting repeated is \\"It is inevitable.\\"  Why is it inevitable?  I also didn't like the part where Arnold is a good guy, then turns into a bad guy, then struggles for awhile before becoming a good guy again.  That makes the story less believable, and it looks dumb.  Another gripe I had is the film keeps making fun of the terminator series.  Even if the goal was to be funny, I thought that was unnecessary.  Terminator 2 added in some lines that were funny, and they didn't make fun of any characters or terminator movies.    Despite my low opinion of Terminator 3, it isn't the worst film ever.  Thus, I won't give it one star.  However, this film would be much better with some major changes made to it.  While there are some people who like Terminator 3, there are an awful lot of people who thinkit stinks, and many people who hate Terminator 3 love the first two films of the terminator series.  I don't think this should be ignored.  I don't like to give out ratings of three stars or more unless I'm pleased with the product.  I'm not pleased with Terminator 3.    If I wanted to destroy the terminator series, I probably would come up with a movie like this one, which makes fun of the terminator films without being funny.  Some people will say that it's hard to follow up Terminator 1 and 2, so I should be more lenient with number 3.  I disagree.  Before they even worked on this film, Mostow and the writers already had a lot of the story and a good number of characters to work with.  That's a lot easier than starting from scratch like Terminator 1 did.  Mostow could even copy a lot of things that worked in the first two movies, but he didn't even do that.  The bottom line is this movie has too many major flaws to ignore.  Add to that the fact that I found it somewhat boring, and it's definitely not a good film in my opinion.
B00008BXJG|1.0|Urggh!!! This is even worse than the greatest hits of Lynyrd Skynyrd and the Zoso album of Led Zeppelin. AC/DC are simply the most overrated metal band ever. All their albums suck, especially <br />this. Touch Too Much has to be one of the lousiest and worst song <br />ever recorded by any band. Avoid this bad album and get Metallica Ride the Lightning insted.
B000ANVQ0K|4.0|I love this film and bought this 3 disc edition from a retail store in India. The best part is I bought it (NEW) for Rs.799.00 that is equivalent to $17.2087 (USD).One of the first items which I have found for a cheaper price in India than at the Amazon Online Store....Wonder how??
B0000TLA9G|5.0|Hey look kid, GNR are legends, you know what I mean by that? They are legends just like Green Day, Dire Straits, Metallica, and Foreigner. This is a fine GNR collection that has terrific tunes <br />in Civil War, November Rain, and Sweet Child of Mine. Get it but <br />avoid A Bigger Bang that sucks horribly!! <br /> <br />Thanks, <br />For Whom The Bell Tolls.
B0000AGWJ7|5.0|Avenged Sevenfold is an awesome band that knows the way punk+metal should be done.  People should know that this isn't for douchbags only.  This is a great CD that people need to listen to if they have not already.  Awesome CD.
0670034711|1.0|I looked forward to reading this book because I love to read books that give cultrual insights to people in other part of the world. Soon after beginning to read this book I was sorely disappointed.  The writer is very articulate and very humorous.  She can express herself easily through the written word. Quite soon after I began reading though,I began to feel like I was ready in a tennage girls diary.  The writing style seems to me very immature and written by a very selfgish young girl.    There is no depth into the culture of the Italian people.  This book centers around the authors emotional immaturity and instability.  She also uses several opportunities to slander President George Bush and all Republicans in general. I soon ralized that everything I was reading would be slanted to the ideological left.  I think that political opionions should be left to political works and not used to show biases in books that are meant for entertainment.  So if you are a young teenage girl who does not know what you want out of life this book is for you.  This will help give you some insight into the thoughts of someone else who is uncertain about their life.        <br />
B00005JOFQ|5.0|This is a wonderful and powerfully touching movie. As a dad with two boys, I think there is one message that is lost to most of the reviewers. I'm not going to rehash the story, but focus on a deeper subtext that raises this story to a level similar to Jere Myles' book \\"Murder on the Pier.\\" This is a story about unfulfilled expectations on the part of all the central characters, but the deeper meaning in this story is Ennis's inability to grasp a hold on his life because of an absent father. Ennis' feelings are as orphaned to him as he has felt throughout his life, and it is not ironic that of the two, he is the one who is obviously in control. The irony is, he doesn't know what to with it. The 'it' being the love he has for Jack.    This movie will be discussed on campuses, restaurants and perhaps even Congress, possibly even pulpits. Arguments will ensue on what made each of them the way they are, but the philosophical underpinning of this movie that makes it touch the fiber of every man is the love of a father, and how that can help frame one's destiny.    Captured on a backdrop of beautiful breathtaking scenery a love story evolves amidst the volatile uncertainty of the 60s. Lee's direction is terse and laconic. There are no opportunities for you to dwell on melodrama. He doesn't allow it. As an audience member, you feel each moment of this movie, whether it's the first night in the tent, or twenty years later when Jack admits he can't shake his love for Ennis. You have been prepped and disarmed to soak each moment as just that...a moment in time that's not yours, as much as it is the characters on the screen. You don't want the movie to end. You don't want them to leave each other. You don't want them to leave the mountain, but with the same inevitability of them having to relinquish their expectant hold on each other, you hold on to the idea that maybe they were right, and the rest of the people around them were wrong.    As Jonathan Rose in Myles' book, \\"HateCrimes...\\" asked \\"What are the three most important, and perhaps the three most misunderstood words in a relationship?\\" The reader, as well as the movie goer encounters these words by understanding as Rose in Myles' book understands it's about, \\"Having no expectations. You expect the person who tells you I love you, that they love you too. You place a condition on something that should be unconditional. The most important thing to remember here, is that the first 'having no expectations,' is cognitive. You must first think the phrase like you would a new language. The second is self-actualizing. By understanding the phrase, verbalizing it through your understanding, you can then act accordingly. You tie yourselves in knots my limiting your partners, or prospective partners within your parameters, as opposed to allowing them to be free to teach you, and carry you to new dimensions, or share old ones with them.\\" This movie will tie you in knots and make you think about relationships in a totally different unexpectant context.    Heath Ledger's acting is as understated as the majesty of the azure skies of Brokeback Mountain. By contrast, Gyllenhaal's direct aggressive approach toward Jack complements the sullen Ennis. By allowing himself to be overwhelmed, Gyllenhaal is overwhelming as he brutally assaults his inward demons whether it's through a kiss, unrepentant embrace, or castigating an overbearing father-in-law who's never been put in his place. You never feel either Ledger or Gyllenhaal is acting. Not even when Ennis overwhelmingly assaults Jack after not seeing him for four years under the barest of concealment of a staircase where Ennis now lives with his wife and two daughters, one of the more pivotal points in the movie.    This is a man's movie, but a complete review of this movie would be incomplete without mentioning the supporting female cast. Each in their own way, add a dimension that forces the audience to empathize and commiserate with Ennis and Jack. Michelle Williams is probably the standout as she gives men something to hate, when we really want someone to understand us and let us be. On the other hand, I was particularly moved by Linda Cardellini, who becomes Ennis' girlfriend after his divorce. Not on the screen as much as Michelle Williams, Cardellini causes the audience to whimper for both her and Ennis as she is the most fragile and redeeming of the women drawn here. Unable to understand being shut out of Ennis' life, her one tear toward the end of the movie qualifies her as Shakespearean a tragedienne as Eileen Prescott in Myles' 'Hate Crimes' novel. Likewise, as haunting and unforgettable are the few chosen words and expressions Jack's mother offers Ennis before providing him with a brown paper bag for his own.    Finally, what makes this a man movie for me is Jack's dad. Unlike Jack, Jack's father had no expectations of his son. He loved him as deeply as men in those days were silent about loving, even their own sons. That's what makes this movie a tragically beautiful true to life story. I will not destroy the ending, but the scene with Jack's father was to me, one of the more poignant and spoke volumes about acceptance, affirmation and the accountability that good fathers need to have of themselves to make sure they raise sons that love themselves. Go see it, 'without expectations.'  You won't soon forget it.
0618477942|5.0|This memoir will grab you from the very beginning. The comic form depiction of the family story delights your eyes as much as the words will delight your soul.

6305648522|5.0|Many of these Amazon reviews have got it wrong. The Director's Cut is the original version of the film, the way the director wanted it. It was then shortened because it was thought to be too long for an American audience. The method of shortening was basically to cut off the end of the film, thus distorting the plot. <br />The original version is certainly darker but Alfredo is not manipulative in a bad way, he simply interferes once in Toto's life. At the end, Toto realises that this is the real message of the \\"kisses\\".
B000002MFQ|5.0|Now, I know everybody who likes Mike Oldfield is criticizing him for re-recording and re-packaging Tubular Bells over and over, and over again these past 30 plus years. But, if it wasn't for the 1992 release of Tubular Bells II, I would have probably just let myself forget all about him. I really didn't follow Mike Oldfield's music much after Crises (1983) and The Killing Fields (1984). I didn't care for how Mike Oldfield was doing less long played projects and started to perform pop sounding ditties with other singers. Sometimes, you wouldn't know if you were listening to Mike Oldfield or ABBA, or just simply someone else. Simple pop songs like \\"Family Man\\", \\"To France\\", \\"Moonlight Shadow\\", etc. done with a female vocalist.  And when I saw \\"Discovery\\" (1984) and seen that it had more short pop songs with vocals, I just sort of gave up on Mike Oldfield, altogether. So I think, TB II was a smart move for Mike Oldfield to re-introduce himself to the music world. \\"Tubular Bells\\" (1973) was considered a Progressive Rock achievement back then, and so TB II of 1992 had to compete with the modern day New Age music market. I don't think TB III was a great disappointment, and I certainly I won't give it a miss either. To see it performed live now (on his very hard to find PAL region only DVD release of \\"Tubular Bells II and III Live\\") actually makes me appreciate this album and that album so much more.<br /><br />And why shouldn't Mike Oldfield try and keep Tubular Bells alive? When we go to see any singer or band in concert, we are usually not too concerned about hearing some of their new material.

B000EMGAOY|3.0|I Love the Red Hot Chili Peppers!  BUT... (oh, here we go...) this is not the Peppers I fell in love with in 1987 when I saw them at a local club, nor the fiery peppers from the Californication era.  I've listened to both discs several times and the songs do grow on you and it is a decent album,  but I am longing for the Pep in the peppers. There is no spark.  I understand that bands \\"grow\\" and their sounds change.  For most, it is a great thing.  I probably wouldn't be a big Beatles, Rush, and Dream Theater fan if their sound stayed stagnant,  but something about this album that just isn't there FOR ME. I liked the early RHCP sound and am yearning to hear more of it.  A couple of years from now when I go to my CD collection to grab some RHCPs to listen to,  this one will probably stay on the shelf.

0380789019|5.0|Inspired by my friend's obsession over Neil Gaiman, I decided to give Gaiman a second try. My first Gaiman book was The Sandman Book of Dreams, which I unfortunately wasnt able to read through. No wonder, she said, because I had to read some other book first before reading that. Several years later, I find myself on a bookshop with my friend, after a mini high school reunion, and she fished it out of the bookshelf and insisted that I add this to my reading list. This has been one of the best book purchases in my life. It just took me 3 days to finish the book. And just right on time, I was on a layover in London when I was in the heart of the novel. Im, normally not a fan of fantasy books but this one is absolutely a fantastic masterpiece.<br /><br />What if in the bustling city of London, there was an entirely different dimension/world directly beneath it? Yes, even further below the Underground. London Above(the one we know) and London Below (where the story is)<br /><br />\\"Richard Mayhew is a plain man with a good heart,\\" reads the synopsis at the back of the book. And thats exactly what the main character is, just a regular guy with a good soul. With a nagging girlfriend. On their way to a dinner with his girlfriend's boss, they stumble upon a filthy bleeding girl crumpled on the sidewalk. His girlfriend refuses to give attention to what looked like a homeless beggar. But our good man Richard picks her up, all blood and dirt, and tries to save her, much to girlfriend's chargin. And that's where Richard's \\"Richard in wonderland\\" adventure begins.<br /><br />The homeless girl turns out to be Door, a girl from London Below , who has the special power of opening doors, and providing doors when necessary. Her family was brutally murdered by Mr. Croup and Mr. Vandemar. She is now being hunted by these two, and when Door ends up being in London Above, Richard becomes her \\"clueless?\\" protector and also gets dragged down to the dimension below.<br /><br />With irresistbly interesting characters such as the jolly (but dont be fooled) Marquis de Carabas, Iliaster, and the filthy but helpful Rat-Speaking people, Hunter, (who I always imagine as Grace Jones or a dark Angelina Jolie) and of course, the root of all this mayhem, The Angel Islington.<br /><br />Hollywood should invest in this and make another fantasy movie. I wont say it would be greater than The Lord of the Rings or H.P for this is entirely different, but I can only imagine what a great blockbuster this would be. Sort of like WILLOW and NEVER ENDING STORY.<br /><br />I found out that there's been a \\"Neverwhere\\" Mini-Series produced in 1996, but it didnt do justice to the book.<br /><br />This is a classic, and in the future, far far future, when my child reaches the age of reason, I will FORCE him to read this.<br /><br />Neil Gaiman , in this book, is a living Tolkien meets C.S Lewis.rresistbly interesting characters such as the jolly (but dont be fooled) Marquis de Carabas, Iliaster, and the filthy but helpful Rat-Speaking people, Hunter, (who I always imagine as Grace Jones or a dark Angelina Jolie) and of course, the root of all this mayhem, The Angel Islington. <br /> <br />Hollywood should invest in this and make another fantasy movie.

0060955775|5.0|A friend recommended this long long ago but just because I thought the title and the cover were too depressing, I decided to hold reading it. Time passed and I was able to read The Alchemist and By The River Piedra I Sat Down and Wept. I didn't like both, so I had more reason not to read Veronika. Another lesson learned for me, don't judge a book by its author (does this make sense?)<br /><br />Veronika Decides to Die is simply beautiful! I wish I read it sooner, so I can justify my craziness. Just reading the first few pages and I loved the book already. I am not very impressed by novels like this (\\"life enhancing\\" fiction) but this one relays a really great message and life lesson.<br /><br />Veronika, a young girl from Slovenia one day decides to die--that is to commit suicide by overdosing on pills. She fails to kill herself and  wakes up at a famous mental institution. She was told that although she wasn't successful enough to have totally taken her life, she has damaged her cardiovascular system so much that she only has 5 days to live.<br /><br />And on the next days, Veronika suddenly gets the urge to live and survive. She meets 3 people inside the institution, Zedka, Mari and Eduard. They are  people who are deemed `mad' by the normal society. And with their enlightenment, Veronika lives and explores her life to the fullest over the next days. On her fifth day, her supposed last day, Veronika finds out she is still alive. Unbeknownst to her, and all the other patients of the mental institution, the head physician, Dr. Igor, has come up with this technique to cure people of their `illness'. If someone was brushed closely by death, and was told that he/she hasn't got much days to live, they will start to embrace and appreciate life as opposed to going down the drain. And Veronika will therefore, take everyday as a miracle knowing that she should have been dead (unless she seeks the second opinion of a normal doctor).<br /><br />The best part for me, is how it tackles the reason why human beings go `mad'. We are all designed to be unique individuals, and act as we please, that is the human nature. And for the longest time, man's actions have been confined to what society deems `normal'.<br /><br />Ive always been an advocate of \\"f*ck what other people think\\" (as long as you are not harming any other human being). And this book really says it all. People are always consumed of what people think of them, and because of this, they are also pressured to act a certain way, say certain things. And the everyday battle of trying to be normal is what kills people.<br /><br />Even if the facts and main plot of the book may seem abit unrealistic, I cannot say enough good things about what insights this book brings.<br /><br />I am already in love with the book, and definitely, most certainly RECOMMEND this.s how it tackles the reason why human beings go `mad'.

B000002LVB|3.0|Released in 1970, Loaded would be the final Velvet Underground release to feature their leader and chief songwriter Lou Reed. Like their previous albums, Loaded would sound different from its predecessor, this time sporting more of a hard rock sound. The performances sound almost professional compared to their looseness of their previous works. Also worth noting is that while all the songs are good, they're not quite as memorable or as exciting as before. The now classic tracks \\"Sweet Jane\\" and \\"Rock & Roll\\" are the best tracks as well as the only ones that really capture the spirit of their previous output. Another great song is \\"New Age\\", a track that not only has some great chord changes but also recalls the beauty of \\"I'm Set Free\\" and \\"I'll Be Your Mirror.\\" The opening \\"Who Loves The Sun\\" is psychedelic pop similar to \\"Sunday Morning\\" and \\"Femme Fatale\\" from their first album, Velvet Underground and Nico. While rockers like \\"Cool It Down\\", \\"Head Held High\\", \\"Lonesome Cowboy Bill\\", and \\"Train Round the Bend\\" are all decent, they don't touch anything off their previous albums. The same goes for the mellower \\"I Found a Reason\\" and \\"Oh! Sweet Nothin\\"; both are okay but they've done better. All told, while Loaded is still a good album and the band certainly don't embarrass themselves like many do on their last albums, it's not on par with their previous classic material.
B000AADYRQ|4.0|I had never thought I would see the day that I would be here sitting down writing such a positive review from a band that I have always relentlessly said that I would never like let alone listen to. It came slowly, very slowly. I had heard the song \\"transatlanticism\\" and fell deeply in love with it (that's a lot of song!). Then came \\"Soul Meets Body\\" and from the minute I heard it I knew that I had to secrectly go about liking it. I took me a few pushes to actually buy the album. I was just seeking for more songs like \\"Soul Meets Body\\". Before I knew it, I was contsantly listening to \\"Plans\\" every single day (and still am). I'm just completely in awe of its tomultuous beauty. Every song is gorgeous and played perfectly. Ben Gibbard manages to pull off deep regret, sincerity, sorrow (lots of it), and joy into each song.  <br />If there is one song one here I skip, it's \\"You Will Be Loved\\". It's not bad but it just doesn't compare to the rest at all.  For those who say it sounds like an expansion of The Postal Service are missing something. The only song that mildly resembles that particular band would be \\"Different Names for the Same Thing\\" and even that's a stretch. Standouts in my opinion are \\"Marching Bands of Manhattan, Soul Meets Body, I Will Follow you into the Dark, Your Heart is an Empty Room, and What Sarah Said.\\" For those of you who were like me in never thinking that Death Cab for Cutie could never be a band that you could love, you are missing out! Just jump on this band wagen and hold tight. I take back everything bad I have every said. I'm now a Death Cab devotee and lover. Spare your ego and snobbish hoop-la and buy \\"Plans\\".

6304806418|2.0|As someone who saw the original touring Evita in Austin during the 1980's, and practically memorized the original Broadway cast recording, I found this presentation of the work rather jarring and disappointing.  Many of the lyrics have been changed or sanitized, perhaps to satisfy the censors in Argentina so the film could be shot there.  The complete elimination of Peron's last mistress before Evita, and the transfer of her agonized lament \\"Another Suitcase in Another Hall\\" to Madonna, was a poor decision and changes the whole concept of that song.  Overall, the orchestral arrangements have too \\"pop\\" a flavour, and disgard the lush original score.  If you want to get a REAL feel for the impact of \\"Evita\\", get the original recording with Patti Lupone and Mandy Patinkin.

Of course the CD is actually overpowering the movie itself but thats not a bad thing though. That what makes the movie better.it's definitely a cd to add to your Hans Zimmer collection. He's one of the greatest composers of our time.

This album stood out in a diferent way. when people compare it to U2 I would have to agree especially the guitar on a few tracks really could be the edge. The feelings also are similar they are great road albums. I am from the southwest and this cd is the perfect soundtrack to thinking about life. The lyrics are well put as well. The whole cd really moved me, and you would be well advised to pick it up.
B0001I55OC|3.0|I've never read the Michael Crichton novel this film was adapted from. All I've heard from fans of the book was that the adaptation directed by Richard Donner from a Jerry Maguire screenplay was just god awful. I would have to agree with them to a point. Timeline was very bad from beginning until the final half hour where a climactic siege battle between the British and the French saves the film from the awful pile.<br /><br />Timeline's premise of time-travel by way of some sort of \\"faxing\\" through a fixed wormhole sounds interesting enough. The theme of 20th-century people in the medieval France of the 14th-century also adds to the interesting story that supposed to have made Crichton's novel such a great read. But even having not read the book I thought the film was bad. The theme of strangers in a strange land was never fully explored and it seemed that each action sequence were there to only serve to keep the film from spiraling down into pure boredom. It didn't help that half of the main characters were wrongly cast. Paul Walker just didn't seem to belong in the film with his one-note performance as a surfer dude when he was suppose to be some sort of archaeology expert. Then add to that his love interest in the form of Frances O'Connor and things just get worse. The acting performances in the flm is salvaged by the work of Gerard Butler as Andre Marek whose chemistry with 14th-century French Lady Claire seemed very genuine. I think the film would've improved dramatically if they just concentrated on those two characters.<br /><br />Timeline does have one redeeming moment in its entire running time and that would be the battle in the end of the film. The French knights and men-at-arms besieging then storming the English fortification was genuinely action-filled. The technology and tactics used during the battle looked accurate enough to show just how brutal medieval warfare really was. From flaming arrows, night arrows and trebuchets with burning pitch, Timeline actually became entertaining.<br /><br />But a half hour of entertainment preceded by more than an hour of pure nonsense and boredom could only keep Timeline from becoming one of the true awful films of the last ten years. Maybe things would've been different if the screenplay followed abit more of the complexities of the book. Maybe if the casting of Paul Walker and Frances O'Connor never occurred and other more talented individuals would've raised the level of the film's overall quality. As a piece of mindless fun (well the final half hour at least), one can't do any worse with Timelines, but for fans of the book and more well-crafted filmmaking they should probably skip this film and seek entertainment somewhere else.meline actually became entertaining. <br /> <br />But a half hour of entertainment preceded by more than an hour of pure nonsense and boredom could only keep Timeline from becoming one of the true awful films of the last ten years.

B00007BKVC|4.0|This film stars two wild and crazy gals who go on a breezy and uninhibited spree of revenge that ultimately ends in disaster, but getting there is what's entertaining about this movie. The film features several wild chase scenes, exploding tanker trucks, pantomimed oral sex, whole squads of police cruisers on the trail of the wayward women, a sympathetic cop who wants to save them, and a law enforcement establishment which has been embarrassed by being unable to stop their spree of violence and that wants them dead. Overall a pretty decent flick despite it's somewhat downer message and ending. But the action keeps the film moving along and Keitel, Davis, and Sarandon turn in fine performances, as usual.
0380789019|5.0|I was shelving books in the Sci-Fi/Fantasy section and came across this book.  It looked interesting, so I bought it.  It was a great read.

B00005JOML|5.0|I'm not quite sure why this film has received such mixed reviews.  It has a similar feel to most of Mann's previous films.  I fear that many went to see this movie and expected a movie that didn't require much cerebral effort (ie, Bad Boys 2, Pirates 2).  Many film goers aren't used to artsy films masqueraded as blockbusters.  This film depicted what it set out to. .you either love it or hate it. .  and it's just unfortunate that it went over so many people's heads.
B00005NKKZ|5.0|Simon & Garfunkel released their final album in 1970 after a decade of riding the top of the charts with their blend of folk, soft rock, and vocal harmonies.  Their previous album \\"Bookends\\" was a masterpiece in its own right with its moody atmosphere of light folk songs about the lives of the people of the world.  With the release of \\"Bridge Over Troubled Water\\", however, they raised the level of that genre with an even more ambitious album.  Incrediblely, the duo's partnership reached its end with the release of this album.  But it couldn't had been a better way to end it. <br /> <br />It opens with the powerful pop title track, a song about helping someone you love whether it be a friend, lover or family member (and despite what some people claim I do not believe it is about drug use).  Simple beauty is present in the form of \\"El Condor (If I Could)\\" as well as sheer fun with such songs as \\"Baby Driver\\".  The other standout tracks, however are \\"The Boxer\\" and \\"The Only Living Boy In New York\\".  \\"The Boxer\\" is about a boy who leaves home to find work in the city only to return after enduring one hardship after another.  The boxer is an icon of the people who must deal with hardships on a daily basis.  With its \\"Lie-la-Lie\\" chorus, its thundering drums, and its string section it easily became one of the most powerful tracks from any 60s pop group.  \\"The Only Living Boy In New York\\" is how Paul Simon and Art Garfunkel felt when their partnership ended.  Being in a band is like being married and disbanding can be just as heartbreaking as divorce. <br /> <br />The album went on to win numerous Grammy awards including album of the year.  It also won a spot on most critics' lists of the best albums of all time.  You'd never know the tensions present in the duo's partnership when this album was released because the album is a solid effort from start to finish.  An amazing final treasure from the 60s era.

B00005BJ9W|4.0|Duran Duran gets a lot of crap by alternative/New Wave people as being a bunch of pretty boys from the UK who made good. I would prefer to listen to them (specifically this album) because it's damn good music. I love the song Hungry Like the Wolf, and I still play it to death 20 years after it was made. The title track and Save a Prayer are also fabulous songs too. If I had a chance to listen to Duran Duran or crappy indie rock from the 1990's, I'd still take these guys. And their videos were light years better than their contemporaries (and current \\"rock\\" stars). Go Simon, Nick, John, Andy, and Roger!

0060934913|5.0|Took me 3 or 4 days to finish reading this book, amazing considering it sometimes takes me months to finish other books of equal size. Bourdain has a way of grabbing your attention that you will not want to put this one down...you'll put off sleep, eating, phone calls, even going to the john because you'll want to read page after page and see what happens next. His style of writing is personable and makes you feel like you're having a conversation with a good friend rather than reading about some guy's life. I was a cook for 5 years and have been out of it for equally as long and I know first-hand everything Bourdain says and his experiences are true from the drugs, sex, bankruptcies, and what really goes on in the restaurants that the customer doesn't know...this book almost makes me want to get back into it. Amusing, eye-opening (for those at least who never set foot in a restaurant kitchen), and witty, Bourdain's Kitchen Confidential is a must-have for fans of Anthony Bourdain's television programs and his restaurant customers, people curious about the darkside of the culinary world, as well as those who detest Rachel Ray. I loved this book so much I bought all his other ones...hopefully soon, we'll see Bourdain challenge Bobby Flay in Iron Chef America.
B00000I5P9|3.0|Sting followed up the superb TEN SUMMONER'S TALES with MERCURY FALLING, on which the former Police frontman experiments with blues, country, folk, and a little bit of gospel.  The album's biggest problem is a lack of energy.  Part of the charm of Sting's earlier releases was the power of his songs and the passion in his vocals.  Most of the songs on MERCURY FALLING are devoid of much energy, resulting in an unexciting, often pretentious album.  It does have its highlights, namely the bluesy \\"All Four Seasons\\" and the uptempo \\"Twenty Five To Midnight\\", the latter of which was inexplicably omitted from the US and Canadian releases of the album; also, the emotional \\"You Still Touch Me\\" and the gospel-influenced \\"Let Your Soul Be Your Pilot\\".  It's far from a bad album, but in the end it feels like Sting doesn't have his heart in it, resulting in an enjoyable, but unextraodinary recording.
B000FGGE68|5.0|It grows on you... <br />No doubt, something went wrong with the special effects and the editing (get the Unrated version, it's better). <br />You will feel a little weird in some moments... but try and TRUST this movie.

B00000I2I7|5.0|While THE DREAM OF THE BLUE TURTLES proved that Sting had solo potential, it was the subsequent album, ... NOTHING LIKE THE SUN, that proved that the ex-Police frontman was here to stay.  A big part of what makes the album so great is that, unlike on BLUE TURTLES, Sting isn't trying so hard; he just lets the music flow.  The result is a pop masterpiece far different from the other pop albums of the time.  The songs are more layered than those on BLUE TURTLES, and also considerably more moody.  Branford Marsalis' saxophone really shines, particularly on the delightful opener \\"The Lazarus Heart\\", just one of many great songs on the album - \\"Be Still My Beating Heart\\", the classic \\"Englishman In New York\\", the beautiful \\"They Dance Alone (Cueca Solo)\\", and \\"Straight To My Heart\\" are some others.  Also wonderful is an amped-up, jazzed-out remake of Jimi Hendrix's \\"Little Wing\\", on which Sting is accompanied by Gil Evans and his orchestra.  Considered by many to be Sting's best solo effort, ... NOTHING LIKE THE SUN is an intelligent pop masterpiece that ranks among the best and most important albums of the 1980s.
B000C65Z1G|5.0|Justin Quayle (Ralph Fiennes) is an English biologist, based in Africa, who meets the volatile Tessa (Rachel Weiss) while substituting for a lecturer in London, intrigued when she asks a question from the audience indicting the British government's involvement in Iraq. Equally intrigued, Tessa follows Justin to Africa, where they are married, although the newlywed husband harbors some distrust for Arnold, the African doctor with whom Tessa works. Justin allows himself to be blinded to her passions on behalf of the Africans, her interest in the rampant spread of disease and the exploitation by government-sponsored pharmacological corporations, great conglomerates who make available the currently used drugs on a massive scale.<br /><br />While accompanying Arnold on his rounds in the townships, Tessa makes a stunning discovery, but pursues it without informing Justin, hoping to shelter him from any fallout. When Tessa and Arnold go on a trip to the interior, Justin is informed that there has been an incident: his wife is killed, Arnold missing, the implication that they had been on a tryst. Through the merest chance and the efforts of Tessa's brother, Justin begins unraveling the thread of his wife's discovery, pursued at every turn by threats. Justin has been naïve; worse, he has not had faith in his wife. What he feared was infidelity is far more serious and the cause of Tessa's death. In a harrowing adventure, Justin goes from source to source, determined to do justice to his dead wife's memory. He succeeds, but at a terrible cost.<br /><br />The most appalling thing about this film is the underlying truth, the conscienceless exploitation of the helpless in the name of corporate greed, a disease become endemic to our modern world. When outrages are perpetrated, such as the one depicted in The Constant Gardener, they are of such pervasive proportions that it is impossible to affect any kind of change. Governments, corporations, the \\"good of the nation\\" and world outrage are bound together in their crimes against humanity. It isn't the first time the disenfranchised have served as human guinea pigs, with no voice and no power, but technology has created a new audience to expose deeds that might have gone unnoticed.

B0000029DD|5.0|The first time I heard Jeff Buckley was way back when I lived in GA during my time in the Army. It was 1996 I believe. I heard \\"Last Goodbye\\". I didn't think too much of it, I liked it, but I was then and still now a die hard metalhead. I am not supposed to listen to this. Then I got introduced to this by the last person I expected, Otep Shamaya on her myspace page in one of her blogs. I felt like I had just breathed a breath of the freshest air. This man was so talented and I am just now dicovering it now. The tragedy is I will never hear anything new from him ever again. He was taken from us at such an early age and he probably would have blown us away again with his soaring lyrics and vocals. You almost get lost in his thoughts and get taken to another place that you don't necessarily want to be. I was personally taken back to my first marriage that crumbled and my long time relationship that fell apart while I was in basic training. However, I needed to feel this, I needed to relive the pain because I had just put it away. Grace is nothing but great songs that will make you feel some emotion inside you that you thought wasn't there anymore. I highly suggest picking this up. It is truly a work of what the art of music was always meant to be, a reflection of one's soul into the lyrics and notes of the music to convey what one is feeling and get you to feel it.
B0002O0CM0|2.0|While I'm glad that these two albums have been released as a 2 for 1 CD, I'm not really recommending them for anyone but die-hard Doors fans. I've had both of these on vinyl for years. I find Other Voices almost completely unlistenable and think that Full Circle has three very good songs on it.<br /><br /> The main problem here is the vocals, handled by Ray Manzarek and Robby Krieger. What were they thinking? Neither of them can sing, especially Manzarek, who actually has a good voice, but tries too hard to sound like a Soul man and a boogie-woogie rock-n-roll man. His vocals are embarassing, and this is even more sad given how well he could sing the Jim Morrison Doors' songs. Guitarist Robby Krieger isn't much better, though I certainly can tolerate his thin, nasally voice much more than Manzarek's deep baritone voice. At least I don't feel like turning the music off when Krieger sings. Still, Manzarek and Kreiger should not have thought that they could replace Morrison as singer. It was silly!! It would have been like Tony Iommi and Geezer Butler taking over lead vocal duties after Ozzy left Black Sabbath.<br /><br />I have tried to listen to Other Voices, but have been so unimpressed as what little I heard, that I didn't bother to go back and give it another listen. It would have been too painful.<br /><br />Full Circle, however, has about three very good songs on it. The Mosquito starts off kind of humorous (intentionally humorous, I may add) with Krieger singing in Spaniash (or Mexican, I can't tell the difference) about a very annoying mosquito that is making it tough for him to enjoy his burrito. Most of the song is filled with some very exciting jamming between Krieger, Manzarek and Densmore. Densmore in particular sounds more awake and excited on this track than on any other tune on both albums. Densmore helped write the next track, The Piano Bird, which is a very laid back, jazzy tune and one of my favorite songs here. Not very Doors-like, but good nonetheless. I can even tolerate Ray's singing on it! It Slipped My Mind is another very good song...it's catchy, has a good, bluesy guitar riff to it and musically would not have sounded out of place on L.A. Woman. Other than these three songs and some exciting musical passages here and there on the first half of Full Circle, the rest of this is pretty lousy. I don't think that Jim Morrison was the Doors or vice-versa, but The Doors were certainly MUCH MUCH better with him and more focused musically. And Morrison wasn't just a singer (and a poet), he was also a presence, something that Manzarek and Krieger definitely are not. And some of the song titles...Jim Morrison never would have let The Doors title one of their songs ' I'm Horny, I'm Stoned '!<br /><br />For curious Doors fans only and not for the faint of heart...e Ray's singing on it!

0670827592|5.0|Finally, after all this time, Alexander T. Wolf (alias \\"the Big Bad Wolf\\") emerges to tell his side of the 3 Little Pigs tragedy.  Blaming a publicity-frenzied press for exaggerating the truth of the story, he asserts his innocence, rationalizes the nature of the circumstances, and indulges here and there in the art of blaming the victim.  While admitting that he did destroy the houses of the first two pigs and eat the unfortunate home-owners, he explains that \\"the real story is about a sneeze and a cup of sugar.\\"<br /><br />On the day in question, Mr. Wolf, despite suffering from a bad cold, was making a cake for his dear old granny when he ran out of sugar.  Naturally, he went around to his closest neighbors (who happened to be pigs) asking to borrow enough to finish his cake, but the pigs were all quite rude and refused to help him.  That would have been all there was to the story had it not been for the wolf's insufferable head cold, which caused him to sneeze on the occasions of his first two visits.  It wasn't his fault that the first two little pigs had unwisely built their houses of straw and sticks, respectively.  One sneeze was all it took to knock each house down onto it's piggy occupant - and, seeing the pigs tragically killed, Mr. Wolf saw no reason to let a couple of perfectly good ham dinners lie there going to ruin.  Wolves eat pigs - it's just their nature.  As to why he was seen attacking the front door of the third little pig's brick house, A. Wolf has a perfectly reasonable explanation for that, as well.<br /><br />Perhaps I should point out the fact that A. Wolf did not technically write this book himself -for obvious reasons (they don't allow typewriters in prison, and it's devilishly hard to hold and control a pen when all you have to work with are paws).  This is his story as told to Jon Scieszka and illustrated quite lavishly by Lane Smith.  It makes for a delightful, colorful, witty romp that almost all children (and most of their parents) will relish.arents) will relish.

B000F7CMRM|4.0|I was reluctant to watch this movie.  Partly, because some people told me that they found it confusing. Partly, because it touches on the subjects of oil, corruption and the evil of the middle east that has always been portrayed in a very American way in the past.  And yes, the movie can be confusing and yes, the movie also has a very American take on its themes.  Nevertheless, it is is worth watching.    The movie is shot in very quick scenes that allow the viewer to \\"drop in\\" on whatever is going on.  There is not much fuzz about setting up the scene or introducing the characters, of which there are many.  Instead, the viewer is launched into a multi-dimensional plot line with various characters intersecting at single or multiple moments.  It is almost like a puzzle, where the more pieces are put together, the puzzle master is slowly able to envision the whole picture.  True, this movie takes patience and demands attention, but those are requests that usually are forgotten in the average American Hollywood movie these days.  The acting is excellent with George Cloony, who won an Academy Award and Golden Globe for his role, leading a fabulous cast.    The themes of the movie are current.  Weapons are sold in the Middle East and no one knows who ends up owning them.  Oil companies merge and with the merge comes the loss of jobs for foreign workers.  Immigration issues and the lack of work allows militant terrorist groups disguised as a religious sect to order young men into suicide.  The quest to move a country that is ruled by a king to a democratic government fails because there is no benefit in this advance for some of the ruling countries in the world.  The need for men to make themselves even richer drives them to corruption.  The lines are blurry and it is not often clear who the good guys are.  In some cases, what is intended as good becomes evil.  Moral is questioned, as well as what drives the economy and our social wealth.  Is America supportive of one country's  liberation even if that means oil prices will rise?    Don't expect answers to all of your questions and don't expect an easy solution.  This is a complex movie that looks at a complex set of problems.  It is also an American movie and thus, some of the portrayals of immigrant and terrorist issues may be one-sided.  However, what this movie excels at is questioning as to what the relationship is between the Middle East, the oil business, weapon trading and terrorist activities.  These are important themes in our time and this movie is a great starting point to start talking about them.
B00007KWHP|5.0|There were two albums released by Yes in the year 1972--the stellar `Close to the Edge' and this earlier effort, `Fragile.'  Yes--at this point consisting of Jon Anderson on lead vocals, Bill Bruford on drums, Steve Howe on guitars, Chris Squire on bass, and the newly-recruited Rick Wakeman on keyboards--had just scored a decent breakthrough with their third album, `The Yes Album,' in the previous year.  They had actually broken the charts in America, and they had finally reached and fortified what would be their characteristic sound in the years and albums to come. <br /> <br />So where does `Fragile' fit into all that?  The original nine tracks on `Fragile' are widely considered quintessential progressive rock, a template from which myriad later acts would spawn.  From start to finish, `Fragile' plays like well-oiled machinery (even with its occasional catches and blips), and its main material--the longer suites, mostly--demonstrates the level of maturity the band had ultimately achieved by this time in their collective career.  Oh, and `Fragile' also brings to the table a little something called \\"Roundabout,\\" which may well be the band's most famous song ever. <br /> <br />What are we waiting for?  The songs (in detail): <br /> <br />1. \\"Roundabout\\" - Well, well.  Do I really need to comment upon this one?  Unlike many popular, therefore overplayed songs, this one just doesn't get old.  Play it as many times as you like, and it still captivates.  Right from the onset, with Steve Howe's guitar harmonics, one can hear the innovation and compositional brilliance of the band.  And as the introduction moves on into the body of the piece, an irresistible lick makes itself heard again and again, though it never grows tiresome.  The middle section of the piece, with its fantastically arranged vocals, inspires pure awe, and the soft and pensive section which follows adds a much-appreciated dynamic contrast.  The Mellotron flutes are particularly nice, though of course they only play a few poly-chords.  What follows is one of Rick Wakeman's most spectacular solo escapades (though of course the one in \\"Close to the Edge\\" is his supreme solo effort), a repetition of earlier parts of the song, and the riveting conclusion, replete in layered, overdubbed vocals and presented with minimal backing to enhance the effect.  A simple flourish by Steve Howe ends the piece in understatement.  In a word, stunning. <br /> <br />2. \\"Cans And Brahms\\" - This is Rick Wakeman's showcase song on the album (each member gets a chance to show off in solo).  It's not bad, though it's not original.  It's basically an arrangement of various Brahms melodies, played on slightly unconventional instrumentation.  The work demonstrates for all to see Wakeman's peerless technical ability, but I do wish he (or the band in care of him) would have come up with something original.  Still, though, it's short enough that it goes by before it overstays its welcome. <br /> <br />3. \\"We Have Heaven\\" - This is Jon Anderson's chance to shine.  Here, in a vivid, multilayered arrangement, he sings a bunch of nonsense, albeit in impressive fashion.  Though I respect the tremendous skill required to have laid down such a track, I personally find this work insufferably annoying and repetitive.  It did not make it onto my iPod. <br /> <br />4. \\"South Side Of The Sky\\" - Ah, here we are with the second of the epic pieces.  This one is a great deal darker and more angular than \\"Roundabout,\\" and its lyrics allegedly deal with a failed Antarctic expedition where the explorers end up dying.  Though with Yes, you can never be sure.  Even so, this song is a true masterpiece of instrumentation, beginning with a brumal blast of synthesized Antarctic wind (apparently previous editions of the album also included footsteps, which have now been moved to the end of the previous track, where I have never heard them because I can't stand to listen to the third track to completion), and--in that weirdYes-esque manner--it rocks.  The middle section is a dark, piano-dominated piece of disjointed yet substantial clockwork, culminating in a neutral vocal section which might be representative of the gates of heaven opening for the doomed explorers.  After a return to the motifs from the beginning of the song, the work ends on a fadeout into the same howling wind with which it began. <br /> <br />5. \\"Five Per Cent For Nothing\\" - It might take you longer to read this description than it would for you to listen to the song.  It's really that short--around 35 seconds or so.  Bruford's showcase, it's a little drum pattern, repeated twice, with instrumentation from the rest of the band thrown in for good measure.  I guess they figured 35 seconds is about five percent of a song, so that's how they arrived at this title.  It makes a nice little introduction to the next track, so it works. <br /> <br />6. \\"Long Distance Runaround\\" - This is the infamous pop monster that, nonetheless, maintains the progressive feel so integral to Yes.  It's pleasant to listen to, and it's one of the shorter of Yes's full-band involvement songs up to this point.  The beginning line, with Steve Howe's expert guitar work running in parallel across the stereo field, is a sound to behold.  Once Chris Squire enters the fray, things get really interesting.  This song has one of the most enduring bass lines ever conceived, even among Yes songs.  Squire is among the most innovative of bassists, and his trademark, treble-heavy tone really helps the mood of this piece.  And, of course, Jon Anderson is up in the stratosphere singing away about nothing.  But then, Yes is music where, though very pretty in their own right, the lyrics are unimportant.  Anderson's lyrics paint pictures of emotion, they don't broadcast it of their own volition.  In this he was one of music's greatest poets. <br /> <br />7. \\"The Fish (Schindleria Praematurus)\\" - Here's a shocker: All the instrumentation that isn't drums is performed by Chris Squire's bass.  What an original concept!  If only the band had expounded upon what they had discovered here, they could really have come up with some interesting material.  Even so, this is by far one of the most interesting of tracks from `Fragile.'  \\"Long Distance Runaround\\" segues into this track, so \\"The Fish\\" is akin to a separate movement of the previous track.  Oh, and yes, they do sing the words \\"Schindleria Praematurus\\" at the end of the song.  Why?  I don't know.  Obviously it's the Latin name for a fish, but as to why it was chosen to name this song, I have no clue. <br /> <br />8. \\"Mood For A Day\\" - It's Howe's turn up to bat, with this showcase song.  I never though much of \\"Clap\\" (often mislabeled \\"The Clap\\" to the horror and extreme annoyance of Steve Howe), and I suppose that holds true for this song as well.  Steve Howe is a brilliant guitarist, probably one of the two best in the history of the art, and were I myself a guitarist I might find this track wholly more interesting.  As a keyboardist, I probably listen to \\"Cans And Brahms\\" a great deal more than most `Fragile' listeners.  There's nothing wrong with \\"Mood For A Day;\\" I'm just not qualified to evaluate it objectively. <br /> <br />9. \\"Heart Of The Sunrise\\" - Ah.  Bliss.  Here we have the ultimate closer to an exemplary album.  Beginning with a bang with an intriguing instrumental jam, this theme is then explored for two-and-a-half minutes before the song begins, very softly, yet never relenting until it reaches its climax.  And what a climax it is!  Anderson sings a high D (the one just above tuning A-440) which, when immersed in a chord is nothing special, naked and at the high point of a song is nothing short of breathtaking (even though he doesn't hold it and it sounds a little forced).  Jon's voice can go much, much higher, but this particular note is so well placed that it says, commandingly, that the listener has arrived at the ultimate climax of the song. <br /> <br/>It's just too bad that this isn't really the end.  There is a return of that energetic instrumental jam, then a pregnant silence.  Then, after about six seconds or so, a reprise of that ghastly third track, \\"We Have Heaven\\" bursts out of nowhere and fades out the track.  The idea was brilliant, but since I hated the song the first time, I really wasn't particularly thrilled to hear it again, especially tacked on to one of the best songs on the album.  At least that pause is long enough to where I can just skip the ending.  I considered altering the track before putting it on my iPod (basically removing that ending section), but I couldn't bring myself to desecrate a progressive rock masterpiece in that manner, even if I don't agree with the way it was arranged. <br /> <br />The bonus tracks don't really add much (the rough version of \\"Roundabout\\" actually has a nicer overall sound--a little less polished and perfect--but everybody except Bill Bruford and Chris Squire makes at least one glaring mistake), but, contrary to the bloody murder some reviewers have been screaming, these extra tracks don't destroy the album, either.  I believe these people have never experimented with that little button on their compact disc players that is labeled \\"Stop.\\" <br /> <br />This particular edition of the work has sterling sound quality.  Rhino produces consistently good results with whatever it remasters, and the Yes catalogue has been no exception.  While the 1994 remaster of 'Close to the Edge' by Joe Gastwirt had some qualities that were superior to the 2003 release, in the case of `Fragile' there is simply no comparison: The Rhino tramples the original Atlantic/Gastwirt release.  Not only has the volume been maximized, everything is clearer yet fuller, and the instrumental entrances in particular are superb on the Rhino edition.  Gastwirt's work always seemed to be a little more apologetic, where things just sort of slid into place.  The metallic elements of the drums sound brighter on the Rhino release, yet they are clearer and more distinct as well.  Each cymbal hit is precise and well-sculpted (even modern recordings tend to mush these together in a continuous general haze).  The packaging is very nice, the slip cover/digipack reminds a little of the original vinyl release, and the expanded liner notes/pictures offer insight into the making of this album. <br /> <br />Overall, I would recommend `Fragile' to just about anyone, particularly those new to Yes.  In this instance, there is nothing wrong with this release that would make it \\"for newbies.\\"  On the contrary, this album offers a vivid picture of just what made Yes the masterful progressive rock band it was, in a manner that is akin to on-the-job training.  This album was made to make music, not to indoctrinate or placate fans.  That, in part, is what makes Yes so special: They made music first, and radio-friendly music only if it turned out that way. <br /> <br />Thank God for `Fragile,' or there might never have been a `Close to the Edge.'
B000A59PMO|5.0|This is yet another clever show I discovered on DVD. I watched all seasons of Buffy the Vampire Slayer on DVD and I've been waiting for a show that matches it in wit and style. Although it doesn't match the quirky quality of Buffy, Veronica Mars outshines Buffy in style and substance. My husband and I rented VM from Netflix and raced through it. It was impossible to simply stop at one episode. Can't wait for Season 2 on DVD!
0553296981|5.0|This was such a well written book, that you would think an adult wrote. To know that a young lady wrote this was truly an inspiration for all those young people with writing dreams such as Anne's. Anne and her family went through such a hard two years and still remained hopeful and positive. This book really gives a great picture of what the Jewish community went through, all the unjust moves against them. It made me gain more respect for ALL religions and races. This book makes you wish that more help was sent to these people. We can never understand all the hardships The Franks went through, but we can help those going through similar persecution.

B00003XAQ5|5.0|I think Kind of Blue is an album, not just for jazz lovers, but for everybody. Kind of Blue is probably the first CD I would recommend to new people looking for some jazz music for many reasons.  <br /> <br />The whole album is completely improvised, which is the core of jazz. The CD doesn't have the orchestrated feel of some jazz artists. All the artists on this CD played whatever came to their mind, with no previous practice, to create music on the spot using the \\"framework\\" of Miles Davis. The framework Davis used was modal jazz, or improvising notes based on certain scales. This makes the CD feel very soulful or full of expression, without any clash of notes and brings the most important part of music, the melody, to the forefront once again. <br /> <br />Each artist brings their own distinct style to the album. Miles Davis has an extremely unique style on the trumpet that gives it a personal touch. Davis plays his trumpet with a very mellow and dark sound that is very sweet to the ears. Davis's sound is very different from the crisp, bright sound that is usually associated with trumpets. The Prince of Darkness's laidback style is certainly evident in this album. John Coltrane's style is instantly recognized as his tenor saxophone plays his very rapid, almost crazed, style. While being unique to Coltrane, the mad solos do not take away from the sound of the album, but adds to it. In my opinion, Julian \\"Cannonball\\" Adderley on alto saxophone tries to bridge the gap between Davis's mellow, \\"less is more\\" style and Coltrane's rapid, \\"go for broke\\" style. Both saxophonists present a great tone in their playing.      <br /> <br />The groove provided by the rhythm section of James Cobb (drums), Paul Chambers (bass), Wynton Kelly (piano on Freddie Freeloader), and Bill Evans  (piano) is felt throughout the album and supports the solos of Davis, Coltrane, and Adderley. I was quite impressed with how the rhythm section was able to back the soloists so efficiently. Cobb'saccents on the kit really helped set the feel for the soloist. The bassist did a good job of checking and balancing the drummer and walked the chords well. Also the dialogues between the piano and the wind instruments were very enjoyable. <br /> <br />My personal favorite moment on the CD was Wynton Kelly's piano solo on Freddie Freeloader. Kelly was brought in especially for this number because of his experience with the blues. Kelly's combination of both rhythm and melody in his solo were inspirational.     <br /> <br />I guarantee you will love this CD because it embodies the soul of music. It's the perfect album to start off new people into the realm of jazz and a must for any jazz collector. Jimmy Cobb put it best when he said, \\"It must have been made in heaven.\\"  <br /> <br />Total Playing Time: 55:26 <br />Total Tracks: 6 (Alternate take of Flamenco Sketches which is not on the original LP) <br />Originally Recorded in 1959 in New York City by Columbia Jazz
B000FS9FCG|4.0|The film V for Vendetta is a visually stunning film portrayal of a man bent on vengence against those who tormented him personally and who have oppressed his country.  It is not so much a film of ideas as it is of visual effect.  Like the film Sin City which also brought to life characters in a graphic novel, the visuals in this film are striking and are to a certain extent, a large part of the story.  To elaborate, the film lacks a set of clearly defined ideas beyond the vengence that V wishes to carry out.  For example, he blows up the Old Bailey at midnight, when there is very little chance of anyone being injured or killed.  He plans to blow up Parliment one year later, but his pre-announcement of the plan to the authorities ensures that the government will not be brought down, precisely the opposite of the character he emulates, Guy Fawkes.  This coupled with his personal vendetta against those who used him in medical experiments contributes to a dearth of ideas driving the story.  In real historical terms, the story is a closer parallel to the French Revolution than the American Revolution, where the French people extracted revenge against the nobility and had no plan for a government beyond the revenge.  The American Revolution was more a revolution in ideas regarding government and the right of the colonies to determine their own future.  The main insight to the ideas driving V's actions comes in the television broadcast he makes to the nation.<br /><br />So we must suspend our judgement here and concentrate on the visual impact, which is striking.  I picked up on two interesting cinematic parallels.  The first is the \\"1984\\" parallel, the movie in which John Hurt, who played the High Chancellor, played Winston Smith.  The logo for 1984 included a large V as the symbol for the Party of Big Brother.  In this movie V is the symbol of the rebellion.  In both films, government is sustained through lies and a focus on enemies, real and imagined.  The second cinematic parallel is \\"The Phantom of the Opera\\".  In both movies a masked antihero imprisons a young woman in order to capture her heart and mind, with a repressed love interest between the two protagonists.  The symbol of the antihero in both movies is a single red rose.  The visual impact of the movie recalls the \\"film noir\\" genre of the 1940's and 1950's, with shadowy lighting, rain, and heroes of questionable nobility.<br /><br />I thought the acting was well done.  Natalie Portman goes well beyond her wooden portrayals as Amidala in the Star Wars trilogy as a woman torn between her desire to avoid the violent end her parents met and the magnetic personality of V.  Hugo Weaving plays a masterful part as V, especially since wearing the mask prevents the use of his face in portraying the intensity of his emotion and the ideas driving his revenge.  Insightful dialogue provides the window to the man behind the mask.  The other actors flesh out the case with standouts being John Hurt as the High Chancellor and Stephen Rea as the detective trying to bring V to justice.<br /><br />In spite of the fact that this movie offers few profound ideas, it is great entertainment and kept me riveted to the screen from the beginning to the end.  My only wish is that the DVD offered more extras.  However, Hollywood has already come out with a Special Edition 2 disc set which I am sure will offer more features to the viewer.  For that reason, I only awarded four stars to this DVD.matic parallel is \\"The Phantom of the Opera\\".

B00001QEE9|5.0|Mary Poppins is the greatest Disney film ever made, but if your looking for Uncle Walt's greatest animated classic, this is the film. Pinnochio is superbly written, animated and designed. It's an exiting, dark and detailed picture with charming characters and wonderful lessons. <br />It's a shame that Disney has not decided to make this part of their \\"Platnium Edition\\" collection. It surely has more merit than The Lion King. It's a great film!
B00003CXC7|5.0|Hitchcock's masterwork.  Why?  It's so homey, so hum-drum . . . so believable, any of us could be its hero.  Its characters are diverse, compelling--and above all, entertaining.  Dialogue's snappy.  Plot line grows from humorous diversion to edge-of-your-seat suspenseful.  This film is what one 21st century critic described as \\"awesome\\" -- and it is!  No excess lines, scenes or diversions in this one; it's cut as well as \\"Annie Hall.\\"  Deserves a slot in anyone's library of favorite films of all time.  WHY CAN'T PEOPLE MAKE FILMS LIKE THIS ANYMORE???
B000EYK4GW|5.0|Although it doesn't match to the brilliance of Mary Poppins or the technical wizardry of Pinnochio, Dumbo is still a charming animated feature with some of the best visuals put on the screen. The story of the elephant who can fly, imortalized in the Disneyland attraction is a great film. <br />Although it does have some truly heartbreaking moments, this is a great family film that teaches children that we should all accept each other for our differences unlike the way some characters in the film behave. <br />This is a great film in my book!
B0001WTUH6|5.0|If you are interested in purchasing this then you already know about the storyline of this movie.  So I will just say if you don't already own Underworld then definetly by this one it is worth the extra price.  If you already have the regular version, then it is a toss up.  There are some extended scenes in this version.

0060763280|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book.  It gives you a reason to look at your present situation and make some changes on how you really want to go forward.  I would recommend this book to anyone.  I will be attending one of his seminars and have heard rave reviews from quite a few others, I was surprised when I mentioned this book, how many others have gotten a lot from his seiminars.
B00003CXC7|5.0|This movie shows Grace Kelly at the peak of her beauty.  Only Hitchcock can make the story of a \\"voyeur\\" this interesting to \\"watch\\".   <br /> <br />The picture quality on this DVD is excellent & in letterbox format to boot.  I only buy DVD in letterbox format, the way the director meant you to see it.  If you are a fan of the Master, this DVD needs to be in your collection!
B000FVQYYK|5.0|I have tried, but I cannot even begin to fathom the negative reviews of this album. I think the problem lies within Absolution's past success. Too many people expected Black Holes & Revelations to mirror Absolution. If you're buying this album and are expecting to find Absolution pt. 2, you will have a rude awakening. This album is 100% different than anything Muse has ever done, but is nothing less than mind-shattering. This CD is of epic proportions. I saw them live on Friday in Philadelphia and all iffy feelings towards this CD were shattered. It scares me when a band creates something of this caliber because it makes me wonder if it can be surpassed. This album has a sound which resembles Radiohead meets Queen touched with Muse's finesse. It's incredible. <br /> <br />Lyrically, I have never heard anything more powerful. The lyrics are a desperate cry for our times, and scream of the political strife in our world. I own CD's of bands whose goal is political awareness, and none compare to what this CD has accomplished. Do yourself a favor and buy this CD. <br /> <br />My favorite tracks are: <br /> <br />2. Starlight <br />4. Map of the Problematique <br />6. Invincible <br />9. City of Delusion <br />10. Hoodoo <br />11. Knights of Cydonia
B0002W18MU|5.0|Whenever I've listened to Johnny Cash sing, his voice: tough, strong, plaintive, decisive, confessional -- made me want to walk down a lonely road at midnight, maybe swagger a bit, cut the dust with a beer, or sit quietly in a dim lit bar with friends of all persuasions and consciences, and let the night do the talking.<br /><br />When I saw Johnny Cash at an Awards ceremony a year before he died, I was utterly devastated that this man in black - made of steel - now had a shock of white hair and could barely walk. But his soul shone clear and true, and walk he did, with the same deliberation that he muscled his songs with - to the podium, to receive his award amid thunderous ovation.<br /><br />I hesitated to buy this CD, knowing it would be the last I'd hear him sing, but to honor his memory I did.<br /><br />His voice, fading in, getting stronger, reminiscing, regretting - was an experience much more than aural -- it was seeing, with heart and soul -- a pre-dawn darkness along the tracks where the earth itself is releasing age old memories sacred to the whole human race, and in the distance, a tiny spot of light, growing bigger as a train, as dark as the night, slowly emerges from the horizon - its commanding whistle fading in and out of the rolls of darkness, while I'm frozen in an eternity, listening to a lifetime go by.<br /><br />I ached when his voice grew dimmer, and my heart beat faster when he sang clearer and stronger. This is not just a CD -- it's a Communion.<br /><br />Goodbye Johnny? No, Man in Black -- you're as close as a heartbeat and as forever strong as an Iron Horse cutting thru the secrets of the night, thundering past Folsom.
B000FS9FCQ|2.0|If you are under the age of 18, this movie will strike you as a profound and thought-provoking metaphor for today's events.  If you are under the age of 22, but a late bloomer, it may also strike you as profound and thought-provoking.  If you happen to be just under the age of 30, it will make you nostalgic for a short time ago, when a movie like this would strike you as profound and important.  But if you are over the age of 30, and it's been a while since you argued Bakunin and Kropotkin in the dorm, you will find yourself wishing for a little more complexity for your entertainment dollar, like you once found in Batman and Superman comics...

B000E41MS6|5.0|The new Doctor Who is, I think, as close to perfect as it could have gotten.  It is updated, yet holds every charm that the old series did-sometimes silly, often serious, with a hero who is definitely the good guy, without being too perfect and most certainly not infallible.  I admit I came into it expecting to hate Rose (a little jealousy, maybe?), but she quickly became one of my favorites of the Doctor's companions.  The only regret I have is that I am not able to get the show on TV, so I'll have to wait until next season is released on DVD.  WAAAAA! (I am SO looking forward to Harry Potter: The Goblet of Fire's David Tennant as our favorite Time Lord.)
0006547745|5.0|For those of us who grow up as Christians in the west, we often manage to gloss over some very fundamental questions about the origins of our faith. Why? Well, for me, it's because my knowledge on the middle east has essentially been limited to 30 second cable news clips. The journey Dalrymple takes us on in this book has completely changed the way I look at my faith. In this book, I was given, for the first time, the opportunity to see real people and real places that trace their roots to the origins of my faith. And how different it is than the church I have been brought up in! This book is a must read for any Christian who seriously wants to explore and challenge what it is they believe.
B00003CY6M|5.0|Don't try to make sense of it, don't try and analyze it, when you meet your soul-mate all rationality and common sense becomes inoperative. Suspend all previous assumptions if you dare. Your only recourse is to go wherever your passion leads you, even if it's on a coast to coast search for the one your meant to be with the day before your wedding. That's the message of the delightful romantic comedy 'Serendipity' released in '01.<br /><br />Jonathan (John Cusack) and Sara (Kate Beckinsale) happen to meet one Christmas Eve while shopping for a last minute gift for there perspective mate. A casual conversation leads to a skate on the ice at Rockefeller Center and an ice cream sundae afterwards at a posh little dessert shop called Serendipity. They are attracted to each other but committed to another so there's really no place to go with this relationship unless serendipity, or fate steps in.<br /><br />Sara's name and phone number are written on the first page of a book while Jonthan's information is written on the back of a five dollar bill. The two items are sent out into the cosmos of New York City. If Jonathan can find the book, or Sara the five dollar bill then maybe, just maybe they're meant to meet again. What do you think will happen?<br /><br />'Serendipity' is a wonderful \\"feel good\\" movie that can be enjoyed over and over again. John Cusack and Kate Beckinsale (sigh) are fantastic together and the supporting cast is magnificent. Jeremy Piven is hillarious as Dean, Jonathan's best friend and best man and Molly Shannon as Sara's closest friend Eve. Throw into the mix a madcap Bloomingdale's salesman played by Eugene Levy and you're set to go!
B000E41MS6|5.0|I was cautios to invest in the new season without seeing any of the new episodes, but I am happy I did.  Everything the \\"Classic\\" Dr. Who tried so hard to do but didn't have the resources then, is now here and brilliant.  Dialog is great, the actors (extras) are excellent, and the effects have come a long way from the 1950's.<br /><br />  The episodes have been so good that I am restraining myself from watching all of them at once because I don't know what I will do when I get to the last episode and I will wait for who knows how long before the next season is released.<br /><br />  I have been a big fan for 10 years, and I have no qualms with the new (re)generation of the story.  (ha ha, nerd joke)<br /><br />  Every fan can purchase this with confidence.<br /><br />-My only issue is that the DVD sound is very quitet.  I have never needed to turn my volume up so high just to hear anything.
B000FVQM2Y|3.0|I give credit for a creative idea, a noir set in a high school, but the noir genre seems too mature for it to succeed in this setting. some scenes are almost laughable, like when an intence meeting between the Pin and Brenden is temporarily post poned so the Pin's mom can get Brenden a snack and something to drink. it shows as a reminder that the characters are still in high school and from that moment on i had a hard time taking the film seriously for lack of realism. i realize noirs are not supposed to be the most realistic movies but this seems far fetched even for a noir. the dialog is also another thing that brings the movie down slightly. the over use of unfamiliar slang spoken at the speed that is characteristic of most noir films makes it hard to understand at times. Both the young cast and first time director show promise but the limitations of the script fail to let either truely work up to their potential.
B000E97Y6K|4.0|Finally, I saw King Kong after hearing so much about it and it was good.  It wasn't great, like Lord of the Rings obviously, but it definitely kept my attention throughout the 3 plus hours.  The special effects were magnificent, especially in the scenes where the dinosaurs were tripping all over each other and the scenes with the locals of Skull Island.  I thought Kong looked great and there was great emotion surrounding him.  Although one reviewer suggests that this movie was miscast, I strongly DISagree.  I thought Jack Black was perfect as a mixture of sleeze and charm, and played the part very well.  Naomi Watts, who has never looked prettier also did a great job with her connect with Kong.  Lastly, Adrien Brody, who is great in every movie I have seen with him, does the best job in this movie.<br /><br />However, this movie is not perfect, and it has some parts that hurt it.  First, the slow motion sequences in this movie were a bit too much.  It worked well in LOTR, and it would have worked in some scenes, but it was overdone and unneccesary in parts.  Also, the juggling scene with Naomi Watts looked extremely fake, but in the end WHO CARES, since the effects that really mattered were great.  I thought some parts seemed to drag as it took almost an hour to see Kong, but once we did, it is action all the way.  At the same time, it was like an older movie where it builds and builds to something great.  I thought Colin Hanks was annoying as usual and I wonder why he is in so many things with Jack Black.<br /><br />Although my wife felt more emotion towards Kong than I did (ie. I didn't cry!), I did feel like Jackson did as good of a job as he could creating that connect.  I won't be rushing to watch this movie again soon, but it is a movie that should be watched.  My biggest problem was the language...although it didn't have a lot in total, it has a lot of GD's and saying Jesus Christ (or some variation), which annoys me very much to hear.  If I would have known, I would have waited until it came on TV, so it is edited.known, I would have waited until it came on TV, so it is edited.
B00006J3WH|5.0|Buffy The Vampire Slayer Once More With Feeling.  One Of the greatest soundtracks ever.  And for that matter \\"Going Throught The Motions\\" was ok but the sound affect of Buffy slaying the Vampire at oww would have made it much better.  Amber Benson (Tara) God can this woman sing or what.  I meen just hearing her with \\"Under Your Spell\\".  It brought a tear to my eye.  And with Amber and Anthony singing together in \\"Under Your Spell/Standing\\".  I thought the tears wouldn't stop flowing.  They work so well together.  James Marsters man o' man is that man a bloody good singer. \\"Rest In Peace\\".  As the character Spike trying to let Buffy know how he feels about her it is bloody great.  Xander And Anya with \\"I'll Never Tell\\".  Well I take the fifth. Oh what the heck I laughed.  I cried.  I played it again.  The rest of the CD is absolutely Perfect and I would recomend it highly to any and all Buffy The Vampire Slayer fans out there. Now sing it with me now... \\"Where do we go from here?\\"

B000002MUW|5.0|After the \\"Erotica\\" album, Madonna clearly still wanted to express her artistry more.  Her 1994 opus, \\"Bedtime Stories\\" made good on the flirtacious lie that was \\"Erotica\\". How so?  Well \\"Erotica\\", while a decent transitional record, was what I just stated, transitional.  Madonna seemed ready to want to make more \\"album\\" oriented records, but needed to find the right angle to do this.  \\"Erotica\\" suffered from the self-smothering attitude that Shep Pettibone's production & Madonna's misdirected ambition brought.<br /><br />Dallas Austin, Babyface, & Nelle Hooper help helm what still remains Madonna's most sensual, organic, & pleasing record pre-\\"Ray of Light\\" era.  Here, we get eleven cuts, four of which were singles, each listenable & enjoyable.<br /><br />The sound of this record grounds Madonna's pop sensibilities in a more \\"urban\\" or \\"R&B\\" setting.  This isn't \\"R&B-lite\\", but it is pop with an edge.  Madonna glides over buoyant beats & rolling melodies to deliver songs dealing with her familiar subject matter: love & life.  Madonna's voice is strong here & pre-Evita actually showed the direction she would move in on subsequent projects vocally.  \\"Secret\\" utilizes Madonna's range well, showing her move up & down vocally with no such problem.<br /><br />Other highlights include the nitty gritty swing of \\"I'd Rather Be Your Lover\\" with Me'shell NDegeocello on bass & ad-libs. \\"Inside of Me\\" which is actually about her mother, but the lyric is so open it could be about a lover as well.  The latter is beautifully orchestrated with a great backbeat, built around what sounds like Madonna's looped pant. Soft, fluttery horns add a touch of vulnerability to the slight hardness of the beat.<br /><br />\\"Human Nature\\" harkens back to the harshness (attitude & song structure wise) of \\"Erotica\\".  Normally, songs that find the singer in \\"victim\\" mode don't do it for me.  But Madonna doesn't really play the part of victim, more commentator as she calls out the hypocritical pop culture press on their own flaws.<br /><br />The latter half of the record (\\"Sanctuary\\" & the title track), barring the beautiful Canto-pop splendor of \\"Take A Bow\\", also point toward more of Madonna's latter musical evolution. Both find her playing with ambient & electronica sounds, with much success. Even the lyrical work here, languid & only clear upon further listens, seems to note her shift of consciousness toward \\"enlightenment\\".<br /><br />To me, this was Madonna's first actual cohesive album.  One that showed that she was still a singles artist, but able & greatly so of crafting albums that could stand the test of time.  This tends to be forgotten between the controversially overrated \\"Erotica\\" & the sublime \\"Ray of Light\\". Lyrically, vocally, conceptually this record takes everything that she had toyed with prior, making it actually happen.<br /><br />This album was the bridge between the two records, that showed Madonna only gets better with age.

B000002H2H|5.0|behind \\"Master of Puppets.\\"<br /><br />I could never get enough of the first four tunes here since the album's 1984 release and was a bit disappointed that the group released a new mix of \\"Fade to Black.\\"  (They should have left that alone.)  \\"Fight Fire With Fire\\" is a thrash-metal fave that still rocks over twenty years later.<br /><br />What's amazing is the fact that the band didn't suffer from creative burnout after releasing this gem but, instead, churned out another album of introspective heavy-hitters with \\"Master of Puppets\\" a mere two years later (along with a shorter album consisting of covers: \\"The 5.98 EP - Garage Days Revisited\\").  They would continue with \\"...And Justice For All\\" in 1988 and hit their stride with the so-called \\"Black Album\\" in 1991 before going downhill - letting their fame go to their heads (sometimes I wish they would have never agreed to make videos.  Perhaps they would have remained a bit more level-headed).<br /><br />My personal gripe aside, discard what corporate radio deems suitable for you to listen to Metallica-wise and run, don't walk, to your nearest (chain) record store and buy this gem.  Then do yourself the favor and listen to this masterpiece, making sure to push the \\"Repeat\\" button on the CD player because once is not enough.  - Donna Di Giacomo
0446677450|5.0|A few reviews here seem to focus way too much on Kiyosaki's specific investing advice. That's not the point of this book as I see it. The point is to get you thinking differently about money and to gain the perspective of how a rich investor thinks. People seem to read this book thinking they are going to get some kind of specific advice or \\"get rich quick strategies\\" or whatever. When they're told that investing is inherently boring and that they need to start to adopt a more serious mind with regards to money, they move on to the next latest and greatest book. It doesn't suprise me that so few people really become rich- becoming rich takes decipline and mental seriousness that most people don't have or don't want to have. <br /> <br />Me personally, I won't criticise Kiosaki's lifestyle until I'm living it myself. There's a story where he talks about how most accountants, bankers, stock brokers etc aren't rich, yet people for some reason listen to their advice. How can you learn something you want to be from someone who doesn't have it? Likewise, how can you dismiss Kiosaki's ideas as wrong until you have tried and varified them for yourself in your own life. Most people will dismiss things without even trying them, as if they want to prove themselves right somehow. You can be right, or you can be rich. <br /> <br />I would suggest people read this book and make up their own mind, rather then read some reviewer's opinion. I would say for myself that I found it outstanding for giving me a new perspective on money. Even if you're on the path already, I would say it's good to come back to the basics, which is what this book is about. The basics of how to think like a rich person.

0143034901|5.0|What book did the American reviewers read? I found no real connection to Marquez in this work. Quite the contrary, this novel is easy to read, with characters that are fully fleshed out, and a storyline that gives just enough twists and turns to keep the reader interested. There might be an argument made that this work is overly simple, but I feel that might add to the readability. Also, the author normally writes books that are geared toward children, and this is his first foray into the adult realm. I suspect he is going to get better.<br /><br />Other reviewers have called this book surreal and even magical. I would say this book is more fictional noir, and enjoyably so. While there is certainly no Philip Marlowe or Sam Spade here, there is definitely the same feel as the old detective novels of long ago. And as to the charges that women are objectified? Nonsense! I am a woman, and was never insulted. The author does bring in a bit of comedic relief to staunch the darkness of the book, nothing more.<br /><br />The book was thoroughly enjoyable, and I had difficulty putting it down and was sad to see it end. For more correct reviews of the book, look to the European media and not the American media - I'm afraid the American media is attempting to market this work to an audience that will not appreciate this book. However, if one enjoys a mystery, with the feel of an old film noir, while spending time with characters that are enjoyable, in a book that can be difficult to put down, then one might consider giving this one a try.
B00026WU82|5.0|Though his first \\"rock\\" album, and the one that stirred such controversy was the excellent Bringing it All Back Home, Dylan's greatest rock masterpieces are Highway 61 Revisited and the following Blonde on Blonde. This is not rock in the traditional sense so much as it's rock b/c of its attitude, feel, and level of noise. The lyrical style is different from that of his folk albums, but equally brilliant, and among the best in the universe. The musicianship is stellar and the songs even better. Simply put, Dylan didn't just record a rock album, he recorded one of the finest ever created. \\"Like a Rolling Stone\\" is considered by several to be the greatest single ever released, and is certainly one of the 10 best, and thus it is the song that may attract many non-Dylan fans to the album, but truly not one second of any track is wasted. The sharp wit, scathing commentary and voice, wailing guitars, and raucous rhythm section are purely sublime. This album was so far ahead of its time, that the times haven't caught up to it yet. This is one of the albums that showed that rock could be art, not just noise.  Some favorites, though it's hard not to mention all the tracks, are the bluesy and high-energy \\"Tombstone Blues,\\" the dark, yet also darkly funny, \\"Ballad of a Thin Man,\\" the mythical\\"Highway 61\\" and the last two tracks which rank among Dylan's very best offerings, \\"Just Like Tom Thumb's Blues,\\" and the breathtaking epic closing track \\"Desolation Row.\\" Anyone that isn't typically into Dylan should give this album a shot, and anyone that likes him and doesn't have it, needs it. Even folk purists should be hard pressed to find fault with Dylan for creating art of such high quality.
B000HBK3MM|5.0|Corinne Bailey Rae's voice is so beautiful, pure and gentle, and her songs are uplifting and inspiring.  It's been a long time since I was able to find an album that I enjoy all the way through.  Every song is perfect and simple.  When I listen, I can almost feel the sunlight on my face and taste a cool, sweet glass of lemonade on my tongue.
B00004XOWM|1.0|Once I tried to get into what was popular at the time to see what the hype was all about, after trying this album, I decided that I wasn't ready to expand my horizons to the point of listening to artless, immature, untalented, unimaginative, banal, idiotic, rap-rockers that are neither good at rap nor rock and are less hardcore (contrary to what they think) than Britney Spears. I was depressed that people could stoop to the level of actually thinking this garbage was any good, the disc's only useful purpose could be as an expensive coaster or something.
B000002UA0|5.0|NO NEED TO GET INTO DETAIL.  THIS IS A PSYCHEDELIC MASTERPIECE AND THERE WILL NEVER BE ANOTHER LIKE IT, PERIOD!  RECORDED IN 1967 AT EMI STUDIOS THE SAME TIME THE BEATLES WERE RECORDING SGT. PEPPER AND THE PRETTY THINGS WERE RECORDING S.F. SORROW.  EVERY SONG IS OF THE ESSENCE AS THIS IS SYD BARRETT'S MAGNUM OPUS.  MY FAVORITE SYD BARRETT PENNED PINK FLOYD SONG IS \\"SEE EMILY PLAY\\" WHICH WAS INCLUDED ON THE AMERICAN TOWER (CAPITOL SUBSIDIARY) RELEASE OF PIPER AT THE GATES OF DAWN, NOT THE UK EMI RELEASE.  WITH IT'S OUTERSPACE GUITAR EFFECTS, FARFISA, CHARMING MELODY LINES AND SYD'S DISTINCT BRITISH VOCALS, IT IS A WONDERFUL TUNE THAT WILL LEAVE AN IMPRESSION ON A CHILD OF ANY AGE!  IT IS THE MOST PERFECT SONG FROM THE PSYCHEDELIC SUMMER OF 1967.  YOU ARE WITH US SYD, IN SOUND AND VIBRATIONS.  REST IN PEACE......
B00006LIRI|5.0|Not the hugest U2 fan but my love of them grew after listening to this album.  A good mix of popular and those I've never heard.
B000E41MS6|5.0|The DVD arrived promptly.  My husband loves this series and has already watched the shows in their entirity.
B000002U82|5.0|I'm not going to bother to try to describe this album.  There is nothing I can say about it that hasn't been said millions of times by millions of people for over thirty years.  It is simply a work of genius. Personally, I think it's Pink Floyd's second best album, next to Wish You Were Here.  At the same time, I think this is Pink Floyd's most important album.
0316172324|2.0|This book is based on the observation that, for better or worse, we make decisions in the blink of an eye and that the ability to \\"thin slice\\" information is often crucial for timely action.  This is all well and good, but I was hoping for information on how to cultivate this skill, avoid misusing it, etc.  All the book gives is example after example, after example.  Might be worth reading if you've never thought about it before.
B000FS9FCQ|5.0|Okay, I'll make this short.  Once again, the Wachowski brothers have done it.  V for Vendetta is a very powerful film.  Without losing an inescapable sense of reality, the creators of the Matrix have managed to bring to the screen a futuristic world that leaves audiences thinking. <br /> <br />As a summary, V for Vendetta tells the story of pretty Evey Hammond (Natalie Portman), a young woman trying to stay inconspicuous in the frightening London of the future.  However, during a late-night, dark-alley attack, she is saved by V, a masked terrorist that, for some reason, intrigues her.  When V blows up \\"The Bailey\\", a building in the heart of London, later that night, the government's police forces suspect Evey to have been privy to the plot.  Later, V holds the most-watched and government-sanctioned television network (called BTC) hostage and addresses the nation.  He asks England's citizens to rally against their corrupt government on the next November the 5th.  During the months preceding November the 5th, Evey becomes enmeshed in V's plans and the conspiracies and corruption of the government.  As the film progresses, the audience becomes increasingly aware of V's dark past and the secret that has brought the government to power and which it will kill to keep. <br /> <br />I am sure that other reviewers will say that this movie sanctions terrorism.  V for Vendetta, however, is a powerful film simply because it makes the audience think about terrorism and our world on a completely different level.  The scary part about this movie is that V and Evey's world does not seem so detached from our own.  It has a certain and eerie that-could-actually-happen quality. <br /> <br />This is one of the first movies that I have seen in a long time that made me reflect so much on real-world issues.  V for Vendetta is a sci-fi-esque thriller with a connection to today's world.
B00000JG41|5.0|California is the most accesible album by the infamous group known as Mr. Bungle(R.I.P). Arguably their best album out of the three major release. Combining their taste for the abstract/jazz/metal/funk/eastern and traditional flavors as well as a California Surf style that bands like the Beach Boys poularized. Using traditional instruments and non-traditional instruments, Mike Patton and the boys have crafted a masterpiece that spans over various genres and styles and breaks all boundries and pushes the envelope of amazing music way past its limit. Amazing musicianship and creative melodies and beautiful crooning make this album a true treat to listen to. I would argue that this is their BEST album period. Having the ability to tatke abstract and structure and mash them together is a talent that is hard to come by. Mr.Bungle have a style all their own, and despite all the many copycats, there are NONE that can emulate Mr.Bungle's style and grace. The many tempo changes and style changes throughout songs is phenomenal! <br />Sweet Charity has a Beach Boys/Hawaiian style to it, very cool and the singing is like over the top dramatic style. It's amazing. <br />None of them knew they were robots is stright up swing with abstractities thrown in. Then name speaks for itself. <br />Retrovirtigo has a nice chilled out vibe. <br />The Air-conditioned nightmare is another Beach Boy's style sound with beautiful vocals. <br />Ars meriendi has a middle eastern feel to it mixed with rock, an awesome song with reggae breakdowns and high speeds. <br />Pink Cigarette has a 50's style doo wop sound and is very creepy and haunting. Amazing crooning by Mr. Patton <br />Golem II: The bionic vapour boy is a mysterious and eerie sort of chanting tune, very good and spine chilling. <br />The Holy Filament has a funky, electronic abstact feel. <br />Vanity fair has a 50's doo wop sound, a great feel good song with awesome vocals <br />Goodbye sober day is a funky song that has a fierce chanting breakdown in the middle of the song. <br />This album is a MUST own, it defines music as a whole and is the definitive Mr.Bungle album. If you have never heard of Mr. Bungle before, pick this one up! Their other two albums are great as well. Their first release is much more SKA with more horns and a little rap influence, and their second release is their most abstract with more synth, organs and off the wall antics.
B0007VCZ50|4.0|a solid addition to the rockumentary genre. this captures sting as make his foray into solo work with his first solo album and a band of jazz superstars. <br /> <br />looking back it is obvious that sting was meant to have a solo career (and arguably he was solo with the police). at the time of this movie, it was not so obvious and the suspense around how he will fare is interesting. the music is super, the behind the scenes look is interesting and his band of jazz luminaries adds richness.
B0001I55OC|5.0|Director Richard Donner (LADYHAWKE, SUPERMAN, LETHAL WEAPON I, II, III, IV, etc.) leads an ensemble cast of stars Gerard Butler, Billy Connolly, Frances O'Connor, Ethan Embry, Morton Csokas and David Thewlis \\"back into time only to find out that if history had not been changed by these characters the present might not exist!\\" (Yeah! I wrote those words! Not another critic yet it's a true analysis of this fantastic film!)<br /><br />  If you loved Richard Donner's LADYHAWKE then TIMELINE (2003) based on the novel by Michael Crichton should capture your need to escape for a good two hours entirely! Modern day archeological students go into the past by way of new age technology in order to rescue their professor. ON the way and IN the way are knights of not so good caliber, ladies in distress and one man in particular who finds himself lured to a past he never realized existed for him until he is there!<br /><br />  My rating of TIMELINE is FIVE STARS! I can sit here and give away the plot but in order for you, the viewer to truly enjoy it, I'm not! When I saw TIMELINE for the first time it was in order to see another wonderful DONNER PRODUCTION and Billy Connolly, a Scot to whom my heart had been lost. The character of \\"Marek\\" (Gerard Butler) enslaved me upon my first sight of him! As \\"Creedy\\" in REIGN OF FIRE I'd fallen slightly under his spell and was willing to battle with dragons that I'd gone to cheer on in the film. \\"Creedy's\\" torched demise gave me cause to end their existence. \\"Marek\\" is yet another character such as LADYHAWKES \\"Navarre.\\" (Rutger Hauer) For ladies who love a beleaguered knight without armor and men who like a man's man, \\"Marek\\" is your fellow!<br /><br />  TIMELINE is wonderful fun but enough of a twist to make you think about what actually would happen should we have the technology to \\"back to the future!\\" This is one film not only well worth the money but well worth the time to view over again and again! For ladies who despair of a real man keep this one within hand's grasp at a moment's notice! :-)one within hand's grasp at a moment's notice! :-) <br />
078322947X|4.0|For being an old movie it was entertaining, I saw it years ago when it came out and it is still good, worth seeing.
B00004XQP4|1.0|My friends first and foremost I would want everyone to ignore the previous reviewer(An alias of Whirligig) and avoid this lousy Green Day cd.Green day are legends only in the previous reviewer\\"s mind.Their only listenable cd is Dookie which only deserves a two star rating.Forget Green day,listen to Led Zeppelin's debut album instead.that rocks!,not this.
1878424777|5.0|I purchased the CD set & absolutely love it.  If only we could all live by by these four agreements - it would change our lives.  I really like having the cd as I can play it over & over.  Practice makes the master!!
B000001G1E|5.0|James Brown and the Famous Flames are PURE DYNAMITE and this BOX SET is the GREATEST EVER RECORDED...But I wonder ...just how many people reviewing this CD SET really KNOW just WHO The FAMOUS FLAMES really were? If you ,like so many other music writers and Rock historians think that the FLAMES were the name of JAMES BROWN'S BAND ...you are INCORRECT !!! Please go back and read or re- read James' autobiography...then go on the internet and obtain the movies SKI PARTY and the TAMI SHOW.Then read the liner notes on the LIVE AT THE APOLLO CD...and ALL of the POLYDOR CD re-issues of James and the Flames early albums... such as the \\"PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE\\" album,the \\"THINK\\" album and the TRY ME album...They all say the SAME THING...\\"THE FAMOUS FLAMES ARE NOT THE BACKUP BAND ...THEY ARE THE VOCAL GROUP\\" !!! ANYONE who says otherwise DOESNT KNOW THE HISTORY OF JAMES BROWN!! JAMES himself even explained this on the DAVID LETTERMAN SHOW...but many so- called rock music historians (and quite a few fans} still dont get the MESSAGE !! EVERYONE GIVES JAMES AND THE BAND CREDIT ,BUT NO ONE GIVES THE FAMOUS FLAMES ANY PROPS, BECAUSE NO ONE KNOWS WHO THEY REALLY ARE !! IT'S HIGH TIME TO SEPARATE THE TRUTH FROM ALL THE LIES (AND LIARS ) OUT THERE!! THE FAMOUS FLAMES STARTED OUT AS A COMBINATION VOCAL/INSTRUMENTAL group from GEORGIA fronted by singer/musician BOBBY BYRD, who was actually the man who discovered JAMES BROWN, while the latter was an inmate at a GEORGIA JUVENILE DETENTION FACILITY.BOBBY'S FAMILY sponsored his release and JAMES and his former cellmate/friend JOHNNY TERRY joined BOBBY'S group.This is the group(the original FLAMES} that recorded PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE and several other songs over a two year period in the mid fifties {SEE PAGE 16 IN THE \\"STAR TIME\\" BOOKLET}... but that group BROKE UP. Around 1958, after several rotating members came and went,JAMES RE- FORMED THE FLAMES, this time as a STRAIGHT VOCAL GROUP.THE FAMOUS FLAMES were: BOBBY BYRD-the group's founder,whohad returned to the group, BOBBY BENNETT,and the late LLOYD STALLWORTH..who replaced departing original member JOHNNY TERRY...(JAMES IS SHOWN WITH THE FAMOUS FLAMES ON PAGES 20 AND 46 OF THE BOOKLET ACCOMPANYING THIS BOX SET }.JAMES BROWNS BAND was called ...believe it or not... THE JAMES BROWN BAND !! This means that stellar players such as FRED WESLEY, MACEO PARKER, ALFRED \\"PEE WEE \\" ELLIS, SINCLAIR PINKNEY, AND OTHERS were BAND MEMBERS...NOT FAMOUS FLAMES !! THE FAMOUS FLAMES AND THE BAND WERE TWO SEPARATE ENTITES !! The ROLLING STONE HISTORY OF ROCK AND ROLL was one of the few printed publications that actually GOT IT RIGHT! In showing a picture of the JB troupe on stage back in the sixties..it clearly stated that JAMES was...\\"with the Famous Flames AND the James Brown Band!! Why the confusion? Part of the reason centered around a very strange practice of KING RECORDS (JAMES' record label back then) of showing ONLY THE LEAD SINGER on many of their vocal groups' classic fifties and sixties albums.They did this- not only with JAMES BROWN AND THE FLAMES'albums...but with HANK BALLARD AND THE MIDNIGHTERS'albums as well. People only know what they see...And what they saw was only JAMES BROWN'S AND HANK BALLARD'S faces on the album covers...AND NOT THEIR RESPECTIVE GROUPS.Another problem is the unfortunate practice on the part of music writers over the last 15 years or so of calling the great r&b vocal groups \\"bands\\" because their rock- oriented counterparts were. (example..artists such as THE MIRACLES,THE TEMPTATIONS,AND THE FOUR TOPS ARE NOT \\"BANDS\\",BUT RATHER VOCAL GROUPS OR SINGING GROUPS...While artists such as THE BEATLES , THE ROLLING STONES,AND THE BEACH BOYS are bands..They actually play instruments on stage).These two factors have combined to cause a confusion toward THE FAMOUS FLAMES in the eyes of the music buying public that has persisted to this day... and has cost them a possible spot in the ROCK AND ROLL HALL OF FAME along with JAMES,which they so richly deserve.(ANYONE WHO HAS SEEN THE MOTION PICTURE \\"THE TAMI SHOW\\" will have to admit-JAMES BROWN AND THE FAMOUS FLAMES STOLE THE SHOW - BLOWING AWAY THE STONES , THE SUPREMES , AND EVERYONE ELSE}.the FLAMES also appeared with James in the Frankie Avalon movie \\"SKI PARTY\\" in a non- singing, non-speaking role,and on the ED SULLIVAN SHOW twice,dressed differently than the band, and unfortunately uncredited .In 1964,James stopped recording with the FLAMES in the studio,But they still continued to perform with him on stage for another 4-5 years...and their name still appeared on the records,so most people thought the name applied to the band.THE FAMOUS FLAMES are one of the great UNSUNG GROUPS in ROCK and ROLL & R&B history . After the FLAMES disbanded , BOBBY BYRD remained with James, and that's his voice you hear echoing James on hits such as \\"SEX MACHINE\\",\\"SOUL POWER\\", \\"MAKE IT FUNKY\\",AND \\"GET ON UP, GET INTO IT,GET INVOLVED\\" . So,the next time you listen to \\"live at the apollo\\", or early hits such as \\"PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE\\" , \\"TRY ME\\",\\"THINK\\", \\"BEWILDERED\\",\\"OH BABY DONT YOU WEEP\\",\\"I'LL GO CRAZY\\" or other great songs... remember..the guys you hear SINGING ...NOT PLAYING INSTRUMENTS in the background...are indeed the mighty FAMOUS FLAMES..BOBBY BYRD, BOBBY BENNETT,JOHNNY TERRY, AND LLOYD STALLWORTH. read JAMES'AUTOBIOGRAPHY...IT'S ALL THERE..THE FAMOUS FLAMES ARE A SINGING GROUP.. NOT A BAND!!<br /><br />2012 POSTSCRIPT: THE FAMOUS FLAMES were FINALLY inducted into the ROCK AND ROLL HALL OF FAME on April 14th, 2012, some 27 years after the controversial solo induction of lead singer JAMES BROWN in 1986. Congrats to BOBBY BENNETT , the last surviving member...and to the memory and families of BOBBY BYRD, JOHNNY TERRY, and \\"BABY LLOYD\\" STALLWORTH.
B000059XUI|5.0|One of my all time favorites. Very good buy nice price too.
B000EULJLU|5.0|I don't know if you can say there is a best Tool album, but 10,000 days is as close as you'll find.  This is the best new release I've heard this year.  It reminds me of a cross between ...And Justice For All and Dark Side of the Moon (Tool style).
B00003CXRM|3.0|I must say I'm a little surprised at how much others liked this film. It gave me a giggle but I can't say it really gave me any belly-laughs. George Clooney is George Clooney, a bit arrogant and self opinionated, not to say selfish to drag out of the prison two other crooks who had the misfortune to be chained to him although they only had a few weeks to do before being free with the temptation of sharing a 1.2$million booty which didn't really exist. Entertaining but not engrossing.
0385338694|3.0|You know, i started reading this just after reading Melissa Nathan's 'The Nanny'. Both books have similar plotlines - Girl leaves regular life to work serving a family (one as a nanny and one as a housekeeper.) <br /> <br />I didnt like the Nanny at all. It's was quite horrible. But 'The Undmoestic Godess' was a refreshing change after Melissa Nathan's fiasco. The book is much smarter, much funier and much more enjoyable than Nathan's. The characters are more likable and you can sympathise with them. It's intelligent yet fluffy and is good for a bit of light reading. <br /> <br />Not the kind of book you can read again and again, but i'd reccommend it anyway.
0061015725|2.0|Crichton uses his standard formula again in this novel: a startup company develops a new buzz-word technology which goes out of control.  In this case the buzz-word is nanotechnology, which could be interesting, but not with this execution. <br /> <br />The novel's beginning is it's best part.  The protagonist is a family man who is looking for a new tech job in Silicon Valley, when  he begins to notice weird occurences surrounding his wife and kids.  Unfortunately the novel suddenly changes tracks, and most of the interesting early sections of the book are forgotten.  For the latter 2/3 of the novel the reader is treated to detailed yet ridiculous situations involving the biotech organisms in the middle of the desert.  This is one of Chrichton's worst.
B000EGCITG|5.0|This is, by far, the best album I have ever purchased in my life!! P!nk is SO talented, in many ways. The songs are so truthful, and fun.

This girl is the real thing, buy this, and her other 3 albums while your at it!!

0740748475|5.0|I am a sucker for these sorts of collections. Last year I bought the complete Far Side and I also recently acquired this titanic assembling of one of my all-time-favorite (and all-too ephemeral) comic strips, Calvin and Hobbes. This collection is large enough to keep you reading for weeks, and will take you back to those charming days of yesterday, the retrospectively innocent times of the late '80's and '90's when this strip about an imaginative boy and his (I never liked thinking he was only make believe) tiger ruled the papers with a unique mix of nostalgia, forward-thinking, and escapism. The complete cast is here and we can now go back and re-read the entire Calvin and Hobbes saga, from its inception to its (it still bums me out) far too early completion. These strips are masterpieces of their genre and can take a reader on a trip thru hilarity and joy, to sadness, wonder, awe, and then back again. One thing I do wish, however, is Mr. Watterson wouldn't interject with so much commentary here. He should let his characters and strip do the talking. He comes across way too often as a killjoy and an unlikable man. Why he wants to be that way I have no idea. People read his work to be happy and to meld into Calvin's magical mindset. We don't need to hear from Watterson how much he detests marketing and exactly how he thinks time could be better spent. But anyway, if you've got a spare hundred-dollars and really like Calvin and Hobbes, this collection is an enduring record of their life and times. It also looks impressive on a bookshelf, but make sure it's a strong bookshelf, as this baby comes in at about twenty pounds.
B000CPH9I4|5.0|I honestly thought that most of the music on this album were Irish standards until I looked at the liner notes and saw that the Coors had writing credits on all of them.  I heard it while at a book store and had to buy it that night, it moved me so much.  The music is wonderful and traditional and moves the Irish soul.
B000F7CMRW|4.0|Good movie depicting the unseen realizations of what terrorism may be defined as apart from the United States.   <br /> <br />Amidst the powerful corruption observed underneath a heavily influenced media lie issues few Americans ever consider or are aware of.  Syriana attempts to shine light on the fact that such issues exist.  Viewer may leave with a sense of disbelief or revolutionary disdain; either of which express a sense of self exhibited from somewhere inside.  Ultimately, the amount of time spent thinking about the movie after its viewing seems to be the determining factor of what it means to you.   <br /> <br />George Clooney certainly gives a stellar performance.
0375831002|5.0|From the glowingly descriptive words and heart rending illustrations, The Book Thief -- like its characters -- worms its way into your emotions.  <br /> <br />Zusak creates an ethereal world of Nazi Germany that is heart breaking and profound. He puts faces, both ugly and beautiful, to the horrors of that time and place. <br />
B000005Z0G|5.0|production-wise this album can get somewhat boring for a few tracks around halfway through, but cuts like \\"keep ya head up\\" and \\"I get around\\" more than make up for the weaker points. \\"last wordz\\" features ice cube and ice t and is probably my favorite track. it shows the 3 best to ever do it from the west coast trading mics easily over a nice beat. <br /> <br />you'll notice a lot of scratching on here to provide the hooks and the production sounds more like it's from new york, but that just shows pac's versatility. a 4.5 star album because of the weak tracks, but I'll round up and give it 5. definitely buy this as well as all of pac's other cds before death row and \\"all eyez on me\\".
B00003CXS4|5.0|One of the best movies I may have watched...the movie has several humorous lines and caused me to laugh out loud many times.  The movie is pretty violent but it didnt bother me to much.  I love the many eccentric characters especially Mickey played by Brad Pitt.  Themany stroyline were beautifully woven together for an amazing climax.
B00005ATQD|5.0|Stanley Kubrick obviously cared little if this film was appreciated, especially by mass audiences.  This is probably because he tried to educate more than entertain, albeit, through dazzlingly enjoyable, cinematic imagery.  Anyhow, such is the nature of gifted geniuses who are successful enough in their own time to do so.  Most directors (Hollywood) are unfortunately driven by less virtuous inspiration.    <br />Certainly, Eyes Wide Shut is more of an educational experience than entertainment.  There is no classic protagonist to win us over, nobody triumphs, and nothing is resolved.  And, to make things really disturbing, evil wins the day. <br />Nowadays, many have difficulty admitting in the existence of evil, especially that of the demonic sort.  In this film, evil is clearly presented and symbolized in demonic worship.  It is revealed midway through the film, with no forewarning at all. <br />How this ties in to human sexual behavior is for the viewer to conclude.  However, the story teller pulls no punches as to his intention.  Fortunately, language and visual imagery need not be overly explicit for most of us, depending on how wide our eyes are open and, simultaneously, on how tight our minds are shut. <br />   <br />
B000058983|5.0|most everything which will be said about arthur lee will probably be on line rather than in a steemy memphis funeral home.but, to leave a thing of beauty behind such as forever changes will have a profound effect on many, many people.be sure to pass this album on to your friends and children as no one will be able to say that they saw this old rocker performing some old 60's stuff and it was really really good
B000E1ZBFY|5.0|This movie portraits a young Karol Wojtyla and the struggles and circumstances he and his close friends and family lived during WWII in Poland. Finding his vocation as a priest and following God's plan for his life he becomes bishop, cardinal and eventually Pope. The acting is absolutely wonderful.  I recommend this movie to all catholics and non-catholics alike.
B0007TKNIS|5.0|As a child I grew up watching both Italian and English musicals/operas on video and had the privilege of attending several on stage performances. Sadly, as should be expected, many of the movie productions shined a very dim light in comparison to their luminous live counterparts. However, this is not the case with The Phantom of the Opera. After seeing the play, reading the original novel by Gaston Leroux, and another interpretational novel by Susan Kay, I was anxious to see how the power of film would affect this literary and musical masterpiece. Upon watching the movie with my ever-movie-going cousin, I am overjoyed to announce that this film will live in my memory forever, and that the DVD will be proud addition to my collection.<br /><br />Removing all the musical and historical aspects, the film is a beautiful example of skilled cinematography; they way director Joel Schumacher gracefully changed from a black and white present to a colored past was striking and breathtaking. His use of the Vicomte de Chaney (Patrick Wilson) as a link between the times not only adds to the minor character's importance, but provides a mysterious twist to the end of the story, leaving the audience thirsty for the answer to the burning question \\"What happened to the Phantom?\\" Furthermore, the casting, although there have been some negative reviews based on the use of certain actors or the lack thereof, was perfect: Christine Daae (Emmy Rossum) was the ideal image of childish innocence and womanly passion, she was able to draw the reader into an otherwise wimpy character and show the strength of her love for Raul the Vicomte de Chaney (Patrick Wilson) who matches Gaston Leroux's original description of a love sick, pampered, youth...And what can I say of the Phantom (Gerard Butler)?! Aside from his dashing good looks and alluring personality, he is a great actor who perfectly fit the mold of a possessive and domineering admirer/teacher. Sporting a mask that covers half his face, he stalks about the Paris Opera House wreaking havoc on those who disobey his order, while showing such care for the young Christine that fill the audience with compassion. although I have read some reviews that question Schumacher's choice of such an actor, I believe that if some RESEARCH is done (read Gaston Leroux's original novel) one finds that the Phantom has more enthralling qualities that cannot be accurately expressed on film, so bodily perfection had to compensate for literary imagination (and trust me he had ALL my attention).<br /><br />And the music, which remained virtually unchanged from the original d&eacute;but of 1986 London musical, is \\"in a word sublime\\"! (As the Phantom would say). Andrew Lloyd Webber's masterpiece was brought to new life by the powerful voices of Rossom, Butler, and Wilson who sung beautifully in duets, singles, and all-cast pieces. Although not the original voices of Sarah Brightman and Michael Crawford, these novel voices have an alluring quality of their own (and make the soundtrack a worth while purchase).<br /><br />All in all, The Phantom of the Opera is a must see for phantom fanatics and romantics everywhere, a worthwhile viewing for good movie watchers. And although it is not a perfectly, direct, flawless, identical reproduction of the Broadway play, it is (as previous reviewer stated) \\"a welcome exception to the long line of ill-conceived Broadway-to-movie travesties.\\"he stalks about the Paris Opera House wreaking havoc on those who disobey his order, while showing such care for the young Christine that fill the audience with compassion. although I have read some reviews that question Schumacher's choice of such an actor, I believe that if some RESEARCH is done (read Gaston Leroux's original novel) one finds that the Phantom has more enthralling qualities that cannot be accurately expressed on film, so bodily perfection had to compensate for literary imagination (and trust me he had ALL my attention).  <br /> <br />And the music, which remained virtually unchanged from the original début of 1986 London musical, is \\"in a word sublime\\"!

B0000UJDLM|3.0|What would you do if your $11 million killer robot suffered a serious power surge, escaped, and now, rather than blowing up tanks and troops and stuff, was out chasing butterflies and convincing animal loving Ally Sheedy that a) he's not a martian, and b) he's alive?  Why, you'd send out the military/goon types to bring him back so you could disassemble him and find out what went wrong.  Right?<br /><br />  Well, disassembling a robot is an awful lot like dissecting an animal, and it doesn't take long for that ingratiating buckets of bolts who calls himself Five (\\"Five alive!\\") to figure any of that out.  With the resourceful Ally on board Five is soon learning about life and eluding his bumbling pursuers.  Among those in pursuit is Five's creator, Steve Guttenberg, and his vaguely Indian or Pakastani assistant Fisher Stevens.  The movie indicates that there's an urgency to finding the errant robot before the guys with the guns do, but it's hard to tell - the actor Guttenberg doesn't do `urgency' terribly well, and Fisher Stevens seems an over-caffienated bundle of energy.  While in most movies either character would be too much (or too little,) in SHORT CIRCUIT the two rather neatly cancel each other out.<br /><br /> SHORT CIRCUIT is one of those movies you like despite yourself.  It's corny and obvious and seemed aimed at non-discriminating 10-year-olds.  Guttenberg is a cinderblock of an actor, and while I bought Five's breathless declaration - \\"Five alive!\\" - if I heard Guttenberg say it I'd probably ask for proof. Whatever humor you can milk from ineptly gung-ho military types is milked dry long before they put away their guns.  Still, this one seems safe and relatively acceptable to all age groups.  Sheedy's a marvel, and her scenes with Five contain whatever magic this story holds.  Probably not a classic, but touching in spots.  Medium strong recommendation.

0786838655|5.0|My 9 year old son loved this book.  He says \\"This book is awesome!!You like action? Its got action all right. If you like mythology you will definitely like this book. It starts off slow, but don't let hold you back from reading it because after the first part it's non-stop action!\\"
B000002513|4.0|I have a kind of love-hate relationship with Springsteen. I LOVE his earlier stuff, but I'm not so keen on his more recent material. I LOVE his concerts when he's got the E Street Band with him, but I don't really care for his solo shows. <br /> <br />As for this album, I almost love it. I definitely like and recommend it.  <br /> <br />My problem is that it's successor, \\"Born to Run,\\" is, in my opinion, the greatest rock album of all time. It represents greatness, and was Springsteen's pinnacle album. \\"The Wild...\\" also is a fantastic, solid album, but it falls just short of that greatness for me. <br /> <br />Having said that, I often find myself listening to these two albums together because you can hear the beginnings of the masterful songwriting and musical composition that elevates \\"Born to Run\\" to legendary status. For example, the musical playfulness that makes \\"10th Avenue Freeze Out\\" such a timeless song seems to have grown its roots on this album's \\"Rosalita.\\" <br /> <br />\\"The Wild...\\" is the perfect preamble to \\"Born to Run:\\" enjoyable and solid in its own right, and a teasing taste of what's to come.
B000001ZS4|5.0|Though he didn't define the genre of electronic or space music (that awards should probably go to Tangerine Dream), Jean-Michel Jarre clearly took it to the masses. Though \\"Equinoxe\\" was his third album (his first one was \\"Deserted Palace\\" in 1972, followed by \\"Oxygene\\" four years later), for many people it was their introduction to his work and to this type of music altogether. I was one of them: I can clearly remember the first time I listened to it, its surround feel and its ethereal quality, and all it made me feel back then.<br /><br />Close to thirty years after its release in 1978, the album still holds on strong. I know this may sound cheesy, but if there's any album that makes me feel like a seagull hovering over the coastline, it is this one. More specifically, parts 2, 3 and 4 of the album transport me every single time. I wish you the same joy while listening to \\"Equinoxe\\" that I've experienced time and again.
B000000OF6|5.0|I had been a casual Queen fan most of my life - well, ever since Wayne's World made Bohemian Rhapsody a hit. At the time, I got myself a copy of \\"A Night At The Opera,\\" and have enjoyed it in the years since. (In fact, I recommend it as a companion to this greatest hits collection.) <br /> <br />But recently I was at an Aqualung concert, and to end the show Matt covered \\"Somebody to Love.\\" It was so awesome, that it got me thinking about Queen again, and really craving their music. Which brings me to this collection. I was familiar with about half the songs here, which was great. But what I'm most happy about is all the new Queen music it has introduced me to (such as \\"Radio Ga Ga\\" and \\"The Show Must Go On\\"). <br /> <br />I can't say whether it's an accurate \\"greatest hits\\" anthology, but I can say that there are a ton of awesome songs here. If you're a casual fan like me, then this collection will lead you into die-hard fan land. And it's guaranteed to blow your mind. :)
B00005JOSS|3.0|I'm not sure if it has been mentioned that this was a concept taken from a Korean movie internationally titled \\"Il Mare.\\"  Although the U.S. version was not a bad movie, it could've been so much more.  From the casting, to the adaptive screenwriting, this film had so much potential but fell amazingly short.  It's really disappointing, and not the first time, where a foreign film is adapted and the U.S. version is unfortunately the dumbed down version.  What I loved about the Korean version was the subtle development of their love.  I loved the exchange of letters talking about their struggles with being single and their heartbreaks from previous relationships.  As they grew close through their letters, their were moments where he would spy on the girl.  There was beauty in those moments, knowing who she was to him, but unable to do anything at that moment but observe her life from afar because they had not met.  So blatant is the U.S. version where Keanu just shows up and makes out with the girl in the past, ruining any kind of tension and agony of waiting and watching.  *SPOILER ALERT*  Towards the end of the Korean version, when the guy doesn't show up at the appointed time, the girl sends a letter asking him if he could help her ensure that she and her ex-boyfriend do not split up at one fateful moment.  In love, he abides by her wishes and shows up the day of her break up and gets involved in a tragic accident. *END OF SPOILER*  The U.S. version forcefully tells use that these two are in love and does not nurture it, because the filmmakers believe that if we can't see it, we won't feel it.  I aliken the two movies to smelling a flower.  The Korean version is like going up to a flower and smelling it where as the U.S. version is like taking a flower, crushing it in your hands, so that you can ensure that you can smell the scent.
B00005JP5J|4.0|If you have ever attended a family reunion or sat down at an extended family holiday dinner and thought to yourself \\"Who are these people?  How could I possibly be related to them?\\" -- then you will probably appreciate the hilarious and poignant indie film \\"Little Miss Sunshine.\\"<br /><br />Richard (Greg Kinnear) is the head of a mostly dysfunctional family and the author of a multi-step/self-help program that he espouses with the passion of a zealot.  Sheryl (Toni Collette) is Richard's wife and arguably the most normal and high-functioning member of the family.  Their son, Dwayne (Paul Dano), is a nihilistic and remote 15-year-old, who has either stopped speaking to his family because he can't stand them or taken a vow of silence to achieve a personal goal - depending on who is explaining his behavior.  Olive (Abigail Breslin) is the family's bright and effervescent 7-year-old, who is already starting to pick up some of the family's more unhealthy tics of criticism and self-doubt.  Grandpa (Alan Arkin) is Richard's acerbic and outspoken father who was booted out of his retirement home for snorting heroin.  Add to this murky Freudian soup Sheryl's brother, Frank (a wonderfully restrained Steve Carell), who is newly released from the hospital after a failed suicide attempt.<br /><br />When a message is left on the family's phone machine notifying them of Olive's acceptance into the semi-finals of the Little Miss Sunshine talent competition in California, they decide to (mostly) put aside their personal agendas and take Olive to the pageant.  The combustible road trip is fueled by the radically different personalities bumping up against each other within the close confines of a VW bus and exacerbated by a variety of obstacles thrown at them in what seems to be a cosmic conspiracy designed to prevent the family from reaching the competition.<br /><br />When the family finally does arrive at the pageant, the weirdness well and truly begins.  Now I am someone who really loves a good horror story, but the 6 and 7 year old contestants were far scarier than anything you might see in a George Romero movie.  I will take flesh melting zombies over little girls in full theatrical makeup and provocative costumes (that just screamed \\"JonBenet Ramsey\\") any day.  The whole pageant atmosphere was Fellini-esque and completely cringe-inducing.  When Olive is finally called upon to do her performance piece for the audience (a real show stopper which I won't spoil by detailing), she is actually the most wholesome and entertaining part of the whole pageant.<br /><br />Although this family bickers with one another almost constantly, they manage to close ranks and support each other when it truly counts.  Part of the pleasure of watching this film was the talented cast, who looked like they were really enjoying themselves.  A wonderful way to spend 90 minutes -- and you will probably come away with a deeper appreciation of your own family.story, but the 6 and 7 year old contestants were far scarier than anything you might see in a George Romero movie.

0679422714|5.0|This excellent book is difficult to read only because it catalogs such an exhausting array of tortures, mutilations, betrayals, adulteries, treasons, murders and other crimes. Authors Jung Chang and Jon Halliday have done an extraordinary job of compiling a wealth of information. They had access to Soviet archives that shed new light on Mao's rise to - and ruthless exercise of - power. If the book has a defect, it is that despite the authors' 10 years of exhaustive research, readers may find this report of staggering cruelty almost impossible to believe. There's no denying that it's thoroughly reported. However the authors have a distinct negative bias. No matter how well backgrounded, it can also be perceived as a form of anti-Mao propaganda. Yet if even a fraction of what is here reported were true, it could all be true. We find this book relevant, not only to historians, but also to anyone doing business in China or simply curious about the country. Chinese society made Mao - one of history's worst mass murderers - possible and Mao, in turn, indelibly marked Chinese society. It is impossible to know one without knowing the other.

1573223085|4.0|This fun, exciting read suggests many ways to develop your \\"right-brain\\" thinking - the kind of relationship-based thought patterns that author Daniel Pink argues will be essential in the emerging \\"Conceptual Age.\\" Pink draws examples from numerous disciplines, industries and locations. The result is thought-provoking and applicable. We recommend this work to individuals and companies committed to change and open to originality; its tools will raise your capacities. Pink's reasoning about the forces shaping this new age is striking in its simple rigor, as are the questions he offers that let you check how ready you and your business are for the economy that is emerging. His emphasis on the positive is the book's one weakness. He doesn't really address how trauma or turmoil would affect the driving forces of the Conceptual Age. Also, he only briefly touches upon those aspects of business where right brain thinking is hard to apply. What's here is good, but what's left out is somewhat troubling.

B00005JNJV|5.0|my prayers have been answered. after the Batman series was left a smoldering corpse after Batman & Robin it looked like the dark knight would never rise again. then Christopher Nolan and David Groyer picked up the project. jump starting the series all over again getting ride of those neon lights, cheesy dialouges, and thos ridiculous bat nipples, this new Batman flick erases the events of the first four films and take us way back to Batman's origins. we find our hero Bruce Wayne in some prison were he meets the mysterious Ducard (Neeson in another mentor role) who takes him to the league of shadows ruled by the mysterios Ra's Al Ghul. after his training he returns to Gotham City to find it a mess. criminals roam the street, people in power are corrupt, and no one has the guts to stand up and take action. its then Bruce becomes Batman, fighting to save Gotham from the corrupt crime bosses to the vile Scarecrow. Christian Bale is perfect as the dark knight, almost as perfect as Micheal Keaton, who most remembered as the lunatic from American Psycho but he brings the Batman's hurt and pain and some light hearteness that made Keaton so good. Katie Holmes is surprisingly very good in her first grown-up role. Micheal Caine as the good butler Alfred brings some well needed comic relief. not just those three but the other cast memebers are great from Gary Oldman, Cillian Murphy, Tom Wilkinson, and Ken Watanabie in his fairly small role. this movie really saved the franchise and i can't wait until the sequel titled \\"the Dark Knight\\" (pretty nicely fitted) comes out, ecpecially when Heath Ledger (the guy from Brokeback Mountain) will be playing the Joker. i know, a bit of an odd choice but still we thought Nicholson was an odd choice for the original Joker and look how that turned out. so, if your a true Bat-aholic this is the film we've been waiting for.

B000CBSHK2|1.0|I'm a loyal Orton fan; Trailer Park is her best, and I'm a fan the \\"other side of daybreak\\". This cd is a complete disappointment. It is trite, boring, and political in a very dull and usual way; it has none of the distinctive thoughtfulness, charm, and melancholy that so characterize most of Orton's work. I get the distinct feeling that she didn't have this cd in her, but just put it out there because there were so many (ourselves) who were waiting. Orton's merit is that her songs come from her heart; these songs come from her head. These songs sound little different from so much soulless folk-pop, and have all the authenticity of a millionaire rockstar whining about being downtrodden. <br /> <br />We wish Beth the best; but we also wish she would give us her best; and if she can't do that, well, we'll be content with her 'classics'.
B000069HZP|3.0|+++++<br /><br />\\"What do you get for the man who has everything?\\"<br /><br />This is the question Conrad Van Orton (Sean Penn) asks himself.  Conrad is the wayward brother of control-freak Nicholas (Michael Douglas), a wealthy and aloof San Francisco investment banker whose 48th birthday is coming up.<br /><br />Conrad finally decides on a unique birthday present: a gift certificate to \\"Consumer Recreation Services\\" (or \\"CRS\\").  The service provided by CRS is a game.<br /><br />A friend of Nicks who has already \\"played\\" the game gives him a hint of what it's about by quoting a passage from the Bible:<br /><br />\\"Whereas once I was blind, now I can see.\\"<br /><br />Once Nick officially signs up for the game a series of bad and bizarre things begin happening to him, things beyond his control and things designed to make him lose his high status.<br /><br />There is actually a double climatic ending that, in my case, I found emotionally satisfying.<br /><br />Michael Douglas does a good job of portraying the aloof investment banker whose life has suddenly spun out of control.  Sean Penn who only appears in a few scenes makes the best of his limited screen time.<br /><br />The background music enhanced each scene.  This movie was also well photographed.<br /><br />There are two major problems I found with this movie:<br /><br />First, it is far-fetched.  This is supposed to be a game where everything is controlled.  However, some of the things that happen to Nick are totally uncontrollable.<br /><br />Second, the movie is much to long.  Because of its long length, it became tedious for me to watch.  In my opinion, this movie could have been a half hour shorter and still presented an effective story.<br /><br />Finally, the DVD itself is perfect in picture and sound quality.  It has the movie in wide screen on one side and full screen on the other.  There are minimal extras.<br /><br />In conclusion, despite its problems, this is still an interesting and unique movie!!<br /><br />*** 1/2<br /><br />(1997;  2 hr, 10 min;  wide screen/full screen;  19 scenes;  rated `R')<br /><br />+++++r /><br />*** 1/2<br /><br />(1997;  2 hr, 10 min;  wide screen/full screen;  19 scenes;  rated `R')<br /><br />+++++
0156421178|5.0|I say insightful because I, of course, had read 1984 and Animal Farm in high school. I knew about Orwell's participation in the Spanish Civil War with the POUM/\\"Trotskyite\\" sympathzing Independent Labour Party and that it influenced his work in both of the aforementioned works. But hearing it from Orwell's own words, his description of the Barcelona May Days and the reaction to it in the international press, of the Communist Party led suppression of the POUM in Catalonia, etc... All made the book very insightful. If you've read 1984 and/or Animal Farm, this is a must read to completely understand those books.
B0000T70K4|3.0|This book is about a financial tycoon who has it all - the 89 story apartment, the limo with marble flooring, the swarm of personal assistants - yet something is deeply lacking in this life. He flits from one appointment to another, observing his life with detached cynicism and boredom. When he decides to go for a haircut, his life takes an unexpected turn...    De Lillo is a great wordsmith. The writing is slick and delicious, sprinkled with sarcastic one-liners - \\"high school was the one true challenge\\" and \\"talent is more erotic when it's wasted\\" - reminiscent of Bret Easton Ellis' [[ASIN:B0006Q1UJI Glamorama]]. However, where this book falls flat is the characterization. Eric Packer, the protagonist, is an experimental character with which the author explores themes of detachment and self-destruction. Packer lacks all emotional involvement in his own wellbeing - when faced with the loss of his fortune or a threat to his life, he merely stifles as yawn, so to speak. This is what ultimately disengages the reader.     In the end, Cosmopolis is an entertaining though not altogether satisfying read. If you enjoyed De Lillo's style, you might want to give Bret Easton Ellis ([[ASIN:067978148X The Rules of Attraction]]) and Chuck Palahniuk ([[ASIN:0393319296 Invisible Monsters]]) a try.

B000001EL7|3.0|It's hard to believe almost thirty years has passed since \\"Love Gun\\" was released. Thirty years! This is when Kiss was at its pinnacle of popularity. They'd come close, but never again would they scale the heights of success they had achieved at this point.<br /><br />This has never been one of my favorite Kiss CDs, although it is notable for two reasons. First, it was Ace Frehley's lead vocal debut (\\"Shock Me\\"), and the last album in which the four members directly participated. And it was when Kiss was arguably at the peak of their popularity.<br /><br />There are some true gems here (\\"Christeen Sixteen,\\" \\"Plaster Caster,\\" and \\"I Stole Your Love\\"), but the dull and insipid stuff tends to dominate (\\"And Then She Kissed Me\\"?). I even found the song \\"Love Gun\\" to be a bit of a drag. And being eight years-old at he time of it's release, Paul Stanley's subtlety wasn't lost on me.<br /><br />So what did I find to be the problem with this album? It seemed like filler to me. And from what I've read, the band had burned out to the point where tensions ran high between members, and they almost called it quits. If not for the solo album idea, this might have been their last album.<br /><br />\\"Christeen Sixteeen\\" is one of my all time Kiss favorites. And while the lyrics to \\"Plaster Caster\\" are definitely goofy, the sound still sounds damn good after all these years! \\"I Stole Your Love\\" is not one of their better songs, but in relation to the other songs on the album, it's pretty good. I agree with a previous reviewer in that the live version is much better.<br /><br />Has age dulled my love for this album? Perhaps. It definitely was a step backwards form its predecessors -- \\"Destroyer\\" and \\"Rock and Roll Over.\\" It just sounds lazy. \\"Tomorrow and Tonight\\" is second rate at best, while \\"And Then She Kissed Me\\" seems odd and out of place. It's the Kiss brand name that saves this album. Had another band released this, it probably would have been forgotten.<br /><br />Looking for a place to start with Kiss? This wouldn't be the right album to begin your journey. I'd recommend \\"Destroyer\\" or \\"Rock and Roll Over.\\" Better yet, one of the countless greatest hits collections to give you a well rounded picture. But as far as individual albums go -- this one doens't rank very high with me.br />Looking for a place to start with Kiss? This wouldn't be the right album to begin your journey.

B00005RYKU|2.0|What begins as an intriguing thriller quickly turns into a major disappointment. The teen heroine is intelligent and quick-witted, but held back by an inept script that never has her do the obvious: call her uncle, call the police, tell more trustworthy adults. Throw in a completely unbelievable and improbable ending - the final 15 minutes utterly laughable - and, voila! You have wasted two hours of your life.<br /><br />Can't recommend this one.
B00005JM0B|4.0|OK OK OK, with James Cameron, Linda Hamilton AND Eddie Furlong missing along with a 99 year old Arnold Schwarzenegger, there was no way this movie was going to live up to T1 or T2.  I was disappointed when I first saw T3 in the theatres.  It definitely lacks the heart of the first two.  But still, I added the DVD to my collection to complete the trilogy.  I've watched this movie several times over the years, and I can honestly say it's a pretty decent if not good entry to the series.  <br /> <br />This movie follows John Connor as a young adult with the impending Judgement Day just hours away.  The acting, action and effects are above average.  Arnold gives one of his better performances in the last 10 years.  Claire Danes delivers as always.  Some people here complain that the actor who plays John Connor was too wimpy....C'MON John Connor was a regular guy who didn't want to accept his destiny, he wasn't supposed to be Rambo.  <br /> <br />The movie actually manages to hold the continuity of the first two.  The audience gets to see how the machines come to power and we even see images of the original terminators (versions earlier than Arnold's from the first movie).  I give the movie an extra star just for having the guts to end the way it does.  I'd even be looking forward to seeing Part 4 just to see how the story continues. <br /> <br />Like I said, Rise of the Machines doesn't really compare to the first two, but I'd take T3 over Godfather III, Scream 3 or the third Matrix any day.
B000EJ9MTW|5.0|It's amazing how important classic rock 'n' roll renaissance and revival is becoming. Wolfmother's debut has been one of Amazon's best-selling items for quite some time now. Like others, yes, this is a recent CD, but, it's also the rock album that plays to the rhythm of a different drummer (no music pun intended). What I mean to say is, (and you've probably heard this a million times), Wolfmother sounds a lot like Zeppelin, Sabbath, and a dose of Purple. Of course, this album has something for everybody, almost track for track. \\"Dimension\\" is a mystical rocker that opens up with a shout from Andrew Stockdale. \\"White Unicorn\\" is a five-minute song that has an epic, progressive buildup. \\"Woman\\", the song that made me buy this CD, is a loud-as-ever, monster-riffed, drum-pounding headbanger anthem with a nice solo on the keys. \\"Apple Tree\\" is, as countless other reviewers have mentioned, somewhat White Stripes-esque, but the track is just a bit underrated. Give it a listen and decide for yourself. \\"Pyramid\\" has a big, rollicking bassline and a similar guitar riff. \\"Witchcraft\\" is slightly blues-based and a somewhat shorter track. \\"Love Train\\" is a funk-based, even soul-oriented song that's just great fun to listen to, and probably a delight at parties. The lyrics in \\"Vagabond\\" seem to be something like the lyrics of a Led Zep love song. <br />So, don't be too doubtful when buying this, and don't listen to the negative reviews. Actually, people, let's get a larger amount of positive reviews here! I know, as well as we here all do, that they may seem too obvious when revealing their influences, their lyrics may not make as much sense to one as it may another, and they may not seem so original, but, it's all based on what you believe. Hey, when Black Sabbath released, \\"Paranoid\\", the critics hated them. And Led Zeppelin and Deep Purple may only be remembered for one or two songs (for Led Zeppelin: Stairway to Heaven, of course, well, basically anything from Zoso, for DeepPurple: Smoke on the Water, from \\"Machine Head\\"). <br />All I'm saying is: I was quite doubtful while buying this, but this album takes me somewhere otherworldly when I listen to it. And the first time, well...it was, to quote the title of one of their songs, a \\"Colossal\\" experience. But, to stop my beating around the bush, all I tell you is to give this album a chance. I did, and I can honestly say I'm very happy I did so. <br /> <br />Hopefully, in 30 years, this will be considered a 21st century \\"Machine Head\\".

B0001AP12G|5.0|\\"The College Dropout\\" by Kanye West is an excellent hip-hop album.  With solid beats, and on-point lyrics that manage to cover different and often contradictory topics without undermining each other, he manages to create an album that is diverse, thoughtful and human in a way that very few have ever managed.  One second he is on the usual hip-hop topics (bling, violence, etc.) the next he is bringing to life the problems of the \\"single black female addicted to retail\\", as in \\"All Falls Down\\".   <br /> <br />Song by song, this album contains so many triumphs that it would be pointless to name them all, with the best of them being \\"Jesus Walks\\".  This is the epitome of his ability to blend social commentary in with good music. The track has an almost gospel feel to it, with on point lyrics that critisize the public's attitude to religion (\\"They say you can rap about anything except for Jesus, that means guns, sex, lies, videotape, but if I talk about God, my record won't get played, huh?\\").   <br /> <br />Kanye displays his versatility on \\"Breathe in, Breathe Out\\", which features, fittingly enough Ludacris.  It is a sign of Kanye's genious that he would choose Ludacris on a song whose topics are exactly what Luda raps about (women, partying, etc.) His anti-education message is helped by skits, such as the \\"Lil Jimmy\\" skit, which details the story of a boy whose father left him nothing but a college degree.  Songs such as \\"We Don't Care\\", and \\"School Spirit\\" also contribute to his case against education.   <br /> <br />The only song I would give below a four out of five is the weak \\"New Workout Plan\\".  Despite the creative, synthisized pop beat, the track carries on way to long at over 5 minutes. However, the best songs, such as the verbally explosive \\"All Falls Down\\" the R&B based Slow Jamz, which sports an excellent verse by fellow Chicago rapper Twista, the poignant \\"Spaceship\\", again featuring fellow Chi-towners GLC and Consequence, and the solid \\"Two Words\\" featuring Philidelphia's Freeway,Mos Def, and excellent vocals from the Harlem Boys choir more than make up for the one misstep.   <br /> <br />All in all, I defintely think that this could end up being the album to remember for the years 2000-2005, along with Speakerboxx/The Love Below by Outkast. <br /> <br />Top 5 <br /> <br />1. Jesus Walks <br />2. All Falls Down feat. Syleena Johnson <br />3. Slow Jamz feat. Twista and Jamie Foxx <br />4. Spaceship feat. Consequence and GLC <br />5. Two Words feat. Freeway, Mos Def, and the Harlem Boys Choir
076531178X|5.0|Brandon Sanderson has done it again. I couldn't put the book down. Now, realize that this book is not something that has the scenery descriptions of a Tolkein or Robert Jordan. However, the story has the catching power of a Harry Potter for me. I did not want to put this book down. Whereas I did read this book from the library, it is probably the first book I shall ever read at the library and then go out and actually buy. Please, buy the book or at least read it. You, too, shall realize that this author has quite a lot to offer!

B00000K31Q|4.0|Of all the recent teen romantic comedies, I think this one is my favorite.  \\"10 Things\\" is (losely) based on Shakespeare's \\"The Taming of the Shrew.\\"  The movie is about Kat (the Shrew) who is a anti social outsider.  Unfortunately her younger and more popular sister Bianca cannot date until Kat starts dating.  Various suitors of Bianca's conspire to free her by hiring the school bad boy Patrick to date Kat.    I love the fact that both the lead characters are somewhat outsiders in high school, rather than following usual story arc for a teen romance where at least one of the leads is part of the \\"in crowd.\\"  The character of Kat is also very refreshing.  She is a strong willed and feminist, but remains sexy and human rather than a Hollywood sterotype.       I also loved the setting of the movie in Seattle, Washington.  What a departure from the vast majority of teen movies which usually take place in California!  I especially like the school where the film was shot, which is a real High School in Tacoma.  Compared to where I went to high school, the school in this film is absolutely sureal and it definately gives a certain feeling of fantasy to the movie.    Heath Ledger and Julia Stiles are perfect as the leads.  Both were very young when this movie was filmed, but you could tell then they had talent and would go far.  Julia Stiles really impresses with her ability to be sexy, strong and even vulnerable all at the same time.  The supporting cast is also excellent.  Larisa Olenik gives a great performance as the beautiful and naive Bianca.  Joseph Gordon-Levitt plays Cameron, the boy who will do anything for Bianca. I also liked Andrew Keegan as the vain and vapid Joey who also is after Bianca, but for less than honorable reasons.    The movie does have some cliche's of the teen comedy genre, but the story is surprisingly clever and engaging, the characters are charming, and the setting in Seattle is fantastic and fresh.  I highly recommend \\"10 Things I Hate AboutYou.\\"
B0002F6BRE|5.0|This movie is a suprisingly funny tale of Buddy, a human baby that accidently got into santa's bag at the orphanage, and ended up at the north pole.  Santa had a softspot for babies, so Buddy (named after his diaper brand)  was given to an Elf (bob newhart) to raise.  Well, as buddy grew up, he was noticably different. After a series of disasterous attempted jobs at the north pole, the secret leaked out that buddy was a human.  So papa elf share with buddy the secret of his origin. It was at that point Buddy decided to go on a mission in search of his human father (mother unfortunately passed away), played by james caan.  We then follow Buddy to new york city at christmas time, in search of his day. Well from here, the story takes of, the adaptation of an Elf in the human world, let alone at christmas time.  Let's just say he was suprised at \\"SANTA\\" when he showed up at the department store.  The movie is funny, and fresh, with moments of drama and sadness, but overall wrapped in a happy, funny story that ends well for all.  A great holiday movie, check it out.
B0001ZX0OW|1.0|What is it with violent (pervertedly, randomly, and disgustingly violent) shows that have a modicum of emotional/relationship issues?  Do they get a free pass of some kind?  Do critics not know what to do with them?  Not to be too simplistic but do people's minds turn to mush when presented with a film marketer's \\"mystical holy grail\\" of combining boy's likes with girl's likes.  Violence with relatioship issues.   <br /> <br />This show was terrible.  (And all apoligies to those who liked this show but they all probably like a History of Violence as well....an even more atrociously terrible show). And I am someone who doesn't mind violent shows if they are good.    <br /> <br />Bad, bad acting.  Ridiculously dull dialogue.  And a plot that made me want to vomit.  And I didn't even bother to finish the show--but after reading the ending from other reviewers I now not only feel justified in my views, but emboldened enough to write this review.    <br /> <br />
B0006GAXAA|5.0|always have been&always will be a Huge fan of the Jacksons.the Jackson 5 songs are timeless. from I want you back through Sugar Daddy.  Michael Jackson as a Kid was already a Legend,but as a Adult he became the King of Pop&Still leading his Brothers.  \\"Heartbreak Hotel\\" still sounds as Cold now as it did back in the day. when MJ wants to wail&Bring it he is unstoppable.the same vibe is felt on \\"Show you the way to go\\".  the Jacksons Harmony was smooth.this is a Must have collection&this captures some of the Most important Music ever created.
6305181810|4.0|I love John Grisham books, and though I've not read the Rainmaker, I do thoroughly enjoy this movie.  It's a David and Goliath story about an underprivileged family and a greener than grass lawyer taking on the mega-insurance company.  (And believe it or not, I work for an insurance company!)  The storyline is great....Matt Damon and Danny Devito compliment each other well in this film.  The subplot of Rudy's love interest is a bit more than the movie really needs...I'd be interested to see if that portion exists or how it plays out in the book.  Overall though, if you're looking for a nice solid movie, I'd recommend this one!
B000EQ4G5K|5.0|When I started to listen to this Cd, I could not stop. Her songs are very heart touching. I can not stop listening to that cd.
B000EGDC14|4.0|Wow...what a voice!! So melodic and haunting almost...the first time I heard Goldfrapp I was visiting my brother in Austin and he was playing one of the songs in the car.  I was instantly hooked and had to get the cd right away.  I was not disappointed at all...with other cds I skip a song or two but not with this cd...all the songs are worth listening to.  My favorite songs on the cd are satin chic, koko, and fly me away.  I highly recommend it.
6305882592|3.0|I saw this movie when it first hit the movie theatres in the early 70's.  Some friends of mine mentioned the movie to me and I am surprised that VH1 had played it on the television. <br />Ruth Gordon is excellent in the part of Maude. <br />It is a morose film, but because of the times when it was written and released, it is appropriate. <br />It was great to see the old Bay area Landscape which today is nearly a cement jungle. <br />Any teen who is struggling with parental control issues may relate to this movie.  I did way back when. <br />Not a bad flick.
B000A59PMO|5.0|I didn't actually buy this for myself - it was bought as a present for my friend in another state - but I like the show.
B000BTJDGC|4.0|I figured that this movie would just be a lot of hoopla and special effects. But no....it was fantastic! Great writing and an excellent cast make this not just a thriller, but also a court room drama. I highly recommend this movie. The more you see it, the more new things you find throughout this wonderful film.
B000FBGBPC|4.0|With their second release, Three Days Grace prove that they will be a force to be reckoned with on the charts for some time. They are really a band for the masses, combining a harder alternative metal sound with memorable riffs and hooks, appealing to fans of harder rock as well as listeners who may be turned off by other metal bands. Adam Gontier's vocal is amazing here as usual, strident but always maintaining clarity. The production is polished, and there are at least five or six radio-ready tracks. <br /> <br />There really aren't any bad tracks here. A few I thought were merely average (\\"It's All Over\\", \\"Time Of Dying\\", \\"Gone Forever\\"), but these are balanced by the very good tracks (\\"Animal I Have Become\\", \\"Never Too Late\\", \\"Let It Die\\", \\"Over And Over\\"). <br /> <br />None of this album would really be considered ground-breaking or innovative. However, that doesn't mean it is not an enjoyable listen for just about any rock fan.
B000087F6M|4.0|I remember watching this movie on cable and on T.V., I was too broke to go to the movies back then and I was only thirteen at the time so on a personal level it takes me back to a nice time,plus that ROD STEWART SONG \\" LOVE TOUCH \\" plays on my head especially the previews when DEBRA WINGER and ROBERT REDFORD plunge into a lake on a forklift or something like it..ITs like \\"WHO's JOHNNY\\" and \\"SHORT CIRCUIT \\" . You hear one and think of the other.
B000B0QOJA|5.0|the sessions at the half note present the classic coltrane quartet at the height of its powers. this version of afro blue rivals the cut on \\"live at birdland.\\"
B000AMJG4Y|5.0|I love this movie, but I'd have to say you should play the game first, but the graphics are astonishing, I think they could have done a better job with the english dubbing though, but asides from that, it's a fantastic movie
B000GTJT16|4.0|This is not one of my favorite movies, but it is an interesting adaptation of Washington Irving's classic story.  I'm a Depp fan and he doesn't disappoint in this one either with his quirky/creepy demeanor. <br /> <br />The picture quality is good and the sound is improved as well.  But in my opinion dark movies like this do not exhibit the breathtaking picture quality of brighter scenes in HD.  The picture is a bit grainy at times (not sure if this was the way it was originally filmed).  This is a movie definitely worth renting, but I'm not so sure about buying.
B000002G6J|5.0|I feel like a Brazilian playboy with millions everytime I play this CD. I can't explain it. These are so smooth and sophisticated arrangements by Jobin, they are especially good on hot, sultry afternoons. If you like Brazilian tempos with lush arrangements, this is your cup of cappucino. The only knock is that the CD comes in around 30 mintes. In the words of the Andrea True Connection when she asked \\"how do you like it?\\" ..I say \\"More..More...More..\\" This is excellent late 60's playboy lounge music. Yes, I'll have a cocktail...shaken, not stirred.
B000E1ZBGS|3.0|Nothing compares with the BBC version.  Knightley's acting is medicore.
