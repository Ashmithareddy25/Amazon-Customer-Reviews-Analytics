B000VSAEYI|5.0|We bought this for our 3 1/2 year old and our 18 month old. It has been a huge success. They love it. Also we have not had any trouble with our slide. Both children use the slide and it does not collapse. The slide is short, though, so our 3 1/2 year olds feet almost touch the bottom. He mainly uses it for sliding toys down or for sliding down backwards. Due to its size the two kids each have space to lay down and play. Also due to its size, it has numerous air compartments. They take awhile to blow up. This means, you won't want to deflate this pool after each use. So, you need to have space to store it. We have a corner of our garage where we keep it folded in half when not in use. At the end of the summer, we will deflate it. The ring toss thing is a waste, but the blow up whale and turtle are fun.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|This game is great. It's a very good game for people of all ages. I really enjoyed it and hope that the developer continues to make more games.
B00A8KJK7G|4.0|The movie is in black and white, which is something different. I think it adds to the visual effect of the lightning and the moon. Then I got tired of looking at black and white after the movie goes on. There were spots in the movie that drug on. Over all it was a cute story about a boy and his dog. The part of the science fair competition seemed to be slapped on. The main character Victor had little interest in the science fair after his dog issues were temporarily resolved. It seemed like Tim Burton needed a mortgage payment and stretched out a cute little film short to an entire movie. Because no one has ever seen Pet Cemetery or Frankenstein before.  Anyone with the  Nightmare Before Christmas on DVD has this as a short film. It just felt like a rerun.
B009NNMB70|5.0|Being a huge directioner, I just had to drag my best friend who hates them out to see this with me and even she admitted that she liked it, which is saying a lot. This movie is everything a directioner could want and then some. I used to like Justin Bieber before he ruined his life and when the Never Say Never movie came out I loved it, but that's nothing in comparison to this. This movie was extremely enjoyable to me and I can't wait to buy the DVD.
B0002TJGQS|1.0|none of the five batteries were able to properly activate my calculator, each time one of the LCD number was unreadable
B004UID2LC|5.0|I don't know what all these negative reports come from but I download all the full length  movies and shows with ease.  Occasionally it closes down but it's because I have a ton of apps open at the same time. Get it and stop complaining...it's Free!
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|I was riveted from the first chapter. An awesome book that I'm still thinking about several days after finishing it.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Love it!  Love it! Hubby &amp; I fight over the Kindle now we have this app. We think it is perfect.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Keeps my grandsons busy and entertained. Easy for them to learn and get high scores. Glad it was FREE!!! Wow
B0036BK6MW|4.0|GREAT MOVIE - THIS YOUNG MAN'S LIFE WAS TRULY SAVED BY THIS WONDERFUL, GENEROUS WOMAN AND HER FAMILY.  IMAGINE IF SHE HADN'T DONE WHAT SHE DID.....
B009Y6UCRC|4.0|The combination of Beth and Joe was out of sight. Hopefully Beth will show up in the New York area so I can check out her live sound.
B008602KQI|5.0|Great movie, have watched it many times and can't wait for the next one to come out. Wish there were more new movies available free.
B008FRFN7A|5.0|This app is definitely a must with any wireless HP printer. It works great on all of our phones and my kindle. I would recommend getting this app if you have a wireless e-print capable HP printer.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Used from my laptop and phone. Has all the reminders. Just wish the font on the main page was larger.
1582406723|5.0|Best comic out on the market! I would highly recommend reading this series of comics! Amazon is a great place to start--affordable!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|My friend told me to read it, so I did. Addicted to the story. The author isn't the best at writing, but the storyline and images it puts in your head help you to overlook that!
B00A757EFW|4.0|i use to play pack-man as a kid and even entered contest but the contest were not for me as i could play till i flipper the score and they would always stop me even when i never lost a life use to piss me off so now i cam play it when i want  but have not played it a lot right now
B008NF45S2|4.0|Very easy to set up. Works except for my e-mail. I liked the idea of being able to print from my Kindle but wished I could have gotten an e-mail printed. It might have been a problem with my printer at the time though.
B004RJMUJO|5.0|Love the game on kindle HD. Was a very smart purchase. Should have got it the first day!!! Play it everyday!!
B005GSZZ1A|5.0|A difficult story to tell, a very brave Shin, cruelty beyond understanding. A must read, must share, must act book.
1451626096|3.0|If you know any Tudor history, you will find this book boring.  I wish that I had not purchased it.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|my kids play it all the time and when the other games glitch they go back to this one  i like it also
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|The show pics up with bigger problems and Mike coming into his own trying to solve them. Mike and Harvey grow closer and the banter among all the characters is enjoyable.
B009VSW15Y|2.0|This camera only takes pics one way. I have to pay for another product to take pics the other way. However the pics are top quality.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Really enjoyed all three books the first one was really shocking. After the initial shock., I could not put the book down
B004J64QSI|5.0|Alfie Boe has got to be the best performer doing the show. The entire cast hands down beats the movie version with Hugh Jackman.<br />A must buy & keeper for years to come.
B005HSL626|5.0|I like to get away from what I am doing and this game is great for that i just want to win all of the challenges and get all the swag
B00E8G5HDW|5.0|This season was the best Clone Wars in terms of writing and special effects.  I too had heard that the show was cancelled.  I went to the Lucasfilm website and it appears they are the ones pulling the show. Disney also does not want the show to continue.  But Lucasfilm Animation are going to do story arc presentations for the show to put the final touches on the series, so its not over yet.  But let's look at real life for just a minute.  Lucasfilm was bought in 2012 by Disney.  From purely a business perspective I would think Disney would not want a rival network (Cartoon Network) making money from a property that it owns now.  However strongly we feel about it, Disney's decision, as well as Lucasfilm's decision not to go forward with the show tells the world they are in agreement that the show has seen its day.  Cartoon Network may even be thinking along these lines as well and is allowing the ties with the show to be cut.  Cartoon Network is not fighting to keep it.  But thanks to the supervising director Dave Filoni we will get to see the true finale for this show.  Keep your fingers crossed!
B004SD5GZ4|3.0|Don't like the way it keeps files. I download ebooks Adobe and can't bookmark or tab. Has a few links and I haven't got the time to play with the program. Kinda frustrated.
B0067Q42BY|4.0|its a great game..I'm already addicted and have been playing all night. I def suggest u get this. even my children love it
B009NQZVKG|2.0|The characters use personal feelings and the government to do things that are just a little too unreal for a government agency.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|fantastic book.  Really enjoyed reading it and can't wait for his next.  He has a way of  painting with words that is refreshing and imaginative.
B0029LCJJS|5.0|Very entertaining, historically accurate for the most part, people will love it as much for the drama as the history
B00E97AZZK|5.0|I loved this movie.  The acting was top notch, the plot kept me on edge and I didn't guess the ending at all.  It's not my usual sort of film but I can honestly say I will be watching it again.
B0058VW36U|5.0|I also had fun playing this game, My grandson also really loves it and he has a hard time deciding which game to play.
B00DMM3WVM|4.0|Into the Dead reminds me of a non-stop Ramiro-esqe zombie romp right from the get-go. Love the action & the gritty stylized graphics of this game.
B00992CF6W|4.0|my daughter loves this game... I dont' know a lot about it but she plays it a lot so I thinks it's worth the buy.
B008Y729FU|4.0|Looks scary but makes you feel good about justice and life. Can't believe it took years to watch it again
B004UJTG6Q|4.0|I read this book when I was about fourteen years old. It painted my imagination and filled me with anticipation as to what Tom was going to do next. Now, after almost forty years, it still intrigues me. I found it hard to put down. Reading it now brought back memories of some of the best days of my life, when things were simple and almost predictable.
B00E5Q1HJS|5.0|This is an excellent addition to the Star Trek mythos.  The movie is fun, entertaining, unique in a lot of ways, funny, and endearing.  The acting is perfect.  The villain is scary good at what he does.  The visual effects are incredible.  And the addition of so many new aliens throughout society is a fascinating aspect of this film.  Sort of like Star Wars, you have this living breathing universe in which aliens are out and about and it's no big deal.  So cool.<br /><br />The characters are true to their original conceptions in so many ways.  I like that.  It is respectful of the source material, and some might say even upgrades it!  From the soundtrack to the actors' bringing our beloved Star Trek characters to life again, you cannot go wrong here.  It is the kind of movie that makes you wish it had gone on another hour or so.  Buy it.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|I enjoyed the book very much and now I'm looking forward to getting some sleep. :)<br />For my wife's benefit, I won't buy Shift or Dust until next week. :)
B0031KC8OC|5.0|I love &#34;Veronica Mars&#34;! She is a smart wonderful resourceful girl character! If I was younger I would want to be just like her!
B00ESY7QXI|1.0|I couldn't figure this out.  Is it a cartoon?  How did hip hop music end up in the twenties?  Other than the title and the characters' names, how does this relate to the novel?  Fortunately, I only wasted $3.99 (it could have been more on Comcast!).
B00942Y4IY|5.0|This movie is old, watched it many years ago and again last week. I'm pleased to report it is still a great movie! Some sci fi movie get outdated pretty easily but I don't this movie has this issue. This is a classic!
B00EB6F1TY|5.0|This film is action packed.  The action scenes are incredible.  Even more incredible when you learn how they filmed some of them!  I won't ruin the extras.  But this film is a very humanizing, humbling, self-effacing portrait of Tony Stark in the midst of troubles he is outmatched by.  When the suit is gone, Tony is a charming James Bond type with American flair--but he is just a human.  Up against some enemies that will freak you out.  In fact, I'd say the enemies in this film are way more frightening than the aliens he faced in Avengers.<br /><br />The movie constantly puts Tony Stark in horrible situations, in over his head with evil.  Pepper plays a fantatic part in this film.  So does Rhodey (War Machine).  Jarvis is one of the best characters, as always.  Happy too.  Everybody gets a chance to shine in this film.  Especially the SUITS!!!!  That's all I'll say on that, but you are going to LOVE Tony's new creations.  Really cool.<br /><br />Buy it.  It is honestly as good or better than The Avengers.
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|My nephew liked it. I for my part didn't . So I removed it. Too babyish. I should have looked at it more carefully before I pick it.
B003Q6D2B4|5.0|This movie achieves what many do not by hitting the proper balance of humor romance and action. This is a movie you will watch over and over and never feel wanting and the end of it. I've seen it five times already.
B0030B621W|4.0|Have you ever bought the store or generic version of a name brand product? Usually this process ends with you telling yourself, \\"Oh, that's why I buy the name brand. The knock-off sucks!\\" However, sometimes you stumble upon a generic version that's as good as or even better than the more-accepted brand. Good news! This picture is better!!<br /><br />At first, this movie seems strikingly analogous to the Sci-Fi Classic, 2001: A Space Odyssey. Both pictures share a lunar connection, although this one (Moon) takes place entirely on...well...the moon. The eerie, melancholic voice of an AI (Artificial Intelligence) seems to be the only break in what can almost be described as a maddening tranquility. Yet, GERTY is very different from HAL 9000; the sine qua non lies in its programming, and in its unique relationship(s) to Sam Bell (Sam Rockwell).<br /><br />Aside from lunar scenery and computer sentience, this cinematic wonder offers up some unique perspectives on death and dying, friendships and family, Jungian Archetypes (with the grand conclusion of the Individuation process - e.g., the making of the model town), and even Dissociative Identity Disorder (multiple personality disorder). And, all of that fits comfortably within the realm of cloning and psychosomatic auditory and visual hallucinations.<br /><br />I guess what I'm saying is that this movie rocks. It might be a bit too slow for the average moviegoer, but the serious watcher will surely enjoy it. And, yes, I'm serious... and don't call me Shirley.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|This app is easy to set and use. I like the fact that the alarm will be with me at all times because of my Kindle. My kindle must be on the charger all night because it cannot sleep and awaken to execute the set alarm. The distance to a plug in traveling is sometimes a problem. If you want an alarm clock and don't mind leaving your devise plugged in all night this app might work for you.
B000E0W24S|4.0|Replaced by original DG set with this after the CD started flaking.  I detect only a marginal improvement in sound, and not all of it is great, I think the digital processing has taken that final ounce of warmth aware from the sound and produced a slight glare.  Its not unlistenable but any means but it is less than what it was.<br /><br />In terms of alternative options it would be much better to invest in the Erato set.  Sure that is from the autumn of Mravinsky's career but the performances gain with his age and lose little vigour.  Sounds is MUCH better.  You miss the Fourth which he didnt record for Erato but perhaps like me you see the 5th and 6th and much more substantial pieces and they are both in the Erato set.
B000GCFY0I|2.0|My daughter didn't like the beginning of the books. She said she wasn't interested just from reading one page of chapter one.
B005LAII44|3.0|If you NEED to kill time its a usable movie. They shouldnt have killed an important character and replaced him with The Rock. Dwayne should have stayed home for this one.
0446580848|4.0|DeMille is a great writer, and a fellow Vietnam Vet...  I've read just about every book he has written.  The Panther is very prophetic in light of the recent events in the area!  But this wasn't his best effort, but then his worst books are still good, and this is better than that.
B004GUSG4M|5.0|What a intriguing read. Had a hard time putting the book down. I would definitely recommend this book. Very well written, wasn't expecting the ending.
B005LAIIN0|5.0|I have the audio book, but just watched this movie. I went into it not expecting anything.  BluRay, 5.1, plasma.  Don't watch these things on your boobtube with two speakers.  WOW..  highly intense.
B000T45C32|4.0|I like this movie. My daughter had an assignment from school and that is why we saw it. I really love it. It keep you alert to what come next in the movie.
B005LAIIPS|3.0|while this was an entertaining but LONGWINDED movie, Matt Damon created this franchise and a BOURNE movie without him in it.....is demonstrous. The chase seen here was a yawn sequence compared to the other Bourne movies. I do give kudos to the main actor for a job well done, it wasnt up to Bourne quality for plot, action or chase scenes.
B009P5S11G|3.0|I was surprised to see that there are 3 songs that I am actually interested in to listen to but there are like 16 on the CD.... a lot of arrow forward pressing on this CD... such a great singer and voice too many Chris Turd Brown Odes too!! pathetic with that one... I LOVE THE MAN THAT BEAT MY ARSE!!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Best. Book. Ever.  I love John green! Even though all his books make me cry! Highly recommend this book! All of his books!
0307887448|5.0|An amazing novel. Well-written and paced for even those who are unfamiliar with the gaming world or 80s pop culture. Fascinating and interesting details and a novel approach to the possible future of MMORPGs.
B005544TRQ|4.0|I had not seen Suits and came across this series on Amazon.  It was a pleasant surprise.  The characters are likable and easy to watch.  The writing is sarcastic and witty and the actors are well suited for their roles.  Although the story line is not always realistic, the series is fun to watch.
B005LAIIJY|5.0|I love being able to view this movie within the comfort of my home, even when 'pausing' to take  break, or rewinding to review something that I may have missed. The subject matter and the outcome doesn't change, but the message seems more intimate viewing at home.
B00BCZU8WM|3.0|The songs you have heard on the radio are the ONLY songs you will listen to on this CD... just an fyi...
B00E5Q1LTY|1.0|This video seems to be purposely subjected to some type of detail softening procedure, probably to foil copy attempts.  Although they have the right to protect their product, this has nothing to do with me.  I know that I paid for the movie, and I should have received a first quality copy.  Am requesting refund.
B004XUMMFE|5.0|I introduced my wife to this series, and we both enjoyed it.  It is a real shame that they only made one season that ended early.
B008BQ8YHQ|4.0|Once again, the guys are back for Season 2 and they did not disappoint.  Extremely entertaining and fun to watch.  I look forward to Season 3!
B00BU18U82|5.0|It is just like real life.  Take my word' I am a real farmer and I've never seen and a game as good as this one.
B00BLSJI80|5.0|Love Demi, this CD is so amazing, love the songs. They are all so powerful and beautiful. I love how her voice sounds incredible. This CD has a song for everybody. Even if you don't like the genre.<br />I love Nightingale, her voice is so stunning here. This CD is worth the money. Give it a try.
B008C20TDG|5.0|An interesting book with lots of good gouge. If you are looking for a plan to kick-start your weight loss and start healing the damage your diet has caused, this is a good place to start your search!
B0063M22QO|5.0|This is a great game. Works great and keeps the interest. Tiles have intriguing designs and colors.  There was no problem installing and have had no issues in playing.
6305212112|5.0|Love this movie/Kathy Bates is wonderful in her role~ we can relate/ Oh the memories of 'going back home'. A must see movie
B006YB9VJU|4.0|These tags are pre defined to the Sony Xperia phone (The ZL in my case).  They will automatically change the phones configuration based on which take you scan.  You can completely control the configuration of the phone through the app built into the phone and designed to work with these tags.  Unfortunately, that is pretty much all you can do with these tags.  If you want to do other things or customize the tags you will need to look elsewhere.  At that they are a little expensive for what they are.<br /><br />Overall, they are great convenience for managing your phone based on location.
B00CU8OVIM|3.0|The CD has some real good hits if you can get pass the cursing.  I tried to look for a clean version, but this one will do.
B001GUXJQA|4.0|Excellent read with suspense and a turn you may guess before the end. Some surprises with the Harry Bosch character--maybe he won't be so alone in the next adventure.
B007LB5MF4|1.0|I just couldn't get into this. It was way too slow for me. I've seen the tv show, but I haven't read the books. That could be the reason why.
B00DUGCLY4|5.0|This app is the most perfect app for all ages .this app is so easy to do.I do it after my homework.
B00AZMFK3K|1.0|It's been revealed that if you want to get the special features for this movie, you will have to purchase several different copies from various retailers (e.g. Target, BestBuy). This is because Paramount decided to strip out the special features and make them all retailer exclusives, with different retailers getting different features. The general release just gets a couple of mini-episodes. You won't even get the director commentary here. You have to get the iTunes version for that.<br /><br />Don't support this gouging of the consumer. I had pre-ordered my copy and have cancelled it as a result of this nonsense.
B000Y0Q5NM|5.0|We love this series ! We can't wait to sit down and watch the next episode. This series is full action and drams. It invokes all the emotions. We're always wondering what  planet their next adventure will be on. It's so entertaining you will never be disappointed  when you watch this. Watch it you'll like it.
B009NX409M|5.0|I always enjoy seeing these two film actors work together with such ease and great chemistry! They were far better than the story line!
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|I enjoy playing Jewels Star very much.  I, can compete against myself, trying to get to the next level is fun. I do wish there were some instructions so that you find' t have learn as you go.
B00594XOZU|5.0|Just a normal muscular jock here with a good sized duck for any female who wants it in the Chicago area. If your not in the area we can trade. If not I'm up for a nice conversation:)<br />Kik: bbyblue44
B004GUSG4M|3.0|The over all story line was is good.  However, there was about 200 extra pages that were repetitive and slow.  Otherwise, a good read.
B00C1BU8G2|5.0|This Jurasic Park lll is not quite as good as the first 2 but is still a great movie to watch. It is filled with tons of scary stuff, drama, adventure, and even some funny stuff. There are times it has you sitting on the edge of your seat and times you want to close your eyes and grimace.. We loved all three of these movies. You won't regret watching this.
B00AG297GK|1.0|Trash! Not funny or fun. His first movie was fun and included many aspects of society that are debated. Trash!
B007N5YIUS|1.0|I absolutelylove angry birds but this one was not my favorite.  Need some new angry birds, I am rather addicted to them.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game was very addicting.  It's fun, challenging and makes you use your brain. I hope they make more rooms soon
B0067Q42BY|4.0|this is a pretty interesting and unique way to play some mahjong.  I'm glad it was promoted as that app of the day so I could try ti for no charge.
B00C1C0WCQ|5.0|This is not only awesome but it's the kind of movie that makes you hold onto your seat. It's very intense at times. then you have to wonder who will survive and who won't.  . Whew!  I was sweating at times.. There are some cool fun things that happen too. So as an overall it is a well rounded adventure movie. Definitely worth the watch.
B00E5Q1HJS|5.0|I remember the original Star Trek series, the original cast movies, the other TV series, etc.  This movie is an excellent addition to all it's predecessors.  I have to keep in mind that it's an alternate universe so I don't get confused about the different things that have happened, like the destruction of Vulcan.  My husband and I both enjoyed it very much and look forward to seeing it again.
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|It is very entertaining!  I may be 13 but this game is a great game!!!!! Very great game for all ages
B00DH1G7DS|3.0|This is a basic Sudoku game set to a summer theme.  It has easy, medium, hard difficulties and clocks your completion time taken.  It functioned flawlessly on my Kindle Fire and had adequate sound and visual effects.  It gets three stars for said features, but no more due to lack of creativity, originality and replay value.  I recommend this game to age 8+ fans of number puzzles.
B008JFUO4U|4.0|Special effects notwithstanding the story was wild and crazy. Enjoyable even for a Tom cruise movie. Not a big fan of his but this movie was on my list
B00CB4ET0K|5.0|This is a awesome app I totally love it. They should do a multiplayer thing or a co op thing too
B0047SKR54|5.0|Coppola may as well have been in SEA - good tale of good & evil. A good reminder of what absolute power will do to mankind.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This book was amazing, because of the story and emotions it made me feel. The seventh graders bullying him made me realize his face was the way it is.
B007AL48UK|4.0|This is your basic tile matching mahjong game set to a summer theme.  There are multiple different tile set ups, ranging from fish to boat.  It rates you 1-3 stars based on time to clear and offers a shuffle option at the cost of two minutes added to your time.  It functions flawlessly on my Kindle Fire, has good graphics and sound, accurate controls, decent options, and proper mechanics.  It lost a star due to having a low replay value once each set up is complete and for not including anything to truly set it apart from the many other mahjong games available on Amazon Market.  I recommend it for age 8+ fans of mahjong and other tile matching puzzle games.
B0018OFN4U|5.0|Tight story telling and a great riff on the classic zombie apocalypse story.  Good for a larf and love the 80's nostalgia soundtrack.
B00AECGQF2|5.0|If you want to remove your child from street, bad TV program, or let it be alone in good companion, the really best solution is to make a gift baying this game. I am 52, but I enjoy in it very long. It is very funny when you recognize your friend, or member of the family in your creation. I recommend it for everybody.
B004HWYTP4|5.0|I thought that it was a action filled movie and very entertaining. I would definitely recommend it for everyone to view
B00CDT41RY|5.0|Always enjoy a &#34;good&#34; old era movie. Just as good as Hell on Wheels. Deadwood, and another favorite Spartacus. Quentine should do a series.
B00632HWOG|3.0|I liked the old mail page much, much better.<br />Please bring back the old site for checking my mail.<br />Thank you
1892005034|5.0|Great book if you want to learn a process to recognize your and other's needs.<br /><br />There is also a 3 hour video out on you-tube that covers the same material, but the book is a handy reference for sure.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|It's the same thing as temple run but Minions! It's hard if you try to get Victor out of the lair but its still really cool and awesome! If you believe me please by this app. It's the awesome game in the whole world! If I  love it I know you will to. If you love the Minions go and buy this app. All of the Minions is in the app!
0143119680|5.0|This was a surprisingly good story, vampires for grown-ups. Just a pleasure to read. I give it an A+ !
B00E5Q1HJS|5.0|What can we say...we're Trekkies, dating back to the first episode of the first season on TV!  End of story. We loved it.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|Anyone who is interested in the supernatural would love this book. It has demons and angels and everything everybody likes that s why i gave it 5 stars
B008RA3X5E|1.0|I'd like it if I could figure out how to use it. I've pushed all the buttons to no avail.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|I like it it is cool so there is my review read it and like:) do you like my review ?
B000W967UQ|4.0|The Death line of novels is definitely my favorite in the discworld series. Mort is another in that fantastic line. Mort and Death's daughter are a great pairing.
034580709X|4.0|It was great to find out--finally--just what happened to Harry in Australia.  After hearing about it in some later books it was good to get the full story.  Also interesting to see how Harry was a gentler character here, before the demons really started doing a number on him.
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|This game is really cute- relaxing and fun. I think it is User friendly for kids yet fun enough for adults to enjoy as well! It is very easy to earn money in. If you like cute games you can play for hours or 10 to 20 minutes and still get something done... this game is it!!! &gt;';'&lt;
B00280LYIM|5.0|I love this series. I will purchase the final book. Great read ; enjoy this type of book. Very entertaining.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|this was one of the best books I have read in a long time  the characters grabbed you and never let go
B005LZW8FO|5.0|Brit Marling (writer / star) is one of the most gifted writers. This is a very compelling story and she has a great way of telling a great story. She's also a really good actress and pretty!<br /><br />I first saw this movie based on a preview where it was set up to be a Sci-Fi film: Earth 2 (as its called in the film) has been discovered, and what happens! Totally set up as a sci-fi movie.<br /><br />But it's not. It's a brilliant movie about life choices, and consequences of actions, and how we try to right past wrongs. The &#34;second Earth&#34; is part of the story line, but a very minor one.<br /><br />I was sure that Brit Marling would be nominated for Best Original Screenplay at the Oscars.
B0090P98Z4|5.0|This is a really good game. If you want a good game like dungeon hunt e r then thus is the game for you.
B000FBJF6Y|5.0|This book is an inspiring read about a confident woman to defies society's sexist standards. This novel is both interesting and exciting! I absolutely love this book.
B00BNPI7VU|5.0|All Simon's drawings are so true to life.  They're so simple buy hilarious because they actually happen in real life!
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|This book was fantastic!  I was stuck like glue and couldn't put it down.  Now I want to read more books by this author.  Wow.  This was a good one.
B000FC12C8|3.0|Too much of this revised edition was not written by Benjamin Graham.  Really I was only interested in reading Graham's words, even if they are dated.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|It's nice to have a show that is based on dialog more than action from time to time.  this is a good one that I enjoy.
0595440096|5.0|Informative, moving, sad. This author makes the story very real for those of us that have a relative with Alzheimer's.
B001CQONKY|5.0|Great show and gets better as it goes.  Arrived quickly and in great shape.  Must watch from the beginning. Amazing!
B000002KHH|4.0|It has been years since I last heard this album.  After all the time since release it does not sound too dated.  A classic metal album.
B00DAXYNEI|4.0|Stellar cast and Spacey is amazing. It started out so strong and then, unfortunately, got somewhat trite and expected. We also felt Spaceys character took a left turn that may have advanced the plot but it seemed way out of character to us. We will watch the second season but it went from being great to just another drama about 2/3 thru the season.
B00E5Q1HJS|5.0|It was great. A combination of old and new timeline. Floored me near the ending especially when I heard a certain name. Oh, my! If you are a Sci-fi fan this is a good one to watch.
030789701X|5.0|Bought this when my wife got me the game for my birthday, it is absolutely fantastic. So full of information and I love the online guide
B00DUGCLY4|4.0|I thing the game is cool and once you get into the harder levels it gets challenging but the game is good
B000TETD9Q|5.0|This album really is \\"The Very Best of the Beach Boys.\\" I heard the album at a party a few years ago and wanted it, but never got around to purchasing it until recently.  I know virtually all the songs and have it in my car's CD player.  I often listen to it as I'm driving in to work in the morning because it lifts me up and gets me in a positive mood.  Even though the subject matter for most of the songs is surfing, girls, cars, and of course, the beach, I don't care.  I'm a 56 year old female and remember many of these songs when they debuted on the radio in the mid 60's.  For the songs that first became popular in the early 60's, a bit before I was listening to pop/rock regularly on the radio, I know them too because The Beach Boy's music is such a integral part of American pop music history that many millions of Boomers, like me, can easily sing along when they hear the music because The Beach Boys' music has been and is played so much on the radio.  No other group has ever duplicated The Beach Boys sound.  The rhythms, arrangements and the close harmony are just top notch, plus the words are easily understandable, even if someone (from another planet) had never heard the music before. My biggest favs: I Can Hear Music,(...the sounds of the city baby, seem to disappear,) Do It Again, Help Me Rhonda, Sloop John B, Little Deuce Coupe, and the more reflective numbers: Don't Worry Baby, In My Room, God Only Knows.  Get this album, you won't regret it.
B00ECU34ZM|5.0|Not thrilled with either leading actor's politics, but the movie was awesome.  Visually stunning, good plot twists, and well acted.
B008HJGPVO|1.0|Tapping with this stylus is frustrating. My Kindle does not respond to its touch and I often have to use my finger. I am very disappointed. I have bought the three pack through Amazon, which was a lot cheaper, that have worked much better.
B00DHSK3RM|1.0|Title says it all.....don't waste your time or effort!<br />I don't have anything else to say but it is making me type.
B00D6BN9NK|2.0|After a great series entry with Live Free or DIe Hard, this movie is a major let down.  This is absolutely the worst movie in the series.  There is little character development and little fun.  Here's to hoping the upcoming Die Hardest recovers some of the glory of the series.
B00AFCEIB0|3.0|I use this a lot and it does get me to the information I am looking for but it seems a bit slow.
B00DP8XSQ2|1.0|Could  not get it to work. I didn't find it user friendly.  I'm not sure it was the program however. I was probably just me.
B0048PU7TC|5.0|Love EVERYTHING she does! I can't get enough of her stuff. She has such a marvelous voice. I never get tired of listening to her.
B00ECUARO8|4.0|McConaughey is getting better and better.  This is a very strong movie with a great dramatic performance from him. Enjoyable and not too heavy in tone.
B000O8OTNC|4.0|This won't give you razor quality edges, but it is great for keeping in your pack for touching up your blades while on the go.
B00AFQC4QC|5.0|As a World War 2 book junkie I can officially attest to the brilliant authenticity of The Luck of the Weissensteiners. Christoph Fischer's epic saga set in wartime Eastern Europe follows the lives of two families - one Jewish, one Catholic - and their entwined survival in war torn Czechoslovakia. A Jewish girl falls in love with a German boy over their mutual love of reading. Their romance is the foreground set against the disruptive horrors of war. It's a great read that should appeal to fans of World War 2 stories, romance and anyone looking to get lost in an absorbing story. Recommended.
B008PZZUTS|3.0|A little slow but not too bad. Robert DeNiro is always good. Not great but when there is nothing else to watch this is watchable.
B00DHKKN6Q|5.0|I loved this game after level one. It is amazing. The further I get in levels, the more I get excited and anxious to see what awaits.
B002DPRLEI|5.0|I love, love Rock Hudson and Doris Day.  Takes you back to a simpler time and place. Having Tony Randall is an added bonus.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|I enjoyed this book because it was a quick and easy read.  I would recommend this for someone looking for a quick read.
B00000IM2R|2.0|This is a review of the Sundazed reissue on vinyl LP... It is not at all critical of the content. This LP was scratched and smudged right out of the shrinkwrap. Yes, I cleaned it. But, the defects are IN the vinyl. The center hole was not punched properly and the label around the spindle was damaged. WTH?!? This is supposed to be audiophile vinyl.<br />The music itself is GREAT. But, New (and expensive) vinyl should NOT be this poorly QC'd and packaged. Based upon this, I will be wary of this label's reissue vinyl in the future.<br /><br />As for the content... It's Albert King at his best. And, is a pure joy to listen to. The mixing on this LP is very good IMO. The sound tech did a good job with what he had, which I assume was digital masters of the old analog. So, I 'think' this would be an Analog-&#62;Digital-&#62;Analog pressing. At least that what it sounds like.<br /><br />I only wish the label had taken more care in the manufacturing and QC processes. It is so disappointing to pay $25 for a reissue only to have it look pre-owned and scratchy.
B00CXVX1OQ|1.0|To repetitive of a game for me,  just not very fun,  maybe you have to like boxing to like this game.
B00DHSK3RM|4.0|This is an addicting game which is fun to play. Time flies by when playing this game.  I like it a lot.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Enjoyable &amp; Fun!  This game was at times a little challenging.  It's a nice game to get your kind off stuff.
B000FBJAOG|3.0|I was really looking forward to this book, and the basic idea is fun. But the author is repetitive and contradicts himself. In one place he says large apartment and office buildings can make great shelter. In many other places he says to avoid shelter and head for the country. So...which is it?<br /><br />If you're looking - like I was - for a good, mindless beach read, this fits the bill. But I think it would be twice as good if it was half as long.
B003M6EAXM|5.0|As with the other seasons in this wonderful action/drama (with the possible exception of season 1) season 8 does not disappoint and is full of its usual twists and turns, keeping you on the edge of your seat with each of the 24 episodes filmed in real time.<br /><br />A blast from the past comes in to &#34;help&#34; Madame President Taylor, and once you see who this individual is, you won't be surprised when you soon find out that the help offered comes with a price.<br /><br />Simply great entertainment.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|I enjoy this game very much. Challenging and fun! I have several friends playing it with me.  I keep trying to improve my abilities.
B00006AG5N|5.0|30 songs by the King. You can't go wrong with this CD. Wonderful to listen to. If you aren't an Elvis fan, you will be after hearing this.
B006GWO5NE|3.0|I'm not sure I can fairly rate this as my Kindle is still not charging properly or holding charge.  It's my device and still not making good connection.  I was hoping this one would, but it's not.
B00E5Q1HJS|5.0|Great story, great acting, great special effects, perfect writing. What's not to love? If you enjoyed the first one, you'll love this one.
B000HKYOK0|5.0|Been waiting a long time to watch these all! Can't wait to watch every season in order with no commercials
0394818237|5.0|I have purchased several Richard Scarry books for my son, and this is one of his favorites.  It walks the reader through Busytown and several different events taking place in the town: building a new home, making paper, sailing on a big ship, etc.  It is very thorough and exciting for little ears and eyes.  So many different things to see!
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|Took a while to understand what's going on but it soon becomes very addictive. Hours of play and puzzle solving.
B006TF6WAM|5.0|This was so engrossing based upon real events when a village in England decided to close its its borders and wait out the Plague, how the village reacts to the threat of dying without being able to control events. Who is supportive and who is destructive seen throuhg the eyes of a young mother.
B008XCM18Q|4.0|Truly a complex story that was hard to put down.  Action packed that places you in the mind of Bourne. I'm looking forward to finish the series
B004EPYZU8|5.0|Great movie IMO. Awesome graphics and lots of action. Emily Browning was great in this movie! I really enjoyed it!
B0060MYM3S|3.0|This season will probably irritate you. HBO took several liberities with it and added in stuff that isnt even in the books.
B00129JSMY|5.0|Yes, the case was a little banged up, but that's not an issue at all. The movie works perfectly. Thanks!
B00322PKBW|4.0|comfortable to wear and easy to read the time - matches everything! don't have to worry about forgetting to take it off in the shower or when jumping in the pool!! It's waterproof!
B000KZHQAM|2.0|I guess I should have read more closely.  I didn't realize this was a cartoon short film.  Interesting story, but certainly not what I was expecting.
B000JMKNJ2|5.0|Compelling story. Excellent setting. Loveable bastard characters. I haven't read a book this thoroughly enjoyable in a long time. Well worth it.
B007T7MIR0|3.0|had it before and tried to download the update but it wont install it. does anyone have the same problem?
B0067Q42BY|5.0|The graphics and play of this game is the best Majonng game to date. I wouldn't change a thing and there's nothing to fix! :-)
B00BRUQ7ZY|3.0|This book is amazing in its historical perspective and research.  The writing, however, could stand improvement.  And, honestly, as a college professor myself I was completely put off by a typo on - I kid you not - PAGE ONE.  For a book that received that much hype, it deserved considerably better editing.<br />However, well worth the read for its thought-provoking analysis of the sparse historical evidence.
B008HK3XOU|4.0|It protects the Kindle and provides a stand all in one. I would like a small pocket in it for a stylus, but other than that, it is fine-
B000SEGUDE|5.0|I was concerned how Cloud Atlas could be made into a movie. The directors did a fabulous job of tying scenes from the different stories together.
B006GWO5NE|1.0|This is what happens when you order too fast. I thought I was ordering another charger so there is nothing wrong with the product, it just isn't what I thought it was.  For the cost, I didn't take the time to send it back-my error. THanks
B009GED3HS|5.0|Though I was a late-comer to this show, this is one of the few long-running shows that has not diminished in quality whatsoever.  I am looking forward to the broadcast of the ninth and final season!
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|I LOVE Google! I never want to be without it. Every time I use it I marvel at what I learn.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Fun and time consuming game. Something fun to do to pass time. YOU WIOL WASTE TIME. lol I love escape games.
B00992CF6W|4.0|I love this game and it's defiantly a time passer, but it is $7 so it's your choice.  It really isn't for everybody.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Having grown up in a military family and remembering all that happened on 9/11 and beyond and I was interested in reading this book. Honestly my first interest peaked after I watched the movie seal team six. After watching the movie I wanted to know the accurate view of what happened and this book popped up.<br />From beginning to end it was a very engaging read. I would recommend this book to anyone. Side bonus that I did not know when I bought the book was that it included the raid on the pirates that captured a boat captain a few years ago.<br />In the end, I am thankful for those that serve our country and protect our freedom.
B00AEFXKOO|5.0|Damn good movie! True classic! Mel Gibson's best movie by far. Must have in the home movie collection. Seriously recommend!
159562015X|4.0|THESE TOOL ARE GOOD INPUT TO UNDERSTANDING WHAT YOU ARE ON YOUR WAY TO BECOMEING AND SHOULD BE USED TO BUILD UPON NATERAL TALANT .THE VALUE IS IN BUILDING UPON WHAT YOU HAVE AND NOT WASTEING TIME PREPAIRING FOR SOMETHING YOU MOST PROBLY WON'T BECOME OR EVEN LIKE. KNOWING WHO YOU ARE IS WHAT TOM RATH IS HELPING US WITH AND WILL BETTER EQUIP US TO MAKE LIFE DECISIONS AND TO LEARN CONTENTMENT ABOUT OR NATERAL TALANT
B007YJ8ZRK|3.0|A younger audience would probably like this better.  The ending was so so.  Will not recommend it to most of my friends.  I grew up with  comics and a character &#34;The Green Lantern&#34; got a similar gift and did not abuse it like in this movie.  Was for the most part a negative movie.
1892005034|5.0|Have not read this yet, but will soon.  My church has a class with the book and work book, and have heard it is a very good way to communicate with others.
0525953728|5.0|Awesome book... If you like a real story by the account of the seals who killed Osama, I recommend reading.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|Game of this type on a tablet. It's great for me and as I can pick it up or leave it as I want so I don't have to spend any real money.
B00881VLCE|5.0|I've only had this puzzle for a couple of days but I'm hooked. I enjoy the different pictures and scenes. Easy to catch on and like the difficulty levels.
B00B769XB8|4.0|I recommend this movie because it is different, well done and just fun.<br />Special effects are top quality, they put money into this venture
B00CPTUNBK|5.0|Everybody within the show's community has had fanfiction writings on the subject of Equestria's ponies being human and such.  However, this film helps put the worries of making the idea fall short to rest.  The team behind this film really put some thought on how that they wanted to make the human versions of the ponies unique while keeping true to who they are.  The musical numbers are great, especially the cafeteria musical number.  This is not your traditional pony movie...  However, if you look at the human versions of the Mane 6 in terms of their personality then you'll forget that they are even human.<br /><br />Also, be sure to stick around the credits as there is a special character that hangs out near the end of the credits.
B00AECGQF2|5.0|I have this app for my children and I have to have on on the Mac the iPod the iPhone and kindle it is so much even for me as an adult so get it while u can for free!!!
1401201911|5.0|If all the Superman stories are blending together in your comic book world, give Red Son a chance. The story is spun in a way to where Superman's ship crash lands in Russia where he fights for his homeland. His ideals are different, but he still has a similar moral code. It is extremely interesting to see our hero in this light, and the ending is incredible and unexpected. Give it a shot!
B007FQDPL8|5.0|This is a great series and amazon always has what I need when it comes to finding things that I want/need. Not all sites have the first season of certain shows and I received it before the date it said I would.
B000059PQ2|3.0|when i open the package, inferno was in' but not phenomena. I was like' wow this is really, really weird.
B008133MDK|5.0|Totally in love with this modern day version of Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes.  Cumberbatch strikes a great balance of Victorian and contemporary with a hint of sexy thrown in!
B00CEF014E|5.0|Recommended if you want a short sharp shock that you'll never forget. If you want bad dreams for a week (and counting...). My new best friend is Dana Barnes.  Come join the Solstice Fair at Rainbow!
B00AQL8VU4|4.0|I love the conveneince of apps, make it pretty easy to c your cart an place orders, without waiting on a browser to load and it portable, so thumbs up!
B008CYDD7I|5.0|this movie is off the chart. this one along with bride of re-animator are my 2 personal favorites. beyond re-animator was ok. but i prefer this one & bride of re-animator as the best.
B00CEZJT2E|4.0|Picked this up as a new accessory to my HTC One.  The one gets decent battery life, but not enough to get me through when traveling.  This battery is slim, portable, and good for 2.5 full phone charges.  Very convenient and high quality.  There were a few things missing that I would like to have seen, like a built-in USB cable so that no external cables would be required.  The micro-USB cable is nice for charging the phone, but a USB for plugging into a wall charger would be a nice touch and eliminate the need for all external cables. (My wife has another brand battery pack and hers has this feature.)  Additionally, hers came with a small felt carry pouch, which would be convenient as well.  Overall, this is a great product and my complaints are minor.
1608871819|4.0|I have always been a fan since the television series started in 1951, and continue to watch the episodes on dvd. This book is a continuation of the fantasy. C6
B002C949AE|5.0|My dearest friend, Kamia, introduced me to the video. She did not tell me what it was about - just to watch it and I did. After watching the video, I had to read the book. I almost fainted when reading about Waris's \\"procedure\\" (I don't want to be a spoiler) and its aftermath. This is definitely a MUST READ for every woman; however, let this be your first step, not your last, in learning about and fighting against another atrocity against women - \\"If God's willing!\\"
B003G4W49C|4.0|Although it took me a few chapters before I was really into the book, it was a good read.  The second book was quite a bit more involving, and I'm currently on the third one.  Although the author said the real book was the second one, this is a must-read before diving into the second.
B008JFUO36|1.0|If I could give this a zero, I would.  Tom Cruise is such a clown.  I can't take seriously anything that has his name attached to it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game even if it runs a little shaky on my fire. Be careful it will eat up a lot of your time.
B005J9ZE5I|5.0|The extras on the disc are perfect ,time to off load the old copy I have as this 25th aniversary edition replaces that .
B003H4I4JU|5.0|Short and simple:  I liked it!  Unique story line with great development of the primary characters introduced in this novel.  Far better than Ender's Game, although I enjoyed that one too.
B00EE0OLAW|5.0|I am a 31 year-old male. I write and record my own music in a little recording studio I've cobbled together in my extra room. I like typical hip things, despite how it makes me feel about myself. Enough about me. The reason I mention this is, I love music, in all forms. I have been defending miss spears for quite some time now. The people she works with know how to make her sound good, she's won a Grammy and has weathered more than one media storm. Now, with regards to this collection, remasters on anything produced in the last fifteen years is just a tiny bit pointless, most of the time. The real point of this collection is it pulls together everything a new or old fan would want to hear in one place, and the remaster more than anything evens out the volume and tone of all the work. Just buy it and let it play.
030758836X|3.0|What a great book to then be disappointed by such an un clever ending. I was disappointed. Not sure if I want to try her next book
B00AHHODH2|2.0|This story starts slowly. It then builds up pace and just as your getting involved, it abruptly ends. It was also too unrealistic.
B00EBRWN80|3.0|THIS PROGRAM WORKS WELL ON MY KINDLE FIRE, AND THE WEB SITES COME-UP EASILY. THIS PROGRAM DOES NOT HAVE A GOOD VARIETY OF STATIONS TO CHOOSE FROM AND YOU KEEP HAVING TO GO TO THE PROGRAM LISTS USING THE &#34;PLUS&#34; SIGN OTHER THAN USING THE LIST ON BOTTOM TO BRING-UP LIVE PROGRAMS.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This series was really something.  I enjoyed all three of these books.  It was quite the buzz and I just had to read them
B00407PNY2|5.0|One of the best actors ever. There has never been a bad Steve McQueen movie. I do get  a laugh when they pass the same VW 3 or 4 times during the chase. I'll still watch it over and over again.
B0063M22QO|4.0|Good for beginners,great graphics and bright colors.  I played with out sound, glad to have this option. Looking forward to more.
B00ELD3MUW|1.0|THIS IS AN OVERT PROGRAM AND I DO NOT SUGGETS YOU USE THIS. IT SEEMS OK AT FIRST BUT EVENTUALLY THIS PROGRAM WILL LEAD YOU INTO A VERY DANGEROUS LOCATION AS FAR AS YOU DEVICE IS CONCERNED
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|I absolutely love Nicholas Sparks.  I try and read every book he writes.  I download them on my kindle so I always have a book ready to read
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Nice game<br /> It is a fun game to play from cierra hladky<br />But I wish i had more gure point to UNlock all the iltems to be the minion of the year
B003ITZBVI|5.0|Best animated movie ever. It is Batman at his best. Everything from the animation to the voice casting was perfect.
B00EQNYOYU|1.0|Worst Nine Inch Nails production I ever heard. I used to love this band, but this album is hard to listen to. The band went from a darker, pensive, industrial sound to this electronic dance, club music. My only regret is amazon was able to cancel my cd purchase, but not the mp3 download. Waste of money.
B0040HO01Y|5.0|If you enjoy Downtown Abbey and the BBC style, you will enjoy this series as well.  Tune in and enjoy!
1250012570|5.0|No words can justify how much I fell in love with Eleanor & Park. I'm kicking myself for not picking it up the minute it came out! Why did I wait so long? Oh that's right, stupid me read the ending beforehand and decided it wasn't worth it. If only I could go back in time and smack myself! Eleanor & Park was hands down THE BEST BOOK I've read this year EVER! It was so romantic, funny, super-adorable yet shocking realistic. This book had the perfect balance of hilarity and seriousness and I can't even count the number of time I laughed, giggled (I'm not a giggler!), snorted and even cried during this book. It was perfection at it's best!<br /><br />  Eleanor and Park are very ordinary high school kids but they still stand out because of their physical appearance, Park being a half-Korean and Eleanor being an overweight girl with bright red hair and a weird sense of style. Oh God, Eleanor was such a character, I can honestly say that there is no one like her and probably there won't ever be. She was such a blast to read about, her sarcastic nature in addition to her sense of uneasiness around others was what made her so special. Eleanor was so real, her doubts, fears and insecurities were something I could completely relate to. Though her family's situation was very difficult to understand but I loved how Eleanor made me feel and experience those parts with her words. Simple words ended up making huge impact in my reading progress, whether it was about her crushing and fangirling over Park (atleast on the inside) or her trying to survive her family, I loved every second of Eleanor time, she was a wonderful, strong, brave and truly an admirable character. Plus, she was hilarious, her one liners were the best. There was a scene where Eleanor thinks about some racist comment regarding Parker's eyes and it cracked me up. I loved her so much and I wish I knew a Eleanor in my life.<br /><br />  Eleanor and Park met in a bus and what started as a awkward bus ride ended up being one of the things they both looked forward to everyday. They both were so adorable and their romance was even adorable, and now I want to repeat adorable a millions times in this review because it's the perfect word to describe what Eleanor and Park were all about. But what I loved the most in this book was that the romance never went on the cheesy side, well just a little but most of it was extremely realistic. I do want to mention Park's family, specially his mom for lighting up this story. She was hard to handle in the beginning but the minute her opinion changed about Eleanor, that's when Park's mom became one of my favorite character in this book. She truly made Eleanor feel like a part of her family and in a way, that made Eleanor's life so much better.<br /><br />  Coming back to the ending, I think it was the most beautiful endings I've ever read in a long time. I'm a fan of happily-ever-afters and perfect wrapped up ending, but sometimes a hopeful one works the best. The ending for Eleanor & Park made me so happy and I've heard there are talks about sequel but this is the first time where I'll say that a sequel is not required. Not everything needs to be spelled out, I loved how the author wrote Eleanor and Park's story and I wouldn't change a thing. Plus, can I just add that this is the perfect way to write a third person narrative along with a dual narration. Kudos to Rainbow Rowell for pulling that off so beautifully. I'm a fan and can't wait to explore more of the author's work. Highly recommend Eleanor & Park to readers who would like to experience the joys of first love all over again.

B005LJK3AC|2.0|...completely lacking imagination and class.  Must we hear an expletive every 30 seconds to be entertained? I don't know if I want to see another movie from any of these actors again.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|my kids love this game.It is really funny and entertaining.Put this in your kids face and it will keep them entertained for hours
B001EBV0OY|5.0|Great movie about people who have incredible fortitude, courage and grit. I watch this over and over and never get tired of it.  Nothing is sweeter than carefully planned revenge!!
B009NY43NY|2.0|I have like the Sookie books and anticipated this release.  I was disappointed that Charlaine Harris put so little effort into this book.  Vampires is not my genre to read but I like the way that Charlaine wrote these stories and felt that the ending to this long series was not properly thought out.  I had to see how &#34;it ended&#34; but I could have created a better ending myself!
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|This game is so much fun once I start can't stop it is so addicting this is a must have app..!!!!
B00B7Y0206|2.0|Honestly after Amazon took away watching youtube productively  on the internet I have been searching for a actually Good you tube app that plays videos.At first it worked,but then came the troubles.... I noticed a while back that they place adds ALL OVER. Then it would play the video then stop for a minute to &quot;load.&quot; Honestly really why cant Amazon bring back the old way to watch youtube on the internet..?Or can there be a descent app on here that plays youtube..? I know I`m ranting so I will stop. Unless you have a lot of time or desperate I don't recommend this app highly. :(
B00BH0VSM6|5.0|This is the first in the Harry Hole sequence of books and gives good insight into Harry's character and his unwillingness to throw in the towel when it seems most likely to be the easiest solution.
B00CXVX1OQ|5.0|Got it as a FAOTD but I would have paid for it with what I know now. Graphics are exceptional and is just different and fun.
B007IXWKUK|3.0|I enjoyed the first book and even the second although there is a lot of repetition. I found the story line lacking and slow and just too much of the same ole thing.
B0067Q42BY|4.0|Tutorial was very helpful and enables the player to get started enjoying the game quickly. I like the story line and the opportunity to earn rewards. Well done!
B0031YJFCQ|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this series. While the first two books were action-packed, this one was more cerebral. It was difficult at times to follow the explanations of Swedish bureaucracy, but not impossible. It seemed that whenever I thought of letting this story go, there would be a twist that drew me back in. It is a shame that Stieg Larsson will not be spinning anymore tales of intrigue.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|If you have a good Wifi connection, you will have a very good experience with chromecast ! Hopefully, they will add more apps in addition to the aexisting youtube & Netflix etc
0312430000|5.0|if you are a physician or interested in improving health care, READ THIS BOOK<br />easy fast read, very very thoughtful
B00E5Q1LTY|5.0|Great action, and the friendships evolving were well done.  Also, love the Spock love interest, and Kirk will have one in the next movie!
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I guess it was...............  awesome awesome awesome I have least read it like about a hundred times it is not as good as other ones it is better
B00CXVX1OQ|4.0|Ok,  a boxing game!  Haven't seen too many of em.  And this one has monkeys  (is it just me or are they suddenly the rage?).  I jumped right in.  The clothes selection was a little confusing, but I eventually got it.  The sunglasses are way cool, guys, good work!  Boxing is deceptively easy, but you might find it hard after the 4th opponent or so.  It's not quite clear why my strategy works (when it does) and doesn't work (when it doesn't).  finding more fingers to hit the bonus stars is a real challenge.. (fumbles the phone).  But its great fun for all of that, fast on my Note II, and the characters are Chester Cheetah [TM] cute (you know who I mean).  If smacking monkeys or boxing in general aren't your thing  you won't find much here, but if they are...  its pretty great.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Dark and suspenseful, a really great read! Finished in a few days!! Since I liked this book so much, I will now be getting a few more from this author!
B004ADH1RI|5.0|Fun adventure for the whole family. Who wouldn't want to go on a treasure hunt? Very funny. I recommend this to all my friends. It is  classic.
B000058BGV|4.0|I've been &#34;learning&#34; (by listening) the Bach St. Matthew Passion, and up to now, it's been almost entirely &#34;period&#34; instrument ensembles with so-called H(istorically) I(nformed) P(erformance) P(ractice)--the lone exception was a brief listen to the Klemperer EMI recording back in 1986, ending with me pulling the record off the turntable and vowing never to listen to it again!<br /><br />Now that I'll actually be performing the work this year, I wanted to listen to a more mainstream performance with modern instruments.  I'm well aware that Karl Richter (and this performance) date back over 50 years, but I felt that he couldn't be escaped.  I'm glad I got this performance, as it has stood the test of time well.  While the choral music has a prevailing feel of heaviness, that isn't out of place, considering the subject matter.  What really stood out though for me was the soloists.  Five German greats of that era--Seefried, Toepper, Haefliger, Fischer-Dieskau and Engen--sing the arias and dramatic characters in the story of Christ's suffering and death with great beauty and deep emotion.  I was particularly taken with soprano Irmgard Seefried, whom I had more associated with opera and lieder.<br /><br />I said that my essential reaction to the whole was of heaviness--actually, as the performance progressed and my ears adjusted, that became less of an issue.
B00640UICA|3.0|I wish I could report that I loved this game, but alas, I cannot.  It has good elements, clean graphics, progressively harder puzzles, easy replayability, a unique play mechanic and lots of levels.  After playing it for more than an hour, I just never went back to it.  I found the graphic style and colors curiously annoying, almost sinister.  It's not, for example, like angry birds which has numerous little atmospheric touches that make playing in the environment pleasant.  I feel bad, because this is a solid game, bug free, and something you haven't played before.  I rate it just OK, but, give it a look, I might just be a snob and you could end up liking it a lot.
B00BRH2MN8|4.0|Fantastic sound, I've had Royals stuck in my head for two weeks. It's getting a little overplayed, hear it everywhere go. Other than that. Great album.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Just wonderful, i was heart broken the trilogy is over. E.L James did an amazing job ! I cant wait for the next story.
B003Q6D2B4|5.0|The movie was everything we hoped it would be, we really enjoy it and have watched it a couple times.  Can hardly wait for Red2 to come out on DVD.
B009EHDU7U|5.0|I was lucky enough to be visiting Sweden when I read this book! Jonas Jonasson concurrently tells two stories which are an insight to World events and his own cunning genious!
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|be prepared for some seriously good action and graphics.  Thor and Iron man they did well too. And then there captain America of  course
B00ENTDDGW|5.0|AWSOME arcade style fun on a kindle fire. You have to play this game in total darkness! If for anything else, download and experience this crazy neon effect in the dark!!!!!!!
B00C061I3K|5.0|well, i had a very long review written out, but somehow when i hit backspace to correct some typo, i accidentally deleted my entire post.<br /><br />i'll make this concise and say BUY THIS ALBUM. i'll edit this review eventually, but right now i'm too busy listening to this masterpiece.
B009VIZDLI|5.0|A lot is said about Autism Spectrum Disorder. Perhaps we are all a little on the spectrum. Graeme Simison poignantly describes what life would be like if you lived within the category of Asbergers Syndrome in a hillarious easy to read journey. An absolute page turner
B007L3BMGA|3.0|This is not a love story, it's an ownership story. It's true, you only need to read the first one. It's a story about possession and not healthy possession, the over use of large words was just annoying. Find something else, where the author understands healthy relationship values.
B00062PN6I|4.0|The headphones are okay for the price<br />multipurpose headphones, not for mixing but for other purposes<br />I will recommend this to a friend?, Yes.
B00CPTUNBK|5.0|She was so excited to see this movie.  I was happy to see MLP making a comeback.  Great entertainment for the kids!
159463176X|5.0|This is an awesome and powerful book Hosseini has done it again!!! I truly enjoyed this novel as well as all of his books.
B0055B7IPE|5.0|Really good movie for kids and adults..good humor..the whole family will for sure lake this movies. Thank you. Have a great day.
B000I3P3EM|5.0|There is very little disagreement on the top two Star Trek Original Cast movies: II & IV are at the top of almost everyone's list (with I in the &#34;meh&#34; category, and poor number V ranking in the &#34;Oh my, that was embarrassing&#34; category). This one, for me, is tied with II and IV  for the best. I won't bother to describe the plot; others have done that quite well. Suffice to say that this movie really gets the camaraderie of the crew right; the synergy between them is perfect as the senior officers deal with the knowledge that there are traitors and assassins in their midst, but they never turn on each other; they get to the task at hand with just the right amount of humor balancing the dramatic action. For what it's worth, my ratings on the entire 6-film series are: I. 2.5 stars, II. 5 stars, III. 3.5 stars (The Search for Spock is, I think, often underrated; it is not their best but really not a bad movie, with Leonard Nimoy taking the directorial duties, as he did for number IV as well), IV. 5 stars, V. 0 stars (after seeing this with a date, she asked me what the movie was even about; I had no idea and neither did she; this movie is just a mess from start to finish. Kirk free-climbing El Capitan? I am a lifelong rock climber and all I can say is, give me a freakin' break), VI. 5 stars. So there you go, four of the six movies are very good and well worth seeing, and VI is certainly one of the good ones.
B001NLKZUA|5.0|Book 2 - read, check. This series is AWESOME. The story of Jace,  Clary & Simon as well as the Lightwoods, Luke, Magnus is fascinating. Cannot wait for this to come out as a movie which is set for 2014! Hope the writers get it right for the movie as a lot of details that cannot be eliminated. Read!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I've been playing this game for a couple of months now, and it's so addicting! It would be nice if the devs offered characters to obtain with bananas instead of gold or cash. Other than that, the game is awesome!
B003WUYOQ6|5.0|This book challenges everything we have heard about calories in and calories expended being responsible for weight. It is quite interesting. I thought it a bit redundant at times.
B0054R6BFM|4.0|GREAT BOOK!!!.my only complain is that I wish there was a ending that explains it will except of leading to more....WITHOUT A SECOND BOOK!! >:(<br />P.s. I meant to put 5 stars
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|This book was fantastic. Gaiman is a great writer, and this story was strange and beautiful. I enjoyed every page. Highly recommend to anyone who enjoys fantasy, sci fi, fairy tales, or a good story in general.
B009O2XY12|5.0|i love this game every chance i get i play it .I enjoy playing every chance i get love it.
B0018OFN4U|5.0|This is moving is very entertaining.  If you like this watch spaced where some say shaun of the dead came from.  Its very clever, witty,and smart film.
B00BJA2VFW|5.0|Fun game enjoyed by my husband and myself.  We both agree to give the game a five star rating.  One of the few we've actually purchased!
B009E2WX3W|5.0|This album is deep, masterful, exotic and moving, and even after all these years, the songs still sound powerful. This my favorite PG album after his third one(with his face melting). It would be nice to hear some brand new material from him though, because it's been a while.
B004UID2LC|3.0|I started downloading stuff then after it stopped downloading so it's okay and when they said u can watch full movies it wasn't a lie. And you can download it I think it's okay
B00EH6SK78|5.0|Every song on this album is awesome, guitar solo's with devildriver sound is a must buy.  Devildriver brings there California sound after every song you want more.  Dez's voice is on top of his game.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Temple Run 2 gets 5 Stars!  Fast pace,  the grandchildren love it.  They all play (from ages 5 - 13)!
0802473156|3.0|Got this book for my husband and I to read before bed. I am not as pleased with the content as I thought I would be. You can pretty much read the table of contents and know what the book is about. Either way it gives us something to read at night. Not impressed.
B002Q4U9YU|4.0|I've been looking for this forever.the cd is amazing for any old or new fan.its also great for whoever seen the movie.<br /><br />but the only flaw is that is the original tracks not the live ones you hear in the movie.
0142407542|5.0|Who could not love the Gruffalo???  Bought this and the Graffalo's Child for birthday gift, DVD too!  It is memorizing for my 18 mths old.  So soft, warm and enjoyable.  No yelling or brash cartoons.  She love the mousie best!
B0086700CM|5.0|My grandchildren had me download Temple Run.  They play it often and love it!  5 Star game!  Keeps you on your toes!
B008K6HN8I|4.0|My kindle fire HD did not really have an app for locating items (particularly downloaded items) in the storage structure.  This fit the bill.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This book is so much better than the first one. I devoured it! Very well written. Can't wait to read the next one.
0142403873|5.0|Bought this for gift for 18mth old.  She loves the soft, warm and quiet nature of this story.  Highly reccomended.  Gruffalo's child is also so nice
0061733199|5.0|My son really love it, is very interesting, and usefull. He read it every day. Muy bonito libro, lo recomiendo.
B009NY43NY|3.0|Of all the conclusions a book series as well loved as this, wtf mate!!!! This story just seemed so empty and too focused on summarizing. It was like a mod lodge of past characters with a loose plot and a lame conclusion. Hopefully the real summarization that follows, which makes me ask why it wasn't added into this to kick it up a notch, will fix the blunder I found this book to be
B009DTI0IS|5.0|nice product !!! recomend for all .Movie very well done and produced I recommend to anyone who likes the band.
B004ODLUGM|5.0|Bought this for gift for 18mth old.  She loves the soft, warm and quiet nature of this story.  Highly reccomended.  Gruffalo's child is also so nice!
B000RH0C8G|4.0|You will like this book if you are a real baseball fan.  It tears apart the traditional view of some baseball statistics.  A good read.
B000BMSTMS|5.0|hubby was thrilled to receive this for his birthday.  apparently it has one of his favorite songs that he's been looking for a while.
B000003CKH|5.0|you'll find yourself skipping are \\"Race Car Ya-yas\\" and \\"Stick Shifts and Safety Belts,\\" which stretch Cake's strengths until they become liabilities. All in all, however, 12 solidly great songs make a fine CD in anyone's book.I Will Survive\\", and instead of being sung with Gloria Gaynor's hope and enthusiasm, they give it the drunken bitterness the original lacked.
B005D4YOFK|4.0|These fit great - I am a size 9 and ordered a size 9, fits perfect.  These are higher quality than the Teva sandals they replaced.  The straps are cloth with leather on the outsize and the toe is closed.  I give them 4 stars rather than 5 for two reasons - the closed toe tends to retain trapped debris so if you get something sharp in there, you have to remove the sandals.  Note that this is the way they're designed so if it's an issue, you can simply select another sandal.  The other issue is that the back strap is one piece and not velcro'd so taking the shoes on/off means this strap gets strained to the max any time I put them on or take them off.  I expect that over time, this strap will be the first area of the sandal to fail or wear out.  Only time will tell if this is a problem.<br /><br />Also note that these sandals are built to last so they are heavy, especially in the toe.  They are great for water sports and will hold up to intense activity but can be tiring on the legs and feet if you're not used to the weight.
B001NLKWLW|5.0|I thought this is one of the best books that I have every read. Kate Morton writes a wonderful story and keeps you on your toes throughout and surprises you with unexpected twists. I plan to read all her books in the future.
B007N579X6|5.0|had to get the 3d version. I enjoy watching it on the tv (sinks in) then the movie theater. think it has more depth.  have to re-watch it before the second one gets in!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|i really like this game but i think it should go faster if u buy the women.im play right now my score is 846,??? im gettin up there
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|As long as you go into purchasing this item understanding what it is capable of you'll be a happy customer. I like to watch shows and movies that I can stream on my computer, but not available through mainstream apps on my xbox or blu-ray player, and this makes it easy to do so. Some people have reported some delay or video quality issues, but I have experienced neither and am quite satisfied with no longer requiring a lengthy hdmi cable or lugging my desktop computer from the office to the living room.
B0018RFLN0|4.0|Although Tom Cruise does his usual oogling, we here begin to see his mature acting ability.  Thandi Newton presents as well in this character as her portrayal in Beloved.
030759565X|5.0|I love the salted brown butter rice crispy, the mushroom tart, the lemon stuffed shells and tonight I made the halibut. The fish and fresh salad was incredible. Buy this book and you won't be disappointed!!
0399159347|5.0|Highly recommend. This is the first Liane Moriarty work I have read. It was an extremely well written story that kept my interest. I had to know the secret and once I knew had to learn how it played out. The characters are believable and Ms. Moriarty interweaves them quite well. I love the humor the author presents within the personalities of the characters; their thoughts, even at the most serious of moments, made them seem so normal and real,fragile and conflicted. This book will make for a terrific screenplay, can't wait for the movie. Good story, good plot, good characters, great writing, superb ending...be sure to read the epilogue.
B0063IH60K|2.0|when playing Vegas style very hard to win. impossible deals of cards where there are no moves seem not to be random. after playing for several weeks I let a friend try who is a skilled player and he said it seemed 8/10 deals were horrible and the game seemed to be flawed. if u don't score though it seems to function fine. I deleted it.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|temple run 2 is very fun ad addicting. I just unlocked scarlett  fox and&nbsp;i'm trying to unlock the chinese person ( I forgot her name.) I definitely recommend this game!!!!!!!!!
B00EY8A6BC|5.0|No spoiler, but the end was good but not as powerful as the rest of the movie.  Would watch it again. Was still a Great Movie!
B006ZB3V2C|5.0|Easy to use interface.  A good variety of noise types and huge amount of background scenes/themes.  Much more efficient that keeping a fan or other white noise device on overnight.
0486211045|5.0|Very good book. I'm constantly trying to improve and push my art and this is a great anatomy book. Shows many great poses.
B00CT2P6VA|5.0|I enjoyed the earlier Quell app, and this one is great also. Nice having the hints as I always need them. Good thing to do while relaxing or watching TV. Keeps the mind active.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|Loved the subject matter of the book and the way it was presented.  The light humor sprinkled throughout the story helped lighten the mood of what could have been a depressing novel.
B007IXWL2C|2.0|Good storyline but could do without all the smut.  It took away from the book.  Just not for me and I am a very open minded person.
B003NTSBTC|4.0|The beginning starts off great, it gets a little long in the middle but ends well.  Should have rented instead of purchased.  Probably won't watch it again.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Play this game all the time. It's rather fun<br /> I have all the angry bird games. Keep playing over and over again to get my highest score and try for 3 stars in each level. New levels added sometimes. Never boring. Some levels are a challenge.
B003HARV3Y|4.0|My kids bugged me to get this movie for them, My wife and I thought it was okay, but the kids really love it!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Cannot watch just one episode at one sit.  Have to watch because its addictive and well written.  Love this show.
068817776X|5.0|I can not imagine anyone going through something like this.  It Is amazing there were any survivors from this brutal treatment.
B004HWYTP4|4.0|Don't screw with the old folks..they may turn out to be like these people.  Entertaining because I'm one of them.
B0063IH60K|5.0|It is great to use while waiting in Dr's offices.  My wife loves it she plays while I watch the sports.
0763644765|4.0|Got this for my daughter. She loves reading this book, however she still has no interest in actually being potty trained. But very cute book.
B0063M22QO|3.0|This program was very simple. I prefer harder and more complex puzzles. I like playing mahjong a lot. I am getting older and like to challenge my mind.
B009ZQJ0ME|3.0|High tech CG and Matrix-like messages.  You have to just kick back and appreciate the action and fight scenes even if they are far fetched.
B00821OX98|5.0|We've been able to catch Season 2 and 3 on television, but had missed the first season.  We love it.
B0054TVW04|5.0|I am a big fan ld Fergusons work.  He writes well, covers the ideas and history solidly.  This book is a great read.
0762449306|5.0|This Tardis is very nicely made and lights up.  It was a perfect topper for a 9&#34; round cake.  My son was delighted with his cake.
B00D6BN9NK|3.0|Not as exciting or engaging as the past Die Hard pixs..  An unlikely place to shoot weapons and blow up stuff.  The Kremlin would close up in a heartbeat..
B005PWPUW6|5.0|I have this device connected between the optical audio out of my Sony 42EX440 LED tv and into line level inputs on my 2-channel integrated amp. I had to change the audio settings on my Dish Joey to output PCM only. I now have great sounding coming out of my 2 channl audio system. Perfect!
B005S9EK5Y|4.0|This is a great movie if you like musicals.  I need to go back and watch a second time.  My first time through I was trying to do two things at once and you just can't do the movie justice by doing this.  Great all star cast.  I was surprised at how well the stars could actually sing.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|I am avid book reader. I purchased this book when I was about to go on vacation with the sole purpose of reading it while on the beach. I started the book while on the plane and it truly captured my attention. I was finished before getting to my destination.
0143124544|5.0|I could not put this book down!  It was truly one of the best books that I have ever read.  Passed it along to my mother, my mother in law and they felt the same way.
B006G7YBT2|4.0|Ultimately, I'm very glad I stuck with this book past the first pages, as it's a suspenseful and tightly woven story. I've never been to southern California, and as someone in her late 50s, I just hadn't encountered much of the youthful slang before (\\"locies\\", \\"a booty call\\", \\"glossed\\", even a whole sentence \\"August blows.\\"). Also, there are many characters introduced very early and many of them have strange names, so I guess it was a mistake to read this before its predecessor \\"The Dawn Patrol.\\" But the rich context, with its evocative metaphors, manages to make the meanings clear and the characters memorable. And the dialog is extremely clever. Around about page 90, I realized that I wouldn't put the book down until I was finished. I did indeed gain what feels like an intimate appreciation for some aspects of the surfer culture.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|Great series.  I thoroughly enjoyed both<br />series 1&2.  Looking forward to watching<br />the 3rd one.  If you are interested in the<br />politics of the law profession this will<br />entertain you.
B00E193TM2|5.0|Hell Yes!!! love the songs, cool that the had tech n9ne in one, NEVER WOULDA EXPECTED THAT..... KNUCKLEHEAD FOR LIFE
B00CKOYVG8|5.0|I love competing with my friends each week.  The puzzles are totally different every week so it's always a challenge.
B00BYM5I1O|5.0|If you are a Guy Clark fan, or even just a fan of the genre, then what's not to love?
B003K16P3M|3.0|I thought this was a well written book.  I thought the idea of certain people being born with &#34;Grace's&#34; was a great idea.  That part of the story I really enjoyed.  This is a fairly quick read and it can be a little predictable.  It wasn't a great piece of literature but it is definitely entertaining.
B00BRUQ7ZY|4.0|A concise survey and synthesis of a whole lot of history. Strips away 2,000 years of propaganda and myth-making and constructs a compelling mosaic of the facts at the heart of one of the world's central narratives.
B004XNGKBS|1.0|I bought this app here on Amazon after using the free version for over a year.  Recently I discovered that the &quot;Pro&quot;  version sold here is the same as the &quot;Lite&quot;  (free) version on the other major app selling site. I  thought it must be a labeling error or something.  I mean surely you wouldn't pay $4 for an app here when is free there without people complaining about it,  right? Wrong.  When I open the app and try to access premium features, they  do not work.  It says they are only available with the paid version, which I bought here. So I spent money for....  nothing. Literally.
B001XVD2Z0|5.0|I enjoyed this movie on VHS after it came out on video and rewatched it with my son the other day. It's still pretty fresh stuff, if you overlook the Nokia feature phones :) This movie is one of the best at the &#34;what is reality&#34; concept. Other contenders are Inception, 12 Monkeys, and Brazil.
B005KAH7QU|5.0|The story plot was quite interesting.  At first you wonder what in the world this man is doing with his daughter out in the middle of a frozen wasteland and then you see him teaching her to defend herself.  Then you find out someone wants to kill her and it's up to her to choose the time and place for this showdown.  The story gets more and more bizarre.  In the end, she accomplishes what she set out to do but at such a price you wonder how she eventually ends up.  It's haunting.
B00EE3FVSU|5.0|Broadchurch tells the story of the investigation of the slaying of a young boy in a close-knit community, and the ensuing trauma to the family and friends. It depicts the uncomfortable fact that everyone is a suspect until they're eliminated from suspicion. And, as in real life, many people seem suspicious because of their alibis or lack thereof.<br /><br />The father of the deceased child is not a sympathetic character. I don't like him at all and feel that the writers can't redeem his character in any way. The mother is in so much emotional pain and has no one to turn to.<br /><br />The detectives investigating the crime are an unusual partnership. The male partner is brooding, on-the-edge and carries a lot of emotional baggage. The female partner is a happily-married wife and mother. (Her son was a friend of the slain boy.) The detectives' antagonism toward each other slowly dissolves as they struggle through their differences. They manage to work together in spite of their differing approaches to solving the mystery.<br /><br />The writers do a good job of plotting the progression of the investigation, and don't skip over the emotional trauma caused by the murder. There are several &#34;bad guys&#34; in the community and each impacts the investigation in some way. The cinematography is excellent and the outdoor scene locations are breathtakingly beautiful.<br /><br />Although this is a British series (always excellent) the story is a universal one, and will appeal to almost everyone.
B00E5Q1LTY|5.0|I am old enough to have seen the original Star Trek movies and this movie is very much what I would call an &#34;alternate reality!&#34; Excellent story, just a wee bit familiar, but with enough twist and surprises to make it an all new adventure more than able to stand on its own merits. Amazing effects, intriguing plot, plenty of action, plenty of delving into the personalities of the characters of this new universe, very, very good movie!!
B008VIKLWA|3.0|Thankfully we screened this before showing my 4-year old.  This is a typical Disney movie, with villains and dead mothers.  Yes it's a documentary, but even in nature, Disney found a way to craft a story line with good guys fighting bad guys, death and orphaned children. One group of chimps is a &#34;gang of thugs&#34; and the other is full of good guys. Hard to tell it was a documentary and not a cartoon the way it was narrated.   **SPOILER**  It's put together like a kids movie, but soon, the chimp mother dies and the baby is left all alone, starving, searching for a new mother.  All's well that ends well as is always the case, but I can only imagine the dreams my kid would have after a movie in which the mother dies, there's no father and the baby is left to starve... This isn't really a documentary, it's a Disney movie made by editing footage of chimps.
0374531269|5.0|Another must read memoir. This story is very powerful and compelling.  Is a book that must be read by anyone who works with youth. This book is a great reminder of how many children are force to adapted to their surroundings no matter how unsafe they might be. However, there is always hope for change and success.
B00CPTUNBK|5.0|This might at first seem like just another excuse to sell their toys, but this title actually has a good message for the kids (and adults as well.)<br />Also - remember to support the manufacturer for releasing it on Blu ray !
B00BFV1K0M|5.0|I love the way that the author captures all the feelings that someone in Katniss' situation would feel and it makes the book a joy to read.
B001AVCFK6|5.0|Love this movie and love the special features available on this 3-disc set. Would highly recommend to those who are 'TREK' fans.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|The ending paragraph made me break down...but in a sweet way.  Not a story I would have normally read had it not been for all the great reviews.  Really glad I took the chance.  I continued on to Losing Hope and though they tell the same story, the viewpoints are so different, yet familiar, that you begin to feel like Sky and Holder are very dear friends.
0689835604|4.0|My 7 month old daughter loves this book. Whenever she is fussy and I need to get some work done I just grab the book start to read it to her and by the third page she takes over and starts to hold the book forgets about being fussy and stares at the pages, tries to move the flaps, and reads it to her self in her adorable baby talk! and of course I can then get some work done it usually buys me a good hour :)
B00C1TOTK0|5.0|This is one of the all time great westerns and this is a wonderful transfer. A must have addition to any classic film collection.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|I have read similar books in the past that have been helpful. This book is succinctly written in plain language. No mumbo jumbo. Give it a read. Try the experiments. You will be pleasantly surprised!
B009RX8AQW|5.0|One of my favorite shows. Came well pack and on time. Will continue to shop with this seller as long as this continues to work this well. Thank you.
B00C1S945G|5.0|If you have Amazon Prime and you haven't watched any of the Star Trek series, you're missing out. Great sound, excellent video quality ... great accompaniment for dinner.
B00DHSK3RM|3.0|This is a great way to get your head wrapped around how to play the game and do it well. I personally like the challenge of the unknown.
B00632HWOG|4.0|I would recommend this product for general purpose use and cost value.Be careful what your expectations are and you won't be disappointed.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Easy to use. Many different translations. It even gives you a verse of the day. You can search the part of the verse you know and it will bring up the verses with that phrase.
B00637D114|4.0|My 8 year old LOVES this movie.  It is cute, clean and has good characters for the kids.  As an adult though, after the second viewing I would rather chew glass than watch it again.  It is so happy that you want to pitch it out the window into a hurricane.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|It is a fun interactive game that will entertain for hours. My girls love it. Great for long car rides!
B000000OQF|5.0|Slash is awesome.  Axel Rose is ok.  This is truly one of the greatest albums of the early nineteen nineties.
B002KGEORM|5.0|The whole series is just awesome.  Didn't discover it until last Spring and couldn't stop watching.  Well acted and written.
B0006A9FKA|5.0|Best zombie spoof ever. Closely followed by Zombieland.<br />If you don't like British humor, you may find it a bit dry, but I loved it.<br />It's like Monty Python meets Dawn of the Dead, only a tad more serious.
B00AA7O6QC|1.0|HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE, not one redeeming trait, please don't waste your time - I was able to take about 5 minutes.
1478978082|5.0|Michael Connelly with his main person JHarry Bosh has been a favorite of mine for along time.The stories take you in to the crime and still gives you the knowledge of what it takes to fine the killer,and keep in touch with the victems family and close friends.
B002WY65VU|5.0|Fast zombies, sarcastic heroes... Great special effects in what is essentially a zombie spoof with some tense action. Definitely watch it.

0307749584|4.0|The story was very confustion,it seem to jump around to much at the beginning,had to keep rewinding so I couls follow the story better
B00CTSDDVO|1.0|I had the 3d blu ray preordered since it was announced.  I do not even currently own a 3d television but some of the visuals of this film made me want to own the Premiere edition of this release, and that includes 3d as my next home theater setup may well include that ability.  I had high hopes that this would be another thoroughly impressive and immersive release as was ST 2009.<br /><br />Then I started reading various reports of the smattering of special features, VAM and the like.  The straw that broke the camel's back was the iTunes exclusive commentary track.  This is not Amazon's fault, and it is not Amazon's responsibility to announce to their customers how the version of the product they are selling compares to other retailers, so I'm adding my voice in disapproval to how Paramount and Bad Robot have mangled this release and the overall lack of information and disclosure as to how hobbled the various releases are.  There is no definitive release of this film.<br /><br />Compare this to how Blade Runner was released on blu ray, with every feature, version, commentary and documentary presented together in one complete collection.  I expect a blu ray worth purchasing to include all reasonably available material.  Blu ray is marketed as the ultimate experience of owning and viewing a film at home, and that has always included access to 'extra' material.  But with Into Darkness, one would have to purchase multiple releases of the same movie to have a complete package, and even then, the commentary track (arguably the most interesting 'feature') will only be available on iTunes, including the only US release of the variable aspect ratio of IMAX footage.<br /><br />I do not know how to watch this iTunes version on my 54\\" television, and do not want to be reliant of downloading an additional 5+ gb file to view extra content that should be released on the disk.<br /><br />Some may take issue with a 1-star review of a product I do not own, based on reviews not aboutthe movie itself, but the product as sold and presented.  Well any review is opinion, and this is my opinion, considering the disrespectful and thoughtless manner this film is being released and marketed.  I write this to both inform, and express my dissatisfaction in hopes that others will be warned to purchase wisely and do the appropriate research, I also hope that representatives of Amazon, Paramount, and/or Bad Robot will read and understand the displeasure of like-minded fans and consumers who want nothing more than to be able to fairly and honestly purchase a single, uncompromised product.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|Very easy to use and user friendly. My 13 year old loves it. I even use it myself when I do my online math class.
B00CLD65X0|5.0|It's nice to see that there are still some shows with great stories and strong production. One of the best series I've seen in a long time! I thoroughly enjoyed it and can't wait for the next season!
B003G4W49C|5.0|I was so into these characters by the middle of this book, I purchased the 2nd in series. Same with the 2nd book and purchasing the 3rd in series.
B00D7OMNXS|4.0|Right off the bat, Iron Man 3 has a very different feel to it than the previous feel.even tony Stark himself reflects this in his narration that opens the film, where he says something along the lines of, \\"things are different now, and I'm a different man\\". Even the tone is different, and very unique. It isn't like the first two at all, even- this is reflected by Brian Tyler's score. Whereas the first two movies feel more polished, this film feels more raw and personal.<br /><br />Tony Stark suffers from PTSD as a result of the events in \\"The Avengers\\", and furthermore, said events have made him realize that he's more vulnerable than ever now. Tony has to protect Pepper Potts, and his entire city. As a means of twiddling thumbs, Tony keeps adding upgrades to his Iron Suits. In one upgrade, he can signal them over piece by piece so he can begin wearing it from afar, and another upgrade is that he can move the suits himself. But even these won't stop Stark from suffering from nightmares and panic attacks about the New York events. He feels like he's in greater danger than ever before. This is even so much that he has the suits guard them while he sleeps.<br /><br />For the first part of the film, the plot centers around this and two others: The Mandarin, a mysterious villain who commits acts of terrorism and transmits disturbing images warning people about his full potential. And then there's Aldridge Kyllian, a handsome but mysterious and brilliant scientist who has a cure for all weakness: Extremis, an addictive drug that helps people regenerate through body heat. Admittedly, the latter seems ridiculous given the context of the first two films, taking Iron Man in a more sci-fi direction that is admittedly very unexpected, but it works, in a way you wouldn't expect either.<br /><br />What's really interesting about this film though is the sheer irony of Tony Stark spending at least 90% of the movie out of the iron suit. Yes, even more so than Iron Man 2, which was similarly light on iron, but heavy on stark. Don't let that worry you, though; in fact, by the time the final battle comes along, you won't have even cared about the fact that he spends so much of the movie out of the suit. He even goes so far as to make a stealth break-in in one scene using store-bought materials. And the use of the self-moving suit (controlled by Tony from an external source) is used brilliantly in the airplane scene. I don't have a fear flying, but I do have a fear of falling and the cinematography, even in IMAX, had me suffering intense bouts of vertigo. The plane scene is one of the more well-done action scenes in the movie, and is executed very cleverly. The final battle does cost the film some points in that there's too many suits used in the scene, making it very hard to follow at times, but it's a fun scene to watch, and some very clever twists and cliffhangers are used.<br /><br />Also, stay around for the bonus scene after the credits. I guarantee, you won't be disappointed.<br /><br />In short, Iron Man 3 is the worst of the film and it does have some flaws, but it's still tons of fun to watch. It's both a blazingly exciting action epic and a character study that deconstructs Tony Stark's character very cleverly. Even if you find tons of things wrong with the story, you'll still enjoy it for the fun it offers.milarly light on iron, but heavy on stark.

B008IBPMZG|5.0|It's nice to see that there are still some shows with great stories and strong production with attention to detail. One of the best series I've seen in a long time! I thoroughly enjoyed it and can't wait for the next season!
B005LAIIKI|5.0|I really didn't like the music score but it was still a really good movie.<br />I am sure most will really love it.
B00499NHLC|5.0|Stumbled on this via a recommendation, and was hooked from the opening five minutes.  The interplay between Watson and Holmes is both funny and occasionally touching; their misunderstandings, their throw-away remarks--just great fun.  A major plus is being able to use Closed Captioning; otherwise I could never follow the repartee and the Briticisms.  Only watched the first episode, but can't wait to find 90 minutes to view Number Two.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Excellent read, holds ones attention from cover to cover. Plenty of action. I highly recommend this book to all who enjoy adventure.
B005544TRQ|5.0|Very good show, keep me wondering what's going to happen next. The cast make the show very intriguing. I was able to get caught up, this way I can watch each episode weekly without being confused with what's going on.
B00BSBUZPK|5.0|This is an excellent documentary on the Eagles. It really gives you a backstage look at what<br />these folks are really like when not performing.
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|I've seen this movie at least 50 times with my son and husband.  This movie is so well done, hilarious and action packed.
B00BHMF578|5.0|This movie kept me on the edge of my seat.  It was very well made and moved along perfectly.  I was so nervous for the people in the movie, I gave myself a stomach ache.<br /><br />I would recommend this movie to everyone.
B0047WJ12K|3.0|I didn't finish the movie.  Leonardo is a good actor; maybe too good.  His movies are so intense and they seem to drag on.  They don't make me feel good.
B00A81NFAS|5.0|I can't think of any films to compare this to but at least one scene<br />appeared to me to be borrowed from My Cousin Vinny.<br />A very enjoyable film.
B0083DJWGO|3.0|Good thoughts but very undisciplined and self-indulgent writing.  Author says it should be like that because of the subject matter.  In other words if he is preaching the advantage of disorder, then it makes sense to leave the writing in its primitive (un-edited I expect) state.<br />Not for me.  I got the points after the first chapter.  Didn't feel like I needed to finish it.  More disorder I guess.
B00ABGEFWC|4.0|The pets are cute &amp; the game play is simple enough for my 3 year old, but interesting enough that I catch myself trying to get the pets to the next level. I just wish it wouldn't offer things that cost. they ask for your age at the very beginning, knowing it's a toddler playing, they should remove those options. Still recommend, but make sure all your parental settings are on!
B004CURZFC|5.0|This movie had it all.  Strong moral teachings, excitement, adventure and kept my interest the whole way through.  I recommend it for adults as well.
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|I genuinely liked this book as it didn't have the rosy glow typical of novels about cancer patients.  The author must have done his research because the medical portions of this book are extremely accurate.  The dialogue is a little \\"Juno\\"-esque when the teenagers speak like shakespearean scholars.  The book clips at a pretty good pace and is not all too predictable.
B0026QC0TA|4.0|This is not so intense but rather comes with a sense of humor not always found in movies featuring down and out common folks being cheated by corporate America. Loved it and worth breaking my rule of never watching the same movie twice.
B0074QGGK6|5.0|Every artist goes through a time( at least I hope it wasn't only me) where they think they have to come up with something completely new and original and it can seem daunting and scary. I love this book because it really goes through the creative process and reveals the true nature of art and inspiration.
B002W1UEW4|5.0|I was surprised that I would enjoy this type of movie.  It was believable and top of the line military movie.
B0091VTISO|3.0|Nothing new, same ole story and just a lot of action.  One of the those movies you watch when you are doing a &#34;movie night.&#34;
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Every action we take has consequences and sometimes our failure to act has even bigger consequences.  It is probably in our best interests that we are not aware of all of the consequences, or we may never act at all.<br />This book makes you think about the secrets that everyone keeps, some may say, rightfully so.  Enjoyed the book immensely
B00DC7N9NS|3.0|The movie starts out really slow. Then gets slower. But 3/4 of the way through I really started enjoying the movie.
B005544TRQ|5.0|This show has it all. It is funny, thrilling, and brilliantly executed. All of the characters are performed by top notch actors and actresses. I can't get enough of this show.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Great job for a first-time game. Excellent graphics, and a well done environment. Story keeps you guessing as well.<br /><br />I can only ask for more. Would recommend to everyone.<br /><br />Only grip is that it wasn't a huge amount of gameplay. Just means that we need a bigger follow-up!
B00EI6E17A|5.0|I cannot wait for the album to be released. This is such a great song if you are a Gaga fan. Feel more like her first album.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I love this game. I will always come back to this bingo game it has the most going for it unlike other Hinton games where you play against the computer this is against others. It makes it more fun.
0307950654|2.0|I wanted to read the book since the movie is coming out soon.<br />I have read 3/4 of the book, and it is the slowest moving story I have ever read. Uninteresting and boring. I am so very disappointed.

B00D1DBO1C|5.0|I have tried several calendar apps and they just somehow weren't easy to use. This is super user friendly and some how syncs to my phone (I'm a little tech slow but I didn't not set up either to link), which is awesome! Has several different views and is easily customizable.
B002P7UCMC|5.0|Rammstein's most recent album, Liebe Ist F&uuml;r Alle Da, was released 4 years after their previous album Rosenrot, and I have to say that my expectations were high - And my expectations were not only met, but surpassed!! Liebe Ist F&uuml;r Alle Da is such a strong album to me, and all of the songs sound so fresh, new and powerful, that it was almost like hearing Rammstein for the first time all over again.<br /><br />The tracks featured on Liebe Ist F&uuml;r Alle Da are:<br /><br />1. Rammlied: The title track of the album leads in slowly, then bang, the song kicks into overdrive! This song is basically saying \\"yeah, we have been away for a few years, but if you wait patiently, then you will be rewarded, Rammstein is back!! Rammstein is somewhat giving themselves props in this song, but they totally deserve too, this song expressed what I had been feeling prior to this album coming out.<br /><br />2. Ich tu dir Weh: One of my favorites from the album, Ich tu dir weh is a catchy and pounding track that speaks of sadomasochism, and the choice someone has in enjoying pain - Kind of out there in subject matter, but excellent nonetheless.<br /><br />3. Waidmann's Heil: This track, is basically describing a hunter as he tracks down a female animal of some kind, in order to kill it. As you can imagine the song is very brutal, one of the fastest on the album, and yet the chorus has a short break-down sequence that is really up tempo.<br /><br />4. Haifisch: Again, one of my favorites from the album, reminds me a lot of something I could have heard on their second album Sehnsucht. It features synthesizers and a really operatic feel, and it has such a classic Rammstein sound, but with a new twist. The song details the lack of sympathy given to sharks, who are misunderstood, but still have emotions. This song has a great message, whether speaking about sharks, or humans.<br /><br />5. B&uuml;ckstab&uuml;: This song is very interesting, in the sense that you can fill in the word b&uuml;ckstab&uuml; with, as Richard Kruspe put it, whatever you want : ) . The subject of the song, I believe, is possibly one person with multiple personalities, trying to decide if he should do something bad. The sound of the song is heavy, but it also has a groove to it, I really like it.<br /><br />6.  Fr&uuml;hling in Paris: This song is significantly slower than most on the album, but that does not detract from the strength of this song. This song speaks about a boy remembering a girl he loved, but something happens, she gets angry at him, and he kills her. Not exactly the ideal romance song, but the slowed town tempo and softness of Till's voice, really makes for a beautiful song.<br /><br />7. Wiener Blut: Probably one of the top 3 darkest songs Rammstein has written, this song speaks about the Josef Fritzl case in Austria. The song begins with very calm, melodic music and Till speaking very softly and inviting ( As Josef Fritzl probably did with his poor daughter Elisabeth), before getting very heavy and very fast. For sure one of my favorites from the album, despite the extreme sadness connected to the subject matter.<br /><br />8. Pussy: I have to admit, that the title of this song took some getting used to, but once I got over the ackwardness, I really loved this song! This song speaks about the differing opinions on sex in Germany compared to America, it is really funny to listen to, and has a medium-pace tempo.<br /><br />9. Liebe Ist F&uuml;r Alle Da: The title track of the album picks up the pace once again, and has a really great metal riff. The subject of the song is a man that is desperately trying to get love from a woman, but she doesn't feel the same about him, so he tries to \\"make her\\" love him. Somewhat disturbing in subject matter, but a great song nonetheless.<br /><br />10. Mehr: This song is about someone that cannot get enough of anything, always has to have more. This goes perfectly with the way the song builds, from very slow witha piano playing in the background, to very heavy and intense. This is another one of my favorites from the album.<br /><br />11. Roter Sand: This was the perfect song to end the album with. It speaks about a man and woman who are in love, but sadly, another man kills him in order to be with the woman, leaving the sand red with blood. It has a very light guitar playing throughout, and Till's voice is once again softened and beautiful, it is a really good song.<br /><br />I have not yet listening to the 5 bonus songs, that come with the deluxe edition, but if the album is any indication I am sure they are amazing. The songs are : F&uuml;hre mich, donaukinder, halt, roter sand (orchestra version)  and liese.<br /><br /> Liebe Ist F&uuml;r Alle Da is pure perfection, and it cements Rammstein's status as a legendary group in my eyes. Buy it immedietly, I promise you will not be disappointed.a piano playing in the background, to very heavy and intense. This is another one of my favorites from the album.<br /><br />11.

I find its breakdown of how long the battery is projected to last for given activities is especially useful for graduate school, as I can see at a glance whether I can expect my Kindle to hold up through a seminar or whether I need to find a spot to charge it.

B008KYOCA2|4.0|I have found Jorte Calendar immensely useful for keeping track of graduate school assignments; the use of the &quot;important&quot; checkbox is especially helpful, as I can create a list of assignments due versus readings to be completed.<br /><br />The icon options are a bit cutesy (though choosing the &quot;mark&quot; tab instead lets me create a custom one with the course number -- very handy!).  Repeating or extending an event could also be made somewhat more smooth.  Overall, though, this calendar works exactly as advertised and provides sufficient customization options to be a powerful tool.

If the historical Jesus was born in Bethlehem, it was not the Bethlehem in Judea, but the one that was (and remains) 4 miles more or less from Nazareth (Zebulon's territory. Close enough to Nazareth to say he was born there.)<br /><br />Whether or not he was a zealot per se, it seems likely he was perceived as a political problem to he Priesthood and the Romans. The gospels themselves could in this era (20th/21st centuries) be considered marketing papers, espousing the different points of view of their subgroups of early Christianity.
B004LROUW2|5.0|1Q84 was the first Murakami book I'd read, but it certainly won't be the last.<br /><br />The novel is a masterwork of imagination and suspense, which is nothing short of a miracle, given its length.  Once I read the first page, I didn't stop reading for nearly two weeks, after which I'd finished it.  1Q84 does what every novel wants to do, but is too afraid to: pulls us into a world full of mystery and love, a world that, though entirely fictitious, represents the world around us--all on a scale so epic is consumes the reader as completely as the world outside the novel.  Anyone who's been in love will understand the world of 1Q84, because, in a very real way, they'd remember living there themselves.
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|This is such a fun app it is so exciting an  it's easy to get really far in it. And it's fun to find the animals in the Sahara and bred  then.
B00632HWOG|3.0|I am having problems getting it to work like my regular account I use online.<br />Don't know if I am just not understanding how to MAKE it do what I want or if it just isn't offered.<br />Worries me that stuff I have deleted from either place still shows up on my account later when I open it.<br />Can't seem to put anything into my folders and I use my folders a lot.<br />What I do like how easy it is to get into my account and see my mail without all these ads on the side loading and re-loading which seems to LOSE my mail messages I am typing when it does this and not always will be saved to draft or at least not all the message I so carefully had crafted just POOF gone so another ad about something I am NOT interested in could load.
B00526ZKYS|5.0|Best book ever, finished it in 3 days! I would highly recommend this book and hope to read her others
0060555661|3.0|I received the same book, probably different version.<br />It's taught me lots of interesting things about how to view the stock market. I just hope the advice in here isn't old.<br />The stock market is a different sort of monster now and must also be treated like so.
B00DJFIMW6|2.0|I was not able to figure out how to play this game and the instructions were not there. Maybe the download did to bring that info over.  So I deleted the game.
B00AFCEIB0|4.0|Nice to be able to go direct and just put in what I want to see and have it load quickly.
B006HTUZ1C|1.0|It is not fun for me. Some one else perhaps but not me. It is not my cup of tea.
B004SKHJF2|5.0|It a great app, easy and simply.  I like it a lot  and the best it that she's do it what she has to do
B0037QM8YA|5.0|Loved it!  Loved it! This was a movie that my daughter had not saw so I rented and she loved it also.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|Good app. It wakes me up and tells me the time. What else can I ask of . An alarm clock.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|This calculator seems to work well. I had another app and it came up with wrong answers so this seems ok.
1484156005|5.0|Sebastian takes place in pre-WWI era Vienna. As the title suggests it is the tale of how a boy named Sebastian deals with the loss of his leg after an infection gets out of hand. But really Sebastian is about so much more than that. With a cast of well-developed characters, some of whom are extremely flawed, the story is incredibly engaging. In the beginning you learn about about Sebastian and the Schreiber family through Vera, the matriarch. Not only does she suffer from a weak constitution and the loss of her son's leg, but her husband's affair with a much younger assistant. But Vera proves herself stronger than she thinks when she takes matters into her own hands and seeks help from the very interesting and extremely entertaining Glueck women. They turn out to be both great resources and wonderful friends to Vera in her time of need.<br /><br />As the story progresses, you see how against all odds Sebastian finds love and starts a family of his own.<br /><br />Fischer does an excellent job of capturing the feel of Vienna during such a turbulent time in history. You feel the pain and suffering of the men, women, and children as war tears families apart and hunger and poverty replace the many comforts people had become accustomed to.<br /><br />A blend of history, romance, and hardships that show the political, cultural, and religious issues of the time, Sebastian is a do-not-miss saga. If you are a lover of historical fiction, this is definitely one you want to checkout!
B0036FYO12|3.0|Even for the era in which it was filmed it's pretty hokey. Unbelievable plot. Watchable and entertaining because of Robert Redford and Faye Dunaway, but requires a huge suspension of disbelief.
B000DWMN2S|5.0|I've read the book and watched the movie, and it's really hard to compare one to the other. This movie is wonderful, though, and I highly recommend it. Eugene Hutz is fantastic, as are all the actors, and the sunflower shot is one of the best images I've ever seen in a movie. It's a good story and a good movie.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|It is an up grade to the original. It's OK and I enjoy playing it. Like all this type of game it is frustrating.
B00CL68BK2|2.0|As mentioned in the headline, the acting was great, especially by Cooper and deniro. But it lasted forever, was extremely implausible, and seemed solely interested in the happy ending.<br /><br />nice to see a portrayal of bipolar, but I doubt it would disappear through the power of love or whatever.
B009KS4XRO|3.0|The game reads 'free' but you only get so many tries at Bingo. It does not take long to have '0' Bingo cards. If you want more you have to buy. It is fun but only for an hour if you run out of Bingo cards than you have to wait another day to play.
B00DHSK3RM|2.0|If I was at Level 300 or 400...then yes.....this would be a great app to have...but it really doesnt help!!
B0081JPTCQ|3.0|Easy to use, keeps thing organized. Really glad that they had this app for the free app of the day.
B0097C8XL0|5.0|3 year old loves this game and plays it often. It doesn't have any educational value but she does enjoy it.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Great game but needs more levels.<br />Love the challenge to the different levels.Would definitely recommend this game to others. Awesome!
B004Q7DQLS|5.0|Great beginning to a great series.  Thank you!  Characters are rememberable and sparks fly from every page.  I have several saved quotes.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is awesome for kids. I really can't believe it's free. I use it on my kindle fire and it keeps the kids interested in waiting rooms.
B00BRUQ7ZY|4.0|Most sermons that I have heard insist that in order to understand the Bible you must understand the historical context of the author.  This book gives the historical context of the first century like I have never heard before.  Parts of it read like a novel, parts of it like a textbook.  All of it is interesting.
B000PC0S5K|5.0|I recommend this book for everyone! It's a life changer! &#60;3 it's by far the best book I've ever read, and I will be reading it again!!
B000FC146C|5.0|This is my all time favorite book!  Ever wonder how innocence can be lost by just wanting?  This is an exciting , wonderful read!
B001NLKZUA|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. I can't wait to buy the next one and get started reading it. H n
B000SW4DV2|5.0|My son is 3 and loves. Robots.  This was a good movie for family movie night, not too boring for the adults
B00EI6E0QM|5.0|Lady Gaga was being slammed by the media recently. This song is the perfect comeback song for America's Fame Monster.<br />Good stuff!
0812550706|5.0|A great book enjoyed by all ages. Labeled with many twist and turns the ensures readers satisfaction. It starts off a little slow but ends strong.
B009LDD54K|5.0|great writing, acting, and cinematography.  best season so far, loved the introduction of bobby cannavale as gyp rossetti.  looking forward to season 4!
B005MHHREI|4.0|I knew very little about the Great Leap Forward or the Cultural Revolution, and not too much about the origin of the Little Red Book.  I know a lot more now!  A person with as strong an impact of world history of the 20th century as Hitler and Stalin deserves to be better known.  The authors do not admire Mao, quite the contrary.  Are they prejudiced?  Of course.  Are their assessments realistic and fair?  Hard to say without reading many more sources.  However there is extensive bibliography to this work which tends to make it appear reasonable.  It is a long book, around 700 pages with bibliography and notes.  I found it hard to leave down and finished it in less than a week, along with parers and magazines I subscribe to.<br />I am n ot now in the mood to read another long book about the Chairman, but I recommend this strongly to persons like myself who knew much about Hitler and Stalin, but little about Mao.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|I really enjoyed the what if  at the end. Very good book. Kept me interested, quick and easy read. B+
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I was devastated by the ending, Mesmerized by the possibilities to come! The whole season was enthralling. I could not have enjoyed it more.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|Great game<br />I LOVE THE playstyle of the game so far. Can't wait to get further<br />Into it. Great job by the makers of it
B008J05EL8|1.0|I downloaded the APP,It would not open, I tried to delete it and try again. It would not be allowed to be deleted.<br />PLEASE REFUND THE 3.28 BACK INTO MY ACCOUNT as fast as it took for you to remove from account.<br />NOTIFY ME BY E-MAIL THAT THIS ACTION HAS BEEN ACCOMPLISHED
B00846REIS|3.0|I loved Fifty Shades of grey. This book was very similar to that book which kinda disappointed me and kept me interested all at the same time.
B006GECE9Y|1.0|Because I was not able to download it. And if I did can't find it on my kindle fire hd
B001BANK32|5.0|I have probably read this book a dozen times over the years and it is still a interesting and creepy read. What really struck me this last time is how the story progresses into insanity. Jacks descent into madness is more unnerving than the ghosts.
B007TNS6JI|5.0|Great game however, as with so many of these games, they require you to either spend real money to advance or play for ungodly amounts of time in order to purchase upgrades.
B00D8HNR2K|5.0|Other reviews have already gone into depth with the specific tracks and such, and summed it up well.  I'd just like to say that I've been a fan for a long time, and every album is a little something different.  Often those albums sounded a bit off at first, having listened to his previous material.  And over time as I listened to them more, my ears adjusted and realized how good they were. This album holds true to that; you can tell that it's him but it has a different vibe.<br /><br />Trent Reznor doesn't make the music that people tell him to. Or expect him to. There are no proxy votes on what the next album will sound like.<br /><br />I love that.<br /><br />For long-term artists, it can be a catch-22.  Churn out half a dozen albums that sound the same and some people will be happy, but others will bemoan that they keep selling the same rip-off album over and over.  Make something different, and some will like it and others will complain about the sellout that doesn't care about the 'true' fans.  Personally, I prefer genuine creativity to an attempt to just make people happy and/or make money.<br /><br />I don't think a lot of people can do this; write album after album where it's always something new. And it's not just garbage or noise. He has changed as a person and allowed his music to do the same. The album feels genuine to me, an extension of his prior work in a different direction. Building on but not beholden to what came before.<br /><br />Some will be disappointed (as with everything), but I think he's done a great job of letting people know what this is before they buy it.  Three songs were available for streaming or download before release, and just before launch the whole album was streamable from iTunes free.  Nobody need be surprised, or feel cheated of their money.<br /><br />I got the deluxe, and packaging is very nice. Lyrics/art is well done and the whole package is like a little book. The remix songs seemed interesting at first listen. I'm nota huge remix fan in a lot of cases but I'm glad I got the deluxe.<br /><br />Summary? If you've enjoyed the different directions his music has taken in the past, chances are good you'll like this. If you're looking for a very specific sound from him, listen first.  As a fan, all I can say is \\"Thank you\\".
B0092SQ5EG|5.0|Awesome! Didn't think this would appeal to me, but Katy Perry is tough and inspiring! Pleasantly surprised by this movie
B00AS1Q93S|3.0|I love this movie ive seen it before and it was great so i got it online and shipping was expensive af and i got it scratched. like really. all and all it was a good movie lower shipping cost and take better care of it and your golden!
B00C7E3EFU|5.0|This is an awesome movie!  I have two versions of it on DVD, but this is my only version on Blu-ray.  I have watched it countless times.  I don't know why I love it as much as I do, but I love it!  I wasn't so happy with the condition of the jacket upon arrival in the mail.  I don't know if it was because of the shipper or the package before it was shipped.  But I love the movie.
B00AFROVQC|2.0|Horrible.  Initially the bones seem like this would be an OK book but it just goes south.  The later books are worse.  Don't make my mistake and keep reading them.
B00DUGCLY4|4.0|Th<br />is game keeps you thinking. Great game to play while waiting for appointments.  How many games help to keep you thinking?
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Unbelievable season! I can not believe the season finale, shocking. Dying for Season 4 to get here. Please hurry January
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|I luv this game its reall fun to play.<br />I also like the diff. stages and diff. cars u can choose from
B006UN3FTY|5.0|I remember reading this book with my dad when I was little.  On a whim I downloaded the kindle version and read it again.  I couldn't put it down.  As an adult reader, Paddington is even more charming and endearing than ever.  I fell in love with the story all over again.  I would recommend this book to readers young and old.
B0040HO01Y|4.0|The characters are well developed and there are plenty of comical notes.  Costumes and situations are authentic.  Very entertaining and leaves you wanting more.
B00AFCEIB0|3.0|Searching is different from using a computer.  Wish they would keep it the same as if I was using the a web page on a computer.
B00CKJ2KK2|5.0|so cool it almost look like call of duty<br />so cool!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!.if you don't get it than your girls<br />so get it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!&iexcl;!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B007FEFLTO|5.0|As usual for Follett, this book was hard to put down from the start. He follows history quite well & includes stories about the people so well you can really visualize their lives.  I didn't want the book to end.
B00E8B1P9M|4.0|Awesome cast! grat new effects. The Ninja scenes never been tried on other movies.<br />Great content ...good action!<br />this is an action film but it does show that we must respect the Arm forces for what they do fo us. It might me fantasy...but no to far in to what it could happen.
B008YKGQR4|5.0|Great app really well worth the download,  Just like if I was on a computer, or laptop.  I recommend this to anyone who wants to connect to FB
B00144VBBS|5.0|Great songs,<br />How do you like me now<br />Beer for my horses<br />great lines \\"... back in my day son a man had to answer for the wicked that he done...\\"<br />love to dance to this music
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|A good game. I couldn't get it to play on my Kindle at first. I had to download it a couple times. Obviously set up to get you to spend more money.BUT I love it!
B005GY0Y8S|2.0|Too many French spelling mistakes.  The story could be interesting if it wasn't interrupted by so many French spelling  mistakes.  The author should have proofread the manuscript with a French speaking person or use an English-French dictionary.  Too bad, I was looking forward to read it but couldn't finish it.
B00CCX9DUG|3.0|Elizabeth, daughter of 'The White Queen', also written by Philippa Gregory, deserved better from her husband and Gregory. 'The White Princess' joins Gregory's intriguing and impressive novels about the cousins' wars or the wars of the roses as they have been more well known. However, it is a disappointment. 'The White Queen' and 'The Red Queen' are strong portrayals of powerful women. The depiction of Elizabeth, the queen who brings an end to the cousins' war through her marriage to Henry V11 never reaches these heights. She is portrayed as the victim of both queens, her mother's ambition and her mother-in-law's cruelty. The depiction of her inability to control her life is also demonstrated through her acceptance of Henry's treatment of her. Of course, Gregory is forced to adopt a fictional treatment of  her characters' inner thoughts. However, Elizabeth's thoughts are those of a victim who never seems to move outside her role as wife to a tyrant and mother to another in the making, Henry V111. Perhaps there was limited material available to Gregory.  Elizabeth seems somewhat lifeless. She is depicted as  worn down by her experiences, rather than demonstrating some of the flair, glamour and power that surely would have been her inheritance from Elizabeth and Edward. However, despite my reservations, I was pleased to see a continuation of this period under Gregory's hand.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Really great book - I couldn't put it down. I found myself wanting to skip forward and then would make myself stay where I was.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|I love playing these games. Only hate that you can only go so far and have to pay ifyou want to finish it.
B00CKYHH6O|5.0|This new blu-ray collection is awesome on the new 55&#34; HDTV!  I look forward to each season when released & am impressed with the quality of production. I have not missed the old VHS set except for the boxes!!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Love love love it. Best game ever. Great for adults and kids. Easier then temple run and a lot more fun then any other running game.
B006CHML4I|5.0|I just love this watch.  Is not as big as other watches I own, but also not as small as a ladies watch.<br /><br />Certainly it's very different, with the hours on the inside part of the watch face and the minutes on the outer part.<br /><br />A very nice touch is that you can choose the display of the day in English or Spanish<br /><br />Also, I have been wearing for a week and maybe it has lost 3-4 seconds<br /><br />The display at night is very bright.<br /><br />Being a automatic watch is also a big plus.<br /><br />And also, my wife &#34;stoled&#34; it for a couple of days and she also loves it.
B005D4YGRG|5.0|I convinced my husband to replace some old leather Keen sandals that he had worn for years with these Newport style Keens.  He seems to like them very much.
B00ESY7QXI|1.0|No surprises could have taken a pass on watching this one. Subpar acting a distinct absence of creative license a lackluster production at best.
B008JFUTT0|5.0|Fiction must struggle to sound plausible. Life operates under no such constraints. The less you know about the subject of this film, the better. Suffice it to say that if fully deserved the Oscar for best documentary that it won last year.
B004SOR4H6|3.0|Kind of a waste of time.  Like FB much more.  More informative, user friendly, more connected with friends.  That's me
B0074D3CAQ|5.0|The Unlikely Pilgrimage of Harold Fry was an excellent book. Well written, entertaining and full of interesting characters! Enjoyed it immensely and made me want to make a pilgrimage of my own.
B00BSBT8M6|3.0|Rented this due to the rave about the story line. However, it was difficult for those of us with grounded yet different belief to really appreciate PI's outlook on life - still interesting it was shared in this story
B00DPY95D6|5.0|Chomi Prag's Cult of Mirrors is a thriller with a believable, original and compulsive plot. I was glued to this book and couldn't put it down until I devoured the book.<br /><br />Court of Mirrors started with courtroom drama and then turned out to be a full-fledged thriller.  Cheryl, our main character, is a lawyer. After a long crazy trial, Cheryl was trying to escape loneliness and pressure from her work and she got hooked on drugs.  But that's only the beginning. Her entire life becomes a train wreck. She is no longer sure of her safety. She is never sure who is on her side. And she thinks some occult might be watching her and invading her space. But there's only a thin line between what is real and an imagination of her paranoid mind.<br /><br />This book also has lots of laugh out loud moments. For those who want imaginative and excellent writing, original story plot, characters that come alive in the reader's imaginations, Cult of Mirrors is the book you are looking for.  I recommend it to all lovers of thriller and courtroom drama.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Everyone should watch this series. The amount of talented actors exceeds any I have ever seen. Surprise in each episode left me impatient to watch the next episode.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|Latest version too cluttered, hard to find info quickly. Wish I could go back to old version. Looking for a different app.
B004IFD9HE|5.0|Great movie to watch for the entire family! This is was quite entertaining especially for our kids - very appropriate in content.
B00594XOZU|4.0|As mentioned, kik is great for texting and sending pictures... The only requirement is a data plan.  It can send pics to phones on limited accounts with no picture messaging included...<br /><br />Improvements I'd like to see... Easier way to block someone and a logout button.  Also would be nice if it saved your messages when you get logged out (I. E.  When you log in on a different device... Automatically logs you out of the first device and you lose all the messages)...
B00CKOQC9C|5.0|Timeless classic....showing the good and evil in humankind.  Read it years ago and now again with new, older, wiser eyes.
B009ZQC7MY|4.0|Love this series, can't wait for season four.  Luv the interaction between Tom and the rest of the family.  Have only watched the first four episodes, so still have lots more to see!!!!
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|Very addictive. I don't know why this simple game is so addictive, but it is. I play it every day..
B00DQC2FPM|5.0|Better than I expected and a great price! Love how you can change it to be inline with the different movies.
B00DU77QP2|5.0|This book was just fabulous-the story flowed well and there was nothing unnecessary about it! The twists and turns keep the reader guessing!!!
B00CH87HF4|5.0|When i first saw the game i wasn't sure but about it, i was like well its probably lame like 95% of the game  you see. So anyways i thought i would try it out an  see what it was like, i can only say this, I'm hooked i stayed  up all night and missed school just to play this game. Its that good, and  you might be thinking why skip school. All i can say is try it its worth the time.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|I bought a Sony Blu-ray Disc/DVD player with EIFI. It cost about twice as much as the Chromecast device but it does tenfold more. It is really a nice player/browser. I still use the Chromecast on another TV but the Sony is my first string.
B001VU1NJ0|2.0|This is a good and interesting story, a little predictable, but good.  Unfortunately, Sean Penn plays one of the main characters.  I am struggling to explain in an understandable way how poor his acting is.  This is probably the best way to describe it: instead of seeing an actor playing a character, you see someone acting like an actor playing a character.  It is as if he is a caricature of an actor, not actually an actor.  He is lampooning a dramatic actor, not being a dramatic actor.<br /><br />If you disagree, try this; turn down the sound and watch his scenes with no volume.  Is his character displaying emotions that match the words?  Not even close.  Take the words away, and he is just a parody of a dramatic actor.  His role needed a little subtlety; he responded by chewing it to mush.<br /><br />Imagine an actor who had learned all of his technique from the few minutes of each Rocky movie after the fight is over.  \\"ADRIAN!\\"  That is Sean Penn's acting technique.  Just terrible.  What a shame.  Good potential wasted on terrible acting.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|My daughter is enjoying learning about taking care of horses. I had to explain some things to her, but she is learning quickly.
B001AXJ1PG|5.0|even though Jordan Rudess is not in this, A Change Of Seasons will always be (to me) a Dream Theater classic. and the &#34;Uncovered&#34; stuff? really? hell yes, it rocks. they (with Mike Portnoy) always did awesome covers!
1575666286|5.0|If you liked this book, I would check out The Gerson Miracle on DVD. This stuff is good reads, and good eats.
B0013TXA5Y|3.0|When I started reading this book I thought...Harry Potter meets Twilight...it's OK and I am gonna see the movie but I'll wait to read the rest of the books if they are made into movies...
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Amazing show! So glad Amazon has it. Recommend it to anyone who's interested in the old Britain lifestyle and hierarchical system.
B0018ARMWU|5.0|the first ever Dream Theater i ever heard, so it will always hold a special place in my heart and for another reason too : its the tour i saw them on : the Touring Into Infinity tour!!!
034580404X|5.0|NOW I get it...<br /><br />I was hesitant to read these books because I had heard so much about the sexual \\"just porn\\" aspect, and I really didn't think I would like them.  However, I decided to go ahead and read them, and WOW, I am so glad I did! The story is much more than the sex, it is a really good, sweet love story...in addition to the sex aspect.  I agree this may not be great literature, and in some ways you do have to suspend \\"reality\\", but hey, this is fantasy, get-away-from-it-all reading, and it really hits a home run.  I totally can't wait for the movies!<br /><br />If you are hesitant about these books, give them a chance... you might be surprised!
B0092SQ5EG|5.0|Exciting, fun movie/tour! I want to be Katy Perry! What an amazing life! You could really tell everyone that was part of the tour really enjoyed themselves. She seems like a great person
B00DUGCLY4|3.0|Entertaining but the hints take too many coins &amp; it costs too much to buy extra ones. But overall, pretty good.
B001ILFUDC|5.0|It was the original Disney production, and played well on my standard DVD player.  Both sound and picture were of good quality.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|A must read. Hard at first to figure out but brilliantly written to tell multiple sides of a traffic time. Hard to put down.
B0082Z447U|5.0|Even though this book was lengthy, it held my attention throughout. Many books that are as long as this one tends to ramble and provide so much detail that it becomes tedious. That was not the case with this book. It was excellently written with a most intriguing plot. I highly recommend this book!
B00AZRBLHO|4.0|Whether you are an experienced devops engineer, or completely new to the concepts of Agile, this is a good book to read. But the story is rapidly annoying. Every problem is treated the same way, with the same incredible level of success, in record times. I understand the author is more interested in making a point than writing the next NYT Best Seller, but a little bit a variety would have made this book a lot easier to pick up at night.<br /><br />Overall, an excellent read, but you can tell it's from and for engineers.
B008220C56|5.0|Love it!! The styling of the story, the costumes, everything!! Plus all the extras and bonus material, so happy I got it!!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I love this show!  I would recommend it to anyone who is a fan of great writing, suspense, and drama.
B004TN7QPG|4.0|Works very good. would give it 5 stars if you could find touchpoint to open notes you create a little easier.
B0067Q42BY|3.0|Like it so far. Just got it 15 minutes ago.  Will have to review it after I get more of the quest done.
B004H1V5RU|5.0|This puzzle is great to play with. But warning....it is NOT easy. There are many levels and many of them are hard. Took me about half an hour to get to 15. But to me, this just means you will not get tired of it. Comes with a little stand so you can keep it on a shelf. All in all, a fun puzzle.
B009VIZDLI|5.0|I literally couldn't put it down. The characters were all so loveable, unique and fun. I can't wait for the movie. Somebody make it soon!
1594487154|5.0|Daniel Pink, the international marketing guru, has unleashed yet another bestselling title, To Sell Is Human: The Surprising Truth About Moving Others. In this volume, Pink pulls back the curtain on the delusion that some of us are \\"salespersons\\" while others are not. In today's information-driven economy, we're all salespeople--whether we want to be or not. Whether it is products, ideas, information, opinions, or even ourselves, we're all selling something. And the sooner we realize this fact, the sooner we can adopt the skills necessary to be successful with whatever it is we're selling. Full of relational storytelling, witty comments, and practical tips, To Sell Is Human is one book that should be an easy sell to anyone who wants to be successful in today's economy.
B001ANSS5K|5.0|John Green is an absolute literal genius.  I can't even fathom how he became so intelligent and so understanding of teenagers.  This book, all of his work for that matter, is highly recommended.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I love it and so does my 4 year old. warning though it is addictive! I love the characters and the animal families.
B006M7JCC2|5.0|Her words are simply believable. Spoken with the eloquence of one who has been there and must report her truth though words are inadequate.  Anita leaves the reader uplifted and renewed in body mind and soul.
B00EY8BRGU|4.0|Didn't watch the movie in theaters because of reviews from EP daily. But this was a gem of a revenge flick :) it was great!
B0064W667Y|5.0|This probably was a big inspiration for \\"Once Upon A Time\\". Shows that comics still can delight and surprise. Highly recommended!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Not too hard and not too easy, just the right difficulty so you won't quit.<br /> Even more difficult if you are color blind like me.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|This game is a small village building game. You can earn or buy new animals, spouces and hatch children. You can also build various kinds of roads, fun buildings and landscape items as well as expand the size of the village. You collect rent and feed the inhabitants to earn coins to buy more. You can also earn acorns and hearts which can be used to purchase special items. Frequently they are required to purchase the things that increase your level the fastest. Along the way there are bargain sales of acorns and coins so you can achieve your goals more quickly. I found myself going back and purchasing acorns many more times than I really could afford. I enjoyed arranging an rearranging my village as I incorporated ideas from friends villages that I visited. By visiting I earned  more coins, found Scrat, and visited their Hydrax tree to earn hearts. That is the slowest way to progress and I will see if I can move forward without making any more in game purchases.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It's just awesome .so get started playing the game and have a lot of fun.so that all that I have to say.
B00ECUARO8|3.0|I know a lot of folks do not really care for Matthew McConaughey and if you are one of them you will not care for tghis movie.
006224454X|1.0|Being a Dennis Lehane fan, his short endorsement was enough to get me to fork over money to buy the book. After about 50 pages I was already starting to scratch my head. By page 80 or so I was so bored I was wishing I knew how to speed read, not wanting to simply skim ahead and maybe miss some key element. As it turned out, there was no key element. When I finally finished the thing, the first thing I did (and this is the FIRST TIME I HAVE EVER DONE THIS WITH A BOOK) was to walk over to the trash can and drop it in.
B00AEFYCL4|5.0|I found this story to be deep and though provoking on how we all handle our parents and how we were raised , here we see Chris acting out as an adult for issues that needed to be addressed directly with his parents not in this spiteful action of avoidance and misdirected anger. But what an adventure to undertake if it would have ended on a more positive note.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I couldn't put it down. Really well written, believable characters, interesting world-building. I will be thinking about this for a good long while.
B00866JL96|5.0|This is a beautiful love story. The plot is well written, the actors have great chemistry. I have watched it several times since I received it from amazon.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|Movie is well done.  Missing some of the detail from the book that leave some things unexplained.  Would recommend it as entertaining and the location shots are beautiful.
067942850X|5.0|Jon Krakauer brings a depth to this story like he did with &#34;into thin air&#34; adding a true character feel to the book , actually understanding and believing in Chris's belief in what he was doing was right , when in fact all he did was hurt the ones he cared for the most . Talking and sharing his feeling, as he did with the strangers he met , with his parents could have giving them at least knowledge of his anger and something to hold on to after his passing but in the way he undertook the way to show his anger was almost cruel . I am a parent and know how much pain the ignoring can cause but then to not be able to make amends and share their hearts in forgiveness makes it so much harder . I have read this 3 times and I get more out of it each time but still the same result at the end.  Forgiveness is a Powerful thing .. more powerful than anger.
B002N7RAH4|5.0|Hilarious and well written film a must see movie if you also like Shaun of the dead! A must rent!

B007FIY3VW|1.0|I usually use this app to take notes and when I first got it, it did an awesome job. But then when updated it, the app started crashing a lot. I do not recommend this app. It didn't work for me and I enjoyed it at first. Not so much anymore. Wasted money.

B004SOR4H6|5.0|I love twitter,honestly it is freakin addicting 2 be on. Its a cool thing 2 be on. I love it.
B001BR7CZW|1.0|We were unable to watch the movie, due to continued issues with the movie constantly loading. We actually stopped watching after about five minutes in, when the movie would no longer continue to play, and just sat in a loading loop for about 15. This was the third or fourth time it had been loading since we had started it. Really, really unfortunate.
B00821OX98|5.0|love it! We started in season 1 and cant stop!....We Just finished season 2 and starting on season 3. excellent show!
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|The ending was not the one I wanted, but it was the one the story needed. Gaiman captures the longing for something more, something unknown in this novel and he does it beautifully. There is strangeness, magic, and wonder throughout these pages, and ultimately there is hope.<br /><br />Ocean shares some story elements with Coraline, but aimed at a more mature audience. As Gaiman himself has said, though the main character is a kid, this is not a book for kids. So if you enjoyed Coraline, but want more meat on those bones, Ocean should hit the spot.
0345803485|5.0|This is one of three interesting books that I've read recently.  The other two are Barack Obama George Bush & the American Dream and Declare the Islamic Saga and Terrorism.  These readings just encourage more reading.  Great going authors.
0783225857|5.0|This is a fantastic companion to the story, &#34;To Kill a Mockingbird&#34; the students like having a clear visual to watch after a good read.
B00E5Q1LTY|5.0|What can you say but another great film to perpetuate the Star Trek world for fans and non-fans alike.  I like how past characters are being introduced in these &#34;prequels&#34;

B00E8KLWB4|4.0|This is great for puzzle solvers. Lots of variety. I wish the graphics were more clear, maybe more vatiety in color. I am still working on figuring out all options and what different icons mean.
0316228532|3.0|The hype on this book really worked against it. Since it was the first post-Potter book, a lot of assumptions and expectations were made that it couldn't live up to. An okay story, just not one you'd expect from the world's most famous author today. Definitely not for children.
B007LGPSX0|5.0|I loved the show when it was out in the 90's and I still love it.  I wish Prime would get all the seasons because I would watch every season again!
0345529057|5.0|George RR Martin is an absolute genius. If you love fantasy, you'll love the Song of Ice and Fire series.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|so cute and fun for all ages! the graphics are great and the game never gets old!! its my children's favorite game right now!
0375703764|5.0|The most original novel I've read in my life. The way it is structured is too amazing to describe in words. I was never able to guess what was going to happen next.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I love this game.  The harder the squares to fill the more challenging.  I like the timed games also.  Keeps my mind active and is a great challenge.  Easy to play but hard to complete.  This is what I look for in a good game
B00BB3UYS8|4.0|I am not that great at writing reviews yet, but I will leave you with this -- Outview is a MUST read! I am really not into suspense novels, but this kept me on the edge of my seat! Never a dull moment! The plot never stops, the characters are fantastic, just overall a very interesting and intriguing read! Can't wait to check out book 2 :)
B0067Q42BY|4.0|This app is exciting and engaging! I wish the screenshot was a bit larger. It gives you hours of challenging fun. I would recommend this app!

B00CBDCB0G|5.0|each book I read adds to my desire to read another. I am hooked and am working to read all of Agatha Christie's stories.
B00E7PQVHK|3.0|I enjoy playing the game, but it is very frustrating to play. Half the time your character moves the opposite direction than you pick, it is almost impossible to get into chests or crates, and somehow I managed to pull up the strength screen during a battle, but have no idea how to turn it off, and can barely tell what my team looks like. Three stars at best.
B005J0VPNC|4.0|This is a great little picture app for adding Adobe like special effects to your shots.<br /><br />Best I've tried so far.
B00AHG9KYE|2.0|I have read all of Clarke's books and found them, in general, entertaining. However, in 3001 Clarke spends an inordinate amount of time espousing his beliefs and political positions that rant about what appear to be his socialist leanings, anti-democratic beliefs and how everyone from our time period were moronic sociopaths who could barely walk upright and use tools. The classic liberal academic who sees everyone as mindless sheep if they chose not to blindly follow his vision of the world and &#34;how it should be&#34;. The story wanders and is dull, leaving questionable issues and more questions that, now that Mr.Clarke is dead, will never be answered. I found this to be a disappointing end to a fantastic saga.
B00006J3WH|5.0|A great CD with all the songs from the musical Ep &#34;Once More With Filling&#34; from the Buffy The Vampire Slayer series season 6 Ep 7.
B0067Q42BY|4.0|This game was pretty good for the cost that I paid, it was FREE! The game was pretty simple, and fun.

B00821PCJS|5.0|With all of the 'crap' on TV, Falling Skies gives a thirsty audience, something to look forward to.<br /><br />Falling Skies, on Network Television or Amazon's, Kindle, begins with, 'just another day', of unknown chaos in the lives of a handfull of survivors, trying to live minute by minute after the world's recent invasion and destruction, by a bizarre alien race.<br /><br />I wish the other reviewers had given F.S. another chance, before responding negatively.  It's a shame that they gave up during the Premier's, first commercial ever aired.  It appears they thought the Premier should've started with a, 'BANG'!  These critical viewers, picked on, complained and misunderstood that Falling Skies is for you and I, an everyday audience who desires a story that's captivating and creates a world that allows us to forget, if only briefly, our overbooked and unsteady lives.<br /><br />We watched the story unfold gently from the very beginning, developing gradually to a crescendo of never ending conflicts.  The dedicated viewers watched a wonderfully crafted and diverse set of characters.  F.S. characters share their strengths, fighting and scavaging abilities, gifts and<br />expertise  to protect one another.  Their experience, knowledge and stubbornness keep themselves alive in their recently fallen world.<br /><br />The 'Second Mass's', Premier and every following episode are 'just another day', trying to stay alive, while moving tirelessly, traveling and trudging forward to Charleston, a city they believe can bring them hope.<br /><br />We cheer on our favorite characters, and mourn those who are lost.  Falling Skies is for us.  We may be the everyday normal network viewers, but we are the ones who complete and turn in the ratings boooks.  We see a fantastic series that begins and ends, where the writers convey that Falling Skies is and will be, not the shows first rodeo.  We lovers wait impatiently, for the new season to come.
630471193X|4.0|Great movie for Sci-fi fans as well as enough family and emotional drama for those who like \\"Chick Flicks\\".  A good movie to watch for those in love and those that hope to be.  Also just enough of a tease movie to keep you watching for aliens til the end.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|Great character descriptions, some surprising turns to  each of them and ending was  unexpected  in so many ways !  This was  gem to read on vacation.
B006N0YWGY|3.0|An ok game if you just have time to kill.  It's exciting at first crashing into and destroying things for the heck of it.  Once you get into playing the game it's fun but a lot of the same over and over.  If repetition without a lot of thought is your thing this is your game.
B000I9YV12|5.0|I got the correct movie I ordered.  I love it. I really enjoy this movie. Thank you very much. Thanks
B008476HBM|5.0|A classic that I love to read over and over. The story of two sisters and the trials they must endure to find love and happiness.

B006ZDS7CE|5.0|I absolutely love this album.  Her music is reminiscent of Amy Winehouse.  I recommend this to any Amy Winehouse fans.
B0059ILFJ8|5.0|I always thought it was a drag that the Dead were plagued by the media with their following; hippies, drugs, psychedelia etc. The Band (Canadian!) were always considered the greatest &#34;American Band.&#34; I respectfully disagree, The Grateful Dead will always be the greatest American Band, period. American Beauty rises from the earth; flows like a river and shines like the sun. One of the greatest records ever.
B004SI8WX2|5.0|Ms. Morgan's description of her time spent with the Australian Aborigines was an astounding journal. Like all of the indigenous natives, the Aborigines are connected to Mother Earth and intuit nearly every experience clearly. I applaud her courage to share her trials and adventures with us. Great read. Loved it.
B0000DJYPB|5.0|I have been listening to this record(s). I remember being 14 years old, flat on back with headphones on listening (loudly) side by side, over and over. It was a phenomenon that occurred after seeing the movie \\"Gimme Shelter.\\" I was forever changed.  I started buying all their stuff with my \\"lawnmower\\" money. What can I say about the songs that hasn't been said before. The Stones were extremely fertile (and hungry) in this period and I would agree with most true Stones fans that they probably peaked by '72. However I believe history will be kinder to them at least up until \\"Some Girls.\\"
B001ANYDAO|4.0|While some of the stories and examples in this collection are, by far, more interesting than others, overall this was a really insightful read - quick, too!
B005544TRQ|5.0|The show is witty and so well written. Great references to pop culture old and new. Some I got, some I had to look up. Did a great job setting up long ranging stories but my favorite part is the dialogue.

B00DHKKN6Q|4.0|I do like the game it is lots of fun.  I don't need to buy coins.<br />just like hitting the bubbles. I do love shopping on Amazon.
B000ICXQGK|5.0|This outstanding movie is an emotional home run.  A grand slam that clears the bases bringing home loss, pain, grief, and joy. Fully expressed and realized in the surprising visuals (Ellen M. Somers), magnificent photography (Eduardo Serra) and carried throughout with an intoxicating musical score (Michael Kamen and The London Metropolitan Orchestra) that hauntingly swells with intensity. Vincent Ward impeccably directs a visual feast portrayed through paintings.  They literally come to life throughout the film placing the viewer into another dimension all within the changes of Chris Nielsen (Robin Williams) and perfectly ethereal Annie's (Annabella Sciorra) realities.<br /><br />The two meet quite suddenly while vacationing and remarkably find that they are truly soulmates.  They may not fully realize its beauty at this venture but as time passes the wonder becomes more and more evident.  A lifetime together is altogether inevitable as they marry, have two children and begin a lovely family life.  What is immediately sorrowful is the tragic accident that takes the lives of their children and throws the couple into gut-wrenching grief.<br /><br />The story jumps ahead four years while the pain of loss is taking any life from the brilliantly artistic Annie.  Her paintings (done by Stephen Hannock) are being affected and her mind is becoming more distraught.  It is then that a freak accident happens again and Chris dies.  She is left alone, her family gone and also her own will to live.  From this moribund beginning comes a fantastic living tale of a husband's passionate and overwhelming love for his wife driving him through heaven and hell to find her.<br /><br />Chris' journey begins in a heaven that he has created for himself but seen through the paintings of Annie.  An angel guide, Albert (Cuba Gooding Jr.), is there to aid him in realizing that he has died and must go on separately.  His creation is awash in vibrant color with an identifiable use of the color blue from the start of the film.  What he sees and makes true for himself is what Annie creates or has created.  The look at morality is done without a major pull onto any certain religion so it can astoundingly stretch the boundaries.  It's quite another view of the afterlife that is as imaginarily beautiful in its heaven as it is as boldly macabre in its hell.<br /><br />Annie takes her own life.  Albert gives this information to Chris who becomes desperate to save his wife from the hell she has also created.  The movie treats the act of suicide very differently than the way it may be viewed by some, with more of a compassionate tone.  As freeing as Chris' reality may be, Annie's is quite deliberately confining.  The visuals and the sets come to life and seduce the viewer into a horrifically confused state of mind.  The Tracker (Max Von Sydow) takes Chris to places where no other has ever gone, as nobody has ever been brought back from this terrifying place.  Annie does not know him here, she has slipped into her mind and birthed a place of repetitive torture.<br /><br />Based on the novel by Richard Matheson with a masterful screenplay by Ron Bass, the story jumps off the screen and truly captivates.  A very active movie that effectually works all the way around, digging deep to portray this transcendent love between husband and wife.<br /><br />*Enveloping every part of myself concerning the recent happening to Robin Williams, along with the deepest sorrow and compassion for his family: May this in some remote way honor his wonderful memory. 8/2014e from the start of the film.

B00B4VI8MQ|1.0|What they don't tell you is that it's ONLY A DEMO and you MUST DOWNLOAD the game from inside the app before you can play it.<br /><br />I don't recall the exact size but it's over 500 Mb.<br /><br />It's reasonably fun but if the paid game length is as short as other reviews say, it's definitely overpriced.
B003PBB4ME|3.0|Not very stiff. Has some wobble to it with larger heavier dslrs like my 7d. Thought it would allow for smoother shots. Find myself awkwardly holding camera while grip is against my face or chest. Made my own steadicam instead...

1594204217|4.0|I love Michael Pollan's books, having first discovered him when In Defense of Food became all of the rage.  I was delighted when I spotted Cooked available among the  newly published \\"Hot\\" books at my local library.  \\"Hot\\" books must be read within a short time frame and late books are unduly punished with a $1 a day late fee, so it was a race against the clock to finish reading Cooked, including its Afterword and recipes in the Appendix.  Normally, I like to leisurely read a Michael Pollan book, enjoying his poetic prose while contemplating all of the insights and connections he makes for his readers.  This book was very well written and researched, and Pollan characteristically supplements academic research with firsthand experience.  By apprenticing himself to master chefs, bakers, and \\"fermentos,\\" Pollan gives us both a cooking lesson and historical overview to different cooking processes, thematically dividing different food preparation methods into four sections, each categorized under one of the four classical elements.<br /><br />As a vegetarian, I was less than enthused by the hundred or so pages of \\"Fire,\\" where a whole-hog barbecue was finely dissected.  \\"Water\\" also proved to be a carnivorous fare, as Pollan seems to have forgotten his admonition to eat \\"mostly plants,\\" or the Jeffersonian advice to use meat as a \\"condiment for the vegetables.\\"  Pollan seemed to endorse the \\"flexitarian\\" diet throughout In Defense of Food, yet the dishes he and Samin Nosrat (Pollan's former student turned chef) prepare are the opposite of meat's role as a mere flavoring principle for the vegetables.  Vegetables in these dishes (mirepoix/soffritto) take a secondary role in flavoring the (slow-cooking) meat. I loved the \\"Air\\" section, and all the fresh baked bread descriptions inspired me to buy an artisinal, organic, whole-wheat baguette at the farmers' market (but not inspirational enough to actually get me to bake a loaf myself, as the whole creating and feeding the \\"starter\\" seemed beyond daunting--and I normally love to cook and experiment in the kitchen).  I also loved the \\"Earth\\" Ferment Vegetable section and learned quite a bit about the many boons of the microbe world.  Describing the pivotal role microbes play, Pollan continues his theme of co-evolution (we shape them, they shape us), a theme his book Botany of Desire aptly explored.  I learned an unsavory fact during the \\"Earth\\" Ferment Animal section:  animal rennet, a catalyst that contains the enzyme chymosin, allowing it to rearrange milk proteins (i.e., coagulate), is sourced from the stomach lining of baby animals, specifically goats, calves, or lambs.  So, I will have to be much more scrupulous in ensuring that the cheese I purchase in the future is made using vegetable rennet (a less natural, but more humane alternative). (I feel incredibly guilty that I am no longer vegan after eight months of committing to the vegan lifestyle and debate whether I am going to become vegan again; vegetarianism is pretty easy, in my opinion--force yourself to watch a documentary about factory farms/slaughterhouses and you won't want to eat meat, but something about removing all eggs and dairy from the diet proves more challenging.)  Although I rarely drink alcohol and have absolutely no desire to brew my own beer, I enjoyed the Ferment Alcohol section and recognize alcohol's important role in the history of civilization---it gave our ancestors a safer drink than water and may have inspired the advent of agriculture as much as bread.<br /><br />Pollan describes the act of cooking as providing humans with an auxiliary stomach of sorts, predigesting food for us so as to render it more nutritious and absorbable; he cites scientific literature to describe cooking as being a very energy efficient way to digest food.  Anecdotally, my experiences are a bit different from the medical literature Pollan draws upon.  I briefly experimented with the raw food diet when I was vegan, eating about 75% or more of raw foods a day.  If I ate nearly 100% raw for several consecutive days, my mood, energy levels, and \\"information processing speed\\" all seemed to improve.  I didn't get winded when I exercised, and my facial skin became almost poreless and very clear (I suffer from seborrheic dermatitis, so I appreciate any diet or supplement that can keep the skin condition at bay).  The raw foodists argue that the enzymes in the uncooked food help digest the food in the body (heating above 115 F or so will destroy these enzymes) and that the body considers cooked food as foreign, as its proteins have been denatured/rearranged.  Some of this is debatable, but I did notice that my skin looked great and I didn't get winded when I exercised when I was on a mostly raw food diet.<br /><br />I did enjoy this book, but I would have appreciated at least one fully vegetarian dish described in the Water section.  Also, I think that Pollan dismissed the raw food culture too quickly, as he didn't even mention any of the possible benefits of such a lifestyle.  Of course, his book is about cooking, not \\"dehydrating\\" or juicing!5% or more of raw foods a day.

B001KOFH2G|5.0|Great movie, wish there was another one to follow. It is a little sad at the end but it shows where some parts of the TV series was not able to go after being canceled.
B00DRPVE3M|1.0|Getting the coins is utterly ridiculous. And every time I'm about to win there's some kind of &quot;problem&quot; I hate this game and I'm uninstalling it after this review.
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|Surprise!  It shipped a month after ordering it and surprise, no Netflix three-month discount as advertised.  It doesn't really do anything -- well -- that I can't get my Internet TV or Roku to do.  Sure, you can watch a show on your PC browser and have it show up REALLY fuzzy on your TV simultaneously.  (And yeah - I have great WiFi so it's the product not the user with the issue.)  But I could do that WELL with an HDMI cord and my CPU or laptop.  Maybe down the line, they'll improve it but I bought it because it was a great deal with the Netflix discount they conveniently &#34;ran out of.&#34;  It's pretty much a waste of money.
B004XECNCW|5.0|I dont understand how anyone could not like this movie its absolutely great! We all know what its about so I won't go in the synopsis but its a definitely must have in the blu ray collection.<br /><br />Buy this movie if your a fan of the older classics like me!<br /><br />A+ all the way around
B00CATSONE|1.0|I was hoping this would be a in depth look at Tesla' s life but it's just an advertisement for a stupid self help book.
B003F5NSTW|5.0|I found the book was honest about the mum's feelings and I wish all new parents would read it and realize what a responsible huge job bringing a life into the world is.
B003P2WO5E|5.0|Good character development.  Sanderson does not overwhelm with too many characters in the first book.  Good action.  Easy to read.  A real page turner.
B00DHSK3RM|2.0|I OREDER THE WRONG GAME I THOUGHT I WAS ORDERING CANDY CRUSH SAGA. I WOULD LIKE TO DELETE THIS FROM MY KINDLE. CAN YOU TELL ME HOW?
B000NGTJTY|5.0|Best gangster movie since Casino. I love that it's the Irish mob this time. Loved the Boston accents, hated the RedSox caps.
B000001GPX|5.0|A masterpiece of the century !<br />The details and articulation by Klieber should not be missed by Classical music lovers.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Its been wonderful  playing this game since i don't have a real horse. Thanks to the ocreator's wonderful idea, i have Beauty and its amazing. Thank you
B00AYB1RGG|1.0|Waste of time!  Spend my Saturday evening watching this movie, and it was just horrible.  I do not recommend this movie at all!!
B004VMUS9G|5.0|I have blown the speaker on my cell phone and have turned to my Kindle Fire as an alternative. This app allows me to keep all of my several alarms organized and on. Customizable and convenient.
B00CWY76CC|1.0|I am in my 70's and could not get it to work  So I got rid of it sorry it looked good
B00001OH7M|5.0|just buy this damn cd if you don't have it. just don't even piss around reading this, just buy it.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|Easy to customize. Many options. Nap settings. Accurate. Extremely dependable I've used for years and has never let me down.
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|Did not think I would like it !!  But to my surprise I enjoyed the movie.<br />Fresh, new idea and concept.. nice to see in this day and age of constant remake and sequels.
B00729GQ0A|5.0|This was a very polished piece of work the author did a great job of bringing a new storyline to the table of paranormal fantasy types. The depictions surround you virtually, the way they are written it is very easy to vision the story as you breeze through it almost refusing to put it down. I believe that this book could easily be made into a film and I want the tickets to it when it does :P I dig the whole paranormal horror genre very much. The kicker is I happened to stumble into it at a highly discounted rate which was a total bonus. I am becoming an amazon bookaholic I haven't watched a lick of TV in over a month lol! There are some rather good published works on here this is clearly one of my favorites out of the recent titles I have read. Nice Work!
081297381X|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book.  As someone with a degree in economics, and a passion for economics I loved this book.  I don't think those that practice economics are as obtuse as the author makes them out to be, but perhaps those in the financial professions he has had experience with, and those that win Nobels mostly are. Many of the reviews here detract for the arrogant tone.  There is an arrogant tone, but it is endearingly so:  it's more like you're out having drinks with Taleb, sharing stories and life-views and sometimes you're laughing and nodding and sometimes you want to punch him in the mouth...  Like he's a real person.  He is smart enough and erudite enough and experienced enough to spot the BS and call it, and that is what he has done in The Black Swan.
B002VECM72|5.0|Of course movies are personal taste so take it for what it worth. my daughter thought it would be a great gift.
B008AK8FHM|3.0|In Proof of Heaven, Eben Alexander told an incredible story of NDE. I found it to be repetitious though and in many<br />p<br />laces just too much medical terminology for the lay reader.
B001DM1VXE|3.0|I don't know which category I would put this movie, but I really did not get the intent of the movie. If it was for entertainment only, I can think of other ways that would be more entertaining than watching Pi again.
B00DONVMFM|5.0|If you like period type movies then you will enjoy Downton Abbey.  You need to watch beginning with Season One if you haven't seen this series.  I highly recommend and have enjoyed it so far through Season 3!  Season 3 ended differently than I expected, and I was unhappy to see this particular character leave the show but it is still worth watching! I can't wait for the new season!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I was very happy with being able to watch this season on my computer and Amazon made it very easy to do so.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|What a great read!  If the rest of Mr. Howey' s books are as good as this series my husband will be looking for a new wife that will cook and clean instead of read, read, read.....
B00DU73T08|3.0|Entertaining; it was a lot like the book, but slightly less amusing.  If there are sequels, I will watch them.
B004FP1WX0|4.0|This movie is an interesting story about what the anonymity of the internet can make people do, even though I do get this unshakable feeling that the filmmakers aren't quite as naive about the whole situation as they'd have the audience think. The story of Angela and Abby and Megan is interesting, regardless of how much Nev and co. did or didn't know going into the project.
B003U53GK8|5.0|When LOST was on TV so many people I knew had issues with it. Now that I have sat down and watched it I can't understand why. This has become one of my favorite shows. I don't have the issues with the continuous mysteries that others seem to have. In fact, I think they really add to the feeling of the show.
B00ESY77LO|5.0|Excellent remake. I enjoyed the way modern music was used at different points in the movie and the overall representation of the time period.
B00CO4KGYA|5.0|When you first start playing Tennis in the Face it's pretty easy and I could understand some people turning it off after a few games, but if you complete a set and move onto the next foe of villains, it gets more challenging. A few sets in when your up against opponents that you can only hit from behind because they are protected by shields, or the scientists you need to hit twice because the first shot only shatters their hazmat suit, or most of the walls are protected by barriers that if the ball hits disappears and uses up one of your balls (you only get a set number to complete each game of the set (or area of the map), it can occasionally can be a fair bit of a challenge.  This is a game where granted a lot of the time you don't need to think, but occasionally you do.  Enough here for adult players and also it's not only kid friendly but a bit educational for them too.  Tennis in the Face teaches not only basic physics at having to hit something at the right angle to get the ball to bounce the way you need it to but that persistence and sticking at something will ultimately allow you to complete a harder challenge.  I found the hardest one was the credits one where all the staff from the company that made this have Jib Jab style, their heads on cartoon bodies, and of course you've got to hit them all.  It's difficult as you have less balls than players and pretty much every surface is protected by the barrier that eats the ball.<br /><br />Sure it could do with more levels but what's there is a lot of fun.  You don't need to still be connected to Wi-Fi to play it either once it's downloaded. The current list price of $2.99 is probably a bit high but then again you'd spend that on a good Kindle book that would take you about the same length of time to read as Tennis in the Face takes to get through and complete all the games, and you can always go back and replay each one, how likely are you to do that with a book?
B005SHTXN0|4.0|Classic Dustin Hoffman film with Tom Cruise in Rain Man.  If you have never seen, it is a must watch.
B004FP1WX0|5.0|I was turned on to Catfish the TV Show a couple of months ago when someone I follow on Twitter got catfished.  I didn't even know what that meant so I searched around and found Catfish the TV Show on MTV.  I was immediately, pardon the corny pun, hooked.  I had to go online and watch every episode I had missed.  So then I started wondering what the movie was like?  Figuring it was what they based the show on, I really, really wanted to see it.  I kept putting it off and saying I would wait to see if it showed up on TV but I never saw it.  I finally ended up renting it tonight and I was not at all disappointed.  I am a fan of the show and now the movie!  Both have been so entertaining.  I was afraid after reading some of the 1 star reviews for the movie that it wouldn't be any good but I found it just as entertaining as the show and it was fun to see how Nev reacted to his own catfish. I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone if you like the TV show.  I found it to be entertaining and I love how it wasn't scripted, at least it didn't seem to be on Nev's part.  He seemed very genuine and I hope that this bad experience will continue to be a blessing in disguise for him.<br /><br />Update:  Watched this again tonight.  I gotta say I love this movie!  The part I love the most was when Nev was reading the sexy texts while hiding under the blanket.  That made me laugh so much!
B00DGKQF2S|4.0|Billy Sheehan always seems to take on interesting projects.  This one combines hard rock with a virtuoso power trio format.  Songs sound a bit like Mr. Big and late 70's hard rock without sounding dated or stock.  A lot of interplay between the 3 musicians makes the album standout.<br />Excellent playing from Billy -- who never disappoints.<br />Kotzen and Portney also show their talents.<br />Worth the risk.
0399159347|5.0|Wadn't expecting the &#34;Secret&#34;. Have already shared the book with my mom and coworker. So glad I saw the review in the People Magazine.
B00ET47USI|5.0|I love Spider Solitaire.  It is very addicting. It is very much like the Spider Solitaire on my computer, except this one is easier to move columns.  Just click on them and they move.
B004G5ZY7E|4.0|I really enjoyed the depth and complexity of the book.  I just found transitions from one &#34;scene&#34; in the book to another lacking.  As a result, I had a hard time knowing whether a scene in the book was a dream, past experience/memory, or present.  Maybe the transitions got lost in translation?<br />Nonetheless, I am eagerly downloading another Harry Hole novel to read!
B007V2UGPE|5.0|i love it. its fun and free. i like fighting zombies.  definately worth the download. you'll like it too.  have fun.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I am so intrigued by Christian s point of view and want and need more. Can't wait for the movie
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|Loved the book!My favorite series that I've ever read!<br />Wish there were more!So much better than the twilight series!And the movie really sticks to the story!
B007ZXK08C|5.0|I read all three books in order, and this one was just unbelievably great! I finished it in a weekend! I just couldn't put it down! You really hate and love both characters and you just wish them on each other. Reading the &#34;diary&#34; amy and &#34;real amy&#34; was so good i actually wanted to kick myself for feeling bad for her!!! Gyllian flynn has definitely become one of my favorites!!!
B002PEP4SC|5.0|Great product! Great job on the timely delivery delivery! This product is so worthy the price.<br />I totally recommend this product and seller!
B0027MJU00|5.0|The best part of Gillian's works for me is that you never really like the main characters but you are so consumed about what happens that you can't put the book down!!! Great development, surprising but still predictable enough that you keep reading to see if your guesses are right. It was a long time since i read a book that was this exciting!
B008HJGPVO|1.0|This stylus works great for about two months.  It has 3 ends. I have owned 3 and given 3 as gifts, but every one of them has broken down within 3 months.  Tears in the tip.  I have given this item 3 chances and have given up on it.  It is a defective engineered item and definitely not worth the price.  I have had others with fewer tips which have cost less for a longer period of time.  The only advantage this one has over the other stylus is the 3 ends, the length and the finish, but does not last long.  In my opinion, pass on this one and buy a less expensive one. I only rated this with one star because I could not submit this without a star rating, otherwise I would not have given this a star at all.
B005544V6A|5.0|Cannot stop watching it one season after the other. Love the show, and now DVR the 3rd season. Can't wait for Amazon for that after watching the first two seasons.
B001M0HGR2|5.0|I loved the comedy and action of this movie. I wasn't expecting a movie like this when you hear about iron man on comics.
B000EXZI14|5.0|I am the Bee Gees biggest fan.  This is just the  best album I own at this point.  I listen to it every day at home and in my car.  Thanks so much.  Love you Bee Gees
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Clever plot developments, and better characters make this extension of the engaging series even better. An enjoyable view into complicated lives.
B00CU9LHY2|5.0|Top band. Really unbelievable what they mid nineties. So many good songs in such a short time. I am looking forward to the other reissues (Machina II).
B00ECU34ZM|5.0|I feel like this movie paralleled the new Tron movie in the relationship between entertainment elements.  The story was developed enough to be interesting and somewhat engaging, while the visual and sound effects took center stage.  The acting was also believable and lent just enough uncanny-valley atmosphere (without actual humanoid robots) to make things feel uneasy and like there was some sort of facade.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|Game is addicting, but I wish you were able to zoom out more. Need more species of fish and coral as well.
B002APU580|5.0|Best movie ever. I read the book and loved this adaptation. The actors were amazing. I do recommend the novel though. READ IT.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|My boyfriend and I love this show. We couldn't wait to get DVD from Netflix, so we decided to purchase here
B005D9MUWY|5.0|I had used this app before and when I saw that it was up on the appstore for free, I pounced on it. I'd recommend buying premium anyway because of the great functionality of the keyboard. The predictions and autocorrect are on point and the heat map tracking is incredible. The number of stats it collects adds to the app but just having the ability to customize the keyboard my way makes it more than worth it! Highly recommend!!!
B0042U94UQ|4.0|It is a funny movie.  Not sure I like the glamorizing/normalizing of someone intentionally being evil and the bashing of cookie sales that mirror Girl Scouts'.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this game. I have It on most of my electronics. Except my Xbox 360. It does need a lot of updates over all it the bomb.
B004G600A4|4.0|I don't know what to say.  you will have to see it for yourself you will have to see it for yourself
B002SGYPS2|5.0|It's a good story of a man born in a TV show and finds out that his whole life was fake.
0446310786|5.0|This truly is one of the best books I have ever read.  I tend to like books penned by women about strong girls, e.g. Glass Castle, Anne of Green Gables, A Tree Grows in Brooklyn, Girls of Tender Age.  The fact that it is semi-autobiographical makes it even better to me.  If you saw the movie first, it probably won't ruin the book, it just added faces to the characters for me.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I HEART this book!  I heart Abby and Travis....but mostly, I just heart Travis.  *Sigh*<br /><br />I had the hardest time putting this book down.<br /><br />I DEVOURED this book.<br /><br />Stayed up until 3am fighting off the sleepy monster, to figure out how in the heck it would all end.  *Sigh*<br /><br />During the duration of the book, I felt like I was on a roller coaster.  It was gut clenching. The highs were high and the lows were low.  (Did you hear me say \\"low\\" in a baritone's voice?  Because that's what I did *Wink*)<br /><br />Abby and Travis are both stubborn, adorable, irritating, lovable, yet somehow perfect together.<br /><br />So what's it about?<br /><br />Abby, is a new college student, who's moved away from home, trying to escape her past (more like run from it), and wanting to start anew.<br /><br />When arriving to college with her best-friend, she mets the \\"lean, cut and covered in tattoos\\" (Oh, la-la) Travis.  He's also a college student, attending the same University, but is more known for being a fighter/bad boy/man-whore.  The type most of us girls would eat up!  Am I right?!  Right.<br /><br />Travis is exactly the type Abby is attracted to and is desperately trying to stay away from, but Travis is drawn to Abby and ends up making her a bet.<br /><br />If Abby wins, Travis has to abstain from sex for a month, but if she loses, she has to LIVE with him for a month.<br /><br />This book is exactly what the title says - Beautiful Disaster and I LOVED every.single.minute of it!<br /><br />One minute, I felt like my heart couldn't grow any bigger, and the next, I felt like it had been ripped out and stomped on.<br /><br />So when I said \\"roller coaster\\", I meant it.  I laughed, got angry....at one point, I even wanted to put my Nook down and have a real good cry, because I was soooo upset (!!), but of course, I couldn't do that. That would mean that I'd have to stop reading!<br /><br />This book will entrap you.<br /><br />What's even better?You'll love every single moment of it, and when it's all over, \\"The End\\", you'll be thinking about it even more, and loving it even more than when you were reading it and *might* even consider re-reading it again!<br /><br />Beautiful Disaster - Was 5 Stars for me!  5 friggin' stars!!<br />[...]
1400052181|4.0|Loved this story. It offers a piece of history most of us don't know about while including the hugely emotional and human story of the family involved. It did slow down about a halfway through and lose a bit of its appeal (I had really high hopes based on the first half), but the story is what it is and it was really nice to be part of the author's struggle.
B00846REIS|5.0|I was introduced to Sylvia Day's, Crossfire Series, after searching for something that could get me over my Fifty Shades of Grey (FSOG) book hangover.  I ended up finding a recommendation list, and after doing a search through Amazon and Barnes and Noble, Bared to You, was the book that kept popping up.<br /><br />This series ROCKS!<br /><br />This book was a great read and I found myself flying through this book!<br /><br />DO NOT, I repeat DO NOT, start this book before bed!  You will not sleep.  Trust me.<br /><br />So what's going through my head right now?<br /><br />I really liked this book.<br /><br />Gideon's hot, overbearing, possessive, alpha-man-ness was all too alluring, along with some un-said forward acknowledgments that had my heart skipping a beat (or two).<br /><br />I actually adored Eva and Gideon's skirting around each other in the beginning.  It locked me into this story. The fact they were both obscenely attracted to each other, with his directness, and Eva's, girl power attitude, it was really just a nice change of pace from some of the other books I've read like this.<br /><br />Now, I did find some similar actions/wording/phrases that were very similar to the FSOG triology. That said, the writing style between Sylvia Day and EL James are different, which I enjoyed. Maybe I caught onto these similarities more than most, because I had just stepped away from 50...(?), but the similarities were surely there.  Once I got used to the likeness, and got into the flow of the book, I set the cruise control and held on for the ride.<br /><br />For me - The only downfall for this book, which I felt a little annoyed at, was Eva running off every 2 minutes, instead of confronting her boy-crush about her feelings.  The merry-go-round ride got under my skin a bit, because even though I like an erotica book as much as the next gal, I felt that through all the sexual connections they had (and there are a lot!), I couldn't always feel that emotional connectionwith them at times...<br /><br />So what's it about?<br /><br />Sexy Billionaire, Gideon Cross (Oooh...just the name seeps authority and power!), and the beautiful, smart, self assured, Eva Trammel,  are two lost souls who find each other through fate.<br /><br />Eva has just moved cross country, from California to New York, and is trying to adjust into her new life with her roommate and BFF, Cary. After settling in, she is prepared to start her 1st day at work the following day, and decides she'll take a quick trip from her apartment to her place of employment to see how long it will take her to walk each day.<br /><br />After she's timed the walk, she's making her way to leave the Crossfire lobby, when a woman nearby accidentally tosses the contents of her purse and things go flying.  Feeling sorry for her, Eva stops to help the woman gather her belongings when she literally runs into a tall, dark, handsome man, in a 3 piece suit.<br /><br />As she picks up the contents from the floor, her eyes slowly trace up his body and the further up she goes. The more she likes.  He literally takes her breath away.<br /><br />Gideon is cool, calculated, smooth, uber sexy, and mysterious - And he has his eyes on Eva.<br /><br />Before their eyes meet; Attraction pulses between them.<br /><br />Then it happens...Their eyes lock.<br /><br />Lust at 1st sight.<br /><br />And the pursuit in on!<br /><br />As Eva starts her career, the encounters between them become more frequent.<br /><br />Gideon does everything in his power to see her.  To be with her. To make her want to be with him.<br />*No spoilers, but I am dying to tell you everything!*<br /><br />He is very clear and upfront about his intentions with Eva.  In fact, he blatantly tells her. Repeatedly. Exactly what he wants to do to her....but Eva...Well, she's floored by his unreserved come on's and while she's never been possessed by a man quite as beautiful as Gideon...she is just starting out in her career and wants tofocus on work.  Solely on work. So, she turns him down, time after time, and is all \\"Ugh...As if!\\".<br /><br />All the while, her mouth is saying \\"No\\", but her body is screaming \\"YES!!\\"<br /><br />Gideon, being a man who's used to getting everything he wants, sees right through her direct dismissals and continues to pursue her.<br /><br />After all; Eva is the only one who can give him truly everything he needs and everything he seeks lies within her.<br /><br />His desperation for her.<br /><br />His need for her.<br /><br />Whew...<br />Now do you see why this is the perfect FSOG follow up, right?!<br /><br />As you get to know Gideon and Eva, you begin to realize that both have troubled pasts.  Pasts that have stayed with them and haunt them on a daily basis, and they'll have to learn how to grow stronger together, to be together.<br /><br />So what happens next?<br /><br />Read it to find out!!!<br /><br />4.5 stars for me!<br />[...]<br /><br />FYI:  Rumor has it, that the Crossfire Series will also be coming to a screen near you! Your TV screen that is.  *Wee*  Is it too early to start counting down the days?  Just sayin'...
1594746036|4.0|I really enjoyed reading this book. The reason for the 3 stars is that, based on the first half of the story, it could have been mindblowing. I was completely enthralled the first half, and then I just kind of enjoyed reading the second half. It's entertaining, for sure - it just had the potential to be so much more.<br /><br />Once you learn how it was written, though, it becomes that much better.<br /><br />Potential SPOILER ALERT (not to the story, though, just in how the book was written):<br />.<br />.<br />.<br /><br />The author had a large group of old photographs and made the characters in the story based on the crazy pictures. If you think about it that way, this becomes much cooler, and actually kind of important in terms of understanding how people write. The pictures are all included in the book, which pulls the reader into the same situation as the author.<br /><br />I still think it could have been done better, but I enjoyed it.
B005LAJ16I|1.0|All you need to know about the producers and writers of this series is that they had the gall to use MSNBCs Lawrence O'Donnell conduct a sympathetic \\"interview\\" with the lead character (a US Marine).<br /><br />The day you see anything even remotely sympathetic on MSNBC about a US Service member (other than one claiming rape or denied a sex change operation) is the day you know you stepped into an alternate universe.<br /><br />The series becomes more and more absurd and it's tissue thin veneer as nothing more than a left wing propaganda piece is cemented very early in Season 1.<br /><br />What will be really interesting is that in 5-10 years these same people will produce shows about Libya, Syria and other Obama military interventions but they will watch like a John Wayne Rah-Rah movie of the 1940s/1950s.
B004L9MFM2|5.0|Usually I don't read this type of novel but i have just turn into a huge fan and can't wait to start the next book
B00499QUK2|5.0|The acting is superb! I also enjoy the cinematography and musical score.<br />I highly recommend this series for fans of mystery series like Monk.
B00260HH3K|1.0|Really? I don't even know where to begin. The actor who portrays Goku is annoying as h*ll. He's so freaking emo and acts nothing like the Goku we know from the anime. Airbending? The Kamehameha is supposed to be an energy wave; or did I miss something.. Bulma doesn't even have blue hair, just a blue streak. Grandpa Gohan wasn't even killed the way he was in the anime. The oozaru thing? He [Goku] didn't even have a tail so there's no possible way he could've transformed in to the great ape, and eve if he could have he wasn't big enough. just a ten foot tall gorilla. And where was krillin? I could go on and on about all that is wrong with what I watched. I wish there would be a way to give it zero stars because that's all it deserves. This movie ruined my childhood. Please for the love of all things good do not buy this..
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|Lots of good graphics! Could use some better info on what the rare plants do and how to get them.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Its so captivating and i never want to stop reading. Reading this also helped me understand the movie more...noticing things i didn't see before..  Can't wait to star Catching Fire!! :)
B008Y6YCB0|3.0|Let me start this short review by saying that I am no Austen expert and, I know I'm in the tiny minority, when it comes to not caring very much about Jane Austen's period works. Pride and Prejudice, as a book and as several versions of film presentations, however, is an exception that I enjoy very much. Though I've tried to appreciate Austen, I've come to the realization that, on screen or on paper, and with the P&P exception, I find Austen's characters to be generally irritating and her stories to be hours...and... hours... of tedium. Okay, with that out of the way, re. the Emma DVD: I liked the filmography, directing, the stage settings, gorgeous colors, the locale and the moments of subtle and obvious humor, which I thought were portrayed well through acting and direction. Gwyneth Paltrow and much of the supporting cast, did fine acting jobs, in my estimation. Glad I watched Emma out of curiosity; was not sorry when it came to its end!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book was perfect. I laughed out loud and sobbed like a baby all within a few pages. This beautifully written book is a great reminder to appreciate the time we have today, for tomorrow is never promised. LOVE LOVE LOVE!!
B005HF0GKC|5.0|Totally bummed this series dropped from Prime Free viewing to pay per episode when I was only on episode 3!<br /><br />Cleverly written.  Especially the dialogue between husband and wife. Excellent character development. Entertaining series. Too bad series like these get dropped to make room for yet another unreal &#34;reality&#34; series...
B00DNO3JUI|5.0|This is a great movie. It does not have a great deal of dialogues which makes it more compelling, as the sexual content is emotionally strong without &#34;foolish&#34; verbeage. i recc'd highly
1401938906|1.0|Sorry, but this is just a bunch of hooey. I read it. I did the experiments. No results, even though I put everything into them.
B008WCP2KG|5.0|Great movie. The blu-ray disc has addition stripping scenes which is just great. Channing Tatum is hot. watch this movie.
B00EO2I6QU|5.0|There are numerous versions of F. W. Murnau's classic Dracula film in circulation but this is the best and most complete. I even have a VHS tape I held on to because it uses the original Bram Stoker \\"Dracula\\" character names on the intertitles. After Stoker's widow won a legal battle against the production company, the film was ordered destroyed. Fortunately copies were found. When the film was ultimately released, names were changed. Count Orlok for Count Dracula, Hutter for Harker and so on.<br /><br />This package includes 2 discs. Disc 1 is a fully restored version of the film using several different prints found over the ages. For the most part, the result is remarkably good. In some cases, small pieces of film were barely salvageable however. This disc has newly translated English intertitles. The film is colorized which was a common practice at the time. With scene and mood changes, colors change along with it. Most prominent is the sepia tone but we also get shades of green, blue and red as well as the B & W standard.<br /><br />Modern day film watchers will certainly chuckle at the acting, but again this was a developing art form. Actors were accustomed to overly dramatized actions, gestures and facial contortions for live theater. If you're not used to watching silent movies this will take some time to get over. There are remarkable examples of great filmmaking however that are worth noting. I was really impressed with the editing. There are situations where numerous events are taking place at the same time. Hutter escapes Orlok's castle and travels back to his home. At the same time evil Orlok is crossing the Black Sea to take residence across from Hutter's house. And institutionalized Knock is capturing flies and spiders while lovely Ellen falls under Orlok's distant spell. The cuts are well placed and nearly seamless, especially for a movie of this generation.<br /><br />Murnau shot the film in Berlin and other German towns as well as Slovakia. Set in 1838 in Bremen, the exterior shots in particular are well done. Murnau's visual style certainly influenced many to follow. Orlok's physical appearance today is also worthy of a chuckle or two but I suspect it frightened many at the time. For another take on this creepy look, you might want to watch Werner Herzog's 1978 remake \\"Nosferatu.\\" It's a bit slow but true Dracula lovers should like it.<br /><br />You can also see some of Murnau's visual style in Francis Ford Coppola's \\"Bram Stoker's Dracula\\" from 1992 which I believe is the best of all films based on Dracula. Another excellent feature in this package is the reconstructed Hans Erdmann score performed by the Saarbrucken Radio Symphony Orchestra conducted by Berndt Heller. It adds a solid foundation for the film throughout. It comes in stereo or Dolby Surround 5.1.<br /><br />The DVD package includes a second disc. Although I did not watch it from beginning to end, the only difference I could determine was that it uses the original German language intertitles which can be supplemented with subtitles. Disc 1 also includes a 52 minute documentary about Murnau with a focus on Nosferatu showing some original sets compared to how they look today. Interesting stuff. There is a short documentary on how the film restoration took place, some scene comparisons, a photo gallery and finally, excerpts from several other Murnau films. Whew! Yeah, get it.838 in Bremen, the exterior shots in particular are well done. Murnau's visual style certainly influenced many to follow.

B00AECGQF2|1.0|Would be better if the characters would talk and be more interactive. You can shave their head bald and they just ooo and ahhhh. my four year old did not play with it for more than 2 minutes. I uninstalled it
B00AA7O6QC|5.0|Explosions.  Subtle comedy.  Graphic and bloody death.  What's not to love?  Certainly not Chuck Norris!  All in all, a fun movie.  That I would definitely watch multiple times in a month.
B006LR0XLM|5.0|I love this app, I store pics, documents from work and church, and I do not have to email and transfer docs everywhere, and you can organize your folders easily!!!
B0017SWPXY|4.0|I love all animal stories but this had a twist in that the story is written by the dog. Very cute story.
B00488SU02|5.0|My husband and I have watched this movie 3 times. When we have company, and they want to watch a &#34;good&#34; movie, we suggest this one. Not because it is good, because it is great!!!!! The movie is even better because it is a true story!!!!!
B006AZZPCM|5.0|Works very well!! Needed to download some &#34;how to&#34; craft videos abd it worked veru very well. No problems here :-)
B00CL6HGIK|5.0|Mark Wahlberg's movies are always very, very good. He is so believable. His serious look is what does it. Whatever character he plays, he does an excellent job of making you &#34;feel&#34; the movie. When I rent a movie, I want to be entertained. His movies do just this. I wish he was in more. I am glad he is selective about the movies he is in. Why comprimise his professionalism. He doesn't have to. That's how good he is.
B00E3VTR1K|5.0|Nothing is quite as it seems in Galactic Energies. Very original plots, great characters, fast moving with some nice twists, truely unexpected endings. I had the same feeling every time I finished a short story: damn, it's over! Fine writing and so unusual. Finished this book in about five hours. A true literary gem. I can not wait for a full novel by Luca Rossi.
B000OVLBEY|5.0|This is a real thriller (for adults) with plenty of exciting scenes and a love story thrown in for good measure.
B002WY65VU|5.0|My favorite zombie movie!  It was funny and entertaining.  It's more humor than horror.  I was dragged to see it the first time but couldn't wait to buy it on DVD.
B0064W667Y|5.0|I came in expecting a carbon-copy of ABC's &#34;Once Upon A Time.&#34;  I got a great, richly layered, complex story of a murder, and the ensuing detective work that followed.<br /><br />This is an incredible read and I will be buying the rest of the Fables trades.
B00AS1Q8FW|5.0|Say what you will about Tom but he nailed this part. Laid back bad ass attitude and smart detective work makes this flick a great popcorn night time watch. I bought it and I'm sure I will watch it again.
B0060ZJ7BC|5.0|A great movie - being an A's fan (1979) and season ticket holder from 1985 -2007 (my husband passed on in '08) it was thrilling to see a movie that I felt I was a part of being a fan and Season ticket holder during that period - was there counting the number of wins along with other fans and was there on the day they broke the all time record. The actors were so believable and were so well picked for the movie especially Bradd Pitt - I had to keep reminding myself that it wasn't Billy Beane he was believalbe in looks and in mannerisms - I saw Billy Beane and spoke to him. This movie was so very enlightening to me as well - why stealing basis was out, etc.  for me it is more than a movie - it was so much more - all in all was a one great movie so  happy I have it in my collection.
B00DC7N9NS|3.0|If this movie cost a lot to make, it's a shame. Plot was predictable, acting was just okay. No real comedy, no real drama, it was okay to watch, but I'm glad I didn't buy it
B00CW6DAKC|3.0|after update lost everything.  and the whole facebook connect issue ..you have to delete the facebook app in order to connect via kindle browser. makes sense lolol
B0013N7AD8|4.0|Both of Keaton's films are good for the time. Nothing overly special about them, but they're are unique in their own right. And as much as I like Carrey as the Riddler and Schwarzenegger as Mr. Freeze, both Batman & Robin and Batman Forever are bad films. There's very little about either film that even a extreme Batman fan could enjoy.
B002S43V3Y|5.0|Great movie. Each time I watch I am reminded how much I enjoy it. It's about trying to find love and how this love sometimes comes in unexpected ways. The sound track of Cat Steven songs only adds to this thought provoking movie.
B009JBZH54|5.0|Stemming far from the comics, and taking a more realistic look at the World's Greatest Detective; these films pit a weak Bruce conjuring a egotistical legend of the night. The stories are tight, and well-written. Other than realism aspect, the films do very little for the Batman world. They're not bad films, they're just not true to the mythos. But how Nolan portrays it all, you accept it as an audience.
B004W1GCNC|5.0|Just a good story, enjoyed the characters.  Good story about troubling times for the British Isles, how they reacted to the events that lead to WWII..
B0036S4B6M|4.0|After watching a couple of episodes, I thought the story was going to me more vignettes about life with and between fellow inmates. But this takes inside of Piper's head. She may have been born with a silver spoon in her mouth, but she is adept at navigating the tenuous relationships with her inmates and earns their respect and respect for herself. What a great read.. and i could relate to her plight. We all have our own prisons in life. Kudos to Piper.
B0088W7VNG|5.0|One of the best shows I've ever seen. A cast of characters that you can't help but love. Twist and unexpected turns that keep you guessing.
B0055SWM08|3.0|an ok game for me but kinda entertaining once u play some more.  I whatever this guy Sufis man I iiiiiiiiiiiii88eeeeehehrhrururyrh
B008FRFN7A|5.0|I don't have to download from phone to laptop to print and neither does my husband! That proves it is easy.
B0002KQNJU|4.0|There is neither horror nor more than the slightest degree of suspense common to comedy vampire movies. Roman Polanski does get to show his talent both as actor and Director in this satire on the subject. A talented cast makes the most of the script which is more chuckle-full than laugh out loud. It is much in the tradition of Bob Hopes two efforts with the wonderful Paulette Goddard save that the ghosts/vampires/zombies are real, movie-real. that is. At the current Amazon Prime price for the DVD it will provide a pleasant though not WOW couple of hours ( and, similarly, for other low cost methods for watching it).<br />I enjoyed it and recommend it to those in the general audience. The reaction of devotees of the horror genre I cannot predict.
B00873GRU4|5.0|Not my usual genre of book but really enjoyed it- looking forward to reading the next book in the Wool trilogy .
B0067Q42BY|4.0|If you enjoy Mahjong this app/game is for you! I just started playing yesterday and it is the best I have played. Not only great graphics (Kindle Fire HD) - truly challenging and fun. Looking forward to advancing to the various levels. I'm not a &quot;video gamer&quot; yet I find Mahjong the best way to pass the time in a waiting room.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is one of my best games I can not stop playing it it's probably my favorite game!<br />I love this game you should get it for younger kids it an awesome game!!!!!
B00AYB0TOW|3.0|Wasn't bad but kind of a let down on how not futuristic is was weapons were cool but the first one was cooler with robots and cloning this one just didn't have that pawnaush
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|This game is just one of my favorites because it makes you think of what you are doing just great
B00CH26TL8|1.0|I tried twice and got an error message, this is the only place it even shows I tried to get it.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is AWESOME it's so fun you can run around as a minion and you can dress them up in costumes. I'm just wondering will there be a purple minion costume? I don't know but I recommend this game to those who read this!!!!!!
B0076DCT2G|3.0|Was very disappointed as  I had been waiting for his next book. Little story between history and boring Corey's so called funny quips with the understanding he is suppose to be so smart he has to fool others.  Story similar to &#34;Lion&#34; except different scenery.
0785163174|3.0|Good story, but hard cover is too expensive.  Publish needs to start offering graphic novels as soft covers and drop the price.
B0001KL5DA|1.0|First disc skipped over parts several times during both episodes.<br />Second disc won't even play at all.<br />And of course it's passed the return date because I didn't get to watching the second season until now.<br />Do not buy from this company. Buy new. I know I will next time.
B00785P2QC|3.0|Fun game but frustrating that G5 wants your money. Having to post on social networks is also frustrating. I would give it a higher rating except for what I mentioned.
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|My daughter got me hooked on this show!  I remember watching Dr. Who in the late 70's with my dad, so a great family show.
B000IZXR20|4.0|It Felt a bit rushed at the end, but certainly enjoyable to watch.  I wished the main characters had more backstory. We never get emotionally invested in them.
B00AFQC4QC|5.0|This epic tale covers the period from the 1930s to the end of World War Two and is initially centred in Bratislava in Czechoslovakia and on a romance between Greta, a Jewish woman who is something of a bookworm, and Wilhelm, a German bookshop assistant.  When Greta falls pregnant, they get married, and then the perspective of the story changes. It is no longer a love affair viewed against a historical background of cataclysmic world events, but becomes the intricate recording of the fate and fortune of the various members of two extended families, the Weissensteiner and the Winkelmeier families, during the course of the tragic unfolding of the horrors of the Sudetenland problem , Jewish pogroms, and the ebb and flow of war. We are witness to the break-up of marriages and families, and the blind throw of the dice in whether individuals attain survival or extinction. From small beginnings the novel extends into a vast canvas. The author keeps a firm grip on the multifarious characters and events of a novel that can only be termed epic, and we are intimately involved in discovering what happens to each and every individual amidst those momentous events. Check it out.
B004SH40BQ|1.0|I bought this to play my iPod classic through the car stereo via Bluetooth, rather than the media cable, as I prefer to control the iPod directly rather that control it through the stereo, changing songs and artists is much faster on the iPod itself. My car stereo would find it, but it would not pair with it properly, so unfortunately I had to return it.
0307341550|3.0|I read this with less pleasure than I read &#34;Gone Girl&#34; and &#34;Dark Places,&#34; with which it shares a gothic sensibility.  But Flynn's first effort is less skillfully narrated than were her two later novels.
B00A8FXT8M|5.0|It is extremely well constructed and easy to read. You sympathise with the accused and hope that she will escape somehow. A dark tale in a land and at a time as alien to us as those in fantasy fiction - yet this is based on a true story.
0307341577|5.0|I read this with the same degree of taught pleasure as I read &#34;Gone Girl.&#34;  Skilfully narrated by multiple narrators, this novel never stops surprising the reader.  All is brought together deftly in the conclusion.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|Very good! Can't wait to read the second volume. Well written.  A lot of characters to keep track of but well worth the effort!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|love this game. its so challenging . if you love puzzles get this app. cant wait to get threw the next door
0812982622|4.0|It was difficult to read and know that life in North Korea is like this.  A must for everyone to read.
B00821OX98|4.0|Not a bad way to spend a rainy weekend, or nights when you are bored. Gets a little over the top, as would be expected, but good overall.
B0075PZ2ZG|3.0|Nice and hard , but just not for me... I guess if I listen to it enough, it'll grow on me.

1455526959|5.0|I love books by Michael Connelly. I have read all his books but this one which I am just about finished with. It is his Harry Bosch character  which is so enjoyable. If you like Michael Connelly, you will love this book.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|I would recommend this book to one and all. It crosses all age groups. It has a beautiful message. I really enjoyed the many quotes, both at the first of the chapters and within the story itself.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I got to level 4 in about 10 mins on my first run. My 6 year old took a lot longer but still managed to figure it out. Fun!
0312641893|5.0|I loved the characters - each and every one of them beginning with Cinder, a young woman who is so injured in an accident that she is labelled as a cyborg because of her mechanical parts.<br /><br />Speaking of mechanics, she's a mechanic, too.  And, she has a horrible stepmother (guardian) and two sisters, just as in the story of Cindarella.  Her prince does indeed fall in love with her but how can she compete with the beauties of the country?  If I were to say more I'd give away too much of the story.  My best advice is to grab a copy and read it for yourself.  It's unique, creative and a darn good yarn.
B005D9MUWY|4.0|SwiftKey will change the way you type. It has me typing words instead of letters, guessing what I'm going to say next with great accuracy. The guesses were a little off  in the beginning,  but it learns pretty quickly. Highly Recommend.
140006922X|5.0|I chose the highest rating because I felt this book was well researched, unbiased, and insightful.  The effort in bringing to the foreground historical evidence and substance of Jesus the man himself is elucidating and admirable  I would recommend this book to all who wish to have a deeper understanding of the seeds of Christianity and the connection Christianity has with its Jewish mother church.  Specifically, I would recommend this book to clergy of all faiths worldwide.
B00005JKZV|2.0|Sorry....this set made me feel like I watched a year of the same stuff....storyline is like vapor trails of a jet; who are the critics that rave about this series?
B004JNB4UO|3.0|There is no question that MacArthur was brilliant in many ways, both positive and negative but the real grit was missing from this movie. Some of his military decisions were amazing but the holes in how he dealt with the Korean situation were dark and deep that only his personality quirks could explain. Truman, as President, was also the right man in the right place at the right time. However, the personalities couldn't have been more poorly matched.
B000E5N6LG|5.0|Tombstone, the movie, got the audience but this version is just as good.  They are not copies of each other.  This one really takes a closer look at the man, Wyatt Earp.  A tad too long in the last half of the movie was probably the reason it didn't quite match up in viewers' eyes...but still a great movie.
0375851569|5.0|It was nice to see that the discount on these books were so big that even though I had to pay the shipping to Thailand it was worth it. I still did not go over the original price.<br />Both me and my husband enjoy reading the books to our 7 months old son. Fox in Socks became part of the night ritual.
B003YOZNBU|2.0|Storyline matches the actors...basically in the mediocre group.  Just another lower budget modern western.  Get this if you are bored and already have the good ones out there...pass otherwise

B0001MDP3G|5.0|A great story line of a young woman whose beau leaves for the war.  It chronicles her misadventures and good times in trying to make a go while lawless characters run havoc over the innocents.  This is a must movie!
B004QL7K6G|5.0|Why wasn't this movie advertised?  It is HILLARIOUS!!!<br /><br />I picked this film up on a whim, never having heard of it before.  However, it has 2 big names in it:  Jennifer Anniston and Paul Rudd, so I figured, how bad can it be?  Well, it wasn't bad at all.  It was FANTASTIC!<br /><br />In the movie (which is funny right from the start, by the way) Jennifer Anniston (Linda) and Paul Rudd (George) are a married urban couple living in a \\"micro-loft\\" in New York.  But when George loses his job and Linda's ultra-serious documentary about penguins is rejected by HBO, they decide to high-tail it out of NY and go live with George's wife and brother down south, until they figure out what they should do.<br /><br />It's a long drive to the brother's house, so George and Linda decide to stop along the way at a bed and breakfast called Elysium.  Only, SURPRISE!! This is no ordinary bed and breakfast.....it's really a modern day hippie commune!  (One clue that this is not your typical \\"B & B\\" is the totally naked guy they meet on the pathway to the hotel).<br /><br />Due to recent hardships in their lives, the experimental community - despite it's lack of privacy and philosophy of \\"what's yours is mine\\" - has appeal to George and Linda.  Soon they find themselves embracing the bohemian life style - well, Linda a bit more than George, since she suddenly has a crush on the very charismatic guru guy named Seth.<br /><br />Their marriage is challenged...temptations arise....and many quirky kooky characters are met (including Alan Alda, who is the patriarch of this weird hippie hotel).  Most importantly, there are plenty of laughs along the way....which never stop!  You know how some movies start out really funny, then they kind of \\"lose it?\\"  Well, this movie retains the same high level of humor throughout.  I was never bored....I never felt like the movie \\"dragged.\\"<br /><br />Bottom line?  I laughed.  Out loud!  Would this movie win any awards?  Probably not, but so what.  I was entertained.  I highly suggest this movie to anyone who just enjoys silly comedies about adults (not teenagers), such as Zoolander or 40 Year Old Virgin.  WARNING:  As you probably figured out by the cover (and the R rating) this movie is NOT for young children!  Watch after the kids are in bed, so they won't come into the room and \\"see\\" things you need to explain!  There is some full frontal nudity.....but the movie is never trashy.  Just funny!  Watch it!  You'll laugh, I promise you that!  I also recommend buying this movie, since you'll probably want to watch it again.I was entertained.

B0095ZQ36G|5.0|I absolutely loved, loved, loved this book, for so many reasons. First, it's a fast and suspenseful read. I had a hard time putting it down. Second, the author is a good writer. I know nothing about airplanes (and previously did not find them all that interesting), but the author describes them in layman's terms - to the point where I now feel as though I could identify some WWII aircraft, just from his descriptions. He also does a good job describing the somewhat large cast of characters. Finally, this book puts a decent face on what I perceived as the faceless Nazi Air Force. I had no idea that many Luftwaffe pilots were not members of the Nazi Party. In general, I had assumed that the majority of the German military were Hitler-worshipping fascists, but I learned that this was never the case. Many high-ranking members of the Luftwaffe were decent, anti-Party men who knew the war was over long before they were able to surrender. And of course, the main German character in this book, Franz Stigler, was a man of courage and integrity.<br /><br />The book starts by following Franz's life, and then we are introduced to Charlie Brown, the American bomber pilot who silently interacted with Franz. The lead-up to their meeting in the skies over Germany was among the more suspenseful book scenes I've ever read. It was almost hard to read, since the men were forced to face unimaginable horrors.<br /><br />(Note: This is sort of a spoiler alert - but not really, since we know the two lived through the war from the book's foreword.) The reunion of the two men late in the book made me cry. Their search for each other and their eventual meet-up was really stirring.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book. One note: There aren't too many pictures in this book, but I did find them too small on the Kindle. However, a quick Google image search will net you most of the pictures anyway, so this did not detract from the book.<br /><br />Review follow-up: After writing this review, I read several other reviews that claimed the book whitewashed history to paint the German Air Force in a better light. This is probably somewhat true, since the book only followed a select few members of the Luftwaffe without speaking much at all about the war crimes committed by this branch of the German military. There are also few mentions of war crimes committed by the Allies. This book is definitely not meant to be an exhaustive and detailed account of the Luftwaffe or the American Air Force during WWII. It is an in-depth look at the the actions of two men, a German and an American, during the war. And I stand by my assertion that this book did give me a new perspective on members of the German military during the war. Not all of them were bad. Not all of them were Nazis. Many of them were just kids who believed they were fighting for their country and feared the Nazi Party. I think there is still value in a story about two young pilots and the daily fears they faced during the war.ead several other reviews that claimed the book whitewashed history to paint the German Air Force in a better light.

B0062NAX1U|5.0|Fun, engaging, great story, great characters. A little preachy at times for non-believers, but well worth the time.<br />A movie that lifts up not just fathers but the institution of fatherhood, teaching why fathers are critical for children, and preaching how fathers can get re-engaged.

B00CLD65X0|5.0|We LOVED the series.  We watched all three season in 2 weeks.  Its was our &#34;go to&#34; when there is nothing on the current rotation of television...and that is OFTEN.<br /><br />I cant wait for season 4!
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|Another great story by Jodi Picoult. Emotional event between two close families.  Hard to put down! Parents can relate to all sides.
B0058OUJA4|3.0|There are better defense games out there, or at least ones that I have enjoyed more. Overall it is not bad.
B003P2WJ6S|5.0|A truly informative and moving story, which was well crafted. The scientific part of the story was quite well explained. It would have been wonderful if the Lacks' family had received financial assistance or at the very least much needed health care.
0061777269|5.0|Pim van Lommel provides a highly scientific study of NDE. As a longtime cardiologist he has weighty credentials to look deeply into the subject. His conclusions are based on empirical observation. They are clearly stated. This book includes findings of a few other high-level studies on topic as well. It isn't light reading; but perhaps because of this it provides considerable &#34;light.&#34; Two thumbs way up.
B00DLKXF3A|4.0|While other reviewers are correct in pointing out that Hail to the King sounds a lot like 90's metal, they are incorrect in characterizing the entire album as unoriginal, a \\"copycat,\\" or a \\"ripoff\\" of Metallica's [[ASIN:B00AH69ZN0 Metallica]] (The Black Album). On the contrary, Hail to the King is well balanced; it borrows ideas and pays homage to the band's influences, but it still maintains its own originality. Most importantly, Hail to the King still sounds like an Avenged Sevenfold record: hard, catchy, and fun.<br /><br />Although Hail to the King does not seem to me to have any clear overall concept, there are recurring themes on the album. \\"Shepherd of Fire\\" and the title track contain similar lyrical content, and while both are slower than typical A7X fare, they still find it in them to be heavy and powerful. In particular, \\"Shepherd of Fire\\" stands out with its pounding double-bass drums (reminiscent of Megadeth's \\"Trust\\"), chugging guitars, and single-worthy chorus.<br /><br />\\"Planets\\" and \\"Acid Rain\\" could presumably be sister songs as well; each of these tracks seems to be about a different aspect of the apocalypse. \\"Planets\\" is about humanity's impending doom and the actual destruction of the Earth, and the music reflects the horror of the subject matter. Zacky and Syn's guitars alternate between deep rhythmatic riffs and wild harmonies. The solos are perfect, the drums are big, and traditional A7X orchestral arrangements underlie everything else. There is so much going on in \\"Planets\\" I am still finding new sounds to get excited about twenty-five listens later.<br /><br />Its counterpart, \\"Acid Rain,\\" is far mellower. Piano, violins, and another orchestral arrangement set the stage for Syn to blaze away with a series of very bluesy licks. Lyrically, \\"Acid Rain\\" seems to be about accepting one's fate (the destruction laid out in \\"Planets\\") and greeting death with head held high. Upon first listening to \\"Acid Rain\\" I was blown away by its beauty. It seems like on every record Avenged Sevenfold brings something new and experimental to the table (think \\"Strength of the World,\\" \\"Dear God,\\" \\"Fiction,\\" etc.), and Hail to the King is no exception- \\"Acid Rain\\" is the last thing in the world I expected to hear on an Avenged Sevenfold record, but I mean that in the very best, pleasantly-surprised way possible. (As an aside, \\"Planets\\" and \\"Acid Rain\\" remind me of the movie [[ASIN:B007JRTV52 Melancholia]] to such a degree that I would not be surprised to learn they were written about the film.)<br /><br />Unfortunately, there are a couple of duds too. \\"Doing Time\\" sounds similar to the leftovers we heard on [[ASIN:B003EXY1WS Live In The LBC & Diamonds In The Rough]] with its simplistic riffs and bland lyrics, and \\"Crimson Day\\" can join other overrated (albeit not awful) A7X ballads like \\"Seize the Day\\" and \\"Gunslinger\\" in the gutter. \\"This Means War\\" seems to have ruffled a lot of feathers among fans for its alleged similarity to the Metallica song \\"Sad But True,\\" but I actually really dig it despite any resemblance it might have to Black Album material. Its successor, \\"Requiem,\\" would have been right at home on [[ASIN:B000V6BE6C Avenged Sevenfold]] with its pounding, deliberate riffs and fierce chorus. So, too, \\"Heretic\\" impresses with a classical-sounding intro and a very [[ASIN:B000TGZQXG Youthanasia]]-era Megadeth feel to it. \\"Coming Home\\" did not do much for me at first, but it has begun to grow on me after a few listens. Much like \\"Shepherd of Fire,\\" it also seems to be lyrically related to \\"Hail to the King.\\"<br /><br />The other good:<br />Production on Hail to the King is absolutely top-notch. I have been playing it through an ancient sound system with Bose speakers, and it sounds nothing short of amazing. I can pick out every individual instrument, bass included, and they all sound really sharp. Enough praise cannot be said of the mixing on Hail to the King, especially given recent production disasters like Metallica's [[ASIN:B00192KCQ0 Death Magnetic]]. I am also impressed with the songwriting. In recent years Avenged has sometimes fallen into a routine with their song structures, but both [[ASIN:B003VDZK8K Nightmare]] and Hail to the King have enough tracks that break the mold to satisfy.<br /><br />The other bad:<br />I expected a drop-off in drumming quality on this album given it is the first one on which The Rev did not write the drum tracks, but I figured it would be because the new guy was not up to snuff. As far as I can tell, new kit-man Aren Ilejay can play with the best of them and even write some interesting fills (not to mention his kit sounds super sharp throughout the album). He is no Rev in the fill department, but then who is? Where the drumming drops in quality is in the number of opportunities Ilejay has to show his chops. Many of the tracks simply are not fast enough for him to let loose and still play something that serves the song. There is no \\"Burn it Down,\\" no \\"Chapter Four.\\" I don't know if the rest of the band intentionally handcuffed Ilejay by writing slower material in an attempt to keep him from outshining The Rev (that was, after all, part of the reason they decided to continue without Portnoy), but I cannot help but be a little disappointed with his overall performance. Again, it is not necessarily the dude's fault, and we have all been spoiled for a long time listening to The Rev, but it is still noticeable.<br /><br />Really, all you have to ask yourself if you are thinking about buying this album is \\"do I like Avenged Sevenfold?\\" If the answer is yes, then do it. We are not dealing with a major departure from their recent form, nor are the accusations of plagiarism and unoriginality true in the least. There is a definite 90's metal influence present on Hail to the King, but as far as I am concerned that is a good, good thing. \\"Planets\\" and \\"Acid Rain\\" are almost worth the price of the album all by themselves, and there are other gems besides those two tracks. You know what to do, reader.ca's [[ASIN:B00192KCQ0 Death Magnetic]]. I am also impressed with the songwriting.

B0063M22QO|4.0|I enjoy the game<br />Makes for relaxation.<br />I would recomend it to people who need to do things with both hands...stimulates the brain and helps from getting old.
B0000AUHPB|3.0|I liked the movie.  I liked the subtle british humor, but found the movie to be a little slow. I prefer the remake as this version tends to show all the members to be somewhat idiots, whereas the remake they are all experts in their own field. Remake was much better.
B003SNKBXW|4.0|I decided to read this book because I really enjoyed the movie. The two were very dissimilar but that is ok. My complaint about the nook is that at times it got a bit convoluted. I read the kindle fire HD version and the translation was horrible. Misspelled words and poor punctuation, or lack thereof ran amuck
B00B2V66VS|4.0|Really easy to use finger swipe game. No reading for those not that great at it yet and maybe even need some practice with screen swiping.
B00013RC66|5.0|Excellent thriller! It kept me trying to guess what would happen next.<br />Great script and great acting!<br />Leading actors exceeded my expectations.
B0069G5Z9K|4.0|Like that you have the option to upgrade for more awesomeness. The game it's self is slightly challenging. Just a flying fun way to pass the time.
1609611543|2.0|\\"I am the wisdom and the light! All who disagree with me are sent by Satan to lead you astray!\\"<br /><br />Yet another well-meaning fad taken to heart by people desperately seeking a panacea to make their lives better.<br /><br />Yes, he makes a good case about how engineered our food has become, but that applies to almost everything we eat. Do we stop eating oats? Tomatoes? Eggs? Meat? Milk and butter? Production of all of these foods, and in many cases the foods themselves, have been significantly altered in the past 100 years to be more market-friendly.  Like everything else, food has become a business, and unless you have the space and ability to grow your own, this is the world we live in. Moderation is the key. Too much of anything is bad, but he seems to say eat all the fat and sugar you want. Well, the cheapness and availability of high-fructose corn syrup has led to it's incorporation into thousands of foods, and that increased sugar intake is a huge factor in our obesity and diabetes rates. Too much fat can lead to heart disease - no, wait, he says that's not true. Who do you believe?<br /><br />His arrogance in dismissing \\"gluten-free junk\\" especially rankles, as my husband is celiac and going GF has greatly improved his life. No one has the one right answer for everyone.<br /><br />Sure, you can lose weight by losing wheat, because a lot of the alternatives are lower carb. I lost 110 lbs over a year by dramatically reducing carbs and sugar intake, but I still ate whole wheat.<br /><br />Some of his science is probably spot on, but it gets lost in the pulpit-pounding and self-aggrandizement. There's a lot of information out there, and I find this book doesn't add a lot of value to the discussion.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This is a fun app. I like doing the competitions. people should get it because it is fun. Have fun
B008673ZAQ|4.0|MR. cross saved this novel for me. His love and willingness to protect Eva from her past and that scoundrel Nathan had me loving him more and more.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|The schoolastic, scientific objectivity I look for in an evaluation of the history of my faith.  I enjoyed it thoroughly, an specificly appreciated having it on my Kindle where I could easily cross reference cited passages on my e-Bible.  Reza Aslan is a brilliant, objective historian and conveys that in this book.
B00EE3FVSU|5.0|This is a wonderful BBC mystery series.  The acting and writing are brilliant and keep you guessing.  It is a treat to watch each episode.
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|Its a good quick real.  Well written, delightful tale of an unfortunate situation with romance.  Well done John Green.  DFTBA
B0036BK6MW|5.0|I love true stories and this one is one of the best.  I recommend it to everyone.  I believe the film is well-done and the actors are believable - perfect for the parts.
B008K9SG9K|5.0|I bought this album really, to just Blast \\"Radioactive\\" in my car... oh and \\"Demons\\" is also a great song. But all the other songs are great.
B00BEZTMQ8|5.0|What can be said what has been said before. J.R.R Tolkien and Peter Jackson. A perfect combination. I have to save more $$$ for the future purchases of remaining &#34;The Hobbit&#34; Titles to complete the J.R.R Tolkien/ Peter Jackson Collection on Blu Ray. 'Nuff said!
B00EY8A6BC|5.0|I rented this movie last night watched it with the whole family, The quality of the movie far surpassed my expectations and the acting was wonderful, The story line was interesting and easy to follow all the way through to the end, and the best part about the whole thing was there weren't any really slow boring parts.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|My wife read this book first with her book club and liked it so much she recommended it to me.  Man am I glad she did.  There has already been a lot of comprehensive reviews here, so I won't go into depth...  Just stop reading the reviews and buy this story and find out for yourself.
B00CDT41RY|4.0|Tarantino did not disappoint. Classic sudden kill scenes, quote worthy monologues, and what would a Tarantino film be without the random campy B-movie vibe thrown in? It's all included. Watch it now!
B00E6D4HHO|5.0|This Box set is amazing to most X-Men film lovers. This box set does indeed includes an empty slot for Days of Future Past. It even includes a behind the scenes interview with many of the Actors from the series. Yes I know that all this is stated on the info page, but from all the negative reviews, it seems like people don't read that page.
B00AYB0TOW|5.0|This movie was great!!!!!  I wish I had seen it in the movie theater.  This movie is very true to the comic book.  This Dredd lives and loves his job as a justice.  He never removes his mask throughout the film(unlike the 1990's film).  Plenty of action and very good plot.  This movie is very enjoyable from beginning to end.  If you want a great movie to see Dredd!!!!!
0345803493|5.0|This series is very good. This book was a tad bit boring but overall worth the read! Can't wait for movie
B0039YZPZ4|5.0|An excellent plot and plenty of action what more can you ask for? The acting cast does an excellent job and bring the film to life.  Good film to watch.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|This game is very fun. Be careful because its very addicting and you will lose track of time very quickly.
B002RSDW80|5.0|I could watch this movie over and over again.  Inspired me to buy the real cook book of Julia Childs.
0345803507|5.0|Love this series! This book was very good, wasn't a big fan of the beginning but overall love the series.
B004RKSAU6|5.0|The movie Julie & Julia inspired me to buy the real cook book and am glad I did.  It's great.
B00CF34B2I|5.0|I had no problems downloading this app. Even upgraded to the full version. I've found the program very responsive. The Campaign has been challenging but do-able.
B0083H6AQA|2.0|I expected more from Robert Pattinson.  He is just a male prostitute in it.  Not a good movie at all.
1451626088|5.0|I have loved many of PG's books and her talent with historical fiction.  I felt like there was a bit of a lull for a time with her books (partly because of the time period she was writing about) but this book did not disappoint.  It was interesting and engaging.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I LOVE the idea of MINION RUSH . Please make another Despicable Me game and make a MINION dress up game so my daughter can dress MINIONS.
159463176X|5.0|I thought the message and the format of this book was fantastic.  I loved it.  This author is truly gifted.
1442444053|4.0|This is a review of the very large, very heavy Scribner Classics hardcover edition, with the brown cover and gold type. You may want to buy this edition (as I did) because you think this is a classic worth passing along to your children. Is it worth it? As mentioned, it's VERY LARGE and VERY HEAVY. You or your child must have strong hands or a sturdy lap for comfortable reading. The illustrations are very colorful, beautiful, and detailed (although I thought the facial expressions could be better, since the rabbits' personalities are so important to the story).<br /><br />Where the publisher dropped the ball, in my opinion, is in the cover. They could have given this a classic cloth cover which would last for generations. Instead they used some kind of plastic-cardboard amalgam (that is just my guess-- I have no idea what the material really is) with the type printed right on it, and no dust jacket. It guess it's nice that you can print with such fine detail right on the cover these days. But I read the book a few months after buying it, and the cover already has an odd feel to it, not quite sticky, just strange. I am guessing that years from now, it will have a sticky feeling like old plastic sometimes gets.<br /><br />As far as the story: it is as wonderful as I remember from my own childhood, and I do look forward to my daughter reading it. I hope the expensive edition I bought holds up well.
B006LSZECO|2.0|I read about half of this book and honestly I put it down and have not finished it. I will wait for the movie which I can only hope is not as winy and slow as this book.
B002O2THVA|4.0|Classic movie. One of the few John Wayne movies that I've seen where he isn't the central character. He is important to the movie just not the main character. Top name actors give a fine performance.
B00821OX98|5.0|The story lines are great, the character development is awesome, and they even try to keep realistic situations for survival-like food, ammunition and gasoline.  There is no bottomless pit when shooting weapons, and in foods.  Even though the situation is Science Fiction, they have to deal with medicines, food, etc.  It is a really good show.  Must see.
B00280LYIC|5.0|I really like this book. This is one of my favorit books, you might like it. You should give it a try!!!!
B005544TRQ|5.0|What Would Harvey Do? Is my Mantra, In a time when TV will really roy your brain. This show will at least make you use it.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is so cool and so realistic its just awesome because u can groom them ride them and so much more. I love horses
B00DP3IGJ6|4.0|Im not gonna like this movie was kinda confusing at first so i had to watch it twice but overall its a good movie to watch in a high graphic tv
B00D5O7BPU|5.0|Great game really realistic. Loved it allot. Can't wait for more guns. Will patiently waiting. I am goin to play more now.
B00E5Q1HJS|5.0|You are gonna be mind blown. A MUST buy movie for nerds and non-nerds alike. Just  a great movie to see
B009DCOU9S|3.0|I found this app, like many others pointed out dialogs are really long. Not terrible but my device went asleep while them (they were That long). Also it is not as responsive at locating interactive objects, so it may take more than a few tries even when you have found the correct solution.<br />I wonder if they paid Hollywood stars for using their images for the characters...  And the finale was underwhelming... The story builds up but it leads nowhere.<br />Overall is an okay application., clearly not the beat from its type but good enough to spend a few hours. I strongly believe it is not worth almost 3 USA, I would pay not more than 1.50 and gladly I grabbed as a FAOTD.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|If you are into Sci Fi, will love it, still is worth seeing it,HD viewing is a must to enjoy all the details.
B0081JPTCQ|5.0|A lot of people say that this app has privacy issues, but it works great for me. I love it!
B002HFWAWW|5.0|I love this movie and the blu-ray is outstanding. Great picture, outstanding audio, a few extras. This is the version to get avoid the echo-bridge version at all cost.
B006HTUZ1C|4.0|Fun. Addictive. Not overly involved. The perfect time waster. The game has saved me from many a boring waiting room situation.
B00EQ0CKRQ|5.0|This game is fun but I'm very disappointed in the matchmaking in multiplayer.  You get cars ranked in the 1000+ coming in to race the little guys. No way to beat them unless they just quit or wreck a lot.
B00E1L9N8E|5.0|I loved the 1920's period.  The movie was right on target with costumes.  I really enjoyed the music and the actors!
B004T4LUPW|5.0|Love my Calengoo!! I was able to get it as a free app in the Amazon app store. I use the Task List for a To Do List for works. Comes in really handy.
B006FO3ERQ|3.0|The author starts out with a strong, compelling story. However, the narrative drags in the latter half and the reader learns little about the later adolescent years of the narrator and even less about his working years and how these were affected by his childhood. Also, the end is very unsatisfying.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Downton Abbey is a great drama with twists and turns that keep you guessing.  Especially love the part Maggie Smith plays as &#34;Granny.&#34;
B008PQ8XZK|5.0|The secret keeper is a very entertaining book; I have read it 2 times because every time I find new things. It is amazing the ability of Kate Morton to knit an intrigue and to take you through it bit by bit. She takes you to the time and place of the story and you feel as if you are living the experience of war and mistery.
B007SYWFRM|1.0|I wanted this game so<br />My mom got me this game and it was not fun at all.All you do is make a village
B005KJJ4F8|5.0|Awesome book. I don't read a lot because it's hard to find one that I like but I couldn't stop reading this. It has you wondering what's going to happen next.If you like science fiction you will love this.
B004XZR63M|5.0|Rich Dad Poor Dad is probably one of the most inspiring business texts ever written. The book truly encourages you to examine your current financial situation and make positive change. Robert has built an incredible business and is one of the most highly regarded financial educators on the planet.<br /><br />This book was my inspiration for starting my latest business venture in Myanmar. My desire to not have a job was fueled by reading Rich Dad Poor  Dad.<br /><br />A great read for one and all.<br /><br />I give Robert a 5 star rating.

0812982622|4.0|4 1/2 stars<br /><br />I only took this book on to read because my book club chose it, over<br />many members' objections.  I've read far too many books about extreme<br />political repression, state terror, and torture, including 1984, The<br />Gulag Archipelago, The Wild Swans, and perhaps most appropriately,<br />Darkness at Noon.  I had no wish to read another.  I've read lots of news<br />articles about North Korea, especially around the time of their<br />intense famine, and talked to people who've gone there as tourists, so<br />I already knew that it's a psychotic terrorland.  The whole country is a<br />prison, and then there are vast labor prisons and torture prisons<br />within that.  I couldn't imagine how or why a book about this became a<br />bestseller and summer beach book.<br /><br />But torture is not the point of this book.  The author explores what<br />identity becomes, under the most vile circumstances of horror and<br />uncertainty, and how it warps relationships and intimacy.<br /><br />There are three main characters who further the story: Jun Do, the<br />everyman who lives several disparate lives so that the author can show<br />us various aspects of North Korea through one set of eyes, a<br />professional torturer who lives to write never-to-be-read biographies<br />of his victims, and Sun Moon, the dictator's favorite actress.  Then<br />there is the smarmy, unctuous, relentlessly cheerful voice of the radio propaganda version of the story.<br /><br />I've spoken with people who grew up in the Cold War Soviet Union, and<br />they claim they never really believed in what was being pushed on them<br />-- that they knew the government was lying to them and denying them<br />freedom in all areas of their lives.  In North Korea it isn't safe to<br />disbelieve, even slightly, I think, in the deepest recesses of one's<br />mind.<br /><br />Despite my alienation from the book, I found it a compelling read, and<br />took my time, savoring the remarkably different voices and tones<br />within it, and appreciating the author's achievement.  I can't exactly<br />recommend it, but if you want to read this kind of book, it's<br />certainly brilliantly done, and should live long with the books I mentioned<br />at the beginning of this review.  The physical torture does not make up the<br />bulk of the book.  In an interview appended to my edition the author<br />says he had to soften up some of the horrors routinely inflicted on<br />prisoners.  It simply doesn't do to dwell too much on what this book<br />reveals about human nature.t's certainly brilliantly done, and should live long with the books I mentioned at the beginning of this review.

0425263916|5.0|I hadn't read a book like this before, from the very first page I was hooked!  If you want a fast read, and a very good one, pick this book next.  I have friends waiting in line to read it, and my husband loved the effects!
B00A0NOF7G|2.0|I'm sorry but I do not like this book. The story didn't catch my interest and I found the characters very stereotypical and... dull... Even the hunk!! It's not fun to submit a bad review but I guess somebody's got to do it...
B00873GRU4|3.0|A fairly ordinary read. I love post apocalypse books but this did read like a new episode of 'Fallout' the video game.<br />I did enjoy the setting (hundred of years living in the silos) and some of the ideas were engaging but the writing was just not great.
B000OLGCI4|5.0|LOVE this movie!!  A childhood favorite and now I own it.  Just waiting for a nice rainy day to watch it.
B00ABLJ5NQ|3.0|Short, entertaining and rather sweet.  this is the first Neil Gaiman i have read. I  probably wouldn't read another based on this book.<br />I think it would be enjoyed by the Harry potter set.
B00CHI5B7A|4.0|My only issue was the film is very dark setting, which caused me issues actually seeing to movie.<br /><br />Imagine the Dick Tracy, crossed with Oceans 11-13, and Lethal Weapon, and that is this movie.<br /><br />But amp up.the violence also.
B0049J0CTM|5.0|Classic family friendly movie with good family values. Enjoyable for all ages. Emphasis on positive thinking, perseverance, and love of family and friends.
B000SEGMAU|5.0|I know that this is supposed to be an uplifting story but it seemed just too sad for me.  But well written.<br /><br />Like Angela's Ashes it all has the ring of truth in it.  Worth reading.

B00EOO55GW|5.0|Best album by far. They really hit it out of the park with this one. Enjoy this great masterpiece.  Peace!!!!!
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|My son told us about Suits and since then we watch it all the time. The plot is awesome and that is the best opening song for any  show on the market.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I love all his books!!  They remind me of growing up in the south and how peaceful the small towns are.
1781162646|5.0|I read a lot of books. I don't write a lot of reviews. But this one was worth it both the reading and the writing.<br />I've been a King fan for many years. His writing started strong, and has gotten better and better. Joyland has him at the top of his game, but in a short and easily digested format.<br />Don't however, mistake short for casual. Joyland is very well-written and draws you into a short span in the life of it's protagonist. I related to him, felt present in his world, and was engaged in how the story would play out. Can't ask for much more than that.<br />Highly recommended.
B005LAIH2W|5.0|I watch it way to much per wife. It is a great Sci-Fi that up until end keeps you suspenced
B0024Y9EYS|5.0|I am bummed that this show did not continue. It had kind of a slow start, but then it started to develop a good story line. Wish someone would have picked up the show. The episodes they did make were pretty good.
0385537689|5.0|Having read &#34;Fifty Shades of Grey&#34; after an unusually piquant critique in a book show on TV, I was hooked, and immediately sought any and all subsequent works from this author from my source of all reading material, Amazon. I read them both as soon as I got them and they certainly didn't disappoint. The writing is so good that, whilst the eroticism is seldom absent, it in no way detracts from the story line that is just as gripping as the sex.<br />In short, I cannot fault these books that arouse, excite and delight in equal measure.
B0063IH60K|1.0|please offer ad free version of the identical app. would be worth the fee to avoid neverending ads and videos. thanks. cindy
0385537697|5.0|Continuing the story of the couple into marriage with no lessening of the erotic aspects of their relationship, depicting, to my mind, exactly how a marriage should be but so very seldom is! Well written as before with what is, to me, faultless prose given the subject so that paragraph after paragraph told the story so clearly that, no matter how farfetched, it became believable.<br />I sincerely hope E.L.James writes more in any genre she(?) chooses as I am sure it would be more good reading.
B008VSEJPK|5.0|I've been mixing for many years -- sometimes the results are good, sometimes bad, and I've never been able to put my finger on why.  Mike Senior gives a start-to-finish method for thinking about what you are doing and always having a plan.  I am going to try this on my next mixes and I'm sure it is going to make a big difference.<br /><br />I am an Electronics Engineer, which doesn't necessarily qualify me to be a good audio engineer, but it does mean that I look scrupulously at the sometimes simplistic explanations that authors give for complex subjects.  Mike Senior keeps it simple but always technically accurate, which means that I give him extra points!  I am going to refer other beginning engineers that ask me questions to Mike's explanations of things.  He explains it much better than I can to non-engineers.<br /><br />My only minor criticism is that the coverage of effects is a bit short compared to the other areas.<br /><br />I have a paper copy of this book on my coffee table, and electronic copies on all of my phones, Kindles, etc (all properly paid for!) and I review/refresh my thinking from it daily.
B00BHNQ5XK|3.0|The suspense did not hold my attention.The scariest part was the ending. once the story was revealed you could kind of guess how the story would end..
B0086221SS|1.0|This movie has such a warped sense of what is sexy.  The married couple discusses methods of rape and torture as supposedly humorous foreplay.  I am of a personality that once I start a movie, I have to see then end of it, but could not stand to watch another minute of this one.
B00A81MV3U|5.0|I love this movie.  It is now on my top ten of all time favorite movies.  Bradley Cooper is great and Jennifer Lawrence is awesome...guess that is why she won the oscar for her role in Silver Linings Playbook.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|This is a great game for anytime anyplace. For all ages. If you won't to have fun when you are down look no farther. :)
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|My kids really enjoy this game and I find myself taking part in the fun as we take turns.  It changes scenes often enough to keep it fun.
B001UHOWXI|5.0|This movie is a classic--that's why I ordered it for our family DVD collection. Great story that should be watched year after year at Christmas time.
B004LWZWGK|5.0|As a fan of the first two movies of this trilogy, I couldn't have asked for much more. Bane is better than Joker, and the movie ties in with the first one very well. I also enjoy how vulnerable Batman is portrayed, as it just makes you want to root for him more.
B005LJKEXS|4.0|Works perfectly. I have it running through several walls to connect my laptop to my printer in the office. Saves me a lot of time, have not had any trouble with it at all.
B00992CF6W|5.0|it gives you more life armor is your friend it protects you from creepers skelitons zombies and zombiepigmen. all on top of that it is fun.
B00D8HNR2K|2.0|Well, in short...its terrible. I have been a fan since the start of NIN and with each album Trent kept getting better and better. After WITH TEETH (The last great NIN album) came one terrible album after another and this is the lowest of the group so far. My favorite NIN album was THE FRAGILE. This trash is so far from any kind of NIN album that we have ever heard or want to hear. I gave it two stars because the follow tracks are worth giving atleast one or two listens.<br /><br />+\\"Came Back Haunted\\" (Sounds like something from WITH TEETH)<br />+\\"Find My Way\\"  (An interesting track, slow paced but keeps you listening)<br />+\\"Various Methods of Escape\\"  (Sounds like Something from THE FRAGILE)<br />+\\"Everything\\"  (The happy verson of WISH)<br /><br />I have listened to the album all the way through twice and cant stand it. Glad I didnt buy it, there is a website you can listen to the whole thing for free ([...] for now anyways. I had my cd pre ordered but cancelled it after hearing COPY OF A which is so bad I am disgusted by the fact its been released by NIN. In a nutshell the cd is soft, and strange. No yells, just a happy Trent Reznor with his laptop. If you liked YEAR ZERO and THE SLIP then buy it. If you Enjoyed THe Downward Spiral and THe Fragile/With Teeth then skip it. Simple.
B00AYB0TOW|5.0|Best action film I've seen in years. This is not a sensitive hero garbage chick flick, this is how it's done right. Man cave five star approved! Where can I get one of those guns!
B000BEZQ0Y|5.0|I love classical music, and I play the piano, so this score is right up my alley.  Beautiful and very similar in sound and style to works from the classical period (think Mozart and Beethoven), Dario Marianelli did *exactly* what he was supposed to- create a score that, barring a few cinematic flourishes, could have been the kind of music that Mr. Darcy would have listened to at his local concert hall.<br /><br />So I love the score.  Gorgeous themes, great classical depth- well worth the purchase.<br /><br />Just be aware that most of the CD sounds like classical music.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|LOVE and OBSESSED A must watch! Addictive amazing story line, true to its time frame and every episode beautifully filmed
B0034DGPEU|5.0|Best book I've read all summer..could not put it down.  Well wrought characters, enthralling story combining history and believable people.
B004R1Q296|5.0|Never realized the 14th Century was such an interesting time! Barbara does an amazing job of making it come alive.
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|I see why this was an Academy Award winner.  The movie was great.  I thought the cast was amazing.<br />My favorite scene is Bradley Cooper's character's review of A Farewell to Arms by Hemingway.  That was so hilarious.<br />It was exactly what I thought of that book when I read it in high school.  I saw it twice during the rental period.  Now I wish I would have just bought it so I can see it again.
B00EMJD6TC|5.0|I've heard a lot of reviews written by fans of the book by Max Brooks and many of them are negative, because they were expecting to see the book made into a movie. Simply put, this is not the same story from the book, however it's still a great zombie film. In fact, it's easily one of my favorite zombie movies of all time. If you're a fan of zombies, whether you've read the book \\"World War Z\\" or not (I recommend reading it btw) you will definitely have a good time watching this film. While there's not a lot of gore as in most zombie films, the zombies are pretty creepy and there's lots of 'em and there's enough tension to keep things interesting throughout. If you're on the fence about seeing this movie, let me give you a small nudge to check it out. You won't be disappointed. Just don't expect to see the book made into a movie.
B0089EHWQE|4.0|Nice character development and good story line.  An emotional and interesting quick read.  A little predictable in the end, but I really enjoyed it.
B007HUD6OS|5.0|Best book ever can wait for number 5 in the seris I've read all of them good good flood good!!!!
B002XISR8E|1.0|The DVD does not play in my system. It says I'm in the wrong region. If you are reading this movie mars please send me another dvd that works
B00DPKQ60A|4.0|Now before you bite my head of with my review title,hear me out. for many years Mariah dominated,by doing pop albums,as well as full on R&B albums with Hip-Hop influence as well. This album right here is exactly what ariana is doing,pure R&B production with a dash of Pop influences,not much though except for \\"Popular Song\\" how ironic in that title,and i only give the album 4 stars cause of this song lol,but other than that reminds me of R&B i grew up on,its amazing how fast she's blown up in just 4 months.<br />Now...to get to the mariah fell off point,well after \\"The Emancipation of Mimi\\" which sold 10 million,she came back a few years later and dropped E=MC2,which is a pretty good album as well,but you could hear her slipping a bit,it was just something about that emancipation album,the production was great,songwriting was on point,great R&B/Hip-Hop medley,ballads,had it all,and this is a pure Hip-Hop fan speaking lol,was just solid music,mom played it to death,fast forward to 2010's \\"Memoirs of an Imperfect Angel\\" that album which only sold barely past 500,000,which for mariah is terrible,but forget the sales,the singles just werent up to her normal standards,and letting The Dream produce the whole CD was a terrible idea,i think she learned that. And now 2013-Present shes sorta back after taking time to have her children,and even still she just doesnt make those dope songs anymore,its like shes lost her flare or something,who knows,Yours Truly has that Emancipation of Mimi energy,not quite there yet as Ariana has a few more albums to go,but shes on the right track,picking up where Mariah Fell off,sorry but she has,not saying shes done though,far from that,i definitely recommend this album to R&B fans who want some good upbeat music with a couple ballads,some Hip-Hop bounce,and feel good vibes.
B000JIHP88|5.0|I had no idea that the music selections were classical but it happens that this child loves the classics and demands to listen as she naps or goes to sleep at night.
B000LTAY1U|5.0|It is comfortable, keeps great time, and easy for an old man to see the hands.  Haven't used another watch since I received it.  It is somewhat smaller than I expected, since most new watches are the size of a saucer.<br /><br />Would recommend it for a leisure watch, particularly in hot weather as the band is fabric and doesn't pinch or sweat.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|Whodathunk that a Muslim could write a book like this?  As a non-Christian, I thoroughly enjoyed many of his findings, many of which I already knew, but he found some jewels that proved that the NT is not the &#34;word of God&#34; as Christianity contends.  I never thought I'd love a book like this, but I certainly do.  It has been one of the BEST book on the NT I've ever read.
0061992860|4.0|We were expecting the bigger size but this will do the trick too. At least it can fit in my pocket.
B005JABU82|5.0|i wasnt careful enough to realize that this wasnt the strike freedom gundam... it's just the freedom gundam. still, a really cool and flexible model. the detail in the leg and hand joints really impressed me. for a $30 gundam it was well worth the price. you get what you pay for. everything about the gundam is very sturdy and posable, however the wings tend to be a bit more fragile and harder to handle.
B00A285OOW|4.0|Another great story from Gregory. Her stories are incredibly entertaining.. I love her books. I've read almost all of them.
B00DDZM0GQ|5.0|One of those games that provide great variable rate of reward -- I AM GOING TO WIN THIS THING!!  (Someday LOL)
B00DYFCYSO|3.0|The tonality of John Legend's voice is something that will always endear me to him, however I just can't get with these overly sleepy,  sad, even when they're not sad songs. I mean it works if that's your thing, but I prefer him with a little more tempo.
B008JAGZDE|5.0|Funny movie but I had to watch it on my ipad so my kids wouldn't hear or see it so I snuck it out by the pool in a shaded area and watched it.  It was funny and cute.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|love it want more..it kept me interested ..I loved the thinking part of the game..wish it had more levels though
1591795230|5.0|At first, it took me a while to get into listening to these CD's.  They start of very heavy the background of how we think; however, after I got about half way through, I was hooked.  Right now, I am listed through for a 2nd time; great information about creating the life you want.
B00DP3IESY|5.0|How can I start this without a bunch of superlatives?<br /><br />Can''t be done Absolutely perfect transaction<br /><br />Many Thanks<br /><br />Gary Mann
B007J4T2G8|5.0|E.L. James takes you from unknowing innocence to the deep realms of seduction, passion and overwhelming lust. It is a love story that you witness unfold but from a very different light. It is a love that feels painfully doomed and yet you are so aptly drawn to the electricity between the sweet and lovely Anastasia and the all consuming Mr. Christian Grey. I literally found myself spellbound by this book and I look forward to devouring the rest of the Trilogy!
1936891026|3.0|I was sure what to expect when I opened this thin volume that promised to help me conquer my creative dilemmas. I'd been told I should read it so I figured I'd give it a shot. Pressfield illustrates resistance in all its various shapes and forms, sort of like a spotter's guide to what's getting in my way creatively. He then goes on to tell the reader what can be done about this. To be honest, while the book was helpful, I found it all a bit vague. It's meant to be able to help with all manner of creative endeavors from writing a novel to starting a business and in many ways it does. Pressfield stresses the importance of persistence, of doing the work and doing it every day no matter how much you don't feel like doing it or how much you think it sucks, which is all very inspiring, but again it's all very general and vague.<br />By all means read the War of Art, I recommend it as a useful tool for developing a strategy against creative sink holes, but alot of custom tailoring is required. The War of Art is not as one size fits all as it claims to be.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|It shows me there's a lot of sick people in the world Who would use a woman in such a manner.The woman is slowly made into a sex slave and women are used like this all over the world.<br />I know my comments probably will help sell more copies but it's not intended for that purpose.
B008RA3X5E|4.0|Great basic clock and alarm functions.  Easy to use, and nice add ons with upgrade.  Would recommend this to a friend.
1416955070|5.0|I've read all the books in the series. Couldn't put it down. Not since Harry Potter or Twilight have<br />I read so quickly and effortlessly. It's truly a fun read and I recommend it to anyone<br />who enjoys fantasy novels.
B000V6MQV4|5.0|No matter what my mood is I can always enjoy listening to Maroon 5.  I work around all different ages of adults and they all seem to enjoy it.
B00E97AZZK|4.0|It's like Ocean's 11...but with magicians...and only four accomplices.  They are in Vegas, though.  Give it a chance.  It's pretty good if you can embrace the campy magic show.
B000HZD168|5.0|It's like a cheese that gets better with age. I have a very special love of pre/early computer graphics and special effects. Not too mention a general love of the older Trek.
B00COGZ8FU|3.0|I have read most of the books. To see a small man as Jack Reacher(Tom Cruise) Took alot away from Movie. Books are much better
B00CL68QVQ|1.0|This movie held so much promise, and had rave reviews! The acting was okay, I've seen better performances from both Cooper and Lawrence, there just wasn't chemistry between them.  Added to that, the f-bomb is used over 40 times in this movie, couldn't they come up with something more imaginitive? In watching the movie I felt like huge pieces of the story were missing, guess I need to read the book.  Although the movie was so slow and awful I don't really want to read the book.  They won awards for this move? REALLY? Why!!?!!
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|I've been using Evernote for over a year, and I like it very much. Easy to use, concise and simple. The things I use it for, such as my grocery shopping list, just stays in Evernote, and I update it as needed. Makes my life a lot easier. Plus, I have the program on my phone, so I always have my list with me. Love it for lots of reasons.
B00CMYRVAO|4.0|Joe is one of my favorite male singer. His lyrics are so well place. For expressing his love to the female sex. It like did U received this message, his thoughts of pleasure. Enough said about Joe.
B008XKSW7M|1.0|I thought this movie raunchy, distasteful and immoral. The only wholesome relationship out of the movie was the relationship of Jennifer Lopez and her husband, waiting to adopt a child from Ethiopia. I'm glad that this movie was somewhat life-affirming, none of the pregnant women chose or considered abortion, but with the immoral relationships and vulgarity, I cannot recommend this film.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|love the realism in the game such beautiful horses only thing I have an issue with is how long it takes for the compition part of the game to load
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I was content with the conclusion of this book and series. I was expecting the end of the book as it  was played out but was hoping for a different outcome. It was very well written and entertaining as the other two books in the series. I will look forward to the movies.
B005MYEQ4U|5.0|How does Woody do it?  He nails a city as the background but he makes it a &#34;character&#34; in his movies.  Especially HERE with Paris in its daylight glory but in the subtleties of night and rain and clouds.  I also love Paris in the rain... even the &#34;touristy&#34; areas because there are so many museums, galleries, cafes, restaurants and shops to seek refuge in.  The flea markets (where the film ventures briefly) are many times covered now (similar to shops) and time spent there is priceless.  The cobblestones are shiny in the rain and everything smells delicious.  You can almost smell it on the screen as seen in &#34;Midnight&#34;.  The &#34;time travel&#34; episodes are perfect with the casting being one of the most ingenious I've ever seen.  Brody as Dali!!  Right on!  I saw Dali on French television in the '70's when I lived in France and, however briefly, Adrien nailed him!  Kathy Bates as Stein also was just perfect... oh they all were.  I had never seen Owen before so I loved him as the &#34;surrogate&#34; Woody and, of course, Marion Cotillard once again turns in a charming performance... as does the First Lady of France.  How on earth did Allen get her??!!<br />I won't reveal how many times I've watched it in all but two times in the theatre to begin with and I knew people who had gone six times.
B005544TRQ|3.0|It's a lawyer show that manages to remove all traces of African Americans from New York. FYI Jessica White's character is a cuban.
B00E978FGQ|5.0|Amazing as a sitdown movie full of action and surprises! Wonderfully energetic and is unexpecing... So glad I bought this movie since now I can watch it over and over and share with my family and guests the &#34;magical&#34; movie.
B00003CXXS|3.0|I purchased part 3 to complete my collection. The blond woman and her husband searching for their son acting stupid and doing stupid things thru more than 1/2 the movie was a turnoff.  Part 1 is the best of course and highly recommended. In part 3 they say the island is site B located near Corsica?  In part 2, I thought they said that island was site B and was located off the California coast. OK, so are there 3 islands, or just 2 to go along with the 3 part series?
B000QCQ8Y4|4.0|Nice to see Jack work as a member of his old unit! Only improvement would be to vary from the formula a bit more, but all in all a good read.
B00B7FXZQS|3.0|not sure if that says a lot but it had its usual suspenseful moments that is about all.  it has the stupid parents that don't believe anything is going on. for some strange reason they are also filming this stuff but no one is looking at the footage?
B004J4WLB4|5.0|The author slowly unfurls the life of the main character like the petals of a rose falling away, then coming together again so we can understand the life choices she makes. By the time she gives her baby away, you know that her own life has been less than perfect and admire her resilience in the face of so many disasters.<br />That true love, whether between mother and daughter or lovers or friends can overcome so many obstacles is one of the aspects of the book I most enjoyed.
B00ECU2RGY|3.0|the movie's entire plot was given away during the trailer.  everyone knows what the twist is when it eventually gets there halfway into the movie.  the ending?  SPOILER ::::::::::::::::::::its been done before with ID4::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::<br /><br />glad i didnt see it in theaters and waste $24.  only wasted the $6
B009XIXVU6|4.0|Khaled Hosseini once more pulled you into his tale by starting with the stories and fables of the Afghan people. He than takes you through a period of their history that is both sad and compelling, knowing where the Afghan people are today. I enjoyed how he scattered his characters over the globe and gave you a feel for their adaptation into other lands and cultures. I also loved how the characters find one another again after so many years.<br />I did not like the way he jumped from one time/character/place to another. Got used to it after a while, but found too much of a disconnect.
B00DC7N9NS|5.0|i've seen wicked and i thought this was a really good take on the franchise.  i loved how the movie opened up with the black and white screen.  i thought that i ordered it non blu ray.
B00COGXGNQ|5.0|I really enjoyed all the twists and turns of the storyline. It had it all......Romance, suspense, humor and some great actors too!
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|This is really a great game I have played over and over even though sometimes I get frustrated because down to one item and cannot find it before time is out
B00BC24NT4|5.0|No one develops the story or the characters as well as John LeCarre. He is my favorite story teller . He also does something most other writers struggle with which is end the book in a convincing fashion.
B005USZML4|4.0|Another good book in this series.  I enjoy reading about this boys connections and thought process.  There is some good comic relief as well.
B005DJREJS|4.0|I am a sucker for well done high school shows, (Popular, Joan of Arcadia, Freaks and Geeks, etc.) I shied away from this one for awhile, but once I watched just a couple of episodes, I was hooked. Ashley Rickards is just a little too good looking to be believable as the geeky outsider,but I quickly warmed up to her in the role of Jenna. She is terrific. The one slightly sour note, for me anyway, is Molly Tarlov as Sadie, the nemesis. She is just a bit too reminiscent of Bijou Phillips wonderful role in Freaks and Geeks. Ms. Talov is good, but just a bit derivative. I like Jenna's mother, played by Nikki DeLoach. Her portrayal of the pregnant-too-young, miss-my-youth mother is spot-on. Jessica Lu as the third-wheel friend is also very good. I look forward to the other seasons.
B007HUD6OS|3.0|I have really been enjoying this series.  The other books I would give 5 stars.  This one just seemed to go on and on, almost like the author was not sure where he was going next then had a thought.  Give the other books a chance.  You will enjoy them.
B004U8VX2M|5.0|Loved the black and white ones...made it seem really for the time. Helps to understand Downton Abby...characters are wonderful...can't wait to see Season 2
0439023491|5.0|I'm just giving it 5 stars because I have a gut feeling it will be great!  The first of the series was a page-turner....
B007HO392S|5.0|I've never bought one of her cd's before. I will buy more of her cd's if they are like this one. She is great and really love listening it.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Didn't start watching till season 3 season finale.... watched season 1 & 2 leading up to the finale but didnt watch it because i waited for the whole season to come out..... i'm hooked now! GO DEAD !!!
B009I2UH2W|1.0|Returned...<br />It broke in less than a week, normal use, literally only plugged in my phone less than a dozen time.<br /><br />Really dissapointed as I had a griffin charger for for my 4, and it worked great, had it for 3 years.
1401201911|5.0|In this beautifully drawn and colored graphic novel Superman, as a baby, lands on a Soviet farm rather than in the US. Imagine Superman become the right hand man of Joseph Stalin! Or would Superman change Stalin as well? And what about Lois Lane, Lex Luthor, Wonder Woman et al? How are their lives changed when the Man of Steel becomes the Comrade of Steel?<br /><br />The artwork is very nice and the ideas intriguing in this terrific graphic novel that explores an alternate super history. Well written, well drawn, and thought provoking.
B0035G0U2O|5.0|I bought the first DVD & gave it to my daughter as a gift. Watched it & liked it so much the I got my very own movie. I have watched my copy 3 times & plan on another 30 times.
B009PODB76|4.0|I love Delta Goodrem. What a voice! I don't love as many songs on this CD as in previous ones, but the tracks that I do, I REALLY love.
B00ECU34ZM|4.0|Gorgeous movie from the director of Tron with great music from M83, but a semi-predictable story. I wish I had seen it in the theater.
B00499NHLC|5.0|Right up there with Game of Thrones and Doctor Who for me. I wasn't sure if I would like a modern take on Sherlock, but once I started watching, I couldn't stop. I watched in a one long marathon. Ditto for season two, which, incredibly was better than season one.
B00ELOOYZI|5.0|Simple rockets is a great change up from DUMMY DEFENSE and simple PHYSIS and this time we have sound effects finally, the game it self is fun playing it so far u build rockets to do all types of things on planets and even the whole solar system, like u can build your rocket as big as u want it wit gizmos like searchers,wheels,fuselage,parachute,nose cones,Landers.There's 4 diff engine and fuel tanks,plus u can make all sorts of stages on your rocket and control them when ever u feel. I did a few missions so far and there easy all the way to making a rocket to leave earth fly all the way to to moon and try to land your craft.Also from orbiting planets the rite way to just fun ones like getting best time like a drag race ,on some missions or in the sand box u can speed up time up to warp times five if u want. Warp is a great thing cause depending on your ship u make and orbit plus your speed I found that a crazy orbit in the solar system can take at regular speed can take days,,, I mean real days lol it shows the time on a orbit, nice on realism! Each planet has different gravity mass , radius and atmosphere pressure that effects everything, I like the sand box mode where u can try to fly around the whole solar system even during gravity sling shots. There's so much more I could say about it that is good I think the early space missions would use this no lie on that. To rap it up it runs great on my kindle fire HD only has one permission witch ant bad at all to lot of other apps I got so this diff worth the price trust me u will get hooked after playing it, Must have app to any Physis lover and space exploration that's on point, o and anyone who likes blowing stuff up.<br /><br />Update:December 19, I was the first person on here to get this app that not many knew about accept when on faotd one time. I still like this app the update was good especially for when making a rocket, the only thing I hate now is the phony hacked high scores that are on the top ten of every mission.it takes the thrill out of getting your rocket rite and getting the best time or distance on anything!

B00499NHLC|5.0|Love it!  The characters have been modernized and for the better.  Although you do sometimes have trouble understanding the English accents.  You'll love it.
B00BFV1LZG|5.0|This book series is fantastic! It's quick, sharp, witty, and at one point I jumped, just as I would if I were watching a thriller movie. James Dashner captures the suspense of the character's odd situation while ever so slowly leaking information as to why they are in the situation. Dashner excels in making the reader care deeply for each character, even the antagonists, and is also a master at creating red herrings... as a reader, you experience the tension of a particular situation, and when it is resolved you can't help but relax... only to be shocked as the characters are plunged into another horrific event. It's truly a masterpiece.
B0089LOG02|4.0|Nice work of historical fiction. Not too depressing, but insightful into the plight of these children. I will read the author's other books most likely.
B007TNQ7EY|4.0|this game is very good but it's got a lot of bugs like for some reason on kindle fire hd you can't fly helicopters which in some of the missions you have to fly one and there is another bug were motorcycles stay in drift for ever and you can't move and one more thing there are lots of things to do but say you just want to screw around and kill pedestrians there are pedestrians but there aren't to many I found myself driving around forever just trying to find a npc
B0067Q42BY|5.0|I purchased this app before and I am so glad to get it for free! This game is loads of fun time passes by so quickly when I am playing. Simply love the graphics, music, and the silly stories<br />Thanks
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I thought this app was great for horse lovers also kids of all ages would enjoy playing this great game.
B00CL0J99K|1.0|really disappointed in this movie-more iron man action and less talk!<br /><br />A bunch of cool iron man suits-too bad they never showed you what any of them do, other than fly apart when they get hit by a truck. C'mon,Man.<br /><br />The Whole Mandarin/old scorned girlfriend/colleague plot twist thing was WEAK...loved Downey, he's great, and SOME of the dialog was funny, but the movie overall was a real bummer. Loved IM 1 & 2, Avengers, Thor and Captain America. This movie doesn't measure up to any of them. Just my 2 cents
B008X9I6X8|5.0|This gives, &#34;being drunk with power,&#34; a new meaning!  I was very shocked to see just how entertaining it was and obscene!  Color me fifty shades of Red!! I thoroughly enjoyed it!
B00D8HNR2K|2.0|This is easily one of the most forgettable albums in the NIN catalogue.<br /><br />My favourite album by Nine Inch Nails would have to be The Fragile, followed by the Downward Spiral and Pretty Hate Machine. I also like Broken and Still and all the rare songs Trent Reznor did for the Lost Highway soundtrack and B Sides and the 2002 Ep released with the Live album.<br /><br />However since With Teeth its all been downhill.<br /><br />Trent Reznor may think he is being creative by limiting NIN sound, but its all been heard before.<br /><br />Luckily on Hesitation Marks theres a bit more experimentation and throwback to 1999 on this album, when NIN were a force to be reckoned with.<br /><br />But.....it suffers from Year Zero album problems. No guitar.<br /><br />The lack of variety lets it down, its mostly sound effects and noise, and average songwriting.<br /><br />Try harder next time, but not unrecommended if you want to hear something more exciting than With Teeth or the 2007/2008 albums.
B00BZW5W3W|5.0|This CD is Maysa's best work to date. She returned to the sound she had early on with incognito. I am sure Bluey had some thing to do with that. But it is a winner.
B004SBX112|5.0|I love this game, I play this game  all the time.  I am always telling people to get the games from amazon.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|This book touched all my emotions, I cried, I prayed, I laughed, I was genuinely touched!  Thanks again for another great novel!
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|This movie was excellent. I love it.  It is also so sad what afro-american people had to<br />go thru.<br /><br />I would recommend this movie to everyone.
B00ECU2RGY|4.0|It was better than I expected - I just wanted an entertaining movie and it was.  I am favorably disposed towards SciFi movies in general.  Good production values and enjoyable.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|As each season comes along the writing is better and better. Great cast, great story lines. And all the better with Dame Maggie Smith - she gets all the best lines!! :)  &#34;What's a Weekend&#34;  LOL
0385523394|5.0|I loved the Netflix first series of this story and couldn't wait til the next one, so I bought the book. I can't put it down! Fascinating stories of friendship and the writer's year in prison. I'd also suggest Off the Hook, by Terry Martin. Another true story along the same lines.
B00007BH5C|3.0|I couldn't listen to it in any device or burn it onto my laptop. It's my favorite soundtrack too..had to re-order from somewhere else. It was packaged allright and arrived in a timely manner. I've bought from these guys before and never had a problem, hence the 3 stars. I had to eat the money though because I don't have a printer to go through the Amazon ordeal of returning something.
B002RI9HUM|4.0|Very interesting story. My sister recommended to it to me saying I would like it but it was not the ususal sort of book I would read.<br />Compelling reading with a good insight into the characters and the so called veils they hide behind. Humerous but sad with evidence of fallout for families but also identifies family forces that make us what we are.
B005I4JG80|5.0|i am an avid reader, however i find reading non-fiction books really tough most of the time. totally not the case with this book. it is well-written and humorous and very informative. i purchased this book a while ago, but didn't start reading it until i became pregnant. as i was reading it, i realized that the \\"French way\\" of parenting isn't very different from how my mom brought my brother and i up. we completely had limits and heard the word \\"no\\" often and obeyed it. and i never recall my mom yelling...i DO remember her \\"quiet anger\\"! the sort of anger that you could feel and that was scarier to my brother and i more than any words could ever express! oh and she totally did those wide owl eyes too to let us know that she did not approve of what we were doing (or what we were about to do).<br /><br />when i was a nanny for a toddler girl, i \\"parented\\" her the same way my mom did, and she respected me for it. i only dealt with one tantrum...and i never had to deal with them again. unfortunately, her parents felt too guilty, i suppose, for leaving her and going to work and they allowed her to walk all over them. it was very frustrating as a nanny, but she wasn't my child and i could only do so much. fortunately, she's grown up into a wonderful teenager and her parents still credit me for her upbringing...and most of my methods were the \\"French way\\" of parenting, without even knowing it. so it sort of shocks me that i was able to do this without really knowing what i was doing, and yet parents today cannot - they let their children throw tantrums in public, throw food on the floor in restaurants, etc. now that i am going to be a parent, (and i'm sure EVERYONE says this), my child will not get away with that crap!<br /><br />i found the author's experiences very interesting to read about, and all the research she did - well, it makes me want to delve further, just out of curiosity and the thirst for knowledge! i have recommended this book to anyone i know who is pregnant currently. LOVE this book!!ant currently. LOVE this book!!
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|Didn't expect to fall head over heels in love with this show.  It's smart, fun, and engaging, and I am totally binge-watching it.  Very eager to see where the story goes from here.
B00127RAJY|4.0|This is a great starter for getting your body to where you want it!  I recommend it for anyone who wants to get in shape.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|Very persuasive interpretation of what the man intended his mission to accomplish -- every Christian should it and discuss it
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|This is a very well written story about a man with a terrible past and a bleak future. But into his life come some interesting folks with some new ideas and his life starts to change. Some parts are so sad you just have to cry. And then there are segments that are so funny.....well, you just have to cry! A really wonderful book with a surprising and delightful ending. Highly recommended.
B003INBNXO|5.0|THIS WAS A GIFT AND HE LOVED IT
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I enjoyed every minute of Season Three and didn't want it to end.  My greatest surprise was Edith's thoroughly modern, thoughtful approach to her life and what it is she really wants.
B0090CMMIC|5.0|I love this ablum. The songs are great and I have been listening to it nonstop since I bought it!
B001993Y2C|5.0|I love this show! This collection is almost complete, it is missing the movie \\"The Plan\\", but you can get the version that has it here:<br /><br />[[ASIN:B0036EH3U2 Battlestar Galactica Complete Series Blu ray]]<br /><br /> The only thing you'll be missing is the Cylon figure that comes with the one that I got, if you don't care about it, you should get the newer version.
B007BVOEPI|5.0|I started reading the Game of Thrones series, and once I got a couple books into it, I decided I wanted to watch the HBO series.  I absolutely love, love, love the books.  The tv series follows really closely to the books and they did a great job in choosing the characters.  I love the tv and book series and am hooked on both of them.
1579121306|5.0|The book is in very good condition with many good puzzles which is very useful on improving on end games and openings
B001FQIWSK|5.0|Love the images, the story, the actors, the time period, everything. Great to watch with your family and an excellent film to think about
B009KS4XRO|3.0|This game is a nice time passer.  I have not had a chance to adequately evaluate this game.  It is interesting enough for me to want to play it again, at this point.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|I really enjoy this game....can play for hours and not get bored. It is so much better on the Kindle than on the phone. Wish it was easier to get coins without spending real money but it is a free game.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|One of my best reads! Loved this trilogy and the style of writing! Couldn't put the books down until I read them all!
B00CF34B2I|5.0|Awesome game I would recommend it to anyone wanting to play magic, from the newbie to the master. I like the new sealed deck option where you can win booster packs.  Deck building is fun too. Looking forward to playing slot of magic in the future.
0762434279|3.0|I was unaware the size. It's pocket sized, cute, but it was an unexpected surprise. I was hoping for the original size..OH WELL
B005K0HDGE|5.0|One of the things I have always loved about Stephen Kings books is being so drawn into the story that you don't want to put the book down. That is the case with this one too.<br />I've often wondered what would have happened if Kennedy had not been killed. Most would have painted the world in happier colors. King didn't let me down. I knew the book wouldn't end on a happy note and for that I'm glad. Looking forward to whatever he throws my way next.<br />I guess my only criticism with the book (as a resident Fort Worthian) would have to do with the confusion of Mercedes Avenue in west Fort Worth with Mercedes Street in Benbrook. It's a little thing. Ninety nine percent of the readers wouldn't even have questioned it, but to me, it was a bit of a bother.
0385347774|1.0|This isnt what I like to read as a mysterous and thrilling novel.700 more pages kept me wasting time reading it.I prefer the style of the novel:Before I go to sleep.It was the first one thrilling waking me up how interesting and captivative a novel could have provided.
B00A85EMVK|5.0|Love this movie. Although the 3D effects are not that great, that is only to be expected. Movies that are converted into 3D do not provide the wow factor that comes from a movie that is shot in true 3D. If you are expecting a lot of pop out scenes, you may be disappointed.<br /><br />However, I do love this movie, and I think that it is a great buy!
B0006VIE4C|4.0|I really enjoyed this DVD, bought it to share with a young friend whom hadn't seen it yet. I was actually hoping to find the original version, not the remake. But it's still good. Price was right and delivery was quick.
B0064ORVCQ|5.0|Ok, so I love the Harry Potter movies! The scenery is stunning and the acting is fantastic! I will warn you though that the 3D effects in the movie are not as great as a movie that is shot in true 3D. If you are looking for lots of pop out scenes, then you will probably be disappointed.<br /><br />Overall, I think it's a great movie and a great buy, 3D or not!
B004FOA84A|5.0|A definite must for Myst fans or the like. Great graphics and challenging puzzles. I would love to see this dev release another game like this as they did such a good job with this one. Check out the Lost City by the same dev. It's another game just as equally awesome as this one.
B006671NPM|5.0|Ok, so I love the Harry Potter movies! The scenery is stunning and the acting is fantastic!

B008DM4OTA|4.0|My 3 and 5 year olds love it. They both play it and then laugh as they go through it. It is a good app that brings curiosity of how people get sick and simple fixes.
B007N579X6|5.0|I loved this movie! It is a great movie for the whole family. It's a little slow at first, but it really picks up in the end. Love the minions!
B0010VD7EO|5.0|Creative and talented!! This group will be around for awhile.!!  I love their videos and would love to see them live!
B00ACKU1NY|5.0|Was in France and where  we were staying had no tv . Downloaded the app and poof tv . A great app
B00EB6F1TY|2.0|I really wish Shane Black and Marvel had gone in a different direction with this third Iron Man film. After the Avengers there was so much potential to come back with a home run and tell a great Tony Stark movie without taking away the armor (but then not really). Robert Downey Jr. is the only saving grace for this movie as he's still just as fun to watch as Tony but other than I wish I could forget about this movie. I'll be buying this when the price hits $7.99 next year.
B0044WSF5M|2.0|I wasn't missing anything ;-)  I could have gone the rest of my life missing this movie and would have been just fine.  We were looking for something fun for family movie night, and thought an oldie like this would be good.  I was really bored.
0374533571|5.0|Something in me doesn't quite want to give this book five stars, but I thoroughly enjoyed reading it and can't think of any improvements. Maybe it just seems too effortless? On the theory that a novel doesn't have to be hard or heavy to merit a glowing review (though the book certainly is not the fluffy romantic comedy script I expected from the movie marketing), I'm giving this one 4.75 stars. If you've got five bucks to spend on the Kindle edition, read this fun, creative, quick, funny, and heart-warming tale. It's one of the best books I've read this year.<br /><br />A few characteristic quotes:<br /><br />\\"Please. I need you to want this. If only for me, Pat. Please.\\"<br /><br />\\"My other friends are in music relaxation class, which I do not attend, because smooth jazz makes me angry sometimes.\\"<br /><br />\\"Esther loses her virginity, hemorrhages during the process, and almost bleeds to death - like Catherine in A Farewell to Arms - and I do wonder why women are always hemorrhaging in American literature.\\"
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Chromecast is great, now I have Netflix streaming on a dumb TV, it works very well. If Google delivers on the promised feature set it will be even better. The price is also right.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|This show is awesome! Our whole office watches together, and we all love it!! The characters are wonderful! Just an all around good show!
B00821OX98|4.0|I like scify and this is a very well made series. The acting is pretty good but what I like the most is the story, it immerses you with great characters.
B0028MBKVG|5.0|Great inspiring story of how a small group of forgotten Indians in Mexico showed everyone how to run again. A must read.
B00DC7NNAC|2.0|I would rate it one star but it feels like that would be a disservice to say that I hate it.  I will simply say that what could have been an excellent re-imagining of the original ended up falling victim to pacing problems and character issues.  I'm a huge fan of Zach Braff, James Franco, Mila Kunis and Rachel Weisz.  It feels like the entire production seemed to want to force the story rather than let it develop on its own and the actors were forced to work with it, which didn't end well.  Zach Braff usually does some good comedy but here it felt very out of place with the rest of the events and James Franco unfortunately also felt very out of place.  Mila Kunis and Rachel Weisz seemed well placed and their performances were alright, but with the disjointed production it didn't help alot.  Overall I wish the movie had been better as I had high hopes with the cast but was ultimately let down.
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|Excellent job finishing this marathon Brandon Sanderson. Complicated story to handle but well done tying all the threads together. Sad to see story end!
B005KXU83G|5.0|Captures the raw energy of the hits done at a live show. Well recorded with good balance Turn it up LOUD!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Great job on this one guys!  The only thing that I would like to see is more objectives on each level<br /><br />Gbomer
B009BJAZBA|5.0|this is a great show.  I love that you see both sides of the story, the wealthy and the &#34;help&#34;.
B000CDIOYO|5.0|This is a deeply touching rendering of SMP. Despite being outdated in several respects (sound picture, some tempi, choir size, instruments etc), it works its way into your mind and stays there.
B007JRUCGO|2.0|The animation and voices were fine but the storyline was extremely weak!  It's like 'what else can happen to a bunch of penguins?'  The synopsis said it was about a young penguin who was reluctant to dance.  It wasn't much about that at all.  But it was only $1.99.  I've been ripped off for more.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|I had never heard of the Mortal Instruments series until the movie was announced. I picked up the book to see if it was a movie I wanted to see. I was enthralled. After reading the book, I'll see the movie, although I know I'll be disappointed because they can't do the book justice. There isn't enough time to do that in a movie. I will read all the books in the series to see how this comes out. Great book.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|I thought it would break my heart to read, but in fact, I was uplifted and see joy in this moving, well written book. Did not want to put it down.
B001NLL93W|5.0|Great book. After reading City of Bones, I wanted more and this book delivers. I want more and Cassandra Clare delivers.
0312427573|5.0|Sherman McCoy, a snobbish WASP bond trader, and his mistress make a wrong turn on their way back from the airport and find themselves in the middle of the Bronx.  This one misstep leads to a series of events that expose the problems within the law system and how easy it is to manipulate it for ones own means.<br /><br />I couldn't help thinking when reading this novel how relevant Wolfe's writing still is today.  Greed, capitalism, us vs. them tensions, and the machinations of Wall Street.  After the Financial Crisis of 2008 based in Wall Street, those themes have just as much meaning today as they did during the late 80's.  What's best though, is that Wolfe doesn't sermonize or tell you how you should feel about what his writing is exposing.  He just introduces you to the undercurrents rocking NYC and allows you to form your own opinions.<br /><br />It's a little long, as it takes awhile for Wolfe to make all of his points he seems to want to make.  But, as I enjoyed every page, I didn't find the fact that the story was a little slow at times to be a turnoff.  Filled with intriguing characters, Bonfire of the Vanities is a must read.
B001NLKZUA|5.0|Cassandra Clare does it again. Keeps you wondering what's going to happen. Always leaves you wanting more. I can hardly wait for the new City of Heavenly Fire.
B00EDF43MY|5.0|My son loves this game and plays it all the time. As he says it, &#34;I like it a lot!&#34;
B003WUYOQ6|5.0|This is a great book, and really makes its case.  The central premise is that eating carbohydrates elevates your insulin which increases your stored fat.  With just this in mind, I believe it answers:<br /><br />- Why Atkins-style diets work<br />- Why fruitarian diets work<br />- Why vegan diets work<br />- Why the starch solution diet totally failed me<br />- Why a low-fat diet (and/or added exercise) sometimes seems to work, but can be frustrating and give confusing results<br /><br />Really happy I stumbled across this.
B001B51B9M|5.0|A Great musical. Something to be watched a few times a year. Music is engaging, story line is refreshing, a lot of actors that went on to be recognized names. This is one where the movie is always better than the play. Leaves you feeling good no matter the age.
B00DDZM0GQ|5.0|Got this as a AFATD a couple weeks ago and it has made it onto my main game folder on my<br />Home screen.  Tetris like game, but more fun.  Addictive.  Some games can last a couple minutes at the upper levels whole when you are starting out some games can take a half hour.  Progress issaved.
B005XUC398|5.0|This was a very fun movie to watch. Great actors, story line, and it explores (fairly) ethical and moral issues that surround the Financial Services industry during the recent financial crisis.
B00D3LA5WG|4.0|This movie has a very small interesting cast and most of the players are adolescent boys. The suspense and tension of the story really carries through and McConaughey keeps us guessing as to his motives as well as his background. The boys discover him living on an island in the Mississippi that they thought was unknown to anyone else. We discover more about everyone's background as the complications accelerate and come to an action packed conclusion
B00ECUARO8|3.0|Take out Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson, replace them with Matthew McConaughey and Resse Witherspoon, then take out Tokyo and replace it with Arkansas. Add in a total disregard for subtlety, and a shot of violence...walla, you are \\"Lost in Mud.\\"<br /><br />Acting: Solid<br />Set design: Solid<br />Script: Solid<br />Plot: Seriously? No<br /><br />I liked the ending to \\"Take Shelter.\\" For me that did not leave me hanging, and that movie balanced tense scenes with scenes of stillness, to masterful affect. Mud, however, did not really end with any sense of resolve at all. It found a strange spot to end, that did not seem to give me a reason for spending the last two hours or so with it.<br /><br />Also: What kind of kid cries about unrequited adult love, but doesn't cry when a man punches him in the face? Did I miss something there? I want to like this, because I was not having a bad time watching it, but ultimately it's the character's motives which felt confusing and incomplete to me. I guess I'll give it three stars for quality, but that's the most I can give it.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|Great Book! Much better then the TV series which in my opinion misses the characteristic personalities of some key people.
B007VTVGAQ|3.0|I know this is some sort of masterwork, and perhaps if I saw the whole thing played live, then I might see why, but for me it's difficult to swallow, because of the whole thing where she is doing the jazz singer vibe but trying to feather it out a bit with esoteric flourishes. It leaves it in an odd niche where it's really not pop music at all, but nor is it really any kind of tangible jazz offshoot. Instead it's more like a composition performed in a way like a play.<br /><br />It doesn't follow a danceable time signature, and it reads like a demonstration of vocal dexterity, perhaps the vocal equivalent of a guitar solo, but with the texture of Disney's \\"Peter and the Wolf.\\" It's a peculiar thing, with subtle nods to swing music and cartoon scores, but little of the sultriness of a classic jazz singer like Billy Holiday.<br /><br />When I listen to this, I can't figure out at all who it's standard audience might be. Of course it's a critically acclaimed album, and I would not call it garbage or anything; it's rich with quality content, and some degree of compositional fortitude, but it's just quirky as hell, especially compared to any other female singer with this much to emote. Fionna is extraordinarily talented, and no one should deny that. I don't necessarily expect her to return to her original sultriness, but this playful side shown here, riddled with sharp emotional barbs, feels a bit like the product of mania, and severed from any conversation with it's audience. Instead this work is a conversation with itself, something like an extended feminist-ish spin on \\"Waiting For Godot.\\" Although all her lyrics are aimed at hypothetical male figures, it still feels like she is Dave Mustaine in the \\"Sweating Bullets\\" video talking to herself erratically.<br /><br />Hey, whatever floats your boat; You go girl!
B00ECU34ZM|4.0|Wanted to view a new sci-fi flick so I chose this one based on the trailers prior to release. It delivered a sufficient amount of entertainment and did not have too many annoying errors or cliches.
B00CLD671A|5.0|Downton Abbey is superb drama!!!  The cast is excellent and the storylines are captivating!!!  I have never<br />watched a better drama and I urge everyone I know to start watching it!!!!

B007EC27QM|5.0|Seems to be a great little app... I have it on my home screen, love the ease if use. Swiping to get to more advanced functions is excellent!
B00DC7N9NS|4.0|First, I need to say that I have loved Garland's Oz, and loving Wicked- well-this is the base from which I review this. I like the actor james franco. But not as Oz. He didn't seem to quite pull it off. It was as though he was doing an &#34;impression&#34; of Oz and not quite succeeding. It felt contrived. Also-owning all of the Wicked books and knowing the geography-the characters and their placements were-here's where I stop. A long time ago-when Jurassic Park movie came out-people who had read the book cried foul. Those like me-who read the book after-enjoyed it on its face value. I think that is the case here. If you have not read the wicked series-or don't have any feelings about Garland's Oz-then you will probably enjoy this interpretation. For the rest-you might find yourself as I did-picking it apart. i didn't not like it-but I can't help but wonder how marvelous it would have been if they could have incorporated some of the Wicked elements.
B000EYK4GW|5.0|I ordered this to replace one my son had destroyed that belong to my mother (not that any of you really care about that). the disc worked, I am happy.

B000FC11A6|5.0|Whenever I look back on all of the concepts here - bitcoins, personal online freedom vs. the government, etc - I'm astounded of what Stephenson channeled when he wrote it.  That and it's great ride, with fantastic characters.
B007THA4FI|1.0|I confess -- I read to escape.  And to escape to a better place, or at least a familiar one.  This book starts off with unpleasant people doing unpleasant things in unpleasant places.  Who needs this?  Pas moi.
B00136JR2M|5.0|I owned this album before the digital era and lost it (never converted it to MP3 format).  I recently bought it and downloaded it.  Great price...pretty standard.  This album is one of my favorites!

B005LAII1C|5.0|This is a pretty funny movie and it was at a good price on Amazon when I purchased it.  This was purchased as a gift and it was a good deal.
B005DJREGQ|1.0|I realize that this show may be trying to reflect &#34;modern America&#34; but the language is/ and actions are hideous. Overboard teen drama
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This was a $1.99 I thoroughly enjoyed spending! I thought it would take me longer than it did but I blew through it in one night. It comes with a bonus chapter called &#34;Epilogue&#34; That had me stumped for a a few minutes but after Chapter 3 of the actual game you know how to figure out what you are missing. I cannot wait for the second game to come out and continue the albeit 'unusual' yet strangely relevant to my life (as I am exploring spirituality through meditation and energy) storyline. I definitely recommend it and then when you finish, it is equally satisfying to watch other people try to work their way through the puzzles.
B0087JTAKW|5.0|Amazing novel with a beautiful message. Makes you eager to read on. It's enjoyable and worthy of your time! A must read.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I've read this twice, several years apart.  It is still one of my favorite science fiction books.  Read it soon , before the movie version.
B00AMYX60U|4.0|It's amazing to see how a young person can be as talented as she is. Her raw talent goes perfectly with her voice, accompanied by - sometimes - bittersweet sounds. With just 20 years of age, definitely we'll be hearing more of her in the years to come.<br /><br />I think the title is true to what you'll hear in the record, but more importantly, what she transmits when she sings will be your best friend for a chilly rainy afternoon.<br /><br />Also, even though there are only 12 tracks listed,  there's a bonus song (called Take me Away) that it's worth hearing.<br /><br />I waited a long time to get this cd, and it definitely was worth the wait.
B00BHHIWQO|4.0|I had a blast playing this game- I only wish it had more screens to play on!Love the gems and colors.
B009B1UZ7C|4.0|Jake Bugg is an amazing mix of folk and true, pure brit rock. This cd reminds me of the beginnings of Oasis, with the raw voice and amazing guitar sounds. Truly, for just 19 years of age, he embodies the best of the Gallagher brothers and with lyrics beyond his age.
B004DLPXAO|1.0|I couldn't even log into this app once downloaded. Good thing it was free and uninstall is a quick solution. Boo amazon.
B00C5R8364|5.0|He is a master of writers. His capacity to develop tension and to describe environment does not have equal. Excellent<br /><br />from.the.beginning to the end
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|It's good if you like online games. I think that it's the best you can get for free stuff.<br />I believe this is a good give away.
0143038583|5.0|Michael Pollan is a master storyteller.  This book is a page-turner that overflows with interesting details about America's food supply and colorful stories from farm to slaughterhouse.
B00CKJ2KK2|5.0|This game is amazing cartoon fps. If you like call of duty this can or cannot be your game. This game is not for kids under the age of 8. So parents........
0375703764|5.0|I read a lot of reviews and a lot of people weren't sure if its a well written horror novel or a funky romance.  I came into owning this book in a strange way and definitely was compelled to read it.  I have to say that its one of the best and most well written stories I have ever read, the author must have worked on this day and night without sleep or any distraction because its perfect...
B0053O89RY|5.0|Modern family, whats not to love?!?! This series just keeps getting better and better! Cant wait for all other seasons!
B001N9ESQ4|5.0|Romance without being sappy. The writing is terrific. You want the two to get together. After seeing the first two, I can't wait to see &#34;Before midnight&#34;!
B000ID37RM|5.0|When the 50th anniversary edition of the novel came out, it sparked my interest in reading &#34;To Kill A Mockingbird&#34;. For some reason, I had not gotten to it, and that seemed like an oversight. I really enjoyed reading Harper Lee's book; I also read about her life and about the filming of &#34;To Kill A Mockingbird&#34;, and followed by viewing the film. The film is wonderful - even though it does not follow the novel strictly, it still captures the essence of the story. Watching the film gave me perspective on the era in which it was written. It is almost time-traveling into a different world.The morality and strength of character that we see in Scout's lawyer/father is inspiring. The setting is filled with Southern Gothic magic. Both novel and film are highly recommended.
B0058OUJA4|4.0|The pace is a little frantic getting started but once you get a feel for things it's a lot of fun.
B007GCY8FS|4.0|If you read the Lee Childs books about Jack Reacher, you'll be more than a little puzzled by the casting of Tom Cruise in the lead role. That being said, taken on its own, it's a very enjoyable movie and moves along briskly. Good satisfying ending too.
