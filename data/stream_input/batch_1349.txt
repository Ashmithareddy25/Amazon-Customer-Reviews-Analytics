B002RI98BA|5.0|a remarkable work, a definitive book on a self made man who by force of his native intuition and personality, enabled abraham lincoln to leap frog many wealthier and experienced politicos to the presidency. ms kearns goodwin, by choosing to view the lincoln presidency from this perspective has demonstrated lincoln's unique ability to to persuade/cajole (or threaten ?) his cabinet to work as a team - a team under the greatest of pressures. this is a seriously good book . john lawlor , tralee ireland

1591396190|3.0|About 15 years ago I read a book called \\"Start-up.\\" The author talked about strategy for start-ups. He recommended avoiding competition by focusing on the \\"white spaces.\\" This book calls it \\"blue ocean.\\" The concept of targeting new markets where there are few or no competitors is not new. Another entrepreneur recommended this book to me. It was easy to read and only took me a couple of days, but the concepts are not new. The graphical analysis tools, however, were novel concepts. I recommend this book for senior executives that are developing strategic marketing plans--not your average mid-level executive.

B001320RGG|5.0|This ANCHOR BAY edition of Robin Hardy's occult classic THE WICKER MAN is shorter than the Director's Cut by about 10 minutes. That [[ASIN:B000JVT1U0 longer version]] is also available on DVD.<br /><br />\\"Wicker Man\\" is the type of film that will absolutely give a viewer nightmares. It concerns a police sergeant (Woodward) who responds to a missing child report on a remote Scottish island. The residents of Lord Summerisle's (Lee) quaint village uniformly deny the existence of 12-year-old Rowan Morrison (Cowper). The more Sgt. Howie investigates and bullies his way around, the weirder this tale gets.<br /><br />Clearly, these folks are pagans who practice an ancient religion based on phallic worship. Lyrics to the many lovely folk songs performed by them throughout the story are incredibly bawdy, children dance naked in public, hedges are trimmed to tumescent member perfection and there's an elaborate May Pole ceremony due to culminate in ritual sacrifice. Howie's convinced its sacrificial lamb will be the missing child. He dons a giant-headed \\"Punch\\" costume and so-disguised leads the parade, all the time watchful for Rowan's appearance.<br /><br />What awaits is the Wicker Man himself and an unforgettable ending. A superb film, indeed!<br /><br />NOTEWORTHY:<br />A totally unclothed Britt Ekland-- the writhing siren who sings through her bedroom wall to a mesmerized  and nomally pious Howie. He responds to this irresistible spell by hugging his side of the wall while obviously aroused.<br /><br />Cameo as the gardener by Aubrey Morris.

B002MQYOFW|4.0|I can finally say that I have left my rock and joined the \\"in-crowd.\\" I finally read The Hunger Games. It's true that these books have been sitting on my shelves gathering dust for at least a year, maybe longer. I have no excuse to offer for why I haven't read these books until now. I knew they were great (I've heard it constantly). I've been threatened by my friends to read the books \\"or else\\"--but they always seems to forgive me. =) But, alas, I can finally say I have read them... and boy am I glad I did!<br />While I was talking with one my friends yesterday, I asked if she had read this series. She said no, but she had the books in her classroom. I snickered. (out loud) I told her I finally read these books and she needed to do it pronto. Then I explained why...<br />First, the characters. I loved how different Peeta and Katniss were. You truly get the sense that Peeta is a genuine \\"nice guy\\" that you can't help but like. He doesn't seem weak or annoying. In fact, he warms my heart and made me smile. Katniss, on the other hand, is a little rough around the edges. She's not unlikeable by any means. I really liked her. I am a sucker for books with strong female characters! (Not the typical whiny, boy crazy, hormonal nightmares that you normally read about.) The relationship between Prim and Katniss captivated me. For someone to volunteer for such horror to protect another... wow. Oh, and then there was Haymitch. Heh. He was grouchy, ornery, and an absolute riot. Maybe I wasn't supposed to like him as much as I did, but I couldn't help it.<br />I don't think there is much to say about this book since just about everyone I know has read it already. I can only offer my insights into the book that has been given so much hype. I was fascinated by the games. Since there are three books, I already knew how the games would eventually end. That wasn't a surprise, which I think took away from my experience. Somehow knowing that the two main characters survive took part of the thrill away. Of course, there were a few surprising twists to keep it interesting until the end.<br />I think it's safe to say I am pleased that I finally read this book. Did it get a 5 star rating from me? No, and that's probably because I knew too much about the book going in. This is a solid 4 (maybe a 4.5?), however. I devoured it in a day and instantly started on the second book. I can't wait to see the movie now and see how the unique characters and settings are brought to life.ay. Of course, there were a few surprising twists to keep it interesting until the end.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|Since this book is under the genre \\"young adult' I was hesitant. I am so happy that I gave it a shot. It evokes emotion in a way that lingers with you long after you've put the book down. If you read and interperate it 'literally', it will disappoint you. Maybe even depress you. Scratch that. It WILL depress you (ya know, like going to see that movie whose trailer looked deep and inspiring and ends up being painfully sad for no reason. Is it too much to ask for a happy ending these days?) If you don't put it in a box it will, first- make your life look, eh, not really all that bad and, second-make you look deep inside and ask 'what would I do'. The answer, well.......that depends on you. Btw, if you're not that 'deep' of a person (be honest, you know who you are) you won't be thrilled. Enjoy

B004ECFW94|5.0|Verdi's too long ignored Simon Boccanegra receives a smashing production in this important live broadcast production at the Metropolitan Opera in 2010.  This was the baritonial bow for the now 70 year old Placido Domingo and he impressed the world at the facility with which he transitioned from one of the world's greatest tenors in the roles of the light baritone range - a very wise decision for an artist of his caliber at this point in his singing career.  This production is elegant and meaningful and defines many of the obscure details of the libretto quite well.  Domingo is joined by Adrianne Pieczonka, the gifted Straussian soprano from Canada, as Simon's daughter (the only real female role in the cast), Marcello Giordani as the sole tenor love interest, James Morris as the elderly Fiesco, and Patrick Carfizzo as the villainous Paolo.<br /><br />The Los Angeles Opera is now staging Simon Boccanegra for its musical director Placido Domingo who stars once again in the title role.  If anything Domingo's immersion into this perplexing role is more complete now (two years later) and the voice is still blossoming on the top as well as honey-hued on the bottom.  This opera is rich is orchestral writing - some of Verdi's very finest.  And the choral writing is also some of his finest.  The opera has its plot problems, but with performances like this form the Met and the one currently gracing the stage in Los Angeles all of that is less a problem than critics create.  The opera is rich in vocal splendors and if there are no 'famous arias' as form Verdi's other works, it is only because we don't hear this grand work performed frequently enough.  Perhaps the day of Simon Boccanegra has arrived.  Grady Harp, February 12

B000WAEJZ0|5.0|The world is quiet today.  Whitney Houston, probably one of the great voices and performers and beauties of the past century, is gone. If ever there was an artist who crossed lines among blues, R&B, Soul, Jazz, Standards, and even into classical music lovers it was this great talent. She will likely always be mentioned in the same breath with Etta James, Billie Holiday, Ella Fitzgerald, and other vocal divas who made musical emotions open up for every one.<br /><br />This collection contains some of her greatest successes: I Will Always Love You,  Saving All My Love For You, Greatest Love Of All, I Wanna Dance With Somebody, One Moment In Time, How Will I Know, So Emotional, When You Believe, Where Do Broken Hearts Go, I'm Your Baby Tonight, Didn't We Almost Have It All, Run To You, Exhale (Shoop Shoop), If I Told You That, I Have Nothing, I'm Every Woman, Its Not Right, But Its Okay, and  My Love Is Your Love. It is most likely that there is not a person alive who has not connected with at least one of her inimitable creations.  Whitney Houston was a giant talent.  She will be missed: she will not be forgotten.  Grady Harp, February 12

B006VRZ5YM|3.0|WHAT'S YOU NUMBER? is a flimsy bit of fluff based on the novel '20 Times A Lady' by Karen Bosnak and transformed for the screen by Gabrielle Allan and Jennifer Crittenden. It is a very light comedy that has some observations about today's dating/quasi-relationship scene, but those impressions are a bit too true to be funny, so it is best to just concentrate on the film as a diversion of the kick back, put feet up, and giggle along with it genre.<br /><br />Ally Darling (!) (Anna Faris) has a history of having many ex-boy connections  who turned out to be losers. Reading an article that offers number amounts for judging sexual encounters (Ally has exceeded the norm) she freaks and believes that she can't find THE good guy. Deciding to reevaluate her ex-encounters searching for Mr Right, she decides to look up all of her exs to see if any of them have changed for the better. Finding this task daunting she turns to her apartment neighbor Colin Shea (Chris Evans), a would-be musician who sleeps with women every night and sneaks out the morning after to avoid relating to them, to act as her detective.  The rest is a contrived series of ups and downs of the manhunt that has few qualified candidates. And the end is predictable.<br /><br />For once Anna Faris has snagged a role that shows her talent (and fingernails-on-the-blackboard voice) and she looks terrific.  But the biggest treat in the film is Chris Evans appearing in the buff often enough to keep the movie on: not only does he enjoy his Adonis body but he seems happy allowing it to buff up an otherwise routine comedy part.  There is another attraction in the wings - Oliver Jackson-Cohen - who seems to have a future in film.  Tuck in the always reliable Blythe Danner and Ed Begley, Jr and this is a cast worth an evening's outing.  But the treat on top of the confection is the eye candy generously shared by Chris Evans.

But given a tip from a friend (and an Amazon gold box deal) I picked up Firefly on Blu-Ray, and I'm really glad I did - it was the best show I've seen in a long time.  Of course, that means it had to be canceled after one season, which is tremendously annoying because this was a story that had SO many places to go!  But I guess that's why I generally dislike TV so much!  Nice to see something worthwhile come on occasion, sorry that it didn't last!  Looking forward to checking out the movies as well.

0307891372|4.0|I ordered this book because I knew it would supply me with a broader knowledge of Skyrim. I knew it contained information for quests and was recommended by a friend to purchase it. I went to the nearest Gamestop and Target to see how much it was being sold for, I immediately walked away having no interest in paying so much for a guide book. I then proceeded to look here on Amazon and noticed how much cheaper it was in comparison so I ordered it. It arrived within the time estimated and was wonderful.

B005VSRFEA|5.0|Reading [[ASIN:B005VSRFEA Thinking In Systems: A Primer]] it is often difficult to believe that it was largely written 20 years ago, though the use in a key chapter of quotes from papers in one month of 1992 makes it clear it was. Meadows prophesises almost the whole list of growing social inequities which it would take until 2011 for the Occupy movement to provide a popular response to. But that unparalleled predictive accuracy is not what really matters about this book. More importantly, it is a text which a suitably informed teacher should be able to build a first rate course around, as for most still stuck in reductionist silos, it might need some extended context to be fully appreciated.  For somebody like me who had taken on board emergence/systems/complexity even earlier than that, it asks the question as to why we haven't been able to nudge things in more constructive directions? And it provides much of the answer. There are many ways for systems to behave contrarily to the intentions and expectations of those tweaking the controls. Meadows explains those traps at a level anybody with an open mind should be able to learn from. Obvious parallels between biological and sociotechnical evolution obscure a vital difference in time scale: standard biological platforms required countless failed variants before they succeeded while the colonising language of social victors rushes all our eggs into unvalidated baskets.  Anybody else who has been struggling to find a workaround for the difficult path to systemic understanding identified in Marcia Salner's 1986 paper, should see Thinking in Systems as a potential circuit breaker which will enable systems thinking to be introduced much earlier than the half or more of a lifetime it has taken those of us who found it the hard way.  While the editor has done an admirable job of turning notes into a book without their author to turn to, it could never be quite as finished or as evenly paced as it might have been has Meadows lived to complete it herself. Yet this might even make it more valuable, if some good teachers can get to add their own layer of interpretation and context to the basic fundamentals it lays out so clearly.

It's a fast changing area too, especially in the wake of the Consumer Credit Act 2006 and the Consumer Credit Directive implemented on 11 February 2011.<br /><br />The aim of the text, says the author Russell Kelsall, is to `help practitioners tackle consumer credit' and `whilst it may not be an easy topic to grapple with,' he adds, `it is certainly (thanks to this book) more comprehensible.'<br /><br />To smooth the practitioner's path initially, the text starts off on the right foot by defining terms - vital when you're trying to get to grips with any complicated subject.  In total there are eight pages of definitions, from \\"appropriate method\\" and \\"associate (these are complex enough) to \\"unrestricted use of credit agreement\\" and \\"working day.\\"<br /><br />These are all to be read, noted and inwardly digested if you are a consumer credit lawyer aiming for success.  Absorb all this and you're well on your way to a fuller and enhanced understanding of consumer credit issues covered in this excellent work of reference, from licencing to enforcing an agreement, termination and much, much more.<br /><br />Practical, comprehensive and up to date, the book examines in detail the legal structure of consumer credit and indeed the full spectrum of credit issues, including of course, the impact of the Consumer Credit Directive.  The twenty key precedents -- also contained in the accompanying CD ROM -- include agreements, notices, particulars of claim and defences.<br /><br />To aid your further research, there are extensive tables of cases, statutes, statutory instruments and European legislation. Advocates as well as judges will love this book, as will compliance and collection managers, or anyone involved in the consumer credit process.  The law is stated as at December 2011.as well as judges will love this book, as will compliance and collection managers, or anyone involved in the consumer credit process.

Here is yet another legal text from their stable dedicated to helping advisers solve pressing legal problems that may affect, or jeopardize the human rights of individuals; in this case suspects detained at police stations.<br /><br />The title and sub-title of this book are rather frighteningly self-explanatory and the situations involved frequently urgent, not to mention, mission-critical. Certainly, getting hauled into and detained at a police station, whether you are deserving of it or not, is the stuff of nightmare.<br /><br />This latest sixth edition, like its predecessors, comes in the wake of PACE, the Police and Criminal Evidence Act which revolutionized police investigation techniques and established firmly the right for those held in police custody to consult a lawyer, while enshrining the need for transparent  and accountable policing.<br />`In many respects, says author, Ed Cape, `it has been at the forefront of attempts around the world to ensure that the police are subject to the rule of law.'<br /><br />All well and good, but as the author also says, the need for quality representation and assistance at police stations has increased, along with a corresponding decrease in adequate funding for the task.<br /><br />`My original purpose in writing this book,' he explains, `was to help criminal defence lawyers to be clear about their role at the police station and to give them the information -- law, guidance and procedures -- to enable them to perform it effectively.'<br /><br />If you already have a previous edition of this admirable text, you need this latest one, incorporating as it does,  much new material, including an up to date version of PACE, a full set of the most recent versions of the PACE Codes and reference to all the key cases.<br /><br />Usefully - and here are some real time savers when you are in a furry - there are checklists, specimen letters, sample statements, forms and at-a-glance boxed summaries of vital information in each chapter.<br /><br />This is an authoritative, accessible and practical work which answers your questions and addresses typical problems.

0307957934|1.0|Ask yourself what you expect of a so-called technothriller, and I'm wondering, if what the author delivers will satisfy your expectations.  Not mine.  This novel is yet another piece, like most of the trash on American T.V., loaded with images and half-baked plots and subplots to the extent that confusion rules supreme over any potential for entertainment value. It seems that the mainstream still enjoys poking fun at nerdy scientists, and this novel certainly confirms what we've all heard and read about intellectual types.  They're not one of us.  They have ulterior motives that don't fit our moral compass.  They're so out of it, that even huge hoards of money don't really mean anything to them.  So, given the current climate of unbridled greed and violence in our world, what's new to report here?  I'd like to have seen at least some hint of redemption in the conclusion.  I'd like to have felt something, a-n-y-t-h-i-n-g, for the main characters.  But alas, it was not meant to be.  Still, I guess in today's parlance, too many alienated, overstimulated readers will simply take a deep breath and sigh, \\"It's all good.\\"
B005SFS4ZU|4.0|While this is an enjoyable performance of Phantom, it is also a little bit odd.  I can't for the life of me understand why they chose to stage this, a show that needs fly space, a proscenium, and wings, in a hall that has none of those things.  This production, in which the theatre itself is practically a character in the show, is a bit of a fish out of water for that reason.  The solution was to use large, low-res video screens in place of much of the scenery.  When seen in person, these probably looked pretty good, but when shot up close, as in this presentation, they look terribly pixelated and they distract from some good performances.<br /><br />Speaking of which, Sierra Boggess is a great Christine.  Her voice is much less shrill than Sarah Brightman's and her performance is top notch.  Ramin Karimloo, on the other hand, gives it the old college try, but he's miscast.  He's too slight of build and his voice is a bit too perfect.  Maybe I'm just biased.  I saw Michael Crawford perform the role on Broadway and don't think anyone else has nailed it since.  Crawford, who appears here briefly during extended curtain calls and encores, had a haunting quality and a physical presence that Karimloo simply lacks.<br /><br />Still, despite the issues, this is a good production and the music sounds as good as ever.  You owe it to yourself to see this if you've ever been a fan of Phantom, if for no other reason than to see the bits with ALW, Brightman, and Crawford at the end.  I only wish Crawford had performed that night.
B000UU4NE4|2.0|So my biggest gripe with this movie is the villains and the necessity of having three while trying to entirely build their back-story in one movie. Yes, the cheesy dance number, Peter's weird emoish attitude in general and such also didn't help but my big issue is usually the villain. Without a \\"good\\" central villain a story can easily devolve into the saintly hero destroying armies of stormtrooper-redshirt-ninjas and then they just seem kind of overpowered and lose some of the hero's character itself.<br /><br />First off, the sandman in this adaptation is not particularly inspired. His daughter is sick and so this ...\\"justifies?\\" his criminal activities. That is really his entire back-story in the film, and I find it very lackluster. It just made me feel vaguely sad, I don't want to root for him but I don't want his daughter to die. His vague emotional aspect didn't work for me and I found his scenes to be more boring than entertaining. Not to mention how he gains his powers: the idea that any scientist worth his salt would not factor in EVERY loose variable in an experiment is ludicrous. Science has not advanced to its current state with attitudes of \\"there's a bird in our billion dollar experiment that could negate our entire test...lets hope it flies away.\\" Just plain dumb.<br /><br />Second, Harry is not a terrible villain but he seems a little wishy-washy and not particularly evil beyond getting revenge for his dad. He arguably has the most character development and screen time and I did like his redemption at the end. That said, hes not much of a major villain and I can see why the filmakers decided they shouldn't have him be the only villain.<br /><br />Finally there is Venom, one of my favorite villains of all time. He is just so epic and after the way they handled Doc Ock in Spiderman 2 I was pretty excited to see their rendition of Venom. This was probably my biggest letdown of the movie. He was only in the last quarter of the film, did almost nothing besides menace Mary Jane(like EVERY other spiderman villain), and to top it all off I wasn't big on the kid from That 70's Show playing this BA villain.<br /><br />The film tries to develop all three villains almost entirely in one movie and it, in my personal opinion failed. Sandman was too emotionally charged and generally boring, Harry was ok but not able to really take on his dad's mantle as Green Goblin, and Venom was just put in to draw nostalgic fans who were ultimately let down by his short and insignificant appearance. Again this is just my opinion but that's what killed Spiderman 3 for me.ERY other spiderman villain), and to top it all off I wasn't big on the kid from That 70's Show playing this BA villain.

B006GH6IS4|4.0|Eagle Vision continues its string of great music-lovers DVDs with their release of Queen - Days of our Lives on Blu-ray.  Since the death of flamboyant front man Freddie Mercury from AIDS in 1991 Queen's popularity, remarkably, has persisted. Fox's Glee featured a show with songs from Queen. Their big hit, \\"Bohemian Rhapsody\\" had a bit of a renaissance thanks to the prominent and hilarious use in the 1992 movie Wayne's World. There was also George Michael's top-of-the-charts cover of \\"Somebody to Love\\" in 1992. American Idol reunited the band to back up the two finalists for a rendition of \\"We are the Champions\\" capping off the highly rated Adam Lambert season. Queen also toured for four years with Bad Company's Paul Rodgers to sold out stadiums around the globe.  In terms of significance however, nothing trumps Queen's induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2001. While this might not have silenced all the critics who claimed Queen was an overly theatrical version of Muzak - it certainly justifies a long form documentary.  This BBC produced 2 hour documentary will delight fans. It also makes a case for reconsidering this band of college chums who sold over 100 million records. Taking a chronological approach it visits the early days of at Cambridge and how they really took off when they added lead singer/pianist Farrokh Bulsara (aka Freddie Mercury). Freddie was lightning in a bottle and arguably one of the greatest front men in the history of rock and roll. His Live Aid performance was a master class in what it means to be a rock star.  But the story goes deeper than Mercury. Each of the four band members wrote hit songs. This is unusual. So too is guitarist Brian May's PhD in Astrophysics. Loaded with interviews old and new, this is a well paced and never boring production. Of particular interest to fans will be the interviews with reclusive bassist John Deacon. While they are old - he no longer participates in the band - they are illuminating. So too are all the interviews which are articulate and heart felt.  Make no mistake though, it is a sad story that revolves around Mercury. He was the real deal. He could write hit songs, produce, sing, and play a very accomplished piano. He was also a front man whose gayness somehow didn't diminish his power or appeal. Sadly, his death will always define the band.  So check it out - 4 stars for must see music documentary!
B004A8ZWW4|1.0|Very disappointing. The only one worth liking was the poor robot that got the crap beat out of him. By the end, I don't even like the kid, as he was more about letting the robot fight than in finding any kind of 'friend' with the robot. Like dad like son. And Jackman's character had like only 1 redeeming quality. Even in the end the kid goes back to the sister-in-law and not with Jackman. So what is the point?

B006UG909U|5.0|This CD ranks as one of their best ever. EVH sounds like he has experienced a re-birth as his sound just explodes throughout these thirteen tracks. The bass has never been more heavy or prominent in the mix, which along with AVH's blistering performance, creates a rhythm section unmatched in Van Halen history. And to top it off, DLR is back bigger and better than ever.  Guitar driven rock-n-roll is back with a vengeance!!!
0736083863|5.0|My work is either sit in front of the computer or go to meetings.  As a result, my body is always in pain when I get home.  Sometimes, my back hurted so much during the flight I had to stand at the back of the airplane so I can take the pressure off my back.  I have seen many chiropractors and physical therapists.  My last PT was a ballerina and she told me to try pilates to strengthen my body and to work on different parts of my body so I can be more flexible.  I have been following numerous exercies in the book and the exercies have improved my back pain tremendously.  Obviously, it also helped to lose some weight.<br /><br />I wish the author would create video so it would be easier for people to follow the instructions.  Neverthelss, it is a great book and I wish I had known about it 10 years ago.

B005WFWVL4|2.0|This movie started out with a bang but towards the end, it looks like somebody decided to slap something quickly together so they can rush it out the door.  The last 45 seconds of the movie is so far fetched I had to laugh out loud.  It had a chance to be a great movie but the director blew it.  So sad.
B0071T5PN0|5.0|If you were a fan of \\"classic\\" Van Halen with David Lee Roth ... you'll probably find yourself pleasantly surprised with \\"A Different Kind of Truth.\\"  It doesn't sound exactly like the orignal six albums with Roth, but it's very familiar and sits well as an updated version of their classic sound.  Eddie's playing has finally returned to form after many years, Alex is a beast throughout the album (perhaps the heaviest performance he's ever recorded), Dave's attitude, personality and one of a kind lyrical treatment are showcased again and last but not least, Wolfgang Van Halen shows that he can more than hold his own in the Van Halen rhythm section.  As a longtime fan of Van Halen (all era's) I give ADKOT five stars.  If you preferred the Sammy years, you might disagree ... but I would suggest that you give Van Halen's new album a chance, as it is a very solid effort (especially from a band many had written off years ago).

B006W0QOF2|1.0|Movie was okay, but it was not action packed or really good acting. It was just okay. I wish I had waited till it was free instead of wasting my $$ on it.
B006UG90RM|3.0|For the record, I am a HUGE Van Halen fan and have been since the release of their first album in 1978.  I liked the Hagar era, too (though not as much as the Roth era), but felt the band was going \\"pop\\" with Hagar.  And yes, there are songs on \\"Van Halen III\\" with Cherone that are worth their weight.<br /><br />\\"A Different Kind of Truth\\" seems to be lacking the naughty fun of the earlier Roth-era records.  Musically it is very layered and the production is very solid, but that wasn't what made the old VH albums good.  What's missing here is the rawness of the old VH sound.  Early VH producer Ted Templeman is sorely missed.<br /><br />Lyrically, Roth still has a playful touch and can turn a phrase like no one else.  But this time around it doesn't amount to all that much because he doesn't have much to say.  These aren't songs about partying and getting girls.  Instead, they sound more observational than motivational:  bland and generic instead of painting a picture of a good time.<br /><br />Musically, it sounds like any number of DLR's solo records.  Eddie and Alex can still play ferociously, but so could the guitarists and drummers from Dave's solo career, which is what this album is reminiscent of.<br /><br />The first cut and single is called \\"Tattoo\\" and is in fairly heavy rotation on rock radio at present, but that is by design and part of the promotional juggernaut for this record.  None of the individual songs are all that catchy or memorable (even the ones that pack a little punch) and I seriously doubt we'll be adding any of them to the Classic Rock playlist years down the road.<br /><br />It's nice to get a new record from them, but it almost sounds \\"too earnest\\".  Whatever the \\"old\\" formula was that worked so well on their earlier records is not put into use here.<br /><br />And Diamond Dave, on this outing, sounds like a human compression file.  Call him Dave.rar or DLR.zip.  In many parts of most songs on this record he tries to cram as many words as possible into the lyrics.  To sing them all, he has to have a rapid-fire delivery.  Almost every song sounds like ten minutes of lyrics crammed into three minutes of music.  Fine and dandy for him, I suppose.  No one should ever mistake Dave for someone who doesn't have a lot to say and expend every waking breath saying something.  But it makes it hard to sing along to the songs in the car when your tongue needs a varsity letter in gymnastics to stay caught up with the song's lyrics.  We can get through the choruses okay, but the verses are like machine gun fire.  When singing along takes too much effort, it gets tiring and then boring.<br /><br />Again, I absolutely LOVE Van Halen and have since they released their first record.  But this record does nothing for me except make me want to pull out \\"Fair Warning\\", \\"Women and Children First\\", and \\"Van Halen II\\" and listen to those instead of this one.<br /><br />Dave, if you have that much to say then maybe you should just write another book.<br /><br />I'll bet you a nickel that even the die-hard \\"Any Van Halen record is a great Van Halen record\\" fans will play this CD a number of times and defend it with all their might (again, they love it simply because it exists), but they'll eventually put it on the shelf and rarely listen to it again.  The old stuff was far, far better and more satisfying.<br /><br />Even the two Roth songs on \\"Van Halen Greatest Hits, Vol. 1\\" were better and more interesting than these songs.a rapid-fire delivery.

0439023513|1.0|Mockingjay is hands down the most depressing book i have ever read. First off the book is not well written! then what Collins wrote about...it was a fiasco! Why did she kill off Prim? the whole reason for the series was for her to survive. I always thought that Gale would die saving her knowing that Katniss' heart belongs to Peeta. Then we are inside Katniss' head and you see, you feel how extremely depressed she is and that depression is so engrossing that the end of the book doesn't feel like the end because your mind is still consumed with the pain you feel with Katniss. So i am left an emotional wreck trying to plow through my hw i will only do half heartedly because the other half is with katniss and the pain the Games have left her in. I am FURIOUS with the way the book ends. When Katniss is depressed there is no way that she can recover to some element of normalcy without Peeta! i was expecting...wanting the grand, sad yet electrifying moment when she is weeping over everything that's happened and Peeta comes rushing to her side and holds her and they talk for hours, make up, she professes her love for him and he her (he must do this after all the trauma he was put through--Katniss needs to be sure and so do we). Collins write about how katniss and peeta went from talking to holding eachother to eventually kissing again...this sucks. We dont feel this progress...the emotions. She tells us what happens in their relationship instead of bringing us there with them getting to know the new,changed them (they have changed--they must after all that happened, but we dont feel/see this)...thus when we finish the book we are left with all the depression still stirring in us because we have not had closure. I could go on forever about the stupid nonexistent love triangle. THen there's the rest of the book that just down right sucks. Why does Peeta never say anything? What is up with the rebels going crazy blowing up children? Katniss and Snow are now allies? wtf! it wasa stupid ending. not thought out at all. oh and WHY were they going to bring back the hunger games? and in what universe would Katniss agree to that--she said for Prim, but prim would never have wanted that! Read 1 and 2 but run away from three and make up your own ending. On the bright side--i think the Mockingjay the movie will be much better than the book--that's not say much tho.

B006W0QOF2|1.0|Gosling is a good actor, but this movie is not well put together and dragged on. It was a dissapointment for the entire family. Just a poorly written script with some secondary acting that was even worse. I say don;t waste your time watching this, as Gosling has done many other better projects. This is a Drive by!

0316010669|2.0|I've read many self-help books.  I picked up this one espcially because I have \\"The Thinker\\" personality and it usually takes me time to take in data and decipher information before I make a decision.  I can sum up the idea of \\"Blink\\" in a blink:  When it comes to making a decision, often times, there's something inborn in us that (your gut) that can make the \\"right\\" decision for you in three seconds.  So follow your gut!  On the other hand, our guts are prejudice at times, and they can lead us to make the wrong decision.  So be aware of prejudices you have before going with your gut.  The book is filled with examples wherein people made wrong judgements in a blink, such as the electing of Warren Harding as US President, New Coke and Amadou Diallo.  Although the books tells you that the right decision can easily come by you, it is short on HOW people can make the right decisions in a blink - and that's what's most disappointing of all.
B0073LWEXK|5.0|I was looking for adventure games and this was top rated, so I tried it and it deserves to be. An actual adventure with puzzles, not just different screens to find lists of hidden objects. Took me around an hour and a half with no hints but I'm fairly good at these. I enjoyed it for only two bucks!
B00027JYLC|5.0|I just want to give a few thoughts on this classic.<br /><br />The plot:  A beautiful trapeze artist tricks a rich dwarf into marrying her.  She is after his money.  She has a lover, the circus strongman, and they work together to get their hands on this dwarf's fortune.  Can this sinister plot be stopped?<br /><br />When director Tod Browning made this bizarre and controversial movie, many people were shocked, disturbed, saddened, and found it distasteful and offensive.  The movie was even banned in some countries for a long time.  A shocking movie like this in 1932 was an example of art imitating life, whether this was acknowledged or not by the general public.  After all, freakshows existed in the typical carnival/circus of the day.  Not everybody embraced them, but back in the early part of the twentieth century such shows didn't offend nearly as many people as they do or would nowadays.  They were seen as fascinating, bizarre, yet disturbing and sad attractions.  Besides that, science and medicine hadn't advanced far enough to explain the freak-like appearance of some people, so there was a general lack of knowledge, and with that comes a lack of sensitivity.  Political correctness back then was almost nonexistent when it came to what attractions carnivals and circuses offered to patrons.  For example, back then people didn't squawk nearly as much about animals being used to entertain crowds and the \\"cruelty\\" shown toward them as they do nowadays, such as with the use of elephants, tigers, lions, etc.<br /><br />You no doubt will be affected by this movie when watching it (at least I THINK you will be).  You'll feel sadness, sympathy, and anger.  You'll also laugh, feel disturbed, and find yourself hoping for the demise of the greedy couple while rooting for the freaks.<br /><br />Overall, a classic film that will never be matched again.  They don't make them like this anymore, so I recommend seeing it for its historical significance.
B006BDHAX0|1.0|don't buy this game. it locks up and has to be started over or completely shuts down in the middle of the game.  V
B005LAIGOQ|5.0|For a description of the plot, etc., read other reviews.  I just want to say a few things about this movie...<br /><br />The Woman In Black (2012) is a remake of the 1989 TV movie of the same name and based on the 1983 book by Susan Hill.  I reviewed that movie last July and gave it 4 stars.  This remake is actually better than the original, a rare feat.  From my experience, usually remakes of horror movies are nowhere near as good as the original.  This is an exception.<br /><br />The things that this movie have going for it are the dark, chilling, spooky atmosphere and the genuine creepiness of the haunted house from the Victorian era.  You'll see classic components of a haunted house - cobwebs, paintings hanging on the walls, lit candles, a rocking chair rocking by itself, creepy looking dolls, music box melodies, and of course ghosts.  Throw in the thunderstorm and the movie feels complete.  This is definitely one of the creepiest and best ghost story movies I've ever seen.  There are a lot of sudden scares that might make you jump out of your seat.  There is an occasional dose of comic relief sprinkled throughout the movie.  The musical score by Marco Beltrami is decent.<br /><br />This movie was my introduction to Daniel Radcliffe (I've never seen the Harry Potter movies).  He does a commendable job acting.  This movie is a triumphant return for Hammer Horror.  Who can forget the classic Hammer horror movies from the 1950s, '60s, and '70s?<br /><br />Overall, this is a good Victorian ghost story that I highly recommend.
B005HSG3TC|3.0|On the positive side this product is well worth the money. Keeps the fire secure in its holder. On the negative side the fold that keeps the kindle in the upright position  does not really work. You cannot get it securely into the indentation that would hold it upright. One side will go in and the other just flops. I have tried it many many times and it is always the same. All they had to do was make this part more secure and they would have a great product.

B00729GQ0A|5.0|I've read a number of books. And out of all of them, this one has become one of my new favorites.  It has a main character, Sophia, that be related to easily. Her struggles can be related to, I'm sure, by many Wiccans who have to put up with the same harassment as she did. It also shows the positive side of Wicca, which I found very refreshing. I also liked the many twists and turns that kept me from putting the book down.  I am anxiously awaiting the next books in the series.

New Moon had the same effect upon me. How could Bella treat Jacob that way? How could she choose death over being with a human, er...wolf-like being? I will not lie, I was angry when she completely blew him off in Eclipse and then teased him with a kiss. I thought there was a chance that she would begin a love affair with Jacob...but that is the background of this review.    Breaking Dawn lacked action. It lacked suspense. During the 1:45 minutes of playtime I patiently waited for something moving to happen. Little did I know was that I had to wait until the very end for anything remotely entertaining to happen. The talk of the \\"fetus\\" took over the entire movie. We see Bella, ill and sallow throughout the last hour of the movie. Jacob finally grows some balls and stands up to the leader of the group. This is a spoiler to those who have not seen the movie, but Jacob imprints on the infant! Not only has Twilight turned from a choice between beastiality and necrophilia but is on the verge of well, you know. My question is why an entire movie was wasted for Bella to give birth when at the very beginning of the movie she falls pregnant quickly after her honey moon and even quicker after that sported a large pregnant belly. Did I miss something? When Bella says \\"That's impossible,\\" it pretty much floored me too.    The acting in Breaking Dawn part 1 was poorly done. I have gotten used to Kristen Stewart's breathy responses to anything people say to her, but the movie seemed soap-operish. I am so glad I decided to just rent the movie instead of downloading it for the 14.99. With that said, Amazon, can I have my 3.99 back?
B0073LWEXK|4.0|Bought the game because it was one of the top paid apps. I was immediately immersed in the game for three hours the first night and following night trying to figure out the puzzles. The only problem that I had was that the game was incredibly short. after about five hours of play I completed all puzzles and there is no replay value because the puzzles have all been solved.
B005J4TLN4|5.0|For an Englishman living in the USA its always a breathe of fresh air when a little part of home comes to visit. This movie brings a little more than grandma with it to visit. Unplug your brains soak in the fun and meet the block. If you love English accents spliced with Alien invasions this is a must see.
B0061S073A|1.0|you have to create a code. and if ur child shuts it down it will just go back to the home page. do not get..
B0064NTZJO|5.0|As some other reviewers mentioned, this movie is kind of an homage to several 70's and 80's era flicks, but with Tarantino-esque violence.  The opening credits are pink, exactly as they were in Heathers, and the opening song (which does double duty as the closing song) is a cheesy synth-pop electronica number which sounds as though it could have been lifted right out of the 80's.  Drive is over the top, in your face cheesy, though it is also somewhat dark and very, very violent.  I loved it.  It reminded me of Tarantino's earlier movies, but with none of the anger and a lot more fun.  Great performances all around, Ryan Gosling has maybe 10 lines in the entire film and still manages to carry every scene with poignancy.  You can see what he is thinking, and IMO it is far more difficult to evoke a thought process by facial expression than it is to simply speak it.  The rest of the cast is also top notch, Albert Brooks, who I was not familiar with but apparently usually plays comedic roles, was spot on as a smarmy two-bit gangster, and it was fun to see the stars of several current TV shows in some supporting roles as well.  In summary, if you are looking for a typical cookie-cutter Hollywood action flick then go rent \\"Captain America\\" or something....this is not that sort of movie. But if you are capable of rational thought and don't need for your entertainment to be spoon fed to you in predictable, 45 second increments, then you will likely enjoy this film.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this collection is fun entertaining and cool I like the air hockey one a lot everyone should get this app
B0062KMDZ2|5.0|Now This is what 3D is all about. You'll never watch it in 2D again.  [[ASIN:B0062KMDZ2 Journey to the Center of the Earth (Two-Disc Blu-ray 3D/Blu-ray Combo)]]
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|This app is very well set up and easy to use.  I use it everyday for a lot of stuff, like reminders, a to-do list, workout tracker, etc.  I don't know what I would do without it anymore.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|it is a very fun game to play because there are lots of different. things people can do young or old
B0054JZC6E|4.0|A good way to waste time. most people complain that it doesn't give directions for the games, but if you touch the back button while in the game, and press help from the menu, it gives directions.  '
B005V2EVBQ|1.0|This is the first product ordered from Amazon that I am going to return. There are much better ones out there. I bought this because of the built in stand -- well it doesn't work. Too small of a groove. Plus it looks cheap. The cover I got for my other tablet has a magnet so it stays closed. This was has a cheap elastic band. Wonder how long that will hold up? I'm not going to wait to find out and will send this back instead.

B0061QD82E|4.0|our dog kept running to the tv trying to watching lady! I had not seen it long time & it was pretty funny a and cute to watch.
B0050XFY4O|4.0|I thought there was too much swimming and not enough intimate gay love making. I did enjoy the music in this movie and the friendship these two men had as a kid. That was wonderful. But I would of liked to see at least ten more minutes of intimate gay sex love making (that is why I watch this stuff.) That would of been enough to upgrade my rating to five stars for this movie. Despite this deficiency, this movie was very excellently made.
B001CTDH4Y|5.0|My grandchildren had the second movie but not the first.  So I got them this one for Valentine's Day.  Great movie.  Great service
0385484518|5.0|I cried when I read this book, and I never cry. Don't put it off. Get it, read it, and learn from Morrie Schwartz.

1400069289|5.0|Working in Market Research I absolutely LOVED reading the stories in this book, the predictive models, the habits of consumers, GREAT stuff!  The stories of Febreeze and Target and Saddleback Church - LOVE that stuff!    But this book is more than that.  In a lot of ways you can use it as your own personal self-help book.  The author Charles Duhigg steps you through the process of catching yourself in your habit loop and re-designing a better habit loop.  Do you even know you have a habit loop?  It's comprised of three pieces - the CUE, the ROUTINE and then the REWARD.    You can not QUIT a habit, you have to replace it just so - almost like a surgery.  Keep this piece and this piece and swap out that piece.  This is your cookbook to do so.  It covers the gambit, the way you talk to your kids (powerful message that includes Howard Schultz, Starbucks, about how his mom spoke to him - hint:  ...\\"You're going to make us all proud...\\"); Gambling, Eating, you name it, the book has your habit covered.  Duhigg goes on to explain Habits in our company cultures and then Habits in our society.  This is a very interesting book, well worth reading.  And if you need more on his website where he continues to write about habits: [...]
B0054JZC6E|5.0|i love this game. very entertaining! !!!!! i like this game because there are many many different games that you can play. some easy, some hard, but very fun
B004XNGKBS|5.0|The app far exceeded my expectations.  I have used Penultimate on iPad2 and on Android 2.3 on HTC Flyer, as well as the new Boogie Board Rip.  This app on Kindle Fire works better than all three.  The only thing better is actual pen and paper.
B002VKE17U|4.0|I've only seen it on dvd but I really can't imagine this would've been a satisfying theater-going experience for me. It's right up my alley, viruses or zombies or post-apoclyptic nightmare, etc. But it's also really another genre I love, emotional dramas. I didn't know much about it when I bought it but I'm glad I wasn't expecting a zombie horor film, it's a more personal drama about the four main characters.<br /><br />No plague set-up or explanation, we're dropped right into the middle of the aftermath in the beginning of the film. There's a lot of cliched behavior from other post-apoc movies. The reckless driving, the drinking and who gives a s*** attitude towards life, the gas rationing and (my least favorite part), the golf course montage.<br /><br />Would I behave that way? I never can decide. I might be like a kid in a candy store, or paranoid hyper-vigilant beyond my wits. The characters seem to let their guard down too often, another cliche. The diving board scene for instance.<br /><br />But the actors and the characters rise above the cliches, a great performance by Chris Meloni as well. I still had questions throughout about the disease and especially the spreadability of it, but oh well. Re: my title, it does work well as a small screen drama. It's more low-key than a Resident Evil, or The Crazies or 28 Days Later. As long as you're ready for that, and maybe like my sister you can't stand the \\"Dawn of the Dead\\" guts-eating(!) then this may be for you too.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|it is very very good! no matter what anyone says u should get it.don't pay the 99 cents its a waste of money they r the exact same thing!!!!!!!!!!if u buy anyone it should be the HD version. T.T.Y.L&lt;3
B003XIO7ZK|3.0|It would appear as though Grave Digger peaked with the 5-star \\"Ballads of a Hangman.\\" If you like the group's rough-hewed power metal sound, though, go ahead and pick it up. It compares somewhat favorably to \\"Liberty Or Death\\" although there's nothing as good as \\"Silent Revolution\\" on it. Domain's former lead guitarist has replaced the two guitarists that helped make \\"Ballads of a Hangman\\" so special. The latter was undoubtedly their most melodic effort.
B003H6KRIE|4.0|I love the movies.  But this Blu-Ray edition was poorly authored in some way.  A lot of functions like forward and reverse are disabled at times when they should not be.  The pause mode times out too quickly even for a bathroom break (while another movie I bought holds in pause for many hours).  A pause timeout and other functions ends up in a \\"no man's land\\" mode which just shows the \\"Universal\\" logo.  Going to the menu is locked out here (that's really stupid authoring).  The \\"play\\" button seems to not work, although it really does ... it just takes 45 seconds for it to actually do anything (be patient and you won't have to eject and re-insert).  Their excuse ... you need to upgrade your firmware.  BS ... my player works fine on many other movies.
B0071QIN00|3.0|This game is great to pass the time or just to play for run, but the physics engine need to improve because there's moments where jumps don't work correctly. Plus, the ramps don't angle well and sometimes you can fall through ramps and platforms. But overall, i rate this game a 3.
B0055SWM08|5.0|I love this game. It challenges and is very fun all in one. I also have enjoyed the peaceful music included in the game.

0385534639|5.0|I was skeptical of this book as I began to read it and then started to fall in love. I went back and read the book again because I loved the story so much. It is extremely creative. For every nook and cranny the magicians have so too does the author when introducing new ideas, characters, and developments. Very well written and it will capture your attention for hours.
B006O3MU96|4.0|This isn't really a game in my opinion. This is a DLC of the original, Doodle Jump. Real Networks Inc needs to mane a Doodle Jump Seasons! This also lacks customization... but it is a REALLY good game.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This game is my favorite out of the the apps I have. I visit everyday and I spend at least a hour on it everyday.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|this game is like the king and queen of games  I tell u its awesome totally its royalty  all stars all I said it all stars
B005ILYWN2|4.0|It's just great entertainment, some dry humor, and some action.  I had a great time watching it.   It seems clever while not taking itself serously.  Well worth the time if your in the mood to be entertained.
B0024RIMBG|5.0|Awesome. Worth every penny. I've watched it 7 times in 2 weeks. I love their version of Somewhere Over the Rainbow.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this game is really fun but when u win a game u should earn a new but u have to win the games before they let u play more
B0064X7FVE|5.0|This one is better than accuweather for android.  That one kept shutting down on me and would always drain the battery.  The weather channel app works good and has everything the other one does.  It stays shut down until I open it unlike the other one.  Very easy to use and works perfect!
B004RJMUJO|5.0|this is the best game I could ever name. the only thing is for the kindle fire it doesn't have all of the blades and backgrounds possible, but the ipad and iphone always does, so does the free version. but this one is much faster and add free
B0063IH60K|5.0|an excellent app. this program is an excellent way to pass a little time. I will definately look into their other games.
B004UID2LC|1.0|the downloader is very fast but it stops right in the middle of a video and says something about stopping unexpectedly or something. LOOK AT THIS COMMENT BEFORE DOWNLOADING. ON THE KINDLE FIRE!!!!!!!!!!!!&iexcl;
B005LL4U54|5.0|Since the day the CD of \\"The Artist\\" arrived, I have played it and played it so many times, I've lost count! I absolutely LOVED the movie and the music? C'est manifique!!!  Just beautiful!  If the Oscar voters have an ounce of brains, \\"The Artist\\" will SWEEP each and every category they're in, especially Actor (Ah, mon ami!) and music.  Get on amazon.com and order your copy of the \\"Artist\\" CD.  Just beautiful!
B0071QIN00|4.0|Downloaded this app to play for a quick minute or two every once in a while and it fits the bill. Levels aren't terribly challenging but you'll want tobplay them for than once so that you can experiment with backflips and frontflips. Great free app of the day!

0345472322|4.0|Mindset by Carol Dweck presents the psychology of success--and it is simpler than you think.  Being successful is a by-product from having a growth mindset.  People with a growth mindset believe that things can improve.  They believe that they can overcome a problem or work themselves out of a difficult spot.  The fixed mindset is one where you do not believe things will get better.  In the fixed mindset, there is no hope, and as a result, it is hard to be successful.<br /><br />In this book Dweck writes about interesting case studies and demonstrates her points through business, sports, and education.  Through compelling story telling, she shows that is possible to have a growth or fixed mindset depending the situation--she also gives some pointers on how to move from a fixed mindset to a growth one.<br /><br />Main Points:  Recognizing and adjusting your mindset is the first step to success.  Everyone has multiple mindsets (how you approach work, your family, spouse, children, exercise, weight loss, etc.).  Your current mindset in any situation can be altered (from fixed to growth and growth to fixed).

0446572764|5.0|I have studied Russian history and literature for forty years.  This young author has accomplished something only Umberto Eco had done before with NAME OF THE ROSE:  namely, he puts you THERE.  You will step into Stalin's 1950's Russia, and you will see it as you could not have even imagined that life could exist.  You will smell the fear that permeated all of Russian society of that time.  Into the midst of that, you will plunge, as Smith's characters do, into a maelstrom of deceit and murder, but not just murder, the murder of children.  Many, many children.  This book is gripping.  This book is haunting.  This book is brilliant.  It is difficult to believe that it came from the pen of a first author still in his twenties.  For one of the greatest reads in all of crime and suspense writing, as well as bell-perfect historical accuracy -- I'll take this one every single time.  I have also read both of his sequels, and one can only hope that Tom Rob Smith will have a long, long career, indeed!
B00004CZA7|1.0|The movie dangerous minds I bought sucked it wont play in my dvd player it is apparently for another country don't by movies from here they don't work
B0067Q42BY|5.0|I am hooked on this game. very entertaining, relaxing, and keeps the mind alert! Like the music, sound effects. and story that goes along with the game. I downloaded the free version, then paid for the full version. I don't normally pay this much for a game app but well worth the price!!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is fun and amazing its fun to beat levels so you can get more coins its also very addicting I cant stop playing I love it
B0055SWM08|5.0|I hadn't played a game on a video screen since &quot;Pong&quot;, despite owning numerous PCs, laptops, smartphones, and tablets. Got Quell on a whim and, despite currently owning each of the aforementioned, on my Kindle Fire of all things.  Took me a while before I tried it, but now it tempts  my attention as much as those books I've spent too much money on. I find it relaxing and challenging without being frustrating. Now that I'm thinking about it, Quell has hypnotic, soothing traits in common with the simplistic Pong.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this game is really cool....it is able to keep my kids intertained on long rides home I like the variety it provides
B0058VW36U|1.0|I have played this for a while, and on the first levels it was addicting, but as you go into harder levels, it gets boring.
B004S49YVU|3.0|I mostly agree with the other reviewers - the plot gets slowed or even derailed at times by excess information. However, I still finished it and liked it for what it was. It's one of those books with a fantastic concept, but not the best story execution.
0439023513|3.0|Loved the first the two books, but as most series go, the farther in you get, the worse it gets (ie; Twilight). This is not the book it should be based on the first two, and a sloppy tie it all together in the end in my opinion.
B0055SWM08|5.0|good puzzle game. the difficulty curve is perfect. perfect to play before going to sleep. i easily would have payed over a dollar for quell
B005EGXNLS|5.0|I eagerly await every new Cornwell book and I'm never disappointed.  His ability to transport the reader back to another place and time is remarkable.

B006OAB3ME|2.0|I sat and watched the Ed Sullivan shows with family: neighborhood kids ran outside afterwards and formed some 5 Beatles bands. I always wanted to be Paul McCartney. There was a point at which I didn't go ga ga at every single Beatles song. I looked back over the years and their changes which always influenced the worldwide music scene. I remember saying at one point: 'it wouldn't have mattered at one point what they sang and played; it would be successful.' I bought the first 'McCartney' album twice, one to play and one to save sealed to pass on to my son, whom I didn't yet have. Turns out at twelve he loves the Beatles. Listens to nothing else. He and I listened to \\"Kisses on the Bottom\\" and agreed, Paul McCartney finally just put something out there which required almost no effort. There are many better renditions of all of the covers. I wouldn't think he is hurting for money but I think he felt compelled to do something. Made me sad. Now when I run out into the street to form Beatles bands I am going to be George Harrison; God rest his soul.
B005Q1W0ZQ|5.0|Just finished watching season 1 and 2 of Downton Abbey on bluray dvd discs.  No comparison to watching on PBS which is not in high definition.  Absolutely beautiful in it's clarity.  This is the best television series I have ever seen.  Cannot wait to view season 3, however, would prefer to watch it in high def.  So it will be back to Amazon again for the purchase.  Thank you Amazon for making these treasures available.

B004VQFQ2Q|5.0|Born Again is one of the last Black Sabbath albums I've gotten around to after being a fan of their early work for years.  Once I moved on from holding onto the Ozzy era, I found myself blown away by the Dio albums.  From there, I started listening to the releases with Tony Martin, and was greatly impressed by those efforts.  Now I'm finally discovering the wonders of Deep Sabbath, the combination of the band's three original musicians and the legendary voice of \\"Smoke on the Water\\" himself, Ian Gillan.  In a way, I'm glad I got to know the other eras of Sabbath before Born Again.  I don't know if I would have appreciated it as much before gaining a true appreciation for the many phases of Tony Iommi's career.  Being able to fully enjoy the Tony Martin albums, some of which do not feature Geezer Butler, and none of which has Bill Ward, it's easy to be excited about an album that reunited the original guitarist, bassist, and drummer back in '83 for one last go-around.  In fact, I'm once again blown away by how awesome Black Sabbath was at many points in their post-Ozzy career.<br /><br />Born Again has a sinister tone that reminds me of albums like the first one and Sabbath Bloody Sabbath.  Most of Ian Gillan's lyrics are markedly different from usual Sabbath fare, and the music itself sounds more Dio-era, but the atmosphere is dark and murky, the attitude uncontrolled, eccentric, and mean.  Born Again is unpredictable, an angry statement at a tough point in Iommi's run with Sabbath.  Sure, you get monumental riffs, classic solos, and other hallmarks of the traditional Sabbath sound, but there's a feel of danger to the songs, a sense of reckless abandon.  The opener Trashed sets the tone with a powerhouse, up-tempo heavy metal edge, and lyrics about Gillan getting drunk and crashing Bill Ward's car, which actually happened.  So, yeah, danger, unpredictability, attitude...elements not found on a Black Sabbath album since the early \\"occult\\" days, or the cocaine-fuelled Vol. 4 and S.B.S.  Another song, Disturbing the Priest recalls old Sabbath, with Gillan laughing maniacally over doomy Iommi riffing, and familiar lyrical territory about good and evil.  It also channels the thumping pulse of Heaven and Hell.  The title track is becoming one of my favorite Sabbath songs, period; it's a true Sabbath epic with amazing Iommi guitar work, rocked-out, bluesy rhythms from Butler and Ward, and vintage vocals from Gillan.  Rockers Zero the Hero, Digital Bitch, and Hot Line add to the Deep Sabbath feel, with Blackmore-inspired riffs, trademark Iommi solos, and that classic voice that's so familiar from the golden years of Deep Purple.  Album closer Keep It Warm showcases Gillan's 70's-era style the most prominently, finishing the album with a strong reminder that Born Again combines two of the most important forces of rock music from the decade gone by.  This is a unique album that I'll be savoring for many years, and I now count myself among those who wish this incarnation of Black Sabbath could have produced a lot more music.<br /><br />Also, a word about the Deluxe Edition.  It's incredible!  The bonus disc has an unreleased gem from the Born Again recording sessions, a track called The Fallen, which happens to be a great heavy rock song.  There's an extended version of Stonehenge, and then you get some incredible live recordings from the Reading Festival in '83.  Gillan sounds amazing on War Pigs, Iron Man, and Paranoid, and he gives a spine-tingling performance on Black Sabbath.  Hot Line, The Dark, Zero the Hero, and Digital Bitch represent Born Again with thunderous power and energy.  And the real keeper is Black Sabbath's rendition of the aforementioned all-time hard rock/heavy metal classic, Smoke on the Water.  The audience clearly loves it, bellowing every lyric along with Gillan and rocking out as hard as a crowd possibly can.  It's an obvious must-have for any true fan of Black Sabbath.Vol. 4 and S.B.S.

B004XJRQUQ|5.0|This trilogy was one of the best books I have read in a long time.  Others have said it, but I'll say it again, once you start you just can't put it down!  I read all 3 faster than I have ever read a book before.  I felt ginuenly invested in the lives of Katniss and Peeta and all those surrounding them.  Maybe this was written for the teen market, but I'm over 30 and really enjoyed it.  Now with the movie coming out in a few months, I think I may have to re-read the first book before I see the movie.  Very good reads, totally enjoyed them.
0738711500|5.0|No matter where I look, I am never envious of other people's tarot decks. Why? Because I have this one. Easy Tarot has the most lush, colorful, bold, and attractive deck. Gorgeous pictures, gorgeous coloring - if you've ever had a hard time memorizing what was what, DEFINITELY get this deck! The meanings of each card are in the pictures, and soon it'll be very easy for you to do tarot readings without the book.  What I love most about this set, besides the deck, is how straight-forward the explanations are. The steps are detailed, but allow room for your own interpretation as the situation calls for. Plus, it also teaches you different ways of doing readings, from simple to complex. It's tarot for everyone, really.  Tarot to me isn't just fortune-telling, it's also psychology. Tarot cards are as personal as you make it - if there ever was an art of deduction, like a science of deduction, tarot cards would be it. This set is definitely the best place to start; even if you're discouraged at first, you never quite forget how beautiful tarot is.

B0006N2EZ0|5.0|This being written right after Whitney Houstons tragic death.  No matter who you are or the color of your skin, you will love her and Costner's performance and interaction(s).  The movie shows the balance of high profile people, between trying to have normal life and the reality of why they cannot.  This movie was the best work Houston had as a movie star.  It's how I will always remember her, with that moving and powerful voice and sense of bottom line reality that God exists.  The torment is over...and now the fans of what she once was: \\"Will always love (and remember)...\\"  The Body Guard is Whitney Houston.  It is her role of immortality.
B001FB5634|4.0|This movie is based on a book by Cormac McCarthy. He also wrote \\"No Country for Old Men,\\" which was made into a movie starring Tommy Lee Jones about a ruthless sociopath who works for a drug cartel. So I started watching \\"The Road\\" knowing that this movie was likely to be fairly dark, but also worth my time. I was right. Viggo Mortenson did a fantastic job, as did the young boy who played his son, Kodi Smit-McPhee. It was remarkable to me how much the boy looked like his film mother, Charlize Theron who lights up the screen and always picks outstanding movies.  In short, a hauntingly beautiful movie that shows grit and dreariness but also love. The actors did a fine job. Watch for Robert Duvall as an old man with rheumy eyes and Guy Pearce with long hair and bad teeth.

B001EC3JME|2.0|A coworker of mine has one of these holsters and it stays secure on his belt so I ordered one with my Maglite XL200. Unfortunately, The holster I got started popping off the belt clip every time I brushed against something. The second day I had it, I was walking through the plant, where I work, and I noticed it was gone. I backtracked everywhere I had worked that day but could not find it. My coworker hasn't had any problem with his so I am assuming I received a dud.
B00466HNHM|5.0|RIP. Goodbye to Whitney. We will always love you. The greatest love of all is your voice. The voice of many generations.

B004FPXJOK|1.0|Don't be fooled into buying &#34;The Essential Whitney Houston&#34;.  As is Sony's practice, it is merely a repackaged version of &#34;Whitney: The Greatest Hits&#34;, which, as everyone knows, was a shambles due to the pointless and abundant remixes on the second disc.<br /><br />Now that she's no longer with us, let's hope that for the domestic market, Sony does more than just give us a rehash like this one.  Her memory deserves better.<br /><br />If you buy a version of this, make sure it is the version which spells out the title in ALL CAPITAL LETTERS.  This version is made in the EU, and is superior to all other versions.
B005HSL626|1.0|I got this awesome game but when I want to play it goes back to the home setting on my kindle fire!!also it makes kindles crash so just don't buy the free version buy the paid one instead way more better without crashing,adds,,and other garbage.
B0051UP5NQ|5.0|This is the answer to document editing between my devices. The dropbox integration was a dream come true. I can edit forms on my pc, aces and edit on my android phone and kindle fire.great job.
B005LCYR7Y|5.0|I am not keen on horror books so this is the first Stephen King book that I have read.  I love the fantasy of time travel stories so when I heard that King had written something in that genre I downloaded a Kindle sample to see what it was about. After reading the sample I was hooked!<br /><br />Stephen King has written a well crafted and extremely well researched book about the Kennedy era and about Lee Harvey Oswald in particular. He gave me a fascinating insight into the US of the early 1960's. At the same time he weaved a very creative and enthralling time travel plot around real and fictional characters. The epilogue showed how well he was able to bring the whole complex story to a conclusion.<br /><br />My only complaint is that the current Kindle pricing in Australia has doubled since I bought my copy because the price is now set by the publisher. I could buy a print version at my local discount department store for less than the current Kindle price.
B005LFQRTC|5.0|I just received this dvd collection, and I must say it reminds me of my childhood when I had my stepbrother Jeff's second hand SMDM action figure! This series is even better than I remember, a fantastic memory trip back to the good ol' days! Thanks to the powers that be for the long awaited dvd release of the entire series! It was a long time in coming. The absense of the bionic sound effect lends credibility to his super strength. The sound effect was great, but not really necessary. Thanks, Time Life for this release. Look foreward to Season 2!
0345533054|5.0|I love his books, I totally recommend it. All of them. You can keeo reading the book without stopping :)
B0054JZC6E|5.0|great ap, I got so addicted to beat each game that I could not stop, 5 out of 5 stars for it.
B002BWP49C|5.0|After being dragged to the first three movies, I already knew that any Twilight Saga movie was going to have both good and bad parts for a guy. The bad is usually the excessive amount of cheesy romance and the stalkerish way that Edward treats Bella and the good is, of course, the awesome vampire action as they deal with whatever threat is the latest to come Bella's way.<br /><br />This movie was different. It seems that the directors and producers have finally found a way to bring the best of both worlds together. There was enough romance to make even a guys eyes tear but enough action to hold our interest through the whole thing. This movie was amazing. Well written, well directed, well acted. If this is what Twilight can be then I am truly sad to see the series coming to an end.
B006UG90RM|5.0|I have been waiting for this album to be released since DLR returned and man, am I pleased! This album rocks. It has the original powerhouse rock which made Van Halen one of the greatest rock bands ever. It is a welcome return for us old rockers who grew up in the 70's. I have been listening continuously since purchasing it and like it better with each listening. Van Halen is certainly on the right path, and I hope will continue their drive throughout the upcoming tour. If you like REAL rock, do yourself a favor and purchase this album!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I thought that this game had challenging games but was extremely fun at the same time.  I think that anyone looking for a way to waste time.....this is the game for you!

B005I6EU7U|5.0|I purchased this cover in the hopes of fooling my toddler into thinking my Kindle Fire is a book.  Mission accomplished!  But, I have to admit that it is more beautiful in person.  The picture is an accurate depiction, but does not really do the product justice.  I've already had plenty of comments on it and made recommendations to everyone I know who has a Kindle.  Love this cover!
B0063IH60K|5.0|wife has this game on her Kindle Fire and I have it on my Asus Transformer Prime.  We both get many hours of enjoyment from playing the this game.  Recommend this game to everyone/

B0054JZC6E|5.0|This app has a good variety of games and is a great time waster. I have not had any issues on the kindle fire.
B004XVMCPI|5.0|I must say this is a unique film. It's filled with a whimsical sense of humor with moments of genuine pathos, emotion and excitement. Basically this combines some of the best of sports movies and martial arts movies and spoofs them both.<br /><br />Ostensibly set in 1980's China, a half dozen former shaolin monks are brought together by a sincere and idealistic young leader and taught by their coach, a former star player also down on his luck after he threw the game for a corrupt boss and got his leg broken by a mob. Stephen Chow's lead character knows little more in life than kung fu, but tries to make the lives of people around him better including that of a young woman who bakes sweet buns he chances to meet one day.<br /><br />The film is short, doesn't take itself too seriously, and is full of great lines and lots of fun wire work and special effects. I can't say much more about this film except that it has to be seen to be believed. There are also lots of references to other blockbuster films like the Matrix, Jurassic Park and Saving Private Ryan sprinkled throughout.<br /><br />The action is slapstick and there's a quick moment where one of the players gets his clothes blown off in comic fashion (only seen from the back for a second), so it's for more mature audiences with a good sense of humor.<br /><br />There are few modern movies like Shaolin Soccer. Even the follow-up \\"Kung Fu Hustle\\" just didn't charm me like this one did. So without spoiling it further, I encourage you to go watch it and see what you think!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I love the games but there is only a few problems when you finish a game you are not allowed. to simple. hit reply
B003V6L94Q|3.0|This was a good cd but some of the songs were just plain bad IMO.  There is no plastic cd Jewel case with any of the CD's I have purchased from Amazon,  WHY?  This like the others came in a fold open \\"card\\" with a pocket for the cd,  It does not fit in my CD rack or case and will not stay in the holder in my truck.  Had to buy some cases from the local store to protect the CD's properly.
B005T87QCI|3.0|I bought this on my kindle fire and it isn't that fun. the controls are confusing and annoying, there is almost no customization, and the game needs cleaning up.  I wouldn't recommend buying it.
B0063IH60K|5.0|easy controls. no lag. great version of classic solitaire. also downloaded spider solitaire from same company. equally as good. highly recommend to all.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game rocks I mean I was playing it yesterday and I was like swaggggi ran out of points tho so I don't kno wat to do
B0052REUW0|3.0|Pinker deserves a medal for writing this huge book, as does anyone who finishes it. It's a lot of work. And it's quite optimistic. He maintains that human  on human violence has been decreasing steadily, even in the last century with its world wars, genocides, and gulags. It sounds plausible as to industrialized countries, but I have questions and reservations.<br /><br />Data on war-related mortality in the past are unreliable. In 1258, a Mongol army conquered Baghdad, with great slaughter. Pinker cites the traditional figure for deaths, 800,000, in his discussion of medieval war. However, such ancient numbers are usually massively exaggerated. Modern estimates run to 100,000-200,000. Similar uncertainties apply to estimates of populations and deaths associated with slave trading and the European conquest of the Americas.  Perhaps mortality was much less than Pinker's sources assert. Who knows?<br /><br />In one long, long chapter, Pinker discusses the frequency of wars. A common sense idea of randomness says that random means regular. If 50% of the coin tosses are heads and 50% tails, heads and tails should roughly alternate. In fact, random events clump together. So hitting streaks and slumps in baseball are just the results of randomness and by themselves don't mean anything. Pinker uses this to show that the apparent explosion of war in the 20th century is normal randomness and not a sign of any larger trend. However, if war's frequency is random, then the long peace in which the industrial world now finds itself could just be a chance event, too. Events could result in a large European war as easily as they did in 1914.<br /><br />Here's an example from the period when Yugoslavia broke up. Serbia attacks Kosovo, whose people are Muslim, and who are supposedly mistreating the ethnic Serb minority. The Great Powers do nothing.  The Turks are unhappy that their fellow Muslims are being slaughtered and begin helping clandestinely. The fighting spreads to Macedonia, which is next to Kosovo, because the Serb minority is being mistreated as those in Kosovo were.  This brings Serbia to the border of Greece. Turkey and Greece dislike each other, having fought a war 1919-1922, with accusations of atrocities on both sides. Greece will not tolerate Turkish influence in Macedonia and Kosovo and also intervenes.  Bulgaria also intervenes to resist the Turks and the Greeks.  All of these countries were involved in several wars in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.  Turkey and Greece are both NATO members. Who knows what Russia would do? This sort of possibility, not sentimentality, explains whu NATO intervened.<br /><br />The governments of all significant powers are probably constantly studying scenarios similar to this. E.G., if Israel attacks Iran and Iran retaliates by attacking the Persian Gulf, and the US defends against the Iranian attacks, and Iraq allies with Iran against Israel and Egypt repudiates its peace treaty with Israel, what happens? What if Pakistan and India go to war and use their nuclear weapons? What will China's attitude be? What if North Korea attacks South Korea or just collapses into anarchy? This sort of thing is readily imaginable and keeps diplomats awake worrying. Perhaps the long peace is just an illusion and a statistical anomaly.<br /><br />If you look at Pinker's footnotes, you see he relies on only a few sources for most of his data. This is understandable because he is writing outside his filed and hasn't had a chance to master everything about history I was disturbed that his source for one piece of information was a Wikipedia article. This is OK for a term paper, but not for a serious work of scholarship.<br /><br />He even speculates that human evolution is responsible for the peaceful nature of humanity.  But many accounts of war tell us that combat turns nice, ordinary young men into brutal killers, as savage as anyone in the Stone Age. They do what it takes to survive. So, if we have become more peaceful, it's more likely due to changes in our circumstances.cumstances.
B000HF6ZR0|4.0|I think that this movie is underrated. It had good acting, good actors and actresses. They story moved right along. The premise is from current science. The suspense increases and brings out the various characters personalities and how they each attempt to deal with each other, control and the unknown. I enjoyed it and it is a bit like a horror movie. The lost of your faculties to determine what is real is a scary thing to lose. The book is better of course.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|the game is fun and I love that there are games within the game which makes you wanna keep playing. Also since you need to unlock the other games you have something to work for.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|This is a great app and works great on the kindle fire.  I love the great variety of games it has on it.  Although there is just one thing that really bothers me.  Those stupid ads!  I hate them!  Whenever I'm choosing a game I want to play they just pop up and then I have to close them.  Other than that its an awesome app.
B0073LWEXK|5.0|This is my favorite game yet. I haven't enjoyed a game this much since the Secret of Grisly Manor. Blows away other point and click games. Fire Maple, keep 'em coming!
B004LWZW4M|3.0|With spectacular special effects, inspired set designs, sharply cut action sequences and a rather surprising performance given by a CGI monkey, `Rise of the Planet of the Apes' is shockingly well executed.  I, for one, was pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed this film, especially since that 2001 debacle directed by Tim Burton was enough to scar me for life.<br /><br />The basic premise is that, in an attempt to find a cure for Alzheimer's, a group of scientists create a smarter, craftier, deadlier breed of apes.  This, obviously, was not intentional, and the deadlier aspect was a developed quality thanks to human beings inability to perform acts of kindness that are not steeped in selfish pursuits (unless you are James Franco).  When the project goes awry, the apes are all euthanized, all except a newborn monkey named Caesar.  Caesar grows into a genius monkey, but he is still a monkey and humans just don't understand monkeys enough to except them as equals and so they are rash in their decisions and thus, Caesar is eventually mistreated and hardened and soon, as can be expected, the apes begin to `rise'.<br /><br />This is obviously a prequel to the famed films starring a young Charlton Heston.  Thankfully, while the film ends just as the uprising is set to begin, `Rise of the Planet of the Apes' never feels like it isn't telling the whole story.  Sure, it is only the beginning and yet it does feel complete.<br /><br />My issue with this film lies solely in the scripting.  Sadly, the dialog and human situations are just plain stupid, unbelievable and careless.  Franco's character and his job situation makes little sense, and the caricature treatment of `evil men with power' is insulting and unrewarding, and rather disappointing when you consider the advanced technical aspect of the film and the fact that this really could have, and should have, been a deeper and more tightly orchestrated project.<br /><br />This could have been amazing.<br /><br />I'm sort of over James Franco too.  Remember back in the early-mid 2000's when his name meant `walk away from the theater'?  Then 2008 hit and all of a sudden we were all blindsided by this string of performances (`Milk', `Pineapple Express', `127 Hours') that we never saw coming and his name became linked with an `it boy' status that the world wanted to investigate.  Yeah, that time has passed and his name now denotes an eye roll from myself and many that I know.  He's back to bad acting again.  But Andy Serkis is rather brilliant here in his deep portrayal of Caesar.  The way he inserts so many notable emotions into this monkey, and the way that he gradually develops his every changing persona is very impressive.<br /><br />So, I recommend this.  Not many will expect this to be smart, and so what you get will be more than you bargained for, since as an action film this really excels.  The opening and closing sequences alone are some of the best action scenes I've seen in a long time, and the way that the sequences are editing (sharp, close but never chaotic to the point of obscured) is just genius!<br /><br />I just really wish the script itself were up to par with the film's vast technical marvels.ly-mid 2000's when his name meant `walk away from the theater'?

B005GSY23M|4.0|I want to say first if you buy the entire album it does have every track. So i saw the movie not knowing what to expect. And i just loved it. The music def made the movie. It is obvious if you don't like 80's music this is not for you. My only complaint about the album is some tracks are just ambient sounds. Which is why i am only giving it four stars.If you liked the movie this is a no brainer.

0891419195|5.0|I recently finished The War, a Ken Burn's documentary series on World War 2, which was excellent, and my ears pricked up when he mentioned a book by an enlisted Marine, E. B. Sledge, this is my response to that book, With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa. In fact, the library offered me a 2007 reprint with the endorsement of Ken Burns. The documentary mentioned that Sledge suffered from PTSD for most of his life after the war, though his book barely mentions his post-war life, excepting a few mentions of nightmares. His book, although highly valuing the esprit de corps of the Marines and the love for his fellow soldiers, wants us to know the depravity of humanity which he witnessed in the Pacific theater in two significant battles in which no quarter was offered by the Japanese and was barely offered by the US, since most Japanese offering to surrender used it as a ruse for suicide missions. Sledge is honest about his hatred for his enemies even though he seems to be a man of faith, and this intrigued me.<br /><br />After his thorough training as a Marine, in contrast to those later recruits toward the end of the war, he and his squad were settling in for their last night on a rear base before heading out for the invasion of Peleliu. He writes,<br />\\"It was hard to sleep that night. I though of home, my parents, my friends - and whether I would do my duty, be wounded and disabled, or be killed. I concluded that it was impossible for me to be killed, because God loved me. Then I told myself that God loved us all and that many would die or be ruined physically or mentally or both by the next morning and in the days following. My heart pounded, and I broke out in a cold sweat. Finally, I called myself a damned coward and eventually fell asleep saying the Lord's Prayer to myself.\\" p. 50<br />Unlike Louis Zamperini of Unbroken, see my earlier book response. Sledge enters the war with faith and finds it challenged. Throughout his most stressful periods in the two great battles of Peleliu and Okinawa he mentions holding onto his courage and sanity by praying the Lord's Prayer or reciting Psalm 23. He seems to have retained his faith, as \\"damned\\" is the dirtiest word used in the book. Even when referencing SNAFU, he defines the acronym as Situation Normal, All Fouled Up. Sledge does not need to enhance the shock and horror of war by quoting the paint blistering expletive tirades of fellow soldiers, in fact, they would distract from the terror that Sledge presents in an almost technical and analytic way.<br /><br />Like Zamperini, who saw angels in the sky and heard a voice from heaven, as he drifted around in the Pacific Ocean, Sledge also heard from God, directly and audibly. After confessing his terror, and the shame of it, to an officer during the Pelelieu campaign, he was reassured.<br /><br />Fear dwelled in everyone, Hillbilly said. Courage meant overcoming fear and doing one's duty in the presence of danger, not being unafraid....<br />Suddenly, I heard a loud voice say clearly and distinctly, \\"You will survive the war!\\"<br />I looked first at Hillbilly and then and then at the sergeant. Each returned my glance with a quizzical expression on his face in the gathering darkness. Obviously they hadn't said anything.<br />\\"Did y'all hear that?\\" I asked.<br />\\"Hear what?\\" they both inquired. p. 91<br />I think it is brave of this modern writer to casually mention his supernatural encounter with God. This heavenly promise did not give him anything extra in the midst of his campaigns, but let us know that his survival, his evasion of the law of averages, was more than skill or luck, it was divine. He never mentions this encounter again, but notes repeatedly the diminishing odds of not getting hurt as he spends more time on the front line.<br /><br />His faith did not prevent him from becoming the killing machine that his training had prepared him for, physically, but not spiritually. He describes his internal turmoil after killing a Japanese soldier in close range who almost released his grenade at him and his friends before shooting him.<br />\\"The soldier collapsed in the fusilade, and the grenade went off at his feet.<br />Even in the midst of these fast-moving events, I looked down at my carbine with sober reflection. I had just killed a man at close range. That I had seen clearly the pain on his face when my bullets hit him came as a jolt. It suddenly made the war a very personal affair. The expression on that man's face filled me with shame and then disgust for the war and all the misery it was causing.\\" p.117<br />He will not celebrate war, because there is nothing to celebrate. That does not mean he believes the war wrong, but there was nothing good about it either.<br />\\"I had long become used to the sight of blood, but the idea of sitting in that bloodstained bun pit was a bit too much for me. It seemed almost like leaving our dead unburied to sit on the blood of a fellow Marine spilled out on the coral...As I looked at the stains on the coral, I recalled some of the eloquent phrases of politicians and newsmen about how \\"gallant\\" it is for a man to \\"shed his blood for his country,\\" and \\"to give his life's blood as a sacrifice,\\" and so on. The words seemed so ridiculous. Only the flies benefited.\\" p. 146<br />War was brought to the United States by the Japanese and the US responded. What the Japanese lacked in materiel and soldiers it made up for in tenacity and ferocity. Their culture did not tolerate those who surrendered, all were expected to fight to their deaths, and the battles only ended when all the Japanese were dead, which is why the US expected a million casualties if they invaded the main Japanese island and chose the atom bomb instead. Certainly US soldiers who fought on Okinawa welcomed the news of the big bombs being used on Hiroshima and Nagasaki.<br /><br />Sledge was horrified as the sight of Marine dead who had been desecrated by the Japanese. More than once they found soldiers who had their sexual members cut off and stuffed in their mouths. Of course, he wasn't the only one traumatized. While he channeled his rage into hatred of his enemy and loss of any compassion, others went to further extremes. Speaking of his senior officer in Okinawa,<br />\\"Mac was a decent, clean-cut man but of those who apparently felt no restraints under the brutalizing influence of war - although he had hardly been in combat at that time. He had one ghoulish, obscene tendency that revolted even the most hardened and callous men I knew...If he could, that \\"gentleman by the act of Congress\\" would locate a Japanese corpse, stand over it, and urinate in its mouth. It was the most repulsive thing I ever saw an American do in the war. I was ashamed that he was a Marine officer.\\" pp. 198-199<br />How little things have changed in light of recent video from Afghanistan of AMerican soldiers doing similar things to dead Taliban.<br /><br />Sledge wants to disabuse us from any romance about war. He speaks of the flies that grew so fat on the corpses around them that they couldn't fly. He speaks of the smell of rotting human flesh that filled his nostrils for weeks at a time during stalemates on Okinawa. Although he notes the many acts of courage by his friends he also doesn't want us to remain ignorant of their tragic deaths minutes or days later. Their great deeds did not provide them divine insurance. Their aspirations did not either. As Sledge realized early on, God loves us all and the meat grinder of war gets everyone. In light of what Sledge experienced before and after the war, I wonder if he considers the KIA's the lucky ones.at him and his friends before shooting him.  \\"The soldier collapsed in the fusilade, and the grenade went off at his feet.  Even in the midst of these fast-moving events, I looked down at my carbine with sober reflection. I had just killed a man at close range. That I had seen clearly the pain on his face when my bullets hit him came as a jolt. It suddenly made the war a very personal affair. The expression on that man's face filled me with shame and then disgust for the war and all the misery it was causing.\\" p.117  He will not celebrate war, because there is nothing to celebrate. That does not mean he believes the war wrong, but there was nothing good about it either.  \\"I had long become used to the sight of blood, but the idea of sitting in that bloodstained bun pit was a bit too much for me. It seemed almost like leaving our dead unburied to sit on the blood of a fellow Marine spilled out on the coral...As I looked at the stains on the coral, I recalled some of the eloquent phrases of politicians and newsmen about how \\"gallant\\" it is for a man to \\"shed his blood for his country,\\" and \\"to give his life's blood as a sacrifice,\\" and so on. The words seemed so ridiculous. Only the flies benefited.\\" p. 146  War was brought to the United States by the Japanese and the US responded. What the Japanese lacked in materiel and soldiers it made up for in tenacity and ferocity. Their culture did not tolerate those who surrendered, all were expected to fight to their deaths, and the battles only ended when all the Japanese were dead, which is why the US expected a million casualties if they invaded the main Japanese island and chose the atom bomb instead. Certainly US soldiers who fought on Okinawa welcomed the news of the big bombs being used on Hiroshima and Nagasaki.  Sledge was horrified as the sight of Marine dead who had been desecrated by the Japanese. More than once they found soldiers who had their sexual members cut off and stuffed in their mouths. Of course, he wasn't the only one traumatized. While he channeled his rage into hatred of his enemy and loss of any compassion, others went to further extremes. Speaking of his senior officer in Okinawa,  \\"Mac was a decent, clean-cut man but of those who apparently felt no restraints under the brutalizing influence of war - although he had hardly been in combat at that time. He had one ghoulish, obscene tendency that revolted even the most hardened and callous men I knew...If he could, that \\"gentleman by the act of Congress\\" would locate a Japanese corpse, stand over it, and urinate in its mouth. It was the most repulsive thing I ever saw an American do in the war. I was ashamed that he was a Marine officer.\\" pp. 198-199  How little things have changed in light of recent video from Afghanistan of AMerican soldiers doing similar things to dead Taliban.  Sledge wants to disabuse us from any romance about war. He speaks of the flies that grew so fat on the corpses around them that they couldn't fly. He speaks of the smell of rotting human flesh that filled his nostrils for weeks at a time during stalemates on Okinawa. Although he notes the many acts of courage by his friends he also doesn't want us to remain ignorant of their tragic deaths minutes or days later. Their great deeds did not provide them divine insurance. Their aspirations did not either. As Sledge realized early on, God loves us all and the meat grinder of war gets everyone. In light of what Sledge experienced before and after the war, I wonder if he considers the KIA's the lucky ones.

B0055SWM08|5.0|Everything the description says! Simple, yet engaging interface. Beautiful, tranquil soundtrack. Challenging puzzles. TOTALLY worth the price! I love this game! :-)
B0054JZC6E|5.0|pretty awesome if you ask me! !!!!!! you have to get it!!!!!!!!!!!  really cool. get it.definatly get it. totally cool.
0671042858|5.0|Ordinary people in extraordinary situations. That is what Stephen King likes to write about, and that is what this is. The most terrifying part, especially to those of us who love the outdoors, is that it could really happen.
B006UG90RM|5.0|I was a little skeptical when I heard \\"Tattoo\\" but after listening to the entire disc I like every song. It's pretty heavy( I love that)  but still sounds like vintage VH. I highly recommend this CD. Don't pass judgement until you listen to it 4-5 times
B001U887WE|5.0|These crocs are just what I needed.  I bought them to wear to and from the YMCA pool in the winter.  I just slip them on and my feet are nice and warm.  No socks necessary and the lining comes out for washing.
B000W7JWUA|5.0|A family member taught us this game, and now it is our favorite.  We wore out our first game in about a year and a half, had to buy a new one already.  I would compare it to monopoly and chess because it requires planning ahead.  It also teaches that different assets have different values, but you cannot win with just one or two, no matter how many of them you might acquire.  The game is designed for three or four people, but since there are only two of us, we have adapted the rules just a little to make it acceptable for just two people to play.  Some days when we are snow-bound or something, we play it for several hours.  Sometimes it is just maddening, but sometimes you feel triumphant!
B006FE83U4|5.0|[[ASIN:B006FE83U4 To Kill a Mockingbird 50th Anniversary Edition [Blu-ray + DVD + Digital Copy]]] This review is for the Blu-Ray disc only as I have not yet viewed the DVD version nor downloaded the Digital Copy. I do not feel it necessary to review this classic film. Unless the subject matter is not suitable for one's age, everyone in the free world has surely seen the film entitled, To Kill a Mockingbird, or at the very least read the book. If not, shame on your High School English teacher! To Kill a Mockingbird was required reading when I was in High School & I could not put the book down until I had turned the very last page! To say that it is a page turner is not only redundant, it is also an understatement. However, this review is about the Blu-Ray not the book. Needless to say, I was absolutely thrilled to learn that To Kill a Mockingbird was showing in my home town movie theater. Having read the book, my sister & I absolutely could not wait to see the film. We no sooner returned home from the movie theater when we agreed to change the names of our two Finches (tiny caged birds). Mine was renamed Atticus Finch & my sister chose the name Scout Finch. Thus, I have read the book which remains on my bookshelf to this very day, purchased a ticket to watch To Kill a Mockingbird when it was initially released in movie theaters & I own the film version on both VHS & DVD. Yet I could not manage to resist purchasing this 50TH Anniversary Edition on Blu-Ray, DVD & Digital Copy for the incredibly reasonable price offered by Amazon. The Remastered Blu-Ray quality is truly excellent. Thankfully it remains in Black & White. There are many Bonus Features. So many in fact that I have no doubt it could take  several weeks to view all. The interviews with the actors are extremely interesting & entertaining. A true fan of the film To Kill a Mockingbird cannot go wrong with this set. It comes with two discs, one DVD, the other Blu-Ray, along with instructions about how to download the Digital Copy from your PC. The Blu-Ray is in 1080p High Definition Widescreen 1.85:1 which is apparent as once again, the picture quality is just incredible. The DVD is Anamorphic Widescreen 1.85:1. Both are in English & French but surprisingly not Spanish & both have English, Spanish & French subtitles. Some of the Special Features are in 1080i/p High Definition & some in 480i/p Standard Definition. I highly recommend this 50TH Anniversary Edition of the enduring classic film, To Kill a Mockingbird!
B005NPLXJ4|5.0|After listening to this album, I cried for at least an hour. I thought Metallica would never top their masterpiece, St. Anger, but this album makes St. Anger look like just an appetizer. While it lacks the trashcan drums and heavy riffs that St. Anger had, it makes up for it and much more by the addition of Lou Reed's singing. They seriously need to kick James Hetfield out, make Lou Reed join permanently, and redub every single album with his beautiful voice, which is comparable to William Shatner's. If Lou Reed did St. Anger, my brain would probably explode from its epicness, and I would die a happy man.
B00003CX8V|5.0|Every great film seems to have a correspondingly memorable soundtrack.  \\"The Apartment\\" has always been one of my favorite movies and partly for that reason - the experience was elevated to even greater heights by it's hauntingly beautiful music; something unusual in sound and sight that combines forever in the memory.  Jack Lemmon and Shirley MacLaine are both terrific in their roles of two lonely and slightly insecure people who work together at the same company.  He is working his way up the political ladder in an unorthodox way by lending out his apartment to those whom he knows can help him and it's turning him into a nervous wreck.  She has committed the age-old blunder of becoming embroiled with a married man, and her boss to boot.  And there they are, right under each other's noses, two people meant for each other with a passel of pressing problems to work out first, not the least of which is simply opening the eyes.   \\"The Apartment\\" has joined the ranks of enduring classics because it is one of those rare films that possesses all of the essential elements; unusual twist to an ageless story, enchanting soundtrack, splendid casting, talented directing.
B000HWZ61Y|5.0|This is highly recommended for any Def Leppard fan. I owned the original Hysteria on cassette and then some of the songs were on their original greatest hits record. I listened to this remastered version using my Playstation 3 and the sound is amazing. I pick up on riffs I didn't previously and it gave me a new found appreciation for Def Leppard. Pyromania remastered and Mirrorball are also recommended.
B000WAEJZ0|4.0|Sad to hear of Whitney Houston's passing last night (February 11, 2012).  Such an incredible talent and a gorgeous girl, but unfortunately, her life went downhill in later years (and, according to friends and family, Bobby Brown had nothing to do with it, despite the conventional wisdom). Cissy Houston, in her 2013 book, [[ASIN:0062238396 Remembering Whitney]], now partially blames Bobby, contrary to what she said in interviews after Whitney's death. Who knows?  I had her first album (now available as [[ASIN:B002W1HBN4 Whitney Houston (The Deluxe Anniversary Edition) (CD/DVD)]]) on vinyl years ago.  I bought her [[ASIN:B00004R84V Whitney Houston - The Greatest Hits]] in 2000, but was disappointed because the second disc contains mostly remixes, instead of the original hit versions.  I do have the CD single of [[ASIN:B00000DE22 The Star-Spangled Banner]], which I consider to be the best contemporary version of our National Anthem ever.  My favorite traditional version: The Mormon Tabernacle Choir.  Worst version: Jimi Hendrix' Woodstock &#34;rendition,&#34; which I associate with flag-burning.  But I digress.  I'm glad I found this single-disc collection of hits.  [[ASIN:B004FPXJOK The Essential Whitney Houston]] is nothing more than a repackage of the 2000 album.  I hope Sony/Arista will compile a better collection for the U.S. market.  Whitney deserves better, and so do her fans.  Rest in peace, sweetie...  UPDATE:  RCA Records (Sony folded Arista into RCA in late 2011) released [[ASIN:B009J2VR3Y I Will Always Love You: The Best Of Whitney Houston]] on November 13, 2012. [[ASIN:B000WAEJZ0 Ultimate Collection]] is the better buy, because it contains &#34;One Moment In Time,&#34; which is one of my favorites, and not on the new collection.  Tracks on THE ULTIMATE COLLECTION that are not on I WILL ALWAYS LOVE YOU:  &#34;One Moment In Time&#34; &#34;When You Believe&#34; &#34;Run To You&#34; &#34;If I Told You That&#34; &#34;It's Not Right But It's Okay&#34;  Tracks onI WILL ALWAYS LOVE YOU that are not on THE ULTIMATE COLLECTION:  &#34;You Give Good Love&#34; &#34;All The Man That I Need&#34; &#34;I Believe In You And Me&#34; &#34;I Look To You&#34; (duet with R. Kelly - previously unreleased) &#34;Never Give Up&#34; (previously unreleased)  Look at both collections and judge for yourself.  I'm staying with THE ULTIMATE COLLECTION.  And sadly, Whitney's daughter, Bobbi Kristina Brown, joined her mom in Heaven, on July 26, 2015. Rest in peace, dear Bobbi, and tell your mom that we miss her on Earth.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|great game to play with kids! mine loved the mini games and earning the points and leveling up! its really fun!

B005D0RDKW|4.0|Having been a fan of Rush since the early 80s, I've had the pleasure to see them multiple times live.  As much as I enjoy any concert video of a group I like, I usually find those videos lacking.  It never really feels like the concert, which of course, is simply the reality watching something opposed to actually being there.  I saw Rush in Atlanta (really Alpharetta, GA) on the Time Machine tour, which was about 6 months before this show in Cleveland was filmed.  After watching this Blu-Ray, let me tell you something friend, this is as close to being at the show as I think you can get.  It's as much like being there as you can get, minus all the negatives.  The picture is amazingly clear, even for Blu-Ray.  (very glad I waited the extra time for the blu-ray release)  I personally don't have a 7.1 or even a 5.1 sound but for regular old flat screen speakers it sounds really good (it even gets a bit loud at times).  I believe the band kept the same set list through out the concert, as this was the same one I saw and read on the Rush web boards.  Why Cleveland you may ask?  It's a nod to the first US town to play Rush (\\"Working Man\\") back in the day.  Care to guess the song the wraps up the encore?  As Moving Pictures is my favorite Rush album, this disc holds a special place in my heart.  I had hoped to catch the band a second time as they came close again, but was unable to.  Now, I feel like I can catch this magnificent show any time.  If you are a Rush fan, you simply must have this disc.  If you are a boarder line fan, I still recommend you picking it up.  Oh, just a last note, as this seems to bother some people.  The Moving Pictures album was released in early 1981, some 30+ years ago.  Since the band members are the same, they have obviously grown 30 years older.  Geddy can't quite hit the high notes that he could back then.  He's not as bad as say Roger Daltry doing \\"Baba O'Reily\\", but you can tell.  Just something obvious that apparently needs mentioning.  If I were to give one slight negativity, the special features are a bit slim.  They exist (2 long lost songs), but that's about it.  I hope that one day soon, we get a Rush concert that has multiple angle selections that would let you watch each individual band member.  That being said, this is one fine blu-ray.  If you've read this review and are on the fence, just do yourself a favor and pick it up.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|fun fun fun fun fun. I can spend do much time with this app!!!  some of the games are a little too difficult

B005I6EU7U|5.0|I ordered this case cover to fit my Kindle Fire and it is perfect.  It fits beautifully and is attractive. It is so easy just to throw in a bag and take with me wherever I go. I wanted something that looked nice but protected my Kindle Fire and that's exactly what I got.
B0068MNO4S|1.0|Many theories have been discussed regarding the identity and authenticity of William Shakespeare. Personally, as a historian and Shakespeare enthusiast, I believe that William Shakespeare himself penned these remarkable plays, but I'm always intrigued whenever other theories arise. However, the movie itself is a disaster. In portraying the Earl of Oxford as the intelligent playwright, Anonymous, Director Roland Emmerich rewrites history... (Spoiler Alert) Not only is William Shakespeare a drunken illiterate fool (much like Bottom in a Midsummer Night's Dream) but Queen Elizabeth, historically the celebrated Virgin Queen, is an emotional whore who can't function without her advisors, commits incest, and has not 1 but 3 bastard children. Once again, Hollywood please stop making historical movies.
B0071QIN00|5.0|The graphics for this game are amazing for the kindle fire and.the game gives you hours of non stop fun. at some points it gets hard but overall great game. best i have.
B006UG90RM|5.0|To all the people who gave a 1 or 2 stars. They must be the commercial Van Hagar Fans. I say Van Halen is Back and this album is very good. Eddie shreds throughout this album. The more I listen to it. I love it. Van halen with Roth is a different band when Hagar was in it. At times I thought Eddie was held back for more poppy songs. This is Van Halen to me. Of course I wish Michael Anthony was with them. But Wolfie does a very fine job playing. Mike's back ground voice would of been nice. But you know these guys are pushing 60. What elese would you want. This blows any Chickenfoot cd out there and Sammy Hagar seems bitter about it. Dave's voice is fun and reminds me of summer. Rolling the windows down and cruise. Or even BBQ in the back yard and crank this up. van Halen has always been about good times and fun.  You must get this if you like classic Van Halen with update sound.
0307454541|5.0|once I strarted into this, I could not put it down. Character descriptions are great. all heroes are flawed but still good.. already halfway into second book
B005AUWY90|2.0|I buy Blu-ray and DVD discs mainly for the bonus features; having the movie was a side benefit.  Unfortunately for Cars 2 (Two-Disc Blu-ray / DVD Combo in Blu-ray Packaging), there is virtually no bonus features. The only things included on the discs are director's commentary and two shorts.  Personally, I think this combo set was not worth the price that I paid for it.
B0071QIN00|1.0|this game is a piece of chizzzz it is please take my word if you don't well have fun with the screwed game SCREWWWWW ITTTTTT
B003VR5PPY|5.0|I realize this review is a little late considering how long this game has been out and the fact that the 3DS is out now and the DS is nearing the end of its life.  However, if you have a DS or 3DS, you should absolutely play this game.  The story, characters, and environment created in this game are absolutely stunning.  The story is so engaging that you'll lay awake at night wondering what is going to happen next.  The first time the game ends you'll be shocked when it happens.  You'll play through it again and the second time through the game will be even better.  The more you play, the better the story gets.  The gameplay is simple but effective, it's about half puzzle solving and half interactive novel.  The gameplay and puzzle solving are fun, for the most part logical and not excessively frustrating like some puzzle games, but again it is the story that will really pull you in.  I could go on and on about how great this game is but if you're not sold by now I doubt much is going to change that.<br /><br />Like I eluded to above, this is a game which is meant to be played through multiple times.  If you play through it once and end there you're missing the boat and about 70% of the game.  After a couple playthroughs find a guide online to help you, not one that gives anything away, just one that tells you which choices you need to make to get the \\"true\\" ending.  Also, the ending during your final playthrough will be a lot longer than you may be expecting, I was sure I was at the end of the game for at least 2 hours but it just kept going, but in a good way.  Finally, there is a sequel being made for the PSP/3DS so if you're as impressed by this game as I was, keep a look out that that in the near future.<br /><br />9 Hours 9 Persons 9 Doors is a great game which will draw you in with its great story and won't let go until you've completed the game.  I honestly can't say that any other experience on the DS has been as good (though Hotel Dusk and Elite Beat Agents came close) and I'm not sure I've ever played a game before with such a compelling story.m not sure I've ever played a game before with such a compelling story.
0143119680|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book.  It had vampires, witches, daemons, history and magic.  What more could you ask for?  Good story, great characters.  I'm really looking forward to the next one in the series.  One of the best books I've read in a while.

B004VMUS9G|5.0|This app does an excellent job of reminding be about my appointments as well as my daily to-do things. I love the fact that every alarm can be personalized to whatever music I want from the files on my android. Another of my favorite features is the volume crescendo - the app has a feature where you can have the volume start low and slowly increase, so in the morning, there is no abrupt, harsh wake-up, and is nice and gentle.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Got this app for my kindle fire and I have to say I enjoy it very much. There are ads but I don't even really notice them. Would highly reccommend this game.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|This app is free and a pretty fun way to waste some time. The games are really simple but there are a lot of them, so Id say its worth the effort of downloading it.
B004LFO0FG|1.0|the only thing that is fatale is your eardrum after hearing.  also maybe the concept of bratney as a singer.  hopefully her career will be fatale soon as well, as this effort is demonstrative evidence

B006HGXGWU|4.0|There is a lot of food for thought in this movie.  In prior times, a man like Curtis would not be assumed to be mentally ill.  The fact that he is having visions would be respected by both the bible and in native folk lore as he would be seen as a possible prophet in their midst.  Curtis's mother has been in long time care since she was diagnosed as a schizophrenic.  However, when we meet her, the question is really open as to her as well.  We live in an age where science has decreed that things like portents, omens, seers, prophets and the like are impossible.  That anyone who deals in this matter is just plain loco.<br /><br />Curtis begins turning his storm shelter into more of an atomic bomb like shelter and runs into one person after another who is teed off at him, from his employer to his colleague to his wife.  Yet he persists.  What he sees is supported by reports which have been filed around catastrophes. For example, when tidal waves come in, birds do go crazy.  They swarm and take off and some, in their hurry to get out, drop dead from the sky to the ground.<br /><br />So the big question is whether Curtis is having a psychotic break with reality or if he is a seer who feels and sees a disaster coming.  I know most people are going with the mental illness interpretation.  Personally, I think since this this kind of person has been chronicled for thousands of years that it is possible that such a person could exist but does not want to broadcast his visions for precisely the reason that people will think he is insane.<br /><br />Michael Shannon as Curtis and Jessica Chastain as his wife are both terrific.<br /><br />One caution about this movie: it is very slow.

B002KSPKRS|1.0|This headset picks up too much static resulting in very poor sound quality.  Could be we just had a bad set, but not entirely sure that this problem is a design flaw.  When we returned it to Amazon, we were shocked to find out there is a $28 restocking fee.
B003R4ZMJU|4.0|Oh boy, what to say... She loves this series and has but one disc to go... Great buy at $20 for the entire season (I think its 5 discs) and the picture quality is actually quite good for a DVD being up-sampled on a Samsung blu-ray player. I know, because I have been forced to watch these girls on more than one occasion.
B0063IH60K|5.0|There is one small ad before each game but since the app is free it's no big deal.  You can choose your deal, how many cards are drawn, etc.  I find myself getting sucked into several games because I play random deal and you don't always win!
B005V20JKI|1.0|Update erased my saved game and I get a killer lag every time I grab a muffin. Pissed and uninstalling.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|It's fun I can easily get points! Another thing is that when you buy this app it has 101 games in it. You save money because it has alot of games in it rather than buying the games by itself.
B0058EBNAO|4.0|Really like this app. It is very helpful and informative. The alerts will keep you informed of current conditions and any severe weather.
1469984202|5.0|I read the Wool series before the Omnibus Edition became available.  I have the Kindle for iPad and am always looking for a good read before bed.  BIG mistake to start reading Wool right before bed. Once I began reading, I couldn't put it down!  I read Wool straight through and then had to download the rest of the series immediately!  The Omnibus Edition includes all five Wool episodes and is an excellent deal at $4.99, saving you two bucks over the total price of purchasing the individual series.  Wool starts out as a kind of a post-apocalyptic detective story that takes place in an underground community called \\"the Silo\\".  The more you read, the more you WANT to read in order to learn more about this world and what is REALLY going on here.  The story of the Silo continues on to become a truly epic saga of one woman's struggle to survive an impossible situation, and the clash of her peers with the totalitarian ruling class of this underground society.  The story is well written, and the author has an excellent style that pulls you into the world of Wool head first.  I recommend planning ahead before you pick up this book - you won't want to put it down!  By the way, here are a few indicators of what an amazing author Hugh Howey is, and the substance of the Wool storyline:  1) The Wool series is on a constant rise towards the top of the Amazon Science Fiction Best Sellers  2) Hugh has \\"quit his day job\\" to become a full-time author and is continuing to develop the saga with a new series that is a prequel to Wool (see his blog at hughhowey.com).  3) The BBC is in discussions with Hugh and the stories of the Silo may well become a series.
B0038P59A0|5.0|This is a thoughtful and well-crafted film, fully deserving of its praise. I strongly suspect that any negative reviews are motivated out of nostalgia for staid-and-clichéd productions, and a consequent bias against more modern versions.

B001QOOCTE|5.0|Wonderful CD.  Love the concept and the project.  Good sound.  It arrived fast, it was brand new, and I'm a happy customer.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|The fanbase might currently be mired in heated discussions and pointed criticisms about who shot first or about Anakin Skywalker's thoughts on sand and its irritative qualities, but these frivolous complaints will be less than footnotes in the grand scheme of things. Future generations, which will far outnumber us in time, will not be reacting with shock and vitriol to something new and different in the Star Wars universe; they will simply be enjoying (or not enjoying) Star Wars in its entirety, for what it is and what it will always be.  It is a unique and highly inventive spectacle the likes of which has never been seen before, and probably won't be seen again, not in this way. Each Episode is its own universe with its own atmosphere and its own beats that, when portioned into two trilogies, create two singular arcs that function beautifully on their own but when combined into a six-part saga tells a breathtaking, epic, and almost musical and melodic tale of adventure, action, heartbreak, mystery, romance, fear, anger, joy, betrayal, deception, and beauty. This saga truly is a sight to behold visually, aurally, emotionally.  That wonder looks and sounds spectacular on Blu-ray. I'm seeing and hearing details I've never noticed before, which is what one wants from a high-def release. The special features are a decently sizable affair, although I do lament the relative lack of lengthier documentaries that go deeper into specific portions of the films and their production, or their impact in general. We do get interesting info and somewhat short clips on a vast multitude of subjects (art, costumes, models, puppets, miniatures), a few interviews, two commentaries for each film, overviews of each part of each movie, an hour-and-a-half of spoofs and parodies, etc. This all amounts to over 40 hours of special features, so don't think you'll be getting shafted there, but I would have liked deeper docs to go along with it all, aside from just Star Warriors (which was wonderful).  Star Wars, like all myths, is timeless, and long after the cries and outrages of modern fandom are gone, generations upon generations will be experiencing and enjoying these films for what they are, never giving a care that Darth Vader didn't originally say \\"No!\\" at the end of Return of the Jedi or that Yoda was originally a puppet in The Phantom Menace -- they'll be too swept up in the adventure, the drama, the legend that is Star Wars to make those details anything but trivia night fodder, and if these movies look and sound so amazing now on Blu-Ray, I can only imagine and drool over the outstanding quality with which those future generations will be witnessing this spectacle!
0307387178|4.0|This book, written by Jon Krakauer, is about a man, Chris McCandless, who decides that he wants to rid himself from the rest of the world and go into the wild to become one with nature. The story starts off with his embarking on his journey to Alaska, followed by a long dive into his past and how he got to making the decision to adventure through Alaska. It is revealed in the beginning itself that McCandless dies while on his journey, but the story of how it happens or why is not revealed until the end. When readers know about the death, the whole story becomes more suspenseful because they never know how or when it is going to come. Also, knowing about the death of the character leads to a better relationship overall between the reader and the character. When they know that McCandless is going to die, their pity automatically leads to a deeper compassion and love for the character.  The unique structure in which this book is written has a certain purpose behind it. The story goes in a present, past, present type of sequence. The parts about the past dominate the book, which I found tiring at first. I had expected the whole book to be filled with action and suspense, but the entire middle part was filled with background information. All this background information had no purpose to me, and I started to dislike the book. However, it was only after a few chapters about the past that I began to understand Krakauer's purpose in writing like that. He had wanted the readers to feel an even deeper connection to McCandless. When readers see what McCandless has been through in his life, including the hardships and struggles, they understand why he made the decision he made: to go out into the wild, away from everything he has ever known.  In the beginning, I had thought of McCandless of a crazy man for abandoning his family and living his own life. I had felt sorry for him, as if he had some sort of craziness that made him do these kinds of absurd things. However, I have grown to realize that he did it to get away from all the troubles of the real world. He did not want to worry about keeping a job, or raising a healthy family. All he wanted was to be happy and to live his life to the fullest. That quality of McCandless is one that I admire greatly. He is simply not afraid to stand out from the crowd.  That is the main theme of the story, and is made very clear near the end.  The middle parts of this book, although full of background information, were still very interesting to me. It not only followed McCandless' life, but also the lives of the ones around him, including the life of the author of this book. Every background story turned into an adventure, full of vivid descriptions and details. For example, just the story of a man climbing a mountain took several pages to describe. This aspect of the author's writing is one that I admire, because even in the uneventful parts of the book, Krakauer inserts suspenseful scenes that are so well described that I felt as if I were experiencing them.  Overall, I would definitely recommend this book. It come with lots of detail and imagery, and has a healthy balance between suspense and normal events. It comes with a great message in the end, which had a strong impact on me, and probably several other readers.

B0064J6OMO|1.0|This movie was on special last weekend - $1.99. It is written for 13 year olds... but it is rated \\"R\\", so, they can't see it. It is so stupid and loaded with gratuitous nude and vulgar shots including baby poop to the face (that's so ooollllddddd) and a thumb up someone's \\"behind\\", I couldn't sit through the entire move - even at the bargain price! I was especially disappointed because it is a fun concept, and I like the actors...and even they couldn't save the day. I was expecting something \\"clever\\"? <--Not found here.  Don't waste your Time!

0446547654|2.0|Nicholas Sparks books are my guilty pleasure (don't tell my friends!).  I've read them all, and I've enjoyed most of them.  But I agree with some of the other reviewers.  It seems as though lately, Sparks is writing movies, rather than books.  I feel bad saying this because I've really liked him, but some of the ideas in book are sophomoric at best.  Every October, I look out for a new Sparks book, and I will do it again in October 2012!  But if the writing does not seem to be from the heart of a writer who has shown he has that capability, then I may be done.  If you're looking for a solid, thoughtful, well-written Nicholas Sparks book, this one may disappoint you.  :(

B0062NAX1U|5.0|This is the best movie I've seen in a long time.  I am sure this film will positively impact many lives, it surly encouraged me.  God bless you much, ARA
B0062NAX1U|5.0|Courageous is the best movie put out by this company so far.  It has an excellent message--more fathers needs to hear it, especially in our media culture which often portrays men as weak, ineffective, or just plain dumb.  My husband says this is his new favorite movie.
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|I think this is one of those books where everything has two meanings, the one written in plain English and the one between the lines. What does a teen overcome with grief believe about his deceased grandfather's stories of losing all his family to the Nazis, about the weird inhabitants present at the orphanage where grandfather was placed during the war, about the next location of the orphanage (snowy area behind a fence{concentration camp?}), about the battleships present as they make their escape. It's a whole different story than the one written, but still plain as day and just as spooky.

B0038M2AZA|5.0|Powerful video of the later childhood and early work life of Temple Grandin. The video introduces the viewer to the difficulties of living life with autism from the view of Ms. Grandin and her mother. Worth owning and sharing.<br /><br />Product arrived within days of purchase and in perfect condition.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|This book was like slogging through a soupy fog, never feeling safe or knowing quite where you are. At times I felt the whole thing was an illusion, other times I saw it as a ghostly exhibition with no living participants. The cruelty and betrayal of a father toward his only child as part of a game was more scary than all the magical realism. If I read it all again, I will probably see everything differently once again. In a word, ephemeral.
B000AARKOO|3.0|I used to love Ridley Scott in the days when he created daring timeless works of art like Blade Runner. Unfortunately he has sold out in recent decades, which may be what is required to finance $130M movies. King of Heaven is just a formula swordplay flick on the 'king-succession-girlfriend' model with mumbled dialog in between the blood spurts. Yes, the cinematography is magnificent and the thousands of extras on horsies, impressive. But it all would be just as entertaining - or just as boring - with the sound turned off. It did lead me to Google what the 'crusades' were, and what I learned there about the complex politics of church and states in the 11th century was far more fascinating than this simplistic movie.<br /><br />Finally, Scott's take on the supposed injustice done to Islam in the Crusades is just pure pathetic leftwing Hollywood politically correct drivel. So he's sold out politically also. Hollllllywood!

B005FUTBWS|1.0|I tried to watch this movie but there was just no freakin way.  I got to where the guy was about to shoot the blonde and then the mother came out and shot him.  Those orders to kill everybody in the compound was a stroke of stupidity for whoever wrote the script.  Yeah, no way the media wouldn't know, sure federal agents en mass just decide to take orders to kill every person inside - even when they come out unarmed.  Yes, I am aware of Waco and Ruby Ridge - but this is different than those incidents.  Some of the situations that made me really mad was the stupidity of the characters too.  Here is this kid running around with a loaded M-4 and he is running from unarmed men?  Sure he wanted to get out - but WTF?  Then some idiot sheriff shoots him - a whole unit outside and no one says anything to him as he is running out?  Just a bunch of ridiculous nonsense events.  Yeah, there are people that have crazy ideologies and sure the government oversteps its bounds, but this stretched credibility into no credibility.  I have no idea what happened with the rest of the movie but from reading other reviews I see that it was just more of the same.  So my review is probably only what? 1/2 hour of it?  That was waste enough for me, at least I didn't waste any more of my time on garbage like that.
B0067LY4WG|1.0|I know its a cliche on this review site, but if I could give NO stars--I would!  This is a \\"spoken word\\" CD with nothing even resembling singing.  This is L. Cohen at his absolute worst. I wonder if I can pursue a refund...this is garbage on CD.
1586487981|5.0|I especially liked how they brought up examples of interventions and then examined the thinking of the ultimate beneficiaries to try to understand the reasons for success or lack thereof of the intervention. I would think that this work would be suitable for non-economists. Highly recommend.

B00656C6KK|5.0|What a marvelous tribute to both her animals and her late son Terry.  Probably not new or current songs, but MOST listenable and tear jerking.  She is a true American classic.
B001DTPZNY|2.0|Wow. This was such a disappointing movie. Actually, disappointing doesn't even begin to describe it. It was just plain awful. I'll admit that I was a little bit skeptical when I was going to see it in the theater, but I tried my best in keeping an open mind. I thought it wouldn't be great, but it wouldn't be bad either. I'm a big fan of the original trilogy, and I watch those movies over and over again and never get tired of them. This movie doesn't even remotely compare to the original trilogy. I personally don't believe it should be a part of the Indiana Jones franchise. To me, it just seems like a poorly plotted out piece of fan fiction. I didn't find myself caring for the story or any of the new characters at all, although it was the ending that really killed it for me. While it's not the worst movie I've ever seen, it certainly will never stand up to the other amazing Indie films. This one is definitely not going into my DVD collection.
B0063IH60K|4.0|would prefer that I could change the look of the cards, but you get what you pay for, and for a free game this is great!

B0064NTZJO|1.0|Replete with poignant and pointless dialogue pauses intermixed in the two-word dialogues and stares off into nothingness potential purchasers are warned, \\"Buyer Beware!\\" One saving grace of this movie is the presence of background music. At least the music helps to fill the dialog and activity voids. It is sad and grossly unfair to the talented cast that their talents are squandered in this turkey. Calling this piece of garbage a turkey would degrade turkeys. The best part of movie, however is the ending credits indicating that the bad movie has FINALLY ended.

1589795474|4.0|I wish I had this information 25 years ago!  We are constantly bombarded with advertising, and other societal pressures, that would have us believe that we should live in a certain kind of house, drive a certain kind car, and wear certain kinds of clothes.  At the end of the day, if you cannot \\"truly\\" provide for your family (not borrow your way out of a jam), then you have not done your most important job.  I will be sure that my 21 year old son reads this book, and does not waste his most valuable asset...time.

B003Y5H4Y8|1.0|I have rarely seen such a horrible movie that actually looked good in the previews.  This movie follows three Mossad agents who spend the entire movie whining over who did what and who is to blame.  They are tracking down an aging Nazi doctor who must have gotten his hands on Captain American's super serum.  Every time he's on camera he's doing something to overpower, outwit or dismantle all three agents.  Towards the end of the movie, when the doctor is nearly 90 years old and living in a ramshackle Ukraine retirement home he attacks and overcomes one of the agents, who is not about 50.  Keep in mind this man was a doctor.  He had no combat training, yet he easily trounces a career secret agent from one of the world's most effective and dangerous intelligence agencies.  Who writes this nonsense?
B0071FBARY|5.0|Ok this is a first. I have never offered a review. I have all of the fray's cd's. things that stick out about this one. One is just how much better they are getting as musicians. Scars and stories is different than the other 2 cd's but is still going the right direction musically. There are thought provoking lyricsi can't get out of my head .. I hope they keep growing.  I got it today and have had my headphones on all day. can't tellnyou which track I like most.. I have been reading that you can't really put this band in a box and say that they sound like so and so. But I think they sound like u2. Well the guitar player does sound as tho he has an edge influence.  Anyway, if your a fray fan, this album is a treat

B006OB3K56|5.0|\\"Shame\\", Steve McQueen's stark and uncompromising exploration of the devastating effects of sex addiction, is a powerful glimpse into the dark parts of the human soul and how it can consume us. It stars Michael Fassbender as Brandon, viewed by his colleagues as a polite, well-kept business professional, who is secretly struggling with a sex addiction that causes him to seek out sexual release through either girls he meets at bars, escorts or masturbation, often in public bathrooms. In essence he lives in his own erotic world, though the sex is not for pleasure but simply to help block out some deep-seeded pain, which he tries to control with daily routines to keep focus. This world is disrupted when Sissy, his wayward sister with no other place to go, arrives and requests a place to stay. Brandon reluctantly agrees which appeared to be one of a few attempts to change his habits; the other being starting a real relationship with a beautiful young coworker. Things seem to be going well, but Sissy's intrusive and erratic behavior, though often not intentional, quickly disrupts the rituals that held his psyche together and he begins to break. Her presence makes him feel constricted and bring back those feelings and memories he seemed dead set to repress with his sexual behavior, causing him to spiral downward with his sexual exploits becoming more extreme as the resurgence of his past and inability to cope with her needs boil to the surface.  It is important to understand, because the story relies so heavily on their interactions, that Sissy and Brandon share similar pains, though they go about suppressing them in different ways. Sissy is outgoing and wants everyone to love her; whereas Brandon is reserved and prefers to be on his own. When \\"living\\" becomes too hard they give in to harmful behavior. For Brandon it is sexual stimulation and for Sissy it is cutting herself, as pointed out by Brandon's coworker after noticing her scarred wrist. It is this conflict in theirpersonalities that creates the most drama. They are not suited for one another, Sissy's intruding in Brandon's sheltered existence and Brandon's refusing to give her the attention and love she needs are the sparks that lead to destruction. It is not long before their clashing reaches an unbearable limit and they are both so terribly damaged, and heartbreakingly so, that when they both hit bottom it is a tragic moment. Especially for Brandon who finds himself under the pain of both the shame he places upon himself and his sister.  McQueen plays coy on what exactly about their past has had this effect on them but clearly there is a lot under the surface that has left them scarred. Many have complained about this lack of back story or an outright explanation to Brandon's behavior but McQueen is less interested in a thoroughly develop story, and more concerned with peeking into the lives of these individuals. This is honestly all we need. It is sometimes too hard for people to accept that this is just the way we are. Humans have their demons. Films have already thoroughly gone through the scenarios that could lead to this behavior. All that matters is the now, how technology and New York help him to indulge in his addiction, and how he copes with the present.  As Brandon Michael Fassbender gives one of the most haunting and courageous performances in a very long time. His willingness to bear all, in scenes the audience can barely sit through let along imagine being a part of, along with his ability to open himself up physically and emotionally and relay so much pain, in a way that feels so human, was just outstanding.  Carey Mulligan also shines here in a roll that is unlike anything she has ever done. She plays Sissy as a woman who clearly has her own demons, and although she might seem more outgoing and capable or connecting with others, she also has a hard time coping with the past and the rejection of lovers and her brother. One of the film's most stunning momentscomes when Mulligan, in a close up, sings `New York New York' in a powerful, raw and emotional rendition that really mirrored her whole performance.  The result of it all is a dark and unsettling portrait of self-destructive souls, driven by some unknown torment, so lost and damaged, struggling to mask one great shame with another in an attempt to feel something; not pleasure but rather the physical and moral pains of the acts they commit. Alone this is challenging stuff, but with the addition of exquisite long shots, beautiful photography adding a sort of poetic grace all set to a hypnotic score by Harry Escott, it becomes not only an emotional but also visually mesmerizing experience.

Not this time. This album is America's best band at the top of their game. Great songs played by great musicians. Now excuse me while I play The Whole Love again...

B000XUBFE2|5.0|If books are measured by how they, through the power of words, reach into your heart and move you to new discoveries, powerful emotions, and wonderful inspiration, then this book is great.  It describes how words and books do this in the characters lives ... all the while doing it to you as you read it.  Couldn't put it down and now I'm sad its over, but I'll never forget it.  I will recommend this to all.

0385344325|3.0|A lot of what makes Reacher books work for this reader is the creative imagery and storyline from the author Lee Child. I feel if you regard Reacher as a cartoon-like super-action character you can easily suspend belief in some of the fantastic stuff he gets away with. I've ditched a few Reacher books and rode it out with others.<br /><br />\\"The Affair\\" flowed along nicely and filled the void (nicely) of not having anything else to read. If you're looking for crazy escapism in a crime drama, check it out.

1466401885|2.0|Beautiful Disaster may be the title of the book but it also heavily reflects the content. Between the covers, the reader finds a mish-mash of everything wonderful and bad thrown in to one novel, providing an end result of disappointment.  The first half of Beautiful Disaster is wonderful. It is fast-paced, intriguing, and everything else that a superb novel should be. The reader is introduced to a cast of characters that are both complex and lovable while keeping the reader curious about their motives in relationships. The relationship between Travis and Abby is, at first, what keeps the novel from becoming just another one of \\"those\\" books where the girl meets the bad boy and forgets any standards that she ever had. The fact that Abby is able to keep her standards and stand up for herself for the majority of the novel may be one of the best things about it. Another thing that makes Beautiful Disaster good is the unique setting - The Circle at Eastern University, where secret fights happen. This certainly adds intrigue and tension to the overall novel.  Unfortunately, despite all of the great things about the novel, there are also a lot of bad things. After the half-way mark in the novel, the entire thing goes downhill. The plot is rushed, actions taken by certain characters are abrupt and unjustified, and anything negative in the first half is magnified.  The first thing that falls apart is the relationship between Abby and Travis. Throughout the first half of the novel, their relationship is unique and it makes sense. Abby does not let him get away with anything and she stands up for herself. However, at this point in the novel she seems to lose all self-respect and begins to do anything he says. Even more disturbing than their relationship, however, is Travis himself. He is an angry boy with drinking problems and often resorts to violence and lies. At some points in the novel, the fact this is bad is clearly obvious but in the end, the general message that violence and lying are okay in a relationship is sent to the reader.  While there is a fantastic cast of supporting characters, including Abby's best friends and Travis' brothers, none of them are fully developed. The reader sees enough of them to be curious about them but the desire to know more is never fully fulfilled, particulars in the area of Travis' brothers. At times the actions are of the supporting characters are questionable, especially those of Shepley's.  The final quarter of the novel is rushed and very abrupt, leaving the reader going \\"wait, what?\\" and does not seem to fit the quality of the rest of the novel, leaving the reader disappointed.  Beautiful Disaster could have easily been one of the best books out there, had more time been taken to explain, develop, and resolve. Unfortunately, it fell short of expectations due to lack of development and erratic behavior from the characters. A possible sequel is in the works and the good parts of the novel may intrigue a reader enough to pick up a copy upon release.

B0042GNDO8|5.0|This is an incredibly cheap way to get a batch of some of the greatest violin concerto recordings of all time. Heifetz was unparalleled in the Sibelius, Prokofiev. Tchaikovsky, Bruch and Mendelssohn concertos; and if I prefer Oistrakh in the Brahms and Beethoven ([[ASIN:B001ASVXSE David Oistrakh: The Complete EMI Recordings]]) it's because Heifetz, great as he is, misses some of the grandeur that the more rhetorical Oistrakh finds in these scores.  Other gems included in this set are Heifetz's gorgeous readings of the Bruch Scottish Fantasy and the Glazunov concerto. The Rozsa and Vieuxtemps concertos were never of much interest to me, so I'll not comment on them; however, Heifetz's recording of the Brahms double concerto with Piatigorsky has always been held in high esteem and is worthy of inclusion in this set. The violinist's Bach, Mozart and Vivaldi recordings also have their fans, and a sampling from each composer is also included.  As with the other sets in this barebones reissue series from Sony there's no documentation included, but no matter as this a stunning bargain (under $19 from amazon resellers as of this writing).
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this is a amazing game for all including freinds family cousins and even your pets. it is a very addicting game and can even challenge angry birds.
B006W0QOF2|2.0|O.k. I read the reviews and wanted a good movie to watch this weekend.  I can tell you to please not watch this movie.  This movie was so slow that I feel asleep twice.  I loved the soundtrack but the movie was just boring.  The lead showed no emotion throughout the entire movie.  I don't know what movie everyone else was watching but this one was just not worth 4 stars.
B006UG90RM|4.0|I never thought I would hear a new album of Van Halen material with David Lee Roth.  It doesn't matter to me if these are old songs from the glory days that didn't make it onto the albums - in my mind, this is new and fantastic stuff.  All you really need to know is that Eddie is as brilliant as ever.  This album is full of some dazzling and adventurous guitar soloing, as you would expect from a man in the top five of all-time rock guitarists.  Alex hasn't missed a beat, either (pardon the pun) - his play is as tight as ever.  Eddie's son, Wolfgang, does a more than acceptable job on the bass, although he does sound a little wooden at times.  That's too be expected, to an extent - unlike my favorite band, Rush, the bass guitar in Van Halen is and always will be strictly a background instrument.  I'll say that Wolfgang does at least as good a job as Michael Anthony ever did, and I can certainly do without the high-pitched shrieking that passed for Anthony's background vocals.  I hate to say, but if there's any drawback to this album as a whole, it's David Lee Roth's diminished vocal talent.  It's obviously good to have the band back together, but it's plainly apparent that there's been more than a little deterioration in Roth's vocals over the course of almost thirty years.  His current ability is acceptable, of course - a few decades is bound to diminish most levels of talent...unless your last name is Van Halen.  Favorite tracks here are China Town, Bullethead, Honeybabysweetiedoll, Outta Space and Beats Workin'.  There isn't a ballad in the bunch, which I like.  I like Van Halen to just rock.  One thing I do wish is that there had been an instrumental on the album, but that's a minor complaint.  This is very good stuff that no Van Halen fan thought they would ever hear again.  Do yourself a favor and don't try to compare this to the old stuff.  Just enjoy it for what it is - a very strong album and a miracle that these guys ever got back together at all.
B004A8ZWW4|5.0|This movie suprised me at the movies.  It was packed full of drama and plenty of action.  The movie is suppose to take place in 2020 where robots are the main attraction.  I really liked this movie and the soundtrack is pretty good also.  Its worth seeing.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|I highly recommend this CD. Adele is an old Soul that puts her heart into her lyrics! I Love everything that she does!
B006O5Y0SS|1.0|O.k. It started off pretty interesting but later I was like what????  O.W. was visiting Paris with his girlfriend. At night he found himself back in the 1940's or 50's as he was wondering streets at night.  Was it because he was looking for excitement?  I found this movie boring with very little action.  It's a good movie to watch at night if you want to go to sleep, really.

B004WDRT1Y|5.0|great product...3D really makes the picture stand out  ran effortless and no reason not to like the movie if you liked the movie before
B0071QIN00|2.0|fact is that this game is missing a LOT of polish. bugs out every other attempt at playing. I stick my front tire in ramps waaay to often. got as a free app of the day, but would have been sorely sorry to have paid money for it. one of feints least polished games. verry dissapointed.
B0059XTUMC|5.0|I'm a silent film enthusiast, and have been so for over 25 years. I had the rare pleasure of being able to see many silents, in one screen theatres, with actual live organ accompaniment. So, I became hooked on the artistry and how music plays such an important part of any silent film.<br /><br />The Artist was a film project I'm sure wasn't welcomed by producers and finance men. After all, little speaking, black and white, and subtitles aren't considered terrific box office today. I'm glad someone did recognize how brilliant and beautiful this film could be.<br /><br />Jean Dujardin gives the performance of the year. No question. Funny, sad, using his body the way silent stars did so well. Berenice Bejo matches him in every scene. Her pantomime with Geroge's jacket, in an early scene in the film, as she relives dancing with him, is tender and will bring a tear to your eye. Their dance routines took months to choreograph, and they were able students.<br /><br />The cinematography is outstanding, as is the period and other music. And of course, Uggie rules the whole film--he's a true supporting character.<br /><br />Best film of 2011.

B006GH6IWU|5.0|With all the others reviews here - especially the one posted already by Poetmater - I won't go into the details of this DVD which includes the two-part, two-hour documentary made for, and broadcast by, the BBC plus nearly an hour of bonus materials including 3 deleted scenes and 7 videos. I did note from another review that there are a significant number of additional deleted scenes on the Bluray version but, since I was sent the standard DVD version, I cannot comment on them. Hardcore Queen fans - of which there are many - may want to opt for the BD. As for me, I really enjoyed their music but was more of a casual fan during their tenure so I actually learned things new to me from the extensive contemporary interviews with the band members, their manager and the various producers, plus a few music journalists.<br /><br />I've seen at least one of the Under Review titles about the band but they tend to have more journalists and virtually no band members and the quality of the performance video in the UR Dvds is just \\"ok\\".<br /><br />So, from the standpoint of the casual Queen fan, this one gets 5 stars from me - as much of the BBC-TV quality is here.<br /><br />Steve Ramm<br />\\"Anything Phonographic\\"
1439192812|2.0|I have never read a book by this author, so I did some research on him prior to reading this text.  I was impressed with what I read, although I felt a little gaurded when I read the titles to his other books, alluding to some biases he may have to other perspectives.  With that said, I found The magic of reality optimistic, albeit elementary in presentation; I tend to resent those who make their points by insulting a perspective seen as their opposite...it's childish.
B0063IH60K|5.0|very enjoyable. The challenge level can be adjusted by choosing random or winning deals. Even the winning deals can be a challenge and sometimes need to be replayed in order to win. Lots of settings for personalizing.
B003W9I9JU|5.0|for everyone who thinks this is a place to complain about amazon prime--suck it.  for anyone who actually loves this series, this is a truly cool story; i don't want to SPOIL anything, but it is not often that anyone gets one over on the doctor.
B004EJUMT2|5.0|RULE #1- If you're going to dress up as hooded, satanic monks and have a singer in a skull painted face, robes, and anti-pope hat, you'd better be damned good! Well, GHOST is fantastic! OPUS EPONYMOUS is like an unholy blend of BLUE OYSTER CULT, DEVIL'S MEAT, BLACK SABBATH, and MERCYFUL FATE. From the Gothic keyboard intro to the acoustic guitar ending, these guys get devil music right! RITUAL, SATAN PRAYER, and ELIZABETH are dark, atmospheric classics! As a rabid fan of 1970s devil movies (RACE WITH THE DEVIL, BROTHERHOOD OF SATAN, THE DEVIL'S REIGN, etc.), GHOST fits perfectly into my music collection...
B00005JKGO|5.0|I have not seen this movie in many years.  Therefore, my commentary is based on a somewhat hazy recollection about a movie that would merit a few class discussions in a college-level film course.  The movie begins, ironically, with a helicopter toting a statue of Christ above Rome, I suppose not too far from Vatican City. The helicopter scene is in contrast to the decadence and hypocricy with which the protagonist, a tabloid reporter played by Mastroianni, in time realizes he must struggle.  Casting Anita Ekberg as an emblem of what is decadent and almost sordid was an intelligent decision by Fellini.<br /><br />In due course, the protagonist comes to understand that he exists (does not really live) in a world of no values.  The Ekberg character is an object of fan worship, and ultimately, emptiness.  She is a mere idol.  In time, the Mastroianni character meets a very young woman waitress who serves him.  He seems to see in her a decency that is foreign to the world he inhabits, a world of popularity, materialism, the jet set, and parties.  At the end of the movie, he is on the beach and again sees the young woman in the distance,  I believe with her family if my memory is correct. I view the ending as one of hope, because the Mastroianni character fully realizes that the beauty and appreciation of life is in innocense and decency rather than debauchery, materialism and empty self-gratification.  There is hope for this individual.<br /><br />The film's message is still timely.  In the 1980s, the public was treated to \\"Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous,\\" which attempted to engender envy about the lives of entertainment idols who could afford the best food and retreat to Carribean resorts costing thousands of dollars per night.  In more recent times, there are the reality shows on TV in which in one of the shows three sisters crave what is material and empty and spend much of their time projecting dissatisfaction and jealousy.  In another, three young women lived with a magazine magnate in a world of self-indulgence, displaying themselves physically to garner adulation and a life of parties and childish fun.  The pity is in the inability to recognize what constitutes valid self-worth.  I mention these parallels because La Dolce Vita delivers a message that is, most unfortunately, being ignored.<br /><br />I'd recommend this movie to anyone as a reminder of the need, especially at the present time,  for a moral compass. A viewing of this film might just serve as an effective reminder, for anyone who thinks, that the current culture has not progressed  from 1961 when this was released.  This is a movie with a thoughtful aspect.

B0054JZC6E|3.0|ok.  hate you have to have points to unlock levels. some of the games are kind of childish. could be better.
B005HSG3VK|5.0|The case is wonderful! It fits tight and secured in the case. It's light weight and doesn't add any extra bulk to the kindle itself. It was the right shade of pink that I was hoping for haha. The flap is durable for protecting the screen and to fold it back so the kindle is on an angle by its self. Very good product...would buy it all over again if I had to. :)
B0055SWM08|5.0|I downloaded this game this morning and was instantly captivated.  Challenging enough to stay interesting, but not so difficult that you end up overwhelmed.  Music is nice and relaxing.
B000WC39ZY|1.0|If you like movies from the 30s, 40s, and 50s - particularly musicals - you'll hate this. It's modern Hollywood filth. My copy is now in the wastebasket.
B0064NTZJO|5.0|If you can handle the blood and guts, then you'll love this movie.  Great cast with Michelle Williams and Ryan Gosling.  Great story.  Unbelievable performance by Albert Brooks who always plays a sweet funny man.
B004EPZ0AM|1.0|First was amazing, this was created just to try and take your money. Was horrible! Go watch the first one, leave this one alone!
B0034G4P9E|5.0|I knew nothing much about this film when I ordered it.  Just hear from critics on the radio, reviews I read, and word of mouth.  It is a GREAT film.  A wonderful story of two brothers and their father.  Nick Nolte is terrific!  He should be nominated.  His performance is THAT good.
0545425115|5.0|My teenage daughter insisted I read this and, I admit, it had me engrossed from start to finish. This is the first person account of a young girl in a post-Apocalyptic world who volunteers as \\"tribute\\" from her district to participate in what is essentially a reality TV show, The Hunger Games. Twenty-four kids, ranging in age from 12-18, representing 12 districts in what was once North America, are primped and prepared to fight to the death in a wilderness arena. They must find their own food and water, shelter, weaponry and companionship. Only one will survive and return home a hero.<br /><br />Reading The Hunger Games was like watching a gorier version of the television show Survivor. It included both loathsome and likeable players, alliances, back-stabbing, solid friendships and even a love story.<br /><br />Katniss and Peeta are the girl and boy from District 12, who their mentors and stylists present to the viewing audience as star-crossed lovers. Peeta is actually in love with Katniss; however, she is a hard-nosed, focused hunter and only believes she's playing a role through the Games. For example, she has been instructed that every kiss she gives Peeta may result in a reward, or some kind of treat or necessity from her mentor/sponsors. That the reader is aware of Peeta's true feelings and Katniss is not, is part of what makes it a simplistic and even silly love story. But I think that's testimony to the genius of the author. It magnifies how reality TV can be both inane and riveting at the same time.<br /><br />I believe it was the good writing and the author's technique/story-telling ability that made me turn the pages non-stop until I finished. As for the subject matter? File this one under \\"guilty pleasure.\\"
B005BDZN62|5.0|I have loved this film for 40yrs. of my life!  It doesn't get any better than on Blu-ray!  I had it on DVD and as soon as I saw it on blu-ray I ordered it.  The dancing, the singing, and the story is incredible.  My favorite musical of all time and the story is timeless.  A MUST for your collection.
B000002VMD|5.0|Her gift and status during her peak will always be her legacy.  We all overcome obstacles to greatness, not all of us overcome our demons.  In her day, no one could touch npher impeccable voice and perfect pitch.  She had style and class, something that is sorely lacking in the divas of today.  If Whitney never sang another note after this soundtrack, she would still be hailed as one of the greatest voices----- period.
B005V2EVBQ|4.0|I was looking for a modestly priced, simple cover and was pleased with my purchase. This cover has an elastic strap to hold the front flap closed tight, or hold it to the back of the Kindle. You can fold the front flap in half behind the tablet to sit the Kindle up landscape style for movie watching. Simple, doesn't make the Kindle bulky, lightweight,  easy to wipe clean, sturdy plastic corners. I would recommend.
B000002VSN|5.0|The Preacher's Wife remains my favorite CD because it shows Whitney at her best.  When she sang Gospel she was in her element for Whitney's training entailed singing in the choir as a youth under the direction of the great Cissy Houston who also let Whitney tag along whenever she did backup for Aretha Franklin.  Wow it just doesn't get any better than that.<br /><br />My favorite song on The Preacher's Wife is \\"I Love the Lord\\".  If you want to hear clarity, control, range, spirit and emotion, this song has it all, including her trademark --the Almighty high note.<br /><br />Her gift and status during her peak will always be her legacy.  In her day, no one could touch her impeccable voice and perfect pitch.  She had style and class, something that is sorely lacking in divas today.  If Whitney never sang another note after her triumph in the movie \\"The Bodyguard\\"  she would still be hailed as one of the greatest voices----- period.  But she did continue to sing and share her gift, and for that I am forever grateful.  In my humble opinion, Whitney's wonderful range and vocal abilities were best utilized when she sang gospel, as illustrated in this uplifting soundtrack.  After all, it gave her an opportunity to return to her roots.<br />RIP, Whitney Houston.
B0073LWEXK|5.0|I love this game. I have to disagree with those that feel it is too short. for $1.99 it is a good length if you don't use the hints. I like that the hints are right there if you do need them though. beautiful graphics and nice music. great job fire maple!

B003XF1XOQ|2.0|If you want a more in depth opinion and analysis to why it was such a disappointment, go read any of the reviews here. They all will essentially tell you the same thing that's wrong with, \\"Mockingjay.\\" So I'm just going to keep this short.<br /><br />This last book seemed rushed and was hard to understand at many points. The characters didn't seem like themselves at all. It was boring. The ending battle was a confusing whirlwind (I actually thought it was a dream at first....the writing was just so sloppy at this point). The resolution with who she chose (Gale or Peeta) seemed like a complete afterthought. Kind of like, \\"Oh, and by the way....she chose _____. The End.\\"<br /><br />It essentially felt nothing like the first two installments. I'd actually recommend not even reading it. Just read a summary of what happend and make your own tale in your head to how it reached its conclusion.

B005LAIGSC|5.0|\\"Safe House\\" is great! This is how the story goes: For the past year, Matt Weston has been frustrated by his inactive, backwater post in Cape Town. A \\"housekeeper\\" who aspires to be a full-fledged agent, the loyal company man has been waiting for an opportunity to prove himself. When the first and only occupant he's had proves to be the most dangerous man he's ever met, Weston readies for duty. Tobin Frost has eluded capture for almost a decade. One of the best ops men that the CIA's known, the ex-intelligence officer has given up assets and sold military intel to anyone with cash since he turned. From trading secrets to North Korea to aiding splinter cells, the damage he's done to the U.S. is immeasurable. And he's now back on the reservation with a secret. As soon as Frost is brought in for debriefing, mercenaries come and tear apart Weston's safe house. Barely escaping, the unlikely partners must discover if their attackers have been sent by terrorists or someone on the inside who will kill anyone standing in the way. Now it's up to Weston to figure out who he can trust before they're both eliminated from the game.  The cast led by Denzel Washington (who also executive produced) (as Tobin Frost) & Ryan Reynolds (as Matt Weston) is great. The directing by Daniel Espinosa is great. The story & screenplay by David Guggenheim is great.  The music by Ramin Djawadi is great. The cinematography by Oliver Wood is great. The film editing by Richard Pearson is great. The casting by Sarah Finn is great. The production design by Brigitte Broch is great. The art direction by Jonathan Hely-Hutchinson, Shira Hockman, Pablo Maestre Galli & Erik Polczwartek is great. The set decoration by Melinda Launspach, Andrew McCarthy & Tom Olive is great. The costume design by Susan Matheson is great.  This is a great action thriller that keeps you on the edge of your seat with your heart racing and your mind thinking at the same time. Denzel Washington is great as usual in another memorable performance. This is another great film on Denzel's resume.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I am an author myself, and indie author, trying to fight my way into the arena of the big time authors and publishing houses. I read with a critical eye because of it. This book was recommended to me and I wearily agreed to read it. I couldn't put it down! I have spent this Saturday totally neglecting everything I need to do. I could not go to bed tonight until I finished it. I have already purchased the next two in the series. Way to go Ms. Collins and from one author to another, congratulations on your huge success. You deserve it.
B004EPZ070|1.0|I've read all of Emily Giffin's books and always feel they are a cut above the average chick-lit. I was anxious to catch the movie although it was poorly rated.  Five minutes into it, I could see why. PLEASE Hollywood, stop casting Kate Hudson. The best cast member is John K, but he is poorly supported by the rest. The film was unbearably long or so it seemed, and it was in need of severe editing. Surprisingly, Kate's best scene is when she screams at her BFF; the rest of her cutesy/blonde/hip/cool actions were just plain awful. I did enjoy the scene in the park because Emily Giffin is sitting on the next bench reading her book: Something Blue.
B005QJZ5FA|4.0|Lana Del Rey's debut album is finally here. It is a testament to the small things in life: Pabst Blue Ribbon, Heart-Shaped Sunglasses, and Coney Island. From the deeply resonating atmospherics to the fast beats of tracks like \\"Off to the Races\\", Del Rey manages to shine in her strong debut, although her \\"signature style\\" sometimes winds up a little too overwhelming for regular audiences.<br /><br />The album starts off strong, with her already classic tracks \\" Born to Die\\", \\"Video Games\\", and even \\"Blue Jeans\\". Amdist these powerful ballads is the gem \\"Off to the Races\\", which was previously released, but is definately worth a listen for anyone who hasn't heard Lana sing. It is one of the highlights of the album.<br /><br />After the first four tracks, the CD looses some of its steam and forward momentum. \\"Diet Mountain Dew\\" is a good track (clearly where my review title comes from) and so is \\"Radio\\" which has some outstanding vocals. Here we are greeted by the beautiful \\"Dark Paradise\\", which is, in my humble opinion, the best song on the entire album.<br /><br />The last part of the CD is, to be honest, slightly dissapointing. There was an excellent build for the first 8 or so tracks, but the final group feels re-hashed and overdone. All of the same themes of death, lost love, and gold-chain necklaces are present in \\"Carmen\\", \\"Million Dollar Man\\", \\"Summertime Sadness\\" and \\"This is What Makes us Girls\\". The last track is probably the best in this section, and they truly are enjoyable to listen to, once or twice.<br /><br />In Conclusion, I think a lot of people should purchase this album. If they're unsure, download \\"Video Games\\", \\"Dark Paradise\\", and \\"Off to the Races\\". If you like what you hear, get the rest. This is a game-changer for the Pop-Music Genre. Even post-Adele, Lana Del Rey still manages to innovate amidst the likes of Katy Perry and Lady Gaga.<br /><br />4/5 Stars
B003G4W49C|5.0|There are some books which have wormed their way into our hearts and have ended up as classics, this book is one of those.

It's a book that will challenge everything you hold dear and in the end seeing things in a way you never thought you could. This is one book, if any, that will forever change you and will forever stay with you.

B002KSPKRS|5.0|I bought this headphone since I wanted a Dolby Digital wireless headphone for my PS3 but I didn't need the PX5 programmable preset features and sure didn't want to pay the extra cash for it. By the time which I bought it, these two were the only options in the market (today you may also consider Sony's official PS3 wireless headphones).  I currently don't use mic but I figured that if I will need one, I can buy the Ear Force PBT (which even if combined with the X41 still cost less than the PX5). Installation is very easy, I also connected it to my TV set (using the analog input) so I can enjoy quality sound while watching TV. I recommend buying a USB power adapter (I bought the cheapest I found) and connect it to an AC outlet and not to the PS3 USB input (the less power which is consumed by the PS3 the longer it will live...). The headphone are light-weight and the audio quality is superb (I'm not an audiophile, so you better read some professional reviews). I also bought rechargeable batteries since I use these headphone almost every day (I use it about 1 hour every day and charge it once in two weeks).  I recommend these headphone although it is not a cheap choice (it cost almost as half as a new PS3!)

030788743X|5.0|I walked into Ready Player One with no background info or hype and enjoyed it immensely.  I picked up the audiobook from audible.com on a whim (narrated by Will Wheaton!). It's Willy Wonka meets World of Warcraft in the not so distant gloomy future.  Full disclosure, I'm a big nerd. Especially for the 80's and 90's so this book was right in my wheelhouse. This book from start to finish hit all the right parts of my nerd heart with out fail.<br /><br />Now if you're looking for something of a classic read ala Dickens or Hemingway, well, go read Dickens or Hemingway. This book is total popcorn. But it's the best tasting popcorn dipped in chocolate, covered in sprinkles, and wrapped in an 8-bit rainbow. It's an amusement park with all your favorite rides and no lines - total nerd porn.<br /><br />Some of the scenes in this book are so WTF awesome. &lt;MILD SPOILERS> Ever want to play as Mathew Broderick in War Games?

B001AR0D4A|3.0|I already own the dvd version and this is certainly not the most stunning HD release, I've actually had issues with it loading and it skipped around visually at least 4 times that forced me to back scan and make sure it wasn't defective. I use my PS3 for watching Blu-ray movies and this is the first Blu-ray that has skipped around in a glitchy way. I still need to watch the B&W version, so yeah.

B006W0QOF2|5.0|I cant believe these people giving the movie a one star review are for real here. They write a couple sentences blasting the film because they wanted mindless action scenes, and complaining that there were scenes with little dialog. It bothers me that people will trash a film like this if there isnt something flashing on screen to keep their attention. If thats the kind of movie you really want, then go watch some mindless summer blockbuster like Fast and the Furious where you can see flashy car chases for an hour and a half with no story and cardboard acting. Your brain wont need to work very hard to process whats going on so you can just sit there and enjoy the bright colorful images on screen to keep you entertained.  If, however you can take a movie at face value and can keep an open mind and give some thought to whats happening and read between lines, then give this film a chance because you will not be disappointed. Drive follows the story of a stunt car/getaway driver who manages to pull himself into a dark situation very quickly without spoiling too much. It manages to blend the 70's car chase films with 80's visuals and music along with a 90's David Lynch film plot and vibe. Yes, there are parts in the film where the dialog is light, but you dont need words to convey emotion or to pull you into the world director Nicolas Winding Refn has made. The mix of the amazing soundtrack and acting in this film really is phenomenal and characters talking non stop isnt needed to understand what is happening.
0802473156|4.0|When I first attempted to read this book I was \\"put off\\" by Mr. Chapman's language. In the realms of religion, marriage, society, and culture, we are nearly polar opposites. Yet I found his premise, that people in relationships who understand how love manifests itself and can communicate that to their partner, will be better equipped to have a healthy relationship. Unfortunately it wasn't until the end of the book that one of couples Chapman speaks about ended up going their separate ways. The reality is, knowing the 5 love languages doesn't guarantee togetherness. Chapman's 5 keys to how love is communicated is easy to remember and therefore easy to put into action in one's daily life (with a significant other, family member, friend, or coworker). The other concept that is stunningly easy and yet thought provoking is, \\"love is a choice\\", especially once the infatuation is gone. This book is worth reading even if you have to tolerate Chapman's style (Protestant, white, male).
B001OQCV6A|4.0|I know the reviews for this film were less than stellar, but it really was quite fun to watch.  I love Sherlock Holmes stories and truly enjoy experiencing the creative ways people adapt and interpret this character.  The movie kept me engrossed - what more can you ask?  Robert Downey may not be the first person to spring to mind when thinking of Holmes, but he made the character live and breathe for me.  I especially liked his relationship with Watson, way different than the old Basil Rathbone movies (which I loved).  Give it a try.  I think you'll like it.
B00190N4E4|5.0|[[ASIN:B000KX0IOA Gandhi (Widescreen Two-Disc Collector's Edition)]]   Ghandi (1982) greatly played by Ben Kingsley and directed by Richard Attenborough. A great movie that started a revolution in India.  It tells the history of Mahatma Ghandi, Hindu lawyer that was living in South Africa in 1893 and disagreed with the way the Indian people were treated in their country by the British. He organized pacific demonstrations to oppose against the British Empire on one of his gatherings he said to all his followers \\"They may torture my body, break my bones, even kill me then they will have my dead body, but NOT my obedience. After he was imprisoned, he returned to India in 1915, travel most of his country by train and saw firsthand the state of poverty the Indian people were enduring and the injustices being committed by the British even though India was part of the Empire it was not seen as such by the British that all they wanted was to exploit the Indian people and not allowed them the freedom to manage their lives and prosper.  Ghandi, began speaking to the people and asking the British to give not only Indians, but also Muslims their independence. Ghandi started to spread his philosophy of non-violent protest across all India, organizing days of prayer where no one will work (the British call it strikes), pacific demonstrations and essentially no matter what the British did to him or the population no one will harm or kill a British, that violence will not be responded with more violence and through all this demonstrations make the British Empire understand that the people of India do not want to be rule by someone else, that they want to be ruled by themselves. In this process Ghandi did not only fought for everyone but for any religion in the country, Hindus, Muslims or Christian. Gandhi also undertook long fasts as means of both self-purification, and social protest, and arrested various times as a form of repression. He also spend a lot of time in \\"charkha\\" oneof the oldest known forms of the spinning wheel making his own clothing or dhoti the traditional men's garment.  Gabdhi's wife dies victim of a thrombosis and a heart attack. After many years of perseverance the British Empire recognizes the independence of India. But a new issue arises that muslims believed that they will now be ruled by Indians, and Indians believed that muslims would be given to much, new fights begging between Indians and Muslims. Gandhi concerned, fasts and asks for the fighting to stop and for the unity of Muslims and Hindus. Eventually the fighting stops because everyone fears that Ghandi might die. The movie ends with the dead of Mahatma Ghandi, assassinated.  This movie reflects the battle that Ghandi fought not for just one group of people or religion but for all of India. Religion matter to him and he respected every other believes, but I think that not many people saw that vision.

0071762345|5.0|I bought this book primarily out of self interest. I'm not a marketing manager, and right now I'm still in the beginning phases of trying to build a photography business. I don't have a business degree and I've never been in a marketing position, but I am very interested in sales and marketing in general, so I often read these types of books for my own enjoyment. If I can use anything to my advantage, all the better. \\"Likeable\\" was a great read, never dry and \\"business-y\\", and even though I already knew some of the basic information covered, I learned much more. I often found myself saying things like, \\"No kidding!\\" and briefly setting down the book to look up something that was mentioned. (Have you heard of Blentec Blenders? YouTube them!)  In the few days that I spent reading (and using!) \\"Likeable,\\" I increased my own Facebook likes by 10%, and for the first time ever managed to get above the 30 people \\"talking about this\\" mark. My copy is filled with post-it flags labeling points I want to implement and remember. I can't wait to see how much further this book can take me.  I wanted to tell Dave Kerpen how much I liked the book, so I figured I'd take advantage of his offer (in the book) to contact him via twitter. I sent him a quick tweet saying how much I loved the book, then gave a separate shout-out to the book. In less than an hour, I got a personal response to both tweets. That completely sealed the deal for me. Dave practices what he preaches, and I'd recommend his book to anyone who is looking to improve their business presence on the social media scene.

1560100842|4.0|Some of you searching for a book like this are probably students such as myself. I must say that this book is perfect for people who are interested in trying their hand at animation. When I purchased this book, I was enrolled in an animation/games program at my school but I had never really made any animations aside from some spur of the moment flipbooks and stopmotion videos. Despite this, I wanted to make sure that animation was the career for me and I wanted to build up my skills so that I could be ahead of my classmates.<br /><br />This book was perfect! It taught me the basics of many different techniques and principles that are the foundations for all animation, not just cartoons! Thanks to me spending one summer and a winter break with this book, I not only learned many skills at a more advanced level than most of my classmates, but more importantly, I learned DISCIPLINE. If you watch any review with animators on Youtube or if you have the opportunity to speak to one in person, do not be surprised if the main advice they give you is to have discipline. By using these exercises, I taught myself drawing stamina and the discipline to keep improving on my work.<br /><br />A word of caution: many animators and reviewers on this site are probably going to advise that any \\"serious\\" animators skip over this book and check out Richard Williams' \\"Animator's Survival Kit\\". My opinion: start with Preston Blair's book first, then, if you are sure you are serious about animation, check out Williams book. I recently acquired the \\"Survival Kit\\" and while it is an excellent resource for animators in all fields, it will most likely intimidate beginners.  If I had read Williams' book before Blair's I probably would have been put off by its encyclopedic size and its pages-upon-pages of massive keyframe breakdowns.<br /><br />I do take points off for some outdatedness. While some information such as the infamous \\"ball bounce breakdown\\" in this book is somewhat outdated (Kahl's method is considered the standard nowadays),other methods, such as cel animations and limited animation for tv is even more outdated! You will be hard-pressed to find a studio that still uses cels and traditional film animation cameras. But even these aren't terrible problems since those chapters are educational and show what the industry used to look like not too long ago (this book was first written in the 80s, and I believe that the most recent edition update is from the early 90s).<br /><br />If you are studying primarily computer animation such as myself, you will probably find that the basic principles are still relevant to CG, but that the absence of a mention of computers to be strange. Considering that Blair passed away in the mid-90s it is probably inevitable that computer animation would not be touched upon.<br /><br />Despite this, this book is an important first step into the right direction.d nowadays),other methods, such as cel animations and limited animation for tv is even more outdated!

B005LTDPFW|4.0|Every album on The Complete RCA Albums Collection is interesting and worth hearing at least once no matter where one stands on Nina Simone.  Whether a person needs to own all of these albums depends on how much of a fan you are.  Certainly, \\"Nina Simone Sings the Blues,\\" the first album on this set is an undisputed classic.  However, the other albums are of varying quality, though, in my opinion, the live sets are the best.  Nina Simone's voice, though, was on the decline after 1969 so this is not the place to start listening to Nina Simone (that would be either her first Colpix albums or the excellent Phillips set \\"Four Women).<br /><br />The biggest caveat about this box set is that the order of the songs on each CD has been changed from the track listing on the LPs.  Since there are no individual liner notes for any of these albums, there appears to be no good reason for this.  Additionally, there are a number of bonus singles and live tracks that have been interspersed throughout the albums.  I, for one, am happy to have these songs, but the way they have been added compromises the integrity of the original albums.  I wish they would have kept the original track listing and added these songs at the end.<br /><br />As far as the albums go, here are my thoughts:<br /><br />\\"Nina Simone Sings the Blues\\" (5 out of 5 stars) -- This is an essential set for collectors as well as the casual fan.  Simone is in fine voice throughout and the quality of the songs is outstanding with a fine balance of classic blues songs (\\"I Want a Little Sugar in My Bowl\\") and protest songs (\\"Backlash Blues,\\" which was written by Simone and Langston Hughes).<br /><br />\\"Silk and Soul\\" (3 1/2 out of 5 stars) -- Too much silk and not enough soul.  There are some absolute classic songs on this set (\\"I Wish I Knew How it Would Feel to be Free\\" being one of my all-time favorites), but there are too many average 60s pop songs (\\"The Look of Love\\") and the arrangements are a little blah.<br /><br />\\"Nuff Said\\" (4 out of 5 stars) -- This is a historically important set recorded three days after the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King and Simone's pain is palpable at times.  Not every song is a classic, but the songs Simone recorded to commemorate King's life (\\"Why?  The King of Love is Dead\\" in particular) are wrenching.<br /><br />\\"Nina Simone and Piano\\" (2 1/2 out of 5 stars) -- The idea of Nina Simone singing and playing piano without accompaniment is a terrific one, but this album really doesn't do anything for me.  It's as if Simone started retreating into herself in 1969; I can't imagine many people really wanting to hear this album a second time.  Not one of the songs really sticks, though this is clearly a very personal album for her.<br /><br />\\"To Love Somebody\\" (3 1/2 out of 5 stars) -- This is when Nina Simone surrendered to the demands of her audience and fully dove into the new rock sounds of the day -- to varying results.  I think her versions of \\"Suzanne\\" \\"To Love Somebody\\" is quite good, but I don't think any of these covers top the originals, much less top the high bar she set with her version of \\"Don't Let me Be Misunderstood\\".  However, her riffing on the Beatles' \\"Revolution\\" is truly something special and makes the album worth more than a cursory glance.<br /><br />\\"Black Gold\\" (3 out of 5 stars) -- This is another live set, with Simone singing passionately (though no longer in top form).  There is not a bad song on it, but given how many live albums Simone has recorded, this one really doesn't stand out.<br /><br />\\"Here Comes the Sun\\" (4 out of 5 stars) -- Like \\"To Love Somebody,\\" this is another collection of 60s pop/rock songs.  However, this time round, Simone makes these songs her own -- her version of the oft-recorded \\"My Way\\" is really unique.  The bonus tracks, especially \\"22nd Century\\" also work particularly well with these songs.<br /><br />\\"Emergency Ward\\" (4 1/2 out of 5 stars) -- On this live set, Simone fully integratesher pop/rock experiments into her uniquely soulful folk sound.  Her versions of George Harrison's \\"My Sweet Lord\\" and \\"Isn't it a Pity\\" are standouts, though the track listing has been inexplicably altered.<br /><br />\\"It is Finished\\" (4 1/2 out of 5 stars) -- This was Nina Simone's last album for four years, and what an album!  On this live set, Simone experiments with the world sounds of India and the Caribbean to exceptional result.  Her voice might not be what it was in the mid 60s, but her unique interpretive skills and passion remain undiminished.My Sweet Lord\\" and \\"Isn't it a Pity\\" are standouts, though the track listing has been inexplicably altered.  \\"It is Finished\\" (4 1/2 out of 5 stars) -- This was Nina Simone's last album for four years, and what an album!

B0068MNO4S|1.0|Just finished watching this movie.  This movie had a great idea -- original and appealing.  I absolutely love all things Shakespeare.  HOWEVER, it was very difficult for me to get into the movie, because of all the shifts from present, past, and earlier past.  I couldn't easily follow who was young Edward, old Edward, young Cecil, old Cecil, whose father, the multiple Earls, etc.  I had to REALLY REALLY pay attention to figure out all the characters which took away from enjoying the story!  All in all, it seem jumbled together with the varying timelines and subplots.  While concept was great, there was clearly not enough focus on executing a solid story line.

I've seen the Phantom many times on stage in Southern California - but this one... well, it simply takes this amazing show to an entirely new level.  The acting is superb. The vocal quality of highest caliber.  I think you can tell that I am overwhelmed by this production.

B003X2O6KW|5.0|This is a disclaimer: I don't flow hip-hop.  In fact, I don't flow music with same veracity that I did in my youth.  But regardless of that, I still know what I like and feel that there is talent among the artists.  However, unlike a needle in a haystack, the art does sift its way to the top.  Upon first hearing the single \\"Power\\", I felt like I was hearing not just a hip-hop musician, but a pop artist.  With West's amalgamation of chant, rock and rap, he creates a brilliant tableau of music as a whole.  Most people look at hip-hop as a secondary art.  This is sad for them; since there is a depth to the work here.  What Kanye is doing is addressing two aspects of his psyche, the id which comes out in the impulses that makes him a target and the ego that strives or something much higher.  This is found from the very beginning of the album as Niki Minaj sits us down for a story that is like an old Grimm fairytale that segues into a chorus of the heavenly choir.  These somber moments are what gives My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy its emotional weight.  Kanye is playing with a persona that even he himself hasn't cultivated.  On \\"Monster\\", his eyes flash red as he is committing atrocities on everyone that comes into contact with him.  This is not a reality, but part of that fantasy that has grown up around him.  He uses that to make a point about the perception that the media prism refracts and he is just refracting back at them like a game of telephone.  The album's centerpiece, \\"Runaway\\", is what brings this collection into focus.  The mix of styles, from hip-hop to R&B, to classical to pop, shows the ambition that West is going for.  This isn't just some fly-by-night rapper just making music for a buck.  Much like Radiohead he wants to push music forward, busting out whole walls with just a piano line.  This track also focus on the vulnerability that most artists are afraid to express from a place of power.  But this is what makes the song so accessible to anyone and everyone, without sacrificing the unique sound.  Now I am not going to say that there isn't any flaws in this work.  Most masterpieces aren't perfect, which is why they are so human.  The noodling at the end of \\"Blame Game\\" comes off as much similar to \\"Wild Honey Pie\\" or \\"Revolution #9\\" on The Beatles.  But that is certainly not something to dock this endevour  as a whole.  Kayne West breaks his heart open like a walnut and allows us into all the nooks and crannies of his soul.

B0068RHSCW|3.0|I've been thinking about this review for almost a week. I watched the movie when the DVD came out last week and it seems a hard movie to get a handle on, not because the plot is too involved or twists around too much but because the movie doesn't really leave a lasting impression when its over.<br /><br />Daniel Craig plays Will Atenton an editor who is quitting his day job to write the great American novel. He moves in with his wife Libby, Rachel Weisz and two girls into their dream house, a picturesque house that looks like its right out of a Hallmark Christmas card. Then Will starts hearing disembodied voices in the walls, but discovers its only local teenagers sneaking into the basement and discovers that Hallmark house was the scene of a horrific murder, in which a father kills his wife and two girls. From there Libby starts \\"knowing\\" where the wife was murdered, and Naomi Watts as the neighbor Ann Patterson has a secret she won't divulge to Will.<br /><br />Dream House isn't a bad movie, the acting by Craig, Weisz, and Watts is uniformly good, and even the story is good, but uniform describes everything well, it's a well crafted movie but there's nothing spectacular or anything that makes the movie stand out in any way. The twist in the plot is given away about half way through the movie and I was expecting another twist that never came. Dream House is like buying a suit off the rack, it looks nice and people will say it looks good on you but doesn't fit like a tailored suit.
B005RJ6AIK|5.0|First, the movie: Extremely well-done, though sad and serious overall, and well-worth seeing.  Second, the soundtrack: An hour of the best Hawaiian music one can imagine. I lived in Hawaii for three years back in the late '70's, and learned to enjoy their music, even without knowing the language. All you have to do is figure each song declares love for one or more of the following: Land, water, rain, flowers, natives, birds, fish, volcanoes, sugar cane, pineapples, cliffs, mountains, palm trees, outrigger canoes or family. There is only one track on here that I do not love, and you might even like that one. For the price, you simply cannot get a better taste of Hawaiian music in Amazon's entire catalogue. (I checked.)
B0049D1TCM|5.0|This CD is one of my favorites.  Now keep in mind that I am a fan old \\"old nicki\\" back in her mixtape days.  I am, and always have been a Nicki Minaj fan as a rapper, NOT a singer, or pop idol.  But, with that said, I feel that this CD showed more to this Queen's girl then ever anticipated.  Half of this album seems to be deovted to her old core base: rap.  With song's like \\"Roman's Revenge\\" and \\"Did it on 'Em\\", it proves satisfying for Nicki's rap fans.  But the other half, shows a softer side.  With the ballad, \\"Right Thru Me\\" and emotionally-charged \\"Save Me\\" she shows us not only her talent for singing, but a more radio-friendly side.  1) I'm the Best-  This song is a nice introduction to the album.  Not the strongest track on the album in my opinion, but it eases you into some of the rap of the album, but also some pop feel with it.  4/5  2)Roman's Revenge ft. Eminem- Well, here it is.  One of my favorites from the album.  We see the introduction to her alter-ego, Roman in this song, and she doesn't ease up.  Along with Slim Shady, they tear up this song with an almost chaotic feel to it. 5/5  3)Did it on 'Em- Once again, she hits us with another song reminiscent of mixtape days.  With a sick beak and very catchy hooks, this is another great! 5/5  4)Right Thru Me- I will be honest, this wasn't my favorite song at first.  But it grew on me.  This song truly showcases the soft side to Nicki.  Pretty song and big change of pace from previous songs! 4/5  5)Fly Ft. Rihanna- Another one of my favorite songs of the album.  Rihanna and Nicki wonderfully collabarate vocals on this very pop-ish song.  In my opionion, most pop-orientated song of the album, but executed wonderfully. 5/5  6)Save Me- Most beautiful song on the album. Very soft, but impactful strong. Do note that there is not any rap in this song, once again making her core fans scratching their heads.  Still nonetheless, 5/5  7)Moment 4 Life ft. Drake- Favorite song on the album. Love the beat, lyrics, and let's just say that if Nicki Minaj and Drake aren't secretly in love, then call me surprised!  Excellent song 5/5  8)Check It Out ft. Will.I.Am- I, to this day, am still on the edge.  I have never been much of a Will.I.Am fan, so I don't care for his part in this, but Nicki slays her verses in this song, making up for it's flaws. 3.5/5  9)Blazin ft. Kanye West- Rap fans rejoice!  This song features some of Nicki's best rap verses on the album and Kanye also kills several bars on this song. 5/5  10)Here I Am- This is the album's oddity, I feel.  I like the song a lot, however. It has partial feeling of Save Me, but a little bit faster paced.  A little bit of rap, little bit of singing.  Nice song. 4.5/5  11)Dear Old Nicki- Nicki's song addressing \\"Old Nicki\\" and acknowledging she has changed.  Strong lyrics, but still not my favorite.  Very pop-ish feel to it as well.  3.5/5  12)Your Love- A great job done on this song.  Actually the original version of this song was created years back in her mixtape days, but it was leaked and eventually charted.  Does a great job on this song 5/5  13)Last Change ft. Natasha Bedingfield- To me, it feels like the introduction, I'm the Best.  It is a good song, with a mixture of pop and rap elements, but to me, just is not the strongest track.  4/5  Now, this is the end of the standard edition.  But with this album, you HAVE to get the deluxe edition.  14)Super Bass- Her biggest hit, and one of my personal favorites.  I still ponder why a great song like this would be on the deluxe edition!  Bubbly pop song, but still has some classic Nicki rap interfused as well. 5/5  15)Blow Ya Mind- Another classic hip-hop hit.  In this song, we see some hardcore Nicki return for one last fiery track.  Vulgarity at its best! Awesome beat and hilarious lyrics! 5/5  16)Muny- I was rather disappointed with this track. Out of all the songs of the album, this track truly disappointed me and actually came off as annoying. Not horrible, but my least favorite 2.5/5  Overall, I think this album has a little something for everyone.  I think this album is one of my favorites.  I thoroughly enjoy her rap on the album, which is one of the main reasons I bought it, but was allured into the rest of the songs and I am craving more.  Her next album, I hope she keeps a slew of songs, ranging from fast to slow and rap to pop as in this one, because she executes each genre wonderfully.
B002BWP49M|5.0|I LOVE Amazon, but this time, I really don't!! I pre-ordered this sucker, thinking that I would be getting a better price and/or getting it before everyone else in the stores...so why am I still sitting here, BD-less, and for TWO more freaking days??? My friends all have it, bought theirs today at Target or something, and here I sit, thinking I was smart by pre-ordering, and yet the joke's on me, I guess. I even tried cancelling it this morning so I could just throw it in the cart as I trolled through Costco this morning, but no..they had already \\"processed it for shipment\\" and couldn't stop the order at that point. Poop...so damn bummed. I should have been watching it 4x by now...

He faces many challenges in his way and in Alaska. Truly a must read! Great story great values. Amazing story
0525478817|5.0|I was literally speechless when I finished this book. I thought for a while about what I might say in a review, because I was so incredibly moved by this story.  If you are considering reading this book, don't be afraid of it. I was. I thought for a few days before I downloaded. I was leery of reading a book about kids with terminal cancer. I'm so glad I didn't let my fear keep me from reading this book.  You see, this book is not so much about dying as it is about LIVING. So many passages moved me... Gus referring to cancer as a \\"civil war\\" with predetermined winner... Hazel saying she'd trade all the sick days she had left for a few healthy ones... and so many others made me really stop and think about how a cancer patient truly looks at life.  This book broke my heart, but in a beautiful way.  I'm so so glad I read it.  5 VERY ENTHUSIASTIC stars.
B005Y4241K|5.0|I received the Adele DVD/CD Edited Version 2-11-12. ONE DAY BEFORE THE GRAMMY AWARDS. I have watched the DVD twice today and will listen to the CD at bedtime. ALL and MORE than one could ask for from an artist. She shows her emotions when she is moved to do so, interacts with audience, tells how she came to write the songs, and on top of all of that she is such a \\"cut-up\\". IF this music doesn't make you FEEL emotions to your toes you should find the nearest morgue and check yourself in. ABSOLUTELY THE BEST WAY TO SELL A PRODUCT - I can choose to watch and listen or to just listen. I'll take Adele any way that I can hear the music.

B004LWZW42|1.0|I was soooooo exited and hopeful about this film:  It takes young Charles Xavier, champion of peaceful coexistence between humans and mutants, his like-minded human partner Moira MacTaggart, and his anti-human nemesis Magneto, and purports to tell the story of how they all met and banded together in order to found the X-Men and save the world for the first time.  Of course this premise diverges from the comics I read quite a bit, but I thought it was an extremely good idea, fraught with potential for great character development, interpersonal drama, and moral conflict.  Likewise, the inclusion of Raven (aka Mystique) as Xavier's devoted friend and foster-sister is as far as one can get from a faithful version of her character.  But taking this \\"Raven\\" as an original character on her own terms, I thought (when watching the early part of the film) that she worked extremely well.  I was looking forward to what the film would do with these four characters when they got together.  Well.  Words cannot express my disgust and disappointment, but I'll give it a try.  < SPOILERS >  In the comics I read, Dr. Moira MacTaggart was a Scottish scientist, Xavier's closest friend and conscience, the co-founder of the X-Men, and the most significant \\"human\\" character.  This movie re-imagines her as an American CIA flunky who starts out performing undercover missions in her underwear, then hangs out with Charles and Company like a casually-adopted and mostly-ignored pet.  She has no romance with Charles, no relationship of any kind with Magneto, no scenes where she has any meaningful conversation with either one of them.  She expresses no opinions on human/mutant issues, has no personal relationships with the younger mutants, and generally fails to give any sense of Moira's personality, or any personality at all.  Does she have any difficulty trusting Xavier, who can read and alter minds and makes it clear to her almost immediately that he isn't all that morally scrupulous about it?Does it bug her that Magneto is a vengeance-crazed psychopath?  Does she KNOW Magneto's a vengeance-crazed psychopath?  Does Xavier feel caught between them in any way?  Hello?  Movie???  Well, that's it for Chuck's tragic love affair.  What about his doomed friendship with Magneto?  Well apparently it lasted all of two weeks, and was completely one-sided.  This version of Magneto never displays any of the \\"good\\" Charles delusionally claims to see in him.  He finds out that mutants exist for the first time, and pretty much instantly decides to use them as his lame-ass excuse for bigotry and slaughter.  No intervening years where he tries to protect and care for young mutants in a sincere way.  No attempt to co-exist with Common Humanity, to show that maybe Genocidal Psychopathology isn't the first and only lifestyle choice he's willing to even consider.  No attempt whatsoever to struggle with his own inner darkness!  He just takes advantage of Charles's friendship and help for his own purposes, and never seems to even consider doing anything decent in return.  What he DOES do is mentally torture Charles in a very cold-blooded and deliberate way, cripple him in an accidental and totally stupid way, abandon him dying on a beach in the care of the CIA flunky who isn't even a doctor in this version, AND take creepy and loveless sexual advantage of his sister  -- all while feeling terribly sorry for himself.  Yet the film portrays Magneto in a fawning fanboy manner, clearly regarding his self-pity, treachery and sadism as \\"kewl\\" and \\"bad@ss\\".  This adulation of power and brutality results in Magneto using up a lot of screen time doing the same things over and over again, not because they make sense to the plot, but because certain minds behind this film are getting off on it:  Sadistic torture of Swiss Banker; Sadistic torture and murder of German war criminals -- and their bartender; Sadistic torture of half-naked woman tied to bed.  All cold-blooded, premeditated and deliberate acts -- during which Magneto obviously is in complete control of himself and his powers.  But other scenes -- doubtless remnants of some earlier version of the script that actually made sense -- suggest that Magneto can't use his powers at all unless he is consumed by blind rage.  Hence the need for Charles to teach him control so that he won't committ any more mad atrocities -- which in that context would certainly make sense.  But since Magneto can already control himself fine, what Charles is actually doing is giving him more power to abuse, which is morally indefensible and contemptibly stupid.  Another script incongruity is that Charles acts as though Magneto's murder of Shaw would cross some terrible line!  But Magneto has crossed the Cold-Blooded Murder Line several times over by the time Charles first reads his mind.  So why should the murder of Shaw be such a big deal, when the murder of that bartender apparently doesn't matter one bit?  The characterization of Raven is similarly incoherent.  She is portrayed as a decent person with a smile like sunlight who is deeply fond of Charles, horrified by Shaw's brutality to the point of tearful hysterics, yet courageously determined to save her fellow-mutants from Shaw's corruption.  But when Magneto embraces Shaw's Mutant-Nazi ideology at the end of the film, she is in such a rush to become his lickspittle and sex-toy that she cannot even be bothered to take her horribly injured brother to the hospital first.  And Charles naturally gives his blessing to her new genocidal-doormat lifestyle, where all of two weeks earlier he wouldn't even let her drink booze.  Then there are the blank spots in her characterization:  An early exchange tells us that Raven is a waitress, not a student.  Why?  Because she is too proud to let Charles support her?  Because she prefers tagging after him at Oxford to getting an education?  Or because he wants to keep her with him at Oxford rather than letting her attend school elsewhere?  The reason would normally be terribly important to understanding where Raven was coming from, but since they flush her whole personality down the toilet at the end of the film anyway, I guess it's not.  As for Charles himself, we learn very little about him, and what we do learn doesn't add up to an actual character, much less a hero.  He starts out as a womanizing jerk with no emotional relationships other than Raven.  He has no worldly experience (that they care to tell us about), but is the author of a creepy thesis about how common humans are destined to extinction before the \\"superior\\" mutant breed.  This would all have worked FINE as a prelude to his relationship with Moira, but that didn't happen.  And that's a problem. The fangirl in me hates to say it, but what's important about Moira isn't her accent or her job.  What's important is that her relationship with Charles -- their mutual respect, equality, emotional attachment, and shared commitment to helping young mutants for the sake of all mankind -- is the living embodiment of Xavier's principles, and the essential counterpoint to Magneto's ideology.  Without this relationship -- and without any meaningful relationships with his students -- the rather unpleasant and sketchy Charles Xavier we are introduced to is not allowed to solidify as a character.  His commitment to humanity and non-evilness is just words.  Words which mean nothing next to his \\"Homo Superior\\" thesis, his telepathic abuse of Moira and her colleague, his assent to Raven's corruption, his indifference to the murder of that bartender, his criminal gift of massive power to an obvious psychopath, and his constant doe-eyed gazes at Magneto which seem to say \\"Poooooor Erik: Yes it really IS all about you\\".  Instead of Charles being Magneto's friend-turned-archnemesis, he is only his pathetic dupe turned rejected fanboy.  This sucks more than I can possibly tell you.  But I've tried.

B0055SWM08|3.0|the game has a cool premise and it's fun to play, but its kind of easy. I guess was expecting more of a challenge.
B005SFS4ZU|5.0|This Blu Ray is simply a must own if you enjoy any type of theater. Ramin as Phantom is breathtaking in his portrayal and the same can be said for Sierra as Christine. There is absolutely nothing wrong with this performance and that is why it is appropriate that you can have it playing in the background 24/7. If you don't get the DVD, the cd will suffice (I am swapping out the OLC for this one). A+
B0051QIGP4|5.0|or should I say, i didn't like lady gaga very much till i got this cd.  it's awesome!  I love nearly every song on it.  they're all very unique and very catchy.  Good stuff!!!!!!!!
B004O4K4SQ|2.0|good game but has bad glitches. it has missing words,credits and sometimes has lines moving through the screen it really stinks.
B002GYI9C4|3.0|I have very mixed feelings and am having trouble writing this review.  If I had to keep it really short, I would say, great story line, truely unique magic system.  However, slowly developed and repetitive, I ended up skipping many page. Good closure to this novel, didn't really leave you hanging.  I was not really happy with the price.  I will not be reading the next novel, mostly due to the reviews.  For a little more detail, no real spoilers:  I am female, 50 years old, Kindle version, no issues with editing for me. I really enjoyed the concept of the entire story-- the theives that actually are trying to save the world, for me this was a fresh twist; the ash constantly falling, the mist, the monsters in the mist, the things with spikes in their eyes, it was pretty creative. The magic is what I found so refreshing, I have read a great deal of these types of books, this is probably the coolest magic idea yet.  But, while I loved the magic, the detailed explanation or scenes detailing when the magic was being used, was just too repetitive, after the first few scenes, I just started skipping the details when someone was performing the magic and skipped straight to the conclusion of the magic scene.  I felt that the characters, expcept for Vin, could have had more character development. The dialog between the characters was mostly simplistic and repetitive. Some of the murder scenes were way to graphic for me - but I am a female, so maybe that is to be expected.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|this is an okay game for those who need to pass time. I enjoy this game. it is cool. you should get this game.

1589946006|4.0|I ordered one pack of these to open up and use for silly purposes. I have one of the larger Cthulhus taped to the top of my monitor at work; I gave another of the large ones to a friend. I decided to order a second pack because a) these are getting hard to find, and b) I thought an unopened package of them might be worth some money someday. Trouble is, both packs I received had been ripped open and taped shut before they were shipped to me. The latest pack I got, the one I wanted to keep in immaculate condition, is held together in four places with 3-inch to 5-inch strips of tape. Even at that, holes bulge open in the plastic bag. Kind of looks like a little kid ripped open a Christmas present and tried to rewrap it in the hopes that his parents wouldn't notice. From a collector's point of view, these are worthless. And that's really annoying.

B000A0GYD2|5.0|This DVD series is an amazing accomplishment, as were the six successful moon landings it describes. It explores the Apollo program from many aspects. These include the personalities of the astronauts, their wives, the news media, and the scientist who supported the project.  I am proud to have been one (out of 400,000 people) who worked on Apollo. My job was to make sure that the microwave transmitter (designed by RCA) used on the Lunar Excursion Module met the requirements of the landing radar.  On the Viking program, which successfully landed on Mars, I designed the transmitter myself. My own stuff is still sitting on Mars!  During recent debates between candidates for the GOP Presidential nomination, Mitt Romney laughed about Newt Gingrich's proposal to build a colony on the moon. I can understand the general public's loss of interest about space exploration and their concern about the cost this work. I expect someone running for President to have more perspective about the long term benefits of this effort.  DARPA and NASA are working together to deal with the practical issues involved in exploring space. A manned colony on the moon is a key part of this project.  The story about Apollo is beautiful, but the public's lack of interest in future work on the moon is sad.
B0000025F7|5.0|Michael Jackson does something amazing with beats and this album was my first exposure to him.  It is just amazing.  The sounds are delicious and they will kick up your mood and get your body moving no fail.  A great artist and one of his best albums--out of the ones I've listened to at least.
B004LROUW2|3.0|I have read most of Murakami's earlier works several years ago. I was thrilled to see a new novel come out and receive a lot of attention. It is a great and compelling story. BUT - what's up with the three volumes for a relatively simple story that in my view did not command so many pages. Good story, interesting plot, but overly long in execution.
1451627289|5.0|I cannot say enough about this book....it's absolutely enthralling.  I've been a King fan since I first picked up 'Salem's Lot' back in 1976.  Granted, there have been ups and downs with his books, but this one is certainly a keeper.  I was hoping he wouldn't throw in some ghoulish ending which makes no sense (as he did with Duma Key), and I am happy to report that the ending couldn't be better.  He did a great job with this and I urge anyone to read it.  Don't let the large amount of pages scare you....if you're like me, you will find yourself up to all hours of the morning reading chapter after chapter.
B0043D2D64|4.0|Archangel is a captivating story, featuring a UK sovietologist, a US journalist and a number of Russian characters involved in some way with the search for Stalin's lost diary. The story is a well-plotted and the book a page-turner, however I liked it also for the more general comment it makes about how Stalin is perceived in the history compared to e.g. Hitler. One of the men is still quite popular in his home country, which is a scary thought (and I think unfortunately true still today). As such the thriller becomes a commentary of 20th century history and, just, a little more than a weekend thriller. Recommended.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Last book I read by Stephen King was The Tommy Knockers and I couldn't finish it - which is a rarity for me. I've probably never finished about 5 books..ever. Hated that book. It seemed like his books were becoming too formulaic and 'out there' for my tastes many years ago and I shelved all my Stephen King books for awhile. A month ago in Walmart I saw this book on a shelf. I read the back of it and being a big fan of Time Travel decided to give Stephen King a chance again. I came home and ordered it from Amazon and I was NOT disappointed. I even had a tear in my eye at the end.  One of the most likable main characters I've come across in a long time. This book was 100% engaging and really explores a time when we all do ask \\"What if?\\"  I would highly recommend this book to fans of many different genres. You don't have to be a sci fi fan to appreciate this character and this story of an alternate American History had Kennedy lived. I can see why this book got so many great reviews - it truly deserves it. Yes its a long book but dont let that deter you. This book flows very nicely and you'll be sad when it finally does come to an end because its such an enjoyable read.

B004QOB8SO|5.0|ADDED IN JULY:  If you watched \\"Sherlock\\" on PBS, you have not seen all of it.  In order to make room for some of their own material, PBS had something like 8 minutes cut from each episode (including some entire scenes).  The DVDs have the intact episodes.  Near as I can tell, the Region 1 and Region 2 DVDs are identical (except for the PBS or BBC logo that plays when the disc first loads), so if you have a Region 1 player, by all means get the Region 1 DVD (this product!), now that it's actually available.<br /><br />MY ORIGINAL COMMENTS FROM FEBRUARY:  The British (region 2) DVD is already available on Amazon UK (just scroll to the bottom of this or any page, to the line of countries under the Amazon logo, and click on \\"United Kingdom\\").  You will need a region 2 or region-free DVD player.  (Hint: The DVD players on many laptops are region-free.)<br /><br />The British DVD has subtitles, commentaries for the first two episodes, and a featurette.<br /><br />Often the second year of a popular series will rest on its laurels, but that is most emphatically NOT the case with \\"Sherlock.\\"  If anything, season 2 is even better than season 1, and the ending leaves me more than ready for season 3!  (Yes, there will be a season 3 -- the BBC has already authorized it.)
B0036EH3U2|5.0|I was 13 when the miniseries first aired. I watched it, got bored, and never continued past that. Now, at the ripe old age of 21, I decided to try it out again and found it to be the most intense, thrilling, and enjoyable television experience I've ever had. This is science fiction for adults - no black and white morality, no good guys or bad guys, no easy, comfortable lessons. It's raw, gritty, character-driven story telling for grown-ups. And it's frakking fantastic.<br /><br />I blew through the entire series on Netflix in about two and a half weeks over winter break. After two weeks of withdrawal, I went out and purchased a Blu-Ray drive and this series, which I'm now in the process of re-watching. I've never re-watched anything so soon, and I'm planning to watch it a third time with commentary right after. My only complaint about this set is that, like others have said, the extended editions are on different discs. I don't quite get why they just didn't include the extended episodes as the default. Additionally, the video quality is good, though the grainy effect can be quite jarring in some places. Of course, this isn't anything to do with the Blu-Ray, but it's more noticeable in full HD than it was on Netflix.
B000BMSTMS|5.0|After the frustration and anger due to struggling with the upcoming departure of their lead guitarist that we heard on \\"Take A Look in the Mirror\\", on this album Korn takes a drastic change of sound this time around. The music incorporates their signature sound but also blends industrial rock, electronic music, and even synth backing that is reminiscent of the Cure. This experimental approach could've backfired but it ultimately helped the band's sound to become even more refined and showed that they were excellent musicians/songwriters regardless of what genre they chose.<br /><br />1. Twisted Transistor- 4/5<br />2. Politics- 5/5<br />3. Hypocrites- 5/5<br />4. Souvenir- 5/5<br />5. Ten or a Two-Way- 5/5<br />6. Throw Me Away- 5/5<br />7. Love Song- 5/5<br />8. Open Up- 5/5<br />9. Coming Undone- 5/5<br />10. Getting Off- 4/5<br />11. Liar- 5/5<br />12. For No One- 4/5<br />13. I've Seen It All- 5/5<br />14. Tearjerker- 5/5<br /><br />This a great album and if you like Korn, metal, or even industrial than you should give it a try (or at least listen to some of the songs I ranked high).<br /><br />For Korn fans that miss their old sound, I'm glad they've continued to progress over the years because I don't want the band to put out the same albums constantly. Especially when this band is capable of so much more than just heavy metal riffs and screaming (which don't get me wrong, I like that about Korn and other metal bands). Everyone should try and keep an open mind and recognize good music when they hear it.
B001AQTWF2|4.0|After the disappointing commercial performance of [[ASIN:B0026MOVOG Just Whitney]] I kind of thought Whitney Houston's career was over and she would fade into nothingness and/or the life of a reclusive showbiz junkie. All of a sudden in 2009 Whitney re-emmerged with a brand new album,still on Arista and produced by the same man who had made her blockbuster first album [[ASIN:B000002VCQ Whitney Houston]] so famous-Clive Davis. As self caressing as he seems to be,Clive has no trouble getting the hits even in elderhood. And it's clear that Whitney is at the end of her line. Despite her somewhat queenly pose on the front cover,she looks feeble and unwell. It's a very sad portrait to view. I went in based on the cover art thinking in  fact I'd be hearing some modern variation on Billie Holiday's [[ASIN:B003W77TYI Lady in Satin]]. That luckily is not the case. Something more interesting happened.<br /><br />  Now to be told,this album tries a lot harder to get a hit than the previous release. And the results are a number of cliched contempo R&B blunders unworthy of her vocal talents. But I have to face it-she did the same thing on her 1985 debut as well. Somehow or other,she always made her uneveness into a strange bedfellow as it were. This album starts out with the sophisticated,rousing Philly dance/soul of \\"Million Dollar Bill\\",with instrumentation and production easily worthy of a Teddy Pendergrass around 1979. That retro 70's flavor is not maintained the rest of the album however. However it is followed by by well arranged modern dance/soul of \\"Nothin' But Love\\",in which Whitney offers forgiving shout outs to even her haters. Not usually much on the guest star clishe but \\"Like I Never Left\\" has a decent groove even if it did have the ubiquitous Akon. The last four tunes from \\"I Didn't Know My Own Strength\\" through \\"Salute\\" are where the generic hit making attempts are made-some of the weaker numbers here. Although grafting a highly generic electropop disco beat to Leon Russell's \\"A Song For You\\" has a certain witty touch I think.<br /><br />  In the end this ammounts to an attempted but flawed comeback that will of course likely go unrealized now. Even if there's no decent backlog of posthumous material this album,despite it's many flaws wouldn't actually be too bad a way for Whitney to go out. The songwriting and arrangements are usually very strong. Some of the electropop synthesizers and occasional \\"ho ho-ho ho\\" chants get tired after awhile but....hey,this is Whitney Houston. Her music was largely sold on the basis of her vocal talent and star presense rather than instrumentation. She was sort of the beginning of a trend in R&B away from vocalists towards blockbuster singers,and there IS a difference. Whitney is a fine vocalist too. But she often lets the melodramtic singer side of her take center stage to gain recognition she already had. In the end,both personally and creatively it seems to be a battle she couldn't win with herself. But when she hit on the right musical button,and she does that quite a lot here,the listener is really in for a treat.'s \\"A Song For You\\" has a certain witty touch I think.

B003G4W49C|4.0|Ender's Game is an essential read for any fiction fan, whether you are into sci-fi or not.  I was forced to give it a 4/5 because of the strange, unthreaded piece at the end.  In fact, this book could have ended several times before that, without consequence to the preceding pages.  Nonetheless, an excellent read.  Wonderful.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|I bought this bag for two reasons: 1) It was reasonably priced. 2) I feel better knowing it's not an obvious camera bag. If I bought a Lowpro, Kata, or any of the other easily identifiable expensive bags I would probably be jacked. For those reasons it's perfect for me. It does have it's flaws though and the biggest one is that it's small. Right now it has more than enough space for my digital camera, camcorder, DSLR, 2 Lenses, and various camera accessories. But I'm not really talking about small in space I'm talking about small in size. I feel awkward wearing it since my normal backpack is bigger. Another issue is that the zipper handle thingies (totally what they are called) keep coming off. Though this issue could be my fault.
B001C4CI8U|5.0|I love this TV Series, it is awesome, so mind stimulating and makes you as the audience think outside the box of reality that we know to other realities that may well exist or be possible.  Fringe is great and Anna Torv and Joshua Jackson make an amazing team :)

B000NA1OXY|3.0|She's done it again, Avril has now strayed away from her previous songwriting style and has once again headed in a direction for her sound. Avril also ditches the brunette locks for bright blonde hair to reflect the bright bubblegum pop of her third album \\"The Best Damn Thing\\". Now these changes right here are enough to alienate Avril's core rock-n-roll audience, but seeing as how \\"The Best Damn Thing\\" is her first new album in 3 years from her last release, it was still worth it to at least give the new found Avril a chance. But unfortunately, in the process of lightening the mood and infusing more pop and peppy colors to this song set, Avril has made quite a few big mistakes. The first was becoming what Avril seemed to despise, a bouncing blonde who's preppy nature makes her come across snobbish rather than personable. The second was giving up her mature sound from her last two albums and replacing it with brighter pop, which makes Avril become another pop-machine rather than a singer/songwriter who's always defined herself by originality and unwillingness to follow the pack. And lastly, her third mistake was releasing an album with a misguided attempt to make her seem like she's not all doom and gloom, but that sound is what made her a star in the first place. \\"The Best Damn Thing\\" will definitely gain some new fans for Avril, but at the same time those who have followed her up to this point will feel cheated and they will most likely find another outlet for their frustrations. However, Avril shines on occasion with her oh-so-infectious \\"Girlfriend\\", her power ballad \\"Innocence\\", and the Eragon sountracking hit \\"Keep Holding On\\", which is by far the best song on this sweet, but trying album.
B0055SWM08|5.0|First single-player game played on a screen that has ever sucked me in.<br /><br />Have enjoyed a brief Quell session 40 days straight.  It is more a gentle intellectual opiate than a stimulant, even as it stimulates the brain to consider the landscape of the game various moves into the future.  If you like the tonality of prayer bowls,  you will probably enjoy the sound.  The music is calming, not a bad thing for this reviewer who views his tablet primarily as a library door instead of an arcade entrance.

I have been able to download about 200 songs and videos and counting and its perfect. the only problem is that there is the same image on all the songs when you go to your wings on the kindle but not for your gallery
1612130283|5.0|Wow! I have really enjoyed this and the other 2 books. They each are similar yet so different. Its great to see the main characters growing and changing each other.  This book as opposed to the other two has more of the graphic bdsm scenes. if you are no open to that you wont like it. But the books arent about that so much as its about who the characters are on the inside. The book have substance, love, humor. It will make you laugh and sad esp the last two books.  Definitely plan on re-reading the books!

0812550757|4.0|This is not a continuation of \\"Ender's Game\\" as you might imagine a sequel. You might want to look into \\"Ender's Shadow\\" and \\"Shadow of the Giant\\" for that kind of writing.  Every scene in this book is deliberately intended to build the tension of an ultimate final decision of fate. In the end, you'll be trying to decide what you would do in the same circumstances. With this book, look deeper into your own belief of what you think is right or wrong. See an amazing analysis of how humans justify xenocide or other atrocities. Gain insight through the metaphor of human injustices here on Earth and through understanding just what a \\"speaker for the dead\\" is. And all that, with a very entertaining plot!
B0071QIN00|5.0|this app the bomb but they need to take the most annoying sounds away from this app and if that put more stars on it than my rating would of went up all the way up
0385534639|4.0|With over 750 reviews posted already, there's not much new that I can say.  But I scanned 100 or so reviews and did not notice anyone pointing out what sticks out so strongly in my mind.  Reading this book is like reading an Edward Gorey drawing.  Someone is describing something to you that is black and white, mysterious, spooky.  If you love the art of Edward Gorey, then you'll be in heaven reading The Night Circus.  The characters have a few witty lines here and there, which you can just imagine would be the short captions under an Edward Gorey drawing.  It is true there isn't much more than that.  No real plot or complex characters.  But an absolutely beautiful read nonetheless.  If you really really like Edward Gorey.

B002RKRTGO|1.0|I've seen this in several of Kindle's Free Editions, all excerpts are missing!  All the poems in Alice in Wonderland as well as Through the Looking Glass and now the manuscript in Baskervilles.<br /><br />Either the free editions are poorly edited before release (if indeed they are proofread at all) or (more likely) Amazon is releasing an incomplete product for free in order to force us to buy one of their fancy versions.  I might understand if this were an author who is still around, but with the classics I think this is unacceptable.
B005K2KCPG|2.0|I have listened to this album from front to back on Spotify at least 5 times.  I just can't get into it.  The first track starts out very uninspired and it only gets worse from there.  Sammy's obsession with sexually suggestive lyrics gets old.  I was cool with it when he was in Van Halen and I was in my early 20's.  Now I'm near 40 and it's lame.  This is very generic rock.  Pales in comparison to the new Van Halen album.  I even have a chance to buy this right now on Amazon for $2.99 (with credits) and I can't bring myself to do it. Sorry, Chickenfoot....PLEASE try harder!!!!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|this app has everything that you would need and is a great tool with the audio abilities to it. i would recommend to others.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|it is so entertaining i love love love love love love love love love love love love love love it soooooooo much
B005SFR7YE|5.0|I want to start off by saying that i don't think its fair to compare theatre with movies because theatre is theatre & movies are movies. I for one enjoyed the movie. Now back to the review.  Dark, gothic, haunting, murder, romance. I love this story. In this adaption, they changed some (minor) lyrics & a few other nitpicky changes. It does not however change the experience. I for one really liked that they humanized The Phantom. You could feel his heartbreak & pain. I for one am not usually a crier. But let me tell you, I had tears running down my face by the end of this performance. Ramin Karimloo was pitch perfect as The Phantom. Possibly the top two Phantoms I've seen.  There were times where I felt that The Phantom could have been more menacing & threatening. However, it got me thinking that is The Phantom truly evil or is he the victim of circumstance, who's just misunderstood. Is he all good? No. But he's not all bad either. Sierra Boggess's Christine was shining as well. You could see Christine's internal dialogue within herself near the end. Her love for both men is visible. Hadley Fraser's portrayal of Raoul was interesting. While he has a good voice, the character came off as kind of a bump on a log. Not much personality during the first viewing. However, near the end, the emotion & pain  in his eyes was incredible. Do I wish they kept the \\"signature opening scene\\" in? Absolutely. Do I miss the classic props rising up through the floor & the classic magic mirror? You bet. Does it affect the thrill, excitement,enchanting, mesmerizing & bewitching theatre experience at an affordable price? Not in the least.
B0071QIN00|5.0|this game is so cool it is fun and challenging some levels are really hard and this is the most addicting game ever
B004FOA84A|3.0|I purchased this for my Kindle Fire because I really enjoyed playing The Lost City, but this was a disappointment.  Although graphics quality is excellent, this is really, REALLY too short.  It took me maybe an hour to complete it. Also the last puzzle was really finicky (blue circles on basement door) and the lightest touch will cause it to reset so that even if you've solved it once, you're forced to do so again (and again). Also, the ending was lame - a real anticlimax.  It was also pretty easy, but I don't mind this if there are a lot of visually interesting scenes or landscapes.  In this game the graphics were nice but again there were only around ten different settings.
B002LII6KA|5.0|I bought this expecting to get all 3 of the movies plus the Animatrix, but I got a whole lot more.  This thing is jam packed with so many cool extra features. I love it, and have still not come close to viewing everything on the 10 disc set.  Great art work stamped on the discs.  Nice packaging.  Be careful sliding the booklet into the case though, because it snags on the corners and can damage it.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Great for occupying your mind, but not too complex.   I especially like the option to deal a winning hand or random hand.
B000002UHG|5.0|I used to be a huge Pink Floyd fan.  My very favorite Floyd album, by far, had always been (and still is) Wish You Were Here.  OK, I'm a keyboard player so of course the keyboard heavy works had to be my favorite.  Simply put, I always thought of Pink Floyd through the sound of Richard Wright.  Even though I have always been a Rick Wright fan this is the first time I have ever listened to one of his solo albums.<br /><br />A lot of the time this sounds a lot like Pink Floyd, more so than A Final Cut (not Floyd but a Water's solo album) or even A Momentary Lapse of Reason (not Floyd but a Gilmore solo album).  Sometimes it sounds too much like Floyd - the guitar parts often sound like they are channeling Gilmore.<br /><br />For the most part, though, I think it is pure Wright.  If it sounds like Floyd it is because his sound was what, to my ears, made Floyd.  Even their early sound was created much more by his keyboard work than Barret's or Gilmore's guitar.  I can hear echoes (no pun intended) of earlier Floyd music on this album, but nothing is obviously lifted from an earlier work - everything here is new.<br /><br />One small problem for me - Wright's voice works well a lot of the time but I wished he had chosen to have more guest vocalists.  The two times he used Sinead O'Connor really, to my ears, make this stand out more - it was a nice break.  Not a huge deal and the more I listen the more his voice grows on me.  Still, if only Sinead were used on one or two more songs...<br /><br />Unfortunately we will not hear any more new Richard Wright - he is playing \\"The Great Gig in the Sky\\".  Such a huge loss to the music world...  But he did leave a lot of wonderful music, including Broken China, an album that any Richard Wright fan, or Pink Floyd fan for that matter, should listen to.
B006UG90RM|2.0|This will be painful to do, but it has to be done.  To say the new VH album is a slight disappointment would be overly generous.  It's been 28 years since a full album with Roth. 14 years since any new full length material at all.  You'd think with that amount of time, we could have at least gotten 5-6 solid tracks.  In all honesty, the brief Roth reunion in 1996, which yielded two new tracks for a then Best of set, \\"Can't Get This Stuff No More\\" & \\"Me Wise Magic\\"...  Those two tracks would be the best two tracks on this new set ADKOT.  The 3 new Hagar tracks on the 2004 Best of set were better too.  I hear nothing inspiring or original on this new set.  Tattoo was kind of goofy at first but grows on you a bit.  Stay Frosty sounds like Ice Cream Man Part II, but stands out a little because it's different from the rest of the album, which is bland as all get out.  Just white noise.  Nothing sticks out at all.  I've tried to listen to it 5 times through now.  I'm getting zero reading.  I think part of what has led to the demise, is that VH still lets their hate for Sammy Hagar and Michael Anthony get in the way of making good music.  They completely ignore the 15-20 Hagar years.  Both in concert, and as it seems, in their musical growth.  That's a huge successful chunk to just toss away.  And,  this album, really, sounds like Wolfie had way too much say in it.  Sure, he's great on bass.  But a lot of this album sounds like a first time out gig but with polish.  I still have tickets for the opening night gig in Louisville.  I'm sure it will be good.  The first 6 Roth albums will always be classics and have more than enough material for a show.  I've seen them with Wolfie.  His playing does not take anything away.  And sure, they'll ignore the Hagar years.  Can still live with that.  Truth is though, when it comes to new studio material, save yourself the money on this set, and go pick up the new Chickenfoot III CD with Sammy and Michael Anthony.  They are putting out some great solid fresh energetic material.  Sadly, the same cannot be said about ADKOT.  Two Stars just because it's Van Halen.  But an extremely lackluster performance after such a long wait.

0060873027|3.0|I read this book because I like Michael Crichton and heard that this was the final book he wrote before he died.  Which is true and it was unfinished.  His wife sent the book to a friend who finished it.  I don't know how much was Crichton and how much was written by Preston.  I enjoyed it for what it was.  However, this has been done before numerous times and better.  Part Fantastic Voyage, part Mysterious Island, part Voyage to the Center of the Earth...ad nauseum.  It's not an original book in any way.  It's not boring or even dull, just not original in any way.  Someone said that it's good airplane reading.  It is.  It's exciting and its fun.  Just don't expect anything new here.

B005SFR7YE|5.0|I started listening to Phantom back in 1988.  It was my first experience with musicals and fell in love.  I listened to the CD's for years beforey seeing it performed on tour.  I've seen it three times and thought when the movie came out it would be the cherry on top of all my experiences with Phantom.  I WAS WRONG.  This performance is by far the best thing to happen to this wonderful piece.  This is not just a viewing of the performance but an experience that was jaw dropping.  No spoilers but the show does not end when Meg retrieves the mask!  I cannot recommend this highly enough.  If there were 6 stars or a 100, I would think it worthy of them all.
B0058VW36U|5.0|this game is a really fun game that keeps you occupied.but it desperately needs updates. just got 3 stars on all levels

0062112430|5.0|I added this book to my shopping cart on Amazon about 2 months ago. Then, I started reading the reviews on it. I was shocked to find so many negative reviews. I immediately removed the book from my cart and that was that. Well, this weekend was going to be the coldest weekend of the winter so far, so I knew I wouldn't be going outside. I had my boyfriend take me to Wal-Mart to grab a few books for my long weekend inside. Despite all the negative reviews, I ended up picking up Delirium. And boy, am I glad I did. The book is so believable. While reading, I tried placing myself inside this story, measuring all the symptoms of \\"deliria\\" to my own relationship, and Lauren Oliver hit it out of the park. I could definitely see a world where love is outlawed, that's the kind of society we live in. I could not put this book down, and I was so disappointed when it ended. Yes, there are a few grammatical errors, but I've seen worse in books. We are human, after all. I most definitely recommend this book, and I have already pre-ordered Pandemonium. :)
B002NWRMVS|1.0|This a horrible CD in every way. It's a complete sell-out to cross-over. The Fall is a most appropriate name for this aberration. People who complain about the mastering are quite right. But what's worse, the album or the mastering? Gladly, I'll not have to suffer the horrible sound again, I've tossed the CD in the garbage. That's where it belongs.

0143116177|4.0|The title of the book infers a positive connotation to the development of money. I think the majority of people would agree that we are better off than those of Mesopotamia.  This ascent, however, follows a saw-tooth pattern of gains and losses through time. Ferguson does a good job following these vicissitudes. I discovered the function of money studying economics in university, a unit of exchange.  When a country has problems maintaining confidence in their currency, any benefits that the evolution of money has developed moves backward because that belief diminishes.<br /><br />There is a lot of discussion on the purpose of this book: is it a history of money, does it fulfill an agenda of the author, does it describe the financial difficulties of our current economic condition, does it do all of these? I'll look at how this book fulfills all of these.<br /><br />Firstly, Ferguson provides us with a history of money by taking us from tablets used five thousand years ago in Mesopotamia to the earliest known coins from 600 BC found by archaeologists in the Temple of Artemis at Ephesus, to the Medicis of Italy, the Rothschilds, John Law , the American civil war, the World Wars, and to the housing bubble of the latest decade. These different periods illustrate developments and the failures in the history of loans, banks, bonds, real estate, derivatives, Chimerica, and the financial community's efforts to attach biological terms to the financial world.<br /><br />Secondly, some have criticized Ferguson for only providing history that supports his political leanings. An argument could be made that this is a history of money and not politics although the two are highly intertwined and Ferguson does include politics in this history. I would think Ferguson tried to minimize the role of politics so criticisms of excluding Pinochet's human cost could be defended on these grounds.<br /><br />Thirdly, the history of money is filled with instances of the animal spirit or irrational exuberance of human thinking which explains the most recent recession.  From the Medicis to the Rothschilds, John Law to Ken Lay, over confidence soon gets the better of us and therefore does explain the cause of today's recession.<br /><br />So I think Ferguson did a good job overall in combining micro details that provide a tactile connection to significant developments in the history of money and still achieves a macro understanding of money. Looking at the ledgers of the Medicis or the tablets that were used for crops keeps you on your toes while explaining the developments of the first lenders for example.<br /><br />My favorite parts of this book include the Dutch United East India company's power in world trade, German monetary policy after WW I, the role of bonds in the US civil war, the Chilean experiment, and the modern day stock market, 12 fold increase over 20 years.<br /><br />My least favorite part is the explanation of today's problems being the result of printing money. From my reading of the situation, it was the rating agencies who enabled the selling of the CDO's and mortgage company's ability to escape liability in their lending practices. Not the printing of money.<br /><br />I'm looking forward to reading Ferguson's next book \\"Civilization\\".nal exuberance of human thinking which explains the most recent recession.

B006OAB3ME|3.0|I have only one issue with this CD and that is the singing. When Paul sings full-throat he sounds really good. When he sings in the high register -- which he does on at least half the songs -- his voice sounds strained and old. I'm sure Paul has a bit of an ego and maybe people around him are hestitant to provide honest opinions. I certainly wouldn't expect Diana Krall to say anything, after the album she produced for a hoarse/cracking sounding Barbra Streisand. By the way, I have everything ever recorded by Paul and Diana.  The song selection is really good -- for the most part they're songs not often covered. I really like both originals -- to me, the high points of the CD. I give the edge to Get Yourself Another Fool, only because the lyric is better.

0385535139|2.0|I have read many, many Grisham books in the past, I was disappointed with this one. I have two major complaints. The first was the plot. Usually his plots are second to none. They grab you and hold you until the very end. However, this book's plot was not overtly interesting. It seemed like there could be a few different directions it was going, and none of them all that interesting. There was really no suspense or anything. Just going through the motions. At no point did I feel like I couldn't wait to know what happens; just waiting for it to end so I can read something else.  The other complaint was the characters. There was basically zero character growth outside of the first 20 pages. They didn't grow or really change. And to add to that, there wasn't much of character development. I never really felt like I cared about them or I could even empathize. And, as I said, the plot wasn't good enough to even begin to compensate.  Quite a disappointment from one of my guilty pleasure authors.

B0034G4P4Y|3.0|Stephen Spielberg released The Adventures of Tintin nearly simultaneously with his other film, War Horse. The two are strike an interesting contrast with each other. Where War Horse plays the role of the classic Hollywood epic, Tintin serves as its hyperactive younger brother. Most in the Anglophone world are, at best, nominally familiar with the strangely coifed titular character, Tintin, but he's a pretty big deal among the Francophone part of the globe. My history with the character is modest, having only watched a short lived animated version on Nickelodeon when I was a kid. So I'm familiar with some of the characters, but I couldn't tell you how the movie stacks up to the source material. But the film itself is rather unruly, at times providing exciting action but also failing to tell a fully engaging story.  Tintin is a boy reporter (his age is somewhat ambiguous) who has a penchant for discovering vast plots that require quite a bit of globetrotting to uncover. The film opens with Tintin buying an old model ship, a replica of the lost galleon The Unicorn, at a flea market. He snatches it up mere moments before another buyer, Mr. Sakharine, arrives to pick up the ship. Tintin rebuffs any offer from Sakharine to purchase the MacGuffin, er, ship, from Tintin at a sizeable profit. Needless to say, the model ship is more than it first appears, and in fact it comprises part of a series of clues that lead to a long ago lost treasure. Sakharine doesn't take Tintin's refusal to sell kindly, ransacking the intrepid hero's apartment and eventually kidnapping him and storing him on a large steamship. The ship's captain, Captain Haddock, has been deposed by Sakharine and the mutinous crew. Tintin and Haddock team up to stop Sakharine and discover the secret behind the fate of the Unicorn and its treasure, a secret that has familial ties to Haddock himself, since it was his grandfather who captained the Unicorn before it became lost at sea.  Perhaps more so than Tintin himself, Haddock seems to be the fan favorite character. He's a bit of a drunken buffoon, and while I would imagine he wouldn't be the ideal partner for world wide adventuring, he's great fun to watch. Tintin was filmed using motion capture techniques, similar to the ones used in those Robert Zemeckis films, Beowulf and The Polar Express. This isn't my favorite kind of animation because, as others have noted, the combination of animated characters and eerily realistic movement tends to produce an uncanny valley effect. However, this technique does allow Andy Serkis to put in an enjoyably cartoonish performance in the role of Haddock. Serkis has become the go to man for motion capture performances--he's kind of a 21st century Lon Chaney--and his robust performance is a highlight of the film. He plays Haddock as a perpetually energetic man who has little control over his own drinking, downing bottles of liquor before he has a chance to even think about it. To his credit, Spielberg keeps all of the now risqué drunkard jokes, refusing to pander to his audience. And while Haddock's alcoholism is often played for laughs, he's also chastised once or twice by Tintin, even if he never gives up the drink.  Much of the film is an excuse for Spielberg to deliver one fantastic action piece after another without regard to pesky things like the laws of physics. There are some fantastic moments, including a battle between two ships during a raging storm and a crash landing in the desert. But perhaps the most thrilling part of the film is a chase through a Middle Eastern bizarre that takes place in a single, long shot. In these moments we see Spielberg eager to play with animation in ways that he can't in live action. Unfortunately, it's in the moments between the action that the movie seems unsure of itself. Like a jittery kid on a sugar rush, the movie can hardly sit still for a moment. The film is a series of action set pieces strung together with exposition as epoxy. This means that when the adventure should feel exciting, it sometimes feels exhausting. (I did see the movie in 3D, which may have only exacerbated this problem). This seems to be a problem that's worse in animated films. With the exception of Pixar, most animation studios feel the need to barrage the viewer with constant noise and unending movement, like they're shaking a pair of toy keys in front of a baby. Filmmakers need to let these films breath, to find a natural rhythm. Unfortunately, Tintin is no exception to this rule.  The director and film theorist, Sergei Eisenstein wrote extensively about the concept of dialectic, the synthesis of two seemingly opposing elements. We see this in plenty of Eisenstein's films and, strictly from the point of view of entertainment, the audience is wrenched from one emotional state to another. In his most famous film, Battleship Potemkin, Eisenstein precedes the massacre on the Odessa steps with images of celebration of the arrival of the rebellious crew of the Potemkin. The contrast between celebratory citizens and the gory images of innocents being gunned down makes the film that much more compelling. Likewise, an action film, at the very least, needs moments of calm in order to further elevate the moments of gunplay and fisticuffs. Spielberg has done wonders with this kind of contrast in other films. The famous caravan chase in Raiders of the Lost Ark, for example, comes after a grueling and atmospheric descent into the Well of Souls. It's only because we have followed Indiana Jones through a pit of snakes that we are now ready to release all that built up tension by watching him slug some Nazis. These days Spielberg almost always excels when it comes to laying out the action, but he would be well served to pay as much attention to the part of the film where bullets aren't whizzing by.

B0054JZC6E|4.0|great job. I really like the game! it was a creative artistic adventurous mind teasing hasty treat go my mind.
B00008A7QK|3.0|So overrated. He wasn't a great guitarist, singer or even much of a songwriter. Unless you think rewriting '50s doo-wop and standard blues tunes is some great achievement. And how come every song that could be considered a rock tune sounds like a Bang A Gong or Jeepster rewrite. Adding strings to R&R? Seems contradictory. Does he want to be a rocker or a pop star? There are some good songs, like Raw Ramp & Mambo Sun, but there's a sameness to almost everything here. It's not a bad album but I don't see what all the fuss was about. This was listed in Rolling Stone magazine as one of the top 100 albums of all time. Yeah, sure.
B001P9EQH8|3.0|Clearly this is modeled after the iPod Shuffle.  But the build quality is just not what I would expect.  It's not bad, mind you, but it just doesn't wow me like an iPod.  The clip spring is a little flimsy, and the audio jacks are on the wrong side if you think about it.  For clipping the device to my pocket, I would prefer the cords coming out of the pivot side, not the clip side.  Anyway for the money it gets the job done, and my headphones sound even better.
B0061QD82E|5.0|First of all, YES, it is in its original aspect ratio, 2:55:1, just like Sleeping Beauty was. Second this film is a must own for Disney or Animation fans, so if that's the case you can stop reading and buy this (or more likely you already have).  So the main reason I'm reviewing this item is I actually found something funny about the release and I had to point it out. You put the disc in the player, the nostalgia inducing Disney intro plays and the trailers begin. Then they say \\"stay tuned for EXCITING previews...\\", I don't think the next words should be \\"...including Beverly Hills Chihuahua 3\\", lol. Films like Cinderella, Aladdin, Pocahontas, Aristocats and The Rescuers all coming to blu-ray and they want to lead off with BHC? Okay, lol, other than that this is an experience the child in anyone will thoroughly enjoy.  Story: This is a great story, it's very simple but so well done. The characters are well crafted, the story progresses naturally and it's a story that hadn't been told from this point of view before, and I argue has never been told as well in this way since. It holds up amazingly even after 57 years, the period setting of an idyllic town in the early 20th century helps give it that ageless fairytale feeling that most Disney classics maintain. This is one of Disney's animated classics that you fondly remember but you appreciate it all the more when you finally rewatch it. Given a well timed release right before Valentines Day, this is a sweet romance that is suitable for the entire family and told from the unique perspective of two dogs.  Picture: It doesn't get better. Like Bambi I find this remaster to be spectacular, I don't see how anyone could complain. Nary a spot of grain (I personally didn't spot any in in my first of what will be many viewings) and not a single blemish otherwise. The colors are true to the original but as vibrant and pure as one imagines they've ever been. It's like watching the hand painted cells move before your eyes and nothing seems to have been negatively tampered with at all. This HD transfer makes Lady and the Tramp look as if it could've been animated yesterday, the only tip off is that they don't put this much care into hand drawn animation anymore. The backgrounds are gorgeously done and the characters are realistic but stylistically animated, the human characters being purposefully the most simplistic. This film has the style of the other 50's era Disney films, it is kindred to Cinderella but the dogs are so realistically captured that they remind me of the animal designs in Bambi.  Audio: The audio is just as good as the animation with a 7.1 DTS-HD track. This isn't a film that is full of sound but all the sounds that are present are clear and distinguished, I couldn't ask for more.  Special Features: Is it me or in general has Disney not been putting as much new content on their Diamond Editions as they did on their Platinums? Perhaps I've just been spoiled but it may also be in part as they've released the films so many times by now. I will say I am very happy with the new supplements provided for this particular release. Here fans will be happy not just with the High Definition but with Disney's attempt at providing new and interesting extras that clearly took some time.  Audio Commentary: Inside Walt's Story Meetings - The best extra by far, these have been included on many recent Disney films both Diamond and not. It is informative and clearly took some time. Not only have they assigned recurring actors to play the same parts but here they have found pieces of discussion that apply directly to what you are viewing on the screen, simply amazing. These are great for those interested in film, listening to these conversations you really get a sense of Walt Disney, his team and their story crafting genius and animation know-how. They discuss every detail and always have some interesting angle for approaching each scene. They really considered the audience the entire time theycreated these amazing classics and by the time they made Lady and the Tramp you can see they really know what they're doing. They also make reference to several other films (Bambi, Sleeping Beauty) and discuss the state of the business briefly.  Deleted Scenes: There are three new deleted scenes. As I think people know by now most of the scenes are abandoned storyboards turned into animatics and not actual animation. There is a narrator and voice actors playing the characters. I enjoy these, here viewers get twenty minutes worth of new material (though I probably won't watch them very often).  Introduction of Boris - A long abandoned scene about two early concept neighbor dogs, Homer and Boris, who would vie for Lady's affection. This is neat to see but I'm glad they decided to go the Trusty and Jacques route, they are much better characters. (10mins Approx)  Waiting for Baby - The shortest scene finds Lady with Jim Dear awaiting the arrival of the baby. Jim Dear is seen wanting a baby boy and imagining all the things that will come. Another interesting scene but you can see how they moved pieces around and ultimately did without it. (2mins Approx)  Dog Show - Finds Lady and Tramp sneaking into a stage performance of dancing poodles where they accidentally cause havoc before making a run for it. This is mostly just bit gags. (8mins Approx)  Never Recorded Song: \\"I'm free as the breeze\\" - storyboards are again shot as a sort of animatic that plays as the song is heard. It is actually a great song that would have fit the tone of the film but was dropped only because they decided not to make Tramp a singing character. I'm glad to have heard it.  Diane Disney Miller: Remembering Dad - A featurette (just under 8 minutes) that finds Disney's daughter recollecting on her father, primarily an apartment he had above the fire station in Disneyland. This basically serves as a tour of that apartment as items she discusses are shown in detail as you hear her describe them and relate them to her father.  Introduction by Diane Disney-Miller - Disney's daughter gives a plug for the Disney museum in San Fransisco and tells why Lady and the Tramp was a special film for her father, runs just over a minute in length.  **Note: I have not yet used the Disney Second Screen on this item but have on past releases. I'm sure, just as on previous releases, it has copious amounts of behind the scenes drawings, animatics, storyboards, designs, etc., all of which can be accessed from your computer while watching the film (there's also games but I've never played them). On that note, I did miss on this release that they didn't incorporate any of that content directly into the Walt's Story Meeting feature on the disc, as they did on Bambi for example. I'll update the review when I get a chance to actually look through the feature.  Classic DVD Bonus Features: Carried over from the Platinum Edition are - Lady's Pedigree, a 52 minute long documentary on Lady and the Tramp. Finding Lady - a 13 minute long featurette about making a great storyboard. Original 1943 storyboard version of the film. The Siamese Cat Song, a 2 minute featurette. A Belle Notte music video, Theatrical Trailers and 2 more deleted scenes.  So ultimately this film, which was a financial success but originally overlooked by most critics, has become a classic. It is probably one of the most referenced love stories in film if only because of the simplistic genius of a shared plate of spaghetti on a first date, but it deserves much more credit than that. This is a Disney classic everyone should own and every child should watch. 5 star film making and a 5 star release.
0393324818|4.0|I try to not over-think professional sports; I don't follow them too closely, nor do I participate in any fantasy leagues or anything like that. All I know about baseball is that I like going to games to drink beer and throw peanut shells on the ground. That being said, I found \\"Moneyball\\" to be a fascinating read and have already recommended it to couple of other people.  \\"Moneyball\\" tells the story of the Oakland A's, and how they were able to build a successful team while having one of the lowest payrolls in the league. They were able to win as many games as the New York Yankees, but while spending only a fraction of the money. General Manager Billy Beane, the focus of the book, recruited players who maybe didn't have the most stellar stats but were good and affordable. For example, rather than focusing on batting average (hitting the ball and getting on base), which is the big \\"selling point\\" for a player, he looked at a player's on-base percentage (which includes walks). Getting on base leads to runs, and runs leads to wins, and wins lead the playoffs -- who cares if you got a walk or hit the ball? Little insights like that, where you see how Beane flipped conventional baseball wisdom on its head, are the most delightful parts of the book.  Author Michel Lewis' writing style is great, very journalistic and easy to follow. However, the book did slow down in some parts for me, when it got a little *too* \\"inside baseball\\" for my tastes. If you're someone who really keeps on top of players and their stats, then you're going to love every word in here. I, on the other hand, found myself skimming a paragraph here and there when it got down in the weeds. Overall, I still felt like it was an accessible read for most people.  This book has increased in popularity since they made a movie based in it in 2011. I've added the movie to my Netflix queue and really look forward to seeing how it compares to the book!

1849025975|5.0|I reread this book after decades of having first picked it up and I think that I got a little more of it than at first because since that time I learned more of Stalinism from reading Solshenitzin and Robert Conquest (and if you haven't read those books, do so!).  A lot of rubbish has been written about the Spanish Civil War, almost all of it by leftists who have caricatured it: that it was a noble struggle of the Spanish people who tried to throw off the yokes of oppression and establish a decent life, but their idealism was stifled by Fascism, Mussolini, Hitler and the reactionary Catholic Church, yada, yada, yada. The other side, though it is seldom heard, is likewise a caricature.  Homage to Catalonia shows that it was a highly complex, fluctuating, maelstrom. Written in the first person from someone who repeatedly---and refreshingly---warns the reader that his perspective was limited, and possibly biased, Orwell served as a volunteer in the Republican side on the Aragon/Catalonia front in the static, filthy, trenches (he did so, motivated by the leftist propaganda in England). At that time, each of the political parties, all of them leftists, had their own militia and he ended up in the POUM militia; it was being deliberately starved of arms by the Stalinists who were preparing to exterminate all of the members. Orwell ended up being shot at the front and on returning to the home front, he quickly learned that the Stalinists had began to portray the POUM as a Fascist entity, and/or a Trotskyite entity and thousands of arrests were being made and the POUM headquarters occupied; many of his friends and his comrade in arms who had been fighting the Fascists were arrested and shot as being Fascists. Ultimately, he escaped, thanks to the help of the British consul.  Once in Britain, he was incensed at the printed lies that the leftist press put out explaining the pogrom of the POUM. He deals at length on this and this alone is worth reading when you think about ourmodern main stream media (which repeatedly claims to be impartial and professional).  Throughout, Orwell has an affinity for the Spanish people, although he predicts that no matter how the civil war ends, it will turn out to be a disaster for the people. His sympathies are strictly on the side of the working class.  Incidentally, there was a very strong Anarchist movement within Spain which likewise had its own flag and militia and which Orwell credits with having saved the Republic in the beginning of the struggle. It was responsible for the destruction of the churches and the massacre of priests (Spain was one of three countries with a very strong Anarchist presence, the others being pre-Soviet Russia and pre-Fascist Italy). I wish that he had dwelt a little more on them.

I noticed some artifacting & banding in the shot, which kind of took away from this shot, which is in my opinion one of the best in any movie. Otherwise, I did not notice any kind of problems at all. Black levels were nice & everything looked crisp, clear & sharp. The audio mix was equally perfect. It's a great Blu-ray & definitely a great addition to your collection, if you like the movie.
B005C9YZIW|2.0|I can't get beyond the fact that this title is over compressed to fit on the discs.  It's easy to see in scenes like the large numbers of birds in flight where there's more compression artifacts than birds visible.  I notice it all over the rest of the content as well.  It's very discouraging and has taken a lot away from what this title could have been.  If they reduced the number of episodes per disc and turned up the bit-rate we'd have an amazing Blu-ray.  The wonderful camerawork, footage and narration make this title interesting.  Unfortunately the technical aspects of the Blu-ray transfer are a mess.
B000002VCQ|5.0|I am shocked and grieving; Whitney Houston has died all too soon--she was merely 48 years old! The daughter of gospel singer Cissy Houston, the cousin of 1960s pop diva Dionne Warwick and even the goddaughter of Aretha Franklin, Whitney was born to be a star; and that's the way I will always remember her. \\"You Give Good Love\\" and \\"The Greatest Love of All\\" were two of my very favorite Whitney Houston tunes; it's great to have them here.<br /><br />And the rest of what we get is nothing short of bliss; this is Whitney's very strong debut album that showcases her vocal prowess and proves she was a superstar. Numbers I really like include \\"Saving All My Love for You;\\" this number alone is worth the price of admission and has Whitney singing like very few others ever could! \\"Nobody Loves Me Like You Do\\" is a fine duet with Jermaine Jackson; and I also love that dance beat as Whitney sings flawlessly on \\"How Will I Know.\\" \\"All At Once\\" is very poignant; Whitney massages the lyrics to this ballad like a pro! \\"Hold Me\\" is another great tune.<br /><br />This is very highly recommended for any Whitney Houston fan; and it even makes a fine starter CD for anyone just discovering the incredible artistry of Whitney Houston.<br /><br />Thank you, Whitney! We will never forget you!
B0071T5PN0|5.0|OK, I'm not a big Van Halen fan or anything. I've always wanted to like them but I tended to like 3 to 5 songs an album; and I couldn't stand Michael Anthony's vocals (God bless him, he seems like a nice enough guy but please no!, (Chickenfoot III has his vocals mixed WAY back.) I got this first day because I thought the sound clips sounded decent enough.  Listened thru and I wasn't floored but I loved the guitar tone and I thought they were rockin'!  I felt this would be an album that might grow on me.  Days later, I am absolutely floored! Man oh man has this album come through!  Dave has delivered absolutely great rock and roll lyrics, a way underated feat! It gonna be great to see vocalists try to cover these songs.  The phrasing is something else!  The bass parts are great, they add to the tunes. Eddie is delivering! My take right now is all the guitar/bass parts and solos revolve around Alex, he is the glue holding the band together and pushing the energy big time!  Again not a big fan actually, but I've wanted to be, just thought they've delivered, but albums as a whole have fallen short.  I feel they've come back with a vengeance, not giving a damn about what the lastest thing is. This is VH puro.  Absolutely Rockin! Best front to back VH album I've heard!  What a pleasure!

B0071QIN00|2.0|I got this game and it it very irratating. the controls are very buggy and important buttons like the jump button are small and hard to hit at the right time. not worth 2 dollars. the gameplay is great but the buggy controls makes it very unfun and irradiating.

B0073LWEXK|5.0|love this game. for me, it has the right amount of character movement and puzzles (logic, matching, observation, etc). I hope another game of this type comes out very soon! I'm definitely intrigued by fire maple games, and I'll be impatiently waiting for the next one.

1589944607|4.0|First off, this game is not a toy per say. This game is very well thought off and nicely laid out. I want to say that the game is favors Cylons awful lot, so the odds of humans winning are dim, but then again I think thats how it's supposed to be, isn't it?  It took us some time to figure out how the game is played, since the game has way too many rules. Even now we have to refer to the rule book a few times! We also had to tweak some rules in order to make it finish a little faster(~2 hours) without killing the fun.

0439023491|4.0|Were it not for the lackluster and somewhat abrupt ending, I would have enjoyed CATCHING FIRE as much as the first book in this series. This is forgivable if the third and final novel of the trilogy nails it (and I will find that out shortly).<br /><br />I am not a fan of labels and once must again reiterate that this is far more than a YA novel. It is not for kids and contains very idealized socialogical and political ideas coupled with brutality at the highest scale. It is also one of the most exhilirating reads of the last decade and a complete antithesis to the mormon-infused nonsense that is the \\"Twilight\\" series.<br /><br />CATCHING FIRE now finds our protagonist Katniss as the pawn in a battle between the uprising Districts and the far from benevolent government that rules them. When the President decides to have a Quell Tournament featuring the past 25 years of Hunger Game winners it is a move meant to wipe out all the popular heroes that the districts draw their influence from. Will Katniss and Peeta survive this latest Hunger Game where there can only be one winner or does the government have something else in mind?<br /><br />Cannot wait for the film version of THE HUNGER GAMES and hope they do not water it down for mass consumption.

B004EPYZP8|3.0|This movie is worth seeing. I'm just glad I did not rush out and see it in the theater. I'm not the biggest fan of Matthew McConaughey but I must say, he was good in this movie and convincing in his role as a lawyer who was not seen as Mr. Justice, if you know what I mean. I just found the story rather weak. It could have been much better I think. I have not read the book but from the reviews of the movie I was just hoping for more. Something along the lines of The Rainmaker. Which I think had much better courtroom scenes. I know the stories are nothing a like but this movie did not hold up as well with court drama or story over all in my eyes. Still, if you are at home looking for something to watch and you have Amazon Prime go for it.
1451627289|4.0|Jimla!!  I'm not a big fan of Stephen King's writing but this one I enjoyed.  It was impossible to put this book down once I began. It was a bit slow getting to the assassination but the sequence arriving was as interesting as any and once Oswald was involved it only picked up steam.  Those interested in JFK, time travel, the butterfly effect and guardian angels will find it fascinating.  It does not go down the path of conspiracy theories generally associated with the murder of JFK.  King's premise is that changing the past is not as simple as it would seem.
B005P3NPXG|4.0|Really glad I brought this CD. Buying a whole CD is rare for me. I have gotten used to just picking a song here and there for .99 or so and being very happy with that because most CD's just don't live up to the hype anymore. This one I can gladly say, did. I love all of the songs except for one or two and that is a winner in my book. Some really great soulful love songs. Just in time for Valentine's Day.

B004A8ZWWE|4.0|I like Hugh Jackman and most of the movies he's been in, and I would have to say that although it didn't blow my mind, this was a pretty enjoyable movie all in all.  I didn't think the end of the movie was very fair, but at the same time it was still pretty good.  Don't go into this movie expecting a mind blowing experience, but it is still good and worth at least a watch.
0872860175|5.0|In February 2012, the book discussion group at the LGBT Center in NYC had a large-ish group, many of whom had read the poem before and were re-reading it after a couple of years, but many of whom were reading it for the first time. Even those who had just read it the day of the meeting we able to comment on its surreal and powerful effect.<br /><br />Many readers thought that \\"Howl\\" was dark and disturbing, the hallucinations were too strong and too drug induced. But others thought that (as Ginsberg intended) \\"Howl\\" is an ultimately uplifting poem, full of praise for the youth who were its market and who would carry the poem into the future and make it as famous as it is.<br /><br />Some of the readers had a \\"facsimile\\" edition showing the careful and multiple edits that Ginsberg made to bring the spontaneous-seeming poem to life. A few others had done research and realized that all the events of the poem (especially those in Part I) were based on real events: Ginsberg in a mental institution, Jack Kerouac driving across country, Carl Soloman (to whom the poem is dedicated) introducing Ginsberg to a rich full life both in the mental institution, lovers and sex and drugs and poetry readings and visions and explicit gay sex (in 1955! more than a decade before Stonewall! !) and catalogs of people and events (like Walt Whitman) and a world of knowledge and mystic thought (like T.S. Eliot).<br /><br />But the highlight of the meeting was Joan, a 93-year-old resident of the village and poet who knew Ginsberg (\\"the sweetest man I ever met\\") and Kerouac (\\"what a drunk\\") and told us stories of her meetings with all the beat poets. Wow! I was blown away. She was a major surprise, completely entertaining, and was able to point out a couple of things that only a contemporary of Ginsberg know:  In 1955, the horrors of the Holocaust were still coming to light. Ginsberg, as a non-soldier and as a Jewish author, was overwhelmed by the stories that were emerging. Some of these images made it into \\"Howl.\\" And the H Bomb was still very real and an overwhelming threat in 1955. The image of the bomb threads its way through the poem in ways that may not be immediately obvious to contemporary readers.<br /><br />More on Ginsberg-friend Joan: Interview with a Poet: [...]<br /><br />This was an amazing meeting where EVERYONE learned something powerful about the beat poets and the area around The Center in the 1950s.nd the H Bomb was still very real and an overwhelming threat in 1955.

B000PMLFRA|1.0|Ray Harryhausen was the preeminent special effects guru from the mid-50's through to the next decade. Watch Jason and the Argonauts... you'll see what I mean.  Yet, his effects played merely a role in the crafting of what became great movies. And to top it off, no one has ever thought to touch his movies with CGI nonsense. Why? Because it would ruin the original vision.  George Lucas has become so enchanted with all of the effects at his disposal today, he wants to \\"update\\" his work of yesterday. The only problem is, nothing he adds makes the original stories any better. Why?  Because it's all unnecessary. To a pixel.  A good chef knows restraint. Lucas knows no restraint. And so he has ruined the original movies. He has turned Han Solo into a hack instead of a bad*ss, he's made Vader a petulant whiner. The icons of my youth, and the youths of many others, have been warped and diluted by George Lucas' pursuit of the almighty dollar.  All I ask is that he release the theatrical versions of Episodes 4-6, cleaned up for Blu-Ray. Heck, if he packages them with all six films, I'll buy all six and throw Ep. 1-3 in the bin. But there's no reason to deny his ORIGINAL fans what they've dreamed of all these years.
B0076HLLSA|1.0|We downloaded this rental to a TiVo DVR. The movie was hard to follow and not much more than ancient conspiracy theories. Few if any of the characters were worth the time.  I am really hear to review the Amazon service.  * The movie was very low quality. It disolved into digital snow often while watching. It recovered but was very distracting.  * You can only keep it for exactly 24 hours. Come on, no DVD rental place would be so ungenerous. Here is what happened to us. We got sleepy in the middle of the movie. We paused it and started up the next day. We got all the way to the last 15 minutes and the 24hrs expired. This is a likely occurrence since they don't give you 24+the running length of the movie. So make sure you are going to watch it in one go or you will get a really nasty surprise right as the movie is drawing to a conclusion.  As for me, I won't be renting from Amazon until the 24hr policy changes.

B00318COS4|5.0|Braid sparked my interested in the analytic/puzzle solving genre of games.  I thought the gameplay in Machinarium was just as good...but that artwork was even better.  I am thoroughly impressed.<br /><br />The development was out of the Czech Republic and if you checkout their website they have some other really interesting projects as well (although this game appeared to be the best one).  The only thing I didn't agree with from other reviews was that this game would be fun for kids.  The analytic/problem solving skills required would, in my estimation, be at minimum at a teenager level.  Some of the puzzles are really tricky.  You will spend 98% of this game confused and questioning your most basic assumptions about the obscure world you are in...but then when you solve each puzzle it will give you a momentary feeling of victory before you eagerly want the next challenge.

B002KKCVX2|5.0|My wife and I each got a pair of these for our trip to Kauai and loved them.  I haven't owned a pair of Teva's for 20 years and they've definitely improved.  These had a very strong rubbery smell when we first pulled them out of the box, but don't notice it now they've been used.  We wore these as we hiked all over the island of Kauai and they worked great. Cushion was great, we climbed over rocks, through mud and jungle and had no problems.  Almost bought a closed toe type of sandal but these were great because anyone who has spent time on a beach knows that sand gets everywhere and with these you could just shake it out, unlike a closed toe.  My wife and I commented on how stable we felt.  No sores or irritations anywhere even after a full day of hiking with them on.  I am SO picky when it comes to shoes and these were perfect for what we needed them to do.

0307454541|2.0|I really don't understand why this book has become so popular. Is it because of the movies? I got about 25% of the way through and just couldn't go any further! I found it an extremely tedious and mundane read. WAY too much background information about each character, whatever happened to \\"Show don't tell\\"?  I am usually the type that can struggle through a book even if I don't like it, because I hate to leave them unfinished, but for this I just had to give up and watch the movie!

B005SFR7YE|4.0|First of all, the casting was superb in this. I was so happy to hear that they were using Ramin Karimloo(the phantom) and Sierra Borgess(Christine) who both performed in Andrew's sequel to Phantom of the Opera, 'Love Never Dies' (although I didn't care for the sequel all that much). Carlotta's character in this was actually a bit three-dimensional and even sympathetic (a pleasing change in pace compared to past Carlotta's).  The one performance that I had an issue with was Hadley Fraser who played Raoul.  His portrayal of Raoul was way too hostile and aggressive when he's supposed to be sweet and even a bit naive (like how Patrick Wilson portrayed him in the movie).  Honestly, I believe that this was done on purpose so that it is easier for the audience to accept the fact that he becomes an abusive, gambling drunkard in the sequel, but I digress. Ramin and Sierra are perfect for their parts and their pitch perfect voices, movements, and facial expressions will take your breath away.    My biggest issue with this production is the location.  Due to the size of Albert Royal Hall several of the beloved effects had to be left out such as the chandelier falling.  Also, low resolution tv screens had to be used which were so horrible that it made me cringe at times.  Honestly, I think they should have pulled a few strings and performed it at the actual Opera Garnier in Paris which is a lot smaller than the Royal Albert and then they would have been able to incorporate all of the special effects that we all know and love.    While this show does have its drawbacks it still has that magical and outstanding quality that makes this musical so unique and memorable. Anyone who is a phan should buy this dvd.

B001NA2NM4|5.0|I saw this once many years ago and was horrified at the \\"freaks\\", never having seen such deformities before. The end, where the freaks are chasing after the beautiful trapeze artist, who is at the end seen as a duck mutilated hideously and quacking in a cage at the circus after being attacked, was a true horror. In fact it was the most terrifying<br />thing I have ever seen in a movie to this day.<br /><br />This second time, I was deeply moved, tears in my eyes at the cruelty of nature, and the plot, so timeless.  Those who are less fortunate are often preyed upon by others.<br />In this case, the tiny midget is in love with the normal sized beauty, who pretends to love him and marries him for his fortune while mocking him behind his back.<br />As if nature was not cruel enough, human beings deliver the cruelest blows of all.<br /><br />This is a smorgasborg of deformity.  While it was titilating and still is, and indulges our base desire to stare and look down on (yes, we do, even if we will not admit it to ourselves) those who are less fortunate, there is something else here that is much deeper.<br /><br />While some of us have deformities that are physical and hideous, others of us have spiritual and moral deformities that are less obvious.  Sometimes hiding behind a beautiful face and body is a monster, ready to prey on others, ridicule, insult, debase and even kill.<br /><br />In this case, the beautiful face that was hiding a monster within was gratifyingly made into a physical monster.  There was a sense of finally seeing justice in the world.<br /><br />I felt terrible pity for some of the freaks in this movie.  These are some of the worst deformities I have ever seen.  Yet they were presented with dignity and shown to be human<br />and decent people.  You can't ask more from any movie than this delivers.
B00000IMTH|4.0|I was intoduced to this lp as a young 19 year old in 1976 and was blown away! Ronnie James Dio, and Richie Blackmore was on fire! This is without a doubt the only Rainbow lp that I have ever cared for because it simply rocks. Rainbow gets kinda crazy after this. Blame that on Blackmore. Meanwhile Ronnie James Dio went on to make his mark in rock history as one of the most defined and recognized vocalist ever. If you listen to Long Live Rock & Roll you will see that Ronnie was set into this style of song writing and rock to carry on for his whole career.    Thats what makes it the premier Rainbow lp in my opinion, its the begining of a rock legend in Dio and the swan song of one of rocks best guitarist in Blackmore. This one belongs in your collection, much more so than Rainbow Rising.
B0063GORYU|3.0|I am new to kindle but I have always enjoyed spider on windows.  This is an adequate version. Not as smooth as the windows edition but better than any Mac versions I have tried.

B0064NTZQ2|5.0|To a meta-point, it is pretty interesting how - based on the reviews here - this movie polarizes opinion. I wasn't expecting that. I came on here to confirm a theory that it'd be redundant of me to leave yet another 5-star review. I was wrong.  This really was a hypnotizing experience, and far more than what I've come to expect from movies. It gives the viewer everything they need and then leaves them alone with themselves without further courtesy. Possibly the 1-star reviewers are uncomfortable with themselves. I thought it walked the line beautifully, though. A very impressive, exciting, thought-provoking experience.
B0062P332Y|3.0|If not for the killing, and lack of female characters, this could be an 80's porn.  Basic shoot'em up show, some unique methods, and interesting given the period it's placed in.

Ignore the 1 star mindless dimwit reviews. It's pretty obvious those people are Sammy lovers who would bash the album regardless. I actually like some of the Sammy stuff, 5150,For Unlawful Carnal Knowledge and Humans Being. Trust me this album is killer. Buy it!

B002OT731E|5.0|My favorite live Stones album.  Here they are the band we dream of, not the titans of Arena Rock (which they are quite good at).  Just a real band playing the rocking blues better than anybody in the world.
B00328R21C|5.0|This is a good Lego set for starters as well as fans of the movie. It comes with 4 figures from episode 4. Luke sky walker, obi one kenobi, R2D2, c3PO and a sand trooper. I bought this set along with snow trooper army set at Walmart.com for only 29.00 dollars. Yes, the Land speeder itself was 24.99 but if you buy the bundle pack you get both for 29 dollars.
B0073LWEXK|5.0|The story that goes along with this mystery is magnificent! I felt that you had gloom at the spoilers alot for the orders of the clues. But the graphics are great! 5 stars for LOST CITY!!!!!
B0015DROBO|5.0|All three books in the series are just great reads.  I would highly recommend all three books in the series.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Easy to follow - love the OT Hebrew notations.  Totally engrossing!  Right at my finger tips, easy to read and follow.  Much easier than trying to turn onion-skin pages.  God's word never grows old or boring'
B0069GRIHW|5.0|\\"She Smells So Nice\\", or whatever it's called, is quite weak, as is  \\"Rock Me\\". What you want this release for are the 7 alternate takes of the L.A. Woman songs. Very interesting, significantly different and extremely enjoyable versions of the album's songs. All the members of the band are excellent, creative musicians, a fact which these tracks amply demonstrate. A welcome transmission from Planet Morrison.
B0068TL23G|5.0|This is a great game. It is based on a simple premise, but later chapters are challenging enough to be worthwhile. Think of the first chapter as a practice round to learn maneuvers.
B005TPCQ5I|4.0|\\"One Day\\" is a really beautiful movie. At some point you'll want to hit Dexter in the head but you'll get over it as he develops. It is a quiet story about two friends who eventually figure out that they really complete each other. Their way to that discovery is long and not always fun but it feels real and was a real joy to watch.  The soundtrack is also lovely and complements the story.
6301966562|5.0|I've been waiting over 20 years for them to release this movie on DVD - when I see some of the GARBAGE that is released, and this one is overlooked, it boggles my mind.  It came out on video at a very high price, just as the prices for videos took a sharp drop. Not many people would have bought it, thinking that it would be re-priced, and I was among them.  It wasn't.  At least I have the sound track!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|its entertaining lots of games.some games are real easy some are too difficult.  its free too so even better.  hasn't crashed my kindle like a lot of free apps.
B0071QIN00|2.0|This game could be great. The first level starts out easy and then the level difficultly progression is outrageous. There is no consistancy or predictability with checkpoints. Also, there are several impassible points which are almost inevitable to come accross. But, it WAS free so I guess I shouldn't complain. This is not a game I would suggest though.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|My kids and I love this app! I am not sure why there are so many negative remarks. It does have a good bit of ads but the app is free. It will take awhile to complete the game and that is the best part. I have a few favorite games that I keep playing over and over again to get more points. Love it!!!!!! :)

B000O8OTNC|4.0|I've tried the product on a couple of knifes.  It does a nice quick job.  I have a lot of things to sharpen like hatchets and axes.  I use a Nicholson file to get those bigger things sharpened.  For a quick job on my knives; this sharpener does an adequate job.  Be sure to read the directions if you purchase this sharpener.  The second sharpener slot is for knives that are very dull.  You use the second sharpener first and, finish the knife off with the normal sharpener slot.  I purchased the sharpener to get free shipping.  I've got some really nice things by doing that.
B005UDD1R6|1.0|the initial reviews must have been submitted by the developer, his friends, and/or his employees.  This application will not play wmf or flv videos.  And despite claims to the contrary, it won't play mp4 files either.  Too bad there is no zero stars option.
B0066WJLU6|5.0|this is great!! different colours and its very bright. perfect for the kindle fire. the great that its free too.
B0073LWEXK|5.0|The graphics alone would be reason to get this, but the adventure is entertaining. Requires memory and ingenuity. Can't wait for Fire Maple's next game!
B006T5FDLG|3.0|Metallica needed to do something to reclaim their metal roots after the \\"HUH?\\" release with aging alternative rocker Lou Reed, --and this release acts as a band-aid to their Boo-Boo, Lulu.  I knew this was going to be a failed collaboration, for even the album art was as hard on the eyes and the music within the release was hard on the ears. Lulu made St. Anger (which I thought had some good material, but the production was just plain awlful) look like Kill \\"Em All.  I think metallica needs to do like van halen--revisit some old, unfinished works during their classic periods, breathe new life into them and release it as \\"new\\" material.  It's owed to the fans and the 25th anniversary of Cliff Burton's passing....
B0070Z4M4I|3.0|Saw this movie a few nights ago. It was kind of creepy. Of course we have The CGI monster, and the CGI snow, and the CGI helicopter, and...well I wouldnt be surprised if this whole movie was shot in Hawaii on a Green screen. I was born in an age of \\"No CGI\\" so Im biased. Hundreds of millions of dollars spent in CGI and I can STILL tell the movie looks fake..I mean REALLY fake.  Hollywood should do away with the CGI and the remakes and focus on creativity and not the quick buck...but of course thats never gonna happen!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|The reason I like 101-in-1 games is because it gives you more than one thing to do for the price of one. It is fun to play and exciting to win.
B000WAEJZ0|5.0|I'm still in shock. I'm so glad I bought this cd. I grew up listening to her amazing voice. Every song still gives me goosebumps! I will miss her and her amazing voice so much. Still can't believe she's gone. This cd will keep her alive in my life and in my heart. RIP Whitney!
0062011847|4.0|Sir Terry's latest Discworld novel tackles, as more than one of his past books has, racism. In the past it's been trolls and golems; in this book, it's goblins. Goblins are even less lovable, it seems, than beings made of stone or from animated clay. They are hard to understand (some say they can't talk), they eat disgusting things, and worst of all, they stink to high heaven. Oh, and their religion involves saving all their earwax, toenail clippings and snot. But they are sentient beings for all that, as Commander Sam Vimes of the Ankh-Morpork Watch quickly learns.<br /><br />Commander Vimes- Sir Vimes, the Duke of Ankh, as been ordered- er, persuaded- that he needs a vacation by his wife, Lady Sibyl. They have vast family holdings in the countryside, and it's time that their son, six year old Sam, sees them. This, in Vimes the elder's opinion, is just about the worst possible fate. He's a city boy, doesn't understand the country, and doesn't like having to deal with the rich and noble people that his wife's station puts him in contact with. He's a cop, a street cop.<br /><br />But a if a cop looks long enough he'll find a crime, and Sam isn't in the country very long before this turns out to be true. One person has disappeared, possibly murdered, and Vimes framed for it. Goblins are going missing. Smuggling is going on, and overlooked because of who is doing it. There follows a nonstop adventure, with numerous people involved in chicanery and lots of subplots.<br /><br />This book is a bit different from past Discworld novels. It's not a joke a minute story. It's funny, all right, but not in the same, manic, way. There is irony, sarcasm and just plain silliness, thankfully! Vimes is different than he was in the past, too. But Vimes is an older man now, and I see the change as being growth rather than diminishment. The social messages are a little bit more heavy handed, but not heavy handed to the point of being annoying. Like \\"I Too Shall Wear Midnight\\", it strikes me as a little more thoughtful and grounded. It's not my favorite Discworld book (the Tiffany Aching ones, and any with the Luggage in them, take the honors for me), but it's certainly well crafted and worthwhile.ul and grounded. It's not my favorite Discworld book (the Tiffany Aching ones, and any with the Luggage in them, take the honors for me), but it's certainly well crafted and worthwhile.
B0063GORYU|4.0|spider solitaire is a great app. I have wasted many an hour mindlessly playing. graphics are adequate. works just fine.
0738711500|5.0|This set is excellent. It comes in lovely packaging, the deck is beatifically illustrated. The book is very informative along with being rather simple to understand. It explains everything from preparing your deck, to the meaning and interpretation of every card, even answers a lot of burning questions most beginners have about the cards. I love that it came with a big poster that shows you exactly how to lay out the cards for the Celtic cross spread. The book itself teaches other spreads as well.<br /><br />I'm very pleased and well on my way to learning to handle my cards.
B0052UZIFA|1.0|Don't buy it here! There's an updated version (2/3/12) in Google's market. I wish it would get updated here. But in the meantime you should just buy it there.
B004L35GAQ|5.0|Take one dash of twisted, one dash edgy, two dashes of electronic synth, add it all up and then add double the amount of good-old fashioned pop sensibilities from the seventies and eighties.  That equals AWOLNATION. Clever and fun.  And did I say with hooks.  Lots and lots of melodic and lyrical hooks. For an adrenaline rush.<br /><br />All I Need, Ah-all I Need.  What happens if you blended Three Dog Night and the Beatles, updated with Gaga synths?  Burn It Down.  What happens if you combined little Richard with the Kinks, and Nine Inch Nails?<br /><br />Filthy Guilty Soul and Jump on My Shoulders. Maybe T-Rex and and Queen?  Knights of Shame.  Lovely  mix of all sorts of seventies and eighties influences.  A little of Emerson, Lake, and Palmer  influences.  And then there's Sail.  Simple idea. Techno sounds, and one listen will demonstrate this Aaron Bruno's genius. With an uncluttered hook.  This album is one of the most listenable pop/electronic albums to come out in a while.  One of the most addictive pop albums ever made.

0385528752|5.0|I was looking for an introduction to change management and this book provided it. Full of great examples whilst presenting a simple framework for making change happen and stick. Gave me the starting point I needed for a manufacturing business culture change.
B0071QIN00|1.0|this game is horrible and the reason I got it is because it is the free app of the day. there is no reverse button so if u get stuck in some parts you cant get out. and the checkpoints are infront of some stars so the only way to go back is to restart the whole round because there is no reverse button. also some levels are almost impossible to get all the stars.
0634089358|5.0|I come to bass from a guitar background and wanted to jump right in.  I have the benefit of knowing the fretboard already and how to read music.  This book is really a load of fun.  All the 5 stars this book has on Amazon are well deserved.<br /><br />I'm working with an instructor and using this book as a framework for my lessons.  He's enhancing the experience but this book is so well written that I prob. don't need the instructor until I'm done. I'm racing through it having a lot of fun.  Great bass lines to the greatest blues songs are covered with thoughtful comments and suggestions.  If you are a newish bass player you will need to know this material at some point so its good to have it in one place and dig in.<br /><br />The CD is fun.  When I first picked this up I put in the CD and wanted to listen to several random tracks.  This is usually a good test of the material inside the book.  If I like what I hear then I know I'll want to play / study it.  One strange minus is that the CD doesn't play in my DVD player.  It totally misreads the tracks. CD player and PC read it fine.  ITunes even had the correct labels for the tracks on the CD.  Windows Media wasn't 100% correct.<br /><br />Its not complete in the Blues style but for the cost its a fantastic value.  Its cheaper than 2 overpriced coffees.
1439152799|5.0|I thought this was an outstanding read.  I discovered that Kate Morton had written two other books; House At Riverton and Hidden Garden.  I read both of these books also, and really enjoyed them..  Would like to know if she has written more.
B0071QIN00|2.0|this game goes from enjoyable to extremely hard quickly, and is poorly coded. expect to get stuck half as if you were a ghost coming out of a ramp, except you couldn't pass all the way through the &quot;wall&quot;. the physics aren't consistent, nor is the audio level on the sound effects.

B000002VCQ|5.0|My heart is so heavy after learning the devastating news that Whitney Houston passed away. What a talented and awesome young woman Whitney was. I had several of her albums on cassette back in the day and I had replaced most of them with CDs.  Whitney's work speaks for itself. There is no denying that the girl was a powerhouse vocalist. All of her recordings are nothing short of perfection. Granted she had her share of problems as we all do, but who are we to judge anybody???  My favorite song on this CD is 'Greatest Love Of All' and I know that she has truely found the 'Greatest Love Of All' in heaven.  Rest in peace, my sister ~  Cheryl
B004G6009K|5.0|I loved this movie in 2d...but this 3d version simply amazed me.  Some of the best 3d I have seen so far...and I have seen most of the 3d titles currently available!  Tangled is pure magic in 3d...from beginning to end, simply stunning...a rare gem indeed.  Best purchase I've made on a 3d blu-ray movie yet.
B0071QIN00|3.0|Pretty fun. Worth a download to try it at least. Only problem I had is that the accelerator button can be glitchy. You lose it after you land a jump, and it can be annoying trying to get it back and get yourself moving.
B0011UBDTK|5.0|AMAZING!!! SINCE I BOUGHT THE COMPLETE SERIES I'VE ENJOYED EVERY MINUTE OF IT!! IF YOU ARE A SEX AND THE CITY FAN THIS IS A MUST HAVE!!
0307279189|5.0|A cross between an amazing novel, true story, and motivator to get out and run....especially with Vibrams 5 Fingers if not barefoot.  And it got me hooked.  Read and run, run and read....  Great insights in the Tarahumara, ultra long distance runners, and just a lot of fun.
B000002VCQ|5.0|RIP. Whitney what our we going to do without you. The music most of it today is terrible! Do you hear that record companys! What's with all this rap? It's not music and I love soul music country pop rock and jazz. I never hear anything I like nothing that catches my attention any more and I love music! Do you think only teens and twenty somethings are the only ones who buy music! If you would look back at the 50's 60's 70's 80's and 90's and some of the early 2000's to about 2006! maybe you will give people with great voices and great songs a listen too. And sign them. Wow where has all the great music gone they wont be going back to this last decade and play the songs like the others when I was in my teens. In the 80's and the 90's oh and the seventy's. I listened to artist's 20 or more years older. But for the people that like most of the music today. Good for you I dont want to say I hate any artist. And thats what people do listen to the music and try listening to other types of music just because an artist is 50 or more don't mean they can't make great music! We need help in the recording industry big time! Now we have lost whitney one of the best singers of all time. Get people who can sing and right great music that become classics or at least give other really talented people a chance don't think the teens and 20 year olds know what great music is. We like mellow rock like the eagles and journey. And we don't need them to dress up like halloween. So they can get attention I look at those people and think is this for real we have horror movies for that. Must not be very confident of an artist and you have young kids watching you. whew!!! and I am 45 five years young.ps pull your pant's up even dress like that on TV no class!and little wayne boy I have seen it all at least have some care in what you say and rap about! You guys sure aren't any role models and TV and recording companys dont care either as long as they make money.I used to always watch the awardshows such as the american music awards and the grammys etc. And no I think what there getting a grammy for that sad days in the music industry. booo!!!

145162445X|3.0|A slim volume that mostly covers well-trodden ground.<br /><br />On the plus side, the author's compelling demonstration that, if they are around then, cosmologists of the far future applying impeccable science will inescapably draw all the wrong conclusions about the birth and genesis of the Universe, is fascinating.<br />Because by then they'll be unable to observe a number of things, such as any erstwhile neighbouring galaxies which will have firmly drifted out of sight, or to perceive, let alone measure, things like the residual cosmic radiation background, or dark energy. Even if some of these cosmologists somehow stumbled upon the right, seemingly far-out ideas, applying Occam's razor rules would firmly relegate the correct scenario to the kook fringe.<br /><br />A very sobering thought.<br /><br />On the minus side, the author insists throughout, without providing a shred of evidence or even without really envisioning alternatives, that dark matter comes from hitherto undiscovered particles - there are however many other, exotic possible scenarios for how dark matter arises (such as, amongst other possibilities, the nearby presence of other universes from our own, within a larger multiverse) but all these other possible sources are given short shrift. Positing an a priori scenario somehow does not look like very good science.....<br /><br />As a review of how matter can arise from nothingness, this book is far too slim to be comprehensive - there is, for instance, only scant treatment of the 'quantum fluctuation' scenario first championed by Trion, or of the 'colliding membranes' scenario, or for that matter of Roger Penrose's interesting recent ideas, which remain largely ignored.<br /><br />In brief, an interesting book which leaves an aftertaste of somehow having an ulterior agenda, perhaps a pamphlet against mindless religiosity rather than a bona fide, purely science book.
B004SF2KNI|5.0|This is Clapton's most classic works.  He and the Domino's wrote it right before his heroin habit, which in my opinion, greatly affected the content of all the work he produced afterwords.  A must have for any mild to major Clapton fan.

B004BLDD9Y|4.0|August 2012 update:<br />I am dropping the review rating by one star due to the glass cover. It is fragile and it would be better if they used plastic.<br /><br />I have been using LED bulbs for several years. Initially I got some 6 watt ones from ebay. They were about 28 $ per bulb and very early technology. I have used many different kinds since then. Before talking about the particular item I want to make some general remarks:<br />LED bulbs are an evolving technology so anything I say now will be obsolete.<br />LED bulbs generate a lot of heat. If put in a fully enclosed space the electronics will burn out.<br />The claims for LED bulbs often do not account for its electronics. Once you add that they drop a lot.<br /><br />These bulbs are significantly better than the earlier ones I had. They are about 50% brighter than the earlier 6 watt LED bulbs I got and generate less heat. I have not had them long enough to know how long they last. So I get 50 % more light for about 1/3 of the price of the bulbs I got 2-3 years ago: nice!

B002GHHHKQ|5.0|I really enjoyed [[ASIN:0671004107 Contact]], written by Carl Sagan.  So I remember, years ago, of having high expectations for the movie version.  I was ready for an outstanding performance by Jodie Foster, but Matthew McConaughey was very well suited for his role as well.<br /><br />The ending, as you probably know, is different between the movie and book versions.  And in the book, there are more than one travelers allowed to go into \\"the Machine.\\"<br /><br />I started watching Contact again as I was running on a treadmill, and I was surprised that it held my attention so well that the miles just melted away (a 7 mile run).  And I recently watched a NOVA segment on \\"mirror neurons.\\"  The acting of Jodie Foster and the girl who played her as a young girl, using my mirror neurons, had me \\"living the experiences\\" with her.<br /><br />Great, great film.

B0069GRIHW|4.0|With the countless versions of Doors albums being released and re-released, one might view the band as money hungry and maybe they are, but this newest release of LA Woman is worth its price and its release. This contains the original mix of the album which has been \\"Remastered\\" and sounds awesome! The second disc is the real reason why I purchased this version of the album. There's at least one outtake for almost every track on the album. The only song that doesn't have an outtake is \\"L'America\\" which is a shame but that's a small complaint. A lot of fans complained about the 40th Anniversary Remixes and longed for the original album mixes to be \\"remastered\\" and here you have that in this release with a bonus disc of outtakes and early versions. Amazon also has 2 bonus outtakes and iTunes has yet 2 more bonus outtakes. So it is a drag that you have to purchase other releases to have all of the outtakes and demos (for example the demo for \\"Hyacinth House\\" from the Box Set). This release was a breath of fresh air and if you're a fan of this album, it's worth the $13.99! This is my favorite Doors album because to me it sounded completely original and it's a shame to have to wonder where the music could have gone. But this is a great album and just enjoy it. Groovy.

B0071T3Q9K|5.0|I would be disappointed if he didn't use his talent to try a different musical genre other than \\"Pop\\" or \\"Rock and Roll\\". The idea of providing his fans with a collection of Standards first came to my mind with the release of the \\"Broadstreet\\" album and the song \\"Goodnight Princess\\" even then I could imagine what it might be like; and now almost Thirty years later I am not disappointed. Would this album have been released by the Beatles; Wings, or even by Paul himself say Ten years ago? No, but that's not to say that it isn't a quality offering from a very talented musician. It continues to grow on me; so maybe I am getting older, but I have a true appreciation for his latest offering; and I think if given the chance, others will too.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book is unbelievably unique. I'm not usually a fan of dystopian fiction, but the imaginativeness of Suzanne Collins is just incredible. She pulls you into a futuristic, post-apocalyptic world that's so incredibly real and complete; she's worked everything out to the tiniest detail. This gives the book immense believability. And the storyline... it's almost impossible to put the book down. I also LOVED the main character, Katniss; it was so incredibly refreshing to have a female heroine who's so strong, so single-minded, and very flawed, yet in a way that makes her even stronger. Literature needs more characters like this! I absolutely cannot WAIT for the movie to come out; my only fear is that it won't do the book justice.

B000MR9D5E|5.0|I saw a couple episodes on commercial TV.  So, of course it was interrupted by commercials.  However the photography is so fantastic I decided to buy the DVD's to be able to watch it commercial free.  Best entertainment I have ever purchased and at a very reasonable price.  I find it totally absorbing, entertaining, and educational.  I imagine I will watch it repeatedly over the years.  The only quibble I have is that it takes a little bit of time to get into it.  The first disc has two commercials in the beginning.  One is for another set of DVD's called Blue Planet.  The other commercial is for BBC.  So far I've only watched two other discs and neither had those two commercials. Also I would prefer to have have it start up displaying a simple list of contents, you select one and get going.  These are a little more complicated than that.  Non-the-less the wait is soon forgotten once the episode starts. It will completely grab your attention - at least it did that for me.  If I could I would give it 6 stars.
B0073LWEXK|4.0|Good app but too short. There are some points where you might get stuck but stick with it and you will solve the puzzle. If you can't figure out the puzzles they give you hints. Good app but would be better if it was longer.

B005HSL626|5.0|I love this game, both in aneroid form and on the Xbox.  it has enough going on to keep u coming, but not so challenging that u will get frustrated playing it.  nice balance between the two.
0345529057|5.0|AWESOME PRODUCT! THANKS! Was really excited to get my books. They came on time and they were in great shape.
B0071QIN00|1.0|Just about 50 mb, ill wait for the next dev to make a copy that takes less space, got way better games at around 20 mb.
B004XJRQUQ|1.0|My daughters-in-law and my grandchildren have all read this trilogy, and recommended it to me.  I made it through the first book and half of the 2nd book, but finally today, I quit reading it.  I can find nothing inspiring or redeeming in this series, and the main plot line of young people being selected for the Hunger Games, wherein they are all trying to kill each other, was disgusting and disturbing.  Thousands of Amazon reviewers have given it 5 stars, which is beyond me.  The writing is certainly nothing extraordinary, and the characters, for the most part, are unlikable (or dead!)  Some reviewers have compared this series to Harry Potter or the Millenium trilogy.  I read all of those, and found them to be amazing.  This series I found to be pointless and very unredeeming.  I don't like to think that my grandkids read these, and in fact, are already making plans to go to the midnight screening when the movie opens.
B0058VW36U|5.0|This game is so worth it! It is super fun and addictong. Not to mention it envolves food and a really cute green monster! :)
B004UUKDNA|5.0|Foster the People's Torches is one of those albums that really rocks your world--it's a game changer. There is not a back track on this album; \\"Life on the Nickel\\" and \\"Miss You\\" may be at it's weakest point, but Torches certainly ends as strong with \\"Warrant\\" as it began. How could you not miss \\"Pumped Up Kicks\\", \\"Helena Beat\\", \\"Call It What You Want\\" and \\"Don't Stop\\" from the media barrage! For a long time I thought alternative music had died with the breakup of The Smashing Pumpkins, but Foster The People came back to prove anyone wrong! I don't know anyone around me who heard Torches and couldn't resist it! This is what a best album of the year is all about!
B00004I9PJ|1.0|Couldn't play it on our dvd player in North America, very very disappointed! We needed a different software because it was from Europe, go figure.
B004L49K20|5.0|Fantastic album, best followup to 1983's Rio; should have gotten way more buzz than it had last year in 2011. This is the Duran Duran that we all know and love, thanks to stellar producer Mark Ronson making the Duran Duran album that he claims to always have wanted since Rio. The single \\"All You Need Is Now\\" is so catchy and what captured my attention. \\"Girl Power\\" combines elements of \\"Girls On Film\\" and \\"The Reflex\\" and is just a great video that you must catch as the band pokes fun at itself! \\"Mediterrania\\" is a sprawling, beautiful song that will bring you back over and over again. \\"Too Bad You're So Beautiful\\" is among the catchiest songs of this album and has the kind of funky, killer bass line that only Duran Duran could pull off. All You Need Is Now is such a great album, hopefully it's not getting suffocated with all the aural, teenage money-making junk out there all the record companies appear to force on us! All you need is THIS album, and the Deluxe edition's great behind-the-scenes DVD is something you should spring for along with the cool beats!

B0071QIN00|3.0|can someone tell me why there are bombs in the middle of the tracks?  How frustrating is this..youre cruisin along, just hopped from one vert to another and blammm!!! right into a bomb..RESTART...its so lame!!!  The game is quite challenging but gets destroyed by myself hitting a bomb everytime.  Then restarting every 10 sec and hearing the dialogue &quot;Its fun&quot; over and over again.  No sir, &quot;its not fun&quot;..:)
0439023513|1.0|I loved the first two. I anxiously awaited the third. Boy, am I disappointed. Three themes: War is Hell, the danger of our voyeuristic habits, and people will do anything to survive.  These themes are firmly established in the first two books, and then Collins beats you over the head with them in the third.  *Spoiler Alert*  Peeta  We are told he will never be the same, over and over and over and over...and then he his, though how he gets there is never really revealed in any kind of satisfying way. Katniss who emotionally keeps him at arm's length for the first two novels, with a few exceptions, gives up on him completely in the third.  This is understandable given that he wants to kill her.  However, they end up together?! What?!!! Seriously. I want a explanation. Not an interpretation, an explanation. That should have been another chapter in the book. 380 pages of the book is blood bathe, 28 is the recovery there after.  We have been short-changed.  And really, for three books, you still end up asking, what really is in it for him? It is a very one-side relationship.  Gale  Gale and Katniss are finally together. YAY!  Oh, wait, nothing happens.  He is conveniently turned almost into an antagonistic by a character that admits she has no right to judge anyone, so he can go away and Katniss and Peeta can end up together.  Before this strange character shift, can anyone give me one nonsuperficial way in which Gale and Peeta are different? I like that Collins is very effective at making us unsure who she will pick for the almost the entire three books.  However, it's all resolved in about three pages.  Katniss  A character that has such strong focus for two novels, here, has none. She is a mess from the beginning and only becomes more psychologically broken, yet manages a near fairy tale ending. In all the excessive violence to teach us WAR IS HELL, Katniss, 17, experiences unspeakable loss and witnesses horrors that can only be imagined. It is interesting how out ofher family and closest friends, only one dies. Outside of that circle, and you are doomed. Despite this, she makes close to a full recovery.  The only sign of lingering distress is her delay to have children and the occasional nightmare. Really?  In prison all she wants to do is kill herself. Then she is placed in District 12, among the murdered bodies of thousands, in the home she shared with her now dead sister.  It's here that she begins her recovery. Yep, that makes sense. Really for all the gratuitous violence, it would be a more of a complete ending for her to kill herself or become a crazy blood thirsty killer soldier, forever broken.  This would actually be far more effective in conveying the horror of war.  Instead we have killer human/lizards that tear people to pieces and eats victims alive and a teenage murderer/soldier that lives happily ever after. Short-Changed.  Here lies the problem.  Collins wants to lecture us about war without having any real experience with it.  Read All is Quiet on the Western Front. Real violence, less violence, much more effective. Or 1984, or...anything.  Obviously, I could go on, but I think I have made my main points.  Sigh, Collins should have been given another year to write this book.  I would have happily waited.  Btw, Mad Annie is now a single mother? Anyone else disturbed by this fact?
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I totally recommend this. keeps you busy for a long time and all the games are fun and different!  get it!!
B0050DIWFC|5.0|I thought \\"Defending Jacob\\" was such a wonderful read. I loved it! I've been trying to find another book like it and can't. I would love someone else who read \\"Defending Jacob\\" to let me know what else out there compares to William Landay's writing, because I can't find it. He wrote such a wonderful book, the father in the book really spoke from the heart. You could, feel his pain, his wife's fear, it was just such an emotional read. Like I said, I LOVED \\"Defending Jacob\\". William Landay is such a wonderful writer. Read it, you too will really enjoy it.
B004ZNARH4|5.0|This release is a wonderful  treat for all Floyd fans as well as the remastering of the album sounds even better than before, as for bonus material of demos, live, and visuals dj Redbeard over-hyped the quantity of these items that would be in the set and one would have thought for the price set would have included much more bang for the buck, overall it is still a good set.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Awesome free game. Lots of fun and so far no issues and I have played it a lot. Would recommend and would buy again.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I love this one my kindle fire. The games are simple but fun. I like that you can unlock more games with the &quot;money&quot; you earned.
B006O5Y0SS|1.0|This was a boring, stupid movie.  Don't know why the big name actors agreed to make it.  Must have been paid a lot.  Had to have been boring to even make it.
B003L77G6A|5.0|I love this series. I highly recommend this season as well as all others! It is a different kind of humor than most shows out there. The set comes in a nice case and the video quality is well DVD quality...about as good as it gets. Can't wait for the fifth season to be released!
0525478817|5.0|Before reading John Green's excellent novel, The Fault in our Stars, I had never read any of his other books. I had seen a number of his brother's and his videos, but this was the first book of John's that I have read. Without knowing if I would even like it, I decided to purchase this novel, and boy am I glad that I did.  This book has great characters who feel real and are portrayed brilliantly. You quickly begin to fall in love with Hazel and Augustus.  I really recommend this book... Do not let the fact that it's listed as children's fiction turn you off to it. This is not a book for children, but is for teenagers and adults. I am sixteen, and I loved it.  After reading this, I definitely am going to read his other novels after reading this masterful story.
B003LPV960|5.0|Emma Thompson is excellent.  She portrays what needs to happen when lives need to be changed.  Sure its a tale that tweeks many areas that can't possible happen, but it fun to watch for the entertainment value.  Fantastic film especially in a time that had many of the \\"Greatest Generation\\" give their all for their countries.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|The app is simple to use and I love that I can tailor it according to my needs and schedule.

B0071T5PN0|5.0|Head to toe this CD is everything I hoped.  ANY fears that David Lee Roth and Eddie Van Halen would not be in top form were put to bed.  The lyrics were as sharp and as funny as ever, Al pounds the skins, and Wolfgang rounds it out.
B004EPZ0AC|1.0|Boring. I kept hoping someone would shoot me in the head to stop the gooey feelgoody horror.  Please do not see this abomination.
1592332803|5.0|This book is amazing. I have experimented with vegan baking for many, many years, and this one is tops. Every recipe I have tried has been delicious, and impossible to tell that it's vegan. The recipes are simple and easy to follow, and do not contain any ingredients that are hard to find. The \\"strangest\\" ingredient I have found in this book is egg replacer, which every vegan should have in the pantry anyway. I was skeptical when purchasing this book because of the vegan failures I have had in the past. This book has far exceeded my expectations. A must-have for every vegan.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|bug me to buy other apps that aren't available for me to buy. bug me to rate it which isn't an easy process. and the games aren't very fun. ads are understandable in a free app but these are ridiculous.
0811870413|5.0|I bought this book on the recommendation of a friend who had gone to L'Ecole Culinaire.  I had the idea of learning to bake bread after eating the artisan loaves from Zingermans in Ann Arbor, MI.  After reading this beautifully written and photographed book, I realize exactly why artisan loaves cost so much!  It takes a lot of experimentation, tending, and loving care to produce the perfect loaf.  I'm too lazy myself to try out the techniques in this book, but I'm glad I read it because it gives me a greater appreciation for the breadmakers of the world.
B006UG90RM|5.0|Out of Van Halen's 7 albums I put this as one of there best.  If you haven't already bought it, buy it now.  I'm not going to rave on about why it's so great.  If you like Van Halen you'll love this album.
B0070Z97LG|5.0|Seriously, I didn't really think it would end this amazing way. I loved the surprising twists and the family was so sweet. I truly suggest and recommend this to everybody! Great people in it, I love Rachel Wiesz and Naomi Watts.... I cried at the end too! lol I Loved this movie. ;D
1439192812|2.0|There is an elephant in the room: consciousness. Mr Dawkins, being a biologist, does not know what life is. He has a description, but he can not reproduce life in any form. A simple cell is out of his grasp. He is confused by his own words. He believes that a description is the real thing. He is in love with his own ideas and he doesn't realize that there are just words.  Science as powerful as it seems to be is still in the description. Maxwell equations do not show what electromagnetic fields are but how they behave.  Quantum physic does not say what an atom is but how its elements behave.

B004BLTNJI|1.0|my review is about this particular set since Coraline is an excellent film and in blu-ray is absolutely BEAUTIFUL! however, i bought this version with the digital copy in mind (trying to stay on the legal side) and universal, unlike other companies who have extended the valid dates for their digital copies, are not so nice about it. customer support was completely unhelpful jovially saying thanks! but providing no alternative for the digital copy aspect of this set for which i paid. highly disappointed in this version and universal's inability to work with the consumer.
6303122647|5.0|I was happy with the product, i was just buying it actually for a friend, because her first one got lost, she likes to collect old movies in VHS, so i did her a favor in getting her the Movie, thankful for finding it here on amazon,,,thank you.
B00005JPO1|4.0|This movie is NOT deserving of all the hate. It's just not. What are the haters saying? That Indy gets himself in unbelievable situations and lucks/flukes out of them? HELLO! That's what he did in the first 3 movies. Sure, the action may have been a little over the top, but this is based on pulp action shows. While not perfect, I think this movie was fairly in line with the rest of the movies. I think the Mayan - Alien thing isn't that far of a stretch. A lot of that culture is so advanced as to be unexplainable.  Ugh. Get off your nostalgic high horse, people, and enjoy seeing one of your favorite characters on the screen again.
B001QKSWOE|1.0|I really enjoyed the first books in the numbers series, but the later books seem like they are being ghost-written.  The tone and personality of the characters is not consistent. Initially, while the books are charming and laugh-out-loud funny, the later books are dull and repetitive. I stop caring about Stephanie, instead am annoyed at her commitment issues and her stupidity in her daily life.  If I had read the books starting with the most recent, I would never have made it past the first one.

B006UIYXL8|5.0|i was surprised how excellent this wss.  It's been skipped for the awards for the most part and the reviews haven't been all that good.  actually, in general i've discovered that leonardo dicaprio gets trashed a lot as an actor.  i can only assume it is because he has so much going for him.<br /><br />j. edgar is thus the consummate biography as filmed by clint eastwood from a marvelous screenplay.  it is as good as any of his best work.  dicaprio plays the title role magnificently.  arnie hammer plays his number two at the bureau wonderfully as well.  i can't imagine what else anyone could want in a biography of this man.<br /><br />eastwood does not hit us over the head with some of the present day allegations about hoover.  he presents them in the film and lets you draw your own conclusions.so as to his being gay and a cross dresser, that is quite likely.  however, we don't get bogged down with this lurid material.  the best part of the movie may be the deep and abiding love between Hoover and Colson, his number two man at the fbi.<br /><br />instead we see him build the fbi up from the ground. he also was almost solely responsible for bringing forensic science into the fbi. everyone thought he was a nut talking about fingerprints and such in the early 1900s. we also discover that Hoover used the Lindbergh baby kidnapping to force Congress into giving the FBI much broader jurisdiction over cases which they could take control instead of the police.<br /><br />you also see him with his infamous files on famous people which enables him to stay at the helm until his death.<br /><br /> his hatred of the kennedys is handled with lovely understatement.  when jfk is shot in dallas, hoover gets the call.  he calls rfk and simply tells him his brother has been shot and hangs up the phone.<br /><br />i highly recommend this film.<br /><br />Visit my blog with link given on my profile page here or use this phonetically given URL (livingasseniors dot blogspot dot com).

0823003035|5.0|This book is great! I have bought many books on figure drawing, trying to learn some of the techniques they teach in art school. This book helped me to get A's in my Drawing 3 art classes in college. Out of all of the figure drawing books I have, this one is the best. It teaches you to draw figures in a photo realistic  way. More like what you would think of when you see Michaelangelo's work in marble. Its not the 7 heads high line drawing type of figure drawing. You will learn to draw the figure and make them look realistic. Great book!
1416575464|4.0|This book is very good and for the average person who wants to get away from that stilted look, common to most decorating schemes, this is a big help.  It is chock full of color pictures and is very clear in every chapter about what is to be accomplished.  The only problem I have with this book is that I am a lifelong artist who has always made my space unusual, comfortable, eclectic and not too neat.  I did not find one idea in this book which I already was not using.  So this book was of minimal use to me personally.  I have fared better on some other books on getting some useful ideas.  For those trying to break the preconceptions of rigid decorating principles though, this may be the book for them.<br /><br />I do have one quibble. This author, like many other decor authors, loves putting up a wall full of art, all the same size so that there are maybe 10 or so framed pictures roughly the same size on one wall.  I have never been able to look at art grouped in this fashion because it is too hard to focus on one piece.  Go to a museum or art gallery and I guarantee you will never seen such a grouping at either.  To throw your art work all together, much less rigidly lining it up on the wall together, you have to really know what you are doing to pull it off.<br /><br />Visit my blog with link given on my profile page here or use this phonetically given URL (livingasseniors dot blogspot dot com).

B00005ONMP|4.0|Not a music snob here. Reading some reviews before my purchase, I got the impression some folks sit there with a score card or are judging Dancing With the Stars. My appreciation is more basic and I found this to be a very good set. The one drawback is when downloading into my MP3, the playlist installed on the CDs doesn't actually match the jacket cover.  As played on the MP3 player, the sequence matches the jacket cover but not the downloaded playlist.
B002QKZLZ6|5.0|If you're paying that much for the headset [[ASIN:B005IMB5SG Plantronics Voyager PRO HD Bluetooth Headset - Retail Packaging]], you should consider paying a bit more for the case. I travel a lot and it's difficult for me to find the headset especially after having to shove it into the bag for airport security. It's a neat case which holds the headset in a folded position and it has a clip that I use to clip onto a divider in my bag. When I need it, I know where to find it and it stays protected.

B00138CYD4|5.0|I have a couple of Santana's CD's, but didn't have any on my mp3 players.  Therefore, when I saw this new album, I had to get it.  It's got some of the classics, as well as some new songs.  Although his sound is indistinguishable, it's got a refreshing feel to it due to it's new accompanying artists.  I don't know how old Santana is, but his hands are still golden on that guitar.  I highly recommend this album.

0743277465|3.0|There are some valuable principles discussed, but in a manner that I find very subjective and often dripping with hubris. I have a feeling that 20 years from now Josh would be able to write this book in a way that would make an extremely useful primer on learning. This book feels like an autobiography of young man who is fascinated by his own intellect, a young man who does not realise that what is happening in his mind and body is not quite so fascinating to everyone else. This is by no means a manual, textbook or primer on learning. On any given page in this book you will find the word \\" I \\" used about 10 - 20 times. Sometimes Josh's secret to learning something is to spend and an entire year focusing one one specific techinque or tactic, very impressive in terms of his dedication, but certainly not a new or helpful approach to the reader. I did take notes while reading and I did come up with some valuable principles, but they are not really new, just stated in a new way. If you don't like endless descriptions of body movement in Push Hands matches, you will really hate the last 40% of this book. All in all, some valuable points can be extracted, but not without wading through a lot of autobiographical dross. If you are intersted in Josh's life experiences, and his experiences with introspection, then this is for you.

B005G4YE1G|5.0|To put it bluntly I am not a fan of Cecilia Bartoli... her brand of breathy vocalism, and aspirated machine gun delivery of coloratura (and especially in Rossini) is frankly quite the turn-off.  However, Ms. Bartoli is on her best behavior here and delivers a captivating portrayal of the flighty Fiorilla.  My only complaint concerns the fact that I wish that the voice had more of a soprano sound to it... Still, she encompasses the entire range with ease and this includes the second stanza of her final cabaletta which is given in Rossini's stratospheric revised version.  Sumi Jo in the recording with Neville Marriner sings the same variation, but in her case the voice is a half size to small and undernourished for the part.  Given the difference between the two, I would opt for Bartoli.  Still, the perfect voice for the role was Maria Callas.  However, her recording is heavily cut and in the 1950's Fiorilla's second act aria was not an integral part of the score.  Only latter did musicologists \\"discover\\" the piece and return it to its rightful place.  The rest of the cast is also up to the task and the conducting of Riccardo Chailly has improved since he first recorded the opera in the early 1980's for CBS/Sony. The digital sound is smooth and rich, yet lifelike.<br /><br />Incidentally, there are some textual variations among the various recordings of this piece.  Geronio's first act aria, the aria for Albazar, and the Finale of the second act are not by Rossini... Rossini subsequently removed the first two compositions from the score and greatly shortened the Finale.  Most modern recordings feature all three of these compositions... and that includes the long version of the final number.  What is unique about the recording at hand is that it also includes an aria for Geronio in the second act that Rossini included as compensation for the loss of his aria in the first act.  Why this aria is not performed more frequently is a mystery, as it is quite a tour du force and definitely one of the most animated and delightful buffo arias that Rossini ever composed.  If you are not familiar with the piece this recording is probably the only way that you will be able to experience it... and it alone is almost worth the price of admission.  For the record, Marriner exclusively incorporates an extra tenor aria for Narciso that is not included in this recording, but does not perform the aria for Albazar.  Being a man of the theater, Rossini often revised his scores to suite different casts and situations.<br /><br />For the general Rossini collector this recording is more than satisfactory.  The Naxos version is also acceptable, and especially given its budget price.  For the more advanced collector, I would get the Callas recording as a supplement... she was unique... and it is a pity that modern scholarship did not allow her to be familiar with the complete score.  One can only imagine how Callas would have dealt with that big aria in the second act!  Still, Bartoli is quite impressive in the piece and as implied above performs a composite version of Rossini's original and revised versions... and unless a modern day Callas appears to perform such a feat... this is currently as good as it is ever going to get.<br /><br />Incidentally, the set is reissued without notes and libretto, but one is given access to a libretto on-line.  Fortunately a synopsis is included.ely one of the most animated and delightful buffo arias that Rossini ever composed.

Still, Bartoli is quite impressive in the piece and as implied above performs a composite version of Rossini's original and revised versions... and unless a modern day Callas appears to perform such a feat... this is currently as good as it is ever going to get.  Incidentally, the set is reissued without notes and libretto, but one is given access to a libretto on-line.  Fortunately a synopsis is included.

0525478817|5.0|I read this book just a few days ago and loved every minute of it. When I tell people that I cried (a lot) they automatically decide that they don't want to read it. But it's because they don't understand why I cried. This book is perfect. And complete. And once you come to terms with the lives of the characters in The Fault in Our Stars, it's hard not to become emotionally involved. Hazel is a bright young woman whose inner dialogue makes Bella Swan look like a fifth grade drop out.  This book has made me think about death in a way that I never have before, and I can't wait to share it with friends. Don't be afraid of the sadness found in the book. To quote Doctor Who, \\"Every life is a pile of good things and bad things... The good things don't always soften the bad things, but vice versa, the bad things don't necessarily spoil the good things, and make them unimportant.\\"

B006UG90RM|5.0|A Different Kind of Truth is 28 years in the making, and while many people seem to take issue with the usage of older ideas and songs, I see it no different than any other Van Halen album for multiple reasons:  1) Van Halen has ALWAYS turned cast-off ideas into songs. Don't believe me? Check out \\"Voodoo Queen\\"...Sounds an awful lot like \\"Mean Street\\", doesn't it? What about \\"Last Night\\"? Call me crazy, but I believe that's \\"Hang 'Em High\\". The list goes on and on, but this leads me to our next point.  2) If it was unreleased before A Different Kind of Truth, this makes it the first official release...which declares it in all possible ways \\"new\\". If you've heard it, it's because somebody had the old tapes and put it out there...not because the band decided to show you all of their hidden gems.  With that out of the way, let's get to the best rock album of 2012 GUARAN-DAMN-TEED:  Folks, there isn't a bad song on the entire album. Not a true clunker, at least. High points for me: As Is, Honeybabysweetiedoll, Blood and Fire and You and Your Blues. Low points: Tattoo (and even that is a better song than most I have heard recently).  Can't miss on this one, no matter which era of Van Halen you liked. Easiest 5 star rating I've ever had to give. They're back.

0743298039|4.0|I haven't finished \\"The Thirteenth Tale\\" yet, so I may find a unique story in it.  I am reading it for my book club and they usually pick rather unusual, interesting stories for us to read.  It is sponsored by the Women's Studies program at the university and so most of our books center around the theme of lives for women.  This book so far seems mostly about men.  While I love the atmosphere and the local dialect, I am waiting to see what happens in the story.  I expect to be pleasantly surprised and am looking forward to finishing it!

B0030DBGXY|5.0|I do not own this San Mai III version, but the carbon V version no longer in production so I will speak only to the functionality of the knife. This is the best \\"do everything\\" knife I have ever had. I have my Recon Scout for most everything, but I carry this knife, scout style, and I forget it is there all the time. This knife is wonderful to have when you just need that smaller but extremely capable blade, and at 3/16 inch thick, it is substantial in its stoutness. Of course a bug out blade should be 7.5 inches to 9 inches in length and of course it should always be 1/4 inches thick or better ( as some Kabar are and the Recon Scout at 5/16 inch thick) but this knife is a great knife to have as a back up redundancy to that knife. And if this what you have when the time comes, you know you are in good hands.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|I received 21 as a gift.  I loved every song on it.  I love to sing the background with Rolling in the Deep.  On the 2012 Grammy's they had 4 lovely ladies doing the background.  I can't stop singing along with Someone Like You.  An album passes the classic test when the unknown songs are great.  And I'm a senior citizen.
B0025UHKNS|4.0|If this watch didn't have the weird bezel, I would give it 5 stars.  I bought this watch, even after reading other reviews that dogged the bezel, because of the price.  I paid about 160.00 for the watch, and it is worth it.  I really like the multiple training screens so you can choose what data fields you like grouped together - like pace, heart rate, distance or time, average pace, elevation.  You need to read the manual to make the most of all of the features.  One feature I plan to use soon is the virtual training partner.  I plan to do a 10K, set my pace for my virtual partner, and my watch will tell me how far ahead or behind I am.  I have been training with the watch for about 2 months now and I am pretty used to the bezel.  At first, I thought I might have to send the watch back, but I'm glad I didn't.  You must lock the bezel when you are running or you risk it changing screens on you from a drop of sweat or inadvertant tap.  I also have to say I would never wear this watch for anything other than training because it looks so ridiculous on my small wrist - but that's probably the case with any GPS watch.  I will say my husbands forerunner 110 doesn't look as silly, but his watch doesn't have all the features or the HR monitor.  All in all, great watch and great price.

B002VKE1K2|4.0|The first installement of the current Paranormal trilogy..this is where it all began. In reality, part 2 is actually taking place in the world of the film roughly at the same time this was being 'documented', so the two films do coincide nicely with each other. It seems this first offering is the one that is getting the harshest criticsm. It is indeed low budget, using no name actors who I felt gave a realistic performance as they interact naturally as a real couple would. Basically, a young 20 something couple decides to co-habitate with the female bringing in her long standing issue to the house: she has been terrorized by a molevalant spirit since childhood, but not on a constant level. Her boyfriend isn't convinced of what is happening and ends up instigating  the spirit, after being warned by an expert in paranormal disturbances to never antagonize or challenge the demon.  The entire movie is actually filmed in the house and especially for a good 30 minutes into the film, is pretty slow moving. In order to capture the disturbances, the young man rigs a stationary video camera in the bedroom to capture any evidence of the 'paranormal activity'. This is definitely a 'what you don't see is what you get' kind of fright so it's your imagination at work here providing the real chills of the film. I am a lover of classic horror and never one to be 'frightened' from graphic violence carried out by rediculous, larger than life monsters. True horror for me has been about less being more. When it comes to the supernatural, any little bump in the night is what can send a chill down your spine and that is exactly what you get here. Thumps, lights turning on and off, shadowy figures, doors slamming shut, chandeliers and plant leaves moving to inconceivable breezes, etc. It's all great fun really!  This is definitely the type of movie that will stay with you for days after viewing. Mind you, you must have an open mind and have a respect and belief in the supernatural to really appreciate what the film makers tryed doing here, otherwise, you will either laugh this one off or fall asleep before the ending...and the ending trully did give a jolt of genuine fright. The challenge here as a home viewer is to watch this one alone, in the dark, and I guarantee you will be flicking the light on and looking over your shoulder. If you do watch this with someone else, keep it quiet, and focus in on the 'video camera' scenes at night in the bedroom. Your eyes will constantly be all over the room, waiting and looking for something to happen..when sometimes it's just a noise. And sometimes, that is all it takes to get the chills.
B005OP71GC|5.0|This is, by far, one of the best shows on TV I've seen in a long, long time.  The acting is superb....the story line is riveting, packed full with unpredictable surprise moments in nearly every episode.  I agree with some of the other reviewers....you need to see this from the beginning or it may be confusing. You will want to record it so you can watch each episode over at least a couple of times. :-)  Each time you re-watch it... you discover little bits of information you missed! The writing is excellent...it can take you deep and be very thought provoking at times....but, also light and witty...and everything in between. If you're looking for a TV experience that will keep you awake and riveted to the screen...this is it!
6303431038|5.0|Achtung: zweiseitige DVD 9 - nicht zu empfehlen, aber, dafür eben auch ...   ... die - eindeutig !? - \\"bessere\\" Darstellung der realen (Film) \\"Geschichte\\".  Dabei, allerdings mit einigen (wenigen) Einschränkungen, was aber nicht den Film selbst bzw. die eigentliche Haupthandlung betrifft, sondern diese seltsame DVD - Spezifikation.  Wer hatte den hier unter den Lizenz - Inhabern die grandiose Idee, ausgerechnet dieses Meisterwerk auf eine DVD 9, oder anders gesagt, - zweiseitige Dual Layer Rohling (wenn schon aufstehen und wechseln mitten im Film, dann doch wenigstens mit mehreren, seperaten Scheiben wie z.B. bei der Extended Version von \\"Herr der Ringe\\" usw. usf.) zu pressen !?  Womit Fingerabdrücke oder (im Fall von ausleihen / verborgen) gleich noch \\"vorzeitig fehlerhaft abspielbare\\" Beschädigungen unweigerlich auftreten können, oder ist das etwa bereits so (ein)kalkuliert worden !?  Ansonsten ist diese \\"Version\\" hier mit Produzent/Darsteller Kevin Costner - verglichen jedenfalls zu der \\"Tobstone - Fassung\\" mit Kurt Russell - 100 x besser.  Allerdings vorwiegend, weil hier bedeutend ausführlicher auf die historischen Gegebenheiten (Earp's Werdegang, das zeigen seiner ganzen Familie usw., inclusive der aufgezeichneten, bekannten Fakten) eingegangen wird.  Und auch, weil Dennis Quaid als John \\"Doc\\" Holliday - Darsteller auch \\"realistischer\\" sowie glaubhafter \\"ankommt\\" als ein - damals - noch jüngerer (und somit auch im Film dann übertrieben jugendlich wirkender) Val Kilmer.  Solche historischen (oder auch nur komplett rein fiktive) Personen darzustellen, ist ja sowieso immer extrem schwierig für jeden Schauspieler und bisher auch nur ganz wenigen - extrem glaubhaft wie überzeugend - gelungen (John Wayne bei \\"the Shootist - der letzte Scharfschütze\\" oder Steve McQueen bei \\"ich, Tom Horn\\" zum Beispiel).  Oft standen die Akteure sogar in diesen - dh. ihren letzten - Rollen selbst bereits \\"mit einem Bein in Grab\\". Und konnten daher meißtens auch nicht Annerkennung(en) für ihre abgelieferten Leistungen erfahren.  Somit großes Lob an den Schauspieler Dennis Quaid für seine gezeigte Leistung. Obwohl der \\"echte\\" Holliday auch mit gerade einmal 36 Jahren verstarb.  Wie auch immer, - zur jedem (ja doch) dann auch noch wenigstens in groben Zügen bekannten \\"Story\\" bzw. der geschichtlichen Vorlage braucht bestimmt nicht viel gesagt werden.  Kann aber dennoch mal versuchen, etwas zu dieser filmischen Umsetzung hier zu schildern und hinzufügendes zu kommentieren.  Zur Handlung: Costner's \\"Version\\" beginnt zunächst mit der Kindheit und Darstellungen der frühen Jugendjahren von Wyatt Earp ...   ... und lässt sich dabei auch erstmal - fast - geschlagene 1, 5 Stunden Zeit damit, bis er zu den Szenen kommt, die verglichen dazu, bei \\"Tombstone\\" den Anfang bildeten.  Inzwischen \\"ist\\" das Jahr 1881, Ort, - im Mittelwesten der USA, der frühere Glücksritter, Kopfgeldjäger und Gesetzeshüter Marschall Wyatt Earp kommt zunächst mit 2 Brüdern und ihren beiden Frauen in die zu dieser Zeit aufblühende Stadt Tombstone (Arizona), - um sich dort endlich niederzulassen und (wie so viele andere) seinen \\"amerikanischen Traum (Freiheit, Wohlstand und das Streben nach Glück) wahrzunehmen.  Und sonst auch - dh. von ihm geplant - nur noch in Ruhe abgeschieden von den aufregenden, lebensgefährlichen Jahren davor zu leben.  - SCHNITT - hier (bzw. etwas weiter davor) muß diese DVD - Auflage dann umgedreht werden.  Edit: Nachtrag, - der Film ist auf DVD nur als zweiseitige DVD - 9 in Deutschland zu bekommen.  Etwa gleichzeitig zieht es auch seinen guten alten Bekannten, - den Spieler ,Revolverhelden und ehemaligen Zahnarzt John \\"Doc\\" Holliday ebenfalls in diese Gegend. In der Hoffnung (und vermutl. auf ärztl. Rat ), das trockene Klima dort würde seine \\"Schwindsucht\\" (Tuberkulose) etwas erträglich für ihn machen. Eventuell auch, mit dem baldigen Tod bereits vor Augen, um zuvor etwas schneller durch ein grandioses Duell \\"berühmter\\" zu sterben !?  , - Er ist jedenfalls der einzige im Film, der z.B. ganz ruhig dasitzt, wenn \\"Blei fliegt\\". Was dem Film zuweilen auch eine entsprechend komödiantische Note gibt. Sonst aber wirken alle Darsteller und ebenfalls die ganze Inszenierung hier bedeutend authentischer, \\"ernsthafter\\" und durchgehend \\"bei der Sache\\". Und spielen - dh. jeder für sich - ihre Rollen auch gewohnt gut bzw. überzeugend , -  Alles weitere darauf vollzieht sich allerdings trotzdem eher nachteilig für beide.  Und natürlich auch nur allzu vorhersehbar wie erwartungsgemäß, - so das sie auf Grund unglücklicher Umstände, ihrem \\"Ruf\\", sowie Mißverständnissen bald mit Banden von \\"Cowboys\\" (dh. einer lose hirarchisch aufgebaute Organisation bzw. eine Art frühe Form des organisierten Verbrechens), - die sich untereinander mit roten Bauchschärpen kennzeichnen, später immer weiter aneinander geraten.  Bis es dann zur bekannten Schießerei zwischen den Earp's und Holliday auf der einen und den Clanton's und Mc Laury's auf der anderen Seite kommt (das bekannte Duell am Ok Corral).  Mehr braucht wschl. - bzw. soll bis hier nicht verraten werden. Auch um jenen, die den Film noch nicht gesehen haben, nicht jeden \\"Anreiz\\" gleich zu schmälern. Bleibt also nur noch die Frage offen, wie dann alles filmisch umgesetzt und (verglichen zu \\"schwarz - weiß\\" Klischee's anderer Filme dieser Art) auch \\"neu\\" abgedreht wurde !?  Auf jedem Fall überaus \\"zutreffend\\" ! Mit den üblichen, opulenten Bildern und Landschaftsaufnahmen und einem dazu - nicht negativ - dröhnenden Soundtrack. Auch die (dh. was den Ton betrifft) \\"Effekte\\" sind gelungen.  Man hört mit der entsprechenden Dolby - Surround Anlage auch viele bis dahin \\"übersehene\\" Nebengeräusche.  Und auch optisch - Bild - ist ebenfalls alles leicht staubig oder etwas schmuddelig (Requisiten, Hintergründe usw.) gehalten worden.  So das es dabei nun auch für die reinen Gelegenheitszuschauer hier wirklich mal weniger im großen und ganzen zu kritisieren gibt.  Allerdings, - werden auch hier gegen Ende (nach dem berühmt - berüchtigten Duell am Ok Corrall und der darauf folgenden \\"Rache des Gesetzes\\" bzw. dem feigen Mord an Earp's Bruder Morgan, wodurch alles erst weiter eskaliert) der Rest, das weitere Leben der dargestellten Figuren leider ebenso nur reichlich lapidar ...   ... wie eben z.B. \\"Doc\\" Holliday's Tod usw. dann lediglich mit \\"Schautafeln\\" bzw. in einer schnell scrollender Laufschrift abgehandelt.  Was auch die wenigen, - als Bonusmaterial beigefügten entfallenen Szenen nicht weiter ergänzen.  So das auch hier der Eindruck entsteht, das Budget wurde vorwiegend für die horrenden Gagen der \\"namenhafteren\\" Darsteller verwendet, - anstatt nun wirklich auch die \\"ganze\\" Geschichte zu zeigen !?  Die \\"Tombstone - Version\\" hingegen befasst sich hier wiederum etwas näher mit diesen Details ...   ... bleibt also nur für die meißten Western - Fans übrig, um die vollständige Geschichte gesehen zu haben: preisgünstig beide (!) Filme seperat kaufen oder auch wenigstens auszuleihen und anzuschauen.  Kauf, - Ausleihtip (kaufen oder lieber warten auf eine weitere DVD - Auflage)  Edit 2: Nachtrag vom 13.02.12, siehe unten, es gibt sie, aber nur auf VHS bzw. LD.   - / -  Auch von diesem Film existiert, - siehe dazu nun \\"Waterworld\\" ... (leider nicht bei uns, nur als NTSC - VHS Tape in den USA) bzw. existierte mal eine 19 Min, 35 Sekunden (NTSC) längere Special Expanded Edition als Laserdisc.  Lauflänge der - so auch bei uns, hierzulande bekannten - Kinofassung: 3 Stunden, 2 Minuten, 43 Sekunden (2, 58, 40 - ohne Abspann), PAL, - Lauflänge der Expanded Edition: 3 Stunden, 32 Minuten, 1 Sekunde (3, 27, 50 - ohne Abspann), NTSC  Bebilderten Schnittbericht bitte anschauen, interessant für jeden, der Fan dieses Western ist und dann auch mal gerne sehen möchte, was ihm bisher alles vorenthalten wurde ...  Diese Verfilmung des ereignisreichen Lebens der Westernlegende Wyatt Earp war seinerzeit ein Wunschprojekt von Kevin Costner selbst.  Mit einem von Dan Gordon geschriebenem Script, welches für eine sechsstündige TV - Miniserie ausgelegt war, wurde er beim späteren Regisseur Lawrence Kasdan vorstellig, mit dem er schon bei dem Western \\"Silverado\\" zusammengearbeitet hatte.  Der sagte unter der Bedingung zu, das Drehbuch für einen ca. dreistündigen Kinofilm umschreiben und dabei einiges von dem Material von Gordon verwenden zu dürfen. Die erste fertige Schnittfassung war rund 3 Stunden 50 Minuten lang.  Weil es aber in den 90er Jahren schwer genug war, ein geduldiges Kinopublikum für einen Western zu finden - und, erst recht noch für einen, in dem der \\"Held\\" der Geschichte nur schwer als Identifikationsfigur angesehen werden konnte - schnitt Kasdan selbst zunächst 20 Minuten an Szenenmaterial, welches in keinster Weise der Fortführung der Geschichte diente oder schlicht nicht gut genug war, aus dieser Fassung heraus.  Die dabei entstandene, 3, 5 stündige Version ist jene, die in der Special Expanded Edition - Laserdisc Box enthalten und Lawrence Kasdans' persönliche Wunschfassung ist.  Für das entsprechende Kinorelease entfernte Kasdan allerdings sicherheitshalber noch ein gutes Dutzend weitere Szenen aus dieser Fassung, die er zwar gerne mit im Streifen gesehen hätte, aber ebenfalls nicht zwingend für das Verständnis der Geschichte notwendig waren, um die Lauflänge noch \\"kinotauglicher\\" zu gestalten.  Diese wurde dann ihrerseits zu der heute allseits bekannten Kinofassung.
B005I6EVUG|5.0|I love it.  Excellent quality, really attractive, easy to handle.  I carry my Kindle everywhere and never have to worry about it being damaged.
B005LAIIS0|5.0|I enjoyed the movie. Nonstop action. One survival decision after another. Liam Neeson at his quick-thinking tough guy best. The wolves were big, mean and bad just like in Red R. Hood.  Plenty of profound philosophy. An emotional roller coaster. And the cinematography was superb. You have the snowy northern wilderness right in front of you on the big screen.  The small band who took on both beasts and elements proved how strong and resilient people can be.
0385534639|5.0|What a wonderful escape!  I simply adore books that you can get lost in.  I received this book as a gift and loved it.  The author is a very visual writer in my opinion.  Instead of reading words on a page you are simply seeing the world she is creating.  I will certainly be buying her next creation.  A few notes about the book in my humble opinion, it started off a little slow for me.  However the author did a wonderful job establishing this beautiful world in perfect detail.  There is a wide range of characters and the timeline gets a little confusing but even with that being said it was well worth it. The book certainly picked up major steam.  It captivated me to the point that I could not put it down.  While I enjoyed the build and the tension with Celia and Marco I still would have loved more interaction and detail between them.  It kept me wishing for more and kept the pages turning for me till the wee hours of the morning.

B005KJJ4F8|5.0|Don't be lulled into thinking that this is simply a retelling of the Cinderella story.  Yes, the threads are there:  two step-sisters, wicked step-mother, a prince.  But how those characters fit and relate are no match for the old fairytale in this first book of the Lunar Chronicles.  I hesitate to call this sci-fi as I don't want to discourage those who aren't fans of the genre from reading this novel, but with Cinder as cyborg with an adroid best friend, for a start, I can't reasonably say it's not.  It is not, however, otherworldy and I really encourage folks normally put off by the \\"sci-fi\\" label to try it.  I found myself wondering how the author was going to pull something off only to be surprised and delighted at her imagination.  The threads of reality are strong here (bad things happen and life must go on) and the writing is solid.  The only thing that frustrates me is how long I'll have to wait for the sequel!
B006UG90RM|5.0|For those who were hoping that Wolf wouldn't shine, you will be sorely disappointed.  I have enjoyed this CD from beginning to end and will be doing so for a long while.

Alex plays like a MACHINE even to this day, David hasn't changed a bit, and Eddie.....well, he is playing better than ever.  You can feel the energy from these guys having the time of their lives!  (Which is typical given the chemistry of this team.)  This morning, traffic was at it's worst.  Me? I was having FUN!!!!  Best. Commute. Ever!
B003K16P3M|5.0|I absolutely loved this book.  The heroine and the writing are both strong.  The plot provides enough unexpected twists and turns to keep you guessing without being frustrating.  The characters are lovable (or hatable, as needed) and the author does a fantastic job of immersing the reader into this world.  The fact that the main character is a strong female makes the book that much better.
B004LWZW7E|2.0|In Time is a complete waste of time.  The acting is horrible and the story line is flat out dumb.  The best part of the movie was seeing that Johnny Galecki from Big Bang Theory can do something other than play a nerdy PhD.

B003ZSJ212|5.0|There is a problem in star wars fandom (or hardcore fandom in most cases) basically called \\"prequel/lucas haters\\" or \\"fanboys\\" it feeds itself by perpetuating the elitist idea that basically half of the whole thing that these so-called fans claim to like is bad and should be boycotted and constantly attacked. It is made up of a lot less actual fans than they would like to have you believe and it has become something of a forced meme in the star wars fan community. DO NOT BE FOOLED BY THESE INDIVIDUALS IF YOU ARE AT ALL NEW TO STAR WARS!<br /><br />They spend ridiculous amounts of time and energy creating all out manifestos to defend their tired argument that (basically) every star wars film besides the very first two made is somehow/someway bad and wrong and unholy. This small amount of hard core fans is primarily made up of Gen X'ers who have a sad sense of ownership over what they call \\"their movies\\" and pretentious college age hipsters/self proclaimed film experts who enjoy the thrill of being a part of something (in this case an anti-star wars complex) and getting to feel smart around other people by \\"letting them in on the secret\\" that anyone who enjoys star wars as a saga is foolish and somehow \\"buying into\\" some kind of money scheme by the creator George Lucas who in reality is a hippy philanthropist who has donated more than half his money to charity, education and liberal causes while putting the other half of his money back into the film industry by creating many innovations and trends which go on to be used by almost every other filmmaker in hollywood.<br /><br />These fanboys (or whatever you wish to call them) have been so obsessive and persistent since around 1999 that a lot of reviewers and bloggers for certain websites have fed into it in order to gain hits for their websites and blow up their comment sections. Since the Saga as a whole has been released on blu-ray this trend has finally started to die down because of the fact that the Saga box set sold incredibly well (over one million copy's the first week not counting x-mas sales) despite boycott attempts by the fanboys which were embarrassingly proven by this fact to be in the extreme minority.<br /><br />These people (and the Trolls who help them) will use a large (and tellingly always different) variety of arguments and basically propaganda to get you to join in with them. They look at people just like you who are new to star wars as practice for them to hone their skills in converting people almost like some kind of cult or gang rather. DO NOT TAKE THEM SERIOUSLY!<br />The intended way to watch the Star Wars Saga is in numerical order, 1-2-3-4-5-6.<br /><br />You will find that star wars is a visually and artistically beautiful and cleverly crafted fantasy series. Something that is as timeless and family friendly as The Wizard of Oz. But if you buy into the foolish prequel hate all you will be is another angry, elitist fanboy with a pretentious vendetta. I know this may all sound silly and believe me it is but I am dead serious when I tell you that you have been warned.(over one million copy's the first week not counting x-mas sales) despite boycott attempts by the fanboys which were embarrassingly proven by this fact to be in the extreme minority.

B006HL9G10|2.0|I love the timers and the sounds in this app. When I got it I wanted to set a short soft timer at 5 second intervals, a 1 minute timer to measuring progress, and a timer at the end to mark completion. This is very easy and intuitive to set up. The problem on the Kindle Fire is before every sound is played the audio circuit is turned on resulting in an audible \\"pop\\". My nice wood block sound every five seconds is preceded by this really irritating \\"pop\\". Irritation is not compatible with meditation. Completing apps like \\"At Ease\\" run a continuous sound track and don't suffer from this problem. I know this is one small blemish on an otherwise fine program, but I find it to be a show stopper. If the developers figure a way around this issue I'll amend this review.

B006UG90RM|5.0|What a great record!  This new album they just put out is OFF THE HOOK!!  It may be the best album they have EVER done (and that's saying something).....it's that well put together and really hard driving rock and roll...  Eddie Van Halen in on fire with the guitar work on this album....  Roth does a really good job, given his vocal limitations, and just keeps the thing cooking along with the band.  If you were ever a fan, you will be blown away and absolutely love it - start to finish - WHOA!!!!!!  I didn't think DLR and EVH and the boys still had it in them....it's like it could have been sides 3 and 4 of a Fair Warning \\"double album\\" from 1981 and been Van Halen's own \\"Physical Graffiti\\".....  WOW - OUTSTANDING - What an unexpected surprise!
B0059XTTW8|3.0|It's a sad day when the film you waited for all year doesn't live up to your expectations. That's not to say that Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy is a bad film. It's a solid film with great acting all around, particularly by John Hurt, Gary Oldman, and Tom Hardy. The writing is excellent too. And the on-screen tension is sometimes remarkable. But overall, this is a \\"who's the mole?\\" spy thriller with more similarities to a game of Clue than than the Jean-Pierre Melville style movie it wants to be. The problem is that director Thomas Alfredson only partially carries the audience's interest. At times the movie moves so slowly, you think it might stop churning out images. This is coming from one of those annoying moviegoers, who not only can sit through any film, but actually likes long, drawn-out scenes.  For the quickly distracted, think carefully before watching this. Yes, Tinker, Tailor has moments of riveting action and tense drama, but you will have to work for them. For those who like anti-Hollywood authenticity, Tinker, Tailor also has some powerful quiet scenes, but too often, those same kinds of scenes manage to miss the life-dense subtlety Alfredson so badly wants them to convey. Instead, they feel as though if you flicked them, you would only hear a deep, dull thud. Think about it.

Various measures are taken to resolve the issue -- all failing. Finally a bold plan is hatched with Perot offering the funds and a team headed by a retired military colonel to physically extract the EDS employees.

6305511055|2.0|So many clunkers and \\"no way he would have done something that stupid.\\"  Things you shouldn't do when running from the bad guys- leave by the same front door they came through, meet them in an alley, alone!, call them from your girlfriends (it's a stretch) house, drive your new girlfriend's car and be sure to jump into it in full site of bad guy chasing you with gun.  I remembered liking this movie, opener is shocking, and love max von sydow but I must have been very young and bowled over by Robert Redford's shining blonde hair (  and extremely tight pants!).  Love the grainy look of these older movies.  Much better than the polished films now.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|This is the first movie that seemed to flow better than the others. I own all the others! It is educational by sharing accurate statistics about the importance of a father's role and that father's should step up. It should not take a tragic accident for fathers to do that. It is also entertaining! The humor makes me laugh every time. I love the one scene in the police car with Xavier! If that does not make you laugh perhaps you have misplaced your funny bone! I recommend it to everyone even if your not a believer!

159562015X|4.0|I have studied temperament assessments for many years and I can say that this is different than others.  If you really want to discover some strengths then this book holds some information than could be helpful in learning your 5 main strengths.  That being said, I have to say that the questions asked in the strengthfinders assesmment were a bit leading and I only thought 4 of the 5 strengths assigned to me were accurate.  Although this book is interesting and provides some insight that differs from other  temperament/personality studies, I can't say it would be my first choice if I was new to these kinds of assessments.  I imagine this is due in large part to my familiarity with other assessments.  Were I to make a recommendation to a friend or co-worker, I would advise them to start with something different.  Once the assessment is taken the inormation in the book is pretty much just a repeat of what you recieve from the online exam.  Basically, you are buying the book to get the code to take the assessment to determine your top five strengths and get info about those strengths. If you want to find out anything more than your top five then you would have to pay more.  There are definitely other books and asessments that are just as helpful and give much more detail for less money.  So why four stars?  It's not a bad book and discovering your strengths can be encouraging for those who have not extensively studied temperament info.  I consider any infomation you can get to improve yourself to be a good buy.

1250006341|5.0|A wonderful book with marvelous photos and script; a superlative series of what once was. A warning that the U.S. is headed in this direction as the gap between the rich and poor in this country widens inexorably and tragically.  This book also includes some excellent ideas re. makeup worn by the female characters: One excellent point being that foundation is only necessary on parts of the face--not the whole face like a mask! Wish they'd also mentioned how to keep copper pots and pans, etc. so beautifully shiny.  The hardcover book is a keeper, and I recommend it highly.
B00003CXCD|5.0|How do you not fall in love with Audrey Hepburn from jump? Then 24 years old, she landed her first major role in ROMAN HOLIDAY, a timeless picture which would set the tone for the rest of Audrey Hepburn's film career. Gamine and classy and trend-setting and luminous Audrey Hepburn. Not that Gregory Peck or Eddie Albert are exactly scrapes off the bottom of your shoe, mind you. Peck and Albert round out a pitch-perfect cast.<br /><br />Expectations on them being set on such lofty standards, royals can't be blamed for acting out every now and then. Supervised by a coterie of rigid official aides, shackled to an endless routine of ever proper decorum at public functions, it's no wonder that young Ann (Hepburn), modern-day crown princess to some mythical kingdom, finally snaps and runs away during a good will tour of Rome (but not before averting a shoe disaster at a royal reception). Encountering broke American journalist Joe Bradley (Peck) while in a vulnerable state - she was actually only terribly sleepy although he thought her inebriated - Princess Ann passes herself off as \\"Anya Smith.\\"<br /><br />This being the sort of picture in which the crusading reporter is featured as a stand-up guy, Bradley gallantly (okay, reluctantly) allows her the use of his bed. But Bradley catches wise to her true identity, and he's soon promising his incredulous editor an earthshaking scoop. On the pretense of showing the princess the sights of the Eternal City, he latches on to her. He manages to coax his photographer pal Irving (Eddie Albert) to tag along and snap them pretty pics. Eddie Albert, by the way, is marvelously easy-going and effortlessly funny here. It's maybe my favorite performance of his. He's soon calling Anya Smith \\"Smitty.\\"<br /><br />There's something uncalculated and tender and so wistful about this runaway princess fable, and one can't dismiss the warm, protective stance Gregory Peck's character eventually assumes over the princess, which I think is colored by his demeanor towards Hepburn in real life. Halfway thru the shooting of this film, Peck - whose contract entitled him to solo star billing - called for Hepburn's name to share lead credits with him.<br /><br />In Rome, to her endless delight, \\"Anya Smith\\" proceeds to fall into one scrape after another. She nearly crashes a moped. While eluding her government's agents who are turning over every rock looking for her, she gets involved in a bar brawl and runs afoul of the local polizia. She gets a haircut. She falls in love. Would all burdened royals have such freedom, however fleeting. Princess Ann, recognizing her responsibilities to her kingdom, eventually returns to her shackles. But she'll always have Rome and her secret memories of an enchanting respite and a star-crossed romance.<br /><br />Hollywood lore tells of Hepburn's auditioning for this role, and how after her subdued screen test, the cameraman kept the film rolling. In the ensuing relaxed conversation with director William Wyler, Hepburn's natural charm and bearing bubbled up. Wyler was so taken with her then that he cast her in the part. Hepburn was an instant sensation, getting nominated and then walking away with the 1953 Academy Award for Best Actress.<br /><br />ROMAN HOLIDAY, to me, is a perfect film. Wyler takes full advantage of the sights of Rome, capturing the flavor and bustle of the Eternal City and making it into a secondary character. The perfectly-paced narrative elicits from its audience emotions ranging from wild amusement to deep affection to melancholia. Peck and Hepburn are flawless. Perhaps nothing encapsulates their natural synergy better than the scene at the Mouth of Truth (which Peck improvised). And the final sequence - in which Princess Ann gravely receives the press (including one Joe Bradley) - makes for one of the most unforgettable, most romantic moments in film history. Hepburn has made so many watchable films, but while she would go on to match her performance in ROMAN HOLIDAY, in my opinion, she would never exceed it. I was never so in love with her than when she was Princess Ann, so full of grace.OLIDAY, in my opinion, she would never exceed it. I was never so in love with her than when she was Princess Ann, so full of grace.
B005LAIGOQ|4.0|*A Brief Note to Readers: If you find this review \\"not helpful\\", please take a moment to tell me why in the comment section. Thank you.*<br /><br />Stories about vengeful spirits never fail to fascinate, and during one of the bleakest months of the year, the release of \\"The Woman In Black\\" is welcome entertainment for a bored and mostly housebound populace.  Adapted from a horror fiction novel originally published in 1983, author Susan Hill's tale comes to life on screen, raising hairs on the backs of audiences' necks in new and disturbing ways.<br /><br />Arthur Kipps is a sad man.  Even his four-year old son Joseph draws pictures of him with frowns.  His melancholy stems from the loss of his wife Stella, the joy of their son's birth forever marred by her death after a difficult labor and delivery.  So when the law firm under which he is employed assigns him to the estate of one Alice Drablow, it is a convenient distraction and a solution to recent financial troubles.  Surmising he can put her affairs in order in just a few days time, he surpasses his deadline after encountering horrendous piles of disorganized papers as well as strange sounds and voices within Eel Marsh House, Drablow's former home.  Things quickly go from bad to worse when Arthur begins seeing a woman in a black dress in the house and on the grounds, the deaths of several children coinciding with her appearances. Faced with angry, superstitious townspeople and an unraveling mystery, Arthur's problems, once inconsequential, become the stuff of nightmares.<br /><br />\\"The Woman In Black\\" is, in a word, creepy, director James Watkins achieving the tale's ubiquitous gloom in many ways.  The archaic town that Arthur visits is comprised of dank and mossy stone structures populated by frowning denizens.  Costumes are simple and drab, moors are perpetually misty, the marshland is black and oily, and the film is punctuated by lots of beauteous stills of a roiling gray sea.  Porcelain dolls and tattered antique toys are always good for upping the creep factor and Watkins utilizes them to full effect, their wide glassy eyes engulfing the camera lens, unsettling the viewer with their unblinking and penetrating stares.  The foreboding of Eel Marsh House comes to life, its creaky floorboards, dirty and faded wallpaper, and cobwebs adorning every picture, chandelier and wall sconce sure to thrill fans of Susan Hill's novel.  What will make the biggest impression, of course, is the incarnation of the restless and vengeful spirit of the movie's title, one that slinks through the shadows in the background, whose raspy breaths reverberate through the hallways and rafters, and whose dark silhouette comes skulking (sometimes shrieking) out of the darkness time and time again.<br /><br />With the exception of its star player and fellow Harry Potter alumnus Ciar&aacute;n Hinds, the movie is cast with actors largely unknown to American audiences.  Radcliffe, in his first role since the conclusion of the Harry Potter series, could have been judged on his potential as a leading man but the role of Arthur Kipps doesn't allow him to exhibit his range.  He is instead restricted to long somber gazes and a handful of moments of wide-eyed terror, a performance in favor with the film's ambiance and tempo.  The supporting players are on par with their A-list co-star, Hinds the biggest standout for his affecting portrayal of Sam Daily, a man whose life has been torn apart in more ways than one after the untimely death of his young son Nicolas.<br /><br />As with most films of its ilk, \\"The Woman In Black\\" has its share of scares, the amalgam of music, sound effects, and on-screen action creating moments that make the audience jump out of their seats in fright.  Thankfully Watkins doesn't overdo it, his translation of Hill's tale doing most of the hair-raising work.  It is an admirable adaptation, though I'm sure some readers will take issue with the changes that have been made, the finale inparticular.  If you haven't read Hill's novel (I didn't) and love a good ghost story, it's recommended.  If you have read the book and you often find that adaptations of books you've read don't meet your expectations, you're better off passing this one up or at least waiting until it's available on home video.cular.

B004QOB8SO|5.0|Such was the ego-stroking the cast & creators received for their first series of SHERLOCK, they couldn't help but gain huge confidence as they try to top themselves in Series 2. Steven Moffat always did have roaring self-esteem, and so he and co-creator Mark Gattis shrugged and decided to take on the three most iconic touchstones in the Sherlock Holmes canon. Series 2 is a (mostly) brilliant reworking of, in Moffat's own words, \\"the Hound, the Woman, and the Professor.\\"<br /><br />It was a ba11sy move to reimagine Sherlock Holmes in 21st Century England. That it worked tremendously is due to smart writing and the amazing chemistry between the two leads, Cumberbatch and Freeman. The writers inserted clever touches such as the onscreen texts which reveal Holmes' instantaneous deductions and his ready application of contemporary tools (cell phones, the Internet, etc.) to aid his investigations. In this universe, Holmes attains his clients primarily thru Watson's popular online blog in which the good doctor recounts Holmes' cases. The writers and creators are so cocky nowadays that they don't hesitate to inject broader bits of comedy (an act of heresy were this show not as good). As such we witness fleeting play-on-word references to Holmes' more trivial cases such as \\"The Geek Interpreter\\" and \\"The Speckled Blonde.\\" For whatever reason, I smile whenever the camera pans to Speedy's Sandwich Bar & Cafe, atop of which is where Holmes and Watson share lodgings, very much still 221B Baker Street. At heart, Sherlock Holmes is still very much the cold, calculating machine. But Series 2 aims to poke a hole in that stance.<br /><br />\\"A Scandal in Belgravia\\" picks up where Series 1 left off, a cliffhanger involving Watson strapped onto an explosives vest and a stand-off between Holmes and weird international consulting criminal James Moriarty. This matter is resolved within moments (or, more likely, put on the shelf), with Moriarty casually sauntering off to torment Holmes on a later day. \\"A Scandal in Belgravia\\" is this series' compelling adaptation of \\"A Scandal in Bohemia,\\" the story that introduced the world's most famous femme fatale in literature, the crafty and alluring Irene Adler. In this incarnation, Irene Adler is a dominatrix (someone refers to what she does as \\"recreational scolding\\"; heh). She blackmails her high end clientele with compromising images she stores in her mobile phone. One such victim happens to be closely linked to the royal crown, and so that Internet phenom, Sherlock Holmes, is dragged (clad only in bed sheets) into the affair. I will say that \\"A Scandal in Belgravia\\" is an utter pleasure to watch. For one thing, it delivers two amusing comments about Holmes' trousers.<br /><br />This is the most fleshed-out (in more ways than one) that Irene Adler has ever been portrayed on screen. Lara Pulver is classy and mesmerizing as \\"The Woman,\\" and she creates plenty of sparks with Cumberbatch. Irene Adler certainly gets under Holmes' skin. Holmes eventually takes possession of Irene's all-important cell phone but for most of the episode he's stumped by the access password. The solution, when it finally arrives, drew a big smile from my mug.<br /><br />I wasn't as enamoured of \\"The Hounds of Baskerville,\\" which I thought was the weakest episode, and yet still quite watchable. But, then again, I wasn't that fond of the original story, either, so I do claim some bias. Some of the original plot survives: that of a man in the atmospheric moors being stalked by an infernal hound. But then we eye the forbidding British army compound and the conspiracy theorists, and that's the modern spin in play. If \\"A Scandal in Belgravia\\" introduced Sherlock Holmes to a twisted kind of passion (it's questionable whether it's love he feels for Irene), \\"The Hounds of Baskerville\\" shoved terror directly in his face. It's a bit jarring to see the aloof detective quivering in fright.<br /><br />The deadly mind games between Holmes and Moriarty escalate in the riveting third episode, \\"The Reichenbach Fall.\\" The story opens with Moriarty allowing himself to be captured by the constabulary after three daring simultaneous break-ins. I won't say more except that it's all part of Moriarty's devious plan to get Sherlock Holmes, that this pushes Holmes to the very brink of defeat, that this may be the finest bit of acting I've seen from Martin Freeman (one of cinema's finest reactors), and that Andrew Scott (\\"Moriarty\\") redeems himself from his previous what-the-hell-was-that? appearances. Really, no universe should exist in which Moriarty throws a raspberry.<br /><br />SHERLOCK - THE COMPLETE SERIES TWO comes with 2 discs and the following bonus features (or the Region 2 set does, anyway):<br /><br />- lively audio commentary on \\"A Scandal in Belgravia\\" with co-creators/writers Steven Moffat & Mark Gatiss (who also is rather good as \\"Mycroft Holmes\\"), producer Sue Vertue, Benedict Cumberbatch, and Lara Pulver<br />- audio commentary on \\"Hounds of Baskerville\\" with Moffat, Gatiss, Vertue, and actor Russell Tovey (\\"Henry Knight\\")<br />- \\"Sherlock Uncovered\\" - featurette which offers an overview of the three episodes comprising Series 2 (00:19:06 minutes)ty escalate in the riveting third episode, \\"The Reichenbach Fall.\\" The story opens with Moriarty allowing himself to be captured by the constabulary after three daring simultaneous break-ins.

0307593312|2.0|This is my first time reading anything by Haruki Murakami so I can't compare it to any of his other work. I had a really hard time getting through this book. The plot seemed to go no where and the writing was very tedious. I really wanted to love this book but upon finishing and closing the book, rather than being disappointed that it was over, I was just disappointed that I spent so much time on this. The only reason it gets two stars is that I liked the quality of the book itself (binding, paper, etc).
B006OAB3ME|1.0|Many great songs,  and I suppose they played some role in shaping Sir Paul's style of singing and maybe even writing when he heard them as a kid.  But he should have kept the memories of those songs to himself rather than force us to join him in the shower while he tries to sing them.  It just comes out all wrong.  I would rather go back to singing them (badly) to myself in my own shower.

B0051CSIKQ|5.0|Terrific for a horror film. The characters are not deeply developed but I could relate to each and actually care about them. There is a strong feeling of sincerity and caring and talent to the making of this film. The photography and mood were great, and the feeling about and immersion in backroads America was convincing and even artsy. The script was well-written. The monster/vampires are truly ugly and nasty and predatory/animalistic.  The overall mood was extreme sadness about the death of America, the decay of civil society. It is about the take over by the self-decribed Christian crazies who actually encourage the vampires because they want to rule with their sick values in the post-apocalyptic world. They use the vampires as weapons and even dropped them on cities and Washington to hasten the apocalypse.  That was the theme really. There were symbols of America everywhere, flags and all and it was clear that the great idealistic dreams were gone, dead.  It was difficult to not make comparisons with the present decline of America that the know-nothings seem to actually crave and have been doing things to help along -- as they might say mobilizing and acting to \\"retake it\\" so that they can be free to pursue their self-righteous anger and hatreds -- somehow or another in their minds in the name of Jesus (The Prince of Peace!! -- OMG, they walk among us now!). I can't help but think this was intentional.  WHOA -- I am watching the extras as I type, and they just made it clear that they were indeed affected by our tragic times in the US. So this was a very brave film and will be quite disliked and put down by the hate mongers that have been so riled up these days if they catch the allusions.  I doubt though that the rebs are sufficiently self-reflective to see themselves as destructive hate mongers.  The film is certainly not anti-Christian even though the bad guys, over and above the vampires are some sort aryan self-proclaimed Christian network across the countrythat reminds one of a sort of violence-prone survivalist mentality/society network. So the film makers put in a nun to represent a more sincere model of Christian love and charity. I thought that was a little much at first, but it ended  up working okay. She loses some of her idealism in the course of dealing with the realities of the new order, but at least she has a conscience and does not overdo it.  The extra feature \\"making-of\\" is \\"low density\\" but somehow engaging if you are not in a rush. It is mostly just footage about working out of doors on the shooting and make up etc. It is nicely done and not  saturated by hype or goofing off scenes as so many extra features are. It is slow and not talking heads. And somehow it works, though again, I will warn that it takes its time. I think I enjoyed it for one thing because so much of it was outdoors in \\"real weather\\" which got worked into the film.  I really like extra features when they are well done and give you a feeling for being at the shoots and this one worked for me.

Those of us who love her music, wanted her to come back and grace us with more of her awesome gift.  All of the recordings on this CD are studio recordings, which I prefer over concert performances.  She is the Gold Standard when it comes to female vocal artists.  \\"I'll Always Love You\\", is my absolute favorite of all of her songs.  This song alone is worth the price of this CD.  As sad as I am about her passing, I thank God that she lived, and blessed us with her incredible talent.    I have three grandchildren under the age of six, and I want to expose them to music that is timeless.  Music that transcends generations. I had older siblings who exposed me to artists like Dakota Staton, Gloria Lynn, Nina Simone, Nancy Wilson, Ella Fitzgerald, Cannonball Adderly, Stanley Turrentine, etc.  So, as a youngster growing up, I had an appreciation and respect for artists who were great at their craft.  I want my grandkids to grow up with that same appreciation.
1609611543|1.0|The ads for this book say \\" he exposes how genetically modified wheat is the root cause of weight gain, diabetes, heart disease, and many neurological disorders--\\" But there is no \\"genetically modified\\" wheat being grown. Hybridized wheat yes. But not GMO wheat--so it makes me wonder how accurate an objective this book is?? Maybe a little sensationalism there to help sell books? Or is this the next fad diet? We already know too many simple carbs are bad for you right? Not spending my money for this one.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Worked great on my Fascinate with Froyo. With gingerbread it continued to work. It will not run on my new Galaxy Nexus, however. It will freeze before loading or during loading at random times, but I've never gotten it to last long enough to get into a game. Lots of premiere phones are getting ICS soon. A big name app like this needs to support it. It's been out plenty of time.<br /><br />UPDATE: They fixed it!! Fun game. Kind of a nice twist on a defense game. I'm glad they updated it to work with ICS, specifically the GNex. Thanks, devs!!
B005OZE9SA|5.0|Disclaimer - I'm new at this. Just bought a Heil PR40 and needed a USB pre-amp to connect it to my Win 7 64-bit system.  I am not using this for music creation, but purely for voice overs (podcasts, video commentary for gaming, etc). The build quality is excellent. The physical form factor is small yet powerful (and easy on the eyes to avoid any wife-aggro). I tested it in multiple audio programs (Audition too) and it performs very well. There is NO noise until about 95% gain, but that is expected.  Before I had this, I had a Presonus Audiobox USB, which had really poor gain and lots of noise. Returned that for this and couldn't be happier for my basic mic-related needs.
B002BWP49C|5.0|I just ordered the best Twilight movie ever! I want to know though, for those of you who have seen the extra footage, is there commentary by Kristen Stewart, or more importantly, Robert Pattinson? It doesn't say. It also doesn't mention if there are deleted scenes included on this DVD edition. Please tell me, I don't want to get my hopes up just to be disappointed that they're not there.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I really like this game and am very happy to have it to play! Its fun and i could play it all day.
159448385X|4.0|The book is very good, it has shocking elements just like The Kite Runner.  I especially loved it because you do not necesarily need to read the Kite Runner  in order to understand the plot line of A Thousand Splendid Suns.  Khaled has done it again- outstanding book.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|ok. fun to play. need a lot of time to earn money. enjoy able games. would not pay for. got it free.
B005K17RU0|5.0|love. how easy it is to operate. love the sunshine app Symbol. just don't like having to drag this sentence out to make it. long enough to submit
B0054JZC6E|4.0|eh some games are kinda boring. other than that its a good time waister. so up to you if you want to get it.
B0067FGYGQ|2.0|Not sure what the other reviewers heard in this. I found it bland and understated to a fault. Whereas her last EP was vibrant and immediate, this is dense and monochromatic. Sorry, but I was dying to get this in my hands and it just didn't \\"do it for me\\" the way her other work has.
B005K17RU0|1.0|Crashes so often on my Kindle Fire that I uninstalled it after just a few minutes. Looks like it would be good if it were made compatible with the fire.
B005K17RU0|1.0|expected better app but it cant do anything without force closing and crashing.....uninstall until fixed, if ever again. very disappointed
B0015AARJI|5.0|I tried the first Sixaxis controller, and then I tried this one, so I think I can really tell the experience I went through when I purchased the Dualshock 3 Sixaxis controller. In one word: Amazing. Not only games feel more \\"real,\\" but you get the experience you felt whenever you played your old PS1 and PS2 games. I own the PS3 60GB version (yeah, the \\"fat\\" one), and I get to play all my previous PS2 and PS1 games, and I just can't picture myself not enjoying the vibration function. Really light, and totally ergonomic. I love it.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book caught my attention from the very start! Suzanne Collins is an amazing author. Thus is pretty much the number one book I've EVER read! :)
B004SUWR2C|4.0|Same basic uno but it also has rules on it that I myself didn't know existed. Its fun, worth 0.99, that's a toss up. but if you like the game of uni, I'm sure you'd like this.
0525478817|3.0|John Green captures the viewpoint of a teenager very well and really connects to Hazel's internal world; however, I felt the plot was very...strange.  Almost like there were two stories happening at once that just happen to tie together...the story of Hazel and Augustus battling cancer, and then the story of Hazel and Augustus' fascination with Peter van Houten and their trip to Amsterdam.  I thought the plot was way too fast-paced, with all the main events slamming you in the face immediately.  There is no build-up to the relationship and very little conflict with regards to the trip (the only conflict is the internal battle with oneself).  Also, I went to Amsterdam once for two days and the vacation is written as if John Green had done the same thing and just written about every little thing he saw instead of exploring the city with greater depth.  In the acknowledgements he says he spent two months there, though.   So in the end, I found it awkward, and I would have liked to see more character development.  I couldn't feel for the characters because I felt everything unfolded too quickly and there wasn't a lot of opportunity of empathy.
B0058M6P54|5.0|I highly recommend this book to anyone wanting to back a variety of beautiful beads. You won't regret it. It's a beautiful but with great how-to's. Buy it!!
B004GYY714|5.0|it's a great tool to listen radio in the States and all over the world. I love all the gospel talk shows and Christian material available. thank you for this application
B004I4H8QS|1.0|If you bought this before there is no need to buy this version and it is not near as good as the Sacd version!  Please wait another 10 years they might it do as 50th Anniversary Super Duper Deluxe version? Only time will tell
B0054JZC6E|5.0|great games! they are a lot of unique games and I love playing allow of them they are really addictjng
B000YENUI6|4.0|I really like this movie. . I wanted a Russian mob movie and I saw this at my sisters house and wanted to add it to my collection.  I have quite a few Viggo Mortensen movies, and in my opinion he always nails it.
B0060ZJ7BC|4.0|I'm not a big baseball fan, but this movie was good.  Brad Pitt was believable as well as everyone else.
B006OAB3ME|3.0|Paul has brought us so much great music over the years, and I respect the man as being one of the 3 greatest songwriters of his generation (Bob Dylan and Paul Simon being the others).  And I really don't think Paul cares at all what we think of his music anymore.  These are good songs that Paul has admired throughout his life and I think he does a pretty decent job with them.  Still, we know what he is capabale of doing, and \\"Kisses On The Bottom\\" falls far short of his best efforts.  But the man is in his 70's now and we aren't going to get \\"Band On The Run\\" anymore.  But we aren't going to get \\"Blood On The Tracks\\" from Dylan anymore or \\"Bridge Over Troubled Waters\\" from Simon anymore now are we?  For what it is, \\"Kisses On The Bottom\\" is decent.  Not great.  Decent.
0440242401|5.0|I won't lie, I was a bit skeptical about reading this book because in the past I haven't always enjoyed Sophie Kinsella's books (as well as the ones under her other name Madeline Wickham). I was pleasantly surprised how much I enjoyed this book. I've read books with similar stories about memory loss after accidents but this was my favorite.
B006OT03BM|5.0|this transformers collection is awesome!!! i just got done watching it in 3d and i must say transformers 3 was made for 3d. but one question where is the ultraviolet/ digital copy?
0312323867|5.0|Before reading this book, read \\"Something Borrowed\\" first! After reading the first book I enjoyed reading something from Darcy's perspective. Such a great read. Every couple months I read all of Emily's books in the order they were published...that's how great her books are!
B00123KDMO|5.0|This is hands down one of the best rock albums ever made. Hard gritty and at times fun and humorous. This was the Mighty Van Halen, not the wimpy top 40 Van Hager of later years.if you enjoy rock and roll and don't have this album, then you've missed out on a true gem.
B003TJR2HS|5.0|This product works perfectly with my ihome docking station and my I-phone 4S.  It was worth the money to be able to use my docking station with my new phone.  Depending on how your docking station is made; it could make it a little unstable when you use this device.  As long as you are careful when you are plugging it in/out it will work fine.  Thank You!! :)
B006ISJQBM|5.0|My husband and I are BIG Hunter S. Thompson fans and loved this movie, maybe even more so than Fear & Loathing... That being said my husband stated that he would love to own this and I am going to give this to him for Valentines. Good gift if I do say so.
B005KELW26|1.0|This was a gift and I would have never purchased this. I hate this cover so much. It's overpriced and the felt in the inside of the cover feels weird (it's felt). It's not comfortable to hold and it serves no other purpose than looking cute.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I put this on my kindle fire and I absolutely love it!!! It's easy to use and I play it all the time. I have had zero problems with it so far.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is so fun my sister and my niece got it in their ipad after I got it on my kindle. none of us can stop playing it!
B0064J6OMO|1.0|I usually love Ryan Reynold's movies but this one was awful.  Really???  Is he that hard up for a decent script that he has to settle for this garbage?  Glad I didn't pay more than $1.99 to see it.  Even that was too much.  I agree with another reviewer who said the trailer didn't hint at this movie's real content.
B003PBB4ME|1.0|I purchased this for potential use filming skate videos...<br /><br />Unfortunately the most critical component... the bolt you screw into your camera to mount it is made of plastic painted silver to appear like its metal... ie. FAKE METAL.<br /><br />I have run into these fake metal screws before and they are about as strong as a piece of lickerish and NOT something you would want to trust to hold a camcorder or DSLR onto.<br /><br />The rest of this product is equally as cheaply made. I would describe it as a piece of junk... given its poor quality and fake metal components (the fake metal is obviously painted silver to try and fool average users) it feels like it could be manufactured for around $3 and I would say its not worth $30.<br /><br />There simply is no way I would trust this to hold up in any moving filming which is what it is specifically designed for.<br /><br />The only hope this thing has at all is if I can dissemble the base plate and replace the FAKE metal bolt with a real 1/4 20 bolt so that it does not snap off when filming.<br /><br />Without that this unit is nothing but a plastic piece of junk that I would never trust to hold a camera of any value.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|These games are basic and simple enough but don't let that fool you into thinking you can easily beat them. Hours of wonderful, mind numbing fun await you!
0679809015|3.0|I got this book thinking it'd be...well..better.  The flaps are very small and hard to open, and some ripped the first time.  Then, it's just a simple type that says \\"a pig\\" in basic font underneath that your thumb hides if you're not careful when you lift up the flap.  My son likes the size of it because it's much smaller and chunkier (easier to throw too!) than the other books, but he's not that interested in the flaps or the story on the inside.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Love this app. Can save ideas, pics, to do list, and much more and access from my computer. phone, and kindle.
0679882820|5.0|I have the boardbook version of Mr. Brown Can Moo, Can You.  My 9 mo old son loves it, he enjoys watching me make all of the different noises.  Of course, most of the Dr. Seuss books are very entertaining for kids.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|This is an amazing app. I recommend it to everyone who wants to be able to control your computer remotely.
B005K17RU0|1.0|no good on fire.  This app is a waste of your time if you have a fire.  Don't waste any time trying to make it work.
B00002N9ER|5.0|Securely hold mag lights.  I gave these with new led mag lights as a gift to my Dad, he loves the whole setup.  As he has gotten older he would never be able to find a flashlight, now they are always in the same place.  A little tight to remove and replace but loosen up with some use.
0143034901|5.0|Once you start this book you can't put it down .... , characters so real that you will be sorry when the book ends...
B003VS0CX8|5.0|Got this as a gift for my Dad and he loves it.  I watched it and the picture and sound quality are much better than I have ever seen this movie before.  Haven't gotten into special features and do not plan to, although my Dad will.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Nice smooth game play. Enjoy the different options for play and background, as well as the deck back. Ads are stills during the day, easy to skip - commercials late night.
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|My wife has been very pleased with this cover.  It fits the Kindle Fire perfect and it is slim and lightweight.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|the games are super addictive. I go crazy when I can't beat it! cant wait to see what else is in store for me.
0471043729|5.0|The authors go out of their way to describe background information including mathematics and chemistry. As with all texts, it is best supplemented by a good professor's course, but it is readable even without such. It is also good as a resource for active research, and most any laboratory that does any electrochemistry will have at least one copy.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love this app and for those who said that they don't like it this is all I can say to them.........wered
B0063IH60K|5.0|Got this for my Kindle Fire just to have something to kill time with.  Excellent Solitaire game with good options.
B00428CCPW|5.0|This is an awesome unique product! Quality is great, shipping was quick! It's a little strange to listen to something so modern on a record player... but the album sounds great! I would definitely recommend this product!
B0078JOAOI|2.0|Such a let down after the mid season finale last year. The first three-quarters of this episode  was as exciting as watching ditchdiggers work. Literally. The characters are still endlessly pontificating their roles and society's new woes. Not to get anyone's hopes up, the last fifteen minutes aren't exactly great, but at least something happens. It's even believable, albeit out of character, and thankfully, much needed.
B000OVLBFS|5.0|As always a great actor and really a good series.  Get the whole series and try to buy used as they are just as good.
146999769X|5.0|A great spiritual journey.  Ever since I read this, I remind myself to be like the water.  The water in the river, that flows over and under and around all its obstacles.  Saltheart Publishers picked a good read to publish.
B0009FU0ZQ|5.0|As always a great actor and really a good series.  Get the whole series and try to buy used as they are just as good.
B004SBQGHS|3.0|great game but its not ad free give what I paid for although I would pay for the free version
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I really love his app. it does everything I need it to.do and more. church notes work notes reminder notes and I can.send to.my email if need be.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this game is pretty good but it takes too long to get point's and too much to unlock new games
B005K17RU0|2.0|I downloaded this app a few days after I received my device. It worked very well for a month. It provided accurate and detailed forecasts. Then, a few days ago, it stopped working. It would shut down quickly after I opened the app. I uninstalled it, but I think that goes without saying.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|I have noted that some reviewers have stated that they didn't like this app because it didn't have radar. It worked fine for me, but it takes a few minutes to load. Just be sure to select radar in the map overlay options and it should work.
B003PIUBZS|5.0|but could have used lucy lawless brest more  lol   very bloody show but with great action and the f/x was  great
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Stephen King is a master of making the impossible sound not only possible, but even probable.  Having read many of his books, there is hardly one I can recall where the plot was nevertheless tenable to someone not ready to accept the paranormal.  If you believe time travel to be inherently paradoxical and most likely impossible (as I do), you'll still be able to enjoy this book - in fact, I have to say that for the last half, I couldn't put it down.  We all know what really happened on 11/22/63, yet there were so many possible endings, none of them prospectively very satisfying.  But when the book was done, all the loose ends had been tied up in a knot, and I felt like I had new perspectives on some important things:  fate, destiny, American life, the human psyche, and yes, the JFK assassination (which I remember all too well from fourth grade).  Well researched, fast-moving, and with believable characters reacting to events outside their comprehension (both temporal and paranormal), this is without a question King's best novel.  Bravo!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|These games are awesome! I play them everyday. They can be a good challenge or excellent for staving off boredom.
B003VS0CWY|5.0|One of my most favorite movies.  Bue-Ray version is superb, adding crystal clear video along with enhanced sound.  It was like viewing an entirely new movie!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I downloaded it when it was the free app of the day, but was reluctant to apply updates until now. Looks like the bug has been fixed, because my points and games survived the update. Some of the games are hard or too fast, but there are so many of them that I can quickly find another one that fits me better.
B005I6EVUG|5.0|This cover is beautiful,looks very classy & rich. I had no problem putting the Fire into place. It holds the Fire very securely and provides excellent protection. A little pricy, but well worth it.
B0063GORYU|5.0|this is such an addicting game. so much more fun than regular solitaire.  thank you MobilityWare for coming out with a fun game. just wish you could play online against other people.
B004NCLKJG|4.0|Une distribution exceptionnelle, qui réunit John Vickers Birgit Nilsson, Leonie Rysaneck ! On croit rêver. La direction est plus banale, mais on acquerra cette version d'abord pour les voix.
0061733199|5.0|I received my copy and read through it once already and for a totall beginner on survival its amazing. It covers stuff from plane crash to what types of fungi you can eat. It goes over knots, traps, animal footprints, and edible plants and poisonous foods and animals. Also how to prepare your meal after you kill it. Goes over things to trow into a Bug Out Bag and really alot of basics for us newbies out there. And ive only.covered a small portion of what is in this book. Dont expect to be like survivor man after reading but you wil most definately be on your way to a survivor master! Id reccomend this book to anyone who wants to save your own butt one day. Awesome book.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|fun game! it is easy to use and it is an addictive game! you should get this app! I love it!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love this game.I had bought it for the D's but itworks so much better on the fire. such a great choice of games when you want to while a way a few minutes.cant go wrong if you get this app.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love this game me and my sister compete against each other to see who gets a higher score. I love it!
B005VPRETE|5.0|My 4.5 year old daughter was able to put this together 90% completely by herself. We are thrilled that Lego finally got smart by making these things for girls. My daughter was never interested previously, as both of her older brothers were playing with their pure-boy ones such as Star Wars, Ninjago, etc. I am ready to buy every one of these Friends sets, but am waiting since we need to pace ourselves (although it's fantastic they are available, there are still only about maybe 7 sets or so that are decent sized (~$20 and up). These are all fully worth the money and time. My daughter is already begging for more and they are very quickly picked over I noticed, at Target, Meijer, and everywhere else they seem to be sold. They're a hit!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|love,love,love this game...I can't put it down !!!!! it,s all I think about...I even play In my dreams!!!!!!! thankyou ;)
B0063GORYU|4.0|I'm addicted! I love regular Solitaire, and had my husband teach me how to play Spider, and now I can't stop playing.
B004EPZ0AC|1.0|It will be a waste of your time and your kid's time. Get something else!!! Not worth the money. thanks jeepers media!!!
B006G2NVCA|2.0|Three discs, 39 traks...all very nice music.  But, it's a lot like Ghosts I-IV.  I liked ghosts I-IV...can get a tad boring after a while.
B0019MQBJW|2.0|I really wish I had something more positive to say, seeing as this is my favorite ballet. But if you're looking for a version to own on Blu-ray, you're better off with the Mariinsky version. The problems I have with this one unfortunately outweigh the good.<br /><br />One: Siegfried. He is supposed to be turning 21. So why does he look 35? This Siegfried is just way too old-looking for me to suspend my disbelief. I have no idea how old the actual ballerina playing him is, but he looks mid-thirties. The Mariinsky version has a more proper Siegfried that one can actually buy being 21. This one looks like he hasn't seen 21 in a while.<br /><br />Two: Mariinsky has the better Rothbart. Maybe I made the mistake of watching the Mariinsky Blu-ray first, but going from that to this was...disappointing. He was very intimidating in the Mariinsky production and considering the fact he is an evil half man, half owl, it made sense. Here, he's just some dull guy in a much less intimidating costume.<br /><br />The sets are pretty minimal here, which isn't necessarily a bad thing but it can get a bit boring.<br /><br />The dancers, especially the Jester (who is missing from this version) were much better in the Mariinsky. Two of the male dancers in the Mariinsky version really gave it their all in the first act with some very impressive feats that got much applause from the audience, so to see that spectacle missing here was a letdown. No one \\"wows\\" you. They're just going through the motions.<br /><br />On the bright side, the orchestra does a wonderful job.
159448385X|5.0|This book changed a lot about how I view the world.... Read this right after The Kite Runner and both were excellent.

B002GKXV3K|1.0|Who doesn't like hot lesbians? ...but only the LGBT community really appreciates the \\"issues & challenges\\" in this series, so ...no universal, long term appeal.  This is just another niche series for a niche audience.  Years from now, it will be forgotten.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I am so in love with this app! This is easily the best notetaker app ever. When I need to brainstorm out loud, I can record it and keep my notes. If I want a pic of a flyer for an event, I can keep a photo note. If I feel like typing, I can do that too. Best one on the market and syncs easily from my tablet (kindle) to my phone (Evo) to my computer.

B002KSPKRS|4.0|I find when playing games, the sound is awsome! I can hear people sneaking up on me and they kill me no more. It has really improved my scores. But, they do tend to hurt my ears after an hour or two. I have to take a break from wearing them once in a while, but I do have a big head too.

0385342063|5.0|I have long been a fan of Sophie Kinsella.  I started way back when Confessions of a Shopaholic first debuted.  I admit, even though I am a girl, I am not into the whole 'chick-lit' genre so much.  I find most to be trite and full of fluff.  But there is something standalone about Sophie Kinsella's bubbly, cheeky writing style that instantly makes you feel as though your listening to a story being told by one of your close friends while sitting at bar.  Kinsella also has the ability to spin her characters into the most awkward, cringe inducing situations that make your anxiety rise as the scenario gets more and more tangled at every turn.<br /><br />She does not disappoint with our heroine Poppy in her latest novel.  Poppy is in the worst sort of situation a 20-something woman could imagine: She's lost her newly acquired engagement ring after an afternoon of celebratory drinks at a hotel with her girlfriends. She let them all have a go at trying it on, and then when it came time to leave, it was gone.  As if it weren't bad enough, the ring in question is of course a family heirloom from the grooms side, and guess who's parents will be in town later that day and want to see her with the ring on?  Oh and also throw in her stolen iPhone minutes later, and then immediately finding a working cellphone in a trashcan that she now adopts as hers so the hotel has a number to contact her at in the event they find the ring.  She quickly finds that phone belongs to a former assistant a very important businessman, their lives start to intertwine as she refuses to give the phone up.<br /><br />If you're at all a fan of Sophie Kinsella's books, you will absolutely love this book.  It's just...cute and adorable without being sickly sweet.  The cringe-inducing scenarios keep the storyline in check with clever plot turns along with Poppy's affable, bumbling personality. There are witty details throughout that make the book unique, such as Poppy including tons of footnotes along the way while telling the story because her fiance's super smart family is a group of writers and includes them constantly in their research novels. They can be a little much at first, but it becomes quirky and funny.<br /><br />This is another feel-good novel by Kinsella that I can easily see being turned into a movie.story because her fiance's super smart family is a group of writers and includes them constantly in their research novels.

B004XE0P5E|5.0|In our sugar cereal, fast-food, ADHD infested day-in-age, we are constantly looking for music that gives us a quick prozac fix without a whole lot of thinking. Most people don't want to actually put any effort into listening to music, instead rather abuse it. People hate having to actually dive inside and swim alongside brilliance searching for hidden beauty that manifests itself all-throughout music such as this. Most music today lacks the golden word for this band's style, \\"Subtlety\\". The main idea might not be flashing right in front of your eyes, but there will be moments when the brilliance of this music floods through you inner-conscience, harmonizing with your soul.  Highly recommended for those who have what so many lack: patience and the ability to decipher the finer vibrations of music.

B0073PQ720|1.0|This movie was pointless, passionless, and mindless from start to finish. It provoked no positive emotions whatsoever, no warmth of character at any point, in any one, and it was totally uninteresting and unexciting. It had no purpose in its plot other than to create an intellectual argument to justify the lawless killing of other sociopath criminal human beings, and it did it without developing any sympathy for any of the characters. This movie could have been a half hour long, and been just as effective in making it's point, whatever that was. There was hardly any action involving cars and driving, which was unforgivable in a movie called \\"Drive\\". This movie would have been better titled \\"Driver\\", as it was an obvious, and poorly done rip-off of \\"Taxi Driver\\". It's not about cars and driving at all. It's about a criminal sociopath. When this movie was over, I just stared blankly at the wall for about 5 minutes waiting for my mind to generate some redeeming value in anything that had just transpired on the screen. Never happened. I had to switch over to cable to watch something, anything, that would fill the void this movie created in my skull. It was mind numbing in it's mindlessness. If you want to watch something that will leave you saying \\"total waste of time\\" at the end, go for it.
B003YL4LYI|4.0|I know a LOT of people are professing their disappointment in A Feast for Crows and A Dance with Dragons, stating that the books are nothing more than stalling and the characters aren't truly going anywhere. But I have to state for the record that George R.R. Martin's worst book is still better than some of the best books I've read by many other authors who try to imitate him.<br /><br />The characters continue to grow and mature, and I think that was more important than jumping on to the next big issue in the book. It's called development, and in a novel it takes a chapter or two... eventually leading the novel to a much bigger and better conclusion. Unfortunately some people want instant gratification, and that isn't something you're going to get from this book. What you will get is more background, history and development of characters. You'll start to feel empathy for some of the characters you hate and frustration with some of the characters you love. They make decisions and go places we didn't forsee in the earlier books. And with an epic series of this kind it sometimes takes an entire novel to build the story up rather than a few chapters in a novel.<br /><br />I, for one, was extremely satisfied at the end of A Dance with Dragons. It left me aching for more, and frustrated that I have to wait for the next installment. I hope this series continues to develop and grow and doesn't come to a cataclysmic end. We've spent so many books anticipating the coming of winter, that I want to live through the winter and see the spring with these characters I've come to know!<br /><br />I highly recommend this book/series to anyone who enjoys fantasy and historical novels. From teen to adult, I think anyone would enjoy them.<br /><br />Happy Reading =]

B006SV2LWA|2.0|This movie starts interestingly enough cutting between several characters with a cool techno soundtrack. By the end it is like a big wastebasket full of virus ridden snotrags. The story goes nowhere because there is really nowhere for it to go. What suspense there is lies in seeing what characters we might mildly care about will croak from the virus. Sorry did I say \\"characters,\\" that's giving the movie way too much credit. This is the type of movie where the \\"characterization\\" consists of plugging in Hollywood stars and giving them maybe one identifying trait. Concerned dad, conflicted bureaucrat, idealistic scientist, etc. We know Jude Law is up to no good because he has crooked teeth! His character, a blogger who opportunistically profits off the disease, is the closest thing to a villain the movie has. Any criticism of the government characters comes from him and is therefore obviously not to be trusted. Why didn't they give him a hunchback while they were at it? Aside from the insinuations of the sleazy blogger we are supposed to believe the CDC is full of virtuous selfless souls who just want to sacrifice themselves to save others, and soldiers on the streets are a good thing! So when you hear about some nasty new virus don't hesitate to report to your friendly neighborhood FEMA camp for your injection like a good little piggie, er, I mean citizen! Cool soundtrack though.
B006UG90RM|5.0|At first listen, I wasn't sure.  I was very excited about Van Halen being back about a new album, Diamond Dave.  OH, all the good stuff.  But you know so often, you just can't go back.  I read Sammy's remarks and he seems like a very bitter, petulant child.  He hasn't really done much and he's jealous.  That's what I read.  So I slowed down, turned off the t.v. and just listened.  It was like that first time I listened to 1984.  I had a hard time sitting in my barracks in Camp Pendelton trying to get my mind around a freakin' keyboard with Van Halen.  The second time around was a blast, as I was rocking to REAL Van Halen once again.  I like this album.  I like it alot and I'm really glad they made it.  I'm looking forward to the future.  Van Halen is reclaiming the top!

B001UV4XIS|5.0|Since we are big Harry Potter fans you can't expect a bad review from us!  We enjoyed the movie and think they did a decent job with the ending.  We would have liked to have seen more of the end battle with all the characters that were involved in the book, but it was good.
B00425S1H8|5.0|Worked great.  I had to reload firmware on a Russound Music system, and this adapter did the trick.  I had a Belkin model, and had been warned by the manufacturer that it may not work.  It didn't.  So, I bought the Plugable model based on the Prolific chip.  While the drivers loaded fine for my Windows 7 64 bit version, I only got the firmware reload to work with a windows 7 32 bit version. Not sure why, but that's what happened.

B004JZBGWI|5.0|Ignore the reviews that talk about being Online as a requirement. The app comes out of the box without the requirement. It DOES allow you to sync with an online copy of your notes -- a good thing if you want to use multiple computers to access your notes -- which triggers the online requirement, but it's an option and not the default. If you strike the reviews that (erroneously) fault the online requirement, this app gets a solid five stars.
B005FMZWD8|4.0|The Invicta 1513 I Force is very nice watch.  Amazon's price makes it a bargain.  The brilliant face combined with the large buttons make it easy to read the time as well as use the stop-watch features.  The glow in the dark feature is nice as well.  It has separate dials for the tenths of a second, seconds and minutes - perfect for runners or coaches who need that timing feature.<br /><br />Overall, it's a very nice watch, especially for the price.  However, if you are not used to the current trend of BIG watches, this one might take some getting used to. Due to its size it does not fit comfortably under cuffs.  It would make a great summer, casual watch.
0739343823|5.0|I have read and listened to several of John Grisham's novels, and The Partner has been my favorite so far.  The story is gripping and suspenseful, with wonderful details and great character development.  Plus, Frank Muller's narration is fantastic.  Muller gives each character his or her own voice and personality so well that you know who is speaking even before the text tells you.  I loved this story, and I specifically recommend the audiobook version!

B0064NTZJO|3.0|I have a hard time deciding whether or not to recommend \\"Drive\\" to most people. To anyone who shies away from graphic violence which is realistic, I would say this movie isn't for you. While there aren't a lot of violent scenes here, the ones the movie has are rather brutal. I can't exactly say those looking for great chase scenes will love this either - it has about three fairly short chase scenes, though they were each striking in different ways. The opening scene where we first learn that the driver makes some money as a getaway driver isn't fast-paced but is very unique; it was my favorite scene in the movie because it's not the type of chase you normally see. The driver manages to elude capture using some intelligent techniques.  The dialog in the movie left something to be desired. The driver (his character has no name) says little more than a word here and there for half the movie; then he suddenly has a whole lot to say to the people threatening him. The female neighbor he becomes protective of says even less. What I did appreciate about the movie was its direction and style. The director did some interesting things with light which caught my eye at times. I enjoyed the music used and it was integrated well into the story. A few scenes used slow-motion, a technique which gets on my nerves when not done well; however, the director utilized it successfully here. In the end, I liked the style of the movie more than the substance. I felt the dialog needed improvement and the characters needed a little more development.

B001R60ESE|4.0|This is an all-star concert.  Chris and his many guests performed a variety of music that was very entertaining.  The video and audio qualities are very good but not on a par with \\"Sting Live in Berlin\\" or \\"America Live in Chicago\\".
0439023513|5.0|I just had to write a review after seeing all the negative reviews for this book.  I almost chose not to read it, but am glad I stuck with it and finished the series.  First, let me say I will not add any spoliers to this, so don't worry if you haven't read it.  It frustrates me that so many people do that, when most people read reviews BEFORE reading a book.  I enjoyed this series more than I expected to and found myself attached to the characters long after the story ended.  I think the author did a wonderful job of depicting the horrors of war, while still placing focus on the characters and how it affected their lives.  I loved the ending and in a way loved crying with the characters, with that unique feeling of knowing this book really did move me.  Please read it and find closure in the series, you won't be sorry you did!
B005J4TLN4|3.0|What do you get when you make scumbags a ragtag band of  heroes who have to reluctantly defend the block (and apartment high-rise) they've been looting residents of cellphone and credit card booty from a bunch of very dark, furry, and phosphorescently toothed aliens?  It kind of depends on whether you like rooting for lowlifes or not.  If you do, then Attack The Block is a pretty fast-paced film with shallow, but often funny characters.  The aliens are shown with a kind of minimalist approach--all you really see is fur and teeth, loud, chomping (and yes, glow-in-the-dark!)teeth.  Now, if you are the person who has to have their main character believable and sympathetic, this film might drag a little slower for you, as there is very little nobility on the leads' respective parts.  Their actions, save for one oddly non sequitur altruistic move at the end of the film, are almost as feral and self-motivated as the canined aliens they get pitted against.  Also, if you are annoyed by spuriousness, wait until you see the leap in logic one of the characters makes to guess the motivations of the aliens.  I'm sure the agent representing the writer(s) for this film probably earned his/her money shopping this around.  All in all, Attack The Block is more entertaining than annoying, or to put it in a soon to be extinct parlance:  worth a rental.
B006IGZWB2|2.0|All of the black characters are saints and all but one White are jerks or worse. Evidently the book is much better, but I doubt that reality played much of a part in it either.

1400052181|5.0|The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks is a science, history, and overall fun and enlightening read. The book is about an African American woman who was diagnosed with cervical cancer, and little did anyone know that her cancer cells would forever change the world of cancer research. The story basically outlined the history and importance of her \\"immortal\\" cells, and the story was fast paced and informative, without being tedious.  Henrietta is diagnosed with the cancer and soon dies, but her doctor George Gey realized the importance of her cells and got her husband to sign forms that gave the hospital full control over the cells and what to do with them. He figures out the cells' immortality and goes through many studies to ultimately try to figure out the root of what kept them growing. The incorporation of the science, history, and storyline leaves the reader in awe after finishing the book, because the story is enjoyable, but surprisingly informative at the same time.  Skloot's style definitely kept the book from anything but boring. She researches the cells and about Henrietta's history and manages to get the perspectives of the Lacks family throughout the whole process of figuring out the true significance of Henrietta's cells. She digs deep to find out the history of the Lacks family, and gives the reader insight into what happened because of Henrietta's death and how their lives were affected. It helps put into perspective that the cells came from a real person, not a specimen that was merely studied for scientific research.  She also manages to describe events in the novel (whether it is a flashback about Henrietta's childhood or a current occurrence) so vividly and the reader feels as if they are in the novel, as cliché as it sounds. The past events seem so clear and Skloot's writing style makes the reader think that she was there observing all the events, though she clearly was not.  Additionally, Skloot's use of jumping from year to year, not always in chronological order, helps the reader understand the significance of her cells at various different time periods. Skloot had interviews with the Lacks family members in the late 1990's and their perspectives then juxtaposed with their perspectives in the 1950's created an interesting point of view throughout the novel. Also, there were many different conflicts in the story, further driving it forward. Family conflicts, racial conflicts, conflicts between doctors. All of these elements contribute to the overall plot and its importance.  Overall, The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks is a must read for anyone keen on learning about the field of cancer research and the history around it or anyone who's looking for an enjoyable book to pass time, while acquiring new knowledge simultaneously. I give the novel 5/5 stars because of the mind blowing facts, the rich history, and the entertaining chapters that kept me turning each page to the next.
B0070Z4M4I|5.0|Finally a movie that is worth giving your complete attension to watching and if your signifigent other is with you they will be as close as close gets.

0312641893|5.0|Such a clever take on a classic tale! This book brought to life a whole new world of AMAZING!! An entirely unique story that had me loving every single page! Honestly... This story was extremely well written! I was caught from the beginning. Chapter one left me mystified... Chapter two left me wanting more... and after that... I was sold! If your looking for a book about a story we've all heard before, but taken to entirely NEW levels! Your gonna want to read this! There's so much I could gush about this book! There's the ever so sweet prince! The determined heroine! Even the beautiful on the outside ugly on the inside villain kinda grew on me. I can't wait to see what happens next in this crazy tale! So many possibilities!! I'm so ready for more!

B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love this app so much is so awesome. I love playing and it keeps me entertained for hours on end
B000L3CHC0|5.0|I use this as a casual watch for weekends. This is my first Tisso, and I am favorably impressed by the workmanship and overall appearance of this timepiece. Although I'm not an expert by any means, I have worked in the watch/jewelry industry as a part-time jewelry salesman throughout my years in college and graduate school, and I have handled and examined Timex, Citizen, Rolex, Tag Heuer, and Patek Philippe watches.<br /><br />As another reviewer said, this is a heavy men's watch made of solid stainless steel. The bracelet is very comfortable and well-fabricated. The sapphire crystal is very nice and this feature is usually only available on watches priced well above $500. The yellow tachymeter dials really stand out nicely against the black case back, and craftsmanship is evident in the numerals and sub-dials as well.<br /><br />If I were looking for a casual watch to present as a gift (or buy for myself), I would definitely go with this watch. I am happy with my purchase. The quality and craftsmanship are evident by simply glancing at it under the fluorescent lights in a typical grocery store. Trust me, you (or your friend) will be satisfied with this watch. The only caveat I can think of is that this is not an everyday dress watch. A dress watch slips effortlessly under the sleeve of a buttoned-down dress shirt, and the case on this watch is simply too thick for the task.
B006W0QOF2|3.0|If there was ever a wannabe Sylvester Stallone, well, here he is. Lol. The movie itself was very interesting, but the 3 word script for Gosling was horrible... He's a good actor, but was trying WAY too hard to be a \\"tough-guy.\\" Less macho + more words = better movie.

B004WESFZW|5.0|This movie provides an excellent exploration of the interrelated topics of free will, determinism, causality, chance,  and fate (\\"the plan\\").  It's deep and profound stuff, and coincidentally (or not?) I stumbled across this movie on the very day that I started reviewing my notes from a lecture series on free will, in order to try to reach some tentative conclusions.<br /><br />But of course this a movie, not a lecture series, so it's meant to entertain, in addition to teaching.  And it succeeds on the entertainment level as well.  As always, Matt Damon delivers, and the other actors excel as well.  In addition, everything else about the movie is great - plot structure, pacing, plausibility, romance, suspense, thrills, special effects, etc.<br /><br />Highly recommended.  In fact, one of the better movies I've seen in a while.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|kinda difficult to control the stuff in some of them but its great for passin the time. I haven't seen an update for it yet but from what I have read on here.. I don't plan on doing it when it does pop up
0307352145|5.0|Throughout most of her book, Susan Cain takes a balanced approach to the immensely difficult task of examining the advantages and disadvantages of being primarily an introvert as well as those of being primarily an extrovert. I use the term \\"primarily\\" in the context of culture as well as one's temperament, personality, preferences, tendencies, and (yes) volition. \\"If given a choice...\\" is a helpful phrase. Some people dread being the center of attention whereas the behavior of others indicates a pathological need for it. Not all introverts are shy and reluctant, however, and not all extroverts are bombastic and impulsive. Moreover, expediency can also come into play. As Walt Whitman affirms in \\"Song of Myself,\\" each person is \\"large\\"...and contains \\"multitudes.\\"<br /><br />When writing her book, Cain was guided and informed by research in social science (e.g. Carl Jung, Jerome Kagan, Elaine Aron, C.A. Valentine, David Winter) supplemented by what she had learned from her own observations. She examines the inadequacies of several concepts such as charismatic leadership, the New Groupthink, the \\"Extrovert Ideal\\" (i.e. \\"the omnipresent belief that the ideal self is gregarious, alpha, and comfortable in the spotlight\\"), being or at least seeming \\"cool,\\" collaborative innovation, and being a more \\"assertive\\" student in the classroom. Historians' accounts and media coverage must share at least some of the blame for widespread but remarkably durable misconceptions about eminent persons such as Warren Buffett, Dale Carnegie, Albert Einstein, Mohandas Gandhi, Rosa Parks, Steven Spielberg, and Steve Wozniak. However great their impact on others may be, all are (or were) essentially introverted. What else do they share in common? They are renowned for being thoughtful, indeed reflective, tending to take more time than others do to make sound decisions and to reach correct conclusions.<br /><br />Ironically, Carnegie is among the pioneers of self-help programs that emphasize \\"winning friends and influencing people,\\" the title of a book first published in 1936 that continues to be a bestseller. According to Cain, Carnagey (who later changed his name \\"likely to evoke Andrew Carnegie, the great industrialist\\") was a good-natured but insecure high school student. He was skinny, unathletic, and fretful. His subsequent career from farmboy to salesman to public- speaking icon demonstrates a shift in America \\"from what influential cultural historian Warren Susman called a Culture of Character to a Culture of Personality - and opened up a Pandora's Box of personal anxieties from which we would never quite recover.\\"<br /><br />By the end of the book, Cain seems to include in the introvert category almost anyone who is \\"reflective, cerebral, bookish, unassuming, sensitive, thoughtful, serious, contemplative, subtle, introspective, inner-directed, gentle, calm, modest, solitude-seeking, shy, risk-averse, thin-skinned.\\" Surely many (most?) of those who are extroverts also demonstrate one (if not several) of these attributes, at least occasionally. How would she categorize, for example, Richard Feynman?<br /><br />The much more important point, in my opinion, is that assigning a label such as introvert or extrovert to someone denies the human complexity to which Whitman referred. Obviously, some people are more or less introverted or extroverted than others. It's also obvious, that some situations (usually in a social context) require outgoing behavior whereas other situations (usually in an intellectual or spiritual context) require solitude, tranquility, perhaps even isolation.<br /><br />For me, some of Cain's most valuable material is provided in Chapter 11, \\"On Cobblers and Generals\\" (especially pages 250-258) when she discusses the implications and consequences of many (most?) schools that are designed for extroverts. \\"The purpose of school should be to prepare kids for the rest of their lives, but too often what kids need to be prepared for issurviving the school day itself.\\" She goes on to observe, \\"The school environment can be highly unnatural, especially from the perspective of an introverted child who loves to work intensely on projects he cares about, and hang out with one or two friends at a time.\\"  Cain offers several key points for teachers to consider (e.g. \\"Teach all kids to work independently\\"), followed by several key points for parents to consider if they able to select a school (e.g. one that hires and supports teachers \\"who seem to understand the shy/serious/introverted/sensitive temperament\\"). I agree with Cain that appearance is not reality...but the fact remains, that the misconceptions she repudiates in her book are no less \\"real\\" because they are wrong, nor are the \\"personal anxieties from which we would never quite recover.\\"bserve, \\"The school environment can be highly unnatural, especially from the perspective of an introverted child who loves to work intensely on projects he cares about, and hang out with one or two friends at a time.\\"  Cain offers several key points for teachers to consider (e.g. \\"Teach all kids to work independently\\"), followed by several key points for parents to consider if they able to select a school (e.g. one that hires and supports teachers \\"who seem to understand the shy/serious/introverted/sensitive temperament\\").

B001KZVQJI|5.0|This movie gets shortchanged by so many people.  Although a terribly long but excellent movie, the extended edition feel much more personal than the theatrical.

B000FCKC4C|4.0|The journey of a shepherd from his country to Egypt and then back, in search of a treasure. Simple but moving story. The king, the merchant, the alchemist - all teach him a little bit about himself and the world we all live in.<br /><br />This is a short and simple story about a young shepherd's journey from his home in Spain in search of a treasure, that is supposedly near the Pyramids in Egypt. Along the way he meets several people; it is a gypsy woman sets him off on his quest; a king offers him two stones to guide him on his way. The merchant and later the alchemist help him learn the lessons of life that the journey is meant to teach.<br /><br />At the end of the book I had to admit that the story is moving enough  make you think about if after you left the book. However, I could not see why it has become the international phenomenon that it has - maybe the brevity, the simplicity of the message.<br /><br />\\"And, when you want something, all the universe conspires in helping you to achieve it.\\"<br />If you are a Hindi movie fan, you will recognize this line as appearing several times in the Shahrukh Khan starrer, \\"Om Shanti Om\\", directed by eminent choreographer Farah Khan. Uncredited, of course.<br /><br />Here are a couple of excerpts from the book that I found enlightening:<br /><br />\\"You should pay more attention to the caravan,\\" the boy said to the Englishman, after the camel driver had left. \\"We make a lot of detours, but we're always heading for the same destination.\\" \\"And you ought to read more about the world,\\" answered the Englishman. \\"Books are like caravans in that respect.\\"<br /><br />\\"Isn't wine prohibited here?\\" the boy asked \\"It's not what enters men's mouths that's evil,\\" said the alchemist. \\"It's what comes out of their mouths that is.\\"

B001NEK2GE|5.0|I've had the G13 for almost 6 months. I initially got it for Warcraft. After some initial trial and error in how to best set it up, it works really well for that and had majorly improved my game play. I've noticed no wear or change in feel of even the most used buttons. It's FAR more comfortable than trying to use the left side of my keyboard in a similar fashion. I can't imagine needing more buttons especially since I have one of the thumb buttons assigned to shift which effectively doubles the the number available. Obviously there are a few of them that are a bit more of a stretch and those get assigned to less needed commands.  The surprising thing is I've also been using it for other software. Where I used to use the mouse with the drop down menus, I now use the G13 with shortcut keys assigned to the pad. It takes a little time to get used to what button does what, but it's definitely a time saver ones that period is over.  I'd highly recommend this to anyone needing some extra buttons or even just buttons laid out in a more ergonomic fashion. I do have relatively large hands. With smaller hands, a few more buttons would likely become awkward to reach, but even so it would be useful.

B004EJUMT2|5.0|This by far is the best album by a new band that I have heard in years...By the third time listening through you will find yourself singing along to the extremely catchy lyrics, as if you are at some satanic \\"Ritual\\" yourself...Who knew Satanism could sound so cheerful, I mean this stuff could be played on the radio, until parents learned the lyrics of course...

I absolutely loved the first two books. in the second book just when you think the Capitol can not get anymore twisted they do.  Could not put them down.<br /><br />  I read the last book in the Hunger games and I did not like it as much... it was really weird and I felt she jumped around and lost me a few times.  I also hated that they killed Prim on purpose.  It made me feel like there is really no hope for humanity in that kind of scenario.  You would think that out of the ashes of all that pain and suffering more good would have come out of it. it The absolute inhumanity of human kind in this book is so sad.
B000001EUP|4.0|I must admit, I was wrong to judge the Scorpions by their 1979 album Lovedrive and assume *everything* they did after that album was automatically cheesy and typical hair metal.  It's not.  At least, not this album.  \\"Blackout\\" has a catchy verse melody and solid chorus.  What more does it need?  It's a classic.  It never got the recognition that some of the other Scorpions songs continue to receive on radio airwaves which is unfortunate.  \\"Can't Live Without You\\" opens with a memorable chugging rhythm and a guitar riff that screams \\"It's party time!\\"  Good enough chorus, though sort of mindless but I won't fault it since I enjoy it.  I honestly never got the appeal of \\"No One Like You\\" the same way as everyone else.  It's not that I hate it necessarily, and the opening riff is downright *awesome* but the chorus basically takes that same riff and adds vocals over top and eh... not a writing style I'm especially fond of (at least not in this particular case).  \\"You Give Me All I Need\\" contains a solid guitar line leading into a romantic-style verse and a straight forward chorus.  Normally simplicity to THIS extent would drive me mad but... the Scorpions are different I suppose.  \\"Now\\" just plain *rocks*.  Klaus Meine's screaming abilities are questionable though- he's not *that* great of a singer and it's kind of revealed here.  \\"Dynamite\\" contains a simple chorus and what's especially simple and borderline mindless is the way Klaus screams \\"DYNAMIIIIITE!\\".  At least I can forgive this example of clumsiness thanks to the fast-paced rocking nature of the song.  \\"Arizona\\" is a winner by default- I'm a sucker for laidback, California vibes in the verse melody.  Another example is \\"California Nights\\" by Sweet and several other 70's and 80's songs that aren't coming to mind right now.  These type of warm environment-type vocal melodies always win me over (especially in the middle of February!).  \\"China White\\" gets my vote for heaviest and BEST guitar riff on the entire album.  This guitar riff is a monster and stands out high and tall among the pack.  Klaus' vocals are definitely on the overbearingly obnoxious side since the song mainly showcases his skills as a singer, which are, as you know, questionable in my book.  His screaming power just doesn't WOW me.  I also question whether the guitar riff -despite how strong and memorable it is- really blends well with his voice, but who cares, I love the song anyway.  \\"When the Smoke Is Going Down\\" is a nicely sung, easily written ballad that the Scorpions like to include on every one of their albums in some shape or form.  I don't mind it, but if someone said they hated these type of power ballads because they sound bland, I couldn't argue.  Overall not a bad album at all.  In fact I will temporarily let go of my stubbornness and admit that it's actually fantastic.

B005DD7H50|5.0|Fascinating, unpredictable movie. This is one of those great movies where you are at a complete loss trying to guess the plot in advance. Deftly written with great twists and turns, going from grand highs to devastating lows and danger. Bradley Cooper proves to be quite the actor as well; he plays both the burnout unmotivated writer, to brilliant rich guy on the move equally well.  I would have preferred they stayed a bit longer with the great successes he was experiencing in the beginning...the downhill path Cooper has is fast, steep, and dangerous to say the least. DeNiro's casting and role is perfect as well.
0439023513|4.0|I have mixed feelings about how this book turned out. District 13 was not very fun to sit in on - not very much happened there, really. Katniss agreed to become the Mockingjay(what a surprise)! I felt like Katniss had realized at the end of the second book, at least subconsciously, that Peeta was the one for her, but now she was separated from him and back with Gale.  I felt it was a little dragged on in the beginning and rushed in the end. A lot of the book was spent with Katniss on morphling and people trying to get Peeta better after his being hijacked. I also felt that some of the deaths were simply made to show in more effect the cause of war(Prim's death was so unnecessary. But I suppose she was too pure and hopeful of a character to survive). I was also upset about Finnick's death. It reminded me a little of Lupin's in Harry Potter(new wife? child?) but I suppose, again, Collins was just trying to show us that in war, people you care about die.  The part about a Hunger Games involving the Capitol's children was so frustrating, yet I thought it was a perfect thing to add. It showed perfectly how history is able to repeat itself, how ex-slaves are able to own slaves, that sort of thing. Human memory is easily distorted and manipulated, and many turn to revenge instead of peace. That was definitely a good piece to include. Another thing I particularly enjoyed was the way Katniss reacted during the execution of President Snow; even with her broken and changed forever, she was still fighting, still rebelling.  The end felt like it was summarized, like Collins had decided it didn't quite matter as much, and she didn't want to go into detail on it. Katniss and Peeta did end up together, although they were both changed so much it was not in the way anyone would have imagined back in the first book. I found the ending with Gale unsatisfying - I was hoping they could hold onto their friendship. I guess that bomb made that impossible(again, I found that unnecessary). Ialso didn't quite like that they had children...it seemed like Peeta had talked her into it, and Katniss was still numb and war-torn inside: it just didn't quite seem fitting.  All in all, it felt a little too summarized in some points and a little too focused on death and people dying. However, this book was also a page-turner and the bittersweet sort of feeling at the end I felt was perfectly realistic.
B00174TKGI|5.0|Another Denzel masterpiece of acting. The storyline seems almost made for him; combining intensity, charm, and ruthlessness. For decades, he quietly works as a chauffer for the King of the Harlem drug trade, learning the business from top to bottom in the background. After Bumpy dies, Frank Lucas (Denzel) turns out to be a brilliant protege. He single-handedly changes the entire drug business. He imports uncut product direct from Thailand, arranging transport through the military, In short order, he obtains obscene wealth and power. Along the way, he lays down the law, ruthlessly killing anyone in his way, in a moment's notice...and marries Ms. Puerto Rico.  Side note; I recently watched Wall Street 2, and really liked the acting performance of Josh Brolin as Bretton James - ruthless Wall St. kingpin. In the back of my mind, I couldn't remember other roles by him. He plays a fantastic scumbug dirty cop in American Gangster.  Highly recommend this movie. Watched this multiple times.
0439023491|4.0|I had read The Hunger Games months before and wasn't sure if I wanted to continue the trilogy. At last, I decided I would go ahead and buy the second and third books from amazon. From that arose the problem: clicking \\"add to cart\\" on Mockingjay, my eyes flicked down to read (SPOILER) \\"Against all odds, Katniss Everdeen has survived the Hunger Games twice.\\" That one sentence dampened my entire experience of reading Catching Fire.<br /><br />After reading the first book, I was excited, wondering what the author could possibly come up with in the other two books, since Katniss and Peeta had made it out of the arena alive. Having Katniss have to reenter the arena seemed redundant and lacking in imagination. I do feel that I would have enjoyed the book a bit more if I wasn't waiting at every move for her to have to join the Games again. And when they did again enter the arena, I felt it was too lacking...after all, the first book was entirely based around her being in the arena. This time, it was over with quickly, and rather predictable. I felt it left something to be desired.<br /><br />However, during the process of reading it I found it hard to put down. I sacrificed a couple nights of homework for it...Collins' writing style caught my attention and held it until the last page ended. A suspenseful, fun read, even if it leaves a little to be desired.
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|It is a great Aneroid diary, calendar, and list keeper, that syncs across gmail accounts, but use it with caution when trusting personal info. Google's &quot;Safe and secure Cloud Storage&quot;, that promises your info is secure, has been hacked and attacked far too often for me to trust it with ANY personal or financial information,  and as should be done with EVERY online app, login, or forum, never use easy to guess passwords, and use different passwords for every account, as well as changing them monthly. The majority of people claiming their accounts were &quot;hacked&quot; did none of the above, and more than likely disclosed passwords to people they &quot;trusted&quot;. Use common sense, and this is a wonderful birthday/anniversary calendar and appointment keeper, as well as a great shopping list.
B00729GQ0A|4.0|This book was not what I had expected it to be, but was so much more instead!  I expected a \\"simple\\" wiccan novel, but instead I found a whole world of supernaturals.  Rebecca developed the characters and the story at a great pace with a nice combination of action and backstory.  I found it easy to follow, and the characters true.  It's so rare that you find authors who give the mortal girl being thrown into the supernatural world a realistic reaction.  I loved that about this book.  I thought that Rebecca did a great job of delivering the necessary background stories as wel; they felt right and not forced or added as an afterthought.  Overall, this was a great storyline with well developed, \\"real\\" characters and I can't wait to read more!  My only negative comment is that I'm not a fan of the book's cover art.  I found the image conflicting with the description of the characters and therefore a little distracting to my mental images.  Not so much, though that I didn't want to continue reading.
141596436X|3.0|I didn't dislike this as much as the first one. On the other hand, I didn't like it as much either.<br /><br />And while I've heard this described as a police procedural and an espionage thriller, it would be more accurate to call it an anti-detective or anti-spy novel.  It's a bit silly how even the well-meaning minority of the police can't do anything without the help of crusading journalist Blomkvist (but then Blomkvist is clearly supposed to be the author's fantasy version of himself, willing and able to lay any and every woman who crosses his path).  And the intelligence agents are portrayed as inhuman monsters willing to do literally anything to maintain their own illusion of their continued relevance.<br /><br />This is the best book of the series, but really, I don't see what all the hype is about...just good marketing, I guess.

030773501X|3.0|It's interesting, from an aesthetic point of view, how Larsson makes Lisbeth Salander as unsympathetic as possible to emphasize his theme about victimization.  Her only sympathetic qualities are that she is a victim, and that she refuses to be victimized, er, lying down, so to speak.  The latter is the most appealing thing about the novels---but unfortunately, that still makes them primarily about victimization, which doesn't really appeal to me.  Two and a half stars.
B000PKX2KA|3.0|Cool device to have, I always looked to have one for my laptop. There's another brand bluetooh GPS model available online too but, priced on the higher side. This module was selling for $25 (ideal price) and now during valentine season for $35...come on...its nonsensical to have it considered as a valentine season item hence price hike.
1415957789|2.0|What a thoroughly despicable novel. I can't remember another book since (the less ambiguously misogynistic) Anna Karenina making me feel this angry and even physically ill upon finishing it.<br /><br />And not because the story involves incredible amounts of extreme sexual torture---or at least, not only or mainly because of that. I've heard a lot of people say that they had a hard time getting through it, but that the ending made it all worthwhile---but I thought the ending was the worst part!<br /><br />To be fair, I should note that most of the extreme sexual torture I referred to wasn't really graphic, just skillfully implied or referred to in past cases. And there was a decent mystery story at its core, so I can see why some people enjoyed it. I was actually enjoying it somewhat myself up to a certain point. It wasn't until close to the end, when it became inescapably clear what it was all adding up to, that I got really turned off.<br /><br />And its message is fairly subtle, albeit insidious. But it is deeply anti-masculinity, anti-heroism, anti-greatness, which is very much the opposite of my sense of life. In the end I really couldn't admire, or even relate to, any of the characters.

B004LWZW7E|2.0|Is it \\"Blade Runner\\" which also dealt with fixed lifespans? No, but then few films of this genre have ever approached that 1982 intelligent philosophical portrayal. I do give \\"In Time\\" some props for a potentially creative storyline but then it fell into the Hollywood shallow formula of cheap CGI (LCD time display embedded in the arm); foot and car chase scenes with bad guys; love interest with daddy's daughter; the usual rich selling out the poor storyline. Acting was passable OK with Timberlake a touch better. What was missing to me was greater depth-of-character and in particular the back story of how the whole time transfer and it's consequences was achieved. There's just too much dumbing down coming out of the film industry. Perhaps Hollywood et al. might show more social responsibility and put out some educative effort.
