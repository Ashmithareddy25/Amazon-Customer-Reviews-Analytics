B005L38QK2|4.0|I've been using the SteelSeries Diablo III Gaming Mouse for about a month now. I haven't been through many mice, and this is my first \\"gaming\\" mouse. Overall, I think it's a good mouse. It's plug-and-play, although you have to download software if you want to be able to assign the buttons. The UI is easy to use, allowing you to make multiple button layouts for different games. The only downside with the software is that you have to restart it every time you turn on the computer or your buttons won't be configured. Not too big of a deal though. It's also nice that the design makes the mouse both a left and right-handed without losing functionality either way, although it doesn't benefit me(right-handed) much. The cable that it comes with is made of a braided fiber which I liked and seems that it would make the cable last somewhat longer. Time will tell on this however.When playing diablo, the mouse gives me the liberty to assign all of the special moves to the the four buttons located on either side of the mouse (2 on each side). I like the idea of the buttons placement allowing the mouse to be either left or right-handed without losing any functionality, but either way, it's just too awkward pressing the button by your pinky. In order to press it comfortably, I have to lift my hand a little, which often results in me nudging the mouse causing me to be off aim. It's fine if I'm using the Monk's Mantras since I only have to activate every 3 or 10 minutes, but if the 4th move is one that is used frequently, it becomes a nuisance.<br /><br />Other than the fact that I feel like I'm only really getting 3 extra buttons, this is an excellent mouse.<br /><br />Pros:<br />-4 additional buttons (aside from the standard right, left, and middle click)<br />-Easily re-assignable buttons<br />-Good UI<br />-Left and Right hand capabilities<br />-Good quality cable<br /><br />Cons:<br />-Button by your pinky is awkward to press<br />-Have to restart application every time you restart your computer

1594484805|4.0|This book helped me reconsider my own actions and reasons for doing things, it helped me see things and people's intentions differently, and as a therapist of children with needs, it helped me be able to motivate them better and faster.  WHat more could you ask from a book really?<br /><br />So why only four stars and not five.  Well, the book, for as good as it is, has a bit of a problem staying on topic, and Daniel Pink, though, certainly, a good writer, and researcher, could've organized the book a bit better.  I think it could've been half the size (though clearly this is a small book to begin with--and still have given me all the information that I found so personally helpful.<br /><br />This book is a buy and I highly recommend it.
0061452068|5.0|The newest book, The Rational Optimist, by one of the most interesting extant authors, a biologist turned to a kind of specialised, highly informed journalism. The kind of thing you love to read. (The Red Queen, Origins of Virtue, Genome, Nature via Nurture).<br />This book elaborates more on subjects touched in his Origins of Virtue, which I found his least convincing book, which is still very convincing. He does an even better job here.<br /><br />His main thesis is that exchange, of ideas (\\"Ideas having sex\\", not a metaphore, but an astute observation), and of goods and services (but not assets and capital) create progress and prosperity, and that specialisation, division of labour, is a necessary condition. A modern Adam Smith, if you like, but even more encompassing.<br /><br />He argues convincingly that trade was the cause of agriculture and the the human cultural 'take off' . He gives a very plausible -and as far as I know the only-  explanation of the technological regress found in isolated societies such as the Tasmanians, which in turn strengthens his argument.<br />He also shows convincingly that we have been doing better all the time in increased life expectancy, reduced violence (the latter subject more extensively treated by Steven Pinker's \\"The Better Angels of our Nature\\") and prosperity.<br />He opens our eyes to the benefits of the industrial revolution and acknowledges its precursors (eg, the Dutch peat fueled trading prosperity -one would like to use 'empire\\", but he makes it clear it was the opposite of an empire). From human power to animal and plant power to dead (fossil) animal and plant power.<br />He also makes it exquisitly clear that 'self sufficiency' and subsistence farming are about synonymous with poverty. No place for 'back to the mud'.<br /><br />His treatment of the environmental movement is highly critical, but balanced. He clearly is an 'environmentalist' himself.<br />His analysis of biofuels should be read by any politician, administrator, minister, director, CEO and journalist. I knew biofuels was a bad idea, but he gave me a lot of extra ammunition.<br />His  treatment of 'Global Warming'  is a bit, how should i say it, irresponsible?, No that sounds too harsh, optimistic? Nevertheless, one should wholeheartedly agree when he says: \\"But the threats to species are all to prosaic: habitat loss, pollution, invasive competitors and hunting are the same four horsemen of the ecological apocalypse as always. Suddenly many of the big environmental organisations have lost interest in these threats as they chase the illusion of stabilising a climate that was never stable in the past. It is as if the recent emphasis on climate change has sucked the oxygen from the conservation movement.\\" Oh Yes.<br /><br />His treatment of \\"turningpointitis\\" is masterful and balanced, acid rain, exhaustion of resources, environmentally caused cancer, and even the demographic explosion dealt with in an always interesting, but decisive way.<br /><br />There are some negative points,. Although I agree that much of innovation starts in the backyard garage, in his generally justified zeal to condemn bureaucracy, state and big enterprises, he fails to mention that some of these big state sponsored projects paid off. The search for the atomic bomb -well, the knowledge acquired there-, the human genome project, the Hubble Telescope or CERN are but some examples. To be fair he does admit that the hadron collider and moon missions are too big for private companies.<br /><br />I find it somewhat strange, particularly for somebody talking about 'ideas having sex', that he does not go into memetics. Left to the imagination of the reader I guess?<br /><br />His references, agreeably ordered by page and generally sound, fail to refer some important points. Eg.' there is no decrease in sperm count'. No reference. I checked it out and indeed there is no real decrease, but I think these things should be referenced properly.<br /><br />Another negative, in fact my biggest chip, are the graphs at the start of each chapter. They are adorned with irritating,  completely unnecessary illustrations that cloud the visual of the graph. I guess that is not the author's fault, but the editor should be crucified. One of the most interesting graphs, the \\"Greenland Ice Cap Temperature from Ice Cores' stops in the year 0, about 2000 years ago, and hence omitting the part we're most interested in.<br /><br />I've been thinking of only giving 4 stars for these serious shortcomings, but this book should be read, and it is a fascinating, controversial and an agreeable read, since Ridley is not just presenting important ideas, but is a stylist of the highest order, hence 5 stars.<br />Moreover, maybe I'm not yet a Rational Optimist, but I'm definitely less pessimistic after reading this book. Who am I to grudge that fifth star?

B00535RV8Q|5.0|Paul starting over again with a solo album, Playing and singing everything with a little back up from Linda. There is about four strong songs on the album and short instrumentals that are good. Hearing what McCartney mixed together is pretty good. Momma's Miss America, Sing along Junk, Valentine's Day. Everynight, Maybe I'm Amazed, a classic for ever on the radio. That Would Be Something is so McCartney in style. Teddy Boy, started in a Beatles session. Man We Was Lonely. A good record.

B000005Z0G|5.0|2Pac's \\"Strictly 4 my..\\" has to be one of my fav. hip hop albums. What you get with this cd is some of Pac's most agressive, passionate and truest songs ever written. It starts off with the very angry, loud and intense \\"Holla if ya hear me\\", a song that makes you wanna punch someone directly in the face! \\"Point the finga\\" is another aggressive track with a neo-bass and hip hop drum sample behind it. Great track! \\"Last werdz\\" with Cube and Ice T... need i say more?!?! I really like \\"Souljah's revenge\\", one of Pac's angriest tracks. Listen and i'm sure you'll like. Despite the very crude and angry songs, Pac also shows his most emotional and poetic songs on this album aswell. Songs such as the infamous \\"Keep ya head up\\". And one of the most true songs ever written in the history of hip hop & music \\"Papaz song\\", displays the pain someone go's through growing up without a pops. Don't sleep on this album, buy it, listen and gain some knowledge. Rest In Paradise Makaveli.

0345803507|2.0|People, let's remember that this is a erotic fiction book. That being said read below.<br /><br />[1] It is going to have sex in it, lots of it. If you don't like that, then don't read it. Quit complaining about the amount of sex in a book that has been labeled \\"Mommy Porn\\". Good grief ya'll, I thought we had left our Puritan roots behind many decades ago. People enjoy sex, it is fun, and is a good form of exercise. Bonds people together in many espects. Keeps the Earth populated. Is the sex scenes in the book good? uummmm...if you want to read about a girl with no experience whatsoever meeting a fantastically awesome lover that is hotter than hot and can make her orgasm by telling her to, then by all means enjoy away. I prefer some reality with my fiction in that most women do not orgasm on command [though it can be trained if you know how], or orgasm strictly from penetration either. I did enjoy the use of various toys on occasion, and the various places where the trysts took place. Did not like the repetative nature of the lovemaking...no one orgams with fireworks going off every single time...would be nice but...not reality.<br /><br />[2] It has types of sex in it that you may not do in your own life...or like...or understand..or think should be done by anyone on the planet. Well, guess what people? BDSM is a valid and healthy choice for those that are not afraid of experiencing something that creates intense feelings, both phycially and emotionally/mentally. I do speak from experience here. I have been \\"doing\\" BDSM for almost a decade, which includes the dominant and submisive roles. It adds a level of trust to a relationship that frankly you do not get in your \\"normal\\" relationships. There are females out there that do not like to be submissive, they are more dominant, cool. It goes both ways, there are those that do like being submissive...here we have a female protagonist in the book that again has no life experience under her feet, and she gets thrown intoa relationship, which she could have said no to people, and she does not adjust well or quickly to what he wants. Go figure, 22 yers old and doesn't understand what she wants or what he wants...but yet she willing to try, to change him that is...why can't people understand that it is hard wired in to your brains to enjoy pain as well as pleasure? Did you know that physically in your brain that the center for pleasure and the one for pain are literally side by side? that they are connected? hhmmmm and maybe the Kama Sutra was not so wrong in suggestion \\"blows\\" to the behind and fleshy parts of the body to raise the blood and excitement...this is not new terriory ya'll...all the author did was to get it published and read by lots of people and have really good advertising. One last thing...when you can buy fuzzy handcuffs at the gas station convenience store at valentie's day, you know BDSM is here to stay and has come a long way...<br /><br />[3] A main issue I have is that the author makes it seem like the male protagonist is crazy for wanting what he wants. That because of his troubled childhood, he wants this. Oh and lets let the female charachter \\"handle\\" him and try to get him see the error of his ways and what he wants is wrong and it only because he was abused as a child. (bangs head on desk) Really? I didn't have a screwed up childhood, neither did my husband, and neither did my friends that I have that also enjoy this life that includes BDSM as part of our relationships. To make the conclusions that the author draws in this book, is harmful to the knowledge of the general public. Not everyone who does this is sick in the head. To allow the stereotype to flourish like this is absolutely atrocious. The APA, while still maintaining in the DSM-IV, that sadism and masochism as well as other \\"fetishes\\" are paraphilias, to most of us, it does not rise to that definition as we do not see the actions, or thoughts we have, as negatively impacting our lives. The opposite is true, it is a positive and rewarding part of our lives. I will admit that there are some people out there that have truly horrific childhoods that grow up to have serious mental concerns...but for the vast majority of those of us who are practioners thats just not true...quit judging what I do in my bedroom...and why I do it...<br /><br />{4] and Lastly, the plot of this book is so over done...girl meets rich cute guy. fall in love, lots of great sex, the end. But you know it works...why remake the wheel?<br /><br />So, if you want a somewhat badly phrased on occasion, over the top in terms of mind blowing sexual situations, in a overdone plot that oversimplifies real life situations type of a book...this one's for you kiddos.

B007N6EUHI|4.0|I find when I open the \\"regional\\" views which shows all the anatomy in layers, my kindle fire freezes. I suppose it's too much information loading at once. Im a little disappointed that in the skeletal views it only names the bone that you highlight. It would be nice if it named all the parts of bone. For instance the radius being mad up of the radial head, neck, radial tuberosity and the styloid process. But that's just really nitpicking. I work in Radiology so I thought this would help me brush up on skeletal anatomy. Still, it is a good app and I don't regret the purchase.

B008I34ZFW|4.0|The movie starts out with serious potential then it sort of levels out. Still a good movie for those who enjoy Sci-fi, but keep in mind that it's a satirical comedy also. Don't be surprise some one does a redo of this flick in a few years with a big budget, extra effects and big star names behind it.
B0068MNO4S|2.0|Okay, I am a bit of a bardophile, so I was looking forward to watching this.  I like to see the bard and his works talked about from any number of different angles.  But if this movie had been a stool, it would be missing all but one leg.  The images were compelling and the other visual historical details were compelling (excepting visual historical mistakes, such as the singed cover of \\"Henry V\\" from the ashes of the theater, because the play had been performed before Edward's death).  Otherwise, the movie was a lumbering, clumsy, vindictive, pile of preposterousness.  God only knows why the anti-Shakespearean theories continue (although James Shapiro attempts to explain that in his book, \\"Contested Will\\"), but only deluded conspirators could find much to love in this.  The evidence to support Shakespeare is considerable and beats anything that I have seen from the opposition.  Still, this movie would just have been little more than a conspirator's delight had the movie leaked so much internally.<br /><br />For instance, Derek Jacobi, the actor, tells the audience that William had only a grammar school education.  But then the film portrays him as illiterate.  So which is it?  And of course, we can historically document the first claim, but the not the second.  What purpose would the claim of illiteracy (and to portray Shakespeare as a feckless, money-grubbing buffoon, again, without evidence) serve except to rev up the base of true believers.  If you're in a battle, it isn't enough to defeat your opponent; you must humiliate him as wel...<br /><br />It also made Queen Elizabeth -- by all accounts a brilliant and cunning leader -- a credulous pawn of the Cecils, and blinkered ruler in general.  And yet again, the producers employed the humiliation strategy, coming with a preposterous and completely unfounded calumny toward the queen and pitiful William.  Do the producers have Oedipal issues, perhaps?  It also doesn't make sense that the Earl would give into Shakespeare's blackmail either.  Isn't the Earl supposed to be so much more clever than anyone else?  Then why would he consent to pay WS?  WS has no bargaining leverage to speak of.  If he does what he threatens, he would lose everything (probably including his life).  This is Elizabethan England.  The Earl could have WS vanish, mafia-like, in no time and then simply find someone else to replace him (it was clear from the movie: any idiot could have done the job).<br /><br />The acting was also unconvincing.  Was any audience member able to see the Earl as the author of some of the most beautiful, heartfelt prose in the world, especially the most romantic and sublime verses?  Moreover, a key assumption that the antishakespeareans make is that one can only write what one knows (a literary fashion mistake from the Romantic period); so, it goes, WS was not high enough born and well enough connected to know so much about kings and courts.  Somehow the Earl of Oxford fits this bill better.  But then the Oxfordians put the noose around their own necks with the charge, because WS ALSO wrote many characters from the peasant side -- and many in the middle.  How could that noble Earl know so much about them?<br /><br />It's sad that this type of mularkey continues, with little more than wild speculation and willed blindness to evidence to keep it going, and that so many credulous have been pulled in.  Okay, it deserves as much of a place in the public conversation as creationism, anti-global warming, and Obama birthplace debates.  Crackpot ideas will be around as long as there are crackpots.  But this film isn't even for them!

B00843EDGC|5.0|Have you ever ran across a book that totally engrossed you but find almost impossible to classify? BEAUTIFUL DISASTER is that book for me. Good thing that writing reviews tends to clarify my thoughts though with this book it is hard not to give away too much of the story.<br /><br />Ms. McGuire has done a wonderful overall job with BEAUTIFUL DISASTER. The pacing is spot on with just enough slower scenes to give the reader a chance to catch their breath. The dialogue flowed easily and really reminded me of some college age people that I know. And the characters are very realistic with their hopes, dreams and fears.<br /><br />Travis and Abby's relationship is like watching a train wreck about to happen yet it is impossible to look away and to not cheer them on. This tension is what keeps the reader totally engrossed in the story. I found BEAUTIFUL DISASTER impossible to put down as I had to know what was going to happen next.<br /><br />I am still not sure how to classify this book. Normally based on the ages of Abby and Travis I would go with young adult however there is a lot of underage drinking, sex and violence that parents do need to be aware of.<br /><br />I do rate this book a 4.75.<br /><br />*** I received this book at no charge from NetGalley in exchange for a fair and honest review. All opinions expressed within are my own.
0345803493|5.0|The book arrived sooner than expected and the price was excellent.  This book, like the first was addictive and very entertaining.  The characters were fleshed out even more and the plot was laid out so the third book is highly expected.  This book has more romance than the first book and because of that, in my opinion is more enjoyable.

B008EEWN6I|1.0|Hey fellow 99%ers, what's going on? I wouldn't say I'm a very opinionated/involved person in politics or economics or anything outside of what's hip, so leave it to Serj Tankian to keep me up to speed on what's going on and who're the bad guys, because no one can relate to the working class quite like an eccentric millionaire rockstar! Serjie has always had the tough life, see he has some Armenian blood, so obviously he is the voice destined to channel the hardships of the Armenian genocide that happened 90 years ago, so it's only right he talks for everyone about fresh and original topics such as \\"WE'RE PUPPETS TO THE CORPORATIONS\\" or \\"YOU ALL R STUPID AND I'M THE SMARTEST CUZ I HAVE A GUITAR!\\".<br /><br />Serj Tankian will no doubt fall into the graces with other amazing political bands such as the Dixie Chicks, Screwdriver, or Axl Rose. Because remember: priviledged middle-aged white people REALLY know how the world works, and we're totally buying their albums because of their message and not that annoying musicianship in the background. So remember to vote democrat next election time, because that'll solve all our problems!

0307592731|4.0|I know a lot of people who are backpackers and I think that this book is disappointing to the backpacking crowd because it is scary to look at anyone starting off on such a trip, that poorly prepared and so very unready. If however, instead of a trail story, you are looking for a story of hitting bottom and finding the energy and motivation to hoist yourself up and try something, anything, to get you out of the rut and into a new life, then there is much to enjoy and admire here. She is not a bad writer, or storyteller, although there were many times when I wanted to slap her for doing some of the stupidly dangerous things that she did, I also admired her honesty in facing her mistakes in front of the whole world, and I admit, there were times her honesty brought tears of self recognition to my eyes as well. I'm not sure I would ever have read this if not for the Oprah hype and the fact that a backpacking friend gave it to me once she finished. The hardcover was well out of my price range, and thanks to Oprah, the line at the library is long.<br /><br />Would I recommend this book to anyone? Well, I just did. And I'm putting it in the mail to another friend today, just warning, She was really messed up and it is more the story of that than it is the story of the PCT.

B007MNV5WU|5.0|awesome the best one yet I think but you should make some cheats because some are hard and others are harder
B00011CZRE|4.0|Last night's bargain-rack movie was \\"Seven\\" starring Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman. I found it on the five-dollar rack at Wal-Mart. It's the story of a vicious sadistic serial killer. Brad Pitt plays a rookie (in this particular police division) and Morgan Freeman plays a veteran detective who is scheduled to retire in a week and both, together, are in pursuit of the insane killer as he selects his victims according to the seven deadly sins. It's a strange mixture of insanity and religious fervor, I suppose. Will they track him down and put an end to his grisly practice?<br /><br />The movie is exceptionally well acted. Morgan Freeman does a convincing job, as I would expect from viewing him in other movies. The surprise was Brad Pitt. I have viewed him as a lightweight and in this movie he does just a splendid job of acting. The other characters are competent. The filming is rather good. The sound is just so-so as the background noise tends to drown out a lot of conversations.<br /><br />Well, it's a quite good movie, but I didn't care for it. There's just an overwhelming amount of gore and grisly scenes. Some of the footage is just stomach churning. What' the point? If a person is dead and shown to be dead, why examine the rotting corpse in detail? I suppose in some instances it might make sense, but with this movie it went way, way over the line. Even though it's a good movie, I would not want to watch it again. Furthermore, I would advise people that if they are sensitive to really grisly scenes, perhaps this is a movie to ignore. But, it's your dime, and it's a worthy movie.<br /><br />Gary Peterson

B0083H6AQA|4.0|All the actors here do a nice job in this costume drama/period piece set in 1890.  Pattinson plays the at first appealing and later very unpleasant writer who seduces married women and then leaves them when the relationship is no longer convenient or hidden.  You will wonder why one of them is smiling mysteriously at the end when he goes off with yet another one.

1401223176|3.0|Perhaps the problem is that I went in expecting of the caliber of the killing joke, but I was somewhat disappointed by this collection. On one hand, the art was good, and it was well written, but on the other hand, I just didn't find it that interesting. Admittedly, some of it comes down to me not having much connection to the Batman universe beyond the Arkham games and the Nolan films, but I just could not get interested in the main villain. I didn't think the final showdown was all that epic, and I thought his motive was just terribly executed.

B007SGM084|4.0|I've only read the first 24 chapters of Shades of Grey, I haven't completed the trilogy yet, but so far so good. Everyone wants a man like Christian (one of the main character's). He's mysterious and sexy. The main female character comes across as your average American girl. You definitely want to insert yourself into some the steamy love scenes. I'm looking forward to rest of the trilogy.

It ties in so many fun things from the show that you actaully feel like you jumped in to the world of Perry! The levels are so fun while still making you use your brain to figure out how to get the water to Perry! All I got to say is I found Perry!
B007SAKSF2|5.0|\\"THIS IS THE NEXT CENTURY....\\"<br /><br />Whenever a box set comes out, I approach it with caution. Let's face it, these things can be costly. However, let's really think about what you're getting here. Over the past three to five years, we've seen box sets around this price that are commemorating JUST ONE SINGLE ALBUM! Pearl Jam \\"Ten\\", The Who's Quadrophenia, etc. However, here you have 97% of their output... in beautifully designed packages, and the sound is spectacular. So, in this review, I'll discuss the content, and try to silence the skeptics.<br /><br />First, I've read a lot of \\"But I already have all this stuff. Why would you need it?\\"<br /><br />A - Standards, first of all. If you are a casual fan and don't care about the bonus material, this isn't targeted at you anyway. Second, if you primarily listen to music on the free earbuds that come with your iPhone, well, you may not care about remastering. HOWEVER, for those of you that love music and love Blur and have standards, the remastering came out spectacularly!<br /><br />Frank Arkwright is AGAINST the Loudness Wars and he does NOT \\"Just make things louder\\". He sonically improves things. He did a fantastic job with The Smiths' catalogue, and has done it again with this one! It's not just louder.<br /><br />PLEASE LET ME EXPLAIN WHAT REMASTERING IS:  They take the original MASTER tapes, and use MODERN 2012 technology to create a new master. That's what happens when you do it properly. Frank Arkwright is an engineer who does original masters too. He knows this stuff. When the artist or producer isn't involved, and when they hire some unqualified record company schlub to remaster, you may get them simply running a CD mix through an equalizer and pumping up the volume. This  isn't the case here. They remastered the songs from the original master tapes. The albums say they're remastered - the demos and bonuses don't specify it. However, most of the bonus material is being mastered for the first time, rght?Make sense? Well, last thing, remastering is NOT remixing! They're not remixing anything! I don't know why people don't get this. This isn't a remix. The sonic improvement is great!<br /><br />You get all of the albums in their original UK release form. This means, the UK version of \\"LEISURE\\" had the track \\"Sing\\", so it's included here on the album, but did not contain \\"I Know\\", so it isn't included on CD 1. Instead, it's included on the bonus CD. Same goes for \\"Modern Life Is Rubbish\\". In the U.S., ours had bonus tracks like the Single-only release \\"POPSCENE\\". Like \\"I Know\\", \\"Popscene\\" is now on the Bonus disc. Also important to point out is the fact that the version of \\"Chemical World\\" we had in the U.S. was never the original UK version. It was a re-recording for the U.S. I actually preferred this re-recorded version, and the vocal is completely different. But it isn't included here. You get the original U.K. album version and the UK single \\"Re-worked version\\".<br /><br />Apart from these details, it all sounds wonderful. Songs like \\"Fade Away\\", \\"Best Days\\" and \\"Yuko and Hiro\\", all from THE GREAT ESCAPE, have all been given new life. The breaking bottles that open the track \\"Parklife\\" appear as though they're breaking around your feet. Does it sound like that on your 1\\" HP Computer speakers? How could it? Your crappy free iPhone earbuds? No. On GOOD speakers? It's fantastic!<br /><br />You don't get EVERYTHING, like The Who cover \\"Substitute\\", but... you get all you'd ever want as even the most diehard fan.<br /><br />Some more specifics about the box:<br />The box is a fabric-covered, sturdy box that perfectly fits all of the albums and bonus discs. Each album is presented in a Mini-LP Digipak CD with Disc one in one end, and Disc two (Bonuses) in the other side. These are beautiful. You get two bonus 2-CD albums of Rarities from each Era. Example, CD 1: Seymour and Leisure Rarities, CD 2, Modern Life Is Rubbish Rarities - and so forth. The final bonus RaritiesCD includes \\"Fool's Day\\" and \\"Under The Westway\\". You get 3 DVDs that cover 3 live shows from different eras of the band. These are great to have and are not available individually. These DVDs are all REGION 0, NTSC.<br /><br />Let me be clear: there is just one edition of this box. It's on FOOD/Parlophone Records (EMI). There isn't a risk of the DVDs not playing in your country. The DVD isn't formatted with a region restriction. They work on ANY Player, whether cheap or expensive, on your PS3 too, wherever you may be in the world. They look and sound great and they do NOT have a UK version in PAL, and a U.S. version in NTSC. NTSC works in the UK and everywhere else. You're not limited to watching DVDs on your computer.<br /><br />You get the Seymour 7\\" single \\"Superman\\" inserted nearly in the box alongside a sturdy, full-color 7\\" x 7\\" hardback book. You also get a download code to download all of these songs (except \\"Superman\\" curiously) in 320kbps MP3 form, and you can download bonus songs and PDFs and even get a 10% off discount code from the Blur shop so you can buy that expensive yet cool throwback t-shirt you once impressed the girls with in the 90's. They have new shirts and stuff, too.<br /><br />This set is essential for any Blur fan. You already have this stuff? Upgrade! The sound and bonuses are well worth it. Trade those old crappy versions of the CDs you have into your local record shop and apply it to your favorite Blur Vinyl Re-issue. Those, too, are gorgeous. The NEW CDs in this box look identical to the original issues, with the Food/Parlophone logo on each. The CD covers too have those logos (It's NOT on Virgin. My box says Virgin nowhere on it.)<br /><br />If you truly are a Blur fan, this is well worth the dough! They were uniquely British and that served me well in the 90s when everyone was trying so hard to sound grunge/American. I'm proud to be American, but give me some originality! Were they the best British Band? It's tough to put them above early Suede or 90s PULP, but they're incredibly inventive and amongst the best ever - and if you feel this way about Graham and Damon and the boys, you will LOVE this set.<br /><br />A side note: the individual CD Re-issues come in a bonus lift-off box and postcards that have each single's artwork. This box, in order to fit everything, does NOT include that bonus box or postcards. However, I don't miss it and would rather have the DVDs and Rarities discs that aren't available separately!<br /><br />FINALLY, on a very limited basis, there's an Incredible FREE, yes FREE, BLUR app for the iPad and iPhone. Grab it while you can! It has interviews for all of the albums and eras. The videos show them in 1992, and throughout the years, discussing each album, and interviews from NOW too. It also includes EVERY Blur music video! All for FREE!  It's a great time to be a Blur fan...
B0070NSPCU|5.0|Don't hesitate, give it a chance - it's amazing.  Anthony Ryan has given himself a high ceiling with the promise of his first book in the series.  I can't wait for the next one!
B006LSZECO|4.0|So far the book has kept me guessing.  Like the format of seeing into each of the characters thoughts.  Can't wait to find time to finish it!
B008BM9L72|2.0|Heard about this and bought without realising what the books were!  However, I read avidly wanting to get to the end.<br /><br />Very disappointed with the story and not even that sure that the explicit scenes were enough.  Lacked in build up to the final acts.<br /><br />Surprised as how long the epilogue was.  Thought it would never finish.<br /><br />Definitely would not read a second time around but would not want to put anyone off reading it - not for literary content - but for pure entertainment and something to talk about.  Okay for holiday reading.
B007ADIRDM|5.0|I purchased this item for my 12 year old daughter who is obsessed with Monster High dolls. It arrived on time and in excellant condition. The item was packaged well for shipping and I have no real complaints. The furniture is basically plastic, with the exception of the cardboard backing for the shelf. This seems to be the standard for toys now days. I believe it is durable enough and will provide many days of fun for my daughter. I gave this item 5 stars because it was a steal. The fact that it also included the doll made it a huge bargain! I have spent so much money on the dolls alone that I was excited to find some of the furniture with a doll for such a reasonable price!
B007L3BMGA|1.0|Purchased out of interest; bored to death after ten pages. This book is total rubbish from beginning to end - even the sex scenes are tedious, repetitive and cliche-ridden. Characters absolutely unconvincing, writing clumsy and immature.
031620157X|5.0|Simply put: this is now one of my favorite books.<br /><br />I am almost 20 and I pre-ordered 2 copies of this book, one for me and one for my sister's 16th birthday in May. We anxiously awaited the release for 2 months and were not let down. We both read the book (simultaneously) in about 4-5hrs because it is nearly impossible to put down. Both of the main characters are easy to relate to and are surprisingly well developed in a short amount of time. This book is unique because the original thoughts and storyline were written by 10yo Chris but eloquently dictated and elaborated by 20yo Chris. Chris did an amazing job at writing in a way that appeals to readers young and old and I can't wait to read more of his work.<br /><br />Honestly, I would recommend this book to anybody...read it to your young kids and they will love the magic and wonder, give it to your middle/high school aged children as a coming of age novel to help through those awkward years of discovering who you are, give it to adults and they will learn that nobody is too cool/old for fairy tales.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Didn't know what to expect....so much hype. After reading some of the reviews I was leary and only purchased book one. I was enthralled from the first chapter. As a matter of fact, I am currently looking for a \\"black\\" Mr. Grey! (without the spanking)LOL
034580404X|2.0|After all the hype about these books, I finally sucumbed and purchased them..unfortunately they do not live up to it at all. I found the writing style to be stilted and very repetitive and the characterisation of the leads to be undeveloped. These books have been labled \\"Mummy Porn\\" or female erotic fiction but I found the sex scenes to be highly unrealistic and aimed more to a male audience than female...at halfway through book 2 I found myself skipping them becaus they were so boring!...and if I read or hear about anyones \\"inner godess\\" again I might scream!!!!<br />If you are new to erotic fiction these books will be fine...but if like me you are an avid reader you will be mightily disappointed..

B003O86FMW|5.0|Awesome.  Could not put it down.  My granddaughter and I were reading this at the same time and both loved it.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|With all the hype for this book I was expecting an interesting read.  Well not so much!  The book is not well written, so much so that it took longer than necessary to get through it.  If you're reading it for the sex, again not so much.  There is one decent section but after that it falls down fast.

The author Mike, also answers all of the emails you send him, which is a nice added bonus. I HIGHLY recommend buying this book.
B000FCJZ3G|5.0|I am still reading the book but I find it to be very helpful for me to stay focus. I have read a ton of books but this one offers some great words of wisdom.  I currently have my own business and in the process of building my brand.  I was hesitant about ordering the book but I found other reviews to be good as well.  Good and Quick read.
B008CPBB0I|5.0|Movie was great and story was inspiring and true.  Director needs to do more research on Alaska before filming on Alaska.  Not all Native Americans have the same accent.  The Navaho accent on the Inupiac elder was made a serious scene comical.
0374203032|5.0|I came to this book without any foreknowledge on the issues raised or of the author's previous work. The brief description on Amazon's web site grabbed my interest. The author of this book is Michael Sandel, he is a professor of politics at Harvard; his first worldwide hit was with his last book, Justice, the subject of a famous lecture course at Harvard. His new book, What Money Can't Buy, is a study of &#34;the moral limits of markets&#34;.<br /><br />Call me naïve and uninformed, but as delved into the book I began to find some rather disturbing facts, I never realised that organizations such as Wal-Mart had taken out hundreds of thousands of insurance policies on employees, where they were the beneficiary, so every time one of these employees' died, Walmart enjoyed a bonus. This type of policy was better known in the media as dead peasants insurance. These policies are forms of what the insurance industry calls Stoli, or &#34;stranger originated life insurance&#34; - in other words, an insurance policy taken out on your life by someone else, not on your behalf but on theirs.<br /><br />Another type of insurance that was initially very popular with investors was the creation and evolution of `viaticals', and quote from Wiki `The early victims of AIDS in the U.S. were largely gay men, many of whom were not particularly old. They often had no wives or children (the traditional beneficiaries under a life insurance policy), but they had life insurance policies through employment or as a result of investments. The beneficiaries under the policies were often their parents who did not need the money. Viatical settlements offered a way to extract value from the policy while the policy owner was still alive' to pay for care and medical treatment. In the early years, of the disease being identified, life expectancy for people with full blown AIDS was very low, so investors did very well. These are just some the examples where Markets have evolved since the 1980s.<br /><br />Sandel work is both focused and paced; there is this no ideological bias or political tilt in his writing. Rather<br />Sandel writes in his book, &#34;Markets - and market values - have come to govern out lives as never before.&#34; Do we in society wish to see markets, where everything is up for sale? Or should there be areas, where there are certain moral and community goods/services, where markets forces do not apply and where money should not be able to buy. For me it was a thought provoking read and somewhat of an eye opener, where we need to take interest in the ways markets are focused and developed./>Sandel work is both focused and paced; there is this no ideological bias or political tilt in his writing.

B003R0LBVW|4.0|This book is an honest and sometimes upsetting look into the human emotions that all of us feel yet do not talk about. Franzen writes in detail about the thoughts that many of us wish we didn't have and the actions they sometimes lead to.<br /><br />At points the book seems long and I admit there were moments when I questioned whether I wanted to finish but you do become attached to the characters and want to find out what will happen next.

1935251740|2.0|ok I'm down with this idea, that the physical universe is evolved from consciousness but this book could have been condensed to a few pages - yes, physics has entered the realm of the nonprovable but so is this theory - yes, you can ask what happened before the big bang but you can also ask what happened before consciousness - the premise 'biology is primary' has been around for several millennia - this book is 95% why current thought won't arrive at the ultimate answer' but this book provides no alternative to derive the answers that conventional scientific thought is struggling with - human evolution has always had to take into account unanswered questions - the real question is whether the questions themselves can ever be answered or are we confined to a lineage of paradigm shifts

B0071XO8RA|5.0|-- about this book!  I have to say the title threw me off a little and I wasn't sure if this was something I'd enjoy, but thought I'd give it a try since it had a avg. 5 star rating from some 1500 people. And wow! It was hard for me to even put the book down to go to sleep at night, and when I finally did, I was having dreams (and, yes, sometimes nightmares) about this book.<br /><br />Great book! love how you get to view the story from multiple characters. I love how attached I became to those characters.  I laughed, I cried, and I absolutely cannot wait to read more.

0307474259|3.0|Taubes says that \\"weight and nutrition are entirely separate\\".  \\"One can be obese and malnourished at the same time\\".  So malnourishment isn't caused by improper nutrition or malabsorption of nutrient...which would lead to weight gain or loss? I firmly think there are some mixed up points and ideas in this book. There are some correct ideas here, but offset by the not so correct ideas. My thoughts after working in the nutrition field for over 20 years.

0345803485|4.0|What's with all the long negative rants playing at being a critical review? It appears everyone's reviews are mirrors of each other in a way that looks more like a well organized anti- sex group trying to dispel would be readers.<br />I read the book with the understanding it was not reality of sex in the real world, if reality was what people want, read your own journal.<br />Erotica is meant to be an escape, and this was an escapist novel from the point of view of a young women. Did it feel immature? It should, unless you are also an inexperienced women without emotional stability in a relationship with an overachiever with dysfunctional history. Maybe it's because I am a therapist for children and adolesents, but she seems age appropriate to me. However it does not feel like the life of a well adjusted adult with a sexual partner whom respects them and an ability to laugh at the natural humor of two naked bodies attempting to collide gracefully day after day.-
B00014NE62|5.0|The only thing that bothered me while watching this movie is that it took me so long to discover it. This film really had an effect on me like no other movie ever has. By the first third of the movie, I had already fallen in love with the main character (Maurice) and by the end of the movie, I was left with a smile and a heartache at the same time. When compared to films like Brokeback Mountain, I found this film a much more accurate portrayal of two men struggling with their love for one another and that magical first time when their feelings are revealed. A scene where one the characters softly strokes the hair of the other was so much more intense and realistic than the explicit sex scene that served as the ice-breaker in the aforementioned film. I do think the alternate ending speech by Maurice in the deleted scenes would have made a better conclusion. But this film is a masterpiece none the less. I am curious how many other films on Amazon have 120 reviews and are completely void of any 1-star reviews (or 2-star reviews for that matter).  I think that says a lot.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|I am young, and I was in a serious relation. Unfortunately, I messed it up. Then I found this book, and now I understand a lot more and know how to love a girl with her language, I wish I read this book 2 years ago. It is really good and make sense, it is probably the most worthy book I ever read. No matter you have a wonderful relation or not, you should read it, it only help you make your relation better and understand your partner more.
B0083GQKQG|2.0|When one thinks of mentally ill, disturbed, introverted psychopaths.  A heart-throbish looking teenager who prances around in shirts 3 sizes too small with a \\"too cool for the room\\" delivery is not what usually comes to mind.  Did his parents never buy him any shirts after the age of 5 and that's why he snapped?  I know that in movies you have to suspend the expectation of realism sometimes.  But in drama (unless it's presented as a surrealistic film) you want to have some believable characters which this movie lacks in a big way.

B005JABU82|5.0|This was a gift for a good friend of mine. A great gundam fan himself. I was looking for a really realistic model since he has some gundam models of lower grade already.<br />I write this review after he finished it, and he was really excited by the internal skeleton and the final mobility it allows, not to mention the fuselage details on each piece. For the price I paid and the final product, this model exceeded all my expectations.
B007XKEY6Q|4.0|draw something is fun... but there r some things that suck about it. one is that in between every round there is an add and somethimes more than one. the adds take a long time before you can continue to play the game. another thing is that if you buy a color packet with your coins then it oliminates some other colors...... like i dont have any browns anymore because i purchased a different color packet.... otherwise this game is fun and entertaining!!!
0439023483|2.0|The Hunger Games:<br /><br /> I'm one of those people who doesn't like to conform and jump on bandwagons when society comes up with these trends that come and go. When I read the syllabus and found out that I had to read the Hunger Games I was not too thrilled, but was slightly interested to see who this Katniss character was. I thought this book was interesting but not all that it was cracked up to be. I wasn't sure how I felt about it but I couldn't stop reading because I needed to find out what happened. It was hard for me to think into the future and how America could ever end up like that.<br /> My favorite parts were reading about the thirteen colonies and how the story flashed forward into the future. I was interested in reading about the government and how overpowering they were to send people to fight for their lives. This part of the story was very relatable especially with the upcoming elections and ads on tv. Sometimes I feel like the government now is like that. I felt myself getting emotional during the game makers and when people were chosen. When Katniss takes her sisters place I felt like I was right there with her. I wondered if I could ever do that for my sister and if she would ever do that for me. I also liked the romance between Peeta and Prim. I liked the role reversal and how they played opposite gender personalities. Katniss was strong and Peeta was open.<br /> I really did not like reading about the love triangle between Katniss, Peetas, and the guy from her district. I also couldn't get to like Katniss; she was very self absorbed and that made it hard for me to like her. I was really quite horrified by the concept of killing people to gain food for their district. The whole killing concept was really depressing and made me anxious. At times I felt like I was reading a bad newspaper article. I'm not too sure why this book didn't appeal to me because I know that I am the minority of the population who didn't like it. I also did not like howthe author left out descriptions of the characters. I found this rather hard to envision what these characters looked like and therefore made it hard for me to picture the story playing out in my head. I couldn't tell you the setting or what the district looks like. I feel like these are main points that make a story a story.<br /> I believe the main concepts of this book are about coming of age rituals and the adolescent years. But this book shows struggles that adolescents face and how they overcome them. This story showed how a girl became a woman and how she has to make decisions and choices in a crazy world. She's forced to grow up and make adult decisions and hold responsibility. Sometimes, in our society, adults think that adolescents are not capable of making these types of decisions.  I also could relate to this story because Katniss and her district were the poorest and their struggles could relate to Appalachia.
B006WXW098|2.0|It begins with title: customers are being led to connect with some really great piano repertoire: a fantasy by Mozart; Schumann's great Fantasy in C Major or his fabulous &#34;Fantasy Pieces&#34;; one of Beethoven's two Fantasy Sonatas, Op. 27, including the `Moonlight&#34;; Schubert's &#34;Wanderer&#34; Fantasy; Chopin's Fantasy in F Minor or Polonaise-Fantasy; or Brahms' set of Op. 116 Fantasies.<br />Alas, no. Indeed, there is very little great music on this CD, which is made up largely of encore pieces, mostly transcribed, either by some composer-pianist or, even by Wang herself (without express acknowledgment,though).<br />There are just a barely handful of truly great works: Chopin's Waltz in C-sharp minor, Liszt's transcription of &#34;Gretchen at the Spinning Wheel&#34; and the Sgambati transcription of Gluck's &#34;Dance of the Blessed Spirits.&#34;<br />Come on, who needs a piano transcription of the Paul Dukas' &#34;The Sorcerer's Apprentice?<br />Of course, it makes this CD's title more reminiscent of the Walt Disney cartoon movie &#34;Fantasia&#34;, but definitely not the mystical and expansive genre that evolved out of the formally structured sonata.<br />Wang`s wondrous keyboard skills are still evident. In her four Rachmaninoff pieces (3 Etudes Tableaux and an Elegie), she travels in no time from quiet calmness to thunderous volume. The single Scarlatti Sonata in G Major, K. 455, still shows a wonderful sense of articulation, line and clarity, despite the unnecessarily fast tempo chosen by Wang.<br />The five early Chopin-like Scriabin preludes and poem, which she opened her Carnegie Hall debut with, show a masterly fluidness and lyricism as well as a refreshing transparency. Each single aspect of her astounding virtuoso technique is evident.<br />Then, disappointingly, we get Horowitz instead of any great composer: the Bizet-Horowitz &#34;Carmen&#34; Variations, Saint-Saens' &#34;Danse Macabre&#34; a la Horowitz and a transcription of Strauss' &#34;Tritsch-Tratsch&#34; Polka.<br />But, pray, why another Horowitz?<br />Junk food may be fun for a while, but they are a terrible thing on which to waste a major new talent. Whats more, this kind of repertoire plays into the perception of Wang as a shallowy glitzy and overtly dressy light-weight, much more glamor than substance -- which SHOULD NOT be the case.<br />This is definitely NOT a CD I would want to put on and listen through, though occasionally one may want to hear a piece or two at a time, but definitely NOT as 'the' interpretation, given the liberties Wang give to the original scores.<br />In short, A-plus for pianism and a D-minus for music.<br />In her next outing, bets are on the Prokofiev Third Concerto - coupled to a Prokofiev Sonata - which she has performed and which is perfectly suited to her, as recent reviews proved again. Let's hope that with an orchestral piece, she would behave herself better.Tritsch-Tratsch&#34; Polka.<br />But, pray, why another Horowitz?<br />Junk food may be fun for a while, but they are a terrible thing on which to waste a major new talent.

B005H8DEMG|3.0|This is Julie Taymor's second attempt at a Shakespeare film. \\"Titus\\" was an obscure work that she performed visual wonders with. But she could not make up for the bad story of the play itself. This time she goes after \\"The Tempest\\" which has the opposite problem. Its a great piece of writing, but its difficult (if not impossible) to successfully adapt it to film.<br /><br />Its not that its bad. Its \\"ok\\" in the same way that previous adaptations have been ok. Its not a work that lends itself to Taymor's particular skills and she seems too respectful of the play to take real chances with it. And she was probably right in the reaction to her taking chances with it would have been extremely negative from most.<br /><br />She changed the gender of Prospero (now Prospera). But thats nothing special. Vanessa Redgrave did it over a decade ago and did it better. Whatever Helen Mirren's strengths as an actress, she isn't really suited to the part in my opinion. She could work as Queen Lear, but Prospera just doesn't fit to me. Djimon Hounsou as Caliban is a disaster. He doesn't have the acting experience to pull off what is a very critical part. Russell Brand works but only because he is doing a limited supporting character suited to his skills.<br /><br />The acting in the film is rather disjointed. There is no unifying style or vision to it from a dramatic point of view. I would suspect (but can't know) that the director let the actors go their own way for the most part.<br /><br />The music wasn't bad. The visuals were ok for the most part but not up to whats expected of Taymor. I give her credit for taking on (again) a difficult Shakespeare work that many would shy away from. Credit where it is due, by the low standards of Tempest adaptations, she has done very well.<br /><br />My initial reaction was one star but during the course of writing the review I changed my mind (twice!) finally giving it three stars. In the end, its flaws to me are more the various limitationsof the people involved in creating it and that of great ambition.
034580404X|4.0|Interesting to say the least. I find it amazing that writers have such wild imaginations. I enjoyed Fifty Shades Darker more than I did Grey, story was starting to take shape and Freed was the best of them all. Will be interested to see what the author comes up with next! Can't wait for the movie!!!
034580404X|3.0|If I said the books were great it would be a lie, but if I said they were awful I would also be lying. I loved Fifty Shades of Grey which is book #1, it was something new and exciting. Imagine, I read it in two days! Book# 2 took me a little longer, it was less attracting, more blah, blah , blah, but wasn't that bad. Now book # 3, OMG I just skimmed it because I wanted to know how the story ended. Don't get me wrong, book #3 has its moment, but it's almost at the end. To be honest it is not worth 30 bucks and I really think this should had been a single book, instead of stretching the story for three.  The books also have errors, yup more than one, these books needed more editing before coming out! Oh and one more thing, the author used the same words so many time that I thought my eyes would burn if I saw them again. I also think she used a synonyms thesaurus, and didnt really pick the appropriate words. Shame on the publishing house for letting so many things pass unnoticed.

0061537934|5.0|I didn't even know why I picked up this book. I am a pet lover but I know nothing about racing nor remotely even interested in cars. All those technical terms are confusing and I can't relate to any of those (famous) drivers.<br />Many aspects of the book are exaggerated, some may call them cheap thrills: wife has brain tumor, evil in-laws suing custody for the only child, framed for wrongdoing when he is innocent(That girl is a predator!) and some suspicious Mongolian dog burial rituals (Are they even real?)<br />Yet, I love this book.<br />Remember this is from the view of a dog, not human.<br />We human always ask why but many times there is no why and there shouldn't be one. The unanswered is what makes life LIFE.<br />Enzo is a dog who thinks like a human. He knows he is not like other dogs. He knows he has a purpose and when he fulfills his purpose, his soul will relinquish the shell. He is not afraid to be free because he knows he will and ready to reincarnate as human. He trains himself to develop human-like traits, such as counting number and the alphabets. However, he retains some of his ancestor's merits. He observes people and his surroundings, and often he can see it clearer than his human companions. Unfortunately, or fortunately, his long canine tongue can only muffles a few simple sounds. Many times he wishes his human companions could learn from him how to observe and there will be no need for verbal communication (body language says it all!)<br />I agreed with some reviewers that the ending is a bit predictable. But it is the perfect ending for Enzo. Enzo is tired and he can go no further. But he also is a gentleman who keeps his promises. His promise to Eve to protect Danny and Zoe (probably from her overbearing parents), to Danny he will be there for Zoe and Eve (from the evil zebra!), and lastly to Danny and Enzo himself to be friends forever. Instead of escaping death, he embraces it. He knows, unlike his human master, death is part of life. And along the way, there are hopes, friendship, perseverance, forgiveness and love. Enzo takes his time to enjoy his journey, with all the important people in his life, just like he loves walking with Danny. Finally when Danny reliefs Enzo from his \\"binding contract\\", he is free from his shell and ready to go on another journey. And when he is ready, which he will be, he will reincarnate into a human, who he wants to be one all along.<br />Maybe it is the canine instinct in me. I like to stick my nose to every single place (in the book), turning leaves on the ground, under every single dirt and to enjoy the multitudes of scents, colors, sounds, and life! A good book can make the readers resonant with the writer. Within those few hundred papers, the writer tries to connect with us, to let us know what is going on inside of his head, to have our emotions in sync.<br />I think this book has served its purpose well.d along the way, there are hopes, friendship, perseverance, forgiveness and love.

It really felt like it was trying to copy Fifty Shades but it didn't even come close. I had never read a book by this author and don't think I will be reading anymore. It was just unoriginal.I did finish it, and some parts where good but overall it was lacking.

B005ZOBNOI|5.0|\\"Sometimes, you read a book and it fills you with this weird evangelical zeal, and you become convinced that the shattered world will never be put back together unless and until all living humans read the book.\\" - Hazel Grace Lancaster<br /><br />I hate to start my review with the same quote everyone else starts their review with, but there is a reason they do. This quote is exactly how I feel about The Fault In Our Stars. I have a book hangover, the worst one I have ever had after reading a book. This book has changed me and the way I look at life. How often do you read a book and feel that way? It has only happened to me 3, now 4, times. This book is now my favorite book of all time.<br /><br />16 year old Hazel Lancaster is living on borrowed time.  She has lived with her terminal cancer for 3 years and thanks to a medical miracle, she has been bought more time. Now, if you think about it, we are all living on borrowed time. All of our days are numbered, but Hazel is being moved to the front of the line. It is not a matter of if she will die, but when. Her when will be a lot sooner than most of us. Since she was taken out of school when she was diagnosed, she has since gotten her GED and attends community college. She considers herself a grenade. Therefore, she has removed herself from the world to lesson the impact people will feel once she is gone. She only interacts with her parents, reads endlessly, and watches reality TV. She has been forced to attend a cancer kids support group since she is suffering from depression. At this support group, Hazel meets 17 year old Augustus Waters, an amputee and cancer survivor, and her numbered days are forever changed.<br /><br />Augustus sees something in Hazel Grace (as he calls her) that draws him to her. He describes Hazel perfectly. He says: \\"You are so busy being you that you have no idea how utterly unprecedented you are.\\" Hazel is definitely one of a kind. Augustus can't help but fall in love with her, even thoughHazel tries to prevent it from happening. She is a grenade after all.<br /><br />Augustus is an incredibly mature, intelligent, and not to mention good looking young man. Having survived cancer, he is not delusional, and knows that it could come back. He, like a lot of people who have a brush with death, is obsessed with leaving a mark on the world. He wants his life to have meaning; he wants to be someones hero.<br /><br />Hazel is obsessed with this book called An Imperial Affliction. It is about a teenage girl named Anna who has cancer and the book just ends, when Anna presumably dies, and you never find out what happens to the rest of the characters. Hazel shares this book with Augustus and he too is deeply affected by it. Hazel desperately wants to find out the ending of this book, because she, like Anna, will leave this world, and Hazel wants to know that Anna's Mother, friends and even pet hamster went on to be okay without her. If the characters in this book are okay, maybe Hazel's loved ones will be okay after she is gone as well. With the help of Augustus, she finds the author of the book, and it leads them on a journey of love and discovery together.<br /><br />This is a book about living a forever within our numbered days. It is about realizing that most of us will never leave a mark on the universe, but we will leave our marks on those we love. Our lives have meaning as long as we open up ourselves to love. Augustus helped Hazel open up to love, and Hazel helped Augustus realize that his life had meaning because he loved and was loved in return.<br /><br />I cannot say enough wonderful things about this book. You will laugh, cry, and be forever changed by this book. I know I am. Thank you John Greene!
B006LSZECO|3.0|Gone Girl started off well.  I loved how the author wrote her characters.  I was glued to Amy and Nick.  Then the ending came.  I hated the ending.  Was very disappointed.  I will not read another of her books.

B008N1V11U|5.0|This game is fantastic. I think the free-roam feature really makes you feel like Batman. I love the RPG-like qualities. However, the game needs too much download space. If it could actually create a totally realistic Gotham City, I'd be overjoyed.<br /><br />Sadly, that's not the case, and most of the detail in the environment is Bruce Wayne's suit. However, the game still manages to render a somewhat realistic Gotham, and this app manages to surpass Gameloft's last free-roam, The Amazing Spider-Man, in both quality and space needed. Batman manages to squeeze a bigger city into less space. Though in TDKR, there's a substantial loss of civilian npc's roaming the streets.TASM, however, has a new Yorker around every turn.<br /><br /> Despite these problems, The Dark Knight Rises is another great product from Gameloft.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I was worried that I wouldn't like the last book of the trilogy because I had heard from people who read it that it wasn't as good as the others and hard to get through.

The question to eat grass-fed vs grain-fed beef, eating organic vs non-organic, free-range vs caged chicken, were all answered watching this DVD. Highly recommended.
0375704027|3.0|Murakami is known for his odd, quirky characters and his affinity for talking cats, but Norwegian Wood is a departure from that. Yes, the characters are quirky but probably the least quirky I've encountered thus far and I've read eight of his books in the past year and a half.<br /><br />Essentially, the book functions as a love story. At its center is Toru Watanabe. He's an average guy and a decent student. While at college, he befriends Kizuki and Naoko who happen to be dating but the two of them are not complete without the addition of Toru's friendship. All three of them acknowledge this at some point in their relationship, yet when Kizuki dies tragically, Naoko and Toru remain friends, but their friendship is challenged by Naoko's inability to function without Kizuki. This forces her to spend some time away, recuperating from her sadness.<br /><br />While away, Toru goes about his life as he normally would trying to figure out where he stands with Naoko and then in walks Midori. Midori has her own issues and although the two take comfort in each other's company, they can't seem to move past the Toru/Naoko connection. What starts off as an innocent friendship turns into something else, but how far can it go when your heart also loves another?<br /><br />My reaction to the book may have been due to the translation but the writing was simplistic to me. Overly so, and that's not something I expect while reading a Murakami novel. The dialogue was stilted and almost seemed forced in some places. At first, I enjoyed the slowness of it, but when the dialogue continued this way, I began to get frustrated with it. It really played out as a \\"He Said, She Said\\" and its predictability in both plot and pattern nearly put me to sleep at one point. But, there are telltale signs of Murakami's familiar style too which is probably why I continued reading. His characters are always so interesting even if what they had to say wasn't.<br /><br />However, there was a \\"creep\\" factor to this novel that I've not experienced with any of Murakami's other books. The \\"relations\\" between some of the characters set my teeth on edge. Many have said this is one of Murakami's more erotic novels but I didn't find it to be overly erotic or graphic. However, I did feel uncomfortable numerous times while reading it. The conversations about sex just didn't seem realistic me. You wouldn't walk up to a friend and say, \\"Hey, it would be nice to see your penis just to see how impressive it is. Don't you think?\\" Not a line from the book but it's a good example of what I am talking about. Polite and smutty all at the same time.<br /><br />Overall, I enjoyed the musical references and listened to Norwegian Wood (by the Beatles) a few times while reading but the story was very slow and the high creep factor turned me off. Not one of my favorites, but I suspect that readers who do not appreciate the surreal quality of his other novels, might prefer the straight-forwardness of this one.o this novel that I've not experienced with any of Murakami's other books.

B000IZ1HP4|5.0|For cult western enthusiasts, I'll give this a 5-star rating.  I saw this 1968 film originally in theatre and was blown away with its idealized and romanticized portrayal of the old west with huge cast and production values.  The first-time viewing of director Servio Leone's (spaghetti western fame) intentional slow pace & subtle humor of this epic will likely make you think you wasted your money.  But watch it a couple more times, plus the included behind-the-scenes, and you'll begin to appreciate the inverted effort to most other same-period American shot films: i.e, like the equally good 1969 Wild Bunch---where there's normal pacing with ultra-slow motion shoot-outs & blood spurting everywhere.  Then you'll begin to grasp that the 'dance' of the duals are time-elongated (as if you were there at the depot, swatting flies yourself), with realistic 1/10 sec. shootout resolutions.  And once establishing shots of actors physicality determined, why not just do ultra close-ups of their gritty, sweaty expressions of famous actors like Henry Fonda and Charles Bronson, lathered horses, etc.?  It also has great sound and sparse dialog, as the faces and action tell the story much better.

B004XIZK5K|4.0|Kettlebells can be one of the best exercises for strength, but if you're brand new to them, as I was, then I highly recommend this book and Pavel's \\"Entering...\\" DVD. Even with these, it would be a piece of cake to seriously damage your back if your form isn't spot on. Your probability of self-injury will be higher still if you've had prior back problems (I have.)  So, I'd also recommend at least one lesson from a certified expert (I had 2; so far,) IN ADDITION to the book and DVD, which will then serve as valuable references and guides to use your training. Take your time and spend the money to learn how to do it right and you'll have fun workouts and great results too. By the way, if you've never tried them, the swing drills are cardiovascular and aerobic and quite different from your typical gym-variety squats, deadlifts, and cleans. For me they're a fun addition to, but not a replacement for, the latter. I love them, but if you're cardio-phobic, you may not, so you may want to get your initial training first if you have doubts.<br /><br />Recommended. (I only subtracted one star because I don't think the book alone is enough to begin safely.)

Each week I would count down the days until Sunday when the episode would air and then the count down would start over as I waited for the next. Almost every episode was well worth the wait! A couple I was a bit dissapointed in, but over all I thought they were fantastic! The acting was so good and the casting choices were just perfect! The sets the writing the costumes, beyond your imagination! It was like being a little kid again watching the fairytale characters, although this time with more of a grown-up twist! Spectacular series that I am so glad has renewed for a second season!
B006LSZECO|1.0|In the acknowledgements the author states that they got stuck about 80% through the book abd the editor had to help finish. There is a reason the editor is not an author. The ending destroys this book. If a book is a sensual experience, than this book will finish before you are done.<br />I do understand deadlines and publishers demanding a story they have paid for, and yet if the story is not complete, do not waste my time and money please.<br />The book is overpriced for an ebook.<br />Maybe the author will one day go back and actually write an ending to this potentially good story. Till then here are some better choices at half the price.<br /><br />Never Smile at Strangers  Jennifer Minar-Jaynes  2.99<br />Past Imperfect John Matthews  2.99
B0083SBM7Q|5.0|I have to admit that as a girl in her twenties I have not really had much interest in the Comic Book world. I saw the first Iron Man and Thor with some friends not because it was my choice, but because it was what they all wanted. However when I went to see \\"The Avengers\\" I decided maybe I should give it another go. This movie was the ultimate movie experience! Action, plot, amazing characters, funny dialogue an over all \\"WOW\\" of a movie! I enjoyed it so much that I had to rent Captain America in order to understand more of the stories leading up to this one. Joss Whedon did a phenomenal job with this movie! I am so pleased to hear that he will be writing and directing \\"The Avengers 2\\"!
1468161660|5.0|I bought this booking hoping for a quick easy read, I loved it. I read it in one day and the sequel the next. I felt so deeply for the characters and was emotionally raw by the end. I would recommend this book to anybody.
031620157X|4.0|I am ashamed to admit that The Land of Stories: The Wishing Spell would probably not have been on my radar if Chris Colfer hadn't written it. I might have picked it up at the library and checked it out, or contemplated buying it for a few dollars at Half Price Books, but I never would have ordered an autographed copy from Barnes & Noble in NYC, spending $23.99 and several shaky, social-anxiety filled minutes on the phone in the process.<br /><br />They say not to judge a book by its cover, and yet, if Chris Colfer hadn't written The Land of Stories, the only thing that would have drawn me to it would have been its cover. It's a children's book- eight to twelve, I've heard people say- and I've long since passed the children's section in the library. But if I had run across The Wishing Spell in a library by mistake, I might have checked it out on the cover alone. It's gorgeous, beautifully illustrated, and it captures the essence of the story perfectly. In fact, as I'm writing this, I keep looking over at it wistfully, running my hand across the spine. It's that pretty.<br /><br />But this book was written by Chris Colfer. So I did order a signed copy, even though it wasn't written for my age range, and I did spend several hours stroking the pretty book jacket longingly when I first bought it, though that might not have been because of Brandon Dorman's beautiful artwork but rather because of the big fat \\"Autographed Copy\\" sticker on the front cover. Writing a book review for a story penned by my idol makes me slightly nervous, because I'm a little bit unsure of whether or not I'm letting my fangirling influence my opinions on the book, but I'm going to try to be as honest as possible.<br /><br />The Wishing Spell follows twelve-year-old twins Alex and Conner Bailey on a fractured fairy tale adventure. After falling into their grandmother's cherished fairy tale book, they find themselves in the 'Land of Stories'; a place where fairies, elves, trolls, goblins, peasants,and royalty alike all live. They meet famous characters such as Prince Charming (all four of them), Cinderella, Sleeping Beauty, Snow White, Rapunzel, Red Riding Hood, Goldilocks, and even the Little Mermaid (in her real, not Disney-fied form: sea foam). They travel far and wide to gather the items necessary to complete the Wishing Spell, a magic spell that will supposedly take them home.<br /><br />One thing that I know for sure is that this book wouldn't have been as meaningful for me if it hadn't been written by Chris Colfer, because I wouldn't have made such an ordeal of it- savoring each page, crying when it's over, thinking to myself, hey, Chris Colfer grew up with a special needs sister, was bullied to the moon and back, and almost attended community college because he had nowhere else to go, but now he's an award-winning actor and has written a New York Times Bestseller, so suck on that, haters. I don't think I would have been as moved if Chris Colfer hadn't written it, and that is hard to admit. But knowing Colfer's back story actually adds to the story in ways that I hadn't thought possible. There is advice in the story that makes more sense when the author has a name and a face and a history. When the twins are talking to Cinderella, for example- \\"'I never thought my life would change so drastically, so I always made the most of what I had,' Cinderella said. 'I always laugh at the term Cinderella story, because, if you ask me, it doesn't matter what life you're living, life never has a solution. No matter how hard the struggles are that you leave behind, new struggles always take their place.'\\" (page 190)- it's almost as if Colfer is talking about his life through the characters, and I think that's the beauty of reading a story written by somebody you know and love dearly. You understand what the story means to the author as well as what it means to the reader. I would have thought that these small lessons would seem slightly transparent- they definitelyare when isolated from the story-, but they were actually placed quite delicately, in a way that didn't seem pompous or arrogant, and discovering them was a sort of serendipity. (\\"Froggy leaned down beside her. 'It doesn't matter how greatly you've been hurt or how much you're hurting, it's what you do with the pain that counts,' he said. 'You could cry for years, and rightfully so, or you could choose to learn and grow from it. Take it from me: I spent years hiding in a hole, afraid to come out because of what people would think of me. But one day I decided to leave, and I ended up saving lives!'\\" page 410). It was almost like getting a hug from the author himself.<br /><br />Despite him being both my role model and celebrity crush, I can't sugarcoat it: Chris Colfer is not a perfect writer. Most of his sentences were of the same length (which is to say, quite short) and some of them were clunky. He didn't eloquently weave his words and his diction didn't leave me breathless. Although there were a couple similes that I chuckled at (\\"Conner's mouth hung open like a broken glove compartment.\\" page 50), the book was painfully free of figurative language, and there were far too many clichés for my liking. A lot of this could be chalked up to the fact that it's a children's book (and sadly, I don't think every eight-year-old is as concerned about great writing as I was at that age), but I also get the feeling that this is just the type of writer Chris Colfer is: fairly straightforward, more focused on the plot than the writing itself. He actually reminds me of J.K. Rowling, in that he is more of a storyteller than writer (and I mean absolutely no offense with that- they're both just more interested in telling a beautiful story rather than crafting beautiful sentences). His writing style leads me to believe that he may be a better screenwriter than novel-writer, because his strengths are in plot and dialogue.<br /><br />Although it's been done hundreds of times, ChrisColfer had a fresh and original take on fractured fairy tales. I was slightly disappointed in the first couple hundred pages because most of his plot 'twists' were incredibly predictable and because many of the 'obstacles' the twins faced were solved almost immediately. It all seemed incredibly convenient until perhaps the last hundred pages or so. I'm usually pretty obtuse when it comes to plot twists (unfortunately, I could never be a detective), but there were two or three surprises at the end that kept me on my toes (and forced me to stick my fist over my foolish grin and stop myself from laughing). Perhaps somebody more observant or clever than I am could have predicted the ending(s), but it pleased me well enough, and after finishing the novel I found it more obvious that the plot \\"twists\\" in the beginning/middle of the book were supposed to be predicted and anticipated (again... I'm kind of obtuse). The characters were well-developed for a children's book (they were quite stereotyped, but it is written for eight to twelve year olds), and even Conner, who was mostly there for comic relief, had a couple of very touching moments. All in all, the story was pretty well done, and the ending, which was messy and complicated and somehow wonderful as well, made me shed a few tears. It was definitely my favorite part, and I didn't realize how invested I had become in the characters and the story until I turned the last page.<br /><br />Now, one last point before I wrap up this novel-length review: I was so, so, so pleased to find that Chris Colfer wrote a book that not only had strong, important female characters, but was even centered around these strong female characters. I can only think of three or four male characters that played as much significance (with dozens of characters, that was quite a surprise), and it was so refreshing, especially for the fairy tale genre, a genre that is often criticized by feminists for depicting the man as the hero and woman as the damsel in distress. Even the typically dull female princesses, such as Cinderella and Sleeping Beauty, were written as brave and strong, with far more personality and wisdom than they've ever had in the original fairy tales. Chris wasn't as progressive, however, when it came to POCs- by my count, there was only one black character, and she was quite minor. I'm sure he didn't mean to do it, and I'm sure part of it was that he wanted to stick to the original fairy tale characters and their original physical traits, but it was another depressing example of white privilege, and one that was pretty hard to ignore.<br /><br />So: Did I like the book? Yes. I loved it. Is it because Chris Colfer wrote it? No. Absolutely not. Was I impressed/astounded/wow-ed beyond belief? Yes, especially at the end. Is it because Chris Colfer wrote it? Hmm... Probably? You read it, and tell me how you feel.<br /><br />If there's one thing I've learned from The Wishing Spell, it's that there's always more to a story, even after 'happily ever after'.<br /><br />I can't wait for the sequel.<br /><br />TLDR; OK/good for teens/adults, great for kids. Would recommend to everyone, partially because it's written by a fantastic person and partially because it's a great book. Keep in mind that it's a children's book as you're reading it.<br /><br />To see more reviews visit littlecricketreviews.blogspot.com :)

034580404X|5.0|I had heard a lot about these books, so I decided to read them. As a man, I wasnt really sure what to expect except a lot of sex. Yes there was a lot of sex, but I would rather have more of a storyline. I found this to be a love story more than an erotic porno.
0345803493|3.0|After reading the first book you basically get that it's kinda korny writing and no plot. It seems like a teenage type series rather than a housewife book. But I'll tell you that as lame as the books are you can not put them down!! I would stay up past midnight reading every night and when the movie comes out I will deff go see it! Another thing that drove me nuts was the soo unrealistic sex scenes!!! No one can have sex as much as them and have it be perfect every time! I really only gave it three stars b/c it is a pretty good read and it's catchy and a page turner.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|wonderful and sexy book. better than the first. can't wait to read the third book. Great to read together with the special person in your life.
B004EPYZUS|4.0|I gotta admit, after failing to mask my disappointment over the two preceding M:I sequels, I was one reluctant hombre to go see MISSION:  IMPOSSIBLE--GHOST PROTOCOL.  I mean, how many times can Cruise's Ethan Hunt have such a brooding, endless, pity party?  Yet I'm happy to report this latest installment is grand fun, and in my humble opine is the best film in the franchise.  Here Cruise ratchets down the gloom and doom and allows his fellow spies (Jeremy Renner, Simon Pegg, and a stunning Paula Patton) to play off his antics, as the IMF--ostensibly disavowed by the U.S. government--races furiously to prevent a demented terrorist from launching a global nuclear attack.  From the Kremlin, to the Burj Khalifa Tower in Dubai, to the streets of Mumbai, GHOST PROTOCOL is as fast and as furious as running across a blazing hot street barefoot.  In other words, GHOST PROTOCOL gets up and moves.<br /><br />Cruise is in stellar physical condition, and that's a good thing, because his Ethan Hunt is a whirlwind of kinetic energy; from jumping out of a third floor hospital room, to scaling the Khalifa Tower (more on that later), to driving a car off the top level of a parking garage, Cruise has to rely on his pecs.  And the plot and pacing are just as frantic, making watching this installment a quick view.  Director Brad Bird further enhances the action with eye-popping CGI effects and graphic visuals; this is one finely-crafted action thriller.  The other major players are solid; Renner matches Cruise's physicality, Pegg provides comedy relief, and Patton packs volumes of eye candy.  The rest of the cast is entertaining as well; look for the character actor Tom Wilkinson in a brief, uncredited role.<br /><br />And with my acute acrophobia, naturally Agent Hunt will be forced to scale the outside of the Khalifa Tower to gain access to the building's nerve center--naturally his high-tech gizmo gloves (with the giant sucking sound) will malfunction while Hunt is more than a 1,000 feet in the desert air.  Watching this (through half-closed eyes) I literally become a contortionist in my seat, twisting and squirming to relieve my discomfort.  Normally in scenes such as this I fast forward through the mayhem, but not here; MISSION:  IMPOSSIBLE--GHOST PROTOCOL is so darn fun I want to watch every blasted second.<br />--D.

0345803485|1.0|I read this because of the hype, I should have known better (seems to me, whenever I read a book based on hype I'm let down....)  This book was pretty much the worst book ever.  It seemed to 'start' out okay...then it became predictable and boring, after the first 'sex scene', all I could think was 'enough already.'  I agree with the reviewer here saying 'did 13 year olds write it?'  Now, I HOPE a 13 year old couldn't have the capacity to write about the bdsm stuff...but the rest...how utterly ridiculous it is Anastacia meets up with a 27 year old billionaire...he's not a millionaire but a BILLIONAIRE...really??  and her college roommate hooks up with his brother....really?  c'mon...I didn't read the two other books, and I know this isn't the case but it sounded like they were going to have a 'double wedding', then buy a house to live all together, etc....haha.  Anastacia had an orgasm every time he so much as touched her, he gets excited whenever she bites her lip, and the references to her 'inner goddess'-terrible.  Bottom line is this, this book lacks wit, it is not witty at all!!! I'm of average intelligence and love a good book-this book is not worth bothering with at all!!!
B007SGM084|2.0|This trilogy was awful! I have absolutely no idea why people are talking about this series- or even openly admitting to reading it in the first place! No chemistry, no story, no depth to the characters. As simple porn, I suppose it holds up well, but falls flat as legitimate fiction.

0345803493|2.0|The first books was okay.  The dialog was cheesy but the anticipation of what was coming up made it worth the read.  The second and third books contain repetitive dialog and I quickly became irritated with both characters. \\"Don't hate me\\", \\"I don't hate you\\", \\"Don't leave me\\" \\"I won't leave you\\".  Yuck.  A shame too because the premise was intriguing.  I think the author ran out of steam.
B000EQ5HSK|4.0|I purchased this hood primarily to protect the lens element of our new  EF-S 17-55 f/2.8 IS USM. We have a 3yr old that likes to touch & grab things. This hood keeps his fingerprints off the glass. We have a 9yr old that loves photography so he occasionally uses the rebel body with this lens attached w/hood. The hood just adds an extra layer of protection for those \\"oops\\" moments when the kid in him kicks in & he gets careless with the gear.<br /><br />Overall: Works as it should & fits properly. It's cheaper to buy this hood than to pay for repair on a scratched lens.
B00030DEQE|5.0|Needed an extra port on the server and this worked great. If i really needed i could have used this on one of our slim line desktops because it comes with the shorter adapter.
0307742997|4.0|I picked this up a while back while waiting around at an airport. I had heard of Jo Nesbo and even read excerpts but hadn't gotten around to reading any of the novels. I knew this was a later book in the series but I'm not the type that cares a whole lot about reading books (or watching movies) in chronological order. In fact I sort of like jumping around and catching \\"echoes\\" and \\"foreshadowing\\" in earlier books after reading them later, but I'm sick that way. I don't think the series suffered a whole lot in regards to the main character's development but I did see a dramatic and constant improvement in Nesbo's style going forward. Each book was better than the one written before it. As a reader, I'm often disappointed to see writing quality degrade as the author rushes out new books to meet the contract deadlines. Nesbo just gets better with each book. I can't wait to pick up the latest. Here's hoping this writer keeps it up.

B000VOC90Y|5.0|The bag came as advertised and with more. All the pockets, sections and padding was exactly what I needed. I tend to walk/bike to work from time to time and my duffel bag is horrible on my shoulders. This bag carries my laptop, food, gym clothing and tech books. I love the padded shoulder straps which allows easy, comfortable carrying.<br /><br />It was also delivered within 2-3 business days as promised, actually earlier!!!
0545265355|5.0|The Hunger Games trilogy is extremely fast reading and suspenseful until the end.  I loved all three books and finished all three in three days.  When I read the first one, I thought it should finish after the end of the games but the author kept throwing in new twists and turns so that each book was exciting.  This suspenseful plot changing was wonderful throughout the entire set of three books.  The price of all three books was not very high and I would recommend this set to anyone.  A great read!!!
030758836X|5.0|Wow - what a ride! This book is like accidentally walking into one of those mechanical car washes. First you get pummeled from all sides, knocked over by jets of icy water and dragged along by chains - and just when you can see the exit and think you are safe at last, the big roller flattens you!<br /><br />The story starts innocently enough. Nick wakes on the morning of his 5th wedding anniversary to the smell of his wife's cooking. Loving, sweet. But things soon turn South. Amy disappears in suspicious circumstances, and Nick must not only find out what happened to her but also defend himself against allegations that he had something to do with his wife's disappearance. As Nick tells his side of the story, the reader gets to know Amy through excerpts from her diary, from the moment she first fell in love with Nick until the days just before her disappearance. At this point, lulled into a false feeling of security by these seemingly mundane marital issues, you better fasten your seat belt!<br /><br />This is a masterfully crafted and very disturbing psychological thriller where nothing is quite as it seems, and evil takes on many shapes and forms. As different aspects of Amy's and Nick's marriage are revealed, the story turns from the ordinary to the sinister. I agree with other reviewers that it is extremely difficult to comment on this story without giving anything away, so all I will say here is that this was one of the most intricately constructed plots I have read in a long time. To say that I found the ending deeply troubling would be an understatement, and anyone who has read this book will know what I mean.<br /><br />Written with insight into the issues of a marriage between two people with very different backgrounds and values, the book also explores the deepest, darkest and most disturbing places of the human psyche gone wrong. Do not be put off by the seemingly slow beginning - but instead see it as the slow and gentle ascent to a terrifying roller coaster ride to follow. I could not put the book down and recommend it to anyone who enjoys a good psychological thriller.ter ride to follow. I could not put the book down and recommend it to anyone who enjoys a good psychological thriller.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I have heard so much about The Hunger Games so I caved in as I needed a fast moving book.<br />Love the whole concept of the world she created and the interaction of the characters. Reminds me of Harry Potter or Twighlight Saga. Really it's for adults as well as the younger readers. A good read that you won't want to put down...

B005WUHAX8|5.0|I got 2 of these cases, one for me and one for my accident prone hubby :) My MIL has had one for several months and loved it so we got on the lifeproof bandwaggon. My MIL has been pretty rough with hers - 7 grandkids, swimming in the pool, waterparks, drops out of the car lol all with no issues at all. It is much smaller and sleeker then the otterbox I was using and I love that it is waterproof. Charging could be an issue becuase of how the case is built, but there are adapters that can be bought that can allow you to use all of your existing accessories, docks and chargers so not a big deal. As long as it keeps the water out I am willing to give up on a little flexibility of chargers. Great price here on Amazon too! I did the water test before putting in my iphone just to be safe and it was watertight. Very happy with this purchase.
0345803485|5.0|I loved this book; it really kept my interest and I cannot wait to read the other two books!  It is not a good read though for people who are uptight about sex, that's for sure!
0756405890|5.0|I'd have to honestly say that this is one of the best books I've read.  Ever. I'm a big fan of the Dresden Files series, grew up on Terry Brooks, but still this one somehow blew me away. Just starting the sequel and enjoying it like an expensive wine opened after a long wait...
B004SBQGHS|2.0|With the latest update (Aug 2012) it uninstalls your current version and reinstalls - Deleting all your previous scores across all levels and locking all the levels.  Same thing with angry birds space (ad-free). Very annoying.
B006LSZECO|3.0|\\"Gone Girl\\" started very slowly for me and did not catch my interest until well in to it. The story took a lot of turns that were unexpected. The ending was incomplete as far as I was concerned.
B005K17RU0|4.0|I would give it 5 stars but it seams to be off a little when predicting the weather. I had The Weather Channel first installed on my kindle but I thought this one would be more User friendly. It is about the same except the two do not match up when telling the weather and this one is always wrong.  Other wise it is ok. Please fix.

030758836X|5.0|I got the audio version downloaded to my phone for a long road trip.  I came very close to turning it off because of the person's voice.  It was so monotone and definitely does not match up to this incredible story.<br />  Being a mom, I would like to point out there is a lot of cussing in this book from the get go. I would not let my kids ( teenagers) read this, but I immediately called my friend to recommend this book.<br />That aside, this is a must read.  It is written from both the husband's and wife's perspective.  It goes back and forth with each chapter. It flows flawlessly. I love books written in this way.<br />The author has a way of describing the characters in such a way that you feel you know them intimately. This is done in a way that it does not become so wordy that you end up jumping whole paragraphs of nothing but descriptive words.  I hate books that seem to be adding those kinds of paragraphs just to fill pages.<br />The book has so many actions that are \\"out there\\", but clever enough to actually happen.<br />It is hard to write a review without giving away much. However, just when you think you are at the end of the story, comes an ending that no one could see coming.  You finish the book with a deep sense of someone settling for far less than life could offer.  It stays with you for a long time.<br />Loved it!

B0068MNO4S|1.0|William Shakespeare is not the author of the \\"Shakespearean Portfolio\\", just let me get that out of the way.<br /><br />But this film, filled with all kinds of plots and intrigues is just plain laughable, or would be were it not for the mere fact that I dozed off at several points throughout the film.<br /><br />You know, could anyone expect anything less from Roland Emmerich?  A man whose known film making style is to put implausible but superstitious material on screen for teenagers (and teenagers at heart) to soak up and enjoy?<br /><br />Well, I'm not a teenager anymore, thank goodness, and when I first heard about this film I was enthused to see what kind of story would be presented on the screen.  But, there were flags.  The actors at the press junket was a big one; \\"acting\\" (to coin a phrase) as if they were outraged that the material they were presenting had been \\"hidden\\" for so long by so few and accepted by so many (to borrow from another Brit, W. Churchill).  I really didn't think anything of it at the time, and merely fobbed it off as just more dramatics to sell the film.<br /><br />Then I see the film.  I give a collective \\"huh\\", and leave the theatre wondering if the entire crew and company think that those of us who doubt Shakespeare's literary veracity are merely a bunch of nut cases.<br /><br />But, you know what?  I don't care.<br /><br />William Shakespeare had lots of education and inherit intelligence.  He was not a dumb man.  But he did not write nor create the artistry in the so labelled \\"Shakespeare Portfolio\\".  His education was in commerce and legal procedures, it was not in the pass-times of Elizabethan's \\"Rich and Famous\\" (again, to coin a phrase).  Nor was it in astronomy, military matters, international relations, Mediterranean social morays, and a host of other things found in the Shakespearean portfolio that are needed in order to write those works.<br /><br />And, on the screen, it's even worse.  Instead of a Shakespeare who seems tohave been a family man in spite of his legal wrangles with other merchants, we're given a slovenly womanizer who extorts money from De Vere.<br /><br />The film goes on about court intrigue, who is sleeping with whom, and pretty much every paranoid fantasy that one could ever have about the people involved with those works at that time.<br /><br />It really amazes me that anyone would presume that because an individual doubted one facet of that era regarding \\"Shakespeare\\", that therefore said individual BELIEVED in ALL of the paranoid crap that was put into this movie.<br /><br />The Raisuli take on Shakeseare; he was a producer, and this seems to make sense as he had a lot of experience in dealing with people in a court of law, as well as dealing in money, notably grains.  He probably had a legal reputation that kept people  from suing him and his theatre troupe for libel and slander.  The works were probably produced under him as \\"the author\\" because he was the man bringing the resources to the stage, but nothing beyond that.<br /><br />How on Earth this manifests into riots and mass slaughters on the London bridge and elsewhere, and transpires into murders and cover ups is really beyond the scope of my imagination.<br /><br />But, some Over-The-Top German decides to produce a paranoid driven film, and \\"Anonymous\\" is what we get.<br /><br />It's truly a piece of well produced garbage.  See it once for the art direction.<br /><br />Otherwise trash it, or leave it on the shelf.  Your brain will thank you for the rest of your life.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I just use this app for the basic calculator things and it works great! easy to use and love that things are big so you can read the numbers.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|The book went well with the series. Some excitement and suspense. But the ending sucked.You turned him into a wimp.
B0002VFXFE|5.0|I've been using this stuff on CPUs for over 10 years. Yeah, it cools a little better than most stock compounds, but the real benefit is when you have to remove the CPU HSF. This stuff comes off *way* easier than the bubble gum most manufacturers use.
B007HC3LHS|4.0|A thriller. Very tightly written, it will grip you right away. A bit graphic and terrifying. Have recommended this to others who enjoy a well written story. Characters were well developed.
B0089LT8Y6|5.0|.... because \\"its one more\\". this has got to be one of the best albums all year and will probably be one of the best of the decade! if you don't fully fall in love with this album the first time you listen to it, you are not \\"metal enough\\" and don't deserve it.<br /><br />quick recap of the stand outs.....<br />rise up - this song will melt the speakers right out of your car. chuck's voice when he screams \\"Waaaaar\\" is just crazy, nasty, metal at its best.<br />native blood - great song. the riffs are awesome.<br />dark roots - the music is great but chuck's vocals and lyrics really put this song over the top.<br />true american hate - will this be the new \\"over the wall\\"? incredible song. drumming is awesome!<br />a day in the death - more great riffs from alex and eric<br />cold embrace - eerie song that gets really heavy. chuck does some interesting vocals here.<br />man kills mankind - a great \\"anthem\\"... you will be singing this one... such a great song for track 8... no filler on this album!<br />throne of thorns - another killer, a galloping master piece... your speakers will be dust after this one<br />Last Stand for Independence - another great song thats at the end of the album !<br />dragon attack - interesting cover<br />animal magnetism - dark, dark, dark<br />power slave - the guys hit this one out of the park... what's better than testament doing a maiden song... i can die now
B007V2UGPE|5.0|its the best game on my kindle yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes! !!!!!!!!!!
B007IXWL2C|4.0|It was a good story. Not as good as the first two, but a good story none the less. I would recommend it to anyone who wants to read this book.
B008BM9L72|5.0|Somewhat trashy and perhaps not the most well written books but I loved them.  A great read that kept me hooked until the end.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Addictive....fast play and hard to put down....clear and concise game play screen...layout is superb and flows fast on the Droid
0307719774|5.0|I've had a lot of trouble in the past keeping journals about my trips and life but this is just amazing. With one question a day I get to know a little bit more about myself and I can one day share this with someone else. Its so easy to keep up with, I just write in it right before I go to bed and I'm done! Love this and I can't wait to see what it will look like in 5 years!
B008MEM24S|5.0|this app is pretty cool its really fun and I like to play it a lot there are lots of fun levels to try to pass
B008IJTFYW|4.0|great app for sleeping!!! love it wld give a 5 if I cod switch into a different app and still hear the sounds
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|This is a well written story. It is easy to fall in love with the characters. Have a tissue box close!
0345803485|4.0|The writing is simple and easy and the first book of the trilogy is plain fun. This is NOT porn. It is really a very light but erotic story of a troubled man who has some dark passions and falls in love for the first time with a young, naive 22 year old. While the stereotype of big, strong, powerful, wealthy, dark stranger taking a young innocent girl on a wild ride is a bit tired, it was a fun fantasy none the less. Don't expect deep character development or an unpredictable story line. Read it and just go with it for what it is. An erotic fantasy.
B008MEM24S|5.0|I am a grownup and I have no idea what Perry is but it is super fun and super cute.  it is shorter than where's my water but I think more levels are coming.  it is similar and a little better and more refined.  if you liked water don't even think, just buy it
B001KVZ6HK|3.0|I know that i'm going to be attacked here, but i honestly didn't think this was the best movie of 2012. i thought the movie was kinda dull in some areas and the story actually seems to be thrown together with no glue to hold it together which leads eventually to the alien attack which lead no where. the only thing that kept it going was the chemistry between the actors. it was fun to watch yes, but not that great. i can see why some people would consider this one of the best comic book movies of all time, but it just seems way overrated. it's just an okay movie, nothing really stood to make me want to watch it numerous times (besides pointing out all the plot holes- trust me, there were a ton)
B005T9ZTSU|1.0|I thought the Flickr app would be more convenient for photo blogging, but it was not suitable at all. The app seems to take you to Flickr website; I don't need a separate app that allows me to browse the Flickr website on my phone.<br /><br />I just want to upload pictures from my phone to my Flickr account. Instead I got log-in errors, token errors, 'web site not available try again' errors. \\"Flickr has stopped\\" errors. And every time I have to reenter my id and password. Over and over.<br />My phone is a Samsung Galaxy SII with the latest firmware, if that matters...<br /><br />It was much easier to email photos from the phone to my Flickr account. From there the blog software picks up the photos. Seems like the two most useful features for a Flickr mobile app have been left off:<br />1. Seamlessly stream pictures from Flickr to the phone for browsing<br />2. Seamlessly send pictures from the phone to Flickr for blogging or safe keeping.<br /><br />The app does neither of those things.
B004UG7RQ0|5.0|This product works great!  We purchased an ipod speaker doc, but wanted to use an MP3 player with it. This was simple - just plug and play!  Highly under-rated product. Love it!
B003VANOFY|5.0|I bought this headset basically upon its release back in September 2010. It's been nearly 2 years now and I continue to love this headset! Even after hundreds of hours of usage, it's still extremely comfortable to wear for extended periods of gaming or movie watching. I use the 7.1 surround when I play BF3 and it sounds amazing. I use the 7.1 to my advantage many times during the course of a close quarters game because i can hear footsteps right before I turn the corner of a hallway! I also frequently get comments from other online gamers that my voice is pretty clear, so that's a plus about this headset, too. Overall, I'm extremely satisfied with this headset and wholeheartedly recommend this to anyone (not only gamers) looking for the very best wireless surround sound headset out there.<br /><br />Only about a month ago did I notice that the headset didn't hold a charge for about 9-10 hours anymore. I simply logged onto Logitech's support site and ordered a replacement battery for $5!<br /><br />Since replacing the battery (which was pretty easy to do), the battery life was back to the way it was when it was brand new!<br /><br />Link to Official Logitech site for spare parts for this headset:<br />[...]
B006KSAPV0|4.0|There will be two views here.<br /><br />1. This is not Almodovar's greatest or best or really even highest quality work; which doesn't mean it isn't good. He is a master director; Always true to his medium (spacing of actors, color of sets and costumes, mood and pace of story, music. All are given wonderful attention.) He is consistently distinct, provocative, deep, emotionally true and interesting. It is just that the way he got me through the story wasn't as fluid and stylish as his past work, nor was the destination all that satisfying, given the journey a certain character takes. The other characters almost shrink in hindsight to what the \\"main\\" character goes through, and in such silence, such calculated, over stylized submission....<br /><br />2. This is an unforgettable film for several of reasons; one of them amazingly perverse, disturbing, realistic, awe inspiring (in the negative sense), timely (Hostel, Human Centipede, Saw(s), etc.) and deeply dark. Anyone who is too good (or shallow, or tired) for subtitles will miss a high quality horror film that no Hollywood/NY studio can allow itself to produce (only remake-albeit suspectly). They will also miss a chance to contemplate the sexual and social questions the film brings up (or indulges in). And what else does the medium of cinema need to offer, short of mind numbing visuals that render sense and logic irrelevant?
0446572993|5.0|Finally.... I read his book \\"Zero Day\\" and was really let down. I persevered and stuck with him as his books in the past have been very good. This is one of his best by far and totally worth waiting for.<br />I could see this being made into a film and would see that too.<br />I guess when reading a review you want to know what people thought of it rather than reading a synopsis, so.... read it, you will not regret it.<br />Previous books I read to this were... Lee Child (61 Hours....\\"rubbish\\") Before I go to sleep (I almost fell asleep) Harlen Coben (Tell No One... also worth reading)  Lisa Gardner (Catch Me...very average)<br /><br />Hope this gives you an insight?<br /><br />Good work David Baldacci, I will continue reading.
B0081JPTCQ|5.0|I don't really know why someone doesn't like and critic about it so bad that made me didn't want to buy and try to use it after I read a comments Anyway,  I decided to buy it cuz as I saw this is the best app with the cheap price. I love it so far. kinda complicated a little bit in the beginning; however,  you will used to it. After the first try,  its really easier than I thought. I don't even use help AT ALL. Just 2 little things that bother me. 1 its hard to write,  but I can create page as much as I want. 2 little bit slow when I change a page; however I understand Cu's I add pictures and graphics in my notes (makes my note not too boring)  :)
B008IJTFYW|5.0|I love how I can create and recreate many different 'soundtracks' depending upon what I want to use it for. This is the first app I found for ambience sounds, and I am so happy with it I stopped looking for any other program. I've only had it a couple days and I've already recommended it to several other people.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Simple games, some frustrating, some fun. Overall hard to complain when its free. Good way to kill time when you've got no wifi connection available.
B001I0T92Q|5.0|I thought it was for sdcard slots. Happy I only paid 1.99<br /><br />This is useless for me.... I have it 5 stars because It looked pretty well having come all the way from Hong Kong
B006LSZECO|5.0|An original read ~ couldn't put it down.  Surprises that were timed just right.  I have ADD and usually don't read every page of a book...didn't skip a word this time.  READ THIS BOOK
0345803485|5.0|These books are addicting!  I'm not a mom so the term \\"mommy porn\\" doesn't apply and I don't consider this \\"porn.\\" The author does use \\"hes fifty shades of...\\" a lot.  Also after about the hundredth sex scene where she magically hits her climax by him just saying her name was a bit of an overkill. I did flip through a few just cause its the same.  Overall Christian grey kept me wanting more. Many times I thought \\" why cant he be real?\\" LOL.  I was upset when I finished the third book.  There are plots to these books.  They are not all about sex.  I cant wait for the movie! If you are skeptical buy the book.  If its not for you then return it or resell it.
1563898586|4.0|This was the first graphic novel I read, and honestly not by choice either. I started reading this book with not expecting much, but it actually turned out to be quite a good book. On the surface it looks like nothing, but when read more closely, it is actually filled with humor with more allegory than you'd think.<br /><br />Each character has a different personality and issue, including Dr.Jekyll and a invisible man.<br /><br />Set during the Victorian time, the story unfolds with adventure, politics, humor, satire, and stereotypes. The pictures do justice conveying all the different themes. Moore is a genius-to be able to tell a story and say so much with so little dialogue. If you're into graphic novels, this graphic novel is definitely recommended.<br /><br />I did not give it 5 stars because I feel like the plot wasn't 5 star quality, but maybe the pictures and meanings behind them make up for it.<br /><br />Note: This book is not intended for children. Some of the pictures are pretty graphic and/or has violence.
B0088RQ4X4|5.0|Because they just don't like us.  This wonderful adaptation of ERB's Martian novels is an unabashed celebration of the virtues that built western civilization.  There are a few tweaks to make the story more plausible to an audience that is more scientifically grounded than that of a hundred years ago.  Whereas the original story has John Carter staring up at the planet Mars in the night sky and finding his spirit magically carried away to the red planet, the movie uses advanced alien technology, alien even to Barsoomians, to 'beam him up' as it were.<br /><br />A broken bitter man, John Carter is interested only in striking it rich in the Arizona Territories post-Civil War.  Brought forcibly to a fort led by Bryan Cranston's Colonel Powell, Carter is given a choice of Indian Scout or jail.  Carter breaks out of the jail cell, steals a horse, and leads the soldiers on a chase through Apache country.  Soon, they encounter a handful of Apaches, a fight ensues, and in the flight to save his life John Carter finds the cave where his real adventure begins.<br /><br />Reborn on Mars, the rough kindness of the green martians, the manipulative Therns, and the passionate Dejah Thoris all combine to give John Carter a new purpose, a new heart, and a new life.<br /><br />Aside to all the one and two star reviewers-you don't have to like JC, but do you have to hate him, too?
0679720200|5.0|I usually don't like translated works because there is often so much lost in translation. Many works (especially Greek mythology) can ramble and be agonizing to read through. However, this translation is beautiful. Matthew Ward has captured the ideas of Albert Camus: the searing apathy that haunts the life of Meursault. Even down to the most insignificant sentences and details, Meursault's struggle with indifference is always apparent. It is a quick read and reminds me very much of \\"Inherit the Wind\\" (mid-1900s courtroom struggle type of thing, ending with a potent moral message). \\"The Stranger\\" will leave you feeling the deepest sympathies for Meursault and conducting a deep self reflection.
B00005IBGQ|1.0|If this is his best effort how will it be the worse. I can't find the faboulous voice anywhere. It's always the same bored voice in every  bored track of the disc. It's really difficult to note differences betweens tracks. They look always the same one. Maybe a couple of them are more idiosincratics.<br />I think Rufus is the best exemple of the status of the contemporary pop music. Maybe into the actual pop scene Rufus is one of the best, but if you look back and compare this disc with thousands of masterworks in the 60s, 70s, 80s or even 90s the only posible conclusion is that you have wasted your money and your time.
B008MEM24S|5.0|it is the best game ever it is way better then call of duty and skyrim and other games like that
B001GJ3BPU|3.0|This movie takes you through a interesting situation of a life of a man. I found the \\"superpower\\" of Daredevil - his unique heightened ability to sense things as one of the most interesting superpowers. His way of fighting is most entertaining as he cannot see. His way of \\"seeing\\" also is cool - he sees almost the full form of a person through through the presence of surrounding rain, as he can sense some sort of image when the drop hits.<br /><br />Ben Affleck played his part well - very natural and believable. Thus I command the actors and how creators came up with the idea of Daredevil's disability (or superpower).<br /><br />I give it three stars because I thought the plot of the movie itself was not great. The way the radioactive just spills in his eyes, was not very exciting. If he had fallen into a vat of radioactive substance and had to climb out would or something along those lines would be better.<br /><br />Also, while his ability is cool and unique, I find his weakness a turnoff as a superhero. Superheros have a human side, yes, but I feel like his inability to withstand noise is a little much. He could be too easily defeated.<br /><br />Not up to par or at the same level with Marvel's other movies, but nonetheless, decent.<br />I actually enjoyed watching Elektra more, so I recommend that one after watching Daredevil.
B008M34INW|5.0|Wow...this was a really good movie.  We were pleasantly surprised.  If you can put aside any Mel Gibson issues, it had a great story-line and was well-acted.  There was enough intrigue to keep the mind interested and enough action to keep the pace fast.  I highly recommend it.  We don't speak Spanish but had no problem with the subtitles.  Plenty of it was still in English.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I thoroughly loved reading the book.  Couldn't put it down.  The twist at mid-book was fantastic.  The characters kept me interested.  My only complaint was the ending, and that kept me from giving it the 5 stars.  I felt it was flat and a let down.  I guess I wanted retribution for the husband.
B002G1K82Q|5.0|Very very good music and plot! I enjoyed every song and can´t get enough yet of the interpretation of the cast
0470913029|5.0|Very informative book. Helped me get started in a new me and hopefully helps my RA. Looking forward to ordering the cookbook.
B004SBQGHS|2.0|Why do I have to update every other day? And each update requires an unistall in order to update, wiping out the progress of my game.
B00634GHJA|5.0|This app works as advertised. It is fast and easy to use with a simple intuitive interface. Easily worth a buck or two.
B007VGXS8M|4.0|I have a Kindle and cannot win Level 40. I tried tracing the line and that does not work.  Need some help please!
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|really enjoying this App. graphics are great. there is a lot of variety. glad that I downloaded... and free!!!recommend ages 7 to adult.
B008P1EWIM|5.0|This is the BEST weather app I have ever used. It is so eye catching &amp; slick. It's also customizable and shows a lot of professionally presented information. Absolutely one of my favorite apps ever!
B004NSULHM|5.0|Screw it! I don't care if this record didn't grab me as In Rainbows did, and I don't care for the lack of tunefulness and melody! I will still give it 5 stars because in a sea of repetition and blandness and copycats, Radiohead is the only band gutsy enough to destroy the formula and start all over again. So you think OK Computer is genius? Take Kid A in the face! Oh, so you are warming up to In Rainbows, then, I'll hit you with Limbs! Radiohead won't let you get too comfy, they make you get out of your comfort zone, and absorb and digest, and as a result, you grow as a music listener! What other band does that?
B006OCM0G0|5.0|I loved this game the second I got it you should get it and if your completely addicted then only take advantage of the sales and I you probably never buy than ever time you earn a gem and get ten spend it on getting coins.
B005LAIGN2|5.0|Red Tails is very good in regards to its historical facts although they added a love story in it to keep you watching.  I think that all people should watch this movie just to learn what African American contribute to history.
0517543052|5.0|Open this work to any page and come away with a meditation to carry with you each time and learn to apply in each and every moment of life. This classic of the 1960's and 70's remains an eye opener that enlightens and entertains. The clever illustrations along with the many passages that are presented in the most simple manner helps the reader to realize the basics of what a true compassionate and humanitarian path can be. The ultimate goal is expressed in the title itself. Additional insights and cautions are presented and then we are left to figure it out for ourselves; which is ever true to Ram Dass who has always sought to enlighten without interfering. This is a deep work of love filled with humor, insight and deep humility.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I really like dystopian novels, but after awhile they run together and are repetitive. This series is really unique and the descriptions of the silos are well thought out. You can really see the people climbing, running up and down. The characterization is spot on. I was blown away by the whole concept and was wondering how the author came up with it. Even if you are not into dystopia, this book will draw you in and keep you awake nights reading!
B0024FA9IM|1.0|this is one of the worst debauchery seance space balls. I grew up watching the tv show and it was ok (good for its time) but this piece of filth should be washed from our collective consonances. there is no real coherent plot or any of the classic characters, i of course relies that it is imposable to take 60 tv types and translate that to the big screen. well apparent its also imposable to make it at all interesting instead of just stuff happening.
B006BGZJJ4|1.0|I agree 100% with this comment on the power cord because it exactly matches my experience and I could not state the problem or my dissatisfaction any better:<br /><br />\\"Why do the Kindle power cords deteriorate?<br /><br />I bought this because my original Kindle power cord completely deteriorated. All the shielding on the cable crumbled off. I have never seen anything like this on any other product, but I have since learned this happens frequently with Kindles. Amazon, why such an obvious quality problem and why do you allow it to go unaddressed??\\"
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love this app! It has any version of the scripture you could want and has several different devotionals to help you where you are at in your walk. I have truely enjoyed this app and highly recommend it.
B0081L37Z0|5.0|I enjoyed watching this movie thoroughly. I hate that I paid four dollars just for it to go on sale the week after for 99c, but that is my stupidity for not waiting. The movie is not at all like the trailers indicated it would be (in my opinion) but that is a good thing. This is a must watch and there is nobody better to rent or buy it from than amazon.
B005EWDA9M|4.0|A facinating and intriguing story which was hard to put down.<br />A very unique style of writing which draws you in.<br />I would recommemnd this trilogy to anyone who wants an alternative to the run of the mill type of story.
B004I744AS|5.0|I am a writer, and I find this app very useful! Also, it's very easy on the battery!  I highly recommend the app to everyone who has trouble remembering the many definitions of words!
B000I5Y8ZU|5.0|I was very happy to order this cd as i was wanting it for a long time i just couldn't find it for the right price.I was very pleased on how fast it arrived and that it was in better condition than what was advertised.  Listened to the cd for an entire day and was so happy .
B000002BHE|5.0|I recently purchased the CD Falling Into You by Celine Dion and just love it I love all of her music and this CD was no exception.
B007L3BMGA|4.0|Good book, i only read this due to the hype but glad i did. Nothing amazing but worth a read
B007IYWY3C|4.0|I'm a HUGE Florence and The Machine fan, I have all the CD's and this one was no exception. I listened to it quite a few times, but in the end I still prefer the studio versions best.
B0086700CM|4.0|i loved it at first but after a while it got boring if its still free get it... its worth it. but its not worth buying.
B006RUJST6|5.0|This was an incredible read, well written, the story line and the poetry (and i dont even like poetry).  Colleen Hoover  can write a book  anytime and I'll read it! I'm going to read the sequel, but I can't see it being any better than this.<br /><br />P.s. I wouldn't be surprised if this book gets made into a film!
B007SGM084|5.0|I would certainly like to meet Mr. Christian Grey!  It was very hard to put these books down! I wonder if there will be more to come?
B0059XTTW8|3.0|The story in this film, the search for the internal high ranking British intelligence agent who is giving information to the Russians in the 1970, is good. So too is the acting. But I felt that the film moved much too slow. There were many instances where people simply stared at each other and said nothing. I understand why this was done and the message it intends to tell us, but I would have preferred much more action.
0345803485|5.0|I have read the 50 Shades trilogy.  I loved the books, but they are clearly not for everyone.  There are a lot of people who say its like they were written by a teenage girl.  I would just like to remind them that this book is from a 22 year old woman's point of view. One who has lived a somewhat sheltered life and was a virgin. The writing had to match the age of the character.  As for the billionaire, who at 26 has accomplished more than what is believable, its why its called fiction. Yes, he is quite possibly the most interesting man in the world.  He is also not real, obviously.  FICTION!!  If you don't read all 3 books, then you dont really understand that's its just more than the sex. Did I get annoyed with reading for the billionth time...\\" his mouth pressed into a hard line\\" - absolutely.  There were a lot of words and phrases that were repeated over and over and over, and it did annoy me. But I just looked past it because the story was a good one. Its about a man, who had a horrible beginning to life and was further twisted by a sick, older woman when he was a teenager. This, my friends is what led him into the darker side of sex.  And I know that just about everyone has had their own little fantasies about what its like to experiment with bondage or pain or both in the bedroom. Maybe even rough sex, if not the other things. And if you say you haven't, you're a liar!. So please, just stop dissecting the book and read it...them.
B0002HZLWI|5.0|I got these for my son's first birthday and I have not given them to him yet. I couldn't wait for him to go to sleep so that I could play with them! It was so easy to make a building that was interesting and beautiful. We already own the Sevilla collection and the Eenie Meenie Zoo collection, and I can't wait to add more. The storage bag has a great image screened on it, but the material is linen or thin canvas and does not appear durable. It doesn't bother me though.
B004FRX0MY|1.0|This was a really great service that stood out in stark contrast against the simply awful iTunes store. Simple, straightforward and generous. I was hooked. The update that splits the drive from the player reminds me of Netflix's blunder last year. This change has made my accounts confusing and annoying. I'll be cancelling at the end of my subscription. The future is supposed to be easier, not unnecessarily complicated. Sorry Amazon. If it ain't broke...
B006LSZECO|1.0|Why did she end it like that?  I think she ran out of ideas and took the lazy way out.  I couldn't put this book down, and had high hopes for a great ending.  So many books do this to me I guess I shouldn't be surprised.  If you do read it, just don't expect a satisfying ending.  7/8ths of the  book is very enjoyable, but that last 1/8th is pretty important...

B000059HB7|5.0|It's often said that the three greatest westerns are The Searchers, Rio Bravo, and Red River. While Searchers and Red River (big cattle drive type movie) are made on a grand scale, Rio Bravo is a smaller, more intimate film. Much of it actually takes place in-doors, especially in the small jail and sheriff's office where Walter Brennan and Ricky Nelson are often seen with Wayne just shootin' the bull and hanging out and singing the occasional cowboy tune.<br /><br />The film sports an all-star cast, including Dean Martin, Walter Brennan,  Ward Bond, Angie Dickinson, future TV star Claude Akins, and others. Wayne plays a more complex character here, not simply the uncomplicated macho-type with which he's usually associated, and not so different from his last movie, The Shootist, which was still many years in the future.<br /><br />The movie gets much of its appeal as well as drama from this more intimate style of story telling as the characters interact and get to know each other on several levels as the movie progresses. Martin does a great job as the recovering alcoholic deputy who's still fast with a gun. Ricky Nelson does a fine job in a supporting role as the young gunslinger. And Brennan is terrific as the handicapped but cantankerous old coot who's sticks by his friend Wayne through thick and thin.<br /><br />A little trivia here, Lauren Bacall's character in The Shootist, where she is referred to as \\"the widow, Bond,\\" is a reference to Ward Bond who was an omni-present character actor for decades and appeared in a number of Wayne films--26 if I remember right--the most of any actor. \\"Ward\\" was short for \\"Wardell\\" I recently found out. Wayne and Bond met in college playing football at the Univ. of Southern California, where they began a lifelong friendship and movie collaboration.<br /><br />With a fine script by Leigh Bracket (who would later achieve fame as a science fiction story writer) and score by Dmitri Tiomkin to round out the film's charms, it's a timeless classic from Howard Hawkes that is still worth watching today.eless classic from Howard Hawkes that is still worth watching today.

B004UQ03P2|4.0|This is arguably the best Mac screen protector out there. Perfect fit on my screen, does not get easily dirty and significantly reduces glare. My only issue with this item is that YOU (the user) can tell without a doubt that you have a screen protector on your laptop. This protector reduces the crisp, clear, image / video quality that Apple is famous for and this might be a major factor is a lot of people. In a nut shell once the protector is applied our screen becomes more Windows quality instead of Mac quality.
B002M9WW30|5.0|I'm 19 so I wasn't alive to see the originals when they came out but I discovered them on the internet and have watched all of them. I am a huge Stallone and Rambo fan. The Rocky story is just beautiful. I love the emotion, the action, the pain, the triumph, and the love. I think these movies are a must to watch because they will inspire you to be a better man and a better American. I always get a little watery eyed when I hear The Measure of Man and I think of all the final scenes when Rocky has won his fight and Adrian is in his arms and the American flag is draped around him and his face is so bruised. It just gets me right there. I think it's the triumph over pain and fear that is the most beautiful, there's no feeling like it in the world. I love the scenes with the stairs too. The patriotism and pureness of the films is very obvious. The other element that I love in these movies is the relationship between Rocky and Adrian. I love how he pulls her out and loves her for all she is. I love how he says \\"You're never getting rid of me.\\" I think we need more positive marital messages in today's entertainment like this. I was heartbroken in the final movie when Adrian is dead. It makes the series very powerful but I miss her character very much. I can't help but feel the pain that Rocky does. My prayers go out for Sylvester now with the death of his son. Seeing young Sage in the movie must be so difficult for him. His real life loss must be horrible. But Sylvester is a great guy and I know that he believes and lives by his movies. He will overcome the loss. Yo Adrian, I did it!!!!!!!!

B004XANKVO|5.0|This backpack has become my everyday pack.  It is has plenty of room, but is dimensioned so that you never have to dig to find something.  The hard shell case portion on the top front is a hit with me.  Makes keeping my glasses and phone safe and easily accessible a breeze.<br /><br />The kangaroo pouch weirded me out at first, but I can't tell you how nice it is to have a place to quickly, and securely, stuff something when you don't have time to unzip a compartment.<br /><br />Carrying two notebook computers and more is a breeze.  But, when it is not full, it still has a compact appearance/feel.<br /><br />I typically sling the pack over my right shoulder.  The wide straps really make it easy to get this bag on my shoulder and in a position to where it stays (and does not slip downward).<br /><br />Expensive?  Not really.  Certainly not when you compare it to some of the Timbuk2s and other good quality packs.  Throw in the kangaroo pouch and the hard shell top pocket, and it is a whole lot of pack and convenience for a very reasonable price.

B005CRQ4XI|3.0|I had mixed reactions to this book.<br /><br />As a disclaimer, I would like to point out that I am not in the target audience for this book. I am 58 and male. I read the book because I am a backpacker. The book sells mostly to young, slim (probably athletic) women. Why do I make this assertion? I went to Cheryl Strayed's event and book-signing. 95% of the large audience (Ms. Strayed is a rock star) fit this target market. The other 5% probably came for the electronic, new-age musician.<br /><br />If I were in the target market, if I had identified more strongly with Ms. Strayed (or her 24-year old self), I would probably have loved this book. If you can identify with Cheryl Strayed, then you may love this book.<br /><br />If you cannot form this bond, you may dislike the book because of the follow reasons:<br /><br />1. The language and metaphors are fairly pedestrian. I kept thinking, I have heard that analogy or phrasing in many books (often self-help books, no accident that Ms. Strayed was a self-help columnist). The author usually avoids obvious cliches, but if you reflect upon media discussions that focus on personal growth, you will recognize most of the language. For example, the author loves the adverb, \\"profoundly.\\" She also uses some obvious tricks to make the writing seem compelling: sexual obscenities (not an objection for me, but more of an author tic) and exaggerating verbs -- \\"destroyed\\" for tired and \\"shattered\\" for distraught or depressed. Not terrible, but not Joan Didion or Dave Eggers.<br /><br />2. Cheryl Strayed likes metaphor as the primary tool in story-telling (call it approach A). She made this comment in the event that I attended. Many authors, however, focus upon precise, sensory detail to show depth of character, point of view, voice and story development. For these authors (call this approach B), focusing upon metaphor creates overwrought story-telling. Approach B is not a law (no laws in story-telling). I, however, like approach B. If you like approach A, then read the book. To be fair, the author did use a lot of good detail, but it was not the primary driver for the story.<br /><br />3. Almost all of the flashbacks to Strayed's last few years (of her drug-use, frantic-sex, relationship-destroying period) were linked to the on-the-trail narrative through metaphor. In addition to liking approach A, Strayed did not have much chance to really reflect or think about her mental or social problems on the trail. As she wrote, she was surviving -- wrestling with some incredible discomforts or worrying about some big problems (enough water or possibly woman-eating mountain lions). To weave her recent life problems into the narrative, Strayed, the writer, needed her thematic or metaphorical links. For example, coming upon a long, snowed-over section of the trail gives her an image and loose theme (snow and hardship) to write about how she had to shoot her beloved horse in the snow to euthanize the poor creature. That description would have stood better on its own; it was perhaps the most powerful mini-story in the book. It did not gain as a flashback from her trail problems. Moreover, the trail flow was broken unnecessarily by the horse story. She switched back and forth, through metaphor, repeatedly. Chopping up the PCT trail narrative this extensively diffused the trail tension. The metaphors were not strong or original enough to overcome the structural problems.<br /><br />If you, however, feel a deep, powerful identification with  the author, this structural point will probably not be a problem for you.<br /><br />4. While focusing upon metaphor, the author avoids some obvious problems and explanations: Her pre-trail use of heroin ballooned into an almost daily habit for months. People become strongly addicted when using heroin at this frequency. Ms. Strayed never mentions withdrawal after stopping the habit almost cold-turkey. If she had suffered withdrawal, it would have been a horrific experience.Why did she avoid mentioning that issue?<br /><br />Likewise, when she takes a serious fall, dropping down a rocky trail with her impossible-to-carry pack, she writes about the aftermath as if she had suffered a painful but superficial knee-scrape. Reality check: when I have suffered falls that severe on a trail, I have torn ligaments or cartilage, effectively ending my trip. It seems that Cheryl Strayed is blessed with extremely good luck after a number of ordinarily crippling events (high frequency injections of street heroin, falling hard down rocks with a 50 lbs. backpack crushing her, almost getting raped by some lunatic, getting her feet so blistered that most skin peeled off...). Are all the escapes and endurance-of-crippling-pain possible? Yes. If you are a Navy Seal. Memory is subjective, and any of us can enhance a story from repeated retelling.<br /><br />5. The author's pre-trail behavior (extreme impulsiveness) fits borderline personality disorder (BPD). This impulsiveness suggests much more than just Strayed's explanation -- grief. Grief could have triggered this mental illness, but not explained it. I can understand that Strayed did not want to crimp her character's possibilities with a psychiatric diagnosis. BPD, however, is a serious and real mental illness, and its treatment almost always means a much longer ordeal than a three month hike. Although a three month wilderness journey can be life-changing, it is almost never a cure for serious mental illness. Again, the author endures almost unbelievable mental and physical hardship, and never slows in her forward motion.<br /><br />Finally, what kept me reading was not the description of the wilderness (which was interesting), but rather my curiosity about how Cheryl Strayed would tie together all of her themes and potential solutions. She did it, characteristically, with some metaphors. (Crater Lake was a mountain with a heart torn out, that eventually healed -- like her.) As far as how she got herself together enough to stop life-threatening impulsiveness: inexplicable trail-magic transformed her -- somehow loosening the grief inside of her. (She wrote that the trail was not just a journey outside, but more of a journey inside. I think of literary types advising: show, don't tell. The words \\"inside\\" and \\"outside\\" are lackluster figures of speech and poor substitutes for \\"showing\\" descriptions of the internal or external.) I came away thinking that Strayed was waving some magic wands of metaphor, and not telling the whole story -- perhaps in many ways.<br /><br />The Kindle format -- one final point:<br /><br />The quotes from literature under the section headings on my Kindle (a new, basic version) are garbled. These same quotes in the print version are right justified, and are readable. The quotes in the Kindle version are crushed as a one-character column on the right margin and continue, scrambled, for multiple pages. They are unreadable.<br /><br />Amazon and readers need to do something about shoddy publishing products. We are paying $12.99 for this e-book. Readers need to demand more -- have an old iPad for example to buy a clean version if it is available. Also, protest when publishers deliver this crap.

B000E41MS6|5.0|From a long-time Trekkie: The new series of Doctor Who takes it to a world that Doctor Who has never visited before: incredible special effects! The effects are movie-class and the \\"steam punk\\" effects that they used on the inside of the new TARDIS is right on target. The best part of all is that none of this has compromised any of the writing.. it is all first class by incredible writers. The production is grest, the actors are great, the stories are great, the music is great and the effects are great. There's not really anything else to ask for in a sci-fi show.<br /><br />As a long time Trekkie, I can say that this show easily fills the bill while there are no Treks on the air. It is witty, intelligent, romantic, action-filled and funny all at once. I was leary the first time I watched an episode of this series because I was never a fan of the old Doctor Who because of the cheap effects and low production values.. but those days are gone and Doctor Who has become a first-class sci-fi show (which we so badly need). Don't let any past preconceptions of the show stop you from watching this.. you won't regret it.<br /><br />The percentage of good shows that they produce (verses \\"bad\\" shows) is MUCH higher that NextGen. I loved NextGen, but they had some real dog episodes (Royale, anyone?). I can honestly say that, in the six seasons that Doctor Who has been back on, there has not been one episode that I simply did not like. Some are better than others, but they're all good. Rewatchability is extremely high.. there is so much to see in each episode.<br /><br />If you are a Trek fan, I definately think you'll like this. The doctor get's to play the Spock/Data roll, always commenting on human society from a third person point-of-view. There is that perfect mix of drama, action, humor and romance to make it play very much like a Trek ep.. although there tends to be a bit more humor than in Trek. There are some lessons (usually about humanity.. go figure), but none that are shoved in your face.. think NextGen vs TOS. There is ofter an enterage of people who make up the cast and the plots can be quite engaging. It is a serial, with each week depending on the previous (like Voyager and Enterprise). It IS interesting going from the beautiful white Enterprise to a little blue box, but I simply can't picture a Trekkie not liking this show.<br /><br />The biggest bonus of the DVD is the Confidentials. They are like documentries about each episode that include interviews with cast and crew.. many of the interviews quite candid. One of the biggest thing about the Confidentals is how surprised you'll be at the actual number of special effects that are in the show.. so many of them are so good that they go unnoticed.<br /><br />Pick this one up, watch it on streaming.. do whatever it takes. Once you start watching, you'll be hooked.re shoved in your face.. think NextGen vs TOS. There is ofter an enterage of people who make up the cast and the plots can be quite engaging.

B006RUJST6|5.0|I was apprehensive at first to read this book, first because of the slam poetry aspect. I've heard some before and quite frankly, didn't get the draw to it, nor did I understand it. I was also nervous about the age of the character, 18 but still in high school. I was afraid it was going to be a bit immature. I was wrong on all of it. This book is great. It draws you in brings out so many emotions. I even got the point of slam poetry after being able to read the words and take time to understand the poets meaning behind it and began to enjoy it more throughout the book. The characters in the book are fantastic. Colleen is a great writer and has definitely found her calling.

This book has it all - chick lit, mystery, relationship issues, plot twists, character development, etc. Great writer.<br /><br />Yes, the end is.... weird. I'm not sure what I expected (Amy dying a horrible death perhaps). There was no end. It just WAS. It leaves us to wonder what happens - does she have the baby? does she love it? does Nick? is the baby going to be crazy? do they live happily ever after? does anyone ever figure out what Amy did? I'm still wondering. Good job author!
1592332803|5.0|I absolutely love this book and every recipe I've tried in it! When I was packing my stuff to move into my new apartment, I asked my mom if she wanted any of my cookbooks that I don't use. She responded, \\"No, but I'll take The Joy of Vegan Baking.\\" Instead of giving her my copy, I gifted her with her own.<br /><br />I think this book is perfect for anyone who is interested in veganism, but is scared they'll be deprived. Brownies, lemon bars, chocolate cheesecake, COOKIES. My next recipe that I HAVE to try is her No-Bake Strawberry Pie with Chocolate Chunks.<br /><br />Colleen does a fantastic job creating recipes that have (mostly) average ingredients that any cupboard would have.<br /><br />I'd buy this book again and again.

I have recommended it to knitters of all levels of experience, because it's so handy. It's also spiral bound so it folds flat but is small enough to tuck in your knitting bag. The author herself works in a yarn shop and made all the samples so you know they're accurate and will turn out as shown. Fabulous!
B0040JHWKS|5.0|Believe it or not, this was my first true introduction to Springsteen.<br /><br />Of course I've been exposed to the man's music my whole life, it just never really clicked with me. In fact for a period of time, I just flat out didn't like his music, at least what i'd heard. I always found quick reasons not to like it or be too interested in it. The main reason being, most of what the casual listener, such as I was, hears is \\"Born In The USA\\" and \\"Dancing In The Dark\\" type songs played on infinite repeat from radio stations. Get's a little old, and there didn't (at the time) ever seem to be much depth to it, at least for my tastes.<br /><br />I remember coming across his album \\"Nebraska\\" being referenced one time in a article I was reading. Sounded like an interesting album from the description, stark recording, just him and his guitar, and I liked the dust bowl themed cover. I ended up picking it up, I liked it, but quickly forgot about it, not exploring it too much (it would later become one of my favorites). I didn't really do much but play it through once or twice though, but, something stuck in my head, kind of a change of heart about the guy that I always though was too poppy. There was an intensity to the vocal delivery, and i liked the lack of production.<br /><br />Fastforward to the release of \\"The Promise\\", I kind of filed it away as something that may be interesting, due to the fact that they were outtakes, not polished to much by production (some are though), and again I was intrigued by the stark rustic cover. So out of curiosity I just went ahead and picked it up, needing something new and different to listen to. The 1st track an early take of \\"Racing in The Street ('78)\\" had me from the beginning. i loved the slow build from the piano and the way his vocals capture more and more honest emotion as he makles his way through the verses. From there on track for track I found myself more and more interested in what I was hearing. This wasn't the chessy rock guy that I had originally formulated in my head. This was an artist capturing honesty and emotion through some kind of a hybrid mix of rock and folk, with some jazz mixed in here and there, I loved it.<br /><br />I do not feel it nessesary to go through reflections track by track in this review, as I'm sure, if your already a Springsteen fan, you know what your getting into, however, if your curious and still wondering about him and this collection, listen to the wonderful sound samples provided above, they will give you a taste of what is contained within these works selected from the \\"Darkness On The Edge of Town\\" sessions.<br /><br />This album is such a great broad scope of this man's talents and styles, that is sure to be a good introduction to someone curious about what Springsteen is all about. I was never interested in Springsteen, as I mentioned above, but after this purchase, I went on to obtain the majority of his works, all of which have been great to listen too, I just needed the proper introduction, and \\"The Promise\\" was it!<br /><br />Be sure and pick up \\"Darkness on The Edge of Town\\" as a companion piece to this, if you do not already own it that is.

B007IXWL2C|1.0|Impossible to classify this as good literature.  It appears edgy-out there-because of the soft (?) porn. Although the dom's methods or tools change, the descriptions do not vary much.  If you want it for a turn-on, then forget reading the plot and find the sex scenes (which due to the repetition get rather boring).  The plus for this book is the idea of anticipation and foreplay.  Besides the writing, another negative is the tiresome \\"I can save or change this poor tortured guy.\\"  It also is troublesome that a young girl can lose her strength and ambition even though the author gives a bit of \\"lip-service\\" via protestations by Anna that she must work and do things her way. Right....

I know the pricing is a little steep but this company is trust worthy and makes different car parts - like bicycle racks and more - so I knew the material would be of quality! And it is! This backpack is also big, so if you want a small backpack do not get this one.<br />Good Points:<br />* Great size<br />* Great material<br />* Perfect for 17\\" laptop - mine is an ASUS and fit fine<br />* Did fit a laptop, iPad, shoes, clothes, books, electronic accessories, sunglasses and phone :) personally Tested<br />* Cute as can be<br />Bad Points:<br />* None! If the price is too high- this company also sells a tad big smaller backpacks for a little less, but I felt the price was justified because this backpack is going to last me forever!

After reading them in a week the first time round I was so captivated that I had to start reading them all over again.  Then I read a much shorter book and I thought I'd skim read the first book again but got sucked in and read them all over again.  I don't know if I'm strong enough to be able to put them away now, I'll have to get my hands on another interesting series.  Any suggestions anyone??<br />I don't care what everyone else says about Fifty Shades being all about sex, it's not! It's a beautiful love story and you just have to read it.  I think everyone should read it.
B000FBFN1U|3.0|Ok, I loved the first two books and have gushed about the intricate characters, the deep interplay of loyalty, family, honor, God, and other complex motivations that are constantly at play, and the fantastical settings.  And let's not forget Martin's ear for dialogue and wry turns of phrase.<br /><br />So why did I find it so hard to slog through book three?<br /><br />Perhaps it's my fault I jumped into three right after finishing two.  But I read this one with a much more critical eye.  There is fat, and lots of it.  There are some stories that are simply not as interesting as others, and some characters who don't seem to evolve much at all (I don't want to give any spoilers).<br /><br />And yes, the last 20% (for Kindle readers only) really picks up and there are plot twists and episodes of true poignancy and drama -- but it sure took a long time to get there.
034580404X|4.0|Fifty Shades of Grey was a real page turner for sure. I am now halfway through Fifty Shades Darker and enjoy the exciting romance between Christian and Anastasia...
B000VDDWE2|5.0|This is a great movie. It is also scary to watch. People say this is a warning that this movie will one day become part of our life's. I heard that the person who wrote this movie is a person who has been warning people about this happening. No one was listening to him. So that is why he made the movie. I don't know if that is all true. But I hope we can make a change in our way of living so this wont happen to us.<br /><br />Besides that this is an awesome movie. That you don't want to miss. The sadist scene for me is with the cancer child who's parents didn't go for him and the nurse stayed by his side the whole time. My sister had cancer around that little boy's age. I know that is just a movie, but I can't see how his parents couldn't go be with him. That scene makes my eyes water.
B0084B5TK8|4.0|This is a gothic tale to end all gothic tales. Forget Twilight and any other teen pop book out there at the moment, this is the real deal. Romantic, well written and of stunning originality, this is the story which started the vampire phenomenon.<br /><br />Composed as a set of letters and journal entries we follow Jonathan Harker and his encounters with one Count Dracula. Forget the myths and find out for yourself why this is considered one of the best books of all time.
B000FC1HBY|5.0|Awesome read, hard to put down.  I'm looking forward to reading the entire series.  Well written and well thought out.
B0015DWJX2|5.0|I loved this book. Juliet is a spunky character with a huge heart. Although there were very sad passages, the book was uplifting.
1401235417|5.0|Comic publishers have been using the \\"reboot\\" strategy for years as a cyclical hedge against stagnating sale. . . errr. . . storylines.  So I had completely avoided DC's \\"New 52\\" reboot despite my lifelong love of that universe and its characters.  Snyder's writing in this omnibus immediately grabbed me and changed my mind.  There's an ever-intriguing mix of the familiar with the reinvented here that results in something entertaining and innovative as opposed to ham-handed or overworked.  Greg Capullo's pencils are top notch as well, although some of the action sequences are more difficult to follow than they should be.  Overall, I found \\"The Court of Owls\\" to be a really plesant surprise and based on it, I may even give some of the other \\"New 52\\" titles a shot after all.
B007L3BMGA|2.0|Chances are this review isn't going to sway you either way. I should preface this by saying if you're curious about this book you may as well read it. It is interesting and engaging at times. However, it certainly doesn't live up to the title of being the fastest selling book of all time.<br /><br />While the story is far from bland and the sex scenes are hot at times, the characters are one-dimensional and the writing is poor in terms of craft. Phrases such as 'oh my' and 'down there' are far too overused, as are references to the main character's 'inner goddess'.<br /><br />I don't want to be overly negative, but if you're looking for well thought out and well-written erotica, I'm sure there's much better out there.<br /><br />There are a million people out there who will disagree, but do some research and spend your money on something less trodden are more creative.
B000PAAJYW|5.0|There was a time when making films that were going against all possible rules in the profession was a dear pastime of some film makers. This film is one of these. Everything is upside down.<br /><br />First an irritating musical sound tracks behind and often over the dialogue. The absolutely absurd succession of short sequences of characters that have nothing in common at first sight and even at second sight. Some connections only become clear at the very end of the film. A lot of old people who have been forgotten on burial day though they are more ghostlike than just plain phantoms,, oops! Sorry, sorry senior citizens, all in the process of dying of all kinds of unnameable ailments, mostly cancer if I heard the words properly in the short silences of the music track.<br /><br />All of them are abominable. Particularly the men, but at the same time the women are not better, subservient and only interested in the security they are and have been provided with. Some are vultures even, and openly so. The younger ones are not more presentable. A drug addict, a social climber, and a few others. We are in the deepest pit of a zoo and all the predators were put together down there like twenty spiders in a pot.<br /><br />Among these one cop who is a fool who believes people can repent and even repair their mistakes and that his real function is to forgive them and by forgiving them lead them into reforming. Marvellous, divine, angelic, with a good dose of sugar on top and whip cream &agrave; la mode.<br /><br />But for such an end to be reached you need a miracle and the miracle happens in the middle of the night after everyone has failed, flunked, fled away from their responsibilities, confessed their crimes. The worse oldie is that dying man who bluntly and flatly tells us that he was in love with his wife, his high school crush, sweetheart, but that he cheated on her for twenty-two or twenty-three years just because he wanted her to be a man since she was intelligent and could not be a woman. Closet homosexual who finally abandoned her in the hands of their son who was at the time under age to take care of a dying mother. Absolutely pathetic and that son finally arrives and cries on the bed of his dying father. This time burlesque.<br /><br />And to make that miracle of reformation happen God will send a powerful sign in the middle of the night from the sky and that I won't reveal. But it really is Mark Twain revisited. The taller the tale, the more believable. Though it turns this story into a farce, a grotesque commedia dell arte prank. So what's left at the end?<br /><br />This world is neurotic at least, psychotic in the middle and schizophrenic at most or at best. We don't live in our minds and in our gentility. We live in the surrounding noise of constant elevator music which at times sounds like a tornado in a culvert. We are blended, mashed, pureed by this constant continuous sound track and we start reacting like demented puppets suffering from Gilles de la Tourette syndrome, a condition that causes people to make repeated, nervous tic-like movements and utter innumerable swear words strung up like never-ending necklaces of excrement. This is a serious disease and the film seems to tell us it is the normal condition of everyday life for everybody starting as soon as the person can utter two words and they probably don't say mama or papa any more in Los Angeles, but rather kaka and some onomatopoeia for the backside hole that brings the soul to the fundament of the body, the backside exhaust pipe of the individual, the AAA-soul.<br /><br />But if that is the depth of our lot then God is right to send some severe punishment down onto us to make us recapture some dignity. By the way, you will probably see that Tom Cruise could do better than he does in many of his films. He must have been inspired by this story of AAA-souls lost in the mud of senior-citizenship and midlife crisis.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAUd not be a woman.

B007KZY1YY|2.0|Not the best book I have ever read and certainly does not live up to the hype surrounding the triology.
B00843TZJM|5.0|The beauty is in the intensity and the flaws are part of it. The Band is \\"on\\" (yes, I mean \\"on\\" to include the 3 older guys in the front!) The quality of the recording is stellar. Yes, the criticisms about some out of tune vocals are correct....but this is just from one particular night...MOST of the time the vocals are great. And Stephen Stills is on fire (guitar) and hey, vocally he may not be what he was...but this stuff is passionate and real. I dare anybody to listen to \\"Johnny's Garden\\" and say he isn't giving it 100%. For us long time CSN fans, you ought to be able to admit you are in it for the passion and the reality of the music...If you've seen a show in the last 25 years, you know that some are mind-blowing, some good, some just so-so. This one veers between good and mind-blowing. I can only hope that the guys have a plan to release some other shows from the last 25-30 years!

0374203032|4.0|Earlier reviewers have worked through most of the pros and cons of What Money Can't Buy. None, however, picks up on what to me is the single most stimulating sentence in the book. On p. 10 Sandel notes that we have never had a proper debate about the relations among moral, political, and economic issues. He continues: \\"As a result, without quite realizing it, without ever deciding to do so, we drifted from [being a society] having a market economy to being a market society.\\" The italics are Sandel's--the only authorial italics in the book--and the sentence is the underlying thesis of the book.<br /><br />Since Sandel develops his thesis anecdotally rather than analytically, it is useful expand on his italics. A society \\"having a market economy\\" is a situation in which some overarching value system manages relations among people (\\"society\\") and uses a market economy as a tool to manage economic affairs. \\"The market\\" is not an autonomous system that runs itself but a subordinate system managed by a combination of public and private managers. Those managers, in theory, would guide the economy according to the value system organizing social relationships. For the United States that value system is summarized in the second paragraph of the Declaration of Independence, beginning with the \\"self-evident truth\\" that \\"all [people] are created equal.\\"<br /><br />A \\"market society,\\" on the other hand, is a situation in which market forces embody both the overarching value system and the autonomous power to direct not only all economic function but also all relations among people. The Market, in free market ideology, is the dominant legitimizing force, providing the ultimate sanction for all relationships--economic, political, institutional, personal. It supplants the roles of government, religion, education, family, and tradition. It destroys the very idea of a legitimate public realm. It inexorably monetizes more and more of life. Money increasingly serves as the fundamental value on which all choices are based.<br /><br />And that is why the individual examples raised by Sandel are so disquieting: they reveal how the Market de-legitimizes all values but money.
B001RIY4WE|5.0|Not only is this blu-ray Blu-Ray. It is packed in with great features, and for its time; the movie has spectacular special effects. Arnold delivers his action, James Cameron wows us in the 90's. Combine all that for a $5 bluray, you can't beat!

Although book four's pace slowed a bit, the entire work is fantastic, from Holston's cleaning and beyond. This is a must read and what indie author's should strive towards.

B008645YEE|2.0|Minimalistic, like the last Zimmer scores. The whole soundtrack revolves around a chant, a two-note motif that never evolved from the first movie and a nice, yet casual, composition for catwoman that has no true emotions underneath.<br /><br />Zimmer has been towards the direction of minimalistic compositions, yet the truth is this compositions only sound great because of all the arrangements he does to those simple melodies. Zimmer is brilliant at arranging his simplistic melodies to achieve a sense of awe. Yet, to the experienced soundtrack listener, the complexity of his past compositions have been a bit mediocre, revolving always around two-note's: the main theme of the Last Samurai (in here it sounded fresh), the main theme heard at the end of The Da Vinci Code, the main theme heard at the end of Inception, the Batman theme... all main themes that are just two notes. Technically speaking, two notes are not a melody. Play the batman theme on a piano... come on, or a flute, a guitar perhaps?... it sounds really lazy.<br /><br />Now play the main theme from Schindler's List on piano, or the Hobbit's theme from Lord of the Rings, or the Braveheart theme... there are many fantastic themes that are just that: fantastic, beautiful, melodic, full of emotion and complexity. But what Zimmer does with his two-notes is wrap them around bombastic sound effects and really well done arrangements so that it sounds imposing. A different way of composing, yet I feel the amount of effort invested on this kind of compositions is less than the one invested in composing something truly melodic and complex that has much more than two notes... and they can also be imposing when the respective composers decide to lure them with orchestral arrangements.<br /><br />So, at the end, Zimmer does regular compositions with exceptional arrangments. You can take it or leave it but the truth is that (at least for his latest main themes). Put into other words, imagine soundtrack composers had thegift of designing faces; Zimmer creates average ordinary faces (visually speaking), but then he applies the proper make-up to them and, at the end, they appear to look beautiful for the casual eye. But if you take that make-up off, you'll find the truth. Other composers make beautiful faces from the beginning that look beautiful without the need of make-up (of course, they can also apply make up to those naturally-looking beautiful faces and create something you'll never forget).<br /><br />Four years have passed since the last Dark Knight score and Zimmer knew this soundtrack would be extremely anticipated. Trilogy scores are really difficult to pull off because you need to sound refreshing and unique in every episode without deviating too much from the familiar sound so that people still feel inside the same story. Howard Shore and John Williams did it with Lord of the Rings and Star Wars to a point of perfection, introducing new outstanding themes for every episode while still capturing the same essence of the story's atmosphere; in the last episode they where able to tie things up by reuniting all the main themes created throughout the trilogy and introducing new refreshing themes that were equally great.<br /><br />Zimmer bet everything on the past themes and composed two new theme's for the new characters but nothing new for the emotional final inner struggle of Bruce Wayne: this can be appreciated in the track \\"Rise\\"... just the same track of \\"A Dark Knight\\" with small pieces of Batman Begins and \\"I'm Not A Hero\\" glued in. Zimmer can do better, and we all know that.<br /><br />Hans Zimmer's new sound has been tilted towards the electronical side also; like a DJ remixing pieces of past compositions with new electronic sounds, Zimmer achieves the sound of a modern pop CD instead of a classical orchestral score, with the end result of a very unnatural sound for the listener.<br /><br />The only true new material heard in here is Catwoman's Theme (Mind If I CutIn) and Bane's Theme (Gotham's Reckoning) and a very uplifting, yet short, track entitled \\"Why Do We Fall?\\". The BIG track of the score is \\"Imagine the Fire\\" were Hans Zimmer is able to capture the final confrontation between Bane and Bruce Wayne. This cue, along with \\"Gotham's Reckoning\\" and \\"Why Do We Fall\\" are the true highlights because they sound fresh and, at the same time, familiar with the Batman world. But we are kept waiting for a light at the end of the darkness and the light is brought upon us with \\"Rise\\", only this time it doesn't sound refreshing.<br /><br />Howard Shore wrote, on Return of the King, that he read a message while having lunch on those final days of recording. It said: \\"It is good to begin well, it is better to end well.\\"<br /><br />I just feel Hans Zimmer could have ended things better, especially for the conclusion of this amazing story.
B001TH16DI|5.0|This is a very nice set for both Star Trek fans and Sci Fi fans alike. It is loaded with lots of epic space battles with excellent villains and nefarious aliens; and the picture and sound quality are excellent. Each disk has a fair amount of extras as well including trailers and commentaries and interviews and deleted scenes. The bonus disk The Captain's Summit interviews with William Shatner, Patrick Stewart, Leonard Nimoy, Jonathan Frakes and Whoopi Goldberg was very entertaining as well<br /><br />Star Trek: The Motion Picture - A powerful gigantic and unknown destructive force named V'Ger is heading it's way towards the Earth and it is up to Captain James T. Kirk and the Enterprise crew to try and stop it. Amazing special effects. The return of the original veteran TV series cast reunites together on the big screen. A fabulous Jerry Goldsmith musical score. A 10 out of 10.<br /><br />Star Trek 2: The Wrath of Khan - Ricardo Montalban returns to reprise his role as Khan, a mad genetic super soldier who seeks revenge on Captain Kirk for stranding he and his crew on a desolate planet. An exciting action-packed space adventure with great special effects, and it features one of the most quoted movie lines ever, \\"KHAN!\\" A 10 out of 10 rating.<br /><br />Star Trek III: the Search For Spock - Where did Spock go, and who needs to find him, and why? Well, if you haven't seen Star Trek II then I do not want to spoil it for you, but this movie's got space battles with big bad Klingons and more than enough Star Trekking adventure to make for a pretty fun and entertaining threequel. I rate it a solid 9 out of 10.<br /><br />Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home - Honestly, this is not one of my more favorite movies in the series. Kirk and the crew travel back in time to the 1980's in order to save the whales. That's pretty much it. It has some good fish-out-of-water laughs here and there but it needed more space action scenes for my tastes. I've gotta give it credit for trying to do something different though. A 7 out of 10.<br /><br />Star Trek V: The Final Frontier - A lot of people seem to not like this entry in the series but I think it's a pretty fun movie and enjoyed it a lot. A Vulcan hijacks the Enterprise to go on a search for the Supreme Being! That's right. Lots of exciting action sequences and pretty nice special effects and great sets make for a good Sci Fi time at the movies. An 8.5 out of 10.<br /><br />Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country - In a mission to escort a Klingon Chancellor to a Peace Summit meeting between the Federation of Planets and the Klingon Empire, sabotage and deception are the order of the day as an attempt by nefarious interests to disrupt the historic event goes into action. This was the final film of the series featuring the original cast members and what a way to go. Features an engaging storyline, fantastic special effects, action sequences aplenty, this movie has it all for both Sci Fi and Star Trek fans alike. A 9.5 out of 10 rating.<br /><br />All in all this is a great collection for a great price. Scotty, beam this set up.something different though.

B006LSZECO|4.0|When I first started reading \\"Gone Girl\\", I started telling all of my book-lover friends \\"You HAVE to read this book!  It's such a page turner!\\"  It was unlike anything I'd read, the story layout was unique.  BUT.....when I got to the last page, I was like \\"Is it to be continued?  Am I pausing for a commercial break?\\"  It just abruptly ended.  I understand that the author meant for it to be that way, but I'm one of those feel-good-at-the-end-of-a-the-story kind of people.  The book was so creative, the ending was non-existent.<br /><br />I would definitely still recommend the read, though.

B007J4T2G8|5.0|Ok, so this book is amazing. I mean maybe not everybody agrees with me but yeah, I absolutely fell in love with it! Before I read it I thought I wasn't going to like it cause of the BDSM, I mean I thought it was all that and found it weird to read about that but then I decided to give it a try and boy was I wrong! I instantly fell in love with it and couldn't put it down, the trilogy is great I read it in less than a week! There is so much more to Christian and to Anastasia too, the book is not at all what I expected! And I  don't know if anyone else agrees but I would definitely like to read them in Christian's point of view!!

1463514581|4.0|Really good book! Ok, I'll admit I'm doing a book review for the second book, Twenty Nine and a Half Reasons so I  needed to read the first. Mysteries are not my normal type of read but I was going to put my differences with mysteries aside and give this a try.  Well, I don't know about the rest of the mysteries in the world but I can not, CAN NOT wait to read the sequel.<br /><br />I started reading and I had not read the Goodreads synopsis on Twenty Eight and a Half Wishes yet. The first sentence and Rose Gardner is talking about seeing herself being dead. Ok, intriguing. Denise Grove Swank you have got my attention. Forget page 99 I'm fulling committed at line one! But I still had in the back of my head, mystery, don't get your hopes up. I didn't have time to think anything else. The characters took control and had me at their mercy the entire day. Yes, I read this in one day. Honestly I didn't want to put it down.<br /><br />Now there are some negatives, but not many. The plot was really good there are a couple of things like Rose not knowing anything at all about the real world that kind of got to me. But she is psychic, I can only imagine what that would feel like. So, although I'm giving this book a 4.5 there was just the tiniest stuff that got to me. But really, it was a fun read, the characters drove the story in an amazing way. The mystery was not predictable, for the most part. And on top of that Rose even being in dire situations was able to make light of things. I literally laughed out loud multiple times because she would say something while her life was on the line! But really, wouldn't we all do that? Try to diffuse a situation when we have no other hope of getting out? Of course we would! And that is exactly why it worked so well in this book.

B005OV1MX4|1.0|This was my first viewing of La Forza and I will try again with another version.  As the first reviewer says, attempts to add color - ie cowboys - when the setting presumably involves Spaniards and Incas - fall flat.  In fact this production involves a mishmash of historical references that just complicate an already complicated (not complex) opera.  Paradoxically, most of the singing is of the old-fashioed 'park and bark' variety!  I'll try another production before I write the opera off completely.
0439023521|3.0|Collins takes us on a tour of a future society (and government) that has lost its moral compass and shares a type of 'sports violence' reminiscent of the gladiatorial contests of ancient Rome. It dramatizes what can happen when government power becomes over reaching and out of control; in this case, pitting teens against each other in a contest to the death. The book is fast paced and written in a style appealing to the YA market. It does leave the reader with some interesting messages to be pondered. I would rate it good but not great.<br /><br />David Faxon

B000G8NXYG|4.0|Almost everyone gives this excellent film five stars therefore I'm giving it 4 stars.  The reason for this is the over-the-top histrionics characteristic of much of the dialogue.  I know.  I know.  I know.  This is the way the Japanese behave when confronted by stress.  Nonsense.  The Japanese are no more emotive than anybody else.  So what's the explanation?  My guess is that it is a Japanese theatrical convention.  Surely, the Japanese couldn't have achieved major success in business [or war for that matter], if they were so incredibly undisciplined.  At the same time, it is possible that such a convention is obvious because it is foreign.  Very likely American films have their own crazy conventions but, because we have watched U.S. films for so long, the unrealities of U.S. films have become invisible to us.<br /><br />Still, subtracting this emotiveness, this is an exceptional film on many levels.  Given the multiple reviews by critics more gifted than I, I will mention only one fascinating moment.  The very willing girl is 'dishonored' by the young samurai and her father goes ape.  At one point, a villager tries to calm him down by saying, \\"It's not like she was taken by a bandit.\\"  The implication is that unwilling rape is more dishonorable than consensual sex.  Interesting.
B000SEIK2S|5.0|As has been mentioned in some prior reviews the author's style is very reminiscent of Robert Heinlein.  I enjoyed this book very much, to the extent that I immediately followed it with Scalzi's related stories along this line, and am now reading Agent to Stars.  Not only is Scalzi very imaginative, he is also humourous and lively, and his stories have real sense of human decency as well.  I hope he keeps on writing; I'll be looking forward to his next work.

As Fitz struggles to protect the lives of those he loves, others seem intent on pouring themselves out in foolhardy attempts to manipulate the fate of the Farseer dynasty. The Fool and Fitz' relationship is strained almost to breaking point as the narrative hurls them toward adventure and mystery.<br />I have followed the saga thus far through the first trilogy and skipped over the second trilogy in my eagerness to learn more about Fitz and The Fool. Hobb has not disappointed. The writing is detailed and enthralling. I can't wait to find out what happen's next. I think you will feel the same. Start your adventure with Robin Hobb today.
B00004XPPK|5.0|A fascinating film with some brilliant one-liners.  We never get to know exactly what went wrong before Frank and Gilda but it must have been REAL bad.  Frank and Gilda hate each other so much that they are both likely to die of it.  Of course, love and hate are opposite sides of the same coin and this is especially true of Gilda and Frank.  They do everything possible to injure each other.<br /><br />Things get even more complicated because Gilda--'on the rebound', as she puts it--has married Munson [Macready], a highly complex man.  He is cold, greedy and deadly but, at the same time, he has a thread of real humanity and loves his faithless wife.  With such an intense triangle things simply can't go well.  Somehow, we are supposed to feel some sympathy for the Frank character but he is so psychologically twisted that it is difficult to understand why Gilda has such a passion for him.<br /><br />Interestingly, Rita Hayworth apparently claimed that 'Gilda' ruined her life.  She married multiple times but claimed that her husbands fell in love with the screen Gilda [who wouldn't?] but, when they woke up in the morning, they were laying next to flesh-and-blood Hayworth--a woman who, apparently, was nothing like exciting, glittering, tortured Gilda.
B007KCG7MQ|2.0|I am a serious Joe Walsh fan. The James Gang and his pre-Eagles solo albums are what I grew up on and continue to listen to to this day (they're about the only straight-up rock 'n roll from that era that still holds some interest for me). When I heard we'd finally get another solo album from Joe I was psyched. But this is so disappointing in so many ways.<br /><br />The songs are either<br /><br />1) derivative<br />2) ridiculously introspective and/or simplistic lyrics<br />3) badly produced<br /><br />The other musicians sound like mediocre studio hacks. Nothing exciting here for sure.<br /><br />The production is atrocious. Joe's vocals in Spanish Dancer (and a couple other songs) is run through a hideous digital vocal tool that destroys it...probably because he can't sing in the register. It's abysmal.<br /><br />From the man who gave us Turn to Stone, Falling Down, Meadows and so many other masterpieces this is like so much pablum. And you don't know how much it pains me to say that.

B007SGM084|1.0|This series of books is intended to sexually stimulate and to stimulate about deviant sexual behavior.  I never would have purchased them if I had known the subject matter.  They are inappropriate reading.  I realize they are on the best seller list, but that doesn't mean they should be read.  I returned them the morning after I bought them for my kindle.
B008OOYALE|5.0|I think this app is great because I always wanted to play dragonvale and now I'm glad that they finally made this game like the one on the ipad!!!!!

B0064TVQ5E|5.0|This Mahjongg game contains very authentic looking tiles and is challenging for the initiate to the game.  Skill level is probably novice to those somewhat familiar with the tiles.  I really like the fact that it displays multiple forms for play--this increases the challenge.  There is variety available in the background colors which is good for those with visual challenges.  I didn't mind the music for about the first two games and then turned it off--it's not bad, just monotonous!
B006LSZECO|4.0|I picked up one of Gillian Flynn's earlier books, \\"Sharp Objects\\" off a bargain table earlier this year.  In the subsequent months, I have inhaled all of her books, including \\"Gone Girl.\\"  The thing that I like best about Flynn's novels is that she is not interested in creating characters that appeal to readers.  Her main characters are flawed, mean, selfish, disturbed and, in this case at least, really and truly psychopathic.  In \\"Gone Girl,\\" Flynn focuses on the marriage of Nick and Amy Dunne.  The Dunnes are forced to move from New York City to Nick's hometown in Missouri when they both lose their jobs.  As a resident of St. Louis, Missouri, I can attest that the accuracy with which Flynn depicts a dying town on the shores of the Mississippi River is spot on and pitch-perfect.  As she slowly reveals the cracks in the Dunne's marriage--which are put on display for the world to see when Amy mysteriously disappears--the reader learns that neither Nick nor Amy Dunne was a perfect spouse.  But it is not until a twist about mid-way through the novel that the true depths of the characters' dysfunction are revealed.  Writing any more would ruin the surprise, suffice it to say that even if you manage to guess the twist before it happens, you will still be surprised by where things go from there.  Overall, the book is a dark, original and thoroughly entertaining read.  I would highly recommend it.
B007D2XSW0|5.0|i can do anything i want make it really happy or really gloomy i probaly would of not got it if it was not the free app of the day  before  I'm so happy i found out about his app no other app is this good or detailed

B005KELQEU|5.0|Review update: I just upgraded to the Kindle Paperwhite and the case is a perfect fit.  Highly recommended!<br /><br />We're very happy with this case.  Got one for myself and one for my son.  It fits well, looks good and the price is right!
1881273377|5.0|I had purchased the book \\"The 5 Love Languages\\" and honestly I found that it immediately made so much sense!!<br />My husband does not enjoy reading and so I ordered the CD version. He is not always open to things such as this however within the first few moments of listening to it, he could tell that if we BOTH knew this information- our relationship could be amazing. It truly made a difference from the first day he started listening, I would highly recommend this to EVERYONE- no matter where your relationship is at. It certainly can only help an improve<br /> [[ASIN:0802473156 The 5 Love Languages: The Secret to Love That Lasts]]<br /><br />.
B007L3BMGA|1.0|I didn't like this book at all.  The review certainly didn't give one at all the type of book it was.  It was kinky, and not the sort of book I enjoy reading.  Consequently I have not finished it.
0345803493|1.0|BOYCOTT 50 Shades of Gray Books and Movie!<br />Hollywood has been pushing this stupid, sick book, which is becoming a movie now starring gay Matt Bomer - 50 Shades of Gray. This books is more descriptive of the type of sex gays are into and should be banned from teen reading. What's it about?<br /><br />Paper-thin characters spouting middle-school dialogue during mechanistic scenes of sex, bondage, sex, punishment, sex, spankings and yet more sex in a \\"playroom of pain.\\"
0312305060|5.0|This is one of the most beautifully written books these eyes have ever read. Every sentence is a masterpiece and what it must say about women simply must be heard. Loved this book so much (and the film is wonderful to boot).
B007LNJ3YS|5.0|First off the vinyls are cut at 45rpm so you might have to make a few calibrations to your player.  The outer sleeve has a textured feel with each individual dot embossed.  It is oversized so if you're planning on putting a protective sleeve, expect a pretty tight fit.  The inner sleeves has an inner sleeve that holds the records so you can imagine the two vinyls are pretty tight when tucked away.  As far as the album, this is by far my favorite of the four.  More dynamic than the others and listening to it on vinyl has much more depth than the digi version.  My only peeve is that the clarity of the vinyls seem to bring out the syntheticism of the recorded drum machine tracks more than the digi.  I guess I'm just being foolish.  Great all around package!  Highly recommended!  I'm gonna buy another one just to have in my collection!
1596912863|5.0|Austenland<br />By Shannon Hale<br /><br />Jane is unlucky in love to say the least, after one failed relationship aft6er another she soon becomes obsessed with Mr. Darcy. When he great aunt passes away Jane receives an unexpected gift, the vacation of her dreams to Pembrook Park where she will be immersed in regency England. Jane decides to take the gift and purge her system of all of her Mr. Darcy fantasies hoping in doing so she will be able to finally move on and find a lasting love. What she doesn't realize is the man of her dreams may not be Mr. Darcy but the love they share will be just as strong.<br /><br />This was such a cute novel Shannon Hale did a wonderful job in recreating an Austen-esque setting with the right blend of modern influences. The ending was my absolute favorite as Jane is turned on her head with an unexpected revelation that is sure to leave you giggling. If you are a fan of Jane Austen and have also found yourself swooning at Colin Firth as Mr. Darcy then you will surely appreciate this book, if not then you may enjoy the witty dialog and the personal growth the character traverses. This is an absolutely wonderful contemporary romance novel.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|101 in games is fun,challenging, and confusing. Its really fun if you know how to do it but it is also very hard if you don't no what to do

B004ZRV3AU|3.0|This product is a very simple jig to cut bottles.  The jig itself seems fine.  But, the process of turning a bottle into a usable item takes some practice and luck.  Using the jig to etch the bottle is easy, the rest will take come time to learn.
B006FTC6ZC|5.0|Really fun movie. Honestly very glad that I stumbled onto this. I laughed out loud many times, the acting was good, characters were entertaining, and there was a pretty engaging story line.<br /><br />Thanks to the director, cast and crew for putting together something worth watching again with friends.
B0083GQ2A0|2.0|If you feel like being bored and depressed watch this movie. No action, no real story or plot, no happy ending. Basically just a bunch of guys freezing to death and being terrorized by wolves.
B005LAIHQS|5.0|I loved the movie; however, the packaging with the ultraviolet digital copy is not what I will tolerate. I've been through that frustration so much with the new films. Personally, I look forward to downloading only the digital copy on I-Tunes.<br /><br />The decision means I play it on my Apple TV setup. The film is in my library, where I have easy access and where I can add it to my I-pad or I-pod. And if in the next while something happens to erase the film from my library, I can download it again from I-Tunes from the home site, where you can put it back into your library without a charge.<br /><br />I won't be buying the packaging. Why do that? I don't need another film to stick on a shelf.<br /><br />But I will buy this film. It's why I gave it five stars. Although I liked all three equally well, the first and third are my favorites. I love the way the writers and producers and director tied things together.<br /><br />What more can I say about the cast? It is an incredible movie.<br /><br />But like I said, I'm tired of the Ultra Violet mumbo jumbo. I'm tech savy, but that option is a rip off--no way around feeling that way.
B000ICZD5M|1.0|Before I rented Dune it said I was able to download the video to watch on a wifi disabled device. I rented this way because  I wanted to watch it while on a plane. Now it seems I can't unless I have an ipad or kindle fire.<br />Yet another example of why iTunes video rentals far surpasses amazon.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|my 8yr old grandson have a lot of fun playing this game. The animals are so cute and fun to take care of. The missions are fun and age appropriate.  Lifesaver on a car trip.
B008B3H4VQ|5.0|totally worth the wait! Linkin Park continues to evolve their sound...they've come a long way from the angry smash punk of Hybrid Theory. This is more fluid, more hypnotic and subtle. And only one spoken track! Whether that's a pro or a con, it's up to the listener. The lyrics still make you want to claw your eyes out in despair (in the best way possible, i mean). The wordless tracks are nothing short of beautiful (Tinfoil is my personal fave).<br /><br />If you were a fan of their last album, then this is a must-have. Enjoy!
B003XVYLDU|5.0|Browsing because you've heard the hype? Well it may not change your life but do yourself a favour and put this on your bucket reading list......so it goes.
B006KX3GXO|5.0|best photo editer ive ever used... absolutely love this app!!!!!!!!!!!!! its rly good at fixing piks and making things stand out
B005HEEK1O|5.0|This is one of my favorite episodes because it is not just about action and strange new places. The plot is good and there is a great surprise twist at the end. It still has the typical Star Trek drama and the Captain fighting the bad guy but with a little more Perry Mason added in space.
B0013L2EDQ|4.0|This was definitely an intriguing adventure for the Sigma forces, starting with the mysterious motive behind the murder of an Egyptian curator for an even more mysterious object with links to one of the most bizarre historical mysteries we know of. The journey of Marco Polo and his father (Niccolo) and his uncle (Masseo). However, there are parts of the journey that remain a total mystery to us all. This adventure looks into what may have happened as well as a secret chapter of Marco's journey and what happened to his personal confessor, Friar Agreer.<br />There's another part to this adventure, as is standard Sigma affair- that of a bizarre and extremely disturbing outbreak. One that can turn people into cannibals, burn them from the inside out (not like combustion, but more like boils and intense, uncontrollable sunburns). So, it's one part historical thriller, one part medical thriller. One part, not one half, as there are more parts to this story, like a personal attack to Gray's parents, and Painter's search for them. Multiple stories/substories intertwining. However, there are also very sad moments, both with people you've known and liked for some time (like Monk) and people you only knew from the Prologue (Gregg Tunis). The strangest thing to happen in this book is actually what concerns Susan, Gregg's wife. But to find out what that is, you'd have to read this book. The reason for 4 stars is one of the side enemies, an emotionally-distant assassin, Surina, becomes interesting, but something she does doesn't get explained thoroughly enough for me, so I ended up getting dissappointed about that. Beside that, this was a very good adventure full of crazy twists and sarcastic, razor-sharp wit and counter-twists.<br />Now, I only have one question. For myself. When am I going to get my hands on the next one?
B00881VLCE|5.0|this is an awesome my dad has this on his ipad and he told me to get it so I got today and now I luuvv it Lol!!!&lt;3
B0087OXDDC|5.0|This ebook has some really interesting and innovative concepts.<br /><br />Regarding its contents, I think the Author tried to make something new in the subject of learning Phrasal Verbs. I've always heard that the particle/preposition of each Phrasal Verb doesn't have much relation with the meaning of the Phrasal Verb itself, but Peter Gray showed it differently and was able to establish some kind of logical meaning/connection, making them easier to learn.<br /><br />It uses a lot of hyperlinks so you can jump to a specific verb or particle/preposition, from one definition to another, from one phrasal verb to a correlate one, and so on. The reading can get a bit erratic, but not in a bad way, since this is exactly what makes an e-book different from a printed book.<br /><br />No doubt, \\"Phrasal Verb Fun\\" is a very useful tool in the hardworking task of learning Phrasal Verbs and getting proficient in spoken English. Good job Peter.
B00846F1YW|4.0|Do you know why the two games are the same it's because there both from the same company. I played the first game of Mysteryville which was really FUN!
055338466X|4.0|I'm a 16 year old who takes high school chemistry, biology and physics so you could say I have a fairly decent understanding of science but while this book introduced some new ideas, it didn't actually mentally tax me or confuse me much. I think Hawking gives a very basic and accessible explanation of big ideas but it's hardly complex, not exactly what I was looking for but a good introduction to the topic none the less.
B007SGM084|5.0|I am enjoying the book very much.. keeps you on edge always wondering what's going to happen next. Oh that Christian Grey

0545123275|4.0|I read this book on my kindle. I could not get into it until I was 40% into it. I hated it at first and contemplated changing books but I never can put down a book I started. THANK GOD... it turned out to be a great book and now I'm going to read the second book (LINGER) tonight! Recommend if you like twilight-type stuff.
1475143389|5.0|I'm not sure if it's how simply he puts the information or how much fun he makes it sound to get started with his way of doing things, but the book definitely does it for me.  I've been working with the program only 3 weeks now but I'm always looking forward to my workouts, i've noticed,so far, some sizeable gains and a noticeable drop in body fat. One more thing I can say about, not the book, but the author is that he's so nice,and willing to explain his concepts through personal emails. Other authors that I have emailed in the past to clarify something for me, have either never responded, or totally blew me off with a \\"thanks for reading my book\\", and adding no helpful response to my questions what-so-ever. It's about time I found a book that lead me to stop looking for others on this matter.<br /><br />The Shredded Chef is also an amazing book and the recipes are great.
B003P2WO5E|5.0|The Way of Kings, Brandon Sanderson's truly epic opening to a grand Fantasy series.<br /><br />I have read the Lord Of the Rings, and many other fantasy books, though I still have a great many to go through that people consider to be great (the Wheel of Time Being one of them), I consider myself to understand the Genre at least a little bit. And I thought this book was amazing. I was hesitant at first, 1000 pages? That seemed to be a HUGE amount of pages to me, but I got it from the Library and gave it a try.<br />A day later, late into the night, I finished it. I couldn't stop! He has this mastery over the truly epic, of making you feel the pure awesomeness of what's going on. And one thing that I particularly like, is his approach to war. Without giving away too much of the story, there is awful, terrible war in this story. But someone starts to realize that it isn't as glorious as it all seems to be. His characters are slowly drawn into learning grander principles of life and dealing with the problems of the world.<br />And when it comes to the world, he manages to create this giant feeling of foreboding, something BIG is going to happen, and it is slowly building speed, like a monster truck that takes it's time to get going, but is impossible to stop once it is.<br /><br />I enjoyed the characters and really felt for them and their struggles, and I liked how they weren't justifying wrongdoing (the main ones) they were learning greater ways of life and despite all opposition were doing their best to live them. Slowly but surely. This book is surely one of the greatest works of fantasy (or at least the beginning of one) and the best book I have read to date.<br /><br />Buy it, enjoy it, and read it!
B005MW8CLK|5.0|i really have dreamed about this type of package from my favorite bands for as long as i can remember and im happy to say that this gish box set does not disappoint!! its got everything i hoped for and lots i didnt expect!! all lyric,song by song commentary,'post card' photos. disc one is the remastered version of gish and it sounds incredible. disk two is tons of outtakes and unreleased and alt versions of gish era song,which are awesome!! the third disc is a dvd and a real gem as its a full on early concert by the band. this overall set is a real treat to any pumpkins fan and a must have.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!!
B005EWDAFQ|3.0|The title of my review summarizes my impression. Stealing the key ideas from Kubrick's masterpiece this book presents an array of characters that range from cardboard trivial (the Wife) to downright repulsive (the Husband and his associate the Banker). Of course the action is fast, the plot has many neat tricks and keeps you passing pages at increasing pace. But in the end there is a gloomy (and boring) message that is as new (or as interesting) as any Luddite manifesto. Definitely not the best of Mr. Harris' production.
B005LAIH4A|2.0|This was not a fun movie for my great niece(8ish) and nephews(10ish) like I thought it would be. It turned into a whole lot of hate big business and they are only run by greedy heartless idiots. I could have lived with that if the movie was enjoyable for the kids. They have watched it once(and it did not keep their attention then well) and never ask about it, from what the parents said. Save your money and try a different film, this one will collect dust on the DVD shelf.

B0064NTZKI|5.0|Been a Woody Allen fan all of my adult life -- over the years always purchasing his films, etc.  books he authored....  My recent purchase of the Woody Allen Documentary was a terrific purchase....  I love the guy and followed him for years and yet the 'documentary' provided new stuff for me ---  the purchase from Amazon was perfect --  they make it all so simple and easy - and I will continue to make purchases from Amazon ----  Totally recommend the DVD featured for all Woody fans, and there are millions --  and by all means recommend going through Amazon -

B008P1EWIM|5.0|This app is great. It does everything I need it to do. The Weather Channel app sucks with the constant ads blocking your view.
B007UXSDYU|4.0|I had heard some negative reviews of this film so I was really surprised how good it turned out to be.  The premise of a group of strangers locked in a basement trying to survive a nuclear apocalypse is an old one but this one takes on some new twists. As the days go on the members of the group who had the most vulgar or degenerate natures become more so, those who are weak become weaker and those who are level headed remain so but the question remains to what end. What's the purpose of attempting to survive the unsurvivable?  The one character smart enough to outwit the others in the game of last man standing finds out exactly what it means be the last man standing.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I bought this book because all my frends read it and loved it. Needless to say my friends are a bunch of horny housewives. I found myself onstanlty rolling my eyes at this book from the very beginning. I had a hard time relating to the main charater girl and thought the guy was a dousch. I could not get into it and want to delet it off my Kindle because I do not want anyone to think I actually read it.

0670022411|3.0|I bought the book based off the hype and general high reviews. I knew it was on the wordy side but I thought the science parts would be right up my interest. But I still found the book lacked direction and was just sort of wandering around what could have been a great story.  The vampire was somewhat interesting in how the author tied science into the normal myth. If she had of chosen to expand on that rather the characters' daily routines it might have helped. But yes the book was far to long and needs a good editor.
0312360258|5.0|For the original review and more, please visit markedbybooks.blogspot.com<br /><br />Some people are childish enough to say that vampires are overrated. And I am mature enough to say that that is not the case. The stereotypical take on vampires is what's overrated. But when you have an original and talented authors such as P.C and Kristen Cast, vampires never go out of style. And with their series, House Of Night, we can view this firsthand.<br /><br />I had the pleasure of reading Marked a few years ago and by the end of the first chapter, I was hooked. The series is about a teen, Zoey Redbird, who is Marked as a vampire when she is 16 years old and she has to uproot from everything she has ever known, and move to the scary House Of Night in Tulsa Oklahoma. Turns out, its not so scary. She meets her new best friend, Stevie Rae Johnson, as well as 3 other wise cracking teenagers that turn out to be her best friends throughout the series.<br /><br />This new take on vampires, (vampyres, as spelled in the series) is refreshing to say the least, because it doesn't involve murder and midnight excursions to hunt humans for the sake of survival. Yes, throughout the series there is murder and blood drinking, but not in the sense of Bram Stoker (Yes, I am a Dracula fan as well. I am a nerd, I admit it). The book is even written in first person through the eyes of the protagonist herself, Zoey Redbird.<br /><br />Now, like my partner, this is the first ever book review I have written so cut me some slack if it isn't as interesting as you would have liked. However! I do have experience when it comes to reading and writing so stick with me here and I will do my best to fulfill your needs. Bookwise, that is. Thanks for reading!!<br /><br />Gabby<br /><br />For the original review and more, please visit markedbybooks.blogspot.com
B007JWKLMO|5.0|I think George Harrison was the least satisfied of all the four Beatles.  This is because he was unable to get as many of his own songs published while he was still in his old band.  Plus he became more occupied with India and spirituality; not that there is anything wrong with that.<br />Along with that, George was getting very stressed out about all the money and fame that was associated with The Beatles, and that can take its toll on anyone.<br /><br />I would say that this the best biography of George Harrison so far.  I say this because while it does point out his upbringings, his positive aspects, and his accomplishments, it also points out his faults or frailties.  I admire that the film is not a hero-worshipping whitewash.<br /><br />Here are some positive aspects about George:<br />  1. He was a brilliant guitar player and songwriter both as a Beatle and as a solo artist.<br />  2. He was able to live a relatively healthy and productive life with the influence of Indian spirituality and Ravi Shankar.<br />  3. He married the right woman, Olivia, who helped defend him from that one intruder who intended to murder him back in December 30th, 1999.<br />  4. He was a great father to his son, Dhani.<br />  5. He formed the Traveling Wilburys along with Roy Orbison,(who unfortunately died of a heart attack later on), Tom Petty, Jeff Lynne, and Bob Dylan.<br />  6. He created his own film label, \\"Hand Made Films\\", along which he became the executive producer for films like \\"Monty Python's Life of Brian\\" and \\"Time Bandits\\", (which George also composed the music score.)<br />  7. When he bought his home in England, he eventually planted trees and flowers in order to create his own forest.  So that's a great way of contributing to our environment.<br />  8. In 1971, he organized \\"The Concert for Bangela Desh\\", which showed that rock 'n' roll musicians can have a good heart and provied aid for charity.<br /><br />Now here are some negative aspects about George:<br />1.  He was a constant smoker, which would make it obvious as to why he was to die of cancer at the age of fifty-eight.<br />  2.  Like many other rock 'n' roll musicians, he was a drug user.<br />  3.  Eric Clapton recalls talking with George about wife-swapping his first wife Patty Boyd, as if she wasn't worth that much to him.<br />  4.  Terry Gilliam tells the interviewers that when George bought a house in Switzerland, he would refuse to pay his property taxes, even when he was slowly dying of cancer.<br /><br />Martin Scorsese and the film crew also do a thorough job with interviewing celebrities such Sir Paul McCartney, Ringo Starr, the late Billy Preston, Yoko Ono, Sir George Martin, as well as interviewing some of his family members like his wife, Olivia, and his son, Dhani.  All of the people interviewed would tell you their opinion on George, whether it is good or bad.<br />Another thing that I learned about George Harrison, while seeing this film was that while he was always referred to as the \\"quiet Beatle\\", he would always give his close friends or aquaintences his opinion about a certain subject, whether it was politically correct or not.  Therefore this \\"quiet Beatle\\" was not so quiet after all.<br /><br />\\"George Harrison:  Living in the Material World\\"  shows you that while he had his talents, good-heartedness and strong points, he also had his drawbacks and weak points.  This is just a reminder that celcbrities are still human, and every human has both a good side and and evil side.<br />Hopefully, in the afterlife, (to those who are belivers), I'll be able to establish a friendship with George Harrison.  But in the meantime, I'll have to settle with meeting people like him.

B003JH8LPW|2.0|Dan Brown takes really good subject matter and draws it out a little too long.  I was exhausted by the time he wrapped up the mystery.  Dan we need a few breakthrough events to keep us engaged.
B000P0J0A6|5.0|super great.  this is a 1 disk set.  this may scare some young kids.  the rules are never get them wet, never feed them after a certain time.  just to let you know this a Christmas movie if you did not know.
B0084IG7KC|1.0|Starving people who don't eat, magically transforming dirt into rabid dogs... is this a Tim Burton movie, oh, it's not. Does it appear to be a remake of a half dozen different Wrestling/MTV productions spanning back a few decades?  Absolutely.<br /><br />I wondered what all the fuss was about.  It was about a bunch of book geeks getting their book turned into a movie.  I think this movie falls into the same phenomenon as the Twilight series (whatever all that is really about).<br /><br />What's funny is a movie like Battleship gets such a horrible rating, but people are trying to call this a movie of the year?  It's hilarious.  I liked the actors, their acting was exceptional at times, the story was timid and very horribly written screenplay felt too overproduced.  It fell short on believability, things were just weirdly random and seemed to have very little reason other than to be part of the visual experience. The pacing was pretty decent for most of it.<br /><br />I'm very generous when it comes to movies.  I tend to go in having no expectations and come out at least somewhat pleased.  I went in without any expectations and came out displeased.  I was wondering what the point to even having the movie was.  Oh, to celebrate a book that's probably popular for good reason.<br /><br />Maybe there needs to be a 3 or 4 hour directors cut.  I don't know.  What I saw on the big screen can stay there.  It was too shallow and cliche' for my tastes.  I have a hard time even calling this science fiction. It's more like a fantasy movie without much of a fantasy.
B000067FP8|5.0|this movie may be to scary for some young kids.  in this movie there is gremlin that can talk.  if you have never seen this before then get it and see it.  better then the first.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This trilogy was intriguing and made me want to keep on reading! I hope there are many more books to come by this author

B000OVLINI|5.0|The author really has a way with words.  This is my second read .  First time was hard cover a few years ago.  Wonderful story, wonderful, dry wit.
B0060MYM3S|5.0|I must say that I agree that Season 2 greatly deviates from the book \\"A Clash of Kings\\".  However, each can be appreciated in their own right.  I was greatly disappointed in how Arya is portrayed in the series.  She shows more initiative and guile in the book; I found her a little annoying in the series.  One of my favorite characters is Tyrion, played to perfection by Peter Dinklage and the other Jon Snow.  His (Snow) characteristics, I like are that he is strong and silent (meaning that he pay attention to what is happening and reserves judgement) with a sense of right and wrong.  I actually enjoyed the series so much that at the end of season 2 I had to buy all the books available in Jamaica on the  \\"A Song of Ice and Fire\\", as I could not wait to find out what happens in season 3. Though with all the changes, I am glad that I started with book 1 and not book 3 as I would probably be perplexed.  I am half way into book 2 and the book version is better in most ways than the series, however the battle for King's Landing in the series was excellent.  I prefer Shae's character in the series to the book.  All the actors were excellent.  Really a stellar cast.  HBO, keep up the good work.  Don't change Tryion's character at all.
B0053TMP24|5.0|This book ties together two worlds for mythology. The Roman Gods and the Greek Gods. It was action packed from the beginning and never gave way the ending. This was an excellent book worthy of any audience.
B004CYKZZA|5.0|After breaking my third wired headset, I decided to go wireless. I stumbled upon these by coincidence. I gave it a try and I am really happy with it.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- The battery last from 4-8 hrs and if it dies just plug it in and keep using it.<br />- It is wireless and has a good range about 6 m with a lot of walls in between.<br />- It has a power save feature. A long time without being used and it sets itself to sleep.<br />- Good sound output and sound capture quality.<br /><br />Cons:<br />- The right ear cushion makes a \\"clacketing\\" sound every time I move my head, but I am the only one who hears it so I might be going crazy :)<br />- The power button looks kind of flimsy, but it won't break that easily.<br /><br />I highly recommend this for anyone on a budget, and, like me, needs to get a wireless headset.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This book was chosen for our book club and everyone thoroughly enjoyed it.  It was a page turner and kept you guessing.  Well written!!
B002DOSBMK|5.0|Literally one of the best books i have ever read.  It provides the perfect escape from daily life with a world that is completely foreign, and thrilling.  I cannot recommend this more, with only one warning - there are probably close to a dozen books in this entire series, and once you read one - you have to read them all.
B0058YPG1G|5.0|The fourth season of the groundbreaking and critically acclaimed series, Breaking Bad opens with an episode that contains a shockingly gruesome act of violence (don't worry, no spoilers here) and concludes with an episode that features another shocking scene--perhaps the most jaw-droppingly violent in the show's four season run.  The two episodes serve as bookends to what is the most suspenseful, unsettling and violent batch of episodes yet. In fact, season four just may be the best yet which is going to place a lot of pressure on creator Vince Gilligan to bring things to a fitting conclusion with the upcoming fifth and final season.<br /><br />Anyone who has followed the series this far knows that there is no turning back now, not for the audience or for Walter White who has reached a point of no return.  When Breaking Bad debuted back in 2008, Walt was a flawed but sympathetic antihero.  Stricken with cancer, he opted to use his impressive knowledge of chemistry to cook and sell Crystal Meth in order to make quick money and leave a nest egg behind for his family.  But instead Walt has become an addict himself.  Not to the drug the manufactures and peddles, but to the endless cash flow it provides and to the sense of power that goes along with being a drug kingpin.  Season four finds Walt's transformation from mild mannered chemistry teacher and self loathing door matt to a black hearted villian nearly complete.  When he snarls at Skyler that, \\"I am the danger!\\" it's clear that there is no hope of redemption for him.  Perhaps most disturbing is that he doesn't appear to be too concerned with that.  You almost get the sense that he has become the man that he has always wanted to be.<br /><br />Cranston's performance is, as usual, superb and another Emmy win will likely be coming his way.  But every player in the ensemble is excellent as well.  Aaron Paul continues to bring new dimensions to Jesse who spends a large chunk of this season trying to come to terms with his murder of Gail at the end of Season three.  Anna Gunn portryas Skyler as a woman who is frightened yet resourceful and Dean Nooris as Walt's DEA angent brother-in-law continues to flesh out his character while positioning him to become a major foe for Walt in the show's final season.  And then there's Gus.  Portrayed brilliantly by Giancarlo Esposito, he provides much of the sense of dread that runs throught season four.  It is absolutely fascinating to watch the cat and mouse game that plays out between he and Walter.  There is only room for one of these two in the meth business and season four barrels toward that inevitable conclusion like a freight train.<br /><br />How this will all end is anyone's guess but it sems more than likely that it won't be good.  Walt is in too deep and seems to have lost his soul quite a while ago.  The ultimate question may turn out not to be if Walter White will die, but rather will he rediscover his own humanity before that time comes.  That, more than anything else is what has driven this brilliant series from the very beginning.is murder of Gail at the end of Season three.

034580404X|4.0|Loved the first two books - thought third book greatly lacked a lot and was not written as well as the first two - rushed the entire book and too confusing with flash back writing being used.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|It never downloaded to my kindle I still only have the sample?<br />Please download it<br />Bill<br />The sample reading was excellent
0345803493|5.0|I absolutely LOVED book 2 just as much as book one. The romance that sparks between the character draws you in so deep. I can't help but feel sorrow for the past and passion for their future. I have enjoyed the series so far as a 25 year old new married gal...and my husband has as well.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|i cannot believe the hype on this book..i regret purchasing it..it is terrible in every way..the writing..the plot..all of it
B0079J28NW|4.0|I'm a Beatles fan as I grew up in the 60s.  I fondly remember seeing this animation on the TV and maybe my recollections of it have been colored through the lens of time.  But the Blu-ray version of Yellow Sub brings it back into sharp focus.  Excellent transfer, great audio (DTS), and all those fantastic songs!  (But did you know the voices of the Beatles in the animation are done by actors?  I didn't until now!)<br /><br />Attractive packaging and colorful booklet insert top it all off nicely.  Travel back in time with this video and remember what was going on in your life when you first saw it.  If you've never seen it, enjoy some 60s vintage light psychedelia and great music!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I read all of the \\"50 shades \\" books. Yes there is a lot of sex. At first its okay but after recycling the sane orgasm I began to get bored.  Maybe calling things by different names would of helped.  I did enjoy the storyline. I was also swept up in the character 'Grey ' from a sad child abused and hurt -to a rich successful man. Strong and controlled<br />until meeting Ana '. I don't really like romance in books but this book was different from any romance novel I've ever read. I truly enjoyed it
B0067Q42BY|5.0|I enjoy mahjong and cards as the occasional  past time. this version is pleasant and includes a storyline...pretty sure I got it during a special but I would pay 4.99 after using it. just worried about addiction.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|There are a tiny smattering of one star reviews that claim the Wool series to be boring, and I cannot help but wonder if they are used to science fiction in general. For this series is not one of those fantasy novels that gets lumped in with the genre, but actual science fiction. With some minor exceptions everything in the books is now only possible, but plausible as well.<br /><br />Character development and back story may also be an issue for some people. The \\"real\\" story doesn't develop properly until book three. But please don't take that to mean that the first two books are without point. Without them you cannot understand life in the Silo or why the characters do what they do. Books one and two are fine stories in their own right and provide the impetus for the next three books.<br /><br />The world in the Wool series is a bit like Asimov's Foundation series (Nowhere near as dry in it's writing though.) turned upside down. There are no robots, technology isn't as advanced, and unlike Asimov's domes one cannot leave the Silo. It is a tragic tale, but with an ending that gives you hope for the residents of the world Howey has created.<br /><br />If you like plausible science fiction with a strong human element this book is for you. If you enjoy post-apocalyptic (Gamers, replace Silo with Vault.) stories, then this book is for you. If you find character development and back story boring... Go read Twilight or something.
B007I2BZIE|2.0|Rush is my favorite group.  I have been a fan for over 30 years.  Though I liked their last two albums and loved Vapor Trials, I do not like Clockwork Angels.  If I would have listened to it before I bought it I would not have bought it.  They are still great in concert, but I would not recomend this album.  I could hardly listen to the whole album, and I probably will not listen to it again.  I do not know what album those who gave this album 5 stars was listening to.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this game is really fun and easy to play it fits all ages and everybody should have a chance to play it.
0345803485|1.0|I cannot say enough about how wrong this trilogy is.  It sets women, feminism, men, kinky sex, vanilla sex, reading, mothers, daughters, grandmothers, and the human race back fifty years.  What was random house thinking?  I've read a lot, all genres, fiction and nonfiction, including online fiction.  Of all the fanfiction out there, and yes I've read a lot, how this got singled out will remain a mystery to me.<br /><br />Why did I read the entire series?  The same reason one can't look away from a car wreck.  How can I not regret the money spent?  The fact that I have gone back to fanfiction.net and read the parodies; I've read the blogs from authors and columnists and satirists and its made me smile.
0439023521|4.0|Let me start off by telling a little about myself.  I am a 45 year old male who is not an avid reader.  I read a lot in support of my profession, but it is definitely work reading and not reading for pleasure.  I guess I read so much at work, the last thing I want to do outside of work is read.  However, I do read for pleasure periodically.  When I do, I am very selective.  I prefer fantasy and sci-fi.  If you read some of my other reviews, you will see that I also enjoy role playing video games.  I like to escape in my entertainment. As with the games I enjoy, with books I prefer authors who can build a world and suck me into it.  I prefer complex stories with exquisite detail woven in a creative way such that it compels me to continue reading for hours at a time. I consider Tolkien to be the master in this regard; the one author who writes perfectly for me.  This is my first book review on Amazon.<br /><br />That said, I had no intention of reading this book; none whatsoever until I saw the movie on an international flight recently.  I was intrigued by the movie, and thought there was a lot that felt \\"missing\\" that the book would most certainly clear up. I asked my oldest if she had the book...she did...I borrowed it.  When I asked her what she thought about it, she said it was good.  When she doesn't add a bunch of details, I know that she only thought the book was OK...not something she'd read twice (and she reads almost everything more than once). I asked if she had the other two books...\\"no\\"...another indicator she was not excited about The Hunger Games.<br /><br />The story is very good.  It is fairly simple, given the audience, but I think it may be too simple.  For example, Harry Potter was geared towards a slightly younger audience, and I feel that it is a tad more sophisticated in style and content than The Hunger Games.  There are a lot of fragments.  I mean a lot.  If you are the slightest bit OCD about grammar you will not like this book.  I've also run into several copy-edit errors as well (I have the paperback edition with the movie tie-in cover), of course that is not Collins' fault.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I think the author leaves too much to the reader to figure for themselves.  There is a fine balance when building a world and a story, and that balance is easily skewed, and I would expect an experience author such as Collins to have a better grasp on the process.  A friend of mine rationalized it to me that we are actually reading the story from Katniss' perspective, and thus the reader is only getting what she sees and understands.  This is a fair review, and one that certainly makes sense given the way the story unfolds.<br /><br />I still think that the story is a good one.  I thoroughly enjoyed it, and have ordered the next two books in the series.  I am betting most people will really like this book.  It is an easy read, despite the herky-jerky fragments, and it really does pull you in.  Like Stephen King said in his review \\"Addictive...I could not stop reading.\\"  You will find yourself rooting for Katniss, I promise.
B0012BX062|5.0|Like many have posted, \\"Ready to Die\\", his debut, was a stunning, cinematic album of greatness. The difference is that I don't identify as a hip hop fan, almost the contrary. \\"Ready to Die\\" was just a great album. So how does one follow-up the album you had near a lifetime to craft, compared to 3 years for its follow-up/sequel. But succeed he does.<br /><br />Bringing home an advance copy the weekend before release, I sat center stage and began the listening journey. By \\"F'u tonight\\", brilliance began to take hold. Lacking some of the theatrical feel of \\"Ready to Die\\", \\"Life After Death\\" is brimming with great beats and lyrics.<br /><br />I played this and \\"Me Against te World\\" back to back and cried like an infant at the lost of two great talents.<br /><br />Standouts include the aforementioned \\"F U Tonight\\", the hip hop classic \\"Last Day\\", the crossover smash \\"I Love the Dough\\", the Diana Ross sampled #1 pop, R&B and dance \\"Mo Money, Mo Problems\\", the impressive speed rap of \\"Notorious Thugs\\", another #1 Diana Ross sampled \\"Miss U\\", the iconic \\"Back to Cali\\" and the comedic \\"Another\\".<br /><br />Who would have thought that dipping into the Diana Ross catalog of crossover smashes would give Biggie, the kind of crossover appeal, Bad Boy sought after. But Puffy had already dug into other Diana classics like \\"Upside Down\\" for Lil Kim and even the lush, adult contemporary beauty of \\"Theme from 'Mahogany'\\". So it is no surprise that this album sat on top of the album chart for multiple weeks.
0817439390|5.0|--PREFACE--<br /><br />THIS BOOK IS FOR BEGINNERS AND THOSE WHO NEED HELP UNDERSTANDING THE EXPOSURE TRIANGLE (aperture, shutter speed, and ISO).  I cannot stress the previous statement enough because I have read many of the reviews of this book including the negative ones (the one and two star reviews seemed as if they were written by people with more experience than a beginner.  For example one of them states that the author's opinion of depth field is wrong, which I'm not sure many beginners would know enough about photography to make such a statement.)  If you are a beginner, and you have absolutely no clue on how to manually adjust your camera's settings so that you can consistently capture a \\"correct exposure,\\" you need to buy this book!<br /><br />I also must stress that this book is not about creating beautiful compositions or how to post-process photographs.  It is simply a beginners book to understanding how to correctly expose your images.  The author, Bryan Peterson, gives you the tools you need to take correctly exposed photographs (he even gives some tips on choosing the \\"creatively correct exposure\\" out of the many exposure options for a given shot).  However, he leaves the composition of the photo up to you, the photographer, which in my mind is the way it should be.  From the many professionals, amateurs, and seasoned hobbyists that I have spoken to, you will gradually develop an eye for photography as you become more experienced, which doesn't sound like something that you can learn from a book in my opinion.  If you were looking for a complete guide to becoming a photographer, this book is not it; however, I strongly recommend it as a tool to help you get there.<br /><br />--REVIEW--<br /><br />I've been easing myself into the world of photography for a little over a year now, and I have purchased multiple books about photography, but none of them have covered the subject of exposure in the simple and understandable way Bryan does.<br /><br />Mostbooks I have read speak about the exposure triangle and how each element has an impact on the exposure, but I can honestly say that I was still guessing after reading those books, and when I was out shooting, I still relied heavily on my camera presets.  I wanted to make the jump to the manual setting, but I just didn't understand enough about it, and being a hobbyist, I just didn't have the time to try to figure it out myself through trial and error.<br /><br />However, Bryan explains exposure in such a simple and understandable way that after reading the first section of the book (which only takes about 15-20 min), I understood enough to be able to shoot in manual mode, which was extremely exciting to me.  After almost a year of struggling, I understood enough about exposure to shoot the way I wanted to in only 15 min.  I was so excited at this point, I almost put the book down to go out and shoot more photos, but I didn't, which was a positive because after the short introduction, he goes into more detail on what he calls \\"creative exposures,\\" aperture, depth of field, and much more throughout the book.<br /><br />I only received this book yesterday, so I'm only to page 83, but I plan on updating my review after finishing.<br /><br />ONCE AGAIN, IF YOU ARE A BEGINNER, AND YOU ARE STRUGGLING TO UNDERSTAND YOUR CAMERA'S SETTINGS, BUY THIS BOOK.  IF YOU ARE TRUELY A BEGINNER, YOU WILL NOT REGRET YOUR PURCHASE!
B001KQEE0U|5.0|By one of the greatest albums of all time, forget in hip hop, &quot;Me Against the World&quot;, I declared proudly that I was a big Tupac fan. Like &quot;Life After Death&quot; for Biggie, I just couldn't forsee how Tupac would top that masterpiece.<br /><br />With 3 solid #1 singles in a row, &quot;California Love&quot;, &quot;How Do U Want It&quot; and &quot;I Ain't Mad Atcha&quot;, Tupac was in another zone entirely. Astoundingly prolific, Tupac aka Makaveli aka The Master, began pumping out amazing material that would leave a legacy of over 75 million albums and counting.<br /><br />I honestly never gave &quot;All Eyez on Me&quot; the time it demanded and deserved. Now owning the CD and the incredible excellent promotional cost of the Mp3s, I will finally give it it's due.<br /><br />I'm going to defer to fans reviews of certain tracks to pay attention to and then write an addendum to this review. But I already know that it was great........now is about the time for intimacy.
B000FC1AGG|5.0|a little more grounded in reality than \\"Shopaholic\\", but still in a funny world where things work out well for the most part. Extremely funny premise about the stupid little things we lie to the people closest to us about. Even though my things are not the same as Emma's, I have some so I can relate. I laughed a lot and read through the whole thing in three days...will definitely keep it on the kindle in case of tough times. A true pleasure. Thanks, Sophie Kinsella.

1936608898|5.0|I've read a lot of heath and fitness books. I've also read many credible scientific studies. I've never found a book that satisfies both parts of my desired reading: the practical application to athletes/real people AND the scientific backing. This book does it in a well written manner. I was always skeptical of restriction type diets/fad diets but this is a life changing book that you don't even realize until you start the challenge and see for yourself. Any skeptics out there, just try it (its ONLY 30 days) and you'll be amazed at the results. I was also concerned about the \\"life after Whole30\\" but that part of the book is also well written and logical.<br /><br />Fabulous book, I recommend to everyone!
0812993292|5.0|Who would think that taking a 500-mile walk would bring all one's emotions to a head and invite self-reflection as well as regret?<br /><br />Harold Fry never knew that a letter from an old friend would elicit so many emotions, and he never would have thought he would do what he was doing or how he was doing the 500-mile walk to his friend Queenie who was dying of cancer.<br /><br />As you are reading about Harold's walking and his promise, you are probably asking yourself this question as I did: Why in the world is he continuing on this journey when it is becoming impossible to walk and to fulfill his promise.  I would have accepted any ride that was offered. :) Harold did meet a number of interesting people, though, and his wife who was left at home was making friendships and regretting that she and Harold had never had a deep relationship.<br /><br />The adjective, MARVELOUS, on the ARC's book cover undeniably describes this book.  Additional adjectives such as SPECTACULAR and SPLENDID would also be revealing terms. The author made this mundane topic of a 500-mile walk to see a friend not mundane at all.  Ms. Joyce had beautiful descriptions of landscapes, feelings, conversations, and thoughts about friendship and family.  She drew you right into the book from page one.<br /><br />You will find that this read is very profound and thought-provoking. Nothing but praise for this remarkable book....the characters and the storyline are exceptional.<br /><br />The book is also a tribute to the decency of the human race for their concern and their support of a cause a fellow human being believed in.  This book is also an inspiring emotional ride...have tissues handy and be prepared to be thinking about your own life....the regrets as well as the pleasures.  5/5<br /><br />I received this book from the publisher in exchange for an honest review.
B004K8WPUQ|5.0|I have a Canon 60D and let me tell you it is a GREAT camera...but its built in mic sucks...plain and simple. I bought this after listening to many different mic off of youtube. This one is great because it gives the sounds some beef...and by beef i mean bass. Most of the other mics like the Sennheiser one sound to \\"tinny\\". The build quality is good but not great...meaning dont just shove this in your bag. The battery is a little hard to change and kinda scares you because you think you might break the mic. The mic is cool in that it has a 20dcb boost switch which if you turn the gain way down in you dslr creates great quality recordings. Now I know that alot of you are here because you want a mic for your dslr but make sure you want a shot gun mic because Rode also sells a stereo mic for dslrs which may better suit your needs. Over all this is a great mic and you cant beat the free 20year warranty it comes with...20 years.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|this is a great app with lot of nice additions abreaaly like the battery bar and that you can change its color
B004XANKVO|5.0|It looks sexy. It has a hard case for glasses or phones. It has room for you laptop and ipad. It can change sizes with the adjustable straps meaning that it can look like a sleek laptop bag or a bulky school bag. It is water resistant so your stuff stays safe when it rains. It has cool zippers. It is padded like crazy. It is great for techies and students. It has the sexy Thule logo. Is it worth it? YES.
B007Z9RAX4|5.0|Great movie. Would recommend it to everyone to see. If you love action this is the movie for you to see.
B0063IH60K|5.0|it is fun because you can change your background and it is free but it isn't for every one but fun for adults.
030758836X|3.0|Started out at 3 stars, then 3.5, then 4, then 3.5, then back to 3. Decent writing, good detail, but a completely ridiculous ending, even for fiction. Which is why I read so little of it.<br /><br />Of course, I just came off of Unbroken on audiobook, so nothing can compare. Still. Meh.
B005KJJ4F8|5.0|Purrrrrfect!!!!<br />love how it was created...get too the point. stir it up and pour it out, on a plate!<br />WHEN IS THE NEXT BOOK SO I CAN PRE-ORDER!
B007BZM3HK|5.0|One of the catchiest songs EVER and fun. Enjoy driving and singing to it. It makes mowing the lawn fun.
B002OSXDAU|4.0|It is a great novel/history of architects and architecture, and the free spirit that should flow from both.<br />It enhances values like : honesty, integregrity, and personal professional convictions.<br />I read it 50 years ago, and I am doing it again for the third or fourth time again.<br />I enjoy it, as well as the way Ayn Rand writes.
B0051UP5NQ|3.0|I was almost impressed with this app.  It had everything I needed except spell checker<br />which is a must have.  Last week I tried to open a doc from my USB (which this is the only app that supports usb) and it said Error.  I tried to open the file from my tablet storage and it said File Corrupt.  I uninstalled Office Suite and reinstalled it and the same thing.  Please fix this and add a spell checker !!!!!
B002VHI8FE|3.0|I think maybe I'm not the target audience for this kind of fantasy.<br /><br />There's a lot in this book to like.  Wonderfully flawed characters, plenty of dark humor, interesting goings-on.  The main problem I had, though, and the reason it took me 4 months to finish, was that there was nothing tying the plot together.  Most of the book, I had no idea where it was going, or who to root for, or why any of it mattered. Having finished, I still couldn't tell you what it was really about.<br /><br />My other criticism is the distinct lack of women.  Only a single female point-of-view character out of seven, and she not only the least of them, but, frankly, my least favorite.  She eventually meets up with the other characters, but I have no idea why she's part of the story, except to add the obligatory barbarian female warrior.<br /><br />I probably won't be reading any more of this series.
B005LAIIQC|5.0|Admittedly, I was not expecting much from the movie. But it did indeed give me a hell of a ride! There are some slow moments. But in the end it would put you at the edge of your seat. The plot though, is not too clear for those who have not seen the series. For those not familiar with the series just sit back and enjoy the action! When I watched the movie I felt satisfied my money was well spent. Can't hardly wait for the Blu-ray realease and work out my home theater! A worthy Bourne addition to my collection!
B007TNQ7EY|3.0|why are guys putting 7$for that game so people could buy it put it for free on amozan kindle fire
B007J4T2G8|2.0|I picked up this book to see what all the hype was about and needless to say, I am at a lost for why this book is so popular. Overall, it was a very frustrating read. The authors overuse of the phrases made the characters so static. I honestly felt that not only did Christian use sex to distract Anna, the author used it to distract the readers. There were many times where I wanted to get a better understanding of Christian and he would begin to tell Anna but...he would seduce Anna, they would have sex, and it would not be brought up again. The scene where he spoke about his first sexual experience, I was so excited because it was first moment where i felt he had some depth, but again, this went no where. I am sure the other two books probably touched on this some more, but due to my frustrations, I think I will pass
B007QWF26C|5.0|[[ASIN:B007QWF26C Blade II]]<br /><br />Year:  2002   Rating:  R   Runtime: 1 HR 57 MIN<br /><br />Aspect Ratio: 1:78.1   Video Resolution: 1080P<br />Audio: Eng 7.1 DTS-HD MA, Eng 5.1 DTS-HD MA, assorted foreign audio tracks  Subtitles: English SDH, Spanish, Portuguese, Japanese, Czech, Russian<br /><br />Director:  Guillermo del Toro<br />Writer:  David S. Goyer<br />Starring:  Wesley Snipes, Luke Gross, Kris Kristofferson, Leonor Varela, Norman Reedus, Thomas Kretschmann, and Ron Perlman<br /><br />Film: 4/5<br />Video: 4/5<br />Audio: 5/5<br />Extras: 4/5<br />Overall: 4/5<br /><br />A new form of vampire called Reapers are desolating the vampire population throughout Eastern Europe.  In a desperate attempt to stop this seemingly impossible foe the vampire nation enlists Blade to try and stop them.  He is given command of the Bloodpack, a specialized group of vampire commandos that were actually trained to kill Blade.  The Reapers put the uneasy partnership between Blade and the Bloodpack to the test as they prove to be as resilient as they are bloodthirsty with a secret agenda all their own.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B007QWF26C Blade II]] in some ways is a superior film to the original while in other ways it falls well short.  The main villain, Nomak (Luke Goss) is nowhere near as much fun or deliciously evil as Deacon Frost.  Nomak is setup as a bloodthirsty monster but by the end he's more of a tragic victim which robs the film of a certain amount of viciousness.  Where Blade II excels past its predecessor is in terms of the rest of the cast, its special effects, and direction.  Wesley Snipes and Kris Kristofferson return but it's the addition of the great Ron Pearlman that really pushes Blade II to the next level.  Also joining the cast is Norman Reedus (The Walking Dead), Matt Schulze (Fast Five), and Thomas Kretschmann (Wanted), they're not all names you'll recognize but you'll definitely know their faces.<br /><br />The believability of CGI made huge strides between the first and second Blade films.  There are still some questionable CGI in Blade II but nothing that really takes you out of the flow of the film.  Mexican director Guillermo del Toro brings an even bleaker and darker style to the franchise going as far as changing the aspect ratio from 2.35:1 to 1.85:1.  Guillermo del Toro's employs a much more fluid camera work than what was seen in the original and really tries to envelope you in the action.<br /><br />The stylistic changes made by del Toro don't always lend itself to making a great looking Blu-ray transfer.  If you watched Blade and Blade II back-to-back you might initially think that Blade has a superior transfer but you'd be wrong.  The transfer of Blade II is just as good as the one found on Blade it's just that Blade II is shot much differently than the original.  Blade II is a softer looking film than its predecessor; it's also much darker with long periods of the film taking place in gritty and murky sewers.  Does that type of environment lend itself well to HD?  Not really, but it was an intentional choice by the director and his cinematographer and this Blu-ray is a good representation of the how Blade II looked theatrically.  Colors, particularly reds pop very well, the grain is appropriate, and detail especially on close-ups is very good.  Black levels can be a little too dark at times leading to some information loss but that again has more to do with the stylistic choice of the filmmakers than the Blu-ray transfer.  I'd rather have the studio do nothing than overzealously tinker with the picture leading to too much digital manipulation.<br /><br />I thought the original Blade sounded spectacular but Blade II is even better.  The 7.1 DTS-HD MA track is easily demo material for anyone interested in giving their setup a thorough workout from head to toe.  Dialogue is firmly centered while the three front channels make slicing and dicing through the Reapers sound easy as pie (or should I say `humans'?).  If you're lucky enough to have a 7.1 setup the added surround channels don't go to waste as they all are given plenty to do while not sounding gimmicky in the process.  The LFE channel will give your downstairs neighbors reason to come knocking on your door since they'll think their ceiling is probably about to cave in.  It's a great sounding disc especially if you like listening to a rib cage break apart in graphic audio detail.<br /><br />The commentary tracks, deleted scenes, music videos, trailers, assorted featurettes, and The Blood Pact documentary are all ported over from the 2002 DVD release.  A new HD Director's Notebook and interview between Guillermo del Toro and writer David S. Goyer called Blade II: Blood Brothers is also included.  Pretty much everything you'd ever want to know about Blade II can be found here in one way or another.  Not all the material has aged well and you might get a sense of d&eacute;j&agrave; vu since some material is redundant but it's still a very decent supplement package even if most of it is showcased in SD.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B007QWF26C Blade II]], like the original Blade is still a silly karate-vampire flick but it delivers on what it advertises.  The Blu-ray presentation is strong across the board; the video might not blow you away but it is a good representation of the source material, the audio is second to none, and the special features have some new HD material added to an already informative package.

0062197258|5.0|Into The Darkest Corner is one of the most heart stopping books I have read this summer. It's filled with enough hair raising excitement and enough unexpected turns that you can't see what's going to happen next, just like it was for Cathy Bailey.<br />We follow Cathy has ritualized going the closing and locking of her doors, checking them and rechecking them, not once, not twice, but as many times as it takes for her to feel  at peace that they have been properly checked. Haynes offers a unique window into the life of a woman suffering from Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD) and how it affects life in the short and longer term.<br /><br />Initially, the dual story line threw me, but after a few chapters I caught on, as Cathy's past paralleled her current life.This witty, well written novel from author Elizabeth Haynes is an Amazon Best seller in the UK and stands to be one here as well. Her portrayal of Lee Brightman is breath-taking and horrifying, how insidiously he invades every aspect of her life and covers himself in the process.<br /><br />This story will have you on the edge of your seat much of the time while reading it and wondering about the characters, long after you finish the book. I give it five stars. It is a work of true genius.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|I read in bits and pieces, a little here, a little there, so it sometimes takes me a while to finish a book, unless I get hooked.  I didn't think that would happen with Wool, but it did.  No matter how good the plot, a book can only be as strong as its characters.  Wool made me feel as though I knew Juliette, Lukas, Bernard, Walker and Shirly. The author puts you inside each characters' head and lets you experience their inner thoughts.  You learn what drives them and why they make certain decisions.  In the end, you come to understand their complexities and what makes them tick.  I'll continue to follow Wool and look for more of this author's work.

0761169431|5.0|It's a folding frenzy in my house!!<br /><br />My two young Jedis are already pros at folding an Origami Yoda and Origami Vader, thanks to Tom Angleberger's books, The Strange Case of Origami Yoda and Darth Paper Strikes Back. In fact there is a foreward by Tom Angelberger in which refers to himself as a Padawan, and Chris Alexander as the Jedi Master of Star Wars Origami.<br /><br />As the Master will probably tell you, in order to make one of the 36 - yes, 36 - Star Wars origami figures in the book, you need to go over some of the basics.  My young Jedis thought they could skip over this training chapter and jump right into folding the Millenium Falcon.  Ten minutes later two very frustrated boys came up to me begging for my help. It takes more than the force to make a good paper light saber!<br /><br />A fun book for the whole family, there are different levels of difficulty in the book.  In the Index, there is a list of project separated by level of difficulty - starting with Han Solo, moving to Chewbacca, and eventually working toward a Naboo Starfighter.<br /><br />One thing that makes STAR WARS ORIGAMI so special - aside from the obvious Star Wars connection - is the paper.  In the back of the book, there are specially designed paper to use along with each folding project.  There are two sheets of paper to go with each project.  See the Boba Fetts up there?  If they were folded with just white paper they would still be neat, no doubt, but how cool are they with their special paper??  Awesome, right?<br /><br />Needless to say, we love this book.

B007U1FEJE|5.0|I really only have a couple of their records and I rarely listen to them but every time a Beach Boys song came on the radio as a kid, and even now, I'd be singing along to it like everyone else, singing every single word by rote and feeling the magic as if it were the very first time.  I love the Beach Boys, who doesn't right?  I didn't grow up with them from the very beginning, and although I have an incredibly eclectic taste in music, I would have to say even the most cynical person would have to agree that the Beach Boys are one of the greatest bands of all time.  And even beyond Beach Boys 'the band' they have transcended music altogether...they have become something larger than the music itself...they have become an ideal.  The Beach Boys are quintessential Red White and Blue Americana...they've been burned into the subconscious of every man, woman and child; whether race, creed, color, gender or sexual orientation.  Instantly creating mental images of white picket fences, five cent lemonade stands and beach romances that last until the end of summer when the metaphorical sun goes down.<br /><br />This album has stirred some extremely powerful emotions in me...like a collage of blissful innocence, youthful zen and melting Dairy Queen dilly bars in the sun-kissed sky...listening to the surf and watching the sun wither into the horizon of tomorrow morn to rise anew.  And although I'm typically more of a spiritual person than a religious one, I'm more than happy to say that's why God made the Beach Boys and the radio!  God bless the Beach Boys!<br /><br />Amen to that!!!

B008645YEE|1.0|I may not be a musical scholar of any sorts, but I sense plenty wrong with this soundtrack and I'll voice my issues as best I can while not savvy in musical terminology. I may do future edits when I can word my opinions better, but for now endure my rant.<br /><br />My basic thoughts on soundtracks for Nolan's Batman films.(Might write their reviews one day)<br />Batman Begins: Intriguing enough, establishes the mystery and heroism decently with a dash of mysticism that actually works swell. Weak 4 stars.<br />The Dark Knight: More obnoxious and redundant, but still some listenable highlights. Strong 2 stars.<br /><br />But this, this is last straw. Most of this is mindless raves about how it brings things to a conclusion. I don't see how, if it didn't really go much anywhere to begin with. This could deserve two-stars at best, but that's too generous.<br /><br />Nearly all of it is just copy and paste from the last two soundtracks. Repackage them with sound editing to supposedly make it a refreshing experience. What may sound 'new' on the album, is actually the same what you heard from the last films only being released now. TDK OST suffered from this, but this running out of presents so instead put more boxes in boxes to fill the void.<br /><br />It's not a matter of whether anything you'd find whether \\"Bonus\\" or \\"Unreleased\\", it's just more Zimmer dicking around saying there's more if you search harder, while there isn't. \\"No Stone Unturned\\" for example. Can't I just go back and shuffle through the last two OSTs? I can find them still the same as usual rather than buy exact replicas all over again.<br /><br />\\"Storm is Coming\\" & \\"Death by Exile\\" - Totally WORTHLESS. Just 30 of seconds effects to segue into the next track. Anyone would sooner call this a sound-bridge used in film editing than anything musical.<br /><br />\\"On Thin Ice\\" - My God, a whole third addition note is actually hinted at here for Batman's ever so meaningful two-note piece. But just faintly here, the rest is just strings and we never hear of it again.<br /><br />\\"Mind if I Cut In\\" - When he does resort to instruments other than low strings(still haven't heard a woodwind from him in eons) he applies to the lowest denominator on trigger a audience response. Piano for instance can only serve two functions for Zimmer, tragedy or wittiness, there's no middle ground the keyboard is divided by only two.<br /><br />\\"Gotham's Reckoning\\" & \\"Fire Rises\\" & 'others I can't name right off' - A one note, one trick pony. Not only does this apply to only half of Bane's character, his brutality not his intelligence, his attempt to capture the militant masses goes full circle to capture none of it's essence. There's no variation where it could apply to each unique situation, the members growing by additional groups as the movie suggested, or the next plot point when the tone changes from foreboding to consuming. It ends the same as it began. That online crowd-sourcing was just a publicity stunt for Zimmer to gain more underserving hype. 'We'll fine tune it later,' Zimmer said. No sh*t, you muted anything unique or variant. You could have just gotten a dozen man's choir chanting on repeat and you'd get the same result you have.<br />Congratulations on a such a wasted opportunity.<br /><br />\\"Underground Army\\" - Just \\"And I Thought My Jokes were Bad\\". Doesn't matter is sound-editing made a certain 'umph' to it. Why am I listening to the same theme again if these new enemies have no connections with the Joker? Answer: Serve it's basic function as foreboding music to create the 'mood' and move on.<br /><br />\\"Why Do We Fall\\" & \\"Despair\\" - Advancing character and story moments, but all significant moments are irrelevantly the same according to Zimmer. Very basic tone of uplifting, as our heroes at their supposed lows rise again. These new, harder obstacles of broken Batman rising from the pit and returning to Gotham should be whole new experience. But, no Zimmer decides biggerand louder, because up the volume and bass is easier to convey 'triumphant' than writing additional material that could convey a sense of development and advancing of character and story.<br /><br />That's why stagnant mood music or constant ostinatos STIFLES progress. The characters may grow, change, and learn but the music sure IS NOT. And subconsciously that sterilizes the joy of the film even. When all three of the film's villains were defeated each film, who they are may have represented totally different themes in the batman, but Zimmer doesn't bother to make the distinction outside of 'this cue is when bad guy gets defeated... Wallah!' It's all the same to him and his indifference.<br /><br />\\"Rise\\" - The most insulting track of all. For the climax, the final decision and ultimate sacrifice for Gotham all that Zimmer did was just copy and paste parts of \\"I'm Not a Hero\\" & \\"The Dark Knight\\" from The Dark Knight OST and \\"Barbastella\\" from Batman Begins OST. Treat every plot point no matter how PIVOTAL to the story, is just going to be the SAME! Revisit the boy soprano to reflect the deaths of Wayne family is fine, but there is a difference between having parents slaughtered by a thief and a man sacrificing his life for the whole city. And that should be revisited with a varied emotion, not just apply the 'one size fits all' tragic sad boy singing solo.<br /><br />And that's my complaint with the Nolan's Batman in terms of music: Nothing is developed, it's just on repeat. Nothing grows, just tweaked a bit or made louder. Story and character cannot grow in an abyss, but Zimmer sure is reluctant to never have a solitary musical identity advance outside his fixed ostinato that would remain attached for a whole trilogy. I could go into greater detail how Star Wars Episodes 3 and 6 and LOTR: Return of the King trump anything Zimmer attempted but I'll just exhaust myself in this rant.<br /><br />He's not focused on a fully fledged human identity at all here. Just focusing on minimalistic motifs for a couple characters, and copies and pastes filler everywhere else to create moods to serve the scene to the lowest denominator.<br /><br />Well, I don't see costume or set designers stick to one color to create a 'mood', they'd be called lazy for not giving the material the attention to detail it deserves. Actors playing one-note performances serving solely to generate knee-jerk reactions would be criticized for not deserving an acting career. Imagine if he did mountain climbing disaster flick, he'll just sound edit an avalanche or gusts to make the 'mood'.<br /><br />This year we've been treated with three superhero films with varying soundtracks. \\"The Avengers\\" was average but served it's audience with bravado that heroes deserve. \\"Amazing Spiderman\\" was flawed, but accomplished duality of outrageous heroism and fragile humanity far better than Zimmer did with his hazy sound-scape you can't distinguish Batman or Bruce Wayne from it.<br />Even \\"Wrath of the Titans\\" that fell under the influence of Zimmer's suggested techniques is a joy to listen despite being a chaotic mess.
030758836X|4.0|I actually really enjoyed this book until the end and then I started looking through the book to make sure I hadnt lost some pages.  The ending was a huge disappointment.  Nick, the husband, after starting to redeem himself as a character, just gives up and the wife essentially wins her sociopathic game.  I found the twists very entertaining.  Nick nor Amy were very redeeming characters and even in the beginning I didnt like them very much but I found myself reading the last 200 pages quickly hoping that Amy would get her due in the end only to be sorely disappointed.  The writing was not brilliant but unfortunately it seems harder to come by truly literary writing these days as if the publishers think we have all gotten stupider on masse and cannot understand more sophisticated writing (though possibly true to some extent).  I do like a good mystery/crime novel occasionally so it was a good summer read and I dont regret reading it.  I just wish that Nick would have found one thing that Amy had missed and put her away for good!

B000VZJNYS|5.0|This is one awesome album. Creatures of the Night started them on the road to recovery and steadily got better and better. I was at their concerts every tour from Dynasty through Revenge. If anybody is old enough to have lived through the Dynasty and Unmasked years,even The Elder is not that bad, it should be appreciated that they got themselves back on track. Because they sure were off track there. Heaven's on Fire is great and remains one of my favorites on this one. The whole album makes me smile listening to it, still to this day. I highly recommend it to anyone who does not know a whole lot about them.
0345803485|5.0|I just loved the story line of this series. Although I couldn't put it down, it could have been written a little better. There was a lot of repetitiveness, and some awkward sections. Overall, I really enjoyed it though. It was Twilight meets Pretty Woman meets erotica. The ultimate fairy tale (with a little spanking, of course)! Great book!

B0088WFZQG|4.0|This movie unexpectedly had an exceptional story line and sequence of scenes. It was well paced and balance between action and dialogue. Amateur acting thru no fault of the active duty actors naturally took away this movies fifth star.  I would like to see another movie with this same approach this time with smoothing the rough edges.  Awesome movie!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Youversion is the best Bible application by far. For one it is free to any and all who want to bring the Word with them where ever you go! The second is that it offers numerous versions for whatever you're comfortable with. Third is the ability to be interactive with it by making notes, reading other's notes, message notations, and devotions.

B0089IGUP4|5.0|Another excellent CD from The Gaslight Anthem!  This one has all the power and energy of their earlier work, and expands on their growing musicianship.  Every song is good.  The first two songs, \\"45\\" and \\"Handwritten\\" are excellent.  If you're a fan, pick this one up ASAP. If you don't know them, pick this one up and you'll soon be looking for all their music.  Outstanding!
0345803485|4.0|I really enjoyed this book. The writing was awful, but I found the story line to be very interesting. Yes, it's a sex filled raunchy book, but I thought there was a strong underlining theme that promoted women empowerment. The nature of the main characters' relationship, I thought was accurate and how the woman reacted showed great ability to care for herself as well as address some very real and abusive situations. However, I recommend stopping at the first book. In the 2nd one she turns into a helpless heroine unable to see her own worth.
B007I2BZIE|4.0|I have to admit it.  I didn't care for it much at all - and I am a pretty big Rush geek.  But I kept listening and found that it has grown on me.  I still think Geddy's singing is a bit stretched at times, and I would have enjoyed more solos from Alex.  But overall its a very, very solid concept album and I am very glad they went this route on this album.  Great story, great music, and a nice change of pace.<br /><br />Great work guys!
B008OOYALE|5.0|wow the people who make all these games are like tottaly amazing I love all of this games I have everyone keep making story games there like my fav.!!!! so get this game it tottaly like rocks!!!!!! :)
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I flew through book one.  Halfway through the first book I was sad to think there were only three books in the series. I wasn't looking for a Pulitzer Prize winning book just a guilty pleasure! Can't wait for the movie!
B008IJT0CE|5.0|I purchased this app because I enjoyed the free version and wanted to support development. It's very relaxing and versatile. After migrating from an Archos to a Nexus 7, some of the sounds were missing. My email to support was answered very quickly and they provided easy instructions to get it working again, and plan to fix this in a future upgrade as well. This is my first review, as I wanted to give the developer high praises for outstanding support and a great app! Thanks!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Really enjoyed reading the book.  In book 2 Ana slowly begins to get more information out of Christian regarding his past experiences.  Christian's love for Ana drives him to make changes or concessions to keep her. You begin to understand the struggles he faces giving up control in certain areas due to his past.

B0054XOMX4|5.0|My son loves this beyblade and says it is the best one he has ever owned. Apparently he is winning much more often when using this beyblade.  Processing was very fast and product was exactly as described.  Would recommend the seller and this beyblade to anyone considering purchasing it
030758836X|5.0|Flynn delivers on the promise of her first two novels with this exceedingly twisted, riotously funny and distressingly human novel. Nick and Amy Dunne, a young married couple recently relocated from New York to Missouri, are about to celebrate their fifth wedding anniversary -- until Amy disappears that very morning. Things look worse and worse for Nick, who finds himself accused of her murder. His chapters of narration alternate with entries from Amy's diary over the previous year ... and then things get really good! I would give this 4.5 stars due only to how repellent these main characters turn out to be. The book was great -- but I was glad to have Nick and Amy out of my life.
B004XIZN5M|4.0|I was an avid weight lifter but it was getting boring and sometimes I would notice that I was not as functional as I would like. On top of that I was getting little injuries which I attribute to lifting weights since they went away when I stopped. On top of that going to the gym was time consuming and expensive. I was pretty excited when I found this book and since it would help be build strength that I have not been able to gain with 10 years of weight lifting plus keep me functional and impress my friends. Also, it is progressive so I do not get bored. The only reason I did not give this a 5 star was the writing was a little dry to get through. For more info I also did a book report on it: [...]
B008F5YDRI|4.0|A simple little jewel of a movie......a little romance, a little tension, some philosophy to think about, some humor....beautiful setting, great characters, good acting....an unexpected and very welcome gift when I rented this, and I'm going to buy it!
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I can't believe all the hype this book is getting.  The author has no skill in forming her characters and readers have no feel for what they are all about.  I guess it proves that sex sells.  Even if badly written.  I'm sorry I wasted my money.
B006PHD0RW|5.0|I thought this games was really thought through before being put on the app store. I never have problems with it. its cute. its just awesome.
B0031RSA24|3.0|I have enjoyed this which is my first book of Dawkins.  After a couple of chapters I have been wondering if I should not have first read 'The Selfish Gene' which might be more my interest. I am finding this book to be completely just about refuting every religious argument (well maybe the title should have given me that hint). Think this will be a good one if you want to gain some scientific arguments to refute religious arguments.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|as someone who struggles with sleep every night, this has been a huge help. there's lots of sounds to choose from to reach your personal happy place. when I wake up, the relaxing sounds get me back to sleep faster than just tossing &amp; turning on my own. this helps distract my racing mind to put me to sleep faster.
0547569653|5.0|This book is amazing. One of the best that I have read in a long time. It is very motivating and makes me want to find some deer paths to run on for hours. The difficult part for me was being injured and therefore unable to run more than 2 miles without severe pain in my knee.<br />I loved the addition of recipes at the end of each chapter and have tried several -- all with success. There are a few foods (like granola) that I already make and do not want to modify. But being a health conscious eater I found it quite educational to read what he takes with him on his long runs and it has inspired me to try out different foods and steer further away from the manufactured space saver glucose crap (like gels or jelly beans.<br />I have given this as a gift to 4 different people and plan to give it to more for when their birthdays come around.
B008BM9L72|4.0|Interesting to say the least. A bit over the top with the sex scenes but when you get passed that it.s a great story & thoroughly enjoyable.
B0064T6LV8|5.0|I played this game, and the picture is the best, and I played the diving level, so when the ball fell into the shark's mouth, I was totally freaked out!
B00846REIS|5.0|Excellent book!! Can't wait for the next one!! I loved the story didn't want it to end!! Everyone should read it!
B004OBQDHK|4.0|Yes, some 90's movies can be hard to sit through now a days.... NOT THIS ONE.  I have always enjoyed watching this movie.  Its a great plot, good action, and love the cast.  How can you not like a movie with Reeves, Swayze, and Busey in it??!?  The image of them in their president masks will always be very memorable.  If you haven't seen it, watch it.  And hell, right now its $7.99 for the movie on BLU-RAY.  Amazing deal.
B008M34INW|4.0|This movie is very similiar to Payback which he starred in as well. It is the type of movie that leaves rooting for the bad guy simply because everyone in it is a bad guy. It had great cast and Gibson's performance was outstanding.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|I like this app. its ringtone is better than my own alarm which has an annoying sound. highly recommended. I'm 12 years old!
B006KX3GXO|5.0|This thing is awesome. The problems I have with it are only because I can't draw. But that's not its fault. This thing makes me look good and Romney look bad... It changes things to your liking warping reality till others see your true vision! A propaganda machine hahahahaha death to all fascists! Affordable housing, living wages and healthcare for all!
B002UXRGM0|4.0|I bought the blu-ray version of \\"Life\\" after checking out a review for it on a website, and I was not disappointed! The image is crystal clear, with great detail and minimal noise and grain (which in some cases is simply unavoidable while filming), and did I mention the detail! Absolutely amazing. And the hi-def audio included is quite impressive as well.<br />The only thing that is (slightly) lacking are the assortment of bonus features. But as I purchased this product for the program itself, it is only a slight dip for me. And I can't imagine buying the U.S. Version so I could have the missing features, but be stuck with Oprah Winfrey narrating...who wants that? Definitely stick to the Richard Attenborough-narrated version!!!!<br />Well worth your money.
B0013ND36G|5.0|I have heard many reviews, especially from ardent fans on various sites.  Some say it was not up to the 1st 2 films but I don't really agree in all aspects.  The effort that went in to the car chase/crane/cop cars etc chase was very good, although to this day I never knew US authority cars were radio controlled.. Still.  I have painstakenly taken down names, events, details etc on all the Terminator franchises, so that nothing passes my attention.  I agree there were parts in the film that did not stand up to scrutity but there you go.<br />I can be contacted on sarahconnorfans.com under KevinInScotland (in england).<br />The blu-ray itself plays in very good quality in my multi-region player - no complaints there.<br />Anyone that's interested in reading terminator fanfic, follow this site fanfiction.net (my author name is KevinInScotland but you need to watch the TSCC 2 season eps. first.  Perhaps you can buy the discs from this site too).
030758836X|3.0|This is a fun book to read by the pool. Story line plays like a lifetime movie and is mostly ridiculous.
B007XF0X16|5.0|the action was non stop and the story line was captivating. the titans were awesome. just a good entertaining move all around. thanks for another grear buy!
B002VPE1B6|2.0|In my opinion, this film is seriously over-hyped. It's a combination of standard fare sci-fi with cultural clich&eacute;s piled on knee deep. We all know that so-called \\"advanced\\" cultures have changed, pillaged and sometimes destroyed aboriginal cultures throughout history. The message of this film seems to be: \\"Oh, how awful\\".<br /><br />And so it is and has been. But because virtually all \\"primitive\\" cultures have already been destroyed or corrupted by advanced cultures on Earth, the \\"message\\" appears to be directed toward the distant future. If it's directed toward contemporary cultures, it amounts to nothing more than a guilt trip. The retreat from the destruction of \\"the Tree\\" seems intentionally evocative of the Cherokee \\"Trail of Tears\\". I can only say: enough already! We already know we've been wicked... don't rub it in!<br /><br />But for special effects fans, it's definitely a treat. All kinds of cool stuff, including even \\"Mech Warrior\\" (a video game) simulations near the end, where the villain finally gets his comeuppance. Arrows from raptors defeat ATGs and Vulcan cannon aboard assault helicopters! Yay! (The problem being that such stretches the imagination beyond the breaking point.)<br /><br />Really, it's just silly; the kind of romance where the good guys win out against impossible odds... with Sigourney Weaver inevitably leading in the sci-fi genre born of 'Alien'. If we step back from it with a critical (and unfortunately realistic) eye, we recognize that this film is just a Pollyanna fantasy. If that's your gig, go for it. But do consider in the light of the special effects: why do we need actors?

1400052181|5.0|A great book! It explains the scientific portion of the story very well, so anyone can understand it. The author goes through great detail of Lacks' family background. You can connect with the family quite easily and feel for them. It's a quick read and definitely worth the purchase.

B0083EM24C|5.0|I never heard of this band before, I found this album randomly on MOG and really like it. Kinda catchy, rhythmically, and bubbly as someone else commented. Great album for work or car trip. I haven't really analyzed the lyrics yet, they flow with the other elements of the music and sorta fade into the soundscape.
B00881VLCE|5.0|Fun. Writing so it will stop asking me to review. Love the game! I really think you should get it since most of the puzzles are free and it is a great way to relax. Very zen.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|At first I didn't want to read it. Was not interested. Then I talk to others that liked it so I gave it a try. I loved it. I am reading second one now. I can't wait to see what the movie is about when it comes out on DVD.

034580404X|1.0|I emailed the company and they never got back to me. The product never came- I was charged for it. AWFUL SERVICE
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This 2nd Book in the trilogy was by far my favorite! The author added more depth to the characters revealing important details of their past. My emotions towards the characters changed; they both become much more likable. The whole dynamics of the relationship changes for the better making her stronger and him more romantic. The better storyline in this novel makes me think there actually COULD be a movie.
0345803485|1.0|I tried to read it, honest I did. But I couldn't even get through the first book. The writing just rambles, the \\"inner goddess\\" reference is absolutely nauseating, and I am deeply frightened to find that so many women not only like this drivel, they want men to read it as a how to guide!  WHAT??? You really want your man to treat you this way?<br /><br />I've read a lot of erotica and I have also written erotica, and some of my work has included bondage, but the partners always treat one another respectfully. There is no humiliation or intentionally causing physical or emotional pain. This book didn't even catch my attention with the first erotic scene.. many of the people I have talked to find it really raunchy, but I found it very lame. I've read much better in Harlequin romances.<br /><br />The only good thing I can see in this is that if this lame excuse of an attempt at erotica got published, I know I can get published if I want to, not tooting my own horn, mind you. It seems to me the majority of people today don't expect a whole lot from literature anymore. I'm certainly glad I am not one of them.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Works very well and doesn't bug you. Although it takes some time you should run the calibration as it is remarkably accurate after that.
B0077DBZXO|1.0|Went to play video & would not work after purchasing it and having watched it several times. Spend an hour on the phone with amazon, had to delete every other movie off and redownload them all again later to find out they lost the rights to the movie! My problem with this is that it took ME to call and waste my time when they lost the rights to it, not me. How long until they would have reimbursed me if I had not of called?...then they want me to write a review on my recent purchase...really amazon?!?
0439023513|5.0|I love the hunger games and this book is in awesome condition so I loved the book even more because it looked gr8 2 ;P
B007SGM084|1.0|I find the first book to be very disturbing. I could not even move on to the second book. I don't understand what all the hype is with this series.  The relationship in the first book is not a fantasy, it is a nightmare!!!

B005LAII3A|3.0|\\"Total Recall\\" with Colin Farrell is more a remake of the 1990 Arnold Schwarnegger version than the Philip K. Dick short story, \\"We Can Remember it for you Wholesale,\\" and from there, there are a mixture of influences, the world in this \\"Recall\\" is clearly the \\"Blade Runner\\" world of Ridley Scott and weirdly enough there seem to be influences of \\"Star Wars: Revenge of the Sith.\\"<br /><br />This Recall focuses more on action, which has a scene in which Farrell and Beckinsale jump several floors of space, crash through numerous windows and land on what looks like very hard concrete slabs all without breaking any arms, legs or ribs. There are also car chases and elevator chases (the Star Wars influence as well as the very disposable synthetic police force).<br /><br />Both movies share with the story \\"We Can Remember it for you Wholesale\\" what they share with the story is that disgruntled factory worker drudge Douglas Quade longs for a more meaningful, adventure laden life and he is offered the chance to live out his dreams at Total Rekall, a sort of travel agency that will let you live out those fantasies and you will experience them as real and happening to you. After Quade is hooked up to the dream machine something goes drastically wrong when it's discovered Quade really was a spy, that's about where Philip K. Dick left it, from there on in the Schwarzenegger version takes over and everybody is trying to kill Quade, who as time goes on is remembering more about who he was and who he is. Both movies mess with your head with challenging Quade's sense of reality and what is really real and depending on who you believe in the movie(s) Quade is either a spy that was turned to the rebel's cause, or it was all an elaborate plan to let the resistance think Quade had turned in able to track down the resistance leader Matthias and expose and kill him.<br /><br />It's good to see Colin Farrell seeming to make a full revival of his career after the brief part in \\"Crazy Heart\\" in 2009 he seems back in full strength in \\"Total Recall\\" as Quade, he's easily a better actor than Schwarzenegger and in the few scenes where he acts (as opposed to being chased or shot at) they are very satisfying moments and you believe his angst at not knowing who he really is. Kate Beckinsale plays Quade's wife, Lori, and is a lot more predatory and persistent than Sharon Stone was in the same role in the 1990 version. Bryan Cranston as Cohaagen is good at channeling his dark side playing a ruthless politician manipulating everyone, especially the public in order to justify an invasion. And Jessica Biel as Melina, Quade's true love that showed him the truth of the resistance, doesn't seem to generate any real heat or chemistry in her relationship with Quade.<br /><br />The 1990 version of \\"Total Recall\\" messes with your head more, while this version the special effects far outshine what was possible in 1990. Which did I like better? It's a coin flip but I lean more towards the 1990 version, but still if you want to have a pleasant evening of watching the movie on DVD or Blu-Ray you'll enjoy it and maybe they'll put some cool behind the scenes features on the DVD/Blu-Ray version. Because this \\"Total Recall\\" follows the 1990 version so closely I'm left with the same conclusion as Roger Ebert, that while this was an entertaining, enjoyable movie, was it really necessary to remake it?in 2009 he seems back in full strength in \\"Total Recall\\" as Quade, he's easily a better actor than Schwarzenegger and in the few scenes where he acts (as opposed to being chased or shot at) they are very satisfying moments and you believe his angst at not knowing who he really is.

B003LPV960|5.0|The \\"Blu-Ray\\" edition of Nanny McPhee is a wonderland of color.  The look of this film is as important as the delightful story being told, and this format does not disappoint.  Spectacular color and depth of field.<br />This is a lovely, off-beat, quirky film and one that bears repeated viewing.  Seems I find something new each time I watch it.<br />Emma Thompson is terrific both as the screenwriter and as the title Nanny.  She must have her own magical powers, because she manages to get A-list actors in both this film and for its lesser sequel.<br />Many forget Colin Firth is a superb physical comedy actor, in addition to being a sort of penultimate romantic lead.  He is wonderful as Mr. Brown in the film.<br />Great support is offered by Angela Lansbury, Celie Imrie, Imelda Staunton, the lovely Kelly McDonald, Derek Jacobi among others, including the appealing children.<br />If one is planning a purchase of \\"Nanny McPhee\\", Blu-Ray is the way to go if one has the home capabilities to support it.
B005IQZB14|4.0|Typically, I don't read memoirs.  I tried to get through Eat, Pray, Love and made it through but struggled.  This was a different story.  I was drawn in immediately and stayed engaged throughout.  I was amazed by this woman who decided to hike these trails on her own without previous experience.  It was a wild ride.
B000K7MMP4|5.0|I know many people do not like this adaptation, but it is my favorite one. Darcy and Elizabeth might not be liked by a modern taste, but they are very consistent and credible characters. I love this series.

B00845PV16|1.0|A drive through pay check for Cage.  I'll pretty much stay awake for anything with Nick C. --even when he's bad he's usually watchable but I actually fell asleep during this piece of trash.  What a waste of time and talent ... unless of course, you're getting paid a pile of cash to reprise a terrible role that has B movie written all over it.
0142419400|2.0|Warning: I hate to do this because I try NEVER to be spoilery but this review cannot be written without containing a few spoilers.<br /><br />Anna and the French Kiss on the surface is simple straightforward Chicklit. It's sweet and innocent with loveable characters and the backdrop of Paris. What more could you ask for? Unfortunately a lot.<br /><br />I really had a hard time liking either of the main characters. Anna seemed really shallow and whiney. She was all put out that she got to spend her entire senior year in Paris...THE Paris. She whined about it incessantly through the first chapters and then continued to whine about her father (who was very Nicholas Sparks-esque which did make me laugh a lot) for most of the story. And like omigosh, she only gets like just enough allowance to go to like 6 movies in one week. Like really? That's like so unfair, Dad. Hmmm...not really feeling it. To be fair, her parents did fight a lot and her dad is rather distant and like I said, Nicholas Sparks so a bit melodramtic but I felt like she was overdoing the teenage angst. The one thing I did like about her was her unwillingness to come between Ellie and St. Clair/Etienne. I admired her for that. It showed strength on her part and a true depth to her feelings for him. Wanting him to be happy and be his friend until he was willing to break it off with his girlfriend.<br /><br />Etienne/St. Clair is a super sweet boy. I loved the things he did for Anna and the way he treated her for the most part. They had an adorable relationship, very sweet and innocent. However, despite this he is overwhelmingly weak when it comes to relationships. This is the part that bugged me the most. He continually turns from his feelings for Anna and runs back to Ellie long after he should have ended it. He waits around for her to make HER feelings completely clear by forcing her to ask him to kiss her before finally ending a relationship that should have been over MONTHS ago.<br /><br />I could havemaybe overlooked this if he had come to her at the end and said in his polite British accent, \\"You know what, Ah-na, I've been a bloody wanker. Please forgive me.\\" But no, rather than taking the blame for it, he blames her for not telling him how she felt and trying to move on with other guys. HE HAD A GIRLFRIEND! She was not going to be THAT girl. Very frustrating and sort of ruined my view of him. I wanted to see a guy with some guts, who's willing to step out of a relationship just because it's not what's right for him, not stay in a relationship until he's sure he can jump right into another one because he's afraid of being alone. It really weakened his character for me and took away the depth of his feelings for Anna. If he really loved her that much, why would he stay with someone else?<br /><br />Also, the secondary characters, other than Rashmi and Amanda, were very wooden and flat. Rather than adding a lot to the story I felt like they were simply plot devices and didn't really help me to love the main characters. Etienne's bad relationship with his father could have been a lot stronger too. He was shown as controlling and there was some hinting at possible abuse but nothing concrete. He was a jerk for sure but didn't make me feel an intense hatred for him the way I have in other books. He just annoyed me and pointed out Etienne's weakness more than anything.<br /><br />The romance between Anna and Etienne/St. Clair was so beautiful. It was built gradually with the innocence and intensity of first love. Perkins captures that delicious feeling very realistically, however it is completely overshadowed for me by his tediously long relationship with Ellie and Etienne/St. Clair's weakness.<br /><br />In short, Anna and the French Kiss just didn't do it for me. I really did not enjoy this book. I hoped I would. I kept trying to, but honestly I just couldn't seem to figure out how to like it. I questioned this at first because it's very well written and the setting is gorgeous. But it all boiled down to the actual story and it's characters. For me, that's not a fun read.
B008JH5FZ6|3.0|If you like Luc Besson's B movie, french fried action,  then by all means get the ketchup.  I found it moderately entertaining mostly due to Guy Pierce walking through a role for a paycheck.  You'll still be hungry a half hour after this snack.  Okay popcorn fun for a $4.00 dollar rental.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|this a fun super Mario like 2d adventure game. I love the subtle changes to the game that truly make it its own. keep it up guys!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|this game keeps my 5 year old very entertained!!! although it is not a learning game if we are in a doctors office he stays entertained.
B0086700CM|4.0|This is a fun and fast paced game. Never a dull moment. It is a great game for all but the very young child.
B004XJRQUQ|3.0|I was glued to my kindle for the first two in the series. The third book starts off a little slower, but was a good read. Was disappointed with the last book as it appeared the author took bad advice from the publisher to get the book out. Appeared rushed at the last third of book and then there was an odd twists that didn't fit the flow of the book. I would read other books from the author.
030758836X|1.0|I want to immediately state the the book kept me reading. The story is about two self absorbed people that find each other and marry. Now the story takes a dramatic turn when the wife turns up missing and all eyes are on the husband. Finding out he's a philanderer and just all around jerk, you'll immediately believe that not only is he a bad husband, but that he's guilty. The book then focuses on the wife, how she created her own staged disappearance, and her history of these vile retaliations she has a history of inflicting on those close to her. She's a rich brat, she's selfish, and even though her husband has cheated on her and doesn't love her anymore, she feels he should pay with his life. This being her motivation to stage her own \\"murder,\\" she disappears for a while, until she is suddenly without any of the money she'd saved preparing for her getaway. I won't say too much more, but after returning to her husband, killing a close friend to pin the blame on in the process, she is given everything she wants. That's it! The rich, crazy b*tch wins! That ending, my God, WORST ENDING OF ANY BOOK I'VE EVER READ! Ive read review on here that say people that didn't get the ending are just not fully understanding of the book. That both awful main characters deserve each other. That is so outrageously stupid, I just cannot fathom anyone actually believing that. People fall out of love, people cheat, but people don't stage murders to pin it on their spouse. The wife not only does it to him, but stages scenes like this with friends throughout her life. Only to give the aura of being a victim her entire life. Rapes, stalkers, she's accused people of everything to let everyone know how important and perfect she is, or at least she thinks she is. And in the end, this atrocious ending, she wins. Wins out royally. She will continue to be crazy, to play the victim, and everyone will feel sorry for her. And that's it. Don't buy this book. You'll hate that you read it and feel terrible that the awful, disgusting, murderer wins out in the end. Again, DO NOT PURCHASE THIS BOOK.

B0030B624E|5.0|This movie is awesome... Funny, Gory, and just campy enough that you cannot help but have a great time watching it. Might also add that Woody Harrelson makes his character in this movie the only person I wanna cruise through the Zombie Apocalypse with :)

B008JGSM6G|5.0|I got this app because I realized I didn't have many games to play on my Kindle and Phone I downloaded it first on my phone and loved it. The puzzle type game is much more my speed than most other games I have tried and really enjoy the challenge of fitting all the lines together so that they fit. I would recommend it to any one who just wants an easy way to pass the time.
B002KS1IJC|1.0|One of the worst movies in recent memory. Why is there no option to give ZERO STARS?<br />I so wanted this to be a decent movie. Well, it was not ment to be. What was John Hurt doing in this I will never know.
B000784WMW|5.0|I'm not into Drama, love comedy whatever type films. I usually stick with Horror, Sci-fi, Fantasy, Crime Documentaries. However, the story of Jane Eyre is ONE, and I think the only one, of my favorite love stories that I can watch and get engrossed in. I have seen the 1983 (Dalton), 1996 (Hurt), 1997 (Hinds), and the 2006 (Toby Stephens), and may get around to watching the new one 2011 with Fassbender. Out of all of them, the 1983 is my FAV!!! It stays very close to the book and is longer so you get to see more character and relationship development. The storyline is more detailed - love it!<br /><br />Timothy Dalton, my god, the man was sooo FINE in that movie. Tsk, they just don't make men like Dalton anymore :( He has a gorgeous and manly profile. He is every romance reader's wet dream :) Right next to Fabio. YES! I cannot believe it's not butter. Anyway I digress. I really enjoyed watching Zelah Clarke. I think she was the closest to portraying the true Jane. Her performance was awesome! You easily fall in love with her. I couldn't stand the Jane Eyre (Charlotte Gainsbourg) in the 1996 version. She was just weird @_@! Like an emo-weird? Anyway, get ready for a treat with this 1983 version. I love it so much that I went an bought a copy so that I can have it forever and ever :)
0736621458|4.0|\\"Are there no pleasant things to speak of?...Do we have to talk always of horrors?\\" asks Maria at one point in For Whom the Bell Tolls.<br /><br />Good question.<br /><br />To be fair, For Whom the Bell Tolls isn't ALL about horrors.  It even has some pleasant moments.  But ultimately, it's about the selfless nature of war---which, though Hemingway clearly intends us to admire the acts of sacrifice to which the war incites his characters, I think is the greatest condemnation of war.<br /><br />But Hemingway's portrayal of this theme is quite powerful.  He isn't always consistent, but he is about as consistent as it is possible to be about such a theme and much more so than most, which is of great artistic value.<br /><br />It's also generally very well written, much more so than (and something of a relief after reading) a lot of faux-Hemingway like John Steinbeck or Cormac McCarthy.  And I thought this was much better than the only other Hemingway I've read, A Farewell to Arms.  But there are a few passages that miss the mark, such as this almost comically bad sex scene: \\"...They were having now and before and always and now and now and now. Oh, now, now, now, the only now, and above all now, and there is no other now but thou now and now is thy prophet. Now and forever now. Come now, now, for there is no now but now. Yes, now. Now, please now, only now, not anything else only this now, and where are you and where am I and where is the other one, and not why, not ever why, only this now; and on and always please then always now, always now, for now always one now; one only one, there is no other one but one now, one, going now, rising now, sailing now, leaving now, wheeling now, soaring now, away now, all the way now, all of all the way now; one and one is one, is one, is one, is one, is still one, is still one, is one descendingly, is one softly, is one longingly, is one kindly, is one happily, is one in goodness, is one to cherish, is one now...\\" blah blah blah.<br /><br />The mind-numbing repetitiousness of this \\"description\\" (if one can call it that) is especially unfortunate as it echoes another passage just a few pages earlier which is intended to have quite a different feel: \\"...muck this whole treacherous muckfaced mucking country and every mucking Spaniard in it on either side and to hell forever. Muck them to hell together, Largo, Prieto, Asensio, Miaja, Rojo, all of them. Muck every one of them to death to hell. Muck the whole treachery-ridden country. Muck their egotism and their selfishness and their selfishness and their egotism and their conceit and their treachery. Muck them to hell and always. Muck them before we die for them. Muck them after we die for them. Muck them to death and hell...\\"  It goes on like this at some length.<br /><br />But in the end, Hemingway affirms that there are \\"pleasant things to speak of\\": \\"That is in Madrid. Just over the hills there, and down across the plain. Down out of the gray rocks and the pines, the heather and the gorse, across the yellow high plateau you see it rising white and beautiful. That part is just as true as Pilar's old women drinking the blood down at the slaughterhouse. There's no one thing that's true. It's all true. The way the planes are beautiful whether they are ours or theirs.\\"  But the horrors win out in the end: \\"The hell they are, he thought.\\"<br /><br />Three and a half stars.r /><br />The mind-numbing repetitiousness of this \\"description\\" (if one can call it that) is especially unfortunate as it echoes another passage just a few pages earlier which is intended to have quite a different feel: \\"...muck this whole treacherous muckfaced mucking country and every mucking Spaniard in it on either side and to hell forever.

B007J4T2G8|1.0|If I could give less than a one star I would.  This was positively the worst book I have ever read and I cannot for the life of me figure out why this book has so much publicity.  The writing was juvenile and corny and sooooooo boring.  I managed to struggle through the first book only because my friend loaned it to me.  I was told the second book is better...NOT TRUE. Don't waste your time or your money reading this trash.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|Fun game but there needs to be a better/ easier way to get acorns. Overall I love it. I am currently creating my second village.
B006LSZECO|2.0|For the #1 spot on Kindle. I was expecting to be blown away by this book . It was ok at best. Just read a great book that was only 2.99 by a new author . check out Premonitions by Amber Colleen.

B008OOYALE|3.0|I do like this game but it has a lot of problems. if you aren't an Apple user then you will not have any new updates for a very long time or at all. the game runs smooth and the graphics are good but I'd play dragon vale over this game any day. earning in game money is very hard and everything costs a lot. you don't have to use real money and its nice that you can talk to other players.

0345803485|1.0|As a former bookseller, I like to read any new book that has a lot of \\"buzz\\" surrounding it, so I picked up Fifty Shades. I read enough to get the idea and see what the fuss was about, but had no interest in the characters, topic or what might happen so I stopped. Any more would have been hours of my life I could not have gotten back. The topic is scintillating but the writing was so awful I couldn't stand it. (How many times can one \\"bite her bottom lip\\"?) I went to a party with a lot of booksellers about a week later and we all felt the same way. I know a lot of women who have read all three books and they say the books were \\"just fun\\". I think I can find other books that are fun, sexy and well written.

0345803485|1.0|Having read all three boring books I find the author is totally repetitive to the point where I started skipping paragraphs and sections. The plot is very amaturish and the female character - Anastasia is nothing short of a whiny female who complains far, far too much about all her insecurities. If you like reading about sex, then stick with the first book only although there is much better out there.
0307456323|3.0|This is a great book and defiantly well written. I saw the movie and loved it, so I decided to try the book to see how it compared. As it turns out the book was not as good compared to to the movie, the ending was disappointing and lacked the impact that the movie had.I am not saying that the book wasn't good, but it defiantly wasn't as expected. So if you absolutly loved the movie as I did, you may not be too impressed with the written version.
B005SQ3AI0|5.0|There are few voices as warm and inviting as Dinah Washington's.  You can just feel the music bringing on a warm sultry evening with no holds barred.  This is a remarkable set, and a great deal.  The jewel case sucks, however, so be careful.  I was careful and it still broke all to pieces which makes it hard to contain and restrain the 4 wonderful CD's confined within it.  Good music deserves good protection so that you can listen to it over and over again, as you surely will want to.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|There are 5 parts to this book.  I read the first part for free and thought I would give the rest of the book a shot because the first part told an intriguing story.  I loved the second part even more and after I read the last paragraph of part two I was hooked.<br /><br />What a great read.  Great story.  Spectacular character development.  Some fun twists and turns.  Honestly I was up late at night reading this book because I could not put it down.  It is one of those rare books that suck you in and will not let you go.<br /><br />Thanks for the great read Hugh.  I look forward to more of your story's.

B0089LT8Y6|5.0|I admit at first I thought Dark Roots was a big disappointment,  but after a few listens the light turned on.  It's even better than overkill! Who I do like by the way, lol.  I hear a little of every era of testament on this CD,  the title track,  A Day In The Death and Cold Embrace sounds like it could have been on Pratice what you preach, while Throne Of Thorns Sounds like The Gathering.  The lryics arn't Chucks best,  but vocally And musically are top notch.  Out of the 3 cover tunes only animal magnetism should have made the cut, it's a great cover.  While Queen's fab but don't fit testament's style and power slave is a decent cover.  overall,  a really good release from testament.

B00004VW35|4.0|Neil Young has always sneaked dollops of the country sound in his music, but \\"Old Ways\\" is one of the times he went all the way. Even Willie Nelson and Waylon Jennings showed up. Released during his highly experimental phase in the 1980s with Geffen records, fans probably shurgged it off at the time as \\"another messy miss.\\" At the time, Neil was trying the patience of his record label, and possibly some fans, with the wild synth rock of \\"Trans\\" followed up with the incredibly short \\"Everybody's Rockin'\\" - in two short years he leapt from Kraftwerk to Buddy Holly. The man definitely has range. But the precedents set by the previous two Geffen releases may have provided the psychological push for many fans to smear \\"Old Ways\\" as fetid tripe and not give it a second listen. Some may have stayed away simply due to the \\"country\\" label.<br /><br />That's all too bad, because \\"Old Ways\\" includes some great country songs that show an absolute mastery of the form. Stunning billowing harmonica opens the record like a cool breeze through an old willow tree. It's one of the most longing and lonely sounds Young has crafted. Flying Dutchman strings then punctuate the chorus. This track definitely sits comfortably beside Young's best covers. Then the the cattle prod comes out for \\"Back to the Country,\\" to which only people with their feet encased in cement wouldn't dance to. Willie Nelson saddles up for the next number, \\"Are There Any More Real Cowboys,\\" which could have easily played on any 1980s country station. And it's really fun to hear Nelson sing \\"not the one that's snortin' cocaine when the honky-tonks all closed\\" with utter conviction. Next, a classic country ballad, sung to a dream woman, slows down the pace and allows for a slow dance. Press her close, now.<br /><br />Nearly every Young album contains some oddity, but \\"Old Ways\\" hides one of the classics: \\"Misfits\\" isn't really a country song... it's... umm... not a country song. Young sings of \\"space stations,\\" \\"a see-thru' hooker\\" and \\"elephantine.\\" It starts with a simple rhythmic thud and crescendos with strings and wailing voices that shower over the mix like distant fireworks. The song may have fit better on an album such as 1987's \\"Life,\\" but here it definitely provides variety and color. It's probably one of his most underrated obscure songs. A live performance of \\"California Sunset,\\" once the first song on side two, again boosts the mood with a fervent ode to the golden state. The crowd seems to agree. The title track exudes the classic sloppy and irresistible country sound that remains one of Young's most endearing trademarks. Young is definitely not set in his ways, apart from his defiance of record label demands. And one more country superstar joins Young on \\"Bound For Glory,\\" another song which probably should have sat high on the country charts. Waylon Jennings and Young sing about passionate vagabonds on a mission and who were \\"bound for each other.\\"<br /><br />\\"Old ways\\" probably plays better today than in 1985 because Neil has made astonishing comebacks since those murky Geffen days. Some at the time felt his career was over. Far from it. It was just one more phase in a career that still remains undefinable. And though he recently sang that his \\"sales have tanked\\" he seems to keep going nonetheless. \\"Old Ways,\\" though probably not for everyone, remains a testament to the fascinating career of a musician who seems to be able to pull off just about anything. When's the qawwali album?thru' hooker\\" and \\"elephantine.\\" It starts with a simple rhythmic thud and crescendos with strings and wailing voices that shower over the mix like distant fireworks.

B006M7JCC2|5.0|This book took me on a journey to a Near Death Experience, which is a place I have never been.  Although it was a very personal experience, I feel that we can all apply the principal of \\"unconditional love\\" in our lives. I do believe that miracles do happen every day. This book confirms that.
B004YJZ5TO|2.0|Jean-Claude Van Damme appears in this movie, but as a support. His role is a pretty small one (his screen time is about ten minutes or less), although the film's DVD jacket might lead you to believe otherwise.<br /><br />\\"Dragon Eyes\\" is directed by John Hyams (\\"Universal Soldiers: The Next Generation\\"), son of Peter Hyams, who directed two Jean-Claude Van Damme films back in 1990s,  \\"Timecop\\" and \\"Sudden Death.\\" In \\"Dragon Eyes\\" Cung Le plays Ryan Hong, a stranger with a past who has just arrived in St. Jude, a town ruled by a corrupt police officer Mr. V (Peter Weller). The first thing mysterious Hong does after renting a room is beating up the local drug dealers terrorizing the street.<br /><br />As the film's story unfolds, we notice that \\"Dragon Eyes\\" is part inspired by Kurosawa's classic \\"Yojimbo,\\" or Sergio Leone's remake \\"A Fistful of Dollars.\\" But the film obviously aspires to be more than that, as seen in the stylish 70s-style opening credit. The confusing script and its meandering plot don't make much sense with too many supporting characters, flashbacks and incidents that are incredible even by the standard of action films.<br /><br />But what we need action. Jean-Claude Van Damme appears as Hong's mentor-like figure teaching martial arts in prison, but as I said before, his role is an extended cameo and his scenes are mostly shot with dim lighting. The film's fights are all in all decent, but often look bland. Cung Le shows what he can do as an accomplished martial artist, but the film still needs a better choreographer.<br /><br />Perhaps the best thing about the film is the fine performance of Peter Weller, who steals every scene he is in. This is not a difficult thing to do for the veteran actor.

B004PGNB1K|3.0|I have read the Name of the Wind about 4 times now, and I just finished the second reading of The Wise Man's Fear.<br />Here are my impressions about the Wise Man's Fear.<br />First of all, it is an enjoyable tale, but not as consistent or well written as it could have been. The hero, Kvothe, continues the story of him growing up. At the end of the book, I could not help having mixed feeling about him.<br /><br />First of all, about the writing style. Mr Rothfuss is a great writer, but I feel his books may suffer from the pressure to publish imposed on him by the publisher. Mr Rothfuss needs time, just like a good wine. Give him time to polish and you will have a great book. Hurry him and you will end up with a nice story. In The Wise Man's Fear, descriptions of scenes, impressions and actions are almost always done using the adjective \\"sharp\\": \\"his eyes were sharp and bright\\", \\"sharp as shattered glass\\", \\"sharp and strong and sweet\\", \\"sharp as early morning birdsong\\", \\"sharp breath\\", \\"every sharp and painful thing\\", \\"sharp as a mouthful of boken glass\\", \\"sharp crack of splintering wood\\"...Sometimes it is ok and conveys well the impressions of the character but after some time it feels a little bit overused and repetitive. I would have liked to read a more varied Rothfussian style.<br /><br />Some side-stories in the book I could not really care for. The whole Felurian ark, in which Kvothe learn uninhibited sex from a sex god and thereafter becomes a pornstar with University girls, did not contribute to building him as a wothwhile character. The endless descriptions of kama-sutra style techniques was quite heavy handed.<br /><br />About the hero himself, I feel a bit confused. We are told many times he behaves older than he looks, but his actions, especially in the Wise Man's Fear, are incredibly puerile. He learns everything quickly but he never grows wiser or more patient. He has a inflated sense of his own importance and likes spreading rumours about himself. Moreover, in the few sections of the book told in the present, in which the hero is adult and tells the story of his life, Kvothe the hero always end up criticizing somebody, almost insulting at times , as if he knew that he so much better than anybody. Kvothe seems to be a condescending snob. At the end of the Wise Man's Fear, I liked the hero better as the kind, unassuming and efficient inkeeper. If this was Mr Rothfuss's intention, then I need to increase my 3-star rating. At the moment, I am just confused. I hope Kvothe grows up to be a responsible young adult in the next book.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|My husband and I love it. It's so relaxing. A must have for those with insomnia like my husband. : )
B006RUJST6|5.0|Loved this story!  It was up, it was down, it made me laugh out loud and cry!  I really felt like I knew the characters and what they were going though.  I thought it was cleverly written and will read more books by this author when they come out.  This is the 1st book in this 2 book series and they were both awesome.  I highly  recommend this book.
0545265355|5.0|Couldn't have loved these books more. I think EVERYONE should read them at some point. No matter what age you are, you will not be disappointed with the read.
142311339X|5.0|If you like mythology coming to life, you will enjoy this book. \\"The Lost Hero\\" begins Riordan's second YA series - the Heroes of Olympus - which follows his highly popular Percy Jackson series. Riordan does not let down his readers as he continues his clever story telling while now mixing the Greco-Roman mythologies with a newer \\"Roman\\" camp for Roman demi-gods. Whereas the focus of the Percy Jackson series was Greek Mythology, this new series (alluded to in the Jackson series) focuses on the children of the Roman gods and their offspring at a camp similar to Camp Half-Blood. \\"The new cast features Jason, Piper, and Leo, teen demigods who are just coming to understand and use their unique abilities as they learn how much depends upon their wits, courage, and fast-developing friendship.\\"  There are some of our \\"former friends\\" in this series as well. Searching for the missing Percy, Annabeth arrives and takes Jason, Piper, and Leo to Camp Half-Blood, where they learn that they are demigods. Their parents are gods in their Roman rather than Greek personae. And, as in the other books, the Quest: by sunset of the solstice in three days, the teens must rescue Hera, Queen of the gods, otherwise the giant king created to destroy Zeus and unseat the gods of Olympus, will rise. Their quest takes them across the United States, sometimes flying on a mechanical, 60-foot dragon. This is an amazingly creative and enjoyable book; my thanks to Rick Riordan for making another wonderful series that will feed my addiction for mythology!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|awesome fun game-superb graphics- works awesome on my kindle fire-<br /> unlimited play- just a really fun game! for all ages!
B005HSL626|5.0|If you are looking for something that you would play when you are bord or on a long car ride this would be perfect and it is great ,fun, addicting, and free!
B008OOYALE|1.0|this app is such a copy of tiny monsters i love tiny monsters and i thought this was goinig to be better than it but it stinks
B008MEM24S|5.0|bought this since my son loves Phineas and ferb so much. i love it so much though that he never even gets to play! way better than where's my water.. i like how they incorporate steam, rain, and water into the brain teasers...
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I love this game and I play it every day! I like looking at other peoples villages and buying animals for the village. This is a fun app! Go get it!
B0089LT8Y6|5.0|I'd like to compare this to The Ritual, Souls of Black or Practice What You Preach, but I cant.  Why?  Because this is even better.  Yes, I can hear your doubt, but Dark Roots of Earth is the Testament album that I've been waiting for since mid-90's Low.  As much as I loved Demonic, Gathering and appreciated Formation of Damnation, this one just nails it in the metal testicles.  Formation was a good album but it felt \\"forced\\".  This one feels like the metal gods handed down the sheet music and said \\"go forth, bring my fury and swift vengeance!\\" At one point in the late 80's early mid 90's Testament was a metal force for the Big 4 to consider opening up to and accepting as its 5th member.  They had a few slip ups and didnt make it.  They're back and have rightfully earned their place at the table. I would easily go as far and say that this album is a measuring stick for Metallica to knock themselves out with, wake up and start making metal like they used to.  It has everything that you could expect from a Testament album from the late 80's/early 90's (minus the big hair). In my honest opinion, Dark Roots of Earth is definately leading the pack for best metal album of the year!
B0067R0APK|4.0|Informative... but not as current as another app I use..would recommend to keep track of upcoming storms...would like to see a few updates on app
B0017SWPXY|1.0|A first-year fiction-writing course product, misleading dog-loving readers into purchasing a book which, in fact, is full of information about car racing (showing the author has worked hard among newspaper clippings and has also chatted up a bunch of mechanics).  The author, here and there, has carefully underlined some life lessons (helpfully listed them at the end of the book, too, presumably for book club members to take to heart).  He has also rolled in action (nasty parents-in-law scheming);  cancer (death of mother) ; and  fairy-tale ending (dog reincarnated as boy, in car-racing-friendly Italy). Who could ask for anything more??  I didn't.
B007KCG7MQ|5.0|Not a big reviewer on stuff I buy but if your considering buying this ....just do it it is exceptional Walsh.
B007PT3QOQ|3.0|could be better if ya didn't need to buy stuff with cash or have a ton of friends to play along with you
B0077SGMXM|5.0|Save yourself the time and just start the download. This game is fun and the physics are pretty good. If you like a challenge, this game is for you.
B008MEM24S|1.0|I bought the game for my kindle fire but it wont let me download it...I keep getting an error message everytime I try to install it...I'm sure its a fun game but I wouldn't know because it seems to have some capatibility issues with some kindle fires.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I originally purchased this for my daughter, and when she was done with it, said `Mom, you NEED to read this!'  So, I listened to my 15 year old, and I'm glad I did!  The book takes place in a North America that has been destroyed and is now run by the powerful Capital and is divided into 12 districts (district 13 has been destroyed due to a rebellion). In district 12 ace hunter Katniss Everdeen, a 16 year old girl, carves out a meager existence for herself, her younger sister Prim and their widowed mother. In order to keep the 12 districts aware of who runs the county, the Capital arranges a game to the death each year in an elaborate arena. Each district holds a drawing of one boy and one girl to go as tributes. When her sister is picked, Katniss exercises her option to volunteer for the games. Along with Katniss comes also Peeta, the baker's son, who grew up with her.  Katniss and Peeta must fend for themselves against natural elements, the Gamemakers and the other contestants whose only option is to kill or be killed.<br /><br />So the book sounds simple enough, but also hits many themes including teenage anguish, love, work, poverty and more.  It was an easy and quick read, as well as full of action.  Now, anyone that has read my other reviews knows I compare almost everything to perhaps the best book I've read in a LONG while, Jonas Hyde's, Melpomene's Tears [[ASIN:B008EF2HZY Melpomene's Tears]].  While The Hunger Games hits nowhere near the emotional cords that Hyde's work does, it is definitely more easily digested.  As a whole, it is also much better than 50 Shades.  So, if you're looking for a quick read, check this out.  If you want something more heartfelt, go check out Hyde's work.  Either way, you will enjoy them both!
B003L77GRO|5.0|You can't stop watching, it's one of my favorite series.I look forward to buying the next one. You have to have them all.
B0025KW29U|5.0|Not much to say. I watched this film with my friend a while back, and knew I had to buy it.<br />Bluray is excellent, looks great, subtitles very clear and easy to read. Audio channels aren't off, etc.
B008N1V11U|5.0|this is a great game, the batpod controlled are a bit glitchy but otherwise, it is great. it reminds me of batman arkham city
B007J4T2G8|5.0|It is interesting to me that people are writing a (negative) review while saying \\"I can't get past the first sex scene\\" and things of the sort.  If you can't get past the first sex scene and therefore, the first 1/4 pages of the book, you shouldn't be writing a book review!!  You should read the whole book before you review it!  Otherwise, it's like my toddler who tells me that even though he likes tomatoes, he doesn't like roasted tomatoes ... despite the fact that he hasn't even tasted them.<br /><br />The writing is not AMAZING literature.  The story is entertaining, and, yes, it is arousing (unless you are sexually repressed and/or afraid to touch yourself after all the threats your parents told you about going blind - ha!), but the sex aside, it is an amazing love story.  It is the story that keeps me coming back for more - can't wait to read the next one!<br /><br />Give it a chance, read the whole thing... even the sex changes and develops and if you get over the \\"wows\\" and the \\"he's so hots\\" (yes, I agree that those are repetitive and a little cheesy) it is a very catchy love story.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|This is the 'hot' book everyone has been talking about?  I just don't get it.  It was completely unbelievable.  In this day and age, a beautiful college grad has never dated, kissed, fooled around with a man?  Really?!  The characters are never really developed and there really isn't much of a story.  And the writing is atrocious.
B0079XPUOW|4.0|As usual, Scalzi manages to come up with a very unique plot to explore.  The book's well-written, flows along nicely, and will definitely be appreciated by his fans and those who understand the title reference.
B0079XPUOW|4.0|This book is set up in the far future, whith the crew of a ship flying through space, exploring new worlds, and having severe problems along the way.  In fact it seems that this particular crew and it's officers seem to be getting into problmes all the time.  And it can be deadly for any away teams.<br /><br />So much that when the officers start looking for people to explore new planets, they have trouble finding them, unless they are nuggets just out of the academy.  People who don't know that they should fire their  ray guns or blasters near certain alien creatures.<br /><br />With all the problems it's amazing that the Officers always seem to survive, even if some of them get hurt.<br /><br />Why is it?
B003I7BBZ0|4.0|One of the tiny parts was missing from this set, but it's still useable. I could have retured it, but really could not be bothered for such a small part! I love the smurfs, so I'm a bit biased when I say I love these blocks!
B008MEM24S|5.0|Enjoying this game on my Galaxy tab 10.1. The graphics are fluid smooth and plays beautifully. If you have played [[ASIN:B006D1ONE4 Where's My Water?]] from Disney before you will find it is pretty much the same. However, there are some new twists to the game-play with heat-inators and cool-inators in the Tri-state sewer system.<br /><br />The really mad mad scientist Dr Doofenshmirtz's gadgets are seen to be scattered all over the game which makes the game challenging physics based game and funny too.<br /><br />There is constant chatter both via subtitle (Which can be turned off) as well as voice from the mad scientist and there is good story-line to follow which makes the characters and game-play interesting.<br /><br />It is a good game for the whole family. Kids love it so do I<br /><br />Good full Five Stars!

B007SYWFRM|5.0|this game is so awesome. you could play it all day. plus its kind of educational with all the different animals. it is so.much.fun. even adults love it. and its free. you couldn't get a better game.
B006LSZECO|3.0|The writing in this book was good, kind of a ping pong match between characters. The ending was awful! I'm sure the author could have done something better.It seemed as if she gave up and said, \\"Oh, I think I've written enough, I'll stop now.\\" It does not fit the rest of the book. Very disappointing....

0763650447|5.0|Our 14 month old LOVES this book, her face lights up when I take it down from the shelf (which cannot be said for all our books). The singsong cadence of the words and the bold and bright illustrations are perfect for a tiny \\"reader\\" and I can see the book still being interesting when she is older and can discuss the different kinds of fish. As a mommy I love the last page and I thank the author for getting me some extra kisses.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Great way to monitor battery usage for all uses tor kindle - reading - app- web - music etc. Very useful.
B00821PCJS|5.0|I had heard really good things about this show so I bought the instant video here at amazon and could not have been more satisfied. Not only is the show phenomenal but the fact that I didn't have to wait for the dvd to arrive in the mail made it even better. No buffering either. Great way to enjoy a season of great tv.
B005LCYR7Y|5.0|When I first heard about the basic plot for Stephen's latest, I thought, 'Yeah right; pull the other one.' But it actually works. I was taken on a trip of a better world in a better time and wondering what would happen next.

B000O8OTNC|5.0|Easy stupid proof way of sharpening any blade, I have used it on old razor blades for my razors and it makes them like new instead of spending so much money on them.<br />its so effective and fast,and no worry about chipping of dulling the blade by accident using it. That will never happen.
B008OOYALE|5.0|It's an awesome game if you enjoy the other Teamlava games. This one doesn't require purchases to get the best dragons. Sure it's a knockoff of another game, but that doesn't matter as it's fun and free!

0345803493|5.0|More, more, more.  I could not wait to start this book, then I was finished far too soon, I could have just read on and on.  I am mesmerized by the story and characters.  I have not read any books in years that have made me feel the way the Shades Trilogy has.  Good job E.L. James.
B007712XAU|1.0|Ordered on 1 July, here it is 8 August, still no product! Even if it is coming from Australia it shouldn't take over a month!
0345803507|5.0|I loved this book.  It was everything I could ask for in a book.  I went through each moment as if I were there with the characters.  I missed them as soon as I finished the trilogy.
B005QUQ99K|3.0|Got this for the kiddies because they are Ninjago addicts.  It's Lego, so everything fits together nicely and is high quality.  However, the vehicle is not very durable when built.  All the sword blades and other cool-looking crap hanging off the vehicle are easy to break off during vigorous play.  It's pretty much a shelf queen.  Have to put it up whenever younger kids come over to play because we would probably never get it back together if it was disassembled and mixed up with other Lego pieces.
0345803485|5.0|This book was so delicious, I could have eaten it.  I am madly in love with both main characters.  I could feel their pain and joy.  This is such a well written book.  Cudos to E.L. James, she is my new hero.  You have done it girl!  When can I expect the next Shades trilogy?
B007SYWFRM|5.0|easy to play great affect s very additive get all the extras first then your percentage is nhigher is awesome great
B005S9EL6C|5.0|I went into the movie theater without seeing any of the Step Up movies, I know crazy how have i not seen a movie with Channing Tatum in it, but as I was saying I saw this movie without seeing any of the predecessors and I actually loved it so much. At first I didn't really like the female lead but she grew on me as the movie carried on and the lesson behind the story was really great. The dances were really great and i would seriously be so excited whenever a new dance was about to start and my adrenaline would start racing and i couldn't like stop watching I just wanted them to keep doing dances. The movie was really great and I loved it and it made me watch the other movies as well. Seriously go see this movie whether or not you have or have not seen the past movies. I also did see it with two of my friends who have seen the other movies and they said it was there favorite out of all the movies.
B007I2BZIE|5.0|My children have been fans of Rush ever since they were very young, having followed them pretty much around the US and Puerto Rico.<br />I bought Clockwork Angels as a gift for Vadim, who is a psychiatrist now.  He was thrilled.<br />They will be fans forever.
B007XKEY6Q|2.0|The point of this game is fun but it takes hours for you to finally get your apponents draw back. It needs to be faster.
B005HSG3TC|5.0|Love this cover.  It's everything I could want in a cover for my Kindle Fire.  Hard case, yet soft to the touch,excellent protection.  Snap it in, snap it out.  Easy to handle.  The front flap is easy to manipulate, never awkward or in the way. Vey light weight.  It feels like part of the Kindle.
030758836X|3.0|I enjoyed reading this book.  The author was clever and her characters were interesting.  Her observations by her characters were very good.  And then I got<br />to the ending and threw the book across the room.  If ever a character was in need of some retribution it was this wife.  And nothing happened.  Terrible<br />ending - very unsatisfying and disappointing.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I love to play it!!!! It is so much fun. I play it almost 24/7!! You should play it to. You will most likely love it as much as me.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|This game is great! it totally reminds me of super Mario bros which I haven't played in years. so far I haven't encountered a bug or a problem.  challenging enough to be fun, but easy enough that I feel good about myself lol. get this game! you'll love it!
B005B0QYMM|5.0|Started slow but kept me connected to the characters. There were several times where the movie creeped me out. It is a must have if you have a paranormal collection like the paranormal activities and poltergeist.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|Works great, doesnt glitch or close out or mess with my alarm that I need to wake me up! I love all the alarm sound options, I have been wanting an alarm app that SLOWLY wakes me up by increasing in volume but I could also adjust the loudest possible noise it could make. Good app, def download :)
B006LSZECO|4.0|This book was written very cleverly. At first,  the rotating points of view in the chapters seemed odd but it all came together quickly as the plot began to unfold. The characters, Nick and Amy, are well developed, especially that of Amy. Just when I thought I knew her, there were some unexpected twists in the plot. I was riveted by this book and couldn't stop reading it. The ending is definitely surprising!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Who doesn't love the Fifty Shades trilogy !!  Wish there was another set coming out. Have to keep reading just to see what happens to Christian and Anna.  Wouldn't we all love to find a \\"Christian\\"
0345803485|1.0|According to Amazon's rating chart there are almost as many one star reviews as there have been five star. That's a lot of unhappy readers. But I find it hard to fault E.L. James or, sadly, her editor/publisher for it's popularity. There is a feature on Amazon's site that lets you read the first three chapters of the novel before purchasing. Clicking the image of the book cover will give you a taste of what's in store for you before parting with your money.<br /><br />Personally, I have to agree with the one star reviewers. I just hate that so many of them realized they wasted their time and money 20 pages into the book when they could have found that out for free.
B00884GR0W|5.0|The first thing I want to say is that the game is awesome and fun. First it has al lot of stuff like armor magic weapons swords and a lot of mobs
B00785P2QC|5.0|this is a really fun simulator game it is one of my favorites on my kindle. you should try it out you will enjoy the time you play. I'm over 8 million in points and its only been 4 days playing it.

B0052VUNHC|2.0|When I first started reading the book, the tension between Travis and Abby was interesting and I was curious to see if/when they would get together.  Once they got together, the book started to degenerate and become repetitious.  I also thought it was unrealistic that Abby would keep going back to Travis, who was proving to be uncontrollably violent, possessive, and just plain crazy.  I also thought it was unrealistic that he was able to beat up fellow students in the college cafeteria and not get arrested or reprimanded by the college authorities.  The guy should have been arrested and thrown into jail -- that we were supposed to think it was \\"cool\\" that he beat up fellow students for just making a joke or offhand comment about Abby is just ridiculous.  Maybe I'm just too old for this kind of crap reading.  Anyway, I finished the book just to see how it ended....can't say I would recommend it to anyone, especially young girls in their teenage formative years, who I think were the target audience for this book.  I only bought it because it was super cheap on Kindle.  I would have been more upset if I'd paid full price for it.
B0050DIWHU|5.0|Great book and worth the time to read.  You can do as little or as much of the changes that work for you.  Realistic, measurable advice.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|The games are very challenging and fun. You will enjoy the diversity and the precision in which each game entails and pushes you to the limit to complete it and move on to the next one. Also the bonus points are great and you will play for hours. Enjoy!

B0083EM24C|1.0|$7.99 for the CD, $10.99 for MP3 download!! Are you serious? No wonder the talentless morons that run the music industry are going down.
034580404X|4.0|My suggestion to anyone who plans on reading TRILOGY is to buy all three books at one time.  They are a fast read once you get caught up in the story.  Christian Grey is quite interesting as well as Anastasia Steel.  There are times Ana's thinking gets a little boring since she is forever trying to think too much.  But then, you find them both flying in CHARLIE TANGO[[ASIN:0345803485 Fifty Shades of Grey: Book One of the Fifty Shades Trilogy]]<br />Each book has it's own particular essence, and I found all of them quite interesting and funny at times.  I highly recommend reading as we did.  We are a group of cousins that do everything pretty much togethter and found this trilogy a big topic of conversation and laughter.
B001B2CPH2|5.0|One of my ALL TIME FAVORITES. The story can never get too old. Patrick and Demi are such a great combination.

B004J4WKTW|4.0|I enjoyed this book, although it was a little more fairy tale than I care for.  The storyline jumped around a little bit, but all in all, I would def recommend.
B005CRQ2IU|5.0|My review will just reiterate the thousands of critics in saying that this graphic novel is one of the best/smartest I've ever read. The story will engross you. The subject matter will terrify you. The ebook is well made - zooming in on each scene for optimal clarity. You will not regret reading this...just don't get it for your kids to read.
B00006L3S3|4.0|I've been used to the title track on the Lennon Legend compilation, but it sounds new and improved on this studio album. The \\"whistle-sounding\\" organ during the verses, and the \\"Love is the answer\\" sections finally come out as if the track is finally being able to breathe and have a better sound. As for the remaining tracks, I can tell these songs were hastily written just before the recording sessions; lyrically in particular. But again this is a good album to hear.
B0086700CM|4.0|This app is great. But it lagged so I had to turn the kindle off. I turned it back on the scores/coins were gone! WTF.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|The book does get a little more interesting as you go on, I read about 2 books a week and am going on my 4th week with this one.  Just can enjoy it in small doses.  If you are interested in S&M you will really enjoy it, lol, actually that is part of the book that can be boring. How many times can you read the same phrases without getting annoyed.  Sorry, bought this because of great reviews, too much $ for what it's worth to me.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I thought it is a fun game in all but I think they need make it easier to get points.
1568363931|5.0|I bought a bento box with the idea of portion control and needed help on how to use it.  This book offered more than I expected in the following ways.  First of all the pictured ideas are so appealing I couldn't wait to pack my first lunch.  I was delighted that some ideas are things I wouldn't have thought of and that while visually attractive, are not labor intensive.  You do have to prepare the food of course, but the included timelines and tips for make-ahead items seem to simplify the process considerably.<br /><br />The foods to include and recipes in the book were really a springboard for me.  Once I started thinking outside the box (or inside :), I could see a whole range of things that would work and give me lots of variety.  Although my first attempts included a chopped salad in the largest tray of my box, I did pack some rice, which I usually don't include in my meals all that much.  What a pleasant surprise to find it so filling and satisfying in this context.<br /><br />Seeing how the boxes were packed was another eye-opener.  I really liked the little silicone cups to divide the space and the containers to hold sauce.  I couldn't find the ones pictured but did find a couple of others that are working well.  The frilly lettuce dividers explained those little green pointy papers in sushi packs from the store.<br /><br />There is no question that the quantities are smaller than many Americans are accustomed to, but that in itself was a good lesson for me, and in my first few days of eating my bento lunch, I find I am completely satisfied.  I think it is partly because of the variety of tastes and textures of foods included.  The bright flavors make a few bites seem like more and each item is savored and appreciated from the first view upon opening the box to the last tasty morsel.  I felt I'd had a more complete meal than the standard American box lunch of a sandwich, piece of fruit and chips.  Speaking of sandwiches, I'm trying to cut down on gluten too and the rice works well instead of bread.  When I choose to include a sandwich in the future, I'll put in just one trimmed half as it fits the theme better and already a full sandwich seems like too much.<br /><br />Another thing I really liked about this book was that a variety of bento boxes are shown as containers so regardless of which kind you have you can see the possibilities.  I bought a Lock & Lock set--plebeian compared to the graceful Japanese boxes, but functional and I'm pleased with it.<br /><br />I'm so happy with this book, I immediately bought another for my daughter for her family.  Highly recommended.and the rice works well instead of bread.  When I choose to include a sandwich in the future, I'll put in just one trimmed half as it fits the theme better and already a full sandwich seems like too much.<br /><br />Another thing I really liked about this book was that a variety of bento boxes are shown as containers so regardless of which kind you have you can see the possibilities.  I bought a Lock & Lock set--plebeian compared to the graceful Japanese boxes, but functional and I'm pleased with it.<br /><br />I'm so happy with this book, I immediately bought another for my daughter for her family.  Highly recommended.

0060936223|5.0|This is one of those \\"must have\\" books that I didn't have.<br />After seeing Patti Smith on Charlie Rose, I knew I had to get the book.<br />Searching on Amazon for the book, I was shocked to see that some of the original hard-bound copies were selling for hundreds of dollars.<br />Fortunately, I found a used paperback copy, which is actually like-new.<br />Patti's book encompasses that magical, gentle time of the 1970's<br />in Manhattan, described by one critic as \\"a bohemian rhapsody\\".<br />The book centers around her friendship with Robert Mapplethorpe,<br />and the cast of characters she encounters during those years is<br />nothing short of fascinating.<br />Just Kids is a heartwarming link to bittersweet times gone by.<br />I highly recommend Just Kids.
1451627297|5.0|When I read Stephen King , sometimes I just think soo wordy, like my review of UNDER THE DOME, one thousand pages and disappointing.  11/22/63 is amazing, over eight hundred pages and simply repeating, amazing.  Fantasy, history, love story, live, all are prominent, you could read the book if into any of the four.  Mr. Jake George Puddentane Eppling-Amberson takes us on a fantasy adveture that seems so real.  The book is a time travel fantasy but it is so much more, so full of life.  No spoilers here but READ THE BOOK.  Wonderful.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED
B001NLL8LA|5.0|Reacher's riding the subway in downtown Manhattan when he spots what he thinks is a suicide bomber.  Enough said.<br /><br />What follows is an full-bore paranoid post-Patriot-Act page turner full of sparkling characterizations and intense suspense-filled action.<br /><br />A gem for fans of this very popular series.

B005LAIHSQ|1.0|Kristen Stewart does what she does best, nothing.  Had the movie been more focused on the evil queen, which is the impression I got from the trailer, it would have been awesome.  Charlize Theron did an amazing job and was wonderful to watch, but instead of focusing on her character we get to watch Kristen Stewart run around the forest for what feels like 20 hours while she makes the one and only expression she knows how.  It was boring.  I can say it was beautiful, the cinematography was great.
0060899220|5.0|I learned about Anthony Bourdain from his show No Reservations.  I love his show and his snarky attitude.  He has a way of speaking and describing things that really appeals to me.  So when I found out he wrote a book I eagerly obtained a copy.  It reads exactly the way he speaks in his show so I am totally thrilled with it.  If you like his saucy attitude and the way he rants about things on No Reservations, then you'll be pleased to read about his crazy journey through life and the culinary underworld.  He even provides you with valuable dining tips about what foods to avoid when eating out! Enjoy!
B0040NOWY8|1.0|The original spindle is a 5 stars product but no anymore;<br /><br />Many months ago I used a full spindle without problem, back them I remember paying $150, now I got a super deal from a Japanese seller and it turns out 7 coasters in a 20 tries and worse of all, the 13 remaining discs were not recognized by my Panasonic player (the same player use on my first order months ago) so I have the feeling that JAPANESE SELLERS are sending DEFECTIVE or DISCONTINUE MEDIA to us. I will give it a try to the similar spindle from Verbatim to see if I get the expected results since it is a newer model and is carry from USA base sellers.

0763644765|5.0|I can't even tell you how much we love this book!!  We love all of Patricelli's books, and so when it came to potty training I was thrilled to find this one.  The illustrations are simple and colorful, and the words are simple so it leaves room for talking about what we see.  I think it's adorable, and more importantly, it totally clicks for my 3 year-old son.  The first time I read it to him, he laughed hysterically at the line \\"Bye, bye diaper!\\"  When we started potty training officially a few days later, this became a bit of a mantra for us.  \\"Tinkle Tinkle Toot!\\" is also a favorite line.  We keep the book in the bathroom so I can pull it out if I think he's getting discouraged.  It always makes him laugh.  (He also thinks it's hilarious when the dog pees on the tree, and he informs me \\"Big boys don't pee on trees.\\"  I can't bring myself to correct him...)
B007N85ZXY|1.0|Neil once wrote a song called \\"piece of crap\\". Well, that song really defines this CD. The worst Neil Young CD ever, a real piece of crap. I gave it to Goodwill so I could deduct it from my taxes. I tried to sell it but no takers, even the Hobo on the island didn't want it. I was afraid Goodwill wouldn't take it neither.

030758836X|5.0|What I enjoyed most about Gone Girl were the plot twists and the character development.  The first part of the book had the characters, Nick and Amy, each telling their story, and as I'm reading, I find the contradictions between their stories curious, then a surprise comes in part 2 and from that point on, it was hard to put the book down.  The plot was well developed and there were just a few small parts that I thought were goofy, but overall I enjoyed this book greatly.  Several reviewers reported that they did not like the ending, but I did.  It wasn't an expected ending, and I found that to be fitting with the surprises throughout the book.  It is a good read!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I heard so much about these books so had to read them. The first book was ok but this book had me reading until I was done! Loved the electricity between the characters and enjoyed the ending. Great reads for women!
B005LAIGIM|4.0|Another comical movie by Eddie. It has a great plot, with a spend of mystery to it. This movie will keep you wondering what is the point but it's not until you almost reach the end of the movie that you understand the whole story.  It truely has a good plot and you will not get the plot until you see the whole movie.  Enjoyed it.  If you want to see some of his fast talking, and serious moments this is the movie.  I recommend it for a delightful yet serious side of Eddie as he take you on an adventure.  You want be disappointed.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This book is very detailed and a very good rea; I couldn't put it down. I would say not for young teenage children. The second of three books, makes you want to read the third.
B00008BLAS|3.0|Grand Funk had already dropped the (Railroad) from there name in 73 with Were an American Band. With 1974's Shinin'on they had 2 really good songs Shinin'on and The Loco motion. They seemed to be in a song writing Funk! With Phoenix,an All the Girls in the World Beware it never did get back to there abilities like the earlier LPs. They were good not as good as they used to be. It wasn't until 1976 with Good Play'in & Good Singing did they get there Funk back.By then a lot of there fan base left them. Only the die hard GFR fans stayed.Shinin'on is still a great LP just not a super one.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|The final book of the trilogy; what an awesome ending.  Can't say enough about the book.  I couldn't put the book down, a must read.

B005OJTVAW|3.0|Apparently no one gets the Kindle Keyboard anymore so I found it virtually impossible to find a case for mine. I decided to take a risk and get this case even thought it was meant for the Fire. It actually fits pretty well, the only issue I have with the fit is that the two bottom bands that hold it in completely cover the Shift key and part of the Back key, but it's not tight enough to press them while I'm using my Kindle. But since it wasn't meant for the Keyboard, I can't really complain about that.<br /><br />The case is sleek which was one of the main features I was looking for, and the lining is soft so it won't scratch the screen. I also love the vibrant pink the case comes in, it's what attracted me to it.<br /><br />But a problem I noticed upon receiving it, is that it doesn't look well made, not in the sense that I think it's going to fall apart, but in the sense that it looks like whoever made it wasn't paying that much attention. In one of the corners the lining wasn't sewn down completely (I just cut off the excess and sealed it with nail polish, hoping that'll keep it from fraying) and the end of one of the bands was a little fuzzy.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|Its not that bad but it gets super annoying sometimes!!!First of all it always pops something up about buying acorns or coins and my little bro bought something that cost $14.99 I got blamed and I'm really mad!

B00008BLB8|4.0|Yes, I had the vinyl version back in '75, and I kinda miss the intro backstage.  But other than that, the CD sounds just a great, if not better, than I remember it.<br /><br />This was GFR's second live album, a more mature band with an additional musician (Craig Frost) than on their 1970 release.  Souund technology had improved, and the band had joined into the mainstream of top 40 radio (both a good and a bad thing).  But one thing was for sure...Grand Funk had two recorded testimonies that they knwe how to put a live album together.<br /><br />The song order on the album is identical to the live performance, which starts off with a string of some of their finest songs.  From \\"Footstompin' Music\\" through \\"Heartbreaker\\", this is rock done in pure Grand Funk style.  And while the energy doesn't get lost with 'Some Kind of Wonderful', the overall feel of the song is that of Karaoke fodder.  \\"Shinin' On\\" fares a bit better, although it doesn't rank as one of their better songs.  Ironically, it's \\"The Locomotion\\" (again, not really a GFR gem, but it works here!) that sets the Railroad back on track (pun intented), where they continue to gain steam throughout the rest of the set.  (Personal preferences:  The Railroad, Inside Looking Out, Gimme Shelter).<br /><br />I saw the band twice live, including once on the tour which this was recorded.  Just listening to this CD puts me back in the old Civic Center one more time.  A great CD that has stood the test of time.
B0007OASII|5.0|As a schooled, trained musician I am really particular about the music I listen to or bands I will follow.  This group stands out and will not dissapoint the \\"complex taste\\".  For the rest of you, WOW WOW WOW!  This is a classical trained opera vocalist with a gothic, progressive, hard core metal band mixed with symphony orchestra musical arrangements.  Calling this \\"Prog rock\\" or metal does not do justice to the creative genious that is KAMELOT.  If you are unfamiliar or curious- Go 4 It.  At the very least you'll be introduced to a world of musical creativity unlike almost anything else out there. FYI- saw Kamelot live twice; In-F-n'-credible!!  I will soon own every release including the Live DVD performances.
B0031Y4A8U|5.0|The record was in perfect shape, with no scratch and outstanding sound quality, great packaging, if you like Black Sabbath on vinyl, this is a must buy option

B00023GFOA|5.0|It was a great experience to listen this album again on lp, it was great in all aspects, sound, packaging cover and no scratch.<br /><br />Make a time travel to 1970 and listen again this great record
B008KW43TE|5.0|I decided to purchase this MP3 on the urging of Amazon's recommendation and I have to say that I am glad that I did!  This album, had songs that stood out above the rest, so I have to say that it is fair to give my rating 5 stars.<br /><br />I got stuck on, \\"Super Rich Kids,\\" \\"Pyramids,\\" and \\"Pink Matter,\\" (Pink Matter because of my affinity to Andre 3000) and I have to say that these songs stay in constant rotation.<br /><br />My opinion?  People who are in touch with their sexuality, generally tend to be more open and free with their passions (i.e. music, writing, art)  There is nothing inhibiting them.  It's too bad it had to take on open letter to make others notice such a talent, which is always interesting to me (once someone is no longer considered \\"norm\\" people jump on it like it's a new toy)<br /><br />Frank Ocean should continue to make music, and not become a puppet to the masses (as others so often become)<br /><br />Kudos!<br /><br />Thanks for such a refreshing change...

0345803507|1.0|I can not believe this book made it to the top, it is just horrible and stupid. I was bored to tears and angry all the time about the stupid Ana and her abusive husband! The villain just make me want to laugh and never stop. The story is just lame, lame, lame. I am so glad I didn't buy this book ( one of my friends landed it to me) otherwise I will be banging my head on the wall.
B0000DZ3DR|5.0|For those who aren't familiar with Gene Clark he's probably best known as an original member of The Byrds back in the 1960s. The Byrds were a very influential band and Clark was one of the band's leading members; songs like Eight Miles High and Train Leaves Here This Morning (later a hit for Eagles) were Gene Clark compositions.<br /><br />Gene Clark left The Byrds to pursue a solo career but, for whatever reason(s), his solo career just didn't take off. As a solo act, Clark never achieved the success his talents deserved. He got heavily into booze and drugs and died early, at the age of 46.<br /><br />In the years before his death, Clark teamed up with Carla Olson (formerly of the Textones). This album with Carla Olson was the last studio album Gene Clark recorded before his death.<br /><br />The 1980s collaboration with Olson was good for Clark. This is one of the best albums Gene Clark ever recorded. This should be a 1980s classic but, unfortunately, it's not very well known.<br /><br />If you like bands like The Byrds and Eagles or performers like Jackson Browne, you might want to check out this little known gem. It's one of those great albums that few people know about.
0606259090|4.0|I hate BDMS erotica, but it was so much buzz about this book that a friend practically obliged me to read the book. I glad that I did. I personally liked it very much. I don't think is a great book. and I can not understand what is the buzz about this. But i found it just enough for read it in front of a swimming pool. I want to know what will happen next, so I will be buying the second book.
B002ZCY7SW|5.0|this is the only season we didn't get on DVD immediately prior to the next season starting (obviously, because it was the last season!) so we had to get it when we decided to re-watch the entire thing this summer. 24 went out better than we remembered, and we were happy with this set.
0345803493|2.0|The first book was fine, but this one it is just bad. The main character Christian is just and idiot and Ana is just  too weak. The plot is boring as the sex scenes. I regretted to have bought this book.
034580404X|5.0|The trilogy was very well written and entertaining to the last word. The characters and story were true to life.
B00004TDTO|1.0|Jaws might be one of my favorite films. Really, it's a masterpiece of story telling and as director Steven Spielberg often states, full of happy accidents. So when you see my 1 star review, what you need to understand is my review is not of the film, itself. It's of this edition.<br /><br />The sound mix in this film is awful. Remastered in 5.1 with new effects added. Effects that are just plain bad. Effects that sound like they were taken from free MP3 clips on the web bad. Poorly excuted, muting the effect of the intended scenes, screwing up or altering how well dialogue can be heard and just plain ruining the film. Avoid this DVD version at all costs.
0307352145|5.0|As a pastor, I talk and run into all sorts of people.  Some of them are loud people, and some of them are quiet people.  The official words are extrovert and introvert.  this book teaches us that intorverts or quiet people have a voice and a place in the world.<br />In a world and even in church where the loud and public ministries get noticed where do the intorverts belong?  According to Susan Cain, they belong right where they are at.  That is the way God made them!<br />I recommend this book for any introvert or ministry leader that deals with introverts that cannot find their place in the world full of loud people and things.<br />My only complaint, is it is very long.  It took me a while to read, but there was no fluff so I would still recommend it as is.<br />Read this book and serve God just like he created you to be!<br />I was given this book Free of Charge in exchange for an honest review from Waterbrook Multunomah Publishers.
B006JD48NM|5.0|This outstanding bio-pic about the life of three-times Formula One World Champion Ayrton Senna is an exemplary textbook study in documentary film-making. Regardless of whether or not you have any interest in motor racing or in Senna himself, this film really is one of the finest-ever examples of the genre you're ever likely to see.<br /><br />All F1 fans know that Senna (full name Ayrton Senna de Silva) died on 1st May 1994 following a fatal crash in the Italian Grand Prix at San Morino, the last driver (to date, August 2012) to die in a F1 racing accident. The film pieces together archive footage tracing early life and go-karting success, obsession with driving and winning and later days of international super-stardom of this most talented and fearless driver. His career-long rivalry with cool-as-ice French driver Alain Prost is revealed in a direct and no-holds barred narrative containing some astounding unguarded, off-the-record moments of interaction between these two individuals of contrasting (and clashing) temperaments.<br /><br />Senna's unique driving talent and personal modesty, the enormous impact his success had on popular sentiment in Brazil, his heartfelt religious convictions and the work and money he dedicated to the education of under-privileged children in his native land are all revealed. On the way we are shown rare peeks into confrontations at F1 pre-race drivers' meetings, and some of the F1 engineering innovations which made their way into mass-production vehicles - like traction control for example.<br /><br />Overall this is a gripping, well-paced film which holds the attention throughout with never a dull moment. The choice to forego a voiceover-narrator and allow the archive film to speak for itself makes the film's impact on the viewer  all the more powerful. Some of the driver's-eye-from-the-car camera-work during F1 races is genuinely edge-of-the-seat terrifying, and allows you to appreciate just what phenomenal speeds were and are involved.<br /><br />If you appreciate good film-making with fine editing, regardless of the subject matter, you really should see this. If you are a student of film or aspiring film-maker then seeing and studying `Senna' - several times, not just once - is a must, and if you're a F1 fan you are gonna love it.<br /><br />Five stars for excellence.lved.<br /><br />If you appreciate good film-making with fine editing, regardless of the subject matter, you really should see this.

B008ODZEQ0|5.0|I watch a lot of documentaries, and this is one of the better ones. Everything comes together in this one. The subject is unique and the life lessons are profound. The cinematography is great, and there are interesting editing techniques and music that keep in interesting.
B007P3S1AQ|5.0|This movie was great. It captures the 911 incident from the perspective of the child who's father dies in the twin tower terror. It's gripping, exciting and heart breaking all at once. It shows the confusion, shock and denial of the incident, but then shows the acceptance. I would buy this movie for the simple reason of owning a film that gives the true sense and feelings of what it was like during the 911 attack back on the home front.

B007OLYQ4E|5.0|This might be hard to believe, but I had never read anything by Capote. I was stunned at how beautifully he writes, and was moved to tears at times. Even if the plots were no good, the writing would still be compelling. The last story, A Christmas Memory, is one of the most beautiful stories I have ever read, told with so much feeling it puts you there. The price of this entire volume is worth it just for this story, but the others are great, too.
034580404X|1.0|I really mean what I wrote in the title. Yes maybe you would want to read the first book, but dont bother reading further. I read all genre of books. The book should be able to hold the reader, create interest.. but I am really sad to say this book does niether.. all it does is repetition. I somehow always knew what Mr & Mrs Grey would do or say next :) !! Yes it was that easy, because all they do is makeout, roll eyes or smirk!!! I borrowed it from a friend after hearing so much about this book. After the 1st book I directly read Book 3 and trust me I did not miss anything. Dissapointment after so much hype surrounding this book. Glad I did not invest my money on it!

0545265355|5.0|Amazing trilogy! Keeps you wanting to read more until you actually reach the end.<br /><Spoiler Alert > - stop reading this review if you haven;t yet read the book! I somehow felt that towards the end the author kind of simply forgot to give Gale his due.. he was easily forgotten and left out. the book that Peeta and Katniss work on .. Gale was not even mentioned ..why? He had in his own way helped Katniss through-out! and sincerely I wish there was a different ending, that she would end up with Gale .... I simply loved his character :). No offense to Peeta though.. but I liked Gale more :) ..<br />But oh well that is how the author wanted it and so be it!!

B002R27J1W|5.0|Adapted from a play for the screen, Wait Until Dark (1967) is highly effective suspense thriller, that owes much of its success to a solid story, a quick pace, and some very strong acting performances.  Most of the film takes place in a basement apartment in New York City, where a blind woman played by Audrey Hepburn ([[ASIN:B006TTC5WC Charade]], [[ASIN:B001UHOWW4 Breakfast at Tiffany's]])  becomes involved in a web of intrigue, surrounding a shipment of drugs.  She will need to draw upon all her wits and strength to survive a night of sheer terror.  Some spoilers follow.<br /><br />Afraid that it will be stolen, a woman smuggling a doll stuffed with heroin on a flight from Canada into New York, passes the doll to a stranger, Sam Hendrix (Efrem Zimbalist Jr.) a photographer.  Hendrix takes the doll home to his apartment, where he lives with his wife Suzy (Hepburn), who is blind.<br /><br />A criminal named Harry Roat (Alan Arkin), gets conmen Mike Talman (Richard Crenna) and Carlino (Jack Weston) involved in an elaborate scheme to try and trick Suzy into giving them doll.  The criminals first get Sam out of the way, and then Talman moves in pretending to be an old army buddy.  Carlino plays a cop investigating a murder, while Roat plays a variety of characters.  With Sam gone, Suzy's only ally is Gloria (Julie Herrod), a teenage girl who lives upstairs.<br /><br />Audrey Hepburn's performance is simply marvelous, ranging from bubbly and full of emotion to absolute terror.  Suzy is remarkably capable and intelligent, and Hepburn is very convincing playing a person unable to see.  When things turn dark and dangerous, Hepburn makes you feel the chill of Suzy's fear and panic, with Henry Mancini's fantastic score also contributing to heightening the drama.<br /><br />Alan Arkin (Inspector Clouseau, Catch 22) may have been known for quirky comedic roles, and while he displays some comedic talent in one of his various guises, he is truly chilling playing a ruthless criminal.  Richard Crenna's performance is so good that even though you know Mike is a bad guy, you wish he wasn't.  Jack Weston ([[ASIN:B007VFF7JQ Incredible Mr. Limpet]]) might be more familiar in lighter roles often playing the loyal friend.  Going a bit against type, Weston doesn't quite fit as a heavy, but is still fun to watch.  Although Gloria starts out as a bratty kid, she becomes a key character later.  Julie Herrod's performance may not be the most polished, but it adds a certain sense of realism to the drama.  Efrem Zimbalist Jr. isn't in the film very much, but is a steady presence when he is.<br /><br />Although some elements from the play may not translate seamlessly to the film adaptation, the story holds together well and flows nicely, under the direction of Terence Young ([[ASIN:B001AQO3U6 Dr. No]], [[ASIN:B001AQO3WO From Russia with Love]], [[ASIN:B001AQO45K Thunderball]]).  From early on, it is clear that Suzy is very vulnerable and in danger.  This situation, along with Audrey Hepburn's animated performance, draws your attention to Suzy, and the superior performances of the rest of the cast, make the world inside the apartment seem real and intimate.  Even if you are familiar with the story, Wait Until Dark still remains very compelling and suspenseful.  There are some issues, but it's easy to ignore them and just enjoy this great thriller.al.

0439023521|5.0|I was lent this book and was told it had a teen genre to it. I gave it a read anyhow and was glad I did.<br /><br />I was pleasantly surprised, with the riveting story of a future which is dark, sad, and bleak. The great continent of North America is no more. Instead we have the country of Panem, 12 districts and the Capitol City. In district 12, which is in the former Appalachian region of coal mining we have the story of a girl becoming a woman in the most harsh of circumstances.<br />She lives in a future where 2 young contestants from each district are chosen annually for a fight to the death in the Hunger Games of Capitol City. The games are televised & there is but one winner.  Katniss is our protagonist here. She volunteers to take her younger sister's place at the Games.<br /><br />With one victor, one would think the plot pretty much cut and dried, as in the old Gladiator days of yore. We all make choices in our lives, this young woman is compelled to choose in a world gone mad. Government has decided that these barbaric games take place to keep an already down-trodden populace in their place and under the government's thumb. Nicely written, a page turner is how I felt about this novel. It had been loaned to my Kindle from a friend. No question it has a teen slant being told from the young lady's perspective in her own narration. Young love is involved in the storyline as well. Or is it? Being pretty far removed from my teen years, I enjoyed this novel thoroughly and have bought the next 2 installments of the trilogy. It's not just for young people at all. Ms. Collins has seen to that very well.<br /><br />This idea has been tried many times before in novel and movie form. This version from Ms. Collins shines brightly.

B0086700CM|4.0|I had this 3-month-plan to get the longest distance run. Basically I get all the multipliers, buy a mega boost, and stack on wings. Well today was the day where I was supposed to beat the record. It went off to an excellent start. I was using my wings, I kept hitting the boost power up, the whole nine yards! Well I hit another boost power up at around 8.5k meters and I was springing right? Well somehow I crashed and the game ended my spree!!! Fix the glitch. Then we'll talk about a five star.

While the author is not by any stretch a truely good writer, once you accepted this the story flowed well and it was easy for me to get caught up in it.  I really like it, read all 3 books within the month.  Worth the read if you need some spice in your life.

0345803485|1.0|I picked up this series because I kept hearing friends rave what a great book it was - riveting, life changing even.  A book you can't put down once you start it.  I was told Christian Grey was so amazing, no man would ever be worthy after reading this book. Now after reading 80% of book 1, I'm not sure what is more shocking - the fact that this book became a New York Times Best Seller or that my friends actually enjoyed this trash.<br /><br />Let me breakdown my issues:<br /><br />1. The unrealistic story line. I read a lot of Romance Novels, so the farfetched plot doesn't usually bother me.  In fact, I generally enjoy the escape from reality.  In 50 Shades, the story line was so riduculously unbelievable, it was embarrassing.  Are we really supposed to believe that the heroine, a 22 year old virgin, who has never even masturbated, would be propositioned by a man with a \\"red room of pain\\" and not run for the hills?  And don't even get me started on the idea of an arrogant, pompous 27 year old billionaire pursuing a college student.  And what college student on the planet doesn't have an email account in 2011?<br /><br />2. The writing.  Oh God, the writing!  I really thought the book was written by a sixteen year old with a fantasy about saving a bad boy crush.  I don't blame the author - I think the editor and publisher were asleep on the job during the screening of this atrocity.  The repetition is nauseating (oh my, jeez, double crap).  And WTF is up with the \\"inner goddess\\" and \\"sub conscious\\" bs?  I really want to send E.L. James a Thesaurus.<br /><br />3. The characters.  Anastasia was self deprecating and dull.  There really wasn't much to her besides her obsession with Christian.  Christian was arrogant ass whose actions towards Ana were two steps away from stalker.  And what's up with his long fingers?  It was mentioned so many time, I began envisioning his fingers as circus, freak show long.<br />4.  The sex scenes.  Personally I'm not into BSDM, so the sex scenes were a complete turnoff.  I actually found them to more about violence and control than sensual.<br /><br />I realize everything I have said here is nothing that has not already been written on the reviews (which were more entertaining than this book), however I felt compelled to write a review to forewarn anyone considering reading 50 shades of crap.....if you are hesitant to read this book, listen to your \\"inner goddess\\" and pick something else.
B008OOYALE|5.0|I love this game it is really fun I don't know what you guys are thinking this game rocks!!!! (:
B007SGM084|5.0|AMAZING!!!  Cannot put it down!!! Great story line with interesting characters and great sex!!! This author needs to keep writing!!!
B00846REIS|4.0|If I had read this book before I read 50 Shades I would have liked it better.  It's 50 without the bondage.  Exact same plot, exact same people with different names.  Location is changed.  Controlling man.  Woman not quite as independent as 50 Shades woman, but close.  Waaaaaay too much sex even though I like that in a book.  Kind of boring sex - not like 50 where it was changed up a bit.  Other than that, I finished in one day and will probably read the second.
B006YB9VJU|4.0|I bought these to try out using NFC.  These tags are already encoded with Sony-specific commands.  Those commands don't translate on other phones.  I have used them with both Sony phones and the Galaxy Nexus.  In order to use them with the Galaxy nexus, I used a program called NFC Task Launcher.  I was able to re-write the tags so that they could be used with my other phone.  The only problem is that it doesn't appear that they can be used by the Sony phone now.  At least not without using the aforementioned program.  Anyway, these can be used to quickly automate functions on your phone with a quick swipe.  Like have one in you car that once swiped will turn on Bluetooth, turn off Wifi, and start your navigation program.  There are tons of possibilities.

B004RJMUJO|3.0|When I got it I loved it. Then 9 to 8 mounths later it got a little boring. So I stopped playing it. 1 week later I forgot about it. Then I saw it at the app store and remembered about it. I fought about taking it off my kindle. So I did. Then from now on I have nothing to do with this app.
0345803507|3.0|Yes - I am one \\"of those\\" who bought into all the hype of the 50 Shades Trilogy. I heard about it at work, in the media and on a popular radio show I listen to. I finally decided I needed to see what it was all about. After reading the first two I needed to see how it ended. I wasn't in love with the books but after you read the first two you feel the need to wrap it all up. The characters, especially Christian are interesting. (Ana is likable but sometimes she comes across as a bit of a brat.)<br /><br />Anyway the last book we see them married and dealing with their new life and Ana trying to find her way. She is young and learning to find herself in the world and Christian is trying to adapt to letting go of control along with his many other issues. Yes there is sex, sex and more sex. It get monotonous at times and all the kinky stuff that you hear about is pretty much non-existent in the last book. There is a little sprinkled here and there but in the words of Christian it is pretty vanilla!<br /><br />I really think that the story itself is a good one. If the books were better edited and neatened up a bit I do think it could have been a very decent series. The issues they faced and the love story are good. It is the repetition of the sentences and the same expressions and words used over and over and over that drive you crazy. Even the sex was written the same. I skimmed over it a few times as it was a been there read that already. I can't even count how many times I read of fisting his hair, stop biting your lip, eat, did you eat, nuzzling her jaw, running his nose down her nose, and endless baths! Oh and I forgot the topper....little blip!<br /><br />Anyway - It was not the worst series or book I ever read. Overall a good distraction or a nice beach read.<br /><br />The actual best part was the end where she wrote a bit about Christian and Ana's first meeting from his point of view. It was actually really good and I bet if she wrote the series from his perspective it would be a decent read. (If it was properly edited that is!)

Plus I very much enjoy the fact that it is shipped right to my door and I do not have to go out in the stores and compare prices, because I have yet to find one at a better price.  Patience will pay off with the dvd collection of new releases  and the same goes for e books and regular books, Amazons price has never been beaten on anything I've searched for.
0439023491|5.0|The Hunger Games series is a great way to escape into another world, and Catching Fire, the 2nd book in the series, continues the fantasy.  I truly enjoyed this story, and couldn't wait to read the final book of the 3-part series.
B004Q3QRWC|5.0|A Visit from the Good Squad is a novel that reads like a collection of short stories. The narrative of the stories is loosely connected by a pool of characters that span the 60s to somewhere in the near future. What is brilliant about this book for me is the way it approximates real life in the way everyone is a main character of his or her own story.<br /><br />Characters who appear as the main character in one story emerges as a supporting one in another and it is with a start sometimes when you encounter the same character years later and he or she is almost unrecognizable, like the young rakish rock musician who ends up old and forgotten. The ravages of time is a central theme in these narratives just as Bennie, a music producer and failed guitarist himself, tries to persuade his old friend and never-made-it rock star Scott to take the stage: \\"You gonna let that goon push you around?\\", and Scott answers \\"The goon won\\".<br /><br />These characters are all terribly flawed: a kleptomaniac who steals indiscriminately from her dates and plumber, a journalist who sexually assaults a young female actress during an interview, a disgraced publicist who works for a dictator against her better conscience, and a professor who is sent to Italy to look for a missing teenage niece, but is more interested in visiting art museums and escape from his home responsibilities on the funds given by his sister and husband, are just some of them. However with Egan's sympathetic brushstrokes, they inevitably find that moment of grace, which is sometimes all that is needed to turn things around. Even if things never do, like for the suicidal character who drowns, we learn not to make snap judgements about people and the decisions they make.
B00338QENI|5.0|Great read! It was an adventure and a welcomed learning experience.  The author did a great job of familiarizing the reader with each character as well as the science of cells.
B003O86FMW|4.0|Just when you think things might get a little easier in the life of Katniss... This book takes you on the twists and turns of a girl who accidentally became the face of revolution.  As a young girl shows her strengths and weaknesses during what is essentially the harshest reality one could know, Suzanne Collins takes us along for the ride.  We find that for every decision made, there is a cost.<br />A good teen read, and made me download book #3.
0739352989|5.0|I loved this story with all the characters triumphs and tortures. But my first major problem was the voice of the narrator. As a fan of audio books, I have listened to many different voices do the narration of audio books. The most important thing to me is having distinct tones & dialect for the different characters. Have several female & male tones to separate the characters, especially male & female tones, but Becca Battoe has no male tones. Therefore I felt like I was just listening to a female read the story. She may be ok at acting out the story line, but she shouldn't be a narrator because she can't change her vocal tones enough to do male voices.<br /> At first I didn't know if I would make it through the first book. As a strong woman I found it hard to get through all the stuff a submissive is supposed to do, and I kept getting to angry, that this girl was willing to try it. But I'm so glad I kept going to get to a great love story full of ups and downs.<br />I really enjoyed this trilogy and would definitely recommend it to my friends.
0812993292|5.0|I started out thinking Harold Fry had little chance of moving me.  But he did.<br /><br />The story was interesting.  The background story worked toward a very satisfying conclusion.  But the real story here is the journey of discovery by Harold and his wife Maureen.  What they learn about themselves during this unlikely pilgrimage is the true story.<br /><br />What is important?  How are we forever changed by past choices?  Most of all, is our paradigm, our personal road map of life, a representation of the real world?  Harold and Maureen look at what we know to be true but may have forgotten.<br /><br />The writing is great.  The story is engaging.  The message is powerful.  What more could you want in a 250-300 page book?
B0067TGSOK|3.0|Well I am disappointed in this book. As a top selling book, I was expecting perhaps too much.<br /><br />First I would say the target audience of this book are probably those people who never ever read any other book on business, or never even thought about starting a business. Almost every advice is very basic.<br /><br />When I read author had interviewed so many businesses, I was hoping he would have included more \\"technical\\" details about them. For example, the photographer in Spain, how she was advertised, how much she invested in her gear, did she take any classes, how she hires assistants, if any etc. Or coffee shop guy, how did he get money for coffee shop, how many hours he works at coffee shop, how did he gain experience for running it etc (I am pretty sure starting a coffee shop is not exactly $100 startup).<br /><br />Or that single mom who became marketing consultant, exactly how did she land her first client? How did she dress, and gained their respect? How did she learn about marketing? How did she convince companies that she was a real deal not a joke? (At our company, we had experiences with so-called Social Media Marketing experts. It seems most of them just know how to update their Facebook statuses or send a twitter update.)<br /><br />For good parts, the book is easy to read. It will inspire many people to do what they enjoy. It does provide a starting point. It repeats general knowledge but it is good to have all that knowledge in one place.<br /><br />In the end, don't expect anything revolutionary from this book. In my opinion, if you are already inspired to do your own thing then try to find a book on that thing. If you want to start a photography business then you might be better served by a book on starting photography business than this book.
1416972242|5.0|An improvement over City of Bones which I did give 4 stars.<br /><br />There were some plot tweaks that I would have preferred, but this series has books to go so nothing's written in stone yet.<br /><br />There's drama, conflict, miscommunication, and more than one single-thread plot going on. All things I like.
B0083H6AQA|5.0|This was a spectacular movie, the costumes were lovely, the acting was excellent and Robert Pattinson is fantastic. He played Georges as he was written, able to convey so many emotions through facial expressions.. Great chemistry between Rob and the three women, especially Christina Ricci, Uma Thurman was his match although he one-upped her when he got the chance, and poor Kristen Scott Thomas, he nearly destroyed her, all a part of his climb that left Christina with unrequited love by the time he was done with them. Interesting story that almost makes you feel sorry for him at times.....almost. I highly recommend this movie, even is you are not an R-Patz fan,and oh, the music score is worth purchasing separately, a lovely classic style of melodies that grows on you!

B0080BFWAE|5.0|Adventures in Babysitting is one of the best 80's comedies, no arguments there. Elisabeth Shue delivers a truly enjoyable & infectious performance while also looking gorgeous throughout. I honestly don't know if she's ever been prettier than she was in this film. Chris Columbus'  direction is very energetic and well done and the script by David Simkins is smart and just self aware enough at appropriate points. The rest of the cast is also a great deal of fun. If you for some reason haven't seen this particular film, what are you waiting for?<br /><br />My main purpose for this review is the new so called \\"25th Anniversary Edition\\" blu ray that highly disappoints. First of all, THE BLU RAY IS BARE BONES! How can something be labled a special edition of some sort and then have no extras whatsoever?! The film is presented in its original theatrical aspect ratio of 1.85:1 in hi-definition anamorphic widescreen. While it does look better than the ancient DVD, the movie has a really washed out look to it for the most part and detail doesn't seem to pop at all like it could and should. I would say that the visual improvement is marginal at best most of the time. There are some moments here and there where it does feel that you're watching high definition. The movie maintains a high bit rate throughout but it's very apparent that Disney took whatever hi-def master they had laying around and just slapped it on the disc. If you don't own the old DVD, then this is the best way to see the film. But the complete lack of extras is absolutely criminal. If they were going to go that route than they shouldn't have put \\"25th anniversary edition\\" on the front of the case. I would have loved a Chris Columbus & Elisabeth Shue commentary track at least. The audio is in lossless 5.1 surround.<br /><br />So a resounding yay for this classic bit of 80's comedy and a big nay for the blu-ray!
0425263908|5.0|I immediately noticed the comparison to FSoG, Rich young screwed up EXTREMELY handsome man and Beautiful young woman...with a name of EVA, sounds a lot like ANA...who falls in front of this very rich man, and he immediately wants to bed her.  Bed, car, etc. scenes are very graphic, but it just helps to paint the picture, so if you can't stand reality, this isn't for you.<br />I am intrigued, and want to read the next installment coming out this fall.  Those that can do...<br />Those that can't read about it.
B003XRELEI|5.0|This is odd. It is filled with strange characters, and tongue in cheek observations. Written in short snappy sentences, it is on the surface a very easy book to read. I found it funny, almost cartoon like in its depiction of Trout and Dwayne's journey to their meeting. It is not really about much but is full of anecdotes on the characters lives. People are mostly described in terms of robot machines, their reactions programmed by their creator. It is hard really to convey a feeling for what exactly this is. I never read any by this author before and initially thought it might be science fiction as the narrator describes elements of the ordinary, such as flags and storks etc., as if the reader inhabits a world different from earth which might be no more. Also there is an equally strange departure into describing penis and bust dimensions in character descriptions about half way through. I loved the tongue in cheek style, the amusing bites of satire and the general air of insanity. Well worth a wander though, this is a book which will make me chuckle to myself as I remember bits.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|An insane roller coaster ride...but instead of vomitting and falling on the ground when it's over, you'll discover that you want to get back on and do it again. That is how I feel about this book.<br /><br />I will never look at a Pigeon again without thinking of Abby and Travis.<br /><br />This book is violent, has sexual content as well as a super unhealthy romantic relationship based on extreme possessiveness and insecurities. Not to be read like a script to be followed in real life. Get over it.<br />Recommended to readers 17+
B000O8OTNC|5.0|A handsome little sharpener with the welcome added feature of a rod for sharpening grooves in a serrated blade.  Contours in the grip make it comfortable to use.
B008OOYALE|5.0|Ive been waiting for this game to be available for my kindle as I have it on my iphone! I loved pet story but didn't like how I litterally had to buy diamonds to have some pets...but with this game you can breed the dragons to get other dragons instead of spending money on gold to buy them! I love that...the hardest part is waiting for my new eggs to hatch! I do wish I could have more evolution temples and breeding dens...but maybe in higher levels you can purchase a second. either way the game has given me hours of fun hus far and I'm very excited to now play on my kindle as well as iphone.
B0018RWMNM|5.0|Poor as the video transfer is of this series, the whole production is deeply moving. If you watch it once, you'll return to it again and again. I would snap up the Blu-ray version in an instant except that it does not contain the entire program. Something this good deserves to be on two high-definition discs. Not one frame should have been omitted. The music, which is gorgeous and seems to be of the period, supports the grand emotions without ever being intrusive. Buy the two-disc DVD and enjoy.
B003L77G10|5.0|Fast shipment. Discs nicely protected in plastic sleeve and easy to remove. Not a single scratch on any one of the discs. I'm very happy with my purchase.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|I have seen this item around for awhile and finally decided to try it.  I have used several sharpening tools for the dozens of pocket and fixed blade knives I own.  I have the Lansky system and a simpler version of same, several pocket rods and a few stones.  My review is that this item works to keep that razor like edge that you knife came with out of the box. It is a one tool for all basic sharpening needs and the ceramic honing works very well. The Lansky is still the best IMO.  But for simplicity, speed, ease of use, portability and price it works great...happy to have one and will send one out as a gift to many friends
B005HKSSLQ|5.0|A truly wonderful movie, one that can be enjoyed over and over again. \\"Something Borrowed\\" is filled with warmth, humor, romance and heartache, everything a great movie needs. It has a wonderful storyline with the perfect cast. \\"Something Borrowed\\" should be on everyone's \\"Must see list!\\"
B007J4T2G8|5.0|You are either going to LOVE this book or hate it!  It was a great read - I have read it twice.  I got others in my office to read the book too..some that say they don't like to read, now are interested in reading other books.  The BDSM isn't too bad and it really is a love story too!  You really get invested into the characters and want to know what happens next.  Have some fun reading the books!
B005K2XM94|5.0|I ordered this with a bit of misgivings seeing that it was made for the Kindle Fire.  I have a Kindle Fire and a Nexus 7. The Kindle Fire is thicker, so I was wondering how good the fit would be.  Well, the Fire is thicker, but the Nexus is a hair longer.  The net result is that the fit is perfect.<br /><br />Could there be more padding?  Maybe, but I wouldn't want it.  More padding means thicker.  I might be concerned if I needed to use my Nexus 7 as a frizbee, but for normal use, carrying the Nexus 7 around in a briefcase, suitcase, or backpack, it seems just right.<br /><br />Anyone who wants plush and memory foam might consider [[ASIN:B005K2Y446 Timbuk2 Kindle Fire Plush Sleeve with Memory Foam for impact absorption, Grey/Lime]]
0312641893|4.0|I have to admit that I was uncertain about this book going in. Now, I absolutely *love* cyborgs and have wished to BE a cyborg for many years. So naturally, the cyborg part of this story intrigued me, but the idea of people living on the moon made me raise an eyebrow.<br /><br />Folks... I should not have doubted this book for a second. The moment I met Cinder, I was hooked so hard. She's a *cyborg* and she's an awesome mechanic and she's got such a great attitude! Despite the poor treatment from her foster family and general discrimination against cyborgs, Cinder perseveres and just does her own thing. Together with her sidekick, the android Iko (who is hilarious and adorable), she decides to create her own future and escape the oppression.<br /><br />Each character in this book (Cinder, Iko, Prince Kai, the doctor) comes to life so vividly that I often felt like I was watching an anime while reading! Marissa Meyer's writing style is so full of charm and wit that I'm pretty sure I was grinning through most of the pages. Remember those Lunar people I was unsure about? Dude. They came through in a very interesting, creepy, and great way. The Lunar Queen is so evil that I just can't wait to see how she gets taken down. Every character is awesome to read about.<br /><br />My favorite thing about this book is that the world came alive so incredibly well. I read in a recent interview with Meyer that she spent a lot of time re-watching Firefly to try to get the world of The Lunar Chronicles to have the same feel. I'm telling you - she nailed it. Basically, I want to live in Cinder's world. And I want to be Cinder's best friend.
B0088TG252|1.0|Careful.  This is the first time I have had this problem.. he sound quality was so poor that I couldn't follow everything that was going on.
B004UID2LC|5.0|The app is great. You don't even need the Internet.........you can just see the video or download it. If you see it the one you downloaded then it has no BUFFINING one it. I reccmend this app to anyone. Enjoy your app.  :)
B0014VQGX4|4.0|This is the favorite toy of my truck-crazy 20-month-old. If you read the description then there will be no surprises. The only problem we have is that one of the stabilizers doesn't lock into place - it's supposed to, it's just broken from day 1, essentially - and so always hangs down. Ultimately a minor issue (for us).
B008MEM24S|1.0|you can buy where's my water which is so much better. it it a little easier to understand than physics and ray guns. in where's my water its just water and poison or wat ever it is.  they just made it a Perry version. DO NOT BUY!!! BUY WHERES MY WATER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
0345803485|1.0|I can't believe I spent money on this crap book!!  I want my money and time back!!!  I want to slap my friend for recommending this to me!
B008GXHOFW|5.0|great game I loved the graphics and the ease of use. the missions were awesome. the last mission was the hardest.
B000AJIF4E|5.0|I used to own the MDR-V600 headphones, after they wore out I decided to upgrade to the MDR7506, The sound is so much better so is the ear pads.<br />The design is different from what it was a couple of years ago. The headphones feels solid, but fragile at the same time.<br />Still love them!
0812982622|2.0|I have a real interest in North Korea.  I lived in South Korea for 2 years and so that sparked my interest.  Ever since then I have watched and read a lot about North Korea.  The author, I'm sure, knows more than me on the country- and so I won't fault him for that at all.  There seemed to have been a lot of research put into this book.  Great work there.  Anyways- I thought the book was kind of hard to read- maybe I'm just stupid.  It seemed long and drawn out to me.  It was sometimes hard to follow because the point of view was being changed up on a regular basis.  Towards the end of the book I was more or less just reading it to finish it.  I would probably not recommend this book to a friend.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|I enjoy playing great stress relievers realistic goals cute scenarios.  well thought out game reminds of the original Pc game.  great for nostalgia.
B004I744AS|5.0|When I first got my Kindle fire I bought a dictionary from the Kindle bookstore but let me tell u when I ran across this dictionary in the app store &amp; bought it I've come 2 realize that this little dictionary is everything a dictionary should b.  I give it a high five.
B008AFQ8C6|5.0|This is one of the best books that I have ever read! So full of emotions. I  Love It!! Can't wait to read the second part of the story!
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|the game is fun and challenging. It has ads but they don't get in the way whereas playing the same game on my LG phone they block your view.
B007IXWKUK|3.0|The love story is intriguing, but the writing is juvenile. The main character is constant debate over whether she likes/loves/can handle/not handle the relationship. I found myself skipping the banal inner dialogue she has with herself after the first 4 or 5 times she has it. The sex scenes are quite shocking to the senses initially, especially book 1, but by book 2 and 3, seem surprisingly normal. I equate the level of writing to those books I read in Junior High--entertaining, but certainly no awards to be won.
B001K3JF7K|1.0|There was a time when every jazz fan in America dreamed of slathering Diana Krall in chocolate sauce and . . . enjoying a stimulating time around the piano. Unfortunately, the person who actually got to do this was arranger Claus Ogerman, and instead of high-octane chocolate sauce he used cut-rate marshmallow fluff. On QUIET NIGHTS Diana's piano, quartet, and voice are swamped in strings and schmaltz. She is complicit in this unctuous olio, having now reached Monroe-esque levels of breathiness in her ersatz cooings. I say these things more in sorrow than in anger. Luckily, I checked out a library copy of QUIET NIGHTS before deciding to purchase the album . . . not. Guess I'll just have to settle for a bitter chocolate sundae while I listen to the great \\"before\\" Diana of yesteryear and dream about what might have been.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|Like many of the other reviewers, I couldn't put these books down. I thoroughly enjoyed the story and wanted more, more, more! Many are saying that it was unrealistic. We do not read fiction for realism! One person said that the books try to make the BDSM lifestyle \\"acceptable\\". It IS acceptable to those who want to live that way. If you don't like it, don't take part in it and don't read about it. But don't tell others what is or is not acceptable.<br /><br />There were a few words and phrases that I felt were used a bit too often. The books were rather short to be sold as a trilogy, a little expensive that way. I would have liked to see the ending written with more detail about Christian and Anastasia's life at that point. It seemed to be too neatly and quickly wrapped up.
B000FA5STS|5.0|AS always David baldacci does not dissapoint. I look forward to reading or listening to all of his books. Especially like the Camel Club series.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|this really gets my brain working! I hav a ton of plain addicting games on my kindle but this is a break from routine:) its fun and still addictive as well!
030758836X|4.0|After reading a review on shelfari some months ago, I finally thought I'd give this a whirl. I downloaded a sample on my kindle 'cause it said somewhere that it was a thriller and I didn't think I was in the mood for a thriller right now. Who cares what I was in the mood for? Because less than 10 minutes after I had downloaded the sample, I had purchased the book and was reading it with mounting heart palpitations.<br /><br />Nick & Amy have been married for 5 years, and they'd had their ups and downs, more downs in the past 2 recent years since their move from New York to Missouri to be closer to Nick's dying mother. On their 5th year anniversary, Amy disappears from their home amidst what appears to have been a struggle/crime scene. As the police & Nick try to make sense of what happened, they find the anniversary clues Amy always leaves for Nick on their day, hidden in special parts of town. Nick tries to unravel those clues, but without Amy's help this time and he thinks he can see a new side of her as he goes on his treasure hunt.<br /><br />The book moves between Nick's point of view, and past entries of Amy's diary leading to the present. After every entry you begin to see things in a different perspective, and as soon as that happens, Flynn gives you just enough details for you to completely skew your view of things.<br /><br />I felt sorry for Amy. I loved Amy. I hated Amy. I felt sorry for Nick. I loved Nick. I hated Nick. There's quite a bit of emotions in this book, in a sense that you really can't make up your mind on whose side you're on.<br /><br />**SPOILER ALERT**<br /><br />I did NOT like the ending. No, I don't want to guess what could happen, I want something clear cut. So yes, that's what I'm going to pretend happened.<br /><br />**END OF SPOILER**
034580404X|5.0|A relative of mine told me about these books so I decided to save money and order the trilogy online.  They arrived in perfect condition, still in the plastic.  Thank you so much.
B003YNFYD8|5.0|Great as ever and sounds better than my old vinyl copy. It's the Beatles that our<br />generation grew up with. Only wish that they had issued it in a hard CD case.<br />Perhaps they wanted us to recall the feel of the original vinyl record slipcover.<br />Still, it's a nice upgrade.
B004GYY714|5.0|I use this app every day. This is a must have, the stations are too numerous to mention. There are even show clips from some of your favorite radio shows.You can preset your favs.There are international stations also.
B004P8JPS6|2.0|I really hate giving a Jack Reacher book a 2...but this book earned it.  This story was horribly boring.  I thought it would be epic to hear how Reacher started his hitch hiking career...but it was bland, senseless, and a complete let-down.  There were a couple of one liners in there that made me laugh and increased his awesome character...but it wasn't good enough for me to give it a 3.  The end of the book was rushed too.  If I had not read other Reacher books I would never pick up another Lee Child book again after this one.  Slow down Lee!  Take your time writing an epic story instead of pushing out crap.  Reading Trip Wire next and hoping that redeems this trashy read.  This book shouldn't have been called the Affair and a more appropriate title would've been \\"The Waste\\" because that's what it was.
B005LAIGYQ|5.0|This movie was very good...and also very humbling.  The job these soldiers do isn't exactly easy, and it often comes with sacrifices, but these men gladly do it in the name of freedom and to protect the American people, and for that they are deserving of the utmost respect.  The acting was overall pretty good, and although much of the cast were the actual soldiers involved and not trained actors...they were actually did very well I thought.  This movie is so much more than an action movie...it's based off of actual events and it is at times very emotional, especially in the end.  (I don't want to say too much for those who have not seen it).  All in all though, this movie is highly worthwhile.  I will probably be adding this to my Blu-Ray collection before too long.  Check it out folks!
B004I8WD6E|2.0|I've had this case for about 6 months. While i may have dropped the phone 2 -3 times the case offered good protection to the phone.<br /><br />Cons<br />1. Doesn't look gr8 aesthetics - isint iPhone mostly about its sexy look.<br />2. The cover initially was transparent whitish but eventually turned a lil yellowish<br />3. Recently i took the phone out of the case only to find the phone had circular permanent marks on the phone's back side. these correspond to the circular marking on the cover - I'm shocked and hence the low rating
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I enjoy the game it keeps me busy, wish it was more challengeing but it was good<br />nothing else to say
B0053O8AQE|5.0|At times the humor..or lack thereof..is a bit daunting, but all in all this is a delightful show. Love all the characters.<br /><br />Not sure why they felt the need get rid of Kat Dennings love interest. Johnny was cute, funny and their chemistry was fabulous. Then to \\"marry him off\\" was unthinkable. Peach's character is hilarious...and so they get rid of her too?  What gives?  Bringing in the upstairs Polish Princess neighbor was OK for a few episodes, but now they seem to be giving her WAY too big a piece of the show. The writers need to re-focus on the girls.<br /><br />The writing is a bit off at times, but this show is worth watching.<br /><br />It's light, funny and is a great way to kill a half hour.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Downloaded the game cause it was free and discovered I really like it. Plus they just added a bonus pack
B008MEM24S|5.0|This game is just like where's my water so... JUST GET WHERES MY WATER FREE IF YOU DONT WANNA PAYY
0345803485|5.0|Great series.  Simply written and the story line just sucks you in... literally. Kept hearing about the books from friends/co-workers, so I finally gave in, and boy am i glad I did.
B000OJFV3S|1.0|Yea, this and Romney will ingratiate us with our friends...Yea, this and Romney will ingratiate us with our friends...there is that enough words?<br /><br />Edit: Bad acting - oh my god can't they find an actor that can actually sit a horse? Whenever they get on a horse it reminds me of those cartoons when I was a kid where the character was out of sink - the horse goes down the rider goes up - a jarring tribute to those who were raised in the saddle. I'm sure that the 12 people that did not like my review live in their mother's basement and keep a bottle of liquid silicone and a box of Kleenex next to the remote.
B005DF2QMC|1.0|If you are looking to waste your time and then pay the shipping costs to send it back, this is the unit for you.<br /><br />The software must have been written by the anti Steve Jobs. I doubt that even Bill Gates could get this hunk of crap working.<br /><br />Be forewarned, this product encapsulates every bad post here and more.<br /><br />Don't forget to take your batteries out before you ship it back. It might be a scam to get free batteries......
B000I9YV12|5.0|A very compassionate look at how our society can treat people and things they do not understand.  A look at a very grave illness which lives amongst  us even today.  Phenomenal performances by a number of well known actors.
B000SEGEKI|5.0|book is really good and very on point. you will feel like he is almost talking to you.<br />highly recommended for anyone who works in the software industry
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I had heard people talking about this book so I decided to read it. Didn't know what their thoughts were concerning the book.  What a bunch of trash. Thank goodness I didn't buy the trilogy. Worse book I have ever read.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love having this app. With it i am able to take the bible along with me wherever i go.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|the Bible plans are a great way to hold yourself accountable.  I love being able to Post my thoughts on scripture without missing a beat.  God is great.  this app is good.
B000QCQ8Y4|1.0|OK story but not great.  The text had a tremendous amount of typos!  I lost count throughout the book as to the number of typos.  Each typo distracts from the story.
0316776963|5.0|This book was purchased for my son as required reading for his AP English class.  I don't have a review of the content of the book itself but rather the vendor.  This book arrived in a timely manner and was in excellent condition.  I would definitely purchase from this vendor again.
0385738773|4.0|James Dashner sure knows how to hook a reader. I put off reading The Death Cure for a long time because I remembered how heart-pounding The Scorch Trials were (I seemed to be in a minority in liking it, but I really did). Then, when I saw (and got my hands on) a copy of The Kill Order I decided it was time to buckle down and read.<br /><br />Y'all, I'm glad I decided to wait, because after I finish this review I am diving right into The Kill Order to find some answers. Not that I didn't get any with The Death Cure - I just know there are more out there. And, to be fair, I can't fault Dashner for doing it this way. There was a lot of stuff that needed to happen in this book, and as much as I wanted the easy way out offered in the beginning, a nagging voice in my head realized that would just be too easy.<br /><br />And so I settled back and I thoroughly enjoyed the ride. I went through twists and turns and hating some people and liking them and not knowing how to trust - basically I lived through Thomas. That \\"living through\\" thing is what makes books like this so exciting - and once again I sat on my sofa, thoroughly caught up in this story that wouldn't release me. I walked from room to room when called, nose in the book, ate my dinner with it propped up and battled sleepytime in the afternoon and at bedtime to finish it up. And I do not regret a single minute of it.<br /><br />So, in spite of his playing with my emotions and toying with me for 300+ pages, I tip my hat to James Dashner and thank him for one heckuva ride.
B00729GQ0A|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book and highly recommend it.  Believe the good reviews, especially those from industry/peer publications.  They are right, and do not overstate their praise at all. This is a great debut novel from this author and I'll be looking forward to more with these characters.<br />It is well written, with an excellent sense of timing and pace.  The narrative is evocative and colorful, never over-simplistic nor pretentious. Ms. Hamiliton masters the fine balance between those two extremes that is rarely found done so well in YA literature. The characters and the atmosphere manage to seem realistic and almost familiar in a way, at the same time as they are a bit \\"otherworldly\\". The main character Sophia is believeable: she comes across as genuine and likable -  the type of person who \\"wins you over\\". Her values remain constant even as she's dealing with danger from the (magical and/or) paranormal world, trying to own her powers, and learn who she really is. I enjoyed her strength and determination. I liked Charles, also, and enjoyed witnessing their relationship develop as they came to love each other.  In my opinion Ms. Hamilton wrote one of the best love scenes I have ever read in a young-adult novel. It came across as realistic, down to earth, genuine, and not \\"cheesy\\".  Overall, a great book. Give this one a try, I know you'll be glad you did!
B000002L68|5.0|I SAW THE MOVIE WHEN IT FIRST CAME OUT BEING A PRINCE FAN.  I THINK BECAUSE I SAW THE MOVIE, I CAN RELATE TO THE SONGS ON THE ALBUM.  IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THE MOVIE, THIS ALBUM MAY NOT BE YOUR CUP OF TEA FROM PRINCE'S OTHER ALBUM.  I'D SUGGEST RENT THE MOVIE AND DECIDE IF YOU'D WANT TO INVEST IN THE ALBUM.
B007XKEY6Q|4.0|great app.! Awesome to play when there's nothing to do. A little challanging in some asspects. What you draw seems to be a easy guess but not everyone sees things the way you do. Needs more words in the word choice. Also should really have a way to message drawing friends that are not on the game at the same time as you. Still a must have app!
0062119044|5.0|I have difficulty imagining that anyone who has read this book would honestly say that he \\"enjoyed\\" it. Lionel Shriver didn't write We Need to Talk About Kevin for anything as frivolous as readers' enjoyment; her purpose was much greater. In fact, We Need to Talk About Kevin is painful, disturbing, and literally gut-wrenching: I could only read it in small gulps and continue to be affected by the emotional trauma of its final chapters.<br /><br />But I cannot recall the last time I read a more important novel or one that expected so much of me at a human (and humane) level. If the reader is willing to allow the author inside to fiddle around with whatever concepts he or she may have of morality, justice, guilt, and parental responsibility in the face of the heinous acts of violence that have become as commonplace (and, in some ways, as remote) as typhoons in the western Pacific, be warned that Shriver leaves marks.<br /><br />To say Shriver is articulate and eloquent is almost to damn her with faint praise; We Need to Talk About Kevin is a masterwork of language, at the level of word choice and sentence structure, certainly, but also in Shriver's ability to sense when terse aphorism is appropriate and when nothing less than the lush, graphic, deliberate inducement of pain will do. Of certain books I've sometimes said, damningly, that they are more interesting to talk about than to read; this one is engrossing to read and demands to be talked about. I'd go so far as to recommend that you read it with a friend or as part of a book group: Afterwards, you will want to talk, if only for catharsis, if only to try to realign your certainties.<br /><br />At a time in our cultural (de)evolution when complex moral questions are repeatedly reduced to stick-figure epigrams and when the intellectual capacity to contain paradox has very nearly become vestigial, Shriver asks the reader to reanimate his ability to sit still and contemplate the depths of human emotional entanglement, to tolerate appalling contradiction. I happened to read this book just a few weeks after the shooting tragedy in Aurora, Colorado and directly after the massacre at the Sikh temple in Oak Grove, WI. The media - and the curse/blessing of social media - are still falling all over their own feet to pose (and then to answer, in 30-second sound bites) the question: Why? If you're satisfied with bromides like \\"violent video games,\\" \\"lowered moral standards,\\" \\"access to guns,\\" or \\"atheism,\\" do not read this book. It contains nothing that will make you feel better. To Shriver's eternal credit, making us feel better was the last thing she had in mind.
B005HJWWW8|5.0|A fiend of mine bought the firestone mini amp and it looked cool and sounded pretty good. I did some research and found the Fiio E6 has alot more sound choices at a little more than half the cost of the firestone.SO I bought it and went back to my friend to compare the 2. The Fiio was definetely better. The only downside is the fiio is slightly larger and has a shorter battery life. To me it is worth the trade off for the Fiio with the better sound. It works great when connected to my Soundmatters foxl speaker and really well when I connect it to my laptop. My laptop never gave me much base and this device makes it sound really good.It is really a tiny device. I paid $23 for the Fiio on Amazon. Not sure why a few days later it is $28 a 22% increase.
B005ZUR724|5.0|Not as bad as I thought. Exceeded my expectations. $3 for 6 months after first 3 months free. Well worth the money. Controls are easy to get used to. Graphics are great.

When you start the game when prompted use this code to get a sweet Rare card and money. Also Im a Order leader so if you love the game like I do I can add you.<br />The code is tqp45503 thanks Lats1
B006LSZECO|5.0|Perfect.. I can't tell you how many things I neglected to finish this book. The twists and turns kept me guessing
0425263908|1.0|Wow, could this story or lack of story be any worse? I think not. There is only F@#$%^&ing, fighting, walking out and crying.  Gideon is a gorgeous man with no substance, Eva is a brainless wet crotch. The author can sure write a great sex scene but the story flow is choppy at best and the conversations between the characters is 2nd grade level. And I thought 50 Shades of Grey was bad it's top shelf compared to this book.
B00846TRHY|2.0|My husband started to watch this but didn't finish.  He said it was full of very bad language.  We don't like movies that have that in them.

0618001905|5.0|This book is simply amazing, as mentioned on the cover, it does read like a novel; and an amazing thriller at that too. I guess it does have an upper hand in being an amazing story that we're not all familiar with - we know about Nazis and founding fathers and the Romans, but how much do you actually know about the Congo Free State? While much of the history has been lost forever, the author does his best to show what he can from the Congolese point of view. This story has many amazing characters throughout, and he does a great job at building periodic characters in sub-sections, introducing others for later, and building the character of Leopold simultaneously. It begins with Henry Stanley Morton, who is, for lack of a better word, one of the biggest saps in history. But what a great entertaining little narcissist he is! As his story comes to an end (well, the climax of it), I was a little nervous in thinking the story would be dry from there on out. Quite the contrary was true, as many more were to emerge from Joseph Conrad's Force Publique inspirations to George Washington Williams, a kindly and pious old fellow. This incredible character development is was really puts it over the top. I read non-fiction almost exclusively because I like knowing this stuff went on, but when it's told in a manner like this, it seems as if novels have no place to be read. If you have an interest in history, this book is a must read, if you have an interest in adventure, I would have to say the same. I honestly can't think of anyone who would not truly enjoy this tale. Yes, remember that history is written by the winners, but also remember that this is written with his bias (which acts as a rare and pleasant counter-force interestingly enough). On to Heart of Darkness which I haven't ever read.

B0054JZC6E|4.0|i really like this game but i would like more free games to start off with. some of the free games are just to hard
B007TXN4TK|5.0|Wow, I love this app! If I could give it six stars I would. Can't wait to purchase the full version. It just brings me memories or music school. Have my family members trying this out! Okay, I want my kindle fire back they just got so into this app. I love the cleverness in how they created this piano. It goes along with timing and very well done I should say, as it keeps you into the beat motions causing you to play as it should be. Wow, very impressive, I encourage others to purchase this, give it a try its free and you will be pleased especailly if you love the piano. I gave my upright piano away to someone who was very talented before I moved this is very comforting that we already want to purchase a new piano lol. Thanks Amazon and the seller!

1609613937|3.0|This book looked like a normal diet book that would interest me, as I have long been on the low carb diet and believe that starch and sugar cause obesity and health problems such as diabetes and arthritis. I was intrigued by the idea that starch such as rice and potatoes could help with weight loss, and wondered how that would work. Man, was I surprised to hear this works if and only if you give up meat, fish, eggs, cheese, and milk (the staples of all low carb diets). So it's not the blueberries but the cream that causes weight gain; not the pancakes but the butter on them. The low carb diet says it is the excess of carbs that causes weight gain; this book says it is the fat and protein that cause weight gain.<br /><br />I was pretty stunned when I came across such ideas as:<br />- all fish is toxic, including omega 3 fish oils in capsules; no one should ever eat fish again.<br />- man does not need any meat or dairy; and these both contribute to health problems.<br />- sugar does not make you gain weight and humans need some.<br /><br />My son is a vegan and he is obese. The author gets into that danger in chapter 10, The Fat Vegan. He largely blames the fake meat soy products and vegetable oils, but it's pretty hard to get enough non animal protein without resorting to some tofu and soy. The author admits that there is no vitamin B12 in non animal food, and that is the one supplement he recommends. Would this be the case in nature if we were not meant to eat any animal protein?<br /><br />This may indeed be a diet that is healthy, but to change over to these recommendations would be to eat the opposite of what I've been living on. I may just try it one day. It seems so drastic and I wonder if eliminating all animal products helps you lose weight simply because of the number of calories and the amount of fat.To me it does not make sense scientifically - I've experienced weight loss from a low carb diet and weight gain from adding carbs. But I've never tried a totally vegan diet.<br /><br />He praises Dr. Swank's low fat diet, whereas my husband tried this when he was diagnosed with MS in 1975, and it did not help him and he was unable to continue very long on it. In the past few years I have been seeing more about the need for fat (now called \\"good fats\\") in the human diet; the low fat craze of the 60s and 70s is no longer in favour. The need for Omega 3 because we get too much Omega 6 was only discovered in the 1980s and now I thought it was universally accepted.<br /><br />Anyway, to wrap this up, this is a startling book. It's worth reading, but it may be very difficult to actually follow the advice. I do want to try it though, to see if I could really lose weight eating mashed potatoes, beans and corn, as long as I don't eat meat, eggs or dairy. I just don't think I could stay on it for long, and I'd be worried about giving up all animal protein.
034580404X|5.0|I love these books, I will definitly buy from this author again. It only took about 3 days to read, it grips you and you cant put it down, I got out of these book different things than alot of people did. Its more about relationships, trust, understanding, and compromise. Its awesome.

0545091020|2.0|This review is for the audiobook version - enough people are here to tell you what the book is like. In fact, I quite enjoy the story. It has some genre-standard elements and the first person present-tense narration can be irritating, but it goes cool places and is worth a shot for kids and adults alike.<br /><br />The audiobook, however, should be avoided. Oh, wow, is it bad. Carolyn McCormick is the reader, and honestly, I always thought she was a good actor. I've seen her in almost a hundred Law & Order episodes and thought her performance was pretty good in every one.<br /><br />But her reading of this book is just... dead. Sometimes you get audiobooks performed by people who mispronounce words or give characters strange voices, but at least they can usually bring some enthusiasm with them. McCormick doesn't. She is monotone and lifeless, even at dramatic moments. It's especially bad as the story is related in the first-person; the lack of inflection makes it sound like Katniss doesn't care when people die, or when she's in danger herself. It also never, ever sounds like a teenage girl is talking, you can't even imagine it with this voice.<br /><br />Worse still is the dialogue. She barely does any voices, except to change pitch slightly. This actually becomes a problem when she has to read a male character, who will invariably sound like a lummox with a deep voice and no brains.<br /><br />If you were thinking about buying the audiobook instead of the text edition, give it a pass. The story will be much more effective for you without this lifeless performance.
B007TNS6JI|5.0|ok this game is awesome I just got the upgrade and it makes it way better and ITS FREE. I recommend this game Its alittle hard to get gear with out pay for it butits so worthit get this game/app
B0058VW36U|4.0|I absolutely LOVE this game. I downloaded it on my brother's tablet before I got my kindle. But on his tablet market (the slideME market) it was free. I don't understand why its 99&cent; on amazon. That's why I gave it four stars instead of five.

B008IJTFYW|5.0|I love this app. I use it all the time. I can sleep now cuz I now I love to sleep
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I couldn't believe it. After all the hype and the excitement built up around this book, I finally gave into my curiousity and read it. I am flabbergasted. This is what so many women are all hot and bothered by???<br />The heroin in this book is clumsy, ignorant, unsure of herself, and frankly a bit pathetic right from the get go. She then finds herself in a relationship with a seriously messed up, dominating, controlling individual who demands her to be subservient, docile, and meek- and this turns her on!? The sexual acts he demands are demeaning, yet he still manages to manipulate her into believing she enjoys it. For God's sake, she not even allowed to decide if/when she orgasms. Can't a girl at least have that much? Add into that the classic \\"my love will save him\\" syndrome and you have every bad stereotype of women played out in a singular character.<br />I am shocked that in today's society where most women you meet are confident, self assured, independent individuals, this is the book that is topping the chart. This is not the kind of relationship that is healthy or positive. That fact that it has made it so big troubles me.<br />I won't even touch on the bad, repetitive writing. The other reviews cover that little aspect quite thoroughly.<br />I appreciate that there are stereotypes for a reason, and that a lot of women will relate on some level to feeling frumpy, insecure, and insignificant. I also understand that qualities of strength, leadership, and power are attractive to many women. This book, however, plays out incredibly destructive examples of these attributes. People, we are better than this. This disfunction that is romantasized in this book is what I believe to be an insult to humanity's ability to forge beautiful relationships where each individual is respected as a strong, equal part of the whole. There are better books to spend your time, money, and thoughts on.

0552999652|4.0|Saw the movie, and then read the book.  The book is better than the movie.  With a son in the military, this book really hit home.
B008KRJWEK|1.0|Very nice looking game but after 5 mins waiting for the game to actually load I had to restart it. After it restarted and actually proceeded to load the game was very choppy and consequently I crashed, ending the current game. After the results screen it automatically loaded the \\"shop\\" screen without my clicking the button. Cancelled that nonsense and tried to start a new game. Guess what - another long load screen. Already deleted from my phone.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|really fun but hard to earn enough points for each game and they get more expensive. games are mostly all fun
0061990477|4.0|I purchased The Thorn Birds to keep for myself.  I have loaned it out twice and never got it back either time so wanted one copy on my shelf.  I have only done this with one other book and that is Gone With The Wind.

B004XJRQUQ|4.0|Although this book is primarily written for young adults, and I am not one of those, I found it a compelling and exciting read. The characters are well drawn and the power of description excellent. I would certainly recommend it
B005D0RDIE|5.0|That live 3 CD set called \\"Different Stages\\" that has the erector set pieces on the cover is fantastic too.<br /><br />This particular DVD is excellent in all it's over 3 hours: Highly recommended. The only thing that didn't need to be done was for Geddy to apoligize for the 'reckless indulgence' comment at the end of 'Leave That Thing Alone' because I believe it to be one of thier best songs and I personally groove on it when they play that instrumental. I always wanted to know what the inspiration was for that song.<br /><br />All of Rush's DVD's are good in one way or another especially the early stuff when they were starting out (the black and white stuff is facinating to see compared to the newer produced stuff but as they say it's progressive rock music and some of it can be construed as being a bit on the metal side of things, they should be commended for that alone but they have seen plenty of success) I still love the CD called Counterparts and it's one of my favorites! I saw them live on the Hold Your Fire tour years ago in Dallas Texas in 1988 and they lit the three balls on fire from the ceiling of the Reunion Arena and then dropped balloons all over the stadium, it was an awesom show, I still remember the lasers at that show seemed to reach out into the audience or looked like they did, I even have a DVD by them that I bought online that's called Tastes Like Chicken from a concert that was filmed by the audience and it's an awesome show even if the camera did move around too much, I trust the fans more than I do the professionals sometimes because it gives a different perspective on things.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This has to be one of the best games ever made.  It is very relaxing and is very addictive.  Even managed to get Mom addicted to flow.
B005LAII3U|3.0|The original 1990 version of \\"Total Recall\\" was released at the height of Arnold Schwartzenegger's career and popularity. Despite its many flaws, the movie, loosely based on Philip K. Dick's \\"We Can Remember it for You Wholesale\\", was a smash hit and is still a respected action science fiction movie. For the most part, it was because of its storyline, but I would say that it is also because of the charisma of its star and the loosey-goosey have some fun direction of Paul Verhoeven.<br /><br /> Verhoeven brought that same fun to other action science fiction movies like \\"Robo Cop\\", \\"Starship Troopers\\" and (not action sci-fi, but) \\"Basic Instinct\\". Bottom line, Verhoeven was a master at what audiences wanted to see. He wasn't particularly critically heralded, but audiences loved his violence, seediness and the personality he brought to the characters.<br /><br /> In a way, \\"Total Recall\\" maybe deserved a remake. In 1990, the technology available was nowhere near what we have today. Most of the effects were silly and cheap looking. The new version of \\"Total Recall\\" has effects and action in spades. If there is one thing that director Len Wiseman is really good at, it's putting together amazing action sequences, and \\"Recall\\" 2012 maybe his best work to date, in that aspect. The synthetic humanoid army that marches through \\"Recall\\" 2012 put George Lucas' clone army to shame.<br /><br /> Another thing to note is the outstanding performance by Wiseman's wife, Kate Beckinsale, who plays Lori Quaid, a part played by Sharon Stone in the original. She sinks her teeth into the sweet loving wife and ruthless assassin character with charisma and athletics. She is one of the most believable parts of the movie.<br /><br /> Unfortunately though, that same charisma and fun that Schwartzenegger brought to the original are completely absent in the remake. Schwartzenegger has never been known as a great actor, but he never failed to bring personality to his characters. No matter what silly line he was uttering, you were with him in his ventures. Colin Farrell, who plays the part in the remake is completely void of anything other than, `look how good-looking and cool I look.'<br /><br /> It is a hard pill to swallow, getting past the lack of any sort of deepness from Farrell. He basically wears the same reaction and emotion throughout the entire movie, despite changing characters twice and going through numerous life realizations. That aside, \\"Total Recall\\" 2012 has been giving a technology overhaul and may be one of Wiseman's best action movies yet. Unfortunately for him though, the movie will probably fall into ho-hum land due to lead actor who couldn't bring the audience to think anything about him one way or the other.ly line he was uttering, you were with him in his ventures.

0441014054|5.0|Dune is my third favorite Science Fiction novel.  Number Three.  Dune is clearly a masterpiece that resonates with many women and men.  This is the only Frank Herbert novel that works for me as entertainment; but he hit one out of the ballpark with this Home-Run novel.  I have re-read it at least ten times.  On the re-reads I perhaps skip 20%.<br /><br />Dune is so famous that I won't sport with your intelligence by wasting words on plot or characters.<br /><br />[David Lynch lost creative control of his Dune movie: *SOUND OFF* bits of it might have some use as visuals for a Dune music video, or Full-Length as silent visual art for Dune lovers, but as entertainment or story-telling . . . is it possible to give Zero Stars?  ~  The 4.5 hour long John Harrison Dune 3-Disc DVD set starring William Hurt is actually pretty good.  Most Dune lovers will like it.]<br /><br />Herbert wrote a previous novel Under Pressure about submarines where his Minimum Ecology theme was first introduced.  This is the only other Frank Herbert novel that I find readable.  But I think here he worked out all the bugs of the Minimum Ecology thing, so a decade later when he wrote Dune he was ready to take it to the next level.<br /><br />The science may be \\"soft,\\" the elements of fantasy may turn off hard-core Sci-Fi fans, but Frank Herbert does everything else so perfectly in Dune that I am jealous and disappointed: I know that I will never be able to write a novel as perfect as this puppy.  @hg47

B004Q3SGWG|5.0|I could not put this book down.  I found it to be well written.  Though throughout the ordeal I wanted to shout out, \\"why did you go alone, not have a cell phone, etc, etc?\\"  The fact is, he did make those mistakes.  Humans do.  This is a tremendously powerful story that demonstrates a man with an incredible will to live and a strength and determination to overcome obstacles, literally and figuratively.
0307352145|3.0|The book, Quiet, by Susan Cain, is a very interesting book.<br /><br />While I enjoyed reading about the concepts of \\"The Power of Introverts in a World That Can't Stop Talking,\\" I found my mind wandering when I didn't necessarily understand some of the points. I did learn, however, that while some people can be considered extroverts because they get along well with others and seem to enjoy being in a crowd, they could actually be introverts. For instance, Cain writes that some consider introverts to be shy, but they aren't necessarily.<br /><br />This book is good to read if you are trying to know yourself better, and if  you are able get through the somewhat tedious language (at times).<br /><br />I received this book for free from WaterBrook Multnomah Publishing Group for this review.
B002NANLCE|5.0|I liked the story, which as other reviewers mention, it has little to do with the TV series: the series was based in this book but only as an idea, the story of the book doesn't even take place in USA (or not entirely), the story develops in Europe, at CERN premises.<br />I consider this book sci-fi but a \\"light\\" sci-fi which everybody can enjoy, because as I see it, it is more oriented towards the feelings and the stories of the people involved in certain event, rather than being a story of pure science-fiction.<br />I also liked the style of the book for its simplicity, but I am not a native English speaker so I'm not sure my judgement is good enough on that matter, I'd probably choose simple over pompous only because that way is easier for me.<br />I hope you enjoy it as much as I did!
B007V2UGPE|2.0|This is the second time I have downloaded a Glu game, I really liked the first one \\"Small Street\\" but after I had been playing for a while and had about 35 buildings, the app just would not load anymore .

I have been a fan of the GLA since hearing \\"American Slang\\" and couldn't wait to hear this new album. I was NOT dissappointed! It is filled with passionate anthems that will stand the test of time. The lead singer Brian Fallon is amazing! Although the cover art could have been a bit more exciting , it's what's inside that that really counts. All the songs are works of art , especially \\"National Anthem\\". which I predict radio stations will start playing real soon. . It's an album well worth picking up , as you will enjoy this over & over.

0062060562|1.0|Before I Go To Sleep really annoyed me.  The premise was contrived and implausible, the main character superficial -- an unsympathetic victim to nth degree, the other characters completely flat and uninteresting, the plot unbelievable, the writing relying on endless repetition to indicate that the story was emotionally harrowing.  Don't waste your money or your time.
B004DLPXAO|3.0|I love it when it works.<br /><br />Unfortunately, it drops all my books.  I has dropped/deleted al my books, bookmarks, etc 4 times now in 3 weeks of using the app.  When it does, I need to push my books back out to my device and begin again.<br /><br />For casual reading around the house this is annoying.  For taking a stack of books when I go on a trip (where I don't have constant internet access) or reading on a plane (where I can't do a download), this would entirely defeat the purpose of the app.

B001QTXM5Y|5.0|I alredy loved the theatrical cut. I thought that you could not get any closer to the comic. I was wrong.<br /><br />The Directors cut is extended by 24 minutes  and all 24 minutes are increadible.<br /><br />the few flaws I found with the original cut are fixed here. And any plot holes the original cut had are gone. If you Love The WATCHMEN book and you liked or loved & even if you found the original cut lacking this is for you.<br /><br />It's worth it just for the death of Hollis Mason scene.<br /><br />Now I didn't find disc 2 features all that great, but I had read the making of book, if you have not read the making of book then the features are great.<br /><br />I highly recomend this film

0425263908|1.0|I bought this book because I loved 50 Shades Trilogy.  This book is a total copy, from Gideon's described looks down to the initial meeting between the two characters with a fall into his office.  We could all read 50 Shades and write a book with all the similarities.  The only thing the writer could not copy off of 50 Shades was the detail of the characters that 50 Shades had.  Total disappointment.
B007IXWKUK|3.0|2nd book a little better than 1st, still need something to happen to these people, think I am more of a mystery/thriller/ fantasy reader
B007J4T2G8|1.0|are you kidding me...best seller...really..this is the worst book i have read ..what a waste of time and money....<br /><br />None
B0028IDXDS|5.0|My 8 month baby loves his little monkey sometimes he won't fall asleep with out it. He plays with his little tail rubbes it on his face while chewing on it. Works great wish I would of had it sooner.
B0033807E0|5.0|I cannot find anyone who wont enjoy the sieries this is the fourth time ive read it. to much Humor in  the books :} get the idea? well my mum reccomended it so i got lightning thief and read it all the time (not exaggerating OF COURSE).try to get this book as fast as you can ok?.
B005S39YGU|5.0|This is hands down one of the best comedy series ever.  For my tastes anyway.  The writing and acting are top notch.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Relatively  similar to what you find on facebook but it sure keeps me occupied. I really enjoy games like this...
B008EL4YX6|4.0|If you like puzzle games then this is your type of game. I highly reccomend it because it's the free app of the day and its super fun!
B0063GORYU|5.0|great game for occupying five minutes here or there or for winding down at bed time. not too easy, not too frustrating.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|This game is so much fun! The best part is, the free version is enough for me that there's no reason to buy the full version and it'll probably be the same for you! DOWNLOAD THIS GAME!!!!!!!!!!!!! :D
B006C45MRE|3.0|We had a great time watching this rather goofy film. Was a tad intense and scary for some of the wee ones, but we knew it was filled with adventure when we started it.<br /><br />Space Aliens and Cowboys .... how could you go wrong with this one.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|How on Earth did this get published? The main male character is an abusive self-centered jerk... the main female character is a sniveling idiot... the plot is terrible... the love scenes worse... and the writing? Adolescent. The ending felt like premature - never mind, keeping it clean. I'd give it 0 stars if I could.
030758836X|4.0|Gone Girl kept me guessing all the way to the final checkmate.<br /><br />The plot is worthy of five stars, the characters only three. Flynn displays a budding talent for creating complex characters in Nick, Amy, and Margo, but the rest of the cast are one-dimensional utility characters. Yet, they fulfill their assignments nicely. Nick and Amy are convincing as the author's unreliable, husband and wife narrators, reminding her readers there are indeed three sides to every story. And what a story--clever, twisty, and slightly disturbing in a fun-not frightening-way, Gone Girl is a good read.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I use this app to keep track of the weather everyday and it has worked  well on my Kindle Fire. When compared to the local tv forecasts  it is on par and I like being able to check the weather for other locations important  to me.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|enjoying each level, including the bonus. fun for the whole family. my wife and I compete while watching Tv. keep it up noodle cake.
0307719219|4.0|I give this book 4 stars only because of a few things the authors left out, in my opinion.<br /><br />This is an excellent and thought-provoking read and highly recommended for everyone, especially many modern politicians (even a certain president), who can't see that their \\"political institutions\\" are actually impeding progress and allowing poverty to continue in their countries.<br /><br />IMO, what they left out is why certain groups, like the Pilgrims, et al., refused to lived in an \\"extractive\\" society. What in their past made them behave like that?<br /><br />Also, as others have written, they didn't really talk about the role of education in determining whether people would accept an extractive society or not.<br /><br />The influence of religion (particularly, Christianity) on the formation of many inclusive nations was not discussed.<br /><br />The authors somewhat discounted the effect that help by America had on certain nations, e.g., South Korea, Japan, Germany, etc. For example, would Japan have continued to be an extractive nation if it had won WWII, and not received rebuilding help from the U.S.?<br /><br />My mom and I both read this book and enjoyed it immensely. We had several slight disagreements with the initial conclusions of why nations fail but overall, agreed with the authors' opinions.<br /><br />A brilliant point the authors made is that the elite rulers of 3rd world nations DON'T want their nations to succeed on the level of 1st world nations since in doing so, they would lose their power, or the mass of \\"happy\\" workers would lose their jobs through \\"creative destruction.\\"  I guess I always knew this but had never heard it explained so well, and with so many good examples. I saw this firsthand when I lived in Central America.<br /><br />Finally, this book reminded me of Ayn Rand's \\"Atlas Shrugged,\\" another book everyone should read. Rand's depiction of \\"Producers & Looters,\\" or politicians who create ridiculous institutions, or barriers to capitalism, sounded very familiar to what the authors of this book had to say. I bet they would mostly agree on why nations fail.capitalism, sounded very familiar to what the authors of this book had to say. I bet they would mostly agree on why nations fail.
B007JM4CWY|5.0|This app is a perfect way to relax and still use my brain during a long commute to and from work everyday.  Love it and haven't run out of puzzles yet.
0375869026|5.0|I read Wonder for my book club and this was chosen due to our profession (we are school counselors).  It was a beautiful story that is well written.  I laughed and even cried while reading all about Auggie's transition into a school setting.  Each character was enjoyable to read and it gave you various perspectives.  I recommend Wonder to all.
B005VSRFEA|5.0|After finishing the book, I felt I had a pretty good grasp on how to approach models and systems. The way to pose and ponder questions when looking at seemingly simple systems came easily after reading the book. I also realized that subject matter experts are useful to a degree in understanding systems but the outsider can see a problem very differently and that is valuable as well. I would recommend this book.
B00005N6KG|1.0|Found these inexpensive earphones.  On the first use, the right earphone quit after about 15 seconds.  Sounded great while they lasted!  I'm going to get a replacement and see if they last longer.  Call me crazy, but I think just because a thing is cheap, doesn't mean it shouldn't work!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I like it.....I don't use it a lot but it is great for long car trips! so ya I like it I realy like the orange game and the juleiet game!
B008IJTFYW|4.0|I've only had this app for about a week and it seems to be working. The only thing I would like changed is, to be able to use this app while I'm reading a book on the kindle.
034580404X|5.0|I insisted upon ordering the full trilogy so I wouldn't have to wait in between books to receive the next one in the mail. I'm so glad that these were offered in a very sleek trilogy box set. The packaging was well-fitted to the product, no damage. The box set blends in well with the other books on my shelf, so as not to attract the attention of my 10 year old. I suggested to my mother for her to read the books, and she is now intrigued. She's eagerly waiting for me to finish reading them so she can borrow them. If E.L. James never wrote another book I'd be satisfied reading the Fifty Shades trilogy all over again! I'd be interested to see if they make a movie trilogy of this too.
B006LSZECO|5.0|When I purchase a book from amazon.com, I go on line on my computer & check the New York Times Best Sellers list. When I find a book that looks interesting, I sample the first few pages. By then I can tell if the author's style has sucked me into the story. Gillian Flynn has done just that with the 3 books I have read. GONE GIRL  turned the reader into despising her husband, Then seeking justice for him in many twisted events. I was amazed at how far revenge could take a person.
B008OOYALE|3.0|I would  give it a five star if they'd make a version that would run on my Dell Streak 7.
B005LAII9O|2.0|I was very excited when I saw that Savages was being made into a movie. The book is so dark funny and exciting all at the same time. I could think of no one better to direct than Oliver Stone. He has the perfect sensibilities for such material.<br />  I left the theater wanting to ask for my money back. It was very clear that Stone phoned this one in. The majority of the dark humor, that was so prevalent in the book, has been erased from the movie. A perfect example of this is the exclusion of O's mother from the movie. That character is wonderfully amusing and gave great insight into the character of O. The one exception to this is John Travolta as Ben and Chan's FBI contact. He turns in a wonderfully wacky and entertaining performance that I feel is on par with his Pulp Fiction turn. Travolta seems to be the only one who looked at the source material.<br />I also have to address the ending. There has never been a more blatant example of a studio forcing a director to change an ending. It is weird awkward and just plain embarrassing. What happened to the Oliver Stone who directed Natural Born Killers? This material was in desperate need of that edge and humor. Does Stone not have final cut approval? I certainly hope he did not have it on this piece of junk. Read the book and don't waste your time on the movie.
B005LAII0S|1.0|This movie has characters but they don't have emotions there more like robots Julia Roberts does a horrible job as the evil queen, and Lily Collins is a little irritating in this movie,mthey prince was boring, and the dwarves were just plain annoying. The plot could have been written by 5 year old for all we know, over all don't waste your money on this movie wait for it to show on tv in 2 years.
B00632HWOG|5.0|ive never had a problem with it, it works perfectly and its very easy to use. It allows me to move multiple emails into different folders simultaneously and for me, I don't get any ads popping up anywhere and I can see more than just the first ten emails.
B0085Z3B2Q|5.0|I thought that this is a great family movie that reccommend to those big and small, it's a movie that anyone can enjoy it also has a really great message at the end. Its a better movie choice than \\"MIRROR MIRROR\\" so give it a try.
0345803507|4.0|last but not least,the last book was just as good as the other two.I enjoyed all three and they are well worth your time and money to read.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|I started a new job and needed to be up at 3 am, but having worked nights for 15 years, I didn't own a dependable alarm clock.  So I tried this app.  It has done the job everyday without fail, and my kindle has gone weeks without needing a recharge (I've been to tired to read much at the end of the day, hopefully after awhile I will adjust to working and living during day light hours).  Thanks for a great little alarm!
B007J4T2G8|4.0|i bought this book but didnt expect to like it but i did.well worth the time and money to read.
B0088TG252|2.0|This movie was good, REALLY good, right up until you learn that Denzel Washington's character became disillusioned because he had to kill a man who was going to testify to congress about \\"black ops\\" CIA \\"Wet Works\\" aka, assassinations. Typical Hollywood turns patriotism into sleaze and denigrates our country all in one scene.<br />Action is good.<br />Story is a little muddled, but keeps you watching to figure out what's happening.<br />Acting is good.<br />Holywood bashes America: without even asking Washington any pertinent questions, they imediately waterboard him.<br />CIA are the bad guys here.<br />If you want patriotic flag waving, proud to be an American fare, look somewhere else. As long as the left runs Holywood, America will continue to be something to be ashamed of and we will have garbage like this movie.
0345803493|4.0|i enjoyed this story,well worth the time and money to read.there are some parts that are kinda of over the top but i couldnt stop reading.
B004FQX5CK|5.0|LOVE the new blue/green color timing at least for this one. Some people seem to dislike it but I always thought the original production looked dated as hell with its reddish 80s look. This one fixes so many gafs and errors that you couldn't count them all easily. THE ONE AWFUL thing about this Bluray is the fact its bitrate is appalling.<br /><br />At 16Mbps it is just is not enough imo for film, but at least it's dark enough to barely escape with a decent encode. Many good films are sitting at twice that bitrate and that is still not really enough for film. I would wait for a better version before buying. I can almost smell a 4K ready release in the future or simply a native 4K release a little further down the road. The 5 disc is worth it for the other films and various extras so you can buy that and come away very happy with all the content. This is EASILY the definitive version of an utterly great film.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|You know, there is not much I can say about ths book-it's all been said before! I read this a couple of years ago, and was simply enthralled. This book was such that it made a huge impact on me.<br /><br />Granted I did not see all the religious and spiritual connotations; that just seemed to pass over me, and I did feel the first 1/3rd of the book to be a little slow, but what a grand finish! I did NOT see that coming. A grand expose on true human nature. I liked the way that Martel left the ending oblique, a dichotomous end! What do YOU believe really happened?<br /><br />(Also, I did not quite see what the whole point on the island, with the meerkats etc. was all about. Please could someone enlighten me. A very abstract piece)<br /><br />One of the finest books that I have ever read!
B002ZG983M|3.0|As a film about superheroes you could do worse. There is nothing here noteworthy though except the first 30 or so minutes are fairly well thought out. This is a fetishized look at modern America today. Violence obsessed and sexually deprived. The characters have some witty dialogue but this one has no clue what it is in the end. Serious in one moment and then hacksaws and headshots in another with crappy punk music blaring loudly. Makes for good entertainment I guess.<br /><br />I give it three stars because it tries, and doesn't hold a candle to the innovation in something like Scott Pilgrim, nor does it have the actual veracity of the violence in Batman. It is what it is.
B008EL4YX6|5.0|Simple, clean, elegant. Relaxing way to escape from reality. Timeless, I can see myself playing this for years to come.
B00006AUIG|5.0|I love these kinds of films. In a day and age of Saw and other ridiculously over the top garbage this one hits all the right tones for me. I couldn't keep my eyes away. It builds up and doesn't let go. There are a few flaws in this one as with every production but I think they outdid themselves here with a small budget and that is why I am awarding it five stars. If you are brave enough to be this subtle you deserve it.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I have used for many years and it has been great. There are an annoying amount of updates but you can skip them.
B000HF6XKO|5.0|I think this film is a great exposition on what these industries are like in reality. A little over the top but not really. The acting is top notch and the directing to me is fabulous. I wouldn't have this film any other way. In truth it takes a lot of balls to make a film like this. It's probably not perfect but I don't really care. I put it up there with The Constant Gardener for what it does to expose America's elite foreign policies elsewhere in the world. Money runs the corruption in all these industries and we often are not ever told of the truths behind the curtains of Oz. This one is pretty fair in my book.
