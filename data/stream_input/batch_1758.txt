B005BRS8Z6|4.0|The book certainly offers a very valuable perspective on life, death, and the things we think of as meaningful. It's well put together, good length. My biggest problem however is with the third agreement. To take nothing personal. On the surface it seems fine, though it's taken to an extreme, to take nothing good or bad personally. Seemingly rejecting the possibility that anyone could empathize with another. To me this is the most fundamental characteristic of humanity, if not the most often forgotten in these times. It's important not to take things personal when they're not, but I think it's important to take things personal when they actually are.<br /><br />Although these four agreements create a feasible, all-encompassing philosophy, I think the third is a failure of the ideal. Regardless, it helped me take a step back from worldview as I was backsliding into depression again. I like to think it helped avoid going down that path again. I would suggest it to anyone in looking for a new perspective on life, whether ill, addicted, in a funk, or just looking for a breath of fresh air. It may not be an entire answer, but is at least a very important challenge likely to affect at least some positive change.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|I've always struggled with the question &#34;what is your favorite book&#34; or &#34;what is your favorite author.&#34; I've read plenty over the years and I've even read stuff that I would consider good or even really, really good but to be your favorite?? I dunno, that always seemed to be something that I hadn't ever experienced yet in a literary sense. This book HAS SHOWN ME THE LIGHT!! Ok, that was a joke but really, I LOVED this book! I am currently devouring the second book and I recently told a friend that when I'm at work around 4:30 or 4:45, I start getting excited about the fact that I'm gonna be home soon and able to read the next chapter. Oh, an important side-note, generally speaking I do not consider myself to be a reader of &#34;fantasy fiction&#34; or even &#34;science fiction.&#34; These books, however, are an exception to the norm for me. If you are thinking about reading this book but questioning whether you'll like it, READ IT! You won't regret it! It's REALLY good!!
B004K8WPUQ|5.0|WOW. I've been working on a documentary about the local comedy scene for over a year on the side, doing countless inteviews and recording probably a couple hundred sets by now. I started out with the non-pro one, which was great, this is even better, and even smaller. The audio quality is superb. Low hiss, almost non-existent. I recommend setting the gain on the mic and turning down the camera input as some other reviewers have recommended. Absolutely go for it. RODE is great.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I loved the book. The ending was what I had been hoping for. It had many twist I did not see coming and it made it hard to put the book down. She has great debt to her characters that you can't help but fall in love with.

B0012YYZYK|5.0|1080p Big Screen loving of the standard bearers of rock & roll itself.<br /><br />Um, 26 minutes of a Dazed & Confused jamming lovefest how can you go wrong. It will elevate you in ways that I'm to much of a gentleman to elicit here, :P -> Riffing/Soloing Nirvana<br /><br />A much under recognized favorite jam of mine that just explodes out of Jimmy Page also is during Whole Lotta Love towards the end when he belts out the classic licks of Boogie Chillen(J.L.Hooker). This little Vin-bit clip in the overall W.L.L song is an older but stupendous classic blues riff that Jimmy really updates an metalized an just jams out a masterful rendition of the old blues standard. It's some of the best video out there displaying Jimmy Page fingering prowess out there in this man's humble 2 cent opinion. Anyway this movie is simply just Led Zeppelin in concert playing their hearts out to what I consider some of the best music, the best songs made ever overall!<br /><br />For the record, I've must have seen this movie 100's of times back as a teenager if I've seen it once when I first began my perennial Zep Odyssey or Zepyssey. See, where I lived they use to play it at the theaters at midnight when I was a teenager back in the eighties(46 now) and usually every 4-6 months they would cycle it through for like 3-4 weekends in a row. It was by far the only way I was gonna ever see or specifically the closest I would ever get to seeing the all mighty Zep in a true sort of concert venue really ever. While watching it on my big 65\\" screen now of course is very cool, it just can't compare to the huge screens and thunderous sound of the theaters all those years ago. It was such a chaotically good scene of just a couple hundred Zep Heads all convening and soaking up the sauce/smoke of whatever they could smuggle in with them while watching massive 20 foot images of the Wizards from Wembley play their collective a**es off. hehe (ok I know, none were specifically from Wembley, it's england though right & it just kinda flows and fits so no flaming please, lol)<br /><br />This movie has it all....so if..... Your a Led Zep fan you should already own this, in fact shame on you if you don't! hehe.

B0059XTU1S|3.0|He's also now added the same mistake he made in King Kong of indulging in excess - and I'm not referring to the length. The problem is not the length but that everything is over the top, from the size of the trolls and orcs to the scale of the special effects and the set pieces like the battles.  But what are these mistakes he made in LOTR? Well the ones now anyone can even see from the trailers and clips for this new film are the ones that struck me first in the other films, namely: too many facial close-ups; too much zooming and panning, too much swooping  moving-crane or airborne camera always in perpetual movement; excessive use of the wide angle lens which distorts space and perspective; the old fashioned dubbing of the actor's voices; and in particular  too much close-miked dubbing of Gandalf's voice which has him sounding as if he's muttering to himself, or as if we're meant to be 'hearing' his thoughts. The tendency towards using too many close-ups means that we seldom get enough shots of figures in context which would allow for some impressive framing and contribute to a sense of atmosphere. But at least the close ups aren't quite as much of a problem as they were in LOTR. As usual we have to put up with New Zealand instead of Tolkien's intended English landscape. The English countryside, landscape and atmosphere is a very important part of Tolkien's imagination and we've not enough here which can be mistaken for the real thing even in the earlier stages of the journey. Like all big budget action films these days it's all too much 'in your face', and surely it should be obvious that this is not the right visual style for 'The Hobbit' the book. These constant camera movements, sometimes violent, and the fast editing, are all very familiar anyway having been used increasingly for the last 20 years, but here they are really overdone. The almost continual movement here is no doubt the result of trying to get the max out of 3D - as is the number of times thingscome suddenly towards you and jump out of the frame. It's also obvious that the battles are overdone with far too many evil goblins against so few in the company of dwarves, resulting in the unbelievable, yet nauseating, slaughter of the many by the indestructible few.  In addition much of it looks very artificial with the dwarves looking either like Disney cartoons brought to life or like good looking actors dressed up to look like romantic Vikings, or some such, and not dwarves at all - everyone seems to have too much make-up on. Still these things are perhaps not fatal to the final effect of the film because after all The Hobbit is not the sacred book that LOTR is, and this is going to be a big family movie. On the other hand Martin Freeman looks not much more like a Hobbit than the actors in LOTR did - for a start he's not fat enough and what's more he looks just like Martin Freeman. It seems to me this sort of casting alone condemns all the films to inevitable failure for the true Tolkien enthusiast, and this and they would have been better family films if an effort had been made to look for some fairly small unusual looking people to play the parts. In any case we certainly don't need to have recognisable actors like Ken Stott and James Nesbitt who obviously make suspension of disbelief impossible before we've started. This film and LOTR had no business with being about actors and acting and would have been better off with total unknowns in every part. And everyone knows that Bilbo looked something like a younger Paul Simon, don't they?  And then there is the music. We have been subjected to the same old music all over again, which those of us who disliked it the first time around, finding it inappropriate in tone, style and scale, as well as poor in quality, inevitably feeling it even more intolerable  to hear again. In fact IF this music was going to be repeated why would we want to see the film at all, if we know and love the book, or indeed the old 1968 BBC radio serial? But even if there had been new  music I suppose that given the same composer it was always going to be the same overblown all-purpose generic BIG film music that we hear all the time for any subject that isn't trying to be 'cool' and contemporary. And surely one of the worst things about the music in the case of the LOTR films was that the Hobbits in the Shire were given music with a strongly Irish or Scottish flavour. Now even one of the Dwarves  has an unmistakable Northern Irish accent and another one a Scottish. But why should we be surprised when it seems so often that any film maker setting out to make a film 'entertaining' also feels that he can forget any need to achieve a sense of reality (albeit what Tolkien called 'secondary reality') other than by means of costumes and CGI This kind of soundtrack makes any sort of detachment - upon which enchantment depends - extremely difficult. And enchantment is a large part of what a 'secondary world' is all about (we have Tolkien's word for that).  Anyway the music is mostly just the same stuff we were given in LOTR and which alone would have been enough to ruin the final effect of however good a film it might have been.  Like the rest  it's film muzak, the current industry standard for 'big' films,  and can be produced on demand by the yard. I said that the music is in the wrong style anyway, but it's not that I don't love the late-Romantic style when it's done well as it used to be by John Williams, and he CAN do enchantment too, but even he wouldn't be right for LOTR or The Hobbit. What is needed I believe is something much more pared down, and that could be something more contemporary in terms of serious music (contemporary classical music if you will) or it could be something in the ancient manner like our medieval music, or the classical music of some other cultures. A blu-ray disc could even give us a choice - or no music at all.  I do realize that most of what I have called faults are just the sort of thing the film industry now demands when it wants a huge box-office and marketing success to rival all the superhero films based on comics. This is why the current style of film music in action films, with all its heavy dependence on sudden physical shocks (produced by the new bass technology and 5.1 surround), is all of a piece with fast and constantly mobile camera movement in three dimensions and fast editing, and why the commercial film industry insists on so many close-ups.The frequent close-ups are also related to the close miking and dubbing of the voices as a strategy for the total immersion which is supposed to provide the maximum possible manipulation of the consumer. It can be appropriate for some subjects where the emphasis is on character and acting but it doesn't work for epic narratives like LOTR and I don't believe it will work for an equally extended three part Hobbit which, with otherwise good justification, is obviously intended to represent another part of the epic story of the Ring. Epic requires some distance, and so does enchantment.  I strongly recommend everyone listens to the 1968 BBC radio serial of The Hobbit which has been available for some time on a CD set. It has a magic this film can't achieve, and the theme music and the Dwarves' song are just right. I also recommend its wonderfully idiosyncratic Gandalf. It has no great aspiration to the epic any more than did Tolkien's original book and is much more in keeping with its style. I have no objection to the the narrative being upscaled to the epic for this new film but for the reasons I have given I don't think has succeeded  much more than the LOTR films did. I am not recommending the BBC radio serial of LOTR from around 1982.  But Gollum is still a wonder of at least one aspect of the film industry, and at least one way it has done Tolkien justice.but for the reasons I have given I don't think has succeeded  much more than the LOTR films did.

B0073LWEXK|5.0|I loved this game/app.  There were times where I had to think and there were times where once I got one part, others slotted into place and it was just a matter of remembering where I needed to go.  A good size - not too big that it would be impossible to find your way around, and not too small that it was too easy to remember (I regularly had to refer to the map).  Would highly recommend this game to anyone who enjoys figuring out puzzles.  I was pleased that it was the type of game I could pick up and put down in-between normal life - I don't have time to sit for hours playing in one sitting! Hope there are more like this to come from the makers.

The book allows you to get to know the characters on a deeper level. In my opinion, Pretty Little Liars is a great series that anyone could get addicted to. However, Because of some of the content, I wouldn't recommend anyone under 13 reading it. I can't wait to read the rest of the books!

I had been wanting this app for months, but I held off because of the $7.00 price tag. then suddenly, Yipee! it goes on a $1.00 sale. so I bought it. i should have known that it was too good to be true... I downloaded all six hundred thirty something or other MB, which seemed a small price to pay. I opened the app, and watched the intro eagerly. once it was over, the screen went black for a moment before returning to home screen. I tried again. and again. and again. over and over and over. Nothing. NOTHING! Gameloft is cheating us out of our money. don't get this. its not worth the money or the dissapointment. I want my dollar back.

B007REV4T8|4.0|The now half-century-old James Bond franchise is still the epitome of spy-versus-spy action cool having survived the Cold War all the way through the new millennium, and Daniel Craig continues to carry the mythic mantle with steely resolve in his third entry in the series. Directed by top-level filmmaker Sam Mendes ([[ASIN:B003VJTGLQ American Beauty]]), this 2012 movie manages to be both a cheeky throwback to the character's legacy and a state-of-the-art Bourne-inspired terrorist thriller. It opens in classic style with a breathless chase through the streets of Istanbul and literally on the rooftops of the old city's Grand Bazaar with Bond and MI6 operative Eve hot on the trail of a target carrying a hard drive containing the identities of every British Secret Service agent. A shot is fired, mandated by M back in MI6's London headquarters, and knocks Bond into a river. This leads beautifully to the macabre Saul Bass-inspired title sequence underscored by Adele's sonorous vocals.<br /><br />Meanwhile, MI6 is under siege and goes underground when Bond finally resurfaces rattled by his near-death experience. Given a Walther PPK and tracking device by a new post-adolescent Q, Bond travels to Shanghai to confront the elusive target again in an exciting mano-a-mano fight. He is led by a sexy enigmatic woman named Severine to Silva, an ex-MI6 agent-turned-cyber-terrorist hell bent on revenge against M for sacrificing him on an espionage mission during the Hong Kong hand-off. As Silva starts killing off the agents identified on the disc, he arrives in London with the intent of publicly executing M, so Bond escapes with her to his childhood manor in the Scottish Highlands which gives the film its name. The story up to this point is genuinely thrilling, but by the time we get to the climax at Skyfall, the movie loses steam and most essentially, creative invention. It becomes an over-the-top conflagration in more ways than one leading to an inevitably fatalistic encounter in a chapel.<br /><br />What also struck me about this movie was the scarcity of Bond girls - only two, neither of whom figures in the climax - but then it dawned on me that Mendes and screenwriters Neal Purvis, Robert Wade and John Logan have really set up M as the ultimate Bond girl. Judi Dench has far more screen time in this film than in her other appearances, and she allows us a glimpse behind the starchy Machiavellian mother figure she has played so adroitly. As Silva, Javier Bardem sports another bad haircut (and a dye job this time) to play a Bond villain that balances precariously between menacing and campy. His fey manner and come-on scene with Bond are amusing enough, but the disjointed nature of his role comes from the fact that his vengeance is directed far more at M, not Bond. Eurasian French actress B&eacute;r&eacute;nice Marlowe is stunning as Severine but only has one critical scene that allows her to show any dimension, while Naomie Harris ([[ASIN:B000VDDWEC 28 Days Later]]) lends comely grit to Eve even if mainly on the sidelines.<br /><br />In an extended cameo that seems to beg for the return of Sean Connery (who would have been too distracting had he been cast), an almost unrecognizable Albert Finney plays Kincade, the resourceful gameskeeper of the Skyfall estate, in avuncular fashion. Ralph Fiennes shows up as an intelligence officer with the authority to determine the future of MI6, but it's clear his character is being set up for the next entry in the series. Joining Connery on the pantheon of 007s, Craig is really making his interpretation of Bond uniquely his own as the super-agent goes through what amounts to a mid-life crisis. Cinematographer Roger Deakins, who has provided expert lens work to previous Mendes projects like [[ASIN:B002DJROQE Revolutionary Road]], captures the richness of the exotic locales - Shanghai, Macao, Istanbul, a deserted island in ruins, and even the Scottish highlands - with fluid dexterity. The film runs long at 143 minutes, especially since the last half-hour does not keep up the momentum built up to that point. The more important takeaway, however, is that the film is successful in whetting one's appetite for the 24th installment in the series.specially since the last half-hour does not keep up the momentum built up to that point.

The cold harsh environment that they are forced into had me hoping the best for them.  The fight with the elements and nature brings you to the core of the survival instinct and the desire to fight on no matter the impossible odds. Must See.
B00000IREA|3.0|A bizarre bit  of fantasy/sci fi with some elements of entertainment but the movie is unique.  Jane Fonda as the chick she was originally noted to be.  Funny how cinema always chooses to portray an attractive man with little clothing as feminine and hairless referring to the male angel in the movie.
B00A6N7QIA|4.0|As the unrated version...wow!!  ok it is bloody at times abit gory, but not the sex scenes. It brings you into the story and hooks you til the end.  Not for family viewing for sure, but if you want a story that keeps you engaged this is one you should see.  Had not heard of it prior to seeing it but it had me to the end.  4 stars because of the violence but 5 stars for the story line. John T. and Selma H. great performance as with the rest of the actors.  Hint: pay attention to the story line it'll keep you watching.

B005ZOBNOI|5.0|You never know when the end is near, so read this book before you die. You will never be the same again.
B009NQKPUW|3.0|The plot was choppy and the cast seemed to ramble at times. Overall, I found it somewhat interesting, especially the ending.
B0097GVJWQ|4.0|I enjoyed the game but one thing thet bugged me was that you had to go all through the steps to get to places. you should just be able to click on the map and travel there.
B008458O3S|4.0|Some are simple, some are hard.  All of these are fun to work out.  Keeps your brain in top shape!
B0058EBNAO|5.0|This is the best weather app I have found, both for daily weather and for the forecast.<br />I have used this app for some time and like all the features of the app.  The widget is on my homepage.

B005CRQ4GU|4.0|this book was really good I gave it 4/5 because I wish there were different things going in his life I liked how his uncle was ubsessed with scratch tickets and in the future of these books I hope he is in them.
B009WO7NQO|4.0|I LOVE Angry Birds.  I have found all the fruits/eggs and have 3 stars on all the other games.  Star Wars is a much bigger challenge.  But I still really like it.  If you like any of the Angry Birds you will like it even better with the Star Wars theme, so creative!!
1594744769|3.0|Jacob's grandfather is a bit strange and tells stories that could not possibly be true. After his grandfather is killed and Jacob sees something strange, he decides to go find Miss Peregrine, the mistress of a children's home during World War II, where his grandfather lived for a short period of time. He finds an old abandoned house, destroyed by a bombing in 1940. No one ever comes near the house, or so Jacob thought. Are the children still alive? Impossible. Or is it?<br /><br />This is a slow book, by no means a page turner. It is a book I imagine keeping next to my bed and reading little by little. In addition, it is basically a mystery, which is not my cup of tea. I did enjoy many parts of the book, but I cannot include any detail without spoilers, and I don't like to include spoilers in my reviews.<br /><br />The writing is outstanding. Riggs develops the characters so well and his use of old pictures makes them practically jump off the pages. Each of the characters is fascinating and it would have been wonderful to hear more about them. Although based on the elaborate story Riggs creates, it is quite possible that the reader will get more background information in a sequel. I have heard of no plans for sequels, but he definitely left the door wide open for one.<br /><br />Finally, this is a really good mystery. There are several surprises, plus a big one toward the end. I am sure mystery lovers will enjoy this book tremendously.<br /><br />I apologize this review is choppy, but because I decided not to include spoilers, I am trying to tiptoe around many of the details. Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children is not one of my favorites, but I am glad I read it and will probably read a sequel if Riggs indeed writes one. What I would be most interested in reading about would most likely be found in subsequent books.
B009SQQRH2|4.0|great movie for everyone. lots of action humor and good story line.really good movie. that's all I have to say
B008Y1YK9Y|5.0|Saw the movie in the theaters and found it to be thoughtful and provides the watcher with many surprises especially at the end
B004J4WKTW|4.0|This book was amazing and as I don't very much enjoy a regular circus I now wish Le Cirque Des Reves  was real. The intamacy was so real between Celia and Marco and the book was well written but not having it in chronological order was a bit confusing.
0345803485|1.0|I cannot express how bad this book was. And no-I was not offended by the sex scenes. It's just that they're completely meaningless and so overdone that they become mind numbing after a few chapters. It's like someone with a third grade education tried to write NC-17 material.<br /><br />This book was and is a twilight fanfiction. How the author got away with publishing it is beyond me. Basically the publisher changed the names and printed it. Edward I mean Christian's father is a doctor named...Carrick. He has a quirky sister who adores Bella I mean Ana. There is a younger hot Spanish guy who's 'just a friend' who is in love with her, named Jose. Her father is a loner who loves to fish...sound familiar?  Talk about lazy and unoriginal. It was pulled from a popular fanfiction site on the internet. Really? Can't people come up with there own ideas? twilight is one of my favorite books-so I am not a literary snob by any means. But this makes twilight look like Shakespeare.<br /><br />There is not a single likable character in the book. Christian could have been interesting if he had any real qualities. A note to the author- rich businessmen don't become rich by taking calls in the next room a few times every couple chapters. Typical example of someone writing about a subject they know nothing about. She could have made a few calls to find out how real business' are actually run, may have added some believability to the story. And Ana is your typical 'heroine' who thinks she is plain but every guy she meets is magically in love with her. Not terribly believable. What's to like? She is a cardboard cutout, less interesting version of Bella. She doesn't even come off as a nice person. She just picks fights with Christian for no reason, giving them an excuse for makeup sex.<br /><br />Unless you are looking for a book with explicit sex scenes, skip this series. I would give it negative stars if I could. I read the whole series to see what the hoopla was about-and as bad asthis book is, the sequels are infinitely worse. Avoid at all costs.
B0058YPLA2|5.0|I didn't think this had a chance when it first started , but it's a big success and it's even better in it's second series. This one looks great on blu ray and it has good extra features. The cast in this one is a really good one. They help weave the intricate back and forth storylines of the many characters in this show. That helps to make this one of the largest in depth character shows since lost. The interplay between the past and present is quite interesting and the struggle to wake up the townspeople to who they really are is well worth the payoff. In fact they could have kept the storyline going for one more series but decided to open it up , which took guts to be sure. The fairy tale storys are interwoven with lewis carrol stories as well as peter pan stories. They haven't added the 'wizard of oz' yet though! Still this is a adult drama and characters do die and have to deal with their relationships as well. This one beat the odds to become a hit and it deserves that status. The effects are top notch too. and thanks to the state of technology today more and more shows monsters and such look real or close to real. They couldn't have done this show justice 10 years ago tech wise. I can only imagine what is coming in the future. At least we have this fine show to watch that will hopefully enchant us for many seasons to come! the blu ray is way up in quality as far compared to the dvd set. Get it because this show is filled with beautiful vistas and scenery etc and dvd just won't cut it.
B009G7ZYPY|5.0|I just want to add my two cents and review this album as well .<br /> So many people seem to have grasped the essence of this album and said it so beautifully so I will not even try to compete with them  I do agree that she seems to be in her element on this album . Sometimes her voice seems a wee bit wobbley but it might be my CD player and not her at all /<br /> I am so happy she is getting the credit she deserves . Thank you all it is so nice to read positive reviews from the Amazon  reviewers .<br />  I gave her 5 stars and she deserves every one of them . I also agree She and Donny Osmond make a great team !!<br /> I am back to buy another CD to play in my Car >>!!
B009VSW15Y|2.0|Did not work very well for me.<br />Took ok picture of my dog and accidentally one of myself that was very easy to delete.<br />The functions are easy to use.<br />I had trouble watching movies on prime and deleted the camera app and have never had another problem.<br />I have to believe it was this app that caused my video problem?<br />Nothing else helped and since it happened right after adding camera app I deleted and great picture on video again?<br />I hope Amazon comes out with a camera app just for there kindles!
B001NLKXK2|4.0|I enjoyed this book even though it was very depressing.  I have never know anyone with Alzheimers Disease and didn't know much about it, so it was enlightening in that respect.  Ms. Genova did a great job,  without being morbid, in describing this sad condition.
B009FZHYKU|4.0|I liked the episode because it helped tie up a few loose ends on some of the characters. Merle is just a typical bully.<br />Andrea's character gets more developed in this episode.<br />Mashonne (not sure about the spelling of her name) is an interesting character. I hope they don't kill her off any time soon. she's are real fighter and survivor.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This was a page turner, I could not put it down.  There were many twists and turns and a surprise on every page.
B009YU62H2|4.0|Musically, this is a great album. Vocally, this isn't Chris' best work. I understand he is older and his voice is well &#34;used&#34;. It is nice to hear Soundgarden back together again. I picked this album up on sale as a $3.99 MP3, and better yet, I had a $5 credit, so I got it for free. Even better. If you are a fan of this band, you need to pick this up.
6305882592|5.0|GREAT movie. I don't think I could ever get sick of this. The acting is great, and the soundtrack is better. Cat Stevens music made this movie 100% perfect.
B009D5VNLS|5.0|I would definitely recommend seeing this movie...loved it and its a great family movie and teaches a good lessons to young kids..
B00006FDCD|5.0|GREAT MOVIE!! Stephen King really did a great job of getting in your mind with this one. It's long, but it seems like only an hour goes by. Better than TV. NO COMMERCIALS!
B008NABUU8|5.0|This and Dummy Defense are the best physics games I know of for Kindle Fire.  This game is not quick and easy.  The levels will take much time and focus.  Not for most people but I LOVE these kind of games.  Get it now.
B008CYDD7I|5.0|Classic cult classic movie. The acting is cheesy, but that makes the movie. It's never boring, and something to watch on a dark night all alone.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|This is one of the few games I actually play more than once.  Stop reading reviews and just get it.
B0042J6VUS|3.0|It's just okay. You have to open the clip slowly and don't force the phone it. They break kind of easy.
B008D28HYS|5.0|This game is super hard.  Levels will take you hours.  Certainly not for everyone but definitely worth checking out.  I love this game.
B004EPZ08O|5.0|Great movie. This was one of the best movies. It answers a lot of questions you have from all the other ones. Well worth getting.
B007TML4EI|5.0|I love physics games and this one is the best Ive played.  I beat it in a couple days though.  Wish there were more levels.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|This is the perfect time killer game app. I really like how it starts quickly and you can easily leave it and come back to where you were.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Its just like those games at the fair that we love to dump quarters into.  Cant stop playing it, I guess that means its good?  Lol stop reading reviews and just download it.
B007KQI1NA|5.0|I use this with free open source software and the NOAA raster and vector charts. Works great without cell or wifi
B0087HT36U|3.0|For those of you who dont know, this game is very similar to Angry Birds in the means that you are throwing objects at a structure attempting to destroy it.  Instead of birds you have rocks, acid, poison, and hooks.  Instead of pigs you have people.  And instead of viewing from the side you are at a first-person style view.<br /><br />Overall, Not nearly as fun or challenging as Angry Birds but worth the free download.
B006YXTRHY|5.0|they did such a good job with this movie. such an improvement from the first movie. especially for three size of this book, I'm so glad they made this two movies
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|i love this game! literally can't stop playing it! i only downloaded it a couple days ago &amp; i'm already to level 23. so fun. i love that it's a free download that truly is free  no need to make any in app purchases to continue playing or get to the next level. download this one for sure! you won't be disappointed!
B001SN78JO|5.0|this movie is a great family movie.  it is pretty inspiring as well and makes you want to live your live to the fullest.  if you like jim carrey, you will certainly like this movie as well.  no complaints.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|This game is perfect for a bit of mindless fun. I play this at dialysis and at the doctor's office. At home I can't play it alone because the kids keep crowding around, wanting to play, too. Fun and addictive!
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|Watched it my mother and daughter on a quiet Saturday night.  One of the best Disney movies of all time!  The characters, features and colors are all so real!  Finally a girl movie that may have to do with love but not focusing on prince charming, yet a smart, funny, brave and beautiful young girl!

B004RLPTT0|5.0|Awesome Movie, Wonderful tracks, there should be no dislike on this soundtrack. The digital booklet it awesome too. Must have soundtrack.
0375703764|5.0|This book will be unlike anything you have ever read before. You must abandon your expectations of plot, structure, narrative, or reason. Think of it as something to explore rather than read. Come to it virgin, without judgment, and let it terrify you. It is the most frightening thing I have ever consumed in media.
B0086700CM|5.0|OMG!!!!!!!! I LOVE THIS GAME it is so much fun its popular at my school get it it is fun so far my score is in the 200 !!!!!!!!:)

B007FEFLTO|5.0|Just wonderfull. Much better then \\"Fall of Giants\\", in my humble opinion.<br />I was looking forward to read this book asap , ordered it in advance, and started<br />to read it on the day it was released. I wanted to finish it asap , but felt sad<br />when I actually did. Can't wait for book number 3.<br />Mr. Follet is simply one of my favourite authors of all time !!!
B00338QENI|5.0|Excellent writing combining the Lack's family story with the science of genes.  Made me realize how much biology I have forgotten since high school.  Ms. Skloot did an excellent job making the story of genes and science come alive.
B005LAJ17M|5.0|I watched Homeland on demand thru my cable right before season 2 started and had to own season 1.  There are no words to describe the exceptional quality of this superb drama.  It truly deserved to win the Emmy for Best Drama series.  Many say it is an alternative to the show 24 for viewers in need of an addictive action show.  This show is indeed addictive and also indeed an action tour de force.  But instead the story it tells is very timely and realistic to the current world problems.  It deals with terrorism and the CIA and provides an excellent backdrop into the subject matter that most viewers aren't aware of.<br /><br />The basic plot is that CIA agent Carrie Mathison (played by Claire Daines) suspects that returning resued American POW Nicholas Brody (played by Damian Lewis) is actually working for Al Qaeda and planning on assisting in another attack on the US.  This in itself is a heartsopping enthralling story but Homeland does something new and amazing here.  It deals with mental illness with the seriousness and the realism it deserves.  Carrie is Bipolar and her illness is a huge part of the show.  Bipolar is shown in exceptional dettail as to how its sufferers go from amazing manic highs to severe depressive lows and many spots in between.  The writers do a superb job on every aspect of this show but the true shining star is Claire Danes.  She brings an intelligent intensity to the character of Carrie and her performance is truly spellbinding.  She also brings true awareness to Bipolar as not just a plot twist but as an illness many don't understand.  She becomes Carrie and the Emmy she won was truly deserved.  Damian Lewis also won an Emmy and is also excellent.<br /><br />The blu ray indeed far surpasses the dvd in video and audio presentation.  The show provides excellent quality when viewed on tv in HD but the blu ray takes that and raises the bar by 100%.  The clarity of facial expressions, scenery and environment is great.  The black/white ratio is excellent and colors are pure and strong while flesh tones are realistic and crisp.  Close ups are amazing.  This show is dialogue driven and the audio is also excellent.  All dialogue is strong and clear and the surround speakers are utilized strong and realistically when action does happen.  This is a superb series and one that deserves to be a part of your home collection.  From the intense story to the amazing Claire Danes this show is a must own and the blu ray is the way to go.s excellent and colors are pure and strong while flesh tones are realistic and crisp.

B00A77II0U|5.0|I thought this was a great game! I wish there were more like it. It was almost like an escape the room game.
B001NLKWLW|5.0|The unique and colorful use of words delights the mind and memory!  She treats inanimate objects as if they were human in a descriptive manner!  The intertwining of the stories forces your mind to interconnect but does not defeat the story element.  The contrasts of characters is alluring and combines the elements of opposites and harmony in an exquisite twisting of events.
B003QSOFFO|5.0|I love Disney movies! I am so happy that Amazon has these  movies on the internet when I have a craving.
B009CG2YDE|4.0|playing through the first couple of levels in bed was very hard to control.  when I sat up it was still not great, but better.  I love this kind of retro feel games and not a bad example.
B009HV2JT8|1.0|Uh this sucked. Bad movie with a bad plot. I would only recommend this if you are in to low budget movies.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|great show. love watching it. wish it was automatically avail after it airs for ppl who pay per episode. l
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I feel like I shouldn't have to say anything about it, but I have six more words....six more words. Done.
B008KE3960|5.0|I could have used a bit more instruction especially on the hire levels where you need to purchase with real money, Ammo,bombs & other stuff. I don't know how this works , but till you do watch carefully what you click on. After playing and learning how to manage I have come to love it and see now it can be done with out money. I love to strap in and fly the missions!
0547884591|4.0|I ordered the kindle version and the hard copy. The hard copy just arrived yesterday and I must say it is way better than the kindle version.  So If you are going to get this book, it's really worth paying a bit more for the hard copy.  So should you buy this book? Go to Tim Ferris's blog, if you find it interesting then get the book. Just as a clarification, the book is not a compilation of slow carb recipes, it is more than that. He discusses how to learn languages, reviews survival gear, how to memorize long numbers..etc.  I found the recipes, especially the advanced ones to be pretty cool. Personally, I liked this book, and that is why I give it a high rating. I didn't give it 5 stars just because some of the material in the 4 hour chef is covered in the 4 hour body, and mainly because there is just some material in there that I have a hard time believing...like \\"how to shoot a 3 Pointer in 48 hours...\\" .  Either way it's a fun read...I find Tim to be pretty funny...and kind of sexy :)  I am glad I got the book...but I will say this is definetely not a book for everyone. Like I said go to his Blog, and then you will know.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|In an effort to save money I got rid of cable a few years ago. I've been getting my television and movie fix via Netflix and Redbox for the last 3 years and have really not missed cable at all. This series is the 1st time I've been physically incapable of waiting for the the series to show up on Netflix and have resorted to purchasing each episode on Amazon. It is absolutely worth it and I do not regret 1 cent. A nail-biting, gory, yet dramatically superior good time. Definitely 1 of the most entertaining weekly 50 minutes of television you will ever see.  It does not disappoint.
B006DJ2JSI|1.0|This dictionary is not a default dictionary as advertised by Amazon - it does do what Amazon claims it is supposed to do which makes it useless. Amazon says that by holding the cursor over a word in a book that I am reading the definition comes from Merriam-Webster. Well, it doesn't  and that sucks. I returned the book. I like to find a dictionary that gives me definitions of words when I hold the cursor over a text that I am reading.
B0011Z1BTW|5.0|Zeppelin has always been my favorite.. They were the biggest influence in my music.. This soundtrack has been a favorite since the movie..
B00A81NFAS|4.0|SILVER LININGS PLAYBOOK is a feel-good movie about mental illness.  It does an excellent job of showing folks who are just barely capable of living in society due to their various afflictions, but then it implies that just some peace, love and understanding are all that's really needed to push the problems away.<br /><br />We meet Pat (Bradley Cooper) as his mother (Jacki Weaver) is signing him out of an institution he has living in for the past 8 months.  He is, it would seem, severely bi-polar and but is obsessed with the idea of reuniting with his wife (who cheated on him and now has a restraining order against him, since he beat the snot out of the guy who cuckolded him).  To this end, he has developed a strategy of working out and of looking for the silver lining in bad situations.  He's trying to a) reshape his body, and apparently he has lost some weight & b) change his way of thinking.  He's able to stick with his running, but struggles a bit more with his internal life.  His illness has turned him into a deeply humorless person...everything that is said he either twists into being about him, or he doesn't listen to it if it isn't directly relevant to him.  He doesn't really joke or understand jokes.  Everyone is out to thwart what he's working on.  And heaven forbid anyone imply that he's not going to reunite with his wife...he's focused like a laser on that idea, and if something gets in his way, he either gets confused or lashes out in anger.<br /><br />His mother brings him home, where his father (Robert DeNiro) awaits.  This man has serious OCD, and is one of those sports fans who believes things like the way he holds his remote control can affect the outcome of his beloved Philadelphia sports games.  He is also a small-time bookie who enjoys making bets himself.  His is a modest tyrant of his household, thus making everyone a slave to his compulsions.  He isn't quite as overtly ill as his son, but that may be because he has more years of living with his illness under his belt.<br /><br />One day, Pat is introduced to Tiffany (Jennifer Lawrence), a volatile young widow with some fairly serious issues of her own to overcome.  She has recently lost her job due to sleeping with EVERYONE in her office, and now she is somewhat adrift.  She latches on to Pat, and manipulates him into being her dance partner for an upcoming competition.<br /><br />The movie is HIGHLY entertaining.  Writer/director David O. Russell continues to show that he has a nice eye for middle-class, working-stiff neighborhoods (as in THE FIGHTER).  He's got a great ear for dialogue that his great cast can really chew into, and his directing style is unobtrusive.  I note this, because he CAN direct movies that have very strong visual flair (the fantastic THREE KINGS)...but that isn't needed for SILVER LININGS.  This is a character driven film.  It's a drama with plenty of comedy.  It's a romance with a minimum of saccharine.  I say minimum, because sadly, there is some in what I think is a far too neat and tidy ending.  The movie spends so much time showing how untidy and messy the lives of all these characters are, and it betrays that very carefully developed understanding. I assume the movie has the same ending as the book it was based on.<br /><br />The real fun of the film IS the performances...watching these actors tear into the great dialogue.  Bradley Cooper has never been one of my favorites.  He's often very smug and self-satisfied in a way that seems to be more about him than his characters.  But here, he's brought a bit down to earth, and is thus quite effective.  While I don't agree with the Oscar-buzz I've been hearing about him, he is very good.  I DO agree with the buzz about Jennifer Lawrence.  With this film, THE HUNGER GAMES and WINTER'S BONE, there need no longer be any debate about her versatility and value...she is one of the top young actresses of the day.  Now all she needs is a flat-out comedy or farce, and she'll have tackled everything.  And Robert DeNiro is back!  For years now, he's been collecting paychecks by impersonating himself.  He was very funny in MEET THE PARENTS and ANALYSE THIS, but those roles seemed fresh and funny and self-effacing.  Then those roles were ALL he did.  Comedies where he played the Robert DeNiro character.  Or he'd do something like RIGHTEOUS KILL, a more serious movie that required him to do little more than glower and look menacing.  But Russell has gotten a serious, fully-rounded performance from him here, and he's great.  For me, a big DeNiro fan, that alone makes the movie worthwhile...to show that DeNiro still has the chops and the will to give a great performance.  I just hope he does more of this.  And Jacki Weaver, as the mom, is great as well.  She gives DeNiro a great character to play off of.<br /><br />Despite my reservations about the ending, I have no hesitancy in saying that this is a movie well-worth seeing.d everything.

B009FZHYKU|5.0|Season 3 is full of unexpected surprises and continues to develop an already intense story. It is an awesome show.
B009X00E18|3.0|I'm constantly amazed at what these tablet/phone accessories cost.  Wow!  (And yes, I was given this product for free in exchange for a review...I consider myself lucky, because I would not have paid $56 for it, which is the price at this moment.)  There isn't really all that much to this case in terms of either material or design & engineering.  By now, these tablet cases are all just minor variations on the same theme.<br /><br />As Amazon says \\"It's the best of both worlds: a hard back shell for durable protection fused to a folio lid that stands your Amazon tablet for hands-free viewing. The smooth metallic finish on the back shell adds eye-catching color to your new Kindle tablet.\\"  That's pretty much what all cases are aspiring to do, unless the also include a built-in keyboard.  Protection, plus a way to prop up the tablet so you can view it without holding it.<br /><br />But, enough ranting.  Marware's shell is attractive and sleek.  My new Fire snapped into it very nicely and I feel it's being held securely.  The flap that serves as a front cover offers less tough protection, but it would keep your screen from getting scratched and such while not in use.  This flap folds into the stand, and it performs this function just \\"okay\\".  The flap feels like it barely stays in the hard case when making its stand, and if you were to bump your tablet just a little, the whole thing would collapse.  For me, the main function I want is the protection of the tablet, and for that, this case works well.<br /><br />I understand there are other colors beside the black, and that IS nice.  I probably would have gone with black if I'd had a choice of several colors, but the option to personalize just a bit is a plus.<br /><br />I haven't tried all the various cases out there, but for the functionality I've described, I think the Marware case serves just fine...if the price doesn't stop you.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I really liked this book.  It was a very good read.  It kept my attention and kept me wanting more.
B004AV4IF8|5.0|Not usually a fan of pop music, but Christina's voice is simply amazing! Highly recommended for fans of good vocalists.
B003O86FMW|1.0|This book is def not as good as the first one. Save your money.  It's hard to get into this one.
B004BRQYJ4|5.0|Love the movie & kept watching it to hear the music. Picked up the soundtrack & am in no way disappointed! CHEF & CHRISTINA.... I want more!!
B0013UDGZM|3.0|I am not sure how this show didn't make more than 2 seasons. It is pretty cool and definitely worth watching. The only drawback is that John seems a bit petulant and difficult to like (unlike the boy in T2). You also MUST suspend disbelief; physics don't work here and the plots often have glaring holes. Why watch it if there are problems? It is cotton candy for the mind that should just be enjoyed. I remember this series when it was first run; they moved it from time slot to time slot making it very difficult to keep track of. At least now we can watch it in sequence and without commercials. Give it a watch, you won't be disappointed.
B008FPOIT6|4.0|I love this kind of book with puzzles to figure out. The author did a good job of hooking me in at the beginning.  But of course the beginning promised so much that it was almost an impossible task to deliver on that promise.  So maybe I am being a bit harsh in withholding that final star, because Sloan can write, but I was a bit let down in the end and felt like the tying up of all the loose ends at the end was  almost breathlessly rushed.  I realize it's not easy to tie up so many story arcs.  Keep writing Robin Sloan, you are talented.  I can see this as a movie.
B000002O4X|5.0|This was one of my all time favorite movies with two of my favorite stars.  AND THE MUSIC!  Absolutely beautiful!!!  Saw the movie again when it aired recently on T.V. and had was reminded of that haunting score.  Decided that I had to have it and bought it.  I copied it to my car C.D. player and I play it all the time.  LOVE IT!!!!
0756407125|5.0|Once in a while, I come across a magical book.  This might mean that it is a fantasy book with magic as part of the plot line or it might mean that it is written so well that the words themselves are magic.  In the case of \\"The Wise Man's Fear,\\" it means both.<br /><br />I read both [[ASIN:B007HI3I4I The Name of the Wind]] and this continuance of the Kingkiller Chronicle recently at the urging of my oldest son.  I have to say that the fantasy genre is usually not one I delve too deeply into.  But I'm usually not led wrong by my son and I wasn't this time.  What a mind journey into a mystical world.  It was a long journey - this book was close to a 1,000 pages.  But I still wanted it to continue.  I especially enjoyed Kvothe's time with Tempi, the Adem and the Lethani.<br /><br />The language, the characters, the setting - all are perfect.  I am going to have a very hard time waiting for the final book in the trilogy.
B009S8PEHY|3.0|Being this is the first christmas album by Rod Stewart, would expect it to be a little more upbeat. Most of the songs are slower and not what I would have expected from Rod Stewart. Overall, not a bad album to add to the collection
B005LAIHXQ|3.0|The time is 2094 and we head into pre-Alien adventure land.<br /><br />The special effects in \\"Prometheus\\" made it worthwhile to watch this movie.  Otherwise, it was a real yawner to me.  Plot holes and mediocre acting by some otherwise fine actors (Charlize Theron, Noomi Rapace, Michael Fassbender).  I was expecting a much better movie after seeing the promos but alas, all I got to see were some really stupid moves by the explorers of this planet, a really (excellent) cringe-worthy \\"baby\\" birth and very little connection to the original Alien franchise.<br /><br />It wasn't totally awful but it could have been so much better.
B000001FKF|5.0|Recieved this on Saturday November 24. Packaged was sealed and packed in protection envelopes. Recieved fast and in great shape. Recomend to everyone.
B005NNV044|5.0|Simply an incredible body of work. Still enjoying after listening to it initially over 30 years ago. You will love this!
B007REV4T8|1.0|By far the worst Bond since Goldeneye, possibly as bad as that. The new Q is ridiculous.  The movie starts off fairly well but by the middle is completely lost and the ending is a joke.  Gimme a time machine please because I want James Bond back--
B009YU62H2|5.0|If you like Soundgarden, then this CD will not disappoint you. After 15 years, the boys really do an incredible job cranking out fresh tunes that remain true to their roots!
B000NGTJTY|5.0|What a rat on a wheel movie. You are left guessing, hanging on throughout this sleeper movie. Jack Nicholson is classic, as always. He doesn't disappoint. The two younger actors ran full speed to keep up on this one. Enjoy!
B009K0P10K|4.0|I still enjoy this show. Many times shows lose their spark but this doesn't seem to be case for Revenge.
0786915749|4.0|I read through the original three Chronicles when I was eleven or twelve years old. They immediately captured my imagination, and I found myself enraptured by the adventures of the strange fellowship of characters (with the goofy kender, Tas, being my favorite). The authors, Weiss and Hickman, did a fine job of crafting a vivid tale that was perfect for engaging the mind of a young boy, and I read the entire series several times through my teenage years.<br /><br />Recently, at the age of 32, I listened to the entire trilogy on audio book. I was happy to find that the adventures of the companions were still enjoyable, although not nearly as much so as when I was a child. There were a few too many cliches for me to rate the series as \\"amazing\\" by contemporary standards (one of the villains is even named \\"Verminard\\"... ugh), but this by no means makes the series a poor one. By all measures, the Chronicles is still a staple of literary fantasy, and it packs more action than most of its brethren, with far less filler. This, in particular, is one of the things that I think makes this Dragonlance series so enjoyable for young readers (plus, they're only about 400 pages each, as opposed to some of the obscenely lengthy fantasy tomes). I would still strongly recommend the Chronicles for young readers who are interested in fantasy.
B005LLSNNE|4.0|This is a good series, edgy and having lots of plot twists, It reminds me a lot of &#34;Deadwood&#34;. It even has some of the same actors, which I suppose is no coincidence. As with &#34;Deadwood&#34;, I think the casting is exceptional.
145162445X|1.0|First off, let's pray for this man.  I don't even no where to \\"begin\\" (pardon the pun)  Let's start with the preface, \\"he says, Who created the creator?\\"  that question makes absolutely no sense.  Asking when the eternal God didn't exists, doy.  Then in the preface he says, the existence or non-existence of a creator is independent of our desires.  Actually Lawrence, you have it backward, the existence of Jesus is not dependent on our desires.  The right answer to the wrong question is always wrong.  Then he states also that the laws of physics COULD, we're talkin science here not philosophy bud.  he says could probe new scales through physics. but we simply don't know.  He admits there are some things we don't know so actually we know that we don't know-epistemological suicide.  That alone proves absolutes.  then he says THE FUNNIEST THING I HAVE EVER HEARD, something from nothin MAY have been required for the universe to come into being.  Then he says nothing upsets the philosophers and Theologians more than the notion of what truly \\"nothing\\" is.  When he quotes that he's being philosophical, so don't try to play this scientists vs Theologians game.  Science is about the interpretation of facts.  then he says something funny again \\"everyone now knows the universe is 13.72 (i love the .72 makes look \\"scientific\\") billion years old.  Another lie, or unintentional interpretation of the facts.  This book tries to disprove hell.  If you want evidence for the Bible, just google in search of the real mt sinai and look at the archaeological evidence, i could keep going but, people seem to believe what they want to believe not what's actually true.  And on judgement day that's not gona work.  Jesus loves us and payed our death, trust Him, and follow Him and it's all safe.  I would have no problem if hell didn't exists but that's not reality.  My name is John at oregonrulz@hotmail.com, I'm only in community college and I'm not sayin this to be a smartass but I'd debate thisguy in a heart beat, Truth isn't afraid of anything so I hope someone learned beware of lies.
B000SEGUDE|5.0|Gripping, thoughtful and engaging.  Had doubts about the style at points, where the story structure seemed a bit gimmicky, but paid off for the most part at the end.  Would recommend to anyone.
B004YRSBTW|4.0|The name Christopher Nolan says it all. If you enjoy a thought provoking film, Christopher Nolan is the way to go. And this film doesn't disappoint.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Vince Flynn has never disappointed.  I believe I have read all of his books.  This author just hits my patriotic nerve with the right tune.
B009RI4FRU|5.0|This film is the one where it all comes together. The ambiance, the soundtrack, solid ensemble acting all around the board, the off kilter Anderson dialogue - and the perfect chapterlike directing by Anderson. He put his experience with Mr. Fox to use here but doesn't sacrifice some of the occasional &#34;brutish reality &#34; aspects present in most other Anderson films. Moonrise Kingdom is the one that pushes Anderson over the edge from excellent director to iconic director. Highest recommendation!
B008RYN44U|2.0|When I heard the news of a New Doubt album, I was excited. My thoughts were how great it is that ska would reach out back into the mainstream, but after listening to it, I was wrong. It seemed as the pop sound of Gwen Stafani's solo career bled into the sound of the band, I found the songs unenjoyable to listen to in honesty.<br /><br />While current female Gwen fans will get a kick out if the album, long time fans will be disappointed.
B008602KQI|4.0|Although the movie does have differences than the book, it was still a good movie in itself.my fiance and I both liked it. He hadn't read the book and there were a few parts I had to whisper a few supporting details to make it a little clearer and set the stage for what was to come but it was still an entertaining enough movie on its own.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|Even better than the first season and that says a lot Thanks Ryan Murphy and Brad Fall a chuk s
B0085TKAW6|2.0|This is the second novel in the series. It has all the hallmarks of a rushed job. It's as though Follett has just used the first novel, which was very good, as a template, just shuffling the characters and events around, to fit the WW2 scenario. I expected a better job from a writer of this caliber.
B0086700CM|5.0|my aunt had it and o beat the high score!!!!!!!!!! no one can beat it then I new I had to get it and so I did get it u will have fun trust me!!!!!!!
B002RI9MZC|5.0|This book takes the reader on a journey through modern politics and art, using finely drawn characters. Full of adventure and colour. truly hard to put down, I will be reading this again,and again.
B000NQRE1E|5.0|Seen this movie before and liked it, looked for it at the store but too expensive, saw it here on sale and couldn't let it pass so I bought and the movie is fantastic!
B003L77GGK|3.0|I've been an avid fan since 9/13/2005. I own every season, with that being said this is not the SPN I fell in love with.  The first mistake was the season premiere, there was no \\"Road So Far\\" and rock music recapping season 5. That is a huge part of the show, we as fans look forward to that well at least I do.  Then you got \\"The Campbells\\" that was just a terrible idea, I cheered when they all got axed. The big bad for season 6 was just awful, \\"The Mother of All Creatures\\" seriously. The brothers chemistry was so not there especially the first half of the season, we had to wait until the second half of the season to see that heart wrenching hug between Sam and Dean. I applaud Jared on his acting, he was awesome as Soul less Sam. Out of 22 episodes I only truly enjoyed 6. Sera Gamble dropped the ball with this season and even season 7.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This is such a great trilogy! I would and have recommended this to everyone I know! Its such a great journey they take together.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Quick read and very interesting. Couldn't put it down! It was a little more technical than most books like this but of course it would be since it was written by a well educated medical Dr.
B009GESJH2|5.0|Where to begin with this one?!  Firstly, I had no coffee and I am cruising in my car; was really anxious to buy this cd..popped it in and WHAM!!  Chicken in the Pen isn't a subtle song and you should never be in a lazy mood and suddenly have this tune come at ya!  It wasn't a great opener.  The Mirror track nine is so beautiful you have to wonder why Kid Rock doesn't attempt more civility and passivity in his songs; they tend to be the most special ones.  Of course, we all love Kid Rock rocking out and it's gotten to the point that provocative lyrics are the norm for him and really lose the shock value.  Nonetheless I love Kid Rock and I really like this cd if for no other reason it's Kid Rock \\"rocking out\\" and nobody does this quite as well as he does.  Rock and Roll Jesus was \\"absolute brilliance\\" and a cherished cd in my collection although skipped up from overplaying it and I must get another one.  This CD sadly does not come close to Rock and Roll Jesus and if Kid Rock really wants a killer next cd he has to take the time to be thoughtful and innovative because he has proven he is capable of brilliance and we need more of that from him.  Get this though and give it loads of listens; I just know this one will grow on me.
B005NJU8PA|5.0|Tim Ferris is awesome end of story. Amazon publishing will succeed! Barnes and knoble are idiots, their loss. Great read!
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|Was upset at first that this season is a whole new story as I really liked last season.  But this season's even creepier and just better!  Can't wait for Season 3!
B006LSZECO|4.0|I liked the suspense and question of guilt throughout.  I was disappointed in the ending and thought the author perhaps couldn't quite decide to end the book, unrealistic ending.
B001OGLSBE|5.0|One of the best Wilco albums! Can't overstate the beautiful simplicity of the tracks here. Tweedy hits his stride on this one.
B00A12VW86|5.0|Have first one in series..waiting for the 3rd!  If you like Green Day, this one will not disappoint!  Get it
B0064W65SO|4.0|It was a very entertaining read but I never felt it found depth. The writing is solid and I loved the artwork.
B000FC1MCS|3.0|I understand what the authors intentions were and he did a great job with writing like someone with what can possibly be a character with Asperger's. I really would have loved more of the trials examined when trying to find his mom in London and also more elaboration on the dynamics between mother and father as seen through the child's eyes after his mom is found alive and wants to take part in his life.
B0048IMZMG|5.0|Love the songs on this cd. I love all Taylor Swift songs, and this cd has a bunch of her best
B001BC2ZS6|1.0|I do not know what all of the fuss is about this book. Every single page I read was an absolute yawn. I did not care what happened to any if the characters and I just did not care about any theme this book attempted to convey. For me, I got not one thing useful from reading this book. And I can usually find a little bit of a gem in everything I read. So not interested in reading Grapes of Wrath. Oh well, can't win 'em all!
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|This is a great family movie with a good story.  The colors add to this vivid experience.  The characters all build to a funny and interesting show.
B0015DROBO|5.0|Very detailed and sometimes it is easy to get caught up in the details. However, if you read with a more of a going with the flow attitude, then you will thoroughly enjoy this most intricate plot for one of the most fabulous thrillers ever written. Some of the material may make one squeamish, like myself, so even though I loved the book, it is a one time read for me.
B003XU3MWM|5.0|Good quality recording and we enjoyed the movie as well. I would recommend it to others and would watch it again
B00650SSDU|5.0|AMAZING...def a new favorite!!!! Sucha good movie!!!! I honestly wasn't expecting it to be this good! (: I just bought it today on DVD.
B006MQRLSA|2.0|A lot of stop and atart with the playback, lots of interruptions while it buffered. The movie itself was way too long and just kind of boring
B003JTHXOK|4.0|loved it! A thrilling page Turner,I couldn't put it down! Surprising and shocking twists especially at the end, but still a great read.
B0090EIC3Y|5.0|Quality fo film was good and the movie was great<br />It was a good purchase and we enjoyed it very much
B006ZDS7CE|5.0|This is like the best album I've e we bought. I love absolutely every single song and have no complaints whatsoever. Download was a breeze with iCloud and it's just perfect. Couldn't be happier.
B007BVMVDU|5.0|A lot of stop and start with the actual viewing, a lot of &#34;video loading&#34; type of messages at first. I t became smoother after a while. Enjoyed the series.
B0037QM8YA|1.0|I can't give this movie any stars because the movie would not load,so Amazon is not high on my list since they charged me for a movie that I told them would not load .and thet still charged me.so in my opinoin Amazon sucks and I will never use their services ever again
B009RI4ZKC|2.0|The quality of the movie was bad, a lot of digital breakup although it was supposed to be full HD and we have all of the required hardware for that. The movie itself did not appeal to me, either.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|DeMille never fails me. Once again he writes a book that I can't put down. Funny and action every page. I was thrilled with the ending.... I think more people should have died. If you read the book you know what I mean.
B009GESJH2|2.0|I should have seen this coming. It seems like with every new album, Kid Rock has moved further from Rock and closer to Country music. I am very disappointed with this disc. I have already deleted all but one song off my iPod. Even that one is iffy. Maybe it will grow on me like Born Free? I doubt it. I live in Detroit, Michigan and the song with the same name on this disc is just hard to stomach. I'm trying not to be too negative but this album is not for me. If you are going to buy this, at least do yourself a favor and listen to the samples first. It just might save you some money.
B007EECSFA|5.0|Wonderful and interesting book.  Couldn't put it down.  Would recommend to all.  Didn't want it to end.  Loved the way it switched back and forth from the present to the past..
B007FG9LIE|5.0|This book is amazing. The story is very good and keeps you guessing all the way to the end. I did not know what to expect from the description but was unable to put the book down.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I've read numerous novels by John Grisham and have yet to be disappointed! In the author comments, Mr. Grisham states that no research went into this one, but he uses great imagination to make a fiction novel into something that really could happen. Great story line!
B008M87GJK|5.0|Well written interesting stories. Nice choice of catagories making it easy to view just what I am the most interested in.I check often and find that it is updated.
B004GJDQT8|2.0|I would give the Amazon App a better rating if 1) my tablet didn't have to be online every time I wanted to use any of the apps I purchased through Amazon, and 2) if the Amazon App did not constantly run in background whenever my tablet is powered up.
1741751772|5.0|This is one of the best authors I have read. Have shared this and have converted several people. Will continue to read Kate's books and share them.
B000NQRE1E|5.0|TITANIC was just that. Escapist fare that served no other purpose than to entertain people. With a dash of 1940's sentimentality (the love triangle), and 2000 wizardry (the special effects), Titanic let's us leave the real world behind and sail off with Rose and Jack.<br /><br />As other reviewers have rightfully cited, we all know the story by now.  This version of Titanic does not add anything except it serves up the solid facts of what happened that April night back in 1912.  By creating fictional characters, it mysteriously manages to add to the story even though it neatly side steps most of the real passengers who were on board that faithful night.<br /><br />So, leaving the script and acting off to the side, I will comment on this Blu-ray version of the classic.<br /><br />In short, it is nothing but magnificent.  The images are crisp, clean and accurate. Now, Cameron did not go in for much in the way of color.  Yes, the iconic images of \\"I'm Flying\\" were painted in golden hues but the bulk of the movie is in white, black and various shades of grey.  But this DVD makes the colors and images so vivid and sharp you feel you can reach out and touch them.  When you do get into a more colorful area (Rose's cabin suite, for example), your eyes almost pop out from the lush richness of it all.<br /><br />A brilliant job of remastering and restoring.  The sound, however, could use some major tweaking but, on the whole, the story is now officially a classic and this Blu-ray version has assured its place there.
B0090CMMIC|5.0|I recently became a fan of Young Guns and after listening couple of their songs from &#34;Bones&#34; I purchased their album.  It definitively lived up to the expectations and every song is top-notch.  I really hope the band makes it huge in the US as their music is far better than most today.
B00992CF6W|5.0|this is an absolutely fantastic app! it's just like the PC version that my best friend has, except no villaigers and less mobs. I would totally reccomend, especially if you love the PC and Xbox versions.<br /><br />Pros:<br />lots of world generator seeds and different terrain<br />easy controls<br />new updates<br />flying is easy<br />lots of different blocks<br /><br />Cons:<br />no villiagers<br />only three types of animals<br />only four types of mobs<br />not as many blocks as PC<br />no animals or mobs or villaigers in Creative Mode<br />some generator seeds are not the same as on PC<br /><br />thank you for reading my review!
B0083SBJXS|5.0|The best quality of this plot is how the Avengers get together after being at odds with each other.  The best line comes from Captain America when told Thor and his nemesis are gods.  He replies, 'There's only one God, ma'm, and I'm pretty sure He doesn't dress like that.
1573229725|5.0|A great read!<br />Definately my favourite Sarah Waters book.<br />Love the movie too. One of those few books that you can<br />reread it and enjoy it everytime.<br />Really captures the feeling of old England life too.<br />Felt very real to me.
B00092ZMDY|5.0|Not only do they have an excellent selection of Eagles songs, there is a nice selection of individual hits.  Don Henley's hits include Boys Of Summer, All She  Wants To Do Is Dance, and a new song.  Joe Walsh includes Rocky Mountain Way and a song about the breaking of his 20 year habit of alcohol addiction.  They also include There's A Hole In The World, a tribute to 9/11.
B008OOYALE|3.0|dragon story is fun but i'm so annoyed because i neeeeeeeed gold but i don't want to pay for it
B0086700CM|5.0|co-worker introduced this game to me one day waiting around for a ride after work. lol been an addiction ever since &amp; I am not much of a game player. Fabulous fun!!!!! it is easy to play great graphics .
B00A8ECU24|5.0|It was amazing for bronies! Great graphics too! I would recommend it to a lot of people the only thing I don't like is they drawn like generation 1 ponies.
B008Q7O6VS|4.0|Yes it's hard to believe that it has been twenty years since Megadeth released \\"Countdown To Extinction\\", It was a creative peak for Megadeth at this time when you take in 1990's \\"Rust In Peace\\" and 1994's \\"Youthanasia\\". All three albums also featured what is considered the classic line up of Megadeth with Dave Mustaine, Marty Friedman, Dave Ellefson and drummer Nick Menza. \\"Countdown To Extinction\\" has already been re-mastered in 2004 with extra bonus/demo tracks however the overall mix left a lot to be desired so the good news is that twenty year version is taken from the original version and is not overly compressed, nor does it suffer from the dreaded loudness issue.<br /><br />\\"Countdown To Extinction\\" would give Megadeth some of their biggest hits ever, the brilliant \\"Symphony Of Destruction\\" leading the way. There is the brilliant \\"Foreclosure Of A Dream\\" with its slower pace and political theme it's a song that is a true now as it was back then. The album is packed with great songs such as \\"Sweating Bullets\\", \\"Countdown to Extinction\\" with its driving bass and album opener \\"Skin o' My Teeth\\". This version omits the bonus tracks that were included on the 2004 re-master.<br /><br />Also included is a second disc of a 1993 performance from the Cow Palace. It includes 16 live tracks as well as an intro and shows how tight that particular line up of Megadeth was. The live performance draws heavily from \\"Countdown To Extinction\\" but does include classics from their previous albums. Including a great version of \\"Holy Wars... The Punishment Due\\".<br /><br />With this new twenty year anniversary release Megadeth have fixed the problems of the 2004 re-master that in all honesty was mixed poorly. With this release the selling point is an excellent second disc of a live performance of the band at the peak of their powers. The two discs come in nice slip cases and there are cards of the four members as well as new liner notes. If you are a long time Megadeth fan you willwant to add this to your collection.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Among some of his more entertaining books. I enjoyed the characters and fast moving plot.<br />I would definitely recommend it to others.
B009CG2YDE|4.0|A very nice retro game with kind of a space invaders feel. Haven't seen many worthy free ones lately but this is definitely worth it.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|pretty good app...typical for this type of app. energy goes quickly for me. fills the time. good tine waster. duh
B0098VYCCE|1.0|Too solemn and gruesome for kids, and too trite and boring for adults. Considerable imagination and attention to detail went into the special effects, but the script was a relentless fusillade of cliches. It was as if the writers ransacked the archives for every lame and tired meme in movie-land history. The score was also a tired hack job. I guess Roger Ebert and A.O. Scott (two respected critics) gave the movie positive reviews for good intentions, and because of the superb art design, photography, CGI effects, but what a sad waste of money and effort. This happens so often, one wonders: is it that difficult to find decent writing talent in Hollywood? Are all the gifted writers working for TV?
B002DQDV6Y|4.0|My youngest just finished reading the book, so we rented the movie.  I remember when this movie came out that I liked it even more than the first.  I did like seeing it again, but it doesn't hold up as well as I remember.  That's ok though. My children loved it and can't wait to read more of the books. That's the best complement for a book addaptation that I can think of.
B005IZLPMY|5.0|I love it!! Chris Evans was great in the lead role.  I love the way he has a gentle spirit even when he's super strong.  If only there were more men like that!
B002APU580|5.0|Stay with it and get past their accents, because the first time through it is admittedly a little hard to understand what is being said. But it's well worth a second glance, because it then becomes an instant favorite. Such a precious story line, and the acting is perfect. The characters are excellently portrayed (casting was superb). Love it!
B001KZG99A|5.0|We really enjoyed the story and all the special effects.  I think they did a good job keeping it as close to the comics as a movie can.
B007OUINLC|1.0|I was very interested in watching this movie but had to turn it off after the first 20 minutes or so due to the horrendous job of acting on the part of Keira Knightly.  Her attempt to portray a psychologically damaged patient in a mental hospital was amateurish at best.  It was like watching a bad high school stage production in which the immature actress completely overacts.  What was so hard to watch was that she was so obviously acting - you try as a film viewer to suspend belief and get absorbed in the roles of the film.  However, when the acting is so bad all you see is someone pathetically attempting to act and nothing more.  My wife and I kept on looking at each other and shaking our heads before we finally threw in the white towel of surrender in order to spare us another minute of experiencing an actress way over her head and unable to bring the least bit of subtlety to what could have been an interesting film.
0374280967|1.0|Do I really care what the queen chooses to read?  No.  Another book club selection that I found quite boring.
B005CA4SQK|5.0|Product came in perfect condition, in a timely matter. Plus this show is one of the best, kind of expensive for only 6 episodes but it's worth it.
B009A9EQL6|4.0|I realize they only had 1 studio album between this and Nine Lives but this one is far better than Just Push Play, which I think is their worst since Done With Mirrors.  I also think Nine Lives is under rated but I digress.<br /><br />The songs on this album sound like Aerosmith music but, for the most part, the band doesn't rock out like they used to.  I like the album but it is more of a soft rock album.  Maybe it is my changing tastes as I've been into borderline heavy metal lately like Volbeat but I am also a life long Aerosmith fan and have all of their albums.<br /><br />The videos are good - they still rock out live!  I think the new songs I have heard live come across better live than on this album, which says to me they need to stop mixing with computers and just lay it down!  There is also a live video of Train with Johnny Depp playing guitar!<br /><br />True Aerosmith fans will not be disappointed.
B004SJ3AXI|3.0|not sure what to say havemt got to play the game yet.  but if i ever do get to play i might like it
B000VX6YCO|5.0|I have been wearing these for almost 25 years (not the same pair).  This pair is up to the regular standards and are great!
B002QRWJA4|3.0|I liked the movie but the case was unusable and since it was covered in plastic it wasn't apparent until I opened the plastic.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|angry birds is my go to game. i love it and sometimes have to demand that my son stop playing and give me a turn,
B009E3EY38|1.0|5 stars on the performance.I don't understand the camera constantly moving and changing angles.Is that art or something?This is Led Zepplin - they play 1 concert 27 years and the video is useless.You might like this video if you were on acid and it was the 60s.Don't waste your money - just buy the cd - if you don't need an extra frisbee. Please re-release this great concert with a watchable video.
B004XZR63M|5.0|Great reading. Has actually changed the way I think about finances. Would recommend to anyone looking for a way to change their current situation.
B000VMFDW2|5.0|Truly an amazing story. The detail is incredible. I also read &#34;a Helmet for my Pillow&#34;. They complement each other.
B004EBZX6W|5.0|Does a wonderful job looking at the wireless spectrum with in range. Gave good suggestions on moving an access point. Highly recommend this app if you have a several wireless access points with in range.
B000AYEL6U|5.0|I absolutely loved it!  Highly recommended! Richard Armitage is great; I'm a big fan now. I understand why this is top rated.
B000IYU9IG|5.0|This film is hilariously funny, clean, and is a great watch!  John Wayne at his absolute best!  You'll love the element he brings to the movie.  I highly recommend this movie!
B00913DPW2|4.0|Very intricately detailed and fun game! Definitely drains the battery, but I enjoy the story line & the mini games. I downloaded for free as a \\"deal of the day\\".
B009GEBBNQ|3.0|It's not horrendous, but there is just so little value in these kinds of movies anymore.  There's nothing here to encourage people in any kind of moral behavior, which I shouldn't be surprised about, and I'm becoming convinced that it's not good for people to live in fantasy all the time anyway. I recommend finding a better way of wasting your time...
B008TMA1LY|3.0|my 5yr old loves sitting and playing together with me because it does get a bit challenging when u start leveling up the one down side is u need the special hearts to unlock hello Kitty or other items and only way to get them is buy with real money. also seems to take a little to long to gain coins to level items up they are a bit pricey.
B003V5ED7W|5.0|This is hilariously funny and clean.  If you're looking for a great laugh that is safe from vulgarity and innuendo, this is a great one to try!
B00008IHN1|4.0|My brother was trying to find this to watch online, but his internet connection made it horrendous. So I picked up a DVD for him.
B0013BOS6W|3.0|This is a touching film with very little vulgarity and no immodesty.  The acting and directing is great, but the boundaries on proper conduct in a relationship before marriage are not clearly made, so I might not suggest this because of that, especially for children.  Other than that, the movie was very touching.
B004QSQMKE|5.0|Found a lot of people with good deals but went with the director's cut to hear the original musical score.
B005S9EJ14|5.0|Excellent movie.  I will always recommend it.  Anything with Maggie Smith and Judy Dench is always good.  We had a great movie party.
B006WQLH7G|4.0|I like the options it gives me and if I hadn't done something to really bog down my tablets start-up I would like it more.
B008GXHOFW|3.0|I played this game for 2 days. It has great graphics, realistic powerups, and good fighting. However on the 3rd day, this game crashed and whenever I tried to open it, it would show a black screen for a second, then close.
B004SRWW0C|5.0|I needed this to install the supposedly pre-installed Google Store/Google Play that my tablet shipped with.  Works well and has yet to disappoint.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|It would be great if the 3rd season also comes free, but i guess thats too much of an ask from my side...
B0009P5YXO|3.0|I didn't expect it to be entirely made of plastic, and thought that for the price that at least SOME of it would be metal or a durable material, but it wasn't. Also, the UV pen nibs were dried out upon arrival, which was also a pretty big downer. It was a little disappointing, but my girlfriend still loved it, so I'm happy.
B002L4QP0M|3.0|It had all the suspense and the right amount of twists to be a Archer's tale. nothing new to ask for.
B009CG2YDE|5.0|Wow, really well done game.  The old-school music, fast action and power-ups make it hard to put down.  Control is perfect on Droid Razr.
B007XIC1GI|4.0|I have enjoyed Manson's music since I first heard about him during the controversial release of Antichrist Superstar, so I was intrigued to read his book. He does a good job clearing up facts about his life & childhood, and while some of his tour stories can be shocking & disturbing (although maybe not as much for true Manson fans), his story is still enjoyable & very real to life.
B007V2UGPE|1.0|On my Kindle Fire no glu credits are being credited. Even after I ran their so called patch. I will not play anymore Glu games.
0385536828|4.0|Just finished \\"Sweeth Tooth.\\"  It's \\"about\\" so many themes and aspects I barely know where to begin to say.  It is a crowded book, and chilly not withstanding a fair amount of sex.  Unlike England's winter climate, however, that chilly isn't a drippy negative quite, rather a symptom of a codification of the norms of life and liberty.  To say this book won't be everyone's cuppa is an understatement.  In some ways it is repellent and intended to be so, I think.  I was as repelled as attracted.  There's a fascinating mega political thread winding through it all.<br /><br />There's quite a lot of literary commentary and I have to say I loved every bit of it.  As if I were a true insider in the Brit Lit community.  What fun.  And, some fairly serious literary criticism which I probably did not get but appreciated being in the audience nonetheless.<br /><br />It's all very mega meta meta both politically and literarily.<br /><br />What an odd-ball book in a very good way.
B0020M99LC|4.0|The movie was good!  The visual quality and the sound quality was good.  Had no problems loading the movie and there were no interruptions.  I would definately recommend.
1938469003|5.0|Very in depth read about the history and development of a very popular beer style. I like to brew with a mind towards more traditional styles and techniques, and found this book provided a good deal of information on the history of not only IPA, but of many traditional styles. Lots of time and research went into this effort. I applaud Mitch Steele, and enjoy many of his brew creations. Job well done!
B002W7J3SO|1.0|This movie is a waste of time. Where do I start? The dialogue is horrendous, and the plot lacks direction.  The acting is robotic and exaggerated. How did this ever get published?  If this wasn't by Hitchcock you never would have heard of it. And I wouldn't have wasted my time with it.
B002ZG980U|5.0|Great movie!  Great cast, script, directing, cinematography, etc.  This is my favorite movie of the decade so far, and for this price you just can't go wrong.
B008ACC9CM|5.0|Hard to believe they are so young. I know it has been said over and over, but here goes....if he sounds like this at 17 what a future he has ahead of him!  Charlotte sounds great too and will only improve as her voice matures.  Beautiful work!
B00A6N8F4Y|5.0|Excellent cast, pacing, direction and intelligent writing. Classic O. Stone in the same vane as Natural Born Killers. If you liked that movie then you should watch this one.
1451620829|4.0|Took longer then I thought to receive.  By the time I got in the mail I had forgot that I had ordered but the conditon of the book was fantastic and look forward to a good read.  Thank you!
B009SJ3H8Q|5.0|I wouldn't have thought it possible, but this season is even better than the previous one! And it's also really nice that Amazon is able to provide new episodes only 1 day after they air on cable.
B009CG2YDE|5.0|This is a classic form of atari's space invaders. It has a classic look of the old pixelated feel combined with a modern twist. In other words the graphics are damnable good. Worth the download!!!
B004FOA84A|2.0|Ah well, the reviews said that this game is short. That is an understatement. I've had sneezes take longer than this game. You find a few things, put them together and before your Kindle warms up you are done. No puzzles, no mini games, no story. VERY boring. Don't waste your time or money. Take the 99 cents, put a penny with it and get a hamburger from MCd's. At least you have something to show for your money.
B003VS0CXS|5.0|I've loved Chitty Chitty Bang Bang since I was a kid.  I used to watch it on TV when it played on the Family Film Festival program in Los Angeles.  I love the Blu-ray edition.  There are so many beautiful details I missed on my little tv set, which are now crisp and beautiful in high definition.  It was like watching it with wonder for the first time again.  Some of the flying scenes look a bit hokey because they didn't have the CGI technology back then, but the story, score, cinematography, dance sequences,  and costumes are just wonderful and classic.  Magical and a must see for people of all ages.
B006TLFPKO|5.0|This saga or series whatever you want to call it lol can't hardly wait to see it but I'm waiting for Amazon gives me the ability to advance purchase Awesome Sage ^_^
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This game has such a variety of different games. You can play so many games and earn points and by new games.
B008602KQI|5.0|Can't wait for part two :-) I heard it is coming out soon part I was excellent highly suggested  Bought for my kindle fire
B009YU6FJM|5.0|Good album, not the deftones of old but still one of the best rock bands out there. Any body who liked the last one will like this one.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Its great! I love the varities of play! I could play all day and change up my level of play, too.
B000JQUMPI|5.0|I got this for free for reading on my Kindle and I just LOVE being able to read it whenever the mood strikes, wherever I may be. I own several hardback copies of this book and generally reread it every year or two but now that it's on my kindle I find myself reading a chapter or two whenever I have ime to kill. Love this classic story!!
B0071MQBX0|5.0|This is a magnificent performance - great staging, incredible voices  and really good sound.  There are lots of surprises included after the performance ends such as Andrew Lloyd Weber being honored on stage being one of them.  I am so happy I have it and will listen to it often.
B004GNFSO0|4.0|As I have said in another review; almost all I know about history and geography I've learned from literature.  This book begins on the border of Russia and Poland at the beginning of World War II.  A young man, the same age as my son is taken into captivity for suspected treason.  He was simply in the wrong place at the wrong time.  He was actually an architect.  He is taken by rail to Siberia, where he is imprisoned for life in a land that few survive in even in the best of circumstances.  He and a few other prisoners devise a plan of escape and begin a long walk towards freedom.  Two things that stand out to me about this story is how young and tender this man was when his journey began and how quickly he matured.  The other thing is a very small detail that took place in the early days of his incarceration.  The men were given pants that were too big for them.  They were at all times forced to have one hand occupied in holding up their trousers.  This discouraged the prisoners from causing problems, because they only had one hand to work with.  This was also an immense source of shame and a constant reminder of their prisoner status.  Such a small detail and such a powerful tool of control.  I have thought of this practice many times since reading this book.  Memorable.
B00992CF6W|5.0|so much fun i just think they need to update it more often it is lots like real minecraft you just dont need conection for singleplayer
B003YFIUW8|5.0|I was traveling to Puerto Escondido in Mexico for a family wedding.  This is one of the most beautiful destinations one could travel to and I was in the company of many family members I adore; BUT I had started reading this book on the plane ride down and I could not force myself to stop reading once I had started.  I continued to read as we were bussed over mountainous terrain, past cypress trees filled with flowers and colorful geckos. we stopped at dusty villages populated with beautiful children and running dogs.  I continued to read ROOM, barely glancing up at the scenery and feeling annoyed if someone spoke to me, interrupting my love affair with a five year old child, who had never known anything but room.
B008GXHOFW|1.0|doesn't stay open it loads and then closes after it loads and it freezes a lot and when ever you try and web swing it doesn't work
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|This is a good game. I love the sound effects. I let my husband play it too. If you have a kindle, you have to download this game.
B009CG2YDE|4.0|Alright game pretty fun it took up alot of my time. Its good for a free game though. F F D D
B008JGSM6G|4.0|I have to give this more time to grow on me. It is very challenging. It also is new to me.
B004JK61K0|5.0|best andriod mail client. pair it with APG and you have native pgp email signing and encryption. plus it's named after dr.who's dog :P
B0006GQMC8|5.0|Good actors are in this. It is realistic and the terrain is very authentic. I kept my attention. It was based on a true story.
B004EBZX6W|5.0|this is an invaluable tool for setting up wifi networks and for determining where the most noise likely is. it's also fun to have open on the train and see all the different ESSIDs many of them humorous :P
B0063IH60K|5.0|I love this game. I play it all the time. iI is good to play while you wait for someone.
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|This movie is great for the while family.Pixar does it again!!! You will enjoy the while story with or without kids
B0044XRIMW|5.0|This is my favorite movie of all times. Everyone should watch it once. I love the music. The scenery is great.
B009H5IS1W|5.0|Criminal Minds is my favorite show so it is great to catch up on episodes (without commercials!) at my own convenience.
B00A4GXJD0|1.0|I've been a KR fan since around 2000 and have all of his CD's. IMOP this is his worst. It seams like it was thrown together in one or two nights. All of the tunes are formulaic, simplistic R&R tunes. No thought went into the lyrics or riffs.<br /><br />I Loved Devil Without a Cause, Cocky and Born Free. Unfortunately, Rebel isn't anywhere near as good.<br />Kid.....Put some effort into your next album!
B009WO7NQO|1.0|The game is great fun for my 5 year old. Until of course he finishes the few worlds available, then it wants $2 more dollars in order to unlock the next phase. I HATE things like that, if I pay for it once it should be done not open an available to add more money that my 5 year old can click for!
B009LROCJI|4.0|Some songs are much more elaborate than others and interesting. The work is short, however for classical music. I heard many genres woven into the various themes. Worth the money!
B008HK3XOU|5.0|To me, this case is better than skins.  It is convenient and utile.  The stand-up case makes viewing and using easy.
B0028R765A|5.0|This movie has so many great things going for it.  Its got a great soundtrack, good actors and its based on one of the best novels written.  While pundits and aficionados will certainly get angry about inconsistencies and the fact that it was changed presumably to better suit the time restrictions of film as opposed to books, these are things that people with not enough to do get angry about.  If you are looking for a movie which is entertaining but can also be explored for themes and philosophical questions about authority, morality, justice -and many more that don't come to mind- then this is a great way to spend a couple of hours.  I hope you enjoy it as much as I do and if you really like it, read the novel, it only gets better.
B00A6PD8RQ|5.0|My grandson experienced good sound and good viewing.  The graphics were great.  He was disappointed that the rental didn't last long enough.
B0094BB4TW|2.0|It's OK for a free app.  But,  pic uploads fail continually, and i cannot sort news feed by most recent.  I keep seeing days old feeds.
B009HV2JT8|2.0|Well the story stuck with the facts of general history with a bit of writers imagination thrown in for entertainment. This film just not didn't get a double run through the script. It was OK but not to be reccomended to anyone. A good B movie.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|My 2yr old plays this. game better than or as good as me. and ive been playing for near 40 yrs.  love watching him play .
B009KHDT0C|5.0|Johnny Depp does it again, this actor doesn't know how to take a role and screw it up. He is just a genius in his craft. Without Johnny in the film there would not be much of a film. It was funny, it was serial as was the series, it was way to short, and it was very good. Great film I want to add this to my film collection. Bravo! Tim Burton. Bravo! Johnny Depp, Bravo supporting cast.
B007QPFGJW|4.0|After reading the Snowman and the leopard I was excited to see Joe Nesbo's new book for sale.  I ordered it and read it right away.<br />I found Phantom to be exciting and enjoyed it just as I expected, but I didn\\"t feel it came up to the level of the previous two books.  Without in any way spoiling the ending I have to say that even though there are many surprises, I was dissaponted with the ending.
B002TYZKIM|4.0|This was Michael Jackson's final curtain call that none of us got to see, all we have is the reheresals that he was so famous for. Even in his later years he proved he was a true genuine talent, a one of a kind individual. He will be missed and is missed more by his family and children.
B005HV6Y5W|5.0|The Tree of Life is a polarizing film that is not for everyone. Although it stars Brad Pitt and Jessica Chastain (who both perform wonderfully), it is not a Hollywood movie by any means. The Tree of Life is a quintessential art film, and if you haven't had experience with non-traditional narrative form cinema, I suggest dipping your toes in the water elsewhere before jumping straight into the deep. That being said, The Tree of Life is a cinematic masterpiece, deeply moving and beautiful, that presents the idea of eternity and afterlife to the viewer. I have never before experienced such a marriage of spirituality and art in cinema. So for all you who lament movies such as Fireproof and Letters to God, this might be the one for you. At the same time The Tree of Life is profoundly philosophical, spiritual, and wide in its scope, it is also enigmatic. This leads some to see the movie as pretentious. However, I think it's important to consider that Malick is, quite frankly, a genius. He graduated summa cum laude from Harvard University and went on to teach philosophy at MIT before he became a film maker. I cannot blame Malick for making such a cerebral and seemingly cryptic movie. Rather, I applaud artists when they make self-reflective, personal works. Malick is simply an auteur. If you are a deep thinker and enjoy filling in the pieces of the puzzle yourself, you might very well enjoy this movie. If that's not your cup of tea, you might want to pass on this one.
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|I was very entertained, very cheered up by this movie. There was comedy, tragedy, coming of age a well rounded movie for the young adults out there. I give this movie a high rating because for an animated film it was very down to earth and pulls you into the script without you realizing it is happening. Disney will be around forever with this quality of work. Kudos to the new managing team.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Great science fiction. Has many unexpected twists (to my surprise). You can read a book at a time or continue on to the end of book 5. I will probably read the authors other books as well.
B000A2RRF4|4.0|This is what Michael Jackson was born to do, Entertain. And he did this in many countries in English and everyone understood his music and everyone wanted him never to stop. The world lost a master of songs in the entertainment industry. We will miss him always.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I like to solve puzzles, and this one is hard enough to challenge me without being too difficult. I won't pay for hints, however.
B009GEBBNQ|3.0|This was a movie where the characters got in the way of the script. It was good but not great, I wouldnt pay theatre prices to go see it but I would reccomend it to a comic book fan.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This is awesome love it! This is great for all kids/teens/adults but for the older ones it gets a bit challenging.Get this app!
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|As items for meeting agendas arise, simply adding them to agenda items on Evernote syncs them to all of your devices.  You're always on top of it and being organized is a smaller challenge.  I really recommend Evernote.
B00A3DZ61W|1.0|It takes forever to load. When it does load it plays really slow.. I really do not like it all..
B008XG1X18|5.0|This app is awesome. I love the ideas that you can get. And it's FREE!! Love it and the creator
B005RUV0NY|5.0|TWD is simply the best television series in years.<br />The show manages to make an unbelievable situation seem believable. Excellant writing, acting and effects.
B0033VUH6A|4.0|Jeremy Renner does a first rate job of portraying a man living on the edge.  Reminds you of what war can do to a  person.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|The awesomness continues. I await each sunday night anxiously. The people that have created and make this show shouldbe very proud. Outstanding television!
B0067R0APK|5.0|by far the best weather app on the market. Great info easy to access, great extended info. Use it daily
B0027J4SKA|5.0|Melody Gardot is at her best on this album...my absolute favorite of the 3 others I own by her - Worrisome Heart, The Absence, and this one
B0073LWEXK|5.0|This game is the best game I have on my Kindle so far! It's an mystery game and you have to figure out what to do. Sometimes you have to find an item (witch is my favorite part) and put it or use it somewhere. It's fun and I think you will like it. Only one thing - there's no instructions so you just have to figure it out yourself. :)
B005LAJ23A|2.0|Need to ship product better. I got it in the mail and the corners of the cardboard sleeve and left over glue were a price<br />Tag had been. I'm not thrilled with the conditioner. Exspecially co sidering this is to be a christmas gift
B007IXWKUK|5.0|The sex just keeps getting better, and the love has come into full bloom. This continuation is unlike any other second book in any other trilogy: it keeps you wanting more while overshadowing even the first, original book.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love this app it makes me check my account more. I love this app! man this is the best app ever!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|At first this book was a little confusing. Not the plot, but all the letters. I admitt, I didn't really read them... It got better, though. I read this book because a friend recommended it to me a long time ago. She read it, and cried. Her mom read it, and cried. I read it, and hysterically sobbed for what seemed like an hour.  This is the only book that has caused me to shed more than a few tears.<br />If you like sad\happy books, I recommend you read this.
B001BPJJ9G|5.0|I watched this on Netflix streaming a week ago and find I cannot stop thinking about it. There is something so special about this movie. Watching young Alexandria I was transported back to my long-forgotten youth. I was vividly reminded of myself as a little girl sitting upon my favorite uncle's lap as he told me stories. He would usually make them up on the spot as Roy did in the movie, so I had a say as to what direction the wayward plot went. Children have such flamboyant imaginations, unconstrained by harsh reality, and Tarsem did a beautiful job of portraying young Alexandria's imaginings. I sincerely wish I had gotten to see this in the theater. If any movie was meant to be savored on the big screen, it is this one.<br /><br />The two leads were beyond perfect. Catinca was a revelation. She was so innocent and adorable I felt like hugging the TV screen. And Lee Pace? Well, having seen him only in Pushing Daises thus far I had no idea of his incredible acting range. Not that he wasn't brilliant in Pushing Daises, but this was just something else. The contrast of his supine body and emotionally drained being in the hospital as Roy to the active and vibrant Red Bandit was mind-boggling. As the plot progressed and Roy's storytelling became tragic I found my heart bursting with pity for both him and Alexandria. The cathartic ending had me sobbing so much I had to rewind to listen to what was said. Overall, this is one of those movies that will stay with me forever, that I will find myself revisiting now and again.<br /><br />Much as I loved it, I will say that this isn't for everyone. If you have a strong undying love for fantasy and storytelling, you will be enthralled. My two companions on the other hand were so bored they fell asleep. When they woke they made some popcorn and happily watched the Expendables 2. :-/
B0075MFS9Y|5.0|Great album! I love listening to it especially sitting on my side porch in the summer. It is a fun album.
B008MC175A|4.0|Blu Ray is the only way to watch the series. The only let-down in the series is &#34;First Class&#34;. If you view it as a &#34;stand-alone&#34; movie, it's entertaining, but the history on each character doesn't exactly tie in with the original three movies.
0316232955|4.0|\\"Struck By Lightning\\"- as in the movie- was the first outside work by Chris Colfer that I heard of.  Upon learning what was about and gathering more and more details about the story, I couldn't help but be immensely attracted to it.  Try to understand; I am two years younger than Chris and growing up, I too wasn't too fond of the teen flicks whose focus was more on sex and drugs and not on ambition and fulfilling your goals in life.  Therefore, since late 2010, I've been impatiently waiting for the film to come out.<br /><br />Throughout 2012, it has been screened at film festivals all over the place (including abroad); in New York City, LA, Italy, France, Denver, Seattle and even Fresno!!  I'm a SF Bay Area resident and since it first graced the Tribeca Film Festival screens last spring, there has been ZERO screenings up here.  In fact, there aren't even any theaters up here that will be hosting its January 11th limited release!  It's especially ironic, considering the fact that Carson is all about being legit and keeping it real; something that us Bay Area folks are known for.  Which is why in August, a few weeks after I read Chris's incredible debut novel \\"The Land of Stories: The Wishing Spell,\\" I was so excited to hear that a novelization/extension of the film would be published.  I pre-ordered it the same day I found out.<br /><br />Much like his children's novel, it's not as straight forward as one might assume from reading the synopsis.  Everything that Carson does has meaning behind it; every cuss word he writes, every blackmail maneuver he pulls off, every outburst he throws out, every footstep he takes.  Everything and everyone are constant layers that one must examine in great detail to get a genuine understanding for and as time goes on, even Carson realizes that.  Yes, the writing could be a tad bit stronger and yes, maybe it would have been better without a crap load of cussing but let's remember: this is supposed to be the journal of a 17-year-old boy who knows better than others but not entirely.<br /><br />I had a feeling I would find Carson as a reflection of my 17-year-old high school self and sure enough, I was right!  He's very outspoken, doesn't give a care about what anyone else thinks about him, he's ambitious and driven, he's a writer and he's an overachiever but is underappreciated for it at the same time.  I knew something good was going to come out of this book the minute I read the dedication to \\"every president or captain of a writers' club, drama club, speech and debate club, Desintation ImagiNation team, every editor of a high school newspaper or literary magazine, and anyone else overachieving in their own right and underappreciated for it\\" (side note: I was editor of my high school's newspaper and on the editorial staff for my school's literary magazine too).<br /><br />Overall, I love this book (which may explain why I read it in only a few hours' time).  It's funny and snarky, it has its bitter moments, it incorporates valuable life lessons in its own unique ways and it's a definite authentic voice of someone who went through similar circumstances that I went through only a few years ago.  Now that I've read the book and know what it's all about, now I want to see the movie now more than ever.<br /><br />God speed Chris Colfer, God speed!<br /><br />\\"...a life without meaning, without drive or focus, without dreams or goals, isn't a life worth living.\\" -Carson Phillips (pg. 256)
B004U8VWLE|1.0|The film had its moments but they were very few and far between. You,ll love the film if you love balet and lots of it. The acting was excellent and so was the basic script but in my humble opinion they wove in too many dance scenes.
0525953728|1.0|First, this book is written on an 6th grade level. It is dry, without suspense or any real substance, and boring. The Bin Laden raid takes up the last few pages. The rest of it is a lot of blather about other deployments that contain absolutely nothing to sink your teeth into. It's all filler. There is nothing in this book that draws the reader in, grabs them, and won't let go, and there is very little factual information that isn't already known. The author states that he wanted to set the record straight. The only thing set straight is that Bin Laden was simply shot without putting up a fight as opposed to engaging the SEALS in his own defense, as was generally reported. Big deal. In the industry books like \\"No Easy Day\\" are called \\"instant books.\\" These are books rushed into print to cash in before somebody else does. Usually they involve disasters or other high-profile current event subjects that the publisher knows will sell big whether they have anything to say or not. This one does not. All those who gave it 5 stars have obviously never surpassed the reading level mentioned above. If you want to read a fascinating, compelling, and memorable account of a SEAL in action, read \\"Lone Survivor\\" by Marcus Luttrell.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|this is a really fun and addicting game!!if u are looking for a relaxing but exiting game this game is for you!!
B009WUAK2M|4.0|The Expendables 2(released Aug/12)stars Sylvester Stallone as Barney Ross,Jason Statham as Lee Christmas,Jet Li as Yin Yang,Dolph Lundgren as Gunner Jensen,Chuck Norris as Booker,Jean-Claude Van Damme as Jean Vilain,Bruce Willis as Mr. Church,Arnold Schwarzenegger as Trench,Terry Crews as Hale Caesar,Randy Couture as Toll Road,Liam Hemsworth as Billy the Kid,Scott Adkins as Hector,Yu Nan as Maggie Chan...phew!....along with a good supporting cast.This film starts in high gear baby;an adrenaline pumping,shoot 'em up,blow 'em up,kill 'em all extravaganza.I do not think I have ever seen a movie that starts off with this much energy to it.You talk about your \\"wow\\"factor,this film has it in spades!Unlike the first in this series,Mr.Stallone has gotten this one right.The film is straight forward.It does not stop to dwell on any one person or back story too long,and when it slows it only does so to allow us to catch our breath for a short and well timed moment,and then the gates open up again and we're off and running.Mr.Stallone has gotten legends Chuck Norris and Jean Claude van Damme on board for this one,and they are a sight for sore eyes.The in-jokes again abound in E-2,even though they're usually groaners of the highest degree.But considering their sources and who happens to be uttering them at any particular moment,they're a hoot and we forgive them,if they do sometimes come close to being silly.As I said in my review for E-1,Mr.Stallone is no dummy,as he is not only bringing all his own fans on board but those of every one of his costars also.A movie like this is a win-win situation for everyone involved.<br />The story starts out on a rescue mission in Nepal.The team is flying high with every gun spewing death at the push of a trigger.They furiously enter an overly guarded compound to rescue....Schwarzenegger!??? Yes,Ah-nold has gotten himself captured trying to rescue a Chinese millionaire;the same guy the team was after.Well,the guys got in but now they have to fight their way out as they repel down tower wires and into a forest.From there some take to the water,while others hop aboard their plane.The plane protects those in the water while also concentrating on taking out forces perched on a bridge.When all are on board they're finding their weight a bit too much to make it over an upcoming dam.Their sea-doos are ditched and after a few very tense moments,they just barely make it over.<br />On board this mission is a new guy called Billy.He was an ex-US forces soldier who served in Afghanistan,and after losing six squad members in a unnecessary shoot out with the Taliban,and his platoon dog mascot,he decided,when his hitch was up,to quit and join Stallone and company.However he confides in Sylvester that he has a girl waiting for him and wants out in a months time,which Stallone has no problem with.Willis shows up with another job for Stallone and the gang.It seems a plane has gone down in Albania carrying the location of a Russian mine in which five tons of weapons grade plutonium was stored.Off the group fly and they arrive and successfully get their item.However just as they're about to leave,Billy,who has been their point/sniper/look out man,has been captured by bad guy Van Damme and his cadre of no good-nicks.They're forced to hand over the map,and just before Van Damme leaves he high kicks Stallones own knife into Billy's chest,killing him.<br />From here on out it is revenge for the Expendables.They follow Van Damme,which leads them to a town in Bulgaria.They are attacked bu his forces the next morning and the fight isn't going so well,as the opposition has brought in a tank.Just when things look their bleakest,the tank and the rest of the enemy are mysteriously taken out.Suddenly Norris shows up out of nowhere and starts a rather nonchalant convo with the guys.And just as soon as he arrives,he is gone.The Expendables carry on and upon learning the exact location of the mine they fly their plane right into it.Van Damme flees just before this and triggers the mine to collapse,which traps the guys in the mine with several hundred miners.After a while,a wall suddenly collapses as a huge mining drill enters the mine and frees everyone.It is Ah-nold,who announces,of course,\\"I'm baaack\\".This allows the team to catch up to Van Damme and company at the airport before they can get away.It is there that Stallone is going to get his revenge on Van Damme for what he did to Billy.And what revenge it is.The film ends as the plane flies off into the sunset and the guys toast Billy.<br />Technically speaking the film is in its w/s a/r 2:35:1 and is clear and crisp.Extras include a gag reel,deleted scenes,commentary and four featurettes.<br />All in all a step up from the uneven E-1,as Stallone has gotten things right this time around,with his script,editing and pacing.Testosterone and action are maxed out to the hilt,as the guys go from one fight-fest to the next.In-jokes abound and Stallone and company are winking at us all....and we are winking back and loving it.4 1/2 stars.amme flees just before this and triggers the mine to collapse,which traps the guys in the mine with several hundred miners.After a while,a wall suddenly collapses as a huge mining drill enters the mine and frees everyone.It is Ah-nold,who announces,of course,\\"I'm baaack\\".This allows the team to catch up to Van Damme and company at the airport before they can get away.It is there that Stallone is going to get his revenge on Van Damme for what he did to Billy.And what revenge it is.The film ends as the plane flies off into the sunset and the guys toast Billy.<br />Technically speaking the film is in its w/s a/r 2:35:1 and is clear and crisp.Extras include a gag reel,deleted scenes,commentary and four featurettes.<br />All in all a step up from the uneven E-1,as Stallone has gotten things right this time around,with his script,editing and pacing.Testosterone and action are maxed out to the hilt,as the guys go from one fight-fest to the next.In-jokes abound and Stallone and company are winking at us all....and we are winking back and loving it.4 1/2 stars.
B0064W65UM|5.0|V For Vendetta is ugly, mean-spirited, violent and cruel. It's also perfect. Nothing I have ever read has laid down a better defense of freedom as a way of life. I say this because it presents freedom not as it is so often depicted elsewhere in fiction as a road that leads inexorably to the Promised Land, but rather as a choice one must make anew each day, a choice that may get you killed or endanger the ones you love, a choice that may leave dead bodies and broken minds in its wake. The final achievement of V is that it shows you the terrible price tag of freedom and still convinces you that nothing else is worthwhile. A masterpiece.
B004DMIIVO|5.0|This is a wonderfully made animated movie that I've been in love with ever since I saw it in 2010.<br />I feel ashamed it has took more than 2 years for me to get off my butt and finally purchase it, but I have it now and its a wonderful piece to own.
B00003CXB4|2.0|I bought this for my classroom and it doesn't play on my computer or a DVD player. Very disappointed with this manufacturer.
B0071XO8RA|1.0|Absolutely boring. Completely uninteresting. Seriously. I haven't read anything this bad in years. Go ahead and buy it. You'll see.
0425263908|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. I happened to read the 50 Shades Trilogy and loved it. This book is better written than the Trilogy and an overall good read.
0062200399|5.0|I've loved this book since the first time I read it. When I saw that a gift edition was being offered I immediately preordered it. This has been done in such a lovely manner. The fabric covering feels wonderful in your hands. The frontispiece illustration is beautiful, as are the similar illustrations at the beginning of each chapter.<br /><br />If you've never read this book, I highly recommend it. The story is great for both young and old alike. And this book is a great addition to any book collection and would not look out of place in an elegant home library.
B007MAETA8|3.0|Its a big change from the usual John Mayer......we were disappointed with the country twang and music.....hope he continues to change or we will not buy the next albumn.........
B0053O89XI|5.0|Purchased entire series for my son's birthday.  He loves the series.  Great quality.  Very fast shipment of DVD.  Great shows!
B009HV2JT8|5.0|This is a great movie! The special effects are awesome! I loved that they took the real &#34;Abe Lincoln&#34;and made him believable as a Vampire Hunter. And how they took his history and blended in to this story. Even the music is great.<br />It's not dull or never ending; if you didn't get the whole &#34;twilight&#34; thang, If you enjoyed Van Hellsing or any of the &#34;underworld&#34; movies, you may agree that this movie is sooooooooooooo cool.
B002N5N4MG|5.0|Purchased entire series for my son's birthday.  He loves the series.  Great quality.  Very fast shipment of DVD.  Great shows!

B009SJ3GUK|4.0|I like it but the first season was way better. There have been so many times that I've lost interest.
B003L77G6K|5.0|Purchased entire series for my son's birthday.  He loves the series.  Great quality.  Very fast shipment of DVD.  Great shows!
B009NPA3Q4|5.0|As a huge fan of Phillips from American Idol, I was more than pleased with this album.  It has exceeded my expectations.  It's so, so good!
B0070NSPCU|5.0|This is an absolutely amazing book!  Rothfuss and Martin have nothing on Anthony Ryan.  Ryan's storyline and characters, as well as his storytelling ability, make this book better than any other I have read...and I've read a lot of them.  Waiting for the other forthcoming books will be difficult...please hurry!  Keep them coming Mr. Ryan, we are waiting with bated breath!
B008EZVNO0|5.0|This album needs to be played quite a few times to begin to appreciate the depth and moody soulfulness which runs through the entire track-list;but it is an excellent Van Morrison release which will be appreciated,especially by his fans.Thought-provoking and challenging.
B009ZAY8MM|5.0|Brilliant, well worth the money. This is the second installment of Pentatonix's a-cappella. Their first release was good was well. (6 songs)
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|my 8yr old son cant keep away from this game!  it is very creative how he comes up with different contraptions for the pigs.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|. Fantastic, the first useful app that always works how it should. I use it everyday, better than the non app version
B008I6ZX1E|5.0|Arrived a good 3/4 days ahead of even the first expected deliver date. The sleeves of the hardcovers don't exactly match, but I'm pretty sure that's stated in the description. Overall, happy with my purchase.
B00A3OT34M|5.0|Excellent dance album, great collaborations, great beats. This album makes you want to party or go on vacation, I love it!
B002E0JL86|1.0|I like the idea of streaming movies, but $4.00 for 1 day is too much.  I will probably switch to Redbox.
B00A12Z264|5.0|Christina is a great artist, incredible vocalist, this album is has a nice combination of beautiful ballads, up tempo songs and great collaborations.
1401923127|5.0|Great writing by Bruce Lipton. I am fascinated by the mind.<br /><br />This is a great foundation of learning about the mind. The key to reaching your potential and getting what you want in life. It all starts with the dominating thoughts in our subconscious mind! Learn about it here.
B000SEGUDE|5.0|This book was truly incredible.  I was anxious to read before seeing them film, but in retrospect, I could have read it afterwards as well, as the movie was structured in a different way.  Regardless, it was a wonderful, well-written book, and I highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys good literature and a rousing epic story.
B0098VXBIA|4.0|Funny movie..spoiler there are some sad parts which made me cry. But overall it really was a good movie for parents or parents to be.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I enjoyed Gone Girl, tho not as much as the author's other two books.  A good read.  Go for it.
B009WO7NQO|4.0|Really good game!  I just wish they'd bring out all levels at once and not make me wait. All members of the family enjoy this (35, 6 and 4 year old).
B008966SIU|5.0|Hey, its Grizzly Bear.  They are the hippest band with the dorkiest name.  The tunes are addictive and thoroughly enjoyable.
B003O86FMW|5.0|If you love action packed books full of rebellion you must read this book! The Hunger Games series will blow you away!
B008JFC6F0|5.0|First heard this group on a playlist sent by my friend, and then heard this album on NPR Listens.  The link was there...i simply HAD to buy it.  No regrets.  Its great.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Certainly, it is another legal thriller, but from a different angle. Malcom tweaked loopholes of witness protection program to set himself free from his &#34;wrongful&#34; conviction. The point readers pursuit may not be who is the true culprit, you will, instead, will be how Malcom juggle the legal system to give vengeance to it.
0374275637|4.0|Even though I am just 1/3 through reading the book I have enjoyed everything. It is easy to read, The layout and the division into small chapters and major sections helps to produce a logical succession of ideas. There are plenty of examples to support his ideas.
B005VBC7EA|5.0|Amazing bibs, fit well, pad comfy for 50 mile rides (even when I had not bee riding for the past 5 years). Elastic is very good. I will however say that they really do not impress me much more than the<br />Gore Power 2.0 bib which is about half the price. Maybe there is a different that I will not realize until I get back up to Century shape... That said I highly recommend the Orzon bibs. They are excellent!<br />Fit is right in line with Amazon sizing charts. I went a little large with a XL bib on a 38\\" waist, but could have probably done the Large without too much squeezing of the gut.
B002L9N4F6|3.0|two discs messed up in the chocolate box.<br />worried about their scratch but luckily no scratch.<br />played well,<br />so I give you three stars.<br /><br />one of my favorite movies...
0307346617|2.0|\\"A compelling thrill to read with a sauce of touching love all over it. This book is a goodbye to gross sadness and a hello to a moon setting over a bay of compelling literature.\\"
B009VB97EY|4.0|this movie is not going to win any awards, but it is a great \\"guilty pleasure\\" movie. the characters are, obviously, hot and the movie is fun to watch, but there is [surprisingly] a cute (albeit basic) story line. this is a fun movie that was definitely worth the rental!
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|Bad piggies is a creative and awesome very good to pass your time and it also makes you think ,oink oink .
0425263916|5.0|Sylvia Day has turned into my new favorite writer!  The story of Gideon and Ava tangles your mind and draws you in.  I can't wait for the third book to be released so we can see where Gideon and Ava's life takes them.
B008K8VDPU|1.0|This app is really quiet you can not even hear it .It also does not have a lot of piano keys
B009738XXM|5.0|This album is pure Sugar pop, you won't find many ballads on here at all.<br />Much better than her first effort and easily my favorite pop album of the year.
0446580848|5.0|John Corey is one of the best characters I have read. DeMille combines a geography lesson and humor, how I wish school had been this entertaining. The reader will learn about Yemen, from historical to current. I really enjoyed the characters overseas in this new assignment chasing after a new terrorist. DeMille doesn't disappoint, he introduces a new CIA agent for the readers to enjoy. I know I was quite sad to see Nash whacked in a previous novel, but this new CIA agent keeps the reader guessing. Some of the characters could have been excluded but I would say this latest John Corey novel worth the read.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Now I know why everyone likes Angry Birds. When I downloaded it, I had no idea how much time I would spend playing it. It is completely addictive.
B008TMA1LY|5.0|This game is so cute and I love hello Kitty so it is perfect for me<br />it made me so happyt play it
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|Great movie, great lesson, wonderfully made! I don't think I've enjoyed a disney movie this much - I really think Pixar put a lot of thought into the plot. Yay Brave!
B008S80P38|5.0|Great album (except for track 3 and the last track). Anyone who likes deadmau5 should own and enjoy this. Mint!
B0017SWPXY|5.0|Now, I know my dog understands every word I say to him.  Great book, a must read for every animal lover.<br />Thanks
B009WO7NQO|5.0|I'm upset that it will not download on my kindle fire....I have this game on my galaxy 2 and love it.....
B00992CF6W|4.0|This is a decent game but it wont let me update it and it deleted my mc plz fix this
B0009RCPY8|5.0|Nice set, each movie has it's own dvd holder. What more can you say about a DVD, too many words required for reviews :)
B008JGSM6G|5.0|my friend got me into this app and now it is so addicting! I never want to stop playing it. its sorof a challenge but so fun!!!
B008VBYN80|5.0|a great game. to quote mcdonalds I'm lovin it. hope you enjoy it too.<br />hope this makes you go get woke mcdonalds too. drive up he price of the stock and make me rich.
B00062PN6I|5.0|Nice sound for the $10 i spent. They feel kinda cheap but you get what you pay for in that respect. They sound really really nice for the price and I'll probably pick up another pair.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|absolutly addictive, just like the carnival version. great way to kill some time, with minimal investment in doing good. level ups, and boosters to allow an interesting growth element to the game that without this, the game would become dull instantly. thanks a classic carnival game that delight without pumping and endless supply of quarters in to get the same experience I had as a kid.
0385344333|1.0|I have read everything that Lee Child has written, so, obviously, I've enjoyed his productions enough to keep on buying them.  That has come to an abrupt halt.  This book is thoroughly awful and barely merits one star.  After I finished the book, I looked for an acknowledgments page.  I wanted someone to blame.  Usually writers heap endless praise on their wives, mothers, dogs, best friends, and editors.  There are no acknowledgments in A Wanted Man.  This is for the best because I doubt that any wife, mother, best friend or editor would want to be slandered by being associated with this book.  My theory is that as writers get \\"famous,\\" they feel that they don't need editors, or, maybe, editors become intimidated by their \\"stars,\\" loathe to lose their mealticket, and they fail to do their jobs.  Any modestly talented undergraduate English major could have spotted the problems with this mess and made a reasonable attempt to clean up after Lee Child. Maybe Delacorte Press really isn't a publisher but just a mail drop.  Maybe editing is outsourced to Sri Lanka.  The flaws and numerous deficiencies have been nicely enumerated in other reviews; e.g., long, drawn out, boring chapters.  Wooden characters.  Threatening a child????  I'd like to add that the premise of some sort of terrorists running a \\"bank\\" for other terrorists, with their primary capital asset being empty barrels of Cold War radioactive waste is preposterous.  However, my favorite screw up is having as the ultimate villain Lester Lester (from Marvel Comics?) who comes and goes, is never developed.  We don't know what he eally does.  Why he's so bad.  What becomes of him when the writing is done.  In the end, we really don't care, Mr. Child. This book is a rip off.  Take some of your millions, Mr. Child, and do a recall before any of your readers are so traumatized they never read again.  Also, Delacorte sucks.  I'd be reluctant to read anything issuing from this outfit.
B000JBWWQ0|3.0|The book is much better.When the book first come out,couldn't help thinking they need to make a movie of this. The movie is a dissapointment.didn't hold my intrest like i thought it would. Most books are by far better then the movie.
B009DQQF7Y|5.0|No Disrespect, I thought Lift Your Skinnny Fists, was probably the best album ever recorded.  When I heard that they were recording a new album I was very excited, and I pre-orderred and I am pleased witht he result.  That being said, if I was going to introduce a newbe to GY!BE, I would not make this their first lesson, it is great, but probably not their most accessible, too complex maybe?  it is good, if you are already a fan, you will love it,.  As a new listener, I'd go for one of their older disks as a primer first.
B008DW6VOQ|3.0|I  haven't used it yet and the only reason  I am writing this review is that it is onthe page.
B009LK6JS2|4.0|I enjoy this game. I have played this simulator a couple of dozen times now and have only landed successfully once so far. It is a challenge.
B004GYY714|5.0|For those of us who live in, and are interested in, a world outside the US, this is is great. A truly global app.
B007GCY8FS|1.0|Sadly Lee Childs has lost it. Without a doubt,this is the worst of the series.<br />90% of the story is  an endless, boring  car ride. The only action is at the very end.<br />I'm not alone in this rating as i believe  it was only listed in the NY Times top book review for 1week.<br />Save your money, a poor read.
B005NJU8PA|3.0|Tim has done it again as this book is quite well thought out and written.  He did his homework again and produced another hit. As I got into the book deeper I realized he spent way too much time on hunting and other non-related issues.  It wasn't that great and I put it down.
B0091V6TF4|5.0|Everything I could have hoped for.  Besides all the title tunes-plus On his Majesty's Secret Service, the second CD with the added music is fantastic!
B0098VYCCE|3.0|Watched only to see Charleze scream for 2 hours -she is amazing !! K-stew as usual looks constipated and miserable. Why is she getting roles? Dont see the skills here at all.
B009CG2YDE|4.0|A little bit space invaders a little bit centipede. Smooth play and easy controls. Just rock the phone from side to side as the bullets fly.
B0088TG252|3.0|was decent enough...could have been really good but it seems(like with so many movies) the direction gets tired towards the end and things get sloppy..bummer
B004FGMDOQ|3.0|Not what I expected but an interesting coming of age and time traveling story.  The photographs woven into the story was enchanting and,I think a brilliant vehicle to spin a yarn.
B009VB97EY|1.0|Acting was beyond awful.Not that I expected much but with all the hype and actors who have somewhat decent reputations I thought there might be some &#34;surprise&#34; to it..it was horrible! The story itself was lame,predictable,lame,slow,boring should I continue? But the acting...will give Channing Tatum credit considering his talent....he was the best actor in the film. Mathew gave his good&#34;southern dude swagger&#34;  same one he does in beef commercials and ...well everything else. The girl(?name) sister of Alix P character was possibly the worst acting ever...I thought there was something wrong with the streaming her timimng was so off...says something about the director there too..too bad I wasted $4 and a few hours of my life for this.<br />How did this get so much press? Makes Ben Afflecs Gili look good
141659521X|5.0|Vince Flynn is an incredible author, whose talent increases with every novel he produces.  Flynn does not disappoint his readers and &#34;The Last Man&#34; novel is another testament to the author's ability to intertwine creativity and facts without compromising the integrity of the little details that make each story seem real.  If Mitch Rapp was not a fictional character, I would be head-over-heels in love with the man as his morals represent some of the many things I respect and appreciate about being a U.S. citizen.
B009329Y30|3.0|Zac was decent ...better than I thought he would be .Taylor is bla not great acting..story very predictable as you would imagine
B00A8ECU24|5.0|love it. pretty typical game, but it has ponies. making it 20% cooler. also 10 times more awesome. there is also a split personality Derpy with demon eyes. basically best ever. p.s. fluttershy is best pony
B0098VXBIA|2.0|Diaz is like Aniston ..plays same role over and over again-getting bored Typical storyline a few laughable moments played out story lines.
B007SGM084|5.0|I'm really enjoying reading these books and am glad I bought them. It's nice being able to read them on your device also.
B005D0RDKW|5.0|Rush fans already know the level of performance that the band is famous for. I have been a fan since the 70's and they never have let me down and never cease to amaze me. However, the performance on this night in Cleveland is magic beyond words. Those who know the history of Rush know the significance of the city of Cleveland to the band. From three rock icons who are pushing 60 years of age this performance proves that age means nothing. They just keep defying their critics and defying the odds.<br /><br />The production on Blu Ray is top notch. Get this one soon so when you've worn it out there will still be more available!<br /><br />Hats off (once again) to Neil, Alex and Geddy for another in a long line of stellar performances. Oh and the 'alternate versions' of SoR are worth the price of admission alone!
B009CG2YDE|5.0|Very simple retro game. Easy to play but still challenging enough to keep my attention. Perfect for my kids as well!
B007BVMVDU|5.0|Best show on TV
B009NQKPUW|4.0|The movie was good not great. It doesn't give the true 3D popping off the screen, but the 3D as you are in the movie feel.
B001CHXUPC|5.0|It's a great model, maybe a little larger than I need, but has great detail. I recently flew in the &#34;movie version&#34; of the Memphis Belle and so I just had to have a model that reflected my wonderful flight.  Smoothest take-off and landing I've ever experienced. Thanks for having this model available so that I can &#34;celebrate&#34; my flight over and over.
B008QE9XD2|1.0|This film has a great cast, fine locations and the sets are well done.<br />1. This has NOTHING to do with the original TV series except in name.  Just a tawdry attempt at attracting viewers.<br />2.  The writing is stale.  There is nothing original nor funny.  Did they spend all their budget on the cast?<br />3. There is little to laugh at.  Even Johnny couldn't save this travesty.<br />4. There are more times the audience feels sorry for the actors than they do for the characters.<br />5. Even a laugh track couldn't save this.  And if they do add one, RUN!<br />6. The true horror is the waste of one's time watching this mess.  Such a lost opportunity and a waste of talent!
B00ABWYG16|5.0|Just listened to it on Spotify. I know it will make my short list of albums I actually like enough to own. Every song is amazing on this, and they don't do any over-the-top super long, boring things. If you're looking for songs over 7 minutes, check out their other stuff. But if you like short, punchy masterpieces that you can't forget, get this one. No wasted time on this CD. Oh yeah, and the whole thing's in French. Why not? I love it, and you will too.
B00A6PD8RQ|4.0|This movie had great animation. The story was cute with the obigatory good ending but the story was different that other animation movies I have seen recently.

0345803507|3.0|I loved the first two books and was engrossed in the story, but when I got to this book, I had a hard time staying engaged. The first two were hard to put down, but this third one was hard for me to stay interested. Once you've done everything, I guess what more is there to do?
B0087HT36U|4.0|Regardless of what haters say this is a good game. Don't listen to people you don't know. Try the game for yourself and decide what you think about it. I bet you like it.

B007FEFLTO|5.0|I couldn't put this book  down.  A fascinating historical novel with interesting, likeable characters.  Generations are intertwined, weaving a fast paced account of war and how it affects everyone in different ways.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|Between my son and me, we have purchased everything there is to purchase and completed all of the achievements. The neat thing about this game is that when you beat it (there are only 15 levels), it keeps going, just giving you new missions and new badges each time you beat it. It's a fun game - nothing to complicated or complex.
0593065727|5.0|Sustains interest and believability almost all the way, very exciting. Definitely an action story. Multiple plot twists. Worth buying and reading. I won't be leaving this one in the airport for someone else; a keeper which I could imagine re-reading some years from now.
B00005O3VC|4.0|It's fun to watch this cheesy movie because it doesn't get old.  The Holy Grail is my favorite Monty Python movie even though the others are pretty funny too.
B007IXWKUK|3.0|By far, better than the first book but still poorly written with big words used between sex scenes in a failed effort to make the book seem more intelligent than it is.  Christian is still way too mental for any type of relationship and he's sadly drug a young smart girl into his insanity.  Reminiscent of every bad relationship I've ever been in, minus the \\"kinky f-ery“ (which is a phrase beyond over used in these books).
1419705849|5.0|I love this series. The latest installment is on a romantic adventure with our favorite characters; Greg and Rowley. This book started out very unusually and progressed to maybe even be the funniest in the series. A great hilarious read, with amazing pictures as well; like always.
B0070NSPCU|5.0|Wow! This was such a skillfully written and powerfully entertaining epic fantasy story. I would even put it up there with Prof Tolkien's work. As Blood Song gradually unfolded in carefully delivered segments over different times, the reader was respected and challenged by not having everything delivered to them on a plate...when were characters lying? Why did some pieces of story not ring quite true?<br /><br />What initially seemed like a couple of minor flaws in the story - times when I thought \\"would that character really have done that?\\" - later became resolved when subsequent pieces of story filled the gaps to perfection.<br /><br />And unlike many first books of contemporary series, this one delivered an entirely satisfying ending whilst still leaving the reader hungry for more. I can't wait for book 2.<br /><br />...and did I already say \\"Wow\\"?<br /><br />I am not surprised to see Penguin has now picked up this self-published book. Recommended reading.
B007704HO6|4.0|James Bowen was a drug-addicted busker (street performer) in London when a wounded street cat came into his life.  James felt sorry for the poor moggie and took him in -- temporarily, he thought, until the cat could heal and get back out to his street life.  But &#34;Bob,&#34; as he called his new pal, had other ideas, and by the end of the book, it isn't only Bob who is healed.  This is hardly a great work of literature, but it is a fine example of the popular genre of animal redemption tales: stories of how animals can help people through times of great personal difficulty and challenge.  A fun, heart-warming and quick read for anyone who loves animals.

B0097BY3K6|5.0|Much like his previous classical crossover albums [[ASIN:B0010NX274 Virtuoso]], [[ASIN:B001UW58WW David Garrett]], and [[ASIN:B003O86MY8 Rock Symphonies]], David has done it again on \\"Music.\\" This time, we're treated to covers of Coldplay's \\"Viva La Vida,\\" Michael Jackson's \\"Human Nature,\\" Justin Timberlake's \\"Cry Me A River,\\" Queen's \\"We Will Rock You,\\" Misirlou, and Guns N Roses' \\"Welcome to the Jungle\\" and updates on Beethoven's \\"Ode to Joy,\\" Chopin, Clementi, Bach's Double Harpichord Concerto in C Major, and Kachaturian's \\"Sabre Dance,\\" among others. You'll also find a nod to James Bond rocking a riff from Led Zepplin's \\"Whole Lotta Love\\" and some Latin American and Celtic vibes on Tico Tico and Celtic Rondo.<br /><br />Most thrilling, David has gotten back to recording high-octane classical covers; the Beethoven Scherzo brings to mind the rollicking score from Pirates of the Caribbean. \\"Sabre Dance\\" bursts out of the gate with some serious electric guitar and turns it into a headbanging anthem. \\"Whole Lotta Bond\\" is a great update on a classic theme. There are slower, gentler sides of David in Chopin's \\"Nocturne,\\" Clementi - \\"Sonata\\" and \\"Ode to Joy.\\"<br /><br />And let me be the first to say that I am NOT a fan of the cardboard packaging; it arrived from Germany slightly dented, and I had a devil of a time getting the discs out. You'll find the bilingual liner notes and three gorgeous photo \\"postcards\\" tucked into the middle. The Deluxe Edition features a Region 0 DVD with five videos (\\"Viva La Vida,\\" The Making of Viva La Vida, \\"Tico Tico\\" (live from Hannover), \\"Stop Crying Your Heart Out\\" (live from Hannover) and \\"Funiculi Funicula\\" (live from Hanover). And it's great to finally see David literally letting his hair down in the liner notes (if there isn't a \\"David Garrett's hair\\" fanclub, I volunteer to start one!).<br /><br />Overall, Music is closest in composition to [[ASIN:B0010NX274 Virtuoso]], which still ranks as my #1 David album of all time for its balance of uptempo, classical, and original compositions. This is a must-have for new and old fans alike; be sure to spring for the Deluxe Edition if you can find it! And DEFINITELY spring for the Blu-Ray concert DVD of Music, which is currently only available through Amazon.de (ASIN: B009D2RQ30) It is PAL Region 0 and plays just fine on my Sony Blu-Ray DVD player. There are 28 tracks, including pretty much ALL the songs (and bonus tracks) from Music. There are even English subtitles for all of David's German intros!alance of uptempo, classical, and original compositions.

030795062X|5.0|I would neglect other things that I needed to get done in order to keep reading this book. It's not easy to explain why. There were no ultra suspenseful scenes that compelled me to keep reading until I found out what happened. The story isn't particularly riveting on its merits. There are plenty of other similar stories out there. What is riveting is Murakami's style. His novels are like the lives of the characters who populate them. They're spare and simple. All the extraneous is stripped away to leave the essential. Norwegian Wood has all the sensuousness of other Murakami tales. Touch, taste, hearing, sights, smells, you don't just read the book. You experience the story. Somehow, the emotional complexity of the characters emerges from the physicality of their lives. Not much is explained, but you find yourself understanding exactly what's going on despite the paucity of narrative and explication.<br /><br />Books like this make reading worthwhile. There's just some intangible thing that you take you away from reading it. It's hard to describe, but I felt changed after finishing Norwegian Wood. It's haunting and real and beautiful. It touches something primal. That something is buried deep. Murakami is a master at getting us there. Follow him down. It's worth your time.

B005LAIHY0|4.0|Like many folks I went to see Prometheus expecting an Alien prequel. I didn't read any pre-movie reviews because I didn't weant to see any spoilers. After seeing it I was left scratching my head. No, it really isn't an Alien prequel. Many other reviewers here have disected the film in great detail. I won't repeat what they've already written.<br /><br />I will say that I enjoyed the movie more the second time I saw it. The Blu-ray has features that give a better explanation of what the film and Ridley Scott were trying to accomplish. It isn't bad Sci-Fi (like lots of Sci-Fi) it's just different. The Blu-ray wasn't crammed with superfluous extras, but enough to give you some additional flavor. I say it's worth a look.
B0015DROBO|5.0|This is one of those books that when you start reading it you aren't totally sure you will like it.  If you stick with it I promise it is worth it.  Once the story gets going it is nearly impossible to put down.

B009HQ9UHC|3.0|Bad Piggies is a low-end game with less action and less interaction than Angry Birds.  Still, it's entertaining and doesn't involve shooting people or stealing cars or pretending I'm a magical somethingorother.<br /><br />If it cost money I'd think less of it.  If it interacted more or had more variables, I'd give it a higher rating.

B000SEGUDE|5.0|\\"Cloud Atlas\\" is a remarkable novel. It is laid out in a mirror format. That is, there are five stories spanning the mid-nineteenth century and running through a chilling extrapolation of a \\"corpocracy\\" society . Each of the first five stories ends abruptly without conclusion. The sixth story is told in its entirety. Following, each of the preceding stories conclude in the reverse order of their introduction. The threads that bind them together are the genetic connections between the primary characters and the notion of a soul that inhabits the people through the span of centuries.<br /><br />It is a careful examination of human nature. The mirror format becomes a mirror for the reader and asks questions that are both fascinating and uncomfortable. All writers should read \\"Cloud Atlas.\\"

B000WQW988|5.0|Despite being a die hard NIRVANA fan; I never purchased this dvd because I had recorded it on SP mode (VHS) and it was in tremendous quality. Furthermore, I recorded it onto a DVD-R so I was extremely happy with the show. However, I thought about NIRVANA unplugged because of the 19th anniversary of the show and decided to impromptu buy it. ***IF you are a serious fan than this is a pre-requisite. I am so happy with the DVD for a myriad of reasons, which I will provide in thorough detail.<br /><br />Okay, the main thing that I liked about the DVD was that it provided context to discrepancies between the CD, \\"Unplugged in New York\\" and the MTV performance. For example, the songs were not in the same sequential order. I knew that two songs had been omitted, but Dumb was track 6 on the CD and performed 4th on MTV. That always perplexed me. Why did that happen? What was I missing? If you ever felt the same I am going to begin answering these questions.<br /><br />Well, first off I will detail what is actually on the DVD for an attention getter: The MTV performance as aired many times, rehearsals, a documentary on the event; entitled Bare Witness and The unedited performance from Nov. 18, 1993. (Really as if you were there in the audience.)<br /><br />The MTV performance has been broadcast thousands of times, but in case you aren't a die hard fan I will detail the track listing. It is as follows:<br /><br />1. About a girl. 2. Come as you are. 3. Jesus doesn't want me for a sunbeam. 4. Dumb. 5. The man who sold the world. 6. Pennyroyal tea. 7. Polly. 8. On a plain. 9. Plateau. 10. Lake of fire. 11. All Apologies. & 12. Where did you sleep last night?<br /><br />The Rehearsals are really enlightening because some of the dialogue heard on the CD makes sense now. I would imagine NIRVANA rehearsed more than 20 minutes, but maybe not. The included Rehearsal set list is as follows:<br /><br />1. Come as you are. 2. Polly. 3. Plateau. 4. Pennyroyal tea. 5. The man who sold the world.<br /><br />The \\"Bare Witness\\" documentary aired on MTV back in 1999 and is approx. 15 minutes. I hated this documentary back then and feel comparable today.<br /><br />& The unedited performance. The GEM. It not only included the missing two songs; Oh me and something in the way, but also qualifies a proper dialogue context.  The set list here is the same as the CD, but way better.  Having said that...the set list is as follows:<br /><br />1. About a girl. 2. Come as you are. 3. Jesus doesn't want me for a sunbeam. 4. The man who sold the world. 5. Pennyroyal tea. 6. Dumb. 7. Polly. 8. On a plain. 9. Something in the way. 10. Plateau. 11. Oh me. 12. Lake of fire. 13. All apologies. 14. Where did you sleep last night?<br /><br />Okay, I have laid out what is on the dvd; now I can finally give you some specificity to what I have been saying repeatedly about context. I'll break down the unedited performance and reference the MTV performance and rehearsals too.<br /><br />Unplugged in New York opened with audience clapping. Well, on the unedited performance you see who this people are. You see the band come out on stage and sit down. Kurt opened up by saying \\"Hello here.\\" This would lead to the intro of about a girl. There isn't much of a break before the band starts come as you are; similar to the MTV performance.<br /><br />Next, Kurt Cobain introduces Lori Goldston, the cello player, and Dave Grohl acknowledges the new guitar player Pat Smear. People seem to forget that Smear was going to be a full fledge member of the band moving forward. It saddens me  that this fact is totally forsaken. For instance, he isn't even listed on NIRVANA's wikipedia page as a member. He is at the bottom as only a touring member. Kurt said, many times that Smear was going to help contribute on the next album. My point is he wasn't just an extra guy that appeared, for the first time, on Saturday Night Live in Sept. 1993. He was a legitimate member and on the unedited version of Unplugged; that point is conveyed albeit briefly.<br /><br />Jesus doesn't want me for a sunbeam goes by just like it did on the MTV performance. Do you remember when Kurt said I guarantee you I will screw this song up? He was talking about The man who sold the world and this dvd explains why. Kurt was having problems with Pat's guitar, on the song intro, during the rehearsals. He appears moderately frustrated. I.e. in a constructive non condescending manor.  The song is terrific leading up to Pennyroyal tea.<br /><br />I always wondered why Kurt asked am I going to do this by myself? Well, during the rehearsals the song really wasn't going well. Initially, they had Pat playing guitar and also singing backup. Scott Litt, the sound technician, suggests that Grohl play guitar and Smear focus on the backing vocals. This really didn't improve things and Kurt was playing the song in a different key too.<br /><br />Therefore, Kurt asks am I going to do this song by myself? Another part that was edited out of the MTV performance...Grohl asks Smear Are you not going to sing? Then quickly he answers Kurt with do it by yourself. Kurt acknowledged that he was going to play in the normal key, by himself, and it is absolute BRILLIANCE. OUTSTANDING. 100 percent better than rehearsal.<br /><br />Next, Kurt opines that we can't play dumb next. However, he quickly concludes that Unplugged is taped and MTV will edit it differently anyway. He would have to tune his guitar down to a D for on a plain. Thus, they decided to play dumb next. Afterwards, on the unedited version, Kurt says we can't play those two songs back-to-back because they are the same song.<br /><br />There really isn't anything new with Polly in the performance. Kurt needed his vocals raised the rehearsals and Grohl sang out of key. However, on the unedited performance it came together perfectly again.<br /><br />Again, On a plain is virtually the same as the MTV performance. Moreover, Something in the way is the exactlythe same as heard on Unplugged in New York the cd. However, at the beginning of the unedited performance, Kurt asks Grohl to play a beat to help him keep time.<br /><br />You always hear how raw NIRVANA was as a band, rightfully so, and that is on display after something in the way. They don't even have a set list authenticated. Moreover, there was no cue for the Meat Puppets to come on stage.<br /><br />Kurt starts to drink tea after something in the way when someone may have told him to hurry up. This leads to Kurt and Krist Novoselic discussing an old show called Davie & Goliath. Kurt mentions that there was episode in particular that scared him as a boy. And, that it wasn't very Christian. What's next? Oh, we're supposed to play Meat Puppets songs. Right, Kurt asks?<br /><br />The Meat Puppets come on stage very slowly. All in all there is about a 5 minute delay between songs. The banter is fantastic though. Kurt references Nine Inch Nails and a fan screams out for FREE BIRD. Kurt facetoiusly indicated that he was expecting somebody to say that.<br /><br />Krist starts playing Sweet Home Alabama and Kurt rips into shreds with mocking vocals. The crowd laughs. I hate Lynard Skynard! I really enjoyed this part of the unedited performance obviously. What song is next is asked again. What are they tuning a harp? Kurt asked that on Unplugged in New York and it makes sense now because why is this taking so long?<br /><br />NIRVANA runs through Plateau, Oh me, new in the Unedited version, and Lake of fire. Afterwards, Kurt plugs their cd. Thank you, Nirvana! You hear the Meat Puppets say that just like Unplugged in New York. What's next? Another delay. Extremely interesting though. Kurt asks any requests?<br /><br />The crowd shouts out Sliver a few times. Krist plays a bit of the riff. You get a Marigold reference here. Next, Somebody says in bloom. Kurt is bewildered by that. \\"How are we supposed to do In Bloom acoustically?\\" This created quite the dichotomy becauseAll apologies is next.<br /><br />All apologies is always the footage shown of Kurt when talking about his suicide. He looks and feels depressed with the context of said clip. However, he is talking to the fan about In Bloom and actually starts the song, but Pat isn't ready. He looks back at Krist and Pat says I'm sorry. The song is started again. The point is he was in a good mood prior to the song beginning. It is quite the juxtaposition when considering the all apologies footage on documentaries and newsroom B-roll.<br /><br />Grohl asks, after all apologies, why don't we do sliver? Kurt says, I don't think that would work well. Grohl agrees, thinking, yeah you have to scream on it. The subject of requests comes up again. D-7 is mentioned, but Kurt repudiates that by saying that isn't our song. The irony being they had performed covers all night. Kurt was actually who pointed that out. The crowd yells TEEN SPIRIT. Thankfully, the band didn't play it or even acknowledge the fan.<br /><br />A female fan yells for Rape me and Grohl asks was that Kennedy? He is so Funny! Kennedy was an MTV VJ at the time.<br /><br />I don't think MTV will let us play that one, Kurt said. This was a reference to the 1992 MTV VMAs. Ironically, NIRVANA was allowed to play Rape me on the Live N Loud special that air just one month later. Anyway....Krist starts telling the Led belly guitar story that you hear on Unplugged in New York. He tried to get David Geffen to buy it for him etc.<br /><br />This leads to Where did you sleep last night? The song was spectacular and maybe a poignant send off for Kurt? Cliche. I am typing this at work. 4a.m. Just pondering. Bottom line it was great, but what happened after? The cd and MTV performance just end. I always wanted this rectified. You sort of get this on the unedited performance.<br /><br />It gets conspicuously  quite in the room and Kurt begins to sign a few autographs. He hated to do that, but didn't seem disingenuous here. Krist is standing behind Kurt and appears to be getting ready to ask Kurt; well, what did you think of our performance? The unedited DVD fades here. I was disappointed by that because I wanted to see the ending in totality. Nevertheless, the unedited DVD is powerful. I highly recommend it, even if you have the MTV performance recorded like I did.<br /><br />Lastly, that Bare Witness documentary is on the special features. Lewis Largent, VP to MTV Programming, kept saying things like what are these songs they are playing on Unplugged? He intimates that the covers were played here for the first time. That is absolutely false. NIRVANA was playing Jesus doesn't want me for a sunbeam in their 1991 set-list. Where did you sleep last night? had been played, electrically, too. Finally, Largent was like SPECIAL GUEST.. maybe Pearl Jam? No, not Pearl Jam. Forget the debated Kurt/Eddie Vedder personal feud. It is a fact that Kurt thought Pearl Jam's music was less than mediocre. Additionally, he thought they were made by a producer to exploit the Seattle sound. In another words, Pearl Jam exemplified the grunge trend that he resented.<br /><br />Bare Witness also has a few fans talking about being there. It just seems pretentious to me. I.e  Perhaps, those \\"fans\\" didn't even attend the show to begin with. The documentary is salvaged, I guess, with a good interview of Alex Coletti. He was the Unplugged producer at that time. Nothing new was added. It is the exact same piece that aired on MTV, I still have on VHS, in fall 1999.<br /><br />C'mon I wrote a lot about this DVD...JUST BUY IT. You won't regret it if you are a NIRVANA fan!
B007M45PMU|5.0|A very refreshing record. Lyrically excellent and a good mix of playful tracks (Submarine and Big Parade) and meaningful tunes (Stubborn Love and Morning song).
B00899DR40|5.0|I bought this for my daughter who is just now starting to like JB. It's more tolerable than his previously released material, speaking from an adult perspective.

I was in my house on the seed &quot;Herobrine&quot; and, in the corner of my screen, I SAW HEROBRINE!!!!!!!!!!I looked in that direction and there was nobody there!I ran to the other side of the map and stayed there for 2 MINECRAFT DAYS!I thought Notch removed him in v0.3.0!This was in v0.4.0!WHAT THE HECK NOTCH!Other than that this game is pretty fun (not as fun as Pc, but still fun).
B007TBZ63Y|4.0|I just love the Rick Riordan books. The only problem I have is that he does 2 series at a time which is great cause you don't have to wait super long for another book, but the down side is that is can be super confusing and hard to remember where you left off and what characters know what. However the books are fun and easy enough to read the last book before the next one comes out.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I love this app. I'm a truck driver who likes to read when setting while loading/unloading. With my Kindle app on my Galaxy III I don't have to carry a bunch of books with me. Works great.<br /><br />I do have some trouble sometimes getting a new book to download, but that may have been my settings from my old phone.. Redid them again and downloads working again.<br /><br />I would recommend this app to everyone.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This series was amazing I just wished it didn't stop and I want more. The ending was more like a cliff hanger like this is not the last of Ana and Christen.
B008GXHOFW|1.0|My son played for about an hour last night and he LOVED it! Now this morning I have been trying to get it working for him again and every time it got past the LONG intro, it shut off and went back to the of home screen. Wish it would work because its a pretty cool game:(
B004SRPXWQ|5.0|I can trust time more then I can trust any of my other friends. He does not ask to borrow money and not pay it back. He does not borrow things and not bring it back. Last but not least he won't talk s*** about you behind your back
B0054VVRBQ|5.0|I own a late 2008 unibody 15\\" MacBook Pro running OSX 10.8.2. I chose the UHS-I ExpressCard reader because I've never used my Express34 Card Slot and I'd rather transfer photos directly from a card than from my camera body via a USB connection. Not only is this more convenient (no cables), it's faster.<br /><br />======SETUP=======<br />Setup was a breeze--mostly.<br />Simply go to Transcend's website, find the driver, and install it.<br /><br />But wait.<br /><br />If you're running OSX 10.8 Mountain Lion, you'll be stopped by Gatekeeper, which only allows you to run applications directly from the App Store or from Identified Developers. After some searching, I found you can disable Gatekeeper and allow your machine to install the driver. Just go under System Preferences --> Security and Privacy and check the \\"Anywhere\\" button at the bottom.  I'd recommend setting this back to its default after the installation is complete. Now that Gatekeeper is temporarily disabled, you can run the driver installation. When it's complete, it will want to restart your computer.<br /><br />After a restart, you can click the card into place. After that, you're ready to go.<br /><br />Some have said that this card reader causes their Macs to crash. I haven't experienced this yet. If I do, I'll edit this post.<br /><br />=======Physical Size, Build Quality======<br />The card was smaller than I imagined it would be.  But then again, I'm used to the larger cards that used to be the standard about 8-10 years ago.  On a MacBook Pro, the card goes into the slot with minimal effort. You'll hear a nice solid click when it's mounted in place.  To remove it, simply give it a push, and it will click back out again. If you're used to using an SD card (which, you should if you're buying this), the mechanism operates in very much the same way. I'm very happy that the card does not protrude from my MBP at all. It sits flush with the rest of the notebook body. This way, I can pop it in and out of my laptop bag without the card snagging. I've attached a photo so you can see what it looks like installed.<br /><br />=======Use & Performance========<br />Once the card is mounted in the card slot and you've installed the driver, it's ready to go. Simply plug in an SD/SDHC/SDXC card and you can access it just like any other card reader. You'll notice that there is now a bold rectangle icon on the top Apple menu bar. The only purpose this serves is to let you know the card is in place. You can click on it to power the card off, but that's the only thing it does. It would be nice if I could get rid of this, or if it had a few more options, like to safely remove (eject) the card, but this is only a minor complaint. You can always eject the card just like any other flash storage.<br /><br />In practice, the card reader is pretty fast. I notice a significant difference in transfer speeds compared to hooking my DSLR up via a USB cable. I have a SanDisk Extreme Pro 16GB UHS-I (95MB/s) card and decided to run some speed tests to find out how quick the card reader really was (at the time of this review, this is the fastest SD card available). I was surprised to find out that it was writing at about 65MB/s and reading at 75MB/s.  Obviously I'm not getting SanDisk's claimed 95MB/s. To be honest, I'm not sure whether this is a limitation of the SD card, or the card reader itself. I've seen other people with the same card get higher speeds, but I'm happy with the read speed. I imported 25 raw photos (~22MB each) recently and it didn't take more than 7 seconds to finish the import. Not bad!<br /><br />=======Summary   Pros-Cons=======<br /><br />-----PROs-----<br />-Works Great!<br />-Works... On a Mac!<br />-Mounts flush with the laptop. Does not protrude.<br />-Installation was quick.<br />-It's fast.... enough.<br />-Good build quality.<br />-Reliable.<br /><br />-----CONS-----<br />-Some better documentation, PLEASE. Seriously: There's 4x more Transcend promotional garbage in the packaging than instructions. In fact, there are almost no instructions other than \\"Go to our website for the driver before use.\\"<br />-I'm not getting the 95MB/s claimed performance from my SDHC card. (Could be a SanDisk limitation though)<br />-Had to disable Apple's Gatekeeper to install the driver. A minor inconvenience, but why is Transcend (a major manufacturer) not on Apple's \\"trusted\\" list??<br />-Annoying single-function icon always present on the menu bar. More functionality/options would be nice.<br />-Packaged in stupid \\"frustration\\" packaging. Honestly. It practically takes industrial scissors to get the packaging apart.<br />-I had to hunt for the driver a bit. It's listed under \\"accessories\\" and not \\"card readers\\"; Go figure.<br /><br />All in all, I'm pleased.  It's a simple card reader, it's fast, it works great, and setup was a breeze. I WOULD recommend this to a friend.
B0098VYCCE|5.0|I loved this movie it had action and excitement.  Loved that snow white won in the end.  It keeps you on edge to the point you do not know who is going to win.  I like the way try utilized the facts from the original story but changed things up to be more realistic.

B0086QS7N2|5.0|I have always liked Rush since I found out about them in 1978 with the release of Hemispheres. A buddy was already listening to them known through his older brother. His brother took us to school one morning and was jamming to hemispheres. I was hooked. Bought the album asap and began buying their other albums as well. Their music has a much different feel for me now days and it seems although the album is still good, it lacks something that the members of Rush had in the earlier days. Not disappointed in the album, it is more or less my taste of music has changed as well because I have not heard a big winner from the last several albums from Rush. I may like a song or two but that will be it. In the past, I usually liked the entire album with maybe one or two songs that I did not like.
B007THA4FI|5.0|Good book by a Great author. Far from her Harry Potter seruies, It's nice to see something for us aduts,
0316228532|2.0|I found this to be a complete bore.  Rowling's writing was brilliant throughout the Harry Potter Phenomenom but this - this was an absolute waste of my money.  I didn't expect the wizardry of Hogwarts nor did I expect Harry to make a cameo but I did expect writing that took me into another interesting world created by JKR - NOT SO.  I was taught that if I had nothing good to say, say nothing at all.  This review will end now before I go off on my REAL thoughts about A Casual Vacancy.

B00A6PD8RQ|5.0|Loved this movie!  Love anything with an Irish charm to it and of course the character learns a valuable life lesson.  Just love Disney Pixar movies but they sure seem like they're more for adults than children.  I don't think young children would understand the message of the movie.
B0015DWJX2|5.0|What a lovely book! What a perspective of the German Occupation!<br />It was so much fun reading Juliet's letters as well as those of the people involved in the story. I loved the characters..Each and every one of them.<br />The story did begin a bit slow for me, and I really didn't expect it to be told in form of letters, but as the story evolved, it totally got me sucked in. It felt like I had Juliet next to me, telling me about her life, her writing, her autobiography of Anne Bronte (which didn't sell very well, but still she was proud of writing)...and eventually about the most unusual way she got involved with the people from Guernsey (as Juliet says about this place \\" roughly seven miles long and five miles wide, with a population of 42 000 inhabitants\\").<br />Amelia, Dawsey, Isola, Booker,...and lovely, strong, bold Elizabeth! All of them are members of the Guernsey Literary and potato peel pie society. And yes, it's a funny name, but there is a lovely warm story behind it. They are all witnesses of the cruelty of the Germans and their Occupation and they are willing to share their story with Juliet, who is supposed to write down these heartbreaking (yet sometimes even witty) anecdotes. What was it like living on the Island during the War? What was it like after it? How hard it was for the Island inhabitants to send out all their kids to other places so they would be kept alive? Even while writing this review, thinking of this gives me the shivers!<br />There were so many things which made me fall in love with this book. Firstly, I liked Juliet's character a lot! She is so witty, intelligent, warm, responsible person. And at the end - she fascinated me!!!(but I won't spoil the surprise by telling you why).<br />I loved Elizabeth McKenna and the fact she was such a brave person...if there was a possibility to actually meet a book character in real life (yes it's silly but just imagine it) I would love to meet her! Boy oh boy, she is such a fighter..and you shall see why if you read this book.<br />I really enjoyed this book, it was such an easy read, yet it's a story you will remember always. I highly recommend it to everyone!ll see why if you read this book.<br />I really enjoyed this book, it was such an easy read, yet it's a story you will remember always.

B0049P1VHS|5.0|This series is as given in the title, \\"One of the best series I've ever seen or owned\\"! At first glance, it seems like its your typical zombie whatever BUT it's so much more. The choices we make that set us apart of who we are, what we're about and what we're capable of. Basically what this series is when the world goes down the crapper. Seriously a must own!
B008Z9YLV2|5.0|Very good movie.  I was entertained all the way through.  Read the book first and for the most part the movie did a good job.

B001C1066E|5.0|The one in the picture shows a limp one that looks like it has no stuffing. The one i got has stuffing and is plump, but maybe the company i got it from had a different picture for their product, but idk. There isnt much room for money b/c of all the stuffing, but maybe it'll flatten out after some use.<br /><br />My boyfriend thinks its stupid but i love it and it makes me so happy when i look at it :3 it looks just like the one from naruto.<br /><br />I've only had it for like a week, so i dont know how sturdy it is, but it doesnt feel cheap and i carry it around in my tote bag so it's getting tossed losely around with all my other junk in there and it looks as new as when i got it. The glasp is sturdy and i sometimes have a hard time opening it

1933492929|5.0|You can really learn from this book. Though this is more made up creatures and dinosaurs than there are real animals in this book, many real animals are incorporated in the made up creatures. She draws them in very realistic styles and even some im two to three other cartoonish styles. She illustrates the muscular and skeletal structures. Everthing in this book looks so realistic in structure and in detail.<br /><br />She is very creative. This book is so inspiring and if you can learn from observing then this book is perfect.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book. Totally worth the money.<br /><br />Also, i didnt buy this book from amazon so idk how the shipping experience will be for you
B009329ZF2|4.0|This was a fun movie. Sure it had some plot holes and the lead was annoying sometimes and Rihanna should have been thrown overboard but all in all a fun movie that delivered on action.
B00A6PD8RQ|4.0|I enjoyed the film, but I don't think I will watch this one repeatedly or will find myself quoting characters, scenes, etc.  I was very excited for Pixar's first true heroine, but unfortunately the story wasn't too original.
B004SBQGHS|5.0|It has been reviewed to death, but I want to get my name on the developer-appreciation list.  Who does not enjoy defeating those evil pigs?
B009KUANWG|5.0|I seriously need to go to addiction therapy over this song.  I think I have listened to this song 100 times this past week so far.  This one song is eternally looped on my media player!  Adele's absolutely glorious, captivating, smooth as silk vocals are mesmerizing on this song.  She sings from her soul and she puts her passion for music and what she is singing about on her sleeve - without restraint and fear and that is what makes her stand out as a legend.  I adore the 77 orchestra accompaniment, escalating tension, suspensful and has a real dramatic effect - paired all together makes this song perfect especially for a James Bond movie - which in my opinion makes it my favorite Bond theme.
B008L40Q7E|5.0|Very good story line, well written, and nicely concluded. This was my first Bond book and I can't wait to read the next one. Reading it on Kindle Fire was a great experience. No bulky book, no worries about losing my place, and I could make the print bigger for easier reading.

0679746323|3.0|The gist of this book was that Mao was basically an evil monster...an anomaly in Chinese history.<br /><br />Is this statement actually true? For one thing, if a scholar is going to write a political biography of a major 20th century figure such as Mao, they should balance their unrelenting implied claims that the fellow was pure evil (the term \\"evil\\" is more of a moral condemnation -implied or stated- rather than a concept used by scholars)with the positive reforms he and his party had put into place.<br /><br />Next, one doesn't really get an idea of what communism meant to leaders of revolutions in Third World nations.  It had little to do with socialism or communism, and more to do with \\"developmentalism.\\"  In other words, the leadership wished to industrially develop their nations without the economic, political and military intrusion of Western corporations and banks.<br /><br />Now, was Mao an anomaly within the context of Chinese history?  For example, when we review the Taiping Rebellion of 1859-64 one might become less hasty to \\"judge.\\"  For one thing, the West (especially Britain) helped reorganize the incompetent and corrupt imperial forces (under the leadership of Charles \\"Chinese\\" Gordon) so they could eventually defeat the rebels. (The rebels attempted social reforms based on shared property...a deep horror to capitalists and big landowners.)<br /><br />What price did the Taiping rebels pay for their defeat?  Most scholars believe approximately 20 to 30 million civilians and soldiers were killed...most of them were Taiping rebels and their supposed supporters.  If one places this number within the population context of the time, one can deduce that the number Mao was supposedly resposible for killing was less.<br /><br />Where are the \\"well researched\\" texts that focus on the \\"monsters\\" involved with slaughtering a relatively greater number of Chinese during the Taiping Rebellion.  Of course, we could also attempt to guess the number of Chinese who died of disease, famine and starvation under both the imperial regime and the decades of political and social chaos enjoyed by the Chinese thereafter.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|Interesting charactors.  I liked the development of the story.  I think some of the sex scenes were a bit much.  The story would be good without every other page being about their sexcapades.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|Calculator Plus Free is a marvelous alternative to the Motorola Electrify's system calculator. It has full memory functions in both portrait and landscape orientations; in landscape there are parentheses for simple algebraic functions. The history function comes in very handy for long calculations when you need to check your work; you can clear it when you're finished. Also, it is easier on the eye than the built-in. I recommend the free version as the ads are out of the way and unobtrusive.
B005JZBPHS|5.0|Itz a awesome show and got to me in awesome timing:)) if you want a new show to get into buy this:)))) my friend got me into this show and I just had to have it I 1st got it off of eBay they said it was new and never opened I got it and the disks didn't work... Was really sad but then I came to amazon and found it I was one happy kid:) it brand new and everything works awesome:)

B000HKW7E0|5.0|This movie is a &#34;must&#34; for our household during the holiday season.  While some of the language is a little &#34;salty&#34;, we continually laugh - even after seeing this movie more times than we can count.  It's simply hilarious!
B008M0NDOK|2.0|I was really excited, because I thought this would be a great product for playing Nova 3, well it isn't. All the controllers do exactly what they are supposed to do, but when playing Nova 3 online, it has no setting for joystick sensitivity. I couldn't control the weapon. It either moved to far to the left with just a little push, or it moved to far to the right. It is not controllable. It works better for Asphalt 7, than anything else, but there again when playing online, it is too hard to use to control the car. If you are playing it in Career Mode,then the controls (joystick) works fine. If the game makers would make the program so there is more settings for sensitivity, then it could be a great controller. I will be returning mine for now. I hope the makers of Duo Gamer inform the makers of the apps that they need to code for sensitivity in the interface of the program, then I will buy another one.

B007SGLZP8|2.0|I have read all of Mr. Grisham's books, and he has given me many wonderful hours of fun and excitement. For that I thank him. But for the past few years, he has also given me too much boredom and a vague feeling of being slighted, as is the case with this novel. I liked the beginning, the premise, but seemingly half of the book is mired down by the ongoing description of the making of a phony movie. Really boring stuff. If it had been a real movie, I would have gotten up and walked out. Likewise, I know that I could have just stopped reading, but I am a loyal fan, and I believe in Mr. Grisham's abilities, so I stuck with the book to the last disappointing page. And that is probably the last time I will pay full price to read another John Grisham novel. But I am still thankful for all the good company over the years, and I most certainly feel that I have, on average, gotten my money's worth.
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|I loved watching this movie.  It was wonderful to see what happened back in the day and to see what the Help had to endure from their employers.
B008Y1YK9Y|5.0|I started this movie not really expecting much.  It's the third part of an unplanned (as far as I know) trilogy.  I really felt like it was the best of the franchise; it tied back into the first one quite nicely.
B001UV4XFG|5.0|I totally love the Twilight Saga!  I watch it and the other movies quite often. Especially the weekend before the opening of Breaking Dawn Part 2.
1451696191|5.0|Seriously, this book is amazing!  (The movie is, too! But this is only about the book)  I wish that I had read this book when I was in high school.  I wasn't an outcast, by any stretch of the imagination, though I also didn't have a ton of friends, and I feel like this book would have made me feel accepted.  Just knowing that I wasn't as alone as I sometimes felt, would have helped a ton.<br /><br />The story is beautifully told through a series of letters, which is an enjoyable way to convey the tale.  The characters are lovable, but not perfect.  It actually made me a little nostalgic for high school, which I didn't think was possible.<br /><br />The author, Stephen Chbosky, is an excellent human being and this book alone, makes me sure I would be the first in line for anything else he chooses to write!
B0064MPXFA|4.0|It just shows what real politics is all about.  I watch it if there is nothing else on TV at the time.
0812550706|5.0|This was one of the first science fiction books I ever read; I had to read it as part of my seventh grade English curriculum.  I remember enjoying it immensely at the time and so just recently read it again.<br /><br />It's extremely well written and engaging.  I do not normally read within the science fiction genre, but this is definitely one of my favorite books.  Card creates a believable universe and introduces it in such a way that you want to know more (thankfully he's written an entire series around it!).  Ender is relatable as a narrator and you begin to feel what he feels.  I have introduced this book to several of my friends and will continue to do so.<br /><br />I haven't read the rest of the series, yet, but am looking forward to doing so.
B009CG2YDE|4.0|I love this game, it has no investment, does not force you to return, give upgrade burdens or is pushy. I can pick it up again today or next month and there is still continuity in the game.
B00785P2QC|5.0|this game is so fun and also you need to be good with strategy and also u should play it it is fun
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I absolutely love this game!!!!! very fun and addicting! GET THIS AWESOME GAME!!!!!!!!!!! I was debating wether to get this but when I did I loved it!!!
B0076DCT2G|3.0|A nice Corey-Brenner mash up for DeMille fans but a little ponderous in the middle.  A strong finish though and good depth to many of the characters.  I won't be visiting Yemen anytime soon!
B009CPIR9K|3.0|....handguns which appear identical to WWII german kit, such as luger pistols, appear to work perfectly well in the absence of an atmosphere....<br /><br />Unless you're speaking of flintlock pistols, a modern pistol with a unitary cartridge/projectile will work perfectly well in a vacuum. The oxidizing agent is within the cartridge.<br /><br />...And without causing the character who fires one while standing up without support to fall over backwards in the moon's one/sixth gravity...<br /><br />The kick will be the same whether or not one is in full 1G or 1/6G. Action = reaction, so you still have the acceleration of the projectile leaving the muzzle acting against the inertia (mass) of the Nazi-naut. One might lose one's footing or slip as the pull of gravity will not \\"anchor\\" the shooter as well to the \\"ground\\".<br /><br />Movie I rate as a \\"6\\" on a scale of \\"10\\". The action started to lag about 1/3 way through.<br /><br />Not a bad flick, though not sure if it was worth the wait.<br /><br />Richmond Hill, GA.
B008ELUEQC|5.0|I love it. Has the folksy sound that he loves so much. Places his personality in his songs with all the OH YEAH and use of bagpipes. A true piece of art. I love it.
B003YDUUHS|4.0|Was a fabulous 2 disc set!!!! all vids look wonderful. Only lost a star due to the exclusion for a couple of videos but probably due to copyright issues and I'm nit exactly sure which ones just know there are a couple left out.<br /><br />Sounds and looks great BUY IT!!!!!
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Enjoyed the twists and turns and the knowledge in thinking things out. Very interesting reading and I would recommend this novel to anyone that enjoys intelligent reading.
B000FCKGPC|4.0|Well I enjoyed the book quite a bit. It's not as good as the first three though, but GRRM has not quite turned into Robert Jordan yet. Some parts felt a bit like filler, but it makes overall sense once you get to the end. Some characters needed to be fleshed out and developed a little more... and some characters needed to be \\"resolved\\" (hehehe *evil*). My advice to the reader is not to get too overly attached to any character... every time you do something terrible happens to them.<br /><br />I think the most annoying part about this book is that it gets really good towards the end (the beginning and middle can be quite slow at times for some of the characters), but since you know the next book is going to be about the other characters, you know you won't be finding out wtf happened after the end of this one until the sixth book comes out. This also seems to have been done mainly for commercial reasons to stretch out the series a bit. However, I would still say it's worth the money, it's still GRRM, and it's still got some really good parts. I was really interested in the Cersei POVs and they didn't disappoint.
B008MU8ZNO|5.0|Hi Camp, great theme song by the Dickies..... . . . . . . . . . . . .
B0085RQLXK|1.0|I find it amusing to even see 3 star reviews here much less 5 stars. Aerosmith, oh how the mighty have fallen. Is this the same band who released \\"Get Your Wings, Toys in the Attic, or Rocks\\"? Even Pump is better than this drivel. This band sold their balls with whatever musical creativity and integrity they had left for the almighty dollar. They can't even sit down as a band and write their own tunes without the outside influences, pathetic. So this is the return to form that Perry continuously fed us leading up to the release of this turd of an album? Wow, that is the biggest joke of the year. They are doing nothing but tarnishing their own legacy and quite frankly this band being sober does them no favors musically. They burned out and fried their brains long ago. Perry knows it as with the rest of the band(thus the reasons for their long delays and problems) but in the end they settled for Tyler's trash anyway. No cohesion here whatsoever and it's very obvious. They also had the audacity to call Kiss a comic rock band, take a look at this album cover for starters,  which sums up their music perfectly, lol. If someone left this album at my place, I would keep it in the bathroom when the toilet paper gets low. 0 STARS!

B007B6VOG0|5.0|One of the best albums of 2012. The blend of hip hop with inde pop/rock is certainly going to be the future of music. We are already seeing more hip hop producers crossing over.
B00005A0N5|5.0|Great album. A lot of great songs on here that are worth the listen. Tarja's vocals are unique on this album. I like this album musically a whole lot. I'm glad I finally got this album for my birthday, because it's great. Definitely one of my favorite Birthday presents. This album has a great starter, good finisher. There isn't a single filler song on the album. The only thing negative is how some songs sound the same, with the same pattern and whatnot. Other than that, this is a great album.<br /><br />Songs:<br />\\"Stargazers\\"- Great opening. The chorus is extremely catchy. The third verse is my favorite part of the song, you can't miss it. The whole song is great, catchy, and if I could sing as high as Tarja does, then this is one I would sing-along too. I love the lyrics to this song. 5/5.<br />\\"Gethsemane\\"- Another brilliant masterpiece from Nightwish. My favorite of the album. The bridge, the chorus... it's great. Nothing wrong with this song at all. This is one I would definitely recommend. 5/5.<br />\\"Devil & the Deep Dark Ocean\\"- I wasn't quite sure with the male vocals (provided by Tapio Wilska) in this song, but I still love it. This entire song is great, once again. Like the first two songs of this album, once again, I would give 5/5.<br />\\"Sacrament of Wilderness\\"- I see why Nightwish chose this to be their first single from this album. The chorus is catchy. I love the vocals in this song, once again. 4.5/5.<br />\\"Passion and the Opera\\"- I don't think there's something wrong with this song. I love the ending, the chorus. Nothing wrong with this song, I think. 5/5.<br />\\"Swanheart\\"- The first slow one that comes into place. It's decent, I think. The lyrics are beautiful, but it's just not as great as the other songs on the album. It's a song that I'll sometimes skip. 3.5/5.<br />\\"Moondance\\"- For an instrumental piece, it's pretty darn good. It's a fun one to dance too, I think so, even though it's not a dance song. 5/5.<br />\\"The Riddler\\"- I just can't getinto this song that much. This isn't one that I like very much. To me, this is the least impressive of the whole album. I skip this song a lot. 3/5.<br />\\"The Pharaoh Sails to Orion\\"- Again, wasn't sure how I felt with Tapio in this song. I really liked his input. I also love Tarja's vocals. Still, I feel there's something missing in this song. 4/5.<br />\\"Walking in the Air\\"- A really nice ballad. It's a good ending song. Nothing wrong with this song. It's different from pretty much every song. 5/5.<br />\\"Sleeping Sun\\"- A nice ballad, again. But I feel like something is missing through it. Not sure what, but it's still a good song. 4/5.<br /><br />Overall, the album was a pressure listening too. If Amazon would allow half-stars, I would've probably giving it a 4.5/5. The songs are great on this album, though some feel a little rough. Definitely worth purchasing. Worth the listen, worth the price.

B008JFUUIA|3.0|What if your only goal in attending college was to appease your father so he'll subsidize your true ambitions? Would you simply slack off and plan the future you really want? Or would you find a group of students anxious to have you and stick it out?<br /><br />  During the opening scene of the film, we're introduced to the Bellas, an all-girl a capella group from the fictional Barden College who are performing at Lincoln Center. During a solo, Aubrey (played by Anna Camp) vomits on stage and turns the Bellas into a national joke. The following semester, new student Beca Mitchell (played by Anna Kendrick) meets Aubrey (Camp) and Chloe (played by Brittany Snow) who are desperate to rebound from their previous embarrassment. Becca (Kendrick), however, is only biding time in college to please her father while composing mash-ups on the laptop in her dorm room. Conversely, Fat Amy (played by Australian comedic actress Rebel Wilson) is confident in her singing ability and anxious to join the Bellas, who used to be composed solely of traditionally beautiful co-eds with vocal talent. Then, while singing in the shower, Beca's talent is discovered by her dorm-mate Chloe. While Beca is noticeably unnerved by the uninvited presence of another nude member of the student body, Chloe refuses to leave until Beca joins her in song. After discovering the fact that Becca has yet to attend a single class, her father (a professor at Barden played by John Benjamin Hickey) tells her that if she wants him to pay her way to Los Angeles she must attend her classes and join at least one student organization. Despite performing Cups at her audition, Beca's invited to join the Bellas along with Fat Amy and the nearly inaudible Lily (played by Hana Mae Lee). And so began a new season for the Bellas under the dictatorial direction the veteran performer with a nervous stomach, Aubrey.<br /><br />  Now, I wasn't expecting much a movie intent on lampooning something whose ridiculous nature is pretty self-evident. Still, there were things about it that I liked. Beca's unfiltered contempt for college clich&eacute;s and the majority of the student body inspires a lot of laughs. At the same time, the gross-out factor is in full-effect during this music-oriented comedy and I don't really care for that kind of humor. Also, Beca's rejection of Jesse (a kindhearted coworker at the campus radio station played by Skylar Astin) wear thin long before she relents. Since the problem I have with this film is essentially the same as the one I had with Bridesmaids, I'll give it the same score.self-evident. Still, there were things about it that I liked.

B00936A0RU|3.0|For the first time, your family's livelihood is threatened. At the same time, you're trying to get out from under the shadow of your elders, one of whom is a local legend. Which takes priority?<br /><br />  The Bondurant brothers are the owners and operators of the premier bootlegging operation in Franklin County, Virginia. Jack, the youngest (portrayed by Shia LaBouef) is assisting Howard (played by Jason Clarke) and Forrest (played by Tom Hardy) when he witnesses a shooting. The gunman, Floyd Banner (played by Gary Oldman), locks eyes with young Jack before he departs for the operation's headquarters. Once there, Forrest (Hardy) hires a new waitress. Her name is Maggie Beauford (played by Jessica Chastain) and she is a former dancer who's recently moved to Franklin County from Chicago. Shortly after that, the bootlegging business is confronted with an obstacle. Charlie Rakes, another new arrival and a Special Deputy. Rakes (played by Guy Pearce) tells Forrest that, from now on, he and his superiors will be given a percentage of the profits form their business. Forrest, as expected, sends Rakes away and threatens to kill him if he returns. After his departure, Forrest organizes a meeting of his colleagues in the illegal alcohol business. His hope is to rally them into a resistance movement. \\"Bootleggers of the world unite\\" if you will. While they are receptive, initially, it's only a matter of time before they capitulate to Deputy Rakes. In the meantime, Jack has become enamored with Bertha Minnix. Bertha (played by Mia Wasikowska) is the daughter of a local German Baptist preacher who forbids Bertha from seeing Jack once he attends one of his services drunk and leaves abruptly.<br /><br />  This film is supposedly based on a historical novel written by the grandson of LaBouef's character. I don't know how faithful the film is to the novel or how historically accurate the novel is, but as far as I'm concerned, the movie failed. It isn't particularly awful, but it's not all that interesting either. I am surprised that former Disney star Shia LaBouef has actual talent, but he does and we've seen it. I am not at all surprised by the fact that Tom Hardy is talented as he has demonstrated it on numerous occasions. Maybe Lawless would be more engrossing if its release had predated the HBO series about Prohibition era bootlegging, Boardwalk Empire. Maybe not. All I can say is that I was underwhelmed.

B009HV2JT8|1.0|The book was an interesting read. In fact, I made a comment to a colleague about how much research must have had to go into the writing of this book.  It was almost weird, but kept me reading until the end. I was excited to see how the movie would play out and allude to the historical markers of Abe Lincoln's life, unfortunately, I was disappointed. It is just another vampire movie with scenes that are meant to scare the hell out of you instead of show the duality of what might have been Lincoln's other life.<br /><br />I would not spend another $1.99 to see if I knew then, what I know now.
B008Z9YLV2|3.0|It was ok; don't know what all the hoopla is about.  Not crazy about teens and children killing each other.

YOU CAPTURED THE MAN AND HIS LEGACY AND SHOWED HOW THE ONES AROUND HIM WERE USING HIM WHY THE ACCUSERS DID WHAT THEY DID. MONEY IS TRULY THE ROOT OF ALL EVIL AND MICHAEL JACKSON; AKA THE KING OF POP, WAS TREATED SO UNKIND BY SO MANY, WHILE ALL HE WANTED WAS TO MAKE THE WORLD A BETTER PLACE. THANKS YOU AGAIN FOR SENDING ME THIS BOOK. MUCH LOVE TO YOU AND I LOOK FORWARD TO READING MORE FROM YOU
B00013RC8O|5.0|This is a great movie with lots of action backed by a story of a man's love for his wife.  If you like chase scenes, this movie is for you.  Unfortunately the car is destroyed at the end.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Rick Riordan did it again.  Great story line mixing mythology with modern times.  I can't wait for the next one!
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|The best Marvel movie so far in a four-disc combo.  Need I say more?  Great features as always.  If I had to spend any more than what I did this would have been a waste as I don't need DVD or Blu-ray 3D; however, at the time of purchase, this cost less on Amazon that the standard Blu-ray in-store.
B004132I20|5.0|Where has this been all my life??  Oh, this is a great TV show!!  The chemistry between Benedict and Martin is perfect!! I couldn't have asked for a better series to come out right now!  Just the way this show was brought together and portrayed is awesome.  The creators and writers are great Sherlock Holmes fans themselves so they know what they are doing.  I loved this series so much, I have Season One and Season Two.  If you are looking for a great series with characters with depth and chemistry then this would be a series for you!
B0058VW36U|5.0|Fun game a great way to kill time! A fun game that teases the brain. Fun and fast an great deal.
B00026ZG10|5.0|Like the title says, yeah, I know... but this movie is just awesome!  James Cameron is a good screenplay writer and director for this film.  I want this to come out in Blu Ray, but I'll have to settle for DVD now.  I had this movie DVR'd for quite some time, but I kept watching it so much, my husband just told me to buy it!  The scenes with Arnold and Tom are too funny and Bill Paxton just steals the show in his scenes!  The women in this film are awesome as well!  My only beef with this movie is the final scene, I wanted to say, couldn't they have been given better nicknames?!  Doris and Boris?!  Oh well, the movie is still good. I would recommend this to anyone who is looking for a little action and comic relief.
B004S5FW1U|5.0|A moving story of sanity, learning to trust and falling in love when all hope is lost. Quite a few funny moments to enjoy along the way.
B003HARV4S|5.0|This is one of those movies which grab you right away.  Set in the olden days, when they still used lamps for the stage, comes the story of a magician who can it seems, bring ghosts right into the room with you.  Of course, it doesn't start out that way.  A teenage romance fated to fail due to class differences and the story of how they reunite.  If you are looking for a little romance and a little mystery this would be a movie for you.  I really enjoyed it and bought it to watch again and again.

1469984202|5.0|What a great series! I was hooked immediately and then it just kept getting better. While the storytelling is excellent, it was more so the thought-provoking nature of the story that was so riveting. It makes you ponder a lot of \\"what-if's\\" & makes you question if the guys you thought were the \\"bad guys\\" aren't actually the good guys, etc. I enjoyed the suspense aspect as well, and the characters you get attached to along the way. Highly recommend!!
0385341008|5.0|This is a beautiful love story you will want to read over and over and over again.  The audio is also very well done.  You will love the gentle, tender tone of the book and you will carry the voices of the characters in your head for many days afterward.

B003V5CFV8|5.0|The sound track is awesome and Clooney give a star performance with the help of Delmar and Pete.  The Coen brothers captured the culture and mores of the Thirties.
B008OW1S3O|5.0|Alt-J's approach to modern rock/pop music is unique. It's natural, when hearing a new artist, to compare their sound with another band for a frame of reference. I can't really think of another artist who I could confidently say was similar to Alt-J, nor can I categorize this band. Expecting another \\"alternative\\" band when I listened to them for the first time, I was, instead, immediately intrigued because there was obviously something different going on with Alt-J. Their use of vocal harmonies, ebb & flow and killer hooks stands out from the usual rehashed mishmosh we are afflicted with these days from so many so-called alternative rock bands. It may take a few listens to latch onto the band but if you're looking for something novel, you can't go wrong. It's good to hear some genuine creativity injected into the fray of modern music.
B009D5VNLS|3.0|The movie was great on my Roku! But any other device it was gritty and difficult to view. I wish there was an option to trade up for the HD version, rather than buying a completely separate movie. :/

B00A12VW86|4.0|4 albums in 4 months to me spelled some good, some bad. Especially as the albums releases moved along, I expected things to get watered down a bit but to my surprise, I'm enjoying DOS! as much as UNO!<br /><br />Big Green Day fan so it would have to really be a stinker for me not to like it but I REALLY like it. Not your typical storyline album like American Idiot or 21st Century...good variety with diverse mix of sounds akin to the early years with new flavors. This is the third album I can hear influences from the Beatles.<br /><br />Nice work again boys.
B009LE7AU4|4.0|I loved Duran Duran in the early to mid - 80s and was so disappointed when they canceled their show this summer.  I heard John Taylor talking about his book on First Wave and thought I would read it.  It was easy to read, very interesting and provides information that most teenage fans were ignorant of.  He skips over some of his career, but hits the highlights, his inspirations, frustrations and love/sex life without too much detail.
B009B50QOU|5.0|Didn't buy this until DOS! came out and I figured things would be watered down with 3 albums in 4 months. However, I'm very impressed with the diversity and classic GD sound. BIG fan!

B009NQKXYK|2.0|I was very excited to see this movie, partly based on the obvious links to it being an &#34;Alien&#34; prequel, but what Ridley Scott and his four screenwriters delivered was a bloody, gory, pathetic mess that leaves all of the evocative questions it asked unanswered. All the Creator says is &#34;Why did you come here?&#34; and then it kills everyone for no particular reason? Are we to understand that our &#34;gods&#34; are vicious thugs who revile us for no reason? Did they create the Alien creatures to wipe us out? Why did they fail? What went wrong? None of those questions are answered. I wanted to like this movie. I liked some of the 3D effects, but not much else. A movie with a lot of promise that only delivered a high body count and predictable ending. Very disappointing. I hope Scott's &#34;Blade Runner&#34; sequel is better than this confusing bloody mess.

0062068423|2.0|In short: I couldn't help but to compare this to the Stieg Larssen books, and it came up sorely lacking. Save yourself the time and skip this one if you are looking for an engaging and truly suspenseful plot with interesting twists. It is trite, overwrought and tries to be too clever for its own good. Characters are far from multi-dimensional, and especially the female characters are reduced to pure stereotype. Other reviews have noted multiple factual errors in this book, which doesn't surprise me considering the undeveloped writing style.<br /><br />Plot:<br />Starts out promising, as there was a good buildup to the events at the toll plaza, but there are early reveals that reduce the tension and suspense, and detracted from the experience. The use of the toll plaza incident as a premise for Harry's career move feels contrived and doesn't add to the narrative. I felt that there was a strange lack of suspense at parts of the plot that could have really engaged the reader if written well. On the other hand, the foreshadowing used is heavy handed and in the end, I found it overly simplistic, and rather improbable with maybe one or two good twists. On plot alone, one may find it an okay book for a plane, at times engaging enough to forget that you're stuck in a metal tube for a number of hours, but not good enough to take time away from daily life/better books.<br /><br />Side Note (unrelated to the plot, but something that bothered me enough to mention):<br />I was unhappily surprised by how Jo Nesbo relegated all of the female characters to be victims of both physical and emotional violence. They existed in the plot only as items to be manipulated for their bodies, or as throwaway characters to be killed. The only ones that survived were because they had a man that cared for them enough to exact justice on their male oppressors. I noticed an inkling of this at the beginning of the book, wondering if this was to make a point and then provide a contrast at the end tocontradict this trope, or if this is just his twisted view of the world. As I got closer to the end, I was rather more in suspense waiting to see if he would redeem himself or if that was really the way he was going to treat the female characters (NOT the kind of suspense this book needed). Sadly, the latter turned out to be the reality. There are too many stereotypes about women to count, and the plot line about the beautiful woman that rather improbably begins to like the main character reeks of young adult fiction. I referenced the Stieg Larssen books above, as the contrast between the two series in this manner could not be greater. The primary female characters in the Stieg Larssen books think and act for themselves, are not victims or merely pawns to be moved around by men. I cannot even imagine a character like Monica Figuerola showing up in this book, she would be such a threat to the carefully constructed patriarchal overtones that it would never happen. Perhaps the book should have stayed in the 1940s as its attitudes toward women would be more welcome there.
B0058YPGSY|5.0|Awesome series cant wait for more. Ready for season five to be released for sale. Can't get enough of it
B008XG1X18|5.0|Pinterert has given me many ideas from cooking, decorating & shopping !  It is simple to follow.  I mostly love the reciepes and have used some of them.
B0034G4P94|5.0|[Rounded up from 4-1/2 Stars] I generally like older/classic movies more than current movies that are sometimes too CGI-heavy, but realistically, a few of the great, older movies are dated, and unfortunately &#34;Rocky&#34; is one of them, assuring &#34;Warrior&#34; as the champ over &#34;Rocky,&#34; by a knockout.  I heard this movie was great, but it was even better than that.  Centering around a father and his two grown sons, all three of whom are estranged from each other, it culminates in the most unlikely scenario.  Recommended for anyone who loves great movies, not just male action-movie fans or UFC fans, especially as a great brothers movie, and, yes, it's also better than &#34;The Fighter&#34; (Mark Wahlberg).  Nick Nolte should have won the Oscar for Supporting Actor but unfortunately had to go up against someone who's been in the industry even longer, Christopher Plummer (who won for &#34;Beginners,&#34; best known for &#34;The Sound of Music&#34;); otherwise, the Oscar was his.  Just in time for Christmas, &#34;Warrior&#34; is a powerful, surprisingly moving, can't-miss gift idea that packs a punch.

B0023SDPS6|5.0|All the Longmire books are excellent! I could hardly put them down while reading. Loved the characters and the writing style and the adventures. Much better than the TV show. I like the characters and stories much more than on TV.
B004JN1D2I|5.0|Before HBO decided to make this huge, these books sucked me in and I was hooked. These books are great, a little bit of everything - magic, mystery, love, hate, fights, deceit.... it just screams to be read. The characters are easily loved (or hated) and Martin creates a beautifully written, spellbinding world that keeps you coming back for more.
B000OLLC4S|5.0|A great continuation of Child's recipes and cooking style. I'm ooking forward to reading it all and trying new recipes.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|I have been looking forward to this book for a while and Martin did not disappoint. This book had me entranced from the first page. I definitely recommend this to anyone
B004W2UBYW|4.0|I learned a lot about Steve Jobs as a person in this book. It's definately a woth while book to read
B009PAETCG|1.0|so I got this app and I read the reviews and 3 said it sucks but I got it anyway. it keep taking me to the app store. do not get it. it sucks.
B0052UZIFA|4.0|When the kids are bored, they pull this one out.... Good for hours of fun! It's a blast and there's tons of things to do!
B0076DCT2G|5.0|Excellent book!! There is a mixture of suspense & humor. Book character, John Corey, has some humorous &#34;one liners&#34; that make you laugh. Once again, Nelson DeMille wrote a great novel!
B005D9MUWY|4.0|I love this product... Just awesome how it learns my texting habits and starts to finish sentences for me.. Also, the speech to text translation is incredible as well! When I rebuild my phone, this is the first product I install.. WHen I got a new phone, this was the first product I installed... Great product!
B00AA7O22U|5.0|If you like lots of fast action and suspense, this is the movie to watch.<br />I hope there is a part 3.
B004SBULWE|5.0|Excellent program, has never let me down. Helps save your battery by killing apps running in the background. A must have for any tablet or cel.
B009HQ9UHC|1.0|It was too hard to understand and play. I would not recommend it at all. Nothing like angry birds I quickly was bored.
B009KS4XRO|2.0|At first look this is a great app.  Fun.. lots of Color and interaction.  But the app moves veryyy slow. The screen freezes and I get bumped off frequently.  I definitely got what I paid for as it was FREE.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|This book is full of surprises!!!!  I didn't like this book as well as some of the Grisham books, but it was a good read.
B004YM6JI2|4.0|This season was awesome and made up for the lack of Sara Gambles disaster in S6. Introduced something new and original.
B009AP4MGE|5.0|Amazon's access to episodes of Glee is perfect for the person that missed episodes and wants to avoid commercials.  The vidoe downloads and plays perfectly without any glitches! Much better than Hulu!
B001BR5NN0|5.0|I love John Hughes movies because they are entertaining but with most of his movies there's a message in it as well. A lot of people don't get it and some do. Present movies are nothing compare to John Hughes. They're soulless and have no point except stupidity written on it.
B008S0TAY6|5.0|I can't pick a favorite tome of fables, because to be honest - they are all filled with such brilliance, it's impossible! But, gentle reader, they are an entwined tale, so please, start with volume 1. ;)
B009AMALLM|2.0|Be for warned this is a cash-cow movie. This time I didn't go off the expectations from the trailer like PA3.(Which I think is false ads) And as I predicted it wasn't anything compared to the trailer. First off the way the story goes absolutely no  sense and false pretense from the original again. But there is good news, it ended the story with the characters but after the credits there is a spinoff ending video of another story that is probably going to be the next 4 mess ups.
B0049P1ZZQ|5.0|Love the series- it was most original in Series 1. Kid love this- after all Zombies are all the rage :)
B005LAII1C|4.0|I had doubts on this movie but when I saw in theater, I couldn't stop laughing. The End is want got me the most. LOL
B0063IH60K|5.0|I enjoy this app.  It does exactly what it says and is a great way to pass the time if you're bored.  Quick download and installation, runs smoothly.
B004LWZWGK|3.0|I'm glad they concluded the Dark Knight but it just seem they stretch too long and felt like Batman needed a better respected villain than Talia or Bane. Plus IN MY OPINION it didn't fit because Bane is a Mercenary and Talia is Ra's Al Gul's daughter. I just don't see how they fit? Probably I'm used to the original story? I feel like one of the top villains like Riddler, or Penguin. Some one with a enough power and juice that was present in DKR, Again that's my opinion
B007S7U4AY|4.0|No muy lejos de la realidad, seguramente en algun lugar alguien se pueda sentir identificado con algo asi.  Me gusto la narrativa, amena, conmovedora, entretenida.Excelente el manejo de la historia.La recomiendo.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this app to death on my Kindle Fire,  but really Amazon? It has been nearly a week since the 0. 5. 0 update has been realesed in Apple app stores. All my friends have an iPhone 4s and now since I can't update my Kindle,  I have no one to play with!!! :(
B002W7P5UE|5.0|This may seem tame by today's standards but Hitchcock was so far ahead.  Cary Grant is great as the non-innocent innocent - watch it and you will see what I mean.
B007SGM084|5.0|I thought it was different.  When someone thalked to me about the book I said no. But others kept saying:  readit you'll love it, so I decieded for the free trial and ha to buy it immediatly.Very, very good.
B001R6G34I|5.0|The True king of the Monster movies.  Its just a great flick that technology can't improve.  This was the first blockbuster.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|It's very good.  I gave this rating because I find it excellent.I would highly recomend this product. Thank you verymuch.
B004498KPU|5.0|I guess anything that has MJ in it is loved by me! I can't watch anything that he is in that I would not love!
B00A6N8F4Y|4.0|Good storyline, but too violent. Good actors, and acting. Liked the double ending. Not recommend for anyone under 17. Overall a good movie.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|I bought this because the reviews said it was a mix of adventure puzzles and hidden object.  I HATE purely hidden object games, and this was a great mix of puzzles and hidden object scenes.  Reminded me of the adventure games I played as a kid - enjoyed my rainy afternoon solving the mystery!
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|This is a really fun game. Its cool because even once you do a level or get to a new area, there's still more to replay for. I really like this game. Its entertaining and a good challenge. And FREE!!!!!
B009YX02T8|5.0|if 10 stars was available, I would have gave it to this soundtrack. This is the second soundtrack of the Twilight Saga I have purchased. I like the BD pt 1 soundtrack, but not all the songs I listen to everyday. All 14 tracks are beautiful. I'm sad the saga is over, but the music choice was very well put in the movie. I'm going to see the movie again!
B009VB97EY|1.0|This movie would not play for more than 3 minutes straight. It kept stopping and starting and sometimes going back to the beginning. After about 15 minutes of it we shut it off and rented it at Redbox.
B009LL4LMM|5.0|Addictive And Cute, Easy To Figure Out And Play. Our Hero The Mighty Adorable Jellyfish Squishes And flopsTo Your AD  Whim In An Original And Addictive Little<br />Game.
B0092MKFIY|4.0|Good new alternative band in the style of the Killers, Muse and Young The Giant.  Demons is a great song.
B0073XV2W2|5.0|Not as great as other daniel suarez titles, but still a very solid and enjoyable book about technology.  Worth a read.
B0075PYG1M|5.0|The artist that are featured on Black Radio are perfect to accompany the music and the songs overall glide into one another and the music just relaxes you to this very calm state of being and very sexy feeling...were is the wine.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|VERY INTERESTING BOOK TO READ, ENJOYED IT A LOT, WELL WRITTEN BOOK ON THE MISSION , NOT A LOT OF DETAIL BUT UNDERSTAND WHY, YET INTERESTING
B005HSL626|5.0|This app will do nothing for your brain, but sometimes it's good to just disconnect and hack thinks up.  This game throws fruit in the air and you need to slash it with your sword (your finger).  Lots of things to swap out in this game, and it's even the free version.  Different modes of play, different backgrounds, great game.  And really?  It's free, it's not like you're out anything, but I think most people would like this.  My kids play it alot.
B001JRB16U|5.0|Great to show as a treat for students who have done well for a quarter! Music, dancing and story line are a quality that today's children don't get to see often - they are tapping their toes and singing along!
B000FCKGPC|5.0|I have just loved the entire series so far.  All of these books are soooooo good and worth reading!!!  I can't wait until I get to the next one.
B000T433CO|5.0|My daughter and I thoroughly enjoyed this movie.  Funny, heartwarming and a great story to watch on a cold night.
B009NQKPUW|5.0|well written, well directed movie! an excellent sequel to the ALIEN trilogy! cant wait for this movie sequel! go baby.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|love this game.  had to restart when I had a kindle issue otherwise it's awesome.  a major stress reliever. no complaints...
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this game and play it all the time. No need for a hot spot. You can play this baby anywhere.
B00005OMTT|5.0|I love enigma music,  to me he is one of the best music producers I seen. I highly recommend this music.
B009NQKPUW|5.0|I know this movie got mixed reviews but if you know the alien saga this movie is a must have and adds to the story
B004JZBGWI|4.0|I like this app its MUCH better than the ink pad which has the same # of stars but I like this better
B00932ANQM|5.0|It is a good movie to see with your partner or friends. It is kind a slow but with a good original theme. Wish it had some language or subtitle options.<br />I recommend the movie to audience seeking a relaxing time, and not if you want to see many action.
B008I43DYU|3.0|A good basic calculator, but lacks a conversion capability [ gallons to liters, miles to kilometers, etc] that I've come to expect in these apps.
B004GJDQT8|3.0|Really? How ridiculous is this war between Kindle and Nook? Especially when everything works better on Apple products anyway. You guys should join forces and be able to exchange products between gadgets.
0740748475|5.0|Received it in superb condition. And before the estimated delivery date. it was packed with great care. The book itself is fabulous. it was meant as a gift for my sweetheart who is so mad about CnH.. n he went absolutely crazy with joy when i gifted him with these.... :D
B007SGLZP8|4.0|This is a very entertaining and interesting story about a wrongly (no surprise there) convicted lawyer who has invaluable knowledge about the high profile murder of a federal judge and his girlfriend that can ultimately change the course of his life with a few interesting twists along the way. I don't want to give away too much except to say that it's vintage Grisham and a welcome addition to his vast catalog.<br /><br />The author has latched onto a formula that works like a charm. His writing is always engaging, smooth, up-to-the-minute, and consistantly clever.  He doesn't try to bore the reader with excessive legal mumbo jumbo - he keeps it simple.  He wants you to enjoy the ride rather than expect you to pass the Bar exam after the last chapter.<br /><br />The characers are terrific, the locations are vivid, and I've already begun casting the film.
034580404X|4.0|Boy this trilogy is something else.  It starts out REALLY racy, so if you don't want to read that kind of stuff, stay away.  The second and third are really good.  Enjoyed reading this.
B008GXHOFW|1.0|I saw that this game was on sale for black friday. I decided to buy it because it looked cool. Day One: The game needs a big download &quot;ugh&quot;. Download finally finishes. Start playing, WHOA!!! This game is AWESOME so glad i bought it. Day Two: I start the game, my game is gone. : 0. I start again, I get just as far this time. Day Three: I start the game, after the intro it goes to my fire's home page, NO! Watch entire intro, it still doesn't work! I uninstall and reinstall, STILL DOESN'T WORK!!!!!! So ultimatly DON'T BUY IT, it may work at first, but it will not work long, Unless they update it. There's one buck I'll never see again. They should have to pay for you to get it. IT SUCKS.
B000RLHDUM|4.0|This movie was a very fun to watch, though some of the scenes I thought unnecessary. All around a great spy movie to wacth without the spys.
140120841X|5.0|I got this for my thirteen year old daughter.  She was reading Fahrenheit 451 and this is the perfect companion to that book.  The graphics are haunting and the text is raw.  This book is an excellent way to open a discussion with anyone but really worked well with my teenager.
B0083SBMBM|5.0|If you like superheroes, this is your slice of pie. One of the best summer blockbusters ever to come out of Marvel Studios. But this is my opinion, it is a bit on the corny side at times.
B005DF2QMC|4.0|As some of the other reviews indicate, this machine is a bit delicate, but I used it successfully to transfer 125 of my original songs and a 45-minute poetry reading to mp3. On some occasions, I had to make a second attempt, and here a counter would have been handy. To keep wear and tear down on the machine, I used another device for rewind and fast-forward.<br /><br />The included editing software is powerful, facilitating fade-outs, noise reduction, and much more. Since the project to transfer cassette material was for me a one shot event, I have now gotten the job done for $30. I'll be using the software for transferring material from CDs to mp3 long after I have put away the device. Why pay more?
B000I5SY5U|3.0|Not a bestseller in my opinion but, It was sort of interesting to watch, though I would not be recommending it to someone I know.
B005HSG3TC|5.0|This was used for my Kindle and it worked great. It holds the unit perfectly, snugged and well protected. I would recommend.
B004U8VX2M|3.0|I didn't really care for the series. I had hoped it would be somewhat like Downton Abbey, which it was but the old time presentation I did not care for.
B00932A6G4|2.0|Ok, there are enough reviews already so you can get an idea what to expect from this flick so let me instead ask a question. How is it that a crowd of troopers, standing on level ground, with dozens and of their own men standing several layers deep directly in front of them can all fire straight ahead and not tear the men standing in front of them into bits? That's the kind of laziness this film is filled with - mediocre CGI and lazy direction lacking any kind of coherent story. You can get away with this in a video game because at least you get to spend your time just blowing stuff up, but in a movie it gets boring pretty fast. It's a shame that the Starship Troopers movies keep accelerating down hill.<br /><br />Still waiting for a film version that sticks much more closely to the book. At this rate it isn't going to be happening any time soon.
B004SJ3BCI|3.0|my two year old granddaughter likes to make the birds fly<br />to adults figuring out tergectory<br />fun for all ages
B007VUA7VO|5.0|This app works very well for my Kindle Fire HD.  It's free, fully functional and doesn't bombard you with obtrusive ads. Highly recommended.
B009HQ9UHC|4.0|i like having to build the craft.<br />it can being challenged to figure the craft and making it work<br />teens and older
0547884591|5.0|First - this book is a monster - but don't let that scare you off. It is easily read in bit-sized chunks, and is very interesting.<br /><br />When Tim announced that this book would be about cooking - I was a bit disappointed. Personally - I enjoy fine food, but don't have the time or patience for cooking anything more than utilitarian meals. When I learned more about the book - I became intrigued. While it does cover a lot about cooking, the real lessons are around Meta Learning (or learning how to learn) -- which is incredibly useful. How many times have you wished that you could learn something faster or become more effective? This book will help you do it.<br /><br />Not to mention, there are some other really fascinating topics. For instance, I come from a hunting family, but never had an interest in it when I was a kid (instead - I preferred computers, video games and reading -- and later girls). In the past few years, I've become enthralled with the outdoors and getting closer to nature. The \\"Wild\\" section hits hard, in that respect.<br /><br />BTW - I have the Kindle version, since I'm traveling abroad and don't want to lug an extra 3.75 lbs around -- however, I do plan on picking up a hard-copy of this book when I return home. Since it is setup like a reference book (much like the 4 Hour Body) - being able to pick it up, skim through it and flip to specific sections would be very helpful.
B00846REIS|5.0|It was a great book. I questioned wheter or not I would really like it but I loved it. Sylvia Day wrote this book very well, the anticipation and thrill of it was great. There is no part of the book where I was bored or questioning whether I liked it or not. I would recommend it as a milder Fifty Shades.
B004EBZX6W|5.0|Definitely one of the best and most useful apps I have ever used, works exactly as promised.<br />I frequently use to find and analyze WIFI signals wherever I go.
B008GXHOFW|1.0|Was a little glitchy one day one, completely stopped working by day two. Spent a couple hours trying to figure it out before I read all the latest reviews and saw everyone else having the same problem.
B00A6PD9I4|3.0|Standard formula animated movie. Although there really wasn't anything wrong with it , there also wasn't anything right with it either.
B002M9WW30|5.0|Arrived promptly!  My grandson requested this series for Cmas.  It will be up to him to rate how good it is!
B009CG2YDE|4.0|Nice game works great on my samsung vitality, great sound and graphics. Recommend this game for fun, a time killer. Will be back later for a better review.
B002UZ5CHO|5.0|I've always ate natural organic whole foods from my local organic co-op and would occasionally stop in regular grocery stores but after watching Food Inc I can say with 100% certainty that I will never step foot in another standard grocery store again. Consumers need to know what these big multinational companies are doing to their food.  In my personal opinion I wouldn't even call it food, but rather a concoction of chemicals & pesticides. It's no wonder this country has an excess of obese and sick people. As Natural Notes states:The push for genetically modified foods comes from boardrooms, stockholders and investment bankers- those who are about as divorced from the real scientific issues and social implications as possible.  Aldo Leopold stated back in 1948 and which is even more accurate today &#34;our bigger and better society is now like a hypochondriac, so obsessed with it's own economic health as to have lost the capacity to remain healthy.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|exciting, humorous Corey, and as always, the victor.<br />good, fast read, and a bit long.<br />highlight Mrs Corey, if you please.
B005OP7162|5.0|Best show on TV.  Took me one week to watch the entire season.  I was sad when it was done.  Purchased part of season 2.  Love it....
0688145078|3.0|The story for this book was pretty specific to a certain type of family.  Although the story was cute and well-received by my son, it didn't serve its purpose.  I purchased it to prepare him for the birth of his little brother and it was more just a story.
B003204MQS|4.0|First in the PA series of movies.<br />I am a Paranormal Activity fan, I llike all of them, although I am not sure why.
B00A0SQBDM|5.0|Almost peed my pants within the first 3 minutes! Will buy the game whether 2.99 or 4.99! I am glad to see the reviewers of the game understand the description and the content has to be purchased. KUDOS G5! And...reviewers if you love this game you must try Lost Souls: Enchanted Paintings!
B005IGVYUG|5.0|From the beautifully bittersweet &#34;Back in the Crowd&#34; to the angry messed-up funk of &#34;Hell broke Luce&#34;, this is Tom's best work since Mule Variations and very nearly eclipses it ... but not quite. MV was the album of the decade for me - perfection.
B007SGM084|5.0|This series of books need readers who are not of the faint of heart or can't handle a lot of sex!  Wow!
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I love the action and suspense in this book. Some parts of the book can be a little bit violent, but overall this is a great book!
B004GJDQT8|5.0|When I think of something, or see something I am interested in, I pop this open and check Amazon first.  If the price is right I buy it.  Doesnt get any easier.
1603429999|5.0|I've learned a great deal about knitting with circular needles from this book. As a result, i knit only with circular needles now and love it. The author gives wonderful tips, is easy to follow, and has excellent photos in her book.<br /><br />She reminds us that in patterned knitting, such as Fair Isle, if the pattern stitches are too tight and draw in the design, start over and simply change to a larger size needle when knitting the patterns. Now, I always begin with and stay with the smaller size when knitting the plain stitches and generally go up one full size for the pattern; that is, if I begin with a size two, which is great for my fine Shetland yarns, I simply change to a size three when knitting the patterns and return to the size two for the plain knit stitches. In other words, the smaller size makes a tighter fabric, and the larger size makes a looser fabric which accommodates the strands across the inside back of the item. I hope I am not confusing anyone who reads this.<br /><br />So far, my favorite pattern in this book is the \\"reversible seamless scarf,\\" knit on circular needles, with an added fringe at each end to join the tube layers together. By \\"reversible,\\" the author means that no matter which of the two sides of the \\"tube\\" you have facing outward, either side is the right side. Though I live in very warm south Georgia, I have family living up north and out west, and I knit them warm scarves as holiday gifts.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|My seven year old nephew got me<br />hooked on this!! I can not seem to put it down. I highly recommend!
B000SXOFL4|5.0|Several months ago I discovered ENIGMA. I purchased MXMXC, then le Roi est Mort, then Journey. GREAT albums all. This album is another great addition to my motorcycle MP3 collection. Really makes for the best ride.<br />Thanks
B008Y2FRFO|3.0|I like the gameplay...just doesn't last long when you let a child play.  It should not cost money for more coins...maybe you should just have to turn it off and on again would be better for using with children.
B0059XTUB8|3.0|Marilyn Monroe captured the public eye until her death from a drug overdose when she was 36 in 1962. Five years before her death, she played an American showgirl opposite Laurence Olivier in the British movie The Prince and the Showgirl. The movie wasn't a big hit. During the production of the movie Marilyn developed a friendship with one of the assistant directors, Colin Clark, following the departure of her husband (then), Arthur Miller. This movie is based on Clark's much later biography which detailed his liaison with Marilyn. The depth of Clark's intimacy with Marilyn as portrayed in his book has been questioned.<br /><br />The movie is entertaining but slow moving. Michelle Williams is the star, as Marilyn would have been. She portrays a broody, moody, petulant and spoiled star with a hint of naivet&eacute;. In general, my reaction was, what's all the fuss? The sultry, sexy, melt your heart Marilyn was hard to find.<br />Kenneth Branagh is fun to watch as Laurence Olivier and Eddie Redmayne is a cute, likeable Colin Clark.
B009VSW15Y|5.0|I love my FIRE. I was visiting my grandkids and Lilly wanted to take pictures with it. We downloaded this app and she had fun taking pictures.
B008N1V11U|5.0|This app is AMAZING. The story is awesome, your progression through the story is awesome, and it has great replay value. The game gets appropriately harder as you progress, but not too hard. And once you're finished, you have a few options. You can free-roam, train in the batcave, or replay levels. Overall amazing game.
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|No problems with purchase. Good alternative to spending a lot of money on Netflix or at the mmocies. Will purchase here again.
B008S6B41C|5.0|Just a beautiful presentation, a perfect addition to my Deep Purple collection and recommended to all Purple Fans! Listening to the album in 5.1 was illuminating! Highly recommended!

B000AYEL6U|5.0|This 2004 BBC adaptation of Elizabeth Gaskell's &#34;North and South&#34; now ranks as one of my all-time favorite period dramas, up there with 1995's [[ASIN:B00364K6YW Pride and Prejudice (Restored Edition)]] and [[ASIN:B002XTBECY Cranford: The Collection (Cranford / Return to Cranford)]], among others. Interesting to note that all three BBC adaptations of Gaskell's works, i.e. [[ASIN:B000GIXLUC Wives and Daughters]], as well as &#34;Cranford&#34; and &#34;North and South&#34; are all stellar productions. Being a great fan of British period dramas, I am surprised it took me this long to discover &#34;North and South&#34;.<br /><br />The story of &#34;North and South&#34; is both a love story as well as a story of class and industrialization. Margaret Hale (portrayed by the beautiful Daniela Denby-Ashe) is the lovely daughter of a clergyman, Richard (Tim Piggot-Smith) and his wife, Maria (Lesley Manville who also played Mrs. Rose in &#34;Cranford&#34;). When her father breaks with the church over an issue of conscience, Margaret is forced to uproot from the idyllic southern town of Halston in Hampshire and move to the industrial town of Milton in Northern England. There the Hale family try to adjust - father Richard finds a job as a tutor and teacher, but mother Maria and Margaret find it more difficult to come to terms with the customs of the Northerners who seem a much coarser lot than the genteel Southerners. Plain speaking and independent-minded Margaret chafes at the strictures placed upon her sex and also comes to learn about the inequalities between the working classes and the mill owners.<br /><br />This sets the stage for the clash between John Thornton (Richard Armitage in a magnificent performance), owner of a cotton mill and Margaret, whose first impression of Thornton is of a cruel and insensitive man who treats his employees abysmally. Sparks soon fly between the two though it is Thornton who feels the initial strong attraction to Margaret. Margaret is too overcome by her first impressions to really feel much for Thornton, and her developing friendship with a young mill worker and her father, Nicholas (played by pre-Downton Abbey's Brendan Coyle) further fractures the fragile relationship between Thornton and Margaret (Thornton becomes Richard's pupil, studying the classics and the two men form an affectionate friendship, despite Margaret's animosity towards Thornton). When Nicholas becomes a union leader, calling for a strike at all the cotton mills to fight for a raise and better working conditions, Thornton and Margaret clash even more.<br /><br />Richard Armitage's performance as the brooding, proud cotton mill owner John Thornton reminded me of both Mr. Darcy of [[ASIN:1612930425 Pride and Prejudice]] and Mr. Edward Rochester of [[ASIN:0451526554 Jane Eyre (Signet Classics)]]. Armitage delivers a credible and magnetic performance and the natural chemistry between Armitage and Daniela Denby-Ashe makes for riveting viewing! I could not take my eyes off the screen, especially when these two were engaged in heated conversation.<br /><br />There's so many layers to this wonderfully-written production. There's romance, family tensions, class and gender issues, and many more. All of these are masterfully weaved into a production that not only looks beautiful (with a haunting score to boot) but also flows seamlessly. I watched all four episodes (Prime members get free streaming) in one sitting and plan to re-watch it again. There's much to savor here, and the love/hate relationship between Thornton and Margaret Hale anchors the story, making for a compelling and engaging viewing experience. This is truly a wonderful production and I am purchasing the DVD to add to my period drama collection.first impressions to really feel much for Thornton, and her developing friendship with a young mill worker and her father, Nicholas (played by pre-Downton Abbey's Brendan Coyle) further fractures the fragile relationship between Thornton and Margaret (Thornton becomes Richard's pupil, studying the classics and the two men form an affectionate friendship, despite Margaret's animosity towards Thornton).

B00A6PD9I4|4.0|Our audience consisted of everyone from adults and college students (home on a break,) to our youngest who is almost four. Everyone had a terrific time with the movie except the little one,  who only watched now and then before moving on to make mischief elsewhere. The visual style is both charming and dramatic, while the voices and characters are perfect in setting the story. Brave is a keeper!
B001UV4XFQ|5.0|having two guys in love with you at the same time,i wouldnt know how that feels,but i cant lie i do wonder,but anyway love the movie and recommend it highly
B0091QS88K|5.0|I have downloaded all the Dr. Panda' s game. They are well designed. Kids can learn a lot from the game if you play with him. My son love it.
B009CG2YDE|4.0|A little bit of everything from the old retro &quot;space&quot; games makes this a fun game.  I Will spend many hours playing this I'm sure.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Love this game. No issues with it and the ads are minimal and at the bottom of the screen out of the way.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love this game it gettes new games quickly extra word extra word extra word extra word extra word extra word extra word
B005BRS8Z6|5.0|If every person could live life according to the four agreements this would be a very different world!  No longer would politicians make false promises.  People would not take things, that don't even concern them, personally.  We wouldn't make assumptions thus not being judgemental.  And if everyone did their best what more could we ask?!!
B003FC1752|4.0|I think they did a great job remaking this movie and that because of the new CG's used in the film it was much more realistic than the original.  It's definitely a movie that I'll watch again!!
B009A3NGF4|4.0|Fans of their last album will definitely love this... If you've<br />had the chance to see them live there music and eapecially<br />this album in particular come to life... Call it bluegrass, idie<br />rock or southern folk it ellivates into raspy harmonies and<br />ellegant acoustics with a little something for everyone.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|I only wish that the Avengers Assemble collection, in a collectable case, would come out in time for Christmas. My son loves the Avengers. And I bought him this copy when it first came out. I bought the same exact set when it first came out. When my son was here for Turkey day, He's flying back now, he wanted too borrow &#34;The Avengers&#34; too watch on the way back. He forgot too bring it with him.  I told him too go ahead and take it, I still have the Blu-ray and the 3-D disc.
B009CG2YDE|4.0|Galaxy S 3. Plays really well, smooth. Fun retro styled game with tilt controls. Challenging enough to keep you playing. Grab this one up!
B008O9V24W|5.0|The Vaccines have the best new songs! I recommend it for anybody who's heard them before and wants to hear Justin use different tones of his voice.
B00846REIS|3.0|I think I'm just not that into romance novels. This was recommended to me after I read the fifty shades series and decided that that authors writing style was pretty bad.<br /><br />This author is better. No mention of an &#34;inner goddess.&#34; Should not because series though. I think this story could be complete in one book.
B008458O3S|5.0|My initial impression when I first started playing was that this was just easy silliness. But now I'm HOOKED!  I love it! It keeps getting tougher and I welcome the challenge. I can play for a couple spare minutes, or blow an hour.
B00932ANQM|5.0|I like this movie very much, such a great story.  As a Vietnam veteran I can relate emotionally to his emotions, and such a pretty girl of course he fell in love with her
B008WCP2PG|5.0|I was a little taken aback by some of the people making comments on this movie. Yes, is has very little story line (duh!). But it is without a doubt some of the best dancing ever!!! It was fun, Channing Tatum is a doll, McConaughey looked a little \\"used\\"; but it was great! It has absolutely no redeeming qualities, what do you expect? Take it for what is. Fun!
B005COO1X6|5.0|I enjoyed the story. It was short and sweet. Sad that the little kids won't have their parents back. It's a King classic
B0058VW36U|5.0|LOVE IT LOVE IT LOVE LOVE LOVE IT really fun and om nom is so cute!! i really like all the diffrant seasons and boxes and how they are all so difrant!! awesome game and so worth the money!
B000N6TYLW|5.0|So glad I purchased this.  I would recommend this to any mother with daughter!  Start from the beginning, it is worth the watch.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|its a really fun game and a good way to relax your mind. im currently stuck on a level and i find that i keep getting stuck on levels which frustrates me somwhat. but overall. its really great!
B008Y7IFSA|3.0|I have loved this movie for years and was disappointed that the online version I purchased is missing one of the songs in the DVD.
B0050KEVO6|4.0|Looking for a great, practical, and fun game? this is your game then. its really fun and I spent hours just combining. though yes, it does get a little frustrating after a while with so many combos. I gave it 4 stars because I dont like the fact that in order to complete the game, you have to make things like alchol drinks and other things like that. yeah...not a huge fan of that but Everything else is great!
B001AFF25W|5.0|Excellent quick read! Sharing with my kids and co-workers! Love the simple two application points at the end of each chapter!
B0086700CM|5.0|I think that this is a really fun game and I like the fact that you can get power ups! really great game!!!
B0063IH60K|5.0|It's an enjoyable game that is hassle free and has great graphics and structure.  Love the silly dancing<br />cards when you win.  The ads before each new deal are a small trade off.
B002Q4TKAY|5.0|It is a Religious experiance! They are one of those groups that are so much better live than in the studio.
B0091REZMW|4.0|it was nice to play and find the hidden objects in the dark I don't really understand them tell you what to look for and you don't find it in the room tho.
B0070Y46UY|4.0|Thoroughly enjoyed The Life of Pi, from the beginning in India to the incredible life at sea with Richard Parker.
B00846REIS|5.0|I read this book in just 2 evenings.  I have already recommended this to friends and would read it again!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I absolutely lived the trilogy and I read this book in a day. They were all so beautifully written, and I was at the edge of my seat.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I read this book in just 3 evenings.  I have already recommended this to friends and would read it again!
B0091REZMW|5.0|Love it! I like this kind of game and the plot is really cool. It being free is just an added bonus. This game is very addictive.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I read this book in just 4 evenings.  I have already recommended this to friends and would read it again!
B008YRVW0I|5.0|Works great on Kindle Fire! Addicting...fun....cant stop playing it. I find it relaxing and enjoyable to play. A must have.
B0000YB7Z8|5.0|I'm so happy that I purchased this 2 disc version of \\"Bursting Out\\". The single disc version that was around for so long was missing a few tracks in order to squeeze this all onto one CD. It's an amazing document of Jethro Tull's 1977 European Tour. It is one of the best live albums from the 1970's. I would have loved to have seen this line-up of Tull perform live. Everyone in the band is performing at their best. This album has a few \\"hits\\", like \\"Aqualung\\" (with a Martin Barre guitar solo that rivals the original studio recording), \\"Locomotive Breath\\", \\"Thick As A Brick\\" (nearly 12 minutes long) and \\"Cross-Eyed Mary\\". There are also a few songs from their then newest albums \\"Songs From The Wood\\" and \\"Heavy Horses\\". The sound of this CD (and the other Tull remasters from this period)is clear, crispy & clean. The only disapointment I had with this 2 CD version of \\"Bursting Out\\" is minor. On the original vinyl, Ian's spoken introductions to some of the songs had sections BLEEPED OUT. The one CD version had the same treatment. I was hoping at least I could get to hear what Ian said without the BLEEPS.
B00A13719E|5.0|She finally came back with a wonderful music production . God bless her and hope she keeps making great music.
B0087HT36U|5.0|Great graphics and game play. Play it all the time.  Definitely pick it up if it shows up as the daily free app.
B0070NSPCU|5.0|The story/plot moves forward swiftly and well.  All the characters are emotionally engaging.  I really enjoyed this book and was saddened to find out that there are no others to follow at this point.
B007FTZDN8|5.0|What can I say.  It's TED.  I've always longed to attend a TED conference in person.  No such luck.  Now I have TED lectures in a mobile format.  I absolutely love it.  I would give this ten stars if I could.
B001I189MQ|5.0|I think this is one of the greatest movies ever made. The Joker is a real trip. Watch and enjoy.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love Pinterest! I have gotten so many home decor ideas, recipes, etc. from this app. I probably stay on this more than Facebook now.
0743277708|5.0|I decided to read this book after listening epic band Fall of Efrafa. It changed my life i think. Highly recommended!
B0016OLC5Q|5.0|somehow managed to fizzle into a sleeper hit, but such a great movie. Hal Holbrook has a brief but painfully beautiful performance that is worth the two hours all by itself. must see.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|I loved this book. The detail is amazing. I would reccommend it to anyone in the military or out. The only thing I wish is there were some of the pictures he took after the raid.
B008XBCJ34|5.0|It was the best 3D movie I've seen at home.... by far I would recommend to anyone it is the best
1419802356|5.0|A must see. it helps you see humor in tragedy and tragedy in humor... needless to say, the transition was effortless and delightfully unexpected.
B0059XTUVI|4.0|I wasn't sure I was going to like this movie after reading some reviews mostly of people who said that it was kind of insulting to Margaret Thatcher to show her in her later years.  Those of us who remember her as Prime Minister and even lived in Great Britain at that time and watched her on TV saw a different person.  Still I think the movie was done well and Meryl Streep really captured the character with hair, makeup, mannerisms, and voice.  I liked Jim Broadbent in the role of the older Dennis Thatcher.  She truly will be an unforgettable leader who really stood for conservative values and wouldn't back down under the most political pressures.
B000VWYNOG|5.0|The item arrived on time in excellent condition.  I love every title on this ledgendary album but for me the one song that grabs my soul is the gorgeous, melodic, Someone Like You.
B009HV2JT8|4.0|I thought it was very interesting, Henry is hot and he's a vampire. I would deff. recommend watching. I would be cool if this was real
B0039UTDFG|5.0|Although it is narrated by Oprah, this is quite a steal if you purchase it from Best Buy.  Not only is it much less expensive, it comes bundled with Frozen Planet series! I bought mine for $16.99 yesterday.  I couldn't believe the price.  I believe it regularly goes for 19.99 there.  It is a Best Buy exclusive and it surely packs a lot for the price. $16.99!!!!
B00785P2QC|3.0|This a very fun game other than the developers wanting to drain the players to abvance! I recomend this game (if you got some moldy cash laying around
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Totally addictive show. I love that it's a wholesome show without the cursing and explicit sexuality.<br />Terrific acting with great characters that make you care for them or dislike them.
B000OXHRRC|5.0|Very good movie, romantic, funny I defenitely recomended to all my friends and family. Watched two times and now decided to buy my own.
B00A6PD8RQ|3.0|The movie was good, but a bit dark for my four year old. At times she laughed, and she definitely enjoyed it. However, nightmares followed about the witch.
B009UVWBMA|5.0|I have to first start off by admitting that this is the first Taylor Swift album that I have ever listened to, so prior to pushing the play button on my CD player I didn't know what to expect although I had the memory of her being a Country Singer and later being embarrassed by Kenye West in some musical awards show some years ago. The album opens up just as strong as any Madonna, Mariah Carey, Gloria Estefan, or any Diva past present and future's album would start off. The difference is that this album is like a great cup of coffee - Good to the last note! I really couldn't find a song that would be classified as filler. What I did discover is that Taylor Swift's albums are truly a psychological process of a heartbroken, or at least a hurt, young lady who needs to invest her money on a psychiatrist because she is sick of having her heart just smashed by all these guys that are either no good for her or she just blew her chance of being with.
B0076DCT2G|3.0|I have enjoyed reading every book written by Nelson DeMille.  The Panther is no exception but on  a scale of 1 - 10, where all his previous books rate a 15, I rate The Panther a 6.  The book was good but not great like the others.  At times it felt like I was driving a 1963 VW bug across the desert - never really sure I would make it to the end.
B009B4ZEKM|3.0|So I pushed play on my iPod and felt as if I was entering an adventure of at least a biological tour of how people transfer from childhood to sex symbol. I say that because what called my attention above-and-beyond the music, which I'll talk about in a bit, was the pictures that come with the CD. Christina if you want to expose your body so badly please girlfriend, take other means. The music is one that sounds as if time was taken to assure that the beat / rhythm matches the lyrics which I appreciate that. I don't approve of albums that sound as if the music and lyrics were just thrown together from the cutting room floor of the studio. Although at times the songs are somewhat busy with the bass and drum machine. Make The World Move would have sounded just as good or even better if CeeLo Green would have stayed home instead of at the recording studio. The album shows an angst of sorts that places her as a woman that finds herself alone but comfortable to be alone - I was waiting for Helen Reddy to drop into a song with a personal message of I Am Woman, Nancy Sinatra, or Gloria Gaynor with I Will Survive. Then there are the songs where she sounds as if she wants to be and sound like Rihanna. Christina Aguilera needs to find her Niche and remain content writing and singing with that format, there is no doubt that she can sing but she doesn't need to sound as if she is orphaned by a culture. Does she eat and kiss with that mouth of hers?
B00A3DZ61W|5.0|Really enjoying playing it as are my grandsons challanging me when they come out to visit with me in the evening.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Catching Fire is a logical follow up to the hunger games. Anyone that has read the Hunger Games must read this book
B002ZG97LK|3.0|This is not a \\"bad\\" movie, but then again neither was the '84 version. Although some parts are updated, the movie is almost identical to the original Kevin Bacon movie. Even most of the dialogue is virtually identical, right down to the VW beetle used by Kevin... is it the same one?<br /><br />This has been one of the disturbing trends to movies/shows being \\"remakes\\" of the originals... hard to improve a good movie / story line in the first place. Not really sure why they bothered. Replaced a cassette tape player with an iPod, the tractor \\"chicken\\" scene with a bus race, but pretty much the same movie.<br /><br />Other than some \\"modernization\\" it's the same movie... good, but doesn't warrant more than 3 stars, the original deserves 5, watch both of them, you can hardly tell them apart... Can't give more stars for a \\"copy\\" of a good movie. Sorry.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|The Mockingjay is a good conclusion to the series and held me captivated to the end. Anyone that has read the Hunger Games and Catching fire must read this book
B008YU0AOE|4.0|Really great application.  Great for quick calculations on the go. Specially useful when shopping for figuring out those percetil discounts.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The Hunger Games is an unusual book that generated a mixture of emotions while reading. It is one of those books you cannot put down
B0012QRPU4|5.0|Never wanted to see this show, as it was about drugs and things I no longer had any interest in, but near the end of season 5, eventually got the first season DVD, and was completely hooked.  The characterization and the storylines are awesome in an utterly realistic way, and the characters are as well.  Well worth your time...
B00A0NOF7G|5.0|This book was awesome!!!!! I loved it!!! It kept me on the edge of my seat the whole time!! I would definitely recommend it for somebody who enjoys a good mystery!!!
B001JQD0Z6|4.0|Read this book in the original language years ago wiyh the greatest pleasure. I am sure the noe it was given to will enjoy it.
B007THA4FI|3.0|Okay, it's her first departure from the Potter series. I hope she keeps writing. This was good enough for the Kindle price but borrow it rather than buy it if you can.
B0084HJE0S|4.0|from everything that i have read, i like the book. i own 30 or so similar, but i need to have hard copy to get the big picture and really easy navigation. i want this also on my android, but don't want to pay for both. anybody know about discount?
B0029XFN8A|1.0|You would be far better off watching \\"Risky Business\\" (1983) than spending your time watching \\"The Girl Next Door\\".  Many plot happenings were ripped off from \\"Risky Business\\"  (which is a far superior film on every level compared to this one) and show up here, and they even used one of the same songs from the \\"Risky Business\\" soundtrack (\\"Mannish Boy\\" by Muddy Waters) at a key moment of the film.  Ridiculous.
B0053O89Z6|5.0|Love every episode of the first 6 seasons and 7th season was no let down! Kept me laughing and guessing with each new episode!! Great buy!
B00A7ZXDLQ|5.0|This album rubbed me the wrong way at first. I felt it was holding up as strongly as some of her past works but I really grew to love it after listening. Great Music
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I find myself playing several times a day. Very fun. The hardest part is waiting for more coins. My husband is addicted to the game as well.
B0096NCVAE|1.0|I ordered this for a friend's son who is into Legos. When it came, I was shocked at how small and chintzy the items were. I paid $20 for something that looked like it came from a happy meal. To make matters worse, I paid for rush shipping to get it here on time. It was for a birthday, so there was no time to exchange it. Legos should be embarrassed to put their name on something like this.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|I love this game!!! it is so fun. if you have a device that will let you play this game then you are smart enough to know not to buy the gems.
B0058W74UY|1.0|The flash player would not allow me to read a magazine I have on the ZINIO web site.  My Kindle Fire kept telling me I needed the Adobe Flash Player 10, and the Amazon App store search panel drected me to a list of about 10 non-adobe flash players. None of them idicated they were substitutes for Adobe 10.  I had a chat session with a representative at Kindle help line, and was told Adobe flash 10 capability is not available for the Silk browser at this time.  If so, why does the app store home page direct me to a list of flash players that will not work in place of Adobe 10?<br />If there is only one on the list that will wrk like the Adobe 10, please tell me which one it is!
B007N0AEWY|4.0|I became curious about Nick Waterhouse's music from an Acura TV commercial.  I have enjoyed the entire album.  &#34;If you want trouble&#34; is my new personal theme song.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Very fun and addicting app.  I had this game on my phone and was pleased to see that it is available for the kindle fire :-) I'd give this awesome game more stars if I could!&hearts; &#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;
B001RJTFP4|5.0|This is the not 'Twilight' vampire movie.  This is the best of the Blade series.  Stephen Dorff was a great villain. Kris Kristofferson played a great part, and I like watching him kick butt also. Finally, Wesley Snipes was the smoothest Superhero with becoming a sandwich!
B0044CBMVG|5.0|I started watching this series late so have been playing catch up. There is always more that one story line to follow that I don't lose interest. If you like funny crime drama with a kick this is for you! I hope you enjoy it as much as I have.
B009SQRL4U|4.0|A very good &#34;spirit of Christmas&#34; movie. It took a while to get into it, but my kids and I liked it.
0071422943|5.0|I used this reference throughout college and in the professional world. Recently, I used the Perry's for a few problems on the Professional Engineering Exam...Highly recommend this reference be added to your collection. You can't beat the amazon price either!
B0076DCT2G|5.0|Settling in with The Panther was like catching up with an old friend...provided your old friends are wise-ass, smart mouthed NY'ers...most of mine are!
B000000OQF|5.0|Best album! Listen over and over straight through and never be disappointed! True Rock and Roll! Love it till I die.
B006YXTRHY|1.0|I wanted to love this as much as the books, but the movies seem to get worse as they go on in the series.  So slow, so quiet and dull, just really hard to sit through.  Not what I was hoping for at all.
034580404X|4.0|I chose the rating I did because I got the books at a fast pace and they were money well spent.
B0063IH60K|5.0|very easy to use my 75 year old mother loves it as well nephew also uses it he is 9 years old
B0090P98Z4|4.0|very cool foe. the price. I would tell my friends to try it. controls are easy to use and graphics are decent.
B008ZOHCKE|2.0|Program okay and great to use, User friendly.  Program is not compatably for linking to pc,  amazone is no help with issue more company who made the program. Good for on go home,  just a lot of cutting and pasting in email to have notes on computer.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|This is an extremely fun game, where you build a park for dragons.  Those of you who like dragon story will love this game, similar concept, but so much better.  I had this game on my ipod touch before it was drowned in the pocket of my swimtrunks.  I got this app once i saw that it was available and it is just as good if not better on the Kindle Fire HD
B005OCFHHK|2.0|I'm so glad I read the reviews before I bought this set.  I have been waiting to get this on blu ray until I had a blu ray player.  As I was researching and reading reviews I saw that many people recommended getting this on the Amazon UK site.  Boy, were they right.  I got this exact set, plus 3 bonus extra footage dvd's for $35.67 USD including the shipping cost.  I can't believe the U.S. Amazon site it charging so much for it.  The shipping was only $5.00 to sent it to the states from the UK.  There are a good deal of blu ray sets on the UK site there are at least half price from what the U.S. site is charging.
B009VSW15Y|2.0|First of all, this app should already be on the KF HD or at least be free, as stated in other reviews.  Another thing is that the app crashes when you try to take a video (all thanks to the new update), which is kinda pathetic.  At other times, I might be playing a game or something and this app will randomly open, which is incredibly anoying and somewhat serious.  The panorama option will work, but you can not save or even view the picture after taken.  Photos can be taken, saved, and viewed with no problems.  Amazon Spamazon.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|By far the best version that was offered would have been nice if there was more behind the scenes stuff other than that  a must buy.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|Good read.  Interesting twists just when you think its predictable. Good characterization. Read in one day.  Would read more of Landay's books.
B001UV4XFG|5.0|The first 2 movies in the series build up to this one.  In the first Bella falls in love with Edward and there begins a feud with Victoria after Edward kills her mate, James to save Bella's life.  In the second she begins to love Jacob after Edward leaves her.  Bella finds out that werewolves exist and that Jacob is one of them.  But she still chooses Edward and the beginnings of a feud with the Volturi start.  It is in this film where the feud with Victoria reaches its apex and the feud with the Volturi goes to the next step.  Bella is very indecisive about who she loves more Edward or Jacob.  Victoria creates an army and with the help of the werewolves they defeat Victoria's army.  Bella finally makes a final choice between Edward and Jacob.  Of course she chooses Edward but reveals that she is not just choosing him but his world.  Despite all the bad things that come with it Bella lets Edward know that is where she knows that she belongs.  This is the most interesting of the movies because it combines both the love story and the feuds that the characters become engaged in.  This film is part of the climax of the whole series.  The other part of the climax, the one involving the Volturi, only reaches its apex in part 2 of Breaking Dawn.
B0063GORYU|5.0|This is my favorite form of Spider.  I play it every night while I watch TV.  I love the format and find it to be a nice challenge.
B000B5XOSO|5.0|I love this sequel.  It is one of the few sequels that measures up to the first.  Batman is still a very conflicted guy.  Then Selena Kyle is a mild wimpy secretary who knows a little self-defense.  After she gets pushed out of a window, saved by some cats she becomes changed and the secret part of her that was hidden away comes out to play.  The Penguin is a slightly sympathetic but in general evil and sadistic.  I love Michelle Pfeiffer's portrayal of Catwoman.  She is both a good guy and a bad guy and not very manipulative.  I love because she is a complete b**ch, but in a good way.  No one pushes her around and those that do she gets even with.  Although she and Batman do start a relationship she can't deny who she truly is and she would rather be that than be with him.  The Penguin gets his comeuppance.  Selena gets even with Max who pushed her out of the window. Batman aka Bruce knows at the end that she is still roaming the streets and he can count her to be an ally as long as he doesn't get in her way!
B006LSZECO|1.0|I tend to pick the books that I read based on customer reviews since they're usually the most honest. This was not the case with this title. I read it based on it's status in the best seller section on amazon but this may be the worst ending to a book that I have ever encountered. She just stopped writting. Horrible. Not even good enough in the meat of it to make up for that kind of ending.
B000AYELVA|5.0|This movie draws you in by giving you the history and a plausible and believable scenario.  I love this film and it is one of my favorites based on a comic book.  The plot is great.  The characters are interesting.  The special effects are great but not too cartoonish.  The villians are also great!  All in all this is the best of the X-Men films!
B007HO392S|5.0|Carrie displays her versitle voice as usual...The song selections are great. Carrie has come a long way, from an unknown to a mega star!!!
B001FB4W0W|5.0|This first part of the series is very good.<br />Sookie Stackhouse is a telepathic waitress who has no idea who she is, what she is, or what she capable of.  Sookie meets Bill, a vampire but a good guy as far as vampires go.  They are immediately attracted to one another.  As the series continues it is obvious that there is a serial killer that is targeting women who have had sex with vampires.  Although Sookie gets a taste of the bad side of vampires and the supernatural she is still drawn to it.<br />Sookie starts investigating the murders of 2 women who she knew and meets Eric, an old vampire, who extremely attractive, and is also drawn to Sookie, especially after he finds out about her gift.<br />Sookie's brother, Jason, is a horny hunkie guy who is only concerned with having sex and after he gets a taste of doing vampire blood, is concerned with that.  After her grandmother is murdered, Sookie realy gets together with Bill.<br />Sookie helps Eric and Bill kills another vampire in order to save her.  He goes off for a while and as punishment is forced to turn, Jessica, a young runaway, into a vampire.  Bill asks Sam to look after Sookie.  Sookie finds out that her boss, Sam is a shapeshifter.<br />Sookie seriously starts investigating the murders.  Rene, the murderer, comes after Sookie and Sam realizing that it is him goes after Rene.  Bill wakes up and goes out into the daylight to try ot save Sookie.  She gets knocked out.  Sookie's connection with Bill wakes her up in time to save herself and kill Rene in self-defense.<br />This is the first season of a pretty good series.  Sookie slowly but steadily becomes a part of the supernatural world where she belongs.  This series is also based on some murder mystery books which I have no interest in.  There are very few amusing parts. This is more of a sexy drama.  I would recommend this series to anyone who likes dark sexy dramas.
B007MJ9LA2|5.0|As usual, great guitar work by Santana & band. The album is mostly instrumental, and the musicians that surround Santana are great..
B0063IH60K|5.0|I play this game all the time. Frustrating but a lot of fun! Just can't seem to put it down.
B008UUPOVM|5.0|Love pretty much all the songs on here.  Some lyrics are cheesy but it is jammin' overall.  And $4 is a steal.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Gives you better perspective of the wars that are currently going on and why we need to support our troops.
0060537639|5.0|Not sure if I believe all this or not but the book was great. You feel like you are on the Chinese voyages of discovery with the mega fleet. This book is well written and presents some intriguing evidence for these discoveries.I don't have the time nor the means to verify all this for myself but he authors hypothesis definitely makes for some interesting reading. I enjoyed every minute!

B004UID2LC|5.0|Wonderful app, get to listen to youtube, get to download youtube vids and play them when your not online. What else can I say great.
B0058A11AK|5.0|I once read somewhere that Barbara Streisand could sing the phone book and make it not only beautiful, but interesting.  Every song she sings is like a one act play and she runs the gamut of emotions.  Her rendition of Windmills gives me goose bumps.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This is by far my favorite Bible App for simply reading the Bible on my phone or tablet.  Some translations even have audio files that will read the scripture aloud.  That is a great option to access before you start to drive somewhere.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I beilieve this is the best app for a mobile device alone its amazing but with other apps to help it its even better I do wish there were nods for it though.
B004SBULWE|5.0|i really like this app it helps you control what is running on your tablet so you do not run you battery down so fast
B0063GORYU|5.0|My son introduced me to this game.  I am not a big gamer, I prefer to read, but this game is extremely addicting.  It will be staying on my kindle for a long time.
B0063IH60K|3.0|It's not as user freindly as other solitare games that came with my computers. It plays alright I guess it's what you get used to.
B006YXTRHY|5.0|Wonderful movie! It is a lot better than the previous films! You will enjoy it if you enjoy the series!
B005LAJ16I|5.0|I don't watch much tv. The few shows I do watch I like, but I haven't been obsessed with a show since The X-Files went off the air. That all changed when Homeland hit the airwaves.<br /><br />Homeland grabs and keeps your attention. It's slowest (slow by Homeland definition is not really slow) episodes are better than anything else on television. It's smart and complex. The acting is outstanding, Oscar worthy, led by Claire Danes, Damian Lewis, Mandy Patinkin, and the young Morgan Saylor. The fantastic chemistry between Lewis and Danes is intense.<br /><br />Don't miss this show!
B00005JN8Z|5.0|This movie would be popular in any age and any era. It will be popular well into the future. I thoroughly recommend it!!
B007L3BMGA|2.0|Besides few nice descriptions of the raising desire of the main character and her discovery of her own sexuality, nothing remarkable.
B006LSZECO|5.0|So many twists. I didn't see things coming. I definitely recommend it! I found myself really liking the characters too. I always wanted to know what was going to happen next!
B0098VXBIA|1.0|i expected more humor. it was stupid, shallow and quite frankly, boring. Heard good things about it from others but was disappointed.
B009KHDT0C|4.0|All around fun movie to watch.  For those of us who remember the original TV series it brings back memories.  For those in their teens who enjoy the current TV shows about Vampires, this is worth watching.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|it a level up game and build it game. it also so much fun you should get it and it is many age group can play.
B0074D3CAQ|4.0|the author kept you into the story, as unlikely as it sounds(i.e. a 500 mile walk). Any one who has spent time walking soon learns it shakes the cobwebs out of your mind. The author works this wonderfully while not revealing the overriding problems and events that have brought him to this point in his life.
B009KHDT0C|4.0|Johnny Depp is a perfect Barnabas Collins.  Very entertaining with nice throwbacks to the original series.  This movie continues the tongue-in-cheek melodrama that was always present in the series: The talk Barnabas has to learn updated \\"courting\\", the gravity-defying love scene, the party with Alice Cooper.  This movie won't win awards but is a great way to spend an evening and I definitely got more out of it the second time through.  CGI beasties a little off but otherwise great banter and cast chemistry.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I am glad that I read the whole series.  I was a little shocked as I read the first book, but I felt like the second and third books did a good job of tying up the series (no pun intended...LoL)
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|What can I say? This is to date the best movie rendition of the comic book world ever! Growing up my fav hero was always a toss-up between Thor, Captain America, and Ironman, after seeing this it might come down to Hulk, LoL. Buy it, its fun based on a clean art, comic books.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I enjoyed this book more than the first one.  It moved beyond the graphic sexual encounters (they are still there) and developed a nice storyline.
B008VSKPJO|4.0|Pretty cool album, This chick mixes a punk rock sound with a sort of club-big band era sound, turns out to be worth the money and she has a great voice. If you are into puink or rock you will definitely enjoy this album! I would highly recommend it, especially if you have a girlfriend, wife, sister etc, you cant go wrong here she'll love it !
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Much more intense than I expected!  I read a lot of young adult fiction...I'm a married woman...but I was a little shocked when I read this first book.  I enjoyed the series as a whole...just shocking, some things people just don't talk about...Anyway, it's funny because everyone seems a little shy admitting that they have read it and then once you get to talking you realize that pretty much everyone enjoyed it.  :)
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Love this series for both the characters and the whole zombie scenario.  The acting is excellent with good plots and just the right amount of action. I have been hooked since season one. :)  Love being able to download the episodes since I work every other weekend.
B0084I9QIW|5.0|This is an amazing DVD you can see why Michael Jackson is considered ONE of the greatest and the LAST showman of the 20th century. May god bless him always

B00992CF6W|5.0|hi people reading this if you get this game its so awesome you can make any thing please get this its so awesome!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B0042VJ1PI|3.0|Nothing great nothing bad, you can definitely see hints of the show seeping through and it's an amusing light read for any Castle fans out there, not as good as the first one in terms of the flow and structure of the novel but definitely a more interesting case.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|its a time killer gets addicting after a while. also a lot of fun for my 4 year old. def recommend
1608871517|5.0|I really enjoyed this book from cover to cover! High quality, beautiful photos and some never heard stories! Thank You Mr.Bush for this wonderful insight and thank You for sticking to MJ for all these years! I don't want to reveal any of the stories in this book because I think that any fan would like to read them by himself/herself.<br />But there is ONE thing missing, especially for female fans, and that is GOLD PANTS and story behind them! I believe many, many girls would LOVE to see and hear about them! Maybe in 2nd edition?! :-)<br />I wish all the best in life to Mr.Bush and to all MJfans around the world.
B005S9EJ46|5.0|This is one of the most delightful movies I have seen in a very long time.  It takes us to places we might not have experienced otherwise,  both personally and geographically.<br /><br />It presents the American viewer with an option of adventures most would never contemplate. It gives those of us getting a bit &quot;long in the tooth&quot; something to think about.
B008GXHOFW|2.0|I got the game yesterday and played it for about an hour and LOVED IT. It was awesome! Now, I keep trying to play it again, but it is too good to be true. It won't open after getting past the intro video, and just shuts itself down. I even deleted it and downloaded it again, and it is still doing that. SO ANNOYING.
B00174TKGI|5.0|Surprised and moving movie.  I really like that it was a true story.  Makes me think about things in the world and that there are still great and good people even though they are outnumber they still try to do what is right.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|There are no words to express how much I absolutely loved this book! Ready Player One was without a doubt my favorite book of 2011.<br /><br />What I loved about this book: EVERYTHING.<br /><br />This story takes place in the not so distant future, where the World is so bleak that everyone spends the majority of their time in a virtual World, called the Oasis. Many students now go to School in the Oasis in virtual classrooms and even more work in the Oasis. While I am still not certain if this book is YA (to be honest, I don't think it is) the character at the center of the book is Wade, a teenager who is on the hunt to find the hidden egg in the Oasis. This story was very reminiscent of Willy Wonka - just replace the candy with 80's fanboy nostalgia and video games.<br /><br />The characters were extremely well developed and I was particularly fond of Art3mis. The Oasis was so well described that I felt like I was immersed into this virtual World while reading the book. The 80's nostalgia was rampant and while at times it was maybe too present, I found it entertaining. Even though I was born in the 80's, I am a self-confessed nerd and I loved all of the references, particularly those to video games. I am also a huge World of Warcraft/MMO fan and player, so I enjoyed the MMO aspect of the book a great deal as well. That is not to say that if you are not a child of the 80s and don't enjoy video games that you won't like it, because I think this book would be appealing to just about anyone.<br /><br />I apologize that this review is probably jumbled and incoherent, but when I think about this book, so many thoughts come to mind that I cannot even properly sort them all. I just LOVED this book. I think what I found most intense and somewhat scary is that I could believe this World could happen. I know some think it's a bit of a stretch, but I have already seen in the here and now people use video games - especially MMO's - to escape the pain of reality and if our World was as awful as the one described in this book, I believe it is completely plausible that people would escape to a video game.<br /><br />I am so impressed by Ernest Cline and I cannot wait to read his next book - I have a feeling that regardless of what the story is about - I am going to love it. I do hope he decides to return to this story one day because there is plenty of room for a sequel and I would love to read more about Art3mis, Wade and Aech's journey!was as awful as the one described in this book, I believe it is completely plausible that people would escape to a video game.<br /><br />I am so impressed by Ernest Cline and I cannot wait to read his next book - I have a feeling that regardless of what the story is about - I am going to love it.

B00A6PD9I4|5.0|I like animation.  I especially like a good story.  This one was fun and had a good story.  I liked it.
B0052RE4MQ|3.0|**MAY INCLUDE SPOILERS**<br /><br />It's hard to even know exactly where to begin. I wanted so badly to love this book, because I have been dying to read it from the moment I finished Matched last year, which I had given 5-stars to. While Matched is perhaps closer to 4-stars at times, ultimately I found myself very interested in the World that Condie built and in the relationships developed throughout the book. Unfortunately loving Crossed is out of the question and I realized this very early on.<br /><br />The book begins right where Matched left off. I won't go into what happens in the book, since so many people have already covered that, but I will say that little happens that falls outside of the description of the book. This book is SO slow. There were many times where I would close my Kindle App and start playing Words with Friends, because the book would get to such a boring state that I wanted to wake myself up a bit before trying to continue on. I feel like a very large portion of the book could have been cut out and I would have enjoyed it just the same. Better yet, had they cut a huge portion of the book out and replaced it with things that ACTUALLY mattered, I would have loved it, just as I had hoped to.<br /><br />Boredom aside, the other large complaint I have about Crossed is the alternating narratives. Now, don't get me wrong, I actually quite enjoy alternating narratives and I enjoy seeing things from a different perspective, but not if you cannot determine whose POV you are reading from. There were MANY times where the only way I could differentiate between who was speaking was to turn back to the chapter page to see if it was titled Cassia or Ky. Neither of the two main characters had a distinct voice for a good chunk of the chapters. I think toward the end I did find it easier to differentiate between the two, as I much preferred reading from Ky's POV. Cassia for the later part of the book got on my nerves, a lot.<br /><br />Another aspect that kind of bothered me after the fact was that I did not really feel that Cassia and Ky had a huge connection. I realize they are doing these crazy things to get to each other, but I just didn't feel it. From Ky's POV, I did feel he loved her and I found his love so endearing, but from Cassia's POV, I felt the truest emotions felt were for Xander, which wasn't what I expected and I don't think it was what the author intended. To go through what they have, I expect there to be an intense love between the two, as you would have no motivation otherwise to go through these things and I just did not feel it. To be honest, I felt by the end the Cassia actually cared more about The Rising than about Ky and that really irked me. Now, this may just be me, as I have seen plenty of reviews where people swooned over their love, but I just did not feel that connection when I read from Cassia's POV. It all felt very superficial. This was one of the factors that toward the end helped me better differentiate between the two POVs - if the love seemed sincere, I knew it was Ky, otherwise I knew it had to be Cassia.<br /><br />The last thing that really bothered me was the vagueness of it all. Who is The Enemy? How can an entire book go on about The Enemy attacking without once implying who they may be? Are they Farmers, people from the Rising, people from Society? I don't know and neither will you, not even after reading the entire book. I did feel at the very end, when Ky sees the burned airship that Indie got on, that it does suggest that the Rising may also be the Enemy, but this was only one of the last pages of the book! We also learn very little about the Rising and even less about the Society. I would have enjoyed this so much more if the author had replaced some of the many pages about how some random item like a leaf reminds the character of some random day like in the Spring of 2003 (ok - that is seriously what a large part of the book was like) with a better explanation aboutwho these different groups are and/or what their motivations are.<br /><br />These four major things aside, there were aspects I liked about the book. I really enjoyed the new characters that were introduced, particularly Eli and Vick (I felt on the verge of tears when Vick died - particularly after he shared about his love for Laney - it was devastating!) however it seems Indie is the character who will probably be one of the most important supporting characters. I haven't entirely decided on if I like Indie or not, but I think that was perhaps the intent of the author, so she did her job well in that aspect! While I liked Xander in the first book, I loved him in the second. Even though Xander makes only one physical appearance in the book, he is spoken about a lot and you learn so much more about who he is; I developed quite a fondness for him. I think ultimately in book 3, he will end up with Indie and I am not sure how I feel about that; I am hoping I will find her character more likable in book 3.<br /><br />I also felt as they traveled throughout the canyons that I had a very clear picture of what everything looked like, how everyone felt...I could easily picture these poisoned rivers and painted caves and found the descriptions were great. In fact, I found some pieces of the writing beautiful. Unfortunately these things that I liked did not really makeup for the parts that drove me crazy, so I still finished the book a bit disappointed...okay, VERY disappointed. Had this not been a sequel to a book I so enjoyed, I would not have finished it or I would have taken months to finish it. While this book did have it's flaws, I still plan to read the 3rd one to see how this journey will end.who these different groups are and/or what their motivations are.<br /><br />These four major things aside, there were aspects I liked about the book.

B003RV43X4|4.0|Cool series.  Like Fantasy stuff.  This had interesting characters and character villians.  Poor medusa lol.  Anywho enjoyed the entertaintment.  Fun show.
0316056863|1.0|I bought this book to entertain and educate me on a flight about a fascinating, successful personality.  The collective \\"WE\\" love Tina Fey.  I was extremely disappointed to find the content just a confetti mix of vulgarity, 10 cent words, and incomplete sentences.  Sorry, Tina.  Off to the recycling bin you go!
B008EQIEWS|4.0|I like the series. I liked being pulled into a show and forget about the world.  Watch fantasy a bit and its pretty cool.  Story was fun.
B00846REIS|5.0|Cannot put down once started! A very well planned and thought of and there is no low, it's just getting higher and higher tat u want to know what is next.
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|Love the movie greatly.  I was wondering how they were going to do it with so many actor from iron man, thor, etc.  Turned out almost perfect except.  I was really really mad they didnt Edward Norton in from the Incredible Hulk movie.  Love the movie. .better than that terrible movie Hulk.  I was mad.  Even looked it up.  Said he was going to contracted to do it but Marvel said it was money issues.  My foot!!  Then there was replies that people wanted to see the hulk and not the actor.  Cheap jerks.  Thought the actor they used wasnt bad just hate it when stupid idiots jerk around the audience when there was an actor for that role already and they change it.  Its like the batman serries.  Michael Keaton great. batman 1 and 2 then bam.. change actors.  its like really?! come on!!  Anyway love the show.. just urked over Edward Norton.  Those at marvel that made that decision need to fired.  I dont believe money issue is a problem for marvel.
B00A6PD9I4|4.0|a nice movie showing the power of a strong willed girl but it was missing something?like maybe a little romance

B008AK8FHM|5.0|I found this book to be a real page turner.  Dr. Alexander was able to meld faith with science, which gives this topic a great deal of credibility.

B006TLFPKO|5.0|arrived on time and was cost effective loved watching in the privacy of my own home over and over and over
B008M87GJK|5.0|The interface is very good and I really like how the headlines are presented with pictorial presentation and a summary just long enough to give the user information to dig deeper.
B003OHSFR6|5.0|love the books  larsen was a great writer I will miss the next ten books he had planned for the series
B00322PKAI|2.0|Great colors! Stylish, but poor quality. The hard plastic band broke after just 5 months, not making it worth the price. The band is hard to replace. It's also very loud. I've had complaints about the ticking from small children and also from co workers in meetings. Love the colors, but wouldn't buy it again.
B007L3BMGA|2.0|Was talked into reading this very average piece of literature by colleagues, who apparently thought it was worth reading. I paid for it so I read.
1609611543|5.0|This is like in the matrix, if you take the red pill you will have to see how reality really is. Or you can take the blue pill and go back to eating all the genetically mutated wheat sold in the modern marketplace. This book is scarier than anything Stephen King ever wrote.
B0098VYCCE|1.0|Sad to say yet must agree that the acting was grade D and the plot was worthless.  The dwarfs appeared very late in the production and were UGLY and not at all endearing as in the original fairy tale.  The characters were not developed at all.  Pathetic.
B0098VXMNE|1.0|There was too much killing and gore with no plot or suspense.  The acting was terrible as well.  Wish we hadn't ordered it.
B000JO9JHW|5.0|Michael C Hall is fantastic and the main reason that the show is entertaining. Definitely not a show for everyone, but, anyone who is interested in what goes on in the minds of sociopaths will love this show.

0385344228|5.0|There are no spoilers in this review.<br /><br />I cannot remember exactly when I started to read `Defending Jacob,' but when I did, almost everything around me came to a halt.  Again, I did no laundry and prepared fewer dinners than usual.  This book is simply all consuming and written with fluidity of plot, as well as presenting finely crafted characters.<br /><br />`Defending Jacob' is a story that will haunt a reader.  Why?  Not only does author William Landay present an absorbing psychological mystery/thriller, but also he provoked this reader into delving into the values of our society today, as well as issues revolving around nature vs. nurture.<br /><br />If you like reading totally absorbing courtroom dramas you will undoubtedly enjoy this book.  Additionally, if you enjoy reading books that explore family dynamics, this is for you, as well.<br /><br />Allow me this.  I not only read this book, but I [almost] entered the book.  I was in court, as well as Whole Foods, the Barber residence, jail and other places.  I just finished `Defending Jacob,' and I am drained.  I loved this book!
B004MC0FO8|5.0|Just what I needed, I always listen to a song on the radio that I really enjoyed and I always find myself going online to find it on the show's playlist. This is a great convenience.
B0092MKFIY|5.0|I checked out this EP for $4 after listening to couple of their singles from a friend--it turns out they're pretty darn tasty. Throw in Passion Pit sound with some Of Monsters and Men, some The Killers-esque vocals and a hint of OneRepublic, and you've got Imagine Dragons. Thoroughly surprised and pleased with this album--it's a steal for the price it's currently offered for.
B000YDOOU0|5.0|As a hopeless Metheny Group fan, I generally tended to prefer the group material to his solo offerings and collaborations with other musicians.  And this one is much more in a \\"traditional jazz\\" vein than Metheny Group - somewhat similar approach to his 1984 Rejoicing (which is far from his best).<br /><br />But surprise!  Just like his 2006 collaboration with pianist, Brad Mehldau, I love it!  Although it features one member of Metheny Group (new drummer Antonio Sanchez), it is clearly more in line with traditional jazz than I usually prefer.  And yet I can't help thinking of it as some of Pat's best ever compositions.<br /><br />Judging from the fact that my appreciation for other albums of a similar vein has not changed much, all I can figure is that Metheny has become to jazz what Paul McCartney became to rock: namely, one of the best writers of complex and beautiful melodies the jazz world has had.  Listen to At Last You're Here, Snova, Is This America? and Dreaming Trees (the quiet numbers) for proof.  And yet the quicker numbers, Son of Thirteen, Calvin's Keys and Day Trip are just as delightful as they are swinging.<br /><br />Another nice feature is When We Were Free, a remake of a Metheny Group song from their '96 album Quartet.  This is the song that convinced me to buy the album.  And I'm glad I did, because it is a delight in every way - the writing, performance and overall feel.  I hope Metheny keeps at it, because he just keeps getting better and better...

B001R6D7I8|1.0|My son had to read this for an English course, and I read it as well.<br /><br />My verdict: I told the English department to drop it from the syllabus (and they said they would).  It's a tawdry story from post-Christian Germany of underage sex of a teenage boy and middle-aged woman (with the kid's parents totally in the dark about their son's life, and how he was being polluted).<br /><br />And what does one get for enduring the depressing tale?  There's nothing spectacular from a literary view in the telling of the story, and the conclusion is nothing more than a one-liner punchline.<br /><br />Two thumbs down.  I don't recommend it for anyone.

The author has an excellent grasp of the current and potential impact of social media on the way we do business. Some great marketing ideas for startups in this book as well. Great read!
B007QPFGJW|1.0|when I read a novel ,especially  the spy/thriller variety , I like to be reasonably interested within the first 20 percent of the book.If the book  is meandering that far in I place it in the BORING category .I also place it on the shelf or in the case of my kindle, the already read file.Thank you kindle for not having this book take up space in my house.I have been reading  duds lately but thank you Vince Flynn for breaking that streak,review to come.If you haven't guessed how I feel about this book by now you may enjoy it...
0345522478|4.0|Two thousand year-old druid Atticus O'Sullivan has relocated to present day Tempe, Arizona, in an attempt to avoid a centuries-in-the-making throw-down with his ancient enemy, Aenghus &Oacute;g, who wants Atticus' sword and Atticus' head, pretty much in that order. Smart dialogue, good action scenes, a series made for Jim Butcher fans. Of which I am one, and I'll be following Atticus on his future adventures. From a safe distance.
B007HACDLK|4.0|just  finished this novel and it is great to have Vince Flynn back.I have been reading one poorly written book after another recently  so it is great to have the master back.This  is not one of the best Flynn novels but his average novel is usually  way above most  authors of this genre.There are times where the pacing  to the story lags somewhat but just when one interest starts to wane the plot picks up.In this novel I felt  Flynn may have let the major twist  to the story out a little too soon.I sensed he could have developed  the Swiss banker character more  before tipping his hand on the main development of the story. Of course  we may be reading more about  the Swiss banker in the next Flynn novel  per the stories ending .<br />I would  rate this book a 4.5 , Mitch Rapp is such a great character,and  Flynn does not beat you over the head with him .Vince I hope your health is  good  and we get  to read many more novels  from you.We need many more because they are so good one devours your novels too quickly.

B002RXVOX0|5.0|Like many of the other reviewers of this movie, I was totally seduced and swept away by the sensuousness and the lush, gothic beauty of this ( then) astonishingly different take on the Dracula legend. Langella's performance is one that I hope he still derives great pride and satisfaction from. It is heart-stopping. Unlike other reviewers, I don't mind the director's &#34;tinkering&#34; with the color on the new releases. I thought that it was a bit garish on it's first go-round. The more muted palette conveys the &#34;gothic-ness&#34; much better than the<br />saturated colors of the 70's. My one complaint about the re-release is that in some of the exterior 'night' shots, it is so dark that much of the action can't be seen clearly. Perhaps that can be corrected in the next round. The casting for this film is superb, and the acting is uniformly excellent. Without a doubt, the soundtrack provided by the great John Williams gives the perfect audial compliment to the visual sensuality on-screen. It is one of the most haunting and evocative scores I have ever heard. I also very much enjoyed the commentary added with Mr. Langella and director John Badham. Often times the 'behind the scenes' tidbits really fill out areas of the film and give excellent views into the mindset and the processes used by the actors and the director in bringing this extraordinary vision to the screen.<br />All this being said, I would have been overjoyed if all concerned had had the courage to 'think outside the box' to the final conclusion. And still, all these years later, am so disappointed that they did not. By bringing this film to life as an unabashedly erotic love story -how wonderful to have been able to break from the mythic mold and have the Count and Lucy ( an elegantly powerful Kate Nelligan) escape on their ship of dreams with only the sound of the howl of a wolf drifting shoreward on the wind to a hapless and outsmarted Van Helsing ( a superb turn by the  great Sir Laurence Olivier ) and the kind - but pedestrian - Jonathan Harker ( wonderfully played by Trevor Eve). I don't think any woman who has ever seen this film was pleased about the ending. In a perfect world there'd be the opportunity for a 'do-over'...but until then, bear with the ending...or, like me - just don't watch the ending, and instead submerse yourself in one of the most amazing, voluptuous and romantic movies ever filmed.r ) and the kind - but pedestrian - Jonathan Harker ( wonderfully played by Trevor Eve).

The color of this Columbo series is excellent but it is in the 4:3 format which have bars on the right and left sides of the widescreen television.

B005LAIHYU|4.0|I read the book before I watched the movie. The book itself was written very different than most of the books I read. It was more curiousity than anything else that made me finish reading it. The movie was more interesting than the book but I am glad I read the book first to understand what was happening in the movie. Seeing the main story woven into the historical events of the time was interesting. Although this is not the best movie I have ever seen I enjoyed it just for the entertainment value. I don't like to tear a book or movie apart & give opinions on every little part of the movie or book. I watch & read for entertainment value only & I enjoyed the movie.
B005NKGEP2|4.0|It's always a pleasant surprise to find something on whimsy at the local library.  This was the case for this reviewer perusing the shelves and finding `The Expats', written by Chris Pavone.<br /><br />Set in some intriguing European locales such as, Luxembourg, France, Amsterdam and Germany the story unfolds as the main character Kate Moore and her husband Dexter and two young children move from D.C. to the continent.<br /><br />Dexter is ostensibly a computer security expert; Kate the wife in tow, though really former CIA, seeking to reinvent herself while providing some separation from her past.  Characters and plot lines are well defined and interestingly not all that they appear to be to the reader.<br /><br />Enter another American expat couple and things really start to get interesting.  Suspicions and paranoia grow as do conflicting and shrouded agendas.  Similar to peeling back layers of a leafy vegetable or onion, there is more underneath than what meets the eye.  As is often the case with novels rooted in suspense or espionage plot twists and turns can appear to be disjointed. This is true in `The Expats' as the timeline shifts between past and present.  However, to the authors credit there's tremendous attention paid to detail.  As a result, virtually all of the seemingly unresolved circumstances are brought full circle by book's end.<br /><br />\\"The Expats' is the author's first novel.  I highly recommend this book as a welcome addition to the genre and look forward to his next endeavor.
B009GEBBNQ|4.0|While parts of the Captain America and all of Thor felt rushed The Avengers was given all of the time needed to be a good movie. It didn't drag on in any particular part and the characters felt fleshed out. It is by no means going to be a classic but it is a fun watch.
B000244FDW|5.0|As a huge Jane Austin fan, and P&P being my absolute favorite, I have watched all the versions of it I can find, but none compare to the 1980's BBC version.  It stays truer to the book, and the actress portraying Elizabeth Bennett does a perfect job.  In the later one, the actress portraying Elizabeth does so as if she is ready to giggle at a moment's notice, and makes Lizzy seem more of an air head.  Colin Firth is gorgeous as Darcy, but David Rintoul is classic.  All three versions are good, each having something special about it, but to stay true to the book, and to portray the characters so vividly and accurately, I have to pick this one.  Though again, any of them are great to watch if you need a Jane Austin fix, or just want a wonderful romantic movie.  This movie is the perfect chic flick that all others must compare to.

B009CG2YDE|4.0|Definitely 'old school', except the control uses tilt, instead of buttons, to move your little shop left and right.  This works ok, and the firing is automatic, kind of like in Radiant HD.  It lets you get some power-ups, and the action definitely reminds me of things like Galaga and similar games from that era. Not sure how long it will hold my attention, but it's not horrible, which is saying a lot for the FAOTD's lately.

B009FOBZL0|4.0|This album is a solid piece of work from the band. While it's not the Wallflowers sound of old it's a more mature outing similar to Pearl Jam after Virology. When you hear it there's no mistaking who the band is but with a slightly different flavor. If you're a fan of Jakobs solo efforts you'll be pleased as the lyrics are reminiscent of those albums but with a more upbeat rock and roll force behind them.
B003SI9WYG|5.0|A very well done movie! I had been waiting for a year to watch this and amazon provided a great opportunity for me to!
B007EECSFA|5.0|Kate Morton writes a great story, but more than that, I come away from her books with a bit more knowledge & nostalgia of another era in our history. Her characters in this book are, as usual, so real. Another wonderful book. She shines in a world where many authors dwell on cliche and fluff. This has history, suspense, family values, romance, and how one small event can impact lives forever.

B008GXHOFW|2.0|There is a huge download but totally worth it. The game is great until it crashes...over and over and over again. It sucks you in and then will not let you enjoy it again. Very disappointed in this black Friday purchase. I hope the creators can get this fixed or it will be a big negative on their reputation. Hope that doesn't happen.
B000IKQMFO|5.0|This is a film you can watch over and over again; each time you pick up something you missed before.  The characters are intriguing, the story is engrossing.  The Ivor Novello songs, performed beautifully by Jeremy Northam, really evoke the period.  This one of my all-time favorite films.

B009P5S11G|5.0|This album is alot better than I thought initially it was going to be...I am not a true R&B fan, so when I heard the album samples, I didn't have a good beginning with it.  I was expecting Talk that Talk part 2, but it leaned more towards an R&B specialty.  But when I listened to it in my car, it was excellent.  Not too over-produced, so you can totally hear the vocal qualities very clearly.  It's great. I would recommend it to non-fans, and the die-hards. It's most indefinitely good.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Great book. You truly don't know what might happen next. The story is bizarre and thrilling. I can't wait to read another one of her books.
B009NPKTN6|1.0|Terrible film. The set pieces were the only thing that was at all moving. There were slight hints of nostalgia and novelty from various song choices, but the cues for the songs, the dialog, and the plot timing was so overwhelmingly whack that I can't believe I paid real, actual money for this. It was my girlfriend's choice. Even she regrets it.

It was simple and straight forward...  and it said everything I wanted to tell her about the male species...  So we read this book together  -- Yes, we read it out loud before bed each evening and literally giggled together saying \\"We will NEVER fall for this crap from a guy!\\"<br /><br />Ok, I'm a high school administrator with a specialization in school counseling and my daughters and I have always been extremely close.  But like all teenagers, Mom is the last one they want advice from....

We even used REAL examples of REAL people to reinforce the legitimacy of the book's content. THIS BOOK isn't just for teenagers.... It is an eye-opener for ladies in long-term relationships; for ladies who are waiting for that guy to \\"finally come around\\"....<br /><br />I give this book a Thumbs Up and 5*****'s...

She explains what she was thinking and feeling as a child. Her attitude is amazing, even after the fact and I truly think some if these negative reviewers could take a hint about kindness from Jaycee.<br /><br />Of course it's violent. She was kidnapped and raped for 18 years! I hope she knows that her book is an inspiration to many and her attitude warms my heart.

B0025UHKNS|2.0|I received this as a Christmas present from my wife, so I am conflicted about even posting my comments on this watch. It's been a year, so I feel I've given it a fair shake.<br /><br />I read many of the criticisms of this watch with tremendous empathy.  The bevel is poorly designed and not at all intuitive.  Transferring data from the device to my laptop is a crap-shoot with the stick.  Finally, the GPS distances it computes don't sync with other mapping software or even the odometer on my car.<br /><br />Like I said, perhaps I'm a simpleton, but I want a functional watch/heart monitor/gps device for my training runs that's EASY to use.  The Garmin 405CX does not fill the need.

0547884591|3.0|I am a fan of Tim Ferris but I have to say that this book over promises and under delivers. Ferris is the master of marketing and hype and even teaches you his techniques on his blog so it is very easy to pick out what he did. Here are some of my thoughts on the book.<br /><br />- The book claims it's not a book about cooking yet 80% of the content is food related. He talks a lot about meta-learning but doesn't really dive into learning types and just gives generic learning tips.<br />- The book reads almost like a magazine and jumps all over the place as you progress through.<br />- Random mens magazine style tips (how shoot a jumpshot??, Knifes, guns, camping etc) I feel like I'm reading a GQ magazine.<br />- Really big book, the formatting is good but some of the pictures looked very amateur.<br />- You can tell he didn't write a lot of content of the book. Ferris is the master of outsourcing yet he makes it seems like he is the jack of all trades.<br />- Tons of pages of recipes (I thought this wasn't a cookbook?)<br /><br />...more later as I progress through the book.<br /><br />Overall I would say that it is a very entertaining book but I didn't find it more educational than any magazine you can pickup off the newsstands.

B004HO6I2O|5.0|I watched this with my Husband and we BOTH really enjoyed it! It has a realistic portrayal of a marriage with children. I LOVED that the wife was a multi-faceted character. She is played with depth and honesty. (It would've been easy to have her just be a tool for comic folly) I highly recommend all married couples watch this film. (Also, the film PARENTHOOD w/ Steve Martin- classic!)

B009KS4XRO|3.0|Too long between free credits..you should be able to use your coins to buy more credits not just keys. But I love bongo so I'll continue to play
0399157565|4.0|great mystery.  could not put it down for over an hour at one part.  well worth the money - delilghted I bought it
B008BZIUHG|5.0|This California bands third album is a rowdy package of hard driving riffs, right off the mark, throw in a few screeching breaks, a couple laid back soulful tunes, combined with concise vocals and you have something unique.<br /><br />The band's soulful, funk and blues influences float casually to the forefront. This is 70's influenced music but with a varied approach. It has the Zeppelin rhythm layer into it laced with a progressive present day feel. The lyrics keep it current with a Devin Townsend/Joe Bonamassa kind of feel to the vocals. [[ASIN:B001PCJG52 The Ballad of John Henry]]<br /><br />Lead guitarist Scott Holiday sounds like he is a Jimmy Page clone at times while Robin Everhart and Michael Miley keep the rhythm lines tight.<br /><br />The sound is like a fusion of rock classics spanning 50 years and is flawless with a fresh feel to it. Check out the Norman Greenbaum(Spirit In The Sky) influence on the \\"All the Way\\" track laced with a Grand Funk (Some Kind of Wonderful)flavor. I really can hear the Joe Bonamassa tone in Jay Buchanan's vocals(Run from Revelation cut) with a smidgen of Glenn Hughes. The guitar work also really stands out and reeks of Joe B.<br /><br />This Band is an evolution of greatness and if they can keep it together will definitely make their mark, big time.<br /><br />Enough said, pick it up and be amazed by the classic sound.<br /><br />For previews of music and videos not available on Amazon, check out Rival Son's \\"Head Down: Deluxe\\" on You Tube.<br /><br />If this band interests you then try out any offering by Joe Bonamassa and be further amazed.
B004HW7JH4|5.0|awesome TV show.  I grew up in the 60's & bought lots of 45s.  Seeing the clothes & social mores of those times brings back the good old days in my head at least for a while.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|it's a pretty good game. it can be frustrating since one energy takes three min to fill. plus a lot of the items are ridiculously expensive when you reach the higher levels.
B00164GDA0|5.0|even better in bluray.  I can almost feel myself walking down those railrtoad tracks with those kids looking for that body.
B009VLX8FS|4.0|Really great album yet again from Taylor Swift, though I do not think it is her best. I would say the songs are aboiut 50/50 in which half are original Taylor sound and the other half nothing like her original sound. I must say I love the duet with snow patrol front man.
0525478817|5.0|This book was just plain amazing. Everything was in it: sadness, humor (I laughed out loud at some parts), soul, and romance. I personally do not like sob stories, that is before I read this book. I don't know what quality made it so, but this changed my perspective on sad stories. I would recommend this to anyone in a heartbeat, especially if that someone was looking for something to feed the soul and teach about life. This book also has an abnormal abundance of quote-worthy phrases. I wrote down a few just so that I would remember them for a long time. I learned so much about life from this book.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|Amazing storyline! Absolutely holds my attention, and I can't wait for the next episode.  If you've not seen it, you'll want to!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|many many flow puzzles to solve ranging from easy to near impossible.  works great on both phone and tablet.  many hours of enjoyment.
B009WO7NQO|4.0|Very good game that requires one to think and plan.. Great to pass the time with and stay entertained for awhile.
B007MDB6L0|5.0|My 3 year old grandaughter loves it.  She loves anything with pixies in it.  She is a big Tinkerbell fan.
B00A7ZXDLQ|4.0|if your a fan of ri-ri you will love this cd of new music. new fans should enjoy the versatility of the beats & vocal arrangements as well. very solid cd.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I have a 5 year old Autistic grandson if he does what he is suppose to do he gets a reward of 6 angry bird games.  When he is at my house now he can get his reward.  He can play it better than me.
1469984202|5.0|I stumbled upon this by accident and I'm glad I did. What a great read!<br />So glad I got the whole set at once and they flowed nicely.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Must watch!!!  Great suspense, character development and plot structure!  Following Season 2's wild ending Season 3 has so far delivered on the expected amazing story line!!!
B006YXTRHY|5.0|Cant wait to see Part 2!! It was as good as all the other Twilight movies. It leaves you on edge waiting for the next one.
B002C4YYEU|5.0|This will be a timeless classic. One of the best films I have ever seen. So easily to emotionally attach yourself to the characters and the story. Such a beautiful script.
B0086700CM|5.0|I am addtive to the game. I can stopping playing just one game. I learned to look ahead before jumping. if you like a game that you can't put the game down you'll. love this game.
B008GXHOFW|2.0|right when I installed it it wouldn't work. it went to the video then exited out. it might be good but it wont even work
B00846REIS|1.0|Read this book upon completion of the 50 Shades trilogy.  The two story lines read so similar it was a little ridiculous.  With 50 Shades, I found myself wanting to get into Christian's head.  With Bared To You, I didn't need to try to think like the characters, I already knew the storyline.  Gideon = Christian.  Eva = Ana. Cary = Jose.  Victor = Ray.  Angus = Taylor. So on and so forth...  Although this book was a little more crass...  I completed the book because I downloaded it and couldn't return it.  If Sylvia Day wanted to pen a book, original ideas would have been a better option.  This is where my relationship with Gideon/Eva ends.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|If you like comedy this is the book for you. It is one of the best books I have read.
B006LSZECO|1.0|I am an avid reader especially when it comes to mysteries.  I waited for 4 months to get this book from the library and when it finaly was available I couldn't wait to read it.  It was the most boring and dragged out novel I have read it a long time.  The build up from reviews had grabbed my interest to read it but now I wish I had let it slip through my fingers.
B009CG2YDE|1.0|I try to rate fairly, but when I see fake reviews from the creator it just gets under my skin.
B00A7H2NC4|4.0|The panel view interface is intuitive, works smoothly and is fairly accurate. There were one or two hiccups with out of sequence panels but that happens to me when I read comic books anyway.<br /><br />Sin City is all it's cracked up to be. I'm not a graphic novel guy per se, but seeing what became the movie has made me appreciate Miller's vision and the contribution he has made to both his own medium and others.<br /><br />I purchased a reprint of \\"Watchmen\\" and even after one reading the binding was feeling kind of iffy. It's nice to have it in this format and not worry about mangling an expensive book. I'll read more graphic novels now than I would have otherwise.
B000X1Z0BU|5.0|Not sure why or how this movie totally sneaked by me upon its original release...I don't even recall hearing the title track until seeing it performed on the Tony Awards. Well THANKS to the Tony's and the stunning live performance, I tracked down the movie and the music and I think I'm changed forever. There's something about \\"knowing\\" that other \\"YOUNG\\" people on this planet BELIEVE that a man and woman can connect on a level that transcends SEX SCENES and BREAK UP SCENES and truly unite on the most human of levels...in perfect harmony. It just KNOCKED ME OUT! I sobbed with gratitude during the final credits. Its no wonder it became such a successful musical...every scene offers a new song better than the next...utterly unforgettable. Now to find my friends who saw it 5 YEARS AGO and share thoughts...if they can remember! Now one of my top ten of all time, no question.
B000W91RUG|5.0|I loved getting this. I felt like it was more than reasonable, and they came around the time they said they would. And I totally enjoyed this first season of this show, and I plan on buying more. Great job u guys thank you.
B008KE3960|3.0|Need to enhance the small details and responses/tank kills. However, have only used a couple of times... Am an X pilot and like the P-51 in lots of areas..Something I like to do on Kindle Fire..
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Great  app. So easy to download!  Love always having  my Kindle Books with me at all times.Very easy to use. Pages turn even easier than the Kindle does. LOVE IT!  Shopping for new books is also easy.  Highly recommend it.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|Pure adrenaline straight into the vein.  This is just simply a Fun movie to watch.  It is reason enough to own a 3d tv.  Tip of the hate to joss whedon, you finally got the Hulk right!  Puny God indeed!
B00A3DZ61W|5.0|Awesome. I'm only writing this much because it is required that I do so or I can't do a review
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Anyone who loves a good apocalyptic story, they're gonna love this show.  The zombies are simply the cause, what makes it great is how the characters are written, and performances from the actors.  It leaves you wondering, would I have reacted any better?  Would I have made a different choice?
B007SGLZP8|2.0|Reads like cheap ten cent novel. Way below Grisham's history, I've read all his books. I was disappointed to say the least.
B00A6N8F4Y|1.0|An inane plot about unlikable characters with a few moments worth watching: birds flying and waves dancing. A royal waste.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Several plot twists kept my attention and I couldn't put this novel down.  Character development drives the story and the characters evolve believably, but unpredictably.  The ending was also unpredicted but very depressing.
B000YHG72E|5.0|This is one of the only modern Christmas classics. Hilarious, sweet, charming! A must watch every year! Zooey Deschanel looks so young!
B0000042H4|4.0|Excellent performances. Unfortunately, the technical recording is lacking due to time, but still very listenable. Highest drama captured. This Ring cycle is gold.
B008D28HYS|5.0|I love this app.  It's great for when you have some down time and enjoy solving puzzles. My only complaint is there are multiple occurrences of the same type of puzzle (i.e. apple). Other than that it's great.
