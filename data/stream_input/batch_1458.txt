B004AHNIGM|2.0|I continue to buy and listen to new Allman Brothers and Gregg Allman albums hoping that they somehow evolve and grow that unique and creative sound they had in the 1960s through mid 1970s. Unfortunately,the sound never quite gets there and most of the albums sound like they are unsuccessfully trying to duplicate the sound they had in the early 1970s.<br /><br />This is the case in point. I am not sure who came up with the idea of Gregg Allman singing mostly blues cover songs, but I think it was a mistake at least for the listeners (or at least one). Several other artists have recorded many of these same songs and in my opinion, there are much better versions. Although Gregg Allman's voice sounds better than the last couple of albums, the songs are old hat.<br /><br />As far as the production and sound, the album was inconsistent in my opinion. Some songs sounded good through the speakers while other songs sounded over produced leading to a muddy recording.<br /><br />Gregg Allman has done better (Laid Back) and done worse (I'm No Angel), I just don't believe he brought anything different or better to the table with this album.

B0055EAJ7A|5.0|Never has a comic book movie captured the scheer wonder, imagination and cosmic greatness as Thor! I passed on seeing this movie in the theater thinking I would not be interested. What a mistake! I am a comic book fan but I never seemed to like Thor as a character. Because this movie was delivered so well, not only did I love the movie but I am now a Thor fan. I get the character now. Chris Hemsworth played Thor so well. He really captured the strength and also the sensitivity of the character, and really made you care about what he is going through. Loki played by Tom Hiddelston is amazing as well, playing his part so well that you are not sure if you want to punch Loki or feel bad for him.<br /><br />This movie was filled with some of the most beautiful and terrifying character and scenery that I have seen in a long time. Great CGI work, awesome story telling and great actors have made this Sci-fi, action, drama, comic film an instant classic, and something that will be hard to match. I Just Saw The Avengers film, which was amazing but to me this is right up there with it. Keep it up Marvel Studios, you have a great universe expanding! I can't wait to see Thanos in action in the future!<br /><br />You certainly get your money's worth with this 3D Package, pretty much covering all the formats. Great packaging and delivery here, very high quality product.
0812416503|5.0|The tale of Rebecca is a thrilling read from start to finish.  She was a beautiful, talented woman who cared only for herself and used others.  However, she hid the selfish attributes behind an exterior that seemed to make everyone love her except her husband who knew who she really was.  Rebecca died in a boating accident and her husband, Max, was grief stricken.  He traveled to try to recover and he meets a very young woman who makes him laugh and enjoy life once again.  She is a companion to an elderly woman.  When the woman returns home, Max marries the young woman and takes her to Manderley, the beautiful home treasured by his family and decorated lavishly by Rebecca.<br /><br />Everywhere the young wife looks she sees Rebecca's influence.  Even the housekeeper who cared for Rebecca as a child until her death resents her presence.  Sinister, devious, she plans to evict her from Manderley.  To the young wife, it seems as if Max can only think about Rebecca.  He shows little affection and expects much.  While her youth and inexperience were part of what caught Max's attention, it  leads her into frightening experiences and social errors that make her doubt her decision to marry Max even though she loves him dearly.<br /><br />As the story unfolds, one discovers there is much more to Rebecca's life than one can imagine.  Manderley is only a one place where she spends her time.  The ending is unexpected and exciting making this one of the best reads of the year for me.

B0080CL0HM|5.0|I loved Bel Ami.  Read the book, left me yearning for more.  The actors were dazzling, and the director nailed it.  Robert Pattinson dazzled me and got it right. What a great movie.  All the women in the movie did a great job on the characters; loved the 1890 costumes.  I will watch again and again  It does feel rushed, but captures the fervor of Guy Maupassant's book. Thanks Amazon.com for having both the book and film.

B004A8ZWVK|5.0|I loved the novel and couldn't wait to see the movie. I was only slightly disappointed because some things were changed for the movie but overall, what makes this movie memorable are the wonderful performances. Emma Stone, Viola Davis, Jessica Chastain, and Octavia Spencer are fantastic! In the beginning of the film, when Davis glances over at a picture of her son, and has to look away fast...oh my god that scene just broke my heart! The ending is very sad too so make sure you have some tissues nearby! The Help is a heartwarming drama, and it's even better the second time around! I highly recommend it and don't forget to read the novel, it's so funny and moving. Enjoy!

0345803485|4.0|It is so disappointing to see people blast a negative review about the trilogy when all were aware the story was based on erotica. Please do not waste the time of these readers with your criticism. You knew going in what the craze was about and expected to find something else. You were intrigued like everyone else and that was your intent. What your goal from reading is determined by you. There is no lack of material to meet everyone's needs so if erotica is not your genre then don't read it.
B004H1V5RU|4.0|This toy is really cool. You can really get lost in this thing, and it's quite challenging. The one that I got however was broken. This toy has a lot of tiny pieces on the inside, and it's apparently easily breakable. It was just a tiny piece that was broken off, so I'm pretty sure the seller just didn't notice it. I'd imagine that if you dropped this toy on the ground you could easily dislodge a piece. I would probably only recommend this for older children. It requires a bit of skill and concentration so you might not be able to get younger kids interested in it.
B007N5YJWK|5.0|One reviewer of the Criterion edition accurately distinguishes between two kinds of audio commentary on film, one focused on the production of the film (anecdotes, gossip) that does not discus the film itself and another that does the reverse.  I happen to dislike the former and like the latter.  Rudy Belmer's audiocommentaries will tell you nothing about Curtiz's Adventures of Robin Hood or, in the Criterion edition, about Olivier's Richard III as a film.  For me, they are a complex waste of time.  I admire Criterion for having scholars who actually know how to pay attention to the film they are discussing how to discuss its form, as is the case with The 39 Steps.  If you don't pay attention to the canted angle of the first shot in which Donat appears, buying a ticket, you are missing something (something  Hitchcock learned when he went to UFA studios outside Berlin and watched German Expressionist films).  If you don't appreciate the fact that Tippi Hedren's face does not appear in Marnie until five minutes into the film (when we have seen her packing up, leaving her hotel room, and then heading to the train station, you are missing something.  No filmmaker deserves and rewards close formal attention more than Hitchcock.  Having a bright, critically informed film scholar direct your attention to what you are actually watching is a real treat.  I can read about a film's production history or about a film star or even about the director on wikipedia if I want.  Hearing someone talk about what is right in front of you as you watch it is invaluable and irreplaceable.
0385339100|5.0|I couldn't put this book down.  I read too late at night!  I read in the morning!  However, I did want a different ending.  But, the ending Mr. Grisham decided on, really knocked my socks off.  John Grisham gets better with each book.
B0082K1LJY|5.0|Fans haven't liked the leviathon arc. This episode gives a tantalizing glimpse of what could have been. The ancient tablets gave Sam and Dean the information they need to make a weapon that will defeat the leviathan, but a weapon is one thing, victory another. For this weapon, among other things, they need the blood of an angel, the blood of a demon and the blood of an alpha vampire. Bobby has some ideas regarding tactics and strategy as well, but the boys are more and more worried that Bobby will become a vengeful spirit and are taking less and less heed of what he has to say. Kevin Tran is still being held hostage, as is his mother and his role as prophet could be an interesting addition.<br /><br />In this episode, Sam and Dean set out to get the ingredients for the weapon. Plot concentration is on the alpha vampire who holds a young girl hostage and has since she was eight years old. The blood of virgins is pure you see. The alpha vampire is on the side of the leviathons, but they may be about to double-cross him. This plot line, the alliance between the vampires and the leviathon could have been used over several episodes and could have made the leviathon arc much more interesting. So too could have been the development of a weapon to right them. Once again, Sam and Dean are forced to make questionable alliances - this could have been explored more fully. So, a good episode, but ultimately a bit of a tease as many of the solutions to the leviathon scourge strike the viewer as magical rather than earned - and they could easily have been earned, making this an outstanding season of Supernatural rather than a fair season. Recommended to fans for the improvement, but not the place to start for new viewers.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I like a good book as much as the next, but this book is total trash!  Can't believe I paid for it!  I deleted it from my kindle at about 23%.  I am amazed it's a best seller!!
B0064NTZQ2|5.0|After reading the reviews, it appears this is a movie most either love or hate. I am in the former camp. I think it was one of the best movies of the past year. Ryan Gosling's character (who has no name is the movie), is an first class, exceptional driver. Part time mechanic, Hollywood stuntman, and occasional get away driver, his affection for a married woman and her son, belie the violence he is capable of if provoked.  When her husband is released from prison, his feelings for her cause him to try and save her husband from the criminal elements to whom he owes protection money. That's when the story (and the violence), takes off. I thought the movie was as much a love story as it was a tale of violent actions, and murder. A great cast, and Albert Brooks did a convincing job in an unusual role. The sound track was exceptional, and if you don't find the movie as remarkable as I did, you have to admit the music was great. It does have it's violent scenes, but I thought they were necessary to the story and to the personalities involved. Watch this movie and judge for yourself.
1595828095|5.0|Dark Horses's collected editions of classic horror comics continues with this edition of Creepy classics.  Bernie Wrightson, best known for co-creating Swamp Thing with Len Wein, is one of the most prolific artists/personalities in comic books in the past five decades, and this collection wonderfully displays why that is.  Featuring tales including Poe's \\"The Black Cat\\", \\"The Muck Monster\\" (in color!), and \\"Jenifer\\"; the last story of which was turned into a Masters of Horror episode during its inaugural season.  Wrightson's lush artwork is wonderfully remastered, and the stories themselves still manage to pack a visceral punch even today.  All in all, this deluxe hardcover is gorgeously put together and deserves to have a place in your collection.

B001AQT0UY|4.0|Casual fans of the film probably won't rush out to pick up the \\"Gremlins: 25th Anniversary Edition\\" Blu-ray. The film wasn't remastered or restored for this release. Hardcore enthusiasts of the crazy little creatures will find enough here to justify the amount of money they'll spend to upgrade to the newer high definition model. The special features and improved audio will convince dedicated consumers to pick this up no doubt.
B006QLH7O4|4.0|The Final Destination movies are pretty (well, *really*) stupid. In fact, they're more \\"thrill park rides\\" than \\"movies.\\" This isn't the kind of thing you watch for character development and sharp, layered writing, so don't put this in the player looking for that. Instead, you get a thrill park ride with short bursts of \\"plot\\" thrown in between the action sequences. And for those action sequences alone, this is deserving of at least 3.5 stars... maybe a solid 4.<br /><br />The bridge scene, which really kicks off the whole movie, is the absolute highlight, and in the 3D presentation it's even better. you really get the sense of vertigo you feel from being high up on a bridge over water. Add to that the death sequences, which literally pop out at you, and you've got a really fun scene worthy of watching in three dimensions. Before that, the opening title sequence is also a blast, with stuff literally coming out at you over the credits.<br /><br />After that, the movie cools down a bit and no other sequence quite matches the 3D spectacle that preceded it (well, the very end--which echoes back to the first Final Destination movie--comes close, I suppose). The plot's pretty predictable, but it's great fun to see how the death scenes are set up and paid off. One in a massage parlor is particularly gratifying.<br /><br />In short, nothing mind-blowingly awesome, but it's definitely a fun, short entertaining 3D film.
B001PBEJL4|4.0|The \\"Camelot\\" 45th Anniversary Blu-ray is a must-own for musical enthusiasts and classic film fans. Its clean and striking picture partnered with a bombastic 5.1 surround mix is an experience you won't want to miss. The performances are stellar; the costumes are exceptionally detailed; and the sets are realistic and immense. The addition of the special features makes this a worthy addition to anyone's Blu-ray collection.

B007Q2N0HA|5.0|I have never written a review so bare with me. I heard about this book after reading fifty shades of grey trilogy, and wanting to read another book along those lines. And I have to agree with some of the other reviews...I loved Bared to You: A Crossfire Novel, so much more! I loved how Eva would not just take crap from Gideon, and liked that she put up a fight about a lot of things. Which, I thought was much more believable, as most of the women I know would not just roll over and take crap. There were a lot of emotional roller coaster points, waiting them to be together (the sex scenes were steamy) to what the heck is wrong with them. I could not put it down, and I am eagerly awaiting the next book!
0553582038|1.0|I loved the first three books in this series and now feel like I have to finish them all.  But I don't know why I bother since I end up skimming most of the time now anyway.<br /><br />With the first couple books I often found myself going back over passages that confused me, or looked back through the pages to refresh my memory on what Lord lived where or to whom he owed his allegiance.  Now I just don't care anymore.  This book dealves into the lives of the characters I care about the least.  And the few that I do care about, he only devotes two or three chapters to.  Instead of taking his brilliant story to a higher crescendo (or dare I say a resolution?) he creates new and ever more detailed side-stories using peripheral characters that nobody cares about.  It was tough getting through the first few chapters and to be honest it hasn't gotten much easier after that.<br /><br />Martin's books are fiction - I don't need to know the nitty gritty history of every Lord and Lordling in his made up world.  I'm not in training to become dungeon master in the land of Westeros.  I want to hear how the story ends...I don't want a history lesson.  New characters crop up in every chapter and I just can't keep them all straight anymore.  It was giving me a heacache trying to remember them all but now that I've stopped caring it doesn't seem to make much of a difference anyway.<br /><br />To be honest I'm not as invested in the characters as I was back in books one and two.  Most of the characters that Martin did such an excellent job making me love or hate are already dead, save for a handful.<br /><br />SPOILER ALERT:  Joffrey's death at the end of the last book was underwhelming to say the least - and for it all to have been plotted by Little Finger for no other purpose than to keep everyone on their toes makes no sense.  Joff should have died at the hands of Sansa or Arya or someone better than Little Finger.  Now that Joff is dead who are we supposed to hate now?  Jaime'sbecome a conflicted character much like the hound and so we almost root for him now.  Cersei is a bitch but her son just died and all the plotting she does doesn't feel mean spirited enough for me to truly despise her.  And the people that you wanted to win have died - well many of them.  All the characters I do care about: Bran, Arya, Sansa, Daenerys, John, are barely mentioned.  The Onion Knight wasn't an especially memorable character but he at least had integrity and honor and you wanted him to do well, and yet his death in this book is barely a footnote.<br /><br />Martin must know what his fans want to see happen, but it's as if he'd rather be unpredictable and dark than give them what they want.  I mean this isn't a drama for God's sakes, it's a fantasy book. Fine - kill off a character here and there to add a touch of loss and pain for flavor, but don't kill them all off, or make them blind...or a zombie.  And if you're going to kill off the characters we love to hate the most, then there has to be some replacements.<br /><br />I'm willing to accept this book as a \\"transition\\" book if things start getting interesting again in A Dance With Dragons but judging from the poor reviews I think I'm going to be disappointed.  A story, no matter how good the beginning, is (for me at least) judged by its ending.  And so far it's not looking too good.

B0063IH60K|5.0|I must first be honest in that I am not a frequent game player or up on the latest trendy  \\"apps \\". But who can go wrong with this timeless classic?  The animation is slick and the game is easy to play, and there is even a \\"hint\\" mode in the chance you may miss a move. There are also different levels of game play to enjoy for variety and advanced players. You'll enjoy the ease of play and the movement of the cards and rows.  C'mon everyone needs a<br />Cool version of this game at their fingertips.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I LOVE love this app. I have wanted to read through the whole Bible for years, but had not yet done so because I would get discouraged after a while. I am using a reading plan with YouVersion and I LOVE it. I love being able to have different translations at my fingertips. My father is a pastor and I thoroughly enjoy following his sermons right on my Kindle. My best friend has this app on ipad and she recently received an update on hers where you can have a paralleled Bible of whichever 2 translations you choose. I only wish you could do the same for kindle fire. Otherwise, it's perfect!!!

B007Y1ARLA|3.0|After hearing the pre-release single \\"Silenced by the Night\\", which I think is a 4.5 star song, I had high hopes for this album. The last two albums were a terrible departure from the Keane sound and it looked like they would finally return with a vengeance. Not so.<br /><br />I downloaded the extended album and listened to it some five times now and draw the same conclusion each time: it's not the crap of the last two albums, 'Silenced by the night' is the outstanding gem, but the rest of the album runs by without being retained. There is no other impressive or memorable song on this album, just mellow splish-splash and occasional, short impressions where you expect the song to take off, but then nothing happens.<br /><br />This album is surely a departure from the last two excursion into bad music territory and it has grown on me a little, but compared to the first two albums, it is still disappointingly unimpressive. Aside from song #2, songs 3, 4, 7 and 11 are 'good' and would be very promising if we weren't used to albums like Hopes & Fears and Under the Iron Sea...<br /><br />Keep going at it, boys, perhaps next time we're back to full strength.
B005V2EVBQ|2.0|I purchased this case as as gift for my mother to protect her new Kindle Fire.  The front cover can be folded back to be used as a stand for the Fire which is a nice feature, but it isn't anything unique as a large number of cases on the market are designed the same way.  The case itself is on the cheap side, made from inferior materials.  In order to keep the front cover closed, the back of the case has a band of elastic that you fold around the front.  I guess I have been spoiled by other cases I have owned for other electronic devices, but the elastic closure is just a poor design given all the other slick methods I have experienced for closing cases.  All in all this is a below average case.  At $30, there are so many more options out there that are cheaper and better than this case.  I have to recommend passing on this one.
B006PTL1QM|5.0|Historic dramas have become quite popular in recent years, but I would have never imagined someone taking on Freud and Jung, particularly in this way.  It is a story mostly about Carl Jung's tumultuous relationship with Sabina Spielrein, with Freud as a secondary, albeit important figure in the film.  Vincent Cassel almost steals the show as the randy Otto Gross, who essentially pushes Jung into a relationship with Spielrein by encouraging him to follow his emotions.  This is more a dramatic vehicle than it is a study of psychoanalysis, probably more influenced by the method acting of Stanislavsky than it was the so-called \\"dangerous method\\" of Freud. As such, the acting is impeccable.  Viggo Mortensen gives a wonderfully deft touch to Freud, Michael Fassbender captures the repressed emotional state of Jung perfectly, and Keira Knightley gives a stand-out performance as Sabina Spielrein.  David Cronenberg uses letters to give the story an air of verisimilitude, but the story shouldn't be taken as fact.  It is more based on the [[ASIN:0571214851 stage production]] by Christopher Hampton, than it is the [[ASIN:0307950271 book]] by John Kerr.  As the film winds all too quickly to an end on the eve of World War I, it leaves you begging for more.<br /><br />What I liked most is that Cronenberg avoided reducing his historic figures to caricatures.  He reveals them to be the complicated individuals that they were, and that we can't hope to understand them.  What we can do is enjoy this little slice of their lives, as they intersected in early 20th century Europe.  Yet, Cronenberg touches on so many aspects on Freud's and Jung's psychoanalytical views, including dreams, as they sail to America together.  He provides a fascinating portrait of Sabina Spielrein, who was brought to Jung on the verge of complete emotional collapse. Through his calm counseling and eventually through their love affair would become a leading psychoanalyst herself, with the further tutelage of Freud. This was a tumultuous time with the advent not only of modern thinking that would  reshape science and the arts, but also of modern war, which would turn Europe on its end in World War I, alluded to by Jung's dream at the end of the film.  Like any great film, it leaves you wanting to know more about the historic figures involved..

0312641893|5.0|Okay, my friend and I read this for our book report and we both loved it so much! It was an amaZayn book and i would seriously recommend it to everyone. Mostly girls, though. Here's a brief description of Cinder. \\"Cinder\\" is mostly telling a different story of Cinderella. It's in the future in New Bejing and Cinder is a poor cyborg that works as a mechanic and lives with her mean stepmother and sisters. Her mother, Adri, hates her with all her heart and so does the older daughter, Pearl. The other sister, Peony, is very sweet until one day, Cinder and Iko, her android, go to the junkyard with Peony and they find out Peony has got the plague that has been going around Commonwealth. They have to take her away and Adri is so upset by this that she sends Cinder to be a plague volunteer. When you volunteer, thy take you to the doctor and he gives you the plague and tries to cure it and every single time they've tried before, it failed so the volunteers die. Then, a miracle happens. Cinder is immune to letumosis. She is able to go back home but Adri is not happy. Peony had gotten to the 3rd stage of letumosis. Meanwhile, Cinder meets the prince, Kai, at her market and he invites her to the ball. She declines several times and he's sad. His dad, the emperor, dies and so now he's emperor. Then Queen Levana, the queen from Luna (planet) comes down to Earth and tries to be Empress. She's Lunar so they have powers and are terribly afraid of mirrors. They use their powers to brainwash people into thinking they are beautiful but they can't brainwash a mirror. SPOILER ALERT. The reason Cinder is immune is because she finds out she too is Lunar. So is the doctor, Dr. Erland. She's surprised that she can be Cyborg and Lunar at the same time. Then, while fixing Prince Kai's android, she finds that Princess Selene, Queen Levana's niece that she tried to kill, is really still alive and Prince Kai is looking for her. Cinder DOES go to the ball and the Queen sees that she is Lunar and takes her to prison to be killed. Doctor Erland visits her and tells her a really important thing. Cinder is Princess Selene. It was so good and I can't wait to read the next book: Scarlett in 2013. Marissa Meyer did a brilLiam job on this book and I liked it even better than Hunger Games even though I loved that one. I hope Cinder becomes a popular book! <3 xx
0345803485|5.0|I am not much of reader. But after much hype from friends & the media I had to read this book. I 1st went to the local Barnes & Noble to get this book. There was a 2 month waiting list.. First I dont think its MOMMY PORN. This is truly a love story between to flawed people. Christian so sexy. I think every girl deserves a Christian someone to spoil, love her the way he loves Ana.

B006W0QOF2|4.0|Wow. Reading the reviews on Drive is like listening to Republicans and Democrats debate health care - Lots of noise and everybody seems to miss the point.<br /><br />Here's the deal.<br /><br />Drive is an unapologetic riff of pretty much every loner crime revenge story ever made and total line descendant of Michael Mann's Thief from 1980, . So much so, that thanks to the bubbly soundtrack, it seems they might as well have filmed it in 1980 too. Drive is a small-time crime story told with great restraint on characterizations and great explosiveness when it comes to violence. As far as modern influences go, Drive is a sort of crazy hybrid of Paul Verhoeven's Spetters and Paul Thomas Anderson's Hard Eight (Sydney) throw in the last few Cronenberg movies while you're at it.<br /><br />While I don't quite understand the negativity so many haters seem to have for Drive, I understand why some people could be so frustrated by it. Drive is told with Nicolas Winding Refn's European eye for detail and tone. Drive is the definition of character study with a heavy emphasis on STUDY. There is very little quick cutting between camera setups and absolutely zero sitcom-esque axial cut dialog scenes. It is the antithesis of the way most American movies are made. We have been conditioned as a society to watch boxes of talking heads broken up with pointless jabber and largely bloodless violence.  On the other hand, I find it hard to call Drive a masterpiece simply because the director knows how to hold a shot instead of a cut every 6 seconds.<br /><br />Now how you interpret Drive's way to tell a story is largely a question of style and sensibility. Drive is not for every taste and probably not something you'll be in the mood to watch 24/7, but it is very well done when you have the time to invest in it. While it breaks no new ground - and if you think it does, you must have been born yesterday - Drive is a really immersive odyssey of moments and music. It's essentially the cruise through LA crime movie Michael Mann tried to make with the Hit-Man centered Collateral.<br /><br />Drive is better.
0345803507|5.0|Great ending this defiantly tie up all the loose end. great ending  great book great read. I am glade I stuck it out with 2nd book. This was ten time better twilight series.  I do hope the author continues with this series. I need more..
B005VPRG10|3.0|This product had missing pieces. It was quite disappointing for my nephew. It was a birthday gift and he has to wait for the missing parts.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This is a very hot & steamy novel. However, underneath the steamy sex scenes which are in abundance throughout the novel, lies a seriously damaged individual. Mr. Grey needs to inflict pain and dominate women in order to feel pleasure (S&M). Ms. Steele an intelligent and head strong young woman with low self-esteem falls in love with the wrong guy or is she medicine that he needs to heal.<br /><br />I truly enjoyed 50 Shades of Grey and am currently half-way through 50 Shades Darker.
B001EOQWFI|1.0|Thank you all for clarifying the fact that the Digital Copy expires.  I was going to buy this just for the digital copy.  I will not be buying this now.  Disney, please taken note, the expired digital copy issue is totally ridiculous.  I purchased movies in the past and thought I could download them anytime, but wanted to wait until I got a bigger hard drive.  Once I did, I found that four of my movies download rights had expired.  What a waste of money. We paid for it, it should be available anytime.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|Really enjoyed this book( and the next two as well). I wasn't sure that I would enjoy it , given the subject manner but found myself drawn in by the great writing and detail of the atmosphere of the games.It felt like I was beside Katniss throughout her ordeal.The characters are believable and endearing. This was a great read and I was hated to finish although I still had two more to go!

0736092269|5.0|I just got this today and I was amazed by the vast volume of exercises covered. Truly every exercise free weight or machine is covered in this book. I'm a med student and the drawings are on par with many of my textbooks, very impressive. I have several textbooks on exercise such as Essentials of Strength and Conditioning by Baechile and Earle, which is really good for the physio and biology aspect. But the great thing about this book is that it goes into about 100+ exercises you can do, what muscle they use and how to do them. Very satisfied, this is a great addition for any collection of resistance training books.
B007PTJOV0|4.0|it is pretty fun to play.  this game, lep's world, is a lot like the other video game I play on the original nintendo gaminng system that was popular in the early nineties.

0316067598|4.0|LONE SURVIVOR is a captivating if uneven tale of bravery, heroism, and survival.  The content, i.e., the story of the ambush of a four-man team of Navy SEALs in the Korengal Valley by a force of over 50 insurgents and the survival and eventual rescue of the lone survivor, is remarkable, but the book is relatively poorly-written.  The prose is overwrought and often bombastic, the overuse of descriptives is tedious, and much of the reconstructed dialogue is awkward and sounds unnatural.  In this respect, Luttrell was not well-served by his co-author/ghostwriter, Patrick Robinson.  LONE SURVIVOR also starts slow with a lot of fluff and a seemingly interminable C-130 flight from Bahrain to Bagram that spans three chapters.  Thankfully, the story picks up markedly when Luttrell starts recounting his SEAL training and becomes nothing short of gripping once he gets to Operation Redwing.<br /><br />All in all, LONE SURVIVOR is such a compelling story it is able to transcend its technical flaws.  It might not be the most elegant read, but it is most definitely a worthwhile and satisfying one.
B0068EWGMM|5.0|Let me just say that for a dude, SK really knows how to write women. I know his wife Tabby probably helps immensely with his research, so my thanks go out to her, too.<br /><br />This is a story of love, of what happens after you've lost that most important person in your life and they don't lay down quietly, but must have their say. Reminding you in stark detail all that you tried to sweep under the rug and ignore, but with the ultimate goal of getting Lisey to get on with her life. I see myself in Lisey, just like I have seen myself as many of the women that SK has written about, Rose Madder, Susannah Dean and Susan Delgado.<br /><br />How SK reaches in and finds out our secrets and brings them to light just amazes me every time. I don't want to give away any spoilers, because when I read a review, I want to know if something is worth my time, or not. Believe me, this audio book is time well spent. Now a word about Mare Willingham's reading.<br /><br />Fabulous!!!! I have listened to many books Mare has read over the years and this one is my favorite. She had tears running down my face more than once because her expression of the tale was so poignant. It was almost like Mare was telling the story of her own life and had all the richness and emotion of things remembered to go along with it.<br /><br />To sum up, this novel is just a delight and full of all things you expect from SK and more. Try it you'll really like it!
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|Fun game for a rainy day and to bide away some time.  Continued missions make it challenging and I would recommend this app to others.
0545259088|4.0|** POSSIBLE SPOILERS IF YOU AREN'T CAUGHT UP TO THIS BOOk **<br /><br />This book held the same standard of the first two in the series. The electric chemistry between grace and her wolf Sam, then same in this book, but Grace as the wolf and  sam waiting for warmer weather. These two would make a nonbeliever of love, fate, destiny a true believer (granted an open mind and active imagination, like me). I'm an adult and when I read the first book I was blown away by the way the author wrote the novel. She made the pages practically dripping with emotion,, love, losses and life (in the ya paranormal, but still).. I was thoroughly impressed. I found the third book on vine (thank you!) But had to read linger(book 2) to catch up first, sorry for the delay.<br /><br />This author has rare, fanstastic style of writing. Very vivid, but not over descriptive, relatable characters in their personalities, actions and real world situations/problems. Great imagination, I hope to read more of Miss Maggie S.<br /><br />I was throughly engrossed in this story till the end, not a satisfying ending for any  trilogy of books. Forever has a finality and an infinity to it by definition. If there won't be a 4th book many adoring fans will be disappointed, like me.
B002BU0DPE|3.0|I thought I finally found what I was looking for, reasonably priced headphones that allowed me the versatility to use as a PC headset for skype calls and a gaming headset (PS3). For the most part that is what I got except for the build quality really stinks. every slight jostle of the control box sends annoying buzzing through the headset. Any amount of adjustment to volume or graze of the roller would pop me from stereo to mono and back again...and sometimes drop altogether until I find the \\"sweet spot.\\" When listening to the \\"white noise\\" (no output from PC/PS3) its not the usual white noise that I know is always going to be there, instead its a weird sound that cannot be described because I lack the vocabulary.<br /><br />Is it a good product? YES<br />Should you buy it? SURE<br /><br />Isolated incident? maybe.<br />This did happen to my friend's set (same model)...twice. Luckily he bought it at best buy even though it cost a bit more he got the warranty which came in handy for the first one. After the second on did the same he just bought a PS3 brand bluetooth and didnt bother anymore.<br /><br />You would think with the amount of money the customer is spending, and a name to uphold the quality would be better or at least the QC dept. Unfortunately I am too invested in it already as I have bough the EarForce DSS.<br /><br />I got a really crummy unit I guess.
B007ZRZF8I|2.0|there are lots of other games like this for free. move along and save your money. don't believe the hype of the other dubious reviews.
0345803485|1.0|There are many other reviews that talk about this book at length, so I'll just keep it short and say that I struggled to finish it because it's so poorly written and edited. Very repetitive, unrealistic, annoying and immature characters, and I didn't think the sex was all that hot either (spoiler alert: there is a scene involving a tampon which I though was the least \\"hot\\" thing I could imagine). Very disappointing - I have a hard time understanding how people love it!
B004K4IZ3G|5.0|Despite what you think of the movie, this disc delivers! The movie has amazing audio quality. If you have a decent system, you won't be disappointed. First of all the music is spot on. It is the right mix of orchestral and electronic. It gives a very immersive feeling. The action is well represented and it using the surround speakers correctly. By the way, your sub will probably get quite a work out as well<br /><br />The picture is great as well. Most scenes are gorgeous and the color and art direction really are worth watching the movie just to experiece. The movie switches between 35mm and 70mm shots and it is very impressive when the picture goes full screen like that, but don't worry, it is not distracting.<br /><br />Overall the movie I thought was very enjoyable. Some people tend not to like it, but I liked it enough to watch it twice in two days. Maybe it was just because of the soundtrack...

B00005QGAT|5.0|And it was good.  I'd heard the hits from the album and was especially taken with She's out of my life.  I thought 'the kid has grown'.  Quincy Jones and Michael make a very safe yet bubbling over with potential album.  Michael was budding into quite the songwriter on through his untimely passing.  His understanding in mastering disco and turning it into pure funk and soul.  I like Thriller, but this one remains my favorite.  This is an evolutionary record and it should be in everyone's collection just because.

0345803485|5.0|After reading the Fifty Shades trilogy (my first erotica novel), and suffering deep depression that it was over LOL, I wanted another book and I wanted to compare this book to another BDSM erotica to see what made this one go viral / how it compared to others.  I chose another book on amazon via 'if you like 50 shades, you might like...' . The book, Under Order (Heather's Journey) by Sadey Quinn,  I chose had 11 reviewers giving it and average of  4.5/5 so I gave it a try.<br /><br />uggh!<br /><br />Now I know why Fifty went viral.<br /><br />Fifty Shades:<br />-You love and root for the characters to be together. They are MADLY in love eventually.<br />- I forgave the writing when it was repetitive or cheesie / cliche.  ex. when he refers to her genitalia as 'her sex', 'holy crap', ect.<br />- After testing the waters and realizing that she doesn't want to be his submissive, Ana doesn't end up submitting the way Christian initially wants her too.  Eventually, he opts for a non-dominating \\"vanilla\\" relationship with her as they fall madly in love. So after that, I didn't feel like it was demeaning but saw it as consenting, loving adults role playing / adding kink in the bedroom.<br />- you feel like she's taking this damaged, tormented guy and because they were in love, fixing him.  That part reminded me of Twilight.<br />- I like that apparently unlike most erotica books, Fifty Shades has a non-sexual / non-cheesy cover: no hot, half-naked man or woman.<br /><br />vs<br /><br />other erotica book - Under Order (Heather's Journey) by Sadey Quinn:<br />- I thought the woman was an idiot for agreeing to the demeaning BDSM sex acts and humiliations that her 'lover' put her through. I thought the guy was a huge turn off because of it.  I think that the reader was supposed to like them but failed at making us like them.<br />- the writing was again cheesie but also so crass that it made me cringe (not sexy). ex. 'my wet c**t', 'I fingered my dripping wet p***y', etc<br/>- I wouldn't call this a love story despite the characters long relationship<br />- This book would only appeal to someone that is in to BDSM on the extreme end of the spectrum.

B007IX383I|5.0|I thought it would be impossible to top \\"We're Here Because We're Here\\". I was wrong. I've been listening to this CD every day since I got it and dare I say, it's probably my favorite disc of all time. Flawless from beginning to end. Every track is amazing, with my favorite probably being the beautiful and emotional closing track. Vincent's vocals get better with each release and they mix in Lee's vocals perfectly throughout the disc. Of course, all the music is stunning too. I really wish I could see this band live, and I would love to get a DVD of \\"We're Here\\" and \\"Weather Systems\\" performed in their entirety. I can't wait for their next release. I don't know if it's possible to top this one, but with Anathema anything is possible.

Federal Reserve Bank needs to be done away with. They are just legalized thieves. Banks get bailed out! But they do not pay back the tax payers back with interest, yet we are expected to keep paying them interest.<br />Unbelievable how they removed the ceilings on Leveraging. They are basically printing money creating it out of thin air.<br /><br />Lobbyists helping the government to write the rules, how stupid is that? Watch the movie \\"The Corporation\\" also and you will understand why when the senator asks corporate bank bosses if they have a conflict of interest? They say No! Corporations only purpose is to make money to serve shareholders. Supreme Court dictated this.<br /><br />Neither party is serving us.<br />We need to clean all the scum out and start over.

0345803485|5.0|I haven't read a book since high school and even that was mandatory. Then I heard about this book so I thought I would check out my local book store to see if it really was any good. I bought a paperback copy of book one and was unable to put it down. I stayed up that night and by the next day I had finished book one. I kindled the other 2 books and have read the series twice over. There is. My review if your looking to get involved...<br />The story is about a beautiful sensible girl who finds herself strangely attracted to this extremely wealthy businessman. They seem to e opposites in everyday and I would even call there reaction to each other a magnetism. He tries to push her away but can't seem to get enough of her. This is their story. It is extremely graphic and sometimes I found myself disturbed. If you can make it through this book you will absolutely love they second.<br />Book 1- about a lot of sex<br />Book 2- about romance<br />Book 3- about drama<br />I don't know how they are going to make it a movie but if they do they better not cast those twilight freaks or I am out.
B0058YPL66|5.0|By the end of season One, ABC was already touting \\"Once Upon a Time\\" as the best new drama on television and small wonder given that it breaks away from the crime drama rut and wonder of wonders; no sleaze, excessive violence or profanity to be found, possibly one of the most family-friendly dramas that television has seen in years. What... is a creatively enjoyable story with likeable characters, great FX and gorgeous sets still sufficient to rate as exceptional adult entertainment?<br /><br />This brilliant fantasy drama continues to gain momentum with each episode as you are drawn into a world where classic fairy tale characters are brought to life after having been exiled to our world via a wicked queen's evil spell and all memories of their previous lives have been erased. Snow White and Prince Charming are the most obvious main characters but there are also dwarves, fairies, trolls and other great characters like Red Riding Hood, Gepetto & Pinocchio, The Mad Hatter and many more along with some nasty villains like Rumplestiltskin and of course the Evil Queen herself. In spite of the fantasy setting, it's immediately apparent from the cast's performance that this is a program which takes itself seriously resulting in a surprisingly believable narrative. Also, \\"Once Upon\\" plays a little like a detective show in that various clues are revealed in each episode all pointing to their previous lives, and although this is a serial, many of the episodes are just great stand-alone, fairy-tale based stories<br /><br />Now if you're like me and just couldn't get into \\"Lost\\" please don't be put off by the fact that \\"Once Upon\\" has some of the same writers because the style of this series doesn't resemble that one at all. In fact it doesn't resemble anything on the big three networks, which is probably one of the main reasons I was so taken with it; i.e. utter amazement at something so remarkably nonconforming.<br /><br />I'm not gonna review each episode because I dislike spoilers and you can easily wiki summaries of each but I will say that \\"Desperate Souls\\" is a very moving tale featuring my favorite character Mr. Gold, \\"Skin Deep\\" is an excellent take on the Beauty & the Beast theme, \\"Dreamy\\" features an awesome dual-theme featuring everyone's favorite dwarf, \\"Red Handed\\" is one of the most creative werewolf stories I've seen in years, \\"Hat Trick\\" is visually gorgeous and introduces the existence of other fantasy worlds and finally in \\"A Land Without Magic\\"...way to go ABC for giving us such a ridiculously cool dragon!<br /><br />As a long-time fan of TV fantasy and sci-fi series (good ones being few and far between) I can honestly say that this is one of the best and reminds me a little of the Harry Potter films in that it is very character driven and I found myself eagerly anticipating each Sunday evening to see what new turn of events the next episode would bring; and of course with the release of season one I can now sit and veg for hours on end watching one of my fav new shows.<br /><br />With 22 fabulous episodes packed into this DVD set (having a hard time thinking of a really lame one) prepare to become a permanent fan of the show, harboring a secret desire to run away to Storybrooke. :o)spoilers and you can easily wiki summaries of each but I will say that \\"Desperate Souls\\" is a very moving tale featuring my favorite character Mr. Gold, \\"Skin Deep\\" is an excellent take on the Beauty & the Beast theme, \\"Dreamy\\" features an awesome dual-theme featuring everyone's favorite dwarf, \\"Red Handed\\" is one of the most creative werewolf stories I've seen in years, \\"Hat Trick\\" is visually gorgeous and introduces the existence of other fantasy worlds and finally in \\"A Land Without Magic\\"...way to go ABC for giving us such a ridiculously cool dragon!<br /><br />As a long-time fan of TV fantasy and sci-fi series (good ones being few and far between) I can honestly say that this is one of the best and reminds me a little of the Harry Potter films in that it is very character driven and I found myself eagerly anticipating each Sunday evening to see what new turn of events the next episode would bring; and of course with the release of season one I can now sit and veg for hours on end watching one of my fav new shows.<br /><br />With 22 fabulous episodes packed into this DVD set (having a hard time thinking of a really lame one) prepare to become a permanent fan of the show, harboring a secret desire to run away to Storybrooke. :o)
0439023513|2.0|*Spoiler Warning*<br /><br />I just got finished writing the series, and all I can say is, this was the worst book(s) I have ever read.<br /><br />For starters, the writing is simply poor.  The grammar, sentence structure, punctuation, are abominable!  I have never seen such poor writing in a book before, and I wonder how the editors let it slide.  One can argue \\"style,\\" of course, but even if the \\"sentences\\" were supposed to flow like her thoughts, rather than being complete sentences, the writing style, overall, is terrible.<br /><br />The story itself, is interesting.  And I have to admit, in books 1 and 2, there were definitely large sections where I couldn't put it down.  Collins does know how to do cliffhangers well.  But, as the story progresses, it just gets worse and worse.<br />Katniss's character deteriorates and is pretty much destroyed by the end of the series - to the point where she is willing to kill at the drop of a hat, and has nothing left but revenge and hatred.  Instead of becoming a stronger character through her trials, she becomes pretty much a mental case with revenge as her only motivating factor.  IMO, heroes and heroines aren't motivated by revenge, but by a desire for good.  (You can't even argue that a person who went through all this trauma would be destroyed, because the whole book is fanatical and unrealistic on many levels.  However, Collins makes most of her characters disparaging, revengeful, war-hungry, cynical, and self-seeking. The truly \\"good\\" characters in the book pretty much all die!<br /><br />Collins is right about one thing, that both sides were playing games.  But to write a book where no one is wanting a better world or believes there can be a better world, leaves on feeling like the book was pointless.  All hope dwindles the more you read the book.  That's a very negative look on life, and the epilogue maybe redeems it ever so slightly, but not nearly enough, and it even leaves room that terror might return.<br /><br/>While I think that there were elements of the story that were good, the book lacks much in development of characters and ideas.  The idea for the story is rather unique and interesting, and there were many parts I liked, but not enough to warrant me recommending this book to anyone.

0670023329|5.0|After reading the first few pages, I was hooked. I think this book grasps you because the subject matter is so foreign and undocumented. The injustices that occur in N. Korea are terrifying to read. You find yourself trying to make sense of it all and you just can't seem to. It's only 200 pags and a very quick, yet painful read. You definitely feel the character's pain and you find yourself making funny faces, wincing and shaking your head while reading. Highly recommended.

B005XI94HY|4.0|Powerful, intense, and addictive. One or two songs seem like they might have taken a different life on a more low-key album.  But, there are some epic songs on this album... Shake It Out, All This and Heaven Too, Breaking Down, Leave My Body.  Love it.
B004SYP5WC|5.0|This is a great little reminder app to keep all your bills in line.  I have been using it a few months now and is nice to have the pop up reminder that I have a bill to pay.<br /><br />To make it easier for me, I have averaged the amounts due each month. The only thing I have not found (or figured out) yet is if there is a way to update only the current reminder to the actual amount due.<br /><br />But overall I really find the app helpful.
B006ZDU7QI|2.0|To be fair, I was really hyped for the album after hearing \\"somebody that I used to know\\".  I was generally disappointed with the rest of the album.<br /><br />Update: changing this to 2 stars (from 3).

0449011917|1.0|I am four discs into the audiobook, and I am going to try and return it as soon as i'm done with this review.  It is AWFUL.  The front and back of the box, as well as the description on amazon, list Roy Dotrice as the narrator.  It is NOT.  The voice sounds somewhat similar, but all the character voices are wrong.  All the names are pronounced differently, sometimes pronounced different ways just sentences apart.  Aeron Damphair is pronounced \\"damn-fair\\".  It's \\"damp hair\\"!  Damp hair, because he's always getting wet, so his hair is damp......GAH!!  Jon Snow sounds like Sherlock Holmes, yet his sister Arya sounds like Dannan the Duck from Jakers.  The whole thing sounds like a cold read with no rehearsal.  I would be embarrassed to present work this shoddy.<br /><br />I haven't posted reviews for the first three audiobooks in the series yet, but they are STELLAR.  They made my daily commute a joy for months.  Both the stories and Roy Dotrice are wonderful.
B0055SWM08|5.0|This is a great game, entertaining, has many levels to get thru.  It has a very good and quick interface on my HTC Wildfire S.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|I hsve read almost every book Baldacci has written.  This one has to be one of the very best to date.  I had a hard time putting it down.  Great plot and strong characters. Mr. Baldacci at his best.
B004S82OAE|5.0|A very well written book with tons of pretty detailed knowledge.  I have not taken the exam yet, but I have finished reading the book.  I have no doubt that I will know everything required to pass the CCNA exam by reading this book<br /><br />It can occasionally be dull, but the author does a pretty good job of keeping it interesting/amusing.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|With so many women loving this book, it proves a couple of points. One, women need to read more literature to know what good writing is, and two someone is going to wake up and start a magazine, without pictures, along the lines of Penthouse's \\"Forum\\" just for the ladies.<br />The book is drivel really. Kind of a Harlequin Romance with graphic sexual detail, much of it sadistic.<br />I give the author credit, she SAW the \\"Twilight\\" movie, THEN read the books, and realized she could tailor it to grown women. Instead of teenage porn-light, she could write a full on grown woman porn trilogy.<br />She got rich doing it!!<br />There seems to be defined sides on the love it/hate it. If you love literature and read daily (not Harlequin romances) then you probably aren't going to like it. If you are always telling others you \\"don't have time to read\\" you will just love it.<br />Sorry, I love to read actual fiction and non-fiction,  and this is just nonsense.<br />But, maybe it will get more women reading again, and that can't be bad!<br /><br />The story is preposterous,  disturbing on many levels, and not well written at all.<br />Get ready to want to vomit when you hear \\"inner goddess\\" or see a person biting their lip, ever again!<br />Bravo to E.L. James though, she saw a market and took advantage of it!!
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|[[ASIN:0545265355 The Hunger Games Trilogy Boxed Set]]A few weeks after seeing the movie, I read the kindle version in 2.5 days -- couldn't put it down.  Very much liked Suzanne Collins' style of writing and found the story to be good food for thought.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|pretty good overall if you can look past the ads.  its free so I'm sure they are making money.  it seems like a lot of hoops to jump through for free gaming
B007DJUO8O|2.0|I won't get too much into details here, but I will say I've been a fan of both Wilson and Akerfeldt since 2002 and feel that I know their music pretty well.  STORM CORROSION is the biggest disappointment to come from either of these brilliant musicians and will go down as their most forgettable album.<br /><br />If you're going to do a unique collaboration, then really do something that brings people to a high plateau instead of putting them to sleep.  It's an album that didn't move me, which is surprising because I'm such a big fan.<br /><br />Such a lost opportunity to have done something unique.
B005B19UPE|1.0|I'm still surprised when I read a book about the atrocities of World War II that can make the horrors people suffered during that time seem dull.<br /><br />The storyline itself is interesting, unfortunately this author chose to place a majority of her focus on the contemporary plot line with an unlikeable protagonist.<br /><br />After reading so many rave reviews about this book I was really looking forward to reading it and even considered it as a book club selection. I am so glad we did not choose this as a book club book, if we had I think it would have launched to the top ten worst written books we've read so far.<br /><br />The dialogue was awful, the relationships were not at all realistic and the writing was completely adolescent. The entire book felt like it was written for a Juvenile or Young Adult audience, (with the exception of the use of swear words).<br /><br />This is another one of those books that I'm amazed was ever published. I wondered what the editor was thinking letting the author run away with the dull and predictable life of the contemporary character and not delving into the life of Sarah, the interesting character, the character that everyone who picks up this book wants to read about.

B00068TJM6|5.0|I bought this watch to replace a 1987 Seiko chronograph.  At first I was a bit leery of the \\"gray market\\" warranty, but I came to feel it was a good balance with the reduced price.<br /><br />This watch keeps very good time.  Since I bought it in February 2012, it's been off an average of +-1.5 seconds a month.  To achieve that level of accuracy, you have to do something not mentioned in the truly terrible manual -- lock down the crown and the pushers. (Unlocked, the watch time seems to drift, gaining as much as +15 seconds a day the first three days I had it.  I was concerned that I'd have to send it back.)<br /><br />Once you have the watch locked down (typically, I wear the watch with pushers and crown locked), the alarm will be so soft as to be useless (and having a 12-hour alarm rather than a 24-hour one is really annoying).  I re-purposed the alarm dial to show a second time zone (GMT) -- ANOTHER feature not mentioned in the manual.<br /><br />I wish the manual was better, to show all the features I had to find out about by haunting the various watch boards.<br /><br />It's a beautiful watch.  The dials are all accurate and sharp, contrast is good, nicely visible in low light.  Lume holds up pretty well (most of the night (6 hours I'd guess, though I haven't sat down and timed it), and gradually fades.  Each hand of the chronometer returns exactly where it started -- and, yes, I DO know how to offset them from zero if I want to.<br /><br />I especially like the vibrant yellow chrono second hand.  I volunteer as a paramedic, and I needed a vivid sweep second hand for timing pulses, respirations, and cardiac functions.  It's also a BIG watch, and I like that as well.<br /><br />All in all, this SNA411 from Amazon is a good deal if you're looking for a pilot chronometer at a reasonable price.  Don't wait any more.  Just buy it.  You'll be glad you took the plunge.  I am TOTALLY satisfied with this watch.

B001KQEA5E|5.0|What can you say, this was the big Snoop Dog album that everyone wanted.  Did I mention that was in high school and the cool part is, the music is still good.  I hadn't listened to it in several years and after downloading it.  I forgot how good it really was.  There is some good stuff here, the kind of music you will be humming throughout the day.  Whether you are a fan of old school rap, hip hop, rock, r&b, or any other style, this is good stuff.  It's just plain and simple \\"Classic\\"
B007LYB0PC|5.0|This album exceeded all of my expectations. Every song on here is really quite good, some even rivaling prime White Stripes material. The vinyl edition is excellent. The pressing is flawless, and it comes with the mp3 download code and big lyric sheet. What impresses me most with this album, though, is the production. Amid a time when most rock recordings are compressed beyond belief, Blunderbuss is an extremely dynamic record, with no unnecessary loudness. A good start to White's solo career.
1594744769|5.0|willysbookreviews.blogspot.com<br /><br />One night, an avid reader was searching through Amazon and Barnes and Noble in search for a very creepy/disturbing novel.  That same night, I found Miss Peregrines Home For Peculiar Children.  At first glance, i thought, Whoa she's levitating, that's pretty creepy, \\"peculiar\\" also creepy!  It seemed like it wasn't a very known book so I didn't do much other than add to my cart and wait for some money to come along so I can purchase.<br /><br />Luckily, a week later at Target, my mother gave me $10 dollars for a book (of course I had to beg her continuously for half an hour, but still).  I got the book and ran to checkout.<br /><br />Now, on to the review!<br /><br />I LOVED IT!<br /><br />The entire novel was unique.  The words flowed, and I could relate to the main character: a very sarcastic, non caring, male adolescence.  That is why I actually liked him despite of his uncaring attitude.  The story was very creepy from the third page.  As you read, you are confronted by some very \\"peculiar\\" photographs of some VERY \\"peculiar\\" children.  I could not sleep at night if I saw one of those photographs.  They will haunt you in your sleep.<br /><br />This novel is very adventurous.  I cannot say much more without wanted to give out loads of information that will spoil the book for you.  All I can say, however, is that you should not wait to read this book.  Read it now.<br /><br />Just a few days ago, I found out there will be an entire series, a trilogy.  We get to meet the peculiar children again!<br /><br />Please visit my book blog,<br />willysbookreviews.blogspot.com

0439023521|5.0|willysbookreviews.blogspot.com<br /><br />This book is AMAZING!  Suzanne Collins blew me away with her masterpiece.  Throughout this book I was awestruck (my face looked like this :O), the character development was phenomenal.  She outdid herself.  I found one flaw, and only one:<br />1) Katniss Everdeen (our heroine) speaks of food every two pages!<br /><br />On the upside, Suzanne end every chapter with a cliff hanger.  You might think, when I finish this chapter I shall go to sleep, ha!  I can assure that you will not go to sleep until you finish the book or your eyes give out.  Katniss is a very interesting heroine, I think.  She doesn't care about what she has to do in order to protect herself and her family.  She is a realist.  She is loving.  And she is strong.<br /><br />If When you read this book you will definitely want to go get your copy of Catching Fire.  Then of course Mockingjay.<br /><br />I have read this book three times now!<br /><br />Please visit my book blog,<br />willysbookreviews.blogspot.com

It had one of the most breathtaking twists found in a series so far.  Going back into Katniss Everdeen's mind was great.  I loved her  opinions and thoughts of everything that was going on throughout her new life.

I had waited an entire year before reading it  and-I'm sorry to say-I expected better.  This book was great at first, explaining the ending to Catching Fire. It was awesome but slowly became sluggish to read and somewhat boring.  My expectations were for it-considering it was the last of the trilogy-would have been the best of all, but I was proven wrong.  I didn't want to believe that though, so I kept on reading.  Towards the end it got better, and something CRAZY happens.  I did not expect it at all!  It was so sad.<br /><br />Sadly this book was the worst of the three, but still enjoyable.<br /><br />Please visit my book blog,<br />willysbookreviews.blogspot.com

0307719219|5.0|History is not destiny.<br /><br />So say Why Nations Fail authors Daron Acemoglu (Economics Professor at MIT and 2005 John Bates Clark Medal recipient) and James Robinson (Harvard political science and economics professor).<br /><br />According to Acemoglu and Robinson what answers the question of why nations fail is one of political policy, to wit: are your nation's political economic institutions extractive or inclusive? By extractive the authors point out countries like North Korea or many of the former British colonies (both before and after independence). By inclusive the authors point out countries like North Korea and other nations created inclusive economic institutions that enforced property rights, created a level playing field and encouraged investments in new technologies and skills.<br /><br />As Acemoglu and Robinson point out understanding why nations fail often requires a review of recent and not so recent history that is nation specific and focused on whether its particular history supported inclusiveness or suffered exclusiveness.<br /><br />As part of advancing their thesis, the authors specifically refute other theses. One of these refuted theses is that geography is destiny. Readers familiar with Jared Diamond's books Guns, Germs and Steel and Collapse may recognize the argument that countries from certain climates were destined for predominance over their less ideally located peers (a sort of economic \\"location, location, location\\" theory). Acemoglu and Robinson pour water on this theory by examing the case history of Korea which was united until just after World War II. Despite a common shared geographic, linguistic and cultural history up to that point, \\"somehow\\" South Koreans now outearn their northern neighbors at a rate of 400 to 1.<br /><br />Another these the authors dispute is culture which is also addressed by the Korean example and less significantly perhaps by the case history of Nogales Arizona/Nogales Sonora (the city is bisected by the Mexican US border). As with Korea Nogales had a common history up until it was taken over during the Gadsen purchase. As with Korea standard of living is radically different based not on culture but rather arbitrary border placement.<br /><br />Finally the authors dispute the ignorance hypothesis. This one says that some leaders simply don't know how to make their countries wealthy. Here again, an examination of the personal wealth and living standards of the Communist Party elite in North Korea fail to show any unfamiliarity with how to acquire money. Rather, the oppressive conditions in that country testify to the intensity of the desire on the part of Korea's rulers to maintain that standard of living exclusively for themselves even at the cost of the extreme suffering of their people.<br /><br />More than refuting other theories, however, the authors take readers on a world wind tour of global history from the perspective of economic inclusive. From my perspective whether you ultimately agree with the rest of what they say, this tour itself is alone worth the price of this book.<br /><br />But in this case, it's likely the authors are actually making a compelling case because it also happens to be the right one. From the axial age forward, every step towards a greater standard of living has always seemed to follow in the wake of a greater respect for the rights of the many...not total inclusiveness perhaps but greater inclusiveness to be sure. As Acemoglu and Robinson alluded there are indeed many details to be filled in but as a start I think this book makes for both provocative reading and cutting edge economics and political science.by the Mexican US border).

B007EC6FIS|5.0|As a huge fan of their first, highly memorable timeless masterpiece '5 star' release, who had 'given up' on them with their subsequent offerings, I was pleasantly surprised with 'Strangeland'.  I have the first 3 Keane releases, and didn't really enjoy their work following the stellar 'Hopes And Fears'.  There were some interesting moments, but Keane seemed to be treading ground that they were not good at, and the music sounded a bit strained and displeasing.  It's great to hear them getting back to their melodic and lush roots, which is what they do best, and have garnered them world acclaim.  The well crafted songs on 'Strangeland' are beautiful and majestic, with the band back to full form.  I give this 4.5 stars.  Welcome back guys!

0515142247|4.0|Lee Child spins a terrific yarn that is entertaining, fast-paced and spiced with enough character delineation to keep modern readers interested. Die Trying is a rollercoaster of a suspense novel and if the reader has to work a little harder in spots to buy the action, the pace will sustain.<br /><br />Jack Reacher is ex-army, ex-military police. He was a decorated, upstanding officer who slipped through the downsizing cracks of the peace-time military establishment. Reacher is going no place fast now he's in civvies, but that isn't to imply he's become a bum, far from it. Because of his long service career and extensive overseas assignments, Reacher is taking his time and exploring civilian options. He's becoming acquainted with his country. That puts him in sudden jeopardy.<br /><br />In the wrong place at the wrong time, he's kidnapped with an FBI agent named Holly Johnson. In a fine twist, Reacher and the reader begin to suspect some unseen dimensions to this woman. That thread carries through for a good part of the novel and adds interesting dimensions to the main plot.<br /><br />In some fascinating ways, Jack Reacher is a throwback to the hard-bitten, stalwart, stand-up heroes of an earlier time. If he can maintain the pace and the level of good quality writing readers will find here, his scarred hero will live a long and fruitful life.

B001QTXM5Y|1.0|This is probably the worst movie I've ever suffered through.  Pure putrid cinematic trash.  The master copy of this movie should be burned and all copies of it should be collected up and destroyed to rid the world of this garbage.  Yes, it is that bad.  Story?  There is no story.  First it was a murder mystery, then it was about a doomsday clock and possible nuclear war, then it was about the world's richest man, then it was a \\"superhero origins\\" story, then it was a love story, then for 5 minutes it was a superhero movie, then it was a softcore sex movie with superheroes having graphic sex on a flying ship, then it was... well, NOTHING.  It was always about nothing.  The action scenes?  Horrible!  Poorly choreographed, poorly shot, poorly edited.  Just atrociously bad and also filled with cringe-worthy and unnecessary blood, bone-breaking and gore.  Not exciting or fun to watch at all.  The soundtrack/music?  Probably the worst in movie history.  Your brain will go numb from the stupidity of the music selection and matching of music to scenes in this so-called movie.  The cinematography?  Horrific.  Again, just totally stupid and lame uses of slow motion and dumb gimmicky camera work.  The direction?  The director, Zack Snyder, is the WORST director in the world hands down.  This guy ruins every single movie he gets his hands on.  This guy shouldn't be directing Saturday morning cartoons let alone major motion pictures.  He's beyond horrible!!!  He has no talents for directing movies at all.  The actors?  All no name actors.  I didn't recognize any of them.  I'm guessing every big name actor in Hollywood heard Zack Snyder was directing the movie and turned it down because they all know what a bad director he is so the producers had to cast no name actors in the movie.  Oh, and the kicker, yeah, one of the \\"heroes\\" in this movie... ?  Shoots and kills a pregnant girl on purpose and then later viciously beats another girl and tries to rape her.  Plus there's a sceneof a little murdered girl's body being torn apart by dogs and another extremely graphic scene of a man's arms being cut off.  Yeah, great movie, Zack Snyder.  Thanks for adding another one of your horrible movies to the growing pile of crappy movies in the world.  You and director of \\"The Green Hornet\\" should get together and start your own club--The Worst Directors in the World Club.  That's one thing you would be good at.  Being the President of that club.  Avoid this putrefied-garbage-disguised-as-a-movie at all costs!!!
B000JJS8TM|1.0|This album is a complete waste of space and does not deserve to have been made.  I am not going to fight and try and prove just how much I love the Beatles...  Too many of us have made such statements to show to our fellow readers that our review is objective and all that jazz...  Let's just say that this album is the final nail in the Beatles' coffin...  Making sounds with prerecorded music, so that the masses can watch a bunch of talented - but incredibly uninspired - acrobats do pirouettes to this sterile and pathetic muzak, may convince some of us that there is a transcended value to all of this...  Don't be fooled!!!  There isn't!!!  This album is total crap and bringing life to dead matter just doesn't make it any better...  Frankenstein failed and so do these people...

They are so good I had to get both of them from Amazon and I've watched both several times already since they arrived. If you like fun races you'll really enjoy this movie.

B007EC6FIS|5.0|This is the album I've been waiting for, for 4 years or so. I almost didn't purchase it after reading some of the early reviews, I am so glad I did. Just because a band returns to an earlier sound it doesn't mean they aren't growing and changing. As evidenced by the addition of the 4th guitar playing mate. This gives the band the opportunity to back off the piano driven sound and bring in more guitar work.These are the most complex lyrics Tim has written and the growth in musicality is present throughout the CD. They have done the impossible, they have matured while preserving that Keane magic. Great work fellows.

It sucked me in and kept me there.<br /><br />You're let further into Christian's dark, emotional, & at times sinister world. And it makes your heart weep for him. But his choosing to not stay in this dark place. The fact that he is not so jaded or closed off, that he can't recognize peace. And the light that is present in the love that he has for Ana, and she for him, will have your heart soaring for him as well. For them both.<br /><br />This one is even more suspenseful than book 1. Alot more darker in certain areas. But all in love a great great love story. I love how everything goes a bit deeper, while keeping you very much intrigued with the lives of Ana and Christian and all that is occuring between and around them. If you loved book 1 trust me, you will definitely love book 2.<br /><br />I highly recommend this read. This trilogy.<br />I'm off to begin book 3.
0802473164|5.0|My husband and I did a bunch of love language quizzes on our first date.  It was great because we were able to determine what we both liked and responded to.  I think everyone should read the Love Languages books.  It will help you understand what makes people tick so you can relate to them better.
0393080269|4.0|Breakout Nations is an overview of how many of the major emerging markets are currently faring.  It discusses China, India, Brazil, Mexico, Russia, Poland, Czech Republic, Hungary, Bulgaria, Turkey, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Malaysia, Taiwan, Korea, Vietna, South Africa and includes a discussion of Africa as well.  Even more countries are covered but the above slightly more comprehensively with special chaperts dedicated to China, India, Brazil, Mexico, Russia and Turkey.  The author is responsible for investing in emerging markets for Morgan Stanley and is well positioned to give a narrative on most of EM.  The commentary is well thought out and the author does well to poke holes in some common misconceptions.  It is important to remember though that the author's perspectives are just his own beliefs about the future, most of what he writes can be debated vigorously.  I enjoyed reading the overviews as the author is concise and articulate, but this is but one of many perspectives and the author does not go into details to defend his views.<br /><br />Being responsible for important asset allocation at a major wealth management firm naturally means the author will have to take views and make decisions based on their beliefs and given their knowledge.  The author believes that much is at risk in Brazil, India, China, Mexico and Russia.  For him, he favours Korea which has managed to move very much into the category of innovative countries focusing on consumer demand, which the author makes the point of showing that consumer goods is where the long term growth is.  He focuses on distribution of wealth, where retained profits are being invested, what the governments are doing and the nature of their trade and reform agendas.  These commentaries are very straightforward to read and much information is included in a concise fashion.  The author discusses what has been working for economies and spends time considering what might go wrong for them in the future.<br /><br />Despite enjoying much of what was written, there is a fair amount of opinion that is marketed as fact and there are many points he makes that the author's own commentary discredit.  In particular the author has been making the argument that easy monerary policy is just fuelling speculative commodity demand and has been very detrimental in the recovery.  That is speculation, not fact and there is no counterfactual we can point to.  Commodity speculation might have been increasing but there has been fundamental demand growth in commodities due to Chinas focus on FAI growth.  Monetary policy no doubt can impact the price but the degree is not in the least bit obvious.  Another example of reasoning the can be discredited is the observation that growth in post war periods is higher than average (this is obvious isnt it?) and then makes the comment that markets dont price that growth aspect properly, several pages later there is another statement concerning the probability a nation goes back to war having recently emerged as being 40%.  That would explain why people find if hard to buy equity in countries recently emerging from war wouldnt it?  The author's narratives are fun to read and he debunks much that people talk about when it comes to emerging markets.  The economic commentary is suspect and much of what the author states with confidence is just his opinion for which many with much evidence strongly disagree.  Consider the example of Turkey, a country the author very much is a fan of which has recently been the target of the economist (after this publication) as well as the subject of a comprehensive GS piece in which on robust statistical measures it has significant risks or consider Korea which has large demographic issues which it faces and high personal debt levels which the author casually mentions.  Which is right, who knows, but the authors views are definitely not unbiased and one should not invest in his favorites without doing more research.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|This is poorly written, adolescent style Twilight fan faction. If you want a meaty erotic escape that fascinates, enlightens, excites and emboldens with actual literary value, don't waste your time on Fifty Shades. Head straight for Story of O.
B005EGXTEE|4.0|I read this book to determine whether it was as violent and gruesome as the shorts and film previews indicated. I was concerned about young readers being subjected to more violence and potentially copy-cat behaviour. Actually, I found that I enjoyed the book immensely - the relationships between paired contestants and their adversaries was interesting and ultimately<br />a \\"happy ending\\"  -DIFFERENT!
B0073LWEXK|5.0|This was a very fun game. I tried Grisly Manor and enjoyed it but it was short. This took many hours and provided lots of fun puzzles. I really appreciated the hint guide for the times I was a little stuck. Looking forward to future games from Fire Maple Games.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|It was amazing. A must read. I read all three in a weekend. I have recommended it to all my friends.

B003YBNRHU|5.0|The latest Doobie Brothers entry, \\"World Gone Crazy\\" is simply that - Fantastic.  The writing of Tom Johnston and Pat Simmons is classic Doobies all the way.  The voices are there, the harmonies are there, the musicianship is there.  What you hear is a superb seasoned band playing tighter than ever.<br /><br />Appearing on various tracks along with long-time Doobies Tom Johnston, Pat Simmons, John McFee and the late Michael Hossack are guest musicians including former Doobie Michael McDonald, Country legend Willie Nelson, Mark Russo (Yellow Jackets) and Mic Gillette (Tower of Power) on horns, and Greg Bissonette on<br />drums.<br /><br />The tracks all have the classic Doobie Brothers sound and cover a wide range of styles.<br /><br />The Reggae influenced \\"A Brighter Day\\" and rocker \\"Chateau\\" lead off followed by a true Doobie Brother classic, \\"Nobody\\" from their very first album, here getting an updated and energetic treatment.  The title track, \\"World Gone Crazy\\" follows with Tom Johnston's strong lead vocals.<br /><br />\\"Far from home\\" and \\"Little Prayer\\" are softer, acoustic oriented tracks with fine writing and lead singing by Pat Simmons.<br /><br />Young Man's Game\\" is a straight rocker with a Bob Seeger - \\"Old Time Rock 'n' Roll\\" feel but given a full Doobie Brothers treatment.<br /><br />\\"Don't Say Goodbye\\" features the vocals of Pat Simmons and former Doobie Michael MacDonald.  It has a smoother, soft jazz feel to it like something from \\"Living on the Fault Line\\".<br /><br />\\"My Baby\\" is a straight ahead blues a'la Doobies.<br /><br />The Latin-tinged Tex-Mex track \\"Old Juarez\\" there are bits of Santana, Malo and El Chicano flavoring another great Tom Johnston track.<br /><br />On \\"I Know We Won\\" Pat Simmons shares the writing credit and vocals with Willie Nelson.<br /><br />Nice slide guitar work from John McFee on \\"Law Dogs\\" gives the track a kind of backwoods bayou feel.<br /><br />\\"New York Dream\\" features the horns of Mark Russo and Mic Gillette witha funkier track reminiscent of Tower of Power.<br /><br />The accompianying DVD contains a 30 minute documentary covering the career of the Doobie Brothers as well as an insight into the making of this album, \\"World Gone Crazy\\".  It also contains the complete music video for \\"Nobody\\".  IMHO the expanded edition of this CD is well worth the price of admisson.<br /><br />There is not a bad (or even mediocre) track to be found on this CD and there is literally something for everyone.  This is easily my favorite Doobie Brothers album since \\"Stampede\\" from their classic stuff of the 70s.  The vocals are full and harmonic while the musicianship is tight, mature, energetic and inspired.<br /><br />Fantastic, indeed.
B0063GORYU|5.0|its a great game to play! anytime i have free time.. this is the first game i play. its great! i love it!
B005PK1G76|5.0|Very convenient, fits 2 water bottles, baby snacks, keys, phone ... I like the way it attaches on the stroller handle, so it hangs vertically with gravity. I used the Joovy organizer for a while but it covers the handle and, because of the handle angle, it attaches in a horizontal position, which is not convenient, to me anyway.<br />I love the price too. I just bought the Diono so I am hoping it will last long enough.
0143036742|3.0|Moderately entertaining novel, however it certainly isn't extremely funny' as the cover blurb states. Actually it is quite a sad tale of an elderly widower trying to get one more chance of happiness by an entering an ill-advised marriage with a pneumatic 36 year-old blonde from his homeland.<br />His two feuding daughters start to pull together to save their father. And as the book continues we learn of the terrible lives of the father and elder daughter in World War 2 Ukraine...<br />Parts of the narrative involving the dreadful Valentina come across as a somewhat unbelievable and over-the-top farce; maybe it would have been better if it was written as either a tragic or comic novel and not an uneasy mix of the two. But it kept me reading to the end.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|love playing this game...it works great and I like how u can play with facebook friends or random people. great game!

B00127RAJY|5.0|So I just worked out to this video for the first time, and I thoroughly enjoyed it. I don't necessarily want to see the numbers on my scale go down, I just want my clothes to fit better. I have heard so much about this DVD, I decided to check it out (from the library that is)<br />I am pretty athletic, I bike 20-50 miles 3-4 times a week, with rides up to 100 miles some weeks, I do a weight training DVD (Jari Love - I adore her workouts) twice a week, and I walk or hike 3-5 miles at least once a week (at a 4mph pace) So I thought, \\"How could this 20 minute workout be enough to really challenge me and make me feel like I have really worked out?\\"  Well, right now I can barely lift my arms to type this review, and I am still perspiring from the workout.  As others have said, I certainly found myself asking, \\"Are we there yet?! Is this over, for goodness sake?!\\" But then, a minute or two later, we were done - it really does fly by.<br />The cardio exercises seem high impact - I have had problems with my knees in the past when I was training for a marathon, and I found ice and stretching after running really helped keep my knees from getting sore (minor tear in the meniscus).  If I find this workout hurts my knees, I will ice and stretch after the workout.<br />I also offer these pieces of advice:<br />If you aren't sure about this DVD, get it from the library or Netflix before you buy it (I found many of Jillian Michaels' DVDs at the library)!<br />I also recommend, if you are a woman, wearing a sports bra for the workout... just sayin'...<br />I recommend wearing a good pair of running shoes, better for the cardio.<br />I found 2.5lb weights to be adequate for the first time, even though I use 6lb weights for my other weight training DVDs.  I thought it would be too light, but by the end of the workout, I could barely lift the 2.5lb above shoulder height.<br />Fortunately I had a bottle of water nearby.  Even though I drank a liter of water a couple hours ago, I was absolutely parched about halfway through the workout.<br />I'm planning to do this workout every day, and keep biking (my truest love) and I will update this review in a few weeks.<br />Update 6/13/2012:<br />After the first week I lost 5 pounds, but I also monitored my calorie intake and purposely decreased my calories.  I noticed some changes in how my clothes fit and how I looked after two weeks, but I haven't lost any more weight (poundage) since the first week, in spite of working out every day and cutting calories.<br />My arms and legs are definitely more toned, my waist more defined, and my abs a little flatter.  I can't say I am \\"Shredded\\" but I must be honest and say I never made it to Level 3 - I liked Level 2 so much, I stayed there for 20 days.<br />I feel good and I love this workout DVD.  I will use it for days when I am really pressed for time but still want to work up a good sweat.<br />I want to re-emphasize the need to wear good shoes for the workout - I am certain that I would be having knee pain if I didn't wear my running shoes to do this DVD - the cushioning and stability are a must for the moves you do.  So far I don't have any knee pain and for this I am very grateful!  As for doing this workout every day - my opinion, and I am not an exercise physiologist, is that if you keep the weight light, it really is OK.  It's when you use weights to feel a real burn that you need to let the muscles recover for about 36-48 hours.  I use a 2.5lb (1kg) weight and I don't feel a burn, just a good workout.
B006XF5BTG|5.0|I just finished the book and it is extremely informative.  I have been working out for a few years and have encountered a tremendous amount of misinformation.  The author has researched his topic and has science to back up his conclusions.  The book is a very quick read, and contains very useful information on proper nutrition, lifts, reps and appropriate workouts.  I workout at home, I appreciate that his workouts are geared around home equipment.  The author has done a great job dispelling the various myths associated with building a better body.
B007N85POS|4.0|extremely good graphics, funny and great stress reliever- I previously left a negative review.  I apparently don't know my elbow from my knee cap and certainly that previous review was my bad and someone needs to feed me beans.
B007ZRZF8I|5.0|I like it. it is more fun on the kindle than ipod it is addictive and fun to play. that is all
B007DJUO8O|4.0|One must appreciate the artists for being bold enough to try out music of their choice without a care of what the fans may think or expect based on their more popular previous outputs.<br /><br />One must also appreciate the fact that they haven't released this album under the name of their established bands as that would be cheating their fans from expecting something similar to their earlier releases.<br />This album is nothing like any of their previous work and is highly self indulgent in nature. It is not an easy listen (Like Heritage it seems to have some instances of melody but most of the time the music is hard to describe). Slow, eerie at times, lullaby like and minimilistic are words that can be used to describe it.<br /><br />This said the album is quite interesting and catches one if attention is paid, though at first listen it will seem simplistic and bare. additional listens will indicate it is not a simple album and it's creators have created a complex piece of work, work that they can be proud of.<br /><br />So yes at pain of repeating myself it is self indulgent, however which great artist has not been self indulgent.. Van Gogh was and so were so many painters. The consideration to fans is that they have released the album under a different name so actual comparisons are not really justified.<br /><br />This is not an album you will listen to over and over again...but you will pick up once in a while only and during the play hopefully you will appreciate the musicians effort to express themselves through a type of music they would not have been able to create if they had not done 'Storm Corrosion'. This album is bound to get blasted despite the clarity given by the artists that it not the expected style of music they play, has hardly any drums and is dark...<br /><br />Finally the title of the band Storm corrosion is the best way to describe the album....the music works over a long time and slowly it starts to corrode you with it's incessant over indulgence...A fine part of the Trilogy...Grace, Heritage and Storm Corrosion.
0345803485|1.0|I find this book offensive, it reads like it was written by a 12 year old boy/girl with mommy/daddy issues.  The rhetoric is simplistic...the writing is sub-par and the content is nothing short of offensive.  Why this book is a best seller is beyond me.  I suppose the saying is true, \\"Never underestimate the power of stupid people in large groups.\\"  This author deserves nothing but a good shunning from the literary community.
B006Z1XY7E|4.0|There's eclectic... and then there's Gotye. This album is all across the board, dabbling in a fairly wide pastiche of musical genres and sounds. It's now in steady rotation on my iDevices.
B007V2UGPE|4.0|terrriffic and past paced game... I really enjoy playing all hands up and highly recommended for those avid takers. blab blab blah blah. blah
B00785P2QC|5.0|This game has plenty of options to keep u busy with ur city. would like to be able to rotate objects. but fun reguardless.
B0054JZC6E|1.0|its the worst game ever! never played a worse game in my life. complete waste of time on somone making the game and sombody who has played it. why? the ehy is because the game is absolutely pointless and sucks.
B007PT3QOQ|2.0|I gave it two stars because the big issue is the time on buildings crops and animals always go's wrong some say over a hundred hours mine it said 48 hours so I restarted it from the becoming then it was 24 hours so if gameloft see's this please fix the glich but other than that its an amazing game.
B007PVHAN2|5.0|Informative, insightful, inspiring, touching. Very well put together, very well done.  I have already watched this at least 10 times. I knew Bob was an amazing artist but did not know what a great man he was too.  I just pre-ordered this on Blu-ray so I can watch it again and again.
B00136NUMU|5.0|I gave away this album many years ago, thought I was over the Boss.<br />Finally got around to replacing it, why did I wait so long?<br />It is great.
B001EBWITA|5.0|DVD came as expected in it's wrapper on the promised date. A great movie, one that Keanu Reeves was perfect in.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I was reluctant at first, wondering if this would be a sappy love story. It was the perfect blend of fear, hope, faith, and ...love. If you've ever loved or been loved, ever been a parent, lived in a big city or small town, been the victim of domestic violence or known someone who has, this book is for you! You will not be disappointed.
B002N14GPE|5.0|DVD came as promised, new, and earlier than expected. This is a fantastic movie; Isabelle Fuhrman (Clove - \\"The Hunger Games) as Esther is ever so creepy, probably one of the best mean and nasty performance for a child actor ever.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|WOW!  This was a fantastic read.  I could not put it down.  I don't usually read sci-fi or anything close to this \\"type\\" of book, but one day I was browsing through to find a good read, a different author, and came across Wool Omnibus (Wool 1-5).  The reviews were so good I decided to give it a try and I'm glad I did.  Looking for more Mr. Howey, keep them coming.  You are now one of my favorite authors and I can't wait to read more of your writings!!!  Do yourself a favor, buy the book, borrow the book, whatever, get it on your Kindle and settle down for a terrific read.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I heard about this book on the radio, I decided to purchase it and OMG!!! I was so engrossed in this book I couldn't put it down.<br />Without giving too much away, at times I was so MAD at Christian!<br />I actually agreed on almost everything with Anastasia><br />This book is Hot, Hot, Hot!!!!!!!<br />Very well written, it's a book you'll either Love, or Love To Hate!
B007SSEBCU|5.0|It's a wonderful and interesting movie about Margaret Thatcher. The end of the movie is the only let down... it doesn't really provide much closure for an ending. Other than that, the movie is fantastic and Streep was absolutely wonderful in the movie.
B0052TDGQO|5.0|I purchased the CD for my wife since she picked him to win on American Idol. She loved his Christmas CD.
1931559317|5.0|This is the second copy of \\"Pocket Sky Atlas\\" I have purchased. When I mislaid the first during a household move I found I really missed not having this handy reference. It is just the right size for carrying in my day pack as well as handling after the sun goes down when I participate in public outreach programs on astronomy.It contains all the pertenant information necessary to research the night's upcoming routine for \\"show and tell\\" with my telescope amongst the public. The numerous appendixes break down the various stellar delights according to type and classification. I have purchased several other Sky Atlases in the past but this is the one I now turn to for my astronomical questions.<br />It does not hurt to be able to buy one as inexpensively as I was recently able to do from Amazon. Money well spent.
B004Q1FDHO|1.0|Used to be great. Now just constantly force closes. When you can play the game it's extremely glitchy. Equipment disappears without being used. Sometimes fish swim at super speeds. Game randomly chooses levels and resets your boat.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|love it loads of fun. cant put it down. I am addicted. I could play all day and night. just need more energy faster

B000LPR9ZS|3.0|Saw 2 was *just* good enough to make me want to get the third one. Since it was, like, four bucks here for the Blu-ray, I thought, Why not?<br /><br />Short version: It's the goriest \\"Saw\\" yet, but still not as gory as some other flicks, notably the remake of \\"I Spit On Your Grave\\" (hey, wanna watch forty-five minutes of sadistic rape? Or do you prefer the girl's rather creative and tortuous revenge sequences that would make Jigsaw flinch?), nor is it on the level of some of the classics, like \\"High Tension\\", \\"Suspiria\\", or \\"REC\\", probably because Saw doesn't seem to take itself all that seriously, but the other flicks do. \\"Hostel\\" also does the same thing, which makes it more potentially disturbing. The entire \\"Saw\\" series is a bit cheesy, really, and takes a few too many creative liberties when it comes to plot and realism. At least the other films mentioned tried to look realistic, but the Saw series is almost comical in comparison, with far too much emphasis on all that crap about Amanda, and other things virtually none of us cares about. Just get to the damned traps already; we don't give a damn about Amanda or the prequel part or any of that garbage. Since when was \\"Saw\\" known for its masterful storytelling? Right, never. It's the puzzles that hook us, so stick to the damned puzzles. \\"Saw III\\" tries way too hard to make itself into a cohesive story, as if anyone cares at all, but it pretty much makes up for it with the traps involved, the entire freaking reason we go to see the films. (Unfortunately, as we all know now, the Saw series got progressively worse as it tried to make itself more than a gorefest with some stupid story thrown in we always skip over in our players).<br /><br />I was a little worried going in that this was going to be a cash-in sequel that doesn't even try to hide that it's a cash-in sequel--you know, just gore, gore, gore, with no creativity in there, which is why I think anyone watches Saw to begin with. You want to see people die orcome close to death through the \\"puzzles\\" they have to suffer through. Yeah, it's sick entertainment, but it's a good premise, and Saw III actually goes the extra mile here and does multiple \\"traps\\" at the same time. No one cares about Amanda or anything except the \\"traps\\", so what we get here is pretty good, and it even has arguably a better twist ending than the second one. It's quite a whopper that you very likely won't see coming. I had a guess, because I knew the plot couldn't be as straightforward as it seemed at first; that wasn't Saw. Something that changed everything had to happen, and here, it does, and it does so with gusto. I have to say, it was very satisfying. The final few minutes with the big reveals are a treat, and you get psyched-out a few times, but not for no reason, but because it's critical to the idea behind Jigsaw's plan.<br /><br />The short of it? There's plenty of gore, some unique deaths (and one involving drowning in dead exploding pig juice that is rather icky), and the whole twist ending thing Saw always does. The opening one we get is pretty high up there as likely the most potentially disturbing, and for people who love this stuff (like me) and actually like how sick they're willing to go in a film, it was a fun thing to watch (but you've got to admit that the rules were downright unfair for all he had to do--a minute and thirty for all that, plus escaping before he's blown up? Who could do that in a minute and thirty?). It's got the gore, the screams, the pain, all the stuff we love to watch.<br /><br />The thing is, Saw will never replace the horror films out there that are willing to push the envelope to near-impossible levels. Now, I understand that wide-release horrors can't be on the level of, say, the \\"I Spit On Your Grave\\" remake, which involved, among other things, a *forty-five minute rape scene*, and someone getting a shotgun through the mouth...in reverse. You'd have to see it to know what I mean. In any case, that was easily NC-17 material, with full-frontal nudity, unrestrained sadistic rape, gratuitous torture, and an emphasis on pain, rather than gore, which actually makes it unique. It's also not quite on the level of \\"Hostel\\" or \\"High Tension\\" or \\"Suspiria\\" or a bunch of other horror flicks, mostly foreign, you've likely never heard of. They get more liberties, or something, I dunno. American horror films don't get as much room to work with, I suppose.<br /><br />Not bad, not great--too heavy on worthless story none of us watched any of the films for, and too many breaks to go into the history of Jigsaw and Amanda, and other things absolutely no one cares about. Seriously, all we want is traps. Do nothing but give us Jigsaw making traps for 90 minutes, make them creative and well-designed, and we're all happy for it. But start throwing in a story, and our fast-forward buttons start to wear out. Saw III was the beginning of this, and it got worse as time went on, almost totally ruining the series until the disastrous \\"Saw 3D\\" (now officially retitled \\"Saw: The Final Chapter\\" because 3D sucks and none of us want it).
B0054JZC6E|4.0|it is a great game because there are many things to do and the games have such a range that you never really get bored. although I don't like that you have earn points to get more games. but overall its a pretty good app.
B00026WU7I|5.0|I have over the years, owned most of his studio recordings at one time or another and a number of the live or compilation recordings.  Blood On The Tracks was my first Dylan album that I purchased and that was because of the significant air time of the song \\"Tangled Up In Blue\\".  What sets apart Blood on The Tracks is the personal emotion that Dylan seems to put forth.  Real or just my perception it makes no difference of course since I am the listener.  The song Idiot Wind seems to display a angry frustration of a woman in his past.  His vocals are as good as anything he has done including Nashville Skyline.  I do not care as much for his very latest efforts as his voice is simply horrible now (probably do the the many years of smoking).  It is extremely difficult to pick a favorite Dylan album but without going through tedious detail this is my favorite.  Just an aside, some of my other favorite musicians/bands are Neil Young, Tool, Radio Head, Johnny Cash, Pearl Jam, Steve Earle, The Cranberries, Days of the New, Patsy Cline, Stevie Ray Vaughn, Led Zeppelin, Van Morrison, and The Pretenders to name a few.
B004V5QWU2|2.0|Loved it until it caused phone to crash when trying to download one of the sounds. Factory presets was only cure. The sound download just kept going and would not stop until phone was turned off. Ugh!
1936719010|5.0|This book is a MUST read.  I frequently revisit it.  Very good insight and great encouragement.  Needs to be a staple on any entrepreneurs bookshelf. Having trouble making things work? Great insight in this book to help out. Wondering why things seems to work for other people but not you?  Read this book!
B000H7JCG4|5.0|I ordered this for my sister who is 16 because she was watching reruns on television and enjoyed it. I figured she would enjoying receiving the DVD set as well and boy was I not wrong. When she got this all she wanted to do was open it and watch it, which she did. I'm not disappointed and she isn't disappointed. So I'm very happy with the service and rapid shipping on this product. You can be sure I'll be ordering Season 2 as well as all the others just as soon as I can.
B0064NTZJO|3.0|I just watched \\"Drive\\" in Blu-ray here in Brasil. I have a Infocus 1080p and use a 120\\" screen.<br />The PICTURE QUALITY deserves ONLY 3 stars! I don't understand why people gave 5 stars for PQ in others sites!!! Someone can explain me???<br />I did not see yet \\"Collateral\\" in Blu-ray (it's coming from Amazon to me) but I have the feeling that it will have a much better PQ than \\"Drive\\". And of course, \\"Collateral\\" is a better movie than \\"Drive\\".
B00634GHJA|5.0|Works flawless just wish it had option to select all but works great on my note<br />Highly recommend I got it for free love it
B0062P332Y|4.0|This is a good action movie. The Blu-ray has a great video quality, much better than \\"Drive\\". I know, they are different movies, but talking about PQ, \\"Killer Elite\\" is much better than \\"Drive\\" !!!
B0054JZC6E|3.0|I think it's an okay app. I thought it had all the games when I downloaded it. turns out that you have to unlock them by playing and earning coins. Some are pretty easy and addicting, some are a bit harder. All in all I'm satisfied.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I really like the exercise video. Even though it's just 20 minutes long, it leaves you sweating and tired and you feel you've actually worked hard. I would recommend this video to all of those who say 'they don't have time to exercise'. This is probably the quickest solution to your problem. Exercises are straight forward, easy to do and fast!!
B007J4T2G8|2.0|When I saw this in the NYBSL, I almost purchased it.  Then I realized it was under erotica.  So I was a bit unsure so I placed it on my wish list.  I finally got it when on vacation a random person at the pool was discussing how much she enjoying it. So when I got back I purchased it. The lead female character just gets on my nerves.  This is poorly written, and I wasn't even sure I was going to finish reading it.  Around 65% through the book it picked up and became a little more interesting, but I would save my money for something better unless you just want to read \\"mommy porn\\".  The content is not what bothers me it's the lead character and the ridiculousness of the writing.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|This game is identical to Mario its fun but the whole purpose is pep to reach the other side of the rainbow.

B001VTTRC6|3.0|Picture was fine, one brief freeze but nothing that lasted long to be annoying - however, the sound was crap - not the quality but the volume - there just wasn't any decent volume - I will be very reluctant to use streaming movies from amazon again because of this
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Fantastic trilogy.  So glad I decided to read it.  I recommend it to anyone.  Far far better than the movie because you learn so much more about all the characters.

B0061S073A|5.0|Kids Place is a great app for moms to hand over the Kindle with an extra level of protection. It does a great job blocking the home and web. I usually disable wifi before handing my Kindle over, but just in case I forget Kids Place does a good job.  My only concern is if wifi is on and an ad is clicked, it will open a window to the site in your web browser for you to find later when you exit Kids Place.  I don't know if any in app purchasing can happen accidently this way, so it is a good idea to understand you must be watchful too.  Keep the parental controls on,  wifi off, and Kids Place active and you will protect innocent eyes from popular e etc. while they are enjoying time on the Kindle Fire.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|Good game for riding in the car during a long trip. I would have been super bored on my way to Denver, but I had this game. Cool.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love this app, never had any issues.  It runs fast and very easy to use.  I would reccomend this to anyone who was interested.
B005QN3ANK|5.0|After being broken up for years Aqua is back, and better than ever! Most of the time I'll like a handful of songs in a CD but never the whole album, however this is not the case as I find myself enjoying every single track of Megalomania. Aqua brings back their classic sound that made them so popular in the 90's but with an updated tone. Megalomania is a must buy for any Aqua fan or fan of the pop genre.
B000O8OTNC|1.0|This thing did absolutely nothing to sharpen my knife. No noticeable difference afterwards. I use my knife for multiple things such as opening boxes, cutting ropes, etc. It does a good job doing this just is not very sharp. I consider a knife sharp when it can do the paper test at the very least. I also like the shave off arm hairs test. My knife couldn't do this easily usually ripped the paper then start slicing through it and can't shave my arm hairs. Anyway followed directions on back, says (summarized) if you have a reasonably sharp blade use on a flat surface using the ceramic slot perform 8-10 pulls through the ceramic slot with tip at a downward angle while applying some force downwards. I did this then tried the tests again with no improvement. In the directions it says that harder steels may require additional pulls so I gave it another 20-30. Again no difference so I look at the info about the carbide side. It says that the carbide sets new edge and is for dull or damaged blades. I figure I'll try it. Directions are the same as ceramic except 4-6 pulls. I perform this then pull it through ceramic side another 20 pulls. Still the same results. Try running it through the carbide again giving it increased pulls, did about 15 then ran it again through the ceramic for 30 more pulls. Still no improvement, I gave up on getting the desired test results andjust tried to see if I could cut the same stuff I am used to cutting. No noticeable difference at all. As far as I can tell this thing just ground away a little bit of my knife for no good reason. I am just thankful that it didn't damage or grind away too much of my knife! In case your interested my knife is a \\"Schrade Switch it\\" which was a gift. It's made from \\"Schrade +\\" steel (Made in the U.S.A. not China!), which is stainless steel 440A if I did my research right. Very Similar to the one found here http://www.amazon.com/Imperial-Schrade-SW7SCP-Switch-It-Sheath/dp/B0000DEZN4.<br /><br />To summarize<br /><br/>Pros: Fits in your pocket.<br /><br />Cons: About as useful as the pocket lint or gum wrappers that are in my pocket as well.<br /><br />Other thoughts: The serrated sharpener seemed to have worked a little bit or... maybe it just made my serrations a little bit thinner and now they will snap off the next time I cut a box open.<br /><br />People who rated this thing 5 stars either got something different in the mail than I did, or are easily amazed when they are holding something sharper than a butter knife.
B003MOHX8S|5.0|I was surprised at just how many of these songs I had actually heard before, in movie previews. They are wonderful!

B004I8WD6E|5.0|This case is just what I needed. I wanted a reasonably priced case that protected but wasn't too thick and bulky. After many hours of research, I read the reviews on Amazon and decided to give this one a try. This case fits my Verizon white iphone 4 perfectly. The screen protector went on easily. The case looks great and fulfills my exact needs. I would definitely recommend it.
0345803485|1.0|First off let me start off by saying that I've read Twilight. For those who don't know, this book was adapted from a Twilight fanfiction. A [hopefully] original story set in the universe of the series. As someone who enjoys, and has admittedly written a few fan fictions himself [not of twilight], I came into this expecting something abysmal.<br /><br />Abysmal is far too kind a word to describe the atrocities to my soul this woman inadvertently inflicted.<br /><br />This can be summed up as the bland incoherent ramblings of an unlikeable college girl with no motor skills and the personality of dried glue. Anastasia gets to know the rich and handsome CEO Christian Gray through a series of contrived dialogue, elementary attempts at banter that's supposed to be \\"witty\\", and poorly executed plot devices. The characters are not memorable, compelling ,or unique by any stretch of the imagination, the vocabulary is lacking to the point where the same four words/phrases/information are repeated within the same paragraph, and anyone who's read Mrs Meyer's book can easily link the characters together. I'll make a chart for you.<br /><br />Ana = Bella<br />Christian = Edward<br />Paul = Mike<br />Ray = Charlie<br />Jose = Jacob<br /><br />But that's not the worst part. What's truly appalling is that not once during this woman's haphazard \\"plot\\" is there any evidence, any droplet, of creativity or originality attempted. Her characters are mooks. Faceless, one-dimensional, and forgettable, with absolutely no insight into their motives or personalities other than what's stated in plain text rather than communicated through the narrative. For self-loathing masochists this book is a godsend. For everyone else its a special kind of horrid. I'm an author myself with a work-in-progress on fictionpress . com.  I gave this book a chance in the interest of supporting another underdog, but right now the only thing I'd support is an 18-wheeler dropped on my skull.
B005HSG3TC|4.0|There really isnt much to this cover. It fits snug, but is easy enough to detach if necessary. The inside of the flap tends to pick up any lint that gets on the Kindle screen. When folded back, the flap doubles as a lightweight stand. It isnt super sturdy, but assuming you arent constantly fiddling with it when using the stand, it is just fine. I think if you are reading an actual Kindle book or surfing the web, the stand will probably not be adequate. Conversely, if you are playing music from it, the stand is more than fine. It basically sets in a little indentation on the back of the cover. That element of the cover is really all about your personal needs. If you are going to be actively using the Kindle while having the stand set, this may not be for you. Me personally, i generally rest the Kindle on my lap when reading or messing around with games or online features.<br />My only real complaint personally is that there is no spot to store your stylus, which, in my opinion, is a no brainer given the utility of a stylus with the Kindle Fire. A simple pen sleeve on the back would suffice i think.<br />Anyway, I have no doubt there are better covers/stands on the market, but i like this one just fine. It does the job it is supposed to do, which is primarily to protect your Kindle Fire. Job well done in that regard.

B007SYWFRM|5.0|It is so fun that yesterday I couldn't set my kindle down. I was trying and trying to focus on something else but all I could think about was that one game!
B00785P2QC|5.0|Great game for people who love city builders. The money is a bit hard to get but the quality is amazing.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|great game i love it.it is so fun. hope you guys make more games like this.keep doing good on these games
1466401885|4.0|This was a good book. I thought the main characters ages were a little young for the things they were doing and the emotions they had but it definitely kept my interest.
B007SYWFRM|3.0|It's just too tiring. If it were to happenq quicker, it would be better. Overall, it's fun though. I like it.
B007T9UIMA|5.0|A concert performed by five amazing members of the band is finally going to be released in DVD. You know I will be getting this exactly the day it hits the DVD shelves. I can not wait. These guys are phenomenal.
1595827684|5.0|I ordered this book strictly out of pure want, it's a great addition for any fan of the series. The quality of the book is great, hard cover displays the characters of the second mass effect game and the inside is just as great to look at. I would definitely recommend this book to any fan of the series or to anybody who likes to get their hands on great quality art books.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This is not my genre. I took a chance and loved it. I usually read historical romance. I am so glad I bought these books. They are awesome.
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|Huge fan of the old school game so I downloaded and prepared myself for some hunting, forging and bouts of disentary.  Sadly this game is nothing like the original. It plays more like FarmVille, than Oregan Trail. Really the only semblance to the old game is the name. The  hillbilly guide is annoying and gathering supplies becomes redundant and boring.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|very fun game to play while you listen to pandora :-) exactly like super mario bros lol. there's really no reason not to download this app.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This  is my most  used  Application.  I love  being  able  to  read all  of lhe versions  available and the fantastic number  of reading  plans. The  reminders help me to talk to God everyday and and keep me personally in touch with God daily.  It keeps  me from getting  side tracked with worldly  things  and connected  to God  all day.  I truly  believe  this  is the best app I have. Thank you to all who  have worked so  hard  to  make  this  application available to so  many  people.
B004VD3YIM|5.0|I can't really find any thing to complain about. Nice features plenty of compatibility. Great how it fully supports all my camera's features and functionality. Nice job!

B007J4T2G8|1.0|This book was not worth my time. I got it, read 6 chapters in, and got annyed by it. Seriously, how much repition can one book have? Well, she did have some (alot) orgasms that i found quite delicious... Hey what can you expect im a guy!
B006R1T40I|5.0|I have been a Bonnie Raitt fan for longer that I want to say. Fell in love with her music in the early 1970's. She is one of the best blues guitarists in the music business. She played with wonderful old bluesmen when she was young and learned so much from them. Mississippi Fred McDowell was one of these seminal musicians. He was one of the best slide guitarists around. She did many concerts with him. So she learned slide guitar from one of the masters.<br />The singing and style of Sippie Wallace was also a major influence. Her 2009 tour with Taj Mahal was heavenly.<br />Her extraordinary love of good songs and her ability to present them in a unique style continues on this album. The choice of songs is great and the presentation fantastic. I bought three, one for my brother, my sister and for myself. We all love Bonnie and hope she keeps on rocking for a long time. Hope we do too!
B007SGM084|5.0|Unable to put this series down!! Little upset that I had to sleep!! LOL will def read this series again and again!!
0345803485|4.0|After hearing so much about this book, I finally looked it up on Amazon. The preview of the first 8 pages were discouraging, as well as learning that the main characters were modeled after Bella and Edward of Twilight. However, I decided to reserve judgement until I'd read the whole novel. I found that I was pleasantly surprised, despite the numerous problems throughout the story.<br /><br />First, the bad:<br /><br />1. The novel is written in what I suppose is \\"stream-of-consciousness\\", however, I doubt that anyone begins every thought with \\"Holy (fill-in-the-blank)\\" and even if they did, it doesn't quite work in written form. It's repetitive and lessens the intensity of the story. Also, there's far too much eye-rolling considering the characters are all adults.<br /><br />2. There's a LOT that's ripped off from Twilight---Anastasia's blushing, lip-biting and self-esteem issues; her \\"harebrained\\" mother; Christian being extremely attractive (with untidy hair!) and limitless riches; him telling Anastasia that she should stay away (yet he keeps talking to her)---the list goes on.<br /><br />3. I get that Christian Grey is hot and very sexy but even so, Anastasia's \\"earth-shattering\\" orgasms happen far too easily and often in the same manner. Also, considering the subject matter and the number of f-bombs dropped in the novel, the sex scenes are generalized and contain silly lines like \\"he touched me...there.\\" Come on!<br /><br />4. There really isn't much of a plot--the major conflict of the story is whether or not Anastasia will sign the \\"contract\\" Christian writes out detailing the terms of their BDSM relationship. There's not a lot of character development either---with the exception of Christian Grey, who clearly struggles between what he's always known and the undeniable feelings he's developing for Anastasia.<br /><br />Now, the good:<br /><br />1. Despite the Twilight rip-offs, everything I hated about that book are absent here. For starters, Anastasia is a likeable character. Christian's controlling tendencies are not painted as romantic, in fact, he's quite upfront about this aspect of his personality and Ana is quick to call him out on it (even if it's in a tone of \\"You big meanie-head!\\"). Though it's her first relationship, she's aware enough to notice that it isn't quite how she pictured it would or should be. Anastasia becomes even more despondent as she watches her best friend become happy and carefree with Christian's brother---the exact opposite of herself. Unlike Bella, Anastasia is independant and wants a life outside of Christian.<br /><br />2. The emails between Christian and Anastasia are snarky and quite entertaining--well, for me anyway.<br /><br />3. Anastasia remarks often on Christian's hotness and Christian wants to bone Anastasia pretty much every second but you get the sense that there's genuine love blossoming between them. You find yourself rooting for the characters by the end.<br /><br />Fifty Shades of Grey has its flaws and it's not a work of literary genius. However, there's a certain pull to it and makes for a great rainy-day read. I would definitely recommend this book.

1594202710|5.0|I must confess that prior to reading On China, I knew little about the country other than popular culture stereotypes and a smattering of history.  This has now changed and I feel more secure in my knowledge of China and the reasons they act illogically and irrational at times.<br /><br />I do not believe that there is another country on the face of the earth where the totality of history must be so strongly considered when constructing diplomatic strategy.  Kissinger provides this in-depth history and analysis that provides us a scaffold.  In the past, too often we have stumbled around in the dark trying to keep one step ahead of their mindset.  And too often, our Congress and leadership has presented simplistic and naïve solutions to the China problem without consideration of this deep history.<br /><br />Throughout the book Kissinger expounds on the Chinese canon of strategic thought that includes subtlety, indirection and patience over sword rattling.  The modern western world must understand these strategies to the nth degree or we will once again become vassal states of the \\"Middle Kingdom\\".  Kissinger has provided this well written book as a guide and offers wise advice for the future.  It greatly concerns me that we will not take it.<br /><br />I hope you find this review / opinion helpful.<br /><br />Michael L. Gooch,  Author of Wingtips with Spurs.
B003VANOFY|5.0|I've had this headset for about 4 months now. I've had some cheap wireless headphones in the past that I wasn't very impressed with and was a bit hesitant to purchase these. I really wanted a wireless headset so I could play games from my couch on my media center PC connected to my TV. After buying this headset, I've been very impressed by it. The sound quality is great, I love the built-in volume control and the battery life. I only game a few hours a week and have only had to charge it a few times. The mic quality is great when I use it with Ventrilo software during Call of Duty gameplay. Overall, it does what I want.
B001BNFR6W|1.0|This is absolutely the worst purchasing experience I have had with Amazon in 14 years.  Beginning with the second disc and continuing through the Second Season, every disc has skips, provides the inability to view certain espisodes, and left me with sheer frustration. I am not even going to waste my time trying to watch the rest of this rip off. Because I did not sit and watch the entire series within 30 days, I am timed out of returning and/or exchanging. SAVE YOUR MONEY!  This is my first NEGATIVE review of an Amazon purchase and I hope that it is my last.
B006BDHAX0|5.0|I love this game. &hearts;&hearts;<br />I play everyday.. It's great!!!<br />Now, NO MORE shut down middle in the playing game, after update.
B001DTPZNY|1.0|This movie truly represents the low quality movies that are coming out today.  I love all the Indiana Jones movies and even once inspired me to become an archaeologist.  However this movie like Lucas Star War pre-trilogy shows how Hollywood heavily depends on CGI versus a good story.  There is no great suspense or surprises that catch the viewer off guard such Marian surviving in Raiders of the Lost Ark nor the great sense of danger shown in the rail carts in the Temple of Doom.  While I was wanted to watch another Indiana Jones, but I learned a painful lesson.  Somethings are not worth revisiting with new sequels, modern remakes, etc.
B005V4X8JA|4.0|It is good to see that Amazon was able to get some additional units of this Steve Hoffman CS&N remaster at a reasonable price.  My copy arrived today and I did some comparisons with the 1994 remaster and I can verify that the Steve Hoffman version is significantly better than the earlier version.  I definitely heard the improvements and differences that others have spoke of in earlier posts; and I believe that this Audio Fidelity edition is worth the extra cost.  I played both discs enhanced for 7.1 surround sound utilizing ProLogic IIx Music and Lexicon Logic 7.  In addition to greater clarity and delineation of the instruments , there is more ambiance present in Steve Hoffman's version.  Both the PLIIx and L7 decoders seemed to extract more ambiance than from the 1994 version.<br /><br />(Note that the 1994 remaster is also HDCD encoded.  I did not compare that layer with the Audio Fidelity disc given that my equipment does not provide for HDCD decoding.)<br /><br />I missed out the last time around and I am happy that I was able to get this at a reasonable price.
B005NJ2K6U|5.0|Love this game. Wish it were longer. I'm on my 3rd new installation just so I can play it again.
B00005N6KG|3.0|These are my favorite style headphones for working out in. My only complaint is they failed after less then 5 months of use and are only warrantied for 90 days. Not horrible for an $8 product, but I'd expect Sony to stand by their products better then that.
B006E4QCXU|2.0|This app sounded really great so I tried to download it but it won't do it at all. it really bummed me out because I was looking forward to playing on it.
B006OB3K56|4.0|Good movie.  Liked it.  It was a difficult experience but worth it.<br /><br />But there was no digital copy. In spite of the front cover and the information on the Amazon web page, digital copies are not available for Apple devices (iPad, iPhone, iTunes, etc).  You will have to pay an additional $15 to iTunes to get the promised digital copy.<br /><br />When I complained to Fox I was told I was not deceived because there was a tiny green box on the back that said Android Market.  I needed a magnifying glass to read it; there was something above 'Android Market' but it was too small to actually print.  There is a larger graphic on the back that is the same as the one they use for digital copies that can be used by Apple products and that graphic includes a iPhone!<br /><br />[The software on their DVD used to download digital copies with a Mac is actually there and loads--it just won't download for Apple products!  So it took me a while to figure out I wasn't doing anything wrong and that my computer was ok.]<br /><br />Even if there were a visible label, 'Android Market', it would not mean Apple products are not supported.  And nowhere on the box does it state that Apple products are not supported.  They were supported in the past and there is that picture of an iPhone.<br /><br />Obviously, there is no way to read the green box if you buy Blu-Ray's at Amazon or any other mail order source.  Or if you shop in brick & mortar stores without a magnifying glass.  Beware of future Fox' digital copies.  It would probably be a good idea to call Amazon or Fox to find out what is included in the package.<br /><br />The film gets 4 stars;  the Blu-Ray, DVD, Digital Copy package gets no stars at all.  I paid for but did not receive a digital copy.<br /><br />UPDATE:  Fox called me a few days ago and said they were sending a check for $15 so I could buy the digital copy from iTunes.<br /><br />UPDATE 2:  Fox did send me a check for $15 so I could buy the primised digital copy.  I changed my rating from 1 to 4 stars.I changed my rating from 1 to 4 stars.

B00127RAJY|5.0|I am on day 7 using this video. I have been eating healthy for 8 days. In that time span (today is sunday, i started a week ago) I have lost 7lbs already! I am so thrilled!! After I had my daughter I was 6lbs away from pre-pregnancy weight and then just kept gaining. I ended up getting to 20lbs heavier than my pre-pregnancy weight and was getting quite unhappy. Now I am 13lbs away from my pre-pregnancy weight and 28lbs from my goal weight. I feel so much healthier and better all around and I have even gone down a notch on my belt as well as my jeans getting looser on me. This video is awesome and I highly recommend it! Definitely eat healthy while you're doing this and drink lots and lots of water!
B005JE7WKI|4.0|This is a fun movie that spoofs the typical college kids in the woods meet hillbilly serial killer. I got lots of laughs at both the dialogue and certain scenes in the movie. (Disclaimer: I may be a bit predisposed to finding humor in these situations being a northerner relocated to the south.)Will it have you rolling on the floor? Quite possibly when watched with a few good friends while sipping some frothy beverages.
B0079J26TI|5.0|With the exception of the Schumann Symphony #4, the early Romantics were not often programmed by Klemperer in his concerts.  The performance of the Schumann Symphony #4 on this recording is nothing short of magnificent, one of the greatest recordings ever made of this work.<br /><br />The Mendelssohn performances are more controversal. The tempos for all the movements of the Mendelssohn Symphony #3 \\"Scottish\\" and the Symphony #4 \\"Italian\\" are slower than usual, as was typical of Klemperer in the early 1960's. The orchestral balance, phrasing, and mastery of structure, however, lend a satifying inevitability to each of these works. The \\"Scottish\\" in particular, which always struck me as being a bit episodic, has great cohesiveness in Klemperer's hands.  The same can be said for the companion Hebrides Overture. Klemperer, at least temporarily, convinces you that everybody else plays these works too fast.<br /><br />From a technical standpoint, the SACD remasterings give a sharper focus, resulting in lighter weight, and greater orchestral transparency than their redbook counterparts. Despite their age (1960), no apologies have to be made for the sound on these recordings.<br /><br />These performances may not be to everybody's tastes, but they are certainly worth listening to. After a few listenings, you too may fall under Klemperer's spell.
B00723NWJE|5.0|This may be the final chapter of soulful Jazz-meets Pop in a humanly revealing and relative look into the inner psyche of our quest for love and acceptance from everything other than ourselves.  Our quests, pursuits, and conquests always come with a price.  That price is always intense; heart ache, regret, loss, anger, jealousy, the thirst for vengeance, and finally the snap and slide into madness are always the asking price.<br /><br />All of these emotions are spelled out into physical action of \\"game playing\\", walking out on someone you love desperately, revenge in the form of cheating to provoke someone's suicide; only to find out that they were secretly loving someone else all along.  The regret and the lies we tell ourselves about how we are better off with our happy life....Alone.<br /><br />The grief, the love, the vengeance.  But in only the way a woman can bring/tell it.  In the final moments the question is posed is it all a dream, did this really happen, what's real, what's not?  I think it poses the question to the listener, \\"What will YOU do?\\"<br /><br />This a torturous tale of heart break and madness, and I personally think it's brilliantly sculpted.  The musical style, although different, is very much the same as a combination of  the albums \\"Feels like home\\", and \\"Chasing pirates\\"  a final dark haunting compilation into the psyche of our little human hearts.<br /><br />BRAVA!!

B005LAIHKY|5.0|\\"Dark Shadows\\" is great! This is how the story goes: In the year 1752, Joshua and Naomi Collins, with young son Barnabas, set sail from Liverpool, England to start a new life in America. But even an ocean was not enough to escape the mysterious curse that has plagued their family. Two decades pass and Barnabas has the world at his feet -- or at least the town of Collinsport, Maine. The master of Collinwood Manor, Barnabas is rich, powerful and an inveterate playboy...until he makes the grave mistake of breaking the heart of Angelique Bouchard. A witch, in every sense of the word, Angelique dooms him to a fate worse than death: turning him into a vampire, and then burying him alive.<br /><br />Two centuries later, Barnabas is inadvertently freed from his tomb and emerges into the very changed world of 1972. He returns to Collinwood Manor to find that his once-grand estate has fallen into ruin. The dysfunctional remnants of the Collins family have fared little better, each harboring their own dark secrets. Matriarch Elizabeth Collins Stoddard has called upon live-in psychiatrist, Dr. Julia Hoffman, to help with her family troubles.<br /><br />Also residing in the manor is Elizabeth's ne'er-do-well brother, Roger Collins; her rebellious teenage daughter Carolyn Stoddard; and Roger's precocious 10-year-old son, David Collins.<br /><br />The cast led by Johnny Depp (as Barnabas, who also produced) & Michelle Pfeiffer (as Elizabeth) is great. The directing by Tim Burton is great. The story (based on Dan Curtis' TV series) by John August & Seth Grahame-Smith & the screenplay (based on Dan Curtis' TV series) by Grahame-Smith is great.<br /><br />The music by Danny Elfman is great. The cinematography by Bruno Delbonnel is great. The film editing by Chris Lebenzon (who also executive produced) is great. The casting by Susie Figgis is great. The production design by Rick Heinrichs is great. The art direction by Neal Callow, Dean Clegg, Christian Huband, Jason Knox-Johnston, Chris Lowe & Phil Sims is great. The set decoration by John Bush is great. The costume design by Colleen Atwood is great. The make-up effects (prosthetic & regular) by Charlie Hounslow, Duncan Jarman, Tamsin Dorling, Sophia Knight, Leonard MacDonald & Debbi Salmon (also hair stylist) are great. The stunts coordinated by Eunice Huthart & fights coordinated by James Grogan are great. The special effects supervised by Joss Williams & coordinated by Victoria Stokes are great. The visual effects supervised by Angus Bickerton & coordinated by Samantha Fazackerley, Charlotte Frances, Holly Gosnell (set supervisor) is great.<br /><br />This is a great blend of horror-comedy that keeps you thinking and entertained at the same time. This is another great pairing (the eighth) of Johnny Depp & Tim Burton, the fifth pairing of Depp, Burton & Burton's wife, Helena Bonham Carter (who plays Dr. Hoffman, also in her seventh pairing with Burton), as well. This is another great pairing of frequent Burton collaborators, as well, and an interesting reteaming as well, with Burton & Pfeiffer after nearly 20 years. This is also an interesting vampire film that is a little bit different from other vampire films that have been made that are out there, as well.
B001DJLCRC|5.0|The first episode will confuse and make you question just what is going on. It is a little slow at times but there is a lot of set up for the second season which is just unreal. It's a dark show but it is awesome.

B007FH9GT2|3.0|If I had done any research about the content, I would not have picked this movie.  I can see the story line and movie were well put together.  The theme is rough, quite sexual and the images are graphic.  Alot of the movie was something I closed my eyes for.  As an adult it's often tempting to watch something that is not remotely edifying.  If that's a concern don't watch it.

0545259096|4.0|Also reviewed on my blog, The Vintage Bookworm. ([...])<br /><br /> I've been dying to read this since I finished Linger. I won my copy from Ashley (from What's Your Story?) not long after it came out, and even though I wanted to read it as soon as it came in the mail, I was afraid to! I didn't want this trilogy to end. I didn't want to say goodbye to Grace and Sam. This is one of my top favorite young adult series.<br /><br />Even though I'm happy with how Forever ended, I still wish there were another book in the series. I'd love to know what happens after this. After everything they've went to with their relationship and the wolves.<br /><br />This series is so beautifully written, and so beautifully described and so real, that I just didn't want this to end. I cried so hard after I read the last line and realized there wasn't another chapter. I could of swore there was!<br /><br />Maggie is a fantastic author, I will definitely be getting my hands on her other books as soon as possible. I really need to catch up and read The Scorpio Races. I'm so inspired by her writing. It both inspires me, AND makes me want to chuck all my writing and curl into a ball. Her descriptions are amazing and just so..poetic. Her writing truly is beautiful. At least what I've read of it. The Wolves of Mercy Falls trilogy is.<br /><br />I'm not going to say much about anything with this book because it's the last in a trilogy and I don't want to give away any spoilers to those who decide to read this review before starting the series. So I'm just going to say that the characters are amazing. Even those who annoy you. Cole annoyed me so bad in Linger, but I loved him. I'm glad I got to learn more about him and read more from his point-of-view in this one. Also, Isabel. =) She really made me mad in the first book half the time, but she's become on of my favorite characters.<br /><br />And you can't forget about Sam. Oh, Sam. He's definitely my number one favorite. He's so sweet and caring and he'd rather take care of others, even Cole, than do things for himself. Things to make himself happy. He's definitely one of my top YA dream guys. *le sigh*<br /><br />Overall, I'm sad it's over, but it was a really good book. I'm going to miss this world. If you haven't read the series yet, or you have read the first two books, but not Forever. READ THEM/IT! Now! It's a great series and the writing is beautiful. Maggie is definitely an idol of mine.g and he'd rather take care of others, even Cole, than do things for himself. Things to make himself happy.

0060873027|1.0|This book is just bad. Flat plot and characters a la Enid Blyton's seven friends and the company in Hawai develop via a completely unsatisfactory technical explanation into a story about some smurfs fighting an evil gargarmel. All this is plastered together with lecturing on biology in a novel cookbook style prose. I am a biologist myself and I appreciate Michael Crichton's introduction to the book (\\"Interacting with the natural world, we are denied certainty\\"). He was right, more so than he knew perhaps. The rest of the book is so much less interesting than a bull's [see below].<br /><br />p. s.: The publication of a first version of this review was refused by amazon. As this is a book about biology, where for example parasitic wasp larvae feed, cocoon and prepare to hatch in one of the protagonist's arm, I thought calling thing's by their name would be appropriate. In a metaphorical way Michael Crichton certainly used to be literary bull who used to *** huge when he was still alive. Respectively this book is just micro.

B005VT42BS|3.0|I checked the accuracy of this app with my own business network. I found that the hostname, vendor, NetBIOS roles, and other fields of information are frequently wrong. But overall its a good app.  I won't uninstall it.
B007SGM084|5.0|I have never been more captivated by a story before as I was with this story.  It was not well written, at all.  It possessed a lot of British words and undertones trying to disguise itself as an American novel, but the story, itself, was spine tingling good.<br /><br />The first book grabbed me leaving me with really mixed emotions. Ana was very naive, especially for a kid of today's generation. A virgin at nearly 22- seriously? I cried, heartbrokenly, at the end of the book, and I couldn't wait to start reading book 2, and by this time, I was addicted.<br /><br />The first chapter in book 2 left me in love with Christian. Book 2 was my favorite, but there were some chapters that left me gasping for air between sobs.  It was so emotional.  I felt at one with the characters.<br /><br />Book 3 left me a little annoyed in the beginning.  I felt as though Ana was appeasing Christian submissively without being actually submissive.  I wanted to slap her around a little bit.  Christian's controllingness had become really, really absurd.  If this had been me in real life, I think I would have knocked him senseless. LOL  As the story neared its ending, I felt at peace, and really fell in love with Ana and Christian, and the ending really had a great message of love on all levels.  As it turned out, Christian had more love, than he ever imagined existed, in front of his eyes the whole time.  It was a very romantic story, and yes, the sex was HOT, but it wasn't as dirty and porn like as others make it seem.  There was a real story here, and once the story grabbed you, which was pretty much right away, the sex became a secondary bonus.  My favorite part of the books were the playful and sometimes not so playful emails between them.<br /><br />I highly recommend this trilogy to anyone that wants to be taken away in a romantic fantasy.  I don't even like fictional, romance books like this, but I have to say, this story knocked it out of the park, and men can really benefit fromthese books.  It is like a man's key to what women truly want, not just from the sex aspect, but from the whole romance aspect.  Christian had to be the most romantic guy ever- his words and mannerisms were so frigging HOT.  Unfortunately, when you finish reading the books and realize the guy next to you is nothing close to Christian Grey, you are brought back to reality quite quickly and major disappointment may set in because it almost forces you to take a good hard look at all that is lacking in your own relationship.  The reality is, this book was written by a woman, for a woman, and who knows better than a woman what another woman wants?  Men are painstakingly clueless, and that is why they should take advantage of this book if they really want to know what women want which is, romance, chivalry, sensitivity, caring and a control freak in the bedroom! LOL

B005WLQQ4Q|3.0|I love BTR, but unfortunately their second album, Elevate, lacks the punch that their first album has. The songs are not the kind that get stuck in your head, and it's lacking the amazing harmonizing that made their first album GREAT. I love almost every song on their first album, but on Elevate, I find myself searching for something I can love, and it's just not there. Hopefully, their next album will demonstate the creativity of the first. Elevate doesn't. If the songwriters were different than the ones who wrote the first album, then fire them and rehire the writers from the first album.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|This book is a beautiful, haunting exploration of life long after memory of us fades away.  It's a finely crafted science fiction masterpiece with vivid scenes that will live on long after reading.<br /><br />This book raises so many questions about human nature and the price of peace/survival that I found myself putting it down occasionally just to explore the concepts and rules of the world that the author created.<br /><br />Keep writing Hugh Howey!  What's happening in silo 40!<br /><br />And on a personal note, thank you for finally creating a post-apocalyptic thriller without cannibalism, torture or violence towards women.

1451648537|5.0|This is a riveting and gripping book, I was glued to the pages, I just didn't want to let go. I was actually up all night reading it, married to the sofa, running on caffeine. This was some story alright, A must read!!! I also really enjoyed another can't put down book that is a must read [[ASIN:B00821GQJI Courage - Key Battles In The War Against Workplace Stress (The Handy Little Book Series)]]
0307951529|5.0|This is, in short, a fantastic book. Chris Guillebeau--a self-taught entrepreneur who walks the talk in terms of having created from scratch a sustainable lifestyle business for himself--has collected dozens of case studies from other people who have done the same.<br /><br />What makes the book really compelling is that their stories are deftly woven into a step-by-step blueprint of how you can do the same; it's not simply a collection of anecdotes. The book covers idea generation, marketing, product launches, scaling your business, and more.<br /><br />Additionally, the case studies cover both a wide range of fields (technology, the arts, travel, food, and more) and a wide range of business types (brick-and-mortar to 100% online and everything in between). You will most likely find something in here that's highly relatable to your own fledgling idea, whatever it may be.<br /><br />Chris has also nailed down and shared income specifics for all of the profiled companies, which makes their stories much more interesting and instructive than simply telling us someone has started, say, \\"a successful travel-booking business.\\"<br /><br />Finally, while I have read and enjoyed books like The 4-Hour Workweek, I found this one much more directly applicable to my own life. I do not consider myself a born entrepreneur - many of the successful entrepreneurs profiled here stumbled into their work almost by accident (via unexpected layoff or hobby that grew into something more). You don't need to quit your day job and risk everything to make this work.<br /><br />Also, the book provides strong support for the idea that you really can start something lucrative without a huge initial investment - self-employment is not just for the trust-funded or those who are looking to raise lots of venture capital. Actual start-up costs are provided; the majority of those profiled, throwing out the outliers, spent under $500 getting everything up and running.<br /><br />Chris is a natural writer, and the book is a very interesting, compelling read - it's packed full of useful info and just a lot of fun besides. Highly recommended.
B003O86FMW|5.0|If you loved the Hunger Games, Catching Fire will not disappoint you.  It continues Katniss', Peeta's, and Gale's journey after the Games.  This book is hard to put down because you want to know what happens next.  It's full of twists and turns, that you don't except.  This is a must read for any Hunger's fan or anyone who wants a compelling and adventerous book to read.
1250006341|5.0|I ordered this book for my grandmother, who loves the show.  The book is full of gorgeous photos of the show sets, stills, and actors.  It also includes lots of information on lifestyles and events of the period in which Downton takes place.  It is a lovely and interesting book which would be enjoyed even by those unfamiliar with the show.
0061537969|4.0|The author laid it on a little thick at times - not only turning Enzo's owner, Denny, into a modern day Job, but a Job who held the coats of the bullies who were beating him up.<br /><br />And the ending is almost laughably cliched!<br /><br />But I still recommend this book simply because of Enzo - he stole my heart!
B003Y5H5EW|3.0|this movie was great until it go to the end. A very dissapointing ending indeed. I must also say the way it ended you kind of knew it was going to end, but in your mind your like this cant be it.....only to realize you were unfortunately correct. This movie is only worth about $5. Thats only because Kate is smokin hot.
B00127RAJY|5.0|This woman is awesome!!! Im on day 4 of level 2 of this workout dvd and its absolutely amazing. Jillian pushes you to your limit and beyond, and I love every bit of it. It feels as if shes really standing over you pushing you to make it through. I read some reviews of some buyers saying they dont like her approach or tone, well im the complete opposite. Shes an in your face type of trainer and I love it. Im 25 and we have similar personalities so it doesnt bother me. In  2 1/2 weeks following a 1200 calorie a day diet and working out 4-5 times a week with 30DS im down 10lbs ( I just added Michael Jackson The Experience as well) I will add more to this review once Ive completed the workout. But please let me add when I first started I could only do one pushup now I can go through 20 easy. If you want to burn fat and build lean muscle the 30DS is the way to go:)

1932735410|4.0|What I liked most about the book were the questions at the end of the chapters.  They tend to be more challenging than other books and online tests that I have taken.  I did not expect or care for the games and questions within the chapters.  This could have been removed and replaced with either more information or a shorter book with larger font.
B001UV4XIS|5.0|Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2 lives up to the hype... for the most part.  I really like the action overall.  Even though the film's over 2 hours long, it actually feels much MUCH shorter.  Perhaps because it's so compelling and I was caught up in the characters knowing this would be the last time I'd get to see them.<br /><br />The action is mainly focused around or inside the castle and all the havic and chaos that follows (which is a lot- especially related to the gang running from face-covered fireballs and the numerous mighty impressive explosions).<br /><br />Perhaps the only complaint is that the final boss fight isn't as epic as it could have been.  Without spoiling what happens, when Harry is supposedly deceased and someone else takes over the castle and the land, a battle then occurs that's good but not *great*.  It's not great because it lacks a sufficient amount of suspense and should have been stretched 10 minutes longer.  I don't know, after 10 years of the Harry Potter films, I believe it's fair for viewers to demand a more satisfying boss fight.  Still it's definitely good enough.<br /><br />When Harry enters a spiritual world of mist and haze, this entire segment is totally beautiful and offers great storytelling.  This and that one fireball chasing segment are highlights for me.  The amount of beautiful magic is a satisfying continuation from Deathly Hallows Part 1.<br /><br />Overall, the VERY end of the movie makes me cry and the rest of the film is really good too.  Recommended (do I even NEED to say \\"recommended?\\"  If you've been following the Harry Potter franchise all these years you're going to watch it anyway!)
B004UID2LC|4.0|This App works EXCELLENT.!!!!!<br />i LOVE How it Downloads ANY song i want.<br />This App is the BEST App i Have On My Kindle Fire.
0439023513|2.0|After loving the 1st 2 books I was so excited about the last one.  I am not going to reiterate the other 1 and 2 star reviews which I agree with, but I will say that this book was just so depressing, I kept expecting the book to turn around and was waiting for Katniss to fight for Peeta when he returned from being tortured, to help him remember his love for her, but that just never happened.  And there was never a realization of the love or an epiphany, she just ends up with him by default, what a sad ending to a great story.  I think that people should read the story to the wedding scene and the visit to Peeta and then come up with their own ending for the story!

B0079R8IYW|2.0|The Marware Exchange Case Cover with Stand for Kindle Fire<br /><br />Let's get to the point: I hate this thing.<br /><br />Here's why:<br /><br />1. It looks cheap.<br /><br />The case is made of a thin plastic sheeting, grained to look like leather. It doesn't look like leather. It looks like what it is: ugly stitched plastic. To use a phrase that is au courant: \\"this thing is ghetto\\"; as in it looks like something you got from a street-vendor, after you haggled for a while.<br /><br />Holding it reminds you of that old commercial with the catchy fake rock tune: \\"The back of my legs, stickin' to the pleatheeeeer...\\"<br /><br />2. Its design is a crowded gathering of bad ideas.<br /><br />The Marware Exchange Case Cover with Stand for Kindle Fire<br /> is a case with an integrated stand only here, it just isn't done well.<br /><br />Its stand  works by folding the cover backwards over a couple of hinged folds and sticking the end into a tab sewn to the back of the cover. You have to pry up the notch to get the end of the cover under it (with possible long-term wear issues that will make it look worse faster), but there's another blunderiffic factor in play: the Marware Exchange Case Cover has pockets and slots designed for it to be used as a card-holder and wallet.<br /><br />And it is at this point that you wonder if its design is actually not a mistake but an accidental import intended for Krypton, Superman's home planet, where there was no poverty and no crime...<br /><br />Here on earth, the case-as-wallet idea is bad on a lot of levels, the least frightening of which is putting all your eggs in one basket and then showing everyone how valuable they are. It means that you are a one-stop shopping center for thieves who specialize in stealing from people in cafes; it means, if you have a bad day, and your case vanishes, the creep who took it gets it all--a nice, sellable Amazon Kindle, your credit cards, your cash, your business cards with your name and address on them...<br /><br />But wait, there's more!<br /><br />The cash pocket is shorter than a dollar bill is tall showing the top edges of the bills when the case is open and putting your credit/business cards in plain sight. Better still, when you use the stand, not only are all your valuables visible, but the bill-pocket is upside-down.<br /><br />Maybe this thing wasn't designed for Krypton: maybe it was cleverly designed for police sting operations to entrap thieves using an irresistable target stuffed with cash and credit cards.<br /><br />All told, this is weak product design at its worst--a collection of bad ideas that trip over one another to see which one can bite you first.<br /><br />3. Its soft magnet closure eliminates the need for an elastic strap that you can put over the back of your hand to help hold it.<br /><br />Now it's true; reading on an Amazon Kindle isn't so hard they made it part of Navy SEAL training, but like all tablets and readers, how you hold it is important because it can make  the reading experience better, and putting your hand under a strap makes things easier. The Marware Exchange Case Cover's approach removes a sound and useful feature.<br /><br />4. The bottom line: this thing is just plain bad.<br /><br />You can do better for your money. Marware makes other, more ambitious designs that look better, have better stands, provide better ergonomics and that close with an elastic band that doubles as a hand-strap.<br /><br />Buy one of them. They will make you happier.
B003JYOFIW|5.0|First off, you have to be familiar or at least like the group DEVO b4 buying this CD.  Fortunately I am a DEVO<br />fan.  Therefore, this CD rocks for me.

B0018QQQK8|5.0|Really enjoyed reading.  Was perplexed at some of the views saying it wasn't good,,,, so didn't expect it to be as good as it was.  Am ready to read another by Nicholas : )
B007C4ZJ0S|1.0|(1.) Most of the movie didn't make any sense and it required the final scenes to piece it all together. The \\"Let's make it jump all over the place confusing.\\" technique is to show how intelligent the writer and director are while keeping the audience guessing about what's going on for as long as possible. Poorly thought out e.g. in the beginning she's doesn't take or disable her pursuer's car so that he can't chase her but grab's some stranger and his car. The rest of the movie was typical Hollywood actors making dumb decisions courtesy of writers who lead sheltered lives.<br />(2.) Production: Dialogue had a low quality echoey sound. Background music was a loud, overbearing and aggravating. A cheap substitute to compensate for poor storyline. Cinematography and camera settings such as color palette looked washed out with a greenish tone.<br />(3.) Self indulgent editing and directing. Two examples: A foot chase scene and later a fight scene each utilized between six and ten different camera angles while annoyingly constantly switching amongst the angles. Viewing from the bottom, top, sides all looked artificial and was a pointless distraction. Also nauseating.<br />(4.) Acting was of the type where you sign up a few big names (they agree because they had nothing to do for a day and it's good money); the resulting  commitment to naturalism is to read lines like actors portraying actors.  Also looked non-commital and artificial.<br />(5.) A rip off of the \\"Girl with ...\\" and \\"Girl Who ...\\" \\"Kick-Ass\\", \\"Hanna\\" movies with Carano in \\"Haywire\\" as Mallory Kane and was not at all convincing, especially in comparison to Rapace, Moretz, Ronan in their roles. The problem is not so much in whether Carano knows her kicks and punches but in the editing and filming where people dramatically start falling before they're hit and her not emotionally conveying an interesting, believable character.

B005IQZB14|5.0|I am very close to finishing this book.  Without knowing the ending, I can say at this point that I feel like I have been on the trail taking each step with the author.  I am throughly enjoying this true story of a confused, conficted but interesting young woman.  Her courage to take on the PCT alone in a monumental effort to regain control over her runaway life makes for a very good read. As I am closing in on the end of her journey I shall continue to worry for her safety, fret over her risky decisions, past and present and experience her growth. The author has a gift for bringing her readers along for the ride in an entertaining, never boring, extremely realistic way.  My body hurt as I pictured the state of hers right down to my need to try a Snapple lemonade!  I recommend this story to adults of all ages.
B007OAAK0O|5.0|Watch as the most Successful Female Artist of all time takes Central Park by Storm (literally) Its a battle between Mother Nature and the Mother of all wannabee Divas! Ross creates a visually stunning dynamic and dramtic effect as she braves a torrential rain storm and winds blowing at nearly 50mph. The Supreme Goddess proves on this hot summer night in July 1983 NYC just what the word **SUPERSTAR** truly means. Diana Ross is a treasure beyond words known all around the world. I'm so thrilled this concert is finally being released on DVD for all to witness once again the Magic that is Diana Ross.
044024630X|2.0|I had never read a Lee Child novel featuring Jack Reacher before, but have enjoyed adventure/action/crime stories written by other well known authors in this genre. The opening chapter was well written and certainly hooked me in. Why doesn't Reacher get arrested when he goes to the pentagon? What is his goal or purpose for meeting with the Senate Liaison Officer? I thought this was going to be an entertaining and fast paced read, but as the book continued I came to realize that Reacher was super human. He is sent on a mission to solve a murder mystery in Carter Crossing, Mississippi where he reluctantly teams up with the beautiful county sheriff Elizabeth Deveraux. He promptly beds her (it takes him all of two days), manages to beat up six Mississippi goons who have come to rough him up, kills a paramilitary person guarding camp Kelham, kills the Senate Liaison Officer when we return back to the pentagon (opening sequence) and then makes it look like a suicide, solves the murder mystery (there are more beautiful women murdered), and does away with the murderers(you will have to read it to find out how).  I think that Child should have emblazoned an M across Reacher's chest for Macho Man. Reacher leaves the scent of cast off testosterone throughout the book, it oozes out of his pores. If you liked Superman comics, the Hulk, or Iron-man you will enjoy it.  If you like your characters more realistic and simply human, than skip this one.
0345803485|1.0|I had to see what all the fuss was about in women's circles. Fifty Shades was boring, poorly written, and not worth the $10. One star for having the audacity to publish this high school narative.
B005EGXTEE|5.0|I loved this book so much, I hardly spoke to my husband for 3 nights, I couldn't put it down.  Best book I've read for ages.  Reading it now for a second time just to make sure I didn't miss anything.
B005HSL626|5.0|fruit ninjas is the best game and whoo ever made that game it is the best in everything we do just like shut up,....................
B00127RAJY|1.0|I just finished my first week and so far I lost 5lbs and thats not the best part my pants are fitting looser thats a great feeling! Make sure you listen to her  and pay attention when she talks about moves that might strain your knees...focus and dont slack up....UPDATE:::I really love the 30 day shred i think Jillian is amazing so this really isn't about her its about the low quality of the dvd itself it cracked in the middle circular part ...so disappointed but so far I have dropped 20lbs the workout is wonderful
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|Expected more but got less.  This was my least favorite of the series.  Most of the book, Katniss was injured and then recovering.
B0080N6AVC|5.0|Finally...Welcome back Castiel!!! His character has been too long missed this season. I hope they make more use of him in the coming future. This take on the character as slightly flawed/insane and off-kilter is well played by Misha Collins. Never write this guy off of Supernatural. Not with his fan base and the venues he brings to the series!!!!!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|It's like a train picking up steam.  Starts off good and just gets better and better.  I thought that a inexpensive series couldn't possibly be as good as a normal priced series.  I was wrong.  This author is incredible.  Buy this series and everything else by this author.  You won't regret it.
B007M6P01O|5.0|AWESOME!!! I love this show and the finale did not disappoint. I say keep those walkers walking and look forward to some new characters adding even more fan to the flame of this series.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I downloaded the book without having researched the content enough; also being fooled by the fact that it was on the New York Times best seller list. I am really sorry to be part of the statistics of women down-loading this book. It is a very poor read (cannot even label it literature), which was not able to evoke any type of eroticism in me, which first made me wonder, as it is talked up to be such a turn-on. But I am glad to know, that I am not the only one feeling this way. Any little inkling of an erotic feeling was very quickly grounded out by the female protagonist projecting her thoughts like \\"holy crap\\" unto the page among other such deflating expressions and of course the violence. The repetitions of expressions, such as eye rolling, the mouth being a hard straight line etc, etc, were yawn producing.<br />The story line of Christian, the main protagonist, being so young and shown to be totally in charge of a conglomerate, is hard to believe. The virgin college student Anastasia turns out to not be a very interesting person and the fact that she puts so much importance on the looks of Christian is nauseating and makes her very shallow indeed. Well, I forced myself to finish the book to be able to put forth an opinion in the frenzy surrounding this book. I find it very sad for women to be depicted as bondage items. I totally agree with Dr. Drew, that this book sets women back many decades. Would I buy the other 2 books in the trilogy? Absolutely NOT! I have nothing against erotic books, but this one is trash. I really encourage other women, who feel like me to state their opinion openly. Where are we going with this?
B005SZAEYO|4.0|Well...what can a gal say...WOW. I was surprised by the strangeness and creepiness along with some of the unexpected twists. I am not a slasher/gore horror fan, but I love good horror when it's well done with acting, dialogue, suspense, and originality. Footnote...Jessica Lange takes the CAKE !
B0054JZC6E|3.0|this is a fun game yo play when I am bored. it keeps me entertain and time goes quickly. have fun!
B007Q914WG|5.0|No one and I mean no one beats Supernatural. Hands down the best sci-fi/Fantasy/Horror show going today. This episode really showed off the humor that these actors can play off one another. Their chemistry and the story line was GREAT! Party On Supernatural !!!
B000HT3PPG|5.0|Wonderful Christmas Classic for those young at heart!  What's there not to love about Natalie Wood!  One of her early favorites.  You and your little one's will enjoy this family classic.
B007Q2N0HA|5.0|Similar to 50 Shades, which is why I wanted to read it, however it definitely had it's differences. I really loved it and can't wait for the 2nd one!
0345803485|1.0|Yes, I love soft porn that is well written with development of the characters and their relationships.  This is just outright poorly written.  I found myself skipping sentences in the first 20 pages, whole paragraphs in the second 20 pages, and  then whole pages.  Quit 1/3 of the way in.  Glad I didn't purchase.
B006WWTKQ0|4.0|lovely movie it was like being there in 3-D i did like the first one a little bit better.but i will be watching this movie a number of times over loved the cast,music and of coarse the charactor's old and new. thanks aussie willie
0823013626|5.0|Not your run of the mill 'how to' book on polymer clay, this book offers interesting techniques and projects.<br />Well illustrated with easy to understand instructions.  Donna Kato, author, is excellent.  This book is well worth the price I paid!

B007IQX1G4|1.0|Although we all like to see the pretty people fail, mental breakdowns are not very amusing when they hit the two hour mark.  You will need Xanax to recover from this movie.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I love it. But everytime I play a game there is an add. It very hard to play because of that.
B003VWU2WA|4.0|I pretty much love it. There were some problems figuring out how exactly how it worked, and I have to disable/enable num lock for certain programs, but otherwise works great!
B003ASLJK4|5.0|This is Clint Eastwood and Meryl Streep at their best.  If you like adult romance stories this is the one you want to purchase and place in your DVD library. I watched this DVD on my HD big screen and it was like watching a real personal love story up close.
B003PBB4ME|4.0|Not only does it help steady, it has a screw on the bottom to attach to a tripod and a mount on top to attach other things! Fantastic as I see it.
B007V5CF5K|4.0|Nice app...love the music it is upbeat and not boring. The game is interesting, some is easy and some more difficult.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Glad they have this as a free app! And it is so fun and addicting! Played a game like this a while back on bored.com, this type of game is really fun, simple, and addicting! lol  So cute.
B0080SZ0V8|3.0|Just started this game and I'm almost done with all the parts. Some is simple, but some are difficult. Must finish each round in a time limit setting. I guess I expected a little more variety than this.
B0067Q42BY|3.0|the game is interesting but it frequently freezes for no reason and i cannot adjust volume from options menu i need to adjust the master volume to mute the game
B007M45PMU|4.0|This album really surprised me!<br />I really enjoy every single track except for 1 or 2 (I believe the last 2 on the album).<br />I would actually rate this CD a 4.5 out of 5 if I could.<br /><br />\\"Ho Hey\\", \\"Dead Sea\\", \\"Submarines\\", and \\"Big Parade\\" are my favorites so far.  But really I tend to listen to the entire CD except for last track.<br />\\"Big Parade\\" in particular is the most visual song I've heard in a while.  I normally don't pay much attention to lyrics, but that would be doing an injustice to this song.  I love the imagery, the lyrical content, and the style.<br />Something about \\"Submarine\\" is amazing as well, and I can't quite put my finger on it.<br /><br />The sound is great.  I think if you enjoy The Head and the Heart's self-titled album, you'll enjoy this CD, but that's not a perfect comparison.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This app is very entertaining and easy to use. I also enjoy the different deck design options. Great way to kill time!
B0054JZC6E|3.0|the game is fun. a lot of different games to play.  keeps you entertained. can't wait to get to get to the next levels
0525478817|4.0|Before I get into the meat of my criticisms, let me start by saying that The Fault in Our Stars by John Green is a beautiful, emotionally touching book.  It's identified as a young adult novel, but I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to just about anyone.  It's a worthwhile read.<br /><br />But as good as the book can be, there are a couple of faults worth noting.  The first of which is John Green's voice for lead character Hazel Grace.  She's written as a sixteen year old girl, yet her vocabulary far exceeds that of a moderately intelligent adult.  Reading some of the dialog between her and her boyfriend Augustus felt like watching an episode of Gilmore Girls.  That's not a good thing.<br /><br />The relationship between Hazel and Augustus is a believable one.  They rely on each other for strength as they both cope with having cancer.  It's refreshing that both characters recognize the hopelessness of their situations, and reflect on life rather than blame the world.<br /><br />But towards the end of the book, a series of completely unbelievable events occur.  From the use of the Make A Wish Foundation, to the wacky actions of an alcoholic author, things just aren't believable.  These events take the reader out of the story, and moments which should tug on your heartstrings do less so because of them.  It's a shame, because without these moments, The Fault in Our Stars is near perfect in creating a bond between the reader and the characters.

B0072OFM28|5.0|I really enjoyed this season, i had my doubt's at first. I loved Andy Warfield and was so sad to hear he passed away.the new guy had big shoes to fill,and i think he did a very good job. Looking forward to the next season, let's give this guy a chance to get to know him, and base how we feel on his ability and not Andy W arfield's role.
B007N5YIUS|1.0|This would be a fun game if you could actually play it. it freezes and force closes every other level. I have loaded it twice &amp; both times have experienced the same issues. Frustrating to say the least. Please fix Rovio.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love how easy the games are. If you don't like one of the games, you could play a different one.
1469984202|5.0|I have been reading science fiction since 1966 and if I were to rank the 1000+ books and stories I have read in the genre, I would have to place Wool in my top five.<br /><br />I will begin with the obligatory (or, at least, courteous) SPOILER ALERT, on the off chance that a potential purchaser who reads five star reviews (I don't) will choose to read mine over the other 600+ five star ones that have been written to date. Personally, I ignore five star reviews when shopping for books since I assume they were written by the author's friends (although, in this case, OK, I get that nobody has 600 friends, at least not 600 friends willing to write a review.) Instead I read the one and two star reviews to see what it was that made the reader dislike the story to decide if that issue would bother me too. More on that later.<br /><br />Anyway, having protected the potential buyer from the trauma of spoilers, I will address the rest of this review to the author.<br /><br />Dear Hugh,<br />I am very glad you sold this as a collection. I needed the hope that with 93% of the collection to go, you would make it up to me for making me care so deeply about Holston that I mourned for him when he died. (Yes, potential reader who has chosen to ignore the spoiler alert, this author makes you care deeply about several characters and then kills them off!) I also loved and then mourned Mayor Jahns in Wool 2. Ditto for Deputy Marnes in Wool 3. And you horrified me by starting Wool 3 with Juliette in the airlock! But at that point there was 79% of the work to go so I was hopeful...and completely hooked.<br /><br />Hugh, you are a master at making people care about your characters to the point that the readers feel as if they have actually lost a friend when the character dies.<br /><br />I don't recall what made me add this to my Kindle collection, let alone what made me purchase it. All but 28 of the 330 books I have on my Kindle were free; and of the 28 I paid for, 27 were by authors whose books I had previously bought in hardcover or paperback.  It may have been that WOOL showed up repeatedly in a blog I follow and while I was reading the 1 & 2 star reviews I could not help but notice the sheer quantity of positive reviews. So between the intriguing description and the plethora of stars, I took a chance...... and struck gold!<br /><br />Now about those 1 & 2 star complaints: yes, I skimmed parts I knew would keep me from sleeping (I have horror of drowning) and I skimmed battles knowing that characters I had come to care about would die because that's what happens in a rebellion, but that was me protecting myself from emotional overload. So, should you shorten those parts? No. The story does not need to be \\"moved along.\\" It's not a half hour TV sitcom. When events play out almost in real time, it adds to the desperation of the situation.<br /><br />Since there were so few ones and twos, I read some threes and I disagree with some criticisms there. One reader insists that there would have been elevators, but most people in the silo, having been told all of their lives by the priests that God had created the silo, would never even think of challenging that; and if someone with mechanical aptitude did think of it and pushed to be allowed to build one, they would be killed- as George was when he pushed for using the diggers.<br /><br />Another criticized the lack of a murder investigation. That was covered. It would have been pointless- Marnes realized who held the power. He would not have been able to bring the killer to justice.<br /><br />I have never written a review so I imagine I am way over the word limit; this may end up as a letter instead, but I wanted to add that Lukas is not good enough for Juliette. I admired how you put Lukas in a position where he is learning about how the silo societies came to be and how they are designed to function so that the reader can learn the back story too, but had you killed him off I would not have mourned.Juliette cares about him, though, and he can be useful to her in continuing to research the truth so she can share the truth with the inhabitants of the silo, so OK, he gets to live.....but, I repeat, Juliette deserves better. Later when you explore the other silos and a character emerges who is worthy of her, you may kill off Lukas.<br /><br />Looking forward to buying and reading more of your silo stories, so get busy.<br />Sincerely,<br />Connie
B000NTPDSW|5.0|If you have grown up watching The Godfather Saga, you will like this collection.  It's a great collection at a very good price.  Just a little note, not all Italians are members of the mafia, as a matter of fact, very few are.  I'm Italian and before I got married to my husband, my mother-in-law asked me if I had a Godfather.  Having been raised a Catholic, I said yes.  Her next question was, does he always carry a gun?  I looked at my soon to be husband because I was confused, and he said she had just seen the Godfather movie and was refering to a mafia Godfather.  I assured her that my Godfather happened to be my baptisimal Godfather in the Catholic Church.  Thought you might like this true story.  I still laugh when I remember the look on my mother-in-laws face when I told her I had a Godfather.
B000Y5JFNY|3.0|I got this as a gift for my mother on Mother's Day, and while the product itself was great. (She loved all of the various extras it came with - books, music box, music soundtrack, etc.) the actual blue velvet box it came in was badly damaged upon arrival. Since I had ordered this just over a month ago and didn't open it (since it was a gift for someone else), the return window had already closed, and Amazon will not let me exchange the item for an undamaged one. It's not amazon's fault that the box was damaged as their shipping box was in good condition, but the damaged interior product made for a lackluster presentation of a gift to my mom on Mother's Day. So just be careful when ordering this product. (Otherwise it's a great gift for anyone who is a fan of The Sound of Music.)

B006QR2888|2.0|Two discs approximately 45 minutes in length each.  Standard plastic double jewel case.  The 2 page booklet contains several paragraphs on the period when this album was recorded, and about half a page on the mono version of this album.  Specifically that Columbia Records released both a mono and stereo version of the album, and the mono tapes were subsequently lost/discarded.  But the notes don't say specifically what source was used for this edition-LP?  Listening with good headphones, this is  a vinyl album  used as the transfer medium-if the mono tapes are long gone, what else could it be?  It's an okay pressing/source as far as vinyl goes-but it is a vinyl source, so beware.  And I do hear what sounds like sonic anomalies beginning at 4-5 minutes on the first track (and occasionally after that) of the mono version.  There's also slight differences in all track timings between the mono and stereo versions, which isn't unusual.  The 2 \\"stars\\" is for the less than perfect sound (especially) on the mono disc (taken from an okay vinyl source)-you may rate this album lower-to each his own.  This is probably closer to 2-2 1/2 \\"stars\\".  But the music itself is unassailable-a classic album of music.<br /><br />The mono version seems a bit fuller, while the stereo version seems a bit brighter.  Perhaps that's because of the separation in stereo gives an openness to the sound.  Perhaps it's because if this is truly the \\"original\\" album-with uncorrected speed (the notes don't make it expressly clear) it causes the horns to sound a bit brighter than they should.  Listening to the Sony/Columbia Deluxe Edition of this album, the stereo sound (adjusting for volume), doesn't seem to be much different from this release.  The mono version (allowing for a low quality source) is full, clean and warm, but it lacks that open punch.  Sound is so subjective that it's probably wise to hear this release yourself.  But if the slight \\"clicks\\" I hear, or the less than great overall vinyl source put you off, you may want to pass on this edition.  But if not, I know, another edition of this album around the house. But to hear this album in (less than good) monaural sound, and the low price, makes this worth considering purchasing.  But I wish someone would release a good mono version of this album from a better (good) source.<br /><br />Not much else to say about this seminal album.  Most people, even non-jazz fans, have either heard portions of and/or own this album.  This is a nice, neat package, making it easy to hear both the mono and stereo versions back to back.  Plus it's pretty cool to have both \\"original\\" versions at your fingertips I suppose.  Just know what you're getting before you purchase this.  If good sound is a great concern-pass this by.urce put you off, you may want to pass on this edition.  But if not, I know, another edition of this album around the house.

B004EPYZQC|3.0|Of course you have to suspend your disbelief to enjoy the films that make up the Fast & Furious franchise. The first four made for an exhilirating theatrical ride. The 5th installment was just too ridiculous even for the most vivid of imaginations. The gang of loveable lawbreakers were pretty much transformed into a squadron of super heroes who can take on any army...in this case, the Rio Police Department. The movie trailer has already shown us parts of the infamous action sequence where Diesel and Walker drive off a cliff, manage to seperate themselves from the car in mid air, and land unscathed in a lake (there should've been a pair shark fins protruding from the water, if ya' catch my drift.) I won't spoil the ending, but since when were those fast little cars known for their towing capabilities? Positive Notes: the stunts and CGI were exciting. It was nice to see Tyrese, Ludacris, and Jordana Brewster come back, and Dwayne Johnson was a great addition.
B001E907I6|1.0|The movie is so boring.  I don't care about the subliminal messages that it has about the characters & that we are and do what we say we won't.  Not worth being bored.  It's so slow paced that it renders any point being made worthless!
B0054JZC6E|3.0|seems ok to. nothing big. just easy games to stay busy. said I could get free points to buy more if I do this. ads haven't bothered me

B007J4T2G8|1.0|All romance novels have an alpha, Fabio-esque male and an innocent, naive heroine. I give the author prop$ for adding BDSM as a 'hook'. Having said that, I weep for the real writers that spend months, years producing well researched and thoughtful literature and receive nothing in return. 1star='prop$'
B007J4T2G8|5.0|The book was so consuming - I read it in 2 days.  A MUST read !!  It is a bit naughty, but the story itself is so well written, I am already sad there are only 3 books in the series.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|the set was awesome it packed nicely although it arrived late ..<br />the dvd itself is worth buying for because i got this dvd for $60 (includes the shipping ) and it is really rare dvd set here in the philippines ,the cd is well made .. i love the cover ..
B007Z9QWVK|5.0|I don't care what the critics and would be critics say I very much enjoyed the film and recommend it to anyone who appreciates a well crafted film with excellent actors and beautiful costumes/sets. If you need a completely clear story try a disney movie instead, this was a wonderful slice of the full story not a full docudrama. Madonna did an excellent job as director and really set the mood well, I think this is worth giving it a try if you want something different.

In my department, three of my co-workers have been following Gary's regimen for a longer period than myself and I knew they were on to something as I noticed their weight loss. I read the book and, as an engineer, I saw the sense and reasoning that went into Gary's explanations for \\"Why we get fat...\\" and decided to use its principles as a way of life.  I have lost 15 pounds in four weeks without ever feeling hungry or adopting a strenous exercise routine.

If you love Legend then you will love this copy. I had to send my first order back tho because the disc skipped on a certain part of the movie, after cleaning it and trying again with the same result I had it exchanged. The process went smooth and my new copy works perfectly. There was no need to take a star off and I'm happy to have one of my favorite movies back in my collection.

1594744475|5.0|I got this book to add to several others that I had purchased for my wife to expand her bento box recipes and she thoroughly enjoys it. It is a bit more on the kiddish side but that is why I got it. It focuses more on making cute and very neat eye candy dishes rather than your traditional bento but sometimes that's just what you need to liven up your day. If you want to put a smile on someones face then you can't go wrong with these dishes!
B0009PAVI2|1.0|I just got this item, put my B+W MRC filters in it. took them out after a few hours, and there were markings all over the circular polarizing filter. They were NOT there before, since the filters are also brand new. The fabric inside this item is not soft enough and I fear it might damage my filters, so I will be returning this item back.
1568363931|5.0|I got this book for my wife to add to several other bento books she had. Out of all of them this one is definitely the most down to earth, it focuses on healthy nutritious bento dishes and skips out on the cutesy aspects that some bentos strive for. If you want a nice well put together bento meal without all the bells and whistles of other more kiddish eye candy dishes then grab this book and start cooking!
B005LAIGOQ|5.0|My kind of movie!  No blood, guts, or gore like the movies they make now.  Just nice and scary!  The Woman is Black is one of the BEST movies I have seen in some time.  Daniel made you forget about him being Harry Potter is this movie.  I hope that he makes more movies like this one for those of us who are not of the Harry Potter age.  While watching this movie, I could see Daniel portraying the character of Quentin Collins from the Dark Shadows ORIGINAL TV series.  David Selby played that character.<br />Great job Daniel!  I jumped several times throughout the movie!
B004QXJZXA|5.0|Le Mans, the movie is only for those who appreciate car racing ... little movie-type plot.  But the views, cinematography are wonderful in Blu-ray.  The movie was for my husband, but I honestly enjoyed watching it too.
B005LAIHKY|3.0|I consider myself a Tim Burton fan, but even I will admit that he has had more stinkers than gems over the last decade. This is somewhere in the middle. Johnny Depp, in his eight outing with Burton, turns in his typical weird creation, but I really enjoyed him in this vampire role. Eva Green makes for a sexy villain. The rest of the cast, set design, atmosphere and 70's tunes are strong as well, but the story really goes nowhere. There are some clever gags and dialogue that kept things interesting, so I was never truly bored. I liked enough about it to say that Dark Shadows is worth a Blu-ray rental. Go see The Avengers again or save your money for The Dark Knight Rises.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I like this game because you can go to the shop and I might even put it on my favorites bar
B0000041LA|5.0|Many can press keys, some can even play the piano, but to give colour, sentiment and subtlety interpretation of the composer message you need someone like Vladimir Ashkenazy.  My favourite pianist. Suggest to listen to his playing of Beethoven's Moonlight sonata.
0439023521|1.0|I would like to point out how much Suzanne Collins has stolen from Koushun Takami's Battle Royal (1999). Both take place in an alternate future that is ruled by a iron fisted government. Both governments require a annual competition were children kill each other. The most obvious is the similarities with each are with there respective cast.<br /><br />Katniss- Shuya. protagonist of the series.<br />Peeta- Noriko. the protagonist's companion. both get a leg wound that gets infected and require Katniss/ Shuya to find medicine. Both survive the Hunger games/ Battle royal.<br />Haymitch Abernathy- Shogo. both were in a previous Hunger games/Battle royal and won. both spent there time trying to help the protagonist and Peeta /Noriko survived.<br />Gale- Shinji. both are resist the government . Also both are held in high regard by the protagonists.<br />Rue- no one!  Rue is the only character in hunger games that is not copy from Battle royal but she strongly resembles Yukie because that she cares for the protagonist and died protecting Katniss/ Shuya.<br />Foxface- Mitsuko easy, these characters are Identical. both are the female threat of Hunger games/ battle royal. both use trickery to there advantage. Mitsuko uses trickery to gain trust and kill people, Foxface lets every one else do the killing. Both were the fit to last.<br />Cato- Kazou. ok even there names are almost identical. Both are the antagonist of the Hunger games/ Battle royal respectively. both have no respect for human life and are willing to kill at all costs. Both of these characters have a gang of \\"friends\\" that they are teamed up with but unlike Cato  who stuck with his group Kazou just killed them all.<br />Thresh- Hiroki. both when find the protagonist do not attack them. Hiroki spent the book trying to find Kayoko. Thresh then lets Katniss live because she helped Rue. Both also fight the main threat of the book Cato/ Kazou nee the end of the book but Hiroki, unlike Thresh, survives the encounter<br />Crane- Kinpatsu. painfully obvious similarities. both are hight ranking government officials that monitor and announce the events of the hunger games/ battle royal respectively.<br /><br />Battle Royal is not the only book with this concept: the \\"Most Dangerous Game\\" \\"The Lottery\\" are a few examples.<br /><br />Most deaths in hunger games were unobserved and the ones that were poorly described. Thresh was unexpected killed off screen, wile he had little character development he still was in the final four remaining contestants and deceived even the slights description of what happened. Now, you may think think this make the book more appropriate than Battle Royal but sadly as the book is already bloody and twisted and all editing out the death description does is make the target audience lower a lower age. I don't wan't you to think that I like bloody and gory deaths but in a book all about death editing it out and having characters kill without the smallest description just makes it worse.  Another minor similarity is books end with the protagonists on a train.<br /><br />Really Collins, you are a professional author please write your own stories.
B007V5CF5K|5.0|It was a nice length.... normally I can stay up and finish a game in a few hours. This one took a little longer, now my daughter is playing it. I would play it again, myself. It makes u put on ur thinking cap. Well worth the 99&cent;.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|this game is a lot of fun.. very addicting.no problems at all. get coins and advance levels very quit k . good job. o it is one of my favorite movies as well. great graphics. a d fun interactive games.
B004SJ3AXI|2.0|angry birds space is better and probably has better graphics I have seen how good they are on the kindle yet but they are good on the ipod touch and iphone.
1589944607|5.0|The game pieces are good quality. I was impressed.<br />The game is thematically true to the series, and captures the atmosphere well. Though the rule book looks intimidating at first, once you start to play, it all comes together in a very real way. The game is incredibly exciting. I highly recommend.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this is so awesome the games are very challenging and it fun because you get to enjoy a lot of games in one
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|This game is so much fun.I found it out from my friend and wuz so amazed because it really wuz what I expected and it wasn't. I luv this game because where learning about the Oregon trail in school.omg luv it
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book it one of the best that had me hook form the first word to the last. I love this book n I recommend to all my friend n thank my friend miss Genna who told me about it. I am in awa of this book I read it back twice already. I just can it wait for Christian version. If her was so omg. What is his going to b like. Ider what can't wait.
0307949508|3.0|I'm giving the book a 3 star review, although I have not finished it.  I blew through the first book in the series, Girl With the Dragon Tattoo, in less than a week but having trouble focusing on this one.  The Girl Who Played with Fire seems to drag on, not the edge of your seat suspense found in the first book. Was expecting a lot more from this book.
B005TVYVI2|1.0|I received the monitor on time.  However, it became defective within a few days after I received it.  The problem was a short in the battery compartment (the battery was not securely held in the battery compartment.  This led to on-off operation.  The real problem was with trying to obtain a replacement unit.  It took at least five days to get it resolved.  That was very upsetting.  As I am writing this comment, the replacement unit is making its way across the country.  I should receive it sometime this week.  That is not good customer service.
B003F3NEBG|5.0|The blue ray format provided such a lively and wonderfull expirience The serie simply captures you complettly , the Amazon service was great since ii purchased it from abroad the US .I highly recomend the product and the Amazon service.
0451169514|5.0|This is one of my fave books by SK - love the whole book and also love the movie just as much, which is unusual for me!
B007V5CF5K|5.0|super game right from the beginng.  I did have difficulty with downloading but it was worth the wait.  the graphics are really great.
B007Z9RAX4|3.0|It isn't awful, but it also isn't great.  The burned agent story has been done a million times, so it's about how you do it.  SALT may have had a lot of flashy editing during the fight scenes but there was tension and suspense and adrenaline.  This may of had realistic fight scenes but it was so flat.  There was danger, but with a jazz track running underneath the action - the danger had no teeth.  With a name like Haywire, one would expect some crazy action scenes and a lot of blood, but this was just so... tame.  And calm and dull.<br /><br />I read an interview where SS said they electronically altered her voice - I wonder how bad her acting was with her real voice.<br /><br />The most I can really say is that I saw it... and meh.
B0068TJLSY|5.0|Surprisingly better than expected, began a little slow, but after the movie elapsed a little, the movie kept our attention throughout.  Good drama and plot.  Overall a good movie.
B000002TP7|5.0|this item came super quick and was exactly what i was wanting for a great price. would buy again. i was taken back buying this cd because it reminded me of my teenage years
B0070NSPCU|5.0|There is a reason why everyone has given this book 5 stars. The reason is because this book is fantastic.  It's well written, great character development, a great story, and it's a book you can't put down.  I am lucky to have found another great author. I now eagerly await the next book in the series!  If you enjoy fantasy you will love this book!
B0070Z4M4I|1.0|This is the worst movie ever and it was such a waste of time. I wonder why so many people have given it such high rating......
B00007KWHP|5.0|This is a great remaster of the album of Fragile.I would highly recomend this to your collection it's awsome! I think this is the best early album of yes
B0015DYIH2|5.0|This book is great for all ages. Both my daughter and I loved it! I don't like romance novels and don't think it falls into that category.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|The Trilogy was as entertaining as promised by all of the media hype.  I shared the books with two friends, and we've all giggled over coffee each morning.
0385510454|1.0|Terrible ending. Guy hides out in Italy. Boring.  It is though the author got tired of it at the end.  Was waiting for Sammy Tin to show up but he never did.
B000TRSAAG|4.0|Dexter Gordon provides some real smooth sounds on this disc, doing a few standards that are timeless, e.g., A Night In Tunisia, Willow Weep For Me, Stairway To The Stars ...and more. Can't go wrong with Bud Powell on piano, along with Kenny Clarke and Pierre Michelot sitting in. Just some straight-ahead jazz that doesn't miss a beat.  If you know Dexter Gordon's horn, (that clean, full tone), than you're going to like \\"Our Man In Paris.\\"
B007IE4DTU|5.0|Although some reviewers and people I've talked to felt there were many aspects of George's life missing from the documentary, I don't feel the same way.  It's impossible to include every important aspect of a person's life in a documentary; if you tried that the film would be very, very long.  To me, a documentary should give you an insight into the person documented.  I think this film does that.  I stepped away from this film feeling I knew and understood George Harrison better.<br /><br />There were many stills and video clips I had never seen ---- and being a huge Beatle fan I thought I had seen just about everything.  I was thrilled to have had a chance to see some private family videos and stills.  So there is something in this film for every one.  Those who have only a passing knowledge of George Harrison and the Beatles, and those who are big fans will find something new and interesting in this documentary.<br /><br />Coincidentally, I'm going through a time in my life where I'm examining \\"the meaning of life\\" and what really matters.  This film reaffirms what I'm already beginning to understand.  For me, the material world doesn't matter.  The love you give and receive in life is what matters in the end.<br /><br />The end of this documentary film brought me to tears; both tears of sadness and tears of joy.  It's a wonderful touching film and I highly recommend it ----- \\"and in the end the love you take is equal to the love you make\\".
1609611543|4.0|Excellent and amazing information. A little technical for me but it is a must read for people interested in their health.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Great product, works well with my Acer tablet. I have a kindle fire and theuality is the same. Also works well on kindle for PC.
B007XKEY6Q|1.0|the wait is so long. you have to wait however long until they do it. 1 out of five for sure. do not download

B0063IH60K|5.0|Pick your level and play.  Great way to keep engaged.  I'm in an airport with a delayed flight but this solitaire game has made me not care about the late arrival.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|really addicting. couldn't stop playing the game I like the different challenges. I wish there were more. will continue to play
B007V5CF5K|4.0|It...... it seems. to take a reaaaaaaaaally long time to download it's resources.... otherwise, I think it's. gonna be a great game.
B0072GPQ72|5.0|this is a great movie!! not for young kids but this title itself tells you why. i loved the movie more than my husband did but he still felt like it was good.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|this is as close to Mario as you can without literally being Mario I really eenjoyed this game and its free soo worth it
B004UFEJS0|5.0|our kids love this movie and watch it over and over again. What a great movie to watch as  a family. yes, everyone can cook!!
B007V2UGPE|5.0|a solid good game a little hard and you kinds have to scrounge for points but other than that its awsome
B000E97X66|5.0|&#34;How's things going over here in England and all?&#34;<br /><br />And so asks a somewhat giddy Bruce Springsteen in late 1975 as he addresses the audience at the Hammersmith Odeon, adding that this was his first time in England: &#34;I've never been here before!&#34; First time or not, nervous or not, you can't tell from this lively performance: Springsteen and his band are on fire throughout! I won't rehash the songs, suffice to say that it offers the highlights from his first three studio albums, plus a few concert encore favorites such as the &#34;Detroit Medley&#34; and &#34;Quarter To Three.&#34; Feel the sweat and love it!<br /><br />Ah, these early years of Springsteen and the E Street Band. Magical, wonderful, radiant years. In my mind, the 1970s were when he made his best and most vital music and this double CD has some great early-period Springsteen songs, all of them punctuated by Clarence's vibrant sax playing. These live recordings really embody what was so wonderful, and vital, about Springsteen in those early days, before &#34;Born in the USA&#34; flooded the airwaves and he became a video staple on MTV. Listen to these performances and the listener can not only feel the energy and the enthusiam, but the sincerity of it all too. Bruce lived these songs, he felt these songs. But listening to this concert also shows that it wasn't just Bruce's songs and charisma that thrilled audiences; it was a band effort.<br /><br />Listen to these songs, smile and remember the greatness of Bruce, Clarence, and the band. This album is nothing but a brilliant rock and roll performance.
B0064T6LV8|4.0|good way to pass da time if yo bored.ALSO, best for the kindle fire!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I suggest this for anyone who's bored.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|best game everr and cant stop playing it. its like super miro but no as good close but not perfect....
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love this app. I have not had any problems with it at all. I think everyone needs to use this app.
B0055SWM08|5.0|this is a great, fun, challenging game that lets you solve puzzles with smooth graphics and soothing music.  Getting a prefect score adds another level of difficulty
1416914285|4.0|***NOTE MY REVIEWS OFTEN CONTAIN SPOILERS***<br /><br />Clary Frays is just your average ordinary New York City teen, that is until the night she sees a boy murdered in a local night club.  She sees his body - blue black blood and then he disappears all together and she learns that she didn't witness the death of a boy, but the death of a Demon.  Jace Wayland is a Shadow Hunter, one of the nephillim and the idea of a mundane girl who can see through glamour fascinates him, but when he returns to investigate more, he learns Clary is not what she seems.  When he mother is kidnapped and she herself attacked by a demon he's the only one who can help her.  Clary is soon immersed in a world of Shadow Hunters, Downworlders and Demons in the search of a past she never knew she had.  But it's her mother's secrets and her mother's past that brought this danger to her life.  And it's those secrets that might not only kill her mother, but her too.  Can Clary find the answers she seeks and save her mother before it's too late for them all?<br /><br />This is my second time reading this novel.  I opened it again after I received an audio copy as a gift and figured listening to his might help me sleep.  It didn't help me sleep, only hooked me on the story all over again and left me too impatient to reach its end to finish listening to the story.  I've discovered I have no patience for audio books, they read entirely too slow for me.  Thankfully I had a hard cover copy already on my shelf.<br /><br />While the story did still hook me a second time, I also found I was able to distance myself and see flaws that I hadn't noticed before.  First the set up for this story bears a striking resemblance to Harry Potter.  She's a child whose been lied to about what she is, where she comes from and exactly what exists in the world around her.  Like Harry Potter, the creatures of the Mortal Instruments series exist among the world of humanity, but hidden from them through glamours.  While each creature has a different Mythology than Rowling's world, and this story itself is set in the US instead of the UK, the amount of similarities between the stories are astounding once you start noticing them. Are they carbon copies? No, not by any means, but they are similar enough in set up that it bears mentioning.  Clary is not the warrior rushing into danger prepared to take down any enemy as Harry Potter is.  And while Clary has abilities she never knew of she can by no means be described as the chosen one, nor does she stand apart as of yet from others of her kind due to uncommon abilities.  The story is also written to appeal to an older audience than Harry Potter because Clary is a teenage girl who has many of the interests, worries and attractions of your average teenage girl.<br /><br />The story also encompasses what I'd guess you'd call a love quintet that Clare throws a major sick twist into at the end of the novel.  And just for good measure there's a past love triangle thrown into the mix.  You have Clary's mother who was loved by two men - one good and one evil, though the darkness in either man was not evident when this occurred.  So she befriended the first and loved the second and in some ways that love triangle spiraled half the current events in the story.  Then our male lead Jace has at the very least two people attracted to if not in love with him.  Our female lead Clary has the same, one of which of course is the male lead.  And then we've got two additional characters thrown in attracted to each of the third wheels in both love triangles.  Love wise, this story is in a way, a confusing dramatic mess that speaks to the teenage girl in the heart of every woman.<br /><br />Between the fantasy, romantic and dramatic elements despite it similarities to other stories Clare has woven a story that's difficult to put down even on the second reading.  The story is fast paced with some sort of action packed dramatic moment on practically every page.  There's no denying the book is a well written page turner and when you think about it, it's not creating something extremely original plot that makes a good book, it's taking a plot and owning it.  What I mean by that is bringing your own voice and unforgettable characters to a plot and adding your own twists and turns to the journey.  It's taking a plot that's been seen and managing to make your own version memorable which is the mark of a good book and a talented writer.<br /><br />Though the characters have decent development, in this novel its makes clear that we've only seen the tip of the iceberg with who these characters really are in City of Bones.  Clare gives us enough to become attached to them, but in writing this kind of reminds us that you don't get to know anyone inside and out in a matter of days so she isn't going to allow you that luxury with her characters either.  None of the characters introduced in City of Bones are one dimensional and though I can't say I feel like I know everything about any of them they leap from the page with their different forms of inner turmoil and strife.  What she gives us of these characters leave a reader itching to know more and considering this is the first in a series of novels that's a good thing.<br /><br />Overall I'd definitely recommend this book to anyone who enjoys young adult romance or urban fantasy.  While I can't say it will appeal to all Harry Potter fans, I can say that many of the same fans will embrace Clary and Jace, aching for them in the same way they spend the last more than ten years aching and feeling for the boy who lived.ere's no denying the book is a well written page turner and when you think about it, it's not creating something extremely original plot that makes a good book, it's taking a plot and owning it.

0307352145|4.0|[...] by Susan Cain discusses how even though people are quiet they can make an impact on the world.  People are usually considered either extrovert or introverts, but she explains how some people can actually be both.  Some introverts are more comfortable in smaller settings but do speak and perform in larger groups when they feel they need to in order to excel.    It contains examples of high profile individuals of our time that are introverts and how they have made their successes.  It did contain quite a bit of scientific information that was difficult to concentrate on.  Even though, it was an interesting read.

0465068367|1.0|While this is definitely a story that needs to be told, this author is perhaps not the best one to be telling  it.  Her lack of  fundamental historical writing skills and her obviously, overly subjective view make her a poor candidate for writing about such an important event.  Her lack of footnotes is especially unsettling.  Footnotes, for those who seem to believe everything they read on the net, are crucial for separating fact from unsubstantiated rumor.  I have seen the sentence about \\"sons being forced to rape their mothers\\" in this book and the net, but not one footnote to substantiate it from fiction.  There are also a great many inconsistencies in this book.  For instance the author writes about how the women were killed after being raped, but later in the book muses about the many possible pregnancies of half Japanese children and suicides from these pregnancies.  She also states that no women was safe from rape regardless of age, but then later recounts how one girl escaped being raped by dressing as an old woman.  One of the few stories which she does seem to have documentation for she tells twice.  The authors' lack of chronological order for this book also makes it hard to read.  She does much better when dealing with authenticated third party information such as the written diary of Rabe.  I don't doubt that a great many of the things in this book are true, but to get a more objective account of what went on it might be better to read the diary of Rabe or some other scholarly piece of work on this subject.  I can not recommend this book as it falls into the category of sensational journalism (which by the way, was the authors' major - not history)
0439023513|4.0|4 stars because it really deserves more credit than people give it. I agree with this being a very realistic portrayal of events, thought I would have ended it differently...not romantically different, but would change how the revolution played out and who led it.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|ok my review is fact of all the time I had this app itt worked beautifully there were no problems at all the people who give it a bad review why? I mean I love this game so please if u are not sure get the game
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|I cant stop playing! I wish we could go to random peoples towns though; then I would like it much better
B005LAIHIQ|4.0|I attended a midnight premiere of this film and I absolutely love it! Though I'm not a diehard Burton fan, I greatly enjoy his work and though she is one of my favorite actresses, it's nice not to see Burton's off-screen partner (Helena Bonham Carter) as a leading lady in one of his films, for once.<br /><br />Eva Green is wonderful as Angelique Bouchard. Burton's \\"Angie\\" doesn't feign innocence as Lara Parker did the the '60s, but that WORKS for this eccentric director's adaptation. Johnny Depp is his usual charismatic, charming self and even Michelle Pfeiffer is surprisingly pleasing as Elizabeth Stoddard.<br /><br />Growing up, my mother loved Dark Shadows and relayed to me that she found it \\"pretty good.\\" Of course, she's not a wacko Dark Shadows fan who borders on \\"STAN\\" tendencies, unable to adapt to change or cope with implemented differences in the slightest. I've seen a number of episodes and it's no wonder it became a cult classic. If you loved the original and can adapt to change without being overly discriminatory, congratulations, this is a film for you! If not, I'd strongly advise you steer clear from the 2012 version--especially while it's in theaters! Please, don't risk huffing, puffing, and grunting as you'll in all likelihood ruin the experience for others.<br /><br />In praising this work, it's obviously not flawless. Chloe Grace Moretz is an utter bore (I'd literally be more inclined to watch grass grow) and it's a mystery why Tim Burton cast her. Bella Heathcote is, for lack of a better word, \\"interesting\\" as Victoria Winters. I sometimes felt as if her lines were spoken too monotonously. The penultimate scenes feel a bit rushed and I certainly did not appreciate the fate of Angelique (of course, knowing this is a Tim Burton film,  he may have us all fooled). And the final scene definitely implies an imminent sequel.<br /><br />In closing, Dark Shadows is a breath of a fresh air--a great film to see in a summer when other flicks appear to be lackluster at best, cliche or the last in their franchise. Tim Burton's latest is true to form (perceived as \\"over-the-top\\") surely has moments forcing viewers to narrow eyes in amazement, curiosity and bewilderment but for the most part, it's visually stunning with unbridled wit, dry (and blatant) humor and surprises that will keep you talking for days!
1576875776|4.0|Even given the astounding story of Vivian Maier, her brilliant work and the reasonable price of the book, sepia-toned prints would not be satisfactory at all.  But my book is from the third printing, and the prints are not sepia; blacks are fully black.  The most iconic image of all, and one of my all time favorites, is of a woman so very reminiscent of Marilyn Monroe, walking toward a 1956 Chevrolet. It is blurry due to hand-holding at a slow shutter speed, and perhaps out of focus, but those only add to the appeal.  The image in the book delivers the impact, if not the print quality, of the exhibition print I saw a year ago in Chicago. That said, it would be interesting to do a direct comparison by taking the book to another exhibition of Vivian Maier's prints.

1423101502|3.0|Percy Jackson is once again leading the demigods charge against Kronos, Lord of Time, and his army, to protect Mount Olympus.  With the prophecy laying heavy on his shoulders and facing the possibility of fighting members of Kronos' army that were once his friends, Percy goes to extreme lengths to win.  But will anything he does be enough?  Can you truly fight your fate?<br /><br />This book is different from the others in a good way.  A more balanced plot to story ratio instead of almost entirely plot (meaning the internal conflict to the external action was more even) providing a better reading experience.  This is not to say there was less action.  This book is jammed packed, but this time we see Percy really getting the fact  people are dying especially with the sacrifice of Charlie Beckendorf, and the \\"all-powerful\\" Olympian gods may not win.  The gods gather to fight a losing battle against Typhon and Percy's father, Poseidon, is under siege in the ocean.<br /><br />This book, as always, has a healthy dose of humor in even under the worst circumstances and the growth Percy exhibits as he nears his sixteenth birthday is good to see.  I finally saw the depth in Percy and a few of the other characters I have been looking for throughout the series.  Riordan makes good use of iconic places in New York and gives enough description for the reader to really picture what he is describing.  I have rarely read better fight scenes, with so many different elements and factions, anywhere else.  The ending is a satisfying wind up to the Percy Jackson series and a great set up for the next series in the demigod world, without leaving too big of a cliff hanger in this one.<br /><br />Riordan makes being a demigod seem fun; in fact the whole book is fun.  Sure you would have to deal with a nonhuman, absentee parent, and you could die, but I ask you, what's life without a little risk and battling a Minotaur?  I really enjoyed this book and look forward to reading more by Riordan.<br /><br />For the full review and others visit whymsylikesbooks dot blogspot dot com.<br /><br />For the full review and others visit whymsylikesbooks dot blogspot dot com

B004R2DS9C|4.0|This was a great addtion to the lego collection because the pieces don't get lost in the carpet.  They can play with the legos and then throw it into the box when they're done.  Not as many little pieces found laying around!

B000MRAAJM|5.0|No complaint at all from us. I bought these for my wife's birthday. Quick shipping, as expected. If anyone is debating between Blu-Ray and the DVD version, there's no question at all. Get the Blu-Rays. Additionally, there are a lot of other \\"nature\\" films for sale being packaged with Planet Earth. Unless you've seen the specific one you're looking to buy, don't bother. Most are significantly older and much poorer quality in comparison the Planet Earth.

Thank you to Amazon for providing the second season streamed instantly to my computer so we could get caught up. We have a little cord that connects to our tv and you have to have a HDMI output. We both like the historical relavance in the show and how contemporary it feels while set in the early 1900's. It has it all! 'Love the series and don't think we will be able to wait for season 3, January of 2013 . . . we may have to fly over to England and watch them filming!
B002Z7FWBI|5.0|DIRTY HARRY has stood the test of time and remains a classic film based on the mores of a modern society tempered with logical judgment of how to dispense justice to those unlawful individuals in that society. Clint Eastwood as Dirty Harry is the personification of that tool of logical judgment much to the disdain of his superiors and to the legal system he works within. DIRTY HARRY and SUDDEN IMPACT are the two films that bring the motivations and morality of this character under close scrutiny as he comes full circle with a rather dichotomous approach to his job over the span of time of these two films. When I first saw SUDDEN IMPACT I thought Clint Eastwood had somehow sold out on the underlying essence of the character he had been portraying. He took the realistic base from the first three DIRTY HARRY films (DIRTY HARRY, MAGNUM FORCE and THE ENFORCER) and replaced it with some type of pseudo surrealistic parody that seemed so repulsive it bordered on bad taste to say the very least. However, after repeated viewing it started to grow on me and I actually wanted to watch it over and over. I couldn't get enough of it. It certainly was not the same Dirty Harry but it had a very blunt approach for dealing with crime and criminals. In the first three films the bureaucrats constantly accused Harry of crossing the line yet the audience knew Harry was right and the bureaucrats were just a bunch of crybaby liberals (at least that's what the directors wanted us to think). In SUDDEN IMPACT Clint Eastwood is at the helm. Eastwood proposes a question to the audience: You like crazy? Do you want to see crazy? I'm going to give you crazy. Film making is a business and like a good businessman Eastwood gives his audience what they want. Yet Eastwood is no fool. Without artistic merit this film would have been a failure. Eastwood is playing the auteur filmmaker here and he is very successful at it. This film is way ahead of its time. The fabric of a sane society is being pulled apart. Family values, if you like, are out the window. Eastwood collects the most vile, repugnant and repulsive villains for this film that literally defines the meaning of trailer trash. The Mafia hoodlums at the beginning of the film look like... choirboys compared to the bunch of wacko amusement park crazies he ends up exterminating by the film's end. If Eastwood had not directed this film with his offbeat humor and unconventional style, if he had played it as a straight drama, the critics would have screamed murder. SUDDEN IMPACT is a good film. It's a stand-alone modern day apocalyptic tale delivered for your approval by Dirty Harry. Looking at MAGNUM FORCE there is an attempt to justify the true motivations of the character but that film is not successful thematically and is rather heavy handed. THE ENFORCER's straight forward approach is more satisfying. THE DEAD POOL is a rather lethargic almost sentimental look back at Harry and perhaps he has been assimilated by the very system he operated in. That system no longer resembles that which it was. Yet Harry has some of that starch still left in him. I can still remember Reni Santoni asking in the original DIRTY HARRY, \\"Why do they call you Dirty Harry?\\" Well, seems like ages ago, but we know the answer.art.

B005K0HDGE|4.0|****THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS****<br /><br />I enjoyed the first person narrative and I loved about the first half of the book (I especially loved revisiting Derry, twice).  Once Jake/George landed in Jodie, I began to wish only to get through to the ending. I started to rush through the Jodie story line.  His life in Jodie was repetitive (page after page after page) - how many school plays/skits and dances, and even \\"poundcake\\" do we need to go through, in full detail yet?  His relationship with Sadie was sweet, but I didn't realize I was purchasing a love story written by the Master of Horror.<br /><br />I wish that King would have spent less time on the mundane and more on what I thought was supposed to be the actual story line ... preventing JFK from being assassinated.  I enjoyed the parts where Jake / George was in Dallas / Fort Worth to spy on Oswald, but there needed to be more of it.  The date of 11/22 and it's happenings went way to fast and Sadie's death was predictable.  His return to current time was a stunner.  A little bit on the side of The Stand, but it was worth seeing how changing the past affected present day.  While Dunn was still alive, Jake / George didn't really save him, did he?<br /><br />The very ending was sweet ... one last dance with Sadie ... but, again, it reversed to a love story.<br /><br />The premise of the story is in itself amazing, but I think SK failed to fully play out what everyone thought the book was going to be about.  This 866 page door stopper could have easily been cut by about 400 pages.

0345803493|5.0|I loved this series. you have to read all to get the full effect.  In this book Mr.Grey starts to deal with his demons with Ana's help and love.  Even as controlling as Mr. Grey was, Ana chose her battles and stood up for what she needed, which was something Grey was not used too.<br />I thought the love they had for each other was touching and that love was what got them thru to better times.
0345803507|3.0|I really enjoyed the first 2 books but the third has all kinds of grammar errors, missing pages, and other typos in the iBook version.  I feel like I should get my money back because I was so frustrated reading this book.  I expect books that I buy to be flawless and not full of mistakes. The story line was fine when I was able to get through a chapter without all the errors. If you buy the 3rd book, DON'T buy it in the iBook version!!!!
0345803485|5.0|After hearing about this book, I decided I had to read it to see what all the talk was about.  I did not think it was \\"porn\\" I thought it portrayed a man into the kinkier side of sex.  You also have to read all three books to get the full story. I thought it was a beautiful love story.  This first book is probably the hardest to read because it's more about Mr. Grey's sexual behavior.  The second book is better and the third book is the best, but you really have to read all three to get the full effect.
0743297334|4.0|This book is a really good read.  It was the first Hemingway book all the way through and I loved it.  It's one of the few books that made me laugh out loud.  The story is good, the characters are great, and the writing is, well it's Hemingway, it's awesome.
0345803507|5.0|In this the third book, everything comes together for Ana and Christian.  They are still working thru their problems, but they do it with the love they have for each other.  I think they both grow up in this book and it has a beautiful ending.  I highly recommend this series, I have read them twice.

B006VA57CY|5.0|Im not sure why people critisize Downton Abbey season 2 for being different. A show needs to be different to keep the viewer interested- and Downton Abbey doesnt dissapoint at all. I feel some people may dislike that a lot of the glamour and backstabbing has been replaced by valor and the uggliness of World War 1. But this show really is following the times and seems most historically accurate. Many of the great themes still remain in the show despite the storyline changes. Maggie Smith's magical portrayal of Lady Grantham steals the show with her wicked one-liners. In fact, after a fight in the season finale she brings the house down with a simple question! I wont give more than that away but I applauded and laughed! O'Brien and Thomas are still coniving but O'Brien is actually funny in the 1st episode when she pranks the new maid. And ofcourse Downton Abbey continues to tantalize with the frustrating relationship of Mathew and Mary. All in All I have to say it was so worth the purchase-some of the best television Ive seen in a long time, I hope it sweeps the emmys again, it deserves it.

B005DC68NI|5.0|I just finished reading Let's Get Digital by David Gaughrain. If I had to summarize the book in one word, it would be \\"excellent\\"! The author made a very solid case for self-publishing while not trashing the traditional publishing route. He then shifted into what I consider the most thorough practical step-by-step guide to self-publishing that I have seen anywhere. The inclusion of personal stories of over 30 successful self-published writers was icing on the cake. I highly recommend this book and congratulate David Gaughrain on a well-written book that I'm sure will help many.

1843104954|5.0|Attwood's book is a thorough look at Asperger's.  His book cites sources that are both personal journeys and cliinical studies. Some chapters are obviously written for clinicians and can cause the average reader's eyes to gloss over. However, this book nails the idiosyncracies of an Asperger's child or adult.

1451673442|5.0|I'm on day 21 of the program and tonight when I got home I spontaneously cried from my heart in gratitude for all the wonderful people and things in my life. It was profound how I could appreciate dirt so much. :) Everything I looked at and thought of caused me to cry in such a deep feeling of gratitude.<br />Yesterday someone took my backpack and I had all my years lesson plans in it. All day I kept saying and feeling \\"thank you I have my backpack\\" and visualizing it in my hands. Today I went back to the place and someone had brought it back! The person had mistaken it for his own which looked very similar. (Oddly (I should have asked why) both his backpack and my backpack were there as the waitress showed me how similar they looked.)<br />It's worked for a date I was nervous about - I said and felt thank you in advance for a magical date and it was amazing! I have read law of attraction books and practiced steadily for the last 16 years and I honestly didn't think much of the Secret when I read it, but Rhonda Byrne has written one amazing leading edge book! Buy it and do all she says. I'm glad I did. :)

B002MQYOFW|5.0|Due to the movie, I had been hearing about the Hunger Games for some time.  Saw the movie and found it to be much more than what I was expecting.  Decided to read the book to get further detail and was glad that I did.  I found it to be a very enjoyable read.  It clarified many points that did not translate as well in the movie.  I don't expect my feeble review to persuade many to give the book a try.  However, if you are a fan of the movie and your trying to decide if it will be worth your time to read the book, definately read the book!  And by the way, great job Suzanne Collins!

0439023483|5.0|About the Book:<br />In a dystopian society, the Capital controls the districts around it by forcing strict rules upon them such as no hunting, no weapons, and restrictions on what sort of jobs they can have. However, the worst thing the districts are forced into is something called the Hunger Games. In these games, a boy and a girl from each district are chosen to participate and then thrown into an arena until only one is left alive. It is in these games that Katniss finds herself, and she is doing whatever it takes to survive.<br /><br />Review:<br />First off, I love the fact that Suzanne Collins does not shy away from heavy issues and violence even though this is a young adult series. I love the fact that she believes that even teenagers can handle such issues (at least in text). With that being said, time to turn my thoughts to other aspects of this book.<br /><br />I have to admit that this was a page turner, even though it was fairly obvious what was going to happen at the end of this book. The question was how. I thoroughly enjoyed getting to see how Katniss got out of each scenario. I have to say that some of my favourite scenes took place in the Capitol. Yes, the actual Hunger Games were quite entertaining with its weapons and survival, but the Capitol is just as harsh. Just in a different sense. In the Capitol, we get to see the tributes battle the press and learn how to be a good celebrity so that they can obtain sponsors, which can help them better survive in the arena.<br /><br />Besides the entertainment value, Collins does a fabulous job at poking fun at our current society (which I thought was a nice underlayer) such as all the fashion trends that can be so outrageous as to almost be grotesque. Then, of course, there are the Hunger Games that the Capitol people watch religiously like our own American Idol.<br /><br />Collins also manages to create fascinating characters. Honestly, I cannot think of a single character I dislike. I may dislike that character as a person or be aggravated by some of their traits though. For example, I could not see myself getting along with Katniss, but she made an excellent character. Then again, Katniss isn't supposed to be liked by everyone. Some love her and other times she simple rubs people the wrong way, and that is how I felt about her throughout.<br /><br />Not only does Collins create interesting characters but boy does she have a knack for getting images and emotions to stick in your head for days upon end. Don't worry. I don't plan on giving out spoilers, but I have to say one major part that is still with me is the climax of the actual Hunger Games with the mutts (genetically altered animals). There was definitely a creep factor when they came into play at the end.<br /><br />To be honest, the only things I really disliked  was the present tense writing and the love triangle. I'm guessing the former is more of a personal choice, but I am sure plenty can agree with me that the love triangle is getting old. However, it was definitely a subplot and not the main focus so I did not feel like I was drowning in the trope.<br /><br />So all together, I felt that this was an excellent read. It had an entertaining plot, well-rounded characters, and it did a fantastic job at integrating our current society in a heavy yet satirical way. Collins has a gift, and I would recommend this to many people. In fact, if you haven't read this, I suggest doing so (with the next two books on hand, because you will be wanting them).

0345803485|1.0|I have never written a book review, but I feel an obligation to young girls and abused women to comment.<br /><br />The book is about the relationship between Anastasia Steele, an innocent 21 year old virgin, and Christian Gray, a domineering, wealthy, handsome, complicated man.  Christian is possessive, abusive and domineering.  He wants to dominate Anastasia in every aspect of her life.  He needs to be completely in control over her, and she needs to do everything he wants, otherwise he will `punish' her...physically.<br /><br />She feels bad for him (he had a troubled childhood and was the victim of sexual abuse, when he was a teenager) so she lets him punish her by hitting her when she doesn't obey him.  In addition, he stalks her.  He always knows where she is and can appear at a moments notice.<br /><br />She is in love with him so allows him to hit her and punish her because she knows he needs to.<br /><br />The book depicts Anastasia as this young girl head over heels in love with a complicated, mysterious, sexy man.  The author tries to get the reader to feel like Christian is a victim, that we, like Anastasia should feel sorry for him, his troubled childhood.<br /><br />Anastasia tries to appease Christian, tries to justify why it's okay for him to hurt her and stalk her.  She loses her independence, her sense of self.<br /><br />Being a mother of a 21 year old college girl, this book was tremendously disturbing.  I felt that my daughter or her friends could read this book and think that the relationship Anastasia has with Christian is okay.  That it's okay to endure physical pain from a man if he has that need, that it's okay because she's helping him.  The author portrays the relationship as a love story.  It is not a love story, it is a story of abuse, and how one can easily get tangled up in an abusive relationship and lose sight of what a normal, healthy one is.<br /><br />I think this book encourages abused women to stay in a relationship where theycan get hurt....and sometimes die.<br /><br />Although the book ends with Anastasia leaving, it sounds like she regrets the decision and that she'll go back, just like many abused women.<br /><br />There are some books out there that have no impact on society and some that have positive impacts.  This book I feel will have a negative impact and victims of abuse and potential victims of abuse will get hurt by reading a romanticized version of abuse.
B002KSPKRS|1.0|THis headset broke after 2 weeks and only around 30 hours of gameplay. First the game sound wouldn't come out and then the chat sound died. I had to give it on star because amazon won't let  me give it zero stars.

0345531930|5.0|I enjoyed this almost as much as The Firm, which I think is Grisham's best. Rudy is such a nice guy and so naive at the book's beginning that you wonder how he's ever going to make it in the real world. Then his job falls through and he's stuck with old Miss Birdie and Dot and Donny Ray Black as clients. You wonder. Then he starts showing his street smarts and takes on the giant insurance company over Donny Ray's denial of medical benefits. It's a typical David vs Goliath story that has such charm and wit that you can't help but root for Rudy.<br /><br />Told in the first person through Rudy, this is a fun book that lets you enjoy yourself without worrying about how its going to turn out, because you know the bad guys are just too bad to win. Or are they?

B007PT3QOQ|3.0|At first this was a great game. But before long, a major flaw came out. Any time I had to restart my Kindle, the game's timing would get completely thrown off and take days to readjust. Developers please fix! Also, the occassional new business or building added would be welcome. It doesn't take long to get all of the ones already available. If it weren't for the glitches, this would be a five star game.

B007NZDES0|5.0|Took the wifey to see the Soldier of Love tour in Minneapolis last August and that was one of the best nights of our lives. We saw Lover's Live about 10 years back in Denver so we already had high expectations for this show and we were not let down. Can't wait to give this to my wife for an anniversary gift in June. Sade's live shows have such great audio visual effects and she is one of the best performers of our time. You cannot forget to give her band their props either. We actually a couple of the band members at an after function and they were super cool.
B003O86FMW|3.0|I felt this book was even more geared toward the  teen reader For the older  reader , a bit too predictable  Also the series subject was violent and I  don,t know if  teens  today need  more
0345803485|4.0|I bought this book for my mother for mother's day today, and I received in one day, no need to see that I was pleased by that. The only thing that I really didn't like was the fact that the book came with a bit of cover damage on the bottom end of it, I think probably from the way it was placed in the car. Otherwise it was clean and in good condition and she has started reading it with a smile so my guess is that she liked it after all.

B001KVZ6HK|5.0|I have not seen such a good plot, and wonderful ensemble of actors in a long time. Usually when a movie such as this comes out I find myself waiting for the DVD. This however was quite different. The roster of  actors, was enough to draw me in. The way the portrayed the characters from the Marvel comics was amazing. Every character was in my book as they should be. Though the plot was serious, I also found myself laughing throughout the film. I truly enjoyed it so much as to see it a second time. I advise anyone who liked the Hulk, Thor, Iron Man or Captain America movies to see this. The way that the movie is also filled with little hints regarding the other movies that bring us to this point or the \\"Pre-Avenger Movies\\" was a very nice touch as well. A good film, not much cussing as I would have figured for a PG-13. I can't wait to purchase this when it becomes available.

0385523912|5.0|Some reasons to read this book in 2012<br />1) You would think it is just a compellingly written document, but through the very personal (and different) situations of 6 defectors, as the book reaches the critical 'I have decided to defect climaxes', it becomes a \\"heart-tearing page-turner non-fiction novel\\". It is amazingly sad to read about each defectors\\" 'a-ha' moment (as they overcome brainwashing) to realise they must somehow try to get out of North Korea, each in their own time and own ways<br />2) By buying this book, then encouraging others to read it as well, global awareness about this quiet genocide will explode, despite the total lack of celebrities/people giving a damn (In stark contrast to Sudan, Bosnia, Africa, etc...it really is just as bad...and the book does not even delve that much into the horrific gulags that we know exist)<br />3) The book is a reminder of just what the best journalism writing used to be like before we all got 'dumbed down' by blogging/multi-media input/short sharp \\"tit bits\\" of journalism - the prose is that good to read<br />4) Some pretty amazing photos inside Chonjin North Korea - some pretty brave people took those photos and must have sneaked them out<br />5) With Kim-Jong Un having just replaced the previous scumbag, the people inside the country outside Pyongyang eating grass are nowhere near getting close to their 'East Berlin' moment<br />6) The book is actually inspiring - as you can see why - in their personalities, out of all North Koreans - these 6 made their way through to defect - the tenacity of the human spirit to seek better things and to be 'self-aware' that something needs to be done, shines through in the epilogue chapters of this book<br /><br />Will the North Korean people ever be free? And if they ever are, what to do with all the people brainwashed/numbed to human happiness, and the immense economic and societal pressure this will put on South Koreans if both halves try to integrate?<br />No easy answer...

B00136Q79I|4.0|Before I talk about this album, I must define what the Unholy Trinity of 1986 is to those who aren't in the know about this subject.  The Unholy Trinity of 1986 is a trio of thrash metal albums that came out in 1986 that have been highly revered for their sheer brutality and/or breakneck-fast riffs.  The trinity consists of Slayer's \\"Reign in Blood,\\" Kreator's \\"Pleasure to Kill,\\" and Dark Angel's \\"Darkness Descends.\\"  While \\"Reign in Blood\\" is the best-known of the three, I personally think it's the weakest of the bunch, though I still like it a lot.<br /><br />What can be said about Slayer's \\"Reign in Blood\\" that hasn't been said already?  It's a thrash metal album that's considered by many metalheads to be among the best and most intense ever made.  For a little while, I felt the same way, thought those sentiments would soon be dissolved once I sunk my teeth into the prime works of Kreator, Sodom, Morbid Saint, Dark Angel, and Pestilence (though they're known for being death metal, Pest' started off as a thrash metal band, and a superb one at that), just to name a few.<br /><br />MUSICIANSHIP<br /><br />I'll be honest here and say that while Slayer displays a good deal of confidence in their songwriting and mastery of instruments on this album, I felt the band saw better days in these areas when they recorded albums like \\"Hell Awaits,\\" \\"South of Heaven,\\" and \\"Seasons in the Abyss.\\"<br /><br />With the guitars, it's business as usual for Kerry King and Jeff Hanneman.  This album is loaded with tight, fast thrash riffs and \\"bunny in a blender\\" guitar solos.  While this works for the most part, in songs like \\"Piece by Piece,\\" it feels rather uninspired, especially since a lot of the songs are pretty short.  However, it works really well with some songs like \\"Necrophobic.\\"  \\"Angel of Death,\\" the most popular song on the album, displays probably the best dynamics in the guitar department, though some welcome time changes do occur in songs like \\"Postmortem\\" and \\"Raining Blood.\\"<br /><br />Dave Lombardo is widely-acclaimed for his drumming skills, and while I don't think he's one of the absolute best drummers in the heavy metal genre, his contributions on this album are really tight and fit the type of thrash on display here.  I think some of his best-sounding work in on the song \\"Reborn.\\"<br /><br />Tom Araya's vocals fit this album like a glove.  His vocals have a gruff feeling to them, adding a harsher edge to the music.  He also can dish out some blood-chilling screams like in the opening to \\"Angel of Death,\\" the near end of \\"Necrophobic,\\" and the middle of \\"Postmortem.\\"  I wish Araya's basslines were more audible in this album, since in previous Slayer recordings, they had more presence.<br /><br />SONGS<br /><br />Let's start off with the opening track, \\"Angel of Death.\\"  For those not in the know, this song is about one of the most evil men that ever lived, Joseph Mengele, a Nazi physician in Auschwitz infamous for his extremely twisted medical experiments on the camp's prisoners.  The lyrics about Mengele are a perfect fit for this twisted, iconic thrash song.  The highlights of \\"Angel of Death\\" are the really twisted dual guitar solos between King and Hanneman.  While \\"Reign in Blood\\" is well-known for being a fast and intense thrash album, it can utilize some good time changes to make the songs more interesting and even more intimidating than if it were just all fast.  As stated before, the last two songs, \\"Postmortem\\" and \\"Raining Blood\\" are a welcome change in the album and a great way to cap it off.  With \\"Raining Blood,\\" the slow, quiet introduction is a great way to start it off as it rather quickly turns into a chilling, intense thrash song.  The \\"fast\\" songs like \\"Necrophobic\\" can be really creepy and intense, and especially such track, as that one still still creeps me out for its brutal riffage, chilling guitar solo, and nefarious lyrics meticulously detailing torture and killing all in 1 minute and 40 seconds.The only \\"bad\\" song on here is \\"Piece by Piece, as it feels so flat and uninspired.  I'd say songs like \\"Altar of Sacrifice\\" and \\"Jesus Saves\\" are good, though not masterful.<br /><br />There's two bonus tracks, which is a re-recording of \\"Aggressive Perfector\\" and a remix of \\"Criminally Insane.\\"  While they're not bad, I prefer the original \\"Aggressive Perfector's\\" NWOBHM aesthetics that would have made it a perfect addition to Slayer's debut \\"Show No Mercy.\\"  The remix of \\"Criminally Insane\\" isn't bad, though I think the original feels much better.<br /><br />PRODUCTION<br /><br />The production on this album isn't bad, since the guitars, drums, and vocals come in really clear.  There's also a \\"harsh\\" aesthetic to the guitar sound, which is a good thing, especially for a thrash album.  I wish the bass had a stronger presence in the album, since I feel a well-mixed bass guitar can add some great power to the guitars and drums.<br /><br />FINAL WORD<br /><br />If you're fairly new to thrash metal and are curious about the more \\"intense\\" albums out there (especially with the Unholy Trinity of 1986), I suggest you start off with \\"Reign in Blood\\" first.  After you digest that album, then you're ready to tackle RIB's more intense counterparts, \\"Pleasure to Kill\\" and \\"Darkness Descends.\\"<br /><br />If you want Slayer's best work, check out \\"Hell Awaits,\\" \\"South of Heaven,\\" and \\"Seasons of the Abyss.\\"<br /><br />Personally, after getting into thrash albums like this, it made me rapidly lose any love I had for Metallica's \\"Master of Puppets.\\"The only \\"bad\\" song on here is \\"Piece by Piece, as it feels so flat and uninspired.

B007J4T2G8|5.0|The sexual and BDSM, etc. components of this series are far secondary to the richness of the characters and plot. James successfully developes a story of two young people rich with emotional, psychological, and explores for us with these characters the nuances of overcoming deep insecurities and doubt, learning and growing trust, and she does a magnificent job of illustrating through the series the power of innocence and raw honesty, a journey from darkness to light, the development of self esteem and trust... If the series was only about sex or a romance-novel type story, these books would have ended up among the many others that are limited to gratuitous sexual writings and/or Harlequin-like \\"Cinderella\\" stories. Sure, if a reader gets his/her kicks from the many steamy scenes, then that's his/her prerogative, but for goodness sake please recognize and respect that this series is a literary milestone with a story and characters that FAR transcend mere physical gratification. The sex is part of the story and journey, not the other way around. The proof is in their dramatic appeal and popularity. Dr. Oz dedicated an entire show to just book 1! Do you think a book solely abt \\"soft porn\\", BDSM, etc. would command such a following and attention? We know they wouldn't, because such writings limited to the aforesaid are available in ABUNDANCE. This series has been sensitively, brilliantly, and - yes - scintillatingly written by a master storyteller, and I am in awe of E.L. James' ability to create and give such a groundbreaking, rich, high quality, and unprecedented literary experience
B006OOHYIC|5.0|this version is addictive yet relaxing. you'll forget everything else except flawlessly finishing each stage. you wont regret getting this one.
B007IE4DSG|5.0|These days, the market seems awash with reissues containing demos and out-takes that were never intended (and barely fit) for public consumption.  Most of them are good for curiosity value, but don't reward repeated listening.  I'm pleased to say that this is not one of those collections.<br /><br />In the liner notes of the 30th Anniversary edition of [[ASIN:B00005214X All Things Must Pass]], George wrote that he thought the production was embarrassingly overblown and was very tempted to go back and remix it all but in the end, he decided to release it in the form that people were familiar with.  What we have on Early Takes is what we might have heard had George decided to strip back the arrangements.<br /><br />With the possible exception of My Sweet Lord, there is very little here that sounds unfinished.  Instead, it's more like what the songs would sound like had Unplugged been around in the early 70s.  I'd Have You Any Time is definitely superior to the album version and Woman Don't You Cry for Me (one of the few selections not taken from the All Things Must Pass era) is an excellent solo bluegrass piece - a more timeless arrangement than the funk version that was eventually released on [[ASIN:B00014TJ6G Thirty Three & 1/3]].<br /><br />Early Takes is a short album, only ten tracks and 30 minutes long, and priced accordingly.  Executive producer Olivia Harrison and Compilation producer Giles Martin have avoided the temptation to fill a disc with everything they can possibly find in the vault.  As such, it's a fitting, respectful and truly intimate glimpse at the early directions of some of George's songs.  Far from being a fans-only curio, it's an excellent album in its own right.

B007J4T2G8|5.0|I love that this book has made it ok for women to talk about sex. Men do it all the time but us women tend to be very reserved and private about it. My co-workers and I have talked about this series every day for week. It's so nice being able to hear what other women think and knowing that I'm not the only one who might like to explore with my boyfriends (or them with their husbands). And it seems to me that many people are misunderstanding Christian's character. Women are attracted to him because he's confident, kind, generous, passionate, attentive, etc. It's more about who he becomes because of his family and his love of Ana. Wonderful series!!! I will definitely be re-reading it.

B004EPYZP8|5.0|Michael Connelly is a great writer. All of his books are excellent and well written. They are filled with interesting plots, characters, and suspense that develop in an appealing and exciting manner. As with most books that are made into films, the films may be very good, as in this case, but the books are generally better because authors are able to tell us much more than the films have time to show and the books are usually filled with more interesting incidences that the films have insufficient time to portray. Yet, as stated, this is a very good film because the acting is consistently very good, and Matthew McConaughey gives an even better performance than he usually gives. The story is well told in the film, and we see how McConaughey discovers that a couple of his cases are not what he thinks they are and we find out that some lawyers and prosecutors are acting improperly.

I started reading this book about 9 o'clock in the morning and was finished by 7:30 the next!  A very fast read.<br /><br />I'm sure many other reviews describe the books plot line.  I will simply say that I think the book is popular because it appeals to multiple parts of a person.  There is the part of us that long for a hero(ine) (which Katniss is), the part that recognizes that this is a brutal world filled with evil, the part that desires for companionship/romance, the part that longs to see injustice rectified.  All of these things (and much more!) are found in this book.

0143119680|1.0|This review is for the audible version and I'm halfway through it. Where is this great and awesome book everyone else seems to have read, cause I want to read it. 'A Discovery of Witches' is not anywhere near awesome. It's ...<br /><br />Well, besides the tea, the amazingly old wine (really, I never read an fiction so obsessed with wine before), and yoga, you have an exercise in ... boring writing. Nothing happens. You get a decent first chapter and then ... nothing.<br /><br />Okay. Maybe that's not true. You get the perfect heroine. A true portrait of a Mary Sue. She's beautiful. She's the best at everything she does (excels at school (thanks, photographic memory), is awesome at drama, and somehow lands a tenure at that school.) Where witches have one, maybe TWO, powers, she has them all, save one or two. That's NOT an exaggeration. These awesome powers conveniently didn't really peak until now, thank god? I was a-gogg at her note taking in the library with her photographic memory, though.<br /><br />Her man is perfect. Perfectly handsome, rich, old, wise, and has a freakin' castle (probably two.)<br /><br />Since I bought the audio book, I find I must invent ways to make this book interesting. For the first ... 300 pages, there was no real conflict. The author just had people staring at her. Before Mr. Perfect whipped her away to the castle, do you know what \\"conflict\\" was involved? You see, everyone wants this book. They're content on just watching the heroine (as she exercises, does yoga, drinks tea, reads, etc -- she's FASCINATING.) After 300 pages, she decides to try to recall the book. It doesn't come up. So another witch sorta taunts her. He doesn't even swear at her and he's a good 10 feet away, but Mr. Perfect is there to react to nothing. Witch goes away. She goes to Librarian to ask about the book and they say the book is lost, has been for 150 years, and this ... this was the thing that got Mr. Perfect going. He literally goes to her and stands betweenher and the Librarian (very much like he expects the other man to take a swing at her) and says \\"this is TOO dangerous! I'm getting you out of here!\\" NOTHING! HAS! HAPPENED! (I mean, I know SOME Librarians are scary but come on!)<br /><br />So, back to ways to make the book interesting! I've decided it's like this vamp is reacting to invisible micro-waves or something! Ghosts, perhaps! My imagining is so much better then the book. Now, whenever this insane thing goes off because of lint, I feel the power to keep going -- if for no other reason than a good chuckle. He makes less sense then those crazy, homeless guys who rant about the end of the world. I mean, at least you sorta know what those guys are ranting about. This Mr. Perfect... there's nothing there. It's so weird.<br /><br />Still... I don't know how the rest of you managed to get to the ending... Strong, brave readers...
0385737955|5.0|Overall, a great read! It is however a bit slow to start at the beginning.  So if you can just get past the beginning it gets very interesting.

I have used this book (along with \\"Nghtwatch\\") to introduce many adult friends to Discworld and the marvelous experience of Pratchett's writings.  I have no reservations about the book except to echoe anyone who has said that-yes, it is for a slightly older audience than the previou Tiffany novels.  Buy it, read it, share it...everyone will be better off when you do...

B00757J98K|5.0|After releasing her eleventh studio album 'Hard Candy' in 2008, people noticed it wasn't something very innovative and sounded like many pop albums nowadays. The singles weren't commercial successes either, with '4 Minutes' being the best charting single in the United States and the rest of the singles being commercial failures. However, she delivered the high grossing critically acclaimed 'Sticky & Sweet Tour' that turned out to be so successful that more dates were added for 2009. After that, she released the greatest hits album 'Celebration' that received positive reviews with critics praising Madonna's extensive catalogue of music. During 2010 and 2011, Madonna went on a very long hiatus to focus on other ventures like directing the movie 'W.E' but she was constantly writing new songs and eventually announced she was longing to make new music and looking for the sickest producers to work with in late 2010. In July 2011, it was confirmed she started recording songs for a new album to be released in 2012. In November 2011, a demo of a new song called 'Give Me All Your Love' leaked on the Internet to a lot of controversy, with very diverse reviews with people loving and hating the songs and a man ending arrested for leaking the demo. After that, it was announced the song would be released as the lead single from Madonna's new album under the title 'Give Me All Your Luvin''. The album title was confirmed as 'MDNA' and the album was released in March 2012. Now I will review each song and give my final opinion:<br /><br />1. Girl Gone Wild - The album's first track and second single. It's not a bad song, but it was not an appropiate choice for a single since it sounds too much like most pop songs nowadays and Madonna has much better and more innovative songs on this album. I give it a 8/10<br /><br />2. Gang Bang - The album's second track. Now THIS is a killer song that takes it to another level and should have been a single (although it still can be since the era isjust starting). This song is fierce and the producer of course had to be the amazing William Orbit who produced Madonna's 'Ray Of Light' album back in 1998. This is the most innovative song on the album and my favorite as well. I give it a 10/10<br /><br />3. I'm Addicted - The album's third track. This song reminds me a lot of 'Confessions', specially the songs 'Future Lovers' and 'Jump' and I like it a lot, so I hope it's a single. I give it a 9.5/10<br /><br />4. Turn Up The Radio - The album's fourth track and possible third single. It's very catchy and has a summer vibe, so a June/July release would be very appropiate if it finally becomes the third single (which is most likely according to Madonna's manager). I give it a 9.5/10<br /><br />5. Give Me All Your Luvin' - The album's fifth track and first single. This song is good, but it's definitely not the best on the album and was a very weak choice for the first single considering the amount of amazing songs on the album, even 'Girl Gone Wild' is more appropiate as a first single. The main problem is that the production is very weak and it's not appealing at all, but the lyrics are good. I give it a 7/10<br /><br />6. Some Girls - The album's sixth track. Madonna's voice is very fixed on this song but that's precisely what I like about the song, she sounds funny on the song and William Orbit's production is also amazing. I give it a 9.5/10<br /><br />7. Superstar - The album's seventh track. This song is also a little weak for me and I expected more from it, I thought it was going to be something like 'Little Star' from 'Ray Of Light' but instead it's just Madonna saying 'ooh la la you're my superstar' in a very annoying and repeatitive way, not a very good song. I give it a 6.5/10<br /><br />8. I Don't Give A - The album's eighth track. My least favorite song on the album, it's too boring. I give it a 5.5/10<br /><br />9. I'm A Sinner - The album's ninth track. The fun comes back to the album with this song,it will remind you of the beginning of her song 'Ray Of Light' in some parts, but that's obviously because the producer is William Orbit. I give it a 9.5/10<br /><br />10. Love Spent - The album's tenth track. This song is so amazing, I love how it starts in an acoustic way and then reminds me a little of 'Die Another Day'. Not much to say, I think the music speaks for itself. My second favorite song on the album. I give it a 10/10<br /><br />11. Masterpiece - The album's eleventh track. First of all, this song is truly a masterpiece just like the title says. This is the song from the movie 'W.E' that Madonna directed and it's an emotional William Orbit produced ballad that you're sure to love. I give it a 10/10<br /><br />12. Falling Free - The album's twelfth and last track on the Standard edition. This is also an emotional ballad that you'll instantly fall in love with. It sometimes reminds me of 'Drowned World' from 'Ray Of Light' because it's also produced by William Orbit. Perfect ending to this amazing album. I give it a 10/10<br /><br />Overall, I think this album is just amazing. It proves that Madonna is the real queen of pop and that she can still make amazing albums after the 'Hard Candy' mess (that album wasn't bad, it just wasn't innovative). Too bad the album has so far been underrated by fans and critics, they say it's just a 'normal Madonna album', what are they thinking? It should be included in the list of Madonna's masterpieces with 'Like A Prayer', 'Ray Of Light' and 'Confessions On A Dance Floor' and I'm just shocked it isn't, probably they just listened to the 2 singles to judge the entire album. Listen to the FULL album! The singles were weak, but the other songs are amazing. I hope 'Turn Up The Radio' can prove critics and fans wrong, although it most likely won't and it also won't be a chart success. I guess we'll have to wait for the tour in order to fully restore Madonna's success.<br /><br />Final rating: 5/5

B007XKEY6Q|5.0|After i downloaded the app i thought i was gonna have some problems but.....IT WORKS!!!! I'm so happy now i can play it on my phone or my Kindle, how sweet is that. If your having problems with the game starting up make sure your still logged on to Facebook if that's the way you went, that was my mistake. You need to just close the app but don't sign out then the game should load. I hope this helps those having problems. I just love this drawing lol.
B007X038BI|4.0|This is a continuation of the story that started with the release of 'Give Me All Your Luvin''. Just 1 month after the release of the lead single from the 'MDNA' album, Madonna released the sophomore single 'Girl Gone Wild'. I don't know if it was because of the unexpected mixed to negative response to the previous single or just because Madonna wanted it that way, but she just released the second single out of nowhere with a previous announcement that didn't specify the song's release date. This song is much better than 'Give Me All Your Luvin'' since its production is much better and more appealing, but we have a new problem: it's not innovative and it sounds like most stuff out there nowadays. The production is still a problem here since its appeal sacrifices its creativity. 'Girl Gone Wild' has also nice lyrics like the previous single, but the lack of creativity also makes it a weak single. Now we have a bigger problem: the song has flopped. It debuted and peaked at #6 on the Bubbling Under chart, and that is a big disappointment. Interscope, so far you have handled Madonna's releases very badly and I truly hope you don't ruin it again for the upcoming single 'Turn Up The Radio'.

B004478AS4|5.0|I love that this book was on Kindle books and that the kindle app for itouch ipod was so easy to download, ready to go!! Very interesting story, as well.
0345803485|3.0|In the realm of romance novels, this is a winner.  The guy is gorgeous, rich, willing to compromise to meet the heroine's wants/needs, and the writing has multiple sex scenes.  If you're looking for a book just to provide fantasy material, spend your ten bucks and be happy.<br /><br />In the scope of BDSM fiction, and perhaps fiction in general, this is below average.  The writing itself is juvenile and it is clear that the writer needs to expand her repertoire of character actions (enough with the running fingers through hair and rolling eyes.)  There's zero mental stimulation to accompany the 'romance' herein, so seeking this as a lighter version of The Sleeping Beauty trilogy, for example, is sure to disappoint.<br /><br />Despite the above comments, I won't say this is a terrible book to avoid at all costs.  I've definitely suffered through worse writers and poorer editing jobs.  Keep your expectations on an even keel and you'll likely enjoy this.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|The book makes you wanting to carry on until the very end without getting bored or unfocused :) very interesting and highly recommended
B004Y1WCDE|2.0|performance on my kindle fire is so bad I'm petitioning for a refund. I feel justified in this having paid for the iphone version as well which performs flawlessly.<br /><br />issues: 90% of videos and music files simply wont play. those videos that will play are plagued by persistent stuttering. Again, same setup with iphone and all works well.<br /><br />the fire really upsets me sometimes - I want to believe Amazon. cant they fix all these little flaws that mar the fire? it could be great! its so close. its like they spent no time testing and ironing out wrinkles...

B005XN3150|4.0|So far I like this a lot.  Not just a new take on fairy tales, as we've seen dozens of times now, but a new story based on the spirit of what they offer.  \\"Believing even in the possibility of a happy ending is a very powerful thing.\\"<br /><br />And, oh my god, I love the fact that Doc is Snow White's OB-GYN.  LOL.

B007C3TVNA|3.0|Getting around to watching \\"We Need to Talk ABout Kevin\\" I didn't hear many people talking about this one.  To watch it finally it definetly will chill you to the bone and upset many viewers with how one child could cause so much havoc to his mother and manipulate his way around his behavior.  The character of Kevin is the classic socipath from the moment of birth.  He has his father wrapped around his finger and many of his tactics tends to go undisciplined by his father.  Kevin even goes as far to harm his own little sister at times.  The movie definetly isn't over-the-top with the violence in the sense of you won't see an epic blood bath like many thrillers/horrors films to give many viewers what they want.  I will also say if you are one for dialogue, WNTTAK is far and between, it's almost close to being a silent picture.  Overall I found the picture to be worth the watch, whether slow paced.  You will definetly feel pain for the mother you see her handle life past and present and towards the end you will also feel for Kevin(even though he does deserve every ounce his punishment).<br /><br />Rating - 3.5/5
B004UC4HCG|5.0|For those unaware of what \\"barebones\\" means, the only thing this system needs is a CPU and memory to get working.  A hard drive helps, but in theory you can run it off a flash disk.  This is a case, power supply and motherboard.  The only video connectors are DVI and HDMI, if your monitor isn't equipped for one of those you'll want a DVI to VGA adapter.<br /><br />For a compact system it's surprisingly feature rich with lots of internal SATA ports.  Layout is reasonable, a little cramped but it's a tiny computer.  The only minor negative is that the hard drive cage is not a tool-less removal (the case and fan are thumbscrews, the hard drive cage uses low-profile screws).  Certainly not annoying enough to ding a star since building the system is probably a once-and-done setup for me.<br /><br />I'm running the cheapest CPU I could find in it, upgrading from a laptop approaching a decade old it'll breeze through whatever I want to do with it.  After a minor SNAFU regarding the age of memory I scavenged from an old system, I've now got 8GB of RAM.  This is a HTPC with a wireless keyboard/trackpad and Mythbuntu Precise loaded up cleanly with no additional drivers needed.  The only thing that was broken was the audio out of the HDMI port, which is fixed easily with this command:<br /><br />echo \\" pcm.!default {<br />  type hw<br />  card 0<br />  device 3<br /> }\\" >> ~/.asoundr<br /><br />You may also need to enable it via alsa-mixer.<br /><br />The system is quiet and may even be running cooler than the ancient laptop it replaced.  Plus the native HDMI support mean I can actually watch stuff using my full screen at 1080p.

1455508977|5.0|What else needs to be said about the works of Nicholas Sparks? Once you've read one, you will find yourself with an uncontrollable desire to purchase all of his other novels.<br /><br />In The Lucky One, Logan Thiabolt treks half way across the country in search of a lucky charm, which happens to be in the form of a woman. During his first of three tours in Iraq, Logan finds a picture someone lost of a young woman. When the picture is not claimed, he vows to find the owner once his tour in the Marines is complete. With the picture in his pocket, he survives a firefight, and another and another. Lead to believe from a friend that the picture is good luck, he sets off from Colorado on foot to find his good luck charm.<br /><br />Their encounter sets in motion a wonderful love story, filled with humor, sadness, suspense and a bit of action. Another superb offering from a terrific writer, I look forward to more.

B00633W614|3.0|This book series is so disappointing.  Archer has sold out much like Patterson to make more money- 2 page chapters, large print, starting three quarters of the way down the page, etc.  This series should have been one book like his earlier epic novels which are immensely enjoyable and intriguing.  The story itself isn't bad, although the twists and turns are much more predictable in this series.

145210655X|5.0|Graphic novelist Jeffrey Brown is 37 years old, which is almost the cut-off for enjoying this irreverent (but tender) take on classic Star Wars to the fullest.  Darth Vader and son  was funnier and much more touching than I expected. I plan on buying several copies to give as gifts, especially for expectant fathers. It would also make a timely Father's Day present.<br /><br />Men in this age bracket who grew up in the Seventies and now have children of their own will appreciate the father-son dynamic here. Lord Vader's dark reputation is very much softened as he raises young Luke as a single parent, apparently, affixing band-aids and playing checkers (\\"You have learned much, young one.\\"). The positive vibe isn't an accident. Author-illustrator Brown admitted, \\"With my son being 4, I thought it would be really fun to do something along the lines of Luke being a 4-year-old and Darth Vader going through the same things I was going through as a parent.\\"<br /><br />That perspective results in some LOL moments, for example:<br /><br />**When I was your age, we didn't even have star destroyers.**<br /><br />**Luke, pick up your toys this instant. Luke, I am your father. Do you want a time-out?**<br /><br />**Luke complains, \\"I don't want a sister,\\" as Leia plays nearby (and puts Luke's action figures in dresses).**<br /><br />Quality construction on the hardcover itself. Chronicle continues to publish wonderfully offbeat titles. Not sure why Amazon currently shows availability as \\"Usually ships within 1 to 3 months.\\" FYI, it's available (albeit at full price) at Chronicle's own site.<br /><br />[The reviewer was provided with a complimentary copy of the book.]

B007M458CW|4.0|Locked Down is perhaps Mac's tastiest, best-ever collection of songs, due partly to the dual inspiration & creative prodding of Dan Auerbach. The only distraction for me is a slightly fuzzy, muddied recording soundstage. Despite the marquee value of Revolution, Big Shot & Getaway, the emotive power of My children, My Angels is a gem that extends this album's scope & artistic signature.

1416589473|4.0|\\"This is your chance, Dougal,\\" said Riona. \\"We go our separate ways. You go back to Divinity's Reach or Lion's Arch or wherever. You survived Ascalon City - twice. You have gems and gold to prove it. And while the Charr legions tear each other apart, you can just wait for the dust to settle and for the humans to come back. All you have to do is walk away.\\"<br /><br />  \\"I'm afraid I can't do that,\\" said Dougal. \\"You know that.\\"<br /><br />  Guild Wars: Ghosts of Ascalon, is a fairly short, high fantasy novel set in the fictitious game world of Tyria. It is a story about a human soldier turned thief named Dougal whose claim to fame, as the excerpt above states, is surviving Ascalon City. This is a dead city, haunted by the ghosts of the humans who at one time defended it from charr invaders and lost. Ghosts of Ascalon is a typical high fantasy story about a group of adventurers with a mission to do something impossible and of course only Dougal, the main character, can get it done.  Dougal is contacted by a group called the Vigil and they ask him to go back to Ascalon City to find a fabled weapon that if returned to their rightful owners may very well stop a costly war. The world has bigger problems with the recent rise of the ancient dragons and the five races of Tyria need to come together to face this new threat. Dougal is forced to face his past, find a way to get a group that couldn't be more different to work together and trust one another, and eventually the betrayal of an old friend.<br /><br />  While this is the back drop to the book, the main purpose of the book is to help bridge the gap between the online game Guild Wars 1 and 2. As there is a 250 year gap between both games the developer felt that there needed to be some explanation as to what happened between the first and the second game. As a fantasy novel the book is good, but I wouldn't say great or epic. As a book of lore for a video game the book is excellent. So those who will get the most out ofthis book will be those looking to understand more of the Guild Wars 2 lore before going to play the game.  Lore in a game is more important to some than others. For me lore is important because I like to create and play characters that really fit the world and could conceivably be found there. Knowing what has happened in the world and what is happening helps me to do this.<br /><br />  The writing and the pacing of the book are excellent. You get to know the main characters in a fairly quick manner, but you do feel like you know them at least a little. As this book's purpose is to focus on the lore of the game world each of the five races of Tyria, the sylvari, charr, humans, norn, and asura are represented in the party that goes to assist Dougal in his task. Each of the races has their particular mannerisms and outlooks on life. One thing that the book did was help to give an understanding of how each of the races are different and why perhaps they have a hard time coming together. There are wounds from the past, particularly between the charr and humans, who have been in a war that has been at a stalemate for over a decade and there are the typical issues that one finds when differing cultures come together. It goes into a bit of the world history which players of the first game will recognize and it also talks about the current state of the world and why the mission these adventurers are embarking on is important to the game world.<br /><br />  As mentioned above, the book is short and as far as fantasy goes there is nothing new here. Swords, sorcery, fantastical races, dragons, fighting, adventure. The story itself is also not particularly new for this genre, but the characters made it enjoyable and as I read it for the lore more than anything I found that I was not disappointed and I refer back to this often when discussing lore topics with other players.  It did help me to immerse into the world more deeply and I know I'll bring an even better character tolife in the game for having read it.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|If you like Harlequin romances than this trilogoy is for you.  Better writing, better character development, and more of a plot.  The love scences are not run of the mill but also not offensive.  I enjoyed the series and don't think the controversy is warrannted.  If you are a fan of Conemporary romance enjoy.

B0018QQQK8|5.0|Great great book. But absolutely nothing like the movie. Not even s little. In my oppinion you shouldnt read it if ur just gonna see the the movie anyway. The books way better than the movie.
0446547603|3.0|The first half of this book is pretty slow, I had to make myself keep reading.  It isn't really a new storyline either. The narrative goes back and forth between a few characters which makes it hard to connect to one persons emotions; and I found the majority of the plot line predictable.<br /><br />The overall story was nice though-- with nice characters. There is a slight twist, but nothing earth shattering that really makes the book stand out against others. I just couldn't really become attached to it because it's lacking depth in plot and in character. Again it was nice, but nothing special, and I could have easily put it down for something else.
B007549YM4|4.0|This movie has a love/hate relationship with reviewers it seems. I for one enjoyed it because I knew what to expect being that this is a movie about the apocalypse. The reviewers who gave this low scores state that it is a depressing movie without hope or redeeming value.  It is true the movie has little to no hope in it, and it is a descent of the rational into madness. What else would you expect when a group of people lock themselves in a building basement after nuclear bombs go off? You will enjoy this movie if you go into it expecting to be disgusted and wanting to see a raw, no holds barred portrayal of humanity at its worst. When all hope is lost, the animal in all of us is that much closer to revealing itself.
B007Q2N0HA|1.0|I was excited to read this book on vacation after reading through the positive reviews. Well, I couldn't even finish it I hated it so much. The characters were shallow, poorly developed and unbelievable. The writing was just bad. This just wasn't the book for me.

B0034G4P94|5.0|Hello out there.  Normally I don't write reviews for movies because I rather let the movie speak for itself.  However, Warrior is just too good of a movie not to say something.  I don't want to get into spoilers so I will keep it vague.  The cast of actors across the board was great, from sports announcers to the fighters.  I have to mention that Nick N., Tom H., and Joel E. delivered great performances as well as the supporting cast.  The plot is not something you find in movies which made predicting the movie impossible.  As a finishing touch, the music fit nicely in getting the viewer into the right mood for the scenes instead of detracting from it.  Overall, Warrior is a great movie.  If you're unsure, try renting it first because more than likely you will want to own it afterward or at the very least watch it again.  Thank you for your time and I hope you enjoy.
B0063IH60K|5.0|what can I say about solitaire that takes more then 3 or 4 words. Its great! The rest is just filler.

0345803485|4.0|I had never heard of this series until some coworkers brought it to my attention. I thought it sounded silly at first. So I was bored later and decided to check it out on my phone. On one app I got to read the first 10 chapters. I thought it was ok and a little unrealistic sexually (considering the average woman doesnt climax like that and so often) and she seemed kinda naive. It was his character that drew me in. Rich, sexy, knowledgable etc. Like so many women fantasize about naturally. Maybe the emotional part of this series is for a certain age group..One wants to connect with him. Hes the \\"bad boy\\" but not in the usual way. So after my free chapters were up I contemplated my next move. Buy or not to buy. I discussed with a friend and in the end I needed a new book to get into. Well needless I read all 3 in 4 days on my phone nonetheless. Yes it was interesting in \\"The red room of pain\\" for what little there was. Makes one curious but yet again it was the emotional connection between them. If observant enough you can tell thats not going to last and basically where the characters will end up but its the journey there. There are a lot of repeated looks, comments etc in the series. I have read people frustrated with how many times she says the same thing. Well let me ask this \\"is every one of your sexual escapades using different words?\\" Most likely not because in that moment whatever happens happens.<br />  Overall, many women out there want that connection with a partner. They want to feel that love and attention whether they are with someone or not. Its a fantasy but thats the fantasy people think about when they say they have or want \\"the one\\" this series just goes along with it. Ones heart just connects. I definitely have read worse thats for sure but I will eventually read this series again. It wont be for the sexual parts per se but it is a nice addition because one just likes the thought of being touched and by someone who wants and needs you so much. Is that part of it really wrong?<br />  Im glad I gave it a chance even though I didnt want to. Its the same with TV series/movies. They are boring at first but after a couple episodes it picks up. Its fiction people.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|Shakespeare first penned the concept of star-crossed lovers in Romeo and Juliet, and countless other stories have taken some version of that idea in order to keep the audience engaged with the drama that concept provides. Suzanne Collins amazingly does the same thing in the 21st century, penning a new concept that prevents an audience from putting down her book. There are certain books everyone should be familiar with at least if they do not read them: The Bible, Lord of the Rings, Romeo and Juliet, and the Hunger Games.

B004MC8CA2|5.0|So many versions and features all in one free app. And the layout is clean and simple. The only drawback is that because of licensing, you have to have data or internet access for many of the versions.
B0034G4P8A|4.0|Marvel certainly knows how to make entertaining, fun films. If you enjoyed \\"Iron Man\\" then chances are you will enjoy \\"Thor\\". Both movies have a similar comedic tone throughout so that they don't take themselves overly serious. You don't need to know much about Thor before seeing this movie - I didn't - since the first part explains what you need to know. This is a fun action-packed superhero movie with a decent plot and wonderful writing.<br /><br />The special effects, especially the realm of Asgard, are extremely well done. While about the first half of the movie takes place there, most of the rest takes place on Earth, so it doesn't feel too alien or foreign. When Thor has his hammer he is virtually all-powerful and seems to derive joy from conflict. What makes his character so likable though is that he is fallible and despite some ego, he is humbled and learns from his mistakes. Of course, it doesn't hurt that he is also very handsome and chivalrous. Besides Thor and his brother Loki, the major characters include a couple human scientists, portrayed by Natalie Portman and Stellan Skarsgård. Portman's character falls in love with Thor, while Skarsgård's character is the overly protective father figure.<br /><br />While the effects are very good and the acting is great, what seemed to make the movie so enjoyable was the writing. The dialog was very witty at times without being ridiculous. Although the story was a bit predictable, the interesting characters kept it from being boring. The ending makes it clear a sequel is being planned and I'll be glad to see it.
B005LAIHIQ|2.0|I saw this the Friday before Mother's Day.  Judging from the reactions of the moms I saw with their kids as they were coming out of the theater, few were wowed by this movie. Nor was I.  My fellow audience members, so jovial as they filed in, took seats and watched the previews, were dead silent throughout the whole of \\"Dark Shadows.\\"  There were a few wan chuckles here and there, but that was it.  Maybe you have to be a fan of the original series which predates me.<br /><br />Johnny Depp plays Barnabas Collins, a non-sparkly vampire who's been placed under a curse and trapped in a coffin for almost 200 years. Accidentally released, he returns to the coastal town of Collinwood, founded by his forebears, to help his family \\"restore the business to its former glory.\\"  Michelle Pfeffer plays the matriarch, and her facial expression does not change one iota during the course of the film, though she, like the rest of the cast, does her best with the cringe-worthy dialogue and minimal character development.  Depp, who only subsists on other people's blood because he has no choice, must deal with the witch who placed him under the curse, who he finds strangely attractive. Competition for her comes in the form of the new family governess (Bella Heathcote) and child psychiatrist (Helena Bonham Carter) who both develop feelings for Barnabas.<br /><br />Subtlety is not the film's strong point.  Example: Depp returns from the dead, and we get to see a cinema ad for the movie \\"Superfly,\\" while lyrics with that word prominently featured also play. When he devours someone, it's mostly not shown, but then we get him in the following scene looking like a ketchup packet has just exploded over his face.  Storylines are dropped abruptly, many characters are under-used, and it ends with a rather cheesy battle between good and evil. Fans of Tim Burton and Johnny Depp may enjoy it, but I'd need to be hypnotized, much like Carter does Depp, before seeing it a second time.

B005HSL626|3.0|While I enjoy the game, I don't appreciate the video ads that randomly pop up, especially when my kids are playing. It either makes them think they pushed something wrong or they do click and it takes them to a website.<br /><br />MAY buy the game later so we can play without the ads. But it ducks knowing the ads were made that annoying so that people will pay for it instead.

0375704027|5.0|This book deals with so many important themes of life. The transcendence of the spirit and the rebuilding of our own selves are such poignant and present themes. Death is strongly covered, beginning with the very first few pages of the book. Suicide, to be more specific, is what is first encountered as you enter Murakami's world of pain and sorrow, but also patience, love, and hope. The book tries to highlight the ability to reminisce over the good in, possibly, some of our most difficult moments in life. Sometimes through humor, sometimes through sexual encounters, and sometimes by escaping with a ludicrous friend who just wants to get ahead in life because he gets a thrill through the 'game.' I should emphasize, there is a ubiquitous nature of sexuality that seems to suggest is at the 'crux of all human engagement in life.<br /><br />When I first began reading this novel, I was blown away. I have not yet experienced Murakami's world of writing until now. He is absolute genius. He stands in a category all of his own. His writing is simple, yet so heart-felt, so honest, so true. It cuts through you right to the heart, right to your spirit, right to your soul. I felt sad. I felt happy. I laughed. I went through all kinds of colorful emotions while reading this novel. I felt the defeat, and I also felt the hope, and even the fight that we all go through to better our individual selves. I experienced everything in the book as though I was reliving some of my own struggles and challenges through those exact emotions that Naoko, Watanabe, and Midori feel through their lives. This is a story about such a far away place, and yet you'll feel so close to this book.<br /><br />The book begins with all the things he (Watanabe) has lost in the course of his life. \\"Times gone forever, friends who have died or disappeared, feelings I would never know again,\\" he says. The book concludes with possible opportunity, a new beginning, or an especially long over-due addition to his life. Quite the rollercoaster, all the while enjoying the little things that keeps us grounded, smiling and laughing, and looking forward to the tomorrow.<br /><br />Murakami has the ability to totally capture his characters. The whole time I read about the characters, one by one, I felt as though Murakami had learned about them thoroughly, knowing all their intricacies and subtleties, then placed himself in their shoes, and from that perspective told their stories as they would themselves. They are so well captured and developed. They are real people with real stories with real human spirits. The characters are diverse, unique, and genuine. They also carry a level of universalism that I have not yet read in characters up to now. To think that this all takes place in Japan boggles my mind. It felt I was reading about people I have knew or know. Naoko, Toru, Midori, and Reiko truly moved me, all in their special and unique mannerism.<br /><br />There is so much to write about this book. It's ultimately one of my most prized books, now. It's just one of those novels that I will come back to frequently. It leaves a mark on you. It is definitely bittersweet that I have finished this novel. I believe I never really wanted it to end. I wish I could know how the story continues.<br /><br />There are a lot of references to really great books in this novel. Something to keep in mind while reading this book. It will make you crave to read amazing books. Too many to sift through and list them. I do remember, however, Fitzgerald, Dostoyevsky, and Einstein being mentioned. But there are several more others.<br /><br />Murakami really gives us a perspective on the balance of life and death. The universe likes to balance things out. We all pay our dues. All these themes are part of a larger context in this book. Perhaps, this is one of the most mysterious elements to the book, never knowing how life and death are really linked to our purpose on earth. We speculate. We have theories. Some of us even have our convictions. But what is it that drives young individuals to their own demise, to suicide? Why? This book may help you see some of the details that transpire in the lives of the four people who decide to end their own lives, but it's still a mystery what really leads them there, exactly. We can speculate, and entertain several ideas, but it leaves a lot for questioning. I absolutely admire Murakami for tackling such concept with such interwoven details, and succeeding so effortlessly.<br /><br />There are just so many things to talk about with this book.... I could go on forever. I know I will be coming back to this book, sooner than I think. It's one of those books that you will crave. I have an intuition about things, much like Midori does in the book.
0739375970|1.0|This review addresses only the quality of the audiobook, not the book itself.<br /><br />Many audiobook fans vehemently hate the audiobook of \\"A Feast for Crows,\\" the first in the series not read by Roy Dotrice.  I thought it was fine, personally.  With the release of \\"A Dance with Dragons\\" on audiobook, Dotrice re-recorded \\"A Feast for Crows.\\"  Don't bother with either.  Dotrice didn't listen to his recordings of the first three books, and his accent shifts noticeably in this CD set for Daenerys and Tyrion.  Daenerys now sounds like a Welsh washerwoman.  It's terrible.  I couldn't get through a full listen because I was so irritated by her new voice.  I'd recommend not bothering to purchase this set, particularly given how expensive it is.  Random House needs to re-record the Daenerys sections, at a minimum.  A better option would be a recording that featured women reading the female viewpoints.  But Dotrice's lack of professionalism in maintaining consistency between books is appalling, and completely ruins this audiobook.

B004J2TPSI|1.0|It's absolutely ridiculous that KOKKIA charges $50.00 for this Bluetooth transmitter.  Even if it actually worked it would be an exorbitant amount to pay for this device, but unfortunately it performs very very poorly.  I paired it with my Bluetooth headphones so I could get rid of my earbuds and I connected the KOKKIA Bluetooth receiver to my MP3 player (Sansa Clip+).  The sound constantly drops out - it doesn't matter how close you are.  The first thing I did when I took it out of the package was fully charge the Bluetooth receiver and my Bluetooth headphones had just been charged that morning and hadn't been used so they were also at a full charge so I know it's not a matter of either of the batteries being weak.  Just for the heck of it I also connected it to my Cowon iAudio 7 MP3 player and, as expected, got the same results.  I know it's not my [[ASIN:B0040Z1EHY ARCTIC Sound ORACO-ERM28-GBA01 Headphones P311 (Black and Gray)]] because I've been using them with my Motorola Triumph (Android) cell phone with absolutely no issues and the range is great.  I've tested the transmitter with my Sansa Clip+ in my shirt pocket (less than one foot from the headphones), jacket pocket (less than two feet from the headphones) and my back pants pocket.  No matter where the transmitter was it would constantly drop audio.  I found that the only way audio will not drop is if the transmitter (w/MP3 player) are sitting stationary (on a table / car seat / etc) and you are not moving AT ALL.  As soon as you move your head or the mp3 player a little bit the sound will drop.  Generally I clip my MP3 player to my pants pocket or keep it in my shirt pocket but with this transmitter that was a no-go so I had to return it.  I'll just go back to using my phone with my Bluetooth headphones for now, which is a shame because I like the portability of the Sansa Clip+.
B003YFIUW8|5.0|I was hooked from the start.  This book was one of the best that I have come across in a while.  The part I enjoyed the most was that this book didn't end when Ma and Jack leave Room, it details the challenges they faced afterwards.  I have read many books similar, but they all end when the person or persons are rescued.<br /><br />Excellent read from the endearing view point of five year old Jack.

B007SGM084|2.0|A woman at work grabbed my arm and said, \\"You MUST read this series, promise me you will.\\"<br /><br />And I have a Kindle.<br /><br />Plus the irritating issue of having mini-psychic breaks that appear after intense personal illness or fear from something like a non-functiong leg, that mutates in the form of reading romances. Things aren't going well. I ordered them. I have read them.<br /><br /> I personally prefer Victorian ones by Eloisa James, but that said, my take on this story is this. Let's call this a strange Cinderella.  Why is it that the male lead has to be rich beyond all belief? Why is THAT such a motif in the female romance genre writing. Why is a woman always not rich beyond all belief?  Here she is- bound to this provider. How far have we come to see that fundamental here. An inch?<br /><br />Immediately this story becomes a part of the archetypes of our \\"times.\\" Which just allow for a lot of pain for the female who in this story seems to have a predilection for debasement. She says no with a yes so much it's tiresome.  And the sadistic elements-way to go-no one will leave this book EVER wanting for reading another description of this couple in the bedroom, or on every surface, with a spreader bar or cuff or firmly doing whatever. If that's your thing-you are set.<br />The plot is more than spelled out on this site-no need to go through it- and SNL has thoroughly parodied it as the Mother's Day gift of this year.Go see that on-line.  But....notions like a good woman can \\"cure\\" any man of any deep seated problem, that orgasms are this easy, that appetites and lives revolve around immense amounts of daily sex-these distortions really seem rather like snake oil.<br />I find this disturbing mainly for what it says about us all. Lots of money, loads of sex, incredible amounts of aggression, intimidation- here called control- and two people that have nothing better EVER to do- except to daily many times debate if they can allow the other out of their sight or ever be alone...proclaiming love love love love love ad infinitum, that fear they have of being meaningful, to this degree, incapable of nothing other than total stimulation, relating, this degree of hypervigilence, of panic just gets really old to read. I felt like....here they go again.<br /> I kept wondering if a dose of Xanax might be worth a shot. Or some  meditation. There are some majorly messed up things in play in these stories. Modern Cinderella here meets the prince and has to operate in a field that ultimately is going to take all those values they kinda hint she has that attracts folks, innocence-hard-working, honest, coping with less, and turn her into a being that's desperate, needy, insecure, and lots more which seems to move her pretty far from fairytale endings.<br />But I suppose the important thing is can they do it in the restroom? Or in the plane lavatory, or enough to solve every problem they ever encounter. Love conquers all? Or was that mutated- in this century- to \\"the act\\" is this all there is?<br /><br />I'm troubled by the book in the way I am troubled by those I care deeply about struggling with reality. There is a whole lot to analyze about what this book says about us. I wouldn't mind a course that took this book on -really not as a fan club-along with one like it written by a man.  I believe finding Erica Jong in my dad's sock drawer when I was ten would be about the same kind of realization i might be treated to then.

B000AJIF4E|5.0|I loved SONY from the beginning. But when my SONY headphones wore out through years of use, I wanted me a new pair. Regardless of media--iPod or just plain listening to your fave video on YouTube--you will be able to hear sounds you have never thought were there before. Try listening to Chicane's Daylight video using a headphone or MDR 7506. You will hear the difference. I was just blown away like I-got-goosebumps-all-over-my-body blown away. The level of sound detail is just amazing. Plus, when you listen, these headphones cancel out noise well such that other people will have to physically let you know they are saying something to you.<br /><br />One of my wisest purchases this year. I'll challenge myself to keep these for the next 35 years because I hear they are that durable.

B00005MKA1|4.0|Bob Marley & The Wailers - Kaya (1978)<br /><br />The songs that appear on KAYA were recorded at the same time as the tracks that comprise the legendary EXODUS album, but you wouldn't necessarily know this was a collection of leftovers just from listening to it. It's a very good album. Some people claim that the rootsier early Bob Marley is the best but I actually prefer the expertly produced pop sheen of later albums like this one and especially UPRISING (my favorite Bob Marley album). Some of these songs have been recorded previously but I think the versions on KAYA are great improvements both in presentation and production. Overall the album is laid back and groovy yet there's a fair amount of diversity too. As for the sound of this latest remaster, to my ears it's excellent. I can pick out all kinds of details - it sounds crisp. Marley is without a doubt the ultimate reggae musician and one of the greatest musicians ever, period.<br /><br />Breakdown!<br /><br />\\"Easy Skanking\\" - is an enjoyable, easy going groove. I wouldn't call it \\"lazy\\" though as it's so skillfully played with a rather tricky, unconventional reggae rhythm. \\"Excuse me while I light my spliff/ Oh God I've got to take a lift/ From reality I just can't drift/ That's why I'm staying with this riff...\\" :) ****<br /><br />\\"Kaya\\" -  mellow yet upbeat,  this is a wonderful tribute to pot, a top-notch \\"feel good\\" Bob Marley tune. *****<br /><br />\\"Is This Love\\" - supremely melodic, laid-back tune that rightly earned a place on the legendary LEGEND compilation. Like many of these songs, it's actually quite sophisticated, yet Marley and band make it sound so simple and easy. *****+<br /><br />\\"Sun Is Shining\\" - this song had been around for quite a while before Bob and co. recorded the definitive version that appears here. It's incredibly hypnotic and atmospheric. Junior Marvin contributes some fantastic guitar noodling over the proceedings and the airy background vocals of the I-Threes (Rita Marley, Judy Mowatt and Marcia Griffiths) are gorgeous. *****+<br /><br />\\"Satisfy My Soul\\" - has some nice horns and an agreeable groove, nice and easy. ***3/4<br /><br />\\"She's Gone\\" - It's not one of the strongest tracks here but it's still very good. It's got a sweet reggae groove driven by guitar and Bob's melodic vocal is wonderful. ****<br /><br />\\"Misty Morning\\" - is incredible, possibly the best track on the album. It's got some great riffs played on brass instruments, a staggered, very authoritative groove. Marley really pours his guts out on this one. Definitive reggae, yet something unique. *****+<br /><br />\\"Crisis\\" - another lesser track but worthy nonetheless - there are no weak tracks on KAYA! The music is less driven yet Marley delivers a heart-felt, creative vocal. ***1/2<br /><br />\\"Running Away\\" - is probably my least favorite track but it's quality and it's in fact a highlight according to other music reviewers. A bit meandering but expertly constructed with some nice horn and keyboard accents. \\"You can't run away from yourself...\\" ***1/2<br /><br />\\"Time Will Tell\\" - is a classic, a unique song with sweet keyboard and acoustic guitar licks, a knowing respite against oppressors. *****+<br /><br />\\"Smile Jamaica\\" - The non-album bonus cut is inessential, far from Marley's best music. I sympathize with those who would prefer that it wasn't included; it's nice to be able to just throw an album on and hear how it was originally meant to sound without having to program an edit. This track has a standard reggae sound and some dubby effects...it's well-played and there's certainly nothing wrong with it, it just doesn't have a catchy melody and it's ultimately not worth listening to more than a few times. It definitely detracts from the album. **1/2dy Mowatt and Marcia Griffiths) are gorgeous. *****+<br /><br />\\"Satisfy My Soul\\" - has some nice horns and an agreeable groove, nice and easy. ***3/4<br /><br />\\"She's Gone\\" - It's not one of the strongest tracks here but it's still very good.

0812452240|2.0|thought i was buying a hard cover full size edition of this book, from like a book club type of publishing house. I have purchased a similar hard cover version of \\"the Stand\\" where it was normal hardcover size but would never be worth anything more than what i paid for it, which is fine i enjoy reading hardcover. What i got was a paperback sized book with a hard cover, so the type face is real small and if you have ever read this book you know it over 1000 pages and in this format it is actually harder to read than a regular paperback version. The product did display the dimensions on the page but who really looks at that when buying anything other than furniture or appliances? guess i will next time.<br /><br />Story is incredible and any fan of King will put this one at or near the top of their favorites.

B0067AC5KA|5.0|If you find the books - or, the first book, at least - to be a little slow, or too full of the lineage of the \\"V\\" family (over and over and over), keep reading and you will be highly rewarded with a very interesting and fullfilling story as it all builds to its (first) ending.  I am only part way through the second book: \\"The Girl Who Played With Fire\\", so I cannot review anything more than the 'Tattoo' and the beginning of 'Fire' but the second novel has a lot more happening in the beginning than did 'Tattoo'.  Good writing.  Apparently a very good translation, although I would know nothing about that.  It just seems that the English builds and flows naturally. The physical location of most of the story does not really play a huge role in laying out the scenery to me, since I have never been to Sweden. It seems it could pretty easily be any metropolitan area and seaside town or village (because these I have seen).  Still, the Swedish names and locations, the monetary units, the way apartments are rented and sized and the legal system and politics do all bring a sense of \\"Sweden\\" to the story, and I like that. An interesting blend of the running of a financial magazine, investigations, computer hacking, looking into the cracks of society, sex, horrific crime, old mysteries, old men and their mysteries, big business and big money and getting what you deserve, I guess.

Take my advice: Just stick with the Walt Disney's version.

B007XKEY6Q|5.0|I love this game! I cant believe that they made this for kindle fire!!! I love the fact that I can play this on the go!
B005GFPZYK|1.0|It seems that every paragraph has something like this: \\"this is not about me\\", but it certainly is about the author and his manliness.  I totally respect the author's service in the military (I am a veteran also), but the book is poorly written and the main topic of the book is the author's abundant supply of testosterone.  This was a waste of money.
0345529057|5.0|This is my first time reading books from a fantasy series. I watched the show on HBO and was HOOKED. I just had to read the books, and they are awesome! Well written and very detailed.<br /><br />THE PROS:<br /><br />1- Beautifully written with great attention to detail. Each book is told from many different characters' points of view, which is a different writing style than I'm used to, but great nonetheless.<br /><br />2- Never boring (so far). Always something going on all over the Seven Kingdoms.<br /><br />3- The quest for the throne continues and keeps you guessing after each chapter.<br /><br />4- The paperback versions have a sample chapter from the next book, which leaves me with something to look forward to.<br /><br />5- The anticipation of the next event keeps you going and keeps the books interesting; doesn't lose its momentum.<br /><br />THE CONS:<br /><br />1- The way GRRM describes women. The rape scenes are brutal, the sexual violence is out of this world. You have to have a thick stomach to read this series! I'm not used to reading books with such sexual violence, so this was new for me.<br /><br />2- Each book gets longer and longer. Game of Thrones is 800 pages, A Clash of Kings is 967, and A Storm of Swords is 1126 pages. I haven't read A Feast for Crows yet, but I'm sure it's longer than A Storm of Swords. I heard A Dance with Dragons will be over 1200 pages when it comes out in paperback in August 2012.<br /><br />3- GRRM has big gaps in between books. I wonder when The Winds of Winter will be published. According to GRRM, not any time soon. He is taking his time developing the characters and storyline, which is good and bad all the same. The fans are waiting with great anticipation!! I just hope he doesn't wait too long, like Stieg Larsson did with the Millennium series (he died before he finished the 4th book- he was halfway done).<br /><br />**Overall, I've read the first two books and am working my way through A Storm of Swords. It's greatso far and I can't put it down!
B0079R8KXG|5.0|This is a great case. The Kindle Fire pops right in \\"click!\\" and you are off and running.  It is lightweight, has awesome internal material that holds the fire at the exact angle you place it.. no slipping. I also like the strap.  I use it to hold the cover closed and my stylus in place when not in use.  Highly recommended.  I wish it came in more colors.  I got the red and like it.  I am sure the black is great too.  And, to top it off, I love their packaging philosophy.  Just a recycleable paper envelope that protects, but doesn't create tons trash for landfills.
B001LM1456|5.0|Excellent movie at a great price!  It was instantly available with high-quality streaming.  Very entertaining and excellent, special effects with a cameo appearance by Lou Ferrigno (the original Hulk from the TV Series).<br /><br />It set the platform for Marvel's Avengers movie.
B006AZZPCM|5.0|Excellent. Works fine on my Evo 3D. I wish Google stops banning this app in its appstore, but that's why we need Amazon appstore.<br /><br />Why does YouTube not permit download of its videos? Makes no sense.<br /><br />The only thing more for this app is bigger font size in its browser with pinch-to-zoom and text wrapping capabilities.
B004T0E2S8|4.0|this app started out amazingly!! I love it as I am very new to guitar. one of the things I loved was the tab packs section, however recently every time I've tried to use this it makes me force close! Developers: Please fix this!! I love your app except for this little bug. Otherwise it would get five stars most definitely. Thank you!!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love this app, its really entertaining. I never get bored as long as I have this app because it has so many fun games
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Highly recommend this book to even the earliest of readers! Packed with adventure, love, trust, & honesty! Read this before you see the movie!
B004WOJ6XC|3.0|This is the first Rhapsody of Fire album I have purchased. I find several of the songs on this album pretty decent and each song sounds lightly different, either with a difference form of music or a different type of vocals (Or changing from English to Italian [Here I am just guessing, I am not a Polyglot by any means] and back to English in a few songs). I have heard other songs by them on other albums that are better than what is on here, however.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|it never does  get old! i love it. there is always something new to enjoy. it is deffenitly worh getting.
0545265355|5.0|I had never heard of The Hunger Games until the movie came out. I really enjoy post-apocalypse stories, and this one delivers!
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|This game is super fun for people of all ages! It blew me away how fun and exciting this game was!
0393327655|2.0|Secularism is the modern day religion.<br />The concern I have with this perspective is, when will secularism be a governmental movement to force the citizenry into conformity?<br />Secularism is as arrogant and intolerant as any religious faith the author condemns.<br />It is sad that the author isn't able to see secularism's logical progression into the very hate filled world he wishes to 'eliminate'.
B004E2XAFW|5.0|This is simply an awesome disc.  All songs are melodic...some darker than others....very, VERY good.  Sharon den Adel's vocals cut through the music like a smooth, beautiful knife.  Production is top-notch!  Wish they would tour the US....I'd go see them for sure!
B007M458CW|4.0|FUll disclosure - I have been a lifelong fan of the good Dr and I must admit - I saw him perform live a few years back and was a little - disappointed. He seemed to be on cruise control and completely ignorant of his audience and their (our) needs and wants. I also think that until his last two albums - his work had become deriviative and too oddly influenced by the music of \\"the day\\". Locked Down returns Dr John to what he does and does well - channeling the New Orleans classic sounds through a magical musician that transcends time and makes the sounds his own. STRONG ALBUM for hardcore fans and even a newbies who could learn a thing or two from the good physican himself. One of my top picks already for 2012.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|this game is so fun, I recommend It to all my friends sup sup sup sip sup sup sip sip sip sip
B003O86FMW|5.0|Just like the Hunger Games, part 1, I could not put this book down. I have now read all three and I was sorry that there wasn't a fourth.
B0034G4P94|5.0|A real movie, the Rocky of our day.  Everybody played great in their parts. I was totally satisfied with the movie.  I only wish they would have shown more from Nolte's past drunken life. He makes you almost cry throughout the story from the pain of sorrow from his mistakes.
B00009XITP|5.0|It's a very nice little story about a father and his daughter. I really liked the part where the daughter finally gets her father-daughter dance.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|good stuff. not bad. worth it. enjoy. how many games can you play? play them all. need this. want it.
B006PHD0RW|4.0|How cute is this game. My five year old granddaughter and I play this all the time. Might I just add I really don't think either one of us are going to be employed by your nearest grocery store anytime soon. You can relax---your groceries are safe for now
B006PHD0RW|5.0|Love this game, all levels are great fun! Great way to spend your free time. The puzzle mode is my favorite but I love to crush also!
B004UNX1LS|3.0|First of all don't get me wrong. I absolutely adore vevo. the entire thing is great. yet I just got an update literally two minutes ago and now, for whatever reason, I cant watch videos. It'll get to the whole fun fact and loading thing, but now it will just stay on that and the song will play but not the video. While the layout is definately better, the fact that the whole purpose is now rendered redundant is definately a turnoff for me.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Love the readings, I love the ability to listen the the bible and read along. A must for everyone.<br /><br />I am able to use the versions of the bible to study.

0062060562|4.0|If you have been looking for a suspenseful thriller with a new twist - then this book is for you.<br />Christine wakes up in the morning in a strange bed with no memory of how she got there or where she is. When she looks in the mirror, things turn from bad to worse - who is this middle aged stranger looking back at her? In her last memory she is 20-something and at a party with her best friend.<br />Christine soon learns some disturbing facts: the stranger in the bed next to her is in fact her husband, Ben, who she doesn't remember at all, nor feels any emotional connection to. He tells her that she has suffered a traumatic brain injury when she was 29 years old, and has been suffering from an unusual kind of amnesia ever since. Every time Christine falls asleep, her memory is wiped clean of anything that has happened to her since her early twenties, and every morning she has to rely on Ben to tell her who she is, where she is, and what has happened to her.<br />Whilst Ben is at work, Christine receives a phone call from a doctor who claims to have been in contact with her for some time to help her regain her memory. He tells her that she has been keeping a journal, writing down everything that is happening to her during the day - to replace the memories she cannot retain. When Christine looks through the journal, she reads: \\"Don't trust Ben.\\" It soon becomes apparent to her that Ben is not always telling her the truth. About her accident. About their son (Their son? How can she be a mother and not even remember her own child?). About the mysterious fire which apparently destroyed all their photos. But why would Ben lie to her?<br />Trying to find out the truth, Christine must not only do battle with her own mind playing tricks on her, but with the many inconsistencies in the \\"truths\\" told to her by other people. Especially her husband ....<br />If I could give readers any advice it would be to only pick up this book when they have no other commitments, as it is very addictive. I read it in one night long read-a-thon, so engrossed in the distorted fabric of Christine's recollections that I could not go to sleep without finding out how it would all end. And it was worth it.<br />This beautifully crafted novel challenges every belief I ever held about reality and truth and identity, and the importance of our minds to define who we are. Getting into Christine's mind is a scary journey - like a fragmented mirror only reflecting parts of a whole, her memories appear in short bursts, and she can never be sure what is real and what is not. If there was a living hell, this would surely be one of them.<br />Sure, there were some holes in the story, but all in all the plot was so original and engrossing that the book made for a great read. Christine's voice is engaging and reflects her inner confusion and torment, convincing the reader that all is not as it seems. Every time I thought I had it worked out, some new twist would appear. Though I did cotton on to the plot before all was revealed, I still felt the shock of the massive betrayal through Christine's eyes.<br />A great novel in many ways, and I thoroughly enjoyed the journey.ry addictive.

B007SYWFRM|5.0|Bought it on Kindle Fire. The graphics are really great. There is plenty to do in one sitting so you don't have to wait several hours to have fun. The movie theater plays a short Ice Age film. good game...<br />l
B007V2UGPE|5.0|this is a fun side scrolling game that is very simple and addictive. the graphics are done well and your play options make the game a great time waster :)<br />cheers
B0050QV0RQ|5.0|A very fun rpg  that reminds me of playing rpg's from 20 years ago.  Endearing sprite graphics and characters.  Worth the price of admission, especially in this era of micro transactions based games.
B000VBJEEG|5.0|I enjoy animated movies, crazy little caracters, with a good object lesson about learning how to get along with those who are different from us.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I had no idea what I was getting myself into when i purchased the first book.  I just thought the write up was interesting!!  Mentioned to a friend that I was reading it and she told me that this is the #1 book being sold in N.Y.  Usually I am really up on this stuff.  Well, I am 72, and for the first time in a while I wanted to have great sex!!! I could not put my kindle down...  Immediately bought the next 2... Told everyone I know to read the books.  So many women could not admit that they were sexually aroused.  I love this guy Christian.  He is handsome beyond words. dark, enchanting, and yet he needs nurturing.  I thought it was great the way the characters were developed.  Clearly E.J. needs to write again!!!<br />Thanks for the pleasure!!!!
0307951529|5.0|Two years ago I was lost and really had no idea where I was taking my life; a college student at the time I was kicked out for a semester for bad grades. While trying to ease my self-pity I browsed barnes & nobel (sorry amazon) and saw Chris's first book \\"The Art of Non-Conformity\\". Feeling like an outsider already I decided to buy it and see where it would take me. Needless to say I couldn't put it down and finished it in 9 non-stop hours; it literally changed my life and my way of thinking. From that point I decided I would find a way to become location independent so I could travel the world while self-educating myself.<br /><br />The result: Two years later I'm making $3,000 a month and completely location independent. Some would scoff at the earnings of only $3000 a month but think of it like this - this is $3000 making my own hours, not having a boss, and being able to work in fun places like Santa Cruz, Boliva (which I did this past winter). I'm also two years in to my own \\"self-college\\", teaching myself literature, spanish, and business.<br /><br />The \\"$100 Start-Up\\" is perfect for those wanting to achieve this goal. I wish I had this two years ago because it is thorough, limits the fluff, and gives you ACTIONABLE steps to get things done. It is possible, and Chris has done an amazing job of giving you a blue-print to get there.<br /><br />Bottom Line: Chris changed my life and he can change yours; buy this book and never look back.
B006ON41FC|5.0|I love this game. It's so much fun and the openfeit isn't a problem to me. Works great on the kindle fire.
0738711500|5.0|The cards are beautiful .The book is well written and very informative .I suggest to anyone wanting to learn the tarot
B004P8ITGU|3.0|A good simple story, without the usual twists and turns. The groundwork was there but they failed to fully materialise. Enjoyable
B007J4T2G8|3.0|So I finally finished the most hyped book of the year. What can I say? How can I sum it up? Here goes. . .<br /><br />It was interesting to see how E.L. James showed the similarities between Ana and Christian with those of Bella and Edward. At times when I was reading my mind thought Bella even though the page read Ana. Ana was more so Bella than Christian was Edward. Ana is clumsy, her mom's had multiple marriages. The both live in the state of Washington.<br /><br />I really enjoyed the beginning of the book. It was LOL funny. And a lot of what made it funny was the parody on Twilight in my opinion. I enjoyed the email banter between Ana and Christian. That was a highlight of the book for me. I loved it when she referred to Christian's stalker tendencies.<br /><br />Perhaps after 30% into reading, the book got tedious and it never let up. It took me a full 5 days to read this. I'm so glad the Kindle has a built in dictionary because I think E.L. James was playing around with her thesaurus just like she had Ana accuse Christian of doing. There were words that I'd never heard of before. One that sticks out was \\"avuncular.\\" Why not just say uncle. And if I hear about Ana clambering onto the bed again I'll have to scream.<br /><br />Now this book is suppose to be erotica. Well it's not. I did not get hot once. And good erotic will do that to you. There were some scenes that I think were written for shock value such as the toothbrush and tampon scenes. Those just grossed me out. My fave erotica writers include Selena Kitt, Emma Holly, Maya Banks, Lena Matthews, Lora Leigh's earlier works.<br /><br />If this is your first introduction to \\"mommy porn\\" you'll probably not recover from true erotica!<br /><br />P.S. Twilight wins hands down over 50 Shades!
B0080BFWAE|5.0|First off, I can't believe it has been 25 years since Adventures in Babysitting was released to our local theaters!  Since the DVD version of the film was a bare bones edition (not even a trailer), I hope this 25th Anniversary Edition finally does this film justice with hopefully a commentary track, original making of featurettes, a where are they now documentary and original promotional materials (teasers, trailers, tv spots) and the actors recollections of behind the scenes and what it took to bring this film to the big screen.  I would call this film a guilty pleasure, a film that you would never admit to liking in public, but watch the film when it's on television.  Enjoy!
B001IYCMNA|1.0|I am a small business owner. I own and utilize quite a collection of Cisco and Linksys products. Let's see, I have a Cisco PIX router, RVS4000 router, UC320 / SPA8800 / SPA504G Phone system, 3 Linksys WAP54G's that all funtion well and then there's this \\"Piece of Crap\\" WAP4410N (access point) that I purchased through Amazon. This thing was a pain in the ass right out of the box. I called Cisco and I gave them the serial number. They told me that the unit was out of warranty. I had to email them my Amazon receipt in order to get any help. The tech rep helped me access the device and load updated firmware. This damn Access Point will never stay connected for more than about 5 minutes.<br /><br />It is now a year since my purchase and I was trying to connect my laptop wirelessly today and I encountered every kind of strange behavior from the WAP4410N that you can imagine. If I power cycle it I can get it to connect for about 5 minutes and then it drops. I downloaded and installed 2.0.4.2 Firmware. I set up the security settings and entered a new USERNAME/PASSWORD and SAVED my settings. I then accessed the GUI with the new username and password. A few minutes later the GUI indicated that I had used an incorrect username and/or password. Now it required the default admin/admin username and password, which indicates that it independently reset itself to factory settings. I've never owned a more frustrating wireless access point. Typically Cisco support is quite good and I will likely give them more of my business, but the WAP4410N is one Cisco device I regret buying, even more than the SPA9000/SPA400 phone system (which was also a disaster). Amazon should suspend sales of this device.

B007WUV302|4.0|Storm Corrosion, the collaboration between Mikael Akerfeldt of Opeth and Steven Wilson of Porcupine Tree, offers some intriguing, unpredictable journeys into what I would describe as mood music. A few words that occur to me while listening are dreamlike, lush, serene, hypnotic, mellow, haunting, ethereal, exotic, and, at times, dark. Beautiful acoustic work and captivating ambient passages intertwine for some entrancing zone-out music; it's easy to get lost in the soft, poignant melodies of each song. For me, it took a few listens to really absorb the multiple layers of sound and appreciate how it all flows together. I listened to the first track Drag Ropes once and thought it was ok, then I listened to it a second time and thought it was pretty great. By the third time, I loved it, and the rest of the album had much the same effect. Now I have to hear it every day, sometimes more than once.<br /><br />The albums's six songs alternate between strange, surreal ambience and delicate, melancholic folk. There's a stark contrast from dark to light between the first two songs, Drag Ropes and the album's title track. Drag Ropes is at times nightmarish, especially coupled with the Tim Burton-esque video released for it, while Storm Corrosion is a beautiful track, its haunting acoustic reminiscent of Opeth's Orchid (or even Led Zeppelin or early Black Sabbath). The tone shifts back into darkness with Hag's rhythmic pulse and odd section of semi-heavy guitars and the album's only spurt of drumming. Then, Happy mixes the strangely warped acoustic sound of Watershed with lighter, Still Life melodies akin to songs like The Moor or Benighted. After this, it's back into more trippy territory with Lock Howl, a brilliant instrumental that I wish was at least twice as long as it is. Ljudet Innan closes soft and serene, with some of Mikael's most ambitious vocals to date in the opening minutes. My only complaint is that this album isn't longer, the six songs clocking in at close to 48 minutes. I would've gladly taken a couple more ten-minute tracks; I just can't seem to get enough of this music. Great stuff by Mikael and Steven.<br /><br />As for the mp3 Special Edition...where are the instrumental tracks?  Not having a Blu-ray player, I didn't buy the Blu-ray edition, which features demo versions of Drag Ropes and Hag, as well as instrumentals of all six songs on the album (Lock Howl is the same).  I've listened to all of these tracks online, and they're great, but I've been waiting for mp3's to be made available.  And now they only offer the two demo tracks for a Special Edition?  I'll definitely get these two demos, which have enough differences from the final versions to justify having them, but I'm really disappointed that I can only listen to the instrumentals online.  It would've been good for Roadrunner to release them on mp3 for those of us without Blu-ray players.  People would still be enticed to buy the Blu-ray since it has a 5.1 mix of the entire album, just like people are enticed to buy the CD since the tracks Storm Corrosion and Ljudet Innan aren't available on mp3.  So, five stars for the album itself and three for the missing instrumentals averages to four for the entire product.  They should've made all the bonus tracks available here.minutes.

B000002KE2|5.0|Black Sabbath:  Vol. 4 is yet another legendary album from the original line-up of Ozzy, Tony, Geezer, and Bill.  After the dark, headbanging metal of their third album, Master of Reality, Vol. 4 sees Sabbath return to a more laid-back, groovy vibe, sounding in style, guitar tone, and vocals more like their debut album than either of its two predecessors.  It has more of a rock vibe than Paranoid or Master of Reality, with stronger blues influences.  It's definitely nowhere near as dark in tone as Master of Reality.  Although Vol. 4 contains many throwback elements to their debut, it also introduces some new ideas.  Wheels of Confusion has a tambourine-fueled hippie jam at the end, and Changes was the most ambitious balladry Sabbath had attempted up to that point.  Besides these great songs, Vol. 4 includes several classics, like Tomorrow's Dream, album highlight Supernaut, longtime live staple Snowblind, Cornucopia, the instrumental Laguna Sunrise, and frequently covered album closer Under the Sun.  Without question, Vol. 4 is a must-have for any fan of Black Sabbath or Ozzy.  The fourth release from the most important band in heavy metal history is a keeper.

0345803485|1.0|I would have given \\"Fifty shades of Grey\\" a zero rating but I couldnt.<br />This book is no better than that aweful twilight series... I couldnt even read it all. I got about halfway and had to stop. Is it just me or is the fact that Christian sounds exactly like King Henry the 8th from the Tudor series? Not to mention the fact that she keeps mentioning the Tudors often (Again only got to halfway in the book ) I think the author has a serious thing for Johnathan Rhys Myers....  Her main character acts exactly like him in Match point as well. Maybe its just me, maybe she is just a huge fan and had to let it out some how, either way the book was terrible, unless your a twilight fan and love reading about plain jane women characters who are clumsy, then the book is for you.
B006NXIDMU|4.0|After seeing the movie I decided to read the book (not only to see how it is, but so that I could find out what happens in the next one), and I do not regret it at all. The book offers an insight into Katniss' thoughts that the movie just can not achieve, and the extra level of detail provides a much greater understanding into the film. A fun and easy read for anyone.

I was on holiday at the four seasons in Sharm El Sheik and had 4 days relaxing by the sea on the beach...I couldn't put the book down. I finished it in three days. Just so fun and entertaining and the author is a fabulous writer; smart, creative and what an imagination. Bravo!
B007WV05GY|1.0|Okay, here is the good... Okay, here is the bad-the start, the middle, Okay, here is the ugly-the ending. This movie will make you howl.
B007VYDFMS|5.0|I watched this movie the day it came out and I loved it. This goes beyond most other music documentaries I have seen.  This is very well shot and looks amazing. Some very real and raw footage is used to take you into the life and the man that was Bob Marley. I would recommend this to ANY Marley fan or someone that is interested in him and his music. Bunny Wailer is great in this. And his kids give accurate and honest accounts of growing up with Marley. So sit back with a some mellow mood tea and enjoy this beautiful movie.
B005DC68NI|5.0|As a total ignorant in the field of self-publishing I came to this book, in the hope that it would give me a glimpse of what it's about, and possibly get some encouragement to publish some of my work. It not only made me feel like I know a good bit about it, but showed signs of where I can further inform myself, and really encouraged me. But something I didn't expect I also  found, and it was amusement with the subtle sense of humor and the laid-back style of the author, who treats the reader as someone intelligent, giving advice only when necessary, and not confounding lack of information with dumbness (as sometimes it happens in how-tos). Also, contrary to a reviewer, I found great value in the last part of the book, because we get to have a good perspective on different approaches and experiences with digital self-publishing. Get to it!

B0071XO8RA|4.0|When I borrowed this book from a coworker I had no idea how impressed I would be. The first novella was a stand alone masterpiece that left me glad I had the whole compilation because I was eager for more. There were sections in the middle that moved a bit slow. But overall this is a great read. I am looking forward to getting First Shift.

B0043X1FL8|4.0|A three-hankie movie. Heart-breaking and also inspiring. This was an especially deep one for me because the action takes place in a hospital for chronic patients, mostly mental patients, that reminded me quite painfully of where my father spent most of my life. He was in the locked ward at Norristown State Hospital from 1962 until his death in 1995.<br /><br />Robin Williams plays Dr. Malcolm Sayer, and he is a real doctor (or was in 1990). He was trained in neurology, and had never really worked with patients before coming to Bainbridge Hospital in 1969. Robert DeNiro plays Leonard Lowe, a patient who had been catatonic for something over 30 years.<br /><br />Dr. Sayer found the common link between him and quite a few other catatonic patients in the hospital: they had all had encephalitis years earlier. He studied their conditions, noted that many of them would catch a tennis ball if he threw it toward them, and found that an electroencephalogram showed a reaction when he spoke Leonard's name aloud.<br /><br />Dr. Sayer concluded that their symptoms had something in common with Parkinson's Disease. He noted that the new drug L-Dopa was being given to Parkinson's patients with good results, and persuaded the hospital to allow him to administer it to Leonard Lowe with his mother's permission. Leonard woke up.<br /><br />Eventually Dr. Sayer administered it to about a dozen other catatonic patients and woke them up, too. They didn't even know what year it was, or how old they were, but gradually adjusted pretty well to the differences.<br /><br />Without giving too much away, let me say that the above is barely half the movie, and what happens next is the hardest part.
B003EYVXVY|5.0|THe 3d version which is only available when you buy a panasonic tv or blu ray player. (at least for now) THis version is the same one you saw in the movie theater, there are no extras at all on it. I have it and the other set on blu ray with all the extra footage (extnede version blu ray set).  The story itself isn't the best, I disliked the fact that it was the u.s. military in the future trying to take over another planet. It should have been a corporate army!  Oh well, the acting is fine and the effects were ground breaking. This movie changed special effects to a huge degree and for that , I wanted this on blu ray and 3d blu ray.  This will probably go out someday on 3d in a general release in the future. SO I don't know if I would pay 125.00 for the 3d version. Unless you are buying a panasonic tv or blu ray player,in that case you will get this one for free.  So the 3d version is the original version and this looks great on 3d blu ray.  Top quality.  the story is a three star one imo, but the effects pump this one up to a five star release on 3d blu ray. On 2d I would rate that extended set at 4 star for all the extras.
B003LR5BD0|3.0|If you like detective stories, you will probably like this. But don't expect \\"whodunnit\\" to be the main issue; that is disclosed fairly early on. It's more who is going to find out, what are going to be the consequences, and how are the various characters going to get themselves out of the fine mess they've gotten into.<br /><br />Al Pacino play Detective Will Dormer, invited to a small town in northern Alaska to help with a murder and also to get him out of LA, where an Internal Affairs investigation is cooking. His partner Hap is with him, and explains that he is going to have to make a deal with IA to save his own skin and protect his family. He says Dormer won't be dragged into the mess, but Dormer insists he will be. (We find out later why.)<br /><br />Dormer and Hap are met by an attractive young female local detective who is to work with them. She's smart, and she idolizes Dormer. She did her case study at the academy on one of his most famous cases. The local police chief is a friend of Dormer's, and it was undoubtedly he who asked for Dormer to come and assist.<br /><br />The case is the brutal murder of an 18-yea-old girl whose body was found naked in the garbage dump. Dormer immediately notices some unusual features about the body, and finds some useful evidence at the girl's home. (Nah, not going to tell you what.) He and the local cops interview the girl's boyfriend, but Dormer is convinced he was not the killer. (Not going to tell you why, either.)<br /><br />The primary suspect turns out to be a mystery writer who lives about 15 miles away (Robin Williams) who has befriended the girl because she wanted to be a writer, and because she needed someone to talk to. He's very smooth, this one; after all he's a writer of murder mysteries, and knows how police operate.<br /><br />The title refers to the fact that it is high summer, and the sun basically never goes down. Dormer can't sleep, and he is tormented by, among other things, phone calls from the writer in the wee small hours of the morning because he can't sleep either. Eventually, Dormer is so in need of sleep that he's going really nuts. Practically gets himself killed falling asleep while driving, and eventually begins having hallucinations. He's determined to crack the case before he cracks up, and he does. In a way.<br /><br />Watch it; you'll be glad I didn't tell you too much.r in the wee small hours of the morning because he can't sleep either.

0345803485|5.0|Ok so I don't read Romance Novels and this was talked about so much I had to get it. I LOVE IT!! Honestly, Ana's innocence and inexperience is very much like that of a woman of no sexual experience. The thoughts that go through her head are pretty accurate in a situation such as she is in (in my opinion). I laughed pretty hard at many parts such as the joking that goes back and forth in e-mails and other humorous ideas that go through Ana's head. Her thoughts are very similar to a girl who believes they are in love for the first time and it makes you smile because you remember being that girl (for us women readers anyways lol). I would suggest this book to my friends :)
B002VWNID6|5.0|Kevin Costner plays Robin of Locksley, Morgan Freeman plays his Moorish friend Azem, Alan Rickman is very Snape-like as the Sheriff of Nottingham, and Sean Connery makes a cameo appearance as Richard the Lion-Hearted. Marian is both beautiful and brave and played by Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio (someone I'd never heard of before). I have to say this is the best version of Robin Hood I have ever seen.<br /><br />Of course, many people have told this tale over the years, and added or subtracted elements as they chose. But the bulk of the story as I remember from my childhood is here. Little John and Friar Tuck, and the merry men. Adding the Moor was easy: Robin saved his life during the crusades, and so he followed Robin until he could pay back the debt. Actually, I only know about four versions of the story, and one of those was Disney done with animated animals, so I can't be sure whether any given element is original with this particular film.<br /><br />Scenes are lavish, the costumes are amazing, the stunts wonderful, the action bold and yet possible to follow (mostly), the characters flesh and blood people (except perhaps for Nottingham's witch), a lot of amusement along with the serious story, what more could anyone want?<br /><br />Maybe a little more of that delicious King Richard . . .

B0001I55OC|3.0|An appealing enough story, but a little too chaotic for my tastes, and too involved with warfare.<br /><br />Professor Johnston (Billy Connolly) is an archeologist excavating the ruins of a castle that was destroyed during the hundred years war, in April of 1357. His son Chris (Paul Walker) haunts the site mostly because his father's assistant, Kate Ericson (Frances O'Connor) is there, and he is smitten. He acknowledges that he does not care much for history.<br /><br />Nearby, Robert Doniger (David Thewlis aka Remus Lupin in the Harry Potter series) runs a scientific laboratory that accidentally opened a worm-hole in space-time. They want to learn as much as they can about what's on the other end of the worm-hole, and give Professor Johnston a chance to go back to the time of the battle that destroyed the castle in order to find out. When he does not come back after two days, Kate, Chris, and several of Professor Johnston's other students go to the lab and demand answers.<br /><br />The lab is ready for them; they are to go back and rescue the professor. Most of the action therefore takes place in 1357 in the middle of a historic battle.<br /><br />Most stories about time travel make large efforts to avoid time paradoxes, but when a lens from the Professor's glasses and a note in his handwriting pleading for help are found in a chest which has been buried for some 600 years, we already know paradoxes are going to be involved. I tried very hard to keep track of them, but gave up when I realized that they were indeed going to change the course of history, and since they did indeed exist in the 20th century (21st?), apparently the changes were not of the sort to destroy us all.<br /><br />It's entertaining, but would be a great deal more so if I had paid attention in history and/or followed the things my Society for Creative Anachronisms friends told me about the weapons and warfare of the period. After they got back to the past, I just sort of sat back and let the story unfold.ory unfold.

B00004WG2F|5.0|A western family saga that is anything but typical. For one thing, it is in Montana, and not a part of the typical western genre. For another, some really superb talent was recruited for this story. Anthony Hopkins plays the father, William Ludlow. The oldest brother, Alfred, is played by Aidan Quinn, who does a great job of expressing all the changes Alfred goes through. The middle brother, Tristan, is played by Brad Pitt with long hair and wild ways, in part because he was largely raised by his father's Indian friend. The youngest brother, Samuel, is played by Henry Thomas. He is charming and lovable, and so of course he's the one to die in World War One. Sam's beautiful fiance Susanna, played by Julia Ormond, waited for him at home on the ranch with his father.<br /><br />Where is William's wife in all this? She departed long ago, saying she hated the ranch, and is mostly known through letters she writes in her elegant Victorian parlor in some city. We never even find out what city.<br /><br />When Alfred and Tristan come back from the war, grieving for their brother, they both fall in love with Susanna. And lest you think I've told you too much of the plot, let's just say that all this was basically revealed on the cover of the DVD. There's more, lots and lots more. And not predictable or boring. The beautiful scenery, wonderful costumes and sets, and Brad Pitt his sexy self, certainly make this a visually stunning movie. The intensity and complexity of relationships and emotions are well done, never over done. You get the strong feeling everyone really wants to understand each other and be good to one another, but they screw up in a variety of ways.<br /><br />Even if Brad Pitt's naked body doesn't send you into rapture, you're still going to love this movie.

6305127697|4.0|Well, I figured out the final, final outcome -- I think the very last line of the dialog -- but not until a minute or two ahead. So it puts me only slightly ahead of the attorney in the case. But he figured out the next to last surprise before I did . . . or about the same time.<br /><br />It's that kind of a suspense film.<br /><br />Aaron Stampler (Edward Norton) is arrested for the really gory, disgusting mutilation murder of Bishop Richard Rushman. Marty Vale (Richard Gere) volunteers to defend him pro bono. Assistant DA Janet Venable (Laura Linney) is assigned the prosecution. The twist is that she had an affair with Vale back when he was working for the DA, before he went out on his own as a defense attorney.<br /><br />Aaron insists he did not do it, despite some pretty terrible evidence against him. Vale originally tells him it doesn't matter, that his job is to defend him anyway, but gradually becomes convinced that Aaron really is innocent as he discovers some pretty strange connections between the Bishop and various other interests who might have wanted to kill him, and some other . . . see, I'm trying not to spoil it for you. OK; Aaron was an alter boy and a choir boy, even though he was 19. He lived in a group home run by the church for homeless kids, even though the cut-off age for residency was 18. The Bishop arranged for him to stay.<br /><br />When Vale's investigator goes to Aaron's room at the shelter to search for any useful evidence, he is attacked by one of the other choir boys, and in the process rips off the boy's earring. Yes, Aaron can identify it, and won't say that the boy with the earring was completely incapable of murdering the Bishop.<br /><br />Told you too much already. Watch the strangeness unfold on its own. And try to guess the end of the trial. Then try to guess the end of the movie. Good luck.
B004MNVKVO|2.0|I read other reviewers' opinions that the quality of this recording was poor.  But I though, hey, this is Blu Ray audio - they must be crazy.  So I ordered it... and now I am sending it back.  The sound on this is indeed extremely poor.  Do yourself a favor and get the Chronicles CD - it will give you all the high points of Moving Pictures, and then some, with better audio.
6305949980|4.0|I'm sure most of my friends are surprised that I've never seen this movie before, but you must remember that I've only owned a DVD player for about three and a half years [written in 2009], and almost never went to movies in theaters before that. I didn't know anything about Tim Burton until I discovered Johnny Depp, and I thought Depp was going to be the voice of Jack Skellington, the Pumpkin King. But it's OK that he's not: it's still a very fun movie.<br /><br />The basic premise is that all the holidays come from their own towns, accessible through hollow trees that stand in a ring with symbols of the holidays involved on each one. One has a profile of a turkey, one a red heart, one a painted egg, another a pumpkin, and one a decorated tree. I think there were others, but I don't remember exactly. The narrator takes us through the pumpkin shaped door into the world of Halloween Town, which is supposed to be very scary and spooky, but is mostly funny, and perhaps would be gross if they weren't animations. The Mayor is a roly-poly character with two faces, one grinning and one menacing, who wears a badge saying \\"Mayor\\" and who says, \\"I'm only an elected official; I can't make decisions by myself.\\" The real hero is Jack, the Pumpkin King. He's every bit as skinny as a skeleton except that he wears a black pin-striped suit.<br /><br />But Jack is bored of the same old thing every year, and goes wandering off to bemoan his fate, finally discovering the ring of trees with the doors to other holidays. He goes into the one for Christmas and is overwhelmed. It's wonderful! All bright lights and happy people, and he wants it for his own.<br /><br />Then there is Sally, Dr. Finkelstein's creation, a sweet blue girl who is his slave. She's all stitches, and can break off an arm or a leg as necessary, sewing it back when there's time. She's in love with Jack, and Finkelstein keeps her from him except for when she puts a sleeping potion in his food so she can get away.<br /><br />So when Jack comes back to Halloween Town to get everyone hyped up to make Christmas this year, he asks Sally to make a Santa Claus costume for him. He's misunderstood, and thinks it is Sandy Claws who is in charge of Christmas, and something frightening instead of beloved. When the Boogie's boys go and capture Santa Claus for him, he looks at him and declares, \\"Why you have hands! Where are your claws?\\"<br /><br />No, I'm not going to spoil it. Much of the fun is the music and the visual effects of the various characters in Halloween Town, and the gifts and toys they make for Christmas. But there is a plot (all puns intended), and the basic question is how can Halloween and Christmas get back to their proper spheres?<br /><br />Anyone over the age of 5 or 6 will probably love this one, right up to 95 or 96.br />So when Jack comes back to Halloween Town to get everyone hyped up to make Christmas this year, he asks Sally to make a Santa Claus costume for him.

B0071LLHO4|4.0|The other review for this edition of \\"Dare\\" is very thorough, and identified the tracks very carefully.  One thing to note that I found odd: despite including all kinds of remixes and instrumental versions of the songs, this editions does NOT include the basic radio edit of Fascination.  I actually like it better than the \\"extended\\" version included here, but that's my only quibble with the tracks included.<br /><br />The package itself is nice enough.  It comes in a sturdy square cardboard box with inserts.  The Dare and Fascination CD's come in square Japanese style reproduction sleeves.  They printed on rather flimsy cardboard, but they look great.  Also included a booklet and 12\\" cover repros.  Very nice for collectors!
630587493X|4.0|I adore Robin Williams. So why am I shaving one star off what would otherwise be a delightful vehicle for Williams' massive talent? I'm not sure I can explain, but let's just say that a few things grated on me.<br /><br />The Martin family buys a positronic robot to help with household chores, but finds that he is worth much more. Named Andrew from Little Miss's attempt to say \\"android,\\" it turns out that he somehow developed in a way his manufacturers had not anticipated. Somehow he has developed creativity and emotions. There seems to be an implication that these two wholly unexpected traits are somehow linked. At one point Mr. Martin takes him to the manufacturer to ask questions about him, and the company wants to buy him back (after offering \\"replacement or refund\\") and dissect him to discover what has \\"gone wrong.\\" Mr. Martin refuses, and thereafter gives Andrew some time each day to make things.<br /><br />Andrew learns. Eventually he makes so many beautiful clocks that Mr. Martin sells them, and opens a bank account for Andrew to receive the fruit of his labors. An android with a bank account? What could he possibly want money for?<br /><br />We will find out, as we will also find out what happens when Andrew goes on a quest to find any surviving robots of the same model number. Why? He needs family. Oddly enough he find it, but not the way he expected.
B007549YM4|1.0|I agree with the reviewer, who says that there is no redeeming value to this movie.  I would give it zero stars, if possible.  I have also collected many movies of all types, over 3,000, and have quite a strong stomach.  But I don't know how the actors were even induced to play out such depravity.  I was sickened and only finished watching (fast forwarding through many parts), because I was curious to find out what happened in the end -- which was also pointless, I might add.  I suppose if there is one lesson we can learn from this, it's the horror humans are capable of unleashing on each other under certain circumstances.  We shouldn't, for example, say that things like the Holocaust can't happen, as some ignorantly do.  But truly, as far as this film goes, I would have to say worthless is the best word to describe it.
B0002KVUKM|5.0|It's VERY unusual for me to give a horror movie five stars. But then this is a very unusual movie.<br /><br />Probably most of you know that Gabriel Van Helsing (Hugh Jackson) appears in the Dracula story as the one who knows most about vampires, and is dedicated to fighting them. This is the same character, in a way, but almost nothing else about this is the same.<br /><br />This Van Helsing, a very attractive and capable young-looking man, is actually some 400 years old. He's also working for a secret order of priests who send him out to kill Dracula (Richard Roxburgh). Along the way, he encounters a variety of nasty creatures, including Frankenstein's monster, a werewolf, Jekyl/Hyde and three Brides of Dracula, who are of course also vampires. Then there is their numerous offspring . . .<br /><br />Igor, originally Dr. Frankenstein's assistant, is working for Count Dracula by this time, since when Dracula loaned Dr. F an abandoned castle in which to reproduce his original work, the count was paying Igor's salary.<br /><br />Two more characters are critical to the story. I can tell you very little about Prince Velcan Valericus without spoiling several surprises, but Princess Anna Valericus is a beautiful, strong, fearless young woman who becomes Van Helsing's ally -- or he becomes hers. The Valericus family has tried to kill Dracula for hundreds of years, so far without success, and with major losses. In fact, the family will be lost entirely if Prince Velcan and Princess Anna do not survive.<br /><br />This is a major high action movie, with incredible special effects, that kept reminding me of the recent Zorro movies: there's a good bit of humor mixed in with all the blood and gore. And there is plenty of blood and gore, but somehow it didn't bother me so much as in most horror movies. I think it has something to do with the entire thing being in the realm of the supernatural, and therefore not nearly as frightening as psychotic murderers and the like that might be real.<br /><br />Unless you really can't handle horror stories at all, I think you will appreciate this movie. Van Helsing is just the right sort of hero, and even wears a hat rather like Indiana Jones.be real.<br /><br />Unless you really can't handle horror stories at all, I think you will appreciate this movie.

B00003CXPD|4.0|I'm a sucker for movies based on true stories. This is one such, about a young English boy from a striking coal mining family who defies his father's prejudice against dancing (\\"It's all poofs, you know.\\") to learn ballet. In fact, he learns from Mrs. Weasley, in a way. That is, the actress who plays his teacher also plays Molly Weasley in the Harry Potter series. In fact, the two characters have a lot in common. Kind-hearted but tough and not into taking any BS from anyone.<br /><br />The plot is a little thin and pretty predictable, but the kid is very appealing and the story is well told. I've been trying to think what my favorite scene is, and I guess it is his audition for the Royal Ballet School. He's so nervous he takes a minute to get started, but then he flies! He shows the panel he can do a huge variety of moves very well, and there they sit, trying to keep straight faces. I guess the British are better at that than I'm accustomed to, but there's a recognizable look of astonishment on several faces.<br /><br />But the last question they ask him really made it for me: \\"Billy, what does it feel like when you are dancing?\\" He's not very articulate, but gradually he warms up to the description, and we find that he's almost a poet as well as a dancer. He's a likeable kid, and you feel good for him when he gets admitted to the school. (Oh, I'm not giving anything away there; you can tell by the clock on your DVD player.)
B007PS0X0W|1.0|This is a review of the movie, not the streaming quality. That movie was pointless. There was no story line I could get behind. I don't watch these movies with high expectations, but some entertainment value is hoped for. The last Underworld movie was at least entertaining - it had a deeply human story that, while common, still gave the viewers something they could feel. This was as flat and disappointing as a soda left open for several hours.
B00004XPPE|4.0|If you liked Dr. Strangelove, you should see this. This is the serious movie which was spoofed by Strangelove.<br /><br />Henry Fonda plays the President (never given a last name, only a title), Walter Matthau plays Dr. Groeteschele, which was presumably the model for Strangelove. Larry Hagman (wasn't he in a sitcom later? Maybe \\"I Dream of Jeannie\\" or something?) is the interpreter sitting in the war room with The President. Dom DeLuise, looking amazingly young, is a sergeant who keeps his head when higher ranking officers are losing theirs.<br /><br />The basic story is about the nuclear-equipped planes which are kept in the air at all times so as to respond quickly to a war emergency. As I understand it, this movie had the effect of pointing out some major flaws in the system and having them changed. Their was a UFO on the radar: not an alien ship, but simply an unidentified one. The planes are to go to their fail-safe points and be ready, and generally receive a return to base signal and all is fine. But once the UFO was identified as a commercial plane that had malfunctioned and therefore was unidentifiable, one of the fail-safe planes did not get the message to return to base. It takes awhile to find out why this happened, but in the meantime they have opened their sealed orders and found that their target is Moscow.<br /><br />So there they are on their way to Moscow, their radio is jammed, there's some screw-ups in the electronic equipment, and what can be done? Dr. Groeteschele says turn it into a full-scale war, since a strike on Moscow is going to make it that anyway, and if we act at once, we have a chance to wipe out enough of the USSR that they will simply surrender. General Black says no, we need to convince the Soviets that it was an error, and ask them to shoot down the bombers.<br /><br />There are lots of things wrong with every possible choice, and I certainly will not ruin it for you by telling you how it plays out. Let's just say that it raised the hairs on the back of my head when I saw it as a teenager, and it just did it again tonight after all these years.<br /><br />Not for the faint of heart.the hairs on the back of my head when I saw it as a teenager, and it just did it again tonight after all these years.<br /><br />Not for the faint of heart.
B005CMSDLE|4.0|I did not know what to expect when I purchased this movie.  I was pleasantly surprised once I watched it.  Great action, but a rather strange plot.
0800141806|5.0|It's a very personal drama, but it is also significantly a courtroom drama, which I happen to love. It also includes three actors I love: Tom Hanks, Denzel Washington, and Antonio Banderas. How can it lose?<br /><br />Andrew Beckett (Hanks) is fired from his law firm when the partners discover he has AIDS. They set him up with a phoney incompetence incident (complaint due that day disappears, reappears as mysteriously within minutes of time to get it to the courthouse) which he can see right through. So he wants to file a suit for wrongful termination. Joe Miller (Washington) is the ninth attorney he consults, who is plainly homophobic. In fact, his wife calls him out on it, and he admits it. However, after he catches Beckett in the law library trying to prepare the case for himself (It's a long-standing legal tradition that a lawyer who represents himself has a fool for a client.), and being hassled by the library clerk, he decides to accept the case.<br /><br />Antonio Banderas plays Beckett's boyfriend, who has been taught how to give him his IV treatments so he doesn't have to be forever in hospital or clinic, and is generally a very likeable partner. It's easy to see why they love each other; they're both attractive, intelligent and compassionate.<br /><br />And that's what a lot of the story is about: the audience, the jury, and the general public are forced to face the fact that gay people are people. Seen through the lens of the old partners of his firm, who tell crude homophobic jokes in the steam room of the athletic club, the response is that they probably did not know he was gay. But one partner \\"suspected,\\" as he brought out. And another had worked with a woman who had AIDS at a previous firm, mentioning in his testimony that he had the greatest sympathy for people like her who got this terrible disease \\"through no fault of their own.\\" She testified that she had a blood transfusion after her second child was born, and that's how she got AIDS. The implication, of course, was that he had no sympathy for people who got it through homosexual activity. One of the jurors is heard to comment under his breath, \\"Got what was coming to him.\\"<br /><br />Funny side story: The lead trial lawyer for the firm, played by Mary Steenbengen, had the bitch female attorney role so down pat I had to look at the credits to make sure she was not being played by someone I knew at the Superior Court in Santa Cruz. Actually, I think I've seen her play female attorneys before, probably in one or more of Robert Grisham's excellent courtroom dramas.<br /><br />Fine movie, something of a tear jerker, but also a real eye-opener to the biases against gays and victims of AIDS.

One of the jurors is heard to comment under his breath, \\"Got what was coming to him.\\"<br /><br />Funny side story: The lead trial lawyer for the firm, played by Mary Steenbengen, had the bitch female attorney role so down pat I had to look at the credits to make sure she was not being played by someone I knew at the Superior Court in Santa Cruz. Actually, I think I've seen her play female attorneys before, probably in one or more of Robert Grisham's excellent courtroom dramas.<br /><br />Fine movie, something of a tear jerker, but also a real eye-opener to the biases against gays and victims of AIDS.

6305313687|3.0|Well, it's pretty violent and about every third word starts with F, but it's an important story, and based on a true story. I'm a sucker for movies based on true stories.<br /><br />Derek Vinyard is a hate-filled white supremicist, a skinhead with a huge swastika tattooed on his chest. One night he's banging his girlfriend when his younger brother Danny notices the sound of someone breaking into Derek's truck. He looks out his bedroom window and there's a black guy trying to rip off the truck. He interrupts Derek's activities to tell him, and Derek goes out in his underwear with his semi-automatic weapon and guns down the thief and one accomplice. One of them is not dead, and raises his arm begging for mercy. The audience does not see until later how Derek responded.<br /><br />But Danny saw. Danny idolized his older brother and shaved his head, too. He also had several tattoos. Most of the story is told in flash-backs from the day Derek is released from prison and comes back to his largely dysfunctional family.<br /><br />Derek changed while he was in the prison at Chino, and I was just glad that the credit was not given to religion. Instead, his English teacher (later principal of the school when Danny is there) is the one who deserves some of the credit. I'm not going to tell you who else gets the credit for turning Derek into a decent fellow.<br /><br />When Danny turned in a history paper all about Adolf Hitler, his teacher (who used to date his mother) goes to the principal and wants him thrown out. The principal is not prepared to give up on Danny, and tells him that from now on he will be Danny's history teacher. They will call the class American History X, and Danny's first assignment is to write an essay all about his brother and his influence on him and on the community.<br /><br />Not gonna tell you any more. You just have to see it develop. Grit your teeth about the language and the violence; it's about some hard issues that are very real.
0345803507|3.0|We've already established that E.L. James is not a writer; and while she's able to survive on a solidly sexy story-line in the original installment of this trilogy, each new book slips seemingly further from this erotic ideal. In other words, there is no \\"kinky funkery\\" to be had here. Romance and flowers, folks. Romance and flowers! The story is basically the same as it has always been: Christian and Anastasia fight, funk, and forgive only to do it all again (and not always in this order). There's the usual tension in between sex sessions - ex-lovers rearing their ugly heads, a crazed ex-boss, a kidnapped sibling - but it all amounts to a whole lot more of the same 'ole, same 'ole. Ultimately, \\"Freed\\" ends on a big, flowery romantic note that leaves so very many fantasies yet unfulfilled. Predictable ending? Yep. Sad to see the trilogy end? Actually, yes. While they may never become the Romeo and Juliet of their generation, Christian and Anastasia are enjoyable enough characters to make for the perfect, mindless guilty pleasure - and I confess I am guilty as sin!
B004SIP9U6|5.0|Joseph Fiennes plays Shakespeare, Gweneth Paltrow plays Viola DeLesseps, the lady with which he is in love. This movie attempts to express where Will got his ideas for some of his most famous lines. The balcony scene in Romeo & Juliet, for example, is seen first as Shakespeare beneath Viola's balcony. She has been offered in marriage to the Earl of Wessex, who has vast estates in Virginia but is cash poor. Her father is a wealthy merchant and, like so many of their time (1593), essentially purchases an aristocrat's estate with his daughter and a large dowry.<br /><br />But there's a problem on Will's side, too: Anne Hathaway and her two children. So these are star-crossed lovers indeed.<br /><br />Viola is enamored of the stage, which is not really proper for a young lady in those days. Indeed, she dreams of being an actor, which is illegal. Boys play all the female parts. But Viola is determined, and dresses in male attire to try out for the role of Romeo. At first, nobody knows she is a woman, but Will finds out after he is already in love with her as a woman.<br /><br />Viola is actually very good as Romeo, playing with great passion the role Will taught her in bed, in effect. The boy playing Juliet is pretty good, too, and it makes for some strange scenes, as when they do the dance and \\"hand to hand\\" conversation at the beginning. But she also does things like go to the wrong side when the dancing master says \\"ladies to the right, gentlemen to the left.\\"<br /><br />Meanwhile, in her female persona, Viola is presented to Queen Elizabeth for permission for Wessex to marry her. It is clear that the Queen suspects something is mixed up about all this, but she reluctantly gives her consent to the match. She quietly tells Wessex he is an old fool for wanting to marry Viola, who will only give him grief. She does not say why.<br /><br />The rather slapstick manner in which the play is rehearsed, the problems with the money-lender who wants his money taken out of the theater owner's hide, and Wessex's suspicion that someone else is playing with his love, all complicate the issues, mostly in amusing ways. For example, Will had originally called the play he expected to write \\"Romeo & Edith, the Pirate's Daughter,\\" so the actors who expected to play pirates keep bugging him about it. The theater owner had asked for him to write a comedy, because that was what the public wanted. So he keeps asking where the funny parts are. There are ongoing gags about the limited capabilities of the cast, and the lines they use that we recognize from Shakespeare's real plays.<br /><br />I recommend it for people knowledge about Shakespeare's plays for one level, and for those who are not familiar with them for a completely different set of reasons. In sum, I think everyone will enjoy this movie.eater owner's hide, and Wessex's suspicion that someone else is playing with his love, all complicate the issues, mostly in amusing ways.

B00005JMJG|5.0|Just because I loved it doesn't mean I understood it.<br /><br />Jim Carrey plays Joel Barish, a nice guy, very shy, who finds it hard to get to know women. Kate Winslet plays Clementine Kruczynski, a free spirit who dyes her hair all sorts of unnatural colors as whim takes her. She works in Barnes & Noble so Joel knows where to find her. So imagine his surprise after a night of falling in love he goes to B&N to see her and finds that she's talking to a much younger man (Elijah Wood, who plays Patrick, a technician) and acts like she doesn't even know Joel.<br /><br />It turns out she has gone to a doctor who is able to selectively erase memories of any particular person from one's mind, and has had Joel erased. Joel is sufficiently insulted and distressed that he arranges for the procedure to have her erased. But things do not go quite according to plan.<br /><br />The various interlocking stories are told in flashbacks which are effectively the memories as they are being erased, in which both Joel and Clementine keep wanting to resist the erasure and remember one another. It's a very trippy, surrealistic movie, but it's wonderful.<br /><br />We all better hope Dr. Mierzwiak (Tom Wilkinson) never becomes real. Apparently we are all better off with our memories intact, even of the painful bits.
B000PDYVVG|5.0|Dear Elizabeth, I don't think that you'll ever read this but I want to thank you for this amazing book and for being so brave and share all your inner feelings so truthfully. I'm reading it now and each chapter has something I can relate to. It appears that I'm not the only one who feels this way, who's lost and confused and this makes me feel sooooo relieved - you can't imagine! Of course each and everyone one has different paths in our lives but I'm happy that someone else out there feels the same way I do. Thank for this wonderful book!
B003UGLCIA|4.0|Remember when you could not bear to eat green pea soup? And dolls were getting their heads turned around all over town? Such was the impact of this truly horrifying movie.<br /><br />But the demonic possession was not the worst part of the movie. For me, the worst was the torture the doctors put the poor kid through, knowing that this sort of thing actually does happen, while the extreme parts of the possession were clearly fiction.<br /><br />The DVD has an opening comment (you don't have to click on it, it just comes on spontaneously) by the director of the movie. He refers to \\"25 years ago,\\" so the comment itself is pretty old. He says that the reason he wanted to make a film of Peter Benchley's novel was that it was \\"based on\\" a true story. That's one of those terms of contact which is just one above \\"suggested by.\\" In order to believe it is realistically based upon a true story, one would have to believe that demonic possession is not psychosomatic, but literally real. That is, when supernatural things happen that are not being faked, the explanation is that there really is a devil doing it. I don't. So to me, it is entertaining fiction and no more.<br /><br />Having said that, it is entertaining. As I'm sure you know a very young, very pretty Linda Blair plays the possessed child and Ellen Burstyn plays her actress mother. They are both believable and lovable in their rolls before the demon takes over. Oddly enough, one thing that is never really explained is how the demon took possession of the child. She found a Ouija board in the basement of the house they rented in Georgetown while her mother was working on a movie there. This could function as the explanation, but no connection is really made.<br /><br />In one incident, the mother leaves the child in the care of her assistant, who in turn leaves the director of the movie on which the mother is working to look after the child while she runs out to get the child's prescription filled. When she returns, the director is at the bottom of the steep stairway leading from the house to the street, with his head turned completely around. This gets a cop (Lee J. Cobb) interested, and he wanders through the rest of the movie, apparently trying to solve that mystery and a couple of others that crop up later.<br /><br />So most of the story involves two phases: her mother's searching for a doctor to cure her really sick, sick daughter. They do all sorts of tests, find nothing organic, and suggest that it's a comparatively rare psychiatric disorder where a person behaves bizarrely because they believe they are possessed.<br /><br />The mother is not herself religious, but she goes to the local Catholic church and requests an exorcism, either because it my be a placebo cure or because it may actually be possesion: she doesn't frankly care which, so long as she gets her beautiful daughter back. When the young priest who is a psychiatrist for the Jesuits agrees to go see the child, she gives what the audience understands to be convincing proof of her possession, including the famous head turning all the way around. One interesting aspect is that he sprinkles the child with tap water from a holy water bottle, and the \\"demon\\" screams about how it burns.<br /><br />So he goes to the bishop and asks for permission to perform an exorcism. At this point we finally find out what all that rigamarole in the prologue about an archeologist priest in Iran was all about. It seems he has some experience with demons and demonic possession, and it is implied that the one possessing the child is the same one whose statue he uncovered in Iran.<br /><br />The exorcism is successful, the child is fine and remembers nothing of the possession, and she and her mother are returning to California, available for the sequel.director is at the bottom of the steep stairway leading from the house to the street, with his head turned completely around.

B003XF1XOQ|5.0|As I've said in previous reviews of the books in this series I had to buy this final book to find out what the outcome is - and now I know.  This series has been the kind of reading that I could not put down once started.  Mockingjay is more gruesome in many ways than The Hunger Games and definitely more that Catching Fire.  The final chapters bring unexpected twists and while, for me anyway,  a satisfying outcome it is bittersweet in how  things work out.  Definitely a good way to get tweens interested in reading and while I am far from a tween I thoroughly enjoyed the series and highly recommend it.
0790729377|4.0|This is another one that is so familiar, I've seen clips of it and stills, and had it described, and I think I even read the book. But oddly enough, I had never seen the movie before. Now I am amazed at how little I actually knew of the story.<br /><br />Blanche DuBois is played by Vivien Leigh, Stanley Kowalski is played by Marlon Brando, Stella Kowalski is played by Kim Hunter, and Mitch [didn't get his last name] is played by Karl Malden. Each one gives a superior performance in an intensely emotional movie.<br /><br />Blanche has \\"lost\\" the family home, and so comes to \\"visit\\" her sister Stella and her common, rather crude, enormously sensuous husband Stanley Kowalski. In fact, she has nowhere to go, and stays on for months. In the meantime, she flirts with the most promising of his poker buddies (they went through the war together, and now they work in a car parts place together), Mitch. Stanley and Stella are living in a grimy 2-room apartment in New Orleans, so having Blanche and her trunk full of delicate finery and her need for privacy, and her long soaks in the bathtub \\"to calm her down,\\" gets to be rather a nuisance. She's nearly got Mitch to propose marriage when Stanley hears some pretty nasty gossip about Blanche, tracks it down to confirm it, and then tells Mitch what he has heard.<br /><br />OK, that's plenty enough information for your imagination to run with it. Better still, let some fine acting run with it. Without saying any more, I must say that I would not have had half the patience with Blanche that Stella had.
B003O86FMW|5.0|After having reading The Hunger Games on vacation I could not wait to read the second book, Catching Fire, to find out how this story continues.  While I realize this series is most likely supposed to appeal to younger people than myself I find them riveting reading and can not stop until I know the outcome.  As with the first book however I had to purchase the third book to see what the ultimate outcome is.  Book two is a little less reality TV like in that it is not played out on national television for the whole country to watch.  I enjoyed the book and would recommend it to anyone who has read the first book in the trilogy.
B002HWRYJE|5.0|I'd give it six or seven stars if I could, but I suspect some of that is nostalgia. Still, this movie lives up to the hype, and these days you can't say more than that. But of course I will.<br /><br />We start with Jim Kirk's birth, only seconds before his father's death. It's a major piece of drama, and I wouldn't spoil it by telling you any more than that. But I will warn fans of the original Star Trek that we are in an alternate universe here, and not everything is consistent with what you remember. That's OK, though, because it is eventually explained. By Leonard Nemoy, of all people.<br /><br />Of course, every time the Enterprise goes into warp drive, they are traveling in time as much as in space; that's the only way to understand the warp drive. But this movie raises the ante on that poorly-understood fact, and makes the basic plot line depend upon it. It may make you dizzy, but you'll enjoy every minute of it.<br /><br />I like the young Kirk better than I did the mature one, and in some ways I like the young Spock better, too. Well, differently, anyway. We also get to know the young Uhuru, McCoy, Scotty, Checkov and Sulu. All look enough like their later counterparts to avoid confusion, and provide an interesting back-story for how they came to serve together. (But remember that pesky time paradox.)<br /><br />Now here's my guilty secret: I also like the Romulans. Oh, not like in the sense of wanting to be physically near any of them, but for finding them interesting characters. They have elaborate tattoos on their faces, apparently as individual recognition, and they are bald. They also wear long black leather coats and remind me strongly of the Matrix. And we even get insight into what's making them so mean and hateful.<br /><br />This is a movie for all the old fans, and all the new fans, too. And a great one for grandparents and grandchildren to bridge the gap. We know they laugh at the special effects of the original TV series; but we can enjoy the modern special effects and also the very human (or at least half-human) characters we have loved for so long.odern special effects and also the very human (or at least half-human) characters we have loved for so long.

0792833260|4.0|Dustin Hoffman is brilliant as the high-functioning autistic Raymond (Rain Man) Babbitt. Tom Cruise is typecast as his selfish, arrogant, bossy younger brother Charlie. Charlie never even knew he had a brother until their father died and left the bulk of his estate to Raymond. Or rather, to a trust for the care of Raymond, administered by his doctor at the hospital where he has spent most of his life.<br /><br />When Charlie learns that the father he had rejected had left him only his classic convertible car and the roses the father had loved and Charlie had hated, he went looking for the trustee of the $3 million trust fund and its beneficiary. The doctor didn't want to tell him, but he found out anyway that it was his older brother Raymond -- whom he had apparently called Rain Man as a little kid, and remembered as an imaginary companion rather than a real brother.<br /><br />The reasons why Raymond had been sent away, and never mentioned, as well as the estrangement between Charlie and his father, come out slowly, and I won't spoil it for you. But the upshot is that Charlie lures Raymond into the convertible with Charlie's girlfriend Susanna (played by an adorable Valeria Golino) and effectively kidnaps him. He calls the trustee doctor and demands half the trust fund to bring him back. When the doctor refuses, and Raymond freaks out at the prospect of flying to California with Charlie, they set off to drive there in the classic convertible.<br /><br />What happens along the way is both funny and sad, but the upshot is the brothers get to know one another. Raymond gets to have some experiences he would never have had at the hospital, but eventually Charlie recognizes what's best for Raymond and allows the doctor to take him home to the hospital.<br /><br />Dustin Hoffman does a brilliant job of portraying Raymond, which is a boon to those who have autism in their families, and would rather people had a positive image to promote compassion. That is, compassion for the autistic individual and for the family members who must find ways to cope with their needs.<br /><br />An excellent film.the autistic individual and for the family members who must find ways to cope with their needs.<br /><br />An excellent film.

If you've read anything else about entrepreneurship, don't.<br /><br />If you're absolutely new to the idea of entrepreneurship, then you definitely should read this book as a comprehensive primer on entrepreneurship. However, the first third or so of the book was horrible to slog through. I thought many times about putting the book down. I've been reading about entrepreneurship for years. Everything that Chris says in that first third has been said by Ramit Sethi, one of his friends. Ramit is a better writer and does a better job of actually motivating his readers. It says in the reviews by experts that this book gives you step by step instructions. If you want those instructions, go to 100startup.com. Chris has made those step by step instructions free. They aren't really step by step instructions. If you want a real road map that doesn't leave you hanging, go to Ramit Sethi. He will give you the very exact directions that you want.<br /><br />It was around the halfway mark that I actually started to get engaged in Chris's book. I honestly started to care way more about the entrepreneurs who were profiled and to see that it was possible to do. If you read I Will Teach You To Be Rich or are a fan of Ramit, I would not recommend getting this book. Get Find Your First Profitable Idea by Ramit instead. I bought this book on the strength of a recommendation by Penelope Trunk, one of my favorite bloggers. I don't think that I'll ever take her up on a book recommendation again because it was incredibly painful to push through the first portion of this book.<br /><br />I like Chris a lot, which is another reason why her recommendation worked. I've read his blog for a while and he's a really cool guy. It might be because I'm exacting and because I've worked for the past 2 or so years as an editor, but the quality of his writing in this book is awful. I'm a lot more lenient on blogs since I don't expect blogs to have the same kind of quality as books for which I pay. I don't doubt that he did extensive research, but this book is just not worth the money.<br /><br />EDIT: Seth Godin has now recommended this book.

I saw a few You Tube videos and I guess it took this long for me to realize that they had made full-length music videos. No; I knew that.

Anyway, now I got to soak myself in the angelic voices and saucy moves of Chloe Agnew Lisa Kelly, Neav Ni Mhaolchatha, Mairead Nesbitt and Orla Fallon as they each sing their own unique voice and blend them so completely artfully that I figure a lot of the credit goes to their arranger and musical producer. They have an orchestra, including a couple of superb percussionists, a chorus, magical lighting, and a multi-level stage that lets them choreograph their show to perfection.

He lives forever in the changes he brought about in his world.<br /><br />Jodie Foster plays Dr. Ellie Arroway, who is passionately pursuing SETI - the Search for Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence. As you probably know, lots of people consider it a huge waste of time, and lots more consider it a security risk. Then there are those who consider it blasphemy. All these viewpoints are represented in the film, along with the courage of scientific research and liberal theology. The latter is represented by Palmer Joss (Matthew McConaughey, quite delicious), religious philosopher and writer, and Ellie's lover and number one fan.<br /><br />Her number one financial backer is a mysterious billionaire named Dr. S.R.Haddon, a colorful figure to say the least, who made me think of Captain Nemo. He lives in an airplane, and seldom lands it. Her primary nemesis is Dr. David Drumlin, who first has her funding cut and then, when she finds unmistakably artificial signals, takes credit for the project and hogs the limelight.<br /><br />I'm not going to spoil too much in telling you that the signal includes detailed plans to build some sort of machine, nobody is quite sure what it's supposed to do. But a great deal is made of the fact that it seems like a vehicle of some sort, and only room for one person. Who will represent the entire human race to some completely unknown aliens? The government sets up a commission to make the decision, and Palmer Joss, as a close friend of President Clinton's (who appears in the movie, presumably with carefully edited stock footage), is included in the commission. Does he pick Ellie to go, knowing she may well not survive, or not be able to come back, or come back something over 50 years later, not having aged appreciably while he becomes an old man? She wants to go so very much, but then so do quite a few other qualified scientists, and also Dr. David Drumlin, Mr. Limelight Hog.<br /><br />The reasons for the commission's decision may depress the heck out of you; they did me. The stunning act of sabotage that threatens the whole mission is also depressingly realistic. In fact, good parts and bad, this movie is disturbingly realistic.

B000VNMMQG|5.0|I was a little worried that this would be heavy on the religious aspect, but it's not. It's about humanism, really. It's about human decency. Young William Wilberforce (Ioan Gruffudd) was a student of John Newton (played by Albert Finney), who wrote \\"Amazing Grace\\" after having been a slave ship captain, and estimated that he had the ghosts of 20,000 slaves to keep him company. Wilberforce was also close friends with William Pitt (Benedict Cumberbatch) long before he became prime minister.<br /><br />This is basically the story of the fight to abolish the slave trade in Great Britain, but the relationship to the American trade is tied into it. Wilberforce just kept pounding away at the Parliament until they gave in, but of course the story is far more complicated than that. He used a variety of tactics to bring home the issue of the cruelty of slavery, including inviting a group of MPs and their wives to an outing on board a boat in the harbor which stopped beside a slave ship where they could smell the stench of blood, sickness and death.<br /><br />Barbara Spooner (Romola Garai) was a beautiful abolitionist whom Mr. and Mrs. Pitt tried to set up with Wilberforce, which of course made them both a bit put off. However, years later they did marry. (Oh, dear, am I giving too much away here?)<br /><br />Two faces in this movie, and especially the two voices, may seem very familiar, although I had to look them up on Wikipedia to be sure I was right. The Duke of Clarence, who favors the slave trade because he makes money from it, is played by Toby Jones, who did such a brilliant job of playing Truman Capote in \\"Infamous.\\" Lord Charles Fox, who comes over to the abolitionist side, is played by Michael Gambon, who also plays Albus Dumbledore. And just for fun, Toby Jones also does the voice of Dobby the House Elf.<br /><br />This is a beautiful movie of courage and persistence, and an important part of our history.

B00003CXXP|5.0|Steven Spielberg is one of the real geniuses of our time. This movie is a prime example.<br /><br />David (Haley Joel Osment) is a mecha (people like us are Orgas) who is a new prototype, designed to love. Unconditional love. The factory that made him searched through their employees for the right couple to adopt him: in this case, one whose son had been put in suspended animation because he was very sick. His mother continued to come to the lab and read stories to him (with a microphone on the capsule in which he was frozen), even though he'd been like that for some four years. She was put off by David at first, but eventually warmed up to him.<br /><br />Then their orga son was revived and came home. He was, not unsurprisingly, somewhat jealous of his new mecha brother. Things eventually got so bad that his mother took him and his super-pet, Teddy, out into the woods and abandoned him, not unlike what some people do with unwanted pets. She was told that if she ever took him back to the factory, they would disassemble him, so I guess she thought she was being comparatively kind.<br /><br />David and Teddy have a great many fascinating adventures out in the world, including meeting up with Gigolo Joe, a mecha lover who was framed for a murder and is on the run. David's mother had read the story of Pinocchio to David and his rather malicious brother, and so he has decided he must go find the Blue Fairy and ask her to turn him into a real boy so that his mother will love him again. Gigolo Joe is helping him, and takes him to see Dr. Know, an animated talking head that can't help reminding you of the Wizard of Oz. As a bonus, his voice is that of Robin Williams.<br /><br />The plot has many, many twists and turns, and I've probably already told you too much. Little Haley is marvelous in the role, and Jude Law makes an essentially perfect Gigolo Joe. The credits say Meryl Streep is in there somewhere, but if I tell you where, I'll ruin the story for you. She's a voice, not recognizable by face.<br /><br />This is not one of those frantic paced science fiction stories that normal adults cannot follow, although there are some heart-pounding chase scenes. Remember that both David and Gigolo Joe are essentially running from the authorities. And the Flesh Fair has enough flash and dash for anyone, not to mention horror for those of us who have come to accept the mechas as people in some sense. It's essentially a carnival for orga bigots.<br /><br />I think you're going to love this film, no matter who you are.not recognizable by face.<br /><br />This is not one of those frantic paced science fiction stories that normal adults cannot follow, although there are some heart-pounding chase scenes.

B000ZECQ08|5.0|Once I get over all the things left out between the book and the movie (always a wrench), I can enjoy this movie a great deal. It's darker, although perhaps not darker than the Order of the Phoenix. It's also more involved with the personal lives of our main characters. Oddly, though, the kids have grown up so much that I can't be sure which ones are or are not being played by different actors. Not the main characters, certainly: but is Lavender Brown the same? Neville and Luna may or may not be: they are seen so briefly.<br /><br />Anyway, the basic story is that the Death Eaters are causing a lot of trouble, even in the muggle world, and Dumbledore seems to have a plan to fight back, although the nature of the fight takes some time to develop. Even for him.<br /><br />He has asked Horace Slughorn to come out of retirement and be the Potions master, while Severus Snape finally gets the position he has wanted all along: Defense Against the Dark Arts. Why? It turns out Tom Riddle was a favorite of Slughorn's when he was at Hogwarts, and Dumbledore is convinced he has vital information about Riddle. You see, Slughorn is a sort of name-dropping groupie of famous witches and wizards and their children. As Dumbledore puts it, he likes to \\"collect\\" names for his Slug Club. Of course he wants to collect Harry, and Dumbledore asks Harry to get close to him in the hopes of getting the necessary information. Dumbledore has a bottled memory of Slughorn talking to Tom Riddle, but it has been altered. (You know about the bottled memories; they are put into the pensieve in order to be experienced.) It is Harry's mission to get the truth from Slughorn.<br /><br />Harry succeeds. It turns out Slughorn told Riddle about horcruxes, very dark magic that allows a magician to divide part of his soul and hide it in an object. So if he is killed, it's just that body that dies; he can still recover the hidden part of his soul from the horcrux. Making just one is bad enough, but apparently Voldemort made seven of them. Potter destroyed one, Riddle's diary, in the Chamber of Secrets. Dumbledore found and destroyed a ring which had been in the family of Riddle's mother for some time, and it blackened his hand in the process.<br /><br />Now he believes he knows where another is hidden: in a cave by the ocean where he takes Harry with him, first extracting a promise from Harry that he will do as Dumbledore asks, no matter what. Harry promises, but it turns out to be pretty horrible to live up to. And even more horrible is what they confront when they return to Hogwarts.<br /><br />I've told you too much already, especially if you haven't read the books. But believe me, there's a great deal more. For example, just what is Draco Malfoy up to?Voldemort made seven of them. Potter destroyed one, Riddle's diary, in the Chamber of Secrets.

B007PS0X0W|2.0|It seems that all the Underworld Movies are leading up to another sequel. Kate Beckingsale is undefeatable as always even against a giant silver immune Lycan. Yawn! The plot was predictable. At the end of the day, it was back to Vampires against Lycans and both of them against hybrids. It was okay for action with the usual gore in every other shot. Same old cliches...oh well, that is what is expected from the 4th installment of any series.
B0000844I8|4.0|Another one of those I heard about for many years but finally got around to seeing just today. I will attempt to make something resembling sense out of this amazing plot line.<br /><br />In ancient times, something was buried in the sands of Egypt. In the 1920s, an archeologist (with his little daughter along for the adventure) uncovered a huge ring of metal unlike anything else known to man. So in the 1990s, Dr. Daniel Jackson (played by a very cute James Spader), was offered a super-secret job inside a decomissioned missile silo in the Colorado mountains. Actually inside the mountains, apparently. This huge ring has been set up there, and the project to figure out what it is and what it is used for is being headed up by the now elderly daughter of the archeologist that found it all those years ago.<br /><br />Actually, Dr. Jackson is needed as one of the rare few who might be able to decipher the symbols on the ring which are not Egyptian hieroglyphics. There are hieroglyphics on the stone which had covered the ring, and I think on the outer edge of the ring, but the ones on the ring itself are alien. Literally, as it turns out. Jackson is able to translate the hieroglyphics and recognize that what the thing is really is a star gate: a portal into somewhere else altogether.<br /><br />A robot probe is sent through and reports back that the conditions on the other side are fit for humans. A group of soldiers and Dr. Jackson are thus detailed to go through and find out what lies on the other side.<br /><br />What they find, predictably, is a civilization which resembles ancient Egypt in many ways, ruled by an alien who uses human bodies, the most recent one of which greatly resembles my former room-mate who is also a Multiply user. (But her voice was a great deal nicer and her temper was a little less caustic.) I'm pretty sure she has seen this movie and I wonder if she agrees about the resemblance.<br /><br />Anyway, there are many hazards to the soldiers being able to return to the earth, including problems on both sides. To detail them would ruin the story for you. But let me ask you this: what would you get if you crossed a camel with a bison?<br /><br />It's good fun, a rousing adventure, and I recommend it. The only reason it's 4 stars instead of 5 is that I kept looking for something rather more profound in the way of denouement.

B000WZAE1I|5.0|Magic, all sorts of magic, black and white and all the colors in between.<br /><br />There is a town in England called Wall, which is near the opening in a wall between the muggle world and the magical world. There's an ancient guard at the opening, but a young man is able to trick the guard away and run through. He explores the fascinating magical world beyond the wall, finds a lovely young lady chained to a yellow gypsy caravan, and makes love to her.<br /><br />Nine months later a basket with a baby is left for him at the gap in the wall. The baby's name is Tristan, and 18 years later, he's as curious as his father ever was about that gap in the wall. One evening, after getting his beloved Victoria drunk on champagne, they see a falling star, and it fell not far beyond the wall. Tristan has just been telling Victoria how he would do anything for her hand in marriage, and now he agrees to go fetch that fallen star for her. She warns him if he is not back in one week, she will marry the crude fop who has gone to Ipswich to buy her a great big diamond ring.<br /><br />So he goes to the gap in the wall and tricks his way across in much the same way his father had 18 years earlier. He finds the crater where the star had fallen, but it turns out the star is a beautiful maiden. Problem is, there are other people looking for her. Among them one of three witch sisters who want to cut out her still warm heart and eat it in order to renew their youth.<br /><br />Meanwhile, the king of this magical realm is on his death bed, and calls his remaining four of seven sons to his bedside. Apparently the traditional way of succession in this world is for all the brothers to try to kill each other off, and the last surviving heir is the new king.<br /><br />The king has a magical jewel around his neck, a huge ruby on a golden chain. He tells the remaining three sons (yes, three now) that whichever one restores the magical jewel will be king of the realm. Then he throws it out the window and it flies up into the sky, which turns out to be what knocked the star out of the sky. But it has gone clear white. So restoring it means not just capturing it, but turning it red again.<br /><br />There's magic, there's humor (as when the questing witch turns two goats into humans, more or less, and \\"Billy the Innkeeper\\" retains quite a bit of goatishness) and there's romance. If you don't see the potential for romance, you've not been paying attention. Did I say that Tristan is very good-looking, bold and brave, very chivalrous and tender? I'm sure I mentioned that the star is beautiful.<br /><br />The plot is carefully woven, the different characters developed interestingly, the costumes and settings well done, the action just sort of too frantic to follow.

B001AGXEAG|4.0|Well, we already knew Tim Burton has a delightfully warped sense of humor, didn't we? So it came as no surprise to me that this movie was both warped and hilariously funny.<br /><br />Adam and Barbara Maitland (Alec Baldwin and Geena Davis) are a charming young couple that live in a large old house on the edge of a small town. They love each other very much, very playful and fun together, and have just settled in for three weeks of vacation to work on their hobby: a scale model of the entire town. It's really good, too. Also, apparently they renovated the old house themselves.<br /><br />One day they went into town to get some supplies for the model and on the way home, went through a covered bridge. That is, through the side of the covered bridge into the river. They found themselves back at home, but eventually realized that they had died and were now haunting the place. That would be OK, except that their neighbor, a real estate agent, promptly sold the place to the Deetz, a severely dysfunctional family from the city. In no time at all, the wife has thrown out all the comfortable old things Adam and Barbara had, and put in horrible modern junk based on the dreadful tastes of her friend, an interior decorator. Also on her own sculptures, which are arguably the ugliest things you have ever seen produced by anyone over the age of five.<br /><br />The only redeeming aspect of the Deetz family is their teenage daughter Lydia (Winona Ryder). She dresses in black, is very morbid, but also is the only one able to see Adam and Barbara. And she is in sympathy with their assessment of her step-mother's horrible taste. Also horrible attitude.<br /><br />They don't quite know what to do, but when they returned to the house after the accident (actually, I think it was after the funeral), they found a book titled \\"Guidebook for the Recently Deceased.\\" They tried to read it, but there was no index, and it didn't seem to make a lot of sense to them. They did manage to draw a door through to a bureaucratic nightmare where they were told to talk to their caseworker. Turns out their caseworker is an abrupt, shriveled old woman who smokes constantly and the smoke seeps out through a large slash in her neck. She warns them not to contact Beetlejuice, who used to be her assistant but \\"went out on his own.\\" He had left an advertisement in their handbook, and for good measure, managed to put one on their TV.<br /><br />Still, when Lydia reads their handbook and does all she can to help them, they still haven't gotten rid of the Deetz family. In desperation, they call on Beetlejuice (Michael Keaton). You have to say his name three times to call him, which suggestions that he is a demon. Actually, I think the suggestion is also made that he's an alien. It's hard to be sure.<br /><br />The funniest parts of the movie are Beetlejuice's attempts to frighten the Deetz away: or at least the parents. He likes Lydia, and in fact wants her to marry him.<br /><br />There are lots and lots of inside-joke type references throughout, especially in the underworld bureaucracy.

1594203334|5.0|I picked up this book knowing that it would be controversial. I also knew it was written by a journalist and mother and was closer to a memoir than a scientific tome with lots of resource material.  I'm also someone who already agrees with a lot of the philosophies she shares in this book.  And contrary to some of the negative comments, I don't see how her sex life has ANYTHING to do with her parenting. We also haven't given birth yet so I can't compare to my own experiences. I just want to be clear of where I'm coming from before I share my review.<br /><br />I read this book on a flight for vacation and talked about it so much that I had my partner read it on the way home.  We both really enjoyed not only the information in the book but how it was written.  As a journalist she strikes a delicate balance between research and anecdotes and the result is a smooth book that flows well and has you both laughing and thinking. She provided us with some useful information and some excellent places to start for future references. We both feel like even though some of what she shares is common sense, we have a bit more confidence and backup than we did before.
B000GWE44U|5.0|It really is. I had nightmares about this movie because he's so thrilling and frightening. There aren't any werewolves, witches, ghosts, or phantasms, but it has to be one of the scariest, suspenseful movies I've ever seen so far.

B000I9X7R6|5.0|He's absolutely intelligent in this film, Hopkins still is the best man in any bad situation. Theoretical knowledge is the only thing that billionaire Charles Morse has to go on about living in the wild, and when he is stranded in the woods with a fashion photographer, Bob, who has had hunting experience, it's a great show to see Anthony Hopkins remain calm and intellectual while Alec Baldwin constantly cuts his throat (figuratively speaking) and freaks out. Hopkins shows in this film that if you are smart and you think, you can pretty much work your way out of any situation; that, and if you look where you're going.

I knew the the mic was not going to be great, but I would like a mic where I don't have to yell into to be heard. With Audio Hijack Pro I managed to get it to a slightly more audible level. All in all, I recommend you spend the money on just a plain set of headphones and a separate mic.<br /><br />Pros<br />+Good design<br />+ Convenient retractable mic (Unfortunately audio is horrible)<br />+OK sound quality<br /><br />Cons<br />-Microphone volume level is too low<br />-Squeezes ears slightly

B0070UFMOW|5.0|I use the same set of headphones across two computers:<br /><br />One computer has some RF leakage from the video card and CPU. The interference makes audible ticks and whirs over the headphones when the system is under load. (You can hear the screen refreshing.) This is probably due to the pin-outs for the jacks being too close to the PCI bus. The second computer is too quiet when playing back over the headphones. The headphones in question are 40mm drivers with 63 ohms resistance and max out at 1W. They sound quite good without a headphone amp, so long as the source has the power to drive them, and there is no interference (which I guess is obvious).<br /><br />The E17 clears up both issues. The external SPDIF DAC (the USB device reports itself as a USB SPDIF device) clears up any problems with computer internals leaking RF and other electrical noise, because the signal stays digital until it is outside of your computer. The amplifier does a good job, and has more than enough power for the headphones I'm using, so it solves the problem on the quiet computer as well.<br /><br />Apart from loudness and reduction of interference, the quality of the audio is also quite good. Mine was defaulted to 6db Gain, and the resulting sound is quite punchy, not in a painful or grating way. The instrumentation on more complex recordings is quite well separated compared to the run of the mill laptop DACs I have to test it against (Dell using Intel and Samsung using Realtek).<br /><br />Additionally, now I get to carry my \\"levels\\" around with me, and have the same audio settings at every terminal, which is a nice convenience. Having the device powered by the same line that provides the digital audio signal is also useful (I primarily use the USB interface).<br /><br />Conclusion: functional and convenient, with audible improvement in my use case (depends on the users headphones and source material). The build quality feels and appears solid, in deference to reports about Fiio's previous products.

0553801473|1.0|I do not understand how writer, editor, etc., could think that this 960 pages of wondering drivel can be of interest to a reader. There is no story just a continuing soap opera. Myriads of characters, tomes of wondering story line, no ending in sight, etc. The ability of the author to write is not at issue here. It is rather the problem. All of his books are too long and worse, as stated above have no enidng, no real diretion. It feels as if he is writing the story line as he goes by chapter. Maybe he will write a concluding novel in leass than a 1000 pages and have a true ending???

There also has to be more to a book than lots of sex.  fortunately, there is a sotry underneath all of this.  The bottom line here is that if you'd like to read a raunchy book,THIS is it.

So in turn, Dr. Erkstine (Stanley Tucci) with industry captain Howard Stark (Dominic Cooper) conducts an experiment on him that turns Rogers into an enhanced and more tougher version of himself including enhanced fighting skills and improved Stamina as he wields a shield made out of a rare metal as he becomes Captain America who is the first Avenger ever. Nazi leader Jonahn Schmidt aka Red-Skull (Hugo Weaving) is the head of a Nazi organization called HYDRA where he wants absolute power from an ancient magic cube that thinks might make him more powerful than ever as Captain America wages war on Hydra.<br /><br />Co-starring Samuel L Jackson, Tommy Lee Jones and Haley Atwell, this movie is a prequel to the Avengers saga and Rocketeer director Joe Johnson has done a great job of making this well acted and well produced comic based saga to life. An improvement over the 1990 monstrosity, Evans was fantastic and Hugo was born to play RedSkull. The film is an action packed extravaganza that is quite true to the original Marvel comics of the 40s and 60s, i like how they used amazing digital make-up in the Benjamin Button tradition on Evan's character to make him a weakling which looked almost real and how Hugo's make-up was. This movie is basically a prequel to The Avengers films which started with Iron Man in 2008 as if you can link this with Iron Man afterwards then Incredible Hulk then Iron man 2 and finally Thor to know the whole story then you get \\"Avengers\\". The film has that Indiana Jones feel of adventure in a timeless period and that's what is so cool about this movie plus there are 2 endings like one after the credits then finally a teaser to Avengers.<br /><br />This DVD/Blu-Ray combo contains quality picture and theater style sound with cool extras like audio commentary, deleted scenes, trailers, featurettes and a funny short film that takes place during \\"Thor\\".xtras like audio commentary, deleted scenes, trailers, featurettes and a funny short film that takes place during \\"Thor\\".

The characters in this book were immature, bi-polar, and creepy. How can you fall in love with someone you KNOW is crazy and has jealousy issues? The ending...really? Lame. I couldn't even finish the book. It boggles my mind that people are loving this book! I do not understand why the author is re-writing this book from Travis' POV. You can not rationalize his behavior in any way. Ugh
B000Z27HLS|3.0|Of course this movie is awesome and well-done.  I have it on VHS and wanted the DVD version so I could turn on the subtitles, but, even though they say they have them, subtitles are missing.  Grrrrrr.  I'm thinking these might be bootleg copies.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|I thought this book was excellent. I think the slow build up was so necessary to bring it all together in the end. Such a different view of a legal thriller from the family point of view. I read 1-3 books a week which many are in the legal/crime point of view. Some are so predictable even if they are good. This is not that kind of book. Worth your time and money 100%
B003XF1XOQ|2.0|Parts of this book was way too long.  Predictable but still a decent read.  For most readers, I suppose it doesn't really matter what the reviews say, anyone who has started Hunger Games will read all three books.

B004VMUS9G|5.0|This, I think by far... is the best alarm clock app. You can TOTALLY make it your own digital alarm clock, from ringtones, button fixes, sound and display, and even if you're on a schedule for work, you can change the settings to repeat, where as in my case with my other (crappy) alarm clock, I have to keep hitting the on/off switch every night before bed. And I'll tell you this-- My good ol' (crappy) alarm clock is, and I mean it-- LOUD!!! BEEP BEEP BEEP BEEP BEEP BEEP BEEP BEEP every morning. It nearly scares the living poop out of me!! ...Until I smack that big plastic SNOOZE button with a groan... then I feel totally satisfied.<br /><br />  But, with this app, you don't have to worry about your old, dreadful alarm clock... Thank goodness for new technology!! With just a touch of a few buttons, you can snooze away for a couple of minutes after completing a math problem to wake up that drowsy brain, allowing you to get up feeling smart. (In my case) And, which I love the most, is that you can set your alarm clock for a credenza ( I cant remember what it was, okay?) ...So it doesn't come on in BLASTING LOUD.<br /><br />Well... I think my enthusiasm explained a lot, and I would like to honor the company Angle Labs for creating a wonderful app.<br />Truly, I mean it.<br /><br />Thank you<br /><br />Sincerely,<br /><br />An Amazon Kindle Fire User

0307716546|4.0|I really enjoyed Rosamund Lupton's debut novel Sister, so I was happy to get my hands on a copy of her newest book. Afterwards covers similar ground to Sister; it's a mystery, but it's also a story of family love. Grace Covey rushes into a burning building to rescue her 17-year-old daughter Jenny. They are both grievously injured and unconscious in the hospital. But both mother and daughter are somehow able to leave their injured bodies, and their spirits wander through the hospital, watching over their family and friends. They soon learn that the fire was set deliberately. It becomes clear that Jenny being trapped in the fire was no accident, and mother and daughter work to put the pieces of the puzzle together.<br /><br />I found the premise a little hard to swallow at first, but I quickly became caught up in the mystery, and any implausibility ceased to bother me. The mystery is a gripping one. Grace and Jenny can hear everyone around them, but they can't communicate with anyone, leaving them on the outskirts of the investigation, longing to be able to share what information they have.<br /><br />Afterwards is a much a story of family love as it is a mystery. Grace is desperate to protect Jenny and her son Adam, who is utterly devastated in the aftermath of the fire. We see the story in the present and in multiple flashbacks as Grace tries to make sense of little things that happened in the past that may have some bearing on the present. She knows she's in a race against time to save both of her children. Afterwards succeeds as both an intriguing mystery and a testament to a mother's love for her children.
B00005JMEW|5.0|It doesn't get more revengy than the roaring revenge flick KILL BILL Vol. 1. This is Quentin Tarantino gleefully indulging himself, and maybe there's a box of Kleenex within reach. KILL BILL Vol. 1 is a masterful stroke, a sort of a grimy, funny, inventive masterpiece. Tarantino lifts from the best elements of the 1970s grindhouse cinema, shapes KILL BILL into a distillation of childhood memories and base impressions culled from our watching countless 1970s Hong Kong flicks, samurai dramas, spaghetti westerns, and urban exploitation thrillers.<br /><br />So much is deliriously familiar here, echoes of my kidhood bouncing around inside my skull, from the opening trumpety blare heralding the Shaw Brothers logo to the wickedly inspired soundtrack to the Bride's yellow track suit to gushing arteries and cameos by martial arts icons Sonny Chiba and Gordon Liu. Pardon the alliteration, but the boldness and the bombast and the babe-on-babe bashing... and the brevity of the dialogue. Tarantino curbs his jonesing for rambling talkfests to demonstrate that he, too, could shoot a pure action picture. The dialogue, what there is of it, is gloriously stilted, quite appropriate to this epic, exaggerated vengeance yarn.<br /><br />Before Kobe Bryant hijacked it, Uma Thurman's character wore the \\"Black Mamba\\" moniker. But we refer to her as \\"The Bride.\\" Four years after being with child and bloody bludgeoned and taking a bullet to the skull at her own wedding, the Bride erupts from her coma, thirsting for vengeance. We learn eventually that she once was a member of an international hit team called the Deadly Viper Assassination Squad. And yet I was more impressed that it takes her a mere thirteen hours to overcome four years of muscular atrophy. She then makes a list composed of names of her betrayers, all associated with that same assassination squad. And even though \\"O-Ren-Ishii\\" is first on that list, the film opens with the Bride confronting \\"Vernita Green,\\" second on the list. Tarantino never did care for straight-up sequential storytelling.<br /><br />Perhaps I should place a mild SPOILERS alert here, even though this sucker's, what, eight years old? There may still be oblivious folks out there who haven't yet run across KILL BILL or moving pictures or the wheel.<br /><br />This is the kind of film that tends to trivialize its menfolk. Even though we get to see old hands like Sonny Chiba and Gordon Liu, they are more or less marginalized. Instead, Uma Thurman, Lucy Liu, and Vivica A. Fox are showcased. As the deadly bladeswoman \\"Vernita Green,\\" who was once codenamed \\"Copperhead,\\" Fox brings a rough-and-tumble aggression to the screen. The Black Mamba and Copperhead engage in brutal, no-frills combat, made all the more gruesome and stunning in that it takes place in a suburban dream home. In the intervening four years, Copperhead had repented and changed her ways; she'd settled down with a loving family. The Bride doesn't give an ef. She crosses her name out.<br /><br />This seems a fine place to give a shout out to Tarantino and RZA (of the Wutang Clan)'s collaboration. You can't say enough about their marrying of imagery and soundtrack. It results in many spectacular moments.<br /><br />I'll say this about Sonny Chiba. Over the years he's only cemented that strong, steely presence. Verisimilitude is brought to bear, and there's a neat kick in that Chiba sort of reprises the roles he'd played in the Japanese TV series SHADOW WARRIORS. The Bride journeys to Okinawa, Japan to beg a sword from retired legendary swordsmaker Hattori Hanzo. It's one leg in the hero's journey. More importantly, it's Tarantino's fond curtain call for Sonny Chiba who has aged with grace.<br /><br />Another exhibition of verve and style - and, perhaps, to stave off censorship - is Tarantino's decision to reveal O-Ren-Ishii's origin in splashy, blood-soaked anime format. Else, the disturbing elements in that origin may have been, well, too disturbing. This sequence sets up Lucy Liu's character as one damaged but badarse villainess, never mind that she's a contemptible hybrid of Japanese-Chinese ancestry and so shouldn't even have had a whiff of taking over the Tokyo underworld. This is Lucy Liu garnering her best role ever. She makes O-Ren-Ishii a.k.a. \\"Cottonmouth\\" into a formidable adversary for the Bride. Doesn't hurt that she's got her homicidal and batsh-- crazy 17-year-old bodyguard, Go Go Yubari (the sensational Chiaki Kuriyama), and her numerous Yakuza henchmen, the sword-wielding Crazy 88, to back her play.<br /><br />Tarantino breaks down the film in titled chapters, of which the wild \\"Showdown at House of Blue Leaves\\" is perhaps the most unforgettable in a narrative braced with unforgettable moments and images. \\"Silly Caucasian girl likes to play with samurai swords.\\" And still O-Ren-Ishii mocks the Bride, even though the Bride, in full on Black Mamba mode, had just dispatched her Crazy 88 crew (including its general, Gordon Liu), as well as that deadly high-schooler with the chain and mace. There's a certain grace and elegance in the Bride and O-Ren-Ishii's duel, their tensed-up figures stark against the soft snow banks outside the House of Blue Leaves. And, afterwards, once the Bride has lopped off the most relevant bits of Cottonmouth's skull, she can't help but assume a place in the pantheon of kickasss women. And this, with her mission only two-fifths done.<br /><br />The DVD's bonus stuff:<br /><br />- \\"The Making of KILL BILL Vol. 1\\" - an interesting behind-the-scenes look which includes segments concerning Tarantino's collaboration with RZA and how Tarantino first learned of the Japanese girl band The 5,6,7,8's (00:22:04 minutes)<br />- Bonus Musical Performances by The 5,6,7,8's: \\"I Walk Like Jayne Mansfield\\" & \\"I'm Blue\\" (00:05:51 minutes)<br />- Quentin Tarantino Movie Trailersce sets up Lucy Liu's character as one damaged but badarse villainess, never mind that she's a contemptible hybrid of Japanese-Chinese ancestry and so shouldn't even have had a whiff of taking over the Tokyo underworld.

1416562605|1.0|At one point Mr. wanna be great novelist writes about a village in Bihar and says sarcastically that Buddha would have run away from it, because it is so filthy. I thought that was the most stupid comment I have ever heard. After all things change, what was once great becomes mundane and filthy in another age, so we do not know what Bihar was like in the Age of Ashoka, Patilaputra and Mahatma Buddha. For Adiga to write like that shows his contempt for North Indians and an inherent inferiority complex that all haters usually possess.    Problem with Adiga is that he thinks that just because the south has sucked up to the white dick and earned some dollars by being good indentured servants, it is great and we have to take our hats off every time we land in places like Madras and Bangalore.    The whole novel is filled with contradictions. China and Afghanistan are great because they were not ruled by foreign powers, but think about it ? If North India is in dark ages, Afghanistan must be in an even darker age. So how can it be great and in dark ages at the same times. Basically Mr. Adiga is full of s***.

B007J4T2G8|5.0|I was curious and a bit surprised that a book, supposedly about BDSM, would top the best sellers lists. My decision to purchase the first book was actually made after reading the one star reviews. So many complaints about not enough sex or not enough descriptive sex made me feel a bit safer in choosing to purchase the book. I started by purchasing only Book One, prepared to be revolted by the explicit sex scenes. But that was not the case. In fact, I think I was 50% through the first book, wondering where all the sex was!<br /><br />In fact, many of the things the one star reviewers found annoying, were my favorite parts of the book. Okay, maybe you have to suspend your disbelief a bit to buy that a 21 year old virgin, who hasn't even masturbated, would give herself so readily to a man on their first \\"date\\". But, by all accounts, Christian Grey had that effect on all women.<br /><br />Some reviewers complained about the lack of explicit language and of Ana's reference to \\"down there\\". I much prefer that innocent description to full-blown anatomically correct language, which, to be honest, I find vulgar, rather than stimulating. And, if we are to believe in Ana's innocence, the terms she used were exactly right...for her.<br /><br />Reviewers also criticized the repetitive use of Ana blushing and Christian tipping his head at an angle and smirking. I liked the repetition. It drove home the point of how the two reacted to their developing relationship. There were also numerous upon numerous repetitions of Ana thinking \\"oh my\\" and \\"oh\\" and \\"holy hell\\" and other such exclamations. I found those repetitions exactly right as Ana begins to realize that while she teases and is amused by Christian's need for control, that to him, it is a deadly serious \\"game\\".<br /><br />Another reviewer hated that the relationship played itself out in emails. My absolute favorite part of the book. I found them to be laugh-out-loud funny, as Ana responds in a flippant way, and then realizesthat Christian is not joking. It may be tempting to skim through the email messages in the books. Don't. And pay attention to how their job titles change to reflect their conversations as well as the subject lines.<br /><br />I agree with other reviewers that you could easily flip through the sex scenes and the book would still hold together nicely. So why bother with the sex? If we are to understand the struggle that both Christian and Ana go through to find a way to be together given their vastly different sexual (and life) experiences, we have to know Christian's \\"dark\\" side. If we are to buy into his suffering, his torment, and the difficulties they face in order to build a relationship together, we have to know the details. As such, I didn't think that the sex scenes necessarily needed to be titillating, but rather, informative. But, in some instances, they were both. If they were missing, the struggle would not have been demonstrated so forcefully.<br /><br />I read the three books in four days and, while there is a wrap to the story, would still have loved more.<br /><br />Not to give too much away, but another favorite part for me in the trilogy, was the last couple of chapters. Up to that point, we have been told the story from Ana's point of view. The last couple of chapters let us hear from Christian. If there is to be a follow up to this trilogy, I would love to see the author pursue this side of the story. How I would love to hear Christian's view of their breakup at the end of the first book. <Sigh><br /><br />If I had one complaint, it would be the timelines. The speed at which the entire trilogy takes place. Sex on the first date. Moving in together....I won't say any more so as not to spoil the story for others.<br /><br />So, if you are looking for hard-core BDSM, keep looking. This is not the book for you. If you are looking for a squeaky-clean love story, this isn't for you either. But, if you are looking for a romance, with a bit of mystery anddrama thrown in, and can live with some sexual content that might not be quite mainstream, then you will enjoy these books.
0307719219|5.0|If you write a book on World Economics, it says a lot if five of the blurbs are from winners of the Nobel Prize for Economics.<br /><br />It also helps if you don't publish your theory in a learned journal, complete with plenty of math.<br /><br />And if you produce your theory in an easy-to-read book that makes your point over and over again, you have a winner - maybe even your own Nobel Prize.<br /><br />And here is that winner. I know I've been somewhat gushing about books lately, but this is the best one so far - this year, this decade, this century. So what's it about?<br /><br />Authors Acemoglu and Robinson have taken on the vexing question of why some nations are prosperous and others not. They point out that there are many similar societies around the world, and that development should be similar in each of them. But the early examples - North and South Korea, and Mexican Nogales and U.S. Nogales - show that there is a vast divide between apparently similar peoples. They attribute this to certain man-made institutions in each country. What has made these differences hard to see has been the focus on politics. Is Capitalism better than Communism? Do revolutions and coups make everything right? These aren't the questions to ask.<br /><br />The authors have made an intense study of many nations around the world, and they can show that the success or failure can be traced to the author's theory. They find that most countries are either extractive or inclusive societies. Extractive societies try to concentrate the wealth among the powerful, and even communist leaders can live the good life while their citizens starve. Inclusive societies try to engage as many groups as possible to share power, without creating an elite.<br /><br />People in the U.S. live in a society that is mainly inclusive. Most Americans would agree that if you study hard and work hard you can get on in life. The state can't come around and take away what you have. You can start a business and make billions from it, if you are lucky. You can innovate and get a return for your processes and inventions. That isn't the case for everyone here, but it's what drives the country.<br /><br />Or take an extractive society. Few people have access to education. Communist states suppress demand, and supposed \\"democracies\\" often preside over massive inflation. You may not be able to open a business. In agricultural nations there's often a state organization that is supposed to get higher prices for exports of the commodity, yet farmers find that the going rate is going down and down, and is less than what's available in a free market. So why look for better ways of producing your crops? It's simply not worth it.<br /><br />People have complained that there is too much emphasis on England in the seventeenth century. That's purely sour grapes because I come from there (no, not really!). It's because England gradually moved from an extractive society to an inclusive one. In 1688, a hundred years after the Armada, King Charles II was deposed. But the important news was that England took steps to remove control from the King and his nobles. Over the next two hundred years, the Parliament became supreme, and this was done to make the democracy wider-spread, and not to succumb to the interests of the rich. So when the Industrial Revolution started, the steam engine wasn't a curiosity, like it was to the Greeks in the first century A.D., where there was enough free energy from slaves. Also in Britain, the aristocracy didn't fear the loss of power or money as much as in feudal countries.<br /><br />I'm sure Karl Marx thought that Communism would solve the world's problems, but although the Soviet Union rose to be an industrial power, the strong control of the state led people to fix targets that were easily reached, and there was little incentive for innovation. So even with the supposed equality of everyone, the country couldn't maintain growth. So it's sad that the authorsreview Uzbekistan, an ex-satellite country of the Soviet Union, and show that the \\"free\\" people are subject to the same restrictions.<br /><br />The most egregious examples come from Zimbabwe, and the reign of Robert Mugabe, who came to power by driving out the white minority rule of Ian Smith. At one point the national bank ran a lottery; the qualification was to keep $1,000 in an account for a month. The winner, on a \\"random\\" draw, was - Robert Mugabe. There have been constant allegation of vote-fixing in elections, and most people seem to expect Mugabe as a dictator.<br /><br />But not all the news is bad. In Botswana, with its lack of natural resources in the 1800s and most of the 1900s, the British won control but did little to expose their rule, because there was nothing to exploit. After independence in 1966 the country was poverty-stricken, but the new rulers established a country where the leadership was nation-based rather than tribal-based. Then with the discovery of diamonds, Seretse Kharma proposed that mineral rights should also be the property of the government, so all Botswanans would benefit. That's led to Botswana having the standard of living equal to a typical Eastern European or Central American country, far better than any of the original colonies.<br /><br />The best news comes from Brazil, where the Worker's Party has gradually taken over the country. They did this by approaching diverse social movements within Brazil to form a broad-based party, and the Worker's Party has encouraged these movements to play a part in deciding policies. Brazil is now the seventh-largest economy.<br /><br />The world is full of quick solutions that turn out not be as simple as people had hoped, but the idea of extractive versus inclusive organizations seems to work over a vast range of countries over long time-scales. Some people here have criticized the (rare) errors of fact, but even if these had been fixed the argument would still have been extremely effective.<br /><br />What this book gives us is a blueprint for progress. Up till now we've struggled to find a way forward with numerous plans being advanced, but this is the first book I've ever seen that covers such a wide range of governments and history to prove its point. Countries around the world, with apparently little in common, conform to its arguments.<br /><br />So, I urge you to read this book. Whatever your political persuasion, it will tell you something that you don't already know. The rights you have today, wherever you are, need to be constantly checked to make sure that they're not eroded. Extremes of left or right are dangerous, and bear in mind that just about all the political parties in Europe, for instance, are to the left of the Democrats in the U.S.<br /><br />So, it's easy enough to read, it contains important truths, and has earned the respect of the best minds on the subject.

The way Collins portray the plot makes you feel like you are a tribute in the Games and the way the writing display the main character's, Katniss, personality and ideology is just perfect. If you want to read something to loose your mind read it. The only bad thing about this book is its size. I would really like it to be bigger.
B003MC5N28|5.0|This book gave me the chills. I loved the bold, crazy concept of it: a young child learns what it means to be The Giver of knowledge to his bizarre society...he's been chosen to absorb the experiences and emotions of the wise, old sage (the giver),  but in the process, Jonas loses his childhood. Although I saw some of the hardballs of this story coming, they still whacked me in the head as I read them. Nicely done! I haven't been able to shake this story from my brain.
0439023491|5.0|I've just finished reading \\"Catching Fire\\" and I'm totally in love with the book and the Trilogy. Normally sequels aren't better than the first novels but Collins nail it. It really makes an improvement, if it can be done, upon the first book. It's mainly because we can feel the evolution in the characters ideology, how the Games marked them, how the scars left by the events on the first book haunt them and their decitions. The evolution in Katniss's personality is clear she doesn't is the poor girl saving her sister anymore but she still is the strong woman doing whatever is need to be done in order to protect the ones she love.<br /><br />The ideas planted on the book and mainly in the Games portrayed in this book also show evolution and improvement. This is because Collins gives more background and digs more deeply into the main ideology of the Trilogy. Giving the Gamemakers a more important roll in the story, specially during the develpment of the \\"75th Hunger Games\\" or the third \\"Quarter Quell\\", opens the panorama displayed on the first book about the people in the Capitol and let us comprehend that not all the Capitol people is as bad as we might think. I really loved the new arena and the clock's idea.<br /><br />If you read the first book and you liked it, I can assure you you will love this one. I can't wait to read Mockingjay.
B007BRJYF2|2.0|this game was a waste. I like these kind of games but you need to be able to see the objects
B004SJ3BCI|2.0|Why does it have to be so hard!!?? I get mad at it a lot a lot a lot so much! It is because of the pigs. I hit it but it does not die!!! I am so mad at it.
B000X6VEN8|5.0|Great album.  I listened to Three Cheers for Sweet Revenge, The Black Parade and Danger Days before I listened to this album.  But after listening to this album I have to say this must be one of there BEST albums.  Really wished I had heard it earlier.  If your thinking of getting it, just buy it, its an amazing album.
0345803485|2.0|If i were 16, i would think this was a fantastic book. However, I'm not. It's S&M 101, or remedial even. I would recommend Anne Rice's Sleeping Beauty trilogy. Once you read that, you will also find this story pathetic.
B004RSCWZ2|4.0|This release features Susan's gravely voice,which Ilike and Derek Truck's guitar, but,imo, lacks the bluesy feel of Susan's past contributions,and some punch remiscent of Allman Bros.
0893860220|5.0|I really enjoyed this book i found it at the right time  on my spiritual path . it has forever changed me. i could not help but notice the similarities to gurdjiffs \\" life is only real when  i am\\" as well .  a small misnomer nisargdatta makes it out that one should say \\" i am\\"  so why this is called \\"i am that\\"? ( which is taken from a quote by Krishna )  is a little misleading . i felt to ad the word \\" that introduced something else.  but beyond that. this book is fantastic
0061150142|4.0|I have enjoyed most of Jodi Picoult's books, but I particularly enjoyed this one.  It had a little twist that kept me guessing.  Ms. Picoult does a great job of tackling interesting subjects and looking at them from various points of view.

B006NXIDMU|5.0|The Hunger Games, book 1 in The Hunger Games Trilogy, is a creative and captivating story likened to modern day gladiators, if those gladiators were drawn out of a hat and between the ages of 12 and 18. The books gripping tale about a young woman, Katniss Everdeen, focuses around the 74th annual Hunger Games, an invention of the controlling 'Capitol' to keep the surrounding districts in order. The Hunger Games itself is a fight to the death between 24 tributes (a male and female tribute from each of the 12 districts) and is viewed as a sport by the Capitol, where bets and odds are placed on the different tributes for entertainment and pleasure. The Hunger Games is full of disturbing twists and gut wrenching adventures. You wont be disappointed if you enjoy adventure, fantasy, confusing love triangles and a rage against 'the man'. It's well worth a read and in fact, I'd say it's only downfall was it was all over too quickly!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I use this Bible app everyday. I especially like that it has so many versions I can use. Very User friendly and easy to upload scriptures to FB.
B005LAIHIQ|5.0|Just as Good as the Original T.V. series But<br />only it Features a lot More Humor.<br /><br />  I can Hardly wait for this Movie to get Released<br /> on DVD so I can add it to my Video Movie Collection.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I was engrossed in reading WOOL from the moment I began.  Excellent weave of plot and subplots.  Sit up and take notice readers, this AUTHOR is going to be considered Classic before long.
B007PS0X0W|2.0|Of course i believe directers and film producers just make movies for the hell of it just to make money, however i wish they'd stopped milking some of my favourite movies in order to do so, i mean the first two underworlds brilliant the third one: although not necessary still good and i enjoyed it however this one is just lacking the excitement and joy of making the first two, they had no way of really making a fourth one without coming up with some pointless story which made it even more ludacris: well they succeed at that and by the looks of it we could have a 5th one on its way! Kate Beckinsale is on top form and im sure i speak for everyone when i say we enjoy watching her on screen however this movie shouldnt have been made they should have quit whilst they were ahead!
1450419895|3.0|I received this book for free as part of LibraryThing's Early Reviewers program.<br /><br />The Strength Training Anatomy Workout II is a gorgeously illustrated volume. Each of the many workouts is shown with the affected muscles highlighted, and often important variations in the position, posture, and anatomy are diagrammed as well. This book is a sequel, and as such does not contain basic workout information that is found in the first volume.<br /><br />With the basics out of the way, let's talk about my impression of the book's recommendations. I think overall this book is pretty good, and the anatomy and exercises should be of interest to many strength trainers. However, I did notice some areas where opinions may differ. This book focuses first on building muscle mass, then strength. Training for hypertrophy has become a cultural default in strength training, but it is not the only option. In the discussion of free weights versus machines, some space is given to anatomical variations and how they effect form with free weights, but very little space is given to the influence of flexibility and technique in proper form. For example, in the section on squats, the ratio of torso to femur length and its influence on squat form is discussed, but it was apparent to me from the illustration that increased hip and hamstring flexibility would fix the problem.<br /><br />As a CrossFitter, I am bound to have some disagreements with the methodology in this book, but overall I think it is good for what it is trying to do.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|great lots to do in the game fishing hunting building stuff fun when your bored and there's nothing to do
B0033V51QG|2.0|I am not one who reads as much as many of you. My time is spent mostly \\"doing\\", as opposed to reading about doing. That said, I selected this book to read as one that I thought would be useful and enlightening. While it did provide some insights to the inner workings of the mind, it fell short of my expectations.<br /><br />To me, the content did not represent that which was implied by the title. Furthermore, the first half of the book relating to the authors experiences in a concentration camp, was severely disconnected with the second part of the book, which was basically, a self help phychoanalysis book. Both parts were interesting to a degree, but I did not think that they complimented each other. Like I said, disjointed at best.<br /><br />I know one reviewer stated that this is the best book he has in his entire (and massive) book collection. I'm sorry but, that's sad.<br /><br />Just one man's opinion.....
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|easy to learn and fun to play. no problems with glitches. I like being able to build my settlement and improve and expand.
B007V2UGPE|4.0|worth a try ... its free so why not. crisp graphics on the kindle fire! very simple controls at first this game has a lot of potential
B005QJZ5FA|2.0|I heard a lot about this songstress before listening to this release -- I heard about the SNL appearance and how it was panned by the critics. I gave the cd a listen and this is what I have come up with. There are some instantly forgettable songs that I can't even listen through the whole track. Born to Die is a great song with a very interesting mix of dusky lyrics and trippy music. The video is even more interesting. The song Blue Jeans is another gem with the same formulaic approach as Born to Die...You can also include the song Video Games with these other 2 as well.  Del Rey (Not her real name) is a beauty... I wonder how interesting and how many 4 and 5 stars she would get if she was plain looking... I guess I would say that while she has 3 or 4 interesting songs on this release I think a lot of this cd is a contrived hit machine maker with Del Rey as the catalyst.. Would have been a great EP...
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is great for bordom. its various games keeps you occupied.my favorite game is the hockey game I'm very good at it and its challenging.
B007Z9RAX4|4.0|I really liked the movie. I saw a lot of negative reviews, but I like to make my own decisions about books and movies. So I have watched it twice and thought Gina did an absolutely perfect job. She holds her own with all the other established actors in the film. Gina is the best female action hero I have seen in years. I think she is just stunning to watch and very natural. So many times actors feel they have to play their role so over the top. Even the best male action stars in movie after movie, get pretty hokie from time to time. The continuity and crediblilty of the action was right on. I love the little nuances that Gina brought to the fight scenes. It is very obvious this girl is a scrapper in real life. If I ever need to be rescued, I hope they send Mallory Kane. I would highly recommend this film and am very much looking forward to Gina's next action movie. I only have two things to criticise. One it wasn't long enough and two the music track was mixed too high for the dialoque in the beginning few minutes of the movie. I liked it so much I bought the DVD. Bravo Ms Carano!
B007V2UGPE|5.0|its a fun game even better if u put time into it I am currently on round 31 get it
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I really like this game because you can play so many games and you can earn points in many different ways. I play this game a lot.
0385534639|2.0|If you are looking for a book with character development, this is NOT the book for you.<br /><br />The two main characters who fall in love are one dimensional with NO personality. Both Celia and Marco are fall flat and are WAY to similar in their speaking styles AND their interactions with the other characters. You can literally use their names interchangeably -- THAT'S how boring and similar they are to each other.<br /><br />This book is WAY overhyped. It isn't terrible. Aside from the 2 main characters and the incredibly cheesy and lame love story, The Night Circus isn't a bad read. Events lead into each other but honestly, I was so uninterested in Marco & Celia (their romance litereally made my eyes roll) that I would just skim through their passages and read Bailey's sections with the Twins. The Twins & Bailey (and other side characters) were able to hold my attention but even towards the end of the book, they were not enough to give this book 3 stars.<br /><br />Honestly, I felt Celia's & Marco's \\"unwavering\\" love for each other came out of no where. I'm not a fan of Twilight but I feel even Twilight's love story is better than his one!<br /><br />This book is NOT worth purchasing. Many people mentioned that they liked the ending. The ending wasn't bad but definitely incredibly cliche and lame. I literally had to force myself to read the middle - end.<br /><br />However, if you like happy endings and love cliches, go for this book. Otherwise, do yourself a favor and skip it.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|its pretty good. I think it is pretty fun. But so many games are really exspensive. So that makes it not as fun. Other than that its pretty fun.  -
B0054JZC6E|3.0|I like most of the games, but some of how it is set up could be improved<br />keep it up

B0054JZC6E|5.0|The games are all varieties instead of having to download each game seperately, you get to receive a variety of arcade games.
0307592731|5.0|Although this is a fine memoir, what made the book sing for me is that it's also an outstanding travel book about Cheryl's amazing PCT hike. Not only did I feel like I got to know Cheryl, but I was surprised that all the other people in the book came alive, too. This is a terrific book.
B005DC68NI|5.0|I got more valuable information from David's book than from all other sources (blogs, websites, guides) put together.  It's clear, concise, valuable, and a pleasure to read.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|\\"The Mockingjay,\\" the final volume in the Hunger Games trilogy, deals with the destruction of the dystopia that was dented in the first volume and began to crack in the second.<br /><br />While Katniss recovers from the wounds she suffered at the end of \\"Catching Fire,\\" she becomes The Mockingjay, the symbol of the rebellion, which is well under way by the time she's cleared for duty again.<br /><br />And then the tale turns into a \\"platoon sallies forth\\" military sci-fi adventure, and succeeds very well on that level, especially considering how Ms. Collins is a master of the curveball, always managing to toss in a surprise or two.<br /><br />But the games still go on: Katniss is still dealing with the Gale or Peeta dilemma, trying to get the revenge on President Snow that she has been promised, and also having to watch her back, as there are people on her own side who think that the Mockingjay is better suited for martyrdom than success.<br /><br />Ms. Collins is limited by the first-person present narrative structure, in which we see only what Katniss experiences directly, but she uses this limitation to her advantage: instead of providing multiple points of view of the various skirmishes the way, say, David Weber does in the Honor Harrington series, her focus is totally on Katniss and her mates as she hacks her way through to the end. And what a strange and cynical end it is.

B000004166|5.0|I am an old guy that discovered Mozart at age 66. I found that I like Mozart transparent and not romanticized. Uchida's Mozart pianos concertos were to my taste, and similarly I find Grumiaux's Mozart violin concertos incredibly well done. I can't imagine the Adagios in Concertos 3 and 5 done any more beautifully...anywhere. What treasures these are! Since Grumiaux passed away in 1986, I am thankful that Philips did such a great job remixing these for posterity. By the way my CD from Amazon had a defect and I requested an exchange. That doesn't change my opinion of what a great recording this is.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book was an incredible journey into the world of BDSM and I have to say I was pleasantly surprised at how well written and tasteful it was.  The characters were very believable and the story line kept me on the edge of my seat.  Most books that I have read about this topic are crude and don't portray the emotional aspects of the submissive role, or they make the submissive seem like a woman of loose morals.  This book managed to give an incredible love story while allowing the submissive to not be slutty (forgive the vulgar language) but if you've read other BDSM stories you will understand my point.<br /><br />In short, this was an incredible book and one I am glad that I purchased.  James did a wonderful job and I can't wait to read more from this author.  My only regret is that it took me this long to finally purchase it.
B005LAIH2W|5.0|I have never read the books but this movie was a fun ride from start to finish.<br />I actually went to see it for only one reason.<br />That is James Purefoy.  What a wonderful Kantos Kan he portrayed. Loved it and will certainly buy it on DVD.<br />Debbie
B00004Z400|5.0|This purchase was a gift for a close friend who had her CDs stolen recently. I personally have had this album sine it came out. It has never got old to listen to.  Every album they have came out with is great, but this one is without a doubt my favorite!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Initially, I wasn't interested in this book. But after all the hype I decided to download the sample. I found the book easy to read and intriguing. James did a fine job with twists and turns, and capturing my interest. I read all three books in about 10 days, and have about 20 other friends hooked on Fifty and the oh so Mercurial Christian Grey. Loved it and can't wait to read more from EL James.
0553381695|5.0|The second book is more about the wars and fighting than the story, although the story continues.  It kept me interested to the end, and I ordered #3. These books are well written with adult language.  Not dirty words, but lesser known words and the situations are mature.  This is not a childish fantasy book. I hope I have the perseverance to get through 3 more long books with a complicated story line.
B0075564A8|5.0|Great documentary, loved it in 1990 and still love it today.  Every Madonna fan should have this in their collection.
0316286850|2.0|The book is ok, entertaining and has cute little stories. My problem with it is that he (Kevin) talks about not being afraid of color and playing with makeup and then he does all these boring faces... all of them with a shade of red lipstick and a neutral eyeshadow (which he always calls \\"brown\\"). How fun.<br /><br />My other problem with the book is that he doesn't know what he actually used for the photos, so he guesses the colors and somehow he always says \\"use brown\\", even though the photo looks taupe shimmer (Jewel), grey (Sandy Franklin), silver (Thelma Aucoin), blue shimmer (Tori Amos), dark grey (Isabella Rossellini). He also forgets that he has used other products, and thus fails to mention them, like the white shimmer on the inner eye in Demi Moore as \\"The vamp\\", the white lower eye rim pencil in \\"the icon\\", the pewter crease shadow in \\"the swinger\\", etc.<br /><br />If I need to guess the colors then i might as well just google pictures of made up faces. I actually do, rather than grabbing this book.<br /><br />The first part of \\"making the face\\" is nice though, informative for the uninitiated. I especially liked the \\"brows\\" section, but had I seen this in real life beforehand, I wouldn't have bought it. I think it's uninspired and basic.
0345803485|1.0|I bought this book because I was curious as to what all the hoopla was about. What a waste of money. It is sad to say that this is one of the worst books that I have ever read.  First of all, the writing itself is sophomoric and simplistic beyond imagining.  The dialogue is stilted and seems to have arisen from a time warp of at least forty years, or better yet, a sexed up romance comic book. The characters are poorly drawn and one dimensional.  It is hard to believe that Ms. James  believes that current college graduates actually go around saying,\\"Oh crap,\\" at every important opportunity.  To have we, as the audience, actually believe that the central character of Ana has made her way through college without ever having kissed a boy is really trying our credulity.  The set-up is preposterous on the face of it and bears absolutely no relation to reality in any shape or form.  It isn't good fantasy and frankly, others have written infinitely better pornographic sex. This is a book that never should have seen the light of day , let alone gotten published.
B00785P2QC|3.0|Great graphics and everything but I dont think it gives you enough freedom. There are goals that limit what you are able to do. The pesky garage gets in the way.
B005LAIIRQ|4.0|\\"Once more into the fray. Into the last good fight I'll ever know. Live<br />and die on this day. Live and die on this day.\\" After a plane carrying<br />oil drillers crashes in a remote part of Alaska there are only a few<br />survivors. While trying to decide what to do they notice a large wolf<br />stalking them. After an attack Ottway (Neeson) takes charge and tries<br />to lead them to safety. They just wonder what will kill them first, the<br />cold or the wolf pack. Going in I wasn't all that excited about this,<br />but because of my job I watched it. After about a half hour I was<br />hooked and after an hour I was on the edge of my seat and didn't movie<br />until the movie ended. I have tried to stay away from the clich&eacute; movie<br />review lines, but this is best described as an exhilarating adventure<br />that grabs you and doesn't let go till the last frame. Going in I heard<br />that the ending was horrible and ruined the movie. After watching this<br />I am wondering what they were talking about. The ending was perfect and<br />made me like the movie even more. This is a must see movie for action<br />and thriller fans. I really enjoyed this. Overall, one of the best<br />movies of the year so far. I Highly recommend this one. I give it an<br />A-.
0307951529|3.0|I read all the rave reviews and I expected something really special.  What I got was basic advice and motivating stories about how one may start a small business with a small amount of capital in the digital age.  The book has far more on the positives of doing so than the negatives.  The only major negative I remember reading about is that as a small business owner you have to supply your own health insurance.  But this is understandable because the author is a small business fan and does provide motivational stories.  The author describes a small business as \\"freedom\\" and working for a big company as the opposite of freedom.  I don't know that I agree.  It all depends on whether you like what you do.  It takes effort to make money whatever you do.  There is a lot of marketing behind this book and some substance but in my opinion more marketing.
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|App won't load and looks for updates until crashing. Not worth my time. Not worth yours either. Find another game.
B004Y1USV2|5.0|Thanks to Trevor Horn for pulling Chris, Steve and Alan into the studio with Geoff and Benoit to produce another great work of art for Yes fans around the world. Yes is back with great tunes that are stunning and beautiful, but also bring back memories from Drama and other great albums from Yes' legacy. Trevor admits in his interview on the DVD (released with the CD) that he brought the \\"Fly from Here\\" idea out of the archives from the Drama recording sessions. The whole concept is excellent and sounds great. Steve is superb on guitar, as always. Chris and Alan bring energy to the Yes beat and rhythm that I have missed for so long. You guys still have it. Geoff's keyboards are perfect...but I miss Rick's spirit on this release. Benoit's vocals are also perfect...you are unique, while bringing Yes a feel that reminds me of Jon. God Bless You, Jon...and God Bless Trevor for your energy and vision to craft this album...Another Great \\"Yes Album\\".

B0000D96NW|4.0|After their 2 lackluster efforst in the past, they start to find their way. I'm not saying that their last 2 albums were bad and they both had a few good songs on each but were very inconsistent, they were more intended for fans of nu-metal. Through The Ashes Of Empires offers more quality songs and they stay true to their roots, it sounds like their first 2 a lot since it's heavier and more thrash/groove metal but with hints of modern metal to make it sound more up to date. The guitar riffs and solos are great but the lyrics are the absolute best part of the CD. Has some talented songwriting and some of the best lyrics written by a metal band. Modern metal hasn't died and TTAOE proves it, makes over half the nu-metal, metalcore and screamo/emo bands sound pointless and effortless. There are some amazing tracks like \\"In The Presence Of my Enemies\\", \\"Left Unfinished\\", \\"Days Turn Blue To Gray\\" and my personal favorite \\"All Falls Down\\". TTAOE has brought hope back to Machine Head and it's the best they've done since More Things Change, one of the best albums of 2004.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love this game so much I will never ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever stop playing it.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I have NEVER bought a work out DVD before because honestly, I thought they were useless... BUT after attempting this DVD and No More Trouble Zones at a friends house- I knew this was the real deal. I actually purchased this DVD from Target for like $9, but only after reading all the positive reviews on Amazon. I'm on day 4 and ever since day 1 I have barely been able to make it down my stairs. SERIOUSLY GOOD!! I need to lose like 20 lbs to be at my ideal weight and although I doubt this DVD will seriously allow me to shed those, it is certainly helping me to get toned, put me into a physical mindset and get me strong enough to endure weight lifting in the gym or something. This is definitely a DVD to begin a healthy active new lifestyle. I am restricting my calories to around 1310 a day- as told by (My Plate) on Livestrong.com.... I will continue to use that in conjuncture with this DVD and will post updates along the way. My main issue is with cellulite, flab, and weakness lol- Sooo in that respect all I am looking for from this 30 day Shred is to push me in the right direction to my dream physique....its looking like a winner! BUY THIS

0062183591|4.0|Do you cheat at anything?  Anything at all?  Be honest with yourself.  No?  Dan Ariely would beg to differ.  He is the author of numerous successful behavioral psychology books as well as a Professor at Duke University and continues his body of work with a book determined to understand how widespread cheating, what is the impact on society, why people do it and what can be done about it?<br /><br />Ariely hits us right in the face toward the beginning but discussing a study he did in which he allowed test takers to report their own scores-not knowing they could be caught stretching the truth.  What he found out, was that on average stretching the truth was based upon a percentage that the test taker felt they could get away with and in \\"good conscience\\" be OK with.  In other words, it's not cheating, but stretching the truth.<br /><br />Another great point that Ariely hits on is when discussing business people such as accountants.  Do they round down their hours or round up?  Do you think they ever charge slightly more than what they have really done?  Of course they do!  What is the impact of this?  Ariely discusses that.  Another interesting component he discusses is how and why we justify these things to ourselves and the fact that we begin to actually believe the lies we tell.<br /><br />The take home message is that most everyone stretches the truth, but the reasons why make for a very compelling and fascinating look in to the human psyche.  This is a book that will stick with you and generally speaking make you look at society a bit differently.  It's good to be aware of these things.  Although the word cheating is looked at to be horrifyingly terrible-Ariely's point that we all do it in one way or another is quite interesting and worthy of your time and money.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I was so hooked on these books I read the whole trilogy in under 4 days. I was never so interested in a book. Talk about edge of your seat, emotional,  and erotic all in one. LOVED IT!
0307957934|3.0|I read this thriller several months ago and actually just completely forget to review it...because I forgot that I even read it.  Is there anything worse for a book than apathy?  It starts off quite promising with the tales of an ultra-rich hedge fund manager and a mysterious death.  Why?  How?  Who?  What forces could be behind this?  Turns out that the hedge fund manager has an AI technology that trades in nanoseconds and gauges the market based upon a number of factors-one of which is the Fear Index.  When are stock purchases more fearful and how can the buyer of a stock (a computer) take advantage of that?<br /><br />The portions about the stock market itself and what is true regarding \\"day trading\\" and the real facts behind the Fear Index are quite interesting-but there aren't enough of them.  The story is character driven but the characters just aren't compelling enough for them to really matter.  It becomes a very straight forward mystery aside from the fact that some of the trading facts are interesting.  I have not read a Robert Harris book before and don't feel compelled to read another.  There are so many great thrillers in our world-I'm just not sure why this would be the one to spend your time on.  Great story idea, but poorly executed.  Don't be fooled by, \\"Wow, this sounds interesting,\\" because that trick does wear old with this book.  It's not horrible, by any stretch-just forgettable.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I was on the edge of my seat with the first one so I had to get the second. I love this trilogy. I never felt so many emotions reading a book.
B004HY3BTC|4.0|this is a great movie, i remember watching it as a kid in the early 90's. i had searched online for years trying to find it, and stumbled upon it here. i wanted the blu ray version. i wasn't expecting much as far as quality, i mean after all the movie was produced in 1987/1988.<br />i was pleasantly surprised however, picture was crystal clear and sound was very crisp. overall a lot better than i expected. the only reason i didn't give this five stars was because there are NO special features. it's just the movie and subtitles.<br />other than that, great movie for adults and kids alike!
B007SGM084|5.0|This is one of my FAVORITE trilogies ever! The price was totally worth it. LOVED THEM! Read the trilogy in under 4 days.
B006WT2TZC|4.0|If you're a Scorpions fan you will love most of these songs. This album updates the songs to how the Scorpions play them in concerts today. I bought the version on Amazon for the Amazon exclusive bonus track \\"Still Loving You (2011),\\" and because it was cheaper for the whole album on Amazon than the German Saturn music store. Along with this version of the album I also bought the bonus track \\"Big City Nights (2011)\\" that was an exclusive to the German store Saturn for 1,29 euros. It was money well spent. Big City Nights (2011) is one of the best songs on the album (my prejudice opinion), but keep in mind that it is not available on the Amazon version. Back to the Amazon version: You really can't go wrong with \\"Rhythm Of Love\\", \\"No One Like You\\", \\"The Zoo\\", \\"Rock You Like A Hurricane\\", \\"Blackout\\", \\"Wind Of Change\\", \\"Still Loving You\\", \\"Across The Universe (Beatles Cover)\\", \\"All Day And All Night (Kinks Cover)\\", \\"Ruby Tuesday (Rolling Stones Cover)\\", and if you buy the Saturn exclusive \\"Big City Nights.\\" The other songs are iffy, but well done. If they would have put some other songs besides \\"Tainted Love\\", \\"Children Of The Revolution\\", and \\"Tin Soldier\\" I would have given this album 5 stars. The slots those 3 songs took up could have been better utilized with songs like \\"You and I\\", \\"Bad Boys Running Wild\\", and \\"Coast to Coast\\", or any other songs that the Scorpions have written \\"Holiday\\", etc...  since almost all of them are completely amazing.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|One of my favorite books EVER! I laughed, cried, got butterflies, and so much more. This book was very interesting and had me on the edge of my seat.

B0071MQBX0|5.0|I have been listening and watching PTO for 25 years! I still get goosebumps when I hear songs like The Music of the Night, All I Ask of You and Past the Point of No Return.  And now I have the capability to watch this over and over again in my home, and it won't cost me $80+ a ticket!  Ramin and Seirra are brilliant as the Phantom and Christine.  A real joy and treasure to watch and listen too.  At the end 6-past Phantoms to include our beloved original Phantom - Michael Crawford and Christine - Sarah Brightman join the current cast on stage for some encore songs. If you are a Phantom fan, then this is a must to own and enjoy!

B007EC6FIS|5.0|This is a strong, solid, consistently good album from start to finish.  There isn't a bad song on the album, and there are a handful of REALLLLLYYY good ones.  Strangeland is also a generous 16 tracks, which makes up for the shortness of their last album.  I'm so grateful that Keane are back!  I've missed them!
B005EGXTHG|5.0|This is by far the best book of the three-part series - a real page-turner (if not somewhat predictable). Just like the first book it's clearly meant for a young audience and as a result is very easy to read and continues the romance factor. I really enjoyed it.
B005EGXTHG|5.0|I saw the film first, thought it was a great story then read all three books, one after another. So much more in the books
0307593312|1.0|I heard some positive things about this writer so gave the book a try without checking into it too much. This book was very disappointing, way too long and left way too much unfinished. Some of the characters it seems, had no reason even being in the story - added nothing, made no sense. When I, eventually, painfully, got to the end, I felt cheated. There was no resolution of the story. It was like driving down this long boring road with the occasional interesting thing pop up and then the road just ends. Some of the other reviewers have stated that his other stories are better, but after this I wouldn't waste my time with anything else of his. Life is too short for bad books when there are so many other really great ones like the Passage.
B005LRWRZ8|5.0|I can't get enough of this album! Deadly Night Shade is just awesome! I can't get it out of my head. This is real metal.
B006RUJST6|5.0|Rarely has a series elicited such passion from me on so many levels. Sure, I think lots of people would enjoy \\"The Twilight Saga,\\" even more would enjoy \\"The Hunger Games Trilogy,\\" and some sickos like me will LOVE LOVE LOVE the \\"Fifty Shades of Grey Trilogy.\\" However, most people who know me, who are friends with me, and who love reading, NEED to read \\"Slammed\\" and \\"Point of Retreat\\" by Colleen Hoover. Need. To.<br /><br />This is not a paranormal love story like \\"The Twilight Saga\\" or \\"The Eden Trilogy.\\" These are real people, real lives, no hope of eternity to linger in the distance- we are left to deal with the here and now.<br /><br />This 2-book series follows Layken Cohen and William Cooper as they navigate what they hope to be a romance- filled relationship. Layken (Lake) is new to William's neighborhood and their connection is instant. Lake finds out after their first trip to a club night dedicated to Slam Poetry, that their connection is deeper that a skipped heartbeat. Will is a talented and dedicated slam poet, and you learn a lot about him, and yourself, while he's up on stage.<br /><br />Let me give a huge shout out to the emotionally strong Layken Cohen. She doesn't pine away thinking, \\"what could Will POSSIBLY see in me, la la la....\\" She has the mentality, \\"He's hot, I like him, I know he likes me, what the HELL is the problem?!\\" She's got tenacity, and that's been so lacking at the core of so many female  characters lately....<br /><br />Life throws 2 HUGE roadblocks in their way in the first novel- both of them could justifiably keep the lovers apart independently, but the double blow is enough to leave the reader in tears, praying for our fictional star-crossed pair. The physical romance is written tastefully and using the correct words to allow you to feel what Lake is feeling, and what Will is feeling. Each touch leaves you wanting more and each roadblock is so real that you can feel the punch in your gut. Again, we're not dealing with angels,vampires, werewolves- we are dealing with real life and you could be reading this story about a best friend.<br /><br />The supporting characters are just that, beautifully supportive but they do not overtake the story. We are able to enjoy what they bring out of the main characters, but we're not left spending too much time wondering when they'll show up again. The main characters are that strong and that engrossing.<br /><br />Poetry is essentially the third main character in this story- and it is done SO. WELL. The author clearly took time to study slam poetry as an art and performance, as her descriptions are dead on. Further, she is also a poet (not many writers are) and the poetry itself is done well, even while written through the characters' perspective. Take a minute to realize how awesome this is. Not only can she write poetry, but she can do it through several different characters that have different make ups, backgrounds, and emotions- that's a big deal. I've written poetry for nearly 20 years and I don't know if I could write it from inside the head of someone else. Even if they're a character I've created.<br /><br />When Slammed (book 1) ends, we're left with a glimmer of hope, some sadness, and a yearning for more of Will and Lake's story.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Remember Desmond from Lost, biding his time in an underground bunker entering numbers into a computer because someone told him to, convinced that disaster was imminent if he didn't do so? Imagine an entire city living like this in a massive underground silo for decades, afraid of what remained of the world above ground and yet accepting of their lives underground because they simply knew no other way--except for a few restless souls.<br /><br />The outside world is desolate wasteland, merely a projection on a wall served up from a sensor array above ground. Whenever someone steps out of line or dares to challenge the status quo, they face the ultimate punishment of being sent out to their doom to clean the silo's only connection to what's left of the world. No one ever survives, and even though some initially refuse, every one of them--eyes open and wool in hand--unexplainably carries out this final selfless task.<br /><br />The world building in Wool is magnificent as Howey details the inner workings of the silo and its people in a way that, while sometimes obvious, is easily relatable to today's society, and hints at even larger revelations to come in future installments. A really great read that is both touching and thoughtful, and not afraid to pull the rug out from under you without warning.
B0028IDXDS|1.0|I have seen these in stores and online and I am curious as to why someone would put a plush animal so close to the nose and mouth of an infant? Hasnt anyone heard of SIDS?? Maybe I am a bit paranoid, but why risk it? The first thing we tell new parents is to keep plush animals and blankets away from babies faces. So again, why do this? Sure its \\"cute\\" but it just seems risky.
B007DJUO8O|5.0|Opeth had already pissed off some intolerant fans with \\"Heritage\\" where leader Mikael Akerfeldt ditched his death metal grunting once and for all in favor of much stronger melodies.  If that didn't take the cake, \\"Storm Corrosion\\" will.  This album is unlike anything the two genius collaborators have done in their own primary bands, Porcupine Tree (Wilson) and Akerfeldt (Opeth) although there are a few measures that recall some mellower moments from Wilson's solo material.<br />  This album is one of atmosphere and melody, with sparse vocals, only one or two very quiet drum parts and lots of strings and acoustic guitars.  Some will dismiss it as quiet background music, which will be entirely missing the point.  There is a time and place for all music, and Wilson and Akerfeldt teach metal and prog fans a valuable lesson, mainly that they are much more than one genre.  This is stuff you can lay back and almost melt into the mix to.  It would sound great for spacey arrangements that always sound good when you're traveling at night with the moon and stars out to give you that outer spacey feeling.  It is not a good CD though for tired drivers due to its extremely hypnotic trancelike nature.  It is great though for relaxing, meditating and maybe other stuff I won't mention here.<br />  For those who love good ambience music and beautiful yet eerie melodies, you can't go wrong with \\"Storm Corrosion\\".  Maybe this CD will show hard headed listeners that it's okay to explore unchartered musical territory and not just be relegated to putting out the same album over and over again.
B0058A119G|5.0|a tribute from Barbra Streisand to Alan and Marilyn Bergman.  Forget the second half of the disc, as it's all old stuff; though with glorious voice.  You've heard that song before.<br /><br />The gems are in the new songs Streisand has recorded.  Her rendition of \\"That Face\\" alone is worth the price of this album.  Excuse me, CD.<br /><br />Streisand is so musically clever and adventurous on these tracks and the voice still has the subtle power to astound.<br /><br />The music and lyrics of the Bergman's. while sometimes so sappy they make your teeth ache, are not in evidence here.  No need to run to the dentist.<br /><br />Her best album since \\"The Broadway Album\\".  She's tops.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|great for small kids and bored adults looking to kill some time while waiting for said kids.  unfortunately you will be pressured at some point to buy more acorns or coins.  Same ol'type of game just with a shiney new cover.
B0079XNWQA|5.0|The best way I can think of to describe this album is to say that listening to it gives me the feeling of falling in love. It took me a few listens to truly love it (with the exception of 5/6 and In Your Hands which I loved from the very first time I heard them) but now I can't stop listening to it. My favorites are 5/6, The World As I See It (and the second part of it - not sure if that's a hidden track or part of the same song), In Your Hands, Who's Thinking About You Now?, and Everything is Sound (not necessarily in any particular order since it changes daily).  I absolutely recommend this album but I would suggest listening to it a few times before deciding if you like it or not.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I heard about all the hype. I get that it's erotica. I understand that it's supposed to be like twilight for adults. I'm an adult. I loved twilight when I read it, it was my guilty pleasure. But this book? This book reads like a 14 year old girl's attempt to write S & M.  It takes no risks, and the characters have been done many times over....and over....and over....and better.

1416562605|4.0|This is a very interesting look at India through the eyes of a rich man's driver who has raised himself up to become a uniformed servant who is treated well by his employers until an event turns him against the family and changes his life forever by the decisions that follow.  If you want to learn what Indian life is like from the lowly servant's point of view, as well as a snapshot of the rich people they work for, then you'll learn a lot by reading this book.  Very well written.  I'd read more books by this author.  He lets you get inside the head of the driver and make you feel like you understand him.  But he might surprise you.

B0054JZC6E|4.0|I love this app! Very fun and so many choices and options. I'm addicted to this app. I love it
B002RI91IU|2.0|I bought it because I had looked at several works by Paul Auster, and wanted to read an initial work.<br />But the misery and the hopeless, aimless lives of the characters wore me down.<br />And that is despite the connections made each with other that are discovered in reading<br />And the writing itself which is evocative and clear.<br />I pressed on hoping to find something I could use. I didn't find anything. And unlike others I cannot be bothered deciphering hidden meanings in maps of New York.<br />In summary: clever and well written, but about people I have no interest in because I doubt their existence.<br />Even among the most hopeless down and outs that I meet in my work, I have not found such a waste of life and it makes me feel that the aimlessness and waste is contrived. People in the main, continue to strive even when their efforts get them nowhere. Addiction, lack of confidence, or mental illness may make them vicious, thoughtless, uncaring and always lonely,[[ASIN:0143039830 The New York Trilogy (Penguin Classics Deluxe Edition)]][[ASIN:0143039830 The New York Trilogy (Penguin Classics Deluxe Edition)]] but it does not make people like Auster depicts.

B002AWX6UM|5.0|This book is an excellent read. The horrors the author witnessed and experienced as a little boy ignited a variety of emotions within me. Anger, shock, horror, disappointment but finally a sigh of relief as he has overcome his tribulations. With the right mentor and loving support,he transformed into an intelligent, educated and conscientious young man. This is an excellent memoir. I would never have guessed that this is the author's first book. This speaks volumes of his writing skills.
0345803485|2.0|I found this book to be misleading and, in a sexually ignorant culture, this is a problem. For example, it is an incredible fantasy to assume that a sexually inexperienced virgin is going to have mind-blowing orgasms from penile penetration from the get-go. Most women have orgasms via oral sex but the male protagonist doesn't get around to that until chapter 25! (I admit I did skip some middle chapters out of sheer boredom.) And there is the strong intimation that people who are into kink are psychologically scarred from childhood trauma, a stereotype not supported by any research that I know of.<br /><br />But besides misinformation the book has a heroine who acquiesces to sexual behaviors she finds abhorrent because of the flimsiness of his gorgeous looks, a hotness factor that justifies overriding her misgivings and instincts he is untrustworthy. Being turned on is never a good reason to take personal risks and this fantasy does not model good sexual decision-making.<br /><br />But at a meta-level this book duplicates patriarchal gender roles. Glorifying female submission to male domination is not new but this book suggests that, if combined with pain (for the woman!), the result will be sexual ecstasy. Ask a battered wife how much sense that makes! People who explore this aspect of power dynamics in sexual relations must be strongly grounded in strict rules about respect, consensual sex, and safety. This requires both experience and maturity neither of which the female protagonist possesses.<br /><br />Being a best seller is less about the book and more about our hunger for permission to explore and take sexuality to deeper levels, to ask for or demand from our partners something that moves us beyond the safe, boring vanilla sex sanctioned by the western Church, i.e. missionary position, for male pleasure, to enhance procreative possibilities. So, if the book empowers lovers to try something new or if women begin to listen to their inner sex goddess, then it will have served a good purpose. On the other hand, you don't need to accept submission or pain or acquiesce to relationship inequality in order to spice up a love life.

0451228375|3.0|After reading \\"The Pillars of the Earth,\\" I was excited to continue with the story via \\"World Without End.\\" However, I am finding it slow going, and unlike not being able to put the first book down, I am finding it hard to pick this one up. I have been told that it does drag at first, but gets so much better after a few chapters. I am hoping that is so. I am finding that when I do pick it up, I enjoy reading it, but once I put it down, I might not pick it up again for a few days or longer.
B006RUJST6|5.0|Wow. Wow. I seriously need something but I can't decide what exactly after finishing this amazing book. I feel like I've been scrubbed raw. Yanked inside out. How can I even attempt to give words to all of the feelings poring out of me after reading this? I'm in awe. Utterly and completely. All of my emotions reeling and my heart aching but in a marvelously bittersweet communion sadness and joy.<br /><br />There are no words. Nothing I can say will do justice to the experience that is Ms. Colleen Hoover's writing. You simply have to read it because this book is not just a reading it's an emotional experience. At 314 pages it manages to succinctly pack a poetic punch on each one of its pages. I will forever read anything Ms. Hoover writes as I do not want miss anything she creates.<br /><br />Readers believe me when I say, there's no need to think about reading this book. You just MUST read this book.
0823015017|5.0|Absolutely love this book! It is not a book intended to teach you techniques per say. It is a book explaining color theory. And yes, it takes a book to explain color theory. These ladies have taken a somewhat daunting subject matter and made it interesting and fun. I love the exercises provided. They help you understand theory by doing - not just by reading.<br /><br />You can have the best design in the world, but if the colors are lacking the design becomes sub-par. Of course with the correct color palette, a simple design is taken to the next level. Trained artists understand this and if you want to take your work to the next level you should want to understand this as well. I will forever keep this in my library not only for claying, but for graphics design as well.

B007J4T2G8|3.0|At first, I absolutely hated this book. I thought the writing was horrible and the characters made me ill. Ana had no backbone, and Christian was a demanding prick. I wasn't sure I was going to even be able to finish this, or continue past 25%. But then something happened. Somewhere along the reading road, I became slightly addicted. I found I needed to know what happened next. It was somewhat akin to driving by a car accident, or watching a James Dean movie: I had to watch/read.<br /><br />I've read my fair share of erotica, and to be fair Fifty Shades took its sweet time getting to the sweet stuff. Or as my friend would say: getting to the meat. And the sex scenes went from soft porn-like scenes to out and out BDSM. It was not the roughest sex I have read about, nobody was forced into anything and the more I read, the more I could see compromise and love filter through. Was it good writing? Not particularly. I would never nominate it for any kind of literary award. But something about it works. Especially by the end. I actually shed some tears....and was instantly glad for having all three books as I needed to start book two immediately. (This one has a horrible ending. Books should not end on cliffhangers, ever.)

B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love having my Bible with me all of the time now.  It is great to use at church, at home and anywhere I want to pull it up.  Being able to reference different translations of the same scripture makes understanding even the more difficult passages easier to understand.  Just be sure to download one translation to your device so it is available even when Wi -fi isn't .
B005HWAOCA|5.0|This mdvd is on the top of my party favorite lists.  Somtimes I just play what fits my mood and somtimes I just want to party.  When I just want to party I start with disc two from this mdvd set then play Snakes and Arrows disc three with 2112.  After that I play Pink Floyd Pulse disc two with Dark Side of the Moon.<br /><br />This is one of my first music dvds and it inspired me to make a HTPC (home theater PC).  I cannot compare it to other Cream concert dvds but I can hardly believe it could get better.  I have had several Cream's best hits cds for ever and ever and this mdvd was a mind blowing improvement over stereo.<br /><br />The mdvd set has all their best hits which were at the top of the charts in their day and remain some of rock's all time greatest.  I may not know the band well enough to be thier best critic on different concerts and so on but as a fan this mdvd set gets 5 stars hands down.<br /><br />My favorite song included is Toad.  The drum solo in Toad is first class.  White Room and Sunshine of Your Love and Crossroads are outstanding too.<br /><br />In my opinion this is a must have for a Cream fan.  The sound and picture are very good with 2005 era technology and it shows in the shows.
B007V2UGPE|2.0|great looking game but contantly glitches and freezes apparently anytime theres 6 or more zombies, or a lot of stuff on screen especially when using magic, it'll freeze then force close... im using an asus eeepad tablet, it is very disappointing to have such a great looking and fun (before it freezes after a min) game that just glitches constanly.... hopefully someone will decide to use some of that glu money and pay someone to fix it....
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|This game is awesome. People complain about wait for the energy to refill but it just jewels you from sitting on the couch all day.
1933865407|5.0|Extraordinary work of design, aesthetics and creativity in female characters. This compendium not only a great work of art, an memorable object of study.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|My daughter-in-law told me about this book and pointed out that although it is listed as a young adult book, I would really enjoy it.  I am 56 years old and my partner is 63.  We both loved this book and couldn't put it down  The book is full of adventure, fantasy, and the deep seated emotions of 'real' young people.  The heroine of The Hunger GAmes struggles with emotions of attachments to the people whom she loves.  She also has thoughts and discovers her need for ethical \\"rightness\\".  People of all ages, ethnicity, and gender would enjoy The Hunger Games.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|First, this is not for young readers!  I recommend it for middle aged women.  (We can appreciate it more) Of course, men could learn from it.  I love the characters.  Some women may not want this or criticize it by saying \\"yeah right\\".  C'mon, people, it's fiction!  Just enjoy it.  We can all dream.
0470474874|5.0|This is the most comprehensive, well written, and informative book on Excel 2010 I have seen.  If you can't find the topic in this book, Excel probably can't do it!
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|this game is worth having on any tablet and even the computer so you should definetly get this game and I think that if you had to pay to play this game I would pay a minimum of 5$
B004132I20|1.0|My low rating has nothing to do with the actual show but rather the fact that the Blu-ray is being sold in the US on Amazon.com without a warning.  My kids bought this for my for Mother's Day (their dad ordered it for them).  We settled down to watch only to discover that it won't play on our Blu-ray player.  My husband finally found out through some forums that Blu-rays in the UK are made using a different mega hertz (?) than those in the US and don't play on all Blu-ray players.  Huge disappointment, especially since we can't return it since it's been opened.  No watching Sherlock for me on Mother's Day as no store in our area carries the DVD.  I am so disappointed!
B007V2UGPE|5.0|excellent graphics and good design and terrific replay value. I have played through this game countless times. A absolute must have.
B004T5K3OK|5.0|Awesome! Great app for putting documents into PDF and having the ability to email.  Don't need to fax, or find a scanner.
1741797802|3.0|Ok, I like the presentation style of Lonely planet... they appear to be travel for real people... on real budgets.<br /><br /> I might be able to excuse the faults with the Lonely Planet Guide to India because the experience is so vast and so individual... I guess if there is a common fault, its an over emphasis on potential trouble and scams.  Yes they happen, but it really is not the major concern if you simply have solid street smarts...<br /><br />The Lonely Planet Guide to India just needs to take  down the fear factor a notch... or two or as a reader... heed the warnings but take some of it with a grain of salt.  Just be street smart...<br /><br />What works best is being a good and polite guest. You are not special just because you are a visitor.. In fact the worst trouble I had in India has been 2 arrogant Western travelers. Leave any attitudes at home.<br /><br />Also check out our DVDs on India Topics on Amazon<br />Visually and Respectfully Yours, the story of The Tibetan Photo Project<br />Voices in Exile<br />Save Tibet...Why?<br />India 101 - Hosted by Sazzy Varga [[ASIN:B006K4ZHVC India 101 hosted by Sazzy Varga]]
B007ZD17XO|5.0|I love this game and you have to be quick bacause your timed which makes it fun.its definately worth downloading.
B0060D0OWA|5.0|To begin with it's a great movie with lots of actions,and also some sense of humor.But mostly i was very greatfull<br /> the delivery was punctual,i received the package on time.I like speedy delivery and the package arrived in good<br />and perfect condition.Thank you,very much!!!!!.............
B0072GPQNG|5.0|I've seen the movie \\"War Horse\\" six times in the theater and several more times at home.  In short, I consider War Horse to be the best movie I've ever seen.  I'm a pushover for epic movies, period pieces, horses, good stories, great acting and great cinematography.  War Horse has them all, plus a very uplifting ending.  While War Horse was spectacular on the big screen, the video version loses nothing when viewed on the small screen.  War Horse should have been voted Best Picture at the Academy Awards, as it is the most moving film I have ever seen.  All movie lovers should have War Horse in their video collections.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I have fun playing. No problems at all so far. I play until my eyes hurt. Thanks for making it available on my kindle fire.
B002C6K7NA|4.0|This band was well over its heyday by the time I was old enough to appreciate music, so i learned of them thanks to the \\"classic rock\\" radio stations found all over the dial.  Many longtime fans may disagree, but I would rather listen to this album than hear one of their dinosaur tracks whcih have been played to death.  Many bands who are past their prime in sales are putting out albums which are comprable, or in the case of God & Guns, BETTER than what made them famous.  Clear the cobwebs in your ears and give this a listen.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I enjoy this game alot but wish there was an easier way to earn acorns without buying them.  It is addicting.
B007SGM084|4.0|Enjoyed the novels, great character development. I especially loved the ending with the look back section.... This book is definitely full of explicit scenes but not the worst I have read and they are well written.
B004SEUJYG|4.0|simple and sa·li·ent review. just saying.<br /><br />this is a ok transfer but i think if they would have gone in done some minor tweaks it would be amazing.  don't get me wrong it looks great for the age of them film but it's just a pet peeve of mine.  the movie is great and worth owning in your collections.  also this movie like many other Francis Ford Coppola films has a great commentary, he's only the writer on this but it's still very interesting.  that is all.
B000WAEJZ0|5.0|A great collection of all her best, the songs you want to sing along or dance to.  A wonderful CD of one of the most beautiful voices of all time.
B0048LPRD2|5.0|Noe's work is strongly visceral.  ETV is a story about death and birth, and about life close to the bone, gristle, and guts of existence.  By presenting the movie almost entirely from the main character's POV, Noe forces us to look long and hard at the scariest, most profound moments we can expect to experience in our lives.<br /><br />Spoilers:<br /><br />The death scene of Oscar is best watched in utter darkness and silence, and contemplating Oscar's dying mumbles as he attempts to make sense of what is happening is one of the more profound experiences I've ever had watching a film.  I have watched this about six times, and that scene never fails to leave a major impression on me.<br /><br />Along with Irreversible, ETV stands as part of a very unique body of filmmaking where story values are simple and direct, and the purpose of the medium is to  put us in the middle of life's most intense experiences.<br /><br />More of this, please, Mr. Noe.
B000002UDG|5.0|Great songs of a master.  Saw him in concert a year or so ago and started looking to replace some of my McCartney vinyl with CDs.  This is a must if you like McCartney
B007V2UGPE|5.0|I really enjoy this fine game.  why?  for crying out loud, you're a SAMURAI fighting ZOMBIES.  that's an awesome sounding game.  fun gameplay, cool abilities, good graphics, super fun.
