B005EWDAFQ|5.0|Behold all those gushing comments from about two dozen newspaper reviewers.  \\"Rivetting, his best yet\\" yadda blah blah.<br /><br />No.  It isn't his best.  I think I've read them all apart from Lustrum, and I think this is his worst.  Enigma's brilliant, Pompeii is totally gripping and educational too.  His best without a doubt is The Ghost Writer.  What I credit Robert Harris for above all, is that he doesn't stick to a formula.  He tries different things, and usually it comes off.  Compare with say Lee Child, who in many ways is a more polished thriller writer.  Child has been writing the same books for 20 iterations.  Harris is not like that at all.<br /><br />Having said that, if Harris can accomplish such great plotting and characters in the other books, what went wrong here?  Fear Index is an over-inflated short story.  The characterization and plot is adequate for a short story but not for a book of this length.  My paperback of 374 pages felt padded out.  Long sequences of repetitive description, pointless scenes - yet the characters still feel paper thin.  Very little happens in the first 200 pages.  It hots up around page 300, but that is too little, too late.  Also, fatally, the main character disappears for a long section in the middle.  This is fatal, as we cease to care about him.<br /><br />Compare with [[ASIN:B004E3XD9O The Ghost Writer: A Novel]].  The other book has a clever, intricate plot, developed characters, pace and above all does not waste page after page on pointless description.<br /><br />Compare also with [[ASIN:B008BUHC1Q The Machine (An Ethan Stone Thriller)]] - you will see the similarity in the basic premise if you read them both.  The Machine has fast pace, sparing but evocative description, narrative drive based on a single main character and a cast of different, fascinating characters.  It's gripping all the way through.<br /><br />I will still give Harris five stars because of the guy, and the writer, I know he is.  I have huge respect for the man.  But his next novel needs to be a whole lot better.
0525953728|5.0|book was pretty good considering i love books about the war. was nothing real<br />great but i still liked it good enough to give it 5 stars. didn't hardly<br />mention osama until the end of the book. if you were just wanting to read<br />about the raid that killed him all you have to read is the last few chapters<br />because thats the only time he talks about it. the rest of it was interesting<br />also though.
B007FRHZ4A|2.0|My son received 2 of these for his 5th birthday because they looked so cool!  We were so excited to dig into this game and play together but unfortunately the design of the blocks make it impossible to build the required configuration of pigs to fly the birds at.  My son still had fun making up some of his own rules because as a 5 year old, being creative is more fun.  If you could actually stack the blocks, even if he couldn't exicute the game exactly as intended it would be a lot of fun.  Unfortunately he destroyed the box upon opening and so I threw it away - now sits the game, untouched.  Very disappointed.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I have never read any book twice in my life except for this one.  The plot reads like Romeo and Juliet meets the movie True Romance.  It has been a few years since my college days but this book took me right back to those crazy days of young intense feelings.  I hope someone decides to option this book for a movie because I would stand in line for a ticket to this one.  I can't wait for Walking Disaster.
B00168HARG|5.0|Great tv series.I found the episode commentaries just as insightful and entertaining as the episodes themselves.The special features were very interesting.What went on behind the scenes in the gag real will make you laugh hard.Its very sad that the show ended on such a cliffhanger.One of the few shows I wish would return from the grave.
B006T3RM08|2.0|The Henge Dock I received has the same problem as many other reviews.<br /><br />When the trackpad is inserted, it will get stuck in the down-clicked state, which means you have to remove it and put it back in.  It will work for about 8 clicks before getting stuck again.<br /><br />When I finally broke down and e-mailed support, they e-mailed me a PDF document advising me to rub the inside edges of the trackpad tray with a hard tool.  The idea is that the sloppy mold lines left on the plastic will be removed or rubbed down, preventing the trackpad from getting trapped.  This works to a degree, but not very well.<br /><br />I really need to bust out my dremel and remove the extra plastic if I want to continue using it.  Which is pretty crazy.<br /><br />Henge Docks is very aware of this issue, so I'm really surprised that they're not taking steps to ensure new Cliques aren't shipping to customers in this condition.<br /><br />I'm not sure if it's the poor fit, or another issue entirely, but my trackpad will also randomly lose its bluetooth connection to my computer while in the Clique, and only while it's in the Clique.  I've checked to make sure the battery port is screwed all the way shut, but I suspect the plastic that contacts the trackpad power button is also made with a poor tolerance, and it's holding the power button in enough to cause it to turn on and off while I type or use the trackpad.<br /><br />As it ships, the Clique is worse than disappointing, it makes using your trackpad unreliable or at worst impossible.  There's no reason to ship them to customers with these defects.
B004J4WLB4|4.0|My book club picked this book, and for some reason I wasn't that excited about it. I thought it would be \\"flowery\\" (excuse the pun), for lack of a better word. Sappy, maybe? But I actually liked the book. It wasn't sappy at all, and the flower references were actually interesting. It was a nice story and an easy read.

0307949486|5.0|Am now reading \\"Into The Mirror\\" the Life & Times of Master Spy Robert Hansson. Haven't read Dragon yet but have read other works by Larsson and I will enjoy this title. I bought all three titles of the Millennium Trilogy from Amazon.com and am looking to buy another book really soon.
B006LSZECO|4.0|This novel takes many twists and turns that keep you guessing! The characters are fabulously written to keep you on the edge of your seat thinking that you can categorize them, but then surprising you all over again. This one truly kept me reading through the night; I just had to discover what happened!  I shy away from the 5 star rating simply because I so badly anticipated a different ending, though I think Gillian Flynn did a wonderful job with it and I can't wait to search for more of her novels.
B008MAI0WK|5.0|I got the kindle edition and so far I am not able to find any formatting errors. I would like to point out one error in \\"Flashing from OS X\\". On step 6 instead of dd if=imagefilename.img of=/dev/diskX bs=2M it should be  dd if=imagefilename.img of=/dev/diskX bs=2m. Notice the last argument where Big M should be replaced with small m for OS X because it carries the BSD heritage. I am not sure if there are any other errors but nothing critical that cannot be fixed with quick web search.<br /><br />Even though this is Raspberry Pi user guide, most of the things mentioned can also be applied to other Linux based OS because Raspberry Pi uses Debian which is based on Linux Kernel. This means we are also learning Linux utilities.<br />The writing is very clear and concise. Also, all the information in the book can be found online with web search but it is always handy to have a reference available in one place. Granted I have not read the whole book but it seems to be an excellent companion to your Raspberry pi. I am even thinking about buying the physical book.

B000002MVT|5.0|ZZTop have been around since the late 60's, back then they played their own Texas Blues sound loud and proud. The \\"Tres Hombres\\",Billy, Dusty and Frank have put their own spin on the blues, take equal parts Tex-Mex, Rock & Roll, Hillbilly, Jazz and country, put it in the \\"Recycler\\" on high and out comes true \\"Rio Grande Mud\\". High quality Texas Blues.<br /><br />The Band chose 17 classic blues cuts from their First Album, Rio Grande Mud, Tres Hombres, Deguello, El Loco, Eliminator and Recycler Albums. As usual the coolest trio on the planet has put together a righteous and timeless masterpiece.<br /><br />\\"The blues has got a hold of me, I believe I'm getting dizzy.\\"
006197806X|5.0|I have never been so inspired and heart broken by the ending of a book. Seriously. Why can't main characters ever be happy for more than five minutes? I've started to dread the ending of books in a series because I know that sometime awful is going to happen RIGHT at the end.<br /><br />That being said, this book is gorgeous. If Delirium pushed the limits of dystopia when it created the slightly stereotypical us versus them trope but it went horribly wrong, this took that stereotype, ripped it in half, and shoved it down the garbage disposal. The main character is a complete survivor, doing anything (often things I am repulsed or sickened by) to stay alive and free ON HER OWN TERMS.<br /><br />Maybe that's why I like it so much. It isn't just that she escapes the government to seek freedom; she runs away from anyone who tries to tell her how to live her life or to change her. She refuses to give up her agency to ANYONE, not even the people who are supposedly \\"free\\". It's hard for me to respect a main character as much as I respect Lena.<br /><br />Of course there's angsty romance, but in a way I find rather beautiful. It's not, \\"and then we spent three days together and now we are in love!\\" More like, \\"We shared an extremely traumatic experience that created a link between us, and somewhere along that link I could see us falling in love.\\" Really beautiful, and very realistic.<br /><br />I have serious respect for Oliver. Even if I hate her and want to shake her and beg her WHY DID SHE DO THIS TO LENA WHY ISN'T THE NEXT BOOK OUT HOLY GOD. So much respect. And loathing. And adoration.

B0089BSM70|4.0|Well, I bought the 30th AE from Universal last fall, only to find a lackluster release. The box said perfect picture and purest digital sound available, but that sadly was not the case. The picture was in much need of a full restoration and the audio was merely 5.1 processed (whatever that is) dts. Extras included a few deleted scenes (in 4:3), alternate ending and the boring \\"Terror in the Ailses\\" (nothing more than a long advertisement for Universal' horror films) theatrically released in '84. Not very impressive extras for a 30th anniversary edition.Thought this was to be the best edition available for some time.<br /> Well, I happily was wrong thanks to Shout! Factory. One year later comes the collector's edition. And the question is how does it fare in comparison to the previous blu ray release. Let's start with PQ. It is only slightly better, yet still in need of a full restoration. The scene where Jimmy checks on Laurie to find her unresponsive still looks awful (washed out with bad blacks) along with a lot of other night scenes but other, brighter scenes look slightly improved with good color, contrast, and clarity. The AQ is improved with better bass and clearer dialogue in DTS HD MA.<br />  Now for the extras which are better. The making of doc is cool just wish it had been a little longer and more in depth, original shooting locations seg was funny and slightly interesting, it has deleted scenes/alternate ending (in 4:3) from the 30th AE, but now with director commentary, it has 2 commentaries. One with the director and one with the stuntman who played The Shape. It has tv spots, radio spots, trailer, photo gallery and to top this release off it has the tv version with added footage (namely the deleted scenes/alternate ending) albeit in 4:3, mono, and is not blu ray but a bonus DVD. It's interesting but scenes are in a different order which makes it a little confusing. It would have been really cool if they had done a director cut with the added footage inserted into the theatrical cut but since the added footage seems to only be in 4:3 it wouldn't work.<br />  All in all, it is a better edition. It is worth the upgrade for fans who love this (the best sequel) and are into extras and improved sound as well as a slightly better picture. Moustapha Akkad's name is there at the opening credits. Until a frame by frame restoration from original negatives and audio track, this is the best it will sound and look. This is the only blu ray presentation that should have been released, forget the 30th AE from Universal. It was simply a mediocre cash grab.nserted into the theatrical cut but since the added footage seems to only be in 4:3 it wouldn't work.<br />  All in all, it is a better edition.

B0096MM9GG|5.0|I remember playing the original in the 90's. This is the same game but with updated graphics. It run smoothly on Kindle Fire HD. The lack of physical keyboard means controlbis using on-screen virtual D-pad, crouch, run and attack buttons. Takes a little getting used to, but not unplayable. Thanfully, these virtual D-pad is not position-locked and can be freely relocated to any desired location.<br /><br />Thanks for the memories, Ubisoft.

B006VA3ZEG|5.0|So thankful for Amazon Prime this morning. I got hooked on Downton Abbey having watched the first season on Netflix on demand, but they only have the first season! For lovers of costume drama like us, we now have a reason to stay in on Friday nights and spend a little time peering in on the inner workings of an English manor home and the English aristocracy as they were coming to an end. Downton Abbey is nearly flawless as it portrays with deft subtlety the changes that we all know are coming in terms of class, gender equality, technology, etc. Watching a slice of how things used to be is a delicious indulgence that we are so looking forward to!
0316017930|2.0|This book seems to me like a direct ripoff of the idea of Freakonomics.  The only difference is that it's not as interesting.  The book is supposed to be about identifying what creates success.  The author sets out to prove that most traits of a successful person are not of their own doing but of cultural or lucky circumstances.  The only point that I really like is the 10,000 hour rule which basically states that you can be an expert in something if you practice it for 10,000 hours.<br /><br />Overall I don't find this book actionable in any way and throughout reading it found myself asking \\"what the heck am I getting from this.\\"  I don't recommend.<br /><br />2 Out of 5 Stars

B000NQRE9Q|2.0|Yes, it's finally out!! Been waiting so long! But... Not sure if everyone else is oblivious to the risk of this collection but read on...<br /><br />What is seriously going on with the execs who make the decisions for these long awaited collections? Is it a conspiracy for companies to give us bad packaging in hopes we ruin the product in hopes we buy it again after we ruin them over a long period? I'm not a movie troller who hates movies and Indiana Jones is one of the greatest franchises ever, I'm just fed up with these horrible packaging ideas.  Basically the Indiana Jones Adventures is in identical packaging to the Clint Eastwood collection which was one of the worst packaging ideas ever. Here's the main issue, these treasured movies are stuffed in between two pieces of hard abrasive cardboard. In order to pull a movie out, you have to grab both sides of the disc right near the edge, immediately putting finger prints on the information side of the disc. Not to mention pulling it out on the bare cardboard as it's packed in so tight.  Do this over a period of time, you're asking for trouble. Even trouble, i noticed a tiny 2cm scratch on Raiders the FIRST time I pulled it out from rubbing against the cardboard. Mind you, these blu ray discs can withstand scratches, but how much and for how long do you want to chance it?  It's packed in so tight, it's just bound to happen when one day you're gonna freeze up thanks to a nice scratch from your case. IF you buy this collection which I still say you should, just take them out safely as you can and store them in a regular DVD Case. A major pain and yes, the case is basically worthless and nice to look at, but don't risk it if you want to savior this collection that is wonderful if you can salvage it before ruining it. Some people have said squeeze the cardboard to loosen and wait for it to fall out, I did try this on Raiders and temple and the disc did not move<br /><br />If you want to know about the movies, on how they look, I actually think the older movies look even better than Skulls. Obviously the first 3 classics got the most love. Skulls is inferior, so we know why though. The extras are great, a nice documentary of watching Raiders with lots of deleted scenes and lost footage is an amazing find. Bonus materials are amazing! Just be really careful taking these movies out of the cases. Feel free to use Crystal Skulls as a coffee cup holder. ;)look, I actually think the older movies look even better than Skulls.

B007UPNA6Y|4.0|I thought Lee Childs was going the way of many of the other writers in this field, I know the word genre but it sounds too pretentious for mois. His last couple of books were predictable and I was thinking he was getting to the pap stage and just churning stuff out for his faithfull followers. This was his last chance with me and if this one was ordinary like the past couple I was going to kick him to the kerb. He has redeemed himself and is back on track with his latest effort, which had me reading it from cover to cover in one sitting. Good one Lee!

1577311523|1.0|The Author tries to use Buddhist / Zen fundamentals but yet never truly acknowledges that or gives any credit to anyone but himself.  He always tries to say things that the reader would like to read.  He tries to give advise and 'teach' psychology which are way beyond his expertise -- because he is not a psychologist !!  I think the problem is celebrities like Oprah highly 'boost' books / authors such as him b/c they themselves like these sort of 'feel good' types of books.  But in the end it's readers such as us who end up absorbing all this nonsense.

B007VYQ9G2|5.0|The film making is beautiful, the point of time they captured was incredible (and very lucky).  It's just an amazing piece of work.  Like most documentaries, it feels a little short.  That is probably due to the fact that it's so good that we could watch another hour or two without any problem.  But that hour might not be as cohesive as this is.  If you like documentaries, especially ones about nature, then I highly recommend Chimpanzee.  If you're on the fence, rent before buying to see if the subject that you'll revisit.  It's a wonderful film but some people don't like to re-watch documentaries.  That's fine, but do see this stunning film.
B002VPE1AW|5.0|Good movie, great acting, nice graphics. I enjoyed it a lot. It may drag on a little,  but nonetheless,  it is a good film.
B0098VXE50|3.0|As much as I love the whole bad-ass Snow White approach, there was little done in the script to make her seem believable as a virginal, beautiful and innocent Snow White. So with the small amount of character development seen on the screen, it is really unimpressive when she decides to adorn herself with armor and fight the extremely believable and excellently portrayed Evil Queen. Perhaps the director and writers depended too heavily upon the audience's knowledge of this fairy tale and therefore chose to develop the often unseen evil characters, such as the dark forest, troll, Queen and her army so even when good wins in the end, you are left with only the dark imagery and a new-found respect for the queen rather than a love for good and Snow White.  At the same time, I applaud their respect for the fable and that although they alluded to a love affair between SW and the Huntsman, it leaves it to your imagination on the ending and doesn't upset true fans of the SW storyline who don't want to see any extreme storyline changes.  Another excellent and overlooked aspect of the film is the incredible CG work in the fairy garden, and on the dwarfs.<br /><br />Additionally I thought it worth noting that the casting of Kristen Stewart did little to add or detract from the movie as she really is a sub-sub-character. So those of you avoiding the film to stand by your Pro-Rob Pattinson or Anti-Twilight feelings will be fine to see this.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Great read and this book kept my attention from the first page.  I literally could not put this book down.  You become very engrossed with the two main characters.  However, the ending left me somewhat 'empty'.  I am hoping for a sequel.
B0074D3CAQ|3.0|I enjoyed this book very much throughout until approximately the last 3 chapters.  It was interesting--the character of Harold Fry increasingly so.  It was obvious, from the gentle handling by the author, that it would have an uplifting ending, but unfortunately, she succumbed to a bit of treacle at the end, which marred the overall effect of Harold's learning experience.  I am sure that many people will enjoy this book, and it is a nice light read with some deeper understanding of the human coil.  Unfortunately, it didn't go deep enough for me.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I would not recommend this read to anyone under 16. The reason is the violence, underage drinking and gambling. These are very serious issues that younger children simply don't need to idealize.<br /><br />That being said -as a 37 year old woman - I very much enjoyed Abby \\"Pigeon/Pidge\\" & Travis's story!! Pigeon, Pidge, my heart smiled every time he called her by the pet name! I'm now pinning all things Travis and/or Pidge that I have stumbled across. It was a wild whirl-wind of ups & downs, and back & forths. The story kept me so wrapped up in it for an entire day, enough that I was able to completely forget my woes for the day & THAT was much needed! My beautiful distraction. I'm confident enough to say that when I need another day like that, I'll read it again! I loved the love, the angst, the fights, the adventures -it was all the elements of a great story!

B005LAIHSQ|2.0|Simply put, the movie is decent, Kristen Stewart is just as annoying and emotionless as ever, and the films dialog sound level is so poor you have to crank the volume to hear it just to turn it down not to be over powered by action scenes. Rent it, do not buy it.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|As a former special operator, I was interested in how the subject and book would deal with a very delicate situation.  I was impressed with the sensitivity of the author to be sure to protect those who continue to serve our country and place themselves in harms way each day.  The book brought back fond memories of times with some very professional and special men and women.  I enjoyed the read.  It was written well and was able to keep me captivated.  A job well done.
B00005JLEU|3.0|I've bought DVDs from ebay before and received lots of bootlegs (illegal copies), so I can spot bootlegs somewhat well. And I was very, very surprised to find out that a DVD from Amazon could be a bootleg. I filed a claim and returned this DVD.<br /><br />The movie itself is great; I've seen it a long time a go and wanted to have a copy, legitimate copy, for my collection. But this DVD is a bootleg copy. Here is why:<br />1. The plastic wrapping stuck to the DVD case -- unprofessional<br />2. The cover is not as vivid and detailed and does not match up to the images online -- this a bit harder to tell<br />3. The disc, on the back side, bears the name of the film. Legitimate DVDs usually has a bar code and a serial.<br />4. REAL DVDs will have commercials and advertisements and self-endorsements. This copy DVD goes straight to the movie.<br />Plus, I'm willing to bet that the real DVD will play smoother and have higher quality.<br /><br />This may not be the fault of the seller, but just beware. Stick to Amazon's store if you care about these things. $20 some bucks for a bootleg is a big ripoff by the way.
B008UTV6S8|5.0|Here is Paul Simon, at 70, making music that is as vital and original as anything he did with Art Garfunkel or in his early solo albums. In performance, the energy astonishes. As does his sense of fun. He clearly loves being up there.<br /><br />The Stones may fill stadiums, but they're an oldies band now. Paul McCartney tries, but misses. Of the giants of this generation, only Simon and Dylan and Neil Young and the younger kid, Bruce Springsteen, have angels on their shoulders.<br /><br />But it's bigger than that for me, much bigger. A guru I'm fond of says that when you aim for the highest things, only the highest things happen. I'm quite sure Paul Simon believes that his competition isn't Mick or Bruce or Bob --- it's something far off, and you can never get there, but dammit, you can try.<br /><br />There's alchemy in that effort. You reach and reach, your arms grow longer. You look inside, eventually your heart pumps gold. Years and years later, your good habits manifest in the form of love, enthusiasm --- and good work.<br /><br />This is a romantic view? No fooling. But consider the choice, which Simon thoughtfully distills into a phrase: So beautiful...or so what? Then watch and listen: the accomplished writer, consummate performer, pristine band. Consider the quality of the production and the filming. A lot of people involved with this project didn't bet on \\"so what.\\"<br /><br />\\"Live in New York City\\" is a master class in creativity and beauty. There can never be enough.

0307949508|5.0|The Girl Who Played With Fire, part two of the Millennium trilogy has, in common with The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, a bewildering array of secondary characters.  In my review of that book I praised the strength of the characterisation of Lisbeth Salander.  But by the end of book two, the once vulnerable (and compelling) Salander has turned into a creature resembling a cyborg - with superhuman strengths and an IQ capable of solving Fermat's Last Theorem.  As one commentator puts it on [...], \\"Larsson could have unwittingly done (Salander) a disservice by making her almost invincible, which makes readers unable to relate to her in the end.\\"<br /><br />Stieg Larsson was a flawed genius.  Sometimes he goes off on a tangent and perhaps the biggest tangent of all in this book is Lisbeth's idea of light reading - the invented non-fiction book, Dimensions in Mathematics.  Larsson got away with it as this is the middle book of the series and if, like me, all you want to find out about is what happens to Salander, you can easily skip it.  I can just imagine what would have happened to this manuscript if the maths bit had been  in the first book; ending up in the agent's slush pile faster than you could say, \\"next.\\" But I admire Larsson for including it - the only way you learn as a novelist (or in any other profession for matter) is to try out what works and what doesn't and it would be a dull old world if we played it safe all the time.<br /><br />Instead of restricting the points of view to just Salander and Blomkvist, as he does in the first, Larsson can't resist getting into the minds of a number of the villains - although in one particular case, it's a waste of time as there doesn't seem to be much going on in the head of one of them who comes across more like a cartoon villain than a real person.<br /><br />The strength of the second book was the tight plotting and the way that everything planted at the beginning paid off in the end.  That is, no doubt to Larsson's journalistic training and is a good lesson for anyone in the process of writing a book series.  He wrote a detailed synopsis of all of these books before he began to write so would have worked out what happened when and in which book, in the same way that a complicated plot of a TV series is storylined.<br />Despite the flaws, it was the twists and turns that had me sucked in and I read the last 200 pages almost in one sitting.  Yet again, Larsson delivers.is a good lesson for anyone in the process of writing a book series.

B007PT3QOQ|5.0|If you can come back to the game several times a day, and are patient, this is a very addicting game. You only get a small amount of energy to use to complete actions around your town and once they're gone, you either have to buy more with real money or wait for the energy meter to refill one bar every three minutes. If you put the Kindle down and walk away, you will be alerted when your energy meter is full again. So far, I haven't had to spend any real money in this game because I'm patient- clearly some of the other reviewers are not! I have been at this game for about 4 months and bought every available piece of land (no easy feat, mind you!), I've got to level 101 (the game used to top out at level 100 so I was stuck there for QUITE a while before they updated it to go further), and have filled every available inch of my city with houses, businesses, landscaping, and decorations (like flowers or planters or fences)- all without spending a red cent! DO NOT LET THE OTHER REVIEWS DETER YOU IF YOU HAVE ANY PATIENCE! I've never had any major issues, only a few minor ones that they always address with an update. This is a thoroughly addictive game and you won't be disappointed sif you have determination not to spend any money on the game and can wait for energy to refill on it's own.<br />P.S. on a side note- this game works whether you have Internet connection or not. Obviously you'd need a connection to download the game but you can play it every day without a connection. There's been times where I don't have any Internet and my son can't play some of his games on the Kindle because of it, but I can still play mine. You just need to connect every now and then for updates (not more than once a month).

Because of this one it has made me causious about downloading any others. I don't mind paying for apps, but what happens if I don't like it or it doesn't work like I had hoped. Is there a way to get a refund from Amazon? I need to do some research on that. Will not purchase any apps until I find that answer.

0525952926|5.0|There were only 939 extraordinary pages.<br />  I found it exciting, informative and way too short.<br /><br />  The book arrived on the 12th. Unfortunately, I couldn't start it until I found out Who-Done-It, so I read fast and finished on the 13th ...<br /><br />Today, I finished reading 'Winter' and have now begun the long wait for volume three. Sir, it is okay if the next book is 2000 pages long, I will not mind the exercise.<br /><br />  Thinking about it, these books have taken so-o much research! I do not want to delay the completion of Volume Three: it's just that ... I'm sure Mr Follett has thumbnail histories of all of his characters along with a great many words disallowed by the publisher ... wouldn't it be great to read 200 - 300 pages about Ava, or Teresa, or the Rothmann's?<br />  I noticed a missing bit though: computers actually happened before WWII, but weren't really mentioned in 'Winter'. Hulking, great processers of data that will need a couple pages in book three, even if it's just mentioning computer users, hackers and gamers.<br />  As a fan, I am truly grateful for the hours of enjoyment Mr Follett has given the world.

1400069289|5.0|I'm interested in how our brains work, and also in improving my own skills and traits through that kind of knowledge.<br /><br />For me to enjoy a book of this type, it shouold have (1) some compelling stories to help \\"personalize\\" and cause us to emotionally connect with the subject; (2) clear prose that clarifies research and science undergirding the premise(s);(3) it should have good links both to the sources it draws from and research in the area in case I want to go further in a particular area. The Power of Habit fulfills my criteria in all respects.<br /><br />Cravings are created. A habit is loop of a cue (stimulus), a routine in response to the stimulus (act), and a reward. One interesting point I hadn't thought about is that we cannot change a habit. We have to replace the habit with another habit. (Something very interesting for me to learn at the age of sixty.) The notes in the book at the close are extensive and geared to help the casual user to find access to the basic research. An aspect of the thoroughness of the documentation is they comprise about roughly a quarter of the book.<br /><br />While I was certainly familiar with the habits for individuals, I had never considered that there could be organizational and enen cultural habits. Then the author leads into marketing annecdotes to illustrate how all this works in our culture -- for example, the story of the product \\"Fabreeze\\". While interesting, I freely admit I worry about too much sophisticated and manipulative marketing techniques as a driver in our consumerist culture, and the consequences for us all.<br /><br />Interestingly, while I usually try to read books like this straight through or at most in two or three evenings, this book is so user-friendly in its organization that it's easy to read one or two of its nine chapters at a time, and maintain the lucid progression of Mr. Duhigg's thoughts and examples.<br /><br />I'm confident that the knowledge of how these processes work can help mechange some of my own habits that need changing.<br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.
B0053O89WY|3.0|Over the past 2 years I have loved The Big Bang Theory, I currently own seasons 1-4 on DVD which were great (season 4 has its problems) but I have followed the show since I began watching it. Seasons 1-3 were probably one of the funniest episodes of the Big Bang Theory because the jokes were fresh, the characters were great the writing was clever and overall the show was original. I loved the dynamics of all the characters of these grown nerds that are intellectually gifted but socially disabled associating themeselves with a normal beautiful girl that is struggling to get by. What made the show so great in the first place was that it showed how opposites attract, a group of \\"nerds\\" are able to co-exist with a beautiful girl that under any other circumstance would have nothing to do with these kind of guys. I loved the show up until season 4, the formula that made it great, just took a dramatic shift, all of the characters changed with a couple of exceptions. The addition of Amy and Bernadette was okay in the beginning, mainly because it gave the characters of Sheldon and Howard more humanity having relations with a female comapanion which was a nice balance to the Leonard/Penny dynamic. I actually liked Amy and Bernadette in the beginnig, Amy is a female Sheldon which is a nice twist, and Bernadette is a sexy petite woman whose appeal is her bubbly personality. But once these female character became a part of the permanent cast, it turned out to be the biggest downfall to the show as a whole<br /><br />When I was watching season 5's episodes, I just realized that we barely have moments where it's just the 4 guys (Sheldon/Leonard/Howard/Raj). Thats what annoyed me the most because the female dynamics were added to evolve the characters, but what it did was actually kill their personalities. Howard's charm completely dissolved this season, because his character has changed from the guy that hit on every woman possible, to being stuck to one woman which is Bernadette (I can't blame him though). Ultimately Howards character just isn't funny to me anymore, he may have his moments but his characters runs dry for me. Amy's character is also another character I have a problem with. In the beginning she is introduced as the female Sheldon, a genius whose wit and misunderstanding of human behavior matches Sheldon perfectly, but in this season, she is just the most annoying character in the show, I'm sorry to all the Amy fans but she gets on my last nerves. She tries too hard to fit in to the point that I don't even feel sorry that she is incapable of doing so, she has a relationship with Sheldon however she has an ambiguous fatal attraction towards Penny that was funny in Season 4, but now is just creepy. There is practially no bromance of Howard and Raj anymore which is what I actually missed the most, I missed the interactions between them which is almost non-existant in this season. Raj is also a character that is underused in the series, and ever since the arrival of Bernadette and Amy, his character in the show has bcome useless.<br /><br />Sheldon is my personal favorite since the beginning seasons. Jim Parson's ability to recite extremely long dialogues with such agility and comedic timing is a true talent. His personality was a fresh of breath air when the show began, but something just clicked in my head that changed my perception of Sheldon's character this season. Sheldon was always known as the repulsive character whose too smart for his own good, which hasn't changed in Season 5, and that is precisely the problem. I guess after 4 seasons of Sheldon, I have met my ends meet with the character at this point. You would think Sheldon would have progressed and adjusted a little bit after having a girlfriend and befriending Penny for awhile now, but thats just not the case and I think thats the most frustrating thing. After watching this season, I think I am now fed up with the show, there's just nothing original or exciting about the show anymore. Sure it has it's funny moments here and there but it just wasn't what it used to be. I can tell that some of the storylines are forced and the writing has become stale. And maybe its just me, but I even noticed that some of the actors are starting to look disinterested during the show especially Johnny Galecki (Leonard), he's not as energetic as he used to be and his delivery lacks the urgency he once had in earlier seasons. The Big Bang Theory was once my favorite show, but I guess I have outgrowned it. If you're still a fan of the Big Bang Theory then by all means pick this DVD up, but as for me I'm returning this DVD to Target and I might just give up on the show all together. I have moved on to \\"Community\\" (THE funniest show on television)ut the show anymore. Sure it has it's funny moments here and there but it just wasn't what it used to be.

0316066524|5.0|Everywhere I went while reading this, people would ask me,\\"Oh, what is that book about?\\" and I would say \\"A tennis academy, a halfway house, and addictions of all kind.\\" I still do not have a better description. Whether someone loved it or hated it, they cannot describe this book, it is just too epic. That being said, it was immensely entertaining and wholly readable, in my opinion. After getting in the rhythm of the run-on sentences and the constant checking of footnotes, I had a fairly easy-going time. I was actually sad and drained after finishing Infinite Jest. I would love to read it again, but it is just too much of a time investment!<br /><br />PS this book contains the best description of Alcoholics Anonymous I have ever read. The stream-of-consciousness passage narrated by Don G perfectly describes the process/feeling of rock-bottom and total powerlessness.

If you're familiar with that case, it'll be a treat when you read this book.

B0053JJLLC|1.0|I've seen a few reviews on here that imply that the reader \\"outgrew\\" the writer and other ridiculous statements; this book clearly had a minimal ratio of Crichton's work compared to Mr. Preston and who knows how many countless editors along the way.  This simply isn't a Crichton book.  Crichton's writing was at once detailed and complex, but able to keep the reader flowing through the concepts regardless of how difficult the topical material could be; this book suffers immeasurably from nothing more than either entry-level writing or horrendous editing.<br /><br />The book reads much like this.  The book reads like a bad book.  And the book starts most of the sentences with And or But or Then.  Then the book stops the plot to explain that a character is in the book because of their Passion for Robots.  And for Technology.  And they are not a nice character.  And they did some very bad things.  Then they killed someone.  But we can't say who.  Not yet but we will.<br /><br />It doesn't read like a children's book, it reads like it was written by a child.<br /><br />If I could be at all compassionate, I could speculate that much of the material is indeed Crichton's -- but a very early draft, when he was still sketching out the characters, the progress of the plot, the scenery and scenarios; constant sentence fragments and dangling participles are indicative of a rough draft.  If this is the case, then micro is an even greater injustice to Crichton's body of work, as he clearly would not have exposed such coarse-hewn pages to the world before he had re-crafted them expertly.

B007GCY8FS|2.0|Lee Child is one of my favorite writers and I've read all of his books.  I was lucky enough to be in Europe in late August when A Wanted Man was released in a special promotion with WH Smith and paid a premium for the book because I couldn't wait to read it. I am very disappointed with the book and was so bored with the tedious plot that I left the last 100 pages unread -- something that has never happened with any of his other books.  As another reviewer mentioned, I was also wondering if he actually wrote it.  He has a signature writing style and phrasology that seems to be missing in this book.  I hope this book was just an anomoly.

I have started it again yesterday and I am going to force myself to stick to it!  I am eating 1500 calories a day and going to take Sundays off from exercise.  October 17 will be 30 days so I will let you know how it worked.  After yesterdays exercise of Level 1, all of my muscles are sore this morning.  I need to lose about 20 lbs.  I do love this DVD because I get cardio plus toning.  It definitely kicks my butt.  I am weak and nauseous afterwards,lol, but Im sure that will go away when I get used to it.

B008XG1X18|4.0|My only problem with this app is that it will force close when you first open it.  It's usually fine after that though.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|This is a great puzzle game! Very well done. The music is amazing and the graphics don't breed to be super fancy to make this game great.
B002L9PQGG|5.0|My friend showed me \\"Home\\" one day and I loved the band ever since. Support these guys, they really are the best, light-hearted people. You can feel the love they have for each other!!
B0096DFBZQ|1.0|The game looks good, but the controls do not work well. This is a limited version of the game I wouldn't waste your time.
B0096DFBZQ|1.0|this is a demo and it shows. 1 character, 1 track and upsell to full game at every turn. Its bad even by demo standards. And the controls are bad
B0011ZVTEO|5.0|I just watched the movie and and upon telling a friend, learned that there was and album!  I took a shot and it was money well spent.  The music is very lively, great beat, and has raised my interest in Cuban music, big time!  Well worth the investment.  Lastly, it was so great I have since purchased their Live In Carnegie Hall, album.  It too, is great!!!!
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Great book. Since I am a Navy family, I found it even more interesting than would a non-military family, perhaps. I do not believe any \\"secrets\\" were revealed, but I do think it sets the record straight on a lot of the mission. Obama may have participated in giving the order, but he certainly can't take all of the credit. Go Navy!
B008Y1RTUG|5.0|I think people are rating this movie based on the affair between Kristen and Rupert. That is stupid. People in Hollywood cheat on each other all the time. It's the norm. Kristen Stewart is still a great actora dn she is human. Robert P. obviously sees that too.<br /><br />So lets talk about the movie and less about stupid drama. The movie had great visual and the actors were great. The costumes were great. The story was good. Some people think the story was not solid. If you know the story of Snow White then you would know it was pretty darn close. The original story by the brothers grimm was a bit longer and had different scenerios. I hope they do a sequel being that it looks like it needs one. It had a lot of cool effects and it was very artsy. Very well put together in a cool way.
B005LAIHY0|4.0|One thing people need to clearly understand about this film is that Ridley Scott has stated on several occasions that this is not a prequel to Alien. It does hint at several points through out the movie (ending mostly) things that might tie into the movie Alien, but it is a completely different storyline. I personally watch the film with low expectations (which is what I would recommend for some). Some people will quite frankly hate this movie. I am a huge fan of the first 2 Alien films; the others clearly should have never been made. Ridley Scott is a brilliant imaginative person, with the film Prometheus you see stunning landscapes, which will set a perfect stage for an alien world. The futuristic technology is very believable and alone makes the movie worth watching. The dark-grim feel of the movie reminds me very much of the film Alien and delivers the same suspenseful feel that Alien brought. The actors and actresses are brilliant and are clearly the strong point of the movie. Several people may be bothered by some of the characters behavior, but this is a movie (and yes people do stupid things in movies). Over all the performances are very well done.<br />I would say the weaker points of the movie are parts of the storyline. Some people may be bothered by the idea that we came to existence because of an alien race. Once you get past this idea and the except that it is clearly a science fiction movie the film can be quite enjoyable. I find the new alien characters very fascinating and by the end of the film I want to know more about them. As said before it's a new storyline, don't be upset that we didn't get all the questions answered we had about the movie Alien. After all what makes a good sci-fi movie is the unknown, and of course always leaves us with wanting more and we will probably know more in the 2nd Prometheus film. I give Prometheus 3 out of 4 stars.
B006O7XOOW|4.0|My 10-month-old enjoys this toy for short spans of time.  The different balls are stacked on top and with a whirl of a little wheel, the music starts to play and the center platform rises up so that the balls tumble down the legs, falling down different obstacles to the bottom.  More often than not, at least one of the balls bounces away and sometimes I have to retrieve them from under the furniture.  The baby caught on to the mechanics quickly and she likes turning the wheel to hear the music, but since it doesn't have as much variety as some of her other toys, she gets bored with it after a short time.<br /><br />It has helped her motor skills as she has learned to bend over while standing and pick up the balls to place them back on top, and that is a useful skill.  It was very easy to assemble and seems pretty darn sturdy.  She has fallen against it many times and it has not fallen over.  It is easy to clean and the music isn't entirely obnoxious (a big consideration in these toys).

The quality audio is amazing from the sound of an open wound to the clash of the swords. a must have BD. 100% recommendable.<br />Nice package  fast delivery easy way to pull the BDs out, no scratches and a beautiful artwork inside in a book shape.
0385344333|5.0|Jack Reacher master of inductive reasoning.<br />I thoroughly enjoyed Lee Child's new novel A Wanted Man.  This is not a typical Jack Reacher action thriller but rather an excellent story of inductive reasoning, of which Jack Reacher is a consummate master.  From the very beginning when Reacher is standing alone on the side of the highway thumbing a ride and a car stops to offer him a ride, he begins to induce from the car and its occupants who they were, what they were doing and where they were going.  He takes the smallest incident and slowly builds on the true reality of his situation:  And off we go on yet another Reacher adventure.  This is a cerebral read until the last 50 pages when action explodes to a climatic finish.  Things are not OK in the hinterland of America but fortunately Reacher is on the case to set things right.<br />I liked this story a great deal.  I was constantly reminded of my favorite detective Harry Bosch as I read A Wanted Man and followed Reacher as he slowly, very slowly at times, figured out the \\"rest of the story\\".  It is amazing how Mr. Child can build on the insignificant as he weaves a terrific story.  Using inductive reasoning Reacher was able to eventually put it all together with an explosive conclusion.<br />Character development was superb.  Slowly but surely each Reacher story reveals a few more esoteric facts about solitary Jack Reacher.  I always like how Mr. Child introduces a female counter to Reacher to keep him honest.  Reacher is a rough man who stands ready to do violence in the name of justice:  In A Wanted Man he metes out a lot of justice.<br />No gratuitous sex, language or violence.  Just good writing.<br />Strong recommend.  Excellent for that long interminable plane ride to wherever.  Well done Mr. Child.  Looking forward to the next Reacher adventure.<br />NOTE:  Little 5'7\\" Tommy Cruise as 6' 5\\" Jack Reacher stretches the credulity of a rational mind!  Liam Neeson, Adam Baldwin, or Steven Seagal, would havebeen a better fit.
0345536886|5.0|I have read almost all of John Grisham's books and I found this one to be the most entertaining, the character development was exceptional.
B0009U55SI|5.0|Genuinely amazing both sonically and performance-wise.<br /><br />Reference System:  OPPO 95 (with SACD), Counterpoint 3000 Preamp, 2200 Amp, Thiel 3.5 speakers.<br /><br />With a library over several thousand CD's & DvD's this stands out as among the finest sounding and enjoyable performances.  As many have said about these older living stereo recordings reissued and remastered in hybrid SACD, just wow; could have been recorded today in state of the art venues using such equipment.  On many levels it's even better than that; how naturally analogue sounding and detailed the music is.<br /><br />This particular CD is a must have for any who enjoy great classical music and appreciate excellent sound reproduction.
B004G6009K|2.0|No complaints about the movie itself as it was for my daughter, but this is about the 5th 3D blu-ray I've gotten through Amazon that chapters of my BRAND NEW FRESH OUT OF THE WRAPPER blu-ray skips or freezes causing us to miss between 5-10 minutes of the whole movie.  This was a poor attempt at 3D by disney (as are many I'm finding regardless of producer)that there might be 1 or 2 points where the 3D actually works and they are quite intentional such as a spear pointing straight at you.  I guess I expected movies to be much better at this point, 2 years + out from Avatar (blue people, not the awful movie version of the cartoon from Nickelodean), but not many movies have made the effort.  I'm still buying 3D movies sporadically if it is a movie I want to keep regardless if 3D works or not, but I would by alot more 3D blu-ray if they would make an effort to create a true 3D experience.
0670023329|5.0|If you are like me who was not aware of the full extent of the brutal regime of North Korea, you are in for the shock of your life! This book is a narrative about Shin who was born and raised in one of the worst concentration camps in the world, the concentration camp in North Korea known as camp 14. The prisoners in this camp are beaten and tortured routinely.  He saw a camp guard beat his classmate to death for stealing five kernels of corn because she was hungry.  Shin is the first person (and I pray not the last) to escape from North Korea's camp 14.<br /><br />According to South Korean's intelligence agency and human rights groups, there are six concentration camps in North Korea. The biggest is the same size as Los Angeles. Electric barbed wired fence and armed guard encircle most of these camps. Two of these camps, 15&18 have reduction zones where those fortunate in the camp are indoctrinated in the teachings of their leaders Kim Jung Il and Kim Il Sung. If they are good learners and can convince the guards of their loyalty, they are released but monitored for the rest of their lives. The remaining camps are called \\"complete control districts\\" where prisoners classified as \\"iredeemables\\" are kept and never released. They are worked to death.<br /><br />Shin's camp 14 is a complete control district. Shin was born a slave and raised behind the barbed wired fence of camp 14 all because his blood was tainted by perceived crimes of his father's brothers. Thus, he lived below the law.  For him, nothing was possible. \\"......... His mother beat him (when he ate her lunch ration out of hunger) and he viewed her as a competitor for food. His father was allowed by guards to sleep with his mother just five nights a year, ignored him. His brother was a stranger........Love and mercy and family were words without meaning. God did not disappear or die. Shin never heard of him......\\"<br /><br />This book showed in gory details, the ultimate devaluing of human life. Western thought has been largely shaped by a Judeo-Christian values that emphasizes the dignity of human life based on the Biblical teaching that man is made in the image of God. Cultures that do not embrace this teaching are left with nothing by the survival of the fittest mentality, which when taken to its logically conclusion will end in situations like this.<br /><br />Blaine Harden did an excellent job in writing this book. The book is an easy read in terms of the writing style, but a very difficult read in terms of the content. You will come to understand the total depravity of man, once you read this book. The events of this book show us that man is not basically good as some would have us believe, but we are born with a sin nature which can only be redeemed and transformed by Christ Jesus.<br /><br />Reading level: ages 18 and up
B00992CF6W|4.0|Minecraft Pocket Edition works on Kindle Fire for me, with a caveat - I had to call Amazon support to help push things along. Something clearly isn't right, however Amazon's fantastic support staff will be happy to help you out. While the installation isn't perfect, the game is exactly what you would expect it to be. If you have played Minexraft on PC or XBox, the controls might be difficult to get used to, but once you're accustomed to them its smooth.
B006BDHAX0|3.0|It is fun, challenging, ane enjoyable except when it freezes on me, and then there is nothing one can do about it except get off the computer and try again later. It alwaays saves the game, but the time is so high I just start over at another time.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|A must read for anyone who's curious to how these warriors interact and carry out the most important and secret missions for our country. Nothing political or one sided was written; just a story about a SEAL team carrying out a task that brought to close a deep wound that has haunted this country for a very long time.
B007UXSPK2|5.0|You know the formula - the characters of the Mission: Impossible team get into, well, a seemingly impossible mission and come out victorious.  Yet desite a predictable formula, every one of these movies did extremely well, it seems. Critics dig them, fans dig them, the box office digs them. Why do we have to wait 4-5 years between each one??<br /><br />I really thought the Ghost Protocol movie would be over-the-top, as a lot of movies late in the franchise are. (Remember the '90's James Bond driving an invisible car?  Bleaach!)  While this MI did have some of those aspects it remained true to delivering great action via compelling characters. I'll definitely watch this multiple times.<br /><br />Hopefully, I don't have to wait until 2016 to see a 56 year old Cruise do his thing....
B004VMUS9G|1.0|Worked great for a few months and then there was no sound to the alarm.  It would show it going working but no audio with it.  luckily I was already awake at the time so I wasn't late to work.  I am going to take it off device and try another app.  Yes my volume was on.

B008MG1E4A|5.0|Easy read. Best I have read lately. Started on Tuesday evening, finished on Wednesday afternoon. I have recommended this book to numerous friends.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this game to you people that say its stupid you suck.the price is right compared to the xbox and laptop.
B008OTTRXU|5.0|Ok, if your looking for an upbeat cd to get you into a dance mood, then this is the kinda cd you'll like for sure. It takes me back to the late 90's, early 2000's with the Brithey Spears days, kinda of the bubble gum pop era. It doesn't have a whole lot of great depth and soul searching, but will keep you listening with it's upbeat songs that'll make you wanna dance.<br /><br />There are a couple of ballads in there that are pretty good too, which a good cd should have. I think this girl has a great future ahead of her. She has a great voice, and if she can pick some good songs and producers to help her on her journey, and mature a little along the way she can be in the music business for a long time.<br /><br />I think this is a great for her first really big release, and first big U.S. release. I'm sure this will have a few more radio hits off of it, and some songs will be remixed for radio or dance clubs. Either way, this girl is going to be around for awhile unless she totally makes some wrong choices musically.<br /><br />So if your looking for a some music just to get you in and upbeat mood, or to dance too, you'll like this CD. I did, and do recomend it to my friends looking for some new music to add to their collection.
B0087HT36U|5.0|so fun! im tired of the overrated birds. its addicting, and its better! i play it with my niece and she likes it better than birds too.

B008JGSM6G|5.0|Very fun puzzle game. It starts off really easy, so anyone can get into it, but it starts to ramp up in difficulty later on and may require some trial and error and thought. Simple and enjoyable, I cant believe it's a free game. Totally worth the time to play.

B0086449YA|5.0|There's no one quite like Mark Knopfler, and if you're a fan of his solo works, you will not be disappointed. This two-album collection is unmistakably Knopfler.<br />If fact, it's \\"so Knopfler\\" that you begin to wonder if that's a good thing or not. Has his originality become predictable? Nah - still great.<br /><br />The majority of these beautifully recorded, mostly-acoustic, tracks lean towards slower ballads, which is fine by me. Of the handful of faster tempo songs, many have a funky Bourbon Alley feel to them (\\"I Used to Could\\", \\"Gator Blood\\") and merely rate an \\"adequate\\" on initial listen. In fact, if I had to name a theme to the album after a single listen, I'd say it's backwoods, southern US, honky tonk (\\"After the Beanstalk\\"), which I would not normally like, but somehow he makes it work for me. But it's the ballads, which as usual, always excel. Not many write such wonderful lyrics that paint such colorful pictures in your mind (Remember \\"Ragpicker's Dream\\"? \\"Madame Geneva's\\"?)<br /><br />My very favorite Mark Knoplfer tunes almost always have the wonderful Celtic-inspired instrumentations that he and his band does so very well, and this collection includes a couple of those as well.<br /><br />Often I don't like an album the first time I hear it, so it amazes me how I can listen to new Mark Knopfler album and instantly like it. I can tell whether each song will be extraordinary, or merely average in the first few measures of the track. \\"Radio City Serenade\\" captured my heart immediately, and \\"Redbud Tree\\" and \\"Kingdom of Gold\\" stand out as future classics that will get lots of play in my iTunes library. Just from the name, I knew \\"Dream of the Drowned Submariner\\" would be the kind of song that has earned Mark Knopfler the top place in my favorite artist list, and I was not wrong.<br /><br />So, while there's nothing especially new or experimental here, you can rest comfortably knowing that these beautiful tunes will embrace you like an old friend.<br /><br />Mark's not for everyone, but if you're already a fan, do not hesitate. You will love this album.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I enjoyed the book much more than I'd expected to after seeing the film (no offense to the excellent cast, it's simply a story that failed to translate to the medium). I particularly enjoyed the experience of being inside the character's head, which is probably the facet most responsible for making this a difficult story to put to film. Although written simply enough for a young audience, this is a story I can see being of interest to people of all ages, particularly fans of dystopian fiction.
B0085A9HXS|4.0|For those of us who saw Iko Ukwais in \\"Merantau,\\" THIS is the film we've been waiting for. Those slow pacing issues from \\"Merantau\\" are no longer an issue. Once the film reaches the 20-minute mark, the film becomes a non-stop punching, kicking, and stab fest. And there is quite a bit of stabbing in this movie! There is not a dull moment with the gun fights and fist fights.<br /><br />This film comes to blu-ray uncut, in high picture quality, with the original language and score. Mike Shinoda from Linkin Park provides an alternative score. *I've watched the film with both scores and I personally find the rap beats annoying and prefer the original score.
B0089BSM70|5.0|Finally, The Halloween II release that fans deserve. This Blu Ray/DVD edition is packed to the rafters with all the extras that we have been desiring. Audio commentary with Director Rick Rosenthal and the man who portrayed the shape, Dick Warlock. Also, a making of documentary, trailer, TV & radio spots, and a very fun feature from Sean Clark's Horror's Hallowed Grounds.<br /><br />This release also boasts the first time released TV edition of the film, which I'm currently watching. I haven't seen this version of the film in probably 20+ years. It's really like watching a whole new movie.<br /><br />The packaging for Halloween II is breath taking. The original art work for the cover is fantastic. But, the real treat here is the reversible covers. The opposite side shows the original one sheet and video release art work of the iconic pumpkin skull.<br /><br />This is by far the most superior release of Halloween II to ever hit the shelves. Worth getting even if you have a copy of this movie already. I currently own 6 copies.(don't judge me, Haha!)<br /><br />I want to extend my appreciation to Shout! Factory for this masterpiece. They have done an incredible job.

B0088X7YU0|4.0|This movie continues the Starship Troopers series.  As others have pointed out, the second and third installments didn't live up to the incredible graphics of the original.  But here, the producers were able to create scenes which would have been far too expensive to create with live actors.  I thought the human characters were very well done.  The nudity? I loved it.  It wasn't gratuitous at all, it showed the personalities of the actors, living in close quarters.  For Ice Blonde, it showed how cool she was, flaunting herself.  With Trig, it was more romantic.  The action scenes were also done well, highlighting the heroism and self sacrifice of the characters.  Were there too many characters?  Not at all.  Each one had a distinct personality, and since they wear name tags, it's not too hard to keep track of who's who.  An extensive \\"making of\\" feature is included, showing how the animators used motion capture, and even facial capture to make things fairly realistic.  By the way, the director, animation and music were all done by Japanese moviemakers, and since it's in English, they brought American actors to Japan to do the voice capture.  It really is impressive.

B005S9EJ14|5.0|From the assured director's hands of John Madden (The Debt, Shakespeare in Love, Ethan Frome, Mrs. Brown, Captain Corelli's Mandolin, Proof, etc) comes this warmly humorous and genuinely nostalgic film adapted by Ol Parker from Deborah Moggach's novel \\"These Foolish Things\\". Boating one of the finest casts of veteran actors from England it is a film that pays attention to the lives and emotions of senior citizens  - and has a terrific time in the process.<br /><br />A group of British retirees decide to \\"outsource\\" their retirement to less expensive and seemingly exotic India to take up residence in what they believe is a newly restored hotel. Less luxurious than its advertisements, the Marigold Hotel nevertheless slowly begins to charm in unexpected ways.  The story begins in London where the brief but necessary groundwork for our group of elder citizens is established - the frustrations of retirement, the death of a husband, the crumbling of a marriage of convenience, and the need for feeling physically attractive when facing a mirror. Once our entourage arrives in Jaipur (amongst the squalor of poverty matched by the sense of freedom of living in the moment) they are greeted by the young manager Sonny (Dev Patel) of the Best Exotic Marigold Hotel, whose enthusiasm and optimism suffuse the entire film.<br /><br />The new tenants are a varied bunch: Muriel (Maggie Smith) has come to India (despite her hideous bigotry and racism) for a hip replacement, Evelyn (Judi Dench) is a new widow unable to afford a retirement home in England and longing for adventure, Douglas (Bill Nighy) and his chronically cranky wife Jean (Penelope Wilton) likewise cannot afford the embarrassment and finances of a British retirement facility, Norman (Ronald Pickup) who cannot `face' aging and the lack of feminine accompaniment, Madge (Celia Imrie) who longs to discover a man to love, and Graham (Tom Wilkerson) a gay man whose lived in the closet in England forever guilty about his true love he left in India many years ago.  Stir this kettle, add romance (not only from Sonny and his lower caste girlfriend Sunaina -Tena Desae, but also the awakening of new love in most all of the tenants o the Marigold), and out pours a film of physical beauty, memorable bits of philosophy from both the old and young, and a sense of discovery which is always at the end  - `or it isn't the end.' Highly recommended for old AND young.  Grady Harp, September 12e he left in India many years ago.

B006O7XOOW|5.0|This is a great toy for our 10-month-old.  It's designed to assist from going from crawling to standing to walking. A very fun toy that seems to keep a baby's admittedly tiny attention span engaged for much longer than other toys. Of course, if you want to delay your crawler from transitioning to toddler in order to save your furtniture (not to mention your energy) you may want to think twice about getting this.  Otherwise, this is a great transition toy.
B0087HT36U|3.0|Despite the crashes it IS a fun game.  There are a few levels where everything has to, 100%, go you way to gold crown and a few levels where I had trouble with timing.

B008LZHA3G|3.0|Our man Bob probably would do well to return to a producer rather than Jack Frost. Album has its merits but is, in many ways, a missed opportunity. Some songs are so musically redundant, horribly dull, monotonous, as already well noted. Pity, what is with this man??? Is that why Charlie is so sad faced these days? No room to move? I know that the album will grow on me, and I pray for the release of the album of religious songs he had wanted to record, but too many of the vocals here on Tempest sound like they desperately needed someone with the guts to say, let's take it one more time, Bob. I have this image of Bob saying, that's it, that's good, i'm done and just walking off. Like a stubborn old man, know them well. Some good tunes here, some needing serious musical variety, and some needing one or two or three more takes.<br /><br />And BTW, I wish to G-d Dylan wasn't such an ornery bastard. And to give a little love here and there, or just once, to his fans. Yes, I know well his twisted history, but for goodness sakes, a little fan appreciation here and there would be nice. I'd like to think my \\"hero\\" isn't such a nasty wack job.  I hope he's just taking counsel from Pablo, or is returning to his ornery 1965-6 self for mofo publicity.

B007HGPBRC|5.0|This fierce and brave description of the discovery of --- and living with --- an advanced and inoperable esophageal cancer by one of my favorite writers only reinforced for me the devotion I have to his ideas and his ability to express them. He never becomes self pitying, nor does he shy away from describing the physical horrors which he endured. We are left with sadness for what he had to go through and for our loss of a great writer and humanist.

The packaging is very nice and has some neat artwork that I never saw.Some people have been fussy with how 'Raiders' looked, but they fail to remember the age of the film;some of the matte painting shots are blurry. But they all never looked and sounded better!<br /><br />I am a fan of these films, I saw Raiders last week in IMAX. I feel it is the best Action Adventure of all time! Nobody can top the technical significance of the 'Truck chase' in Raiders!<br /><br />The 'Temple of Doom' is a close 2nd. It has the most awesome 40 minute finale in the history of film! It goes so low (dark,violent) and rises so high out of it with wall to wall rousing scenes.<br /><br />'The Last Crusade' is the most sentimental of all of the films. Without Sean Connery, it is kinda too ordinary, but its good fun!<br /><br />Because I am an Indy fan, I still like 'Crystal Skull' but I certainly call it the weakest of the 4. I think they all progressively get worse, but they are all good films. If you watch the DOC's Spielberg is apologizing that he didnt want to do aliens! Too much CGI!! Ford was 65 in the last film, but he worked great! The material was the problem! The crew got too lazy and forgot how to properly do an action film like the others! 'Crystal Skull' and 'The Lost World' are OK films, but since they have Steven Speilberg's name attached to them, they are not good!<br /><br />  The extras are alot of fun. There is a new 1 hour DOC on Raiders that is so cool! It shows fun deleted scenes and outtakes in HD!.<br /><br />Indy paid homage to the Action serials. Now current action films are a garbled mess. You cant tell what is goin on. New filmmakers need to study the 'truck chase' in Raiders so they know how to do an effective and digestible action scene.<br /><br />John Williams is such a big part of the significance of these films. Especially Temple of doom. I am sad that movies like these are something we have to digfor, because the 'new' movies just don't get it!

B008JGSM6G|4.0|great value. for those who like puzzles.  warning -- it can be addictive.  hundreds of boards to chose from from very easy to very difficult
B008XG1X18|5.0|love it...I love pinterest and this is great in my kindle. no problems at all and its actually nicer than on my laptop. this is a must app if u love pinterest as much as I do. easy to get around and pin.
B003WUYOQ6|4.0|I enjoyed this book.  Accessible information with research support.  Before I embark on a diet, I need to understand the whys and wherefores.  The reason for 4 stars is that it was a bit repetitive.  Don't expect this book to tell you what to eat.  It does have some diet info in the appendix, but it is really more education on why we get fat.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|This game has very easy levels and ones you might think are impossible. I am definately happy I got it. It gives my mind a workoit!
B0012QRPU4|3.0|We have heard rave reviews about this series so we are watching them all.  The first season can be summed up as Character Development.  At times it is very slow and if I had seen this program when it was originally out I probably would have not watched it.  Due to the hype, we kept watching.  The second season is much better and has us hooked.<br />The service from Amazon is excellent and am thrilled we have it.
B007GCY8FS|2.0|I so looked forward to Lee Child's new Reacher book. It was a disapointment. Started out well, faded in the middle and fell flat and boring at the end. Come on, Mr Child, you can do better.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I love this book can't wait for the movie. I can not wait to read the rest of the series. This is a must read.
B0006SSOHC|4.0|4 1/2 Stars = Minor Masterpiece<br /><br />With the glut of the so called \\"torture porn\\" genre over the last ten years, & myself being 52 years old & weaned on monster/ghost movies, I just didn't have the time nor desire to watch \\"Saw.\\" A movie that is majorly responsible for this masochistic horror sub-genre, that's really is only an excuse to see people graphically tortured & mutilated, without any redeeming qualities. I was WRONG!<br /><br />I had just got Netflix streaming & there was \\"Saw.\\" I thought to myself, why not, lets see what all the hoopla is about. I mean a film that is pretty much responsible for a whole horror sub-genre, has to have something going for it, right? Right! I was very pleasantly surprised! Here we have a film with a white knuckled terrific plot, what would you do to save yourself? Great acting, an intelligent script, great pacing & direction, & it was more than just a torture porn flick, it had redeeming qualities & characters. It was not what I expected at all! It was actually closer to films like \\"Silence of the Lambs\\" & \\"Seven, & was the best film of that ilk since those great movies! I was almost dumbfounded, & thought, why did I wait so long!<br /><br />\\"Saw\\" is a movie that every horror & non-horror fan should see. It is a shining example of how to get much mileage out of a film, with no gas money. Though I'm not inspired to check out it's sequels, as most sequels get progressively worse, this is a film I'll watch many more times, & recommend!<br /><br />A cutting edge film!
B008Y1RTUG|5.0|The whole family sat down the other night to watch this and all 5 of us agree it was a spectacular movie! We thought Chris Hemsworth, was terrific but we were all agree that Charlize was amazing as the Wicked Queen. Great story...fantastic special effects.
0385342063|1.0|1.  Footnotes were a good idea, but so distracting on Kindle. I gave up after number 51.<br />2.  I never had any idea what Poppy looked like.<br />3.  I had absolutely no idea why either Poppy or Magnus would marry each other. All I knew was that Magnus had good hair.<br />4.  (most important)  Poppy was such an incompetent, unprofessional and unethical physical therapist. She should have been fired and have had her license revoked. It made me so sad to read how a physical therapist was portrayed.<br /><br />I only finished this book to have enough information to write a review. It gave me something to read in the carpool lane.<br />Sincerely,<br />A competent,professional and ethical P.T.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This app is the absolute best. I can read it whenever, and the reading plans are great. Only thing, wish I could download ALL versions not just some. Overall great!
B0068THAGY|4.0|I really really love this movie - is a rare mixture of innocence, emotion, and fantasy. I had forgotten how good it was until I just recently rewatched it. For a few brief hours I was transported back to the awkwardness of my youth, with that nerdy Dungeon & Dragons-infused belief that anything was possible. A nice escape.
B00992CF6W|5.0|please work its not working so u guys know any good restraints? I'm hungry r u?any of u quests wanna talk

B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I can't get enough of this game! It's  completely addictive and has tons of crazy puzzles that test my brain! Love MDHD!!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|its a very good time waster but some of the games can be a bit unresponsive with the touch screen
B005CAATXG|5.0|I received this cd in the mail in perfect condition and played it right away...Awesome! Very talented group and while playing it had several people ask who it was and i told them order it from amazon as far as i know at least one of them did!
B006R8GK2Q|5.0|I really enjoy this game, it is a lot of fun. I do wish it had more levels. I picked it up when it was offered for free.
0802130208|4.0|\\"A Confederacy of Dunces\\" is as funny as it is sad, and as endearing as it is heartbreaking. It's a skillfully written book, full of bizarre people with outlandish motives doing strange things in a nutty place. Author Toole captures, orchestrates and conveys all that mayhem brilliantly. This book is entertaining, thoughtful, and well worth reading. Enjoy it.
B004NYQYNQ|5.0|Incredible voice!  The album is finely crafted and well produced but mostly; What a Voice.  I bought this CD for my daughter and I thought I'd listen to it to see what all the hubbub was about.  Well I sure found out.  This is one of the best albums I've ever heard from the first song to the last.  I do not listen to very much \\"new\\" music but it's great to know that great music is still being made.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|music is lovely.  gameplay is challenging but not impossible.  a great way to relax. well worth the buck!! you won't be sorry.
B006UKFFE0|5.0|This is the book that lays out the new \\"leanlaunch\\" methodology to starting a business. This isn't to say that you won't need a traditional business plan if you want to do an SBA loan, but here's how you should approach your sampling, testing, and idea phase for creating your business.<br /><br />Here's your blue-print for making a company! Huphup, get to it!
0062197258|4.0|PLOT: Cathy Bailey suffers from OCD and PTSD due to attacks she suffered at the hands of an abusive ex-boyfriend. She was just beginning to live again when he's released from prison.<br /><br />PROS: I like the slow pacing and gradual development of the story. It's very effective for the plot.<br /><br />I liked the last confrontation Cathy had with Lee. Anything less would have been unsatisfactory. And I so loved that last bit at the end.<br /><br />CONS: There are no chapters in this book. Just dates. For the majority of the book, the dates vacillate from Cathy's present to three years in the past. It was most annoying. If this had been a movie, I would have changed the channel before it was five minutes in.<br /><br />Cathy had horrible friends. I found their behavior highly unbelievable.<br /><br />It's a tad predictable in parts. I won't say how as that would be a spoiler. Suffice it to say, if you're a fan of suspense or horror flicks, you won't find many surprises here.<br /><br />4 STARS: This is like reminded me Sleeping with the Enemy. It's a gripping tale and to be honest, I'm glad to be done with it. I would NOT recommend this to victims of abuse. It gets quite violent towards the end. Some may also find the language to be offensive. Know that if this were a movie, it would be rated R.
B005HES6PU|5.0|The basic premise is that some humanoid is found under wreckage on some generic planet, and Dr. Crusher and her awesome medical team save his life. Interestingly enough, this alien is a total nice person, but has no memory. Details emerge from the crew's investigation that include evidence of a battle, and that he was running away from something. Further, clues are dropped that his entire being is slowly undergoing a change (a painful one at that). Aside from his incredibly fast recovery abilities, this alien also has the ability to heal others! But it isn't only physical healing, he also is able to heal things such as a lack of self-confidence, as in the case of Geordi. (As this was going on, I could not help but feel the writers took an inspiration from a certain famous character from the Bible's New Testament.)<br /><br />Well, the story goes on, and the crew takes a liking to this fellow, but Picard of course, has to protect his crew and ship. This is apparent when the alien's pursuers show up and threaten battle with the Enterprise if they do not hand over John Doe (as the crew has come to know him). Sure enough, at the last possible moment, John, the alien, remembers what he was about all along--he was undergoing a metamorphosis that his species undergo, but their government had been oppressing for generations. John undergoes his metamorphosis, and turns into a creature of light (again, a Bible reference?), and he totally shows his enormous power and prevents any further conflict between the two species. Picard, and the crew, are amazed at this metamorphosis, and John goes on his way. I think the title of the episode gives away the source of inspiration for this episode.<br /><br />Despite any possible inferences of the source material, this is a well done episode where the crew's humanity shows through, even in the presence of all the fabulous technology. And of course, the concepts of healing, and allowing change are explored. Good pacing, good acting, and wonderful moments with worth and Geordi. However, some of the writer's moments (like in the opening sequence) I found my eyes rolling and questioning the logic of it, but not anything major to at all distract the enjoyment of this solid episode.
B005CKPPNA|5.0|I am so amazed at how good this television series is.  There seems to be a well planned story that is realized almost perfectly by the cast and everyone else involved.  This season Walt is in total fear of his life.  While he is able to make meth is a state of the art meth lab set up by Gus Fring, he gradually realizes that Gale, a scientific meth maker, is being groomed to take over for Walt.  Walt is not going to die from his cancer but murdered by Mike, Gus' primary hit man.  Jesse is also being worked with to see if he can develop alliances with Gus and turn away from his loyalty to Walt.  The season builds and builds to an amazing conclusion.  All the time his brother in law Hank is following his trail without realizing it even from a wheelchair.  Skyler begins to operate a car wash to launder meth money and begins to take some gangster traits of her own.  Who survives and dies is an overarching question in this season but it also takes a good look at how the carnage and goings on affect the survivors.  Some retain a sense of morality even if warped but others seem to become convinced of their own immortality and claim the right to protect themselves from others no matter what the cost.  The show creates interesting insight into the characters.  The term Breaking Bad seems to mean a person who breaks through the barrier of good and bad and enters into the \\"bad\\" world.
B001NLKT60|5.0|This book is a page turner. Don't go here if you are looking for anything serious. This is a good fast-paced action-packed thriller. It is unusual to find this genre written from a female perspective.
B000W237RE|5.0|There is little else to say on this one. This is a great album from a great band in their prime.
B008XG1X18|3.0|While I have enjoyed the layout of this app and the ease of using it, I have experienced a very annoying problem recently. About a week ago, I was notifiedthat there was an update available. Since I updated the app, it has frozen on me, often as it is opening. This has been happening more times then not when I have used the app. Can this problem be fixed?
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I really like this game.  Fun for the whole family.  Like that you can start over if you want and try level again to get a perfect score.
030758836X|4.0|This book is captivating and hard to put down. It is well written and enjoyable, but I did find myself disappointed with the ending. Definitely worth reading regardless.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Great book. This guy is a hero. Not only for what he did but also because he came out and told the truth while Obama and his administration did nothing but lie and take the credit.
B008NAFU9A|5.0|Her sweetest downfall, indeed.<br /><br />I must say that I'm ever impressed with Rebecca's writing and the way that this story, though a novella derived from The Forever Girl series, stands well enough on its own.<br /><br />While fighting the ache to be with a man named Ethan, an Ankou, Ophelia learns that the stories she was told as a child were real. Even more, she's given a purpose by the Universe revealed in the ouroboros that appears on her body. A purpose that involves her becoming the very thing she despises...a Cruor.<br /><br />This story weaves a delicate balance of dark and romance. This is a fast, satisfying read that I recommend to everyone who loves a good paranormal romance. I'm looking forward to more from this author, as I'm sure she won't disappoint.<br /><br />This review also appears on [...] as well as Goodreads.
B00846REIS|1.0|First let me say it does not come close to 50 Shades of Grey. Ssecond who the heck ends a book like that, just a ploy to sell more books.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|overall a fun app. its really good for car rides and long periods of time doing nothing. can be addicting
B0096DFBZQ|1.0|its not even worth the data it takes up on your kindle. u gef one cart with one map and one track. if namco is gonna make it free, they should do a better job
B007GCY8FS|1.0|Sadly I must agree with most of the negative reviews.  Child has always described weapons in great detail. That is not my thing so I just skim over those parts. Unfortunately, there were so many descriptions of other things, I found that at times I had to go back and reread parts of the story to remember where we were before all of the descriptions.<br /><br />And what is the deal of Tom Cruise playing Reacher??? Tom Cruise is about 5'6\\" and Reacher is a good foot taller. I like Tom  Cruise but NOT in this role. I suppose if you haven't read a Reacher book it might work.  I have read all of them and was so looking forward to this book. I definately will not be paying full price for another Reacher Book.<br /><br />After reading this book I wonder if Child actually wrote it.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|This book is enthralling. It took a couple of chapters to get into but as soon as you do it's over. You just want to keep reading to see the charachters develop or in some cases get killed off. Lies betrayal incest it's all there.
0525953728|5.0|I AGREE WITH MOST OF THE REVIEWS.I CAN NOT ADD MUCH, I WAS NOT GOING TO REVIEW, UNTIL I READ PAGES 288 AND 289.THE BEST OF THE BEST OF DEVGRU ARE THE RIGHTFUL BALL SPIKERS, PERIOD. THE BOOK IS EXCELLENT IN TELLING OF THE TRAINING TO BECOME A SEAL.DEVGRU IS THE NEXT EXTENSIVE TRAINING .THE AUTHOR SURVIVING IN ALL HIS MISSIONS WAS A MIRACLE.AMERICA NEEDS THSES VOLUNTERS,NOT AN INACTIVE X DEVGRU FOUNDER CALLING THESE HARD WORKING PATRIOTS, EGOMANIACS.IGNORE SUCH IDIOTS. GOD BLESS AMERICA.
B000CNE092|5.0|When I purchased the DVD, I thought it only contained the movie \\"Anastasia\\". I was surprised to find it included the sequel (well, prequel) \\"Bartok the Magnificent\\". In conclusion, this is a 2 disc movie set.<br /><br />The only dislike I have is that \\"Bartok the Magnificent\\" is in fullscreen. The \\"Anastasia\\" movie is in widescreen I am happy to state.
B005LAIH3G|5.0|I foolishly waited for John Carter to be offered on cable before I took my friends advice and watched it. I was amazed. As he had warned, it was better than 'Star Wars,' but what I was not prepared for was the romance and humor that was also in this movie. I watched it again 'on demand,' each time waking up in the morning with the 'I just saw an amazing movie' happy buzz that I have not had in years. I went out to buy the DVD and in every store I visited, there were NO copies. Disney sure made a mistake by not promoting this movie to it's fullest!
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I saw my friends reading all kinds of books on their kindles.  I didn't think there were books on there for me, I don't read novels. I read resource material and research books.  One day a friend told  me there was books available that I would use.  I downloaded the kindle and much to my surprise There are some great books for me. Now I am all into kindle reading.<br /><br />Robin
B004LROUNG|2.0|from the reviews i expected a fast moving and colorful plot. Wrong! I feft there was unfinished character development and i kept thinking there would be a surprising twist. Wrong! This was a big disappointment from a normally great author.
B007IXWL2C|3.0|These books are not very well written, if I had to read \\"He cocked his head to one side\\" again I was going to scream. Even the sex scenes were the same and I found myself skipping over them. Truly not the best trilogy I ever read, I would not reccomend these books.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|This book was hard to put down. It is interesting how the media distorts what really happened.<br />Well written narrative of events.
B008MG1E4A|1.0|I'm interested in this topic, but the writing is at about a second grade level and I'm so put off by the poor writing, I haven't been able to get into the book. This guy should have hired a better ghost writer!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book is worth every dollar. Besides all the erotic parts the story is actually amazing! I will defiantly be reading the entire series, and possibly rereading them!
B004ZLBTK0|5.0|Well, I love Adele, so this album is a must-have for me.  I love every track on it, and if you love Adele, so will you!
B008MG1E4A|3.0|Only the first chapter and the last couple deal with the actual day OBL was killed.  In between are chapters full of what it is like to become a SEAL as he recounts his many missions over ten years.  It's full of macho testosterone driven escapades.  I was disappointed to read about some antics that were less than respectful of the people there and of women (the bra incident) and think he will regret those actions when he grows up - if he ever does in that way.  It was mildly informative about how OBL died but it was misleading since the author did not kill him.  In fact, I thought it was totally unnecessary to machine gun the guy in the stomach when he was already obviously dead with is brains coming out of his skull.  Was that really right?  I think it is inflammatory to our relationship with Muslims.
B001SZ2Y4G|3.0|I love the Coen Brothers but I feel asleep twice during this movie. It was beautifully filmed and art directed but the story was very slow. It should have been edited wayyyyy down from it's length to keep my interest. I'm not much a Tim Robbins fan but he did a great job as did Paul Newman. Jennifer Jason Leigh was a bit tough to watch as much of her acting seemed forced. Charles Durning was great as always! i waited 16 years to see this but definitely not on my \\"watch again\\" list.
B0087HT36U|1.0|This app has potential and I like the premise. However, this game freezes every couple of boards. I have to go back to home screen and force close the app. Then I have to sit through the startup screens all over again.<br /><br />Please fix the freezing.
B0053VKP8S|5.0|I have a set of Bose computer speakers that sound better than annything in the same price range. This device let me connect my new Panasonic HDTV to the speakers.<br /><br />They sound great. I just have to keep in mind that they are now connected to the TV's Digital Audio Output. This means analog TV channels don't push audio through.<br />But hey, who watches analog tv channels on a new HDTV anyway?<br /><br />I love this little box. Connected it in 5 minutes, and have been satisfied ever since.
B008KYOCA2|4.0|I have MonthPlanner 3.2.1 by Joshua Pyun on my Palm OS pda and phone, but needed something else when I upgraded my phone.  This app is probably going to be the closest I can find to my MonthPlanner that I love, and I was surprised when I found out that I could download fonts (free) to use and change color themes to personalize the calendar!  I also love being able to use icons to make to events and tasks stand out, just like with MonthPlanner 3.2.1.  This is awesome!

B002RI9ZPY|5.0|I enjoyed \\"girl with the dragon tattoo trilogy\\" Once you start reading the book 1 of the trilogy, you have to finish the other books. And I really like this trilogy.
B0083SBMBM|5.0|Like all the rest I will tell you this is a fantastic movie and well worth a watch.  I do have to say that $20 for a DVD only is crazy. Did DVD's become more expensive to make?  It was just 2 years ago DVD's would come out and be 9.99 sometimes.  Although I love this movie I am going to take a pass on the $20 I can rent it to get my immediate fix (thanks netflix) and I will just wait till its on one of the many streaming services (Amazon Prime) just like Thor, Captain America, and Iron man are now.  Plus less clutter in my house.

B005IQZB14|4.0|I enjoyed learning the history regarding the development of the trail, the many years and effort it took to make it happen. I admired the authors courage, although many times I just thought she was foolish and very lucky to have not been eaten, raped or hospitalized for those poor feet. Despite all that, it was entertaining, well written and I enjoyed it.
0425263908|4.0|If you're one of the four, maybe five people in the world who haven't read that little Shades of Grey book, then you're in for an erotic treat with this one.<br /><br />If you've already gone through the \\"rolling eyes, biting lip, inner goddess, control-freak, twitchy palm\\" saga, then you may agree that this is the same story, but rewritten by someone with a better command of the English language.<br /><br />I would suggest that instead of filming \\"Grey\\" on its own, producers could work on a tag-team approach, as Team Christian-Ana battles Team Gideon-Eva for bragging rights on being the most damaged partnership in the arena.<br /><br />The main difference so far is that it took three books for E. L. James to get her plot together (or even remember to include one in the story), while Sylvia Day nails it for the first 99% and then forgets to include an ending.  Maybe books two and three will reveal which team wins the big leather belt (or grey tie).<br /><br />Amanda Richards, September 19, 2012
B003O86FMW|5.0|Throughout the story I admired Suzanne Collins imagination.<br /><br />I had become Katniss.<br /><br />Reading Catching Fire was enormously entertaining and enjoyable as was reading The Hunger Games and Mockingjay.<br /><br />Lucy
030758836X|5.0|Don't read any more reviews. They are all positive for a reason. You will be spoiling this to-be-savored gem of a novel -- a thriller, page turner -- both complete understatements. Just buy it. Don't open it until you have about 6-7 hours to ignore your job/family/life. Impossible to put down. Who did it? Who did you root for?
B004XDYJRU|4.0|My original review ripped this product because you couldn't schedule recordings in Android version 6.3.  Version 6.4 is released and works as advertised.  My only critique now is when a recording begins, your phone/tablet will activate and you will hear the audio play for the recording.  I mitigate this by ensuring the volume on my tablet is turned off on days I plan to make a recording.  Not ideal, but works.  Overall, a good app.
B007UXSPK2|5.0|Can't say anything bad. Full of suspense, twists, and action. And Tom Cruise..., well, he's Tom Cruise. What can be said. There was that one stunt he did that totally made my heart jump cuz it was so unexpected (but I won't say which one cuz I don't want to ruin it for readers). And a final twist at the end, as all MI's have.... wow. And btw, there's just enough humor in it to diffuse the tension from all the action. Have to have it for the collection.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|A great book.<br />I don't read books, but this one.... I read in under a week, and that's with my super busy schedule. It's a MUST read
B0044XV3R8|5.0|I LOVE this movie, and I LOVE the edition I got. The collectors edition is SO much better than the original and the product was bran new! I am impressed with this product and THANK YOU!
B005HV6YO8|1.0|The person who choosed the songs did a very poor job. Only couple of the items can be called \\" the best\\". What I would call it: waste of money.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|it is a asome game to playband get it in 3-D also it is asome too try it. try it!
B003Z6WFWC|5.0|One of the best movies I have seen. The story is very inspirational, and the actors are great. I will buy this movie for my personal use.
B005XOPEOU|5.0|Awesome album! I love coldplay and this is a great addition to the amazing collection. I love it! You should all definitely buy this album
B0070NSPCU|5.0|Very, very well put together plot. Amongst my favourite books and can't wait for the next instalments! Not much else to say that hasn't already been said by others.
B0083V2WBS|4.0|the dvd was great,  I really appreciate Hugh Laurie's talent,  but<br />the audio guy on the cd should go back to school.

B008602KQI|5.0|Most of the time, a movie made based on a book is at best disappointing and at worst a complete disaster.  Happily, this is not the case with \\"The Hunger Games\\".  Casting was excellent and they did a great job adapting the book to the screen.  Any deviations from the book were minor.  If you've only watched the movie and not read the book, I highly recommend you do - since it is told from Katniss's perspective, you are privy to thoughts that are difficult to transfer to a movie.  At any rate, fans of the book will not be disappointed.  If you didn't read the book, it is still highly enjoyable and easy to follow.
0345803507|5.0|Was able to buy it before it was in book stores around here AND at a much better price. A group of us (12, men and women) bought all three books to pass around & shared the cost. Mine, by far, was the hit of the group because of the low cost!
0553278398|3.0|In Prelude, Asimov introduces readers to a young Hari Seldon, who is first conceiving of the concept of psychohistory. This book follows Seldon on a series of adventures, in which emperors, lowlifes, and everyone in between struggle to control Seldon for their own ends. Seldon begins by doubting that psychohistory is anything more than a mathematician's mental puzzle, and the story ends with Seldon determined to spend all his life devoted to the new science.<br /><br />Prelude has a fun story, and the book is worth reading for bedtime fiction; but it is weaker than Asimov's other Foundation novels in terms of literary merit and of science fiction depth. Asimov wrote this book forty-six years after penning the original Foundation story, after fans clamored for a tale of Trantor's beginning. More than four decades removed from its beginnings, this story feels far more contrived than the others in the series. Through the chapters you can feel Asimov laboring to explain a host of ideas from the earlier books, rather than simply telling a good story.<br /><br />Additionally, Prelude is far less creative, clever, and compelling than the rest of the series. It reads more like an average science fiction thriller, as the protagonist travels from one culture to another, encountering dangers from a wide variety of peoples. Asimov uses this book to connect his robot stories to Foundation, but the connection is weak and felt contrived. Psychohistory, the one element I hoped to see richly developed, was treated mostly as a mathematician's erudite plaything. Rather than elaborating on the science, Asimov merely alluded to it throughout, and Seldon himself largely talks of psychohistory as a mental puzzle rather than anything of substance. Don't read this book seeking a better understanding of Asimov's brilliant creation, psychohistory.<br /><br />If you're new to Asimov's Foundation universe, don't start with this book; go instead to Foundation and read the books in the order Asimov wrote them. If you're already familiar with the series, this book can be a fun return to Asimov's universe, but you won't enjoy it as much as you have the other books.ov wrote them. If you're already familiar with the series, this book can be a fun return to Asimov's universe, but you won't enjoy it as much as you have the other books.
B000B589JI|5.0|Seller contacted me to advise of Zippo's policy of standing behind products, which I knew but didn't even think about for this canister. So, I pack up canister & ship off to Zippo and only had to pay $1.10 postage. Within 10 days, Zippo sent me a NEW canister because they were unable to repair the one I sent! Kudos to seller for the nice email & reminder of Zippo's policy! It's a shame the original didn't work (again--NOT seller's fault) but at least I now have a functional product! I would definitely buy again!!!<br /><br />I was thrilled when I saw this on line as I always seem to run out of fluid away from home. Imagine my disappointment when I followed directions and the container leaked!!! Seller was wonderful. I returned the fuel canister to Zippo as they stand behind their products. Cannot wait to see how the new/repaired canister works. Fingers crossed.xxxxxx Will try to updated when I get new one!

0307960471|4.0|Harry Hole gets beat up more than Jim Rockwell of the \\"Rockwell Files\\", but the villains use more scary weapons against Harry. Harry's also makes Jim look like a wimp. For instance, in PHANTOM, Harry gets his throat cut; he stitches it shut himself, and when it starts to bleed he wraps it in masking tape.<br /><br />In this one, Harry returns from Bangkok to defend Rakel's son, Oleg, who has been accused of murdering a fellow drug addict, the handsome Gusto Hansson.<br /><br />The synthetic drug violin also plays a major role in the novel. If you've ever read BRAVE NEW WORLD you're familiar with soma, which was supposedly the perfect drug. Violin offers a better and longer high than heroin and is just as addictive, but it won't necessarily kill you. At the beginning of the book, Oslo is suffering from a drug problem worse than 1960's San Francisco and it's all out in the open. The police have pretty much given up trying to do something about it. A man code-named Ibsen enters the scene. In cooperation with an old Russian Nazi Collaborator that everyone calls, Dubai, politician Isabelle Skoyen and Mikael Bellman, who has been promoted to chief of police, they eliminate the competition, and  Isabelle gets credit.<br /><br />Harry must deal with all sorts of shady characters, despite the fact that he's no longer a police officer. There's an airline pilot who's smuggling drugs. There's an enforcer police officer, Truls Berntsen, who does Mikael's dirty work for him (they're both from the same home town).<br /><br />Oleg also has a girlfriend, Irene, whom Gusto has been selling to score drugs. Oleg loves Irene almost as much as Harry loves Rakel. There are also a bunch of crazy Russians running around doing Dubai's bidding.<br /><br />So . . . Harry, in the process of trying to prove Oleg's innocence, must track down Dubai, and Ibsen, and find out who, within the government, has been doing their bidding.<br /><br />Unfortunately the novel ends in a cliffhanger, but there are several reasons to believe that this isn't the last one. Only one of the bad guys gets his comeuppance for one thing, and Harry's a cat with more than nine lives.are several reasons to believe that this isn't the last one.

B008J5T4Q4|2.0|I love the album, but am disappointed that the vinyl package includes the LPs in plain white, generic sleeves.  It does not include any printed innersleeves or inserts with lyrics, musician credits, etc.  The least they could have done was throw in a CD booklet!
B007GCY8FS|1.0|I'd been looking forward to this new Reacher book all summer.  And, all I got was one of those books that looks like it belongs as a freebie in the Kindle Owners Lending Library.  This book is rambling and incoherent. I never thought I'd find a Reacher book to be boring--but boring this is.  There's no real suspense either (except for asking myself: \\"when will this mess end?\\").  Someone really screwed up in terms of quality control here.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|It should be required reading in all schools<br />We need to be aware of the truth of what is going on..  He did not reveal any secrets . The media is responsible for most of the hype surrounding this book.
B0083TXXZ4|4.0|We have yet to go wrong with a Nerf blaster. The Hail-Fire is the Quantity over Quality model: it's not the most accurate or the longest-ranged Nerf gun (although it's certainly accurate and powerful *enough*), but it has a huge magazine capacity.<br /><br />The mechanism for advancing to the next clip works nicely, with a solid-feeling handle. Holding the gun with one hand on the top handle instead of supporting the barrel from beneath is a little awkward at first, but you get used to it quickly, and the unique hybrid pump/ bolt action is pretty cool.<br /><br />I'm going to list the negatives, which are fairly minor. Aside from these few issues, this is another example of a great toy gun from our pals at Nerf.<br /><br />* Initial assembly of the gun is slightly tricky. It takes a fair amount of force to fit the parts together, which took awhile because I was afraid of breaking it. Thankfully, once it's together, there's no need to take it apart again.<br /><br />* Due to the large round clip holder, the gun is very wide and kind of awkward to store.<br /><br />* Although the gun holds 8 clips and the box lists the maximum ammo capacity of 144 darts, only four 6-dart clips are included (along with 24 darts). So unless you already have a bunch of clips and darts handy, you'll be very tempted to spend more money to fill this up. To maximize it, you'll need to buy 8 18-shot clips, which will set you back nearly a hundred simoleons. On the lower end, they do sell a [[ASIN:B0083TXZ6G N-Strike Elite Hail-Fire Mission Kit]] that gives you 4 more 6-dart clips for around fifteen bucks. (In addition, the gun looks a little goofy with only 4 clips attached and all that empty space, but nobody's going to notice that while you're pumping 24 darts into them. ;) )<br /><br />* Build quality issues: Although my gun has been problem-free, I notice that some other reviewers have reported issues with the motor trigger mechanism. Be aware that you may need to attempt a fix or returnthe gun for a replacement.<br /><br />* Batteries! Not a huge deal, but be aware that some excellent spring-loaded Nerf guns are available (notably, my personal favorite, the [[ASIN:B0083TXWXC N-Strike Elite Retaliator Blaster]]).

1451627289|5.0|I always found Stephen King's earlier works TOO realistic in their depiction of horror. But with this, and Under the Dome, he's turned a corner for me. Although both are still graphic and contain violence, especially in this novel the violence is  essential to the story. This one made me almost glad I had a head cold and had to stay in bed, because I read the whole thing in about four days and actually put myself on page rations so I could savor it. Stephen King knows how to populate an entire town with characters that you either love or hate -- and he controls which outcome is which, because of his abililty to give each his or her own personality and language. Honestly, if there is a more gifted storyteller -- one who, after a horrific accident and a hardscrabble upbringing (read his On Writing, also a wonderful book and one that has changed the way I approach the written word; no more passive voice!) knows from whence he speaks regarding suffering -- I would like them to stand up and try to write SK under the table. Ain't gonna happen!

When it comes to a story and its main characters, I've found that if you don't like the main characters, you at least have to feel able to relate to them on some level.

B0053O8AQE|5.0|One of the many wonderful surprises for me watching this \\"2 Broke Girls\\" series on DVD recently (and yes, I bought season 1 here at Amazon!! (LOL) are the many QUIET and GENUINELY MOVING moments many of the episodes manage to incorporate -- much the way that \\"Taxi,\\" \\"The Mary Tyler Moore Show,\\" \\"All In the Family,\\" and \\"Cheers\\" adroitly do -- including that truly wonderful, moving scene where the usually always-optimistic/upbeat Caroline suddenly begins sobbing uncontrollably in front of Max, as she tearfully tells Max she's terrified that she'll say the \\"wrong thing\\" at the upcoming deposition Caroline has to give regarding her father's fraud and embezzlement activities (something that, conceivably, could cause Caroline's once-rich father to be transferred to a much tougher/rougher prison in ANOTHER state, thereby preventing a similarly-broke Caroline from being able to visit him in prison again anytime soon).<br /><br />A lot has been written about how FUNNY this series is, but I think it has a lot of HEART, too -- one of the many things that had me fervently rooting for Max and Caroline from the very first episode, on.

B008JMKN4Y|5.0|This book was absolutely amazing. I loved everything about it especially that the main characters were around my age it made it so much more relate able. Its not the average life of a college student, but there is enough there that i can say \\"hey I've had that happen to me or a friend\\". It's a must read, can't wait for the second one to come out.
B009738XXM|5.0|\\"Kiss\\" is the U.S. debut album of Canadian pop star Carly Rae Jepsen. It includes Jepsen's two biggest hits \\"Call Me Maybe\\" and \\"Good Time\\" (with Owl City).  The other tracks on the album are usually in the same vain - super-catchy, lighthearted dance-pop.<br /><br />I enjoyed this album.  I could play the album and not have to skip any tracks.  While it's sugary sweet, bubblegum music, it is not shameful for an adult to enjoy. All of the tracks are classy and have a sophisticated, well-crafted production.  Jepsen has a strong singing voice, so it's easy to see how she got so far on Canadian Idol. Rather than performing generic dance-pop of the day, the album often displays a retro vibe fused with the modern. In particular, the sound of late 80s and early 90s - I was reminded of early Madonna and Kylie Minogue.<br /><br />Tracks on this album include ones about unrequited love, ex- loves, and just having fun. Guest spots (besides Owl City) include RedFoo of LMFAO and Justin Bieber.  Most songs are upbeat - it only has a few ballads.  My favorites besides (besides CMM & GT) are \\"Turn Me Up\\", \\"Tiny Little Bows\\", and \\"This Kiss\\".<br /><br />(4 ½ out of 5 stars)

B002P7UCMC|5.0|Rammstein is one of my favorite bands on the planet I own everything they own and to me all of them are great but what I like about this one is the second disc of bonus songs. I love all the songs on disc 1 but something about the songs on disc 2 make it extra special. I love the moody and emotional ampnosphere that Rammstein deliveres in their music and this cd is no exception it is flawless. Tim Lindermann is a great singer and he brings a lot of emotion into his singing whether it's a heavy song or a ballad Rammstein's music symbolizes Germany. Every song is great but my favorites are Rammlied, Fruhling In Paris, Waidmanns Heil, Ich Tu Dir Weh,and Haifisch. A true masterpiece anyone who likes Rammstein will like this album.

B005HJWWW8|4.0|This little guy is pretty amazing!!!  For being as small as an iPod Shuffle, the E6 really delivers.  I paired this thing up with my Sennheiser HD598s and it's like the heavens opened up and sang.  The Sennheiser HD598s are great, but if you're listening to them on an mp3 player like an iPod, your phone, or something similar then you need this little beast!  Mp3 player's just cannot do good headphones justice and an amp will make them sing.  Most computers cannot do great headphones justice either.  The E6 will transform your headphones and make you realize their full potential.  It's preset equalizer settings are convenient if you're new to amps and are just beginning down the slippery slope of seeking better and better audio quality.  It's small size is also very nice on your pockets too.  The battery life lasts a whole day, literally.  I listened to music in a marathon session for like a good 8 hours straight one day before this things battery gave out.  You don't have to worry about running out of juice during a normal days use unless you're on an international flight or traveling and can't get to a plug.  If you're doing a lot of traveling you might want to get a second one as a spare.  It's cheap enough where I did that anyways because you do get some feedback over it while charging.  The feedback gets worse the closer the E6 gets to finishing charging.  I'm not an electrical engineer so I can't tell you why it does that, but I wouldn't recommend listening to this while charging it.  That's the only reason this is getting 4 stars rather than five.  It's worth the money, especially if you're just getting into amps for your headphones!

The story is told alternately between the husband and wife, each taking their turn to describe the everchanging turn of events.

B007FEFLTO|2.0|About halfway through with this second of the Triology and quite honestly, I am in a quandary as I don't know if I want to finish it or leave it alone as it has so far been a disappointment.  I have been anticipating the publish date for this as much as Justin Cronins Passage story, as I was captivated by Both of these initial releases and couldn't wait to read the seconds.  So, he is not vintage Follett who wrote all the other masterpiece stories, with Pillars as my favorite of all time.  The limes seemed to drag alone to the point of feeling as though every paragraph was a contrived attempt at passing this off as interesting when you can almost anticipate what is next without any surprises and it certainly did not take much thought.  One of the reviewers here said,  it seemed like Follett did not write this, but instead supervised someone else to make the context his idea.  Who knows, but after trying to digest this one, I will not give the third one a chance, especially with that outrageous Kindle price.  This story should be priced less than the first as it certainly played second fiddle to that story.  I bought the hard copy as the price difference was so little, I can now give it to someone else and ask them to pass it around - and save someone the outrageous investment for a product seriously lacking in flow and character fulfillment expected from the first.  Oh well....to each of us, a little rain must fall.  Hope this helps as it is a fair depiction and I am a heavy reader of almost all fiction. Ciao!!
B004G600A4|4.0|Disney comes with a fresh look for their standard princess film, and a modern twist on the classic Rapunzel. It is enjoyable for kids and adults alike. It was refreshing that Disney has broken off from the stereotypical helpless princess character. Instead of a silly girl who ends up marrying a prince because he saves her, we have a real relationship that forms through teamwork. We really feel like these two care about each other as a person. And best of all, the 'princess' does some of the saving as well. Certainly Shrek beat Disney to the punch here, and the parallels on the \\"modern princess story\\" are obvious, but other than the character dynamics there is no copying going on.<br /><br />The protagonist and the antagonist are excitedly complex in this film, for a kid flick. We have a hero who doesn't really want to be a hero. A victim of neglect and abuse breaking from her bonds. The villain, a witch, isn't really an evil person at the core. She has lived for centuries by using a magic flower, which is then stolen by the kingdom and destroyed to heal the dying queen. She tries to take just a cutting of the princesses hair for her use, to keep herself alive, and only kidnaps the girl out of desperation. These characters aren't the black and white cardboard cutouts that we are used to from Snow White and Cinderella. The King, a desperate man trying to save his family, is unwittingly dooming another to death and selfishly uses a miracle healing flower for his own instead of sharing it with his kingdom. It is safe to say that these characters offer enough complexity to make it watchable for adults.<br /><br />I recommend it.

The Navy SEAL gives the reader an amazing, well written account of what life is like to be a part of this elite unit. A unit that sacrifices more in terms of life and limb than most of us even knew and in terms of family sacrifices that none of us want to admit. The author has captured the mind and heart of this reader bringing a renewed appreciation of what it is to be a warrior with a cause. The death of UBL was not an easy day, but it was just another mission, well planned and well executed.<br />Thanks for the reminder and your service!

0061537969|5.0|This is a story told by Enzo, a dog.  His master is a race car driver, and his master has a wife and they have a baby daughter.  For the first part of the book it did not appeal to me much, though I am a sucker for dog stories.  But when the plot began to develop, after his wife dies and his wife's parents seek to take the child from him it becomes a very heart-wrenching story which totally caught me up.  Maybe when one looks back at the story it seeems a bit contrived but while it is going on it is superb.  And the ending is totally satisfying.  A masterpiece indeed

0307960471|5.0|This well executed book is the latest in the series featuring Harry Hole, the former Norwegian policeman, and I believe that is the best of the lot. .Once again Harry must return from his exile in Hong Kong, this time to help the son of his former lover, who is accused of murdering a fellow junkie.<br /><br /> The book spends a lot of time detailing the grisly and gruesome life of drug addicts, which Harry knows so well from his past. He appears to have overcome his problems, except for the one that compels him to seek answers to difficult problems, even if they are not the ones he's seeking. There are fully fleshed out characters in this book, some of them good and some of them not so good. Nesbo throws around red herrings almost constantly, so the reader at times feels almost as befuddled as Harry, as he goes around searching for the truth of what happened.<br /><br /> The tension builds, there are several deaths, and the ending is a shocker for the reader (won't tell what it is, you'll have to read the book for yourself).  Needless to say, Harry Hole is an iconic figure in Scandinavian crime fiction, and Nesbo one of the best practitioners of the art of writing a finely tuned mystery. I know that you will enjoy this book as much as I did.

B000003TAL|4.0|I don't subscribe to any train of thought that this is the band's peak, or a masterpiece.  In fact the sound of the record is disappointing, and muddy.  Had this been recorded/mixed better, had it gotten the band across stronger, it'd be closer to a masterpiece.<br /><br />But it is pretty good.  The band and Thurston's Television/Tom Verlaine influence comes to the fore.  The first two-thirds of \\"Trilogy\\" sound like Marquee Moon-era Television, updated to 1988.  It's wonderful.  \\"Teenage Riot\\" crosses the Television-inspired sound with that of The Who, and it's a glorious mess as well.  A lot of the rest of this borders on a heavier, darker sound that attacks the ears, most effectively on Renaldo's \\"Eric's Trip\\" and \\"Hey Joni\\".<br /><br />I haven't yet mentioned \\"Candle\\".  It's the best track on here, beautifully structured.<br /><br />The record's a deliberate mess, and a deliberate assault on the senses.  With moments of brilliance in it.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|I enjoyed this book. It was easy to read and gave an honest account of life for a seal team member. I didn't really read anything that I haven't already heard from the media and the White House though. Good book all the same.

You fall in love with Christian Grey even though he has some major issues - some you probably won't approve of.  But all in all, I couldn't put the book down and I'm on the second one now!

0670451495|5.0|Boston Pride --- Love this story and can't wait to share it with my kids!  Beautiful illustration and story.<br /><br />I contacted Amazon about it arriving with a damaged cover -- the box must've been lying somewhere damp between the warehouse and my house (it wasn't rainy the day it arrived) and it arrived all scrunched from being wet.  I never got a response from Amazon!  Disappointed in customer service.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I just talked to a friend tonight about this app. We both love it! We both just discovered it this past week for our kindle fire,and it is excellent  and easy to navigate!! Thanks
B008HK3XYK|5.0|I ordered this with my kindle fire so I had a case to put it in right away. Its practical, looks good and easy to use, oh and should be protective! I choose the orange one, looks sharp. The kindle snaps into the case so its not going to slip out, folds to turn into a stand for viewing and reading. Must have!
0694003611|5.0|9/20/12 (also see revised review below): I've heard people rave about this book, but after reading it to my infant, I'm left a little stumped at why it's so popular.  The story isn't exceptionally good or well written.  The illustrations aren't particularly good.  Some parts of the book rhyme, and some don't, which is a bit inconsistent. Some parts don't even make sense (i.e. \\"Goodnight nothing.\\" ?????).  The only good thing about this book is that it is a board book and a good size for smaller hands.  One other good thing is my infant likes to chew on it.  :)  This book was included in a baby wash and lotion set that was gifted to us.  I would not buy this book for myself, and I would not recommend this book to a friend.  However, it's just okay if you can find it for 10 cents at a yard sale or thrift store.<br /><br />11/26/13: Now that my son is older, he won't go to sleep without reading this book.  He waves goodnight to the objects in the book and loves to point out the pictures.  He loves the red balloon, meows at the kittens, and squeaks at the mouse.  He even says \\"Yum!\\" when we get to the mush. On especially difficult nights, I even close the book and just walk around and tell him to say good night to the objects in his room which helps to calm him down and prepares him for bedtime.  Apparently, my old review just shows how much I don't know about a child's mind and shows that you shouldn't determine the value of an object for your child.  You have to let them determine the value for themselves.  Although I think this book is nothing special, my son thinks the world of it.  That is why I'm changing my review from 1 star to 5 stars.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|As an OIF III veteran, I enjoyed the author's descriptions of FOB's he has been to, experiences one soldier has while on a deployment, dialog between friends, and so forth.  I found them to be accurate in their descriptions.<br /><br />This book is one man's account of events leading up to and during one of the most important military events in recent memory.  It is not an expansive macro-look at all the intelligence particulars involved in the decision-making process at the highest levels, nor is it a highly-researched study on the rise of Osama Bin Laden and Al Quaeda or the geo-political ramifications in the aftermath of the raid into Abbottabad.  It is one man's recollection on specifics of the mission as well as some of his prior military experiences unrelated to the raid and should be read as such.  Enjoy the book for what it is.  Catch a glimpse of Navy Seal training.  Appreciate the sacrifices made by them and all military personnel in harms way.  And give thanks that there are individuals out there on our side who willingly volunteer to become soldiers at the tip of the spear.
B001MSMULG|5.0|Another great read by Silva on the<br />Gabriel Allon character. Some days are just too good to spend on work, so this is when a Gabriel Allon book enters the picture. Allon is the go-to man when a necessary job needs to be done; he acts with finesse, courage, and honor to make his space better for all. I just hope that he stays on our side.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|This book is much more than just about the elimination of Osama Bin Laden by the Navy SEALS in the operation codenamed Neptune Spear. It tells the first person story of what it's like to be a member of the elite United States Naval Special Warfare Development Group, DEVGRU also called SEAL TEAM 6. The incite into the lives and training of these SEALS is really fascinating. Could hardly put it down until finished and would think that would be the case with most readers. One humorous part in Chapter 6 was when they parachuted into the Indian Ocean to help rescue the captain of the ship Maersk Alabama. Three of the SEALS on that mission had to make what's called tandem jumps with non-jump qualified electronic specialists attached to them. It was so funny how the author described getting his guy to the edge of the ramp and then having to push him out because the guy froze up and couldn't jump.<br /><br />This is just a good story about great americans doing amazing feats of derring-do.

0525953728|5.0|A good test for a book is that my wife started reading it and I had to wait (not long!) for her to finish it.  This book covered a lot more than \\"getting UBL\\"  It pulled me right into what life would be like to join, train and become a member of the special forces.  The book was descriptive enough for me to feel like I was really there.  Perhaps the controversy and flak this book has recieved is because of his criticism of bureaucracy.  Example:  \\"...We were slapped with a new requirement to call them (the bad guys) out.  After surrounding a building, an interpreter had to get on a bullhorn and yell for the fighters to come out with their hands raised.  It was similar to what police did in the United States.  After the fighters came out, we cleared the house.  if we found guns, we arrested the fighters, only to see them go free a few months later.  Often we recaptured the same guy multiple times during a single deployment.  It felt like we were fighting the war with one hand and filling out paperwork with the other.  When we brought back detainees, there was an additional two or three hours of paperwork.  The first question to the detainee at the base was always, \\"Were you abused?'  An affirmative answer meant an investigation and more paperwork.  And the enemy had figured out the rules.  Their tactics evolved as fast as ours.  On my earlier deployments, they stood and fought.  On more recent deployments, they started hiding their weapons, knowing we couldn't shoot them if they weren't armed.  The fighters knew the rules of engagement and figured they'd just work their way through the system and be back to their village in a few days.  It was frustrating.  We knew what we were sacrificing at home; we were willing to give that up to do the job on our terms.  As more rules were applied, it bacme harder to justify taking the risks to our lives.  The job was becoming more about an exit strategy than doing the right thing tactically.\\"  pg. 141 &  142

B003YL4LYI|5.0|When ADWD came out there were many negative reviews from disgruntled readers who naively thought questions would be answered and plot lines would be resolved.  Not harboring any such delusions I enjoyed ADWD much more than the doldrums of ASOS or AFFC.  True, the plot just gets thicker.  My only fear is that GRRM might kick the bucket before finishing the anticipated 7 book series.  I hope he has confided the ending (if he knows how he plans to end it) to someone who can ghost write it if something happens. I have reread the first 4 volumes and am part way through ADWD now on kindle which is easier to hold than the hard cover.  ( Yes, I paid the extra $15.  I'm that big a fan/sucker.). I highly recommend reading the series at least twice, as there is so much more to pick up after you know the characters better and have the clarity of hindsight. This is not just a story, it's a whole other world of fantasy.  I can't wait for TWOW.
B006JP11HQ|4.0|This book is a little out of date in some areas, but it makes those parts historically interesting, giving the reader a sense of where we were and how changed things are.  What I like about the book is the thinking behind areas (such as school choice; labor union, business, and government monopolies)is presented in a clear, thought-provoking manner.  Some reviewers said to buy the more recent book, but I chose this because I wanted the detail. The author makes a cogent case for conservative approaches leading to freedom and more liberal approaches (in the American sense of liberal) leading to freedom's loss. You may not agree, but it will lead to better understanding of conservative postions, which is sadly lacking in liberals.<br /><br />I only gave this four stars because it is out of date in parts, mainly the discussion of international finance and trade, but again, it is an opener to our history and how some things have improved and others have not improved.
B0092SQBJA|4.0|Two Door Cinema Club stumbled its way into my life one day while I was listening to Pandora. I was immeadiately hooked to their catchy rhythms, indie vibes and subtle rock elements. Tourist History, their debut albulm was filled with somewhat repetitive but always enjoyable songs. Beacon, their second albulm, I must admit, did not live up to the hype. I was anticipating the same basic structure as last time, but with different variations. The first few songs on the CD are great as they posesses many of the same qualities that the successful songs from the first alblum did, but as I progressed throughout the songs, I found myself bored with some of the lyrics and rhythms. It is overall a wonderful example of indie music, but I feel as though I will be expecting more from them if they are ever to debut a third albulm in the nearby future. All told, Beacon still boasts a few catchy songs, but their creativity seems to have run dry during some numbers.
B006O99SYA|4.0|Not being a reader of fiction I decided not to buy this book even though I am interested in 'colonial' British ex-pat life in China and had heard of the unsolved Pamela Werner murder in pre-war Peking. Newspaper reviews of the book suggested to me that it was heavily fictionalised, even if well written. Publisher's hype (supported by Paul French's website) suggested that he had brilliantly solved the 75 year old murder -- another firm turn-off for me.<br /><br />However, like-minded friends who had read the paper edition strongly recommended it, if only because E T C Werner (Pamela's father) and the supposed murderer ended up together in the Japanese internment camp at Weishien in which I was also interned as a boy. So I bought the Kindle edition, which I was disappointed to find had none of the photographs of the original. It was immediately clear that the author had unearthed an amazing amount of detailed facts about the murder and its joint investigation by Chinese and British police. But it turned out that much of this had come from highly critical written reports of the police investigation by E T C Werner (a former barrister and British Consul), together with a series of reports of his own investigations, which he formally lodged with the British colonial office with repeated pleas to have the case re-opened.<br /><br />OK, that out of the way: the book is so well structured and written that it was 'a page turner' for me: a dramatic story, a fascinating cross-section of British Legation life not laid bare elsewhere to my knowledge, and a realistic snapshot of Old Peking and its tensions -- not least of which was the intrusion of the Japanese at that time. Although I thought that significant unwarranted extrapolations from the factual material were made to exaggerate scandal and dramatic tension, they were mercifully not such as to turn the book into fiction. Examples are the supposed rape of Pamela by the headmaster of her boarding school, along with her supposed pregnancy, and the ex-pat 'hunting club' that was supposed to be a front for the systematic gang-raping of a series of young white women over some years. Strangely, the activities of the club  -- which supposedly led on to murder in Pamela's case -- were never investigated or uncovered.<br /><br />I can recommend the book to anyone interested in 'colonial' China.

0525953728|5.0|I won't pretend to know the intricacies of OPSEC, but I do know a well-written and supremely engaging book when I read one.<br /><br />NO EASY DAY by \\"Mark Owen\\" and Kevin Maurer is just such a book. Often it's hard for military authors to get across their thoughts and experiences to civilians because they often live a life almost alien to us. Which leads to some often confusing literature. Not the case with NO EASY DAY. Mark (perhaps Kevin) recalls his time as a DEVGRU operator with impeccable clarity, humbleness, and passion. He also does a great job of setting up the UBL raid to draw you in and then flashes back to his years and missions leading back around to the event. A literary trick that is pulled off to great effectiveness in some of Kevin Maurer's other books and is perfected within NO EASY DAY.<br /><br />It's a book I think is important to share with friends and family. We know the end result, but we often forget there are men, and women, with their own stories, lives, passions, and families who are behind it.<br /><br />Come for the recounting of a mission that is dear to so many American's hearts but stay for the story behind the man and the Team. Real heroes.<br /><br />PLUS: The Teams are a bunch of BAMF's ;)<br /><br />-Mitch Gerads<br />  Co-creator/Illustrator of \\"The ACTIVITY\\" from IMAGE Comics.

B007J4T2G8|2.0|I only read this book because I criticized it on Facebook and got a lot of backlash for doing so without reading it. But over all I think I was right. Its not well written. It is set in American but the characters talk, act and eat (and drink) like there  British. I also find it completely unbelievable that this girl never had an e-mail address even though she is a college graduate! There is nothing romantic about this very powerful man becoming obsessed with this girl to the point of tracking her location from her cell phone only days after meeting her. This kind of behavior should not be romanticized. I would be teaching my daughters to call the police if this happened to them. Also Anna kept her virginity for 20 something years just to give it up to this very strange man after knowing him for what, a week? I call BULLSHIT!!! Are we are supposed to believe that she is a collage graduate and a complete idiot??? Because thats the vibe I'm getting from Miss Anna Steele. I could go on for hours but I think this other review I read really sums it up. So Ill copy and paste and thanks DS from LA for saving me the time.<br /><br /> I have discovered that Ana says \\"Jeez\\" 81 times and \\"oh my\\" 72 times. She \\"blushes\\" or \\"flushes\\" 125 times, including 13 that are \\"scarlet,\\" 6 that are \\"crimson,\\" and one that is \\"stars and stripes red.\\" (I can't even imagine.) Ana \\"peeks up\\" at Christian 13 times, and there are 9 references to Christian's \\"hooded eyes,\\" 7 to his \\"long index finger,\\" and 25 to how \\"hot\\" he is (including four recurrences of the epic declarative sentence \\"He's so freaking hot.\\"). Christian's \\"mouth presses into a hard line\\" 10 times. Characters \\"murmur\\" 199 times, \\"mutter\\" 49 times, and \\"whisper\\" 195 times (doesn't anyone just talk?), \\"clamber\\" on/in/out of things 21 times, and \\"smirk\\" 34 times. Christian and Ana also \\"gasp\\" 46 times and experience 18 \\"breath hitches,\\" suggesting a need for prompt intervention by paramedics. Finally, in a remarkable bit of symmetry, our hero and heroine exchange 124 \\"grins\\" and 124 \\"frowns\\"... which, by the way, seems an awful lot of frowning for a woman who experiences \\"intense,\\" \\"body-shattering,\\" \\"delicious,\\" \\"violent,\\" \\"all-consuming,\\" \\"turbulent,\\" \\"agonizing\\" and \\"exhausting\\" orgasms on just about every page.ry, our hero and heroine exchange 124 \\"grins\\" and 124 \\"frowns\\"... which, by the way, seems an awful lot of frowning for a woman who experiences \\"intense,\\" \\"body-shattering,\\" \\"delicious,\\" \\"violent,\\" \\"all-consuming,\\" \\"turbulent,\\" \\"agonizing\\" and \\"exhausting\\" orgasms on just about every page.
B00008S7KC|3.0|This DVD updates the original (still on special features) 60 minute music documentary by adding 30 minutes of uncomfortable interviews with the band and some studio rehearsals, all in black and white.  They add little to nothing to the music, in fact, detracts from the flow of the otherwise good video.<br /><br />While the original was in a 4:3 aspect ratio, director Adrian Maben expands the \\"Director's Cut\\" to an anamorphic 16:9 wide screen.  While it fills the screen, some cropping is noticeable.  The scenes shot in the ruins of Pompeii are well done and the music sounds fine even in a Dolby Stereo mode.  This particular version seems to be the only one around these days and it was made for Region 3 so adhere to the Amazon warning.  I tried to play it on several DVD and Blu ray players, all of which spit it out.  I did find out it will play in my desktop and laptop computers as well as an Xbox 360.  The disc also includes a documentary, Pompeii maps and history, lyrics, photos, graphics and more.

B007AGM59G|4.0|\\"Northanger Abbey\\" was published after Jane Austen's death, based on a draft manuscript the famous romance novelist may have started when she was quite young, and periodically revised.  The title was chosen by her brother.  It is a broad parody of the Gothic romances that were wildly popular in Austen's day.  Austen plays with the genre in clever ways, yet manages to work in a charming love story, perhaps slightly tongue in cheek.<br /><br />Austen's heroine is Catherine Morland, a naive young country girl much addicted to gothic novels herself.  When she is offered the opportunity to visit the great resort city of Bath with wealthy friends of her family, she immediately falls into bad company.  The situation is redeemed by her friendship with the respectable Henry and Eleanor Tilney, who invite her to visit their ancient and mysterious family home of Northanger Abbey.  There, Catherine will find herself enmeshed in a dark plot right out of one of her novels.  Can Catherine unravel the tragedy of the Abbey?  Will her budding romance with a young man survive her visit? Will fans of Jane Austen read the novel to find out (and enjoy the illustrations)?  \\"Northanger Abbey\\" is not Jane Austen's best work, but it is highly recommended to her fans.

B003XF1XOQ|3.0|I would like to start this review stating that the first two books were not reviewed and to be fair with my rating I would like to mention that both past books in my opinion get 5 stars. The story is really good, yes it uses scenarios or instances used in other books or stories but the part that got me to like them were the characters, the ease of read, and the story itself.<br /><br />The third book on the other hand I feel it should have been shorter, it easily has half the book of \\"fill up\\" material, it made me feel like I wanted to skip a couple of chapters all together but I kept on reading. The characters and how the story unveils is why this book is a must read if you need closure to the epic story.<br /><br />It is not comparable to the past books I felt this one was dull at some points, I wont mention how I think it should be or what I didn't like in terms of spoilers, but I felt this book lacked the same intensity and writing quality as the past two books.

B003YFIUW8|5.0|This was the most compelling and interesting book that I've read in a long time. A combination of a page-turning crime novel and an exploration of the mother-child relationship, the book kept me up half the night reading because I just couldn't put it down.<br /><br />Told through the eyes of 5-year old Jack, the narration is interesting and the descriptions of life through Jack's eyes are refreshing. Despite the subject matter (which could be very dark), telling the story through Jack's eyes allows the reader to be taken through the experience without the sense of despair that these books often hold. In fact, there is a theme of hope throughout, as well as the ability to see the world (good and bad) through a totally different perspective.<br /><br />A great read, I heartily recommend it. (But plan for long reading sessions, you won't want to put it down once you start).
0525953728|5.0|This is a suspenseful, first-person account of the raid that took down Osama bin Laden in May, 2011.  The author, writing under the pseudonym of Mark Owen, was one of the elite SEAL Team Six operators that participated in the raid (his real name has since been revealed as Matt Bissonnette).  The book debuted at number one on Amazon.  It does not disappoint.<br /><br />The first half of No Easy Day covers Bissonnette's work in SEAL Team Six prior to the Osama bin Laden raid.  After a cliffhanger opening that anticipates the climax of the book, the story backs up several years to Bissonnette's Green Team training.  He was already a Navy SEAL at this point, but he was trying to become a member of the elite Seal TEAM Six, which is composed of the \\"best of the best.\\"  We follow his deployments in both Iraq and Afghanistan, where the recounting of certain missions serves to establish the proficiency of the author and his team at their job.  This is rather standard fare for the subgenre.<br /><br />The latter half of the book is devoted to the raid on Osama bin Laden's compound, including the extensive preparations and some of the political aftermath.  The actual raid is told in almost moment-by-moment detail, transporting the reader to the compound in Abbottabad.  The scene is described so richly that it feels as though we are climbing the stairs with the team as they close in on bin Laden.  Several maps and charts help us to picture the location.<br /><br />No Easy Day focuses almost exclusively on Bissonnette's training and deployments.  We learn very little about his personal life, which--combined with his intentional pseudonymity--makes it harder to connect with him emotionally.  This information was omitted for obvious security reasons.  He does share the toll that SEAL life takes on family life, however.  \\"Many of my teammates suffered through bitter divorces.  We missed weddings, funerals, and holidays.  We couldn't tell the Navy no, but we could tell our families no.  And we did often. . . . Work was always the number one priority.  It took everything out of you and gave back very little. . . . everything else in the world took a backseat\\" (106-7).  For those wanting a fuller portrait of a Navy SEAL's personal life, see the excellent book by Eric Blehm, [[ASIN:0307730697 Fearless: The Undaunted Courage and Ultimate Sacrifice of Navy SEAL Team SIX Operator Adam Brown]], which details the life of SEAL Team Six operator Adam Brown.<br /><br />Bissonnette does not engage in self-aggrandizement or bravado, which has marred some earlier books by former Navy SEALs.  The author seems to have a realistic view of himself.  He says at one point: \\"I am not unique or special\\" (298).  He does not hesitate to share instances in combat when he was afraid or made a mistake.  He occasionally engages in self-deprecating humor.  He regularly dishes out praise for his teammates.  Bissonnette says that today's SEALs have \\"evolved past being egomaniacs\\" (289).  Such professionalism is appreciated.<br /><br />Bissonnette states in the introduction that he has sanitized the book so that it presents no threat to national security.  The identities of those involved are masked; special tactics and technology are not revealed; and certain information is generalized.  The author says, \\"If you are looking for secrets, this is not your book\\" (x).  Yet none of these precautions affect the impact of the book.  There is still enough specific information to make the action riveting.<br /><br />Despite Bissonnette's precautions, the book is nonetheless generating controversy.  Some special operators have challenged his decision to reveal details about the mission, breaking their traditional code of silence.  The Department of Defense has threatened to sue because he did not present the book to the Pentagon for inspection prior to publication.  The author has responded by pointing out that many people, from the President on down, have revealed details about themission.  He says, \\"If my commander in chief is willing to talk, then I feel comfortable doing the same\\" (298).  He claims that everything in the book has already appeared in other unclassified sources (xi).  I for one am glad that the book was released.  It shows that those who commit acts of terror will suffer retribution--perhaps even deadly retribution--for their evil.  This should serve as a warning to our enemies.<br /><br />At the end of the book are the names of those SEALs who have paid the ultimate price since September 11, 2001.  Bissonnette claims that he is donating the majority of the proceeds from the book to charities that support the families of these fallen Navy SEALs.  He encourages readers to donate as well.<br /><br />The book is well-written and a page-turner.  Even though the outcome of the book was already known, it maintains a high degree of suspense throughout to see how the situation actually played out.  I read it in one sitting.  Highly recommended.mission.  He says, \\"If my commander in chief is willing to talk, then I feel comfortable doing the same\\" (298).

B00913DPW2|4.0|I thought I was pretty adept at these sorts of games, but The Haunt is really tough! I only got through the first couple of scenes and then was lost. I printed out the walkthrough (all 14 pages of it) and was able to progress through the game following each step. It didn't seem too scary to me, just sort of creepy. Each scene is detailed and challenging, you need to think in order to progress. However, the story and actions are disjointed. I couldn't figure out why some things worked the way they did, and certain story elements just made no sense at all. I never in a million years would be able to play the game without the walkthrough.<br /><br />There is also a jigsaw puzzle you assemble from hidden pieces in the scenes. I had trouble finding some of the pieces but after I found the flashlight (towards the beginning of the game), I turned it on and went back to the scenes with the hidden puzzle pieces and was able to find them.<br /><br />This game is a challenge, no matter your skill level.  It was NOT easy and took me a long time to finish, even while using the walkthrough. I can't compare it to any of the other games in this genre because it is so different, but I do feel it's one of those that you'll either love or hate.
0525952926|1.0|I can't wait to read this book, when my turn at my local library comes.  The price of the Kindle edition is extortion (I realize not amazon's fault) and I refuse to pay it.  So I will wait and read it for free.  Shame on the publisher and/or the author.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I use this at Church because a large Bible gets too heavy to hold for very long. I also use it at home as well because  of the large number of translations. when I run across a difficult verse I simply look through a number of different translations and get a better overview of the intent of the verse. I also use Matthew Henry's commentary and Vine's Expository Dictionary. This Bible and these Bible helps have made my study of God's Word easier and more profitable.

0857685848|3.0|\\"Dinosaur Art\\". Excited to hear it and simultaneously I was put off by the simplicity of the title. Couldn't the author or publisher come up with something more imaginative? More all-encompassing considering there's more than just dinosaurs here? I know the reason - search engine purposes. Dinosaur Art is so broad it's bound to turn up and lure buyers.<br />To subtitle it \\"The World's Greatest Paleoart\\" took some moxy considering with ten artists they just scratched the surface. Anyone thinking this is a critical overview or covers the comprehensive evolution of paleoart is mistaken. No such book exists (not even books by Rudwick, Davidson or Debus). This project was a paleofan's wish to compile his current favorite artists in one book, and probably have an excuse of speaking to them. So what you have is contemporary dinosaur art padded out with some basic Q & A.<br />I found the selection too Eurocentric. But what do you expect from a UK publisher? If you have wondered, where are the North American giants Mark Hallett? Larry Felder? James Gurney? Michael Skrepnick? Bill Stout? Karen Carr? Bob Walters? David Peters? Carl Buell? What about the Southern Hemisphere - Jorge Blanco? Peter Trusler? Some of these and others were approached by the author but there were space limits and disagreements about licensing/payments/royalties.<br />Let's hope a second volume can be produced with those or others, if Titan feels this one is successful. Dinosaur art books are always risky. Until then you have your Prehistoric Times interviews to fill in much of the same profiles.<br /><br />Busy busy Phil Currie seems to be the first call paleontologist on these art books (see Dinosaur Imagery) and his foreword this time out seems generic, canned. No remarks are made about specific artists or their art, and nothing in it suggests he even saw so much as even a rough preview of this book.<br />Scott \\"Dino Train\\" Sampson was asked to write the introduction. It's clear he at least did review the book or the artwork.<br />Why Prehistoric Times' editor Mike Fredericks is credited is curious too. For an advance \\"thanks\\" for forthcoming praise/plugging in his magazine?<br /><br />These are tinted versions of b/w Gregory Paul drawings we have seen in Paul's Predatory Dinosaurs of the World. The Jurassic scene is in front, the Cretaceous in back, but the credits say otherwise.  I noticed some of the publication years are not right too. The resting Deinonychus pair at night, reprinted here fairly small, is listed as being from 1987 but it's from 1980. Historically that makes a difference.<br /><br />Perhaps the scope of the book was narrower than I would have liked but I feel there should have been at least a bibliography listing books or works by the artist. Many books are cited throughout the interviews and it would have been a no-brainer to try to list these at the end.  We do get a glossary and a timeline which was considerate. I wish that the author had compiled an index of dinosaurs by different artists which would have been helpful and a list of winners of the Lanzendorf award would have been a good historical document.<br /><br />Only Sibbick, Henderson, Marshall and Martin offer up any preliminary sketches for comparison to the final product and they are very revealing. Henderson and Paul both still have their childhood dinosaur art. As I have seen some of these I personally think people would have gotten a kick out of them.<br />A comparison of the same genus on one page by different artists (something practiced in Prehistoric Times)would have been immensely useful.<br /><br />The two page historical narrative overview lacks a comprehensive highlighting of breakthroughs in paleoart. Artists of the past like Neave Parker, William Scheele, Margaret Colbert, etc are not mentioned at all. Bakker's seminal running Deinonychus is not mentioned. No pictures of Knight, Burian, Zallinger and Matternes. All we get is the usual Waterhouse Hawkins Crystal Palace Iguanodon photo. That is the extent of the \\"history\\". Reading the history one would never know the contributions of Eleanor Kish - the first paleo painter of any merit since Burian, John Guche - the first photorealist dino artist, Bill Stout who arguably gave us the first true dino art book - and Mark Hallett - the man who coined this term 'Paleoart'.<br /><br />Wisely the author admits the 'popular perception damage' movies like Jurassic Park and its ilk have caused. Today's generation have strong childhood memories of these films and many don't mind which is problematic to real workers in the field.<br /><br />Onto the Artist Pages...<br />We don't get any but photos of the artists could have added value. Some of the author's questions get predictable (\\"why the move to digital?\\", \\"favorite dinosaur to restore?\\") especially considering the answers are mostly the same. Asked to cite influences, virtually all roads lead back to the original Dinosaur Renaissance men Robert Bakker and Greg Paul. The author could have probed certain artists put lips on dinosaurs, or \\"shrinkwrap\\" heads (where fenestrae in the skulls are overly defined as if it had mummified, sunken skin), for instance.<br /><br />1 - Julius Csotonyi (Canada). I could see why - his answers are lengthy, passionate and deeply informed - particularly insightful on coloration theory. What a heavy hitter: academic credentials and digital mastery. (All you budding artists have your work cut out for you!) His dead Brachylophosaurus on a sandbar is one for the ages but I confess seeing the other mixed media/digital paintings were underwhelming. Some just don't work technically, some look just as phony as any oil painting.<br />2 - Gregory Paul (US) should have been first considering he is called the most influential of all the paleoartists. If you have Greg's coffee table art book or the Princeton Field Guide, then you pretty much have seen all the b/w and color pieces here. This book does not have some of Greg's best color work and the ones here are `flat' which is ok considering it's been seen before in other books. I know the double page dryosaurs are not well reproduced. If you want them in higher fidelity look in Greg's coffee table art book. The Chinese Shunosaurus/Gasosaurus scene in Dinosaur Art is marred by canvas/texture lines.<br />3 - Mauricio Anton (Spain) breaks up the dinomonotony (one reason the book should have been called something different.) The author calls Anton the leading artist of paleo mammals but Don Prothero or Carl Buell may disagree. Anton is amazing, a first tier artist. He eloquently explains how he came to concentrate on mammals instead of dinosaurs. His b/w work is soft and exquisite, rivaling that of his own color digital work. Unfortunately I found the double page reproductions poor quality. They just seem too murky. Anton's dinosaurs - not his strength - are not here, making this chapter feel out of place.<br />4 - Doug Henderson (US). Now here we have a case of an artist whose work we all probably have many times over in different books. I don't think there's any stuff you have not seen, save for a museum commission or two, if you have kept up with this ebay store prints. Seven pictures in this chapter are landscapes without dinosaurs or any prehistoric fauna at all. Henderson is pretty candid about the state of paleoart these days.<br />5 - Todd Marshall (US). Frankly I think Mark Hallett should have been right here. Todd's second tier work looks like movie concept art will either be broadly appealing or visually unappealing, and for me it's the latter. I can't wrap my head around those shrinkwrapped heads with tons of fuzz and integument, or the sloppy brushstrokes of his color work. Todd speaks as he renders (read; digressive) doesn't make much of backgrounds and heads and bodies are not equal in detail. It simply doesn't hold up as zoological illustration (Paul Sereno must have not found the *right* artist yet, as there's a revolving door of right hand men he has used over the years.) Todd's enthusiasm in his interview spills over into fanboydom with odd namedropping of heroes in cinema and rock and roll. A gaming designer by day, I was happy to see he agrees that traditional art is still the most satisfying.<br />6 - John Sibbick (UK). Say what you want about Sibbick being a great painter. The truth is no one worth their salt ever copied John's dinosaurs because they were never right to begin with. Greg Paul's most outdated work still looks good after 30 years but Sibbick's doesn't. Why is that? Because Sibbick, as with most of the 70s British dino artists, was never on the leading edge; he was very much an interpreter. And it's clear in this interview that he *knows* he was never a revolutionary, and never tried to be. All his dinosaurs have feet on the ground like nearly every outdated image of dinosaurs we can think of.  He has been the guy that publishers love because his work looks like the dinosaurs they remember from childhood, plus there's no arguments with publishers from John. If publishers want bulbous, balloon dinosaurs, John always had them. He knows how to capture, albeit softly, every dewdrop, every accent of light, every leaf vein seems to be accounted for but the main stars of the piece - the dinosaurs -were always lacking.  There's a misty fantasy element to his backgrounds. I am reminded of children's books illustrated by Rudolph Zallinger. In this book we only see Sibbick's latter day work that could easily be mistaken for Mark Hallett's. It's the non-dinosaurs which Sibbick has a bit more finesse with. Note that Peter Trusler is mentioned as one of his favorite modern artists - one of the best around - so where is he in this book? If you are a Sibbick fan, you will enjoy his oddly contorted Scelidosaurus maquette and sketches.<br />7 - Luis Rey (UK) comes across a tad revisionist, as if he was a late arrival to the Dinosaur Renaissance. When you come down to the facts he really he is Post-Renaissance (if you were published from 1975-1985 and \\"broke ground\\" you can call yourself part of it; I'd say David Peters was more present and contributed more in the late 80s than Rey.) Rey's trademark is relatively colorful, dare I say cartoonish. Rey's influence cannot be denied. A look around the net will turn up all manners of clownish looking paleoart. Compared to Csotonyi or Martin's work, Rey's mixed media has a ways to go. If familiar with his work you will recognize the same works from other publications. The skin texture on the throat area of Rey's Stegosaurus (2007) look too crocodilian. The scales on Triceratops are not what the fossilized skin show. The back porcupine quills - perhaps at his consultant Robert Bakker's request - look ludicrous. I predict eye and ear positions will be errant as well in future works if Bob is advising...<br />Rey claims he has virtually stopped collecting books for their dino art due to stagnation and overuse of effects (digital, presumably) in the form. However, his own style is a study in excess.<br />8 - John Conway (UK) sure likes his dinosaurs very Greg Paul-ian with very similar spaciousness, simplicity. His interview shows great humility as he is inching towards his own style.<br />9 - Robert Nicholls (UK) seems at home recreating marine environments. This chapter is easily the weakest part of the book. Compare the albertosaur attacked by Deinosuchus from Nicholls to Martin's (on the cover). I hate to say it but this is the type of art we see in secondtier paleo books.<br />10 - With Raul Martin (Spain) it seems that either the author or publisher both felt they saved the 'best' for last. Indeed it's Martin's art (recently used on a cover of Prehistoric Times) that made the cover. The hardships Martin felt in Spain developing his technique is expressed well. Ever the tough reporter, unless unaware, the author spares Martin the embarrassing questions about his plagiaristic past (check out a little bestseller called \\"National Geographic Dinosaurs\\" by Martin Barrett). A book like this should have been the ultimate place to apologize and clear his name. Martin admits he uses Greg Paul's skeletons and it's obvious in the few reproduced concept sketches. Martin has steered clear of restoring original scenes with stegosaurs, a question on why he has would have been intelligent. Martin seems very open and willing to share and his professionalism is not questioned. He will likely show up in many books of this ilk to come.<br /><br />As much as some artists - both first and second tier - hate to admit as such - this book is yet another reminder that their road to restoration leads back to Greg Paul's drawings. Not what I hoped it would be contentwise it is still a handsome book and fun to look through.lving door of right hand men he has used over the years.)

B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I was torn about reading this book for a few weeks but after I ran out of other titles I was semi interested in, I took the plunge. This was a very good book and I was not disappointed. The emotional roller coaster was worth it and I can't wait for \\"Walking Disaster\\" to come out, as well as the movie for this book. It's been a few weeks since I finished the book but I still think about Travis Maddox and Pidge from time to time. That's how much this story is still affecting me. If you are looking for an easy read and something that will leave a lasting impression, give this book a shot.

B000SEIBB8|5.0|This is a great book. I read it more than 10 times but still feel I need to read it from time to time. I bought the paper copy before and now bought the kindle version so I don't need to carry the book all the time
B008IJT0CE|5.0|Whether you suffer from occasional insomnia or chronic sleep deprivation, this app really works. I have difficulty staying asleep -- if I wake up during the night, I can't go back to sleep. Since I've been using this application regularly, I wake up less, sleep longer and feel more rested when I wake up in the morning.<br /><br />The User Interface is simple and elegant -- even technophobes will have no difficulty personalizing the application -- and it works perfectly on the Kindle Fire. With a little experimentation combining sounds, users will have no difficulty finding those that soothe, relax and lull them to sleep. With repeated, long-term use users are able to reprogram and reinforce the simple but all-important routines and rituals that signal our bodies and minds it is time to disengage so we can experience rejuvenation and cellular renewal that only quality sleep can provide.<br /><br />The sound combinations are almost endless, and users should take some time to explore the many combinations that are possible before dismissing the effectiveness of the application or the profound importance of simple, consistent routines to take us where we need to go in order to heal from and reverse the impact of environmental, emotional, intellectual and spiritual stressors that keep us from getting a good night's sleep. My personal favorite is a combination of waves and windchimes.<br /><br />Once you find your favorite combination, the application saves it. There are preset timers, but you can also set a custom timer -- a feature that has made this app extremely effective in my case. As I mentioned earlier, my challenge has been to stay asleep and with the custom timer I'm able to set the sounds for all night so when I do wake up I'm able to go right back to sleep. After using this app for three months I rarely wakeup before it's time to get up.<br /><br />The paid version provides additional features that those who practice meditation might find useful. However, thefree version has adequately addressed my needs as a previously incurable insomniac. All my best regards to the developers and Amazon for making the application available and effective.

0345803485|4.0|I bought this book for my kindle accidentally on a very strange drunk night. I am a 21 year old straight male and really do not read this sort of genre (although what I do like really wasn't that far off... Chuck Palahniuk-esque, at times). So I'm coming from a really nice vantage point to press out a review.<br /><br />The good:<br />* It's rare that books take me two nights to complete. I read slowly and generally give up on books that don't hook me in the first 5 chapters.<br />* I can relate. Not with the kinky stuff - but the Dominance issues, selfishly - as well as the inner-workings of an innocent mind... I think that's what the book, on a personal level, gave to me. It was the relation to characters I had - the fact that I felt like I knew each and every one of them (also falls in \\"the bad\\" section)<br />* No twists or cliffhangers! It could have been one book... Halfway through, I was expecting the guy to be a vampire or a figment of her imagination, or her brother or something... Not at all! (Unless it happens in the next two books, in which case I will burn these books... Although I only have them in electronic form...)<br />* It was simple. A child could understand it (well, a sexually knowledgeable - british accented - confused child)<br />* It wasn't that intense, which I find as a good thing for the mood of the story. The innocence of the girl made everything seem so exotic and kinky - but in all reality, if people reading this think it's all that screwed up: I am pretty damn screwed up...<br /><br />The bad:<br />* Characters (mentioned in the good) - they were really cut and paste, stereotypical monotypes. Anyone could relate to any of them because they were just so damn basic! (With the exception of Christian, because either the author has no idea what goes on in a man's mind - or she's completely spot on...)<br />* Reality. Sorry British woman, spend some more time in America. No one phones, we CALL (hell, we hardly even do that anymore). As the same age as the main character here, I can honestly say that we do not email that stuff... Texting is far more relevant to the masses these days, especially those not within the corporate world yet.<br />* I don't honestly have a reason for giving this 4 stars... I like it, but don't know why. There is nothing likeable about this book, I think it just lucked out in my opinion. Would I recommend this to people? Heck no. Would I read it again? Not a chance. Would I read the next one? Currently am. Do I like it better? No. That's the bad part... It's just not good.<br /><br />Overall, this review makes no sense - it's vague and scattered, and puts down the book far more than praise it, but it wholeheartedly deserves 4 out of 5 for me. For anyone else, I'll assume you will give it a 2 or a 3 at best, unless this is the only book you've read in the past six years... It hit me personally, and for that - I liked it.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|I'm addicted to Downton Abbey.  I'm addicted to the dialogue, to the fashion, to the twists and turns of life in the Grantham realm.  I love the show for the values that it promotes - values long forgotten and exchanged for the seemingly more exciting lives of housewives and misguided youth.  So bring back the times when people lived and died for honour.  When every person's ultimate battle, rich or poor, consisted of enlarging the good and bright, and diminishing the dark and evil in his being. Visually, there is little on international television that can compete with the magnificent production, editing and cinematography of Downton Abbey.  It is just visual excellence, from Day One.  I am soooo looking forward to Matthew and Mary's wedding....

B005UBNKZG|5.0|Since replacing my Motherboard, CPU and RAM,  my system has been performing above what I had expected.  I ordered all items from Amazon, and received them promptly and in one case ahead of schedule.<br /><br />System was built with the following items which Amazon can provide:<br />1) Gigabyte 970A-D3<br />2) AMD 8120 8-core CPU<br />3) 32gig of 1600mhz Ram<br />4 & 5) Regular PCI cards which were only ports I had left to fill, Cards add Sata II, USB3, IDE and E-Sata ports to system allowing me also to setup Raid Arrays.<br /><br />All in all, this was one of the most significant upgrades to my system,  The AMD 8120, allows me to multitask like I couldn't before (I had a tri core CPU). As well as multitasking, I can still have all  addition services running in background, allowing my Game PC to also be my Homes Networked DVR/ Multimedia Streaming PC.<br /><br />AMD rules, I hope they keep up the good work!
B0045EJY90|5.0|The Teac CD player CD-650 plays back CDs spot on. I was using a DVD player for CD play back which does fine job. A dedicated CD player does a better job period. The DAC in this unit are a nice upgrade, I also believe single disc players plays CDs better than multi CD disc players. This CD player is a winner.
1616614609|5.0|Many people will compare Android: Netrunner to Magic: The Gathering simply because they share the same creator. They would be right to compare the two, and ultimately Netrunner takes the cake as the best of the two. It is a great revamp of a classic, and there is nothing more fun than tricking your opponent into making a run on you.<br /><br />Really, I can't recommend this product enough. I'll take ten!

B000VRNCGQ|5.0|If you remember \\"Blind Faith\\", you'll love it as you did when it was released. If you don't remember, buy it! With Eric Clapton, Steve Winwood, Ginger Baker, and Rick Gretch you can't go wrong. This album was the logical progression from \\"Spencer Davis Group\\" to \\"Traffic\\" for Winwood. \\"Cream\\" had broken up shortly before this was recorded, so Clapton and Baker were still in perfect form. Never have heard from Gretch again, but he was an excellent bassist and a perfect fit for this group. BUY IT!!!
B003QTUQGU|1.0|There's nothing wonderful about Tim Burton's adaption of Alice's Adventures In Wonderland; a fantasy novel by Lewis Carroll. It's one of the most popular children's stories American culture has to offer. I remember attending a stage-play version of it back in elementary school. But I don't remember it being this bad.<br /><br />This is a movie without a clear plotline. The visuals; the costumes and set designs that make-up Wonderland; are artsy and imaginative. That's one thing a Tim Burton presentation virtually guarantees. But the story, which lands a girl named Alice in an impossible dreamworld of sorts, fails to captivate or even intrigue.<br /><br />Even worse is the characterization. I especially hate Johnny Depp as the incredibly annoying Mad Hatter and the cringe-inducing \\"futterwacken\\" dance he does, which an otherwise likeable Alice mimics near the end. It's just so stupid and pointless, as is the whole movie. Shame on Tim Burton for ruining childhood memories.<br /><br />marcellee.com
B0035JRVBO|5.0|I absolutely love this movie, it's such a wonderful film based on the novel of the same name. Tom Hanks is great as Forrest Gump, from speech to mannerisms, makes one appreciate those who have autism or other special needs. The product arrived in excellent time and plays wonderfully. I encourage anyone to watch this movie, to keep an open mind about those with special needs.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I have read lots of books and very rarely do I think \\"WOW! This is just a horrible book!\\" This is exactly what I am thinking about this book! I'm not going to waste any more of my time on this book. Or the others after this one.<br />If anyone asks you if you read the books or want to read them just reply No Thank You! and save yourself  some suffering.<br /><br />Also, I tried to lend this book to someone that did not believe me that it is rubbish and the publisher has disabled \\"lending\\" of this book. I have also heard they are planning on raising the price. I am very unhappy with the fact they disabled lending. I paid full price for this book and if I want to lend it (like any other book) I should have that option. I feel ripped off in every way.

1416575464|2.0|Yeah... I was really looking forward to this book.  My only experience with domino was that I picked up their last issue about simple remodel techniques at the grocery store .  I absolutely LOVED that mag.  And, since it doesn't come out very often and I saw they had a pretty thick book out, there was no question whether to get it.<br /><br />Reasons I didn't like the book:<br />1. I was expecting even more in-depth advice than the magazine gives, but this offered the same level one-liners, some of which were in the mag.  I thought this was going to be my one-stop shop to get a solid foundation in home designing.  Obviously not like a professional interior designer, but some kind of snazzy tricks to navigate furniture placement, balance, unity, etc.  But the \\"tricks\\" section was alarmingly short, that when totaled probably gives you less than even a slim magazine, with mostly lack-luster ideas like: \\"A desk can double as a bedside table\\"!<br /><br />2. Most of the book was not what I could relate to.  The book is laid out into chapters covering all the types of rooms you'd find in a house.  There are about 4 different styles within each room explained.  I usually only liked one style, so I didn't even read those other ones.  The explanations of the styles are short, just a few paragraphs and not much substance at all.  You would have a hard time taking the little info an re-creating it on your own.<br /><br />Then there is a section covering different names of the \\"big-ticket\\" items of each room (bed, sink, desk, etc.).  This just lets you identify what an upholstered bed is versus a baroque or country swedish bed.  Eh, okay...<br /><br />The next section I found gave me a headache every time I tried to delve into it.  That section is called, \\"how to mix and match.\\"  Although not an interior decorator myself, I was a fine arts major, have a pretty good aesthetic, and usually can understand design instruction and themes.  This mix and match section really did my headin and I think it was unfair to include it.  It's completely over the top.  They take (for instance in the bedroom section) a bed, nightstand, linen design, armoire, and lamp.  Then they say why the one-off items they photographed work together.  But their \\"why they work\\" column is so outrageous, I have no idea how anyone would come away knowing how to create such such maddening looks as \\"classic 1930s handsomeness,\\" \\"warm yet cool,\\" and \\"ladylike tailoring and playful touches.\\"<br /><br />There were a couple of other unhelpful sections.  They only used domino employee homes for the vast majority of interior pics.  And in a particular section they do a before and after of an employee's room.  There's a page dedicated to what few snippets of inspiration they had, like a magazine photo, a flower bouquet, and a paint chip, and then you flip the page to see the final design.  Again, how am I supposed to get that look?<br /><br />All in all, I was expecting much more than I got.  I finished it cover to cover (omitting reading the mix and match section and styles that I did not gravitate to) in just two evenings.  And I do have a few one-liners I can take away, like how a ginormous wall hanging will anchor any arrangement of other frames, It really did not feel like the interior aficionado editors at domino considered the novice reader who is buying the book to figure out how to decorate.  It felt more like eye candy for interior people who don't need much to gather their own inspiration, and just want little pin-ups to have for future reference.  This book in no way gave me the resources to \\"create a home that makes me happy,\\" unfortunately.  I would go with the magazine subscription next time.

So dull it is painful!!!!! What the heck was Lee Child thinking???<br /><br />And once again in A Wanted Man we are reminded that Jack Reacher is  bigger than life, 6'5\\", arms that almost drag on the floor when he sits in a chair...I keep thinking what kind of special effects are they going to use to convince people that Tom Cruise IS Jack Reacher?<br /><br />I am waiting for Nelson DeVille's new John Corey book, The Panther to be released Oct. 16.  If you haven't read any of DeMille's John Corey books you should, you will love him he is a \\"Reacher type creature\\"!!!!

B0017P7MOO|5.0|This album has been a real good kind of problem for me. It's so musically and lyrically interesting I end up playing it over and over again. So much so that I end up removing it from my player so I can make time for other things. And yet, six months after purchasing it it's found it's way back onto my player nearly every week and is there right now. I simply can't stop listening to it. Each time I do I hear new things that I missed before. Lyrics once obscure fall into place for me: \\"We kissed like we invented it.\\" or \\"There's a hole in my neighborhood down which of late I cannot help but fall.\\" These seemed a bit over-worked when I first heard them but somehow now - after all these hearing - they resonate. And that's a good thing. And the hooks... those damnable hooks. They're not pop. They're not formulaic. But they get stuck in my mind all the same and I find myself whistling or humming them as I work or wait for an elevator or brush my teeth. I came here to buy the other five albums from Elbow. I will buy them unheard on the strength of this album alone. Even if they don't come close to Seldom Seen Kid, I won't mind. I want this band to have my money and I want them to make more music.

B008MG1E4A|5.0|This is a well written, fast paced story of the assault on the Bin Laden compound in Pakistan. But it is much more than that, it is also the story of courageous men that choose to run towards danger in defense of our country's freedoms. It is a story, told by one of the Seal team members, of the training, dedication and sacrifices made every day as they prepare themselves for some of the most challenging life threatening situations that are faced by the men and women of our armed services. Regardless of how you feel about the war in Irag or Afganistan, you have to admire the commitment, patriotism and teamwork that is achieved in support of the American mission. Thanks to all of the men and women who serve our country.
0385344333|4.0|(Goodreads copy) ::Spoiler toward the end of my review!!!!!:: I guess I should begin with that is my first Reacher novel... Others have said I should start from the beginning from mentioning winning the book. I get that but at the same time there is sixteen other books and I can not get all my books free and it takes time to find and get said books lol.. I don't know about the other books but this one seemed it didn't matter if you started with this one or book one. From reviews I have seen a lot of people are disliking this book even calling it the worse one and pretty bad. Of course these is mainly from the fans or at least what I have seen so far. New to the series or not I can see why.. Then again this is book 17 over the time that is a lot to write and a lot to make last this long..<br /><br />I think if this was not a Reacher novel it would have been better. Author can not keep writing the series forever unless he takes longer time to write them and have them come out... Noticed to have some say Reacher is getting old and he can't keep doing some of the stuff he does.... As I stated before new to the series so I don't know if it has already been done before.. But maybe Lee Child should write a prequel novel maybe, even a couple at that.. Even my first Reacher novel I can tell the series won't be able to go on much longer. At times with the book things seemed to have been written in a Rush, which kind of used to that from some books. So that really did not bother me at time. But toward the very end things seemed to drag really long and pretty much about the last twenty pages glanced quickly at the pages to see what was going to happen. The thing with the compound or whatever you want to call it with Reacher explorer it went to long I think.. With the dragging of this and some of rushed style of the story kind of making it some boring why I gave this four stars instead of five. Had I read more of the series before now I am sure my rating might be even lower perhaps.<br /><br />One thing that bothered me and I did not understand was the death of Sheriff Goodman. What was the point of that? Yeah I know he was old and really hadn't slept in what like three days. But it was like what the heck you couldn't find any more ideas for him?.... For a split second I got the death cause how it started out I thought someone had killed him.. With missing witness, the waitress, and the daughter I thought someone was covering their tracks.. This was before I was beginning to figure things out before the story went on and then I found out.. With Goodman though the death just did not sit right and made no sense in taking out.. And what is the deal about the idiot deputy? He clearly seemed written into the book purely to fill space on the pages.<br /><br />Something else bothered me was the death or Sorenson.. Was in the book just as long if not almost more then Reacher.. I can see getting wounded somehow perhaps but to be taken out that quick. One second you don't see it coming at least not that quick... Then boom the next second it is in like what one short sentence. Toward the end of the book or at the end I thought Delfuenson was actually going to be killed for real.. Back on Sorenson though with the way things were going and between her and Reacher I had a feeling something was going to be between the two.. Not saying in the next book would see Reacher settled down having a relationship with her... But more as a fling and her mentioned a few in the book or two maybe making a apperance in the following books if the series does go on longer.<br /><br />I still really do not under the death of Goodman though old or not. His death really seemed uncalled for. If someone has a idea on it please comment or my review lol.. Even way after it happen in the back of my mind as I was reading book was still trying to figure the point out about his death lol
B004J4WKUQ|1.0|The best part of the experience was the anticipation after reading such good reviews.  I found it pandering at best, drivel at worst. Extremely predictable, the first quarter may lead you to believe the rest is worth reading, but you will regret continuing from there.

B007L3BMGA|1.0|I downloaded Fifty Shades after reading several hilarious reviews of it on the internet, I just had to see for myself what the fuss was about. I don't really know where to begin, nor what to feel about my life after finishing this book. Anastasia Steele is the most dull, spineless, ridiculous character I have ever come across in a novel. It is impossible to comprehend that she is what, 21 years old? Never been drunk, never masturbated, and for god's sake who refers to genitalia as 'down there?' Is she 13 years old??? It definitely seems, as many other reviews have pointed out, that this book was in fact written by a hormonal early adolescent. If I had one dollar for every time she said oh my/ crap/double crap/it is so erotic/Christians expert touch, combined with the infinite amount of times that Christian runs his hand through his hair/presses his mouth into a thin line/cries 'oh Ana' as he stills and finds his release, I would have amassed a fortune greater than E.L James has made from this joke of a book.This is supposed to be erotica,yet the sex scenes are boring and repetitive, read one and forget the rest. Even more amusing is the fact that he only has to touch her nipples and she explodes into a barrage of orgasms. Is this meant to be real life? Oh, the cliches! Yawn, yet another clumsy, self depreciating twenty something who wears converse and has a passion for English literature. Aside from the above, what bothers me most about this book is the message the James conveys which says its OK to stay in a relationship with someone who is emotionally controlling and abusive, just because you are in love with them... Although can we really call it 'love' between Christian and Ana? Seems like needy, childish obsession to me. This book is shameful, not only to literature, but to feminism itself. One star, just because it was good for a laugh.

B007FEFLTO|5.0|Fall of Giants, Book One of Ken Follett's The Century Trilogy, had ended in January 1924 at the finish of World War I and the Russian Revolution, showing a nine-year-old boy shaking hands with his father. Book Two, Winter of the World, commences in February 1933, with eleven-year-old Carla in the kitchen of her Berlin home wondering what her parents, English born Maud, and German born Walter von Ulrich, were arguing about. Book One's readers would also be unsure what the quarrel was for, as they would recall them to be an amorous couple, who had defied the establishment and married in London--when Walter was a German diplomat there--on the eve of the Great War. We soon learn that the row was about Walter's objection to an uncomplimentary article on Adolf Hitler, written by Maud in a German magazine, where she worked. It was not that Walter was a Nazi, for he was a Social Democratic Party representative in the Reichstag, but he feared: \\"It would infuriate the Nazis ... and ... they're dangerous when riled.\\" Before long Walter's predictions come true. The \\"Brownshirts\\" soon start disrupting meetings of parties opposing Hitler, and attacking Jews and others in the streets. The novel thus begins evocatively, covering the rise of a new giant, the Third Reich, from the ashes of the previous one, which throws the world into a \\"winter.\\"<br /><br />Just as in Book One of the trilogy, this novel continues with the story of the five interrelated families--English, Welsh, German, Russian, and American--who live through some of the major world-events from 1933 to 1949. This part features: the rise of Fascists and Nazis, WW II, the development and dropping of the atomic bombs on Japan and the start of the Cold War. The plot now includes not only some of the previous characters, but also their children. It seems Follett does not need as many characters, as noted in the previous book's six pages. In this novel they are listed on five pages, which makes it a more intimate read. While the list is handily presented, at the beginning of the book, most readers--including those not having read Fall of Giants--will likely not feel the need to refer to it.<br /><br />Although the narrative swings, from country to country and family to family, the characters, particularly those not having `come on stage' for a while, are reintroduced by a skillful clue, enabling readers to identify them immediately. Particularly, their names: Chuck, Gus, Woody, Boy, Maud, Lloyd, Erik, Volodya, and so on, are well chosen and recognizable representatives of their country of origin. Although that period's historical events are well known, from film and history texts, the narrative thread of these individuals, whom we care for and wish to learn more about, would encourage readers to keep turning the pages of this magnum opus. The result is not only an entertaining reading of their love stories and sexual experiences, but also an insight into the calamity, the horrors, the pain and sufferings of these people, who lived through those tumultuous times. Also, concurrently, we gain an insight into the monumental efforts made by the Allies to bring the Nazi menace to its knees. To accomplish this, Ken Follett has used the tools of an historical fiction novelist admirably. The casts' locations, education, job functions, and personal characteristics are well chosen, which enable them to mix seamlessly with real historic characters at most of the important proceedings, such as political demonstrations, vandalisms, spying, strategy planning meetings, military campaigns, peace talks and so on. These give us the thrill of having shared the mental thoughts and lived through those events beside the characters. Not only that, but Follett's eye for detail, such as, people turn on their radio sets and wait for them to warm up before the sound comes, puts us right in that epoch.<br /><br />Nevertheless, in order to make all of the above happen, Follett has had to use the fictional story-tellers' favorite device of `coincidence' in this book, as much he did in the former. The actors happen to be, proverbially, at the right place at the right time, to meet the right person. Some readers might find this unnerving. For instance, in one scene a soldier, while serving clandestinely in France, rescues the pilot of a downed aircraft, who turns out to be his half-brother, on a sortie out of England! However, this reviewer would agree with the dialogue between the characters: \\"It's a small world ... Isn't it?\\" For such quirks of fate do happen. [Actually, in a similar fluke, I once happened to meet my cousin--who lives in a city over 10,000 Kms away from mine--at the Dubai Airport, while changing flights, although we were both on separate trips!]<br /><br />The Spanish Civil War is covered in some depth, and its major lesson is enunciated by a Welsh character, Lloyd, as: \\" ... we have to fight the Communists just as hard as the Fascists. They're both evil.\\" As it turns out, the Communists helped to subdue the Nazis, and the Cold War with them was yet to come.<br /><br />Quite naturally, Follett was not able to capture, in detail, all the theaters of the WW II, such as the Dunkirk evacuation, the battles in North Africa, Italy, Burma and elsewhere. But, the ones he has covered, are presented movingly and the action sequences are in sufficient detail to bring them visually before our eyes, but not so monotonously--as in some war movies--to make them tedious. The best coverage is of the War in the Pacific, particularly the Battle of Midway and the sinking of the USS Yorktown, told through the eyes of Chuck Dewar, a closeted-gay US naval officer. Follett's introduction of diverse characters, and the portrayal of an interracial love affair brings additional vividness to the novel.<br /><br />Possibly, because the topic, of the Nazi Concentration Camps for Jews and others, is well covered elsewhere, they only have a passing mentioned in this novel. However, Follett has included at some length the discovery and the eventual closing of the not too well known Aktion T4 \\"hospitals.\\" While this novel covers just one such institution, it is known that there were about six, where many thousands of German citizens deemed to be incurably sick, mentally incapacitated or physically handicapped were euthanized. They were, not coincidentally, also mostly of Jewish and mixed races. The novel describes the thrilling bravery of the German teenage girls, Carla and Frieda, to collect evidence that through the efforts of German clergy and public opinion, which finally persuaded the Fuhrer to close the program.<br /><br />While there are many real and fictional politicians, spies and their clandestine activities abound in the novel. Here Follett, as a masterpiece thriller novelist, is on familiar territory. Since the story lines are those of the children of the characters in Book One, they are mostly teenagers or slightly older. Yet, they perform remarkable feats of international espionage, with ease, which turns the course of wars and fates of nations. Such as the young Volodya, who after conducting several successful undercover activities for the Russians in Berlin, is sent all the way to Albuquerque New Mexico, in 1945, when he is still only about thirty. His mission: to bring back the plans of the nuclear bomb.<br /><br />The third part of this novel, called \\"The Cold Peace,\\" sets the stage for the final Book Three of the Century Trilogy. The characters, children of the ones in Book One, now have kids of their own, who will undoubtedly play a prominent role in the Cold War storylines to come. The final chapter's ending, similar to the Book One's, shows a child blowing out his birthday candles, indicative of the promise a new beginning. However, will they live in peace? We will have to wait for the Book Three to find out.<br /><br />Ken Follett, in the recent promotional interviews for the Winter of the World, disclosed that he had the typescript of the novel read by a number of notable historians.

B008NEVP1S|4.0|Aimee Mann once again delivers an album of intelligent lyrics and catchy melodies. A few critics have quibbled that Mann offers nothing new with this release. To an extent, this is true. Many of these tracks would fit comfortably on her last two studio albums, 'Smilers' and 'The Forgotten Arm' and I mean that as a compliment. Both of those releases were excellent. I began to listen to her seriously with the 'Magnolia' soundtrack and 'Bachelor #2' with 'Bachelor' probably being my favorite of her numerous albums. One of the many qualities with Mann's albums is the consistency of her first-rate songwriting. Many of her songs can lyrically convey a convincing short story in under 4 minutes! How many current singer/songwriters can do that and I stress the word \\"current'. In my humble opinion, many of her songs over the years can be favorably compared to the best of Joni Mitchell's and thats quite an achievement! As for 'Charmer', some favorite cuts are \\"Labrador\\", \\"Crazytown\\", \\"Barfly\\"  \\"Living A Lie\\" dueting with The Shin's James Mercer, and \\"Gamma Ray\\" an actual real rocker! I really hope this release can gain her a larger audience. She is definitely(and unfortunately) one of the more underappreciated recording artist!
B0054JZC6E|3.0|its fun but it takes too may points to unlock new games. also they want you to do to much other stuff to get points I just wanna play the games!
B0084I9QIW|5.0|you know when you  when are watching a  Great  Artist do what they do best and how the impact and love is truly felt between artist and audience.  back in the  day Michael Joe Jackson could do no wrong on a  stage. with a voice that was a message in a bottle that touched so many lives and hear me on this, no internet, tweet, facebook, myspace,etc.. it was only your space and mind with the man and his music and how powerful he was on stage.  the band was tight and MJ the underrated  Band leader had things in gear and he was rocking stages that were drawing  almost a 100,000 people a night all over the world.<br /><br />he truly was a once in a lifetime Musical Genius on Stage and in the studio and the songs are timeless and speak of his greatness and to  go back and see it all again is a great treat.<br /><br />he captured the imagination through his sheer talent and drive and he dominated it big time. a must have  from the King of  Music.
B00475AYJQ|3.0|The series started out with a bang but the middle is a little disconcerting in that it feels like we have a whole lot of story to go only one book left to tell it.  Frankly I just do not see that based on the ground that he covered in this book how he is going to satisfactorily wrap things up in one more book.  Don't get me wrong, I did enjoy the story he told and the writing is still excellent but the whole thing felt like filler.  There is so much I want to know about the main character.  The Kovthe narrating the story and the Kovthe that he is at the point where we are in the story he is telling seem so far apart on a dateline of events that it took away from the enjoyment of the story since the events told appear to be so minor in the scheme of things and due not seem to be progressing the story to where we need to be for a big finale of a final book.  Hopefully this will be one of the books that are looked on more favorably after the series is done (like I think a Feast of Crows will) than it does now when we the readers just want to get on with the story and not have to wait two years are more to do so.
B008QE9VJI|5.0|I thought this movie was awesome and funny! it was refreshing to see a funny dark movie.  I loved Johnny Depp in this role! I'm not to fond of these kinds of movies but it was def. awesome! I have never written a review about a movie on here before...so what does that tell u?  lol love it! buy it! Johnny is adorable in it!
B007MDB71O|4.0|This is not the movie previewed in the theater!  Whom ever was responsible for the promotion of the movie should be fired from Disney.  I didn't see this in the theater - I would / should have but it looked almost like a straight to DVD movie.  Bad, bad job in the pre-release promotion.<br /><br />This is pretty much the movie I hoped it would be.  It has been forty years since I read the novellas that Edgar Rice Burrows wrote almost a hundred years ago.  I enjoyed the movie very much and shared it with my grown children, one son has ordered the books to read to fill in the stories.<br /><br />This books aren't the Lord of the Rings (neither is the movie) or the Hobbit but are very enjoyable none the less.
B008602KQI|5.0|I had been looking for a copy of the Hunger Games DVD without all the extra fluff of Blu-Ray and other unnecessary shenanigans. I finally found this on Amazon. It's great, it contains just two discs (Movie and Bonus Features) and also comes with both a digital copy and a version of the movie on Amazon. Got this for my sister as a gift because she's a huge hunger games fan, and it was perfect. Not to mention, a decent movie to boot.
B008ASLK8A|5.0|I may be slightly biased because of my obsession with both Jude Law and Robert Downey Jr., but this movie truly is incredible. Although it's technically a sequel, it can be seen and understood without having seen the previous. The plot just draws you in to the point that you're hanging on to every word of every scene, the acting is flawless, and it's one of those movies that keeps you watching and will have you thinking about it even after it's over. All in all, it's an amazing movie, dramatic, slightly funny, and nerve-wracking. I sincerely recommend it to everyone.
0756404746|4.0|This book (series) was ranked #18 in NPR's poll of the Top One Hundred Fantasy and Science Fiction Books of all time as selected by over 60,000 voters.  To put in even more perspective it was ranked in between \\"A stranger in a strange land\\" and \\"Slaughter House 5\\"  plus I think it was the only book on the list published in the past couple of years and the only other \\"new\\" writer on the list was Brandon Sanderson.  The book is good but just not sure it is that good.  I did like the fact that the writer focused a lot on such mundane things as the fact that the main character was hungry all the time because he was poor since it gave a nice since of realism.  I never quite warmed up to the girl and she seemed like more trouble than she was worth.  The good news is the writing is excellent especially when you compare it to most of the self published stuff I have been reading lately on my kindle and it makes your realize just how important a really good editor can be in shaping a book.  If you are a long time fantasy fan (like myself) I think it is worth reading due to the quality of the writing alone.  If you are new to fantasy because you are big fan of Game of Thrones it might seem like a little more grown-up version of Harry Potter but I think even the action oriented epic fans will enjoy it.  The only reservation I have in recommending it is the second book suffers from serious middle book issues and left me very concerned since the writer still has MANY loose ends to tie up and only one book left in the supposed trilogy and frankly I just do not see right now how he is going to pull it off after seeing how little he progressed in the story in the second book so if you are a casual reader it might be a good idea to wait until he finishes the series as see how that turns out before deciding whether or not to invest the time and money.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Outstanding book, I would like to thank all members of this team for their service. And thank you to the author for telling it like it happened.<br /><br />Semper Fi<br /><br />Rue
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I love this book have read it many times and will never get bored of it. The bad boy meets and falls in love with the virginal good girl with a past and changes all for her.I cried and laugh with this book from beginning to end. Its a story that anyone can releate to but its not for everyone to read and like. I recommend it and you wont be disappointed with the characters and story line it has a bit of everything for everyone. The bad boy Travis \\"maddog\\" maddox is to die for!
B00846REIS|4.0|I really enjoyed this book. I highly recommend to anyone who enjoyed 50 Shades, in fact, it even has more of a story line, which I truly enjoyed!! However, there were moments when her lack of self esteem was just a bit much. Otherwise, I would have a rated it a 5.  Don't get me wrong... I am DEFINITELY looking forward to the next one.  Even pre-ordered it!!!
B008XG1X18|5.0|I really like pinterest it let you really be yourself and put it out there as to your likes, loves, favorites....Gives you ideas for DIY PROJECTS &amp; all.  I feel everyone should try it at least once.
B009329ZF2|1.0|The movie itself was great.... the video quality was the worst ever.<br /><br />My husband was livid!  It kept freezing up every 30 seconds or so.<br />In order to watch the movie he had to wiggle the mouse to get it to play.
B00127RAJY|5.0|a friend loaned this to me to give it a try. I liked it so much that I ordered my own. Before doing this video, my work-out time was pretty much non-existent. This gives me a really good workout in a short amount of time. I am always somewhat sore the day after, which indicates to me that it's working! I am still on the level one difficutly, I can't wait to see what the other levels bring.
B0083SBJXS|5.0|First of all this was a great movie with story. I'm sick of all those movie snobs out there saying it was shallow and there was no story. If you don't like it don't watch it. I think it is a great combination of action, comedy, drama, and yes story. They dive into each of the characters back story slightly. Obviously you can't go deep into each character with out making the movie 3+ hours long. The story is the Avengers must prevent Loki from destroying the earth and put their differences aside for the greater good.<br /><br />I do not mind spending money to own this movie because it was done well and is fun for all ages. I recommend this movie to anyone that wants to have a good time that well keep you entertained throughout the movie. For all those people complaining that their are no special features for dvd get over it! The capacity is much smaller than a blu ray disc. Get with times or be doomed with your old technology. The choice is yours thats the world we live in.
B001C1066E|5.0|I love naruto! And this coin purse made me feel like I was naruto having my coins in and easy to handle is the best and very adorable. Opens easily it also like a plush toy so you can always have it by your side. Like a piggy back it can hold pennies and all that for safe keeping. This a product worth buying.
1119963192|5.0|this book is easy to read and provides no non-sense information for developing swimmers.  It also discussed the main differences between some other methods, such as Total Immersion; e.g. gliding/dead spot.  I am a beginner swimmer and am taking lessons from a local pool.  The instructor is still teaching thumb entry, which is discouraged from swimsmooth.  The equipment section is excellent and discourages kick board; a recommendation which i believe is scientifically correct; the instruction on catch and pull is clear and concise; the best was saved for last discussing the differnt make up/types of swimmers and how they can benefit from recognizing which type of swimmer they represent.  Highly recommended reading.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|I read most of the comments about this book before buying and almost didn't buy the book.  The reviews seemed to be all or nothing.  Either people loved the book, or they were put off by it because of other motives.  First off, I have read several other SF books and didn't really find this book to be much different from them.  I realize that it takes a special type of person to be in SF and have always appreciated their sacrifices to do their job.  What the SF community does in protecting the interests of our country is invaluable.  So, with that being said, I didn't really find this book to be more bravado than any other book that I've read.  Personally, I really liked the book and found it to be a good read and a very good story that I was extremely interested in.  This story was 10-11 years in the making and I thought the author wrote from a very unique perspective of being involved in the Seal community from the time of 9/11 until the end of OBL.<br /><br />Secondly, I had read and heard about all of the political cynicism that was supposedly in this book, but didn't find anything more or less than what I've read in any other book.  There were certain comments or statements that were made that I really likened to how a lot of us would write about a previous boss we worked for that seemed to make our work life a little more difficult.  Even then, I really didn't get a sense of this book being politically slanted one way or the other.<br /><br />Third, there was a lot of talk about the amount of info that was released in the book that might compromise national security or compromise the inner-workings of SF operations.  There wasn't anything more said in this book that again, I hadn't read about before in other books.  Also, I had heard about more details of the operation through news services than what was presented in the book.  Now for technical accuracy, I don't have a comment on that.  There could've been certain details that were wrong or not and I wouldn'tparticularly know either way.<br /><br />Bottom line, there are a lot of comments about this book being made that I just didn't see in the book.  I read this book from the start looking to see if everything that was being said was indeed in the book and written the way it was being talked about.  For me, this was just a good book about a very important event that I was interested and I liked the book.  Is the book a 100% account of exactly what happened?  I don't know.  I do know that I don't take what I hear from news services or organizations as 100% accurate either and I certainly don't classify myself as a conspiracy theorist by any means.  If you're interested in SF books, then read the book and draw your own conclusions.
1594202842|5.0|In the book store, the book like this which has a hard cover might cost $20,but this one only cost about $16, so this is cheaper!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Enjoyable read. Entertaining.  Have not seen the movie.I would recommend this book. Looking forward to reading the rest of the triology.
B000002H7I|3.0|I bought this for my daughter because I remember loving it when first came out.<br />The songs were soulful and melodic, a great second album for this young rising artist at the time. I could play \\"bridges\\"  over and over again.  I have to admit though it's a little bittersweet revisiting this work after all these years. It's kind of like seeing an old friend years later.  Its sweet but you can't fully recapture what you had because its clouded by time.  Maybe that's just with this album though.  It is a bit melancholy.  Still worth a listen.
B007KQXB2G|5.0|Season 5 was really good - better than 2-4.  My favorite is Season 1.  Acting is suburb and the story lines are solid.  Can't wait for Season 6
B007IXWL2C|1.0|Not into bondage and did not enjoy reading about so much of it.  I also feel that it placed the woman in bad light because she was so in-experienced and he took advantage of her lack of knowledge.
B000HKYIYC|2.0|Not good by any means, so I will only state what you would need to continue any subplots that have been running.  Trip and T'Pol have more massage therapy (seriously).  Oh, and Porthos gives birth to a penguin. ;> (not seriously; though I enjoyed typing these last few sentences more than I did watching this episode).  That's.  About.  It.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|A very consuming read.  To follow a SEAL team from start to finish in ridding the planet of Bin Laden was a unique experience.  Becoming and remaining a SEAL is the very definition of professionalism and these guys allow absolutely no slack in executing a mission. If you had any doubts at all about how tough and precise a SEAL team actually is, you won't after reading this book.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|I am not a reader of books on war but I found myself fascinated by what these young men had to go through just to get to the position they held to be chosen to be on the team that went on the mission that finally ended the life of that evil man.
B00913DPW2|1.0|Have tried and tried to get through this game and it is way too cryptic for me! Had to go to cheat sheet to figure it out and still had trouble, I have given up for now!
B00645LFA4|2.0|I am rating this DVD lower do to the fact that it did not play through my Onkyo system like all of the rest of my 3D movies do.<br />I had to plug it directly from the DVD player to the TV.  Some what of a hassle to get at all my equipment just to watch one move.<br />If the manufacturer was trying to prevent copying it was not worth their time as this one is going down to the blanks soon.
B00729GQ0A|5.0|The Forever Girl by Rebecca Hamilton was another amazing story that I read in a couple of hours because I didn't want to put it down.  It has to do with witches, which is, well, awesome.  The author also throws in a lot of historically accurate background about the burning of \\"witches,\\" the Salem Witch Trials, you name it.  Sophia has just graduated college, and can't find a job that has to do with her major. Yeah, we've all been there.  She is a practicing Wiccan, and has an annoying buzzing noise in her head. When she sets forth a spell to rid herself, or at least, lessen the noise, she sets forth...well, everything. She starts to hear voices, and some unsavory characters appear around her.  Never mind that her best friend Ivory is starting to act...strange.  When Sophia meets Charles, a dual blooded demon who can help her find out the truth about her ancestor's hanging, all bets are off and Sophia is shocked at the truth.  I loved the flashbacks that Ms. Hamilton put in here, I could see it so clearly in my mind, and it was so well fleshed out...bravo! I loved the interactions between Sophia and Charles, they made me laugh, there was some steamy stuff which is always good, and...I can't wait for the next one! The author has told me that Sophia won't be seen again until a bit in book four and seven, so we are settling in for a long and wonderful series!
B008XG1X18|5.0|Absolutely LOVE this I can spend HOURS on it not always good I get nothing else done. Lots and lots of ideas and beautiful Pics, recipes,  everything you can think of!! Hats off to whoever came up with this.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I could not put this book down. It's the kind of book you stay up way past your bedtime reading and then make time to read in the middle of the day. I read the second book in the trilogy even faster than this one. Highly addictive reading material!
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Great book. Kept my attention and made me desire to come back and finish reading. Very easy read and a great insight into how amazing US forces are and how much they all sacrifice for our freedoms.<br /><br />People crying foul over this book are blowing smoke. They are not wanting to real truth to come out... Which this book gives, the truth.
B005LAII6M|4.0|In my summary I mentioned RE 5 is great for fans of the movie series and games. If your true genuine lover of zombies this movie is for you! Non- fans may enjoy it because of the GREAT ACTION!I have followed the movies since the first back in 2002 and fell in love right away. Movie picks up right after the \\"Afterlife.\\" Alice sums up all the movies in the beginning; however,a lot is left out from what she shares in the beginning. This movie brings a lot in from the games and with that it gives you a game kind of feel during the movie. Alice and her team have to complete stages and kill bosses. Non-stop fun and action from start to finish. You have almost time to think during the movie; I sat through the credits processing \\"What just happened\\" in the last 1hr & 1/2? I encourage you to give RE 5 a chance and help yourself by not listening to all the RE Film criticizers and the critics. It makes me wonder if they even watched the movies? I was hoping it was a bit longer of a movie, Alice giving us another summary of the films (a waste of valuable time), and the whole thing with A. Wesker? Overall 4/5 stars. These movies are promising and I would say their is a bright future ahead for the RE Film Series!!!
B0087HT36U|5.0|pretty good game.sorta like angry birds or any other castle crusher game. tap based launch no need to aim your tregectory.
0385344333|5.0|What I love about Reacher novels is his ability to calculate, measure, figure out where his body is in relation to other people or objects. It is amazing the way Child weaves this in to the plot. I read this book slowly, and at times re-read a page because I did not want the book to end. I have read all of the Reacher books and now am sad that I have to wait forever for the next one. If you like Reacher's character, you will LOVE THIS BOOK. Lee, please hurry up and write another one and do not take so long.I am now in Reacher withdrawal!! As usual, I will read this book again because it is that good. BUY IT!!! I do not care about the price, it could have been double the amount I paid, I would have gotten this book. Pat Lilley, Raleigh, NC
B0087HT36U|5.0|gets more challenging on second set. nice graphics and cute sounds. plays perfect on galaxy S3 . my favorite of all the knock over physics games
0545265355|5.0|This is one of the best series I've read in a long time! For Meir rates up there with Harry potter and the twilight series! Suzanne collins is a gifted author keeping you glued to the pages long after the lights should be off!
B0017SWPXY|5.0|I laughed, I cried, I noticed a marked similarity in the usage of  the concept of reincarnation in \\"A Dog's Purpose\\" and \\"The Art of Racing in the Rain\\".
0843178108|5.0|My grand daughters loved this book.  They have read a number of Mr Men books and ask for more of them.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Definately a page turner.  Didn't want to put it down.  It had twist after twist after twist.  I liked the idea of two POV characters and how the story came together like the pieces of a puzzle.  Each chapter was a new reveal.  However, I was disappointed in the ending.  This is why I only gave 4 stars.  I won't spoil it for those who haven't read the book yet but in my opinion the ending was definately left open to interpretation. I would be interested to know the author's thoughts on how she meant to end the story.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|Bought it to read about the guys who fight for us (I am not American, still appreciate the effort). Wanted to find more details about assault on BinLaden's compound. There are such details, nothing about Hollywood in my opinion, so I read about what I wanted and enjoyed that. The book seems to have details about some other missions, I was not interested in those and did not read them.
B007SYWFRM|3.0|freezes up and is very slow at times. the price to buy stuff is alittle to high for me. nice when thing are on sale
B0045HCJKS|5.0|I liked this movie as a kid, when it aired on T.V.<br />now I get it.<br />a movie about rich people so bored, they spend huge amounts of money to play out fantasies in old times long forgotten.<br />Rich people so spoiled they can't survive a \\"glitch\\" in the system.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I have this app on both my droid and kindle and it has helped me continue on with reading through the Bible this year. It is September now and I am excited to complete the entire Bible for the first time in my life in December.  You can start at any time (doesn't have to be beginning of the year))and I like the audio option, it has helped me on long work days to listen to God's words being read.  I am thankful for an app that is helping to grow spiritually.  I am not the best at complex technology, this one keeps it simple.

B005D9MUWY|5.0|Increased my typing 50% and less mistakes. A lot easier than the key board that came on the phone. I would recommend to my friends.
B001D09OAI|5.0|Of course this gets five stars. It features the Cleveland Indians & Charlie Sheen... Can you really go wrong? Such a great movie.
0307960471|4.0|The opening pages of Jo Nesbo's book \\"The Leopard\\" has a very graphic scene of human demise by an unusual device called Leopold's apple.  For those who have read this novel, you may appreciate the utility of such an item for dealing with noisy children and commuters who use cell phones on the train.  Mr. Nesbo, if you have not yet filed for a patent on this ingenious device, please do so and let me know so we can work together on its commercial application.<br />The primary instrument of bizarre designer death in Jo Nesbo's new book \\"Phantom\\" is not nearly as ingenious and diabolical and patent-worthy.  That was my only disappointment in the book.  The balance of the book has lived up to my expectations for a Jo Nesbo book featuring his antihero Harry Hole.<br />The recent spate of popular Scandinavian authors (and I include Stieg Larsson and the Lars Kepler duo in this category) seem to embrace complex plots with effortless twists and turns, together with a bleak world where bad guys abound, and the use of the term \\"bad\\" doesn't come close to describing the intense evil that guides the main antagonists.  And many of the so-called good guys are not much better.<br />Within this world Harry Hole resides, a very odd, self-destructive and socially isolated character who, as he descends into his own personal hell, has one self-described virtue that defines his life...he is a policeman.  Which may also turn out to be his most tragic flaw which you will see if you read the book, but which I won't give away in this review.<br />In \\"Phantom\\" Harry returns from Hong Kong because the son of his 0ne true love (who has kept Harry at arms' length because of the propensity of his criminal investigations to spill over into his personal life bringing terror and danger to those close to him) is in prison, charged with murdering a drug dealer.  Harry's ensuing off-the-books investigation takes us through a Norwegian drug scene that is filled with hopelessness, with sellers and buyersenslaved by addiction and a need to satisfy their craving at the expense of all else.  But with money and power ruling, no one is immune from the trade, including the police and politicians in whom the public has placed (perhaps misplaced is more appropriate) its trust.  Harry's path to unraveling the identity of the \\"phantom\\" leads him through a maze of hidden agendas, conspiracies and intrigue, with enough near death experiences to do in a small army of lesser men.  Were Harry so inclined, the physical wounds he suffers would require an army of surgeons to work overtime to repair.<br />This book is not for those who like light, happy reading.  It is dark and violent and depressing with but a few short-lived chapters of hope for a happy future for Harry. The book is also riveting and unpredictable with new revelations coming until the last page.  I couldn't put it down for a minute until I had finished it.  Pick it up.  It's a good read. Thank you for another entertaining ride, Jo.
B007DIQB50|5.0|This Is The Ultimate Artist Of Rap... The Lady GaGa Of Rap.. Probably More Inspiring Than Lady GaGa. She's The Hottest Act Right NOW..
B005NFW0U0|4.0|As far as the series itself, season 3 is an amazing buy. If you are a Vampire diaries fan, it won't disappoint! However, the playback on the Amazon on-demand is just okay. The quality is comparable to some of the free (illegal) websites out there, which is a bit disappointing when you think that I actually did the honest thing and paid for the series.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|Beautifully challenging, but with some mercy (in the form of hints). Really fun while being relaxing, too (sometimes).Give it a shot.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|Works without issue.  The only reason I opted for these over cheaper alternatives is that this cable is longer and looks nicer with its white coloring.  The large connector is nice and stout (has a bit of a different appearance than many others, one that I find more appealing).  The small end's connector also fits more snugly than most of my other USB cables.  All told, these are worth the extra cost to me.
B0017SWPXY|4.0|It'll steal your heart!!! Great for dog lovers, but also for those who don't, as well.  Never thought that reading a book through the eyes of a dog could be so entertaining.  LOVED IT
034580404X|5.0|Product was exactly as described.  I am enjoying reading this series of books.  A favorite fan of Amazon and will continue purchasing in the future.
B005LAIHSQ|5.0|This movie was very good in the special effects department, but you could tell that the directing of the actors wasn't very good.  The actors did the best they could with what direction they were given.  The dwarfs were awesome, and the close ups of Kristen Stewart's Snow White were beautiful, but she was given very little dialogue. Charlize Theron's Queen was good as well, but she over acted in a couple of scenes.  Chris Hemsworth's Huntsman was just the right amount of gruff, but I was looking for more from his character, to show Snow White more moves on how to defend herself.  Sam Claflin's Prince was very good as well.  All in all, I enjoyed the movie so much that I purchased the DVD to add to my family's collection.
B00932A2MC|5.0|i love how you can rent movies on demand and i loved the movie thank you for letting me review it.
B009329ZF2|5.0|This movie is not only exciting but real Navy ships and Navy personnel are used.  The USS Missouri was taken out of dock where it had been parked for past 20 years!!! I have visited Hawaii and Pearl Harbor,it is a very moving experience.  In the movie the American and Japanese Naval officers work together to defeat this new enemy.  The special effects will knock you off your feet.

B006KX3GXO|5.0|I can edit my i color, my room color, take blemishes  off of  my face and  make my room look a whole different color.It has a wide variety of stuff to choose from it is great!  I would definetly reccomend this .The only real con is that you need internet for somethings.
B0015F1VY8|5.0|This was a great movie. I wasn't quite sure what to expect from this movie since I had to watch it for my World Civilizations class but I'm glad I did. I'm not a huge fan of historical movies but this one is great. We learned about the holy war in class and this really brought it to life. Everything about this movie is great. Visually stunning. The soundtrack is phenomenal. Once again, awesome movie.
1402270275|5.0|I am not a big romance reader, sorry just not my thing.  Granted every once in a while I break with my own preconceived notions and jump into a book I probably shouldn't have picked up.  I thought that this one was going to be one of that throng of vampire of my dream books that seem to multiply worse than fleas on a dog.  I am extremely pleased to say that I was WRONG!  I had a blast reading this book, I enjoyed the characters, Honoria and Blade and all their supporting team as well.<br /><br />The steam punk aspect was a little light in the book, but I enjoyed the whole thing so much I read it all in a day.  I will be buying the next book in the series as well.  If Ms. McMaster keeps up the level of her writing I am going to be looking for her along with my Ilona Andrews and my Simon R. Green.<br /><br />The cover will either pull you in or turn you off, ignore it and just enjoy a wonderfully crafted story with characters you are going to thoroughly enjoy.  Wow, no spoilers.  That is different for me :)
0345803507|2.0|People love this series. I had to read it. I was all done reading twilight & the hunger games so naturally i jumped on to the 50 shades band wagon. The first book was SO hard for me to get threw. I skipped threw most of the smutt, because once you read one scene you've pretty much read them all, she just incorporates different places or toys. I dunno some people love it, it wasn't for me. I hate repetitiveness. They say the same 10 phases a million times threw-out the series. Once I read the first book I had to see if it would get better and read the rest..it didn't.
B0056TYT66|4.0|I installed this card on an ASUS gaming motherboard running Windows Home Server 2011. My MB is known to complain about non-video PCIe cards. And it did - MB made all sorts of beeps prior to power on. But I took the plunge and powered on anyway. The OS automatically installed a SATA driver that worked. I use the ports for a Blu-Ray drive and a front panel eSATA jack. In my eSATA tests, I was able to copy large files to old SATA drives plugged into a BlacX adaptor at a steady 125 - 150 MB/s.<br /><br />Getting the USB to work was harder. The automatic driver installation failed. So I went to the Transcend web site, support page, and downloaded the most recent SATA and USB 3.0 drivers. After a typical installation process, the card now works like a charm on both SATA and USB.<br /><br />I used the same drive to test my existing motherboard USB 2.0, and both the USB 3.0 and SATA ports of the Transcend card. They ALL did copies (windows drag/drop) of 8GB files at a consistent 125 - 150+ MB/s.<br /><br />The BlacX adaptor was used for both the USB 2.0 and eSATA transfers, and the USB 3.0 was tested with an adapter removed from a Seagate FreeAgent. The common element was the 500 GB legacy SATA drive. I suspect that this was the limiting factor on speed.<br /><br />So, I have yet to actually see the maximum speed potential of USB 3.0. But I am pleased that I have converted a single PCIe slot to give me the two extra SATA ports I needed, plus (potentially) USB 3.0 ports.<br /><br />When / if I can confirm that the card is in fact running at USB speeds superior to USB 2.0, I will come back and update this review.

B001OGWY1W|5.0|It is the closest version to the comics. A very good adaptation.<br />Good and recommended.<br />I've seen 2 times and see again.
B0083BYZMM|5.0|I do not write to much reviews, but this CD is probably one the best productions ever of SOS. New versions of probably their best music compositions with a jazzy touch that sounds like magic.  Get your Japan copy right now  and do not waste time on waiting for the US release. Still cannot understand why these guys do not tour the Americas.  I wish they could get an invitation for the 2013 Curacao Jazz Festival...... I could probably fill a full commercial plane with family and friends.  Six stars is short for this CD production !

014241722X|2.0|I read this book aloud to my kids at night - and every night we kept waiting for something interesting to happen.  Any story line or drama outside of the trial would have been a welcome reprieve - I thought for sure any day now Theo would be kidnapped, or April would get kidnapped by the murderer, or Ike would turn out to be the murderer.  Any kind of clever twist would have been an exciting twist - but this possibility was simply squandered.  This was as bland and straight forward as it gets.  And depending on the age of the reader - they may get lost in the legalese, even with the uncomfortable didactics that Grisham includes. I found myself translating/explaining alot of the judicial lingo to my 9 and 11 year old.  They kept asking the whole way through, \\"Is this just about the trial?\\".... well, basically, yes.<br />I would suggest taking a pass on this.
B0014D6PCO|5.0|It is the closest version to the comics. A very good adaptation.<br />Good and recommended.<br />I've seen 2 times and see again.
B004GYY714|5.0|TuneIn Radio allowa you to listen to any station in the world that has a digiral stream. As a person who travels a lot, I can listen to my favorite stations long after I left the area, or tune inro my home stations when I'm gone. Most highly recommended.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|I love this game, glad it's available on Android finally.  Graphics are great and the missions make it a lot of fun.  My 6 year lives this as well.  Galaxy Note.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Despite all the hype and hoopla, and the (genuine?) outrage among the spec ops community, this book reads like what you would expect from any master craftsman discussing his art.  I'm glad men like \\"Mark Owen\\" serve our country, and I'm glad that Osama bin Laden sleeps with the fishes.<br />The writing is fast and linear, and avoids the fascination with alphabet-soup acronyms that make so many military-themed books tedious.  It is extremely accessible, and helps better understand the commitment with which these individuals serve the interests of the United States of America.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|I have read a number of Seal and SAS \\"biography\\" type books and its great to get these accounts of our history in the making from the people who were there. The story is easy to read and quickly runs through the early years bringing you back to the opening chapter which is in Abbottsford minutes before the op gets going. The emotional connections and human element is felt as pages fly by. Even though the end is already known - the lack of accuracy of accounts as portraid by the media is a stark reminder of the agenda behind much of their reporting. Never trust what you read in a newspaper or hear on a news channel!! Well done \\"Mark Owen\\" whoever you are~!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I really enjoy this game. It makes you think &amp; if you want something to pass a little time this game is perfect :)
0142429112|5.0|This story, though it has a slow start, was so exciting i had to keep reading until i couldn't see straight! a wonderful romantic story with exciting scenes, descriptions so vivid i could see them in my minds eye. great lessons in family dynamics, conquering a traumatic situation and relationship guidelines like \\"go slow\\", \\"take your time\\"and \\"there is no rush\\" great advice for ones on fire with love lol. it was a great comparison to real life prejudice and relationship issues. suggested reading to high schoolers, college students and romantics of all ages, great mystery and funny in all the right places. i highly recommend this book, it was recommended by a friend and i thank him greatly for the experience of discovering \\"a Discovery of witches\\"!<br />[[ASIN:0143119680 A Discovery of Witches: A Novel (All Souls Trilogy)]]
B0091REZMW|3.0|It's a little clutter, and the Assistant doesn't to me add anything to they game.  It's a little confusing in the beginning, I'm going to find out if they have a PC version that will explain the setup a little better.
B00846REIS|4.0|I recently borrowed this book from a friend on Kindle.  I was looking for something that was similar to the Fifty Shades Trilogy and it was recommended as just that.  I have to say that I could see a lot of similarities.  The author doesn't seem as seasoned, but the subject matters, characters, and S&M erotica are pretty similar.  While I enjoyed it quite a lot, I can only give it four stars.  I think as author Sylvia Day continues to write, there is great potential for her writing to get so much better.  I do plan on buying [[ASIN:B005TLKZR8 A Dark Kiss of Rapture]] (as it is free for Kindle right now) and seeing how that one is.  If I like it, I may even buy [[ASIN:0425263916 Reflected in You: A Crossfire Novel]].  Hopefully between these Crossfire books, [[ASIN:B008UCKTL0 SENSATION AND MAGIC]], and re-reading [[ASIN:B007SGM084 Fifty Shades Trilogy Bundle]], I can make it to Christmas!

B0006U4UAU|5.0|I love LCD Soundsystem. This album is less mainstream than 'Sound of Silver' or 'This is Happening', but it has a little bit of something for everybody - there's a lot of variety on these two discs. \\"Disco Infiltrator\\" and \\"I'm Never As Tired As When I'm Waking Up\\" are my top 2 stand-out tracks.
B0087HT36U|5.0|My shoulder aches. I just couldn't stop playing. Colorful and challenging levels. More fun than flinging birds around. Highly addictive. Great fun.

B006G3MZRQ|5.0|I chose to watch this under the impression that I would enjoy it as I've always been quite fond of the Rocky movie series, as such I anticipated a predictable albeit lovable and thrilling movie... it was much more than that.<br /><br />Think of it like the movie 'Never back down' but with significantly more context and depth.<br /><br />A stellar performance by all central actors, bolstered by a well woven storyline that is bound to pull on the heartstrings of all audiences.<br /><br />This is a thoroughly enjoyable film - I highly recommend it.
B003ASLJK4|5.0|I just viewed and reviewed \\"The Cabin in the Woods,\\" and I pretty much hated it.  While watching I thought, \\"Will this movie stay with me for a while?  Will I still consider the characters and the themes, the overall meaning of this film, for any length of time?\\"  And the answer was, \\"No.  I will forget this film when it's (thankfully) over.\\"  Unfortunately, I'm still thinking about how poorly it was executed 15 hours later.  It left a pretty bad taste in my mouth.<br /><br />But believe it or not, while I was watching that film, I was thinking about this film.  Yes, that may sound odd, but for me, a movie is an experience that should evoke some type of emotion other than boredom.  (Is boredom an emotion?)  You might think the following:  \\"Bridges of Madison County\\" will be boring while \\"The Cabin in the Woods\\" will be exciting!  (Exclamation points are terribly overused, but maybe we need one here.)  And you would be dead wrong, kind of like those forgettable characters in \\"Cabin\\" that did us a huge favor by dying themselves.<br /><br />Now, this film surely has a better cast, that is for sure.  We have perhaps the greatest actress ever - Meryl Streep - with one of the best directors ever (and an excellent actor as well) - Clint Eastwood.  Cabin had, who, Thor?  I didn't recognize any of them, minus a cameo, and I don't care if I ever see another film with any of them in it.  But this movie is about taking pictures of bridges and maybe some weekend fling - not to give too much away, but you get the \\"bridge\\" part for free from the title - so therefore this film couldn't be too interesting, could it?<br /><br />And there you would be wrong again.  It's all in the execution; it's all in the emotion.  Ms. Streep's performance is fantastic, perhaps her best (very tricky to say since she's always spot on).  And I got the feeling that Mr. Eastwood kicked up his acting a notch to keep up with her, and it shows.  One of his better performances as well.  I felt an unbelievable connection to both of our protagonists here, I felt the longing that they felt, and I ultimately felt the pain that they endured as well.  And these weren't cheap emotions that some rookie director was trying to invoke in some cheap way, but rather emotions that the director allowed the audience to have in a very natural way.<br /><br />I just had to review a film that I liked after reviewing a film that I hated.  Now I feel better.  And you might too, after watching the near-masterpiece of filmmaking:  The Bridges of Madison County.
B0084IG7KC|5.0|I had only seen this movie once in the theater and it was sooo good.  I got a great deal and it was a preorder so it was pretty soon after the release date that I got it.

B000002GLE|5.0|Since I have all of Sting's albums including when he was with The Police, I thought I would get this one. I was looking in the record store in my hometown. What I usually do is read the back of the albums to see what songs on them. So I looked on the amazon website to see if the had it for a better price and I brought it. I was so excited when I got it in the mail and I listened to it and I loved it a lot.
B005HEX1AK|2.0|It seems as though the only purpose for this episode was to recap and justify the absurdity that has followed on the 6 preceding seasons of Voyager. Well, that and to give several actors one last chance to resurrect their characters (e.g. Seska).<br />About half way through the episode I was humming \\"Sorry for the Clipshow\\" from The Simpsons (link:[...]).
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|AWESOME GAME EASY TO PLAY I FEEL LIKE IM AT THE GAME STOR ITS SO COOL I LOVE IT ITS SO FUN
B008JTK9NW|5.0|Their best album so far.  Exceeded my expectations in that all the tracks have enjoyable elements.  Highly creative, energetic, and full of meaning.
0385344333|2.0|What a disappointment, not up to expectations of Lee Child and certainly not for Jack Reacher. I wish I had my money and time back. Makes me hesitant to trust Child again and while thinking about it who would ever believe Tom Cruise could be Jack Reacher.

B004UID2LC|3.0|I like this app really but its hard to download songs or videos because it says &quot;searching &quot; you need to fix that. btw I have a kindle fire!
0547396945|4.0|We are hoarders of kids' board books, mostly because (a) our son loves to have books read to him and (b) we get sick of reading the same books night after night. So every few months we buy another 4 books on 4-for-3 promotions, and see which ones hold his interest.<br /><br />We got the green sheep book when my son was about 14 months old. I hadn't realized when choosing the cheapest one that it was physically smaller than most, or that it is bilingual - my fault, not the fault of the product or seller. He started enjoying it right away, and still does occasionally. It just isn't one of his favorites.<br /><br />I think overall it's a pretty good book for ages 1-2 or maybe 3, but it just isn't one of the top picks at our house. There just doesn't seem to be enough variety - after all, how much expression can a sheep convey?<br /><br />Worth picking up if you have lots of books and want something new to read. But if you're on a budget, I'd go for We're Going on a Bear Hunt or something with more of a storyline and better descriptors first.

B000ZHCQ5U|4.0|I always wanted to see this movie and finally bought it.It was very enjoyable to watch.It must have been a good one for it being WAY ahead of it's time.I have still seen it referred to in newer movies to this day.(Steve Bushemi brings it up in \\"Armageddon\\".)<br /><br />Peter Sellars was a comic genius in my opinion.This movie is proof his comedy was strong WAY before the Pink Panther franchise started.<br /><br />I am glad I own it. :)
B007JWKLP6|2.0|As stated by another reviewer here, I am amazed at what has passed as 'finished product' regarding the audio track of this blu-ray.  Why should I have to hold the remote during the entire film, raising the volume (x2) to hear dialogue and lowering it again (suddenly) to not get blasted by musical sections?  Amateurish, indeed.  Nice film, but almost unwatchable because of this.  It's actually worse than NPR's sound level issues.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|Wow this book was amazing i really  hope  she decides ti write another book about travis and abby. i will be the first in line to   buy it.
B006LSZECO|4.0|People say the ending wasn't up to snuff...I disagree. As odd and crazy as the plot and characters are, how else could it end? Still odd and crazy! I expected nothing less and got exactly what I wanted. I definitely recommend this read (finished it in two days)!! I wish I could have more of the twins interaction on a funny level, the beginning started out so brilliantly then their relationship got lost...
B004IK8Q86|5.0|My husband recently watched the movie on TCM and raved about the story.  Read some of the reviews of<br />the book on Amazon, and was encouraged by the reviews to read the book.  Bought it for my Kindle. Wonderful, absorbing story.<br />Larry, the hero of the book, was such an admirable character-so kind and caring for all.  However, Isabel, who adored him, was a pitiful excuse for a human being, too concerned about how she was perceived by others.  Finally, at the end of the book, he came to realize that he and Isabel were totally unsuited<br />for one another.<br /><br />The book made me want to read more of Maugham's fiction.
B007EW9ISM|5.0|They have done an excellent job with this product.  Great feel in the hand.  Works well with my note taking ap.  very happy.
B005HJU7HA|4.0|I like the way Sherlock Holmes is written. It is easy to read and by following the logic written keeps you entertained. I started out with one book and ended up buying the complete works. I think this book is great and if there were others out there I would buy them too.

0525953728|5.0|This book No Easy Day is causing problems for the movie Zero Dark Thirty...the killing of Osama.<br /><br />Zero Dark Thirty is based on the book Seal Target Geronimo which depicts Osama diving for a machine gun pistol before he is killed. The author of Seal Target Geronimo was also a consultant to the production of the movie Zero Dark Thirty and a former Navy Seal who was not an eyewitness to the killing of Osama.<br /><br />The author of No Easy Day was an eyewitness to the killing of Osama, which in the book reveals that Osama was shot in the right side of his head while unarmed. With his twitching and bloody body lying on the floor, a SEAL repeatedly shot Osama in the chest until he was dead.<br /><br />This account is supported by the fact that all 4 adult males in the house were killed, while only one had a weapon, a currier at the guest house. One woman was also killed.<br /><br />Sony has already produced the movie Zero Dark Thirty. Now you know why this book No Easy Day is considered controversial and why the Pentagon has condemned it.<br /><br />Suggestion: read the book No Easy Day...the truth will set you free.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|I don't read many books unless they can really hold my interest. This has managed to do just that. Very interesting hearing about all the different missions from a first hand account. I am not done with the book yet but so far it's great.
B006AZZPCM|5.0|I love this app although I wish it can just upgrade on its own cuz its a real bitch to do so
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|the game is addictive but slow.  it costs plenty to play often.  still fun though, and a little patience can keep it free.
B005Q6GIY0|5.0|LOVE instant watch SOA. This show is absolutely amazing!!! The cast does an amazing job. I am completely entranced with this series.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|Great game. Completely addictive, always changing, and challenging enough to not be frustrating. If there is one game to have, this is it!
B0091REZMW|1.0|This was not what I expected. I like the graphics and the story line, but using the diamonds to unlock each room is a pain. So you have to be careful you don't spend them all. Other wise you are stuck. I don't care for this one.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|i love it. it has a LOT OF GAMES!!!!! it has a scocer game a plane game a bomb game.
B008I3QZKU|1.0|NO. NO. NO. No.  This is horrible.  I skiped through ever single track.  That is not good.  It is very boring indeed.  I have liked the Killers other albums...but this this one is WACK.  This goes in the garbage with Mr. Flowers horrid solo CD...that is what it sounds like to me.  Bye bye Killers bye bye.  Another good band bites that dust.  HORRIBLE ALBUM!!!<br />This album IS HELLO WACK>>>WACK>>>WACK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B0087HT36U|4.0|some are more difficult but still very much fun. it is a lot like angry birds. but still fun to play.

B0096DFBZQ|1.0|its a demo of a racing game with no throttle control. only 1 character and 1 map. average rating of 2 even though it displays 2.5... no reason for this to be in the list of top free games
B008XG1X18|3.0|i like the app but there are some issues with it. for instance, it freezes up on start up atleast every other time. sometimes i have to do a reboot of my kindle to unfreeze it...nice app, hopefully they fix the little issues.
B00352QISI|5.0|Love this movie.  The action and suspense are great, but there is also a lot of interesting philosophical & moral questioning going on in the background...The book of genesis from the Bible re-played out far in the future: new beginnings, temptation, the fall, corruption, redemption
B0084IG8TM|5.0|Hello i downloaded the digital copy but I need help! When I open it on itunes it says it brings special features that I can watch along with the digital copy on my ipad but I cant find it.. Is it that I am wrong and only the movie is available to download as a digital copy? Or is it only the walmart one because I bought the target 3 disc edition..
B004XDYJRU|5.0|Love this app. Since I don't live in LA i can listen to the baseball games and radio shows on espn 710. I recommend this for sports fans.
B007MNV5WU|4.0|its to easy I get so bord playing it it needs to be a challenge. but other than that its ok and it al ll so needs an update
B008UTV6S8|5.0|If you were fortunate enough to see the PBS/BBC broadcasts from Webster Hall then you are in for a returning treat. I last saw Paul Simon live on the main stage at Glastonbury, and though I enjoyed it, being out doors, bright and open I felt he was at times singing to the wind, necessarily on autopilot. Once indoors at Webster Hall the material becomes less iconic and yet more wonderful. The band (as ever) is fantastic, particularly the array of percussion which I enjoyed rather than merely tolerated. As usual the guitarists were more than just first class, and, like Paul Simon himself, were clearly enjoying themselves. If you are still unsure about the legacy of the 1960s and hesitate to venture into Paul Simon's material then this is a fine place to take the plunge. If you are merely an aging folkie, like me, then this will enthrall. It is too bright to be nostalgic, too exiting merely to recall better times. I really did think of the old Cajun cry: Laissez les bons temps rouler!
B008MG1E4A|4.0|All the rant about the book disclosing valuable, secretive information on Navy Seal operations is overstated. I didn't get the impression the author jeopardized any national security issues. Bin Laden brought America to it's knees briefly; we, the citizens of the U.S., do have the right to read of the actual raid and killing of this zealot.
B004YM6JLO|5.0|I love how Deamon & Sefan do anything to save Elena from death. I can;t get enough of season 3. I say this is the best season yet to come by far. I love this show very much. I don;t regret buying season 3. I can;'t wait till season 4 comes out then i;m going to buy it. i recommend u all to buy season 3 if your a big fan of the show. Its better then Twilight movies. I love Ian & Matt Daivs. U be shocked at the end of season 3 its going to be a cliff hanger.
B0087HT36U|5.0|Great game, liked it better than angry birds. Great graphics and the game does offer challenging scenarios. Overall, one of my favorite games.
B007KOYEOC|2.0|Had to read all three to see if the hype was justified . . sadly it was more hype than substance.  Perhaps it's an indication of how bland some readers lives are . . Mills and Boon with a bit of lust sprinkled about . . only average!
B006ZEDZNY|2.0|I tried to watch this movie twice, and just couldn't get into it.  I like Johnny Depp, and I like rum, but this just wasn't for me.
B004YM6JI2|5.0|I can;t get enough of Supernatural. I love how Dean & Sam faces the new evil on this show. i also know Sam &  Dean won;t stop at nothing to stop the evil lurking around your home town. I recommend everyone to watch this show and see it unfolded. I also recommend u buy season 7 if your a big SuperNatural fan like me. I can;t get enough of Dean & Sam fighting the evil for them to just to live there lifes better. This is still my favorite show to watch. I wish they would bring back John Windchester  so Dean & Sam could have there happy family.
B008XG1X18|5.0|As a pinterest addict, this app works just fine for me on my kindle fire. I'he had no glitches or issues and can pin many lesson ideas for school, recipes, and whatever else with no problems. Definitely worth downloading. I guess they've worked out the minks everyone was complaining about in August.
B008MG1E4A|3.0|This story about the action to kill Osama Bin Laden was very poorly written. There was no suspense as to the plan for this action or a follow-up as to the final phases of the mission. Very slow moving account of the entire action and the implementation and close of the mission.
B0092MKFIY|5.0|Builds on the songs from their Continued Silence EP.  Instantly likable.  The new songs \\"Amsterdam\\" and \\"Bleeding Out\\" are catchy but not corny.
B005LAJ212|5.0|My bestfriend recommend me to buy this show even though i only watch  3  so far. I recommend u all the buy this  show if your a big fan of it. I can't get enough of it so far its pretty good. Its worth every penny i spent on it.
B009329ZF2|5.0|Great action flick and plays out as such. Don't over think it.<br /><br />One question: The silver star for saving the world...!?
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Great book. A great perspective on doing something for a cause bigger than yourself. These guys truly love America! Thank God these guys are out there doing what they do.

B002SAUCBC|5.0|This story of 100 teenage boys who set out for the Long Walk is my personal favorite of Steven King's books.  Fans of the more recent Hunger Games trilogy would enjoy this terrifying story as this involves young people who must compete to the death in the name of entertaining the masses.  Here the boys do not kill each other but instead will be shot when violating any rule such as not keeping up with the correct pace.  The story follows one contestant whose psychological terror inside is as frightening as anything the soldiers are doing to the walkers who fall out of line.  It has all the characteristics King has made famous.  A highly recommended read.
0545265355|5.0|Upon many recommendations and rave reviews, I finally decided to read this series, I couldn't put it down! I even had dreams about the story. Definitely worth the price and I love how it comes in a boxed set.
B00932A6G4|4.0|Good show.  Well worth watching,  great computer animation.  Good story line.  Good addition to the Starship Troopers movie.  Liked the bugs, they looked pretty cool
B004O3YGMC|5.0|Works fast and smooth. Haven't experimented much away from home as I mostly use it to control my home computers. When I'm home it will play HD video/audio on my tablet from my computer. That says it all right there.
B008XG1X18|5.0|works well on aneroid phone and tablet! it loads quickly and is user friendly! I use it multiple times a day!
B000EOTTOK|1.0|did not receive the movie only the case. there was another movie in the case that was not wyatt earp's. i had a bad experience.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this series.  Finished all three books in a week while on vacation.  Its a series that stays with you after you are done.  You don't want it to end.  I was skeptical of it at first since it seemed so trendy and the premise seemed horrific, but the first few pages got me hooked.  I don't think I ever would have read it if I hadn't been able to check it out through the Kindle library with Amazon for free.  Highly recommend this story of survival and revolution.
B0084I9QIW|5.0|Amazing performance by the greatest entertainer who ever lived. MJ's talent and passion shine through in this concert and remind everyone why he is the King of Pop!
B007IXWL2C|3.0|It is interesting to see how such a repetitive book can do well.  There are very similar sex scenes again and again with exactly the same verbiage.  Of course the premise that a virginal woman can nail exactly the right guy on the first involvement (no comparative shopping) is a fantasy.  Did I miss something known to others, perhaps just women, about internal goddesses?  Is she good, bad or just wily?  Perhaps women are so starved for written porn that a low level of writing is enough.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|I think it is a great app that helps me do homework.And um not um cheat.Well back to homework see you later.
B004IJY4L0|5.0|The first track on this album was orchestral & epic. It is followed by a truly amazing & diverse selection of music, ranging from loud, bass-heavy tracks, to a surprise heavy metal/d&b track with In Flames! I loved this album, and it's going to be on my Walkman for a LONG time!
B008MG1E4A|5.0|I enjoyed this book.  I am a huge military geek and thought it was a interesting look into the DEVGRU world.  Aside from the Osama raid all the other parts of the book were awesome.  I loved their other missions more and I found them more interesting.  I love how he talked about their training and all aspects of it.  How much they sacrifice their personal lives to be a SEAL is ridiculous.
B00973DDN2|4.0|Awesome album for people that like ballads. It's like Brandon Flowers mixed in with the sounds of U2, Springsteen and a little bit of Queen. If you're only into the older Killers stuff that is grittier, then this might not be a good album for you. There are a lot of catchy riffs and choruses for sure. I enjoyed most of the songs and I've played it a few times because there are some great songs. Hot Fuss will always be my #1 but they have gone away from that kind of sound, but Battle Born and Sam's Town are close #2s. I'd give it an 8 out of 10.
B007MS5B6Q|5.0|I love the show especially the second half of season 2. So I already had season 1 on blue ray so I knew I was going to buy season 2, but when I saw the special edition zombie head for an extra $20 I was in. I have it above my chimney on a shelf perfect for Halloween decoration. It gets a reaction everytime I have people over. Great Show & DeF Great Buy!!!
B007C4ZJ3K|3.0|Preface: Please understand that customer reviews (and all reviews, for that matter) are purely subjective. Each person will interpret a book, movie, game, or album in a different fashion, unique to their experience. Therefore, no review (mine or otherwise) is a definitive judgment on a piece of media; it is simply one opinion of many. Please keep that in mind while reading reviews, and do not post angry comments because you disagree with a review's perspective (just because we're hidden by online anonymity does not mean that rules of courtesy do not apply). Level-headed comments or questions are welcome. Customer reviews are my way of making a small contribution to the Amazon community, instead of simply consuming media without offering honest feedback. On to the review:<br /><br />The film stars Gina Carano as a mercenary for hire (Mallory), who is betrayed by her employers, and must subsequently go on a revenge binge in order to find justice and answers alike. The plot of \\"Haywire\\" is threadbare, to be sure. But I don't have any problem with that. The problem is that it doesn't really make a whole lot of sense, and it's hard to get invested in the characters or their plight.<br /><br />Some of the acting is excellent (Michael Douglas and Antonio Banderas, in limited roles), but much of it is a bit stilted (Carano and Paxton). Particularly awkward is the dialogue between Mallory and her father, as they exchange wooden lines as if reading from cue cards.<br /><br />An interesting technique the director used was to kill all music during fight scenes. The results are mixed. At times, it adds a level of tension and reality to the scenes. However, if you're going to try to pull this off without using music or special effects, you better be really, REALLY good at choreographed fighting. Carano's stage combat is at times convincing, but at others, looked a little silly (like jumping off a wall to kick somebody in the head, \\"Underworld\\" style). However, this is apparently Carano's first film, so I can't be too hard on her, and this would more the director's responsiblity than the actor's.<br /><br />This is a decent action/spy/revenge movie to entertain you for an evening, with a rather subdued quality to it. But if you're expecting Mission Impossible or James Bond, you might be disappointed.Carano's first film, so I can't be too hard on her, and this would more the director's responsiblity than the actor's.<br /><br />This is a decent action/spy/revenge movie to entertain you for an evening, with a rather subdued quality to it.

0307887448|4.0|This is a great book which I definitely recommend to anyone. It really is a page turner.<br /><br />The reason why I don't give it 5 stars is because the 80's trivia does get tiresome at some point, the characters are one dimensional, the morals and values of pretty much everyone are questionable to say the least, and the antagonist is a caricature of the evil corporation which will stop at nothing to achieve world domination!
B000SEGMAU|5.0|The story is easy to read and follow. It is a sad and happy story, shows life-changing decisions. Very interesting view of death..celebrating life before you die is a great thing to do. Before we die, may we all be able to feel and know about the love and respect others have for us.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|I have read a number of first person accounts of military training and special military missions and I found this one not only interesting because of the subject matter but also very well written.  The author provided quite a bit of detail about the SEAL unit and special flight unit involved in the killing of Osama Bin Laden as well as the practice and preparation that went into the mission.  I believe the author is correct in stating that he did not disclose classified information but he still was able to make it exciting.  The book flowed well throughout and I finished it in two evenings.
1594135878|5.0|Book arrived on time and well packaged as always. The hunger games has a very intriguing story-line and though I haven't yet read the other books in the trilogy, I will definitely be getting the others to continue the story. The writing style is a little younger than I thought, but then again I guess that is the intended audience. So, don't expect a Jeffery Deever style complex plot and just enjoy the book as read. Definitely recommended!
B0073U2F12|1.0|I would give it 1/2 star for the 3D effects and 2 stars for the movie.  Since 3D DVDs are very limited at this time and a lot of them are animated (which I don't really care for), I bought this movie to try on my new 3D TV and was really disappointed with both the movie and the 3D effects.  I found the story to be rather boring and not all that well put on film.  The 3D effects were very limited and appeared to be poorly made from a 2D version.
B0096DFBZQ|1.0|This is just the DEMO that want you to buy the full game. That is why only 1 character selectable. But if you can't control the carts, and the game is on playable. You figure they would make a good demo in order to sell a full game. After just 1 lap you want to throw your phone. Just stay away from this game. Oh by the way the music is repetitive an annoying after the first 15 seconds
B008MEM24S|5.0|great game entertaining for all ages<br />can't wait to share with granddaughter<br />easy to get started.. liked ability to shut off sounds
B00684J49U|2.0|Every season gets progressively worst. This was a very disappointing season. Another tragedy that hits everyone. This is getting old quick.
B008JGSM6G|1.0|I enjoyed Flow Free very much until the nearly naked woman (with the few strings she had draped over her butt she might as well have been naked) showed up at the bottom of my screen. I don't find this acceptable &amp; as soon as I finish this review it will be removed from my phone.
B006G3MZRQ|5.0|Great movie, I have never written a review, this movie was so inspiring I had to say something. I loved it, cant say anything more than 5 stars fantastic.
B007VGXS8M|5.0|For those people who are saying that it doesn't load on kindle fire it does!! You just have to be piacent!!!!
B006ON41FC|3.0|I like it. but to admit. I hate open feint. wished it does not spam. I hate when that thing interrupts me while playing. its a fun game but. openfeint ruined it.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Great book! Highly recommended. difficult to get into at first as it has a lot of exposition background info etc. kind of dragged on in the end but well worth the time and money spent!
B0090P98Z4|5.0|first two floors have been fun.  Pretty nice looking graphics.  This is the nicest looking free app I have played so far.
B0058PJ6NE|1.0|The videos do not load.  Ñeeds to be updated.  Should have kept the free version.<br />don't waste your money. What more can I say?
B002PNAY9C|4.0|Great story. The entire cycle is amazing. Just sometimes there was a little too much detail. I would skip over full paragraphs explaining the color of the sun.
B004OZOTSQ|4.0|I'd like to see it easier to tell it where to upload. I'd also like to be able to have a program that aloes me to get files from my computer.  When all is said and do e for what it's made for and being $1 it has hit the ball out if the park.
B004GYY714|4.0|I really enjoy the fact I can listen to radio from cities where my favorite sports team plays. When my local radio station is not playing the program I want. I can got to Tune in Radio and listen to the station I want.
B008MG1E4A|2.0|It's really nice that the proceeds are going to a number of Navy and SEAL related groups, that is a good reason to buy the book all by itself.<br /><br />That said, nothing really new here; reads like a Clancy Novel with out the flair and character development and connection.<br /><br />Mark:  thank you for your service but let others do the telling.  This is not your area of expertise.  And good luck with any legal junk tossed your way.
B004DMNT2W|5.0|This Lowepro Digital Camcorder case is just perfect!. It provides a snug fit, which was a concern to me since my old case felt sloppy unless I stuffed it with tissue paper for travel, etc. Also, the case acommodates a lanyard and that is a MUST when I am on a shoot with so many other things to think about. Sturdy, well thought out, I recommend it.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I adore Pinterest and LOVE the fact that I can review the site on my Kindle.  Thanks for all of the excellent ideas.
B002VPE1XE|5.0|I love this case and use it for my 35MM, but also for a handy tote when I want to travel light. It has an easy access zipper all around, so you can really stuff it full. I also carry extra lenses in it when needed, and I really liked it so much, the size, the quality, the convenience, that I bought a second one! Since they look alike, I just put different fobs on the zipper pulls so I grab the right one. Wonderful product, and I recommend it!
B0014VQGX4|2.0|Bruder is supposed to make some of the best vehicle toys out there, and this status always confuses me.  Yes, their designs and large size are very nice, but the plastic they use is shockingly brittle.  We've owned many construction vehicles of various brands, and the Bruders always break first.  The plastic cracks so easily.  Every time we give the Bruder name another try, it breaks quickly.  It's very frustrating.  I'd blame my boys for playing with them too roughly, but that wouldn't make sense because they play other brand vehicles the same way,and they don't break.  The plastic has absolutely no give, it is super brittle<br /><br />The poor durability is a shame because Bruder designs are cooler than other brands inn terms of playability.  We no longer buy them though except if we see them at a garage sale for $2 (even then we don't usually buy them because they've often already broken then too!)
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I couldn't put the book down....I kept wanting to read more and more.  I found myself reading whenever I had a chance to!
0553386794|5.0|I love to read, & I'll read almost anything, but I am not a fantasy genre reader. On a whim I decided to start this series & it absolutely blew me away how much I loved it. GRRM world is so immense, so detailed, so believable. His dialogue rings true, and with such an expansive cast of characters, sometimes it can be hard to remember them all or they end up sounding alike, but all these characters are easily identifiable as themselves. The beginning of the book basically foreshadows central plot developments, then it delves into a slew of interesting characters. GRRM doesn't shy away from sexual situations or the fact that humans are not always totally good or totally bad. The books are much better than the HBO show, and the tv show's pretty awesome in my opinion! Lol. Be forewarned though, if you start this series, you will probably fall in love with it, so be prepared to be patient waiting on the next books to come out-GRRM is a very slow writer!
B008MG1E4A|5.0|My wife and I read this book to each other as we took turns driving on a long road trip. The detailed action kept us interested the entire trip. We finished reading the book before we returned home and are thankful for the insight into the hunt for UBL. A heartfelt \\"thank you\\" goes out from us to all of our troops, past and present, who sacrifice family and more.

B000KZFMZI|5.0|Since Friends, there hasn't been another show like this.  I would recommend everyone to see the series if they haven't already.
B007L3BMGA|1.0|Despite having an interesting storyline, the writing is plagued by such an abundance of feeble cliches and expressions that reading it gives one pause to consider whether the work was edited, and whether the irritation of reading such drivel is worth finding out if Anna finally choked to death when her heart stuck in her throat for the fiftieth time.
B00943SQCI|4.0|I thought this movie was quite entertaining. I got me some good lol's too even. Depp, just owns, ANY character he is given to play. The 70's revisited was fun too.<br /><br />Was too young to know the tv series show, but, nevertheless, still had no trouble following this plot.<br /><br />I think, if any, not too uptight, so they pick apart a movie, gave this flick a shot, for entertainment, would enjoy it. I sure did. Its nonsensical in a way, but, no doubt, a good watch, with open mind. I liked it. :)<br /><br />His Alice Cooper - ugliest woman I've ever seen line too, was too funny too :D
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Ads don't bother me. It's a great time waster for me and my children. Part of the challenge is earning points so you can get new games. Winter fishing is an easy one to earn points.
B00973CGXK|2.0|First off, I love the Killers. They are an amazing band, great energy and an awesome band to experience live. I've listened to this album at least 10 consecutive times and along previewing it here and there.<br /><br />With that said, this album was a complete disappointment. There are no driving melodies or riffs that are pinnacle in their older stuff. There is one or two good songs, but nothing as engaging or as emotional as their older stuff. It seems as though the band went from chasing the girl, or being the jilted lover which experienced many follies of youth, to a mature married group. This album reflects more of a band that is writing love songs for a serious relationship one that is in good emotional health and a lasting relationship. Rather than spotting a girl across the room and trying to win her, or love lost.<br /><br />If you like the Killers sound. It is here, but if you want the same energy and emotional attachment of their older stuff. it falls short.
B0094KF4WG|4.0|It was a well thought out book that reveals nothing top secret and confirms that the White House leeked the operation long before this book was published. The book is presented in a way that the reader feels the events and the life of this particular SEAL in the first person. Very well written and an honest humble approach to life.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|Haven't read a book like this for many years and now I know why!  I don't feel that I need to read the next two of the trilogy.
B0073CNGCC|5.0|Just cried my way through Episode 5 of Season Two.  Wonderful.  Cast is perfection.  Hope they win many Emmys this Sunday.

B0085TKAW6|1.0|Can buy this book for $20 AUD new hard cover at Coles KMart  in Australia !!! Kindle E Book  $18 AUD Go figure.<br />This blatant greed and little regard for your customers can only result in poor sales. I for one and many others ,judging<br />from other reviews will not be buying this book.
B006ZZANG0|5.0|Out of the Game is a melodious combination of Rufus Wainwright's multiple voices and intonations.  I have shared it with 3 generations to everyone's applause!

B002VPE1WK|5.0|I have been looking for a great camera bag that wasn't too expensive since I don't have a lot of money but need to carry my cameras around. You can set the compartments by adjusting the Velcro seperators. Amazon did an amazing job at plastering their logo all over the dang thing but at least the did it with shameless class and just put the logo on the zipper ends.<br /><br />There is plenty of space to pu all of your cables, chargers, lenses, ect...ect... Good bag even better buy.
B0033807E0|4.0|'The Battle of the Labyrinth', the fourth installment of Rick Riordan's bestselling 'Percy Jackson and the Olympians' series is simply the best yet.<br /><br />  Percy Jackson, as always, has burned down another school. And this time it's Paul Blofis' school. And again it isn't his fault. Being the son of Poseidon, it happens. But when Percy returns to Camp, things are worse than ever. They learn that Kronos' army are going to use the Labyrinth(an underground maze), built by Dedalus to infiltrate Camp. Percy, Annabeth, Tyson and Grover set out on their most dangerous quest yet. To seek out Dedalus' help and keep Kronos' Army at bay. In the quest a substory follows where Grover finds Pan, the God of the Wild, who states that mankind has led to destruction of wildlife and hence, he cannot live anymore. Full of twists and turns, this book has enough to keep you pouring into it!<br /><br />  This carefully thought out and vividly written  book by Rick Riordan has it all. A great storyline, an intelligently crafted plot and the feel of a book written by a teen! Once again Mr. Riordan brings Greek Mythology to life with a modern touch.<br /><br />  This one is sure to give 'Artemis Fowl' and 'Harry Potter' a run for their money!!!!!!

B0054LJGWS|4.0|After reading through Terry Pratchett's and Neil Gaiman's \\"Good Omens\\" for the 4th or 5th time, I realized I'd never written a review of it.  Obviously, with that many reading, I really like it.  But, is it a 4 star book or a 5 star book?  Yes, it is.  I'd really like to rate it at 5 stars:  excellent, fun, witty writing; interesting plot; good characters.  But, the way time passes in the book just nags at me.  It's not a pacing issue (interesting things happen throughout the book without dull spots).  It's just that the 1st half of the book (if you ignore the first 6 thousand years or so) covers 11 years of story time, while the last half covers just about 5 hours of story time (we'll, it's a bit more since there's some wrap-up).  It's not that it detracts from the story.  It's just that it's a bit irritating.  I wish I could give it 4-1/2 stars.  But, since I can't, I'll give it a Very Good 4 stars out of 5.<br /><br />PS:  at this time, the formatting for the Kindle edition has some problems.  A good portion of the letter x (usually in titles) has been replaced with asterisks.  Also, the formatting of Agnes Nutter's prophesies is so bad that they're essentially unreadable.  Hopefully, someday, the publisher will fix this.  I'm not holding these Kindle formatting problems against the book.  I'm just mentioning them.
B001M5UDGS|5.0|I remember when this first appeared online. A friend mentioned it to me and I stumbled on it right after the first episode aired. I loved every minute of it. So incredibly excited for it to be on DVD and blu ray. Fun and heartfelt and the music is very catchy.
B004I8WD6E|5.0|Looks great, seems strong I haven't dropped my phone yet (knock on wood!)It was easily installed and all features are accessible.
B00129H7VS|5.0|This is an amazing series made even more so by how incredible it looks on blu ray. It is absolutely worth the extra cost. If you're reading this, you don't need me to tell you about how great the whole thing is. Just know it looks A LOT better on blu ray.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|The book is really good and haven't been able to put the book down. It tells about the guys life as a child and all the stuff he learned and what happen.
B003XYE7R2|5.0|My favorite of all the Sherlock Holmes stories!  Also, one of the longest but those two things might be connected.<br /><br />Is there any setting more creepy, more perfect, more mysterious than those English moors?  And, even better is a ghost tale of a haunted hound from hell!  Combine Sherlock Holmes with an unnaturally large wild canine with glowing red eyes and you have the perfect mystery.<br /><br />When Lord Baskerville is found dead and the only clue is a large set of dog prints. Holmes is consulted so that a similar fate doesn't await the new heir of Baskerville Hall.  Unfortunately, Holmes is on a prior case and cannot go with Watson to the moors. Watson has to be the eyes of the story and relays information through letters and posts.  Holmes is only in the story briefly at the beginning and end--so how is he still the main character????  Only a master could pull that off.<br /><br />This is classic Holmes at his very best--secretive, ill-tempered, rude-and genius!  The ending was a complete surprise--a real shocker.  I had the same clues as Watson so why couldn't I solve it?  I ask myself that time and again with Holmes's stories.  Alas, I will never be a detective but with writing this good, it feels like I'm on the case anyway!<br /><br />Jolly good show!
B0026145WK|5.0|This was an action packed movie. Liam was so awesome in the main role. He did what all fathers would do if it happened to their kids. He was so well suited for this role. I can't wait to see Taken 2. There were parts in it that I screamed \\"Alright kick their A@@'s\\".
B005LAIGYQ|5.0|Must see!  I would highly recommend this for all Americans.  I believe this shows a realistic example of what SEALS/Special Forces must do and deal with.
B007KOYEOC|4.0|As you won't want to miss a minute getting into the second book. A dirty old romance.. Got me hooked. Refreshing.
0525953728|5.0|This book started off with a great hook, and it engages readers right away. I thoroughly enjoyed it, and I absolutely loved the vivid image that came to mind from the intense details. It was a very interesting topic to start, but the author did a fabulous job of chronicling everything perfectly. I admire how the author respected the privacy of SEAL members by changing the names also. He wrote everything so well, and it flowed very nicely. Great job to him! Very detailed and you will never get bored reading this book.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|This is a great book for anyone married who wants to maintain a great relationship or repair a broken one. This book opens up love in a whole new way. I had heard about this book from my sister, my husband and I have a good relationship but I was looking for something to read so I checked it out. I am so glad I did! This book helps you identify you and your mates \\"Love language\\" and speak it to each other to so you can always have a happy marriage and fill each others need for love. I would recommend this to anyone even if they don't have marital problems it is a great way to ensure you never will.

B001AW156U|1.0|A little bit of pressure will break the extremely thin tips of these things.  It wasn't even any kind of blunt incident that broke mine... I looked down and somehow they had broken.  Not worth the cardboard they're packaged in.  And don't get me wrong, I bought a pair from a different company (I wish I now knew which) and they've lasted for three years.  Just because it's plastic, doesn't mean it has to be cheap, but these certainly are VERY CHEAP.<br />Please find another company to buy from.
B008Z9YLV2|4.0|I enjoyed watching this movie.  It provided provocative insight concerning the transparency of governments, the telling of history by the winning side and the impact of those choices on the populace.  I appreciated that the story was told without excessive language or immodesty - it allowed me to focus on the governmental questions and the way government politicos attempt to manipulate the people whome they are supposed to serve.  Now, I need to read the book..
B004FOA84A|5.0|Great game, really enjoyed it, works perfect on my nook, only complaint is I wish it was longer, which hopefully the next one will be after this games success!  For those that like this game try The Haunt, lots of fun too but longer.
B007FEFLTO|1.0|I had been looking forward to reading this book since it was anounced but was disappointed to see the price. The hardcover price is $21.00 and the Kindle price is $19.99. I thought the purpose of e-books was to reduce the price of books since there are no printing costs. Analysts have said that Amazon sells the Kindle at next to zero profit. The strategy being to win income on content. I see that is now happening. I e-mailed Amazon compalining about the price and essentially they gave a non-answer noting various factors that affect cost without detail. If they had put the hardcover cost at say $28.00 there would probably have been no furor (as noted by seven 1 star reviews to date). I have been very pleased with the Kindle (I'm on my third)but if Amazon is going to price gouge to maximize profits I'll go back to normal books.
B007IXWKUK|3.0|The book is okay but without the suspense of the first one. It moves slowly, whereas with the first \\"Fifty Shades\\" I couldn't wait to see what happens. This second book has it's surprises, and certainly the erotic angle, but I personally found the original book much more titilllating and original. I will definitly read the third as it will complete the story, but I sure hope it's better than this one.
B0001I562I|5.0|So nice to find this movie, i grew up on it and so glad i can find it so my daughter can also!!!!!Thanks
B0084I9QI2|4.0|Normally I do not take points off for packaging, but the main thing about this cd/dvd set, is that it's more or less a cash grab by the powers that be to make the most money out of american icon as they can. We can debate whether or not some people might consider these types of packages as inevitable, and a must have. I would say it's a great improvement over the disc only version, because of remastered sound. So if you love the album that may be the only selling point you need. So when this package was put together, why did they feel the need to give it that rushed feel? The case is fine to some degree. It's sturdy with a magnetic flap to keep it closed. Artwork on the front is minimal. However there is no markings on any of the sides so if you wanted to put it on your cd shelves, you'd have to turn it around to where it takes up more room. I am a music collector so if it seems I'm being picky that is why. If the box would have had side markings I would not really question it. But that is a negative in my opinion. Also why not include the lyrics? this is touted as a deluxe package. I feel deluxe editions should be made to replace the old version completely and then expand on it. There are two books included with tons of pics, and even a description of the bonus songs included on cd 2. So that was cool.<br /><br />One booklet has pictures of him on stage during the year, with notations. The Second has pictures and the notations for the new songs as mentioned before. Overall the books were fine, just lacking lyrics or insight into the album songs themselves. Overall the sound quality is pretty good, but it seems a tad loud to me. but nothing really major. I have a top of the line sound cards so it may just need to be adjusted for the better sound quality. But this really isn't an issue, just a statement. I kind of wished they would have put it in a book like case such as the ultimate collection. as the box is more cd jewel case height and width but without side markings will look weird next to the other cds.<br /><br />the live cd is a plus and the dvd is pretty much the visual to the live cd (with a few bonuses). One thing I must add too since I am being picky. The cds/dvd come in two digipack type cases. the one I had the fold  was lopsided a bit. For collectors this is a pain. I would have rather seen four individual sleeves for each disc. Much like the duran duran remasaters (those are excellent remasters/deluxe editions as well). It was nice to have the dvd concert and of course the live cd. So that pretty much is the selling point for this set. Now they need to go back and redo off the wall and thriller.<br /><br />There is also a two sided poster and another and a cool bad25 sticker (cd sized)I like the look/design that should have been the box art in my opinion (unless that is what they wanted me to do with t he sticker?) The bonus songs are nice, and the ones from the previous version of Bad are included). I think they did miss the mark by not including a dvd of Moonwalker) as I can't hear \\"Leave Me Alone\\" without thinking of that video. Overall everything looks and sounds great, so yes this is a recommended upgrade).  I am surprised there were not more outtakes (and less remixes) but I get the feeling Michael Jackson is no Prince (as he is rumored to have hundreds to thousand in his vault). So there may not have been a lot laying around to actually include.<br /><br />So what's my opinion? packaging could be better, but this is still a must have, and isn't too expensive. Though I would have paid more if moonwalker was included). The sound and video look and sound great, so I'd definitely recommend this one. The outtakes are more than worth it as Michael doesn't have too much extra stuff that didn't already end up on the album. so you will probably love it, and if u are not as picky as me you will love it even more than I do.But the packaging in my opinion needs to be fixed up a bit.

B008N9AAQ4|4.0|This is a breathtaking film.  At times, it feels as though the viewer is high above the earth watching a high speed view of life as it occurs on a daily basis in many countries and cultures throughout the world.<br /><br />There are a few sequences, however, which are very disturbing, and are shocking enough to make me feel like they took me out of the film for a short time.  Those sequences also make it difficult for me to recommend the film to anyone without warning.  Although I am reticent to include any kind of spoiler in a review, I will say that the sequences have to do with how we slaughter our food.  If you cannot bear it, you may want to rent this film later, and skip over those sequences.<br /><br />Absent those sections of the film, I would have seen this film as many times as I could have fit into my schedule while it is on the big screen.  Given those sequences, I'll wait and rent it.  They are simply too vivid for me to want to see again.<br /><br />With this heads up, enjoy this film... It is incredible.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|very addictive coins should have extra weight so you can get mega prizes. loving it :) thirty seconds does go by pretty fast.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I have just finished the last book in this series still wanting more to read.... Loved this series  got really into the books and couldnt put them down.
B008BM9L72|5.0|Just finished the trilogy and found it entertaining and absorbing.  Found that Christian was a convoluted character but with some interesting traits.  Anastasia a most forgiving and obliging, but strong individual personality. The perfect foil for Christian.
B001NHNG64|4.0|Great read on my Kindle Fire.  Jack Reacher is a great hero and I look forward to his next adventure(for some reacher his 3rd book is not on kindle so I have skipped to number 4)  This one sets Jack against home grown militias in the Northwest forests.
B002VHI8FE|5.0|I've been told that I need to post reviews for my favorites & not just the boring wastes of time.<br />Abercrombie is the BEST - period.<br />Great characters<br />Great ACTION<br />Great story<br />GREAT ACTION<br /><br />Not a series about heroes & villains...<br />More about the evil in us all.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|This seems to be an account of one person's experience with the SEALS. I was concerned that it might be an anti Obama<br />account, but it wasn't. He did mention that the honchos would probably take the credit for getting Usama if they were successful, but this was the normal type of complaint from the grunts doing the work. I enjoyed it. It reads like a Tom Clancy novel.
B004JRVQX0|1.0|This product did not do me any good cause it does not come with preauthorization for the software I have I was not aware of this before I bought it so I am stuck with it
B008KWHKGM|4.0|When I first heard this CD was coming out I was stoked! Then when I heard it I was slightly disappointed because I think Tourist History ( their first album ) was a bit better. I think the sound of the first was just a wee bit better. I think it has it's ups and downs. Over all I was pleased with the sound after listening to it a few times.  I love love love the live versions on the second disc.....amazing. Definitely worth the purchase.:) My top five on the album.<br />1:[[ASIN:B0092YS0YS Sun]]<br />2:[[ASIN:B0092YRZKI Handshake]]<br />3:[[ASIN:B0092YS05C Wake Up]]<br />4:[[ASIN:B0092YS3FO Settle]]<br />5:[[ASIN:B0092YS4L2 Spring]]
B006YC74E8|5.0|One of the few free app that works great with the new Kindle Fire HD  camera. Also has tons of photo editing options to improve the photo quality.
B006ZDS7CE|5.0|Every song from this album is unique and captivating in its own way.  Lana's voice is magical, with a old star power quality.
B0091XRL86|4.0|A lot of humor meant for adults, but my son (7) loved it, too.  It was one I would be willing to watch again. I know I missed a few bits.  Much better than most movies these days that are made for kids.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book is great! I would recomend The Hunger Games to anybody to read. They are all wonderful books and left me sitting on the edge of my seat. I couldn't put the books down. I like it b/c it is not filled with sex or cursing. Great book!
B005UBNKWO|5.0|I built my system from scratch. Motherboard, ram, CPU,hard drive and power supply, case everything. This CPU is really great. This thing does more in one instant than my old Pentium system did in two days. I would recommend this CPU to anyone in the market wanting to build a new system. Hands down the best CPU on the market today.
B008RV5K5E|5.0|this might be the best batman movie i have ever seen. it was great seeing bruce old and still tearing it up. Fantastic. cant wait till part 2
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Good read... nothing classified here... no threats to national security... just a concise, compelling account of a monumental day in U.S. history... a testimony of heroes... proceeds donated to charity.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|Until I had downloaded Angry Birds for my Kindle Fire I had successfully avoided playing it.  It is addictive goofy fun!
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|This game is a great way to relax and kill time. The only downside is later quests require purchased items (real money)which I will not do.
B008MEM24S|4.0|This game is very fun and even better than the original Where's My Water? but it is TO agrivating! It is to hard for the brain!
B0080SZ0V8|5.0|I almost never review games, but couldn't resist commenting on these parts of the game since several people seemed to have trouble with it. With the robots: only place arrows on the square that you need the robot to turn on, not the ones in between. He'll keep traveling in the same direction until he runs into a new arrow. In the dots and lines games touch the screen in between the two dots you wish to connect as touching the dots can send the line in any direction. Finished within a few hours on a Kindle Fire HD. No glitches, good graphics, decent music, moderately challenging puzzles with a few easy and a few difficult puzzles thrown in.
B008MG1E4A|3.0|I appreciate what the SEALS did and and continue to do and their willingness to give their lives for citizens of the U.S.A. They are amazing, but the only part that was at all gripping was the part at the first of the book that was included in the \\"sample\\" of the book that I downloaded. Obviously, his time as a SEAL was defined by training, then missions, then rest and then more of the same; so there was no getting around that pattern over and over as part of the manuscript, however, the manuscript needed more descriptions and use of adjectives. He failed to give very many extended details about things that could have made the book more interesting without giving away any military secrets. There could have been descriptions of the weather they had to endure on missions---heat, sweat, sandstorms, or whatever--and how different conditions are in those countries from most of the U.S. I'm sure there were bugs and snakes and spiders and scorpions and all kinds of things that made their missions physically miserable and these could have been described. He may have thought giving these kinds of details would make him and the other SEALS seem less manly and fierce, but these details could have been given just to make the reader get a feel for the conditions people in the military endure for those of us who are comfortable here in the U.S. More descriptions of his thoughts as he was in various situations would have been good. Some of his descriptions could have been amped up with more adjectives or explanation. He is absolutely to be commended for giving credit to all the men involved in every mission he went on and to all the men who have given their lives during their missions. He does not imply that he is the hero, but that each SEAL was important in his own way to each mission.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|Little too much with the \\" we are professionals\\" stuff, it is understood throughout the book and other Seal books that they are professionals and no need to keep reminding us. Other than that I loved the book especially the way it began with the Seals in the helicopter and the raid going bad and then to the story of his life and the Seal training and the planning of the raid. I could keep going with run on sentences but I'll stop her, iPhone typing is killin me.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Love pinterest there's so much awesome stuff on there and I love the app. So much easier to use on my kindle then going to the website through the browser
B008MG1E4A|5.0|This account of the bin Laden mission was quite well written and not dramatized.  The deployment accounts were straight forward, as most people would describe their jobs, without any of the sensationalism that the media relies on to sell their stories.  Very well done.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|If there was a rating of 100, I would give that to this author and her writings.  I very much enjoyed the whole triogy and am hoping she writes more to this story.  I know quite a few people who feel the same way.  E.L. James gets you right into this story line and keeps you there, as well as wanting more.
B0087HT36U|4.0|I love this game, but I'm so frustrated with it. I've beaten every level except 2-28 and I'm not sure it CAN be beaten (aka get a gold crown). There isn't enough time to get a shot off before the cart races in and one of the girls always dies. I've seen videos on YouTube to solve it (which I hate doing, but I got desperate) , but they are for iPhone and that version clearly has more time to get the shot off. I'm going to keep trying and hope I get it by accident, but it's so annoying not to be able to complete it. I hope the developers fix it.
B004SDSSFY|5.0|The program operates smoothely and works well with MS Office files...Excel & Word without any difficulty. I had to learn some new functions and shortcuts but the learning curve was very short and easy to learn.
B001K3KK0Q|5.0|Great movie with great actors. Very beliveable. I've seen trailers to the new \\"Gatsby\\", comming soon and it's exagerated, over the top and not really beliveable, if you know anything about that era. Bruce Dern is my favorite \\"Bad Guy\\" of all time.The movie seems to have a soft, visual tone to it that really parallels the imagination when you actually read Stienbeck's novel.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I haven't been one to read much over the past several years and still don't do it during my free time at home, but this one was close to being an exception. I ride the train to and from work and wanted something to pass the time. I got this book and was quickly pulled into the story and I loved it. I looked forward to the train rides so I could see what happened next!
B007FG9LIE|5.0|This book is what the kindle.fire is for. Can't put it down and had to take it to work type of book.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. A great first hand account. I don't see why the Pentagon is upset. I spent 21 yrs in the military and nothing in this book was classified.
B00992CF6W|5.0|my moms kinlde got it but mine dint get it what do I do! !!!!!!help.the reason is I love it
B000I9VOO4|3.0|The book is so much better. The movie, I purchased was not what I expected after reading the book. I would not recommend it's purchase to anyone.
B001HN6EF4|5.0|We've put these cards through the ringer, hot water, cold water, under water, dropped, thrown and they've took it all with only one card getting some cosmetic scratches. They do stick together if they're wet, so I recommend giving them a good shuffle when they're dry, but even wet it's still possible to shuffle them (just a bit harder).<br /><br />The only negative thing I can say about them is the carabiner that comes with them is difficult to put on and take off, but that can easily be swapped out if it bothers you. Personally I don't mind, so I'm still using the one that comes with it.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|i bought all the coin magnet stuff for the rides, you know for lil stomper and stuff.<br /><br />but when i leave. only.one if the magnet upgrade is active. please make all upgrades when you turn.on the game
B0058UXHHK|3.0|Not a bad read, just a little predictable.  I have the next one in the series, but haven't started it yet.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Great read. Found the controversy around this book rediculous. No secrets given away. Only problem I see is how it explains the rediculously tight restrictions placed on our hero's which restrict their ability to do the job and worse, put their lives in more danger than they already are. I guess if I was in DC I too would get upset about this book.
0345803507|5.0|These books are page turners and not just because of the sex. The story line between Ana and Christian is believable based on the relationships and home lives they had. I would read this trilogy again for sure to see what I might have missed.
B004SIPA4G|4.0|great comic book movie... great talents... great for Bruce Willis and it shows more than the theatrical release and great special effects
0312117337|5.0|I love these cards! I use them in times of confusion or a need for clarity and they provide insight and wisdom for me every time. I also love giving them as a gift, especially for the people who are hard to find things for.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|is good game. i must reccomend you play it, is very good. come on and play this game. you know you want to
B00956UPSW|1.0|i wanted to like this album, but it just did not work for me. sounds like filler material that did not make the last album. kinda like that awful metallica 'magnetic' ep. sorry but that is just the way i feel.
B007GCY8FS|3.0|I love everything Reacher but was a bit unsatisfied after reading A Wanted Man. Just not enough of the kick-butt Reacher that I love to see (Jack didn't beat up anyoe until the last 100 pages!). It was also quite a bit like several of his other novels. I was entertained, but I'm going back to my Reacher library to re-read another Lee Child novel so I can get the Reacher-fix I was looking for with this one.  Love you Lee Child, and please keep them coming, but give us a little more next time.
B0087HT36U|5.0|If you like Angry Birds you will LOVE this game! I was the biggest fan of the Birds but this blew the Birds out of the water. CANNOT WAIT FOR MORE LEVELS!!!!!!! Where can I buy the characters of this game?
0553801473|5.0|Great book, happy to hear from all the characters that were left out of the last book ,but please no 6 year wait for winds of winter.
B008ZTVQLA|5.0|Simply put, Ian Hunter is a legend. This disc shows that the cream still rises to the top. Put \\"When I'm President\\" right at the top of his solo catalog. From the first track \\"Comfortable\\" to the last one \\"Life\\", this album ROCKS. I only regret two things about this cd- First, I wish it was a 2cd set, and second, I wish more people were exposed to his talent. The absolute crap on the radio today- including the bullshit AOR stations that only play the same 300 songs just about guarantees that \\"When I'm President\\" will only get sparse airplay. Support Ian- buy his CD- go see him live- you will be blown away at his energy at 73 years young. 5 stars. Old Records never Die- Old Legends just keep getting better.
B00005S6K8|2.0|Greg Kinear was great of course. He is incapable of giving a bad performance and the part was perfect for him. No William Holden by any means but he did a good job.  Julia Ormond was so miscast that it was pathetic.  In her one scene when she has just arrived from Paris and is supposed to be so stunning, she simply ISN'T.  What was so bad was that they show her all the time she is in Paris looking terrible then we are supposed to believe that the day before she left Paris she got a makeover. Ridiculous. I guess nobody could have stood the comparison with Audrey Hepburn but she wasn't even in the ballpark. Harrison Ford did the best he could but he was just terribly miscast. Sometimes I've wondered - does he really think that heavy breathing through his nose is acting?  Trust me, if you want to see \\"Sabrina\\", get a copy of the original B&W.
B008UTV6S8|5.0|I'm sitting listening to a live album by a man who is at least three or four years older than me (I'm sixty seven), and he's kicking the butt of every twenty year old guitarist in America.<br /><br />This is not a deep, reflective review on Paul Simon's place in American music -- although I do think he is THE 20th century American songwriter -- nor is it a track-by-track analysis.  This is only to say that here is a live album by a great singer/songwriter in his prime, and who is obviously enjoying the hell out of where he is.  The DVD of the concert is excellent, and for a little over fourteen bucks the two CDs of music are almost a bonus.  Enjoy.
B005S9EJ46|5.0|20 minutes cut from film? Is this true? The rental states 2hours 4 minutes in length,the Blue Ray-124 minutes,so they are equal. Watch it with a stopwatch? I think not. If you buy to play on the new Kindle 8.9\\",is it 124 minutes?--Thanks for the correction,Michael C.---JJB
B008JGSM6G|5.0|it takes in constration and it lets you only think about getting to the right route its a game that puts you in total contration and focus i could lift and eye off this game when someone was talking to me :)
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I enjoyed the books.  I purchased all three of the books (Trilogy).  I am currently reading the 3rd book.  Amazon was a quick way to purchase, download, and read the books while on vacation.  I downloaded the interface to the Kindle for my IPAD.  A friend had the Kindle.  The Kindle is easier to read with than the IPAD.  It does not produce the glare in sunlight like the IPAD does.
B001RTP3YQ|5.0|I saw the concert Leonard Cohen performed in London in 2008 on a California PBS channel and was awestruck by the strength of his performance, the joy he got from singing and interacting with his musicians, and the timelessness of his music.  So I ordered the DVD the next day and have been playing it frequently ever since.  I had sort of \\"lost touch\\" with his work so most of the numbers were new to me, but even the old stuff still sounded fresh and revived with new phrasing and sensitivity.  If that's a man in his 70's, well, he has more creativity and sex appeal than people 1/4 his age!  I hear something new in his songs every time I listen!
B0028MBKVG|4.0|Being a runner, I was looking for a new book to inspire me to run more. Although not exactly inspirational, this book did make me think more about what running means to me.<br /><br />The author weaved a nice story together with interesting characters and plot. The story ends with a race in the Mexican mountains, but to get to that point many side plots about running, running technique, running shoes, and the ultra-marathoning culture are revealed. I didn't come away wanting to try barefoot running after this book, but it did make me think running on the track once a week in thin shoes might be good for my feet.<br /><br />All-in-all a good read as I thoroughly enjoyed it.
B00153ZC8Q|5.0|Of all the Terminator movies this is my favorite. The story starts, and the saga begins. Many Terminator movies have come after this one, yet I just don't get into them as much. The memory of the 'Not Knowing' of the first movie comes with emotions. This one is my favorite by far.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|This was a very factual which in my opinion desclosed no national secrets not already leaked by the Obama Administration. I am a retired Officer of 26 years who was involved in Security Clearances for years to include an Atomic Q clearance. Great book - Author needs to be praised - not villified
B003TOMAPC|5.0|If you can enjoy sick, and bloody humor with your action adventure than this is a movie you must see. You can't help but laugh at the journey with these comic style superheros, and root them on as they go through this adventure. I Love This Movie!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|such a great game... youh just want to sit and play all day. its very addicting my mom yells at me to quit playing at least 20 times a day!
B0038M2AZA|5.0|This video suprised me on how excellent it was.  I purchased it for myself and having family and friends watch it also.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|This was a great book.  A real insight into what our highly trained soldiers must go through to carry out their job.  Our politicians must stop trying to manage military actions based upon political pols.  Let our armed forces carry out their missions as they see fit.  We continue to weaken our military.

B00278U1W0|5.0|Fabulous show. Both superb. Finally, a chance to guess at Blind Faith potential. Winwood`s voice, at times, struggles and the diction is hard to follow and Clapton tends to repeat certain sections, possibly, too much.<br />However, the versions of Little Wing and Voodoo Chile are magnificent. On Voodoo Chile, Winwoods vocals are majestic and Clapton`s growling, understated riff playing are menacing and Hendrix-like. When they reach the chorus line, it doesn`t get any better....The finest blues singer in top form, still with that distinctive Ray Charles echo and the greatest axeman soaring beautifully...and what about the Hammond organ, shrill and fruity. It`s all like a slow version of the Winwood classic Gimmie Some Lovin`.<br />I would like to have heard the Clapton classic Badge and Winwood`s I`m a Man. It`s marvellous to hear two 60 year olds playing great music and not safe, middle of the road stuff. Epic concert.<br />The DVD was excellent..well worth it and the cameramen were patient, all the time. Great close ups of both men. Far better than being there and seeing dots perform. The second DVD was interesting and some of the old footage of Blind Faith and Traffic brought back memories, as did the stills of the Spencer Davis group.
B008MEM24S|5.0|I have never seen Phineas and Ferb but I love this game. The lasers drive my nuts trying to figure them out but once I do I get excited. This is one of the few games that I don't seek out help on defeating a level.<br /><br />It would be nice if Disney would update the game quicker but seeing as I don't have to pay for little ad ons (I am looking at you Where's My Water) it is a minor concession.
B006G3MZRQ|5.0|Warrior is one of the year's best films that has everything audiences are looking for in a sports movie experience. Visually exciting fight sequences are matched by an emotionally complex story with believable characters full of conviction.
B0087HT36U|4.0|Played on Kindle Fire<br /><br />I found this to be a fun game. Granted, as some have said it is similar to Angry Birds but not enough to detract from the play. I thoroughly enjoyed the pirates and can't wait for the cowboys.<br /><br />Why it needs an update - There are a couple of levels that it is impossible to blow up the bombs quick enough. I looked at some youtube videos and it seems ad if on the ipod you don't have the wait time. This prevents getting a gold crown and blocks certain play.
B008CLI3TE|1.0|I only found this out after purchasing the product. It does not play on my JVC Blu-ray player. Apparently there is plenty of feedback online with the same issues of failure to play. Some workarounds suggested like leaving a formatted USB flashdrive did not work. Too bad for such an acclaimed series.

030758836X|2.0|The first half of this book is a decent read.  The storyline moves along and keeps you engaged.  But, the second half of the book just becomes unrealistic and stupid.  The book eventually just ends.  There is no wrap up.  Like another reviewer said, it was like the author couldn't figure out a good ending so just quit.  It was very disappointing.

0345803485|1.0|A friend of mine loaned me the series. I started as one does with book 1. I forced myself to read the first 4 chapters and then just couldn't do it anymore. It was too painful to try to continue. I even sent her a text at one point (as we traded books- she liked what I lent better) that said that I would rather pluck my eyes out with tweezers then continue. I meant it.<br />The writing is so far beyond horrible that there isn't a good enough word. It's kinky-twilight without vampires. I hated Twilight because of the juvenile writing; this is worse.<br /><br />Seriously, if you want to read a story about a different kind of lifestyle that involves an actual plot, there are tons of books available that are fantastic and less than $10.<br /><br />Never judge a book by its cover. This series has great covers and complete crap for content.

B0052RE4MQ|3.0|As I have pondered upon this book and the last, I have determined that this series is largely psychological.  The questions the author seems to be asking are:<br /><br />* What would you do?<br />* How would you respond?<br />* Would you be overcome by fear or would you do what needed to be done?<br /><br />Though there were aspects of this book that I enjoyed, there were others I didn't care for at all.  Because of that, this book only gets a 3-star rating.<br /><br />I was happy to see Cassia and Ky making more choices based on what they wanted, not on what Society dictated.  Because they have been moved from their home borough, to the Outer Provinces, there is more action than hiking to the \\"top of the hill.\\"  Was it sit-on-the-edge-of- your-seat, biting-your-fingernails action?  No.  However, it was more than we experienced in the first novel.<br /><br />Both Cassia and Ky, for different reasons, know that Society is the true enemy.  Their adventures start on different roads.  (Wasn't there a poem about that once?  I'm sure it wasn't in the top 100. It starts out, \\"Two roads diverged in a yellow wood....\\"  Sorry, I couldn't resist!)  Anyway, though ripped violently from one another, they are determined to be reunited.  If they are, will they find that they share the same goals?  Do they really love each other or are they obsessed with one another because Society says they cannot be?  Will they find that they, \\"Took the one (road) less traveled by, And that has made all the difference?\\"  (Frost, The Road Not Taken)  Okay, I promise, no more poetry quips.<br /><br />The use of both Ky and Cassia's perspectives, in alternating chapters, really didn't work for me.  Their voices were too similar.  Often, I found myself going back to the chapter heading to see whose perspective I was supposed to be hearing.  I have seen this work beautifully in other pieces, but unfortunately it didn't here.  It wasn't horrible, but it was a huge distraction.<br /><br />For me, this book didn't succeed in taking the series to the next level.  I am hopeful that the final book of the series will be able to do that.

0385344333|4.0|I've been a Lee Child/Jack Reacher fan from the get go. I notice that \\"Wanted Man\\" got some pretty bad reviews & yes, i think it is ridicoulous that Tom Cruise (a fine action actor, yes, but physically night & day different from jack reacher!)<br /><br />That said, i enjoyed the book & found it a entertaining read. Yes, there were many things that required quite the stretch of the imagination to accept (i.e. not logical or believable or likely) but hey, it's a book & after 17 books i imagine it is hard to make an action plot that hangs completely together.<br /><br />The plot has some interesting twists & book moved fast. ok, all the time in the car in the first 100 pages was a bit much but hey, if a book bogs down, start skimming! it's your life, enjoy it! no law says you have to read every single word? read the 1st & last sentences of each paragraph & you will get the gist. (long paragraphs, catch a middle sentence; lose your way, back up & slow down till you find the thread again).
0385344333|3.0|I was so looking forward to receiving my new Reacher book.  I have read them all - and had the stage all set for hunkering down with several happy hours of JR and his life of adventure.  Well, the first part of the book was okay - from the middle on it was just boring.  No relationships, no real bad guy, just (as another reviewer said - a road trip).  I wish i had read the reviews before i spent the money.  Lee - did you write this?  I find it hard to believe you did.  Sob.
B006FE83U4|5.0|\\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\" is one of the finest stories ever put on film; and the hero of that story, Atticus Finch (who is played by the incomparable Gregory Peck), has to be one of the most admirable characters ever portrayed on the silver screen.  If I could give this move more than five stars, I would.  But, since I can only give it five stars, I'll have to be content with that.  But please note that my five-star rating is for the movie itself, not for the special features included on this disc, which I found to be something of a letdown, in all honesty.  (More on this later.)  But the movie itself deserves the highest rating I can give it.  It is a cinematic masterpiece that everyone ought to see.<br /><br />In 1960, Harper Lee (a childhood friend of celebrated writer Truman Capote), published her only novel, \\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\", which was based loosely on her own childhood memories of growing up in the small, sleepy, Southern town of Monroeville, Alabama, during the Great Depression.  Lee maintains that the novel is not autobiographical, since many of the events it depicts are fictional; but the setting and characters are based on the places and people she knew as a child.  The narrator, Jean Louise \\"Scout\\" Finch, is based on Harper Lee herself.  Scout's devoted father, the respected local attorney, Atticus Finch, is based on Lee's own father, who was a lawyer.  And Dill Harris, the boy who spent his summers living at his aunt's house next door to the Finches, is based on Truman Capote.  Even the reclusive Radley family, who rarely ventured outside of their spooky, boarded-up house down the street from the Finches, is based on an actual family who lived near the Lees.  They, too, had a mysterious son they kept hidden from view because they were ashamed of him, just like Boo Radley in the novel.  In fact, most of the characters in the novel were based, at least loosely, on real people Harper Lee knew as a child.  Perhaps that's part of the reason why this story feels so real.  The portrait that Lee paints of life in the Depression-era Deep South is not only realistic, but vivid and nuanced.  She is able to honestly portray the hardships of poverty and the evils of racism that she witnessed as a child without ever crossing the line into caricature, and without in any way undermining her nostalgic portrayal of the magical innocence of childhood.<br /><br />\\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\" became a runaway bestseller, and ended up winning the Pulitzer Prize in 1961.  And, even though the plot of the novel was not obviously well-suited to be adapted for the silver screen, it was made into a major motion picture the following year, with one of the biggest names in Hollywood, Gregory Peck, as its star.  The movie wasn't able to depict everything that happened in the book, of course.  (No movie ever can.)  But we are fortunate that the talented screenwriter, Horton Foote, was able to find the essence of the story in Harper Lee's novel and turn it into a brilliant screenplay.  What we end up with is a film that doesn't feel like a typical Hollywood movie.  Instead, it feels more like an actual look at someone's bittersweet memories of childhood.<br /><br />I'm no literary critic; so I won't even attempt to plumb the depths of this story.  It's far too rich for even a cursory exploration of its many themes in a review such as this.  But I do want to comment very briefly on what I believe to be the single greatest thing about this story: the character of Atticus Finch.  There are few people I can think of -- either in the real world or in works of fiction -- who are even remotely as admirable as Atticus Finch.  I find it hard to even imagine a better role model for a young person (especially a young man) to emulate.  He represents, at least in my view, the ideal father, the ideal lawyer, the ideal citizen, the ideal gentleman, and perhaps even the ideal human being.  As a father, he sets a good example for his children, treats them with respect and kindness, nurtures them, allows them a measure of independence, encourages their curiosity, answers their questions as honestly as he can, tries his best to instill in them the right values, and gently explains things to them rather than lecturing them or yelling at them.  As a lawyer, he has the highest possible standards of ethics and integrity, genuine compassion for his clients, a non-cynical respect for the law, and a commitment to justice.  As a citizen, he is dutiful, respectful, trustworthy, hospitable, neighborly, tolerant, and unbigoted.  As a gentleman, he is humble, peaceable, dignified, self-controlled, stalwart, courageous, and polite.  And, as a human being, he is virtuous, kind, empathetic, hopeful, and wise.  I wish I were even half the man that Atticus Finch is.  The world would be a much better place if it had more Atticus Finches in it.<br /><br />This is a movie that everyone ought to watch.  Not only is it a good story, with wonderful characters and a fascinating setting; but it also has some great lessons to teach about life, and about what it means to be a decent, honorable person.  Everyone needs to be exposed to the example of Atticus Finch, who is one of the noblest heroes ever portrayed on film.  I can't praise this movie highly enough; nor can my words do justice to it.  You've simply got to see it for yourself.<br /><br />Unfortunately, my five-star review has to come with this caveat:  While the movie itself is great, the special features on this disc are, at least in my view, underwhelming at best.  The documentary \\"Fearful Symmetry\\", which tells the story of the real-life people and places behind the novel, and how the novel was turned into a movie, is pretty interesting. And, being a total geek, I actually enjoyed the mini documentary on film restoration that was included on this disc, which showed how various old movies, including \\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\", have been restored for digital release on DVD and Blu-ray.  But theother special features didn't really appeal to me all that much.  I think that Gregory Peck was a brilliant actor and an admirable human being; but the Gregory Peck hagiography on this disc simply went too far, in my opinion.  The special features included with this motion picture should have been about the movie itself, or about Harper Lee's story, rather than about the star of the film.  But four of the nine special features on this disc were about the life and career of Gregory Peck, and a fifth (an interview with Mary Badham, who played Scout in the movie) spent more time talking about what a great person Gregory Peck was than about anything else.  For starters, there was a feature-length documentary that Peck's daughter co-produced, chronicling her father's reminiscences during his later years when he went on tour holding Q&A sessions before live audiences, which I might have enjoyed had it been edited down to a more reasonable length of half-an-hour or so, but which was simply exhausting at its actual running time of 97 minutes.  In addition to this there were two very short clips showing Gregory Peck giving acceptance speeches, first for his Best Actor Oscar for his performance in \\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\", and second for his Lifetime Achievement Award from the American Film Institute.  He didn't really have much to say on either occasion; so I'm not sure why these were included.  But what really puzzled me was the inclusion of a poor-quality, amateur video recording of Peck's daughter speaking at a ceremony honoring her late father after his death.  I found these special features a bit disappointing.  But they can't take away from the overall quality of the movie.  I seriously doubt that anyone bases their decision about whether or not to buy a movie on the quality of the special features included on the disc.  Even if there were no special features on this disc at all, the movie would still be worth buying; and I highly recommend it.
B000J5XS3C|3.0|If I had the choice I would definitely not use this for any sort of professional production or performance equipment, but for basic leaning purposes as to how mixers work I would recommend this simply for the low price. There is a lot of noise on the line when you plug into it and the pre-amps were less than impressive to say the least. Overall though it will be an entertaining little board to play with.

0385340575|5.0|One late night (or early morning) while travelling on a subway, Jack Reacher observes his fellow passengers in the subway car. One of the passengers, a lady, fits in a perfect profile of a suicide bomber. Reacher decides to confront her only to have her kill herself and set a chain of events into motion. Few authorities feel that Reacher knows more than he is revealing and have him followed while Reacher encounters a variety of characters. Some are beautiful, some are powerful, some are corrupt, some are rich, some are influential and some are real good bad guys. But they all have one thing in common - they are all lying to Reacher. Will Reacher be able to bring an end to the events that he inadvertently set into motion?<br /><br />The answer is yes, of course! Did you ever doubt it? If you have read Reacher before then you shouldn't have had a single ounce of doubt about Reacher's capabilities. If you haven't read Reacher before, well what are you doing reading this review? I can assure you that my reviews cannot do justice to the enigma that Reacher is - so just go and pick up one of his adventures right now.<br /><br />This particular story is set in New York, making the playing field much more glamorous and dangerous at the same time. This is not any small town that Reacher is passing through. This is New York - the city that never sleeps and the city that is a home to the most powerful and influential people. And Reacher's action has affects a lot of plans made not only in New York, but also in Washington and Afghanistan. So this time the game gets bigger and more dangerous with a lot of people's plans and life on the line.<br /><br />Lee Child's easygoing style of narration has always been one of the highlights of the series. It is no different this time. While his writing often alternates between first person and third person, I am glad that this was one of the books that he had decided to write in first person. It gave us a chance to get into Reacher's psyche once again - seeing what and how he sees things and knowing what he is thinking gave this book a nice edge.<br /><br />This is now my second Jack Reacher favourite (first is Die Trying) - thoroughly enjoyed the mystery, the thrills and the intrigue. Go people - get your hands and paws on this one.e once again - seeing what and how he sees things and knowing what he is thinking gave this book a nice edge.<br /><br />This is now my second Jack Reacher favourite (first is Die Trying) - thoroughly enjoyed the mystery, the thrills and the intrigue. Go people - get your hands and paws on this one.

B003LL3LHO|4.0|If you're looking at this, you're probably interested in the world of \\"Guild Wars\\". If that's the case, I would say this book is a very solid read.

B00005MCWZ|5.0|This album has many great things in it. For one it's starts off with Hurry On Sundown, still one of my favorite songs of all time. Has great songs like Be Yourself which innovate Space Rock. Mirror Of Illusion is yet another one of my all time favorite songs and probably one of if the best Hawkwind songs for me. Than this version also includes bonus tracks. Normally I don't like versions of albums with bonus tracks, because I like to hear the album the way it originally sounded, but that is not the case here. This bonus tracks are great songs like Kiss Of The Velvet Whip, and the alternate version of Hurry On Sundown are great and really work when listening to the whole album. It even includes the song Cymbaline, which is a cover of a Pink Floyd song. Owning the album More I think the Pink Floyd version is a little stronger, but still a great track.
B007GCY8FS|3.0|at first i was wondering what all the whining was about. i was enjoying what i thought was pretty standard child/reacher fare. i must admit though that the ending really was convoluted and as another reviewer commented ,too many wheels within wheels and it really did not complement all that went before. i also found myself skipping through the last twenty percent.
B00005REQR|5.0|Well, after reading other reviews I wouldn't suggest you buy it off amazon because this particular master is screwed up, but a great album you should seek anyhow.<br /><br />What can I say, it's Gong. This was part of a trilogy consisting of this, Angel's Egg, and You. When I first listened knowing no more than that, this is going to be a psychedelic album, and never before having heard Gong, I'll admit, although I liked it... I didn't quiet get it. I had been a huge fan of Syd era Floyd and other similar stuff, and got the whimsical side of it, but until learning it was part of trilogy and told a story I found the lyrics a bit outlandish. It grew on me quickly and I soon found myself seeking out Angel's Egg and You.<br /><br />The music is all very well done. I've heard people describe it as all sorts of things. Terms like progressive rock, space rock, psychedelic rock, and jazz rock, but it really isn't fair to label it as ONE of those things because it has elements of all and so much more.

B008J34466|5.0|First off, I'd like to say this is a great album. From start to finish I was never bored or like, hmm, this song sounds like a filler. She's got stuff to say and yes, we've heard it before, the relationship angst and what not. But how predictable would it be for P!nk to put out an album full of cutesy songs about her daughter? She would've been slammed so hard. Instead she let us know she's here to stay, and I'm thrilled.<br /><br />Now on the swearing subject. DO YOU GUYS NOT KNOW WHO P!NK IS? HOW DARE YOU BUY A P!NK ALBUM AND BE OFFENDED BY THE F WORD? SHE HAD A SONG CALLED \\"F****** PERFECT\\". It's like buying a lemon and being like \\"oh my god, this lemon, i just didn't realize it was going to be sour\\". durrr, lemons are sour, p!nk says the f word. Let's move on.<br /><br />\\"Try\\" is a standout song. It's actually one of my favorite P!nk songs in her 6 album career.
0812548094|1.0|TG blatantly stole from WOT. The example are legion. To begin with, there is the striking similarity between female wielders of power, the Aes Sedai and the Sisters of the Light. Plus, each has a dark, secret sect amongst them: Black Ajah vs. Sisters of the Dark. There is also the fact that male users of the power suffer and eventually die if they don't find ways to get their power under control. Add to this, Stone of Tear vs. Stone of Tears, the use of collars to subdue magic use, Caracarn vs. Caharan, sword forms used by blade wielders, ageless female users of the Power, etc. Oh, and don't forget Children of the Light vs. Blood of the Fold.<br /><br />It is actually patent and obvious when you look at publication dates that Goodkind ripped off many concepts and terms from Jordan, nearly whole cloth.
B007BVOF8E|2.0|I rented this film because I wanted to see Gary Oldman do something different than we are used to seeing him do.. I thought he was brilliant as he always has been, but was quite confused as  what was going on.. I figured that it would all be sorted out.. That never happened for me, so I suffered thru it the next night thinking I would get it all sorted out, WRONG again.. I had not read the book, seen the miniseries, or known of the real event, apparently a prerequisite for viewing/understanding this film.. Sorry to have seen Gary in a nighmare film for me..

He soon discovers that his relatives do not have perfect lives either and begins to try and change the fortunes of the Collins family. I have to put a disclaimer on this review by saying that I am not a Johnny Depp fan and am really getting sick of him playing the same role over and over. Having said that this movie is deceiving. The preview made it seem like it was a comedy, while there are funny parts this is not really a straight comedy. I never saw the TV show so I wasn't sure what to expect but to me the movie had the feel of less funny \\"Death Becomes Her\\" as far as comedy goes. To me the best parts were the old maid who doesn't speak at all and the soundtrack (as well as Alice Cooper). There were some pretty funny lines and Depp did do a good job but this is his typical character lately so I can't really be impressed by his acting. I will admit though that if you are a Johnny Depp fan then you will probably really enjoy this movie and totally disagree with my review. As far as my feelings I thought it was a little slow moving and seemed confused as to whether it wanted to be funny or not. Overall, fans of Depp will probably love this, I thought it was a little less then OK and a carbon copy of every other Depp/Burton movie. I give it a B-.

B008NA3I30|3.0|\\"On this date at 2 pm eastern standard time August 5, 2040 I'd like to kiss you. Until then I'm married but after 35 years of being faithful to my husband I think I'll have earned one kiss from you.\\" Margot (Williams) is happily married to Lou (Rogen). After meeting a man named Daniel on a trip she is surprised to learn how close he lives to her, and how quick she seemed to fall for him. She now has a choice to make, either stay in her happy marriage or take a leap and try the unknown. I have to start by saying that this is a very good but very depressing movie. Also even though Seth Rogen and Sarah Silverman are in this this is not a comedy. The movie will make you feel very different feelings from scene to scene (which is the mark of a good movie). I also have to say that 90% of movies like this are pretty formulaic but this is the exception and it actually makes you wonder what will happen the whole time and the ending I have to say is perfect. Michelle Williams is great in this and I would compare this to the movie \\"Blue Valentine\\" in pacing and feel so if you liked that movie then this will be right up your ally too. Overall, a very good but pretty depressing movie that is very much worth seeing. I give it a B.
B001SGEUME|5.0|Well? What can be said 'bout Oasis. I love those guys! This is their first album, and one of the greatest one ever. I'm only twelve right now, but i hate that modern mainstream music you hear in the radio every day. Just not worth it. For me, the Gallagher bros. are my oasis of good great music in the modern times. Noel was the talent and creativity, Liam, the freaking rock n roll attitude! I hear their music every day, and these first years are their best. I simply love hearing (and I do it daily) Live Forever, Shakermaker and Cigarretes & Alcohol. Along with The Masterplan and (What's the Story) Morning Glory?, this is the very best of Oasis! It's good music the old way. It makes me wish I had been born in the '80s... Though, they have some pretty great stuff in the following years, specially Be Here Now and Don't Believe the Truth.<br />I discovered Oasis very recently, only after the Olympic Games closing ceremony. But since then, I've had the time of my life. They have helped me get over things, do things right and even helped me with a girl. I also ordered all of their albums by Amazon.<br />If you like real music and not that new electro-nonsense mainstream, this is definitely a must-have!
B002QE3CTY|2.0|A young boy wakes up in a mysterious prison community surrounded by miles of mazes patrolled by monsters. The memories of all the prisoners, prior to their imprisonment, were erased. The new boy's arrival, followed by the appearance of the prison's first girl, begins a series of changes to the routines the rest of the inmates have been following for two years.<br /><br />I was disappointed by this. First off, the third-person narration creates a detachment between the reader and the protagonist. I never felt the characters' urgency to escape their world. They're given food and supplies and clothing, and the weather is always perfect, and it doesn't seem like the monsters will bother them if they stay out of the mazes. The monsters themselves don't sound that scary. They move only a few feet at a time and can be heard from a mile away, taking hours to reach their prey. They seem easy to outrun, so there's no real suspense. The author simply tells us they're \\"horrible,\\" but doesn't describe anything to be afraid of. In the same way, the author constantly tells us the main character is \\"shocked\\" and \\"surprised\\" by the predictable but supposedly unexpected and random turns of events. But not a lot happens, and the entire plot is driven by the deus ex machina principle. It felt like everything was stretched out to avoid giving any explanation, as if that was supposed to make me that much more curious for answers, but instead it made me feel like everything was controlled solely by the whims of the writer. In short, I was bored. And in the end, there were still no answers to all the non-burning questions. Just a setup for a sequel.

The novel followed the (American) movie closely, with one notable exception, which did not detract from either.

Be cautioned though: you had better have the third book in the series handy (The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest) because when you read the last sentence, you'll want to continue reading!

Probably, with hope that it might be more similar to the book because I think they have the ability to be so ;)

B008MG1E4A|3.0|Although not a well organized nor well crafted, No Easy Day does provide some insight into the loyalty and respect that epitomizes members of the the US Seals.  There is obviously a courage and professionalism manifested by the total confidence in each other and the mission.  Somewhat disconcerting is the emotional distance that seems necessary in order to do whatever is necessary and the confidence that when given a job to have 100% belief that the intelligence and the decision makers have chosen wisely. It is hard to understand the apparent concern that the government has to operational secrets that they believe have been disclosed by the author.  As for the motivation of the author, I firmly believe that he wants to honor the dedicated men with whom he has served.
1840225564|5.0|Mark Twain was not an admirer of Jane Austen's work as he once declared:  \\"I often want to criticize Jane Austen, but her books madden me so that I can't conceal my frenzy from the reader; and therefore I have to stop every time I begin. Every time I read \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" I want to dig her up and beat her over the skull with her own shin-bone.\\"<br /><br />My first introduction to Austen's famous romances was \\"Pride and Prejudice\\".  Like Mark Twain, her writing style grated on my nerves so much I could not finish the book.  While I believe in respecting the rest of the departed, I too was ready to get a shovel, disturb the author's grave and brutally pummel into dust what Mark Twain may have missed.  Disappointed, I abandoned \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" and eventually made a second attempt years later.  By that time, I had hoped the chronological lapse would alter my prejudice against her style, forgive the pun, but it still had the same effect on my nerves, but at least I finished the book.<br /><br />Lo and behold, by some miraculous intervention I was persuaded to try again to see if I could appreciate her work, and this time not just with one novel, but to plough through all her famous books.  If you cannot judge a book by its cover, surely we should not judge an author by one book alone?  Especially Austen, someone who has withstood the test of time and has entered the history books as one of England's most famous authors.  Would it be possible to overcome my prejudice that had become as unrelenting as Miss Elizabeth Bennet's towards the mysterious Mr. Darcy?<br /><br />To be honest, it was a struggle at first.  I found myself flipping through the novels and wondering when would I get to the end.  \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" still stuck in this category for me, \\"Sense and Sensibility\\" was also difficult, but after these two, I realized it was just the writing I disliked, get over it!  Once I could turn a blind critical eye to her style and concentrate on the stories, the true talent of Austen began to shine through: her unique ability to portray the various characters of the landed gentry of the early 1800s in Regency Britannia, the plotting and scheming for social or monetary advancement, the love triangles, and how true love can over come all adversities even though life will always remain imperfect.  Austen was gifted with a keen observation of human nature and possessed a refined sense of the satirical, a master at setting off events with the crash and collision of weak versus strong characters and how all things will settle themselves for better or worse depending on the choices each person makes.<br /><br />\\"Sense and Sensibility\\" ~ After a death in the family, the once wealthy Dashwoods are reduced in their monetary means and are compelled by their change in circumstances to move to a humble cottage on the estate of a distant relative.  Can the Dashwood sisters weather the trials of meagre living and find true love among the eligible men from the higher echelons of society now that they must suffer their reduced circumstances?<br /><br />\\"Pride and Prejudice\\" ~  Ah yes, the handsome Mr. Darcy, but out of misplaced pride he snubs Elizabeth Bennet on their introduction.  Consequently she perceives him to be cold and aloof, sparking her prejudice against him despite his fortune and good looks.  Will ever the twain meet?<br /><br />\\"Mansfield Park\\"~ Fanny Price, a girl from a poor family, is taken in as a ward by her wealthy uncle at Mansfield Park.  Fanny is treated as a second class member of the household due to her charity status, but she valiantly suffers through the continual belittlement she suffers.  However, an offer of marriage is made to her by someone she detests and the offer is forced upon her by her uncle as a fit match, her ward duly reminding her in so many words of her previous circumstances.  As a charity case she could not expect to find anyone better.  If she had not been raised in the elegant, refined setting of Mansfield, she would not find anyone in the social circles that mattered, and therefore should take what is on offer.  Why, she should be grateful to accept someone who, knowing her former status, has condescended to take an interest in her, and whom he deems to be a fit spouse for her!  Will shy, quiet Fanny have the courage to stand up for herself despite appearing ungrateful to her uncle?<br /><br />\\"Emma\\" ~ The delightful tale of a girl who thinks she knows everyone's heart and is ignorant of her own takes it upon herself to play matchmaker for her acquaintances to the amused chagrin of Mr. Knightly, a family friend.  Poor Emma is in for a surprise when her games of love go awry.  Will it all end as happily as she envisioned?<br /><br />\\"Northanger Abbey\\" ~ Catherine, the daughter of a clergyman, is invited by a family friend to visit the famous spa town of Bath with them.  While there she meets a dashing young gentleman who soon catches her eye and her heart, however, another bachelor attempts to monopolize her time and keep her away from the attentions of anyone else.  Can Catherine ditch the self-centred control freak and be allowed to pursue the man who mystifies her?<br /><br />\\"Persuasion\\" ~ Ah, young love!  Anne has fallen in love with a captain in the navy, but is persuaded against the match by her aristocratic connections, reasons that all seemed good at the time.  Years later, the lovers cross paths and Anne discovers her love is still very much alive.  Can there be any hope when in earlier years there was much opposition to their match? More importantly, does he still feel the same way about her after she had rejected his offer?<br /><br />\\"Lady Susan\\" ~ an epistolary novel told through letters.  Lady Susan is a devil-may-care socialite who has squandered her fortune makes life a misery for her family and friends.  She continues to do so, scheming and plotting for her own ends and welfare.  She is manipulative and cunning, and is especially cruel to her daughter Frederica because she is too much like her father and his family, whom she despises.  Will Frederica find her true love, or be steered into marriage with a man she has no respect for?<br /><br />My personal favourites are \\"Northanger Abbey\\", \\"Lady Susan\\", and \\"Emma\\".<br />\\"Northanger\\" is filled with colourful descriptions of the social life at Bath, and Austen's satire on the public's fascination with gothic novels was quite amusing indeed, a fun blend of gothic mystery with a humorous, bracing wake-up call to reality displaying the ambitious, greed-filled folly of human nature.  \\"Lady Susan\\" and the depraved depths that vixen will go to deceive all around her for her own ends was a fascinating character study, so was \\"Emma\\" with her playful scheming to arrange the love lives of those closest to her, a capricious innocent tale in comparison with \\"Lady Susan\\"!  One theme I find interesting in Austen's writings is the `semi-outcast' family member who is treated harshly but manages to find happiness such as Anne in \\"Persuasion\\" and Fanny Price in \\"Mansfield Park\\".  A second theme is `toxic relationships' as seen with overbearing parents or guardians, for instance, Fanny's uncle in \\"Mansfield Park\\", \\"Lady Susan\\", and General Tilney in \\"Northanger Abbey\\".  Obviously, Austen seemed to be fascinated with these topics and explored them in different settings.<br /><br />The final verdict:  At long last, I can finally appreciate most of Austen's work, hurray!  I am giving it the full five stars because her development of characters and social situations makes for fascinating reading when you get right down to it.  I still have not quite warmed up to \\"Pride and Prejudice\\", but who knows?  I promise to give it another chance, I may become the admiring convert, prejudice finally exchanged for undying appreciation.<br /><br />About the book itself, the edition I am referring to is printed by Wordsworth Library Collection, Wordsworth Editions Limited, (2007). ISBN 978-1-84022-556-3.  This version is missing the novel \\"Sanditon\\", probably due to the fact Austen never finished it.  I also heard that \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is missing a line in this edition, but as I am not an Austen expert, I do not know if this is true or not.  For those of you who like footnotes, this book does not have them, so if you are looking for detailed historical explanations as you read, you will have to invest in another edition.  I always find the Oxford World Classics editions very informative if you are inclined to learn more about the historical background of a book.  As for the hardback quality, this particular edition is covered in cloth with gold etching for the title, and features a sticker with on the front for the image, not a embossed image printed directly into the cover.  The pages are actually thin, the paper more suited for a pocketbook paperback, but if treated well, the book should not fall apart.  It does present a pleasing presentation, and looks delightful on a collector's shelf.  However, if you tend to be rough on books, you might want a more sturdy edition.<br /><br />E.A.

074322454X|1.0|This book reads like a rough outline of a book that has yet to be edited.  There are enough typos in the book to drive anyone who can read crazy.  The paragraph structure and the transitions from one to the next are done by \\"...\\" instead of using words.  This is incredibly frustrating.  Quotations are done poorly so that I often have to go back to the beginning of the paragraph to determine who it was that said something.<br /><br />The research is very poor, relying almost entirely on interviews of soldiers that were done decades after the war ended.  These tend to be biased accounts of how things happened and leave out a lot of the crucial details.  Character portrayals are very biased and the portrayals of individual battles often leave out anything but subjective thoughts and feelings of soldiers.<br /><br />If you're at all interested in *What Actually Happened* this is not a very good choice for reading.  There are many other books that offer a much more complete version.  If it's the actual personal experience you're interested in reading there are MANY more of those available that are much higher quality than this - often written by soldiers themselves instead of an author who interprets information he didn't experience.<br /><br />The Miniseries that this is based upon is great, in my opinion it tells the story better than the book, which is saying something.<br /><br />Don't waste your time with this book, look for something by a historian who will give you a well researched version of what actually happened.

0525952926|3.0|I love Ken Follet´s books and I loved Fall of Giants, maybe even more than Pillars of the Earth. I read the whole book in two days and it was not bad however I think there are simply too many stories which then reduces the quality of the historical fiction and your attachment to the characters. The problem is simple, Fall of Giants has 4 sibling pairs (or cousins in the case of Walter and Robert but they are kind of secondary characters) plus Gus Dewar, from those only two marry between the group (or kind of) Walter and Maud and Ethel and Fitz, and then they all have two children at least, this means that in this book there are 4 Americans, 2 Russians, 2 Germans and about 6 Brits that are named as the children, waaaay too many characters for you to like all of them. Thus many of the older generation are completely put aside (Fitz only has one talking part, Billy is a completely flat character who talks about two times in the book and Robert disappears somewhere in the middle of the story never to be talked about again although he seems to be alive and well). Likewise with so many younger characters some of their motivations are not very well understood, you never really understand why Boy wants to marry Daisy (he has no money problems and she seems too cheap and not aristocratic enough for him) and  why his dad never opposes him. On the same lines the secondary Jewish characters in the story make no sense (why would they send their daughter abroad instead of their son). Also so many characters take away some of the importance of the history behind it, D day really doesn´t seem very important, the whole A-bomb deal is talked about but they do not talk much about the dropping of it but yet they spend waaaay too much time talking about the Spanish Civil War. I gave it three stars because even with all of this I did wanted to know what happens to each of them and I hope the next book will answer my questions and I did manage to read 1000 pages in 2 days, so it is ok written, I just wished it had focused a bit more in the characters we have learned to love and focus on fewer stories and in more historical detail.

B009CPE424|5.0|This charming film is delightful from the first bark to the last peanut butter pit!  If you haven't seen the film and don't know what I'm talking about, let's just say that dogs and peanut butter is a more unbeatable combination than peanut butter and chocolate.  George Lopez and the rest of the voice actors give real heart and soul to all the darling dogs, even the ones with bit (or bite sized) parts. And of course, Papi rules!  This is Disney at its finest:  whimsy, fun, beautiful production value and great animated magic that takes you to a happy, light-hearted place which is sometimes just what the doctor ordered during these  stressful, difficult times.  I felt like I was on  a wonderful fantasy vacation with my lovely dog friends at the very posh Langham Pasadena.  Not only five star accommodations, but a five star film all the way! The talking animal effects are the most effective to date and helped pull me into their idyllic, happy world.  Felt as rested as if I went on a spa date.  Have fun and keep that silly grin on your face! It's Disney baby. Oh, and don't rent this one. Buy it!  It will keep the kids quiet and happy for hours as they rewatch all  the cute talking puppies, and you'll want to visit again with the  Shakespearean chorus of mariachi chihuahuas. Yep, you heard that right!

0385344333|1.0|I used to love the Jack Reacher series, and could not wait for the next one to come out.  However, I have been disappointed with the last several books, and wonder if Child can keep up the schedule of one to two books published a year.  Based on the quality of this one, he can't.  I ended up skimming most of the last 2/3, for all of the reasons mentioned by other reviewers; boring, repetitive, etc.  I would like to count in one of these books how many times the phrase \\"Reacher did not respond\\" or \\"x character did not respond\\" is used.  I am glad I borrowed this book from a friend and did not waste my own money.  And to also echo the other comments....Tom Cruise?  Really?  How many times in this book is Reacher's imposing size mentioned?  And this was written AFTER Cruise was cast, supposedly with Child's endorsement?  You'd think he would at least have backed off on that description just a bit!

B0045TYDNC|5.0|As camera owners, we all go crazy at times, finding ways to protect the front element of our lenses by purchasing filters, lens cleaners, lens hoods and such. Yet what is forgotten so often is that it's the crucial rear lens element that the light passes through just before it reaches the sensors on our cameras.<br /><br />If you own a Nikon DSLR, regardless of which model it is, then the [[ASIN:B0045TYDNC Nikon LF-4 Rear Lens Cap]] should be considered as an essential for good lens storage and protection. These are made from hard plastic, and they will protect that critical rear element on your Nikkor lens from smudges, scratches and dust. This is the right rear lens cap for all Nikkor lenses for DSLRs and will fit almost every Nikon F-mount lens ever made, and that also includes teleconverters.<br /><br />The first time that I attended the old traveling Nikon School in the '70s, one of the instructors was the late Sterling Clark, who was not only teaching the course, but was an avid Nikon 35 mm shooter with a background in sports photojournalism. He carefully explained why it was essential to protect the rear element more than the front by showing 35mm slides (back in the day), showing first slides with a big thumbprint on the front of the lens and the same on the rear. Next came identical images shot with Kodachrome, with the results. It was clear to all that the often overlooked rear element was the one that needed to be protected the most.<br /><br />So what's the difference between Nikon's [[ASIN:B00005NPWJ LF-1 Rear Lens Cap]] and the new [[ASIN:B0045TYDNC LF-4 Rear Lens Cap]]? Not much, according to Nikon. The LF-4 is a newer version with a slightly different and easier to grip design. Call it product evolution.<br /><br />The [[ASIN:B0045TYDNC Nikon LF-4 Rear Lens Cap]] costs less than a low-end filter, so the investment to protect the back element from debris is quite reasonable. In this age of where 'new and improved' products often cost more then their predecessors, it's good to see that this new  LF-4 Rear Lens Cap actually costs less than the one that it has replaced.<br /><br />9/20/2012redecessors, it's good to see that this new  LF-4 Rear Lens Cap actually costs less than the one that it has replaced.<br /><br />9/20/2012

B005EGXTEE|4.0|Yes, this book is near identical to the Battle Royale series and yes, there are a plethora of elements throughout that reek of unoriginality but, let's face it, it's very hard to find any genuinely new ideas these days and, despite being stale, The Hunger Games does provide you with all the must-have elements that guarantee a good read. It's got romance, action, courage, strength against injustice, love triangles, fashion; everything a girl needs to keep her entertained. My nine-year old brother and I thoroughly enjoyed every moment of this book and look forward to what's to come in the next of the series.<br /><br />Not the best book I've ever read but certainly not the worst.<br /><br />A small note though: lay of the \\"I say\\" \\"He says\\" \\"She say\\", in most cases they're utterly unnecessary and they're used entirely too much.
B00000JZIK|4.0|This was a very interesting story right from the word go. I had to leave part way through and found myself already thinking about where it was going and couldn't wait to get back to it. I haven't had this much anticipation about a movie in a while.<br />  I suppose it must be hard to make a crime show without violence, coarse language or gore but by and large this one did rest on it's storytelling merrits without overdoing it in these areas. But you wouldn't show this to a younger audience. But for this reason alone I had to give it a 4 star. I think a good crime yarn can have these negative aspects absent. Still like I say it was pretty tame in this department and stood very well on the story alone, and when there was this aspect it fit and wasn't gratuitous.. Frankly this aspect was virtualy a non factor, exept in the intrinsic nature of crime itself.<br />  That said I found this a gripping yarn that was intreaguing and interesting the entire show. I can't wait to watch it again, but don't want to watch it too soon as the way it unfolded was just easy enough to follow, but quick enough to keep you one your toes trying to keep up...and wonder if your were following it as good as you needed to. I can't wait to watch it again knowing what is revealed at the end.<br />  I suspect upon closer examimnation it's feasability might fall apart. Could the villain really be who he was, or does the story break apart upon closer examination as all too often does in this kind of intricate yarn.  But the ending and the \\"opening of the eyes\\" was pretty kool. I consider this a keeper and will watch it again sometime.

0385344333|4.0|Was the action compressed at the end?  Yes, mostly it was.  But the characters were great throughout.  The plot and outcome of the mystery really worked and was much less implausible than in many books, including a couple of the other Reacher books.  Just as in One Shot and Bad Luck and Trouble, I loved how Reacher thought strategically about everything and worked stuff out.  I really liked that in this book the author talked a bit more about Reacher really liking numbers and facts (and maybe having a bit of an eidetic memory - although that is just my interpretation).  I liked the characters, although the bad guys were not at all developed, the good guys were great.  There was a bit of implausible coincidence, but nothing not well within the realm of fiction.  I have the kindle edition and thought it better edited than many things on kindle.  I was worried when I read the reviews, but I thoroughly enjoyed this addition to the series and look forward to the next

B005721W9O|5.0|The DVD was new and the viewing quality was excellent. My family really enjoyed watching Galaxy Quest together. My fiance is taking it to his parents house to watch watch it with his dad.
B008XG1X18|4.0|like to use this for ideas for crafts and recipes. use it on kindle fire and it does lock up now and then but not enough to make me stop using it.
1892005034|5.0|My sister recommended this book very highly. I read it and worked hard at applying the principles. At minimum this book makes one aware of the nuances of what is going on between speaker and listener. It breaks down the essence of communication and how to better convey that which one wishes to convey. So many conversations are just a frustrating catch 22 where no communication really takes place. If one wishes to move beyond that, this book will help one do that.
B001YYQ9SS|5.0|Having this movie on bluray was one of the best purchases I've made in a white - great price, fast shipment - very satisfied.
0425263908|5.0|I was scared to read this book. I read 50 shades of grey and did not like it at all. This book is so much better than 50 shades of Grey by a lot. I cant read the second book.
B000M5B6Q0|5.0|There is some pretty funny songs on here.  This is my dads favorite movie so I had to get him the soundtrack.  He loves it!  I definitely recommend this!
B0058PJ6NE|1.0|If you get this app don't delete any thing at once or it will not let you watch videos.Also I can't watch(a lot)many videos that I want to watch.It said:error check connection and I have a three or four bar(four is full)and still can't play it.So I hope that this changes your mind and don't waste your money.
B004SYP5WC|4.0|I 've had this app for a couple of months now. It's very handy to have. I really like the reminders. You can edit any bills you have and which ever bills you receive on a monthly basis, you have a &quot;repeats &quot; button. That will allow those bills to automatically show up on your bill finder.
B0019N8P2W|5.0|I was so excited to see this DVD series for sale. I just wish that they would have made more seasons or even new seasons in 2012! I dearly miss this show because the quality of the stories were so believable and helped people realize certain things like dad can cook, mom can work crazy hours, and ultimately, women can be intelligent and strong. We need more programming like this--especially nowadays. You don't see many strong female roles on Mtv anymore in any of their shows. It is such a shame. It almost seems as though someone took over the television station and destroyed everything it had going for it in the early 1990s to later 1990s :(<br /><br />Another bonus to the DVD collection is that there are \\"Daria Day intros\\" to some of the episodes which is totally hilarious!
0062073567|5.0|I read this years ago at the recommendation of a friend who's something of a mystery fiction buff, and reread it with my family on our vacation this year. Without giving anything away, this is easily one of the most carefully and cleverly plotted books I've ever read. Highly recommended, even for people who aren't big mystery readers.

B000035P5E|5.0|\\"The war has come down to me and you\\", said the Normandy-invasion-knowing German spy to the English woman while she and her child were completely at his mercy. This entire movie has numerous points of suspense, when the protagonist and antagonist seem to be beaten, but are not. The resolve and desperation of both sides comes across clearly. There is a great deal of action.<br /><br />My wife has read the book and seen the movie. She thinks that the book is better than the movie.
B0090EHVMC|4.0|This movie is a fun movie to watch. Great animation and good songs. I enjoyed the story. This is the reason I bought it because it was so much fun
030758836X|5.0|It really is worth the reading, its gripping and funny and dark and keeps u guessing! I really recommend this to anyone, I am not a big thriller/crime reader but I loved every minute and have now passed it on to my DH so we can discuss. Not to be missed.
B00071QOGQ|5.0|I had this book in the late 1970's and wanted very much to see it again as some of the drawings of the hound were truly frightening and memorable.  Amazon provided the best way to not only locate it but purchase it as well!  A great little book to introduce new readers to Arthur Conan Doyle's intrepid protagonist.

B006LSZECO|4.0|I do love books with crazy twists, so this one I quite enjoyed.  I know it's a good book when as I'm reading it I make gasps, and \\"oh my gosh\\" comments as I'm reading it.  Definitely worth while.
B005LAJ212|5.0|Sadly this show hasn't yet arrived on the german speaking part but I have curious about and I have to say: the Cast is outstanding (incl. Emily Van Camp and Madeline Stowe) but personally dislike a bit Connor Paolo. but it doesn't matter - the show is thrilling, set on the Hamptons: rich people have secrets.<br /><br />Right on the beginning we see a murder on the Beach while a big engagement party of the rich family Grayson is on. Emily is the future bride.<br />Then 5 months earlier: A young misterious woman Emily/Amanda comes back to the place of her childhood and want have only one thing: \\"revenge\\" - of something which happened many years ago between her family and the Graysons.<br /><br />Guests: Matthew Glave, Michael Reilly Burke, William Devane and Supporting: Ashton Holmes as Tyler Barrol<br /><br />The DVD (sadly, there is no blu-Ray release) comes in a very good picture and sound quality.<br /><br />Soundtrack is available in english and contains several (inkl. English SDH) subtitles (French, Spanish).<br /><br />The bonus features: several interesting documentaries where looks behind the camera (Studio Tour, Fashion of Revenge, Bloopers, deleted scenes)<br /><br />It's: entertaining, evil, bad (in positiv sense), sarcastic, drama, glamour, thrilling.<br /><br />FAZIT: when you like SOAPs a la \\"Dynasty\\" / \\"Dallas\\" then you could like \\"REVENGE\\" too. Don't miss it!!!
B00846REIS|5.0|loving this book so far! havent finished reading it but it is better written than \\"50 Shades of Grey\\". (not that im complaining! i loved those too!)
B0073XV2W2|1.0|I ADORED Daniel's first two books. They are in my top 25 books of all time without a doubt. I was hoping for a lot from this book and it was a sad an utter disappointment. Not only was the tech in the book old hat but it had terrible character development, fragmented plot lines and was really poorly written. I was riveted by his first two books but couldn't wait to finish this one. This one felt like an unreleased first novel that they edited to get out to capitalize on the success of the previous two. I'm sorry but skip it. If you want drone tech just go watch some youtube.
B003H9MSPG|2.0|The charging handle end broke off a couple weeks ago.  The last return date for this item was September 1st.  No one in the entire world including Nerf makes replacement charging handle ends.  Most of the utility of the toy is now gone.  These things should all come with at least one spare charging handle end.
B00846REIS|4.0|Eventhough there was a huge similarity between this book and fifty shades, I still loved the book and I am really waiting on the next one to print. Awesome book and I am so excited to read the remainder.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|great game. fun and addictive. lots of different games and reward points are high. never gets boring. cant stop playing.
B001C4AFOY|5.0|This movie is the story of a couple at a time, with Royalty, couples were chosen for each other, they really had no say in their future. But Victoria was a hard headed woman and she loved her man, and NO ONE was going to keep him from her!<br /><br />The actors fit the character perfectly. The different cultures joining made it such a good love story for the times.<br /><br />The beautiful scenery made the movie even more enjoyable and made you feel like you were there.<br /><br />I love the historical parts of this movie.<br /><br />It is a little bit of a girl flick.
1426308469|5.0|This book is wonderful! I bought this for my niece for her upcoming 4th birthday. My 2 1/2 year old son currently has this book and every time she comes over to our house she is amazed with this book. It has great pictures and the best part it the pronunciation guide for parents! I hate trying to pronounce the names of dinosaurs and my son always wants to know the names. This book tells how big each was compared to humans and little facts about each dinosaur. Great beginning dinosaur book for kids.
B0000VCZK2|5.0|I have been a fan of the ALIEN epic, for 30 years. Owning the Quadrilogy gives me the opportunity to feed my ALIEN fix when ever I need it. The quality of the video and the audio is gr8; coupled with the fact that the theatrical release and directors cuts are included make the unbelievable price a steal. Can't wait for Prometheus!
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I am glad I took my older brother's advice and picked up this book! It is definitely worth a read and I can't wait to get into the rest of the trilogy.
B005HSL626|3.0|personally I love the game and would give it five stars if ads didn't pop up when I was in the middle of a game. after the game wouldn't be so bad but not during thee game. overall though the game is fun and addicting if there werentnso many ads to mess me up.
B008MEM24S|5.0|loved it. so did my son. bought it for him but I played it more often. worth the dollar charge any day of the week
B0096DFBZQ|1.0|I really wanted to like this game but the controls are just terrible. whether you use the touch controls or the tilt controls it is basically unplayable. the graphics are nice and I like the Mario cart feel but I have already uninstalled it after just a few games. Fix the controls and you may have a hit. until that happens I recommend passing on this one.
B001XCWPAM|5.0|They movies were great and in good condition the high definition is truely remarakable  doby 5.1 just makes the experience just that more great big fan of the series thankfully I was able to get my hands on it was worth the money.

B001AQO3QA|5.0|I have always loved the Alien movies. Alien and Aliens are definitely my favorites and this Blu Ray collection of all four films looks and sounds great! There are plenty of special features as well.
B00515M23M|5.0|Since my adolescence I simply adored the poems and tales written by Edgar Allen Poe, as I loved H.P. Lovecraft, too.<br />The horror, often so subtle in some stories he wrote, in others plain in sight - it gives me the goosebumps right now!<br />To buy this complete collection was one of the first things I had to do for my Kindle. As I bought the Complete Lovecraft and the Complete Sherlock Holmes, too!<br /><br />The content of the e-book is listed above.<br />This edition includes all the Poe's Works of Poetry & Fiction that are included in the Poe Canon:<br />- Poems (Alone, The Raven, etc.)<br />- Tales (The Fall of The House of Usher, etc.)<br /><br />You can move quickly back and forth among Poems and Tales by simply clicking a link in the Table of Contents.<br /><br />An unbeatable collection for an unbeatable price.<br />Everything a real fan needs!

B000SEGUDE|3.0|disjoined, unclearly connected set of chapters,  not a smooth flow from one century to the next and a very poor ending... very much a missed opportunity of a good idea...
B0058EBNAO|4.0|It tells me the current weather and it also tells me about earthquakes that happened in the World..plus it tells me the sun rise and sunset of the sun.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I started the first book and it took a few times to get into it, but in the end, I purchased book 2 before heading on vacation and am SOOO glad I did. I ended up getting the \\"feel\\" for the story line and quickly read book 2. I bought book 3 when I returned from vacation and read it quickly, yet savoring the book so not reading too much at once.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Awesome... If you are one of the people contemplating whether or not to buy it, and the price is to much for you... well... It's not. This is almost az good as the PC version, which is 28$. This is an EPIC app. I haven't came across and monsters yet, and I am having a really hard time figuring out how to work the crafting table...<br />Help?
B009AJD5E0|5.0|I'd have to sum up Prometheus like this:  Five stars for art direction, one star for the script.  It was fantastic to look at. However, all the character archetypes are still there. It's esscially the original Alien with a few changes.  That being, how they originated.  While I wanted to like this film; Ridley should have stepped in and made changes to the script.<br /><br />This prequel is to be part of a trilogy, according to Scott.  Where is he going to go from here?  I'd make Prometheus a dream if I were a director.  Without giving away major elements of the story, for those who haven't seen this movie, all the mystery is gone.  We are left with a very simplistic answer to all the questions that have been part of the franchise.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|The book was a great read and easily it captures your attention from the start. I would recommend this book to anyone interested in SEAL training.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|I finished \\"A Wanted Man\\" in three days.  It would have been faster if I didn't need to work and sleep.  I simply couldn't stop turning the pages.  Long-time fans will find that the story fit well within the parameters of the classic Reacher formula.  Some may feel that the formula is getting stale.  I, however, believe that the formula still has a great deal of appeal.  The current story picks up where \\"Worth Dying For\\" left off.  Reacher again finds himself in an almost random place and time, where thru serendipity he is faced with a situation that he cannot walk away from.  When faced with a wrong that needs to be righted, Reacher moves forward with tenacity, ruthlessness and unparalleled survival instincts.  Reacher is a bit more cerebral and a little less physical than in prior entries in the series, but it worked well within the storyline.  Bottom line:  This book was classic Reacher, filled with the twists and turns that made it impossible to put down.
B0099G4Y26|4.0|Fun, Fast and Flirtatious.  This album like many great albums is more than the sum of each song.  Keep rocking it Pink.

B008JGSM6G|5.0|One of those games that are so simply made but so much fun. There are hundreds of levels to play and anyone can play it. Definite improvement from many other mindless apps on the market today.
B007TNS6JI|5.0|ok its a good game just wish the upgrade button would work better then it dose cause it dose not work good at all
B000NQRE9Q|2.0|I expected much more from such a highly anticipated launch of a frame by frame restoration as advertised. The sound is intermitant, and many screens still have exagerarrated graininess common of low def 70's and 80's flix. Might as well just have a DVD copy, rather than having waited for this. Shame on me; this is the second time I have been burned by Lucas-Spielberg. My respect for these guys is gone.

B008I3QZKU|4.0|Where are The Killers, mentally?<br /><br />In short, if they ever found themselves in the same bar, the kind of guy who likes Battle Born would probably beat up the kind of guy who likes \\"Andy, You're a Star\\" from Hot Fuss.  Better listeners than I have given brilliant analysis of the album, track by track. I can only do what I think I can do and that is take the psychological pulse of The Killers by looking at Battle Born in context of the rest of their work.<br /><br />Battle Born is not an entirely new sound.  It has its roots in Sam's Town, but it does not sound like The Killers who so deftly skated the razor's edge of 80's Brit Pop and 21st century indie to inspire a new genre.  Their sound was so appealing that they spawned new bands, but then left that genre alone with Sam's Town and those other bands, left leaderless, found themselves in an undefined muddle.<br /><br />But this isn't about other bands, it's about The Killers and wondering where is the band that created Hot Fuss and the gems of Sawdust?  They're just not there in Battle Born.  The album seems born out of backlash and pressure: the pressure to get back into the game of the music industry; the pressure to prove their pride in Las Vegas and America when the rest of the world ridiculed and loved them for being anglophiles; and, dare I say it, the social pressure on Brandon Flower to pull back from suggestive lyrics to prove his manhood and his faith.  I write this as someone with great admiration and empathy for Flowers' ability to keep his faith and have the courage to stand up to rabid, shallow, unjust attacks from journalists, TV hosts and others in the music industry.  Oddly enough these people derive some angry pleasure in  picking on an individual who does not fit into the rock star stereotype and try to pressure Flowers into that template.  The problem is that all this pressure from all sides is affecting the band's direction, their style, their music, their relationships, and ultimatelytheir art.<br /><br />The value of The Killers and any great band is that once they are together they are more than the sum of their parts.  People came to The Killers because of their new sound.  Millions  more came for Flowers' charisma and contradictions.  Millions stayed because of the technical brilliance of Dave Keuning's guitar, Mark Stoermer's bass and Ronnie Vannucci's drums.  Keuning has the skill of a classical guitarist who could probably transpose a Bach fugue and the confidence to channel that talent into a biting riff.  Stoermer has the magical ability to turn the bass into a voice, then back again and seem to create a new instrument as a result.  Vannucci plays drums with intelligence, making a song the worthy subject for a lecture on percussion in a  Julliard classroom.  That's when they're together and at their best.<br /><br />Battle Born is an attempt to keep the band together, but they are not at their best.  The album seems born of the economic reality of recognizing that a hiatus is not going to pay the mortgage and keep a legacy alive.  Keuning and Stoermer seem to be going along for the ride without investing their talent in Battle Born.  It's as if they are reluctantly allowing Flowers to lead the way in a way they would not go.  They are not lending their creativity to the mix because they don't like the direction, but they need to get an album out. Vannucci is the backbone and trying to help Flowers carry the weight in Battle Born but even he can't pretend that he is invested in the direction and no matter how sincere he tries.  The drums don't feel the way they used to feel.<br /><br />When a band produces an album like Battle Born, after the trajectory of their other albums, it's not that they are trying a new direction.  I think they're trying to get back in the groove of being a band despite disagreements.  I see Battle Born as an honest attempt to keep the band together and that's why I'll give it 4 stars though it sounds closer to 3.5 start.  For me it's theme is backlash from outside pressure, the most angering has been the ridicule that they took by people who accused them of being affected American Brit-wannabes from Las Vegas and having a Mormon as a front-man.  Those critics couldn't admit how much they loved the band. They were overwhelmed with a musical crush, but often preferred to appear clever and indifferent by making personal attacks and desperately looking for flaws.<br /><br />After Battle Born I wish the band would return to the oxygen bubble in which they created the same kind of music from Hot Fuss and Sawdust.  The seeds are in Sawdust.  I'm guessing that they're going to get ripped apart by critics for Battle Born.  The reaction will probably be close to critical reaction to Sam's Town.  They're going to have to withstand it.  If they can ignore it to some degree perhaps their next album will be  a clear manifesto of that new sound that they proclaimed in the beginning that gave them deserved attention.  Those book-end songs, as dark as they are (Leave  the Bourbon on the Shelf, Jenny was a Friend of Mine), where one finishes up what they other started and not necessarily in that order are brilliant songs as short stories [Battle Born does have Miss Atomic Bomb which might be prequel to Mr. Brightside.]  Then there is that song \\"Show you How\\" from Sawdust that starts as a phone message from a love-lorn ex-boyfriend. These are the stuff of Killers genius on sides both technical and conceptual.<br /><br />What's going on in Battle Born is a backlash to pressure.  That's outside pressure, the tragedy of any band that gets big too quickly.  Flowers is attracting some nasty attention because of his religion and Battle Born sounds like a defense of it when it comes to the hymn inspired tunes.  Critics should steer clear of his religion and just let him be.  It's hard to be a front man and deal with media.  Keuning and Stoermer should start helping out their band-mate by taking some of the media weight off his shoulders. Vannucci is trying.  In the last few years it's  really apparent that Flowers is being left alone to the wolves and the kind of sensational media focus about sexuality and religion that take him away from talking and thinking about The Killers music and working on a combined vision of sound with Keuning, Stoermer and Vannucci.  This lack of focus and cohesion is apparent in Battle Born.  Flowers' Dustbowl and gospel inspred songs are getting little help from Keuning and Stoemer.  Perhaps Flowers needs to get out gospel hymns  on solo albums because on Battle Born it's clear that bandmates are just not invested in them and don't want to make them part of The Killers Sound.  Flowers might consider leaving his soul to his solo albums, letting his clever brain contribute to The Killers sound while directing his charismatic energy into both projects. Sometimes it's the stuff that happens outside the studio that is just as important as the stuff inside the studio. Flowers needs some help from his band mates in dealing with outside pressure in order to keep harmony inside the studio and develop The Killers sound that is going to make them a great band with a legacy.
B003O86FMW|4.0|This being the middle book of Suzanne's \\"The Hunger Games\\" trilogy, it was more of a bridge between the first and third books.<br />Still very enjoyable and I highly recommend the entire trilogy.

B005FQ2H8W|1.0|But then why would anyone in their right mind want to participate in such nonsense? IMO this film is ridiculous. But it starts with the writing,<br /><br />Ultimately, when there is any type of confusion evident in the movie, the story does not seem right, dialogue is amateurishly contructed, the storyline is either in part not good or - as in this film - a total mess, a hodgepodge of confusion - you can lay the blame on the writer(s). Nothing in this film makes any sense at all. There's nothing in reality anyone can relate to concerning it. It is total fantasy, & of exceeding poor quality at that. A total waste of time.

What I will say is this is an awesome book about what our country does for us that 99% of the time we never hear of. These men spend their lives training for the big day that they can do a job that insures our safety and freedom. They do not do this for recognition because we generally don't know who did what but that do it for the love of our country. You go Seal Six and we thank you for all your unspoken sacrifices.

B006LSZECO|4.0|Miss Flynn is an excellent writer.  Her words dance across the page.  A couple of early chapters I found a little tedious but then it really gets interesting and I found it hard to put down.  I would recommend it highly.  This is my first time reading a book on Kindle Fire and I like it very much but I miss not having page numbers.  I know you can see the percentage of what you have read but I like to know how many pages the next chapter has to determine if I want to continue reading for a little while longer.
1451696191|5.0|A great read.  I read this book in a day.<br />The ending was very powerful.<br />I would absolutely recommend it-  to anyone.
B005LAIHSQ|3.0|This movie is very original and has very good special effects but I believe that it kind of falls short.  The acting in it alright but not good.  Miss Theron did the best acting on this movie.  The ending of this movie was a let down also, I was expecting a big ending but it goes out with a whimper.  I feel overall that this movie is average compared to what is available out there.
B00008WT5M|5.0|I love this band and all their music. they add a little humor and fun to rock. GREAT  CD. and I will be a fan forever. This is MUSIC. Very few artist' today are that. Thats why I like the \\"oldies but goodies\\"!!!!

1933952806|4.0|The first time I opened this book, it solved one of the major problems that I was having with my new D7000.  Having upgraded from the D90, I was not familiar with the autofocus priority setting, and was getting quite frustrated with the camera repeatedly refusing to take a photo.  Understanding this simple setting has already let me capture photos that I would have missed otherwise.  I am still reading, and learning more with every page.  The D7000 is a marvelous camera, but it's complexity makes a book like this one a necessity.
0385344333|5.0|A WANTED MAN (Pub. Sept 2012) teased and taunted me for eight weeks. Waiting for the book's publication date was almost painful.  Amazon finally delivered and I locked the door behind me while the mailman drove off. It was worth the wait, as Lee's books and Jack Reacher always are.<br /><br />The reverse 'what if' related to the hitchhiker scenario that kicks the story off is irresistable--it forces you to keep reading.  I also really like the way Lee brings two women in as main-supporting characters, popping surprises along the way, never another strong male in the picture, and yet, it's not Reacher that helps these women survive the onslaught of the story. They stand on their own and help him out. You just gotta love it.<br /><br />What I like best about this, Lee's 17th masterpiece, are several unexpected plot twists - I anticipated one or two, but the rest caught me by surprise. The scoop of mystery/clues the author sometimes clued the clueless into were the whipped cream of the novel, the bernaise sauce on this great read. Loved the fact Lee played some of that stuff out early.  Okay, I admit I did not catch the 'driving for three hours' bit until he clued me in - next time Lee, I promise to pay more attention.<br /><br />It seemed there were a few spots with a small difference in the style we expect from Lee's Reacher novels, very subtle, but there. Taking a bit more time with details, seemingly unnecessary, but in the end, Master Lee uses these to ratchet up the tension in such a subtle way the reader doesn't notice.  There are metaphors and clues hidden in there so don't rush through those few passages of trickily stacked details serving dual purposes.<br /><br />After I read the last page of this excellent story, I had only one question.  Who do I have to bribe to get on Lee's early readers galley list?

B000FBFN1U|5.0|This series has everything you could possibly want.  There is love, betrayal, sword fights, mysteries, magic, and all with a historical feel.  This book encourages you to question good and evil in a mystical way as well as in a human way.  Love it!

B007UPNA6Y|5.0|The novel opens directly after the end of the last Jack Reacher novel, on the main highway where he has been dropped off to catch a ride.  He has the first broken nose he has ever had strapped with duct tape, is disheveled, tired and cold, and trying to hitchhike his way to a city in middle America where he can get a bus to Virginia.<br /><br />As usual, Reacher is heroic and inventive, thoughtful and quick witted. The story is filled with twists and turns, and despite one sequence where Reacher manages to read eye winks accurately, its action-filled events are compelling, if just barely plausible.  The story is a page turner and highly entertaining.<br /><br />Lee Child is up to his usual standard of action story-telling.  A very good read!

B003YL4LYI|2.0|If this epic is going to stand the test of time, books 4 and 5 should be significantly abridged. They were almost unnecessary, and one begins to wonder if GRRM put this out there soley to take advantage of the attention brought on by the HBO TV series. In my personal opinion, books 4 and 5 should be abridged to a lengthy epilogue of book 3. If 20 dollars means much to you, don't buy this book. I almost feel like I would have enjoyed the series more if I pretended that it stopped at book 3. Back to Dumas to wash this nasty taste out of my mouth.
B005FISBV2|3.0|I have to wonder if my overall enjoyment of the latest season of Dexter was dampened thanks to spoilers that were made available online before this season even made its dvd/Blu-ray debut.  I won't spill the beans on the plot twists that lie in wait for viewers (if there are any out there who don't know what happens at this point), but I suspect that even if they were kept under wraps, it still wouldn't have been enough to keep season six from being the weakest batch of espisodes yet.<br /><br />Relligion is a major theme as the city of Miami is terrorized by a duo of murderers known as The Doomsday Killers (Edward James Olmos, Colin Hanks) due to their religious zealotry and biblical themed killings.  Olmos and Hanks play teacher and pupil working together to stage murders that serve as tableaus of scenes from the Book of Revelations.  They believe that they are carrying out God's work which in this case is to prepare humanity for the end of the world.  Yet there is never a sense of urgency or fear to the crimes.  There is never a sense of city wide panic that is supposedly being caused by these crimes.  This is a crucial stumbling block since this poltline truly needs to provide an undercurrent of terror and suspense to the season.<br /><br />Season six also stuffs some filler plotlines into the narrative that never really go anywhere.  Most notably, Dexter tracks down a geriatric former serial killer known as the Tooth Fairy.  In another less than satisfying plot development, Laguerta becomes involved in a political quagmire with her chief.  Again, it doesn't really add a lot to this season.<br /><br />Still, there is a lot to like about this latest season.  The performances are strong as usual, with the exception of Hanks who feels woefully miscast.  Especially good is Jennifer Carpenter as Debra who has to deal with a lot this season including a breakup with Quinn and a prmotion to Lieutenant which comes with all sorts of political trappings. Mos Def is also exceptional as Brother Sam, a refomred convict who has devoted his life to God and tries to help Dexter come to terms with the darkness within him.  And of course, the season ends with one heck of a twist that sets up what will likely be the producers' end game.<br /><br />No, season six is not perfect but it is still worth watching.  And it ends by leaving viewers with the hope that the momentum of that final scene will propel the series to a worthy conclusion.  That would make the shortcomings of this season all but forgotten.eptional as Brother Sam, a refomred convict who has devoted his life to God and tries to help Dexter come to terms with the darkness within him.

B008MG1E4A|3.0|I seldom read, in fact I have only really read a handful of books in my 61 year old life.<br />I am very interested in world affairs and killing Bin Laden was a huge accomplishment, so I was interested.<br />The tough life of a SEAL can not be disputed, and their dedication to country is monumental.<br />The only revelation is the difference between what the press told the world, and what is in the book, just how Bin Laden was killed.

B004DP9QFS|5.0|This is absolutely brilliant.  I woke just before 6 this morning.  Normally that's a good 2 or 3 hours early for me because I work evenings.  I couldn't sleep and wondered what time sunrise came.  I thought \\"there must be an app for that!\\"  And there was.  Several, in fact.  I'm so glad I chose this one.  I can't even describe how much geeky fun I had with it.<br /><br />I don't know how appealing it would be for everyone else but I had a lot of fun watching the sun rise on my app and seeing it out the window, too.  It has several screens.  One is a view of the world as it is at that moment.  I could see the cloud cover, the hurricane in the Atlantic, the clouds from the storm that just left us (you can hide the cloud cover if you like), the abundance of lights on the East Coast, and the somewhat fewer lights across the states, the other countries and where they had light, though nothing compared to the US East Coast, and exactly where on the globe had sunlight.  All of Africa had sunlight, so did Asia.  The US was in darkness.  I know, I'm rambling, but at 6am this was totally cool.  Oh, and you could see the moon, its current phase, and where it was around the globe.<br /><br />The next screen had a kind of compass that couldn't show true north because the Fire doesn't have GPS but it showed an analog clock and told the current length of day, solar transit, sunset time and how long away it was, sunrise time and how long away it was, dusk time and the same, and dawn time and the same.<br /><br />I haven't played with it yet because I fell asleep around then but it also has a screen saver that I can't wait to try out.

B001CMV1MG|3.0|This ultimate DVD edition is likely to be the best presentation of the controversial film \\"Caligula\\" for a long time to come. The DVD box includes several versions as well as a fascinating look behind the scenes of what remains a stunning erotic, cinematic epic.
B0079R8KXG|5.0|Very nice case, faux leather has a great look and feel to it.  The plastic clips that lock that kindle in place are very effective, the kindle doesn't budge at all when in the case and the clips have nearly no affect on the sound from the speakers (if you listen VERY carefully you might notice a barely lower max volume, but it really is only the slightest difference).  One of my favorite aspects on this case is that you can modify the angle when you stand the kindle up for video viewing, some case designs only allow for one standing angle, this case just lets you bend it around until you're comfortable. One thing to note is that this is not a heavy duty case.  It is great for protecting your kindle from general wear and tear or being scratched or dinged in a bag or when its sitting out, but it is not a \\"hard\\" case to be dropped constantly without fear of damage.<br /><br />The last thing I can point out is this case does work with the 2nd gen Kindle Fire, just in case that is a concern.

1593272774|3.0|... and lots of confusion!<br /><br />Being a Lego fan myself, I thought this book would be a winner. Unfortunately, the lack of text in the book (although that shouldn't have surprised me because Lego is generally completely visual in its instructions) was off-putting, and especially the idea that you need a lot of different pieces to actually make the machines.<br /><br />But, as one reviewer pointed out already, perhaps making the machines isn't the point, but the construction of the machines to fire young minds? If that's the case, it may work for a few kids, but I know so many that would quickly get bored of the book if they couldn't actually make the machines.<br /><br />Good try Lego, but not all my cup of tea. Perhaps it's time to return to my [[ASIN:B003CZ1AHW LEGO Harry Potter Hogwarts Castle (4842)]]. :)
B008MG1E4A|4.0|Controversial book, but I didn't see what the big fuss was about. It was an easy read and interesting. Good flow with enough background on the SEALS; I wasn't ready for the book to end!
159413586X|5.0|And so it's done... I don't exactly feel as empty as I did when I finished 60 hours of The Wire, but the end of Katniss's story was beautifully executed. The writer lets you know that you can't trust her not to kill the main characters, and so I had no idea how she was going to finish it. And yet when I got to the end, it really couldn't have been any other way. I don't think you can ask for more than that at the end of a three book journey.

1594135851|4.0|Only 3,505 reviews? My word... did that many people really drop it after the first one? I don't believe it... although, although...<br /><br />This isn't such a strong book as The Hunger Games. The problem is the first person narrative voice. We spend too much time in Katniss's head being told about stuff happening to other people around her. In the first book, it all happened to her and it happened fast. Now, stuff swirls around her, and the story would be so much stronger for a third person voice, where we could see the impact of her earlier actions elsewhere. Ironically this won't be a problem in the movie, as we've already seen in the opening film.<br /><br />But it's still worth the read - the action picks up again in Mockingjay, and anyway, you just have to find out what happens, don't you?
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I sacrificed sleep for this book!! i couldnt put it down! i cant wait to read catching fire now! love!

Read it.
B007KCG7MQ|5.0|Any fan or follower of Joe Walsh's career (I been listening to Joe since about 1967) knows what to expect when the man gets serious and puts out a solo lp. He has put out so many albums with James Gang, Barnstorm, The Eagles and guested on many many albums with people from Ringo Star to Emerson Lake and Palmer so he has been around the block a time or two. If you remember how big a hit he pulled off with the Life's Been Good song from the album \\"But Seriously Folks\\" and how good that one was back in 1978 then you will eat this one up. This is by far the best Joe Walsh album I have heard in years. What ratchets this one up for me is the fact that he really put some style variety of songs on here and there is not a poor song on the whole thing. Go JOE! Once you hear this one the next thought is \\"damn it Joe , get back on Tour minus the Eagles for a change!\\"
B008AWBQGW|4.0|At first I wasn't sure if I liked the new sound or not.  I've been a Skynyrd fan since the arrival of their signature songs of \\"Sweet Home Alabama\\" and \\"Freebird\\" which is playing in my patrol vehicle right now.  New songs grow on you like the oldies.  Good Job.  Skynyrd fan till I die....I'll be 65 in October and still loving their music....Thanks
B006CHML4I|4.0|The watch itself is works well enough as long as you wear it every day (It's is a autowinder after all). The band is servicable and more confortable that a medal band but tend to show stains or fading with time. For me this is not a major problem but if you needed one that looks consistently good go with black band or metal.  If you like the tridition or relaiablity of a machine watch this is a very good buy.
B0010X745K|1.0|Awful ending, as pointless as you'd find in any low budget one-star made-for-TV movie on the SyFy Channel. A total betrayal of Stephen King's original ending, and of the art of story telling in general.
B002BU0DPE|4.0|First of all, the sound people have been complaining about only happens when you raise the chat volume. It is very noticeable when it is much higher but I do not put my chat volume over the game volume. If you do not care about hearing the game better and knowing whether or not someone is near you in a shooting game, do not buy this. I have not had these long enough to say if this breaks easily because people complain about that but you do need to take could care of it. The set-up takes 1 minute and very self-explanatory. If you play on a daily bases, you should buy this. For the people who are deciding whether to get the X11's or the PX21's, think about it this way. If you have a PS3, you need the PX21's because they are the only ones that support it and you should defiantly not get the P21's, they are not even close to as good as the PX21's. If you have and Xbox 360 and aren't looking to save 15 bucks on buying the cheaper x11's then chose the PX21's. They have more features and less of a buzzing sound. They also sound very good and it is easy to speak and be heard. If you need to save money, go for the x11's cause it is almost the same thing. Here are some of my pros and cons.
B008X9Z3UC|2.0|This is really just a zippered pouch.  I thought, judging from the photo, that it was a true \\"case\\" which would unzip like a book, and hold the Kindle inside.  I also assumed those leather patches on the sides were pockets for stuffing papers, a credit card, etc.  Nope.  This is just a pouch, to put your Kindle in when you're not using it.  With some decorative leatherish patches on the sides.  I am really, really disappointed this was Amazon's recommended case for the new Fire, because I love the Fire, and it deserves better.

B008MG1E4A|5.0|Excellent!  This books highlights the facts that our country has brave, dedicated people serving in her military and that they are well-equipped for the assignment.  I appreciate that 'peek' into that mission and into the heart and mind of that warrior.  Thank you for your service... each of you.
B004XGN8W4|1.0|The G155 is a great system, when it works however. I have three friends who have purchased this unit and we had the same thing happen to us. The screens tend to go out alot.

My third friend however is having to send his second one back for the same problem...
1612183956|5.0|I LOVED this book!!  I bought it as the first book on my new Kindle.  I really didn't know anything about it or the author.  I read it in 3 hours.  It was that good.  I kept trying to figure out what was going on but was completely floored by the ending.  There are plenty of reviews that explain the story...this review is just to tell you to read it!!  Excellent find and a total page turner.
B006LSZECO|1.0|Spoiler alert: i read this book as part of my book club. I was about 25% in and was going to give up, but my friend said there was a plot twist at the half way point, so I skipped ahead and was able to finish it. The discussion was great at club this month since the rest of the ladies enjoyed the book, but I would never have finished it otherwise. Unlikeable characters as the number one reason.

B007I1Q4W2|5.0|&#34;Exit Humanity&#34; is so far above 90 percent of the &#34;Zombie&#34; genre films coming out lately, it is almost not a zombie film.  Full of the depth, feeling, and realism of a drama about the loss and pain left after the bloodiest battle in America's history, I found myself wondering at times, why the producer and director hadn't changed directions and filmed an engaging Civil War drama.  But I'm also glad they did not.  For it lifted the tired old story of a man losing everything after the war, and seeking revenge, and hope, to a whole new level with the zombie background story.  Or maybe I should've said, it lifted the zombie genre to a whole new level with the Civil War as the backdrop.  The film is suitably dark, grim, and emotional, as zombie films should be.  The cast is excellent here, with a mixture of brand new (Mark Gibson) and veteran actors (Stephen McHattie and Dee Wallace) working well together. If I have one minor gripe, it is that I would've loved to see more screen time with Stephen McHattie.  Some have complained about the pacing, but I believe the director did this intentionally, giving the film an old world, pre-technological feel as it built character backgrounds and developed a well thought out story-line.  And the zombie effects were beautifully horrible.  Better than I've seen in a long time (the exception being the series &#34;The Walking Dead&#34;). Recommended big time for zombie horror fans.

B001J29H9I|5.0|As a pretty big Black Keys fan, it is sort of disappointing that my favorite album of theirs is a cover album, but oh-well. This album is beautiful. I originally purchased in 2006 and I have easily listened to it a few thousand times. Unlike the other Black keys albums, this one NEVER gets old. It was a perfect gateway for me into more classic blues.<br /><br />Purchase this album, you will not regret it.

B00943SQCI|5.0|Tim Burton and Johnny Depp did an awesome job in bringing back Dark Shadows for ONLY those of us who grew us with the actual experience.  Bravo Mr Burton.  It was a daunting task but you Sir, only you, were up to the challenge.  This movie, Dark Shadows, truly captured in a movie what the entire years devoted to watching could have possibly have tried to accomplish.  My mother and I loved that soap.  I loved the movie (now having watched twice) and I know my mother would have loved watching it with me...  Five stars no less but for only for those who grew up with it as I did with my mother...
B007QHKM76|2.0|Like many Sonata fans, I wait for each album coming out with baited breath.  And although the band made a hard turn with Unia, I thoroughly liked it and The Days of Grays (I'd give each 4 and 5 stars respectively).  But like another reviewer has stated, every album since Reckoning Night has required a time investment - a point at which it \\"clicks\\" and you realize just how good it is.<br /><br />With Unia, that moment came to me when listening to \\"The Harvest\\" for the umpteenth time.  Heck, I even liked \\"Zeros\\" eventually, even though it was the weakest track on Days by far.  And many, many of the songs on these albums are great and stand up over repeated listenings, such as \\"Caleb\\", \\"It Won't Fade\\", \\"The Dead Skin\\", and a song that never fails to give me chills, \\"The Last Amazing Grays\\".<br /><br />For sure these tracks are a little down tempo from raucous songs such as \\"The Cage\\", \\"Victoria's Secret\\", \\"Don't Say a Word\\", and a little less pretty than songs such as \\"Draw Me\\", or \\"Shamandalie\\".  However, they are well written, complex songs that stay with the listener.<br /><br />Then we come to Stones, an album that just feels like leftovers or tired ideas to me.  Track by track, there is very little here that brings me back to listen, and the songs lack a certain majesty or staying power that even track off the last two albums have.<br /><br />I was very optimistic with the opening track \\"Only the Broken Hearts...\\" as it had a decent riff, good tempo, and a great break in the middle of the song.  It mostly went downhill from here unfortunately.<br /><br />\\"S**tload of Money\\" is a S**tload of a song.  Boring and moronic, it plods from its uninspiring start to an unispiring finish.<br /><br />\\"Losing my Insanity\\" is the second best tune on the record, though it is a rehash of the song Tony originally wrote for Ari Koivunen.  I prefer the SA arrangement much more, though this would still be a middle of the road track on Unia.<br /><br />\\"Somewhere Close to You\\" is a grindingly anti-melodic song.  Even in the darker down-tempo songs, SA has always had a good melody.  Here, I just miss it, except for some hints in the chorus.  Grind, grind, grind, with odd vocals, and a depressing chorus.<br /><br />\\"I Have a Right\\" sounded great at first listen, but has not held up.  A little too overprocessed and slick, and with the bloody kid talking over the music in the break in the middle.  This is the textbook definition of when a band is trying to write a \\"hit\\".<br /><br />\\"Alone in Heaven\\" a somewhat plodding song with big vocals in the chorus.  Just has never hooked me - and always earns the skip button when it starts.<br /><br />\\"The Day\\" has some interesting parts, and reminds me of \\"White Pearl, Black Oceans\\" at times.  I think the lyrics are what kills this one for me, and the music is just a little too choppy to save it.<br /><br />\\"Cinderblox\\" is certainly an experiment.  Some like the banjo-fueled power metal sound.  Personally, I find this song also just a little too processed.  Although it is in the top half of the tracks on the album, it also just hasn't grabbed me.<br /><br />\\"Don't be Mean\\" is gah!  Whiny lyrics set to a non-inventive downtempo melody.  Even my wife doesn't like it, and she's the target market.<br /><br />\\"Wildfire Part II\\" is not bad - a very odd song with many disjointed parts, it almost sounds like 3 or so songs in a row.  There are some very good bits, some OK bits, and some cruddy bits.  An inventive track, but still lacking that \\"hook\\" factor that keeps you coming back.<br /><br />\\"Wildfire Part III\\" is one of my other favourites on the album.  A lot more fast-paced melody in the song, good grinding riffs, and real turn turn to the dark side at 2:46 - just wished they had repeated this section of the song at least once more.<br /><br />\\"Tonight I Dance Alone\\" makes sense, as a myopic cliched ballad like this should make it difficult to attract a dance partner.<br /><br />So unfortunately, I give the album 2 stars.  Sonata at 2 stars is better than most of the crap you hear on the radio these days, but they have set the bar so high for themselves that anything less than spectacular (especially after Days) is bound to be a disappointment.<br /><br />And I think the main way I can judge this album is that I will skip more tracks on this particular disc than I will on any other Sonata disc I have.
B002ZG999U|4.0|enjoyed having so many big stars together.  They worked well together. Storyline was a bit unbelievable as these kind of movies often are, but it was a lot of fun.

0525953728|5.0|Well written book. I enjoyed reading it. It was engaging enough that I finished it in a single day.<br /><br />Unlike other Navy SEAL books, this one does not waste time regurgitating how grueling their training is. In addition, the author was a member of DEVGRU, the most elite tier of Navy SEALs, and he explains some of the differences which was interesting reading.<br /><br />Then the author covers a few missions and dives into the Bin Laden raid. The pacing is just right, and there is enough detail without giving away anything super secret (e.g. about equipment, names of people or units, etc). I obviously have no idea if the events unfolded as described, but at least the story was interesting and seemed realistic.<br /><br />I am a bit puzzled about the brouhaha surrounding this book and the supposed political message it is trying to send. First of all, most professional armed forces personnel in practically all countries skew conservative, so it is no wonder that the author and some of his buddies did not vote for Obama. At the end of the raid they quipped that their superiors (all the way to the top) would try to derive maximum profit from the SEAL team's success - this is already happening and should not be a surprise. There is surprisingly little discussion of politics in the book. Overall the book is a lot less jingoistic and conservative than other recent SEAL books like Lone Survivor or American Sniper.<br /><br />Recommended.
B00005JM20|5.0|I'd seen this movie a few years ago and knew it would be a fine addition to my already large DVD collection.

B008220AVW|5.0|My wife would not let our 10 Yr Old grandaughter see the movie,  because of some discussion she saw on the View.  I am hardly a Katy Perry fan,  but read the other reviews and decided to see for myself.  The only negative I could come up with was that the \\" music \\" was secondary to the \\"story line\\" which went into her background and events leading up to her becoming a Pop Superstar. They also added in her marriage and divorce from Russel Brand.<br /><br />Not one of her songs was performed from beginning to end and the sound quality was sub standard.I can't help but contrast this movie with the Glee Concert Movie, where the sound and performances were far superior in presentation.<br /><br />All of that being said,  I was impressed by this young woman,  her perserverance and talent.  For those biddies on the View who apparently critized her costumes;<br />I would suggest that they remember that she is a \\" Pop Music \\"  star.  Pop Music is filled with Elton John,  Madonna,  Lady Gaga and Michael Jackson types.  In comparision  Katy Perry is a pillar of sanity.

B002ZG99A4|4.0|This one is a must-have for action movie fans just for the mega-action starpower lineup alone. The storyline was pretty much your typical standard action movie fare, which means that it barely had much of a plot and was nothing that you haven't already seen told a million times before, but that's all that it really needed to be. The action is what counts most and it was through-the-roof, and that's what these kinds of movies are really all about anyways. Just to see all of these big-name action movie stars together on the screen all at the same time was definitely worth it and I look forward to seeing the next chapter in the series.

030746363X|4.0|This book is hugely interesting, some great tips/shortcuts on achieving fitness goals.  My only critique is based on the amount of the book that is focused on weight loss.  Also, the focus is purely on results, which is good in one way.  However, on deeper analysis the author is soo focused on the result that he has a tendency to miss the more important theme.  For example; when outlining weight loss techniques he mentions not to eat fruit due to its high fructose content.  However fruits are actually good for you in moderation.  Together fruits can provide you with incredibly high levels of nutrients and minerals that are essential for healthy living.  He also outlines the use of high doses of caffeine to lose body fat, and increase ones metabolic rate.  One important factor that is ignored and it's an important one.  Is that actually good for you?  I would argue perhaps not.  Don't get me wrong this book is filled with interesting health tips, as an example I am having cold showers daily, and feel great as a result.  Also consuming Lemon before meals.  Perhaps just take it with a pinch of salt, and common sense.  I am still reading it, and hugely enjoying the process! So by all means a buy recommendation!!
B002ZCY7SW|5.0|I'm a devoted fan of 24, so I think season 8 is dynomite; I'm dating myself. The action was, of course, fantastic. I got a chance to revisit season 8 and enjoy a lot of scenes that I had forgotten about, so it still seemed fresh and kept me interested. Although my favorite seasons are 2, 3, 4, 5, I thorough enjoy them all! Oh and I received the DVD on time and in excellent condition.

B0057O6IMS|4.0|I have been a fan of the badly-dubbed Italian Giallo flicks for quite awhile.  I know almost every Dario Argento film by heart.  I happened across a list of slasher films that I hadn't seen before and this one came up on my Netflix queue.  This is actually my first Lucio Fulci film.  It was a beautiful, restored version.  I found it a lot of fun.  While I can't be scared of a movie like this with terrible acting, bad dubbing and laughable effects, it was still a joy to watch.  I laughed every time they said the little boy's name was Bob.  And that bat attack scene had me laughing so hard my stomach hurt.  Give it a try if you haven't seen it.  You won't be let down.  I can't wait to check out some of his other ones.
B002UF95XG|2.0|Note: I saw this movie with XFinity On Demand.<br /><br />Made after Torn Curtain, Topaz is Hitchcock's return to the spy genre. However, the film fails to generate any real suspense, unlike his earlier films, which are masterpieces and the mostly abysmal Torn Curtain (which had at least one good sequence that had plenty of suspense in comparison to the rest of the movie). I liked John Forsythe (who would later play the unseen Charlie in Charlie's Angels), and Frederick Stafford was very good as Devereaux. The film was also much too long than it should have been, in my opinion. Could have had a better plot and a much better screenplay, though. In my opinion, Torn Curtain was the beginning of the end for The Master Of Suspense as far as suspenseful motion pictures were concerned...<br /><br />In my opinion, Marnie was Hitchcock's last great movie.<br /><br />Rated PG (mild language & violence and a brief love scene).

B007J4T2G8|2.0|Two women mentioned this book to me on the same day so I viewed it as more than a coincidence. I had no idea until the next week that this book was so popular. Rich, handsome, perfect man; beautiful young woman - typical Harlequin type material, but with an S&M twist. A complete waste of time - not awful, but not memorable. Read it so you can be current with your neighbors, especially if they are post-menopausal women...
B007UPNA6Y|4.0|I enjoyed the book for all the usual reasons - Jack, the twists and turns of a good yarn and  the unusual approach to justice prevailing. All in all a good read, but certainly not Lee Child's best effort imho.
0307594777|4.0|Recently having returned from a trip to Stockholm I picked up the first of the trilogy and could not put it down. Unlike other series, the sequel was equally good and if possible the third was even better. ALSO, the Swedish extended film series is almost true to the novels, well-cast and worth a rental. Great literature no, but fine reading.
B008DVJO8C|4.0|For background, I own all of the previous releases.  I loved 1/2 the old songs, but sometimes found the other half of the previous rleases to be a bit too much yelling for me.  There were some exceptions of course.<br /><br />For the new Blood release, I love the new sound on several of their tracks.  I think they've incorporated a few more hooks and harmonies, still leaving some good screaming as only Maria can do, and still with a heavy feel to the music.<br /><br />I caught them at a local small venue and they put on a good CD Release show for the crowd.<br />I hope they continue with this slightly more hook-oriented style.  I'll definitely go see them again if they are in the area.
0061692042|2.0|I read CANADA because my wife is Canadian and the author has won the Pulitzer prize. And the author tells the story of a boy coming of age alone, with his parents jailed. But frankly the reading is slow, the insight is nothing special, and there is nothing in CANADA that made any kind of impression.
0670022411|5.0|It's rare to find a book that you think about even when you're not reading it and whose world you're more involved in than your own. But that's how it was for me with Deborah Harkness' A Discovery of Witches - a book that's pure magic to me (no pun intended). It's now in a three-way tie for my all time favorite book (with Jennifer Lee Carrell's Interred with Their Bones and Anne Fortier's Juliet, in case you were wondering). The very fact that I wanted to read it again right away and was actually sad to have to return it to the library says a lot. (I've since purchased a copy from Amazon of both the hard back and audio book.)<br /><br />The story centers on Diana Bishop, a 30-something historian who specializes in  Medieval alchemy. When researching at Oxford, she accidentally calls up a long-lost, spellbound manuscript, Ashmole 782. She senses something strange about it and opens it, but doesn't read it. Although she's descendant from a long line of witches, she wasn't trained to use magic and so doesn't realize the impact of her ability to break the spell. She returns the manuscript just like any other book. That's when a host of vampires, demons and other witches start following her every move, all desperate to unlock the mystery of Ashmole 782, even if it costs Diana her life. Along the way she discovers she does indeed have magical powers (something else those otherworldly creatures are interested in) and forges an unlikely bond with vampire Matthew Claremont, an alliance that will both threaten and change her life in ways she could never imagine.<br /><br />I've seen this book described as \\"Twilight for the academic set.\\" That's like comparing foie gras with a hot dog. Yes, they both have controlling vampires. That's where the similarities begin and end, in my opinion. Twilight was a teenage love story with nothing more at stake (seriously, no pun intended) than Bella's life and heartbreak. This book is about the interaction of witches, humans, vampires and demons (which could be seen as an analogy for racial tolerance), evolution and the future of all of their kinds. It's about magic and mystery and their place in a scientifically dominated world. I'd say the stakes are a little higher here.<br /><br />I had no idea there were vampires in this book when I picked it up.  It contains three of my very favorite things: ornate libraries, an old, mysterious book, and magic (the Wiccan kind, not the Harry Potter kind), so I was hooked immediately. Even if that doesn't do it for you, the mystery surrounding the manuscript of Ashmole 782 will.<br /><br />I'm a huge fan of character-driven fiction and a Discovery of Witches excels in character development. You learn so much about them from their day-to-day lives and interactions with each other. Some are likeable, others are not, and there are a few you don't know if you can trust. Diana is by far my favorite, but then again, I relate to her on a number of levels, including her love of history, old books and unfortunate propensity toward panic attacks. For some odd reason, I was captivated by Diana's hobby of rowing (sculling to be precise) and plan to take that up myself as a result of having read this book. Matthew, despite being the main love interest, doesn't make me fall in love with him. I like him as a character, but I think it's my inability to trust him that keeps me at a distance. My favorite character is Marthe. Somehow, her mix of humor and down-to-earth wisdom is the perfect foil to Diana, Matthew and Ysabeau, all of whom can be too serious.<br /><br />The world, writing and plot of this book are also handled with expertise. I've never been to any of the locations, nor had I ever seen sculling before, but thanks to Harkness' evocative descriptions, I could see and hear it all. And all of the meals and wine that were described kept me hungry and in need of a drink (in a good way)! I especially love the Bishop House, which really is a character unto itself. It gave thebook some much-needed levity.<br /><br />A Discovery of Witches seems to be a love it or hate it book, judging from the number of one- and five-star reviews on Goodreads. It's a very layered story, and if you only take the time to focus on one point, you're going to miss a lot. This is a book that should be savored. But that doesn't mean it's not without its flaws. There were some plot points I didn't believe and others that I felt deserved more explanation, but I'm trusting Harkness has her reasons for handling things the way she did. That's one of the problems with not being able to read a series all the way through. A lot of times the author does things a certain way that will make perfect sense once you can see the story as a whole as she does. But as readers, we don't have that option along the way (at least not until all the books come out).<br /><br />(This is the short version of my review. If you want to read my long, spoilery, very passionate review, you can find it on Goodreads under Nicole Evelina - but I would suggest reading the book first because I touch on almost all the major plot points.)<br /><br />PS - If you get the chance to listen to the audio book, Jennifer Ikeda does an incredible job as the narrator.
1455502758|3.0|As a first time reader of this guy's work, I was expecting to read his deeper thoughts on mortality but I think he might have died before he got to that part.  A good writer for sure, but I felt the book was incomplete.  If you want to read how one person dealt with the cancer treatment, this is a good book.  I was sufficiently impressed with his writing to read another book written by said writer.  I viewed a Youtube video on his arguing for atheism against some Christian guy at Boila University in Southern CA, and Mr. Hitchens said nothing that I have not thought about already, so I don't believe he thinks more deeply than other writers on this subject or even myself, but he does write with a greater clarity and has a very good voice.  He's pretty honest in what he says, so he's no bullshitter for sure.  Actually, I find the entire argument on the existence of a god (or God) not very productive: It's like arguing whether coffee is good or bad for you -- it all depends.  All I know is that if a God exists, he or it is not likely to be the God we think it is.  Anyway, I was impressed enough to purchase the \\"Arguably\\" book by Hitchens.  I am somewhat skeptical towards reviewers who gave 5 stars; I would have given it 3.5 stars for a good effort but incompleteness.

B0096DFBZQ|2.0|hello all.thanks for reading.Pac man mart rally is a knock off of Mario cart.when I first got the game I was expecting easy controls easy rules like all basic racing games have.Instead,I got probably one of the most stupidest complicated thing in the racing market.lets start with the concept of the game:race the pac man around in his little cart to win the race.simple?lets continue.graphics:sub par.but its free. but its only a demo.its the same graphics for the full paid version.George Washington is turning in his grave.Highway robbery.controls:drum roll please...........like in the beginning of the reveiw.these are some of the worst controls on a racing game.I was expecting move my kindle up and down left right to steer the damn car.instead there are two little arrows on the screen one pointing to the left the other to the right.and that's how you steer.there is no responsiveness its just vague steering.like I'm driving lays chips.light and airy. no feedback from the game.there is acceleration button. just the brake.and the rest is a jumble mess.leaving me to question the sanity and brains of man kind.thanks for reading.

B008MG1E4A|3.0|This is a very straight-forward account; has the ring of credibility about it.  I had hoped for more background about Abbottabad, but the author does not seem to have done any research on the circumstances of UBL hiding there.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|This is an easy read, magnet. Loved it! The writer builds on his life experience to be a seal, then the topgun seal...with ever so modesty. I hope the movie stays true to the book. Hey Steven Spilberg, better buy the rights fast. This would be a great movie or better yet a 3 part series. My Uncle (dads only sipling) I never knew; graduated Naval Academy 1937, Volunteered right after Pearl Harbor, killed north Africa Aug,1942. I love the personal stories and I salute you.
B004DTXJ4S|5.0|I love the whole resident evil series! I couldn't find this particular movie in the store for less than 15$ so I used amazon instant video. I can play it right from my PS3 like with the DVDs so there's no drawback to not having a disc except that Internet is necessary. I always have Internet for my ps3 so it's not even an issue. There's no buffering or loading with amazon instant video either for me!
0553801473|1.0|The first book in this series, the actual 'Game of Thrones', was incredibly interesting. It was a whole new world, with complex and well-developed characters. It was a world of wonder, of legend and of horror. Game of Thrones got me from its first page.<br /><br />Then came the second book. And I thought... Meh.<br />Then the third book. MEH.<br />The fourth book. \\"Oh Lord, I hope the fifth is better than this ****!\\".<br />And the fifth book...<br /><br />A Dance with Dragons is one of the worst books I have EVER read in my life. More than a thousand pages long, and NOTHING happens. I really don't know what Martin was thinking when he decided to write this book.<br /><br />Okay, after the first book we already had clues that the series was not going anywhere, but one couldn't help but hope that such an incredible writer would be able to produce something good after so much time.<br /><br />Guess what? This book can't deliver.<br /><br />In fact, when I say that NOTHING HAPPENS in this book, I really mean it. The characters just wander around, CLEARLY filling pages. I don't know why would any editor publish this kind of work.<br /><br />I am probably not the only one, but I SHALL NOT buy the other two books, if they ever get released. This is simply one of the worst written works I've had the misfortune to read.<br /><br />Take this from a former fan: don't waste your money on this.
B0050ZPAPA|4.0|I've just started reading the Iron Druid books by Kevin Hearne and have totally got lost in the story! Well written; engrossing plot that develops at a pace you can keep up with; action is spaced but exciting; finding it hard to put down the book at a reasonable hour. Have read about 10 books in the last few months trying to find another as engrossing as the likes of Anne (& Todd) MacCaffrey, Terry Goodkind, Terry Pratchet, Jim Butcher, et al.<br /><br />So glad there's more books after the first!<br />Thank you Mr Hearne,<br />Kath
B008I3QZKU|1.0|I couldn't get through half of Battle Born before I realized that I'm just going to have to face the reality that there is no hope here. The Killers are dead. Maybe they were killed. Either way I hope they rest in peace and stop tarnishing the memory of their phenomenal first album.<br /><br />I re-listened to Hot Fuss again just to make sure my tastes haven't changed or something, and that still stands as an epic fantastic album.<br /><br />Their only hope is to get a new lead singer. Brandon Flowers now somehow manages to consistently sound like a dying walrus who still has to force emotion about the situation. This album will likely put him out of his misery.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book.  I love books that contain military, suspense, and thriller storylines to begin with.  What made this book the best in that could be considered within those categories was that it was based on factual information from a source that was actually there and played a major role in the removal of a major threat against the United States and other nations.  I'm not sure what secrets that the Pentagon would be worried about disclosing from this book.  Many of the tactics that were used in the missions told about in \\"No Easy Day\\" are mentioned in many other fictional books that I've read.  Loved this book!!
B0071XO8RA|4.0|First the good: it is a riveting story. There were almost no dull parts and most of the characters were engaging, believable and cool.<br /><br />Some things that I think were lacking: sometimes the characters will do things that are a bit absurd.<br /><br />Anyhow another thing I would of have liked is for Hugh to have went deeper into the culture and way of life in the silo. He basically didn't truly flesh out what life in the silo is like and why some things are the way they are. For instance we never find out why people cannot talk of the \\"outside\\". I mean you don't just say: dont talk of the outside period. It's like nobody ever explaining the reasoning about burning books in Fahrenheit 451, or the the need of the totalitarian government in V for Vendetta. It just felt that a lot of the silo was not fleshed out and there are a lot of questions that were left in a very shallow state.<br /><br />I like Hugh's writing style and a I think it is quite engaging, although a bit simplistic. Like I mentioned before sometimes the characters do absurd things just so the story can advance in the direction the author wanted. Some of the characters felt a bit too Marry Sue for my taste. He also uses coincidences, as well as resolving certain situations in an impossible way. For instance there are two places in the book where a character has miraculously the exact amount of air to barely survive which is a cheap trick and can be handled better.<br /><br />Overall I enjoyed the book greatly with a few minor gripes, and am starting the 6th book which should give a glimpse of how it all started which will be fascinating.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|The book was extremely well written, it showed many aspects of being in the greatest military in the world! Mark Owen is a hero and should be treated as one.

B006LSZECO|2.0|The descriptive writing in this book was very good and sometimes quite funny.  The plot, however, was completely predictable for a mystery. I knew the outcome at about 25% of the way through the book.  The two main characters are completely not likable from page 2 on. They are both loathsome, with not one memorable redeeming quality for either Nick or Amy.  I'm still not sure why or how I was able to finish reading the entire book. I am not inspired to read anything else by this author after this book.

0385344333|5.0|I did like \\"A Wanted Man\\" as different as it was from the others in the Jack Reacher series. This was a gentler Reacher, a thinking Reacher, a understanding Reacher. The book was well paced, I liked the jumps between different scenes and I liked the humanization of Jack Reacher. It's a good story, lots to figure out and watching Reacher work effectively with others. Of course I like the gun battles, the fists against the face we see in the other books, but I don't want to see a one-sided Jack Reacher. This book will allow future books to mix the thinking with the action.

B002ZFQD04|2.0|I got the dvd to see what i missed on this tour. I have seen Madonna live several times and she always amazes me i wasn't a fan of the latest \\"Hard Candy\\" album (first one i dint like) so i figured i would hold on to my two hundred and fifty dollars to see her tour for a better album. After seeing this dvd i am so glad i did. The show was ....well....lame. They did the intro to 4 minuets like 50 times the song would start then stop then start it was annoying.  Her choice of old songs were random which is good but if she was going to go random she should of done  really old. There seemed to be no joy in the show and the production was pretty typical. No big costume changes for her or the dancers it all just seemed basic. There was a bit of a heavy Hip Hop feel to the music which made me feel sad, i felt she was following trends instead of forging her own; the dancers had no personalities wear her later shows the production gave way to the dancers with out talking seem almost like actors. Which she talks about in the bonus footage but didn't do it live i found that weird and a bit of an after thought. There were bits wear whole songs were going on and she was not even on stage they say there is the song rain, no its a \\"mash up\\" being played with the eurthmics \\"Hear Comes the rain again\\" while Madonna is off stage changing they do allot of that. One last thing in regards to the lack of joy in the show, as Madonna has grown as an artist it seems to me she has gotten more angry she seems pissed off all the time now. Oh well, I thank god i didn't pay the ridiculous price to see it live, and now there is the MDMA album another album that seems lazy so once again i can stay home. I guess the new Madonna is no longer a trail blazer but a follower. Sad but in these economic times i just don't feel its right to pay the prices expected to pay anyway so ill happily skip this tour as well, ill wait and see the next PINK tour instead.
B008I3QZKU|5.0|I remember buying this album the day of its release and my 1st listen was met with some mixed emotions. For some reason, I didn't expect The Killers to change their sound... As they do with every album. But by the end of the week, I knew I was listening to something special. The songs flow track-to-track unlike any of their previous albums... I personally think that the band is telling one large story with how the tracks are lined up. I won't spoil anything, but if you own it or buy it - Put it on and listen 1-12.

B002BU0DPE|2.0|I really enjoyed having these while I play xbox/ps/pc games. But only after 10 months of adult use and care, the right side earpiece broke from the headset frame, allowing the earpiece to just dangle freely.  After careful inspection of what had broken, the plastic piece that covers the frame to the earpiece broke away from the little screws inside.  Disappointed they didn't last longer.  I would recommend looking in to a different headset.
1402270275|5.0|This is one of the best books I've read in awhile. The story line was great and the characters were exceptional. There was romance and suspense. I wll be purchasing the next book in the series. I hope this is more than a trilogy! The only thing I couldn't get my head around was the cover. Blade was a blonde and Honoria was a redhead, I believe. I'm not sure where the picture for this cover came from!

Cinder's world is a beautiful tapestry of old world style and steampunk alternate reality.  Cinder herself is confident, strong and determined not be crushed by the circimstances of her life. Prince Kai is a great mixture of all my favorite \\"Princes\\". The story of Cinder was fast-paced and enjoyable.  But maybe most important to me; I can share this book with both my teen and pre-teen daughters!!  I can't wait for them to finish the book so we can talk about it.  The worst part about Cinder is that I have to wait for the next book (Scarlet) for the story to continue.
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|Honestly, I bought this book on a Saturday mid morning and was done Sunday afternoon. I could not put it down. Yes, I laughed out loud in a crowded coffee shop. If you love or even if you just like, heck, even if you can just appreciate Tina Fey's writing, you need to get, read and memorize this book. Got parents who get uncomfortable about everything? Get them this book. Got friend's who just don't laugh enough? Get them this book. Got love for yourself? Get this book.<br /><br />Loved it.
B0041KW2UQ|1.0|This version of Pinocchio was in Italian! No where in the discription does this item indicate that it is the Italian version! Now I have to send it back to Italy for a refund...
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Its good for when your bord or need to keep occupied. I haven't bought any coins yet, and I recoment that purchasers just let them accumulate over time.
B008HK3XOU|3.0|this product is very good except for 1 feature. the power plug cannot be inserted with seat cover closed lucky. if you try to rotate the Kindle to get the power plug expose the ON of function of the way to cover does not work. easy to fix.
0316113506|5.0|SPARK is a brilliant and very well researched book.<br /><br />Dr. Ratey has done a great job explaining all the intricacies and benefits that occur in the brain and body when one's excercise.<br /><br />The chapters on anxiety and depression are particularly good and very informative.<br /><br />Even thought at times the book becomes very technical in the use of medical terminology, it remains very readable.<br /><br />Read this book and change your life!
0321714113|4.0|Disclaimer: I received a free copy of this book in exchange for a review.<br /><br />Working through this book for the last few weeks, I've found it to be very well laid out.<br /><br />I have a background with some light scripting and found this book easy to follow.<br /><br />I am only about a third of the way through the book, but I bounced around some.<br /><br />The font is clean, the index is accurate(I did some spot checking for the review), the text is concise and clear.<br /><br />From the beginning the authors take you through how to work a basic compiler and then move into a quick overview of flow control. They then take it chapter by chapter breaking it all down and adding in to what you've learned.<br /><br />I saw a review mention not wanting to turn on a computer. Are you serious?  This isn't something you read once and know the language.  If you want to learn c++ you need to take this book, open it up in front of a computer, read part of a chapter topic, and work with it until you understand the topics point and can make it do what it is supposed to do, move on to the next topic, repeat.  Mastery of C++ takes time, the basics come quickly(though not immediately), but you will work on becoming better for as long as you code.<br /><br />Overall I was expecting the book to be full of typos and have a huge errata considering the size, but thus far it's been very clean and the examples very accurate. I'm not even sure if there is an errata available.<br /><br />From what I have worked through so far I would recommend this book for someone with patience and dedication who wants to be an excellent c++ programmer.<br />The only negative I have is I too would like more complete code examples so that when I experiment with an example I know more quickly if it is me or the code making an error. So far it's been me, so this could be considered part of the learning process.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Amazing book best on ive ever read loved it im so excited to read the next two yea yea yea got katniss
B008XG1X18|4.0|I really like this app. It is so much better than any other pinterest apps that are available. My only complaint is that it isn't easier to create new pins.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|its fun but if you don't have real money or want spam in your email it can be tedious to get coins for new games.
B008MG1E4A|1.0|Not a lot of information on the actual raid itself, I suppose if this was only about the raid it would be a five page book.  At what point did the man become more important than the mission?  This guy is so worried about his security and that of his teammates that he writes a book? Then he goes on to chastise politicians and media for leaking the story......<br />What was the true reason behind putting it on paper.  I Was hoping for a lot more when I purchased this book, great they got him but if you have to be self serving and self promoting you should  keep it to yourself.  This book  is a slap in the face to all of the great men and women who have served in our special forces and truly believed that no one individual is more important than the team.  He said it was time for him to leave the teams and focus on himself and that he did.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|challenging puzzles and item searches. very good plot without too much dialog. long game. possibly the best one yet and I've played a lot.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The Hunger Games is one of the best books I have read in years! I would recommend it to people of all ages! The movie is great but you really need to read the book to get the full experience! Also, I would recommend that you read the rest of the trilogy but I warn you, you will be so disappointed when it ends..... So I just read them all over again.
B00846REIS|2.0|I bought this book at the recommendation of a friend after finishing Fifty Shades of Gray.  There was nothing about any of the characters I could relate to, and there were plot lines left unanswered.  I couldn't believe it when I reached the last page.  There was no resolution to a number of plotlines!  I guess one must inhabit the world of the beautiful and rich to understand and identify with this book.
B006LSZECO|3.0|This book was good and worth a read.  I am very critical of fiction writing, and this author is really very good.  The dialogue was believable and the storyline compelling.<br /><br />However.  The first half of the book was far superior to the second half.  Once I saw where the second half was going, I was ready for the book to end.  And when I finally got to it, I was disappointed with the books resolution.<br /><br />All in all, if you like mystery/thrillery kind of books, you will enjoy this book enough to give it a go.
B0083GQKQG|5.0|Eva (Tilda Swinton) is a wife and mother who has just experienced the last in a series of shattering incidents. In flashbacks, we see her happy life change forever with the birth of her unusual son. From that first day, she never feels any bond with him while he seems equally detached from and even hateful toward her.<br /><br />This is an incredibly intense and heartbreaking film, dealing with the problem of alienation, the nature of familial love, and unspeakable violence.  All of the actors are excellent and I'm surprised they and the movie didn't get some Oscar nominations.  Swinton is utterly convincing as the emotionally-drained mother; she kept me on the edge of my seat every second.  John C. Reilly is very likable as the naïve, loving husband.  The three young actors who play the son are remarkable; their performances are so intense I could barely watch them, yet couldn't look away.  The flashback format is sometimes confusing but helps to convey the chaotic, emotional, roller coaster that is Eva's life.<br /><br />This chilling, excruciatingly sad story is hard to watch, but the acting, writing, and direction are just outstanding.  Highly recommended (but not if you're looking for a fun movie).
0525953728|5.0|I thought this was an excellent read, first off it was a very easy read.  It was like you were having a conversation with the guy and that was one of the reason it was hard to put down.  The other, all the cool ninja SEAL stories that you wanted to read about and see how they ended.<br /><br />He knew there are a lot of SEAL books out there, so he doesn't bore you with his BUD/S training in 20 chapters like other books do.  This is a look into a world that the majority of Americans know nothing about, even if you think you do.  I really liked all the stories he told and I am glad I didn't just open the book read about UBL and then it was over.  It was all a lead up to it, and he also gives you the break down of what he went through after the missions.<br /><br />I recommend this book if you want to read some great stories about a great bunch of Americans.  Read the book and enjoy it for what it is.
B005LAIHXQ|1.0|I am a fan of Ridley Scott, and I really believe that Blade Runner and Alien are two of the great sci-fi dramas of our time, but this movie is an atrocious mess.  It is loud, un-intelligent and generic as can be.  The movie lacks any kind of character or identify, and would have been better pimped the \\"Alien\\" DNA for street cred.  The characters are extremely stupid and uninteresting, as was the entire plot.  I really thought this was a cerebral film, from many of the previews, but it turn out to be a truly horrible monster movie, with a mess that left a massive door for a sequel.  Not only that...as it basically copied the endings from Alien and Aliens and fused them to creative this mess.  I downloaded this in the early digital version, and I wish I had Redbox this garbage, as it would have saved me some bucks!<br /><br />- The plot is generic, science team sent to investigate planet, science team finds discovery to shake the foundation of our understanding, the discovery turns out to be a monster.<br />- The monsters are generic mix of biological and physical ghoulies.<br />- As usual, everybody dies in predictable ways, except for the heroine (hero), and the open-ended closing to try and set up sequels.<br />- Nothing new to the genre OR to movie making.  It's just a horrendous bit of monster movie boredom.<br /><br />Skip this like the plague!
B0087HT36U|5.0|A fun game.  My only complaint would be that on some levels,  you cannot prevent losing a peasant because it will not let you fire fast enough.  Otherwise,  a very enjoyable game.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|This is a truly great application. Based on a traditional concept of puzzle it is a wonderful and enjoyable variation. I highly recommend having this one.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I am addicted to this game. I play it daily I was nice to get my mom addicted to it.
B005LAIHY0|2.0|I expected much more when I saw this in IMAX 3D. The plot was disjointed and was hard to follow. From the opening to the end, the story felt like someone was just trying to make a movie but forgot the purpose. Some scenes were \\"entertaining\\", but I was not expecting to be so let down in the end. Some good cast members, but this movie has only one point, which is to separate you from your money and you get very little for it. Don't waste your money, I am sure it will show up on HBO or Showtime quickly.
