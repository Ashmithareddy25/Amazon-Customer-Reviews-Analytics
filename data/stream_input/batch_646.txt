0375703764|5.0|This was the scariest, most thought provoking novel that I have ever read. The book inspired detailed imagery and character development that allowed the reader to feel like an intricate part of the story as the pages turned! <br /> <br />The author has done a great job in portraying the confusion and loss of control that his character feels. The crescendo of events and challenges that these characters endure will leave readers holding there breath and clutching their pillow even though they know that this is just a work of fiction. The concept of the tale is fascinating and very well thought out; I had to sleep with the light on for a few days. <br /> <br />
B00006CXSS|5.0|The correlation between the characters in this series is amazing.  The series literally takes you back through just about every aspect of what would happen in that situation, from the training to the end of the war.

B000E41MS6|5.0|Buy the Dr. Who Complete First Series DVD set now! Don't be a cheapskate like me. On a whim, I bought Volume 1 of the Series last Friday and by Sunday, I was compelled to purchase the remaining three volumes. The show is just that good! Christopher Eccleston is phenomenal as the Doctor. Witty, sarcastic, cerebral, vindictive, compassionate and ocasionally scary. I challenge anyone to watch the Dalek episodes and not be impressed by Eccleston's performance! I know Sci Fi series aren't supposed to be Shakespeare. But Eccleston transcends the genre. Billie Piper and the supporting cast are all great as well. It's great watching The Doctor and Rose's relationship intensify with each episode... <br /> <br />I'm an American who grew up watching Tom Baker's Dr. Who on PBS. So naturally, I was skeptical about the latest incarnation of the hero. Nevertheless, all my reservations were for naught! Russell T. Davies has done a commendable job resurrecting the series. He somehow managed to update the show without compromising the integrity of the characters!Bravo. I only wish Eccleston had at least given us one more season....Buy the set or each volume individually...but don't pass this gem up!
B000J103PC|5.0|Meryl Streep has to be the most versatile actor around. <br />She was so different in \\"Hours\\" and the multitude of films she has made. <br />In my opinion she captured the film. Her portrayal of the \\"Boss\\" was a male counter part extraordinaire. <br />As mentioned in the film. If she were a male she would be brilliant not a nasty woman.  <br />Being a 30 year product of the \\"Corporate Jungle\\" and totally relating to her interpretation of the epitome of the power boss. <br />The other characters were perfect in their roles as will.   <br />Not really a collection of DVD's when I saw this film in the theater I had to have the DVD. Excellent film! <br />

B000062XGD|2.0|This was an excellent movie. I had seen it before & will watch it again & again.
B00008DDRX|5.0|There is that tendency to compare this picture with the James Garner Formula One epic \\"Grand Prix\\"; forget it, there is no comparison. \\"LeMans\\" is far better.  Where the F1 movie delves into soap opera and loses its focus, the McQueen movie stays close to its subject matter.  But \\"LeMans\\" is not without its human drama.  There's an ineresting relationship between McQueen's character Michael Delaney and Elga Andersen's Lisa Belgetti, whose husband was killed the previous year in an accident that involved Delaney - who she holds responsible.  A truly believable scenario; the Garner movie doesn't have any.
B000H5U832|5.0|This is a GREAT movie.  I don't usually like animated movies, but this is wonderful.  Everyone in our family likes it and have watched it many times since we got it.  I would recommend it to anyone who wants a good family movie.

1591396190|5.0|If I had a buck for every CEO who recommended Sun Tzu's Art of War...  I'd have free lattes for a week.   Blue Ocean Strategy is far more useful, and a refreshing change from those military tomes.  The authors do an excellent job of boiling competitive strategy down to pure essence -- and prove that outmaneuvering your opponents may be a matter of paring down, rather than staffing up.   Could it be that today's generation of CEOs never served in the military, and feel they need to compensate by endlessly quoting war stories?    <br />Why not get down to business strategy?  That's what this is all about, after all.

B00068NVI4|4.0|This is a great double DVD of Yes performing live in 2004.  The stage was definitely designed from a larger budget and represented the fantasy that Roger Dean created as the artist that reflects all that you know about Yes and their album covers and all the artwork associated with Yes.<br /><br />Jon Anderson, Chris Squire, Alan White, Steve Howe, and Rick Wakeman are all here performing at their very best.  I'm not too familiar with several of these songs on this performance but that's okay because I've already got much of my favorite performances from them on the \\"Keys to Ascension\\" DVD.  And there is a much better interaction with the audience on this performance.  You know, it's funny.  Sometimes, Jon Anderson sounds like Bjork.<br /><br />The best thing about this DVD is the quality.  This performance was filmed in High Definition.  Widescreen and 5.1 Surround Sound.  This is probably the last big-budget performance that you will ever see from Yes.<br /><br />But, of course, I could be wrong.  Some groups do have an amazing way of staying alive.  Emerson, Lake, and Palmer, and The Moody Blues seem to continue to perform and they are up there in their years too.  It all remains to be seen.

6304711891|3.0|This is probably Michael Bay's second best film, behind the original 'Bad Boys' (the sequel to which is surely one of the very worst pieces of \\"cinema\\" I've ever had the displeasure of seeing). The reason 'The Rock' falls behind his debut is obvious: Bay can't, to my mind, produce any sort of convincing dramatic effect; what little emotion the movie does evoke comes courtesy of the outstanding cast -- primarily Cage, Connery, and (by far the most of the bunch) Ed Harris. 'Bad Boys', on the other hand, was much more suited to Bay's ludicrous, a.d.h.d mentality; it was bogus, but never strove to be anything more -- and it was fun, and funny.  <br /> <br />The concept of 'The Rock' is intriguing and unique, but the problem that reveals itself fairly quickly is that Bay uses it as a catalyst to throw in action scenes around every corner. I personally don't have a problem so much with the sequences themselves being ridiculous. The car chase scene, for example, in which Cage just happens to handle a ferarri (or lamborghini -- not really sure) like a professional driver of whatever sort, making his way through a circus-esque obstacle course of insane proportions, is beyond unrealistic. But hey, Bay's sense of speed and excitement, alongside Hans Zimmers' adrenalized score, provide for good, stupid fun. It's that, following this scene, the action just does not stop, and it's usually far less creative and ambitious. It's just quarrel after quarrel, gun fight after gun fight, and though Bay employs neat tricks here and there that make him a unique director, most of it ends up becoming monotonous and stale.  <br /> <br />I don't even know if the film deserves three stars, because it's so hokey and implausible, but, it must be said, 'The Rock' was one of my very favorite movies back in high-school. Bay was also one of my favorite directors at that point, in contrast to my general spite towards the man at the current place in time -- times have changed; it doesn't help that every film proceeding 'The Rock' has been fairly atrocious, either. But the fact remains the man has incredible talent at establishing a particular visual mood and is able to conduct a sequence of shots that provide a rousing, flashy response. The final standoff in the film, as well as the climactic scene of Cage injecting the holy needle into his heart as jets prepare to blow-up the island, is, in its own way, exhillirating and awesomely impressive. But you know what? 'Armageddon' has sequences as such laced with brilliance too, but in the end it doesn't matter much when the overall film is such a turd. 'The Rock' isn't a turd, but it's not one of the greater action flicks out there -- not by a long shot. To my 14 year old self it might be, but to my more evolved, rational brain, it ain't I'm afraid.
B000001FO4|4.0|After selling millions with their debut album, Night Songs, Cinderella released Long Cold Winter in 1988. While most bands would have attempted to continue their success by making a similar sounding album, Cinderella took the road less traveled and expanded their musical horizons. Some of the catchy riffs that carried Night Songs remained in the mix. However, Long Cold Winter boasted more melodic material featuring piano, acoustic guitars, and a Hammond B3 adding color. As a result, the band were able to continue their success and receive a lot more airplay as Long Cold Winter boasted 4 hit singles, three of which hit the Billboard Top 40.<br /><br />The album opens with \\"Bad Seamstress Blues/Fallin' Apart at the Seams\\", a great tune about life on the road. \\"Gypsy Road\\" has a great riff and an even better chorus and would become one of the band's most popular songs. The title track saw the band jump headfirst into the electric blues and both Tom Keifer's guitar solo and vocal performance here are outstanding.  The more melodic tracks truly shine and would ultimately give them their greatest success. \\"Coming Home\\" and \\"The Last Mile\\" are great songs boasting strong harmonies and melodies and would both be big hits. The piano ballad \\"Don't Know What You Got (Till It's Gone)\\" would become their biggest hit single and would be featured on many `80s power ballad compilation discs like Monster Ballads. The album closing \\"Take Me Back\\" is another strong track that combines hard rock with a sense of melody. The remaining tracks are all riff rockers with \\"Second Wind\\" being one of their best heavy tracks while \\"Fire and Ice\\" and the Zeppelinesque \\"If You Don't Like It\\" are decent at best. All told, Long Cold Winter showed that Cinderella weren't just another hair metal band and their next release, Heartbreak Station, would separate them even further from the pack.
B000ICL3KG|5.0|I was expecting a \\"slideshow\\" but this is so much more! Gore is very engaging and passionate in his delivery of this essential information. I too am a Tennessean, and relate to the return to the riverside - \\"Oh yes... I had forgotten about this...\\"  I think many average Americans in the quest for more and better have lost track of what is real. I see housewifes driving Hummers to the grocery store on perfectly paved roads. Hear people gripe about the high cost of gasoline (a non-renewable resource and source of greenhouse gas when consumed) as if cheap energy is a birthright. So many spoiled brats!  I ordered several more to give to others who desperately need to see this. Bravo Al Gore!
B000HWZ61Y|5.0|This CD contains the songs that made this era of Def Leppard truely great. The only thing that I would have liked included would have be the electric version of \\"Miss you In A Heartbeat.\\" It was a B side on one of the singles (off the top of my head I am forget which one). I suspect that it was not included because Miss You In A Heartbeat was a song on Retroactive but it was the accoustic version. Unfortuately, this was my favorite B side and it is not on this CD. Other than that, this collection is awesome. I now have a lot of extended versions of songs that I only ever saw/heard on MTV or live in concert. I wish the band would go back to making songs like this. Enjoy the memories.

0393327655|5.0|I found the book very provocative.  It explores the different faiths and how some of the beliefs formulated centuries ago are no longer relevant to the modern ways of viewing the world.  ie. virgin births.  In addition, many of the current religious beliefs are destructive. ie. the notion of \\"honor killings\\" by the father of a daughter who is raped to restore the family honor.  No religion is spared the authors scrutiny.  I found many ideas helpful.  For example, the author defines love as enhancing the happiness and sharing suffering of another person.  I highly recommend the book because it stimulated me to examine my own faith in a more rational way.
B000K7VHQE|1.0|I can't believe I sat thru the whole movie waiting for something to happen.  If you saw National Lampoon's Vacation with Chevy Chase taking his family in a car to the WalleyWorld theme park, then you've seen this movie, except Vacation was better.
B000JK8OYU|5.0|Being a Beatles fan all my life, I must admit that the sound quality of this CD is amazing. It makes you wonder why not all Beatles material is reissued in the same manner and I do not mean in the way of a collage, but the original songs. We are lucky that all master tapes have survived and that it is still possible to do so. I think that George Martin and Son and the record company owe it to the public and the two surviving Beatles to re release all songs and albums as soon as possible.
B000ICL3KG|3.0|I tend to agree with much of the Democratic platform.  That should have absolutely nothing to do with a movie about climate change.  Such change either is or is not happening, is or is not due to man, and can or can not be remedied by man's action.<br /><br />The man of action in this film is Gore.  We get to see him listening to phone conversations about some climatic miscreant - all the while hunt-and-peck typing on a laptop.  We get to see Al Gore walking alone(!!) through a darkened airport, on his way to proselytyze the dangers of Global Warming.  We get to see Gore reminiscing about his family farm and his bid for the Presidency.<br /><br />Along the way, we also get to see some fantastic science about global warming - its causes and implications.<br /><br />If there were more science and less Gore, it would do *FAR* more to improve Gore's credibility.  A clear focus on the issue at hand would have left people to draw their own conclusions about his integrety, focus and strength of character.<br /><br />For the movie to include so many vignets which focus on this being Gore's Crusade is unfortunate and distracting (regardless of whether one likes the fellow or not).<br /><br />For the science, I give it five stars.  For the wake-up call, four.  Because it's too personal and partisan, I have to give it three.<br /><br />For a fantastic treatment of global warming and other environmental problems, see Thomas Homer Dixon's book, \\"The Upside of Down\\".

B000ICL3KG|5.0|Al Gore shows through clear and indisputable scientific evidence that our world is in emminent danger due to global warning.  The manner in which Mr. Gore presents his facts is rivoting and, at times, humorous, but undoubtedly, leaves his audience terrified of what lies ahead for us in the future.  If we do not alter our current lifestyles our planet and all that lives on will be doomed.
0394800192|5.0|This book is unbelievably good for early readers. My son started reading right after he turned 4. The book is written using about 85 basic words that all kids need to learn (sight words). Once they know these words they can read a lot of other books. The value in Ten Apples is NOT the illustrations, counting or the story. Put simply, it is a wonderful tool to get your child reading. My son (4 yrs and 3 months) can read this book to himself easily. Those 85 words help him read all other books that he wants to. Those looking for a good book to practice sight words must buy this book.

B000JK8OYU|5.0|An excellent compilation and remixing of the Beatle's canon. Fresh takes on still-fresh compositions. No group has ever approached the consistently high standards of The Boys, except for perhaps George Martin himself, who's input and taste underpin this collection. A must-have for the Beatles fan of any age or degree of devotion. It's, uh, Fab!
0743298020|4.0|Avid readers across the globe will truly *love* to feast their eyes on this novel by Diane Setterfield. Why? Because it's one of the most descriptive novels I've ever laid my hands on, and thats saying something!<br /><br />\\"The Thirteenth Tale\\" follows the story of Margaret Lea, who is a shy, soft spoken woman who works in her father's book shop, and posesses a voracious love of books, reading, and words. Margarent is shocked to learn that Vida Winters, a much acclaimed novelist who is notorious for feeding a different life story to every journalist who interviews her, wants Margaret to pen her *real* autobiography! Nobody knows the real life story of Vida Winters! However, Ms. Winters has grown very old and sick, and has very little time left. She wants the truth to be told before she passes. It's almost too much for Margaret to consider, but she soon changes her mind as she quickly becomes deeply engrossed in Ms. Winter's tale. Will Vida Winter's final life story be proved true? Or will she have the last laugh in bestowing one final tall tale to Margaret?<br /><br />This novel is so rich with language and imagery, I almost can't find the words to describe it! If you enjoy a lot of characterization, then this is the book for you. It captivates you from the very first chapter, and holds you until the very end. With the unveiling of each portion of Vida Winter's story, you are left dying to find out what happens next.<br /><br />As she begins to tell Margaret her story, Vida Winters insists on the importance of stories having a beginning, a middle, and an end. Since Margaret *insisted* on having some measurable form of proof, in terms of cold hard facts, that the story Ms. Winters is telling her is the absolute truth, Vida Winters had to tease us with a small portion of the end. Afterwhich, the story progresses through the natural stages of beginning, middle, and end. As Vida Winters points out...this might be what makes the novel so hard to put down!<br /><br />Bottom line, it's an enthralling read, and a beautiful story. You won't be disappointed.<br />Bottom line, it's an enthralling read, and a beautiful story. You won't be disappointed.

B000K7VHQ4|5.0|Can you see beyond the illusion? This film aspires to dazzle it's audience with astute observations on the concept of life, love, and death, while at the same time dazzling with it's special effects and imagery. All I can say is...it succeeded!<br /><br />\\"The Illusionist\\" is truly a fantastic film. Edward Norton is astounding as Eisenheim, a self-taught illusionist who, as a child, fell in love with a girl who was of noble birth, while he was nothing but the son of a carpenter. Their love lasted many years of separation, and was re-ignited upon their chance encounter during one of his performances in Venice. However, Eisenheim's chosen vocation of \\"illusionist\\" comes under fire from the crown prince of the empire (his true love's betrothed). Can they escape the crown Prince's grasp...or will tragedy strike the young couple?<br /><br />One of my favorite things about this film was it's ability to provide the audience with real life truths in a manner that provokes the critical thinking thought process. What is the meaning of life? Does it matter what our station in life is? Does love conquer all? Is the law always on the side of good? Can we overcome such obstacles as death...when we perservere enough? These are all questions this film addresses, in one way or another, and it really makes you *think* about, and even debate questions such as these.<br /><br />If for nothing else, watch this film for it's beautifully executed scenes during Eisenheim's \\"illusions\\". They are always mesmerizing, and the various insights and lessons he explores with them strike very close to home and the general nature of humanity. The love story that is mixed in with plot is captivating, and other hopeless romantics like myself will really enjoy it.<br /><br />Bottom line, incredible performances, a captivating story, and beautiful cinematography and special effects. Well worth the purchase!
B000GPIPSS|5.0|As much as I love the Bela Lugosi version, I found the Spanish version just as entertaining.  The interesting thing about this is I don't speak Spanish, but watching the Bela Lugosi version, and then the Spanish, I understood what was being said.
B000003S09|5.0|When people talk about the roots of progressive rock, this album is usually one of the main contenders. Listening to this album now, I can honestly say I enjoy other King Crimson albums more, and other progressive rock albums for that matter. But the fact that this album was created in the late 60's, experimenting with the now classic styles of progressive rock, and while other giants in the genre were just getting started, makes this a monumental and definitive album.<br /><br />The original line-up of Robert Fripp(guitar), Greg Lake (bass, vocals), Ian McDonald (keyboard, synths), Michael Giles (drums), and Peter Sinfield (lyrics) was a short-lived one, but one that created their best album until the legendary power trio (Fripp, Wetton and Brufford) stunned the progressive scene in 74 with \\"Red\\". Coincidentally this album starts in a similar vein to \\"Red\\", with the frenetic \\"21st Century Schizoid Man\\" setting the album off with a fast and powerful start. The song combines some harsh vocals and a timeless, classic Fripp riff to kick things off. This is ensued by a stunning and overtly technical jazz-fusion middle section, which leads back to the main motif and riff. It is an outstanding opener, and the most fluid, immediate song KC would make for years.<br /><br />The rest of the album is significantly more relaxed, creating a heavy vibe of sadness and melancholy. This is probably best shown with the classic ballad \\"Epitaph\\", a superb and lush outing that is both texturally beautiful and thematically unsettling. This is due to the profound and touching lyrics dealing with the ease and excess of misguidance and ignorance, sung with great passion and a deal of desperation from Lake. Musically the song has a heavy dosage of strings and dramatic timpani rolls to build up a brooding piece.<br /><br />\\"I Talk To The Wind\\", which comes in before \\"Epitaph\\", is a very calming piece, slowly washing over with some gentle flute playing, vocal harmonies and some splashy ride cymbals, it is a nice song, and acts as a good contrast to the album's opening flurry. \\"Moonchild\\" seems a little pointless to me, and the only weak song. It starts decent enough, and feels like it will continue in the same vein as the two pervious ballads. But then Fripp and the gang seem to want to push the idea of the music being experimental, of a higher `art', as they experiment with various instruments for a good twelve minutes. It is essentially `noodling', and makes for a rather dull and unmemorable song.<br /><br />After the only weak song, the album closes in fine style with the dreamy, ethereal choruses of the title track. This song has always been one of my favourite KC tracks. It really is a masterpiece of a ballad, combining quiet and understated verses with big, lush choruses, packed with strings and eerie vocal harmonies that send shivers down my spine. A perfect ending to one of rocks most influential and important albums.y ride cymbals, it is a nice song, and acts as a good contrast to the album's opening flurry. \\"Moonchild\\" seems a little pointless to me, and the only weak song.

Reading this book was in and of itself a bool hunt, and each chapter a station of the bool.  And the reward at the end of the bool hunt?  Why, it's the beauty of the book itself and the amazing experience of having read it.  Every time I picked up the book I felt as if I had been transported to Boo'ya Moon.  It is no exaggeration that this book has affected me like no other, written by Stephen King or otherwise.  Its magic has lingered long after finishing it (which sadly I had to do).
B000AGTPUU|5.0|Nice Item of course it was new.  Shipping was speedy especially around the holidays.
B000HEWEJO|5.0|My girlfriend has seen this movie a hundred times and wanted me to find the color version on DVD. I guess they don't make it yet, and I got this for her instead. She loves it and says the picture is the best clarity she has ever seen.
B00000K3CM|3.0|It was intertaining to some degree. I enjoyed it mostly for the Christmas scenery.
0060776757|5.0|This book became an incredibly well-received gift.  Both my son and son-in-law were thrilled with it.  It was the hit of Christmas!  I recommend it to anyone who is a fan or would-be fan.
B00005JP9V|5.0|Contrary to what some moviegoers have said about Children of Men, the film is NOT an anti-abortion opinion editorial. The movie is about violence and the heavy toll our violent nature has wrought on our civilization. If we insist on killing and warfare, then exactly what is the point of us women having children, bringing them into a world that is not ready to accept their right to exist in peace? That's the underlying question of the movie. <br /> <br />Every woman in a position to have children asks herself, or should, if it's the right thing to do and if this world is a terrible place to bring a child into, or do the good and beautiful things outweigh human tragedy and atrocities? What if we women decided to go on strike? Would that change the men in power? <br /> <br />Children of Men is a moving and powerful movie about how we treat each other in the here and now and about the role that violence plays in our life path on this planet. Its vision of the future is bleak and its depiction of violence, uncompromising, but it is definitely worth seeing because of its look at our values and hypocritical behavior.  <br /> <br /> <br />NY Times review of the book The Children of Men by P.D. James: <br />[...] <br /> <br />[...] <br /> <br />Interview with director and principals: <br />[...] <br />
B000009F3Z|4.0|Is a very good album.This was the second dark tranquility album that I have purchased. If you like other Swedish death bands, like early In Flames albums, you will enjoy this cd. Their original work on this cd is great and includes a good mix of both melodic-metal and tranquil guitar parts.I cannot vouch however the covers that were at the end of the cd, that is why I gave it a 4/5. Otherwise a good buy.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|It is exactly what my college-age son wanted.  Says it is the best TV series of its' genre.
0920668372|5.0|Definitely a collectors item! This book will bring a tear to a mother's eye! I recommend for ages newborn to 80!
B0009UC7H0|5.0|wife made me buy it. i am not sorry i did. very funny and could watch it over again......
B0000024TT|5.0|I finally bought a cd of Mr Cohen's after reading that <br />Bob Seger was listening to his latest. It is excellent with <br />superior lyrics with great melody and presentation. He is frequently <br />compared to Bobby Dylan, with some truth, however his songs sometimes  <br />have too much in common- a more diverse tempo would help- such as <br />from Dylan where \\" the times are always changing\\". <br /> <br />I think I read he is coming out with a new book of poetry, <br />possibly to be part of the Spoleto festival in Charleston.
B000HKCRW2|5.0|This CD is a total blast!! These guys are way hip and as a New Yorker, I can totally understand why The Rapture infuse every musical style into their sound......in New York one is bombarded by sounds of every genre and culture on a daily basis. Naturally, bands from New York City are hard to categorize.<br /><br />\\"Pieces of the People We Love\\" blends punk rock, 70's disco, 70's funk, electronica, psychedelic rock, and vocal harmonies into one mind-bending and hooky sound. It's absolutely awesome. There's one or two tracks that I don't really like, but the majority of the album is simply KILLER!!<br /><br />On one hand, I dig that The Rapture are indie, lurking just underground from the mainstream where us indie fans can enjoy them for ourselves, yet on the other hand The Rapture are so damn good that you wish them superstardom. For now, I'll just listen to this classic over and over with pleasure!
B00000FCBC|5.0|My son has the entire Metallica collection except for the one I purchased. <br />We were having a hard time finding it in the stores.  I was very pleased with the quick service, but believe me, he was a lot happier than I was!
B000J103PC|5.0|\\"The Devil Wears Prada\\" is the familiar story of the innocent in the jungle (business, Wall Street, journalism, fashion,etc.) who achieves success but realizes true values lie elsewhere. Anne Hathaway plays the unstylish, clumsy Andrea who improbably lands a job with Miranda Priestly, played brilliantly by Meryl Streep. Andrea fixes herself up and is smart enough to figure out what Miranda wants, and she finds herself promoted over the senior assistant. In the process, however, Andrea loses boyfriend and friends, as the job becomes all-consuming. In the end, Andrea gives it all up for a \\"real\\" job in journalism, and wins her long-suffering man back. <br /> <br />The real star here is Streep, who plays Miranda with icy coldness, except for one breathaking scene where she finds out that her husband wants a divorce. The other star is the clothes--sexy, frivolous, sleek and stylish--Hathaway looks great after her makeover. The story is predictable, but no matter--it's totally enjoyable.
1881273377|5.0|My husband and I loved this book when we read it. We got the cd to listen to once every several months to review while on long trips in the car. Gary Chapman is wonderful.
0060007737|4.0|This is a great short primer on branding and some of the critical mistakes to avoid. On first blush some of the laws seem counter intuitive, but the authors provide fabulous real world examples to prove their point. Also provides a bonus section on Internet branding, which is an entirely different animal. A must read for any small company delving into branding for the first time!
B000JU7NCE|5.0|I would actually rate this about a 4.5 due to the video quality.  Some of the camera shots are not great and the skipping around can be a little annoying sometimes.  Some of the cameras are operated by people in the audience and you can tell which ones pretty easy.  It is a nice idea that just did not cut it...... <br /> <br />Overall the music is great and with Porl rejoining his mates, it makes it a kind of homecomming.  No complaints at all on the main part of the show.   <br /> <br />The music is awesome and Smith sounds as good as ever.  I loved the whole set.  This is not as good as Trilogy, but ranks up there with Live in Orange.
B00005JO9J|5.0|Received it quickly..packed well...in mint condition. Given as a Christmas gift and the recipient was very happy with the DVD.
B00008PX8P|5.0|I purchased this as a gift for my son.  He is a musician and a huge Led Zeppelin fan. In his words \\" this dvd is a must for anyone who calls themselves a Zeppelin fan. The footage is spectacular the sound is incredible. The chronology of the footage, showing the band from the start to finish is overwhelming. Led Zeppelin has a power,mystery, and strength that was captured on film. For those of us who were never able to see this band live, now is your chance BUY THIS DVD!!!! You will not be disappointed.\\"
B000J103OI|5.0|I first saw this DVD under duress: A friend insisted we watch it. I had preconceived notions: Meryl Streep will overplay her character. Anne Hathaway will be too cute. I'll be bored, bored, bored. WRONG!!!<br /><br />Meryl Streep is totally hilarious as the over-the-top boss from hell, Miranda Priestly. Anne Hathaway IS cute, but in a well-acted, believable way that makes you want to hug her. It was a pleasure to see Stanley Tucci chew up the scenery, and the fashions, to me, make the movie.<br /><br />So now I'm ordering this DVD, thrilled to have it. It's the type of movie you can watch with your girlfriends (and the occasional \\"sure-of-his-masculinity male\\") while it snows outside and you eat all the popcorn and ice cream you promised not to touch.<br /><br />Great casting, great editing, terrific shots of New York, Paris, runways and the lot. A winner.
B000ICL3KG|5.0|This is a much needed film. Everyone should see it and share it with their friends and family. But, beware, the film maker takes a few unwelcome turns at politics in this film that are unneeded, unwelcome, and distracting to the essential and important message contained withint the rest of the presentation. However, it is still well worth buying and spreading around. <br /> <br />Buy this movie. Get informed.
032147404X|5.0|If you arew looking for a book to give you \\"step by step instructions\\", then this is NOT the book for you ... But if you are looking for the best tips on taking pictures under certain circumstances, what equipement you should have to get the best photo...and how to set up for a particuliar shot..then this is the book for YOU !This is a book for every semi pro. I love It !!!
B000068OSK|5.0|Early, unpolished, and hinting at the style they'll develop.  The lyrics are interesting, and uncommon.  It reminds me of early gritty \\"classic rock\\", back when its roots were firmly in the Blues.
B000H7JD4K|4.0|Absoulty a return to form for the metal legends. Bruce is excellent on the vocals, Adrian , Gers, and Dave lay down some of the best riffs since possibly seventh son. and what can u say bout niko and steve best low end section in hard rock. Highly recommend this cd a concept presented flawlessly.
B000HT386M|3.0|Sandler does give a great performance,and could get a Oscar for \\"Click,\\"but this DVD is boring .
B000002J2D|5.0|I can't say more then I wrote in title. It must all Genesis fun and if somebody getting acquainted with Genesis, I suggest as the first album.
B000ICL3KG|5.0|One of the most important things that we can do for Global Warming is to educate ourselves and make changes within our own households.  This movie is profound in that it gives scientific data in a way that is easy to understand for all people.  Please watch this film and share it with all of your friends and family.  The only way that we can preserve our planet is to stop waiting for politicians and big business to do the RIGHT THING and do it ourselves!
B0006J28KU|5.0|you get bowled over by the explosive chemistry on screen between two of hollywood's greatest Al-Pacino and Robert De Niro. Though \\"Heat\\" contains a familiar \\"cops and robbers story\\", it is the treatment which Michael Mann lends to it makes it so different. The taut screen play and livewire cinematography, the adrenalin pumping chase sequences, the clinking of bullets when they fall on the pavement of the cities all captured and delivered in a two DVD pack. the first DVD contains the movie with options for us to view it with subtitles or without, french or english, or jump directly to scenes. The second DVD contains the history of its making. If your choice for a sunday is action packed drama with some  quality time with pacino and de niro, then \\"Brother, better buy this\\".
B000K7VHQE|5.0|Ok, I used to be an avid movie goers...then fatherhood has led me down the kid movie path.  I live in a fairly hip artist community in which movies are a basic conversation.<br /><br />colleague:  What did you think of Babel?<br /><br />Me:  Probably didn\\"t hold a candle to \\"Happy Feet\\".<br /><br />and also the hype of something turns me off....imagine my surprise at our chance to see a film everyone told me I would love and then actually love it.<br /><br />Ok, this movie really did it for me.  Amazing cast, great premise.  And I thought the end sustained the rest of the movie.<br /><br />The movie is about believing in yourself, and going forward.  Yes, there are similarities to oother films, but it is absolutely wonderful.  Funny, touching, heartbreaking and character driven.<br /><br />It is quirky, but totally creative in it\\"s own world.<br /><br />Alan Arkin is a national treasure, Carell and Kinnear do great serious work, Collette is always amazing, and Breslin anchors the piece.  The one you don\\"t hear about is Paul Dano.  I loved his work in a rather unlikeable first two acts.  He really is great.<br /><br />Check this movie out...even if everyone tells you to see it.
B00005N6KG|4.0|comfortable, portable, very good sound, a fine product, especially for the price. if you want a 5 star headset you will pay a lot more.
B000FIMG68|5.0|Having a schedule where I work odd hours, I don't always have a chance to keep up with my favorite shows or have an opportunity to set the VCR, and I don't have Tivo. The DVD set of Lost is fantastic - it gives me the opportunity to catch up with the show and go back to pick up any nuances I may have missed. The only bad part is how addictive the show is - be careful, you could find yourself sitting down to \\"just watch one\\" and suddenly find yourself still up at 4am telling yourself \\"just one more!\\"
B000002LR6|5.0|This is one of those albums where all the songs are good. <br /> <br />Although this was released in 1992, it is like Metallica's \\"Kill 'Em All\\":  Cutting edge music that stands the test of time.  You will never get tired of listening to this music. <br /> <br />If Pink Floyd switched to making industrial music, this is the first album they would make.  If you like old school industrial, you will love these songs.  If you like sardonic, sarcastic lyrics, you will love these songs.
0307237699|5.0|The book is inspiring. It represents the most common sense and realistic approach to addressing the nation's problems. If put into practice, the extreme partisan diviseiveness would thankfully disappear or, at least, be dramatically reduced. If Mr. Obama would apply his message in the book, he deserves to be elected to higher office.
B000HEWEJO|5.0|I have always loved this movie and now I can see it over and over again without any interuptions! <br /> <br />This is what watching movies is all about!
074356619X|5.0|The movie was an inspiration to me and to my friends who watched it with me.  Anyone who wants more from life should watch this movie and then put its philosophy to work.
0743442539|5.0|If you think working as a spy means flirting with the receptionist before popping in to see the head of the secret service and then dropping down to the basement to pick up the gadgets you will need for your mission, this book will help give you a reality check. <br /> <br />The British need a mole in East Germany so they pretend to fire one of their top agents by faking a problem with alcohol.  The former spy gets a job in a bookstore.  He works beside a young woman who just happens to be a low-level member of the Socialist party.  He befriends her, and while she falls in love with him, he uses her to get inside the apparatus in East Germany.  While you read the rest of the story, you get that dirt-in-your teeth feeling, like you might have after a very rough outdoor contact sport.  You also find out that a spy agency cannot afford to be compassionate. <br /> <br />If you really want to know the sacrifices made by the brave men and women who work for our intelligence agencies, this book will give you a pretty good taste.  However, it may be a taste that lingers long after you have put the book down.
B000H5U832|5.0|Great movie not only for kids but Adults! Gave away as Christmas prsents. Must have for your DVD collection
0060254920|5.0|This book has been a favorite of both my children and grandchildren.  We love to roar our terrible roar,gnash our terrible teeth, roll our terrible eyes, and show our terrible claws.  A wonderful book to read with your child.
0312323867|5.0|I really enjoyed Something Borrowed but this book definitely took the cake.  It is a continuation and recap of the first book, this time taking on the point of view of Darcy, Rachel's best friend.  In the beginning, Darcy has such hate and resentment for both Rachel and Dex that she literally cannot even think straight.  She wants to make them both jealous and miserable by taking her relationship with Ethan even further with the father of her unborn child and groomsman from her wedding.  As she becomes more obsessed with Rachel and Dex's relationship and betrayal to her, she becomes more neurotic, pushing her new relationship to break.   <br /> <br />After reaching her breaking point with her family, her man, her new \\"best friend\\" and basically herself, Darcy decides to visit her and Rachel's childhood friend, Ethan, in London.  This is where she makes her huge turnaround and literally surprises the reader with what she's capable of and how she turns her life and outlook around. <br />
B0002F6AH0|5.0|This series was the best ever made on the second world war.  It remains the best to this day.  The photography and commentary are top notch even by today's higher video quality standards.  A must have for the second world war historian.
B0008JIJ2E|5.0|This was a gift for a grandson.  He is happy with the movie as I thought he would be.  He was told that his grandmother and I had seen the movie on TV and liked the characters, actors and the story.
B000ATQYT2|5.0|This was my vavorite Christmas movie from childhood!  Jim Henson's muppets are amazing!  Look closely through the movie and you will see characters from many of his shows!  This movie is interesting and believeable, with heart and a funny delivery.  I highly recommend it!
0788821075|5.0|It was shipped quickly and I recieved it promptly. I am very pleased.
B00003CXRM|5.0|This film is destined to be one that stays with you long after the credits role.  The acting, the music, the wicked humor...tops all the way.
B00004TH83|5.0|First time is OK,  2nd time is \\"very nice\\", and the 3rd time is \\"fall in love\\".   This CD really have many beautiful ones.  When I say beautiful, it is from \\"inside\\", of course they sound great too.  More from Lara on order...
B000006TIY|5.0|Actually I didn't recieve the purchased item so far. <br /> <br />It is now more one month since I paid the money and yet I didn't get my money's worth. <br /> <br />Please consider this review as a complaint.
6302881005|1.0|There was a mix-up in shipping time and it took longer than expexted. The communication from seller was pretty much non-existant but Amazon did a great job in handling the situation. And, I want to thank Amazon.com for all the help!
B000A6T262|5.0|It's wonderful to get all of the movies in one boxed set. The movies are clear and look great. I got it when it was on sale, so I spent about $75 on it, so it was an amazing deal.
B0002S94OS|5.0|This is by far the best LoG album to date. LoG CDs are hard to come by here in my country because it was never released here. I was introduced to this band by listening to the immortal \\"Black Label\\". I've been a fan eversince. The overall musicianship has improved compared to their previous albums. The Vocals are more clear and brutal and showcased Randy Blythe's Vocal Range. This should be the standard for ALL METAL ALBUMS! LoG Kicks A**!!!
B00005AREQ|5.0|For sheer listening pleasure, if you are into jazz, blues and rock and roll, you cannot do much better than to slap this on your turntable and sit back and listen to Beck groove on tune after tune.  The whole album is innovative, crisp, with outstanding musicianship.  Beck is one of the great guitarists in the business.  Give this a listen.  It will be an instant favorite.  All instrumental, with great licks, super percussion, and excellent mixing, (plus production by the Beatles' producer George Martin)  this is the real deal. If Miles Davis had been a guitarist, this is what he might have done.<br /><br />Five stars.
0307276902|5.0|This book helped me in so many ways. I thought the book was raw and painful. Anyone who reads this book knows someone like James.Today ,in this world we see so many people lost to drugs,a brother,a mother,a father. In this book it shows that EVERYBODY needs somebody in our lives to help us make a change.Great book to read.
0060254920|5.0|This is a favorite book for my 3 1/2 year old son and my husband.  It's a classic.  Will be loved for a long time.
B000I0QL82|5.0|Despite being in black and white, this movie contains some of the best song and dance routines ever!  The characters are believable, the plot very classic, and the music superb.  But the dancing is what makes this most enjoyable.  Even Der Bingle did a great job!
B000IZJZLM|4.0|Thanks for the efficient delivery of the CD, as usual.  The music is outstanding, magnificent voices.  A little more classical than my usual tasts, but I am enjoying the change of pace.
B00003CY6M|5.0|John Cusack is a wonderful actor... giving a wonderful performance as always.   There are no accidents in life... so should you find yourself in such a situation as he does in Serendipity... follow your heart... and you won't ever go wrong.
B0007GAEGC|5.0|One of the best CD's of all time. Chloe has such an angelic voice! The harmonies are so tight, they remind you of family harmony. Mesmorizing melodies and sounds!
1582701709|5.0|I recommed this book, is highly inspirational and you will find it a good source of motivation. It is also on the same level as other metaphysical books, I would say if you are lost or don't know exactly how to put your life into a feel good - will do mode, get this book! is easy to read.  I recommeded it.
B000IU3Y1O|5.0|This is a great value for getting a cd and a dvd. A ton of music video's on the dvd. My nephew loved this gift for Christmas.
B000EULJLU|4.0|I think the most importnat thing to do when listening to this album is not to compare it with Lateralus. Stop right there. Take a breath, sit back, and listen again without that expectation. The fact is that nothing can or ever will top Lateralus be it by Tool's own hand or someone else's. I do, however, think this album could have been improved upon in 2 places: Fist off, Lateralus was such a huge pinnacle for this band they needed to create an album that summed up their career thus far. I'm not implying that it should have meant to sound like the last pieces of music we hear from these guys, but they needed to come a little more full cirlce with their sound. It has been a hugely immense journey for Tool and cramming that much into, what is it, 12 songs? is not feesable. I think that had they come out with a double disk, the sound could have been much more complete. Secondly, if the songs are rearranged slightly the album works better. Try listening to Wings I and II last and put Rosetta Stoned closer to the beginning and Vicarious somewhere in the middle. I dunno, whatever works for you I guess. I found myself a lot more satisfied when I switched things up a bit though. Bottom line, listen. Just listen. Whatever your premonitions are, screw them and listen. There's so much more there than what you may be skimming over. And most importnatly, enjoy the privlage of listening to something that has such wonderful wholeness and beauty as Tool's music. It's better than whatever the hell else is playing on the radio.
B0000E1WKE|4.0|Even though it is not Whitney's best, I still thought it was great!  I bought my Mom one also, and she enjoyed it too.  I read several other reviews and I do not agree with the negativity.  I truly do hope Whitney will come back better than ever.
0618680004|5.0|Richard Dawkins can read my mind. That's the only explanation I find possible, because as I was reading \\"The G-d Delusion\\" I kept exclaiming to myself, \\"That's just what I always thought!\\" Except his language is more elegant than mine. Although, not always so elegant; his writing is accessible, engaging and clever, and some of his footnotes are LOL (Laugh Out Loud) funny.  <br /> <br />[I Don't Know Why: Because of my religious upbringing, in this review I personally write the name \\"G-d\\"; observant Jews avoid writing the name casually because of the risk that the written name might later be defaced.] <br />  <br />Who's Got the Whole World in his Hands: Dawkins, a respected biologist/philosopher, takes his reputation as Charles Darwin's fiercest supporter and asks how a scientist, or any educated adult, can possible believe in religion (the monotheist ones; he gives Buddhism and Confucianism a pass as \\"ethical systems or \\"philosophies of life\\"). I know I should feel insulted when he calls my G-d, the one I grew up believing in, the G-d of the Hebrew Bible, a \\"psychotic delinquent,\\" (p. 38), but I like to keep an open mind. I was raised by parents who were themselves raised as Orthodox Jews, but as a family we slipped to Conservative Judaism; then I fell backward into Reform for a few years. I've flirted with the Reconstructionists, as well. I believe in Judaism as a culture, but find it hard to believe in the religion. Right now I'm a Jewish-born Questioner, but as a Questioner, for absolutely no reason, I still don't eat pork.  <br /> <br />Teach Your Children Well: Dawkins was born an Anglican child, but rightly points out that a child isn't really a member of a religion, but basically a small human mimicking the words, prayers, and beliefs that were taught by his/her parents, who were obviously taught those words, prayers, and beliefs by their own parents. So the game goes on, and for thousands of years the collected weight of all of those maters and paters impress on the child, leaving him too laden by layers of guilt to make a conscious decision to question his faith. Every religion seems to have the same principle: pile on the guilt, until the child-turned-adult is paralyzed by fear of some version of fire and brimstone, and is afraid to declare himself an atheist, agnostic, or just a questioner with an open mind.  <br />  <br />Did You Dance Along the Light of Day?: The book is a real page-turner, careening through space and time, language and culture, from a dissection of the Old and New Testaments,  quoting from another recently published book, \\"Misquoting Jesus\\" (in England titled, \\"Whose Word Is It?\\") by Bart Ehrman on the perils of taking a book that had been translated and transcribed (and modified) by hundreds of translators and scribes over thousands of years, as gospel truth; to an overview of the Universe, with its billion billion available planets, and the probability of life on just one of them; to the political battles over creationism vs. science in school curricula, both in Great Britain and the United States. Along the way we, of course, meet some monkey-obsessed fanatics, and for the gazillionth time, Dawkins must explain, as he did in \\"The Ancestors' Tale,\\" that we did not descend from monkeys, but do share a common ancestor. He most emphatically does not imply that your mother is a monkey.   <br /> <br />The Fools on the Hill: The most devastating comparison in the book (although they are discussed at opposite ends of the book) is between Thomas Jefferson and his fellow Fathers who were most responsible for America's Founding, whom Dawkins describes as \\"passionate secularists\\" (p. 43) and the recently-disgraced Pastor Ted Haggard - his disgrace revealed too recently to be included in this first edition - as \\"the interviewee who most appalled the British television audience.\\" (p. 319). In fact, according to Dawkins, the British are horrified by the influence of religious Fundamentalists in the United States. I must have some British genes, because I am equally horrified. <br /> <br />Now I Don't Claim to be an A Student: The worrisome thing about the anti-science bias promulgated by religious fanatics is the way that they need to subvert scientific knowledge to fit in with their religious beliefs. It's as if their Intelligent Designer just created the Earth about 6,000 years ago - the Young Earth theory - populating his arts and crafts project with both dinosaurs and homo sapiens, disregarding any evidence that biologists, geologists, and anthropologists (and many other -ologists) have discovered over the course of human history. If the Bible is a \\"major source book for literary culture,\\" (p. 341) and the King James Bible \\"includes passages of outstanding literary merit,\\" Dawkins will admit that the Bibles and holy books of religion are beautifully written stories, allegories, and a glimpse into the minds of the men who wrote them, but they most assuredly are not science. Thus the religious -ologists must twist the scientific facts to fit their faith.  <br /> <br />But I'm Trying to Be: The rigorous scientific method demands measurable evidence and experiments that can be replicated independently by others. Expecting a book or series of books written thousands of years ago to explain phenomena that have been discovered in just the past hundred years is like expecting the Albert Einstein of 1905 to fly a rocket to the moon - he was responsible for making moon rockets possible, but in 1905 he could only imagine the dream, not fulfill it. <br /> <br />Fall Into the Gap: \\"Gap\\" is the favorite explanation by the religious of events or processes that are not understood right now, leading them to rush to fill in the Gap with their Designer, rather than using objective, impartial inquiry, with the knowledge that is known to date, and pursuing questions that have not been answered yet.  <br /> <br />Dites-moi, Pourquoi (Tell Me Why)?: Dawkins doesn't know it all. I don'tknow it all. Yet. I'm a Questioner.  <br /> <br />

0440241901|5.0|\\"Can you keep a secret?\\" is the kind of book a reader loves to get lost in.  It's a perfect blend of Chick-Lit and Heart, and was written with great irony and sense of humor.  It is by far my favorite Sophie Kinsella!
B00005JLPK|5.0|I first saw this film on a French language TV channel (in French) and was mesmerized by it. I don't speak French, but knew some basic details about Frida & Diego Rivera, had heard of the dust-up with Rockefeller and had seen Rivera's murals in Mexico City, so was able to follow most of the plot. Next day I ordered the DVD & played it in English) over & over again till the fabulous music score & the song \\"Burn this bed, Burn it blue...\\" rang in my head for days.  <br /> <br />The film is visually stunning (from the vibrant colours of the locations and costumes to Frida's paintings), the characters fascinating & the music score haunting.  <br />It is set in the lively world of culture & society in Mexico between the two World Wars - a hotbed of politics, music, literature & avant-garde art - everybody who was anybody in the 1930's went to Mexico for a good time. It focuses on the tumultuous life of the Mexican-born artist Frida Kahlo, who was married to the larger-than-life muralist Diego Rivera.  <br /> <br />Frida's work is very surrealist, very personal, exotic, original and unforgettable. The director Julie Taymor has done a wonderful job of suggesting how Frida's life experiences melded into her painting. Lesser artists since have imitated Frida's style, but none of them have portrayed the inner world of pain and blood as Frida did.  <br />Taymor's commentary on the DVD is valuable for the additional insights it provides on Frida's art, life and times.  <br /> <br />There are only 5 films produced so far in the 21st century that are worth the time it takes to watch them & I no longer recall what the other 4 are.  <br /> <br />A beautifully illustrated coffee-table book \\"Frida Kahlo\\" was produced to accompany an exhibition of Kahlo's work at the Tate Gallery in London in 2005. I recommend it for those who wish to experience more of Frida's work without the expense of going to Mexico City.  <br /> <br />
B000HT386M|4.0|This is not your classic adam sandler gross out dumb humor.  Sure, there are a few bodily function jokes in here, but it really does have a cool storyline and a different take on the whole \\"Don't lose your family\\" movie.  Adam Sandler plays a father on the fast track for partnership in architectural firm who gets caught up in the rat race and keeps breaking promises to his family.  He also has a problem with all the remotes in his house.  So one night on an outing to Bed, Bath and Beyond, he finds the beyond, and a remote that takes him on the \\"journey of his life\\".   this movie has not only the humor, but some tear jerking parts as well.  Definately a good movie to see, even buy, watch it with the family.
0195067142|5.0|This is by far the most realistic, accurate, and personal account of war I have ever had the privilege of reading.  Anyone who has questions about military experience or the price of freedom should read this book.  This author is so gifted that I felt as if I actually went through the experiences along with those men he described.  I highly recommend this book.

B00005JP9V|1.0|Children of Men is a Saving Private Ryan rip-off.  It's one man's quest to save another person, from what, we are never told - but why bother with details? The violence is so graphic, and frequent, it must consume half the movie! To be perfectly honest I left the theater feeling bored and empty! I was also incredulous: Where's the story? At least Saving Private Ryan had a beginning, middle and end.  This mockery of a sci-fi film had virtually no beginning or end - it felt like one overly long chapter of a book taken out of context.  Not my idea of good story telling!<br /><br /> I can only speculate this film is doing so well in the United States because a large segment of the American public enjoys watching scenes of incredible violence and destruction. I'm tired of it! It's dreary, monotonous, and annoying! We have enough butchering going on in the real world that I don't need to pay to watch it, too!<br /><br />What makes this movie so incredibly sad is the waste of such outstanding acting talent! Don't actors, and their agents, bother to read the scripts before they sign on? If top acting talent started saying no to junk, then junk would be harder to sell to the movie going public!<br /><br />What messages is the viewer left with while watching this godforsaken movie? The human race will go barren for no apparent reason. The world, except Great Britain, (for some strange reason), will be reduced to savagery. The British government that does survives will, of course,  be fascist. Those who oppose the government will have to be terrorists. The good guys are so few, there's only a handful of people willing to save the last child on earth. People become terrorists because, \\"they just want respect!\\" (How touching, I never knew terrorists had such sensitive feelings!) The good guys come out of the blue, and you will know absolutely nothing about them, except they know how to pilot a large boat. People die constantly from stray bullets. (Then don't stand-up while the shooting is going on silly!) So many people die in this film, it becomes an art form: How many different ways can people possibly fall down in the same movie? It must set some sort of record!<br /><br />I repeat! This is not sci-fi! This is a war film, geared to teenage boys and young men. If you want to see really powerful & intelligent sci-fi then let your fingers do the walking over the Internet and purchase: 1. Zardoz, 2. Soylent Green, 3. Beneath the Planet of the Apes, 4. Silent Running, 5. Enemy Mine, 6. Light Years (By Rene Laloux), 7. Fantastic Planet, 8. Final Fantasy - The Spirit Within, 9. Artificial Intelligence (A.I.),  10. Bicentennial Man, 11.  Galaxy Quest (for comic relief!). While taste in film is personal, like any art, these eleven films, seen together, could change a person's life!hooting is going on silly!)

B00005MP58|5.0|I have seen this movie several times. It is very close to the book and the language and the landscape are just wonderful. It is a strange world were all that matters are just the social interactions and standings with other noble people, no work to do etc. But it is nice to get lost in this world, especially if it's done in such beauty and wonderful acting, customs, landscapes etc...
B000ICL3KG|5.0|Before giving my review, I could not enjoy the DVD because it is region-restricted PAL.  I am in Japan and my DVD player can not show any picture.
B000BJS4TO|5.0|When I ordered this item, it was for a Christmas present. In fact, I had ordered three of this item. They all came in a very, very timely manner and in perfect, shrink-wrapped condition. Thank you!
0786165391|4.0|Westerners who were present at the time will know that this story does a terrific job of catching the way things were in early ex-Soviet Baltic countries in early '90s. And it is a good Wallender story, as well. And the Wallender - Liepa connection is a mainstay throughout the rest of the series. Dick Hill is a gifted reader, and one whom I admire and enjoy for his voice and ability to use it -- sometimes. But he is not at all right for this series.  Mr Hill's reading is a major distraction -- kind of like the New Joiseyian who tries to do Texan. After hearing Sean Barrett on the Isis Audio Books of UK reading Mankell, this is disappointing by comparison. But I would buy and recommend Hill's Mankell readings anyway, and I want more. Blackstone Audio, Inc, please check out Mr. Barrett, but don't stop making Mankells in any case!
B000002B35|5.0|This was purchased and arrive well in time for a Christmas gift.  There were no problems and the disc arrived in great shape.
B000CNDIZE|1.0|I really had hope for this album, i really did. But i found it to be drab, lacking any noticable beat or melody, and most of all whiney, without depth, such a disapointment.... if you are looking for intresting vocal work as sia has done with zero 7...it is not here.
B000I5X81K|5.0|With every album, Josh Groban enhances his reputation as one of today's purest, most delightful and versatile vocalists. \\"Awake\\" is no exception, as he offers a range of ballads, classics and pop selections. Perfect for a leisurely afternoon, Groban's soothing and sensitive performances on \\"Awake\\" are a welcome departure from the chaos and cacaphony of everyday life.
B000E41MS6|5.0|It was once said by Harlan Ellison that negative reviews are easier to write. In which case this review for the new series will be extremely short. The new Doctor Who had a unique challenge - how to update a forty-year-old TV show for a modern audience that expected a much faster-paced story than the classic series could provide? The answer is a textbook-perfect example of how to update an old show for modern audiences. <br /> <br />Everyone in the cast and crew deserve credit for the great work they did. From the managers at BBC TV for choosing Russell T. Davies to revive the show. To Phil Collinson and Julie Gardiner for fostering a creative environment in which the writers and actors can shine. To the Mill FX for providing the most mind-blowing effects in a UK-based TV series for decades. And finally to the actors themselves for bringing a zing and a zest for life that the old series didn't always have.  <br /> <br />Billie Piper (as Rose) is the biggest standout performance throughout the entire series. She brings a strength, charisma and believability to the role that makes her character the most unique in the show's forty-plus-year history. And Christopher Eccleston also deserves credit for bringing the Doctor's portrayal into the 21st-Century. This is still (to paraphrase) absolutely the same man, but rewritten for a much more cynical harder-to-please audience. <br /> <br />The special features on this boxset are just terrific. The commentaries are definitely a highlight. Unfortunately, apart from a BBC interview Chris doesn't make an appearance. But Billie Piper does a commentary on two episodes. But the award for Best DVD Commentary on this boxset has to go to Steven Moffat, John Barrowman and Dave Houghton for The Empty Child/The Doctor Dances. In addition to being an informative commentary, it's also a very amusing one. Some highlights being both Moffat and Barrowman gleefully pointing out the \\"gay Officer's club\\". And listening to Moffat desperately backflipping through plot hoops to justify the appearance of a tape recorder in World War 2 Britain. Barrowman is a real livewire, always ready with a charismatic quip. And it's an absolute delight to see that Steve Moffat in real life is as witty and clever as his scripts are.  <br /> <br />A word-of-warning however to classic series fans: The new series is most definitely not like old Who. In addition to the 45-minute episodes, there's much less time for the dense leisurely plotting and science-fiction themes that were such a huge favourite of Eighties who fans. The burping bin and the farting Slitheen might also put old fans off watching the show. But the biggest turnoff for conservative classic series fans has to be the burgeoning romance between the Doctor and Rose. A plot development which would've been an absolute no-no to Old Who fans. Anyone who's been reading the Dr Who fan forums would've noted that these developments have alienated  a large number of Old School Classic Series fans, in addition to attracting new ones. <br /> <br />In conclusion, the 1st Series Boxset is strongly recommended for those wanting Family-friendly entertainment for a cold Winter's night. In addition to being great Science Fiction, it's just a great series - period. This new series has elevated Doctor Who to the ultimate form that we all knew it could be. Long may it reign.
B000EMGAOY|5.0|This album is one of their best!  It combines a little of their older style and a little of their new style.  Bravo!
B000EWBKLC|2.0|I agree with the first poster, the quality is not much better than a standard DVD.  Its very grainy is many spots too.
B000JK8OYU|5.0|I think it's terrific, gave me goose bumps when I played it the first time. I love the way the songs segue into one another.  Good selection of tunes, however, I could have done without \\"I Wanna Hold Your Hand\\".  It seems to be a tribute to John & George, which is what it should be.
B000077VPU|5.0|First purchased on Laser Disk. Had to modernize. Was very happy to see it available. If you love Queen, you'll love this. The numerous performers did an excellent job singing Mercury's songs. A very respectable tribute.
B00005JMFQ|4.0|Love Actually intricately links so many different stories in a festive joy of a film. Curtis's script delivers laughter and tears in roughly the right proportions, even if the plot is a bit clichéd and predictable. Would highly recommend any work by Richard Curtis (Four Weddings / Notting Hill etc) and if you like Love Actually the film, give the book `It's Cold outside by Steve Horsfall (another Brit) a go - another festive Romantic Comedy that hits the mark. <br />
B0002OERI0|3.0|The album is alright, nothing special. <br /> <br />Bille Joe Armstong is another in a long line of celebrity blowhards trying to tell us Republicans are evil, the President is out to kill everyone who disagrees with him, the south is full of stupid people, religious people are morons, and that war is always wrong. <br /> <br />The funny thing about \\"Holiday\\" is that while it is supposed to be a protest of the Iraq war, I could easily turn half of the lyrics in the song to show removing Saddam was a wise idea.  If President Bush was the slightest bit like Adolf Hittler, Bille Joe Armstong would be in a dark and quiet prison cell for 23 hours a day. <br /> <br />In the end, the true American Idiot is Bille Joe Armstong himself.
B0000E2FLC|5.0|Excellent video/audio quality. Great set of songs although not all of their best is here. However, considering how many years these guys have been rocking the concert would have to be 4 hours instead of 2 to fit EVERYTHING in and they have done an admirable job of fitting the cream of the crop into the video. Overall, this is the best concert DVD I own. Highly recommended to any AC/DC fan!

I am going to order NEW from now on so this doesn't happen again.  It was a HUGE bummer because I was dying to see it.  I will buy another one and it will be new!

B000ICLHIE|5.0|(\\"Orphans\\" by Tom Waits)<br /><br />A lot of Tom Waits fans might reply to my review title by exclaiming that there's never \\"too much\\" of one of the greatest singer-songwriters in America.  Now, I've gone and given this 5 stars, and I highly recommend it, especially with the deluxe packaging, Still, with 54 songs, and clocking in at over 3 hours, isn't it possible to feel gorged to the bursting by such a feast?  Then there's the fact that the 3 discs divide up his work to three basic moods: \\"Brawlers\\" features guitar based blues and rockers, \\"Bawlers\\" are generally piano-based ballads and \\"B@$tard$\\" are the more theatrical/experimental/weird stuff.  When I listen to a Waits album (at least once a week, sometimes more) I want all these styles mixed in.  If I ever feel totally feckless, I'll add all three discs to my mp3 player and hit \\"shuffle,\\" but for now I've been trying to digest it one disc at a time.  Here's where I'm at so far...<br /><br />\\"Brawlers\\" may seem stylistically monotonous, but there are subtleties that make it more than worth the effort.  \\"Lucinda\\" is a hypnotic blues number about a travelling sinner, one of Waits' favorite recurring themes.  \\"Bottom of the World\\" could pass for a drunken ballad, but Waits uses an extra-gravelly voice in the delivery, which cuts off any potential sentimentality pretty quickly.  \\"Road to Peace\\" is a true rarity in the Waits ouvre: an openly political song, this one about the ongoing Israeli/Palestinian conflict that tries not to take sides (except to bemoan the lack of sanity on both) but names names.  \\"Buzz Fledderjohn\\" is a surreal, amusing narrative (\\"Carp in the bathtub/and it's raining real hard\\").  All in all, the disc is a true Happy Hour.<br /><br />\\"Bawlers\\" may be the weakest disc overall, but its highlights are some of the best of all of them.  \\"Little Drop of Poison\\" is melodic and sinister; \\"You Can Never Hold Back Spring\\" is optimistic and openhearted without being sappy; \\"Goodnight Irene,\\" a Leadbelly cover, is perfect for a drunken singalong, which is how Waits does it.  Elsewhere, a cover of the Ramones (one of two Ramones covers, actually) \\"Danny Says\\" is completely transformed.  This disc will leave a tear in your beer for sure.<br /><br />\\"B@$tard$\\" lets Waits indulge his love for Kurt Weill, spoken word and \\"outsider\\" art.  This is my personal favorite of the set, so picking only a few highlights is difficult.  Still, there's the Cabaret howl of \\"What Keeps Mankind Alive,\\" the disturbing but strangely funny \\"Children's Story\\" (which should under no condition be read to children) and a cool cover of Daniel Johnston's \\"King Kong.\\"  Then there's \\"Heigh Ho\\"--that's right, from \\"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs\\" (\\"...it's off to work we go...\\")--under Waits vision, it comes out so mangled and mutated it's barely recognizable, and could possibly turn Disney's frozen corpse into dust.<br /><br />The one constant in all this, though, is The Voice.  Whether rasping, growling or roughly crooning, this is Waits' best known attribute, and at this point a national treasure.  If you're a newcomer to Waits, though, this really isn't the place to start, unless you want your head to explode.  Go for something like \\"Rain Dogs\\" or, if you're more daring, the clanking, hissing and scraping in a tool shed that is \\"Bone Machine\\" (although the closest to a short-form version of \\"Orphans,\\" at least in mood, since they share no songs, is \\"Mule Variations\\").  The only reason a longtime fan should be without this if you've already spent all your money on liquor, which I'm sure Waits would understand. As the Man himself once said: \\"I'd rather have a bottle in front of me than a frontal lobotomy.\\"a drunken singalong, which is how Waits does it.  Elsewhere, a cover of the Ramones (one of two Ramones covers, actually) \\"Danny Says\\" is completely transformed.

0060922583|5.0|Never before has a book ventured to explain such a comprehensive range of supernatural and metaphysical phenomena within one single theoretical framework. The ability of the Holographic Model to shed light on a prolific scope of inexplicable \\"psychic\\" occurrences (that has eluded conventional science) with such simplicity is just too \\"beautiful\\" not to be considered an integral component in the fabric of reality itself. This sentiment is similar to those held by modern physicists regarding the concept of super-string theory; that it is mathematically able to unify all matter and forces in the universe under one elegant principle. In a way, one may be so bold as to say that these two theoretical constructs could be viewed as two sides of the same coin; whereas super-string theory can tell us the \\"hows\\" of the universe, the holographic model helps us understand the \\"whys\\".   <br /> <br />Employing irrefutable anecdotal evidence and eye-witness accounts, Michael Talbot builds his book, example by example, on the foundations of the holographic model as set forth by the intellectual union of Karl Pribram and David Bohm. Through their respective disciplines in neurology and quantum physics, Pribram and Bohm have both amazingly arrived at the same ground-breaking concept: That reality itself is a hologram. According to the theory, reality is the unfolding of a densely rich interference pattern (the implicate order) that is given holographic form by our consciousness (acting like a laser) and stored in such a manner by our brains as memories. As such, all information, regardless of time, space or dimensionality, is \\"non-local\\" whereby every seemingly \\"fragmented\\" entity (you, me, the computer screen you are sitting in front of, or even the Titanic) in existence contains the information for the construction of the whole. In the implicate order, one is all and all is one, the proverbial \\"universe in a grain of sand\\". The implications are nothing short of staggering. Telekinesis, telepathy, psychokinesis, poltergeist activity, human energy fields (auras), precognition, remote-viewing, psychometry, object manifestation, miraculous healing, OBEs (Out of Body Experiences), NDEs (Near Death Experiences), lucid dreaming, hypnosis, Marian visions and UFO sightings, all become tenable manifestations of the Holographic Model.   <br /> <br />Central to the book is the idea that, in modern times, human consciousness, en masse, has become complacent and passive in its unfolding of the implicate order under the influence of \\"objective\\" science. Since we are inclined to believe that there is an \\"in here\\" (mind) subjected to an \\"out there\\" (reality), we view ourselves nothing more than impotent bystanders in an infinite universe, vulnerable to its machinations, unobtrusive observers to its processes. However, the Holographic Model tells us that the in-here/out-there dichotomy is but an illusion we have become accustomed to. Through our beliefs, the accumulated body of our dominant thought patterns, we are subconsciously and unconsciously reinforcing the \\"solidity\\" of our reality. According to a variety of phenomena cited in the book, some people have been able to \\"tap\\" into their deepest beliefs in order to become active participators in the creation of the explicate order. All matter in existence, like the holograms we create of it in our memories, are nothing more than a mere collections of waves, interference patterns that can \\"molded\\" by us as potently as it \\"molds\\" us, like a never-ending feed-back loop.    <br /> <br />This book is a keeper, one that has the ability to shatter our deepest held notions of reality by impelling us to expand our dogmatic horizons so as to acknowledge all the well documented possibilities of the power displayed by the human psyche that science has been so keen to sweep under the rug.  <br />

B000E6UK32|4.0|A terrific collection of their greatest hits.  Excellent sound quality and comes with a bonus dvd! Although, the re-make of \\"In The Flesh\\" I thought was boring and rather dull.  Should have just put the original on the line-up and left it alone.  It was their first break through hit and the original recording is really pretty.  The original recording of \\"Good Boys\\" should have been put on there as well.  I think the whole thing would be truly excellent had they done that.  Otherwise, great collection for Blondie fans and the non alike!

B000H6SXMY|5.0|I often watched Friends but having this collection made me realize, I missed many.  The packaging is convenient and the extras are great!
B000J3EEBY|5.0|I happened across a Christmas song done by Loreena on a compilation CD a few years back and was entranced by her voice and musical arrangement.  I'm so glad I sought her out to see what other work she had done.  This CD is just amazing.  I bought two copies intending on giving them as gifts, but luckily kept one for myself.  It has been in my CD player ever since.  It is so relaxing and haunting and romantic and energetic all at the same time.  It moves me.  The vocals are just beautiful.  The percussions send chills down my spine.  It is marketed as Celtic music, but I can't help but hear a middle eastern sound throughout (probably the lyre).  I'd highly recommend this for your collection.
B000IZJZLM|5.0|I love the guys voices blended together as well as each individually. You can't get any better. Il Divo is a beautiful CD. I would definitely recommend Il Divo.
B000HT3Q3M|5.0|Great music by 2 of todays great artists. Why did it take so long for these 2 to put something together, I guess we will never know , but I am so glad they did !! This combination is a must for George Benson and Al Jarreau fans.
B000K7VHQ4|5.0|I must say that I bought this DVD based on all of the reviews that I had read about it. I was somewhat skeptical because I don't remember it being in theaters for too long (which usually means that the movie was horrible), but this movie really surprised me. There are twists and turns throughout the entire movie and it really kept you on the edge of your seat. Finally at the end of the movie you find out the true secrets of the Illusionist. I would definitely recommend this movie for anyone.
B000A6T1JU|5.0|I gave these movies out as gifts to my grandsons so I haven't heard if they played good.  If they hadn't, I am sure I would have heard about it by now.  Fast delivery and they arrived in good shape though.
6305428042|4.0|enjoyed the special effects as well as story line and costumes and make up.
0618680004|5.0|probably one of the best books i have ever read. it answers many questions i've had concerning god, religion, morality, beliefs & especially no god {the god delusion}. 5 stars are not enough, this should be a \\"required reading book\\" in all colleges & institutions of higher learning. definitely a book for the thinking person & for those who want some answers.
0792163710|5.0|This product came quick and was in very good shape.  This was the perfect Christmas gift for my father. <br />
B000F8O35U|5.0|Gotta love the Little Mermaid.  It came on time and in perfect condition. Thanks.
B000J10ERO|5.0|This is a must see for all Superman fans, although it didn't quite compare to seeing it on the big screen.  The special features/making of was really one of the best I've seen because it was pretty comprehensive. Brandon did a great job making it his own while retaining the Superman essence. Definitely a keeper for true Superman fans!
B00005LC1H|5.0|I purchased Fawlty Towers for a French friend of mine. I couldn't bare the thought of him not being acquainted with this masterpiece of British hilarious craziness. He loves it. If he hadn't, our friendship would have been seriously jeopardized.
B000JK8OYU|4.0|The remastering adds new life to these recordings. I enjoy this cd very much.
B000HOMU98|4.0|Kubrick was a visual wizard. Masterfully controlling the cinematography of Full Metal Jacket, he rendered every image is a work of art, searing them into the conscious and subconscious mind. And seeing it in high definition is a wonder. To be sure, there are better transfers, but mostly on subpar films (trash like Stargate). This version of Full Metal Jacket is crisp and clear; the soundtrack is amazing.<br /><br />As far as the story goes, it's impressionistic -- a series of vignettes held together by characters we first meet in bootcamp. It leaves a powerful, lasting impression of the horror, irrationality, and, ultimately, the pure humanity of war. We are killing machines and lovers, passionate friends and brutal thugs. And, in killing and fighting, we sometimes find ourselves most alive.<br /><br />There are amazingly poignant lines in this film that resonate powerfully in terms our current war in Iraq. They don't support one side or another, but merely reflect on the universality of war and on America's invervention in places where the locals might not entirely appreciate our efforts and sacrifices. Reasonable human beings can differ on what is going on in Iraq, just as they could about Vietnam. Full Metal Jacket really isn't about that kind of debate. Rather, it turns the spotlight on how much war is a part of us -- and we a part of it.
B0009R1T7M|4.0|So perhaps I am late to jump on the bandwagon, but I really enjoy Sufjan's Illinois cd.  There is quite a variety of sounds  on the cd, making it consistently interesting.  Some of the lyrics are hysterical, the way that he works to fit in the names of Illinois towns and famous citizens.  I suggest this cd, especially to those who, like me, are recent transplants to the state.
1573223026|5.0|A story that begins with four very different people about to commit suicide is not usually expected to become entertaining and funny, but this one does. While wrestling with some big issues -- the meaning of life, relationships, careers, guilt, redemption -- Hornby (and his characters) are, during the course of the book, amusing, angry, cynical, and uplifting. <br /> <br />I couldn't put the book down. <br /> <br />
B000DWMYQ8|3.0|Adults might find this one fun to watch with the pre-pre-teen crowd.  Those between the ages of 10 and 20 will most likely hate it.  I liked it for the life lessons, even though they were taught with cliches most times.  The beginning and end were tied-in cleverly.  The animation was very good.  The aliens will remind you of the classic Star Trek episode, \\"The Trouble with Tribbles\\".
B000H5U832|5.0|Cars was the first theater movie for our 3-year old, so he was naturally thrilled to receive his own copy for Christmas.  It's a great family film that even we adults enjoy.
0790731479|5.0|i think its a great movie i like micheal keaton i think hes a great actor and so is the actress who plays lidda.
0143034901|5.0|I love to read, but i read mostly the classics.  I don't care for most books written today because the prose usually lacks the same kind of voice we find in Dickens or Steinbeck, or the plots are too easy to figure out.  this book, though a english translation from the original spanish contained beautiful prose and a plot that left me guessing all the way to the end.  I cannot recommend this book enough.  It is a multi-genre tale also.  Part mystery, part romance, part ghost story.  This book will suck you in almost immediately and leave you wanting to linger for a long time to come.
B000I5X81A|5.0|This new project by Eric Clapton and J.J. Cale is wonderful.  I know that it has gotten mixed reviews, but it all depends on what you are looking for, I guess.  I got exactly what I hoped for, and that is some very tasty, down-home style blues.  It's not flashy, but there is some guitar work on this album that is excellent.  In my opinion, Eric Clapton has improved drastically as a blues player in the past decades, especially since he began seriously studying the work of Robert Johnson.  And how appropriate it is for these two gentlemen to do an album together.  Cale, after all, wrote at least two of the songs that Clapton had hits with, After Midnight, and Cocaine.  He also wrote one that Lynyrd Skynyrd covered, They Call Me the Breeze.  It's my opinion (and I have listened to a lot of blues) that this project is brilliant and well worth purchasing.
B000002UJQ|5.0|I never thought I'd say Radiohead was brilliant... that was until I was given this CD... I think I must have listened to it every day for months until I finally got The Bends which in my book is one of the best purchases ever made.
B00029LNHS|4.0|I like this, but I LOVE hip hop..I still think early BEP's was best, but this is a fun packed dance-lover album.
B000H6SXMY|3.0|I ordered this dvd set for my husband as a gift...when we received it the outer case was broken but the dvd's are working fine..i think they should have taken better care while shipping.
B000E8N690|5.0|Good quality, Good service.  I would perchase from here again.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|This is the BEST Broadway Soundtrack!  The whole cast is OUTSTANDING, but Idina Menzel and Kristen Chenoweth are AMAZING!  I would highly recommend this CD to anyone who enjoys Broadway shows.  This is actually my second copy (I wore out the first one).
B000BTC5LW|5.0|Absolutely amazing concert.  Everytime I see this, I wish I'd have been there in person.  All the great PF tunes are here, well performed with a superbly produced and choreographed film/light/stage show.
B00004RF8J|4.0|Those who love musicals will like this film. They will enjoy the story and the way it's sung.
B000B8QG4A|5.0|pampered pet meets junkyard dog in this charming tale of what can happen when two canine worlds collide -- rascally Tramp shows the elegant Lady what life is like on the other side of the tracks, and when Tramp comes to the rescue in Lady's posh home and gets taken to the pound for his trouble, Lady's highbrow friends Jock and Trusty realize they've misjudged the Tramp and race to HIS rescue!  this is a fun, doggy romp the whole family can enjoy together!
B00006IUL6|4.0|It was interesting to see Robin Williams as a villian. He is a very good actor in this film. Although I never had a case of insomnia, this movie can bring you closer to what it may feel like.
B0000TG9E2|5.0|as a little girl, I loved \\"Alice In Wonderland,\\" with its fanciful creatures, silly characters, and enchanting story; now MY kids can enjoy Alice's adventures themselves!  whether it's an \\"Un-birthday Party\\" w/the March Hare and the Mad Hatter, or a bizarre game of croquet w/the Queen of Hearts and a set of goofy flamingo \\"mallets,\\" kids of all ages will enjoy this Disney animated classic!
B000HCO83G|5.0|I LOVE ACTION MOVIES!!!!! I give X-Men 3 5 out of 5 because I love action and I love super heroes! I thought it was a reasonable and fantastic ending for the X-Men series through the films. This is, above all, one of my favorite movies. I can't decide who I like better: Captain Jean-Luc Picard or Professor Charles Xavier?
B000IZJZLM|5.0|I am a huge fan of Il Divo's CD's  the blend of their voices and the languages are excellent, I would recomend this for easy listening to anyone.
B00005JNS0|3.0|You can't go wrong with a Pixar movie, so even though Cars is about, well, race cars, racing, and driving in a world filled with cars (and no people), I decided to give it a try. I'm so glad I did. It's filled with interesting characters from Mater the tow truck to Guido the forklift and the stars of the film are as usual interesting and entertaining. <br /> <br />Lightning McQueen is self-centered and arrogant but when after a three-way tie for first place in the Piston Cup, he gets lost on the way to the tie breaker race and ends up in Radiator Springs. He's sentenced to community service and tries to weasel out and escape his obligation. The towns autos keep him close and eventually he begins to see that not all the world is involved in racing and speed isn't what life is all about.  <br /> <br />The realization is a bit abrupt but then it's film. The movie is also filled with lots of sight gags and in jokes some for the kids and some for adults and some for all ages. There's a lot that applies to life and just a lot of wonderful Route 66 trivia. Give it a chance.
B000002BDB|5.0|Amen to a lot of what other reviewers have said here. Here's my two cents: I enjoy listening to these albums very much (Sketches of Spain is my favorite in this collection because it's so damn beautiful and creative). But I also enjoy listening to the outtakes.  <br /> <br />Yes, most of these outtakes deserve to be on the cutting room floor. But it is neat to listen to Miles and Gil work out those phrases that we all know and love so very much. It's sort of like looking over Picasso's shoulder as he paints or Hemingway's as he writes. The outtakes let you hear a little bit on how these masterpieces were put together.  <br /> <br />
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|This movie is a well put together edge of your seat adventure in romance and folly. The acting is supurb! The intertwined stories of the family are very intrueging.
B00005N6KG|4.0|Sound pretty good and hold up to a rugged environment.
044022425X|5.0|I have loved Diana Gabaldon books. I have read them all over and over. I would say above all books I have ever read her books I love the best. Often times I find when I am bored or driving in the car my mind takes me back to a scene in one of her books. I am an avid reader and have bookshelves upon bookshelves of books. but this book along with the others in the series are my very favorite. Read them you will not regret it!!! <br />
B0000DJZA5|5.0|Beatle fan, Beatle historian, or just someone shopping at WalMart, this set is worth buying. It isn't \\"The Beatles Get Back\\" as originally intended, but  a VAST improvement on the \\"Let It Be\\" album, which, folks, I bought in the cut-out bins at Woolworths for 99 Cents years ago. Much more like a Beatles record than \\"Let It Be\\" ever was.  <br />I'd really rather they released the \\"Let It Be\\" film though, as I've seen it and wished I had recorded it... <br />Those who wrote bad reviews for this kind of miss the point, but they have a right to their opinion...

B00011F5DK|5.0|I purchased this as a Christmas gift for my grandaughters ages 5,7,9,and 11. I was amazed that they all could sit down together and play this game without any fighting. I was also able to see how well several of them could translate the shapes they had to the shapes that were available for play. Good cognitive skill shaper.  <br />Great family game!
B000JLTRKE|4.0|Time passes fast...as we are in 2007 already, but this event just seems<br /><br />like yesterday.  Im glad this movie was made...to remind us when we will<br /><br />tend to forget.  The movie is pretty good, it will bring back memories, and<br /><br />even if most of the movie is about the rescue of 2 men, it brings to mind<br /><br />all related events that unfolded that day and how mankind dealt with the<br /><br />ultimate chaos....  .
1582701709|5.0|This book is wonderful.  Easy to read and understand. So full of valuable information. A powerful guide to make incredible, healthy life changes. You will want to keep the book forever and read it over and over again for the rest of your life.  I recommend the world to read it.
B000GTJT0M|2.0|This movie had great visuals but the storyline and actors were boring and made it difficult to stay awake. A great feature film for a yawning festival.
B00005JO9J|5.0|I had purchased this season one and two for a gift.  I borrowed season one and was HOOKED.  What a great series! I prefer seeing it on DVD's instead of having to watch all the commercials. I love the story line and it's fast moving.
B00005OAE6|5.0|Great CD... Seger and his band at their best.... loved it.
B000F8O35U|5.0|My grandchildren -- a boy 6 and a girl 7 loved the movies!!  And it arrived very quickly
B000JK8OYU|5.0|The LV show is wonderful. The cd brings back nice memories.
0446672653|5.0|I have read all of the Brian Weiss books (a few more than once) and this is easily my favorite and has brought me alot of peace and acceptance of relationships I haven't understood (mine and others').  Wonderful reading.
B000FP2OPY|5.0|I received my \\"Supernatural - The Complete First Season\\" DVD's very quickly after ordering! They were in perfect condition when I opened them - in original wrapping and everything! Thank you!!! <br />
0307001369|3.0|I PAID $4.99 AND THE BACK OF THE BOOK LISTS A US PRICE OF $2.99.
B0000VCZKM|5.0|This movie is great.  The shipping was fast and just what I expected.
0394818237|5.0|THIS IS A GREAT KID'S BOOK.  THE ILLUSTRATIONS, CHARACTERS, CONTENT ARE INTERESTING FOR KIDS AND THEY CAN ENJOY IT EVEN BEFORE THEY ARE OF READING AGE.  ONE DISAPPOINTMENT IS THAT IT'S ABRIDGED - WHY NOT BRING BACK THE FULL-SIZED BOOK?
B00006CXSS|5.0|I received this product in a short period of time, it is perfect. Mint condition and a great price!
B0000AOV85|4.0|Very informative, with an emphasis on interviews with Roger Waters and David Gilmour. Not surprisingly, Waters spends most of his time talking about the thematics of the album and its songs while Gilmour - who performs a few tunes in his studio with only an acoustic guitar - focuses on the music. But then, that's pretty much the way Floyd operated at its peak. Gilmour still sounds great. I only wish they'd spent a little time discussing how much they can't stand one another as it makes for great drama.
B000GDH9JQ|4.0|Great movie, actually decent story for a movie with MB. G. Hines shines like always... Great fusion movie for dance lovers.
B000ANVQ0K|5.0|I am fascinated by anything connected with the Titanic. So, this movie has to be one of my favorites!  But, the special features of this edition were superior. Very informative and entertaining!  James Cameron deserved every award offered for this film. His cast, crew, and technicians crafted a beautiful and riveting movie blending fact and fiction.
B0000DJZA5|2.0|I'm not sure if this is the director's cut, or a rough draft.  However, it seems to supplement rather than supplant the original album.  In fact, this album is about 89% of what you heard on the 1970 original--there are no radical or breathtaking changes with this album.<br /><br />The main redactions are with \\"The Long and Winding Road,\\" and \\"Across the Universe,\\" plus a different take of \\"Get Back\\" (minus the hilarious audition comment).  \\"Let it be\\" and \\"Long and Winding  Road\\" sound almost like the singles available on the \\"Blue Album.\\"<br /><br />Therefore, everything else sounds more or less the same.  An incidental Beatles fan should stick with the original.<br /><br />Actually, I am fan of the film rather than the album, so I enjoyed the \\"Fly on the Wall\\" bonus CD.  It serves as an hors-d'oeuvre until they get the film out on DVD.  Paul! Ringo! Mush!  Don't Get Back--Just Get Cracking!
B000ICL3KG|4.0|I think that it was very informative and I love the visuals.  I have shown this to several people and I am telling even more.
0240808452|5.0|This was a gift for my niece who is an artist and she absolutely loved it.
B00002ZMNV|5.0|I bought this DVD for my boyfriend for Christmas and he asbsolutely loves it!  It has fantastic sound quality and it is very impressive to watch the orchestra play in the background.  Perfect gift for any Metallica lovers!
B000BNI90O|5.0|I'm so glad they are putting all these recordings out.  It's absolutely worth it for someone who appreciates this music!
B000ICL3KG|5.0|This is a \\"must see\\" film for all ages and political swings.
B000K7VHPU|4.0|but I don't think that's a full review of a movie. The Illusionist is quite charming, slickly shot, and surprisingly easy to digest for a period piece. The language isn't stilted, and the scenes are colorful and don't shy away from modern artsy style shots. The whole theme of the magic act is almost as fun to watch as if we were going to the shows. If the movie will do one thing, it's keep you on the edge of your seat looking for the next surprise.<br /><br />The love story, and then crime story that carry the plot seem to bring with them that same slick, fun, crafted appeal. However, all said and done, this can also be where if I had to point out flaws, I would say they lie. For instance the romance is central to the story but has about 2 minutes screen time, no joke. With that being the case, the viewer may wonder, why do I care about these people? It's fun to watch the magic act unfold, but the characters in the end don't reveal their souls to us very much, just their faces.<br /><br />  That being the case I would say this movie is a very fun watch, but low down the scale of really engaging your brain or emotions afterwards. It's a great, well produced ride, and in the end a fairly \\"family movie-ish\\" affair. It's certainly worth watching.
B000IZJZLM|4.0|I thought that it was very well done with a pleasant variety of musical numbers.
B0001YRVN4|5.0|This was a gift for my teenaged Grandson who loves Start Wars. He loved the boxed trilogy set.
B000I0QK74|5.0|This is a wonderful CD!  I played it continually from Thanksgiving to Christmas.  Great listening!
0783225849|5.0|Every horror fan should have this one,if for no other reason than the shower scene.I'm not gonna waste your time with the details because as a (good)movie fan you should already know them.The picture and sound are better than ever with the technology of dvd,plus I believe there's some added scenes.this is not an expensive dvd.So stop wasting time,and spend $3.00 and buy it already IT'S  A FREAKIN' CLASSIC!!!!
B000BEZQ0Y|4.0|Having bought this for my wife because she LOVES the music and watches the movie and British television shows time after time after time, I was expecting to cringe when I heard it, but it is actually a very nice collection of music.  It is on the light classical side which is a nice change from time to time from Country, the Blues, Bluegrass or Rock and Roll. <br />It's obviously a well produced piece and if you can Handel a lighter \\"Classical\\" music before getting Bach to Warren Zevon, Dave Perkins or the Stones, I think you will like this.
B000I5X81A|5.0|I bought this CD for my husband for Christmas, thinking it would really be loud, rocky music.  I ended up enjoying it very much!!  It's got enough rock to hold my husband's interest but mellow enough for me to want to hear it often!  This is a great \\"all around\\" collection!
B000I5X81K|5.0|What can I tell you about this cd? If you've listen to Josh Groban you won't be surprise... It's the same beautiful voice, singing beautiful new songs (great selection by the way) with great musical arrangements. I loved it, highly recomended. <br /> <br />LUz
B000BKJ78K|5.0|i bought it for my boyfriend , and i have never watched it before. i was surprised at how much i liked it.
B000IVW25M|5.0|This was a gift order for my niece.  Once again, as with all products purchased from Amazon.com, the DVD arrived well packaged and in time for Christmas.  My niece is very happy and satisfied with this product.
B00005JNS0|4.0|I thought this was a great movie for the whole family!  We bought this copy for my nephew but also received this as a gift!  Great gift idea!
0446677450|5.0|I thought this book had great lessons for those of us who don't properly understand money.  I wish I had read this when I was 21, but better late than never.  I felt it had so many good lessons about understanding money, and how to put money to work for you, that I bought a copy for each of my four kids for Christmas.  I am hoping we can all think about money differently, after reading this book, and begin to create the wealth and comfort in our lives that we all deserve!
0380018179|5.0|Never in my literary life (and it is indeed an extensive and highly varied life) have I ever loved a book quite so much, or in quite so many ways.<br /><br />I currently own 5 copies of this book and have read it in excess of 30 times. (I stopped counting after that.) Yet, no matter how many times I read it, I still see something new, see a new twist on a thought, action or emotion.<br /><br />I have found there to be a facet of nearly ever lesson we humans learn in life...the brightest and the ugliest sides of every emotion are all so wonderfully present in this book.  Over the years, it has taught me not only how others feel and think, love and hate, live and die..but so much about how I do all of those things myself, some that perhaps I may never have seen in quite such a light without an aid.<br /><br />I'm certainly not saying this book is the end all, be all for every one, nothing can be...but I certainly think it's time well spent for everyone, even if it's nothing more than to enjoy a sweeping drama that encompasses 3 generations and characters as varied and well written as you could want.
B000J103PC|3.0|This is a decent movie.  It's characters are well-played, but, unfortunately, you pretty much know exactly what is going to happen throughout the show.  No big, thrilling movie for me, but there's a good lesson about keeping your values intact even when you don't want to.
B0002IQOZA|4.0|Christina brings her unique sound to traditional Christmas songs, giving them new life. The CD made a nice addtition to my Christmas music collection.
0783226845|5.0|Excellent movie!  Not a chick flick - great for both men and women.  Highly recommend this movie.
B000DZIGDU|1.0|My husband is a Vietnam vet and we watch all the war movies.   We love Saving Private Ryan, We were Soldiers, Platoon.   They are real war movies.  This movie was just filth.  It insults all marines to think that this is the way they act.   We were very disappointed with the movie and I am upset I spent the money on it.    If you want to watch a good war movie, try any of the three I mentioned above.   And don't forget to pray for our troops.
B00011F5DK|5.0|We love this game. We have 2 boys 9 & 10. When the weather locked us in for 3 days we got out several games to play. We never made it to the other games. This is a great game that we all enjoyed.
0743454537|3.0|This was my first Picoult book, which I chose solely because the dust jacket promised an exploration of an intriguing medical/ethical dilemma.  To its credit, it's thought provoking, invites discussion and debate,  and is hard to put down -- so I'm generously giving it a 3.  It also has critical flaws:  1) Picoult's penchant for the implausible is a major distraction.  Some of the \\"yea, rights\\" are comparably nitty.  A fireman's young daughter rides along to an accident scene and is allowed to help her dad with a victim once she gets there.  And we're to believe a lawyer with a service dog can keep his medical problems a secret from everyone, including his family and employers, for decades despite the fact the medical problem appears to \\"presents itself\\" on an unusually frequent basis.  Other examples are really glaring, particularly the whole court battle, which is so far from reality it screams lame book and puts everything else in question.  The son's actions, miraculous redemption, and new leaf are a bit much, too.  I for one like to learn from fiction authors who do good research.  Picoult doesn't offer that bonus.  2) Superficial sub-plots relegate the book to canned family drama /beach read status. Picoult piles on tension and conflict in relationships that seem contrived, predictable, and distracting.  3) Over-the-top sappy ending.  However, contrary to other readers, I think the net outcome is okay.  It underscores a key message of the book -- no cut and dried right choice (in book, most parties see both sides of issue), so why do we care what choice Anna makes.  Plus I love surprise plot twists.
0882847953|5.0|I am currently using this book to teach my son basic drumming with a roland practice pad. It has been a fantastic help. <br /> <br />This book would be helpful to any beginning student learning to read music, not just drummers, since it so clearly breaks down rhythmic notation. The exercise progressions make a lot of sense, and there are quarter note guides that align the drum notes relative to the downbeat, which is very helpful for learning syncopation.
B000J103YI|5.0|As a music lover I cannot believe how fantastic this CD is.  I usually listen to the music before I purchase it and see the movie or show.  This was a sensational piece of work.  Jennifer Hudson, whom I idolized during the American Idol season, deserves to win the Oscar for her singing alone.  I cannot wait to see the movie.  I love Beyonce, but I believe in all honesty that Jennifer showed in all earnest that she was more credible.
B000IHY9SE|1.0|There is only the one good song on this CD. Save your money and buy the single.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Only 14 episodes, canceled in it's infancy, one of the best scifi television series ever. It's smart, witty, high drama, lots of morality issues, interesting characters what more can you say, it's too good for regular television. Fox canceled it because it wasn't \\"dumbed down\\" enough for their typical audience. The series assumes you have a high school graduate's intelligence (Fox shoots for elementary school graduate) and takes you on a terrific adventure. They made it into a movie called \\"Serenity\\", so there is a very very small chance that they might bring it back, is the Sci-fi channel listening?
033036426X|5.0|In a story told by death, Zusak gives us the tale of a foster child living in Nazi Germany.  Liesel finds many ways to subvert the fatherland, including stealing a book from a burning, leaving food for prisoners, and, with her family, hiding a Jewish man in the basement.  Because the story is told by death, the reader is given a glimpse into Liesel's life, but also shown the wider view of an exhausted Death during World War II. <br /> <br />Quote: \\"He chose his words gradually.  `Don't get caught.'  This from a man who'd stolen a Jew.\\" <br /> <br />I really liked this book.  The idea of Death being an observer of life- given a task to do regardless of personal feelings- is very interesting.  A unique tale.  Additionally, there is a cast of primary and secondary characters introduced, which adds a great dimension to the story since they are all fascinating individuals.  Although it is classified as \\"youth fiction,\\" it is quite sizable (over 500 pages), and would be good reading for most adults.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|Based on the limited run sci-fi series called Firefly, conceived by Josh Wheaton, who wrote the Buffy TV series. Serenity is better than most of the Star Trek movies, certainly the last 6, and I'm a trekky. You don't need to have seen the TV series to understand the movie. As a matter of fact I saw the movie before I saw the TV series. This movie is a smart, witty, exciting sci-fi adventure. Anyone who likes sci-fi will love this movie.

B000H5U832|5.0|We got this movie for our son and he absolutely loves it!  This was the only movie he wants to watch now.  We had a long drive home from Christmas and this is one of the few movies that you can listen to/watch in the car and not get sick of it!  The characters are endearing.  The storyline is incredibly funny and something we all can learn from.  My two-year-old now tips every tractor he plays with!!!

0061122416|5.0|The Alchemist is an intriguing story, almost more of a parabole.  Very motivating.
B0006SSOHC|2.0|Hype can be a dangerous thing. For a long time all I heard about this movie was how disturbing and relentlessy terrifying it was. Well i saw it finally and my expectations were not what I would say raised, but high enough to be slightly dissapointed. Don't get me wrong,I didn't hate it, it just didn't end up equaling the sum of its parts.  <br /> <br />The basic plot is this:two guys who seemingly have nothing to do with each other wake up in a room.They don't have any idea how they got there, they're chained by the ankle to opposite ends of the room, there's a dead body between them and to make matters even worse, they are taunted by a video moniter showing with some sort of handpuppet clown(piture Pennywise and Gonzo having a baby) who tells them this is all part of a game he's set up for them to teach them a lesson about some sort of evildoing that he knows about and they have to figure out how to escape or the consequences are going to be dire. Intercut with that are scenes of Danny Glover as an ex-cop fired for his obsession with Jigsaw(the puppet) and even after losing his job,still pursues him. In the Glover flashbacks we get treated to past victims of Jigsaw and the torments they endured. <br /> <br />Overall, the movie had some nice horror sequences,some creative kills and an ending I didn't see coming, so Im really looking to give it 2 and a half stars, but i can't. the problems in the movie arise when you look at the fact that this movie is setting itself up to be a serious, disturbing look into the psyche and comes across as more B-grade than it pretends to be. Sort of an overhyped snuff film. In a serious horror movie, you're supposed to be afraid, or at least disturbed. Saw did neither of those things for me, it barely crossed th line into entertaining. Don't get me wrong, im all for senseless violence and gore, but when it tries to put on a nice dress when it really is Courtney Love morning after a bender underneath, well, she ain't foolin anybody. The perfomances as a whole take away something from the proceedings as well. Cary Elwes plays one of the men in the room and as I said before Danny Glover is the obsessed ex-cop whose investigation soon becomes intertwined with with Mr Elwes's consequence(does that even make sense?) and both men seem out of their element. Their performances are so overwrought and \\"tension\\" filled that theres never anywhere to go for them. Look, if the characters can't take you with them in a movie like this, you ain't going. Where are the levels? Both men verge on camp and they simply fall in line with everyone else in the movie, save Ronald Mcdonald on acid(aforementioned puppet).When an expressionless block with a mouth that can't do much more than move up and down can show more subtlety than you, you've got a problem. Also, alot of the fear in the movie depends on mounting tension. Part of what the men are given to help them figure out how to escape are saws(get it?) and the build-up through most of the movie is finding out who, if anybody, would be the one to give himself the lifetime 50% discount for all future Dr Scholls purchases and when that moment finally arrives, not only was it not tense, it was hysterical. Probably not what they were shooting for. <br /> <br />Anyway, Its not horrible, I don't know that I would even call it bad, but it wasn't what it was cracked up to be. you could say that I never SAW what all the hype was about(HHAHAHAHAHAHA). If you really want to see a gory disturbing snuff film that doesn't pretend to be anything else, go find 10,000 maniacs somewhere and lugh youself over a barrel.
1400082773|5.0|DREAMS FROM MY FATHER: A STORY OF RACE AND INHERITANCE is a deeply insightful look into the life and soul of the man called Barack Obama--and a very good book in its own right. <br /> <br />The first thing to know about this memoir is that it was written long before the author decided to enter politics. So it is not a political tract. You will find no 10-point plans or partisan screeds here. Instead, it is the intensely personal and probing account of a young black man and his journey to find his place in a divided and confusing world. The memoir begins with a young Barack in New York City, attending Columbia University but nonetheless directionless, unsure of himself and of his larger purpose, whatever that might be. Then, a call that changes everything, and changes nothing: it's from an Aunt in Kenya he has never met, calling about a father that he hasn't seen since he was ten. \\"Barry,\\" the Aunt tells him. \\"Barry, your father is dead.\\" <br /> <br />It is Barack Obama, Sr.--or rather, his absence--that provides the narrative force behind DREAMS FROM MY FATHER. His father was an ambitious man from Kenya who grew up herding goats but had won a scholarship to study in America, at the University of Hawaii. It was there that he met a young and shy white girl from Kansas; and so against all odds, they fall in love, get married, and have a son. But when Barack is only two, Barack Sr. leaves him and his mother to go back to Kenya, abandoning his family to pursue his own dreams. The young boy's search for the truth and story of his missing father--and the answers to his divided racial inheritance--makes for a powerful and compelling personal biography. <br /> <br />The book is partitioned into three parts, which trace, respectively, Barack's childhood and college years, his work as a community organizer in Chicago, and lastly his pilgrimage to Kenya to meet his father's side of the family for the first time. This tale of self-discovery is wonderfully honest and skillfully layered, and the author guides us through the story of his life with lyrical prose and a sure hand. Of particular note are Barack's extensive and thoughtful meditations on race--what it means to be white, or black, both or neither. \\"Perceptive and wise,\\" the blurb on the cover reads, and that's an elegant summary of the book's value. Probably most people have purchased DREAMS FROM MY FATHER to learn about one of the most exciting figures in politics today. And they will; but much more than that, too: for in many ways Barack Obama's journey is the American journey, his inheritance is the American inheritance, and his dream is the American dream. <br /> <br />The climax of the memoir occurs in Kenya when Barack comes to the graves of his father and grandfather, and, as he kneels before their cracked tombstones, finally reconciles the disparate strands of his complicated and tangled heritage. What begins as a personal attempt to understand himself becomes a moving and profound appeal for a renewal of the shared community on which human civilization was and is built: \\"a faith, so different from innocence... that pulsed in the heart of the first African village and the first Kansas homestead--a faith in other people...\\" <br /> <br />This is the vision at the heart of DREAMS FROM MY FATHER. For what has been lost in the past few decades is exactly the kind of shared faith, the shared assumptions that bind our nation together. What has been lost is the dream of one America. <br /> <br />And maybe, just maybe, Barack Obama is the one to lead us back there again. <br /> <br />Five stars.

B000K4WPCC|1.0|I heard from friends and family the movie wasn't any good.  I figured they couldn't appreciate the subject matter, as the plot sounds great.  Sadly, this was not the case.<br /><br />The plot of the movie made me want to see it, basically it revolves around the four sons of ipswich, whom inherited their powers from their family bloodlines.  They receive these powers at the age of thirteen in the form of a test.They can control gravity, command objects at will, and fight like Neo in Matrix.  The bad thing is, every time they use their powers--which are completely addicting, and high seductive, they loose some of their life.  Upon turning 18 they \\"ascend\\" and are giving their full power. This is the where most of their relatives have gotten in trouble, and quickly become old young-men as their bodies cannot handle the power.<br /><br />As stated, thats a great concept, especially if you enjoyed the novel \\"The Dreamcatcher\\" by Stephen King, which they give acknowledge too in the film, as their powers are based in part on that novel.  Where the movie falls apart for me, isn't the loose plot holes, its not the obsessive amount of tired horror cliches--girls in showers, lightening every few minutes, etc, nor is it the fact that some of the models look the \\"same\\"(multiple long haired models, that I at first had trouble telling the difference between two of the brothers and another character), it's the shoddy acting that does it for me.  I can understand they are young, and maybe the producers decided on Abercrombie models (they may or may not be actual Abercrombie models, tis just a cliched stereotype for a cliche inducing movie), opposed to real actors to further sell the movie, but I haven't watched a movie so dry in ages.  I watch low budget flicks, straight to dvd, and sci-fi movie of the week films, which is a round about way to say I can tolerate some bad acting, however, the acting in this movie makes even the worst of those seem almost Shakespearian in nature.<br /><br />The main actor is about on the level of an early Keanu Reeves at about 50% of the skill.  Thats to say hardly any emphasis on words, and very dry looks and extremely monotonous, it was really hard to watch. The only reason I completed the movie, was because of the amazing work done by the special effects crew.  Their work is top-notch.  Sadly I cannot say the same about anything else in this movie.  If you want to watch a good \\"occult\\" movie, watch \\"The Craft\\" or \\"The Lost Boys,\\" if you are an aspiring actor wanting to know how NOT to act, watch this movie, as you are the only person I can truly recommend this movie too.><br />The main actor is about on the level of an early Keanu Reeves at about 50% of the skill.

Guns, equipment, strategies, stories, everything presented in an interesting interview format that gives it a legitiment documented feel. If you are dissapointed with all the lame recent zombie action flicks like Resident Evil and Land of the Dead, then World War Z will be a breathe of fresh air-- a piece of zombie work thats done just right. 5 out of 5 because it sets out to do exactly what satisifes a zombie fan.

As usual there were top notch personnel backing him up, with Dave Grusin(piano) and John Pizzarella(guitar) among the notables.Also on \\"Baby its cold outside\\" Natalie Cole warms it up inside. The strings I could have done without. I guess thats why my favorite was \\"Auld Lang Syne\\". It being one of the few songs not backed by strings.But still it was a good album altogether. I would like to say that I'm disappointed the format of the CD was not HCCD. HCCD gives you much more detailed and true sound.

0618680004|3.0|Reading Dawkins requires a good deal of patience.  There just isn't enough time in the day to argue against everything he says.  The idea of \\"memes\\" as the cultural analogy to \\"genes\\" and the potential for a Darwinian type of explanation for why religion evolves is one. I haven't thought much about these things but Dawkins use of them doesn't strike me as particularly impressive.  But it is on the Religion and Morality thing that something HAS to be said.<br /><br />Dawkins, like most humanists, fails in his fundamental analysis of human nature and then seeks to discredit religion because it doesn't produce the utilitarian results that would commend it.<br /><br />Here is the simple argument.  Humanists believe that man is essentially a moral animal with a prevailing, though ill defined imperative toward that which we call \\"good\\" behavior.  Dawkins believes that this imperative is the result of Darwinian processes which have come about through the advantage certain gene-coded altruistic  behaviors add benefit to the society.  Like honey bees or other types of creatures (of which he gives examples) man, on the whole, has evolved with a tendency, a general inclination, toward doing good things - toward helping others, toward generosity, etc.  In short, man has an inclination toward nobility but it is in conflict with self-interest and therefore may not always be as strong as it ought to be.<br /><br />Dawkins phrases this imperative as a \\"lust to be generous and compassionate\\" so as to highlight that this moral sense is foundationally no different than the Darwinian advantage sexual pressures  impart to us.  But the bottom line is this.  Mankind is genetically disposed toward morality and toward a moral code which perpetuates the specie.  In his thinking, this disposition is toward a moral code that is good.  (Logically one could argue why a \\"good\\" moral code is inherently more advantageous than one which is not - an argument that has been advanced and answers given in other works.)<br /><br />One of Dawkins arguments against religion then is that it is not necessary for man to have religion in order to be \\"good\\", to be moral.  It is built into us.  We don't need religion to be good.  In fact, as he argues, there is no substantial proof that  high conditions of morality are ensured by a prevalence of religion at all, even in Christianity - a fact which all Christians deplore but do not particularly deny.  Hence, in Dawkins claim, there is no utilitarian value to religion because it does not, prima facie, conduce to morality.<br /><br />Like most humanists, Dawkins assumptions blind him to the facts.  Christianity does not state that the presence of religion in a community will make people more moral.  In fact, the Scriptures are very clear that the historical trend of the religious community (ancient Israel) was toward depravity in spite of their religion.  There is a reason why the last chapters of the book of Judges depict ancient Israel as being essentially no different than Sodom and Gomorrah.  There is a reason why the books of 1 & 2 Samuel, 1 & 2 Kings, 1 & 2 Chronicles tell of Israel's continued struggle with idolatry, perversion, murder, lawlessness, greed, etc. etc. etc.<br /><br />Christianity does not proclaim that Religion conduces to greater morality in the community.  Christianity explains why religion does not conduce to greater morality.  Christianity explains the facts of life and demonstrates the nature of those facts.  Christianity does not, contra Dawkins, say that there could exist a situation ( if every one were educated, culturally sensitized, enlightened) wherein police would not be absolutely necessary to impose standards of right conduct on people.  Christianity explains that police are absolutely essential, that they are in fact ministers of God, and that apart from them, lawlessness will abound.  Exactly what the facts Dawkins presents in his case studies (i.e. the police strike in Canada in 1969) seem to prove.<br /><br />Christianity does not proclaim that religion is to a utilitarian end - that the adoption of religion makes people more moral.  Christianity proclaims that men and women are fallen and that the depths of depravity are only a hair's breadth away from any person who is walking amongst the briars and thorns in this life.  All may fall.  Judas fell.  Peter fell.  Paul, as Saul of Tarsus, helped with the stoning of Stephen.<br /><br />The uniform proclamation of Christianity is that, at root, man is a sinner and that he is not essentially altruistic at all.  Altruism, where naturally present in a human being, represents a yearning for something lost that gets translated into deeds which give a semblance of comfort, a self-deluding moment of hope, that maybe it has not been totally lost after all.<br /><br />Man is not essentially good.  Man is essentially evil.  The only difference between a baby shark and a full grown Great White, is time and opportunity.  The basic disposition is the same.  The only difference between a baby sinner and a full grown pervert, is time and opportunity.  Christianity proclaims that the way you prevent baby sinners from fulfilling their potential to be full grown perverts, is by restraint.  It is restraint of sin which is needed.  That restraint comes in several fashions - it is through social mores and laws as well as by inculcating the idea that absolute justice is inevitable.  This does not mean that  people become more moral, more righteous, more good.  It means that they cannot act out their most evil impulses.<br /><br />The ancient Greeks knew something about this.  The had a word for it - paideia.  Christianity explains it fully and comprehensively.  Dawkins entire argument is reduced to smoke and mirrors.

B000E5N6LG|5.0|I bought this movie as a gift and it arrived packaged very well in perfect condition and with plenty of time for christmas! <br /> <br />
B00006LLNU|5.0|Well, since Texas is currently in the midst of an ice storm (yes, it does happen on occasion), what better time than to review Sigur Ros?  These odd fellows from Iceland make music that is tailor-made for the cold.  Huge, thick, spacious melodies, that perfectly evoke the icy winds of the north.  Now, while their music may be beautiful, it is far from accessible.  A lot of people, including many post rock fans, probably just will not get this.  The music is very minimalist, even by post rock standards, and the vocals are very odd and often atonal, and the lyrics are all sung in a made-up language that sounds pretty nonsensical.  However, despite all these things, this is something that, given the right atmosphere and occasion, can really hit the spot.<br /><br />As I said, the music here is very minimalist in arrangement.  There is none of the dramatic \\"rise and fall\\" that you get with bands like Godspeed You Black Emperor or Explosions in the Sky.  But, that's not to say that there's no buildup.  Instead, the entire album seems to build up as a collective whole.  The first four tracks are softer, more dismal, more subdued, and then in the second half of the album, the guitars, keys, and drums gradually become louder, creating an impressive albeit subtle crescendo.  Now, people have mentioned the parentheses of the album \\"title\\" representing the two halves of the album, but personally I think that's just people reading WAY too much into the title (the parentheses are most likely just a place holder for the fact that there is no title).  However, there is a definite division between the first and second halves, which you can clearly hear in the music.  Plus, track 4 has a few seconds of silence at the end, that seem to serve as a mini-intermission between them.<br /><br />For its 70+ length, this album never gets boring, even when you kind of think it probably should.  The songs all sort of fit together as one big composition (which I guess is why they have no titles), but my faves would have to be track 3, a beautiful piano instrumental; track 5, with its swelling organs that almost bring \\"Dark Side...\\" era Pink Floyd to mind; and track 7, with its monumental hugeness.  And as for the vocals, well, they're weird, but you get used to them.  In fact, I personally don't think you even have to like the vocals at all to get into this band.  The music is so hugely enveloping, it just completely overpowers them most of the time.  It's very easy to just forget they're even there.<br /><br />Anyway, this is a great album, despite the limited appeal that it may have.  Also, if I may rant for a moment, I resent the accusations of \\"pretension\\" that are often hurled at this band.  It seems like every band that's even remotely cerebral or experimental is automatically labeled as pretentious by someone.  This term is so annoyingly overused in criticising music, that it's practically becoming meaningless, especially since half the people who use it don't even seem to know what it actually means.  Pretension is a false sense of superiority, and listening to this album, I really doubt that these guys are making music to try to feel as though they're better than everyone else.

It could be just what you need for a dreary winter day.tles), but my faves would have to be track 3, a beautiful piano instrumental; track 5, with its swelling organs that almost bring \\"Dark Side...\\" era Pink Floyd to mind; and track 7, with its monumental hugeness.  And as for the vocals, well, they're weird, but you get used to them.  In fact, I personally don't think you even have to like the vocals at all to get into this band.  The music is so hugely enveloping, it just completely overpowers them most of the time.  It's very easy to just forget they're even there.   <br /> <br />Anyway, this is a great album, despite the limited appeal that it may have.  Also, if I may rant for a moment, I resent the accusations of \\"pretension\\" that are often hurled at this band.  It seems like every band that's even remotely cerebral or experimental is automatically labeled as pretentious by someone.  This term is so annoyingly overused in criticising music, that it's practically becoming meaningless, especially since half the people who use it don't even seem to know what it actually means.  Pretension is a false sense of superiority, and listening to this album, I really doubt that these guys are making music to try to feel as though they're better than everyone else.  They just wanted to do something different, and express themselves in a unique way, and I really don't see why that should be a crime. <br /> <br />Ok, sorry for that.  Anyway, give this a listen.

It is simple easy reading and most definitely CAN and WILL change all those lives that READ and APPLY this. It is what we are all SUPPOSE to know! Read it and take the time to really apply this and all that you want you will have and NOTHING will stand in your way other then YOU! This should be on everyones nighttable so when we stammer we pick it up and reread and APPLY it is THAT simple! It's not really a secret, it is WHAT is, we just don't take the time to make our lives more worthwhile. We are meant to.
B00006CXSS|5.0|Probably the best WWII War story written - For those that have been in the service, a movie that will bring back memories of seemingly unendurable times, endured with and by the help of fellow comrade's - And for those who haven't been in the service, an inside look at what made our countrymen so great during such a horrific time in our country's history -<br /><br />Band of Brother's - A story rightfully named - Hats off to HBO, Speilberg, Hanks, Stephen Ambrose and all the actors - But especially to the real guys - I've given away 4 copies of this Box set as gifts -<br /><br />Mike Haywood

B000E5KJHA|1.0|I must say that I really am angry that the HD DVD of this film had an audio commentary that the regular DVD didn't. I really hope it is just this one time and that this trend doesn't continue, because if it does, I and many like me are screwed
B000K7VHPU|5.0|I love period films and especially with a good mystery.  And this one is good, and as the story unfolds, you never know if its real or a trick.  The characters are perfectly selected for their roles which makes it all more believable.  Paul Giamatti rocks in this as he did in LADY IN THE WATER and SIDEWAYS. Edward Norton comes on the screen brimming with mystery.<br /><br />Sit back and enjoy a delightful story of what some people will do for love.
B000IONJH4|4.0|Whether you adore or totally disdain Dune( that's the kind of film ), the original movie from David Lynch, the hi def 1080p transfer really shines. The Universal compressor(s) that did the job really made it to be one of the very few pristine movies from the 80s comparable to video quality of newer releases being 5-10 years old. Interior shots are incredibly rich, detailed ( even revealing source focus and limitations, yet very occasionally ). However, some black spots, exteriors at night and special effects still show some grain and noise - but how to expect better from analog effects made then ?  <br /> <br />Sounds are OK, sometimes amplified through good bass effects ( like the thumper scenes ). Extras are on standard def, as for any catalog movie. <br /> <br />Dune HD DVD will most probably be the ultimate home version for the years to come. Highest recommendation possible, for fans of the film.
0679746323|5.0|This book is not only excellent for what you can learn about its specific subject matter, but also about the unbiquity in the west  of disinformation and \\"useful idiots\\" generally.  I wish every American would read it. <br /> <br />Caveat:  Like any exposition of history, the book contains some assumptions, inferences, and sources that may be questionable, unreliable, or incorrect.  But that in no way undercuts the overall value of this book for anyone who is capable of reading critically

B000J3EEBY|5.0|I am a huge Loreena McKennitt fan and was not the least bit disappointed in An Ancient Muse.  While there are some similarities to The Mask and the Mirror, mainly in the music on tracks 6,8 and 9, the entire CD is so good that the slight similarities have no effect.  The only way a Loreena McKennitt CD would disappoint me was if she abandoned her seemingly trademark sounds of Celtic and middle-eastern influences.
B000ICL3KG|3.0|The information that Al Gore gave the public was not as up to date as i had expected. <br />Alot of the information and pictures i had already seen on David Susuki's web site for 2002. <br />Although the overall information was good and in your face. What has happened since 2002?...that's what i would like the information to be more specific about. <br />It was to generalized, because alot of the proposals he made to help with climate change, we have been hearing about for the last few years.

B000J10ERO|1.0|Twice I've told Amazon's recommendation system I already own this movie, yet it kept throwing it back up as a recommendation. Then I check not interested. Still Amazon's recommendation system still stupidly recommends this movie. The movie sure isn't worth buying a second copy, so Amazon is wasting my time and their opportunity to actually recommend something I might actually buy. I've written them about this problem before as this is going on with about half the stuff they recommend to me. So far they seem to be unwilling or incapable of actually doing anything to fix the problem. I guess I'll go check out the B&N website, it can't be any worse.

0618680004|3.0|The book is a shot in the wrong direction. It is still another example of misunderstood religion. Nevertheless, I recommend it to all Christians, as it will help them test themselves. <br />Most of the critic is based on simple misunderstanding. Here is one example. The author says that you can not call a child a \\"Christian child\\", because children are too young to understand religion and so can not be real Christians. This is true, but the term \\"Christian child\\" in common talk does not mean a child that is a Christian, it simply means a child from a Christian family. <br />Richard Dawkins rightfully criticizes many texts in the Old Testament, but he forgets that the OT, being a set of novels on the history of Jewish people, does not represent the teaching of Christ. The Old Testament was written by colleagues of the same \\"scribes\\" with whom Jesus had a big conflict. As a scientist, Mr. Dawkins needs to define Christian religion first, and then criticize it. Today, however, many people view Christianity very differently, so a simple definition is hardly possible. Therefore, the passion wasted on the book is energy wasted in vain. Do not waste also your money to buy the book, just rent it from the library.

B000JU7NCE|3.0|This DVD is okay. I'm watching it on a Sony Bravia XBR2 1080i LCD and a Pioneer DVR-533H. It is really grainy most of the time. The actual film footage is not that good in comparison to the \\"Trilogy\\" which is short one star of being a five because it isn't in HD. A lot of the back lighting totally blinds out the band members at times. The night cameras were just not setup for going from really dark to blinding light.  The audio is good and plays awesome. It has a great song list of most of my favorite Cure songs. Not all the trendy songs like on most tours. My favorite album is Bloodflowers. I was kinda disappointed that there weren't any song off of this classic cd. That's okay there's plenty to make up for this. Overall this is still a good dvd for real Cure fans. It's pretty cool seeing Porl back and nailing all the songs. Even a few off of \\"The Cure\\" cd. What this dvd lacks in video it makes up for in audio. That's probably why the price is so low. Regardless it's still a good dvd to have in your collection. I'm glad I got it and I always buy whatever they dish out. Crank it up!
B000ICL3KG|5.0|An [...] Best DVDs of 2006 selection?  And well it should be!  This is a must see for every sentient being on the planet.    Al Gore has taken the scientific information on global warming and distilled it into an easily understandable presentation for the rest of us.    I recommend that you watch it, share it and think about what you can do to make a difference.
B00000253N|5.0|Dylan scored big on 'Blood on the Tracks,' perhaps the first of many comebacks. The subject matter of love gone wrong has been taken elsewhere, especially with his wild, majestic 'Blonde on Blonde,' but 'Blood on the Tracks' finds him in fine folk form, able to draw more from experience and quiet passion. The known songs are all great, including the mesmerizing hit \\"Tangled up in Blue,\\" the excellent and hypnotic \\"Simple Twist of Fate,\\" and the pensive \\"Shelter from the Storm\\". Less heralded are other great songs, like, arguably the album's best, \\"Lily, Rosemary, and the Jack of Hearts\\". Complete with a fine story and a rollicking accompaniment, \\"...the Jack of Hearts\\" comes up with aces musically and lyrically. Quieter moments are highlighted with the beautiful serenade of \\"You're a Big Girl Now,\\" which only reminds one in style of another classic \\"Just Like a Woman\\". There's also the acoustic ballad excellence of \\"If You See Her, Say Hello,\\" which is written like a letter to his lover's successor. Still, there are moments when qualified brilliance is present. \\"Idiot Wind\\" seems to gather more pungency from the delivery than the lyrical development. \\"Buckets of Rain,\\" which ends the album caps off his folk excellence. According to his memoir autobiography, 'Chronicles, Vol. I, Dylan wrote that he, to paraphrase, sabotoged his career to escape becoming a messiah. In the liner notes, he is defined as a \\"troubadour\\". Indeed, he truly found himself again on 'Blood on the Tracks'. Too bad he had to find love gone sour to find his true footing once again. <br />
0767827791|4.0|One of my all-time favorite movies, \\"Picnic\\" embodies what a 1950s director like Joshua Logan could do with the limitations put on him not only by the watchdogs of the film industry but also by the social contexts of the times. The setting of Midwestern Kansas smalltown is a perfect metaphor for the clash between the superficial, outwardly values of the times and the raw, below-the-surface desires and passions that must be kept in check. The clash between age and repression--beautifully depicted by Rosalind Russell--and youth and possibility--seen in the characters of Kim Novak and Susan Strasberg--is another refreshing insight subtly created by the script and the director.  <br />The 1950s shown in the film may have been repressive, but were they not a far gentler,more humanly meaningful times when the tensions of life were the sources of creativity and larger possibilities.

1400032717|5.0|Mark Haddon successfully enables the reader in remembering how it was to view the world through the eyes of a child--in this novel, through the eyes of Christopher Swindon, a 15 year old autistic boy, who is unable to lie and cannot understand metaphors.  Christopher reminds us that people believe in heaven and hell because they cannot reconcile the fact that we are all just temporary beings on the planet and that his favorite dream is one in which he is left on earth with no one other than special people just like him, and there is no noise.  Christopher's search for the killer of Wellington the dog, and ultimately for his mother, enable him to make the journey from young boy to a growing adult.
B00005JPDS|5.0|\\"You have to have money to make money.\\"  That's what they say, and, unless you're as determined as Chris Gardner (Will Smith), you don't have a chance.  Unfortunately, money does buy some happiness.  As Chris looks about the wealthy, he observes, \\"They looked so d---ed happy to me.  Why couldn't I look like that?\\"  His lot is to sell portable magnetic resonance imaging machines to doctors.  His prospects can be inferred by his description of them as \\"expensive...and only slightly better at creating images\\" than the ones they already had.  His wife, Linda (Chandie Newton) picks up the slack.  They have a beautiful, intelligent, inquisitive son, Christopher (Jaden Smith), whom they juggle from daycare to parent care, like many struggling wage earners.  She bears the burden as the chief wage earner, taking double shifts at the laundry, which can hardly be lucrative.  Her patience with him and the paper chase runs her ragged.  The IRS, the landlord, and the utilities all have a constant claim to their near future.  In the meantime, Chris gets an offer for the American Dream, a chance to be an intern at Dean Whitter, where, once accepted, bares a twenty-to-one chance of being hired after six months of grueling stock huckstering and hitting the books.  Like most people he wants a better life for himself and his family.  Remembering his own lot in life, he vows, \\"My children were gonna know who their father is.\\"  Indeed some of the father and son scenes show real love, even by a father who is frayed by the pressures to succeed.  Taking place in the eighties, Chris will try the impossible, aligning his fortunes like the Rubik's cube he sets out to master...    `The Pursuit of Happyness' pays dirt.  Every development along the way is absorbing from the first frame.  Always a stickler to detail, the beautiful background music and the well-chosen soundtrack are marvelous without ever making the film sentimental.  It's one step forward and two steps back.  This is true for Chris and the rest of us. Only the way it is revealed by Chris is truly a piece of work.  Chris tells his son, \\"Don't ever let anyone tell you, you can't do something...If you have a dream, you have to protect it...You want something, go get it.\\"  Inspiring for all of us, this film may sound off themes from `Death of a Salesman,' but the results and details are often desperate, but offer us all hope.  (Blog, if you believe feel-good movies are not all acts of plagiarism.)  Based on a true story.
B000C65Z1G|4.0|This movie and it's plot does not suprise me at all. It is no wonder why all of the drug companies are rich!!! And it is no wonder why the drugs are so expensive to those that do need them. Even if the person maybe/could die without them. You had better believe it that drug companies will go to any length to make that all mighty dollar. Yes, I know that drug companies will deny the side effects that thier drugs will cause. There are many out there right now that are fighting law suits because of deaths and serious side effects, but they have already made thier money. They will pay very little out for all of the money that they made. Yes, this movie is very hard to watch because there is a part of it that is very true to life. Yes, there are people that die in this movie to unravel the truth that is happening because of a drug's side effects are being denied. The plot is very real. The acting is excellent. This movie is not for the faint of heart. It is for those that want to know the truth in the \\"riches\\" of drug companies and what happens to those that try to tell the truth. I recommend it for all to see!!!

B000001GBJ|5.0|My husband bought me the \\"Songs From a Secret Garden\\" CD for Christmas this year and I absolutely love it!  I guess I would categorize the music as \\"new age\\" with a celtic flair.  It's so beautiful & relaxing that the songs feel as if they're touching your soul (an amazing experience)!<br /><br />I also found the liner notes to be very interesting.  They describe the thoughts/feelings behind each of the songs, as well as the meaning behind the title \\"The Secret Garden\\" - which ultimately has to do with the secret garden we all have within our hearts/minds - that place we go to when things get rough & we need some peace.<br /><br />Overall, I would highly recommend this CD to anyone who enjoys \\"new age\\" & celtic music, as well as those who are looking for a good CD to relax to.  Who knows, it may become one of your favorites too...

0618680004|5.0|I suspect many religious people will not read this book as they often fear critical perspectives.  However, being non-religious myself, I found the book fair minded from a scientific perspective.  Our society needs to realize when it has a bias towards backwards beliefs (e.g. racism, sexism, etc.).  What is often viewed as a liberal perspective today is typically viewed as common sense in hindsight.  I thank Dawkins for writing this book and helping bring more scrutiny to religion as there should be in the Information Age.
0679417222|5.0|You need to understand something before venturing into The Moonstone. It was written in the latter half of the nineteenth century. There was no television, no radio, no electric light, no Internet, no telephone. The most common forms of personal entertainment took place in the home, and the personal library, for those who could afford one, were common. The writing form of the time was designed to address this lifestyle. It was leisurely and pleasant.<br /><br />One might curl up in a blanket before a blazing hearth with a candlabra sporting a dozen candles for light and a novel. Dickens, Scott, Thackeray, Dumas? All delivered a pictorial style of writing where the reader filled in the images. To this list of familiar authors, then, add the name of Wilkie Collins a friend and sometime travelling companion of Dickens. Credited by some as the creator of the English language mystery novel, and police detective character in The Moonstone, Collins has a writing style that almost needs to be learned by the 21st century reader.<br /><br />The opening section of over 200 pages appears to be ponderous and wandering as the butler, Gabriel Bettridge sets the scene for the story. In doing so, however, Collins also establishes the first person narrative style that makes the novel work exceptionally well. Other reviewers here have filled in aspects of the story as a whole and I will refrain from repeating what they have said. The end note of the edition I own states that Collins is said to have written much of the book under the influence of opium, and perhaps that is why he was able to keep each character so true to life and with such a clearly defined and distinct \\"voice\\". Regardless, he succeeds in presenting a thoroughly entertaining tale, which must, ultimately, be read as though one were living in the late nineteenth century, devoid of twenty-first century \\"conveniences\\".<br /><br />Then one can comprehend why it is a masterpiece.
B0009IOR6Q|5.0|I first saw this a few years ago and was trying to find it again to buy and I couldn't find it. Finally I found it and watched it right off.

B00005JOCS|5.0|Plot Summary: A trio of black female singers climb from unknown status to stardom, and learn about life, love, and sacrifice along the way<br /><br />Reason for the Rating: Language, some sexuality and drug content.<br /><br />Wow. I had heard a lot about this movie before seeing it, watched interviews with the actors and saw clips and trailers, but all that did nothing to prepare me for this musical movie. Dreamgirls is full of amazing music, acting, and cinematography, and is a movie you don't want to miss.<br /><br />Dreamgirls is the story of three black soul singers in the 1960s who want to make it big. One night at a talent show they meet Curtis Taylor, Jr. (Jamie Foxx), a car salesman who wants to break into the music business as well. He not only offers to become their manager, but insists they become the new back-up singers for James \\"Thunder\\" Early (Eddie Murphy). The girls, Effie (Jennifer Hudson), Deena (Beyonce Knowles), and Lorrell (Anika Noni Rose) are thrilled to be back-up singers to one of the rising stars of R&B, but only take the job when Curtis promises to get them their own record deal as well.<br /><br />All is well until Curtis realizes Jimmy will never be able to cross over into pop music, as his style (think \\"James Brown\\") is just \\"too black\\" at this point in history. As a result, Curtis breaks the \\"Dreamettes\\" away from Jimmy and creates a new group, The Dreams, replacing plump and outspoken Effie as the lead singer with slender and gentle Deena. For the good of the group, Effie swallows her pride, until the group goes international, and then she just can't take it anymore, making life miserable for everyone. Against her desires, Curtis replaces Effie with a new Dream, Michelle (Sharon Leal). While Effie struggles for the next few years, the Dreams make it big, seeming to really be living the dream. But backstage, in real life, the dream of happiness is as elusive as sleep for an insomniac. Just out of reach.<br /><br />There have been movies made telling \\"rise to fame\\" stories of many musicians, both fiction and non (Ray Charles, and Johnny Cash just last year), but none have been told in the way Dreamgirls tells its story. Originally a musical on Broadway in the 1980's (interesting fact: the original part of Effie was written to be played by Nell Carter, until she left for Gimme a Break), Dreamgirls was adapted for the big screen, with four new songs added to the screenplay. The music and choreography maintain the feel of Broadway, but the cinematography is all Hollywood. The sets and costuming are beautiful, and the acting superb.<br /><br />What sets this movie apart from other Broadway musicals turned movie (ie, Chicago) is Jennifer Hudson. She has the most amazing, larger than life voice, and is perfectly cast as outspoken Effie. She gives life and personality to the three girls who make up The Dreams. As she draws you in, she makes you want to stand and cheer for her success. There is an old movie called \\"A Star is Born,\\" and that is what this movie is for Jennifer Hudson. If you want to see a star being born, go see this movie.<br /><br />In addition to Jennifer Hudson, Eddie Murphy is surprisingly great as Jimmy \\"Thunder\\" Early. Who knew Eddie Murphy could sing? And with a string of comedies behind him (Beverly Hills Cop, The Nutty Professor, and Shrek, to name a few), who knew he could act in a serious movie without one comic crack? He is convincing as this heroin-addicted, attention-starved, wife-cheating musician who so desperately wants success, but won't sell his soul for a few records.<br /><br />MOVIEBLOG RECOMMENDS:<br /><br />You will want to see this movie.

0307277887|5.0|If you thought you'd never want to read another serial-killer novel, think again.  Jeff Lindsay has crafted an enormously original and entertaining yarn featuring Dexter Morgan, a serial-killer who only preys on serial-killers.  Dexter's voice is humorous in a style reminiscent of Ignatius from 'A Confederacy of Dunces,' yet where Ignatius was ignorant of his faults, Dexter is hyper-aware.  The story zips along with lots of humor, some grisly killings, and a mystery that'll keep you guessing up until the end.<br /><br />I'm ready to read the next in the series!
B000ICLHIE|5.0|What a treat for the Tom Waits fan and also great as an introduction for the new listener.  As a long time Tom Waits fan, I was ecstatic to get a 3-disc set as a new release!  It features every facet that make up Tom's varied styles in music and vocal stylings.
B0007GAEGC|3.0|I discovered this group on PBS television and was awestruck with the quality of their voices.  I am not a fan of high sepranos, but these women have such a pure tone to their voices that I listen to them more than once a week.  Their performance on television was enhanced by the visual quality of their music.  I find it more entertaining than listening to them, but they are worth listening to if you have an appreciation for Irish songs.  People sold out to rock music probably won't enjoy it much.  Celtic Women has a different kind of energy.

It reminded me that I really do not know \\"where that has been\\" so to speak about arguably the most important topic of all... what goes in my body.

B000ICL3KG|5.0|Everyone owes it to themselves and to the future,ie. our legacy on this planet, to see this movie. Al Gore deserves an Oscar, for truly is it rare that a movie, even a documentary, can have this kind of impact on the planet, literally. If you are cock-sure that global warming is a myth, then your challenge is to see if you can make it through the entire movie and not change your view. Do what Wal Mart, Duke Energy, and now even Exxon Mobile has done, and recognize -- finally -- that there is no profit margin without a planet. And then go out and help change things while you can still be a part of the solution, not the problem.

B000H6SXMY|4.0|The show was popular and we are enjoying the series again.  Two problems with the DVD's. The music that accompanies the show sounds very sharp and liked coming from inside a can.  Also, the background laughter is too loud and occasionally drowns out the actors words. I would have expected more for the cost of $186.00.
1592400876|5.0|Lynne has written a marvelous book for all of us who love the world of punctuation and grammar. She fills her book with great British humor and wonderful examples of the good, bad, and ugly of punctuation usage. As an American writer I must remember her warning in the beginning of the book, indicating her use of preferred British punctuation usage to that of the United States. Setting that issue aside and keeping in mind the differences, I enjoyed the book immensely.

6305546789|5.0|This film is the founding father of the new modern generation of horror films. No poetry, no mysticism, no ideology, in one word postmodern to the core. The only objective is both to horrify and to terrify the audience and nothing else. John Carpenter uses the technology at his disposal in each film to create the atmosphere and to bring up the elements that are going to do what he wants to do : make the audience shake in convulsions of fear. In this early film he uses the new steadycam to make long travelling sequences that can be more natural because the camera is carried by a person walking the way it is supposed to travel. We then really have the impression of looking at the scene through the eyes of a living person. We are then inside the characters and their fear, whereas the criminal is a lot more steady, immobile, even still. Then the theme is supposed to bring up all our deep dark fears : a child of six kills his own sister who has just had sex, hence sex as the disrupting element that makes people crazy, insanity as the utmost strangeness that turns someone into something that is no longer human, a little touch of satanic evil, knives and Halloween of course. And it works particularly well when we can see the face of this criminal who is wearing a mask, a mask that is expressionless and absolutely colourless. We have it all and we know we would be frightened ****less if we had to meet him in the dark around some lonely street corner.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University of Paris Dauphine & University of Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne
B000GFLE1S|5.0|One of the best movies since Billy Elliot. A study of the personal development of multiple characters in the face of hard times (all with solid performances). An interesting story with great acting and nary a car chase or explosion or any bloody gore. In other words, Hollywood didn't make it.

B000ICL3KG|5.0|There are always two sides to every story - sometimes more than two perspectives are plausible.  If you don't get the message after watching this movie - WATCH IT AGAIN !  Then watch the sequel - Update - and then watch it again.  Each and every \\"responsible\\" citizen on this planet will find some (little or big) thing they can do to turn our path of destruction around.  The impact is long term, but it is also immediate.  Take a look around you now and see how things are changing - now.  It is not in another lifetime or generation - we are being affected - NOW.
B000K7VHQ4|4.0|The Illusionist is the kind of film you rarely see these days. There is magic when an audience fills up a theater and the lights go down to see an illusionist or magician perform magical acts.  This is a beautifully made film for pure entertainment.  What we see on the screen is of course not to be believed. The acts and supernatural occurrences as they occur before our eyes just could not be realized in such an era. It is pure fantasy but nevertheless we marvel at what we see. We want to believe in Eisenheim as a sorcerer and as hero for the fair maiden . The ending was not a surprise for me however I truly enjoyed this film. The accents of all the actors are just suberb. Thumbs up.
B00005JPGM|4.0|Set in 1999 in the war-torn African country of Sierra Leone, Blood Diamond delivers an adventurous, action-packed, and tragic tale of what people will do for the most expensive rock on the planet, the diamond.    Directed by Edward Zwick (The Last Samurai), and starring Leonardo Dicaprio (The Departed), Dijimon Hounsou (Amistad), and Jennifer Connelly (A Beautiful Mind), Blood Diamond is a satisfying but flawed thought-provoking film.    The story revolves around three characters, the Souith African ex-soldier turned diamond smuggler Danny Archer, played with flair by Dicaprio, the African fisherman turned diamond miner Solomon Vandy, played brilliantly by Hounsou, and the TV reporter who is looking for a killer story about blood diamonds Maddy Bowen, played by Connelly. While mining for diamonds under force of the Armed Forces, Vandu finds a 10-carat diamond, buries it, and is captured and thrown in prison. In the meantime, rebels attack the village where his family live kidnapping his son Dia in the process and turning him into a child soldier. Archer knows he found the diamond he's been looking for and makes a deal with Vandy that if he helps him find it, he will get his family back and split the amount between the both of them. He also makes a deal with Maddy that if she helps the two men get to their destination, she can write the story she's been longing for.    Blood Diamond isn't the best film of the year, but it has good performances of the cast, especially Dicaprio and Hounsou who could end up with Oscar nominations for Best Actor and Best Supporting Actor respectively, and an insight into a world of sadistic violence and treachery with an ending result of diamonds on people's fingers, which could turn people away from the traditional marriage proposals!    Recommended    B-
B000K7VHQ4|5.0|The Illusionist, starring Edward Norton, Jessica Biel and Paul Giamatti is one of the most beautifully crafted motion pictures that I've seen in a long time.  The photography, lighting, and set design bring together the look and atmosphere of Vienna at the turn of the century, creating the perfect setting for Eisenheim the Illusionist (played by Norton) to perform his miraculous tricks of magic.  Eisenheim returns to the city of his birth after a fifteen-year absence only to meet the love of his childhood, the Duchess Sophia (played by Biel) at one of his shows.  The love between he and Sophia is still alive, but she's now destined to marry the Crown Prince Leopold (played by Rufus Sewell) in just a few weeks, and Leopold is the type of man who would kill both of them if he knew about their secret passion for each other.  As Eisenheim becomes the talk of Vienna with his outstanding illusions, Leopold quickly learns about the connection between his fianc&eacute; and the mysterious magician through the investigations of Chief Inspector Uhl (played wonderfully by Paul Giamatti).  The Crown Prince becomes firm in his desire not to lose his fianc&eacute; to another man, especially one of low class.  If he can't have her, then no one can.  A tragedy takes place which forces Eisenheim onto a path of what appears to be self-destruction, or is it perhaps the greatest illusion of all as he seeks his personal revenge against Leopold?  This is the question that will have you glued to your seat in avid anticipation.  I was as surprised by the ending as Chief Inspector Uhl appeared to be.  I never saw it coming, which is somewhat unusual for me.  This was due to a well-written script and excellent performances by all the lead actors.  It's been a sincere pleasure to watch both Edward Norton and Paul Giamatti grow as actors over the last twelve years.  When they take on a role, they literally become the characters, and that's what great acting is all about.  They certainly succeeded in this film.  In fact, everything came together perfectly in The Illusionist: the strong direction and magnificent script by Neil Burger, the terrific acting by everyone in the cast, the superb photography and set production, and the great musical score.  Not only was this a great movie, but it's also one that will become a cult classic over the next decade and deservingly so!  Highly recommended to those who enjoy well made art films and dark suspenseful thrillersilm.

I bought the book for my 5, 7 and 9 year old children and the 9 year-old had already mastered all of the skills offered, the 7 year-old was bored very quickly and only the 5 year old's attention was held any length of time, but his age group lacks the concetration level to hang on for long.  The content was far too simple and barely progressed through the entire book...this book should be marketed to only highly introverted 4-6 year-olds in my opinion, and then it would get only 3 stars....

074356619X|5.0|This book is incredible. I saw the movie first and thought the information life changing. I let my 18 year old niece borrow the movie and it has completly changed her outlook on life for the better (took me awhile to get it back from her). So I bought her the book on cd for Christmas. It goes into the laws of attraction even more with more examples of how to apply these principles to your own life as is usually the case with books and movies. This book or movie is a must for everyone. Understanding that \\"everyone\\" may not be exactly ready to hear all of this, but to even just get the seed planted would dramatically change the world we live in. If more people could get and understand these principles we could see an end to ALL wars! Get the book, get the movie or get both just get the information and watch the life you have always desired unfold!!  ENJOY
B00003CX8N|5.0|If you like action/adventure movies do not buy this one.  But if you like true stories that are thoughtful and full of meaningful dialogue, this is for you. The performances by Hopkins and Bancroft are award winning and worth your time.
0618680004|3.0|Perhaps the most obvious thing that can be said about this book is that it is a \\"scattershot\\" critique of religion. In other words, Dawkins packs in a huge  number of criticisms, most of which are unrelated except for their conclusions (that religion is bad and/or false). A number of the more peripheral arguments have been soundly rebutted in Marilynne Robinson's review in the November 2006 issue of Harper's magazine.     Some of the peripheral arguments fare better. It is a good point that the reason Hell is usually presented in such strongly negative terms (extreme suffering for all eternity) is because people really don't think that it's likely to exist. If people felt that they would definitely go to hell if they behaved a certain way, hell would only have to be mildly unpleasant to keep them in line. Then there is Dawkins' discussion of parents indoctrinating their children into religion. I think most humane people could agree that this is disgusting, and I find it hilarious that most vehement religionists don't realize that they'd be just as vehement about a different religion if they were born somewhere else. However, I believe his criticism of the practice of referring to kids as \\"Christian children\\" or \\"Hindu children\\" does not succeed. Dawkins points out that no one calls the children of Marxist parents \\"Marxist children\\" or those of Keynesian parents \\"Keynesian children.\\" I don't really think this is analogous. Children of Christian parents, for example, are likely to hold some fundamental Christian beliefs. Young children of Keynesian parents probably don't have any beliefs about economic policy.     The criticism of those, such as Albert Einstein, who claim to believe in some vague \\"god\\" which is merely some impersonal force with no correspondence to the beliefs of any major religions, is excellent. Another of Dawkins' main arguments, that the existence of god is highly improbable (near impossible) doesn't really succeed. However, his point that when apologists try to argue that materialist explanations of life are improbable, they don't consider the probability of god, is correct but not very original.    Dawkins also argues that, while religion seems to fulfill certain needs that people have, the study of science could also fulfill these needs. In my view, the best critique of religion is still that of Karl Marx. To put it very crudely, Marx argued that victims of social oppression resorted to religion to make their lives more tolerable. In a sense, Dawkins' argument inadvertently confirms this. Due to the dominant social relations in the world today, most people simply don't have the option of engaging in a serious study of science.

The album's magnum opus (When the music's over) is too long for its own good.     Standout tracks:    -Strange Days.  -You're lost little girl.  -Love me two times.  -Unhappy girl.  -Moonlight drive.  -People are strange.    I give it four stars.
0060734191|5.0|Wonderful <br /> <br />A must read, one should not go through life without having read this trilogy.
015603008X|5.0|This fictional novel is truly inspiring from start to finish. Author Daniel Keyes builds the main character, a mentally slow adult named Charlie Gordon, as a warm and innocent person.<br /><br />Charlie's doctor consults him regarding the possibility of a surgery to improve his intelligence. He's instructed to write in a journal so as to document his improvement, if any. Thus, this novel is written as if it were Charlie's diary. Charlie undergoes the same surgery as an experimental lab mouse named Algernon, as this surgery had a very successful effect on Algernon. Slowly, his operation proves to have the same effect on him. He becomes extremely intelligent; first, his grammar and spelling are significantly improved in his diary entries. Progressively, his thoughts become deeper and eventually, his intellectual abilities are more advanced than even the doctors around him. He develops an \\"intelligence that can't really be calculated.\\" But it isn't all smooth sailing for Charlie. He's suddenly engulfed in strange feelings and situations unfamiliar to him, from remembering traumatizing events of his childhood, to feeling love and lust. He even begins to wonder about those who he considered close to him, seeing their \\"'phoniness and shallowness.'\\" It's a heart-wrenching and confusing roller coaster all the while.<br /><br />When Algernon's improvements begin to fail and his intelligence is fading, what will happen to Charlie? This poignant story will keep you interested and you'll feel the emotions coming from Keyes' touching words.
B000GFLAI0|5.0|Masterful. Buy it and listen to it a hundred times, and you might just start to hear the years of music crafting skill that BD has drawn on to create this wondrous disc. There are only a handful of acts who can boast of having the longevity of Dylan, but scant few of those (if that many) who could be expected to produce anything even half so tightly structured, yet sounding so effortless. You'll feel like you've been invited to take a long and destination-free drive into the night with Mr. Dylan, who obviously is very appreciative for your company, and is in a rare mood to talk. Beautiful, bittersweet, haunting and hopeful. Can you tell I liked it?
B000A6T262|5.0|When I saw that I can have all 10 trek movies for just over 80 bucks, I thought \\"Hmmm... this is too good to be true, maybe there not for region 1 for somethings wrong with the DVDs.\\" I bought them anyways and,I was amazed they were still factory sealed. This is a great buy.
B000GFLE86|4.0|Sounding slightly less self-assured than she did on her last outing, Careless Love, Ms. Peyroux still managed to capture both my ears and a good chunk of my heart with this performance. Overall the selection of cover tunes is a bit uninspired--until you hear the title song, penned by Leonard Cohen but brought into full dimensional and aching life by this singer's intimate interpretation. And added props to the wonderfully tight yet spare stylings of her backing band, who embrace--no, play--the concept that less most definitely can be more. An extremely solid outing here.
B000GRUS22|5.0|A Posteriori is better than Voyegur, the music is a mix of soft new age with alternative, the track \\"Dancing w/ Mephisto\\" is mesmorizing the guitar solo fits perfectly and the first track blends in with the length of the track. Michael Cretu really redeemed himself with A Posteriori because Voyegur was a disaster.
B000I5X81K|4.0|Like listeners above, I've listen to this CD 4 or 5 times now and am slowly liking more and more songs.  I would have to agree that it is definately a more contemporary sound than his previous releases.  More songs for the radio it seems.  I absolutely love 'Solo Por Ti', 'Un Giorno Per Nio', 'Lullaby', and 'Weeping'.  I'm sure in due time I will enjoy the rest of the songs as well, but my first impression of the albumn is a new age sound that doesn't seem to fit him.
B0007LCNKM|5.0|Yes, it's true, this band will change your music tastes. I think I can difinitivy tell everyone I know, and some that I don't, \\" are you ready to listen to some amazing music?\\". I know that this music hits me in some ways that not everyone will relate to, but, even the lyrics' subject matter is familiar ground, and always, I begin to reminisce, as if I have been listening to their music for decades; An old stand-bye. Yes, it's true, they are on my top five... You can mellow out, or rock out with your...-; With all the varying degrees of tones, from gently flowing and well- layered tracks. National newbies can start out with Secret Meeting or Daughters of the Soho Riots. Then, you will advance towards amazing emtional pieces like Val Jester or Geese of Beverly Hills. Okay, so you buy it, you love and are like what's next. Here's the good part;  <br />Their earlier album Sad Songs for Dirty Lovers, is at least three to four times better. Now you're glad I told you to buy it.ah-huh
0446672653|5.0|Having experienced something that can only be called a spontaneous past life regression, I found GREAT comfort in Many Lives Many Masters and Dr. Weiss' subsequent books. To have a prominent psychiatrist make reincarnation a credible topic, and remove it from the taboo topics list, has done a great service to humankind. His work enhances our understanding of the ALL or Infinite Divine or whatever you choose to call it. His work gave me the courage to start writing the Ancient Pact series.
B000F8O35U|5.0|I have this movie on VHS also. My husband bought me the remastered DVD for Christmas. Now I have both VHS and DVD but am keeping both because I love this movie so much. The scenes and the coloring have been remastered. What a difference. Disney did a BANG-UP job with this one. My 10 year old daughter loves this movie. We were watching it the other night and it is such a great movie. I love the story, and the underwater scenes. A REAL HIT.

I adore and love this movie. I have it on VHS and I'm thinking of purchasing it on DVD too so that I can have both. A real hard warming story. Some parts were sad but it ended happy which is what I love. I could watch this movie over and over again and never tire of such a great classic.

B000K7VHQE|1.0|There is NOTHING Sunshiny about this movie. First they overuse the F word, and I mean they OVERUSE it. The grandfather takes drugs and then overdoses, the son doesn't want to speak and looks dead. It's not what the movie trailers let you see.  It's NOT for Families....not even for adults. Not the worst movie I've ever seen but it rates DOWN there.  My DVD copy is FOR SALE!
B00003CXWV|5.0|I love this movie, but i was deeply dispointed about how I recoved two defective dvds with the same problem. This was not amazon fault, but the dvd company. i would not advise people in buying this verison unless you do not mind small defect which I do not like doing myself.
B000E1YVZU|5.0|I wasn't quite sure about RENT.  I have not seen in on stage and now would love to.  I loved all the actors and felt they were believable in their performance.  It's a hard one to describe.  In the FILM, even though they were all dirt poor, the second you came into their lives, you were \\"family.\\"  That was something striking about the film and I don't know why I picked that up.  I could identify with every single character.  You have to watch it with an open mind.  The other unexpected outcome of RENT:  I have an AUTISTIC 2 year old that will sit and watch the ENTIRE film.  The first time we put the movie on, he stopped spinning a toy he had been playing with and walked right up to the TV.  He sits in the bean bag to watch it.  He actually tries to dance when ANGEL dances.  He's interacting.  This is a huge milestone for someone who is autistic.  So you can see why RENT is an all around favorite of mine.
0691126658|5.0|everywhere you go in east africa you see birds. if you like them- you better be prepared for the trip! i got the guide a month before, and tried to get as familiar as possible with the birds before arriving to tanzania. <br />when we went on safari our guide pulled out his worn and faded zimmerman- the descriptions on one part, the illustrations on another and the distribution maps at the end. when i pulled my guide and gave him a try- he was very attached to his zimmerman but had to admit that the stevenson is indeed a worthy companion, with all the info about a species is on the same page... <br />compared to my european guide it is heavy and big- but the european contains only about 750 spp, while this one has more than 1200!  <br />the illustrations are bright and clear. <br />i used it during my 30 day trip to tanzania and got more than 200 positive identifications, so i must go again to get the rest... <br /> <br />recommended!

0060899190|5.0|i just got back from seeing him at borders in torrance and all i can say is WOW.  i've followed the website forever and now own all 3 books, all of which are simply breathtaking. what he's doing for the global community as far as raising awareness about suicide and depression is simply amazing.  if you can, i encourage you to buy this book and support 1-800-suicide.  and if you ever had any doubts about frank warren's legitimacy, there's no need because he takes the most humble approach to this project in that he takes basically no credit for its success.  he honestly believes that its people like you & me, whose courage allows us to share our deepest darkest secrets, that make this project what it is today.

1400044162|5.0|I have just finished reading Half of a Yellow Sun. I thoroughly enjoyed this book.  The characters were interesting and the writing was excellent.  I became attached to the characters.  I did not know about Biafra and have learned so much from this fictional novel which included so much history.  I enjoyed having Ugwu as such a pivotal character through which I could see this world.  I continue to discuss this book and would love to see this story continued.
B00003CWPL|1.0|I can understand where people come from trying to say that it is brilliant in it's symbolism, but in all reality this is not a movie that the general audience would want to sit down and watch on any normal day. The movie leans too heavily on the symbolism, which just leads it to be disturbing and awkward. Most of the movie I was so anxious or disturbed by the images or long silences that I had to take a break. I had to look up the meanings behind the complex symbolism before I got what ti was tying to do, and found that it wasn't nearly worth the agony I went through in watching it all the way through. It's sick and boring.

B000JJRIN4|3.0|I was so psyched to get this album. I love all of Gwen's and No Doubt's music. But I have to say, this was not as good as I thought it would be. I only listen to 4 songs on the album. Most of the other ones sound very unfinished and like they just put some demo stuff on there. #1 is the biggest hit off it and #7 is pretty cool. Those are my favs. I'm such a fan I'm still glad I got it just so I could have those 4 songs.

0739413937|4.0|I read this a few years ago because someone I was visiting had it in their apartment. At one point Kiyosaki says that rich buy assets and the poor buy liabilites. Basically an asset pays you without you doing anything - for example interest from the bank. Likewise a liability takes money without you doing anything. (Although he does point out that in the case of a house and a car both require continuous money for up keep but may be needed for other reasons.) For me assessing whether I was aquiring assets or liabilities was a breakthrough in how to look at things. I'm not rich and unlikely to be so (which I'll get to next paragraph), but it has very much helped me to clarify how I think about spending.  <br /> <br />Kiyosaki also gives advice about specific types of investment strategies. Many of them take more daring than I have (and that's why I will never be rich although with longer term planning I will likely do OK). However all are based on the same strategy of aquireing assets. Which goes into why reading the book might be good even though I just gave the big secret away. For example in speculating in real estate Kiyosaki is especially clear on an asset being something that you don't have to continually manage. In this case have someone else who is unclogging toilets for your tenants. Treat this employee well and tip your broker and generally pay attention to and be generous with people who are part of your assets.  <br /> <br />Basically this is a good book to clarify your strategies involving money. Even if you are cautious like me it is helpful in terms of helping you clarify how you think about money. I don't think it can make you \\"get rich quick\\" but it is still very good to have read it. (4 stars not 5 because the specific investment strategies aren't for my personality)

043957773X|5.0|Coraline is the story of a girl named Coraline who lives with her work-at-home parents. The family has just moved into an apartment in an old house. During the day, when her parents are working Coraline goes exploring in the neighborhood. One rainy day she explores the apartment and finds a door which sometimes opens onto a brick wall but sometimes leads to an apartment similar to her own but more colorful. Here her \\"Other Mother\\" is an excellent cook, her clothes are more stylish and fun and everyone pronounces Coraline's unusual name correctly. Before she realizes it Coraline is trapped in the other apartment with her Other Mother and the situation is not all butterflys and rainbows as it first appeared to be. Coraline must use her ingenuity to set things right and return to her own apartment.  <br /> <br />This was a pretty good read for me. I'm young but living on my own, so I'm much older than the target audience. The language was simplified a bit much for me. Everything Coraline does is broken down and simplified. Obviously it was written that way to be accessible for children, but I think it will bother other adults too. The story was good with nice visual flourishes and a cohesive plot.  <br /> <br />The major strength that I found in the book is the contrast between kindness and love vs possessiveness. The Other Mother is out to please Coraline, but for her Coraline is more of a doll. She insists that Coraline stay with her, and when Coraline chooses not to it turns out that Coraline didn't have a choice as far as the Other Mother was concerned. The Other Mother plays with Coraline and pays attention to her as she would to a pet and it becomes obvious that she will discard Coraline once she looses interest. In the other apartment the situation gets more obviously sinister the longer Coraline has been there. The Other Mother and her possesiveness contrast with Coraline's parents who are preoccupied with other things and don't pay much attention to Coraline.The lack of attention gives Coraline a chance to be independent and go exploring (although her parents are aware of where she is they aren't watching her all the time). As Coraline realizes during the course of the story, the lack of attention doesn't imply a lack of love. As she considers ways to outsmart the Other Mother, Coraline remembers how when she was younger she and her father walked into a wasps' nest. Her father told her to run ahead and stayed behind for a little while so the wasps would sting him not her.  <br /> <br />Another streangth is Coraline using her smarts to fight magic. In the other apartment things are very different. Animals talk and buildings and people can change shape at the Other Mother's whim. Coraline trys to find rules in this world to outsmart the Other Mother. I found Coraline to be a satisfying heroin. She has a balanced personality and isn't all smiles all the time.  <br /> <br />I would recommend this book. If the promotional material sounds interesting to you, then you will probably like the execution.
B000002UAX|5.0|The sound quality is so much better on the CD than the original album.  You hear things that you didn't know were there. <br /> <br />Go ahead and keep your old album for nostalgia, but when you hear the CD, you won't play the album again.

B000J10EQU|4.0|This was a good movie but it wasn't great.  To me there was so much potential with this movie but it didn't quite make it to the screen.  To its credit though it was an enjoyable movie I just think that it could have been a really great movie.<br /><br />Brandon Roth does an excellent job as Superman.  His angst over Lois, his battles agains Lex are all very genuine performances.  I think he fit the part of superman perfectly.<br /><br />The person whose role I was let down the most with is Lex Luther.  Kevin Spacey is a fantastic actor but his Lex was more deranged then mad  genius.  HIs plot to use Krptyon Crystals to grow land in the ocean was just absurd, there was no end of the world feeling to it. I felt more could have been done with Lex or some better plot could have been thought up.<br /><br />Kate Bosworth as Lois was just ok.  I think any pretty young starlet could have played Lois and no one would have noticed the difference.<br /><br />Although it may seem like I have more negative to say than positive about the movie, it was a good movie.  I was just expecting a lot more and didn't get it.  It is sad that the movie didn't do well b/c I feel with more Superman movies there was real potential to have a really good sequel.<br /><br />The Dvd: I watched the bare bones DVD version.  I take it there are so many versions so you will have to buy the deluxe special edition to even get a few special features.  This version had NONE.
B000E5KJF2|5.0|First of all this is a great movie that many people overlooked, but should definately be seen. Second, the HD DVD version looks great and is one of the higher quality HDDVDs I have seen so far. And finally the movie can be watched in both HDDVD players and normal DVD players. So in conclusion if you own a HDDVD player you owe it to yourself to buy this movie, to add it to your own growing collection of HDDVDs.
B000002BYA|4.0|Live at Carnegie Hall is a must-have for the diehard SRV fan who wants to get a taste of the guitar master's live perfomance electricity.  I purchased his Live Alive CD prior to this one and was somewhat disappointed (Live Alive was recorded at the depths of SRV's drug and alcohol addiction and lacked the luster and originality of his previous works). <br /> <br />This, however, was a real treat. His torrential solo on Dirty Pool and collaboration with his brother, Jimmie, on Things that I Used to Do were  flawlessly executed and super-charged.  I am always amazed at how he could bend and twist notes in ways unheard of, but these two songs were absolutely mind-boggling. <br /> <br />The second half of the CD, where SRV adds the Room Full of Blues horns and Dr. John on keyboards, was a pleasant surprise. Initially, I was skeptical, thinking it would be like \\"gilding the lilly, but it's a great R&B sound that every SRV fan should experience. In addition, Angela Strehli was outstanding on her fiery vocal on C.O.D. <br /> <br />The only issue that prevented me from giving this a five-star rating, is the muddy sound on the first two or three songs (Carnegie Hall was originally designed for acoustic performances). Don't let this stop you from adding this one to your collection, though. <br /> <br />
B00005JKES|5.0|OK, so now that \\"Season 2\\" is finally released, where did season 1 go?  Is this some cruel joke?  Will it be re-released in the spring when season 2 debuts?

B000HCO83Q|4.0|I have seen all three of the x-men movies. I like this one and the frist one the best.  This movie was packed with alot of action. The characters<br /><br />are great as usual. I have always felt they could possibly do a little<br /><br />more with the characters than they do. The cast does a great job with what<br /><br />they are given to work with. This movie keeps you on your toes with all of the action that is packed in it. It was great fun to watch. If you love x-men and mostly want alot of action. This movie could<br /><br />be for you. But it's not a acadamy award winner.
B000BTJDGC|5.0|This is a great movie I thought.<br /><br />I would have liked to watch it again so I could write a better review.<br /><br />However last night the creatures started making these weird sounds because they knew I had watched the dvd.<br /><br />Then I get that all too familiar feeling of a strange fear that strikes to the bone.  Even the slightest noise scares the living hell out of me and my heart rate increases dramatically.<br /><br />That's when I know 'they' are around.<br /><br />So I had to throw the dvd away this morning as I suspected I was probably going to have to even when I bought it.  I can't keep materials like this around.<br /><br />There's some numerology in the movie.<br /><br />When the exorcist asks the deamons what their name is it justs counts from one to six.  This is telling me that the number six is indeed evil as is indicated in the book of Revelation.<br /><br />It's probably better this way.  People should never say the real name of a deamon.<br /><br />The deamons also say they had entered Cain, Judas, and Nero.<br /><br />The deamon said its name is \\"the one who dwells within' or something like that.<br /><br />Then they present the story in a court room setting where the prosecution tries to look at everything from a strictly medical, scientific viewpoint (similar to The Exorcist).<br /><br />Another key event was someone who was present during the exorcism starts getting that weird feeling like something is wrong.  I don't want to ruin it but just let me say he doesn't make it.<br /><br />Then there's that mysterious hooded black figure.  Once you see him you're in trouble.  He's a direct disciple of Satan.<br /><br />Jeff Marzano<br /><br />[[ASIN:B00004WLUB Horror Hotel]]

B00005JPAD|5.0|Set in Boston, the film begins as crime boss Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson) takes a young boy under his wing.  Flash forward 20 years and that boy--Colin Sullivan (Matt Damon)--is now a man.  Her works in the Boston police department as an informant for Costello.  Knowing that he has a rat in the department, Police Captain Queenan (Martin Sheen) assigns Billy Costigan (Leo Dicaprio) to go undercover: to wash out of the force, commit assault, and go to prison with the intention of getting recruited into Costello's criminal organization when he gets out.  Costigan does of course work his way in...leading to a fast paced game of cops and robbers, as both sides try to find the leak in their organizations before their own guys gets nabbed.    To begin....I really enjoyed this film.  I was on the edge of my seat for at least 90% of the movie.  It's got an impressive ensemble casts.  Dicaprio gives one of the best performances that I can remember, and it's great to see Jack Nicholson as a real bad guy again....The movie has great acting across the board.    Some reviewers have complained that \\"The Departed\\" isn't as ambitious as some of Scorsese's other works, such as Goodfellas. Raging Bull, etc.   The fact is that this film is not trying to explore any complex philosophical themes--that's not the goal here.  With this movie, Scorsese was just trying to remake a fast paced, sophisticated crime thriller.  And at that, he's succeeded on all levels in my opinion.  One of the only real criticisms that I'd be able to agree with is the significant role that coinicidence plays in the plot of the film...such as the criminal and police mole fallling in love with the same woman.  But overall, I think this is destined to be a classic in the crime thriller genre.  I highly recommend it.
B00021HBGS|4.0|These tub stickers were a Christmas '06 gift for my 2 yr-old son who loves playing in the tub and he loves trains, cars, etc.  At this stage, he mostly just plays with a few of the vehicles (not the roadways included) but I see him graduating toward that in the next year or so. There are lots of pieces included in this and a nice mesh bag to store them in to dry.  They stick well to the side of the tub and are thick enough to last a long time.
B000I5X81K|3.0|This CD is an eclectic mixture of songs from lyrical melodies to more contemporary songs writen by Josh. I'm sure Groban wanted to get away from the tried and true semi-classical lyrical songs that he is famous for.  However, I wanted more of the tried and true. The three Spanish numbers were melodic and wonderful.  The two with Ladyblacksmith Mambazo were great as well. The more modern songs had many minor chords, and had no resolution and not much melody. I frankly felt that they were boring and uninspiring. That comprised more than half of the 12 songs

B000BTC5LW|5.0|Ok so we're missing Mr Waters - but I really couldn't tell. Dave Gilmour has to be one of the greatest guitarist's living - the solo on \\"Comfortably Numb\\" is simply stunning. Floyd's other numbers come across fresh almost as if years and years of heavy handed and relentless over play on classic rock stations haven't quite ruined them yet. Great production, fantastic lights and a great CD. Well worth it.
B00005JNS0|5.0|Got it for my son for Christmas.  He absolutely loves it.  Good movie for adults as well as kids.
1401302378|5.0|There are so many things I like and admire about this book. Here are just a few:<br /><br />1. It has a beginning, a middle, and an end. Unlike best-sellers like Freakonomics and The Tipping Point, it is not just a collection of anecdotal incidents with potential explanations. It is a complete theory of what's going on with Internet retailing. It all hangs together.<br /><br />2. It is well-illustrated, not only with word stories, but with graphs, charts, tables, and other aids to understanding.<br /><br />3. It is extremely well written and understandable.<br /><br />4. It is very timely. As an author in \\"the long tail\\" myself, I appreciated the up-to-date examples and the seamless way the author moves between classical economic theories and the most modern hypotheses.<br /><br />5. The narrative moves readily from chapter to chapter, building the case for the author's theories and explanations without any jarring jumps or gaps in logic.<br /><br />I could go on, but you get the idea. I recommend this book to anyone who is trying to understand how and why the Internet is changing the world of production and retailing in so many niches, not only that it is changing them.
B000002GK1|5.0|I started out as a casual Soundgarden fan. In fact, the only way I knew they existed was that a sound clip from the beginning of \\"Nothing to Say\\" was included in Encarta 98's \\"Rock Music\\" article, and it sounded awesome.<br /><br />A few years later after hearing Spoonman and Burden in My Hand, I decided to pick up their A Sides album, mainly because it's the only CD of theirs readily available that has Nothing to Say on it. I liked the other songs on A sides but wasn't satisfied, so I picked up Superunknown and that was a nice mix of heavy metal and pop. Not really a headbanger, I wondered if I could handle this album.<br /><br />The short answer is yes I can, I might even like it more than Superunkown, but it's definitely not the Soundgarden album to start out with. Chris Cornell's voice on this album is amazing. His ability to scream through songs is so great you wonder how it hasn't given out on him completely.<br /><br />If you're wondering whether to get this because you liked Superunknown, know that Badmotorfinger sounds nothing like it. It's carried mainly by Cornell's vocals.

0800141660|5.0|I was happy to have received this movie promptly after ordering it. The film is cleverly written with good script and has interesting camera angles in each scene.  There is also a lovely soundtrack to compliment it. I like the movie better than the book. I had seen it many times before, so I had to own it for myself.

B000J103YI|5.0|The soundtrack of Dreamgirls came to my house in great shape and in a timely manner.  I gave it to my teenage daughter for Christmas but I have to admit I have to listen to it as well.  It is fabulous!  Amazon made ordering so easy and economical.  Everything came in on time and I was very pleased.
B000DWMN2S|4.0|Great acting! Elijah Wood nails it every time. Eugene Hutz is also quite loveable in this film.  The only drawback I have is with the editting.    At the most poignant moment of the story, I had to pick up the remote and rewind a few times to figure out what I missed.  The key scene in the movie started off right with an explanation and then switched to a flashback, but I was thrown off by a confusing figure in the background.  Who was the girl with the basket?  Was it sister A or sister B?  One reviewer mentioned that Shreiber's less-is-more approach served him well in this movie, and I completely agree.  However, with this particular scene a little \\"more\\", might have been helpful.    In the special features, there are 7 deleted scenes labeled \\"additional scenes\\". Minus the first and the last deleted scenes, all the other ones could have been left in the movie to give the film that extra comic punch. They were great! The journey itself is a little wacky anyway so might as well make it as humorous as possible.  Therefore, when it does start to get serious, the poignant moments sink in much more meaningfully.      I also would avoid watching the trailer since it gives the story away with a key frame.      Not bad for Shreiber's directorial debut.  He's got great potential.  I like his unique less-is-more approach, but not all of it has to be less.  Excellent use of lighting for intimate scenes.  He's got a hell of an eye for cinematography.  Overall, an A-.

1563890410|5.0|After reading all of the Sandman collections, \\"Season of Mists\\" is with out a doubt my favorite.(it's also the first one I read) \\"Season of Mists\\" begins with a family meeting between Sandman's family \\"The Endless\\". During this meeting Sandman's older brother, Destiny announces that he has recently been visited by the fates. He says that the fates told him that \\"Something IMPORTANT will happen. Something that sparks a chain of events, causing much change and upheaval\\" Sandman's sister death then asks \\"And what is that occasion?\\" Destiny simply answers \\"THIS meeting that is all. The rest is up to you\\" After these statements Destiny's prophecy quickly unfolds when the family sits down to dinner. Sandman's sister, Desire attacks Sandman by opening an old personal wound, his past love life. If you read the books prior to \\"Season\\" you'll discover that Sandman sentenced is old flame, Nada (a formed African queen) to the tourments of hell because she refused to give up her mortal life to be his queen. Insulted by Destiny, Sandman storms off to sulk outside on the balcony. Death later comes out to give Sandman a royal tongue lashing (one of her shinning moments in the seires)and tells him that what he did to Nada was selfish and wrong. Sandman soon realizes that is big sister is right and he sets off to free his former love. Sandman and Lucifer(the lord of hell) have some bad blood(established in prior chapters) and when Lucifer is informed that Sandman is comming to his realm, he says that it is a day that they will both remember. When Sandman arrives in hell he is surpized to find the place empty. Lucifer soon greets Sandman to tell him that he has quit his job, let every soul free, and has decided to give the key for the gates to Sandman. This is where the true conflict of 'Seaons\\" starts. What is Sandman to do with this new realm? and with all of hell's souls now free, Where is Nada? Sandman soon finds that his troubles have only begun when gods and godesses of new andold flood his realm to lobby for posession of the key to hell. Who will Sandman choose and how will he save Nada when a powerful demon holds her for ransom? \\"Seasons of Mists\\" is the best written and most exciting chapter in the Sandman collection and one of the best graphic novels I've ever read. If you're a Sandman fan you MUST read this book. read it!
B000HEWEJO|4.0|I have always loved this film and am very pleased to finally own it.  This timeless story has all the elements needed to satisfy any movie-goer. Love, morality, hope, fear, helplessness and empowerment - pretty much all the possibilities we can encounter in real life.  The biggest lesson, that every person makes a difference in this world, is a relevant message in any era.
B0000069NM|5.0|I have always liked Medeski, Martin, and Wood but am quite sensitive to two downsides of them: (a) they often go way too \\"out there\\"; and (b) they often seem to jam for jams sake - no structure. As for Scofield - well - I've never really liked him. His style is generally too \\"noodly\\" and not driving enough for me.  <br /> <br />All of these flaws are amply erased - and all members' strongpoints are intensified - with this recording. MMW makes Scofield \\"hip\\" and Scofield reins MMW in. The combination sounds not like a trio +1, but like a quartet who has been together for ages.  <br /> <br />The dlisc starts off strong. The first few tracks balance grooviness and melodicism very well (check out tracks 1 and 5 particularly). This is not to say that the rest of them are not good as well, but that these are the particular standouts.  <br /> <br />Really, the only complaint I have about the disc is that it can be monotonous as there is not much stylistic variation (especially in the drums and bass). But a few listens will lessen the monotony as the ear picks up the subtle differences in the tunes and enjoys Medeski and Sco's outstanding soloing.  <br /> <br />Just this year, the quartet released an album AS a quartet - Medeski, Scofield, Martin, and Wood. While this album has Scofield's name on it, I prefer to see them as a quartet that cannot  be reduced to 3+1. These guys should play together more often!

B000EHSVQ4|5.0|This is an epic film.  Sit back and enjoy Ridley Scott's complete vision for Kingdom of Heaven: not an expansion of the movie you saw in the theatre, but the movie has he wanted you to experience it.  I was enthralled, very satisfied with the complete story lines that had been so fragmented in the commercial release.

B00011F5DK|5.0|I read the reviews and chose this game accordingly.  Thought it a little pricey, but found BLOKUS to be well worth the cost!

0446677450|4.0|Some reviewers are missing the point here and giving this book a harsh undeserved rating.   <br /> <br />The most important message of this book is this:   <br />    The poor work for money.  The rich make their money work for them.  <br />That is it.   <br /> <br />I grew up with the mantra: <br />   \\"Go to school.   <br />    Study hard.   <br />    Get a good job.   <br />    Make a decent salary.\\"   <br /> <br />That is not the rich's mantra: <br />   \\"Own assets that make you money.\\"   <br />Simple concept.  Difficult to accomplish.   <br /> <br />Clearly Kiyosaki has been lucky - right time at the right place.  But, he has taken risks and if you don't buy a lottery ticket, you are never going to win.   <br /> <br />I didn't read anywhere in his book where he says that you need follow in his footsteps.  He provides examples of what he as done to get rich.  But he doesn't advocate a particular avenue.  At least that is how I read the book.   <br /> <br />Don't get me wrong.  This is not a 5 out of 5 book.  But, it is a solid 4 out of 5 and worth a read.  It has opened my eyes.   <br /> <br />...If you are comfortable with your 9-to-5, solid middle class lifestyle maybe you shouldn't read the book.

B0000DEMRQ|5.0|I must have loaned this CD to someone. I have all of REM's major releases, many of the hits and b-sides, a few boot legs, etc. I saw REM at a 400 seat venu and a 30,000 seat venu and a few in between.<br /><br />I know this album is a bit over produced considering murmur and reckoning, but I still love this album.
B000I5X81A|2.0|As much as I like J.J. Cale and, of course Eric Clapton as well as the players on the session...the CD just didn't swing...no part of it. Audibly it was all good. It was just bland.
B00005YU1O|4.0|I bought this film based on the reviews I read on Amazon. I wasn't sure I would enjoy the animation style and I didn't know anyone who had seen it. I ordered it on an impulse and it has proven worthy of the purchase price. The film seems to jump around randomly and the topics presented are just as random. I found many of the topics far removed from my own interests, but just enough of them hit me with great impact. In certain ways it will remind you of \\"What The Bleep\\"  As far as enjoying the animation, I can't say I love it. A great quality of this DVD is that you can play it and just listen to it and it still delivers. I think anyone who takes time to watch this film will find at least one thing to truly challenge their thinking. I am thankful for the scene selection menu so I can jump to my favorite chapters. I stop short of five stars because the menu seems to take a long time to generate and each jump from chapter to chapter takes a considerable pause of music playing and repeated graphics popping up before you can actually select. Otherwise, thumbs up!
B000028U0Y|5.0|A great album to be sure, and a great place to start for any Johnny Cash fan.  But you need to go further into his later career with 'At San Quentin' and 'The Essential Johnny Cash', to name but a few. <br /> <br />Good stuff...
B0000AQS0F|5.0|To begin off I never saw the series when it was being aired on TV. I was wanting to purchase a good DVD Series because regular television has become really dull. It's almost as if the world has ran out of songs to write so they keep playing the same song over and over. I first got clued into Firefly because of all the positive reviews that I found all over the web, especially at Amazon. The price was great so I gave it a try. My girlfriend and I just finished off the series about 2 weeks ago and television just isn't fun anymore (not that it was before). I have to agree with the die hards, this series should have never been taken of the air and the smart TV executives should be researching opinions like ours and know that they have a winner ready for the taking by bringing this series back. If you've never seen the series before you're really going to appreciate the stories that come with this DVD set. The writers do an exceptional job by doing the unexpected. It's fresh air compared to today's TV. It's Sci-fi, Western, but it's also humanity in a way that we can relate to without justice having to be politically correct. You'll become acquainted with the characters very quickly and actually miss them when you're done with the set. My girlfriend mentioned today that she misses them, they were like her buddies lol.
B0009MAO46|5.0|This movie is a classic and should be owned by everyone. Adults will enjoy this movie and will be your children's favorite. Be prepared to watch it for 3 weeks straight.
0316172324|1.0|Gladwell writes in an engaging manner, but his methods are suspect. Thousands of psychological experiments are conducted each year at universities around the world in an effort to advance knowledge. Cherry-picking the ones with broad appeal and presenting them (out of context and without mention of their methodological constraints) is just plain wrong. Fine for a superficial understanding of certain topics. Read Roy Baumeister for a better integration of experimental findings and real-world concerns.<br /><br />Note to Gladwell: psychological questionnaires are not \\"highly respected\\", they are either valid or not, that is they either adequately measure the targeted psychological characteristics or they don't.

B000HT386M|2.0|The idea was great, I grant you that, it always was.  I've never watched anything so pointless and such a total waste of time.  Long, unfunny, and unrelentingly down beat. A bad, bad movie, really bad.  Here are some things that are not funny; heart attacks, divorce, manipulative bosses, losing years of your life, the grim reaper. It just goes on and on. It is hard to describe how poor and predictable this movie is. It does not do justice to Sandler's mediocre talent and abuses the greater talents of the actual actors in this movie. Again this is a bad movie with no redeeming features whatsoever. A very big disappointment for anyone looking for a comedy of any sort.  It is NOT like Bruce Almighty. Sure, we'd all like a remote control that controls the universe, right? But this one starts screwing up way too early in the movie, turning it much too quickly from \\"wish fulfillment\\" to slightly depressing nightmare.
B000K7VHQ4|5.0|Now this is the kind of movie that I hoped \\"Lady in the Water\\" would be: Magical, mysterious, incredibly stylish. One of the best movies that I've seen in years.<br /><br />\\"The Illusionist\\" takes a number of chances that shouldn't work -- How many great movies about the turn-of-the-century Austro-Hungarian Empire are there? And when's the last time there was a truly great movie about stage magic? -- and makes them all work. It even puts a former teen star/sex symbol in the leading female role and then shoots (almost) the entire film in sepia tone and with an early 20th century film vocabulary.<br /><br />It shouldn't work, but just like the tricks of Eisenheim the Illusionist, it does, and you find yourself marveling at the results. I don't want to give away too much of the plot -- its twists and \\"I can't believe he's doing that\\" element are a great part of the fun -- but Edward Norton portrays Eisenheim, a stage illusionist whom fate and the forbidden love of a duchess (the surprisingly believable Jessica Biel) puts on a collision course with the violent and amoral crown prince of the empire (Rufus Sewell). The movie is a cat and mouse game between the magician and prince, with the wonderful Paul Giamatti (playing a role very unlike his normal nebbishes) caught in the middle.<br /><br />\\"The Illusionist\\" gets the strongest possible recommendation for all audiences. (Even the sex scenes are 1920s fade-out tasteful.)

Steven Pressfield has been there and done it (the hard way )and has got through to the other side,which gives his words credability.When I finished reading the book I felt that I had a much better understanding of what it really means to be truly  committed to your art ( whatever your art happens to be) . Resistance is strong and continually keeps you from creating. It's a book I would recommend to anyone.

0679746323|4.0|In contrast to the theme of several of the posted customer reviews, I would not classify this work as either a waste of time or a hopelessly flawed attempt at biography.  However, it is certainly a book written with a distinctive viewpoint.  From the first chapter until the last, the reader confronts a life-story of an individual who was truly single-minded, without any apparent moral code and an unquenchable thirst for power.  It is a story told well. <br /> <br />The work has extensive notes and references; however, due to the nature of the subject and the language barrier, I think few are qualified to assess the sufficiency and merit of the citations. The book is an \\"untold story\\" so the number and sufficiency of citations from a totalitarian state may be an unrealistic expectation. <br /> <br />Chang and Halliday have presented a unique assessment of the life of Mao who unquestionably influenced the flow of human events, world history and the Chinese experience in the twentieth century.  Although long dead, Mao's influence continues in the modern life of China.   This biography, like that nation-state, is complex.  This book is certainly a departure from the routine political leaders' biographies, authorized and unauthorized.  Insights are provided that can recast the \\"common understanding\\" of Mao's direct involvement on topics as varied as the Korean War, the Soviet-Chinese relationship and the Cultural Revolution. <br /> <br />In a period of a growing importance of the People's Republic of China, this book will certainly add to a reader's knowledge of one of the more interesting individuals of the modern era.  <br />
0743298020|4.0|Beautifully and elegantly written. A mystery you can't put down. After I learned the ending, I started from the beginning and read it all over again. Gave this book to every reader I know for a Christmas gift. I listened to it on CD as well and the reading is magnificent.

B00000612G|5.0|I imagine nobody would buy this album without knowing of Richie's work in Bon Jovi. That fact alone saddens me for a few reasons. For one, this album sounds SO little like Bon Jovi's work (it's calm, bluesy, beautiful, and introspective rather than big, catchy, dynamic, and hook-filled) that I can imagine many fans listening to this album - expecting Richie's guitar-oriented take on Bon Jovi's sound - and being thoroughly disappointed by how little it sounds like their expectations. <br /> <br />Two, this album is easily as good - if not better - than anything Bon Jovi's ever done. And while I might get grief for that statement alone, I say that being a HUGE Bon Jovi fan myself who owns every album and would proudly say that I enjoy their post-90's music perhaps even better than their glory day music. But the fact (or rather my strong belief) is that this is one of the best journeyman albums ever, and vastly underrated. Somewhere in the vein of GOOD classic Clapton without the overdone, tired blues scales and Bruce Springsteen without the lyrical/storytelling density.  <br /> <br />This album also shows Richie's wide ranging influences and effortlessly shifts moods and styles throughout. Made In America is a very strong acoustic opening. Sounding somewhat like Springsteen lite (not in a bad way) with strong, story-telling verses and chorus and subtle, twangy, chiming Telecaster (Richie's main guitar on this album) accompanying him in the background. Hard Times Come Easy is one of the most bluesy songs on the album. But bluesy in a very upbeat, catchy way with alot of short, sweet Telecaster licks and an excellent, catchy chorus. <br /> <br />Fallen From Graceland is one of the beauties of the album. A slow, calm introspective ballad featuring a lovely sustained organ (I think) in the background and some great, subtle guitar and drum work over Richie's hypnotizing vocals. Richie does something very smart on this album which is vary the tempo from song to song. Goingfrom the slow crooning of Graceland we head right into the upbeat, tongue-in-cheek If God Was a Woman. Featuring some more cool Tele strumming from Richie with a harmonica taking the lead and some of Richie's best lyrical work on the album (if you're in the mood for something kinda funny). This is also probably the most classic blues sounding song on the album. <br /> <br />All That Really Matters is in the same vein as Graceland. A ballad like love song. It's a good song, but not the best on the album. In fact, the album only bogs down a bit at this point with a string of decent to mediocre songs. You're Not Alone is different and quirky, with a cool sounding vocal effect and an effects laden guitar. It's catchy and different, but doesn't fit with the rest of the album. It It For Love and Chained are perhaps the two most mediocre songs on the album. Actually, both are pretty good songs, and it's surprising that songs this good represent the WORST of an album. <br /> <br />But then comes the supreme beauty of the album. Perhaps my favorite song ever written by anyone with Harlem Rain. This song is just a stunningly beautiful piece of music and song-writing featuring some exquisitely gorgeous acoustic guitar work by Richie with another sustained keyboard/organ sound in the background. This is also perhaps the darkest song (from a lyrical/tone perspective) on the album. Talking about the pain of being beaten down by life:  <br /> <br />\\"In your search for tender mercy, no one seemed to care, <br />The faith that used to be your crutch, is now your cross to bear. <br />You lost yourself so long ago, you don't know who to blame,  <br /> <br />Harlem rain, coming down.  <br />Another shattered soul in the lost and found.  <br />One more night on the streets of pain,  <br />getting washed away, by the Harlem rain.\\"  <br /> <br />This is actually one of the few songs that have ever made me cry. And even today after hearing it a ton of times I can't help but get chills listening to it. <br /> <br />Going from the saddest, most beautiful song on the album right into the heaviest, hardest rocking and perhaps most self-affirming in Who I Am. This is a 7 minute behemoth of a song showcasing Richie's excellent electric guitar work. The song builds and builds perfectly through calm verses, tension building bridges, and an excellent chorus into Richie's best solo breakout of the album. <br /> <br />If \\"If God Was a Woman\\" is the most classic blues song in an upbeat sense, Downside of Love is the most classic blues song in a downbeat sense. It has some love and heartbreak lyrics, some cool, bluesy licks with soulful vocals and delivery into perhaps a slightly bland chorus, but it's still a really good song. <br /> <br />The title track closes the album in an superb way. Starting out with Richie muting and up-down picking the E string on his Tele in a really cool, building rhythm until the drums start coming in to build up to the verse. The opening guitar lick/melody to the song is one of Richie's best ever. A subtle string of notes so telling in detail they're practically a lyrical verse themselves. The drumming continues through the verses where Richie tells one of his best stories on the album until diving into perhaps the best chorus on the album. This is an anthematic song that walks the line between upbeat and downbeat perfectly (not just with the music, but the lyrics too): \\"When you walk that road. You walk alone, just an undiscovered soul in the great unknown.\\" <br /> <br />More than anything I think this album leaves the listener with a sense that they've just been through one of life's little journeys. Through good and bad times, Richie takes you through it on the album. Musically, it's much more diverse than most of Bon Jovi's stuff. Even though it's NOT original in any way, it doesn't have to be when the songs are THIS good and album is THIS consistently strong. <br /> <br />It's kind of a shame Richie released his two solo albums(this one and Stranger - which is also excellent) at the time he did. Had he released these in the 70s, 80s, or even now when people are getting back to wanting something new and different and retro rock is coming back in style, this might've been more of a success. The 90s when it was released was just an awful time for anyone NOT wearing flannel and practicing their angst ridden poses and lyrics in the mirror. Anything even remotely upbeat, with different styles and flavors and influences was doomed to be a failure in this \\"It's either black or black\\" time. <br /> <br />It's telling that Bon Jovi finally shot back into the mainstream post-90s with songs from Crush and Have a Nice Day. Had either Richie or Jon (who's solo album is also very good but VERY different) released their solo work now I believe it would've worked more. <br /> <br />On a side note, I can't recommend Richie's other solo album, Stranger in this Town, enough. It actually has several stand out songs which equal his best on this album (the title track, Ballad of Youth, and One Light Burning especially). While Stranger is more directly blues oriented and features better guitar work than Soul, it also bogs down toward the end while Soul is consistently strong and more varied. <br /> <br />In closing I can't do anything but wholeheartedly recommend this album enough. I know it won't change the fact that it was pretty much a commercial failure and only a handful of folks will ever really listen to this album and love it and enjoy it like I have, I hope anyone who reads this can be convinced to give it a try.
B0009UC7QQ|5.0|I just saw this movie last night with some friends.  MAN was I blown away, this is now one of my FAVORITE Jim Carrey movies.  This was well worth the $7.95 I payed for it at a local Wal-Mart.  So, if you've not seen this movie, do yourself a favor and rent or buy it.
B00006J9OV|5.0|Parsifal is my favorite of Wagner's music-dramas.  It has the most of all of them - Parsifal incorporates Catholic, Buddhist, and mythical themes into an overwhelmingly beautiful story infused throughout with a sense of devotion, piety, and worshipfulness.<br /><br />The recording here is very good - Levine and the Met Opera Orchestra are in fine form as always.  Siegfried Jerusalem makes a great Parsifal, Bernd Weikl makes a fine Amfortas (though I like Jose van Damm under Karajan better), and Waltraud Meier brings a wonderfully sensuous quality to the role of Kundry.  Kurt Moll really steals the show though as far as singing is concerned, with an incomparable portrayal of Gurnemanz.  The only complaint I can make about the singing is that Franz Mazura sounds really, REALLY old and doesn't successfully bring off the role of Klingsor.<br /><br />The staging is very traditional - which seems to be hard to find these days - and the video quality is very good.  The DVD menu allows for selections of running subtitles in several languages, including English.

B00005JPAM|4.0|for helen mirren, as always, her performance in this movie was absolutely great; but for the real queen, this movie seemed to try quite hard to get a hidden agenda delivered: trying to white out and white wash this cold, tough, self-centered egoistic tough cookie queen bee, wanted us to tolerate and to become more understanding to her imperial arrogance.<br /><br />her monarch is a appendix that the british people tormented between love and hate. having this monarch, the english people could differ and differtiate themselves from the other countries, to show other people that they are different, they still have a strong genealogy back to the old old time, even they might all admit privately  that this monarch is just a symbol, a tradition, a necessary evil. unlike the outcast run-away americans who got nothing but civil war, civil right movement, assassinations, mafia, riots, lobbyists, lying presidents and self-serving congress... trying so hard to dig into the short 200 some years history, only found there's not much to boast or to glorify. but on the other hand, they resent this monarch, resent their forever aristocratic luxury living style, collected tax from the common people before, exempt from paying any tax now, estranged from the daily struggles of the common majority.<br /><br />this movie somehow tried to tell you, as your queen, i still have to deal a lot of difficulties, to burden a lot of must dos and must not dos.<br /><br />but if you could stay more alert and focus during watching this movie, another hidden message was buried and exposed very subtle:<br /><br />queen elizabeth morned the death of that magnificent deer more than the death of diana, the shameful mistaken marriage of the monarch.<br /><br />she shared more emotion and empathy to the death of a reindeer than the death of diana.<br /><br />to her ex daughter-in-law, queen elizabeth's husband showed the real feeling toward her death: \\"served you right! thank god, finally! your death was a god send! finally we could put the shame and humiliation behind the monarch and move on!!\\"<br /><br />queen elizabeth would rather rush to show her sadness over the death of a magnificent beast that roamed in her 40,000 acres private territory, she would never, if not forced by the poll, shed tears over the loss of her ex in-law.<br /><br />yes, she still got feelings and concerns, but like she said, she'd rather keep for herself or only gave a little bit away to a wild animal instead of to a beautiful human being.<br /><br />\\"give my congratulations to your guest. nice shot, good hunting...\\" of course, visiting a dead animal, she didn't have to wear in black.<br /><br />as to the movie itself, well, actually, it's quite boring.put the shame and humiliation behind the monarch and move on!!\\" <br />queen elizabeth would rather rush to show her sadness over the death of a magnificent beast that roamed in her 40,000 acres private territory, she would never, if not forced by the poll, shed tears over the loss of her ex in-law. <br />yes, she still got feelings and concerns, but like she said, she'd rather keep for herself or only gave a little bit away to a wild animal instead of to a beautiful human being.  <br />\\"give my congratulations to your guest. nice shot, good hunting...\\" of course, visiting a dead animal, she didn't have to wear in black.  <br />as to the movie itself, well, actually, it's quite boring.
B000001F9E|5.0|While this is certainly a great album by Thin Lizzy, containing perhaps their 3 best songs (\\"Jailbreak\\", \\"The Boys Are Back in Town\\" and \\"Cowboy Song\\"), I don't agree with most of the other reviews that this is their best album.  Don't get me wrong.  This is a superb hard rock album without any filler, just good songs start to finish.  But, the album that preceded this one, \\"Fighting\\", is the one I would consider their absolute best album.  I owned both vinyl copies and they both got worn out on my turntable.  But, it was \\"Fighting\\" that first turned me on to Thin Lizzy.  If you like \\"Jailbreak\\", you have to do yourself a favor and purchase \\"Fighting\\" also.  Two great albums by one of the best rock bands of the 70's.
B000GCFO0I|3.0|I am a HUGE fan of Christophe Gans ( he is not only from the same town in France as me, but I have been following his career since Crying Freeman and le pacte des loups), and am an even bigger addict of the Silent Hill games. I own all of them, as well as their soundtracks. I play them over and over again, and will continue to be a die hard fan for the rest of my life.<br /><br />With this beinmg said, there were certain elements of the movie that I did not like.<br /><br />For example, I LOVE how they did Pyramid head, but did not like the ( SPOILER) scene where he ripped the chick's skin off; Pyramid Head in the game is much more about presence than him actually being a slasher ( though he carries a mean sword). In the movie, it seemed like they just wanted some shock value and so put that seen in ( and the chick that plays the girl isn't that good).<br /><br />Also, the plot really does vary from the original game, and I did not like how Alyssa's mother was not the bad person, but was sort of 'gray' and not 'black'. Christabella was the villain ( and was well acted, and so was Deborah Ungar, but still). This was irritating, and on top of that the cult Christabella was a part of differs from the cult at the root of Silent Hill.<br /><br />Look, Radha mitchell was great, and the rest of the cast as well. But something was missing, and I think that it was because of how the script differed from the game.<br /><br />The scenary was fantastic, but they didn't visit many of the Silent Hill's many stores, historical points, etc.<br /><br />I just wish that the director would have encompassed all that I mentioned!

B0002Y4TOM|4.0|Gilmore Girls returns, this time with a more seasoned cast, and the addition of a few more characters such as: \\"Jess,\\" Luke's delinquent uncle and more appearences from Cristopher, Lorelai's ex.<br /><br />I particularly liked the relationship between Dean and Rory, and I was pleasantly suprised to see the eldest Lorelai a trifle less of a motormouth this season. As usual, the Gilmore's parents, the French concierge, Luke and some of the other townsfolk were excellent.<br /><br />I admit I'm not a huge fan of Christopher (Lorelai's ex), and I just don't see any chemistry between him and Lorelai. I also don't like the character of Jess as I find him rather irritating. He does stir things up, however.<br /><br />4 Stars. Entertaining fun.

B000JJS8TM|5.0|WOW!  The first time I listened to BECAUSE I had goose bumps.  Many of the songs have been blended/melded in a delightful way.  I would have enjoyed even MORE creativity with more of the songs as well.  Compared to most of the stuff that is on the airwaves today, the BEATLES' music still has that rare gift of being able to uplift the listener, with a sense of joy and hope. Yeah, yeah yeah!  Maybe all we really DO need is 'LOVE' after all!!
B00005JL0I|3.0|This is a movie for when you want to give your brain a break and just sit back and laugh.  Shallow plot, skimpy special effects, and just dumb humor.
B0000AQS0F|4.0|This was a soap opera that happened to be based in space with a western country atmosphere. The ensemble cast reflected various viewpoints as to motivation and theme. Most of Joss Whedon's projects try to reflect a multipe viewpoint perspective. Every character is more apt to be developed rather quickly and evenly among the other cast members. Even the non-recurring characters are developed and explained more than many successful or continuing series develop their main stars. Unfortunately, in regards to the time the programming networks were willing to test market the series. They deemed review of insufficient audience market share by the sixth or seventh episode. Therefore they killed the show. <br />The sad truth of the matter is Mr. whedon's style of writing requires a long development cycle. The initial release of the show already foreshadowed its demise. I could see it coming. Joss was successful in his other projects because in the Buffy series, a market was built in. <br />The movie was out and comics and industry talk was about. The Angel series was an offshoot of Buffy and therefore characters and plot were also known and no initial building of an audience had to be grown. <br />All the characters were highly interesting and could be developed in so many ways. Themes in morality, moral or amoral, degrees of right and wrong, the depths of psychology as to class structure and what needs and wants determine what is ultimately the necessary way to do things. If you notice I didn't say the Correct way,Proper way, or Morally right way. If you are starving, what counts is getting food. If the future is unclear then you go where the wind blows. As Nathan says \\"I got no rudder, Wind Blows North, Then I go North. <br /> <br />I enjoyed this series for its understanding of lives interconnecting with various motivations and goals unique to each character. Also I regard his filming, editing, continuity, and single camera angles and techniques superb and above par in comparison to most other shows and movies. <br /> <br />In summary - This was a successful but very short lived show. The possiblilities were endless. <br /> <br />Sincerely,  Ferdinand Turla <br /> <br />

B00009Z576|4.0|The answer is of course no.  <br /> <br />Never the less, Trevor Horn does a fine job on this the most controversial of all Yes Albums. He even succeeds in sounding quite similar to Jon on 4 of the 6 tracks. <br /> <br />The overall sound of the album I would describe as somewhere between Tormato and 90125 - with touches of both. A driving 80's rock sound, yet distinctively Yes. Downes does a serviceable job on keyboard, Howe is strong on guitar, but Squire & White steal the show. I dont think the Yes rhythm section ever sounded better. Squire in particular is both clean and dynamic - he's right in the drivers seat. <br /> <br />Of the 6 tracks my favourites would be the 10 minute, 3 part Machine Messiah - which moves from heavy metal through driving power pop with some gentler keyboard sections along the way. Plus Tempus Fugit, which features one of Squire's finest bass lines. Of the other 4 tracks, White Car is a short synth ballad & Does It Really Happen, In To The Lens and Run Through The Light are generally up tempo 80's rock tracks. <br /> <br />Of the 10 bonus tracks the 4 \\"Paris Session\\" demo's (featuring Anderson/Wakeman) are an interesting insight as to where the band was heading post Tormato. I also found the Howe/Squire/White frantic jam session; \\"Have We Really Got To Go Through This\\" extremely pleasing. <br /> <br />Drama may not be classic Yes, but it is certainly an enjoyable album, and well worth a listen. <br /> <br />
B000K4X5XA|5.0|CONSIDERING THIS IS PART OF THE SUPERMAN RETURNS SERIES I WANTED THE PICTURE QUALITY FOR PART ONE TO BE THE BEST THAT IT POSSIBLY COULD BE AND IT WAS WORTH IT.  IT MADE PART ONE LOOK LIKE IT WAS MADE IN THE 90'S AS OPPOSED TO THE 70'S.  IT WAS SHARP AND THE COLORS FROM HIS OUTFIT REALLY CAME OFF THE SCREEN.  THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST COMIC BOOK MOVIES EVER AND IT LOOKS GREAT ON BLU RAY.  ALSO, THIS IS THE EXPANDED VERSION AND NOT THE THEATRICAL VERSION. I PREFER THE EXPANDED ANYWAYS.  PICTURE AND SOUND IS AMAZING.  I DEFINITELY RECCOMEND THIS.

B000F1IQN2|1.0|...Not sure Spielberg actually had anything to do with it...it is that poorly filmed, that clumsy, that over-bearing and ham-fisted. It is also amazingly boring and way, WAAAAAAAAAAY too long....    I found myself looking at my watch, counting the minutes until it was over, it was that awful....I consider myself to be a fan of Mr Spielberg's work, but this one felt like he phoned it in...    Very, very disappointing, and whatever moral dilemas he was trying to explore here was done with such sledge-hammer subtlety as to be almost insulting in their obvious and deliberate nature.    The acting was dreadful, the accents were atrocious, the cinematography was slap-dash and the story unbelievable....And worse of all, in the end I just didn't care about the characters, or what happened to them.    I wouldn't have thought it possible that Steven Spielberg would make a movie about such an important and world-changing event and completely muck it up, but he has.    Very, very disappointing indeed.

0385121679|4.0|The Shining is a Stephen King classic from what I think of as the \\"golden years\\" of King--the early (and in my opinion best) days of his writing career. Recast twice as a horror movie (once by the legendary Stanley Kubric, and again in the 1990s as TV movie with rather less success), the book is actually a thoughtful if somewhat macabre look at addiction.<br /><br />In his introspective memoir On Writing, King intimates that The Shining is really a book about alcoholism, not only because the main character, Jack Torrance, is a recovering alcoholic but even more dramatically because of the myriad subtle and not-so-subtle signs of addiction that he begins to display during his family's sojourn at the Overlook Hotel. The brilliance of King's writing is such that the reader is drawn fully into the story even while being taught subtle lessons about the nature and consequences of self-destructive behavior.<br /><br />Between the book and the movie, much of the plot of The Shining is familiar to many people, even those who aren't familiar with the story itself. References and even caricatures in TV shows such as The Simpsons have driven the story of The Shining deep into today's popular culture. One-liners from the movie like \\"All work and no play make Jack a dull boy\\" or \\"Here's Johnny!\\" add to the book's not insignificant literary influence.<br /><br />Jack Torrance, a formerly abusive recovering alcoholic, gets a job as the winter caretaker of the Overlook Hotel, high in the mountains of Colorado. Due to its strategic placement deep in the formidable Rockies, the hotel is inaccessible for much of the winter, when snow clogs the mountain roads beyond a point where navigation is possible. Jack, his wife, Wendy, and their son, Danny, will be stuck alone in the Overlook for a minimum of three months.<br /><br />This, however, does not perturb them in the least--at first, anyway. Jack plans to use the time to finish work on his play, Wendy is glad for the down-time after a harrowing series of family mishaps, and Danny is excited just to be with his parents in such a beautiful place.<br /><br />But once the hotel's employees and guests have all gone, strange things begin to happen. They start slowly. A wasp nest inexplicably fails to respond to poison gas. A fire hose in one of the hallways seems to be rearranged slightly. Eerie noises resound just at the edge of consciousness during the long winter nights.<br /><br />As the winter storms buffet the hotel's huge windows night after night and snow piles up outside in drifts twenty feet high by day, the hotel's strange ministrations intensify. Soon Jack begins to exhibit some of his old drinking behaviors--even though there's no booze in the hotel. Danny sees alarming visions in some of the rooms. And Wendy begins to fear for herself and her son as Jack slowly falls deeper and deeper under the evil spell of the Overlook.<br /><br />The term shining refers to Danny's uncanny ability to see future events, intuit his parents' thoughts, and communicate telepathically with Dick Hallorann, the Overlook's kindly cook who shares the same abilities. Simply put, the \\"shining\\" is really extra-sensory perception (ESP). Interestingly, Danny's shine actually has little to do with the story itself. It comes into play primarily as a means of foreshadowing, and the premise is certainly intriguing. But the real story revolves around Jack and the way he allows the hotel's dark influence to take over his life.<br /><br />Characteristically for King, The Shining contains quite a bit of offensive language and some explicit sexuality, so it's not for all readers. But quite aside from the entertainment value, which is high, this book provides a depth of insight into the very real horrors of addiction that could only have been plumbed by a combination top-notch author and recovering addict, as King has admitted he is. With the qualifications I would insert into any recommendation of a book by this author, I wouldcommend this book to anyone who has read and enjoyed other books by Stephen King.author, I would commend this book to anyone who has read and enjoyed other books by Stephen King.

0618477942|4.0|Despite her Athena-like beauty and wisdom, The Stern Librarian is of mortal father born.  Therefore, I was greatly moved by this complex exploration of a father daughter relationship, rendered in words and drawings.  It is the story of the author's discovery of her identity as a lesbian at the same time that she learns shocking secrets about her father, who in short order commits suicide.  From his daughter's lovely black, white and teal-green drawings, Bruce Bechdel looks like a cross between Woody Allen and Hank Azaria's character in The Birdcage.  Bruce, his daughter writes, was more Martha Stewart than Jimmy Stewart.  Much of the complexity of this memoir is acquired from its literary allusions.  Father, an English teacher and mortician, and daughter connect through books, a \\"cool, aesthetic\\" bond which was, alas, all she had in a home where dad treated his antiques like children, and his children like furniture.  Who more than the Stern Librarian would love all the references to the Fitzgeralds, Proust, Joyce and Wilde?  My eyes grew misty behind cat's eye glasses when I read that Ms. Bechdel derived the courage to come out by the books she discovered at her public library.  But as much as I appreciated all the literary connections, it was really the character of the father, that lover of Chippendale furniture and the Chippendales, which captivated me.  Why did he chose to marry and have children, why did he live in rural Beech Creek, PA rather than a big city, why did he hate himself so much?  Bruce's passion for creating a faultless world, and placing his wife and children in that stage set, struck me as the same striving for parcosm that fired Walt Disney and led to the creation of Disneyland.  You will wonder along with his daughter how Bruce would have fared had he lived past 1980.  The Stern Librarian (I will never be plutoed).     <br /> <br />
B000HEWEEE|3.0|The best way to enjoy The Lake House is to turn off your left brain. Completely. Get all those pesky left-brained thoughts out of your head such as:    * If Kate is a busy doctor and the Lake House mailbox is the only portal to the future, how does she keep getting over there to stick letters in the mailbox?  * Why do Kate and Alex see the flag go up and down, but never the mailbox door open?  * Why does one of them always seem to be right at the mailbox to retrieve a letter immediately after one is placed in the box?  * How do they end up having these seemingly real time conversations on park benches and in the hospital lounge area, given that the mailbox seems to be the only time portal?  * If Alex planted a tree in 2004, how the heck could a tree suddenly appear in Kate's 2006 time line out of nothing? Wouldn't it have been there the whole time? And isn't it amazing that Kate would happen to be there to witness it as opposed to not being there or worse, standing on the exact same spot of ground only to be catapulted up in the air on the tree branches?  * Granted these guys are star-crossed lovers with a temporal problem, but don't either of them take any interest in the 2004 lotto numbers and best stock picks?  * And how the heck did both of them end up with the same dog? When the dog wanders over to Morgan, Morgan doesn't try to return her and Alex doesn't try to get her back? Don't even wonder about this one, because you'll never get your answer.    Forget about the temporal anomalies (even for this story) and plot holes the size of a Buick. Concentrate on the acting which is quite good, particularly by the dog (seriously, the best canine actor I've seen since Lassie and the dog in Frazier) and Keanu Reeves, who provides a very convincing portrayal of a man in love with a woman he can't meet because she's in the future. I was *far* more convinced he was in love with the Sandra Bullock character than Diane Keaton's character in \\"Something's Gotta Give.\\" There will be slow parts in the movie, but if you're a heterosexual woman or ... man, feasting your eyes on the better-than-average looking Keanu Reeves will help the time pass. If you are able to completely shut down your left brain through the course of the movie, this actually isn't a bad love story.

B00005JP9V|5.0|Over the lifetime, I often read reviews of films in which the critic proclaims a film to be \\"haunting.\\"  I always chalked that up to hyperbole...until I saw CHILDREN OF MEN.  It's been almost three weeks since I saw it...and feelings and moods and images from the film still revisit me from time to time.  It's a feeling that's pretty new to me, and I've seen 3000 or more films in my life. <br /> <br />It's not that the film is perfect...I've certainly seen films that leave me more shaken, more entertained, more impressed or more moved to action.  But CHILDREN OF MEN soaked me in an atmosphere and a mood and a world in such a specific, complete manner that some of it's images are almost like sense memory to me now.  I think the last time I had a similar feeling was in about 1980 when I first saw David Lynch's THE ELEPHANT MAN, which left me so shaken that I had to go again and again in the same week.  I'm planning on seeing CHILDREN OF MEN again soon, and may have to go a third time.   <br /> <br />I don't think I need to rehash the basic plot...others have done that pretty well.  One thing I feel I must comment on is the criticism I've seen in a few places that there isn't any plot, or that we don't know what's going on in this futuristic society.  To me, that's almost laughable.  How many people wanted to know why the earth became the way it did in BLADE RUNNER?  Or SILENT RUNNING?  We accept the world presented to us.  I think part of the power of CHILDREN OF MEN is that it set in a not very distant future, where the world is turned upside-down...and yet it feels possible.  The landscapes, cityscapes, technology, clothing, etc. that we see look very familiar.  It feels like today, or maybe just next year.  And yet we don't recognize the society, the politics, etc.  It's deeply unsettling to see a \\"future\\" that feels so totally possible.  So bleak, and yet so credible.  <br /> <br />True, we don't know exactly why no one has had children in nearly two decades.  Would the narrative drive of this movie work better if we did know?  Would having that one little answer make the film suddenly perk to life for skeptical viewers?  I find it hard to believe.  I had no problem not knowing...I can fill that blank in for myself.  Otherwise, I think the socio-political climate in the Great Britain presented in the film is VERY easy to glean.  There's some easy to swallow exposition and then off we go with the film. <br /> <br />It is the story of one man, Theo, played brilliantly by Clive Owen.  He looks weary, furrowed, troubled, smart, cynical, heroic, handsome, dirty, smelly.  It's probably too late for Oscar attention for him...but it's an Oscar worthy performance.  He's so easy to like, and yet he's very much an anti-hero.  But during the film, we see him come to life...to suddenly have something to live for.  That's what the movie is about.  Not plot twists.  Not this happened, then this, then this.  It's about one man (living in a society where he already knows the background of what's happened...why would the film tell US?) who is just going through the motions of living.  Then some events unfold that jolt him back into engaging in the world and actually working to make a difference.  It's effective. <br /> <br />Also, I have to address the violence and some viewer's criticism of it.  Yep, it's violent.  It's graphic, but not over the top.  Lots and lots of people die, but the camera doesn't linger over the nasty results.  In fact, people die most often on the fringes of the film.  The camera pans, and just as it passes someone in the background, they drop from a gunshot and are seen no more.  It's highly effective in giving us a sense of the sudden death that awaits in this new society. <br /> <br />There are many specific parts of the film that I loved.  Michael Caine's joyful performance.  Theo's ongoing problems with footwear (don't ask).  The way in which the midwife character in the film is suddenly yanked out of the story (the whole scene showing Theo's arrival at the detention camps is amazingly well done...just look out the bus window as the scenes roll by).  The scene when Kee's secret is first revealed to the general populace and their reaction.  It's all stunning and moving. <br /> <br />The movie is very gray, and bleak.  Yet there are just enough glimmers of hope to make it bearable.  Theo's redemption alone make it worth taking this difficult journey.  I felt exhausted after watching it...but also so impressed with the craftsmanship and the feelings I was grappling with. <br /> <br />So now I sound like a real touchy-feely guy.  That's not me!  But for CHILDREN OF MEN, the best thing I can say is that it was haunting.  This is a film that you must see and experience for yourself.  I guess you might not like it...others didn't...but if you do like it, you'll be SO glad you didn't miss it.  And see it on the big screen. <br />
B00005JPGM|3.0|Irrespective of what other critics/users say about this movie, I feel it lacked something. A lot of people have praised Di Caprio on his performance and some have has gone as far as saying this is his best performance, if not best film. I don't think Blood Diamond stacks up pretty well when you compare it to the last three films that Di Caprio has done. Namely - The Departed, Aviator and Catch Me If You Can. Now, let's talk about why I think this film fails.<br /><br />1. The story never really convinces one of it's message. My friend loved this movie but I just didn't feel it. The acting in the film was solid but the direction was rather tawdry. There were many action scenes that involved thrill in chase, capture, imprisonment, punishment, labor and death. However, nothing quite seemed to cement itself.<br /><br />2. Blood Diamond is a good film but it's just that. I don't think I will be recommending it to anyone. There are too many better films to watch. The subject is rather rewinded or should I just placidly state that I don't care. Or the script really doesn't make me care enough.<br /><br />3. I liked the end of the film. I'm used to absolutely loving the ends of film involving Di Caprio. Jennifer Connelly didn't act very well. Her character was sometimes incongruent to the script. The fact that I even question her performance is enough to highlight the lukewarm performance she gave.<br /><br />My favourite scene in the film involved Solomon winning an applause. But then, tell me, how many times have I seen scenes like that particular one in hollywood? Cynical as I am, I thought Djimon Hounsou acted very well. Di Caprio's character was predictable, at times funny and overall unimpressionable.<br /><br />Do Watch this film. But be open to the fact that some of you might not quite like it all that much. Of course I eagerly await Caprio's next film, Blink.
B00004XPPC|5.0|This is the classic based-on-real-life war movie.  The cinematography is stunning providing many scenes that will live in your memory and continue to thrill you long after the movie is over.  The acting is superb, especially Alec Guiness as the commander torn between individual honor and inhibiting the efforts of the enemy.  It is, hands down, one of the most memorable war movies of all time and will be a favorite for sometime to come.

B000HEWEEY|4.0|This set was very well presented.  The Robbie model, DVDs and theatre cards were beautifully packaged.  The box alone makes a great collector's item.  We enjoyed watching Forbidden Planet again, though were a little disappointed with The Invisible Boy.  We were looking forward to seeing another movie that Robbie was in, but it was nowhere near the same class as Forbidden Planet.  I guess this was to be expected.  Still, it was interesting seeing Robbie in something else.  The three documentaries were really fascinating, so sci-fi film buffs would love those.  In summary, you'll love this box set if you want the DVD extras and the movie memorabilia.  If you just want to see Forbidden Planet, you might be better off just buying the DVD.
B000002KEV|5.0|Live albums historically have taken one of two routes - cheap retread contract obligation releases that are recycled and often horribly produced \\"greatest hits\\" abominations, and the occasional release that becomes a definitive masterpiece.<br /><br />  Among those discs that have become classics among live releases include The Who's \\"Live At Leeds\\", Hendrix' out of print \\"The Jimi Hendrix Concerts\\" and \\"Band of Gypsys\\", and Cheap Trick's phenomenal \\"Live At Budokan\\", which is now available in the full length version.<br /><br />  Deep Purple too enters the pantheon of great live bands for the 1973 release \\"Made In Japan\\".  Featuring the \\"classic\\" lineup (Blackmore, Gillan, Lord, Paice and Glover), the band was on fire in support of their break-through \\"Machine Head\\" album and its anthem \\"Smoke On The Water\\".<br /><br />  In comparison to the studio versions, cuts like \\"Highway Star\\", the aforementioned \\"Smoke On The Water\\" and the album closer \\"Space Truckin'\\" are far superior - louder, brighter and far more intense, like great live rock should be.<br /><br />  Blackmore is in fine form here, and maybe was actually enjoying himself for a change as supposed to being the violent and moody jerk he's famous for.  Personalities aside, his guitar is punishing, slicing, and in the case of \\"Highway Star\\", as mind-blowing as any guitar solo ever got.  Ian Gillan puncuates the set with his ungodly vocal range and power, showing that he was and is the best voice ever for Purple, with or without Blackmore.  Jon Lord's space age Hammond organ and Paice's military drum style round out the sound with precision and power.<br /><br />  We would see this pattern of weak studio albums made into live monsters in the future, ala KISS' \\"Alive!\\" and Cheap Trick.  \\"Made In Japan\\" is truly a live album that very few bands ever came close to duplicating.

Those who are familiar with the original animated series on MTV may or may not be a little disappointed, as it doesn't really follow the guidelines of the series, but it's an amazing movie when evaluated on its own merits.  The effects and scenery, the premise, the acting, Charlize Theron... it's a beautiful movie, across the board.
B00005CDNK|5.0|ABBA's final studio album is truly in a class by itself.  The title track is about someone alone in their apartment -- which has been surrounded by the secret police -- awaiting their fate for being a political dissident in a communist country.  Creepy and brilliant.<br /><br />This album isn't about disco dancing and teenage crushes, it's about tyranny, watching your children grow up, ending relationships, and war.<br /><br />If you are an ABBA fan, and you are hesitant to buy this disc because you don't see any charting hits on it, just go ahead and buy it.  It's sad that this is the their last album, because I think they could have succeeded with this sould through the decade of the 1980's.  They proved that they could change and reinvent themselves.<br /><br />How many bands have \\"last albums\\" that are as great as this one?
068987474X|5.0|I just loved this book and the male perspective on the age old mystery of why women put up with men, and the real truth behind why they are just not interested.  It is the \\"wake up!\\" and \\"smell the roses\\" approach to a very eye opening book.
B000HBKCDC|5.0|This is one of the more refreshing holiday pieces I have heard in a long time.
B00005M91K|4.0|Remarkable cinematography lets you visit 24 countries without standing in a long security line. It's your window seat to the world in two media that will startle your senses - music and image.
B000IU3Y1O|5.0|The CD music shows the history with the best of DM. The quality of the sound better than older ones. Also, the versiones included are excelent. <br />The DVD with videos show the oldest videos and newest, those are not in the last DVD, we can only find those in this DVD. <br />In conclusion, a good review for collector and perfect beginning for initial fans. <br /> <br />Roger G.
0156012197|5.0|You don't have to be a parent or a child to enjoy this book.  In fact, the first time I read The Little Prince was as a freshman in college.  We'd just translated a snippet of it in my first year French class, and I had to find out what was going on with this little person from \\"une autre planete\\" (another planet) who insisted that this airplane pilot cease repairing his broken plane and instead \\"dessine-moi un mouton, s'il vous plait\\" (Draw me a sheep, if you please...). <br /> <br />Aside from spinning an entertaining tale, St. Exupery explores the human condition in as deep and profound a way as any intellectual or philosophical treatise written for the grown ups (who never understand things anyway).  And the most valuable wisdom comes from the Little Prince's friend, the fox, who tells him.... <br /> <br />Well, I'll let you read the book.
0064407667|4.0|I am an Elementary Education major and absolutely adored this book. The orphan children are easy to relate to, yet bring you into a whole other world through their wild experiences. I highly reccomend this book to readers of all ages!
B00005JMJG|5.0|This movie is the greatest thing I have ever seen.  I fell in love with it after the first watch.  I introduced my brother to it and now he feels the same way.  This is not your average hollywood movie... though the stars may mislead you.  The acting and story and music are great.
B0006V6TMG|5.0|I've seen Jesse Cook in concert 4 times (so far), and have all his CD's. <br />Having said that, Montreal is a special CD. Get for a first timer to start with : )
0440237688|5.0|Jonas and his family live in a utopian world, where Sameness is the rule: there is no violence, no crime, no hunger, no poverty. As a twelve, Jonas is ready to be assigned an adult task. While his friend Asher, always a bit goofy, is assigned as Assistant Director of Recreation, and Fiona, a thougthful, warm girl, as Caretaker of the Old, Jonas is assigned as Receiver of Memories, a crucial, if lonely, assignment. He is taught by a man called the Giver and soon Jonas realizes that there was a very expensive price to pay for Sameness.<br /><br />Lowry's prose is sparse and elegant, deceptive in its simplicity. She tackles hefty issues, such as the need for individuality and choices, which weigh so heavily in the minds of young adults. She doesn't condescend or talk down but confronts these issues head on, through a surprising twist in the story that startles and pains. The ending is clever and leads to further thought rather than a foregone conclusion or happy ending.<br /><br />Lowry's contribution to American Literature for Children earned her a John Newberry Medal. The Giver sustains this contribution. The Giver is a must for every searching young adult.
0679731377|5.0|History repeats itself.  The first time is tragedy, the second time farce.  This is one of many brilliantly illustrated themes that run through the 10 1/2 chapters that quite closely sum up the whole history of the world.  Find out what really happened on Noah's Ark.  See if wood worms can be tried for heresy and excommunicated from the church.  See the lengths that people will go to simply to survive another day.  Take a trip to the moon, up a mountain, down a river, over the ocean, and finally one day to heaven.  Oh, and one parenthetical detour that is, in my opinion, the best part of the whole book.<br /><br />These stories depict humanity in all its...well...humanness.  This is what it is to be human, all warts exposed, but also all that makes us somehow lovable despite it all.  Barnes writes with a biting wit that remains somehow tender and open.  The stories are entertaining, thought-provoking, stirring and all too true.<br /><br />I read this book for the first time ten years ago, and to this day it is still the best book I ever read.  Give it a read.  You won't be disappointed.
6305558175|4.0|I like it because of the mistery and sensibility of the story. Jodie Foster as always is one of my favorite actressess.
B000050XEI|5.0|I have had this cd for about 4 years and it still has the same effect......RELAXATION. It makes me feel very calm and centered.<br /><br />I have 4 cd's from Enya and this one is the one I listen to because I love Only time, A day without rain. Those are my favorites!<br /><br />If you are a fan of hers this one is a must!
B00009W0U4|5.0|Much has already been written about this film. The praise and criticism both well deserved. This film is simply to challenging for most viewers. Gaspar Noe is brilliant at what he does. He shows you what lines beneath the surface of shattered dreams, the brutality which humanity stews in.  <br /> <br />The frustrated existence, which grips so many. Making a great many of us predators or victims, sometimes both.  <br /> <br />Film should entertain, but also peel back the lies we tell ourselves to just get by, and this time, try not to look away. <br />
B0002O06N0|5.0|If you like any old school bluesy rock this album will find its place in your heart.  Seriously it's one of the best albums I've heard from any new band well any band that's relatively new.  by far their best album to date.  it's just hard hitting and makes you want to rock out!!!  you'll love it it rocks.  it's very gritty and the songs are all memorable!  check it out.  I've suggested it to all of my friends and they all get addicted to it as well.  you won't be disappointed.  cheers
B0000549B0|5.0|I saw this movie when I was a kid and I have always remembered it.  When I saw this movie, I was at an age where I DID believe that Harvey was possible.  Of course now that I'm older I have had some of that innocence lost, but every time I watch this movie it somehow takes me back to that child-like mindset.  Give it a try and see if you too are transformed...
B000J4QWMC|1.0|Right to the point. Its' 2006 Ferraris', Chrysler 300s' and I think I saw a Mercedes in there somewhere...(and of course the SUV or two, after all nothing goes better with RAP music right isn't that how it goes?) Its' explosions, a graphic scene of someone getting their head blown off and of course...a few F-Words and one naked piece of A. Its a slap in the face to 'Miami Vice' the show straight from the mouth of Mann himself. Crockett and Tubbs have no unstable relationship, no reason to believe they'd be in business together for ANYthing, theres' no heat between them (theres' a failed attempt a heat between them if that counts), the story is too old to revive no matter HOW many things you try to add to it. OK...We'll meet at the dock tonight, after that we'll meet at the boat, after that we'll meet at the penthouse, then the warehouse, then we'll stop off at the limo and shoot eachother up over ONE FREAKIN DRUG DEAL!! Is the white lady THAT hard to move these days? Wheres' the excitement? Where are the kind of plot twists you gotta add to a movie like this to keep it fresh? 'Miami Vice' does nothing but fall back on its' name, theres one part where we're supposed to be rivited, believing that 'OH NO!' Crockett's getting too involved with gorgeous Lola Banana and they get into the same limo and BAM they fall into eachother's arms in a totally UNpredictable scene of passionate kissing. I started laughing so hard in the movie theater I got shushed. This is a flashy cardboard floor-show that is GUARANTEED to disappoint if you were ever a fan of the show. Pass this one up.
0689853637|5.0|Winter's Tale is my 4 1/2 year old twins' third Sabuda pop-up.  The first was the Twelve Days of Christmas when they were only three.  You would expect the books to be shredded by a pair of rambunctious boys but think again!  The books have been read & handled (unsupervised) for countless hours and all are still considered a priceless treasure and are, therefore, in pristine condition.  Winter's Tale is their all time favorite because it includes actual battery powered twinkling Christmas lights on the last page.  Fabulous!
0804115613|5.0|I had seen the movie for years, and just recently had the pleasure of reading the book.  The Book is by far so much better than the movie.  It is better to have seen the movie than to read the book, because they complement each other so much. Fannie Flagg is one of the best at this type of simplistic yet colorfully realistic writing structure.
B000HT3PPG|5.0|My family and I have always watched this movie at Christmas time on tv but decided this year we wanted to see it on our own schedule.  We enjoyed this true classic with such a great message.  I recommend you too buy this movie and share it with your family and friends!
1881273156|5.0|<br />Great book!  Both my wife and I read it and it deals with many of the reasons which lead to poor communication.  I'd recommend this book to anyone just getting maried to those who've been maried for many years! <br /> <br />
0684833395|5.0|I've read this book four times, and I want to read it again.  It remains fresh, funny and intriguing with every read--a true masterpiece of American fiction.
0316172324|2.0|I thought that this book, though well-written and easy to read, didn't really teach me much that was useful. Perhaps my fault for setting expectations too high, but I thought this book would offer insights into how WE can go about improving these gut-decisions that we sometimes have to make. I don't think I got anything like that. Outside of some interesting data points on how accurate some people's instincts seem to be or how, with training, we can discern some of the causes underlying some of our decisions and prejudices, I thought this was just trivial.
B00006CXSS|5.0|OK. First off I am a Women and was not to excited when my Husband wanted to watch this movie. I am not a big fan of war movies. But I am Happy to say that I was dead wrong.... This is an Amazing set of movies and I loved the whole set.. in fact I think i have watched the whole thing through at least 4 times. The special features are also amazing.. we bought this movie for My Husbands Brother for Christmas and I am going to buy a set for my Father for Christmas. It's just a great movie and depicts the war and what these men went through. And its all True. I would recommend this to any one Male of Female!!
B00020HEL6|5.0|This CD is romantic, nostaligic, and reaches into your soul.  Perfect for long drives, traffic, daydreaming out the window on a rainy day, or that quiet, candlelit night with someone special.  Hard to believe this is a young girl singing, sounds like a songtress with a life's worth of experience.  You can actually hear her heart's thoughts through her voice.  Fantastic!
B000J3EEBY|4.0|Her voice is unbelieveable.  Her band is off the charts!  Just love her.
B00005JPDY|1.0|I do not recomend this movie. It was very slow and boring. The plot was very thin. If you're going for Angelina Jolie's sake, skip it. She had a very small part. Do not go see it.
B000I0QL82|4.0|The music and dance in this show is more fluid than in most of Crosby and Astaire's shows. The plot is rather redundant of the time. If you are a fan of these two actors then you will like the movie. Astaire does an unusual dance routine; alot of which I would liken to more of a Gene Kelly movie. I liked most the song \\"Holiday Inn\\" which hence the name of the movie. I heard the music first on a CD and searched the internet for the movie because I could tell it had come from a movie score. Cheerio.

B000002NHN|5.0|Once again, I cannot say More.  Her voice and all the members of her band and all the other musicians on this album are phenomenal !!!<br /><br />The stories and the lyrics on the sleeve included with the disc are wonderful to read.<br /><br />Love it !!!<br /><br />Lizebee
B000A59PMO|5.0|I recently bought Veronica Mars season 1 and 2 for my sister because I knew she liked the program, and she told me how much she liked it, and I was hooked on the first episode. It is really clever the way that the plot works out and a really good watch, I don't know what will happen next! I haven't lost interest and I can't wait to finish the season and start season 2.
0486446859|4.0|A dying art of illustration. Wonderful collection of illustrations from differnt books. No one draws like this anymore. A precursor to Norman Rockwell. Good book to have in an artists library. Cheerio
B000005J56|5.0|For those of you who are fans of the Buena Vista Social Club already, this is the masterpiece. A culmination of talented musicians, soul, love, and sultry afternoons with a cool drink getting ready to kick on into the night!  <br /> <br />For those of you who have never listened to this style of music, don't just listen to it once as you could compare it to the first 3 olives you have ever eaten.  <br /> <br />The first one shocks your taste with a layered complexity that is both sharp and mellow, leaving you with a look on your face that says \\"what just happened?\\". <br /> <br />The second takes you back to the memory of your first taste, and enjoying re-living  the sensation, you start looking for more. <br /> <br />The third confirms your interests and instils an infatuation with something unique, powerful, and good for the heart and soul, that will be played over and over again.

0140288503|5.0|There are many amazing things about this book, Mark Bowden's 1999 account of a bloody battle in Mogadishu, Somalia that claimed the lives of 18 U.S. servicemen and hundreds of Somalian militia and civilians. Perhaps the most amazing for Bowden himself, given the unpretty nature of his tale, was how warmly \\"Black Hawk Down\\" was embraced by the U.S. military at all levels.<br /><br />\\"Beyond the politics of the situation, beyond the critical debate over strategy and tactics, the story of what happened in Mogadishu resonates with the nobility of military service,\\" Bowden writes in an afterword.<br /><br />To which I can only add: Hell, yeah. The raid to capture two key lieutenants of a troublemaking Somalian warlord didn't start out as high-degree heroism, but as events rapidly deteriorated and a stirred-up local population decided to take up arms against the overseas invaders, something inside the Americans clicked and brought out something thought dormant since the end of World War II. Sure, they fought hard because they had to, but the way they remained calm, maintained battle integrity, and willingly and repeatedly laid themselves out on the line one for another is a stirring story.<br /><br />The story of Randy Shughart and Gary Gordon alone is gulp-inducing, not just because of the sacrifice they knowingly laid down for their comrades but for the casual way they did so. Throughout his book, Bowden hones in on similarly brave deeds by men who, if surviving, have little explanation for why they acted so except that they didn't want to let down their buddies.<br /><br />Bowden interviewed everyone he could for this book, and it shows. Events are described moment-by-moment in plain prose with a minimum of adjectives. Instead of a hundred pages of preamble, we start the story with the copters taking off for their target, a scene Bowden describes in a way that is vaguely, perhaps intentionally, reminiscent of Col. Kilgore's ride in \\"Apocalypse Now.\\" For most of these soldiers, combat was something they only knew in movies until Oct. 3, 1993. That all changed in minutes, minutes Bowden slows down to the point the combat is as comprehensible as it can ever be.<br /><br />What drove the Somalis to attack the soldiers, who were only trying to knock down someone who was starving most of them? Was it xenophobia, propaganda, or the narcotic herb so many of them chewed habitually? Bowden doesn't suggest many answers, they aren't really his to give, but he does note how intensely this played out. After a while, the U.S. troops stopped caring about who they shot, figuring anyone who didn't want to be there would have gotten out. I like to think of myself as sensitive, but after a while of reading I became pretty numb, too. The intensity of Bowden's story is all-consuming.<br /><br />Judging from the reaction of the soldiers themselves, Bowden got matters close to the bone, a heartaching tale of guts and glory that eschews the patriotic boilerplate for something deeper. Especially now with so many in harm's way, this is worth a read.these soldiers, combat was something they only knew in movies until Oct. 3, 1993.

0307346609|5.0|This book is brilliant for the Zombie buff. If you're too caught up in current affairs don't read it cuz you'll think the author has an agenda. The fact that he does this oral account format shows me that Brooks has a vivid imagination, to be able to create hundreds of different characters like he has, to give such insightful information on different levels and cultures speaks for itself. Its a great mind bending story that actually made you think hmmmmm! There was alot of realism in the short interviews and I for one liked how he touched on certain taboo issues. It is a very quick read, took me about a day and a half to read, couldn't put it down. The ending could have been a little better, however it mite have been left open for the sequal. And being Iranian I hope we don't get nuked again!
B000JBXXZ4|3.0|Being a long time Incubus fan, I have seen there progression from Fungus Amongus & Enjoy Incubus to this latest CD, Light Grenades, and it seems to just get more mainstream and love song driven.  I'm personally a fan of S.C.I.E.N.C.E., Make Yourself, and Morning View.  These CD's are still heavy lyrically and instrumentally and they include love songs like I Miss You and Stellar if your into that kind of thing, but they were more about views on the world and people in general.  After the band aquired there new bassist Ben Kenney from The Roots, for the 2004 album A Crow Left of the Murder, there music seemed to really soften up in my opinion.  They also spent there time between there 2004 release to there 2006 release, touring across seas in Europe which I believe influenced there work in a negative way.  <br />Light Grenades is not a bad album by any means, I can still hear talent in every instrument and vocally, but its not what I wanted to hear from a band that I admire for there views on life.  I have my own love life problems to deal with, and if I cared to hear about anyone elses, I would buy a Micheal Bolton record. <br />Overall I would give the album a five or four star rating if it were produced by a different band, but this is definetly not what I wanted to hear from Incubus.
B000KKPN5C|5.0|I've shot a couple of hundred indoor photographs with the SB 400 so far, and what impresses me most is the \\"bounce flash\\" feature. You can tilt the light portion of the flash head at a number of angles, including straight up, so that the flash does not wash out the scene or create red eye. Instead the room is bathed in indirect light that creates natural shadows and no red eye. The results for even an amateur are amazing. Yes, its also small and well integrated into the camera, so that you wouldn't mind just leaving it on the hot shoe much of the time. But take just a few shots with the head tilted up and you'll be sold.
B000HBKCDC|5.0|Sarah McLachlan is an excellent artist and this CD proves it. I highly recommend that you add it to your Christmas music collection!
B0009A1AS2|4.0|Dream Theater often delights and exasperates me, and while OCTAVARIUM is no exception to that trend, it is mostly delightful. The CD is particularly satisfying with the jaw-dropping hard rock the band displays on songs like \\"Panic Attack\\" and \\"The Root of All Evil.\\" So before I trot out any criticism, let me state that six of this project's eight songs are stone-cold terrific.<br /><br />Alas, there are two missteps. One is the treacly \\"The Answer Lies Within.\\" In fact, it is so bad, I kept thinking of Styx's execrable \\"Babe\\" while it played. Equally horrible, DT exhumes the corpse of Emerson, Lake, and Palmer for the album's titular track. This would be less objectionable if the homage didn't last for 24 minutes.<br /><br />But look at it this way. OCTAVARIUM clocks in at about 78 minutes. Remove the dross, and you still have about 48 minutes of exquisitely performed, hard-edged prog rock. Such a deal!<br /><br />FUN FACT: Dream Theater's original name was \\"Majesty.\\"

0780628551|5.0|I have seen bad reviews for this movie but personally, I think it is great! I am a huge Johnny Depp fan and he is a truly magnificant actor. Every time I watch one of his movies, I am left in aw at his wonderous talent...and he did it again. I was literally on the edge of my seat for this one. It is suspensful, sexy, scary, and all around a great movie. Charlize Theron couldn't have done a better job! This is the type of movie you can watch again...even though you know the outcome, it doesn't get old. I HIGHLY recommend it.
B000024D4R|5.0|I find it appropriate to write a review at this time being the 30th anniversary of it's release. Released in January 1977, Animals became the product of post Dark Side studio sessions. The two songs which did not make it to Wish You Were Here were \\"Gotta Be Crazy\\" and \\"Raving and Drooling\\". Gotta be Crazy would become \\"Dogs\\" and Raving and Drooling would become \\"Sheep\\". In retrospect, Animals would become the Floyd's answer to a changing music scene that would witness the birth of Punk Rock and Disco. Pink Floyd were neither. What they produced was some of their finest work. This is musically the most intense album they ever made. Think of Animals like a sandwich - pigs on the wing being the two slices of thin bread and the dogs, pigs, and sheep being the \\"meat\\". Roger Waters based this album on the George Orwell (1984) book Animal Farm.  <br /> <br />Pigs on the Wing (1&2)- one and a half minute simple songs with acoustic guitar compliments. Apparently they were love songs written by Roger Waters to his wife. Basic theme being that you need someone else with you in this journey called life. Always keep an eye out for society's pigs. <br /> <br />Dogs - the most classical Floyd song on the album. Written by Roger Waters and David Gilmour (the only one not written soly by Waters). Once again Gilmour provides brilliant guitar and vocals. Water's lyric writing is exceptional. Wright's hammond organ is also great. I do prefer Dave's voice to Roger's but both are good in their own way. The main lyrical theme is that the dog's are the hard working ones who basically do the dirty work for the pigs and will work at all costs to make it to the top. In the end the dog finds out that he's a stranger in his own home and was merly a puppet in the hands of the pigs. Even though the dog has come to this realization he keeps pretending that everything is as it should be. The dogs fate is to ultimatly be dragged down by the stone (or maybe the weight of his own importance). 17 minutes <br /> <br />Pigs - musically probably the hardest floyd song ever. Apparently Roger and Dave traded instruments on this song (Dave on bass and Roger on Guitar). A mouth-guitar devise was used in the solo on pigs instead of the standard guitar ( a devise that would not be used again until Keep Talking on Division Bell). Rick's keyboards, along with Nick Mason's drums were used to hold the beat. Water's directly attacks a Journalist ( Mary Whitehouse ) as a \\"house proud town mouse trying to keep peoples feelings off the street. The other person under attack is a \\"bus stop rat bag who radiates cold shafts of broken glass\\". To this day I am not sure what that means. The other person under attack is the \\"well - heeled big wheel\\" who in my opinion exuberates in others a feeling of cynicism with his hand on his heart. In these three verses Water's ultimately breaks them down to their pig like nature ( \\"head down in the pig been sayin' keep on diggin\\" ). They're all nearly a laugh but they're really a cry. The song ends with a perfectly fitting loud and intense guitar solo ( most likely from Dave ). 11 minutes <br /> <br />Sheep - a mild opening with an organ solo done extremely well by Richard Wright. This gives way to a screaming rave by Roger which ends in him either holding his breath for a long time or help from their equipment or both. This finally merges into a haunting jam invoving fast bass strumming, bleating sheep, erie keyboards, and a sonic voice rendition of Water's version of the 24th Psalm. It then breaks into the final verse of the song followed by an optomistic guitar solo by Gilmour. The lyrical theme is that the sheep ( after harmlessly passing their time in the grassland away) have become fed up with their lot in life and decide to do something about it ( wave upon wave of demented avengers march cheerfully out of obscurity into the dream ). But ultimately they have to stay home and do as their told and stay out of the road if they wanna grow old. 10 minutes <br /> <br />Most of the vocals on this album are sung by Roger Waters. He also wrote all the lyrics. Waters is a great talent in his own right. I recommend this to anyone who has heard \\"the Wall\\" but not much else. I also recommend it to anyone familiar with the Floyd catalog but for some strange reason missed Animals. Remember that the pigs are watching you and things are not always what they seem.
B00070Q8DQ|5.0|What is it about polish bands??They're almost too good at their craft.I have to hand it to Nergal and co this is a powerful and mighty assault on the senses, the playing is unreal.Behemoth has very much it's own sound and vibe, but there are also traces of Morbid Angel and Nile to be found in the mix(which can only be a positive thing)words don't really do the vibe behind the music justice so check it out for yourself. In short this album rips your head off and sh**s down your neck and you're OK about it!
B000002U8G|5.0|Meddle, in my opinion, is one of the greatest albums of all time. Meddle is often times overshadowed by the big four ( DSOTM, WYWH, ANIMALS, and THE WALL ). After the departure of Syd Barret in early 1968, the floyd had become experimental both on stage and in the studio. In Saucerful of Secrets I beleive you have a genuine stepping stone. I beleive Ummagumma and Atom Heart Mother were experiments gone wrong. Listening to Atom Heart (spring 1970) and Meddle (fall 1971), it almost sounds like two different bands.  <br /> <br />One of these days - begins quiet and slow, slowly builds up, climaxes, then comes back down. Atmospheric, moody, melodic, and rhythmic. Classic Floyd. <br /> <br />A Pillow of Winds - mellow, light, atmospheric, and subtle. Gilmours vocals and guitars are beautiful along with Wright's keyboard work. <br /> <br />Fearless - mellow, light, and atmospheric like \\"Pillow\\" but a bit more catchy. A real showcase of Gilmour's talent. <br /> <br />San Tropez - catchy, rhythmic, and different from any other song in the Floyd catalog. A preview of Water's later brilliance within the band. Picture yourself sitting on the beach while listening. <br /> <br />Seamus (formerly Madamoiselle Nobs) - created by all four members of the band, this is probably the only true blues song in the Floyd catalog. Probably the only song that foils the album's absolute perfection.  <br /> <br />Echoes (formerly Return to the Son of Nothing) - definitely in the top 5 of all Floyd songs. This is a 23 minute composition divided into six parts in which the first and the sixth are the same. The first will build up and the sixth will bring down. All parts of the song brilliantly merge into one another. This song was created by Waters, Mason, Wright, and Gilmour and is probably the best example of how those four were able to work together. Highlights include Gilmour's guitar work (part 2), Wright's brilliant keyboards (part 4), and both Gilmour and Wright's harmonizing on the vocals. This is not forgetting Mason and Water's organizing (as they were the architects) of the song and their respective musicianships. <br /> <br />I recommend this to anyone wishing to sit back and relax for 45 minutes. If you do not like Pink Floyd but have only heard the albums from \\"Dark Side\\" on I still recommend it.
B0000542DH|4.0|This is Apocalypto in the all-American modern version. Our society produces, be they born or not born, a whole fringe of killers that absolutely know what is wrong or right, good or bad, but who do not care a fig about it, even if at times they do not find any pleasure in murdering. The film explores the destiny of a couple of two young people who meet by accident but find in themselves so many common alienations and frustrations based on about the same social, cultural and personal environment : sexual abuse and violence from parents, rejection from society, total lack of care and help in education that is inexistant or social counselling that is just impotent. They end up taking what they want by force since it is not provided to them free. But the film goes a lot further. It analyzes the role of the media that systematically sell paper and prime time advertising with this showing of violence and with fake or unfake interviews of murderers and other criminals. The lower, the better. The nastier, the more profitable. The bloodier, the tastier. Then the film also shows that the prison system is a system of incarceration and containment, in no way of reform, education and improvement. These prisoners are there to survive because no one dares execute them all. They are the sacrificial victims of society that needs them to regenerate its lost virginity, purity and morality. They are the sacrificial victims of a god that has nothing to envy the Maya gods. This god is the god of selfish greedy consumerism. Till it explodes. And the official end of the film shows that such criminals can disappear in society forever, and they are then living among us unknown and unseen. The alternative ending shows that you need the intervention of an angel to execute these criminals. The film preaches and advocates that these criminals are natural born killers, hence that they will never be anything else, hence that they have to be purely and simply executed as soon as they are noticed and as fast as possible to avoid as many victims as possible, why not at birth ? This vision of crime in our society is criminal in itself because it produces the criminals concerned by considering there is no other way, it is their fate and ours.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University of Paris Dauphine & University of Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonned as fast as possible to avoid as many victims as possible, why not at birth ?

0743454537|2.0|I had never read a Jodi Picoult book but this one came highly recommended by a friend of mine.  While the subject of this book is compelling, timely and an interesting moral dilemma, the book itself is lackluster, manipulative and not particularly well-written. <br /> <br />Picoult tells the story from the point of view of several different characters, yet pretty much all of them sound the same.  Perhaps that's why the fonts are different-- to trick the reader into thinking they're reading a different voice.  Picoult does differentiate one voice in particular-- the voice of the 18 year old delinquent brother, but his inner monologue is laughable-- the result of perhaps an out of touch woman writing what she thinks an 18 year old guy would think.  (Do many teenaged guys think of women in terms of being bodacious???!!)  The character of Campbell, the lawyer, completely changes somewhere along the way.  He starts off his inner monologue is that of a total cold jerk and then all of a sudden he's a man filled with regret for love lost.  There is no plot-driven explanation for this sudden shift in his character. <br /> <br />Speaking of Campbell, that brings me to my next point.  In the middle of this story about a 13 year old who wants to be medically emancipated from her family, Picoult has chosen to weave a love story between the lawyer and the woman who is brought in to assess the 13 year old's ability to think for herself.  The love story feels rather jammed in-- it's completely from left field, one dimensional and stale and doesn't fit with the thoughtful story Picoult is trying to tell about a family pillaged by the potentially terminal illness of one of it's daughters.  Plus, it doesn't ring true at all.  We are supposed to believe that two people in their thirties are still shells of people over the unresolved demise of their high school romance???  It's not romantic-- it's just unrealistic.   <br /> <br />As for the ending of the book, suffice it to say that after pretty astutely and convincingly depicting the moral dilemma of an organ donor through all parties eyes, Picoult chooses to go for the saccharine, melodramatic ending rather than the thoughtful ending, leaving the reader feeling manipulated and used.  Like most of the characters in the book, it seems even Picoult herself had difficulty coming down on one side of the issue.   <br /> <br />Despite it's rich premise, at 423 pages, this book is just too long to trudge through all its character and story problems.  After 400+ pages, I want to feel enriched by a novel, not cheated and manipulated by it.

B000ICL3KG|3.0|I am somewhat familiar with global warming and wanted to learn more.  I had heard how wonderful this film was so I was anxious to view it.  The information and data presenting the facts for global warming are undeniable.  Yes, everyone needs to hear these facts and heed the call to action.  However, 50 percent of the film seemed to be a political agenda platform for Gore as well as a personal biography.  He flashed pictures of recent republican presidents as parties against action.  He neglected to mention Clinton's 8 years of non-action.  It definitely had a democrat versus republican based hidden agenda.  I visited wikipedia to lean more about Kyoto after viewing the film.  Here it discussed both Bush & Clinton administrations and the US position.  The global warming information was great in the film.  The implication republicans are against action was disappointing, not true, and unfair.  With the big election coming in the near future I guess I shouldn't have been surprised.  But I was definitely disappointed in the integrity of the film as a whole.

B000000WHX|5.0|An Italian, and a couple of Afro-Caribeans, living in Bristol, where a whole new scene is emerging, with the likes of Tricky, Portishead and Roni Size producing new beats. You produce your first album and name your band Massive Attack, only for George Bush senior to invade Kuwait. Hence the band became known (for a short while) as Massive (and I did have a copy simply named Massive till it was stolen - if you have one you have a rarity). <br /> <br />Like their other albums they use a female guest vocalist - this time soul singer Shola Ahma,who later went solo (maybe they'd have kept her?) What you have is slickly produced music that captures the early 90's. Their later albums are more sophisticated, btu this is where it all began.

0375805613|5.0|This was a gift for my grandson, 3 years old, but all of my grandchildren, up to 8 years old, loved it.  I bought it 20 years ago for my son. Sesame Street isn't as popular as it was then, too many other options, but my grandchildren do know Kermit, Big Bird, Miss Piggy & now they know who Grover is.  This book is one of those great books, like The Little Engine That Could, that you, the reader can vocalize as much as you want - it is best when you let yourself be silly and show expression in your voice - especially for the young who may be afraid of a monster, at first.  I also appreciated the board book as opposed to the paper one I bought long ago and was read so many times, even after the pages tore. They still can't go in the tub, but hopefully this book will last through Logan's baby brother and still be readable when Logan can read it to him!

B000J10EQU|4.0|I always liked the Superman storyline of basic good versus evil, and was looking forward to an updated Superman movie to share with my kids (9 & 10) that was not as dated as the Christopher Reeve's movies.<br /><br />It wasn't as great as I expected it to be, but still a movie I liked to watch...but I really felt they could have done a lot more with it.<br /><br />Anyway, the price was great, my kids liked it, and it was not a waste of $10 for me.  If I had a 1 to 10 scale I would give this one a 7.<br /><br />Truth is, if you like the Superman story you'll like this movie.
0671015206|4.0|The authors spent a great deal of time surveying and studying the rich, those whose net worth was over $1,000,000.  The results may surprise you.  Very few inherited or started with money.  Most were poor or middle class.  Those people you see driving the Lexus and Mercedes and living the high life often aren't rich, but merely have a good income.  Many have little or even negative net worth, and all their stuff could go away if they lose their job or are unable to work. <br /> <br />This book tells the stories of many of these millionaires, and how they accumulted that wealth.  Most have several factors in common, the most prominent being that they live beneath their means.  They live in middle class homes, drive plain domestic cars, and take middle class vacations.  Their extra income goes into their businesses or investments. <br /> <br />I found this book very satisfying as I made the change in lifestyle towards frugality several years ago because I wanted to stop being in debt and actually accumulate some wealth.  It was nice to get the positive reinforcement. <br /> <br />The book gets 4 stars only, because some of the writing was flat and tries to give you too much info in the way of statistics, while the conclusions and examples of the wealthy are the important part. <br /> <br />I definitely recommend reading this book if you have a desire to become rich, but are not sure what changes you need to make to get there.

6305364648|4.0|Arnold Schwarzenegger (Harry Tasker) is a super spy character who works for (eye-patched Charlton Heston) Omega Force, and tracks down international terrorists...<br /><br />His marvelous wife Helen (Jamie Lee Curtis) nor their teenage daughter Dana (Eliza Dushku) know anything about it... Helen thinks he's rather a dull computer salesman...<br /><br />Things go rough when Harrie begins to suspect that his wife, a very conservative secretary, maybe is having an affair with a man pretending to be a spy... So he immediately brings all the resources of his department to find out what is really going on... In addition, Harry was focusing on a Middle Eastern terrorist group called the Crimson Jihad who terrorizes the United States with nuclear weapons...<br /><br />In my mind, and I'll bet the rest of you will feel the same as well, Schwarzenegger has enough physical bravado for the job... Best example: his scene holding Helen from the moving helicopter... He does a credible 007--like character, especially out, in and around an ultra exclusive Swiss château... His hot tango, with Asian beauty Tia Carrere, establishes Harry's grace and charm...<br /><br />Jamie Lee Curtis shows she is indeed a sweet delight in the way she moves... This attractive star still has a great figure... Her arousing striptease is hilarious and sexy...<br /><br />Tom Arnold (Albert Gibson) does all of the background work in the van, while his partner Harry saves the world, in killing bad guys...<br /><br />Tia Carrere brings a sensuous style as the wild, hot-blooded psycho-seductress, driven by powerful ambitions...<br /><br />Bill Paxton becomes funnier as we get to know him... He feels lucky as Helen's enigmatic suitor, convincing the naive woman, through a series of \\"chance\\" encounters, that he is an international spy...<br /><br />Art Malik makes an appropriately super-villain especially considering what he is supposed to be portraying: the face of terrorism, with fanatical actions shaped by a fundamental antagonism against United States... You'll explode with laughter watching what occurs when our super hero tells him, \\"You're fired.\\"<br /><br />With 'True Lies,' a vivid reminder of just how exciting an action film can be, director James Cameron gives us a film that plays for laughs enough that it works... Watch Schwarzenegger on top of the skyscraper wanting a horse he is riding to jump to another building... The $100 million in special effects are very impressive... The best example: Harrier fighters blowing out a bridge; and a standout scene that has to been seen to be believed:the rescue of Arnold's daughter with a Harrier Jetfighter...<br /><br />Six months have elapsed since (September 11th, 2001) that terrible day of infamy tore at America's soul... On Sunday, October 7, 2001, the United States and Britain began air strikes against Al Qaeda and Taliban targets in Afghanistan...<br /><br />I think each nation must struggle against violence and for peace... We will never eradicate terrorism altogether, but we can certainly minimize its destructive impact... This is not a fight against a specific religion or a culture of people... This is a fight for the right to live in democracy, freely and in peace... This is a fight to the end that the whole world must win...tions shaped by a fundamental antagonism against United States...

B00009NHC5|4.0|To be blind, deprived of the power even to see the danger that threatens you, is a frightening experience... It also, obviously, gave director Terence Young the opportunity to carry out one of the most important rules of suspense: let the audience discover more than the principal character...<br /><br />When we can see imminent danger which the victim, by definition, cannot see, the emotional impact is increased on the viewer... We desire earnestly to cry out in warning, but we cannot... We can only sit helplessly, and wait to see what become apparent... And when the sightless is a young and lovely woman, there are many twists and turns, disturbing moments, claustrophobic atmosphere, great suspense...<br /><br />Most of the drama is played out in Hepburn's apartment in NewYork's Greenwich Village, and there is an outstanding development when Susy Hendrix, alone with her telephone cord cut and awaiting the return of the gang, decides to use her disadvantage as a defensive weapon... Her one advantage in being blind was that she required no light--and she methodically destroyed all the light-bulbs except one...<br /><br />After some destructive murdering, only the master-criminal, a merciless villain of many voices (Alan Arkin) was left to confront her, and he selected a particularly diabolical way of terrorizing her...<br /><br />Audrey Hepburn earned her 5th and final Academy Award nomination among competition that included Anne Bancroft, Faye Dunaway, Edith Evans and Katharine Hepburn...
B000805796|5.0|I was surprised at the bad reviews that Melanie C's sophmore album \\"Reason\\" received. Then I realized that the reviews given are just one person's opinion and that is just what it is,,, an opinion. Like many other things, musical tastes vary from one individual to the next. As with any consumer in today's technology enhanced world, we as educated consumers can sample the tracks of any given album at any number of web-sites. As others have mentioned, sample the songs and see if you like them first before puchasing. Like most Melanie C fans I purchased the album \\"Reason\\" and have enjoyed every song even after repeated listens.  <br />\\"Beautiful Intentions\\", Melanie's third album, is no exception. After purchasing it and with repeated listens, I liked the entire songlist. The song samples do not give any of the songs any true justice, you miss quite a lot of the congruity of the song.  <br />I buy Melanie C's albums for her voice, an absolutely lovely voice that can be powerful one song and soft and reassuring the next. Through the progression of each album from \\"Northern Star\\" and \\"Reason\\" to the most current, listeners are treated to a more mature sounding Melanie C, her growth in her vocals is to be commmeded, just like fine wine, her distinctive voice only gets better with age. Her vocal work is smooth and transitions nicely from song to song. Her upper register shines in songs like \\"Good Girl\\" and \\"Here and Now\\" while her mid-range rocks smoothly in songs like the title track \\"Beautiful Intentions\\", \\"You Will See\\", \\"Last Night on Earth\\", \\"Little Piece of Me\\" and \\"Take Your Pleasure\\". She pokes fun at reality TV with \\"Next Best Superstar\\" and the album has it's obligatory yet heart-felt ballads in \\"Better Off Alone\\" and \\"You'll Get Yours\\". Some reviewers have mentioned that none of her songs are \\"radio ready\\", but I have to disagree, I could see any number of tracks fitting into some of the various music genres available on the airwaves. Americans need to re-discover the talent of the artist formerly known as Sporty Spice. Forget that she was on-fifth of the musical phenomena the Spice Girls, Melanie C's music stands on it's own merits and she'll be around making great music for quite some time. For any Melanie C fan, purchasing this album is a no brainer.
B00001U0DP|4.0|Mixing humor and the Holocaust isn't anything new: Ernst Lubitsch's 'To Be Or Not To Be' is just one enduring classic; Mel Brooks' 'The Producers' is another; and 'Life Is Beautiful' has the small-town charm and ambiance of 'Amarcord,' and light-straight satire of 'The Great Dictator.'<br /><br />Set against the stark reality of World War II Europe, Roberto Benigni's sentimental fable is not a film about the Holocaust, it's a film about life and hope merely against the backdrop of the Holocaust... It's not a denial of the Holocaust, it is a manifestation that humor itself can be courage... It's not about betraying the experience of millions of Jews, it is about the great lengths a father will go to protect his family from the horrors of the Nazis... It's a demonstration of the power of cinema, it's art without claim, hope without fear, dreams without limitations... It's a motion picture about love, not a documentary about the Nazis... It delivers a powerful message that despite everything--life is truly beautiful...<br /><br />The story begins in 1939 Italy, where a simple, free-spirited Italian Jew Guido Orefice (Benigni) and his poet friend Ferrucio (Sergio Bini Bustic) have dreams of owning their own bookstore... For now, however, Guido must be satisfied to wait tables, while Ferrucio is unable to get a job...<br /><br />Benigni's character is introduced during a long set of fast comedy scenes, particularly when he meets a cute gentile woman, Dora--Nicoletta Braschi, Benigni's real-life wife... When she 'falls out of the sky,' and he quickly nicknames her 'Principessa'... When he rides, in a fascist ball, on a horse painted green... When he turns a gloomy rainy night into a red carpet event... When he is caught by the Nazis as he hurries about securing the safety of his wife and son.. When his car speeds, without brakes, through a village and is mistaken for a king...<br /><br />Guido falls hard for the radiant schoolteacher, daughter of a wealthy family, and pursues her with all the charm and imagination he can discharge... In one sequence he pretends to be a school inspector and gives an impromptu speech on racial superiority before the assembled students and teachers, ending with a striptease...<br /><br />That hilarious side of the film takes up the first half... Benigni (who also wrote and directed) borrows a bit of Chaplin's grace and a bit of Groucho Marx charm... All of the action is so neatly contrived that the film essentially ends when it's over, and then begins again with the introduction of Guido and Dora's cute five-year-old son Giosue (Giorgio Cantarini) few years later...<br /><br />There, in 1945, we catch a glimpse of their enchanting household, but things are soon shattered, and the Nazis take Guido, with his tolerant uncle (Giustino Durano) and little Giosue off to an unidentified concentration camp... Dora races to the train station and demands to be put also on the train...<br /><br />At the death camp, and in order to protect his son from the nightmare of the place, Guido uses his imagination by creating the illusion that everything that's happening is just a game, an epic game that will be exciting and fun...<br /><br />He convinces Giosue that by hiding from the Gestapo soldiers (whom he refers to simply as the \\"men who yell a lot\\") and maintaining silence, he can gain the necessary points to win a tank... Not a toy tank, but a full-size tank, which they'll be free to take home...<br /><br />As co-writer, Benigni (with Vincenzo Cerami), doesn't just mix drama and comedy, he often hides drama in the comedy... The film does not dwell on the horrors of the camp, nor does it ignore them...<br /><br />With a memorable score by Nicola Piovani, \\"Life Is Beautiful\\" is an important film, triumphant, timeless, and sublime... It manages to entertain, educate, and move with its potent combination of humor, poignancy, and dignity... Roberto Benigni has taken pure horror and turned it into a love story between aman and a woman, between a father and his son... As an actor, Benigni manages with his wise and simple performance to make us laugh in tragic situations... He was very realistic, natural, distant from great special effects, far from Hollywood style, only nice and beautiful cinema...<br /><br />The film won Academy Awards for Best Actor, Best Foreign Film and Best Dramatic Score...o a love story between a man and a woman, between a father and his son...

1400032717|5.0|Much like the wonderfully written Forrest Gump, The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time puts you in the mind of the protagonist and forces you to read with their mentality. As you read this book, you can't help but begin to think like an autistic and develop a wonderful appreciation for what it's like to live with autism. <br /> <br />Centered around the death of a neighbor's dog and the subsequent false accusations and ensuing investigation, the book becomes a roller coaster of emotions as the reader feels joy on one page only to be replaced with sorrow on the next and then celebration on the next. <br /> <br />In the end, this book is a wonderful celebration of those living with autism and should be mandatory reading for all those who are not so that we can all better understand the truths and falsehoods about what we believe autism to be.
B00003CXD5|5.0|Having had his day as an idolized star and romantic leading man, it was now time for Bogart to get down to the serious business of acting... For eighteen years it had usually been Bogart playing Bogart in various shadings... Now that Bogart was gone and in his place was an older and far less romantic figure, one who found new challenges and was able to meet most of them successfully... This new phase of his continued growth began with a story of three men in search of gold...<br /><br />Although \\"The Treasure of the Sierra Madre\\" is indisputably one of Bogart's best films, it was co-star Walter Huston who won an Academy Award as did the movie's director and scenarist, John Huston...<br /><br />Based on a novel by the mysterious B. Traven, the film told a riveting tale which explored the degenerative effects of encroaching greed, distrust, and hatred on three prospectors who team up to search for gold in Mexico...<br /><br />Bogart's Fred C. Dobbs was an amazingly complex creation whose slow disintegration into paranoia was brilliant1y managed on camera... He is a born loser with no potential for change in sight... Suspicious, unfeeling, savage, and easily corruptible, he seems clearly destined for a tragic fate almost from our first meeting with him...<br /><br />Tim Holt was also excellent as Bob Curtin, a man who, like Bogart, is tempted but whose conscience will not permit him to exercise his baser desires. (He could have let Bogart die in a cave-in, but saved him instead.) Young, impressionable, and unprepared, he has never seen the likes of a Fred C. Dobbs and he finds himself overwhelmed and uncertain as to how he will cope with Dobbs's rage and greed...<br /><br />However, it is the director's father, Walter Huston, who literally stole the picture from both Bogart and Holt as he played Howard, a wise old toothless codger who knew all along what would happen and took it all in stride, kicking up his heels and having a marvelous time... Life can't surprise him any more... He's already had successes and failures enough for one lifetime... Like a faithful dog, he's along for the thrill of the hunt, and should there be another pot of gold at the end of this rainbow, well, that's just a bonus...<br /><br />It is mainly the interaction of these three men from their first meeting and uneasy partnership through their final confrontation that made \\"The Treasure of the Sierra Madre\\" one of Warner Brothers' triumphs of the forties...t surprise him any more...

Nine leather-vested members of this small bunch, board a subway leaving their Coney Island turf and travel to Van Cortland Park in The Bronx...<br /><br />The 'Warriors' are only one of many in New York street gangs who have sent representatives to a unification meeting called by Cyrus (Roger Hill), the lord of the largest and most powerful gang in the city, the Gramercy Riffs--a black gang all in their silk pajamas and Kung Fu shirts...<br /><br />Cyrus speaks to the huge gathering, explaining that all the gangs must unite, that together they outnumber the police three to one, that together they can consolidate forces and rule the city...<br /><br />There is wild cheering... And suddenly, out of no where, a mean, small-minded person pulls his gun and shoots to kill...<br /><br />The cowardly little guy of the Rogues quickly yells out that is was Cleon (Dorsey Wright), the Warriors' chief, who killed the legendary leader...<br /><br />In the confusion, and while the police crowds into the park and the congregated gangs flee, Cleon 'get busted' by those who think he murdered Cyrus...<br /><br />Without their leader, the Warriors 'got to stick together, and fight-to-survive.'

B00003CXI1|3.0|After watching the first four movies I finally decided to have a look at the book to see things at their source, so to say, and found it satisfying.<br /><br />The first point I wish to stress is that the first movie is a more than adequate rendering of the book: some of the plot has been changed but the atmosphere is just the same. Where he movie clearly surpasses the book itself is the visualisation: Ms Rowling has no outstandin talent for -or is just not interested in- the settings while the scenographers of the movie clearly have, plenty of... Hogwarts and the other minor locations, which are so very much alive and impressive in the movies, are rather dim in the first book.<br /><br />If the scenes are outright beautiful they are also the main asset of the film. Acting is fine, of course, there being so many competent British actors; the children are convincing too but this too, one has begun to take for granted.<br /><br />Direction and screenplay are not up to this level and this nearly spoils the fun: the movie is slow, and the dialogues put in the mouths of the actors really put their talent to test. Maggie Smith in particular has been given lines so silly I really hope she has been well paid to pronounce them.
B00008972S|5.0|Shakespeare's classic 'Romeo and Juliet,' is transported by Robert Wise, beyond the conventional movie musical, to modern-day New York City...<br /><br />Shakespeare's Montagues and Capulets become two rival teen-age street gangs: the 'American' Jets and the Puerto Rican Sharks... The two young idealistic lovers enhance the attractiveness of two nice kids, caught in racial and ethnic barriers... They are victims of the intolerance, misunderstanding, and mistrust that seem to be ever-present in human society... The film (nominated for an incredible 11 Academy Awards) took home an incredible 10 Oscars including Best Picture, Best Supporting Actor (George Chakaris), Best Supporting Actress (Rita Moreno), and Best Direction (Robert Wise and Jerome Robbins).<br /><br />The opening of West Side Story is very innovative... As the overture plays, an abstract design on the screen changes color and becomes a breathtaking aerial view of the island of Manhattan... The camera finally swings down to the West side of New York, where the Jets are snapping their fingers as they walk the streets... Their hated Puerto Rican rivals, the Sharks appear, charged with aggressive energy... Both gangs compete for the control of the poor and filth neighborhood...<br /><br />Jerome Robbins's powerful choreography captures the explosive tension boiling in the big city slums... The streets (with their flick knives and razors) come alive with athletic young dancers... The tender lyrics and poignant music complement and balance the tough nature of the choreography... The songs advance the plot, and illustrate the action... They range from jazzy and feverish to lyrical to comical, and they are all richly evocative of the film's moods and characters...<br /><br />In \\"Maria,\\" Tony gives voice to his feelings about the girl he has come to love... In \\"I Feel Pretty,\\" Maria describes her own reactions to the miracle of love...<br /><br />Before their lives turn bleak, the two lovers express their joy in soaring music: Tony with his hopeful 'Something's Coming,' Maria with her entrancing 'I Feel Pretty,' accompanied by Anita and her teasing friends... Their love blossoms out on a poignant scene in \\"Tonight,\\" and at a bridal shop (\\"One hand, One Heart\\") when both affirm their love for each other by celebrating a mock marriage ceremony...<br /><br />'West Side Story' is a beautiful work of art with spectacular music and energetic dancing... It is surely the finest dance musical since 'Seven Brides for Seven Brothers.' The principal dance numbers are all terrific... The propulsive movement of Riff and the Jets as contrasted with the free movement of Bernardo and the Sharks...<br /><br />Rita Moreno is spitfire as Anita... Her skillful dancing and Latin temperament are perfect for the character of Anita, a fiery lady who leads her girls in an exciting mambo dance... \\"Life is alright in America\\" is possibly the most triumphant sequence of the film...

It breaks new ground in its depiction of contemporary social issues in a musical... The motion picture explores with deep emotional resonance, a world of hate, violence and prejudice... It challenges all of us to struggle for understanding and justice...<br /><br />History will remember Leonard Bernstein as the most important American musical force in the 20th Century...

B000EJ9MTW|5.0|Take the energetic, \\"gonna tell you how it is\\", emotion from Zach De La Rocha of Rage Against the Machine and combine it with loud, raw and early sounds of Led Zeppelin and Black Sabbath and you get close to these guys.  They have this scream-from-a-mountain-top-like-you-mean-it sound where most songs musically build up to a climax... soar... then bring you even higher.  This album is packed with good tracks, song after song.  They got noticed from playing/touring live, and this album has a live but still clean cut powerful sound.  This album is currently triple platinum in Australia (their home).  I'm surprised it hasn't exploded bigger in the states yet.  Definitely get this if you want to get excited through music again.

B00000G3I2|5.0|<br />I love The Big Chill. The first time I saw it I was just a teen and thought how great it would be to grow up and be so close with such a great group of friends. Now, 20 years later, I am drawn to the movie every so often as a reminder of how great it is to have long-lasting friendships and all the drama that goes along with that (good and bad).  <br /> <br />The soundtrack is like a character all its own in this movie, as fully deserving as all other characters for all the air time it gets.  <br /> <br />Because of some drug use in the movie, it's doubtful you'll find this played on TV much (without a lot of editing any way). That's one of the reasons I had to buy it--to have the full movie in all its glory.  <br /> <br />

B000E1ZBGS|1.0|I absolutely love Jane Austen and this movie did not do justice to the story.  There were so many historical inaccuracies I don't know where to begin.   <br /> <br />The Bennetts did not live on a dirty farm.  Mr. Bennett was a Gentleman part of the upper middle class and would have had property supporting that status.  He wouldn't have lived on a farm and he wouldn't have had a dog in the house.  They would have had a carriage. <br /> <br />Mr. Wickham was almost nonexistent. <br />Miss Bingley looked like she was wearing a corset at the Netherfield Ball  The costuming was wrong all around.    <br /> <br />Lizzy never was intentionally mean in her teasing.  There was one spot in the movie where I was wanting to scream because they changed the dialog from the book.  Where she's at Netherfield and she and Darcy are having one of many verbal sparing matches and he's talking about pride being a failing in the movie they have her saying, \\"I love to laugh, but I cannot\\"  However <br />in the book she says, \\"That is a failing indeed, but I cannot laugh at it\\".   <br /> <br />Mr. Darcy walks into the Collins' home in the middle of the night into her bedroom without anyone hearing him?  Outside of that being a no-no particularly back then, The Collins' at least had a servant.  <br /> <br />Lady Catherine Jeudi Dench was a great Lady Cathrine.  Which is why I don't mind paying the rental fee.  However she wouldn't have come to the Bennett's house in the middle of the night to have it out with Lizzy.  What's the point of mentioning the Bennett's have a small park on one side of the house if you're not going to walk in it.  The argument between Lady Cathrine and Lizzy is one of the best cat fights in literature and they ruin it. <br /> <br />Mr. Bingley is portrayed as a bumbling idiot and Darcy has to work with him to get the nerve up to ask Jane.  When he had his mind made up in the first place and was a bit upset when Darcy concealed Jane being in town. <br /> <br />Georgiana Darcy was not outgoing.  In fact she was rather shy.  <br /> <br />There are so many more things I could mention, but I think I've made my point.  I have no problems with modernized versions of Pride and Prejudice, but if your going to do it within a period piece that's where I draw the line.  Either do the proper research of the period and get it right or don't do it at all.

0451196716|4.0|In reading The Long Walk, I think it's important to make the distinction between a Stephen King novel and a Richard Bachman novel.  The essay at the beginning of The Long Walk, \\"The Importance of Being Bachman,\\" talks about why Stephen King decided that he needed to create an alter ego who could say the things that he could not. The Bachman alter ego is darker than king, has a different sort of humor, and is not the sort of man you'd want to invite to dinner. Accordingly, though all King novels have an element of despair and darkness, The Long Walk is a study in endurance, human nature, and the will to live. One hundred boys start out on May 1st walking with no particular destination in mind, but with the idea that they will either value their lives enough to walk through any pain, struggle, or obstacle in their way or that they will die, shot in the head in front of their peers who actually do have the motivation to continue. This book was horrific in its honesty, startling in its depth. If you're a fan of Stephen King, I think you'll enjoy this book, but it is also important to know the difference between King and Bachman.

B000E5N62U|3.0|So it took Donald over a decade to collect enough songs that he considered worthy of a solo album. My question then, is: Where did the good songs go? As someone who has been listening to Steely Dan since I bought \\"Can't Buy A Thrill\\" with my pre-teen allowance money, I have just about everything recorded by Becker and Fagen in the many decades they've been making music. But \\"Morph The Cat?\\" Where are the hooks? Where are the memorable lines? And what happened to the variety?<br /><br />\\"Morph The Cat\\" lacks those qualities. Frankly, only the title song is remotely memorable, and one of the main hooks is the unfortunate line \\"Christmas without the chintzy stuff.\\" Even more unfortunate is that, for a change, the irony of using the word \\"chintzy\\" is unintentional. For Donald Fagen, that could be a first. Songs on this CD are often reflections of better songs (like \\"Security Joan\\" to \\"Cousin Dupree\\") that wouldn't hold a candle to any given song on \\"Pretzel Logic\\" or \\"The Nightfly.\\" Only \\"What I Do,\\" a conversation between Fagen and the ghost of Ray Charles, rates comparison to Fagen's finest.<br /><br />That is a real drag. Even the lamest Steely Dan records courted enough variety to not get boring. \\"Morph the Cat\\" refuses to morph into much of anything except aural wallpaper. I bought this CD back in the spring and have returned to it only a few times since, hoping that something would grab me that I'd previously missed. No such luck. \\"Morph The Cat\\" falls flat...and not on its feet.

1932907009|5.0|I just started reading \\"Save The Cat!\\" last week and the first thing I did after reading the chapter on writing a successful logline was to rewrite a logline for a script I had posted on Inktip.com. Less than HOUR after changing my logline I received an email from a major production company asking to read my script! Coincidence? I doubt it. The script (with the old logline) had been available on Inktip for weeks but I'd received 0 requests for it until I'd implemented Snyder's suggestions for writing successful -- and all-important -- loglines. If you don't believe Blake Snyder when he talks about the importance of the logline, think again. It's hard enough to get something read in this industry, even with a strong logline, but without one it's almost impossible, so Snyder's words of advice on this subject are gold. Of course, that's just one chapter. I haven't finished reading the book yet because I keep implementing Snyder's concepts as I go along and I can clearly see the improvement in my work. I can't recommend \\"Save The Cat!\\" strongly enough! If you don't have it and you hope to sell a script in Hollywood, I suggest you buy it now!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Joss Whedon creates a fantastic jigsaw puzzle of interlocking characters.  So many people with so little in common are forced together by circumstance to prove that the most disparate personalities still depend on one another; the whole is greater that the sum of its parts.  Crafted with insightful humor and a sublime understanding of human nature, the only thing you'll regret about getting to know the crew of Serenity is the finite number of episodes.

B000AU9UYM|5.0|After the disaster of Batman and Robin in 1997, it took almost nine years to get the nasty, foul taste out of mouths and appreciate the next generation of Batman movies.  Finally, Warner Brothers takes their cash cow seriously and appoints a smart and respectful director, writer and actor to create the newest version of the Dark Knight.<br /><br />Christopher Nolan, well known for directing intelligent, serious movies [...] turns his attention toward making this movie about Batman's origin.  Thankfully discarded are all the previous Batman movies, despite any good aspects they may have had, this movie says `Forget it all, this is one that matters'.  And it really does.<br /><br />The movie is efficient in it's story telling, starting somewhere in the mountains of Asia (intercut with flashbacks) where Bruce Wayne (played with great tension by Christian Bale) is in a prison camp, effectively fighting off any attempts to kill him.  He gets locked up to keep the other prisoners from being hurt.  He is visited by Henri Ducard (Liam Neeson), and offered a chance to learn everything he needs to know to become that which he needs to be; a weapon to avenge his parents who were killed when he was a child.  Wayne accepts and spends more time in a remote location learning the arts of Ninjitsu and stealth.<br /><br />Upon his return to Gotham City, the movie starts to focus on how Bruce plans to be the Batman.  It's a painstaking process, and extremely believable.  Luckily he has the resources through his Father's Enterprise and turn-a-blind-eye science executive Lucius Fox (well played by Morgan Freeman) and the faithful butler Alfred (the always welcome Michael Caine) to help.  As the current CEO of Wayne Enterprises Earle (Rutger Hauer) continues to make unwanted to changes, Bruce slowly finds ways to create the personality he wants to instill fear into the scum of Gotham, believing the city can be saved from it's downfall into debauchery.  With his childhood sweetheart (Katie Holmes) trying to figure him out, a madman Psychologist (Cillian Murphy) sending criminals to Arkham Asylum for seemingly no reason, the new vigilante finds himself bonding with James Gordon (underplayed brilliantly by Gary Oldman), one good cop surrounded by many corrupt ones, and getting more out of the relationship than he ever thought he would.  Thankfully they are giving this relationship it's proper attention that was lost in the other movies.<br /><br />As you can see, the casting of this movie is brilliant.  You may not know who Christian Bale is, but Michael Caine?  Gary Oldman?  Morgan Feeman?  Rutger Hauer?  Liam Neeson?  Katie Holmes?  If you don't know who any of these people are, you shouldn't be going to the movies.  Front and center is semi new comer Christian Bale playing the part of Bruce Wayne and Batman so well.  When in the costume, he's intimidating and frightening.  When playing Bruce Wayne, he's a pompus, arrogant playboy, although that does not come about right away.  The genius of this movie stands in the discovery; as Bruce Wayne finds the difficulties in being a masked crusader in a huge city, he has to find solutions to those problems.  The realism that goes into the creation of this dark obsessed person focusing his energy on becoming an outrageous character that preys on the criminal element is sublime and spot on.  This movie far outreaches it's predecessors in ambition and makes them look like kindergarten efforts compared with the PhD level of intelligence put into this film.

While you may not agree with everything he is or does, you will certainly enjoy the ride through his life this book takes you on.  You may even learn something about yourself along the way.

B000K7VHQ4|4.0|I don't know why my expectations with The Illusionist were set for an average movie. Must've been something that I read. In contradiction to whatever it was that set my expectations low, I will set yours relatively high.<br /><br />The Illusionist was thoroughly entertaining from start to finish. And it's basically a 4-person show by Edward Norton (Eisenheim the Illusionist), Paul Giamatti (Inspector Uhl), Jessica Biel (Sophie) and Rufus Sewell (The Crown Prince); All 4 giving real A-list performances.<br /><br />Perhaps my low expectations were because The Illusionist was released right around the same time as Christopher Nolan's The Prestige, and I therefore at the time had a case of Magician-Movie-Overload. Regardless, I'm glad I opted to spend the time with The Illusionist during its first week on DVD. It was so good that, after viewing it on the way home from a business trip, I watched a second showing at home with my wife.<br /><br />My wife liked the movie as much as I did, and that's saying a lot based on her usual \\"where do you find these movies\\" comment after watching one of my DVD picks.<br /><br />The Illusionist is part Romeo and Juliet period drama based in turn of the century (no not the last one, the one before) Vienna.  It's part psychological drama...a kind of whodunit with a clever, but somewhat predictable twist. And the Illusionist is part magic show.<br /><br />A lot of the tricks in The Illusionist are movie magic...in fact most are movie magic and could only be done as so. Don't expect to go into this movie and be truly amazed by wizardry. But the tricks are a very fun part of the movie, and I believe the intention was to deliberately raise the question of how tales of necromancy could have been inspired. The answer? Mass hypnotism (purely my own speculation of the movie's intent).<br /><br />My recommendation is to see for yourself.
0553804677|4.0|I found this book via Livejournal, I believe through the journal of Elizabeth Bear, which led me to journal for Scott Lynch. I liked his posts enough (the writing style and attitude, etc), and tLoLL was highly praised enough, that I went ahead and bought it, despite the fact that I rarely purchase hardcover books by authors whose writing is unknown to me. <br /> <br />I'm awfully glad I did. Although I think my wallet may be a little annoyed...this is going to be a series, <br />which means I will have a number more hardcover books to buy! <br /> <br />OK, to the meat of the thing: <br />I very much enjoyed this book. The characters were engaging, the plot was suitably complex, and I wasn't able to guess every twist and turn. I particularly liked the character development -- even the characters I didn't like, I didn't like for good reason! I've seen reviews (and read one particular reader-author interchange) that mention the swearing by the characters. Yes, there is a good bit of swearing, but it's not *that* much, and it is all appropriate to both the characters, the world, and the story. <br /> <br />It took a bit for me to get used to the timeline jumping, but once I did, it became obvious that this was the best way to tell the story. I was *really* confused at the beginning by the references to Sabetha, who we didn't see in either the childhood interludes OR in the present-time episodes, and that was mildly irritating. But it mostly just served to make me more curious and provided more incentive to keep reading. <br /> <br />One thing I did not like, which is really more of a pet peeve of mine, is the (over)use of italics. I thought the italics were really unnecessary for emphasis, and since at times their presence made me stop, and re-read a sentence to put the emphasis in the proper place (instead of where it sounded right in MY head), it was really annoying. Some words being italicized (such as garrista ) was acceptable, and would have actually seemed wrong had they NOT been italicized. <br /> <br />All in all, a great new voice, and I'm really looking forward to what happens next with Locke & Jean! Oh, and to find out some of the answers to questions raised in this book!
B00005JO20|2.0|I'm not going to critisize the plot of the film because it ultimately adheres quite closely to the original 1933 Merian C. Cooper version of the film. However this film is 187min long and in order to fill this extra time it digresses into silly nonsense for large portions of the film.  A problem I had was that while watching it I was constantly being reminded of other films like `Jurassic Park' (Dinosaurs share characteristics) `Apocalypse Now' (one person is reading Heart of Darkness)  `Lord Of The Rings' (Villagers mannerisms are similar to Gollum) and `Titanic' to name a few. Another problem I have is with the cinematography, which is just too colourful for my palette. Of courses there is an unnecessary excess of CGI in this film. There was a time when special affects were used in films to create the illusion of reality now special affects seem to be used to make things seem unreal. We can easily sit now and point out what is CGI and what is not and besides some of it is so appallingly bad it's hard to miss, the dinosaur stampede especially. As for the attempt to develop a relationship between Ann Darrow and the 25 ft ape, it is completely laughable.<br /><br />I had high hopes for the Lord Of The Rings trilogy and was disappointed so I wasn't really expecting much here. For me Peter Jackson's best two films will always be `Bad Taste' (1989) and `Brain Dead' (1992). I prefer the original King Kong over this boring nonsense any day.

0441172717|5.0|I must admit that I am not a huge fiction reader, much less a science fiction reader.  It is not that I don't have the imagination, it is just that most works of science fiction seem...dry...to me.  Yes I enjoyed the Foundation series, way long ago.  And while I might have enjoyed the Star Wars movies (IV-VI), I really can't stand reading the novels.  Yes I like Doctor Who, but I don't focus my every waking hour reading and watching the series.  Then there's Dune.  I've wanted to read Dune for a long time now.  I've bought the book, usually a cheep used paper back, got through the first page and a half, then forgot about it.  Maybe it just wasn't my time to read the work, you see.  Now I am.  And I am amazed.  The work is one of the best fiction novels out there, by far.  Now this isn't hard science fiction, you don't get pages after pages of science gobbledygook like you may with other writers, instead the setting is the future...yes...but the story itself is timeless in the sense of what Joseph Campbell would consider the \\"hero's quest\\" story.  Thus the story is not just about a far future society, it is about mythology, politics, ecology, all wrapped together and expanded upon.  What I find most interesting is, if you have actually looked at any of my other reviews, that this work has a very theological point of view expressed upon it.  Not really Western theology nor Eastern philosophy, but an intrinsically woven together theology.  While I may not agree with it per say as I am a Christian, within the story's context, I'm amazed and astounded at how well it works.  I really suggest anyone and everyone who has half a brain should read this work.  It will do wonders for you.
B000F3T3CS|5.0|I just wanna add my praise to this performance which I think is incredible from start to finish. Netrebko and Villazon are incredible actors and singers, for me surpassing Alagna and Georghiu in the Lyon version. Even though Leo Nucci may be too old for the role, his acting is really superb (we all knew his singing was great)I had never seen him in a comic opera before). In short, we have three of todays greatest stars, so it could not be anything but great. The performance never drags and is really fun to watch, and is also excellently singed. <br /> <br />The only thing which was a bit of a problem for me was the audio, with the sound of the voices varying a bit depending on the location of the singers, which I assume, was due to a not ideal microphones placement. Nevertheless, it was very good in general. <br /> <br />I completely disagree with Mr. Erik remarks about Netrebko's attitude. This is not an opera seria, but an opera buffa, and it's great to see that the singers are having so much fun, which they transmit to the audience. <br /> <br />The best available Elisir!

So Dahlia is trying to find a lawyer, get the plumbing in the upstairs apartment, which is leaking into her bedroom fixed, and deal with Cecilia's sudden development of an imaginary friend, and finding a new job. <br /> <br />Dahlia suffers from severe and frequent migraines and her ex is charging that she is mentally unstable and unfit to care for their child. Finally, getting a lawyer she begins to take charge of her life. She tries to find the source of the water leaking from upstairs and learns that the family moved out and the daughter has the same name as Cecilia's imaginary friend. The lawyer takes each issue at face value as Dahlia seems to be degenerating into insanity.  <br /> <br />The audience can see things going on that the major characters don't see and so you're left wondering what is going to happen next. The film is dark and creepy but far more psychologically creepy than scary for most of the film. Of course, just when you think things may turn out okay there are several twists that pull the rug out from under the viewer. But this is a bleak film about love and family -- it may be hard to watch not for the violence, horror, or whatever but because in spite of the supernatural aspects it hits close to the heart for many people with less than ideal family situations.
B000K7VHQ4|5.0|We rented this video and watched it two nights in a row.  It is a terrific mystery, love story, period piece that is superbly acted and beautifully filmed.  This movie is destined to become a classic.  The music is perfectly complementary to the story.  The sets could not be better done.  The story could not be more captivating.  The movie is filmed in Prague and the buildings and street scenes are entirely convincing for the period.  I bought the video this morning, and I will probably be giving it to friends as a present in 2007.  We loved it...
B00005JOLI|4.0|Boy, am I glad I did not see the movie that you one and two star reviewers saw. I saw the one that the three and four star reviewers did. It is no LOTR, granted. No fantasy film is and, perhaps, none ever will be that fantastic. It will be virtually impossible to replicate the product presented by Peter Jackson.  However, with that said, \\"Eragon\\" the movie retains the spirit of the book, if not all of the details. Time compression is necessary when carrying a book to the screen (PJ did it at the beginning of FOTR). It is not a direct copy of \\"Star Wars\\", which borrowed heavily from LOTR in the first place. It is simply another fantasy presentation of the battle between good and evil, the corruption of power and the quest to control all peoples in a given geographical area.  I especially enjoyed the performance of newcomer Edward Speleers and Jeremy Irons. Incidentally, the White Witch of Narnia was played by Tilda Swinton. She does not play Arya.(see the 12/15/06 review)  I believe we have become over-analyzers thanks to 24 hour news networks that cover topics ad nauseam. Go to the movie. Don't expect an LOTR production, but enjoy it. I am sorry that we will, most likely, not see a movie production of \\"Eldest\\".

Do yourself a favor, buy Peter Gabriel's Passion.  Even though The Last Temptation of Christ may not have been the best movie, the soundtrack was, one of my favorites.

B000JJS8TM|5.0|This is the \\"soundtrack\\" to the Cirque du Soleil Las Vegas show \\"The Beatles: Love.\\" First, the disc is a must for any Beatles fan--a furious re-engineering (by Sir George Martin and his son Giles) of the original tracks to create one complete opera.  The result is precisely what you'd want, using only original materials.  Second, the Audio DVD in the bonus set (which costs less at Amazon than the single CD at most every other website and retail location I could find) will blow you away in the 5.1 format of your choice. <br /> <br />I bought two of this set from Amazon for a few pennies less than the cost for one set from the \\"Seen on TV\\" ad.
B000J103PC|5.0|For the story, I'd give the film two stars. Treacly tripe tale of tough times for tomboy girl Friday with tender time-worn tereotypes. Okay I made that last word up, but you get the picture.<br /><br />We can see why both the book and the movie were hits. Girl goes to big city, big city cruel, girl grows apart from friends who serve as proxy family/emotional support base (and noble boyfriend in a respectable but blue-collar profession), glamorous world beckons, internal conflict = is this really who I am?<br /><br />No, it isn't. You should be teaching nursery school is some forgotten prairie town in the great flyover, the characters of oh-so-NYC spit back at you. A big green-gobby Brooklyn nouveau riche spit.<br /><br />Szzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz.<br /><br />The story actually has a lot pull, as big cities are filled with ambitious inexperienced young women who are used, abused, and amused (and amusing) by their tyrannical bosses. Hera and Minerva could both go on a tear if the virgin daughters of Greece made no obeisance, so that part of the tale isn't fresh either.<br /><br />So what saves it and merits five stars?<br /><br />Meryl Streep.<br /><br />I've loathed lots of roles Ms. Streep has incarnated during the arc of her career of selectively playing \\"strong\\" women (always remember \\"The River Wild\\" for you Seven-degrees-of-Kevin-Bacon fans).<br /><br />Not this time. Meryl Streep delivers a hands down ten star flawless performance in this film. I re-wound every scene she was in and played it again. She is that good.<br /><br />It is difficult to overstate how flawless this performance is, for it is perfectly balanced. In the hands of another actress, the character Miranda Priestly would have become a cartoon of a Mrs. Danvers. Streep is neither understated and creepy, nor overstated and buffoonish. It is *just*right* and that, perhaps, is the most difficult thing to do when playing a villainess.<br /><br />Stanley Tucci's performance is also excellent. Easily a five star movie and a great movie for couples.ent. Easily a five star movie and a great movie for couples.

Meryl's talents are creatively supported by a superb script heartily embraced by a supporting cast that affix the plot with an accurate reality.

B00026WUBE|5.0|This ol' rocker first heard Planet Waves in a Navy barracks out in Lamoore Naval Station, CA in the early 80s.  I was particularly taken by two songs, the second version of Forever Young and the last track Wedding Song.  Wedding Song goes back to the original Dylan-with-acoustic-guitar-and-harmonica era.  I'll say one thing, neither version of Forever Young sounds like Rod Stewart's rendition, but then, what Dylan song ever sounds remotely like his when covered by anyone else anyway, know what I'm sayin'?  I had to go through Helen Highwater to get this album, too.  After I left Lamoore, I couldn't find it then forgot about it for a big bunch of years.  When I started getting stuff from Amazon, I saw it listed in a Dylan list and ordered it.  Well, I kept getting messages amounting to \\"we're trying to find it for you, please be patient.\\"  That turned into \\"there's a problem filling your order,\\" wich I took for a bad sign.  After a few months, Amazon had to admit defeat and cancel my order with sincere regrets, so I wrote it off with a sigh.  A couple of years later, just for grins and giggles, I checked, and lo and behold, it was available, for real this time.  I ordered it for Christmas, got it, wrapped it it up and put it under the tree.  After we'd opened all the gifts and cleaned up the place, I put all the CDs I got together to file on the shelves later.  Well, when I went to put them up, Planet Waves wasn't with the other CDs.  It was simply gone, the one CD I craved the most.  All that waiting and anticipation for nothing....  After searching throughout the house several times, I wound up reordering it and got it (again) rather quickly - whew!  Needless to say, all that angst has caused me to enjoy it even more.  To me, it was more than worth it and is my favorite Dylan CD.  I highly recommend it as a transitional album between the \\"old\\" Dylan and his style of today.  Every song comes from the heart, and considering the amount of music for which he's responsible, that's saying a lot.

0062515675|1.0|Another author that tries to enlighten others by weaving his teachings into an incredibly shallow story. I felt the same way about The Celestine Prophesy.  The Alchemist was better, and The Way of the Peaceful Warrior was the best in this genre.  There are lots of wonderful and intelligent books out there for spiritual growth.  This is maybe one for someone who's just getting their feet wet.
B0001GL3K4|5.0|I really love this movie.  Everything from the music to the actors......simply perfect!  I would recommend this film to anyone who loves a little romance mixed with light drama (Emma Thompson had the most dramatic part, and heartbreaking. She was perfect in her role).  Excellent film.  I believe this one will be one that I'll have and watch for a very very long time. Every actor in this movie played his/her role to absolute delight. If I could give this movie more than the 5 stars, I really would.
0307346609|5.0|If someone had told me at the beginning of 2006 that the best book I'd read all year was about zombies I would have rolled my eyes and told them to beat it. I have a mild appreciation for Night of the Living Dead but have always thought Romero's other work was one long snoozefest.  <br />Usually when fanboys write this kind of fiction it's turgid and self indulgent beyond belief. Quite the opposite here.  <br /> <br />Brooks is so at ease with his subject that he effortlessly makes the reader feel they are actually living in the aftermath of a war against the undead,and not in the cosseted 21st century with 300 pages of fiction in their hands. Cultural shorthand as resonant as '9/11' and 'Nagasaki' - single phrases that speak volumes - are introduced with such ease that when they appear again, further into the book, the reader just nods with a knowing satisfaction. Indeed one of these pieces of shorthand - referred to simply as 'Flight 575' - was merely alluded to in passing yet when the name surfaced again I had already constructed a whole backstory to support it.  <br /> <br />Where the real triumph of this piece lies, however, is in the different characters Brooks has constructed to voice the story. From feral child, through fey English historian, jaded ex-security guard to fedayeen-turned-athiest the author recounts this epic in a panoply of voices each of them cross referencing each other to weave a fuller picture of the war, and while Brooks is the interviewing thread that holds the narrative together his only prescence on the page is to gently prod his subjects to deliver their stories. <br />  <br />Meticulously researched (I can only imagine how much fun he had looking into the castles of Europe) and passionately written this is screaming out for a wider literary audience.

B000HEWEE4|5.0|I seem to recall that the professional reviewers did not like this movie when it was released.  I can't understand why.  This is a very fine, intelligent movie, with good peformances by all.  Don't analyze the time travel concept, just accept it and enjoy the romance.   I like the way the Paul McCartney song was used in the movie-the lyrics fit the scene.
0743270754|4.0|This book is written in history text style but is in general more compeliing than most texts. It's an interesting story of a leader who was wise enough not to surround himself with snycophants.
B000001ZS3|5.0|Do not look unfavorably upon this peenemundic project.  1976 PONG came out (and how far has computer gaming evolved).  Same holds true for electronica.  1976 OXYGENE was categorized under jazz (?). Now we know it as the Sputnik that changed the space and contour of a developing genre.  Jarre's musical elements built upon set confirurations offering a whole new order of dimentionality.  With this LP he expanded the ring of the horizon and allowed cosmic integration for a much greater spacial atmosphere.  With futuristic energy and french melancholy he released composition from the conventions of naturalism.  This progressive conviction to soar was expounded upon by numerous musicians to what we have today.  A potpouri of electronic space/thinking music.  The final oxygene track is the best arranged sculpted space you shall ever hear.
B000MNP2KI|5.0|I would have never expected the Bond producers to fire Brosnan, still in his prime, after the superb job he was doing. They let Roger Moore hang on for about 3 movies too long and Sean Connery a toupee and a pot-belly after they should have.   Even though the invisible car and the cheesiest of glacier waves in \\"Die Another Day\\" were both awful, it was unfair blaming them on Pierce. His separation from the Bond role just seemed wrong.  Then along comes CASINO ROYALE, easily one of the top three Bond films of all time and, time will tell, just maybe the very best. Sure, Connery was incredible in his 3-4 initial outings but it's hard to forget his uninterested look in \\"You Only Live Twice\\" and \\"Diamonds are Forever\\". By the end of CASINO ROYALE, when Craig finally utters the Bond, James Bond line with the Bond theme (finally) playing at full blast well....., let's just say the words JAMES BOND WILL RETURN never have been more welcomed.  It's great to see Bond come back to its roots without the fantasy elements of previous films. The construcion site chase was absolutely fantastic and the titles design, even without the customary dancing girls, are the best in the series, period.   Regarding future entries, I'm not sure if John Cleese's Q and Craig's 007 can co-exist but I do hope at least Monnypenny makes it back for Bond 22.

0060776757|5.0|This is the ultimate U2 tome. Take time to read it cover to cover and you'll come away with much more respect for the band and how they work together. You'll also learn a lot about how their albums were made, and get some fascinating insights into the meaning behind the songs. <br /> <br />Visually, the book is stunning. Gorgeous reproduction of some of the coolest images of the band I've ever seen. And the book is well laid out and designed, progressing from the early pre-\\"Boy\\" days through \\"How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb.\\" <br /> <br />Each band member talks in-depth about the experience of being in U2 and how the band operates both as a musical entity and as a business. (No matter what some fans think or would like to believe, U2 IS A BUSINESS, and a well-run, scrupulous one to be admired! Paul McGuiness is here too, and thank God the band found him years ago to run the money side!) Adam, Larry, Edge and Bono each come through as strong individual personalities, and they hold nothing back. Adam talks about his substance abuse, Larry about his unhappiness with the Pop album, Edge about the creative process and Bono about the death of his father. They all comment on 9/11 and how that tragic event affected their Elevation tour, and gave new meaning to their \\"All That You Can't Leave Behind\\" album. Honest, thought-provoking stuff. <br /> <br />Best of all, these guys come across as incredibly grounded and real. I have to say, I laughed a lot as I read this book, and got a little choked up, as well. To say this book is worth the investment is an understatement, especially if you are a serious U2 fan.

A Ryko remaster more than 15 years old was the best version of this I could find, but the CD layer on this hybrid SACD smokes! Ziggy now has bass, dynamics, and depth! This is the biggest improvement to an old title that I've come across - even greater than the 2002 DSD remaster of The Rolling Stones Beggars Banquet. This is the Ziggy to get whether you have a SACD player or just a standard CD player.
B00006DEFA|4.0|Purchased this to show to my family.  Amazon's web page for it shows a PG rating as was the original.

0446528056|4.0|Dear John isn't the book I normally read.  I read the Notebook and really didn't like it, but I know that Sparks is a great author and my wife reads everything he writes.  So I decided to read Dear John because it's a short easy read, my wife read it, and Sparks is a good author.  I'm a sucker for a good romantic movie, so maybe I'd like a romantic book.<br /><br />The book opens with a prologue about John Tyree and it appears to be set in the present.  My first thought was that this prologue gives away way too much of the plot.  Then chapter 1 begins seven years earlier.  John Tyree is a high school kid without direction.  He's had an okay life, being raised by his emotionless father, but senses he wants more.  This causes him to join the Army and the Army redirects his life and gives him focus.  He quits smoking and partying and becomes an excellent soldier.  At home on leave in Wilmington, North Carolina, he meets Savannah and they instantly become friends.  Savannah is a Christian girl two years younger than him that is beautiful and John falls for her.  I don't know what women readers think of John and Savannah, but John is a little rough around the edges, but chilverous and kind.  Savannah, is perfect, a pretty, kind, moral girl who any guy would fall for.<br /><br />I've read a few Christian novels in my time and the first half of the novel starts out like one, with Savannah the Christian girl and John the rough Army soldier.  Of course, this isn't a Christian novel and I didn't expect it to be.  However, Savannah does make some choices that I wish were explained better.  It's not that they aren't realistic, but the story is told from John's point of view, and it would have been nice to be inside Savanah's head for some of the novel so the reader could see her motivations for her action.  As a character, she had everything together.  Occasionally she acts on impulse, or seems too.  I'd like to know more about her thoughts before some of her actions in order to make them more believable.<br /><br />Sparks has stated that he is a writer of love stories, which he defines as stories with a tragic element.  Dear John is well written, with great characters and a good plot.  But to know that Sparks writes tragedies kind of spoils the fun.  I asked my wife and she said all his stories have an element of sadness.  Sparks would be a great author too if he added a few happy or at least bittersweet endings.  The plot of Dear John felt convoluted, like Sparks had to add some unrealistic twists in order to give the story an appropriate sadness.  Still, I understand his appeal.  I raced through this novel like few others.  Another minor complaint:  Sparks believes characters can have a love that is so strong it can force people to ignore marriage vows or moral principles.  That subject comes up in this novel, and (I promise I'm not giving anything away) characters seem to be ready to excuse certain behavior in the name of love.<br /><br />Dear John is a good book and I can see why Sparks is a bestseller.  John and Savannah are great characters as is Tim and John's father.  I recommend this book to anyone who likes tragic love stories.  Since I don't, I probably won't be reading more of Sparks any time soon even though I enjoyed his writing and characters very much.er to make them more believable. <br /> <br />Sparks has stated that he is a writer of love stories, which he defines as stories with a tragic element.

B0007Y08IS|5.0|This movie is so much fun and very comical. I enjoyed it from start to finish and appreciate how much work it took to make a movie with all puppets. The comentary was great and I loved watching how they made all the characters come to life. Puppets aren't the easiest stars to work with. Their body movements are very limited. The props are also incredible and extremely creative. What a great movie!! Extremely well done!!

B000ETQRCM|4.0|Eddie Vedder's grief over the death of close friend Johnny Ramone set the tone for this album, no better encapsulated than in the opener Life Wasted, which harnesses the jagged earnestness of Binaural and matches it to the odd meter experiments of Riot Act. The band charges through this track like a phoenix rising from the ashes, reinvented in the fire of mourning and a new appreciation of life. The resulting album is more consistent than their last two, consolidating their back catalogue, and in the process creating a sound similar to Yield with a few more curveballs; the dynamical stop/start of Severed Hand, Army Reserve's choppy, shanty rhythms and Big Wave a close cousin to Gremmie Out Of Control. These are topped off with the gentle fifties-style waltz of Come Back. The band also confidently channel their influences upfront, musically name checking The Beatles (Parachutes), Bruce Springsteen (Unemployable) and even themselves (World Wide Suicide) in the first half of the album. <br />Eddie Vedder continues to paint pictures with his lyrics; Gone is another road trip compilation track, World Wide Suicide runs on topical themes, whilst Marker In The Sand is rolling, brooding and hopeful. However, at times his vocal's need more accentuation, the mumbled delivery on World Wide Suicide deadens the songs impact. However this approach proves its worth on songs like Comatose. But ironically when Eddie gets the most strident and outward looking on a song like Inside Job the band don't always match him providing an unfocused soundtrack that doesn't do his lyrics justice. <br />I don't think even Pearl Jam predicted they'd last as long as this so its refreshing to know they still enjoy making music together and if they keep heading down this path, they could well become this generations equivalent to Bruce Springsteen. <br />
B000J10EQU|3.0|The initial reviews in the theaters were that Superman Returns breathed new life into a stale franchise, however I fail to see that.<br /><br />After astronomers find traces of his home planet Kryption, Superman vanishes from Earth for five years; only to return to find that... gee whiz... things have changed.  Lois has a son and a significant other, the people of Metropolis have largely forgotten him, and Lex Luthor has been released from prison because Superman couldn't appear at his appeal hearing.<br /><br />Alrighty then!  Let's just add legal/judicial cluelessness to the scientific cluelessness that so often drives a movie.  I can forgive either one, IF the plot keeps me from noticing the anamolies.  But in this case, it's just too much of a rehash of old story elements.  Now Lex is parlaying an ill-gotten inheritance into his quest for total domination of the world.<br /><br />Brandon Routh does a fine job of mimicking Christopher Reeve in the role, but let's face it, Reeve's Superman should really be a footnote (albeit a very bankable one) in his otherwise stellar career.  Kate Bostwick looks appropriately conflicted as Lois, pining for her superhero boyfriend of old and tending to her son and boyfriend (James Marsden).<br /><br />The only reasons worth watching are the villains, in the person of Lex Luthor (played by Kevin Spacey) and his moll played by Parker Posey.  Spacey actually makes a much better Luthor than did Gene Hackman back in the original series.  Note to Ms. Posey, if you really prefer evil geniuses... well... I can always change for the worse.

B000F1IQNM|4.0|Fun fantasy movie about a very weak father who gets a lot of help from a nanny with magical powers. No child rearing examples to follow but lots of laughs.
B000EHSVQ4|5.0|Unlike MOST \\"extended versions\\" (like Chronicles of Narnia!) -- this is the True Definition of EXTENDED!! <br /> <br />Seriously, when are the Studios going to STOP FORCING Director's to CUT their films due to \\"time\\"?!  This is just another example, of a Masterpiece - that was luckily still shot in it's entirety... with the hopes of making an Extended, \\"studio-absent\\" version.  50 Years ago, Studios Griped if a film was over 60 minutes.  After Gone With the Wind, and several others... a Decade or two later, the standard was 75... then 90.... and it's Stayed at 90 (for the most part) ever since. <br /> <br />Now, I agree - most films only need to be 90 minutes... and most films, need the \\"fat\\" trimmed from them to make the story better..... but when making an EPIC - you CAN NOT FORCE DIRECTORS TO SHRINK A 3.5 Hr FILM, into 2, 2.5 Hr Film -- and still make it as good!!! <br /> <br />Sorry, on to the film.  (I'm probably not spelling the names right, but who cares)  Cybilla had a SON!!  Baelian had a life prior to leaving... Liam Neisson (dad) had a FAMILY - ALIVE... I mean, there is more Character development & story than even I imagined... YET IT DOESN'T DETRACT, OR MAKE IT BORING! <br /> <br />Those are the only surprises in the E.V. I'll give away - but seriously, Special Features aside -- this E.V. is the ONLY version that should've seen the light of day.  Certain scenes make perfect sense, with better understanding of how & why (attack on Baelian & Dad in woods prior to Holy Land, relationship between Baelian & Cybilla, etc. etc. etc.) <br /> <br />Speaking of... their relationship (Baelian & Cybilla) is now much more than just a 1 nighter... Gees, so much to say, I can't even get it out!!  LOL  There's just too much GOOD, POSITIVE things to say -- and Don't want to ruin it for you when you 1st watch it. <br /> <br />Trust me -- I rarely write 5 Star Reviews... if there were a 10th Star -- I'd give it an 11.  Don't waste your money on the \\"Extended\\" Chronicles ofNarnia... or 99% of all the other \\"Extended\\" versions - which give you only 10 minutes of unseen footage, which NEVER did ANYTHING for the film in the 1st place!!!  BUY THIS (EXTENDED VERSION) MOVIE!!!  WHO CARES IF YOU HAVE THE ORIGINAL ALREADY - SO DO I -- SELL IT!! <br /> <br />Anyway - Way To Go Ridley Scott!!  And SHAME on the Studio - for being stuck in that \\"has to be shorter\\" mentality!  It's old & dated - especially concerning these types of movies!!  Buy, Watch & you'll THOROUGHLY ENJOY this movie!!

0307341542|4.0|Small objects is an entertaining read. Sometimes books cross your path and you just can't put them down and this is one of them. At times the story is grisly, disturbing, and at best haunting. I have never lived in a small town and Wind Gap where the story takes place, while being quaint, is a little nest of horrors. There are stange folks here, especially a little pack of girls that you wouldn't invite over for tea.  I enjoyed this book. It wasn't uplifting or happy, it's a sad state of affairs but it's a page turner with a good mystery. The main character is quite a mess, but you'll see why and you'll want her to do good. I would recommend this book if you like mysteries and don't have time to read a huge book - this is a neat little package that packs a punch.
B000I5Y8ZU|1.0|I had to force myself to finish it and when I was finished I was sorry I even bothered<br /><br />Lyrically much weaker than their last album and the delivery of all the songs is \\"mumble mumble mumble I'll be wearing DRAG mumble mumble\\", as if they were completely abandoning content and just going for cheap shock value. On top of that very few of the songs even make any kind of sense at all, lyrically. It just seems to be a jumble of words to fill the time between guitar solos<br /><br />It struck me as just really clumsy from start to finish, and worse than that it also struck me as very lazy.

B000002UAO|5.0|Who couldn't love this album -- I'm 51; these songs have shaped my life since I first heard them over thirty-five years ago.  I bought this for my 16 year old daughter and she hasn't stopped listening to it since Christmas Day. The Beatles are simply the best, the best, the best.  It's funny to me that the band \\"smithereens\\" (?) has done an entire cover of \\"Meet the Beatles\\" -- clearly, this music has stood the test of time.  These songs, both lyric and melody, are significant the way much of the music from my generation is significant.  Think about it:  The Beatles, the Stones, Bob Dylan, Jimi Hendrix, the Doors, Neil Young, Joni Mitchell, James Taylor, Warren Zevon, Linda Ronstadt (well, everyone out of California) the Who, Led Zeppelin, and the list goes on and on and ON.  Who even comes close these days?  Sorry if I sound smug, I'm not smug, I'm wistful for those days gone by.  Music is just not the same.  I guess every generation says this.  Anyways, for Rubber Soul, there are simply not enough stars in the sky.  And that's my review!

0425179877|4.0|\\"Failure is Not An Option\\" is not a bad book, but it is not a great one either.  Kranz provides certain insight into the role of NASA Flight Directors and the book is interesting to the extent it serves that function.  However, Kranz occasionally gives major events fairly short shrift, while writing at length on an array of banal topics which are of limited interest.  The reader is often left wanting greater details about events that shaped the space program and less information on subjects such as Kranz's management style or his trademark vests.     Moreover, Kranz's writing style is a little too compact and terse to make this book a consistently engaging read.  Kranz uses the word \\"crisp\\" in seemingly every other paragraph.  His writing style might be described in the same way.  Unfortunately, it can make sections of \\"Failure Is Not An Option\\" a bit tedious at times.    Lastly, although a small point, Kranz makes no attempt to hide his political bent.  The book is replete with praise for Kennedy and obvious (though unarticulated) disdain for Nixon.  Kranz speaks with almost boy-like ardor of Kennedy's far-sightedness and vision for the space program despite the fact that many regard Kennedy's interest in space to have arisen solely out of a political desire to beat the Soviets - not for scientific or human advancement as Kranz would have the reader believe.  At times, the political commentary proves irritating and distracting and Kranz's idolatry of Kennedy excessive and simplistic.    That said, this book is worth the read for the information it does impart and to supplement other texts on the space program, but it is not as gripping or engaging as \\"Lost Moon\\" or a host of others.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Truly a series that was under-appreciated during its original run, but has found new life and a bit of completeness on DVD.  Join the crew of the Serenity as they travel from one world to another looking for work and trying to stay one step ahead of the law for the sake of a couple of fugitive crew members.  Great writing and a unique western/sci-fi look give this short-lived series a strong value of re-watchability.  If you do decide to check out Firefly, be sure to finish off the story with the feature film \\"Serenity\\", produced to give the series some closure.  Also an excellent piece of storytelling.
B0002J4ZWS|5.0|I read the story by King first, then I saw this movie, and I must say , I love it. It does the novella justice. I won't spoil anything though. You will just have to watch the film or read the story to see. Highly recomended.
B000A1ENCU|3.0|When a 600 page book is condensed to a movie, it's exprected that some of the nuances of the book would be lost.  Unfortunately, it was changed to such a degree from the book that it almost changed the meaning the book tried to convey entirely.  Vinicius was a full convert by the end of the book, and at the end of the movie it seemed he still only converted in order to get the girl.   <br /> <br />As far as the actual production, there were some lavish scenes as are expected from the old epics, but nowhere on the range of what was found in such religious dramas as King of Kings and Ben-Hur where there were larger than life characters that perfectly complemented the larger than life scenes. <br /> <br />Quo Vadis is not without its good points, and the final climax is done fantastically, and the madness of Nero really shines through at key moments.
B00005LK94|4.0|This movie depicts the relationship of a father and his daughter and how they find a common ground despite the sad circumstances of their reunion. <br />The geese provide the common ground, of course. <br />The flying scenes and the photography of the Canadian countryside are excellent.

B000MCH5P4|5.0|A towering achievement, 'Babel,' provides a great alchemy. Last year's best films often had twisty, interlocking plots that came together from fragmented lives. 'Babel' continues this trend where few films have gone since. Not only that but the beautiful cinematography (courtesy Rodrigo Prieto) and the wonderfully placed soundtrack from Gustavo Santanella (both of 'Brokeback Mountain' fame) are just a few of the nuances in this brilliant movie. Having some of the feel of 'Syriana,' 'Babel' digs deeper. Both movies are grand and comprehensive with a theme: 'Babel' does for communication gaps what 'Syriana' did for the world oil industry and all its consuming problems--no pun intended! If movies are to give us escapist fare or illuminating transcendence, then 'Babel' succeeds in both by offering absorbing protagonists in a tight and ingenious story. Unlike 'Syriana,' a very good movie, 'Babel' doesn't exhaust us mentally. Beyond that, there's no comparison. 'Babel' is a magnificent and brilliant film that never stops fermenting resources.     Briefly, Richard and Susan Jones (Brad Pitt and Kate Blanchet) are traveling in a tour bus through the desert of Morocco. Along the nearby cliffs, two boys are testing a questionable rifle their father obtained from a Japanese hunter. They are shooting at rocks and other targets, skeptical of the claims that it can shoot up to three kilometers. The results seem to support their doubts until the younger boy shoots at a tour bus coming on a twisty, desert road below them. The result is that Susan is shot, barely discerning its impact at first. The movie then splits its focus in four pieces: The Japanese man has a deaf daughter (Koji Yakusho) who is isolated by her handicap, and typically, is frustrated by her luck with dating. Revelations are made about her father as well as the mother's mysterious death, which is given one rendering by the daughter, another by the father. Ties are made to the Japanese hunter with the gun found atthe boys' home. Meanwhile, the boys' benign action creates an International incident. The Post 9/11 world is, understandably, nervous at the pull of a trigger. Fearing repercussions from America, the Moroccan government descends on the boys' family and community with terse language and much firepower. Misunderstandings are stretched to the breaking point. Back home in the US, the Smith's caretaker, an illegal immigrant from Mexico, cares about the two Smith children under her wing, but she won't miss a key relative's wedding in her native Mexico. Her solution? Take the kids over the border with her nephew, Santiago, driving the way to the fiesta. Her drunken nephew partly is responsible for making the return a living hell. (Things don't translate well at the border patrol.) Then, of course, there's the Smiths, who must break through the Arab language barrier and forget that the Third World doesn't offer the amenities, including health care, the way it does at home. Kindness translates in any language, and whenever it's present in the movie, `Babel' is partly defeated.     To tell the details of 'Babel' is a real spoiler, so I leave you to watch it. But one development is a testament to the movie's marvelousness. When we go to the discothèque in Japan, we hear and feel the silence and alienation Chieko goes through as she can only imitate others' bumping and grinding. We can see how painfully aware she becomes in her silence as she notices her fellow deaf friend stealing her boyfriend escort. Effective to every detail, the acting, editing, writing, and directing (Guillermo Arriaga and Alejandro Ina'rrita, respectively for the latter two) make 'Babel' a masterpiece. In an age of instant text messaging, 'Babel' reminds us of our frailty in ample situations that get \\"lost in translation\\". And a world of misunderstandings can take place with language barriers. (Highly recommended)
0525457585|5.0|For those who love a book that draws you into it and keeps you in awe, I recommend this highly! <br />I first found the book years after seeing the second movie (which I mistakenly thought was the first at the time) when a friend was rummaging through her stuff. She was no longer interested and gave it to me. After reading through it the first time I was amazed at the treasure I had just received. The book was beyond anything I had ever read. I have since read it three times, cover to cover, and it remains my favorite book. <br />I own the 1983 original translation of the book with an older hardback cover and very yellowing, but loved, pages.

Brandon Routh does a spectacular job as Superman; the plot and storyline are great; all the actors and actresses really did a great job in the movie (and I don't even like Kate Bosworth that much); Overall, its a great movie- a must have.

0393327655|5.0|Religion evolved over the course of millenia as a response to man's fear of the unknown.  We shouldn't expect that a few centuries of enlightenment will sweep it away with hardly a wimper.  But we need to start somewhere and this book, along with other writings by authors such as Richard Dawkins, Carl Sagan and Karen Armstrong, will start our species on the path to creating a society based on reason rather than superstition and fear.   <br /> <br />Most of the people reading this book will already have figured out what relgion is all about.  What is needed is for those people to not be shy about sharing these thoughts with others, especially the younger generation.  Religion perpetuates itself because the people that read and appreciate books like this are overly concerned about not offending their neighbors.  I'm a prime example.  When my children were born 11 and 8 years ago, I did not want to have them baptised or Christened.  My wife didn't particularly want to either, but she didn't want to upset everyone in the family by not doing so.  I gave in because I had the attitude that it wasn't a big deal and if it made the religious people in my family happy, let it be.  That was before 9/11 and George W. Bush and before intelligent design began creeping into our vocabulary.  Now, I wish I had stuck to my guns.   <br /> <br />The people that agree with Sam Harris need to make a stand on these issues for the sake of the young, impressionable people in our society.  When I was going through Catholic confirmation classes as teenager, there was no one in my circle that had ever shared a doubt about the nonsense I was being fed.  I had my doubts even then, but went along with the program because I was too young and inexperienced to break the paradigm.  If there had been someone close to me that had presented me with an alternative to the religious worldview, it wouldn't have taken me so long to figure out the scam. <br /> <br />We need to teach our children. <br /> <br />My only criticism of this book is that the author didn't delve enough into the motivation that keeps religion strong in the world.  In my opinion it is fear, especially fear of death, or the desire to be reunited with our loved ones who have died.  Maybe this is more for the psycholgist rather than the neuro scientist.

0307346609|5.0|*** SPOILERS BELOW!!! ***<br /><br />If you love zombie lit but are getting bored with viscera and nihilism, this is a great antidote. Brooks has taken his ironically deadpan \\"Zombie Survival Guide\\" and made a whole world out of it. Pretending to be an oral history of humanity's struggle against Romero style zombie hordes, this book has a cast of dozens, most of whom speak for only a few pages before yielding to other voices. As a result, we get a truly international view of the great crisis, and the situation and responses faced by people in a variety of settings.<br /><br />Generally, this works and works well. Zombie fans will be delighted by the variety and unique sets of questions Brooks addresses - what would an armored company do to fight zombies? What happens to zombies in cold weather? What would happen in Korea and Cuba? Traditionalists will be happy at the slow mindless zombies, but they may perhaps miss all the visceral gore common to the genre, as Brooks does not get too messy. This is a fine choice, as if you want messy there are many, many zombie novels available that are based on anatomy texts, but few that manage to be this creative and panoramic.<br /><br />Some have commented on Brooks' \\"leftist\\" politics. This complaint to me is a non-issue. Some US characters do state that disillusionment over Iraq left the US civilians and military incapable and sluggish to respond to the initial zombie plague, but this is not harped upon and the US military and populace do indeed bounce back soon enough. He also does have an Israel / Palestine solution result from the plague, but we see only very little of the end result, and the rockiness of the path towards a two nation solution is portrayed clearly (complete with an Israeli civil war). Brooks also has a clear Howard Dean stand-in become US President, but unless you are a Dittohead, this will probably be only a minor irritant.<br /><br />More seriously, Brooks has been accused of an anti-military viewpoint and some Amazon reviewers accuse him of only showing \\"politically correct\\" characters in a heroic light, with white male soldiers and other authority figures being shown as inept or malevolent. This is an utter calumny, and some of the only narrators with multiple speaking roles are white male US Army soldiers. The Army's initial response was bumbled as shown, but the reasons for the tactical and strategic failures are clear and realistic and the military soon comes up with effective new strategies, which the soldiers heroically and intelligently implement.  Many of the most heroic protagonists in these pages are soldiers of different nations, and the hard choices, psychological and physical suffering, and heroism of these characters comes through clearly and fairly.<br /><br />The occasional statements about right wing militias seizing control of parts of the US and then not freely handing them back to the government are minor plot points and again are not inconceivable. Left wing citizens do not have the firepower or fortified compounds that some extreme right wing folks have, and the same guys that have bunkers and assault rifles stockpiled also are not very friendly to Big Government. Hardly an unrealistic scenario!  And along the same lines, Brooks' solution to the zombie plague is very Big Government with centralized micro-management of resources, citizens, and strategy. This strikes me as again being not overly ideological, and also logical and realistic as many real world crises of large scale and complexity (especially in the 20th Century) were solved in the same way.<br /><br />Finally to address another review complaint, the UN does take over the eventual wrap-up campaign against the zombies, but this is only after most nations have cleared their countries using their own troops under national sovereign command. The UN is only conducting campaigns in those parts of the world that have been too devastated to conduct their own campaigns or are too isolated or large for nation state operations. Again, not leftist so much as it is pragmatic and realistic.<br /><br />Sorry to go into the \\"politics\\" of zombie wars so much here, but the unifying theme of most criticism of Brooks is that he is too left-wing. As I hope I've shown, I disagree with that assessment and most importantly these politics such as they are have no main bearing on the plot of quality of the book.<br /><br />Finally, the best things about \\"World War Z\\" to me are the quality writing, the surprises of the plot and scenarios, and also the poignancy of the emotional impact. As stated above, the experiences of the combat soldiers are deep and moving, and other sections like the struggle of a pilot trapped behind \\"enemy lines\\" and best of all, the K-9 handler's tale are brilliantly done and add both pathos and innovation to portrayal of human experience during the Zombie Plague.<br /><br />The only poorly done section of the book struck me as the Japan part, with a computer nerd hero who is literally glued to his PC until zombies break down the door. He fumbles his way to escape, discovers a katana, and becomes a samurai ginsu machine, slicing and dicing his way through undead hordes. Finally he meets a wise old sensei who also happens to be blind and an impressive master of zombie fu in his own right. The wise old guy helps the ex-nerd become a warrior monk and the two found an order of swordsmen to save Nippon... Other than a guest appearance by Godzilla and / or giant robots, there is little that could be added to this section to make it seem more cartoonish and cliched, perhaps a sign that Mr. Brooks is capable of wedging his tongue a bit too firmly into his cheek, to the point where his story-telling is impaired. But this is maybe 10 pages out of 400, and the good stuff far outweighs the bad.<br /><br />All in all, I think this book is brilliant and highly recommend it. The innovation of Brooks's plotting is pared to an optimistic pragmatism that stands in stark contrast to the bleak nihilism of most zombie books. Human society and its components, humans, are ultimately shown to be resilient, intelligent, and even noble. The usual zombie books (c.f. Brian Keene's gore encrusted potboilers) usually show humans being as bad or worse than their ghoulish opponents, with human institutions like governments and armies collapsing into non-existence or brutal predation of ordinary civilians. Brooks dares to think differently and his book is a breath of fresh air.<br /><br />Brooks gets the details right, tells a fine story, and makes the Zombie War seem very real. Zombie fans need to read this, and non-genre fans with some familiarity with the zombie plague concept will also probably enjoy this. No significant flaws, many many virtues!oo isolated or large for nation state operations.

B00005YW4H|5.0|Norah Jones has one of the most beautifully melodic voices of modern music, able to just come into your homes and your hearts and warm your soul.  I feel that's the best way to describe the feeling you get when listening to her music...warming.  Pulling similarities to the greats like Billy Holiday, Norah has a sound that, while all her own, feels familiar, and not that `oh god not again' kind of familiar but that `it's nice to be home' kind of familiar. It's about time that some new talent emulates the old talent of artist now past.   <br /> <br />On beautiful tracks like the title song `Come Away With Me' as well as the opener `Don't Know Why' and the closer (and my personal favorite) `The Nearness of You', Norah gives the listener every `right' reason to listen to her again and again.  Norah is able to take classic's by Hank Williams and Hoagy Carmichael and make them all her own, adding layers to each track of class and sincerity.  Norah rightfully won multiple Grammy's for this album and was shotgun blasted into superstardom, and she's one star that I'm glad hasn't burnt-out.

0099413140|5.0|I saw this book in a dear bookstore in Scotland . I purchased the last two copies and ordered one for myself. It is dear, simpy drawn, and a whimsical treatise on underpants, or knickers, as the Scots call them .It is an Anglophiles silly book that should be on everyone's bed stand. Not just for children, it tickles any person that would pick it up!

B000H0MKGK|2.0|Boring piece of work by John Mayer. I think he's trying to \\"update\\" his style, but I could only find 2 songs on the album that could interest me at all. I feel he is looking for some new direction, but hasn't found it!
B00005JL0I|4.0|I was a little disappointed by this movie overall.  It's very similar to Austin Powers - just done 30 years earlier - and the movie goes on about 20 minutes longer than it needed to.  I would have rated it 3 stars, BUT it does include the original Casino Royale TV special which was really interesting to watch.  If you're a Bond fan, you'll probably find that alone worth the purchase.  Woody Allen is really only in 2 scenes, but is hilarious both times.
0307276902|2.0|If nothing else, James Frey will test the adage that there is no such thing as bad publicity. His emotionally raw \\"memoir\\" of six weeks in a drug rehab center, along with a second book My Friend Leonard (2005), both still sit atop the New York Times bestseller lists for non-fiction in both hardback and paper. Only time will tell if they stay there. After intense scrutiny, public outcry, a mea culpa on Larry King Live, and then not one but two appearances with America's pastor, Oprah, Frey admitted that not everything in his book is precisely true; some of it is false. He did not spend 87 days in jail, but perhaps three. It's not certain that he had massive dental surgery with no pain killers. Workers in the famous rehab center where he lived complained that many of the scenarios he described could not and did not happen in their facility. Oprah publicly dissed him and retracted her recommendation. Imagine! <br /> <br />           I wondered how a person who entered a treatment facility at the age of 23 so close to death after ten years of hard core substance abuse, and so full of self-destructive behaviors, could later recall minute details and write a book almost ten years later. I found Frey's book narcissistic in a manner that elicited the voyeuristic in me the reader. What God-awful thing would happen next to this maniac? As Anne Dillard once observed, it's like watching a car chase scene in a movie; even though you know exactly what will happen it is almost impossible not to watch. Nor is this good literature, but instead stream-of-consciousness blather. I am still trying to figure out this sentence: \\"Everything I know and I am and I have seen felt done past present past now then before now seen felt done hurt felt focus into a something beyond words beyond beyond beyond and it speaks now and it says\\" (p. 160). Yes, you read correctly. But I suppose we all love a survivor who beats the odds and lives to write about it, and on that count James Frey is a very fortunate person.
B000056H24|5.0|George Stevens masterpiece is, for me, the best of all the Biblical epics.  It takes dramatic license in setting the scripture and the events, but it does so in a very peaceful and profound manner.  The script is very well written, presenting scripture in a poetic, dramatic manner and the musical score is superb.  Biblical scholars disagree over the meaning of the Matthew 16:18 passage \\"on this rock I will build my church\\"  - here seemingly presented to refer to Peter himself as the rock when the true meaning and most accurate translation would appear to be that the statement of Peter - that Jesus is the Christ and the Son of the living God - is the rock or foundation on which the church is built.  The cast of this film is very large, with cameo roles from many of the major stars of the day.  Max von Sydow is an exceptional actor who captures the loving, caring spirit of Jesus.  The location, including the four corners region of the US, is a striking background for the story of the life and ministry of Jesus Christ.
0393327655|2.0|\\"My goal in writing this book,\\" writes Sam Harris in his Epilogue, \\"has been to help close the door to a certain style of irrationality. While religious faith is the one species of human ignorance that will not even admit of the possibility of correction, it is still sheltered from criticism in every corner of our culture.\\" Judging from the book's commercial success, many readers are interested in his demolition derby; the book has enjoyed a long ride atop the NY Times best seller list, it won the 2005 PEN/Martha Albrand Award for First Nonfiction, his much shorter sequel Letter to a Christian Nation now sits at #6 on the list, and its near cousin The God Delusion by the Oxford atheist Richard Dawkins ranks #8. <br /> <br />           Harris tries to make the case that society has been far too tolerant of religion, which he considers a form of mental illness and \\"the most prolific source of violence in our history.\\" For the most part he treats all religions with equal disdain, although separate chapters focus on Christianity (the Inquisition, witch-burning, the Holocaust) and Islam. <br /> <br />           If you paid attention in high school you probably encountered his two central points, that religion is (1) intellectually irrational and (2) morally barbaric. One of the most irritating features of Harris's book is his unctuous and overly earnest tone that suggests that he is the first person, either friend or foe, to grapple with these two important problems. He has also set the bar far too high to succeed. In practice, he believes that religion never submits itself to rational discourse and evidentiary claims, which is false. Worse, he argues that in principle \\"every religion preaches the truth of propositions for which no evidence is even conceivable,\\" which is ridiculous. In his last chapter, though, where he tries to establish a spirituality of consciousness, he appears to give himself a free pass, admitting that many of these important spiritual matters aregenuinely mysterious, open to scientific inquiry, and not absent of empirical data like the genuine experiences of mystics. <br /> <br />           Harris never argues for atheism, and he argues against Richard Rorty's pragmatic relativism, although he tries to rebut the harsh criticisms of atheists who think that in his last chapter he concedes far too much to \\"spirituality.\\" The book never engages any of the important discussions about atheism (cf. McGrath), about warrant for belief (Plantinga, Swineburn), about scientists who believe (Polkinghorne, Collins, Gingerich, et al.), or about specifically religious believers who share his concerns about fringe fundamentalisms that do, in fact, foment violence and peddle hocus-pocus (Kimball). At times his argument wanders far off track, as when he appeals to the My Lai massacre, the legalization of marijuana, and the conservative views of Justice Scalia. The book is littered with sweeping generalizations, gross exaggerations, appeals to extremist examples, and specious reasoning (as when he tries to construe the atheism of Stalin and Mao as a \\"political religion\\"). <br /> <br />           But I was glad to read Harris. I appreciated the reminders of how a person outside of any faith community views the fringe and violent elements of religion (cf. the movie Jesus Camp). Many of his complaints are spot on--we should object to uncritical support for Israel, extremists like judge Roy Moore, and the divisive diatribes of Jerry Falwell and Tim LaHaye. There are some things that civil societies should not tolerate. But when he hopes for the complete obsolescence of religion, I kept thinking about my students at Moscow State University and what they told me about the social consequences of the Soviet years that did just that.
B0001HAISG|5.0|Well done even if it didn't stay all that close to the original play. <br />Interesting having the same actor play the treacherous villain and the loving father. First I've seen with real live kids playing the kids rather than adult women or animation. Hats off to Jeremy Sumpter  in the role of Pan. To act dangling from harnesses and wires and engage in convincing sword play was quite and achievement. <br />Nice to be reminded that there is a crocodile with a clock inside it ticking off  the time until we are swallowed up :-)
0670033375|5.0|Crawling through the tunnels of the pyramids at Giza, sitting in a coliseum in Turkey built 2,000 years ago, or visiting churches hewn out of rock 800 years ago in the remote desert of Ethiopia, I have wondered: where in the world did the people of these advanced civilizations go? How did they vanish?! In his Pulitzer Prize-winning book Guns, Germs and Steel (1999) Diamond focused on how the west came to dominate the rest of the globe economically, politically, militarily and even culturally; in the present tome he looks at how societies fail. At first he thought his book would focus exclusively upon environmental factors in social collapse (he delineates twelve environmental factors like deforestation, water management, over hunting, introduction of non-native species, etc.), but when he discovered this was too simplistic he added four other contributing factors: climate change, hostile neighbors, declining support from friendly neighbors (eg, trade partners), and human responses to their social problems. He repeatedly takes to task greedy, myopic, power-mongering political rulers. <br /> <br />           Diamond applies this fivefold grid to a series of roughly twenty geographic case studies -- large and small, ancient and modern, peripheral and advanced, successes and failures. He claims to write from a middle-of-the-road position (p. 17), and he rejects the doom-and-gloom moniker. He insists he is no fear-monger. But a clear subtext to this book is how our modern world might parallel aspects of the catastrophic social collapses he identifies. One irritating habit he has is to conclude chapters with a moralistic, pessimistic insinuation: \\"If 'x' happened then and there, what might we expect here-and-now?\\" In the final three chapters he turns to practical lessons we might draw from his case studies. He hazards why societies make disastrous decisions. A chapter on big business and the environment concludes that since businesses have a fiduciary obligation to shareholders to maximize profits, it is up to the public, not the businesses, to hold them accountable (p. 484). He rightly notes that this boils down to a conflict of cultural values. In the end, he describes himself as guardedly optimistic about our modern world's prospects (pp. 499, 521). <br /> <br />           The biggest problem with Diamond's method is that, because of the nature of his study, he is necessarily long on possible theories for social collapse and short on hard data. In some instances we have a modicum of direct but fragmentary written evidence left to us by past societies, but for the most part tentative conclusions must be drawn from indirect and incomplete archaeological evidence. So, throughout his book he admits that some of his theories are much disputed, highly controversial, matters of vigorous disagreement, lacking firm proof, and, ultimately, matters of inference, conjecture, guesswork, and extrapolation. As in so much science, especially social science, description (\\"these societies collapsed\\") is far easier than explanation (\\"but why?\\"). In addition, the nomenclature of what, technically, constitutes a \\"success\\" or \\"collapse\\" is debatable. <br /> <br />           Not all societies collapse. I especially appreciated Diamond's inclusion of unlikely candidates that have succeeded. Little Tonga (288 square miles) has percolated along for 3,200 years (p. 277). People in New Guinea have led self-sustaining lives for 46,000 years (p. 280). Iceland has one of the highest per capita incomes in the world today. Still, it is frightening to admit that the world today is on a decidedly non-sustainable course. Most of the majority world that aspires to live like the minority, first world cannot and never will live like us. If China alone, to take just one example, succeeded in matching first-world consumption rates, it would double the impact on the world's resources and environment (p. 373). So, one can quibble with the grand explanations about social collapse; but that societies have collapsed, partly as a result of the choices they made, is a sobering reminder that planet earth today is a fragile, finite resource dependent upon human values and decisions.
B0007CNXUK|3.0|Depp his usual quirky self.  Hats of to the kid actors however as they where very believable.  Scenes could have fit together better.
B000FDFVZ6|4.0|Read this book a few years ago and recently reread it. An original, unformulaic story with an interesting premise and well developed characters. It can be difficult to convey all the emotions encountered in this story without being cliche, but Sebold pulls it off, especially in her realistic portrayal of the impact of Susie's murder on, and the gradual unravelling of her family, in the aftermath. The \\"happy\\" ending may not be realistic enough for some, but, hey, this is fiction. Overall, a book I would recommend to most anyone. It is timeless and has a permanent place on my bookshelf.
B000GFLEB8|3.0|Traffic is difficult for me to review since I really enjoyed the film but before you purchase be aware that the intent of the Director is to deliver a grainy, washed-out picture throughout the film.   In the places where Traffic is intended to deliver an oustanding picture without washed-out images it certainly does. <br /> <br />Images of the early bust, courtroom and 'life at home' are rich and detailed - via projector in 1080i. <br /> <br />If you appreciate the story and have a nice system, Traffic in HD is a good investment; it is NOT the movie to show-off your new High Definition home Theater system; for that I would recommend The Searchers, Seabiscuit, King Kong or Casino in HD-DVD.
B000JJS8TM|3.0|I can appreciate that it's George Martin's son who explored this, I can appreciate that he's of the generation of quick edit music videos & protools.  I can even appreciate that quite probably John would completely immerse himself in this himself, if he were alive.  However, so much of the Beatles' experience, for those of us who were alive when they were sons of the pharoahs who ruled the planets, was hearing the songs as they came out and associating that moment with your own personal life and the world around you at that time.  Remembering the first time you heard the opening chords to \\"Day In The Life\\" and how it affected you.  That song was more than sufficiently strong to stand on its' own and needs no chopping up to make it more interesting.  Or, the first time you heard \\"Hey Jude\\" and realized, as the extended ending just kept on going, how that was blowing your mind.  Laying the chords of Nowhere Man over that already amazing finale would do little to improve the significance and strength of that unique song.  I like experimentation, and loved things psychadelic, and enjoy mixing and matching songs and riffs.  But why, when this music is already more significant than computers, dvds, circus shows or maybe even history itself.
B000HEVZ8K|5.0|The Searchers has been a favorite film of mine since I was a young boy.   I was stunned by the amazing images as part of the High Definition DVD version of the film. <br /> <br />The scenes early in the film where Ethan is returning to the farm show a level of detail of the background that is difficult to describe.   Monument Valley was a favorite location for John Ford, yet never having seen a John Ford film in the Theater I never had an appreciation for the scenery.  <br /> <br />The color brilliance was exceptional in 1080i on my projector (BenQ 8720) displayed on the 78x139 DaLite screen.  I am certain that with HDMI and 1080p the image would be even a little crisper.    <br /> <br />I hope that you will make The Searchers one of your first HD selections, you will see John Ford, John Wayne, Natalie Wood, Ward Bond and Jeffrey Hunter in  a whole new light.
020530902X|4.0|Two words: Be concise.  That is the main goal of this book and I think it gives great examples of how to do so.  It also has a great chapter on commonly misused words/phrases which rings so true and exemplifies the proliferation of American stupidity.<br /><br />A note to gmat test takers: This is not a good book for sentence correction review.  It is more so for writers, not editors.
B000AGTPUA|5.0|This is an awesome movie!  Anyone who has children should most certainly purchase this movie.  Make it a tradition every Christmas to watch this.
B000002UB3|5.0|This album continues to sound fresh and vibrant even though it was recorded over 35 years ago.  the beatles may have been splintering at the time this record was recorded, but you can't tell it from the performances here.  The harmonies are some of the most inventive of their careers and there is a real band dynamic in these tracks.  geoff emerick's engineering gives the beatles the most crisp vibrant sound of any record in their catalog.  The songwriting is also top notch.  something and come together were the big hits, but george, paul and john all have stellar songs in this collection.  the only complaint i have with this album is that it has to come to an end.  highest recommendation!
B00006WKSZ|5.0|Do youself a favor and get into some 70's era Scorpions.It's heavy, it's spacey, it's groovy, it's German, and it's obscure as hell. Really cool stuff. The guitar playing is absolutely mindblowing.
0688156819|5.0|This is one of the best collections of poetry that I have read in a long  <br />while.  It captures Burton's dark and witty humor perfectly.  Two of the poems had me nearly crying.  A must for adults and older children, it may be too intense for the younger crowd.  This book is also hard to find, which makes buying it on Amazon a real time saver.  I found out about this book from a local toy show where the dealer wanted $40 for his first edition.  I wasn't looking for a collectible but just a good book to read, which is why the Amazon price was perfect.
B000001FK3|5.0|Best Cale in my opinion, must-have for anyone interested in blues beyond the founding fathers (L. Hopkins, R. Johnson, M. Waters, H. Wolf). I first heard songs from this record as a grad student in Berkeley, recently arrived from Brazil in 1983, on KFOG, the rock SF station. They used to play Bringing it Back and it took me a few auditions to get the name of the artist. When I did I went to the Tower store on Durant and bought it. Then I realized he was the composer of After Midnight (known through Clapton's version), and Cale has been a favourite since. His last, a partnership with Clapton (Road to Escondido) is also very good, in fact, Clapton is better there than in most of his solo albums, and his singing somehow lost the usual high-key stridency, certainly influenced by the zen-like ways of Cale. Naturally, with its fairy-tale like cover, would be among my DIDs. By the way, one also guesses, through this record, a strong influence on M. Knopfler , both as guitar man and composer. Highly recommended.
B000BYRCH4|5.0|I loved this movie. I'd recommend it to anyone. Some of the under water scences are quite spectacular and Paul Walkers not bad either.
B000I5X81A|5.0|Cale and Clapton are masters of a tradition: blues. In particular of the blues which evolved in the 60's (from its original roots in Chicago and the South, then esentially a black community phenomenon). Cale is in top form, reminding me of his classic Naturally, one of the best albums ever, period. Clapton seems to have been inspired by the zen style of Cale and also contributes with top-notch performance. The songs are memorable, from beginning to end, my favourites being Heads in Georgia, Hard to Thrill and Three Little Girls, this last a great Clapton contribution.  <br /> <br />Mostly it is a Cale record, with its laid-back mood and instrumentation. But Clapton is present everywhere, without high-pitched guitar solos, as could be feared. Slowhand probably sensed this was a momentous event, and the result is a true gift to music lovers everywhere. Highly recommended, I have been listening to Road to Escondido over and over, which, after 40 years buying records (my first was the recently released Beatles' Revolver when I was 10), says something about it. <br />
B000I2J5UG|5.0|wow. this album rocks. *literally* ^_^  <br /> Some concerns with Three Cheers were that it left some people feeling like all the songs sounded the same. Personally I didn't mind, since that was the sound I liked-no LOVED at the time.  <br />   Now with Black Parade, there can be no whiners, as the album has soooo many different sound and influences. (maybe a little pop/country mixed with Queen?) I &lt;3 it anyway.  <br /> <br />Loved the box. Loved the pics. 3/5 on the \\"journal\\" inside. (C'mon guys, you can't outdo yourselves everytime!)  <br />
074322454X|1.0|Watch the mini series, skip the book. <br /> <br />If you are a fan of history, and I'm certain you are if you're reading this review, skip this book.  Read Rick Atkinson, or Dick Winters' account, anything, just skip this book. <br /> <br />The writing was high school quality, a poor job by the editors (apparently the atomic bomb was \\"dripped\\" on Hiroshima), and the story is short on the details that make reading historical accounts interesting. <br /> <br />Enjoy the mini series, but if you're interested in this topic, find another book.
B00000G3AZ|5.0|For any time period buffs, this is one you should love.  The scenes are wonderful, the costumes are realistic and the actors at their best.  Without giving the story away, this is not just a chic flic but a film that will be enjoyed by all.  A real winner to watch again and again.
1594481717|5.0|Several books and news items written lately remind us that routine work is going away in the Western World. Writers universally state that we must move to higher knowledge work to compete in global markers to retain or increase our standard of living. Unfortunately, until now, there have been few specifics on how to move forward. <br /> <br />Pink suggests that we apply actions that utilize the right side of our brain more: <br /> <br />1) Becoming more emotionally engaged in what we do <br />2) Fashioning compelling stories <br />3) Combining disparate pieces into a captive whole <br />4) Understanding what makes other tick <br />5) Having fun <br />6) Pursuing significant desires and purpose <br /> <br />He also provides a variety of exercises that the reader can use to transform these concepts into practical actions. <br /> <br />The book is a breath of fresh air and provides a path to an exciting future for all of us.
1577314808|2.0|I found a lot of Mr. Tolles ideas a bit eccentric and a bit off the wall.  While I think he has a handle on spirituality, I'm not entirely sure he has a firm grip on that handle.  The one thing that was glaring (by omission,) was a feeling of joy!  The ideas were written in a style almost devoid of personality and joy, leaving me kind of empty.  That's not to say I didn't understand or appreciate the concepts, nor was the book poorly written - it just seemed formulaic and not particularly graceful.
B00005YW4H|1.0|Once more, I find it amazing how you put a cute girl behind the microphone, let her breathe in a supposed sexy and sultry voice some superficial words and how massive success comes.  <br />Even worse, the music is not pop music, but muzak, and they absurdly call this jazz !

Most average people wouldn't go out of their way to buy a house for others to live in(aka..rental house). I now own 5 rental properties thanks to Robert Kiyosaki and kudos to John Burley.

B000J10ERO|5.0|I haven't seen the original Superman movies, but I thought this DVD was awesome. It was a gift to a friend who loves Superman, and watching it with them was a blast. A great movie, though it helps to know a bit about the first two Superman films (or at least the timelines in the comics).
B000K7VHQ4|2.0|decent plot, predictable twist ending, dragged on.  love edward norton but this movie was very average and could have been better with a little more complicated plot and less emphasis put on special effects tricks.
B000MCH5P4|4.0|It appears quite a few reviewers think that \\"Babel\\" is about the loss of communication, communication problems, or communication gaps.  This may be true to a certain degree, but I don't think that's what \\"Babel\\" is essentially about.  The one thing these characters all have in common is that they're desperate to get something.  For example, the Brad Pitt character is desperate to get his wife to a hospital.  The Japanese teenager is desperate to get laid by a boy or attention from her father.  The Mexican housekeeper is desperate to get to her relative's wedding.  The Moroccan boy is desperate not to get blamed for shooting the American tourist so he frantically looks for a good place to hide the rifle.  Through their desperation they are incapable of having any kind of dialogue with anyone.  All they care about is to be heard.  They don't care about what the other person has to say.  The Brad Pitt character doesn't listen to the other bus riders about needing to get back to the hotel for their medicine.  The Japanese teenager doesn't listen to her father the first time about going to the dentist office.  The Mexican housekeeper doesn't listen to her nephew about not taking the two kids to the wedding. This is where the communication problems in the film come into play.  But this is all just surface stuff.    All of these characters need to learn to stop thinking about themselves and to start thinking about other people.  When they can do this then they have achieved FORGIVENESS, which is something they are looking for.  For example, the Brad Pitt character seeks forgiveness from his wife for not being a very good husband--both in the U.S. and Morocco.  The Japanese teenager seeks forgiveness from her father for the death of her mother.  Because she was the one who discovered the dead body, she felt responsible for it.  The Mexican housekeeper seeks forgiveness from the Brad Pitt character for putting his children in harm's way.  The Moroccan boy seeks forgiveness from the American tourist for injuring her.      We as human beings will always have communication problems with other people that upset us.  We need to get past the hurt that other people inflict upon us and forgive them.  This is exactly what Jesus preached.  As a matter of fact, his last words were: \\"Forgive them Father for they do not know what they are doing.\\"  As far as I am concerned, \\"Babel\\" was about forgiveness.  \\"Babel\\" contains more Christian themes than you may think.
B0002ZYE1Y|5.0|This album, Once, is the culmination of a decade of excellence on the part of Nightwish. The unfortunate split of lead vocalist, Tarja, from the rest of the band hails the end of this particular era for Nightwish, (Pun intended) but this final effort is an absolute masterpiece. For me this is the penultimate Metal album. I have never heard anything else so wonderfully and bombastically satisfying. (Almost brought me to tears the first time I heard it.) The scope and breadth of this record is just epic. Over the top? Of course. Its Opera Metal after all. I can not recommend these Finnish masters highly enough!
B000I5X81A|5.0|The music is haunting, varied, and the type you want to play over and over.  Highly recommended.
B000K7VHQ4|5.0|The Power of Love & the Mystery of Illusion Are Just Two Things That Make This a Great Film! I'd say the screenplay & storyline are fairly original to this movie as well. So many movies out there today are remakes of older films or so similar to other films that have been made, which makes \\"The Illusionist\\" refreshing. It is also refreshing to watch a movie that isn't based on using excessive violence, foul language, sex/nudity, or the same old silly slapstick that has become the norm for so many movies today.<br /><br />The acting, costuming, and cinematography are also great in this movie too. \\"The Illusionist\\" is a well-rounded, must see movie!
0743298020|5.0|I am not a \\"reader\\".  Through the encouragement of my boyfriend to start reading as a hobby I ended up choosing The Thirteenth Tale as my first book.  WOW...what a wonderful book.  I found myself really involve with the lives of Margaret and Vida Winters.  Every night I would start out to read just a chapter or two before bed but the next thing I knew I would end up falling asleep still holding to my book...I really wanted to finish it; to learn the secret that Ms. Winter's had held to her whole life and to see how Vida's life was affecting Margaret's struggle with longing to know her twin sister.  I am an identical twin and I could relate so deeply to the emotions that are involved in this book.  OK, from someone who has never read that much in her life...this is a terrific book to begin a new hobby of reading!
B000AY74OG|5.0|Fun for the whole family. Great animation and great story.
B000002UAX|4.0|Before I get into the review proper for this album, I'll just get some opinions of mine out of the way. Firstly, I think The Beatles are the greatest band of all time. Second of all, I don't think that they've ever really made a great album [I should point out though, that I know their music mostly from compilations and Sgt Pepper and Magical Mystery Tour]. Sgt Pepper is vastly over-rated in my view-it has one great track [A day in the life], a really good track [title track] and a nice song in \\"She's leaving home\\". Take away \\"A day in the life\\" and the album is not much chop. As for it being a \\"concept\\" album, I think one of the Beatles debunked that myth, and in my view, you could whack the title track onto ANY album by ANY band and still call it a \\"concept\\" album! Magical Mystery Tour is MY idea of a GREAT Beatles album. I know that Revolver and Rubber Soul get nominated by the poo-bahs as the best Beatles albums, but looking at the track listings they don't look enticing enough for me to buy. I am considering buying an early album which had \\"It won't be long\\" on it-it was used in a docu about their trip to Australia and it struck me as an instant classic, in early Beatles style.       Ok, now to the White album. Another album which gets \\"Best Beatles album\\" kudos. To me, I'm not convinced that they had enough good material to fit into one album, let alone two. It doesn't have what I consider to be a song which is right up their with The Beatles' best, like \\"A day in the life\\" or \\"I am the walrus\\", though it does have some good/very good songs. Some of these songs are:    \\"Birthday\\"-one of the best Beatles fun/rocker songs. A strange and unwelcome omission from most compilations.    \\"Back in the USSR\\"-lyrically and vocally inspired by The Beach Boys. In fact one of the Beach Boys apparently suggested what kind of lyrics to put in the song, which The Beatles duly did.       \\"While my guitar gently weeps\\"-nice George Harrison song featuring nice guitar work and acool bass riff.    \\"Dear Prudence\\"-a nice song inspired by US actress' Mia Farrow's sister Prudence-when they were together during their Indian hippy sojourn, I think.     \\"Why don't we do it on the road\\"-extremely suggestive rocker from The Beatles, unusually, for their clean-cut image.    \\"Mother nature's son\\" and \\"Cry baby cry\\"-two nice, gentle songs.    I can't quite work out why \\"Revolution 1\\" is different to the much, much heavier version you get on best of compilations. The version on the album is a bit bluesy. Would appreciate any comments on what the story there is.       Without perhaps wanting to give undue credit to The Beatles for influencing future artists, it seems to me at least that this album is very influential on future acts [unless The Beatles themselves were taking cues from other acts]. E.g. Dire Straits' song \\"Money for nothing\\" takes a lyrical cue from \\"Revolution 1\\" re \\"blister on my finger\\"; perhaps Led Zeppelin's \\"Whole lotta love\\" took its sexual grunting cues from the same song, from memory [or Helter Skelter, perhaps?]. Aeroesmith's classic \\"Dude looks like a lady\\" features the kind of stereo widgy-widgy effects from this album [in its intro] or from someone else who did.        I have to give this album an extra half star for \\"Revolution 9\\" the MOST experimental Beatles song I have ever heard. Usually the Beatles bookend their wacky effects, but this song is nothing but experimental. It features voices talking and ambient noises, I think, along with a constantly repeated phrase \\"revolution number 9\\". To me, this song is quite interesting, in an arty farty way. If they had made an entire album of 'songs' like this, I think I would have bought it and rated it higher than \\"White\\"...so long as the 'songs' were sufficiently differentiated. Not sure I should credit the Beatles with inventing this form of soundscape, but they were extremely brave to include this 8 minute track on the album.       One of the 'problems' with The Beatles was that they often had a boy-like sense of fun in their music and lyrics. The song \\"Ob-la-di ob-la-da\\" is perhaps one such song which works better than most. The Beatles at their worst sound like a novelty chidrens' act, a la The Wiggles. The instrumental to this song was actually used as the theme for an Australian children's tv programme [Fat Cat and Friends].        An example of The Beatles at their wittiest best comes in the slow and fatigued \\"I'm so tired\\" which features the arcane lyric, following a lyric about being a smoker \\"curse Sir Walter Raleigh he was such a stupid git\\"! Just Google that name to get this arcane reference!       Other examples of The Beatles being experimental come in the songs \\"Blackbird\\" and \\"Piggies\\" which feature animal noises. The former song is a gentle accoustic guitar piece.       One particularly interesting song is \\"Glass onion\\" which is The Beatles being self-conscious...the song references other Beatles' songs and provides 'clues' or 'explains' their meaning...as it sort of does for \\"I am the walrus\\", or at least partially makes that song's 'meaning' clearer.       The music in the album is quite mixed. The second cd is more rock, though both discs have mellow songs. In two songs John and Paul, respectively, try on American accents \\"Happiness is a warm a gun\\" [good, fun song taking the mickey out of Americans] and \\"Rocky Raccoon\\" [I think]. The latter song has a nice honky-tonk piano bit in it. \\"Piggies\\" has what could be a harpsichord featured, and it sound a bit mediaevel, to my ears at least. In constrast to the 8 minute weirdness of \\"Revolution 9\\" there is a short and simple song called \\"Wild honey pie\\" I think, which is, from memory, only around a minute long.       Lastly, some of the songs on this album are narrative songs...songs that tell a story...e.g.\\"Rocky Raccoon\\" and \\"Continuing story of Bungalow Bill\\". Like I say, many songs are quite mellow, like the lovely and dreamy \\"Julia\\", which are both on accoustic guitar.Yes, The Beatles are the greatest band of all time, for the way that they redefined what pop could be. They just didn't make great albums, I don't think. Maybe one day I will get around to reviewing \\"Magical Mystery Tour\\", which is my pick as a GREAT Beatles' album. For some reason, The White Album's songs seem more 'stereo' than what I've heard previously in compilations. Good sound quality in fact.
B0009A1AS2|5.0|I love this album. At first I wasn't so sure. At the time I had been heavy into Scenes From A Memory and Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence. After a few more listens and a slight mood change in what I wanted to listen to I fell in love with the music here. It's DT continuing to evolve in their musical adventures and yet a compilation and enhancement of their previous work. You'll find elements of all of their albums here. From the light stuff found in Images and Words to the hard and fast stuff in Awake and Train of Thought. James LaBrie is in top form on this album. In past efforts DT seemed more like an instrumental band that happened to have a lead singer to sing occasionally. However, this album really makes all members shine. It's much more balanced than any other album.  You also hear many tributes to their influences like Yes, Pink Floyd, Queensryche, and Rush. The title track has many parts that are directly influenced by Gates of Delirium and Shine On You Crazy Diamond and yet it is DT's own creation and signature sound that makes it unique.  This album is a must buy right up there with Images and Words. It doesn't beat Scenes From A Memory but is easily in their top 3 best albums.  Enjoy this album for a nice change of pace from the constant shredding of Train of Thought.
B000FTWB7G|5.0|The Open Door is grittier than Fallen. I for one enjoyed the piano ballads of Fallen, but where this album is lacking there it makes up for it in powerful guitar anthems. Totally new but still the same great quality work.

B00005JKN9|5.0|This film follows Amsterdam (Lonardo Dicapro) a young Irishman who is just emerging from 16 years in a Reformatory for juvenile delinquents.  He is the son of the late leader of the Dead Rabbits--a gang of Irish immigrants which had in the past challenged the 'Nativist' gang for rule of the streets.  Bill the Butcher (Daniel Day Lewis) is the leader of the Nativists and the killer of Amsterdam's father.  Given his freedom from the reformatory, Amsterdam quickly works his way into the Nativist's organization, and begins to plot his revenge...    To begin, I really enjoyed this film.  I particularly liked Daniel Day Lewis' performance as Bill \\"the Butcher\\" Cutting, the leader of the Nativist gang.  He is fearsome, brutal and funny.    Now, I think \\"Gangs\\" was a very good film.  But what really bothers me is that it could have been great.  For instance, aside from Bill \\"the Butcher\\", most of the other characters are a little bit superficial.  Dicaprio's performance as Amsterdam is about average; I never quite believe his motivation all the way.  Cameron Diaz's acting was below average....But again, don't get me wrong--this film is epic [in a good way] and very good overrall.  It's Scorsese's best since \\"Goodfellas\\" in my opinion.
1400049628|5.0|Every so often a book or movie is released that rises above the rest, the zombie survival guide is just one of those books. In todays modernized and sheltered society we need books like this to prepare us for the inevitable. The zombie survival guide covers everything from what weapons to use and what to pack during an invasion of the living dead, to terrain types and how to defend and defeat the living dead. I would reccomend this to anyone who has even the smallest interest in horror movies or the undead.
B000A0GYD2|5.0|This TV HBO series was the best I ever have seeing and the realistic  pictures are fantastic ... <br />Congratulation Tom Hanks and all staff include all the \\" extras \\" that make this dream come true it... <br />
0743454537|4.0|I recommend this book to middle school students and older readers. THe story deals realistically with emotional isues; readers should be mature enough to understand these concepts.  I liked the way the author moved the narration among six diferent characters, rather than telling the entire story from one point of view. I enjoyed reading the book because the story was touching and moving.
0743289412|4.0|I've been reading Stephen King books for over 20 years and I've been relatively disappointed by his more recent works (other than his finally finished \\"Dark Tower\\" series). With \\"Lisey's Story\\", I've fallen back in love with King's incredible story-telling.  This is a can't-put-down book; you'll race to the end and then be sorry when you get there because you want the story to keep going.  The characters are rich and<br /><br />well-developed and mostly likeable (which is something that's been lacking in some of King's other recent novels).  If you're a long time fan or just like a good story, read this one.

0440237688|5.0|The Giver: Utopia  <br /> <br />      <br /> <br />                The faultless society, is there such thing? Lois Lowery, the author of The Giver wrote a work of fiction with the scheme of Utopia wrapped around it. In The Giver, young male named Jonas is living life the same way as everyone else is. Eat, work, learn, eat sleep; no feelings, no worries, no stress. It is noticed to be \\"perfect\\". The opinions that could be spoken about the layers upon layers in this novel are endless. The \\"hue-less shades\\" and everything that they do on a day-to-day basis is somewhat of a work of art. But should it in reality be called perfect? <br />     Sameness, equivalence, and egalitarianism, some of the topics articulated throughout the novel are a disaster waiting to happen. The understanding came to Jonas that the way they live really isn't fair. It isn't fair that the people cannot sense, distinguish color, and, just be happy. Everyone is to be the same, do the same thing, and look the same. All age groups have the same hair ribbon; all males wear the same tunic. Everyone is to use the same proper manners. Break the rules three times and you are considered nothing so they release you; they kill you. But if you are normal, but look the same as someone else, they want to kill you as well. Perfect, huh? But, I guess they are right, how awkward would that be, right? How hard would life be to have that superfluous person that looks the same as some other guy? However, they practice sameness.  So, is sameness really what everyone wants, or will it just drive people mad? <br />     The slightly confusing yet powerful novel was greatly thought out. Every flip of the page sends excitement up my spine with a new juicy detail. Though the people in the community may be boring, this book is constantly active. The topic of Utopia is just one of the many in the book. It is a must read for anyone who would like a good interesting novel to past time by.
B000HEWEE4|4.0|Purchased this as a gift for my best friend.  She was absolutely thrilled and has watched the movie 4 times in 2 weeks.  She said,\\"it is this year's Notebook\\" for romance junkies.  Very happy to have found such a fabulous gift.
B000002H1T|5.0|The Cars was a interesting band.  They got played on classic rock stations but they was a new wave band even the police had a hard time getting played on stations at the time.  That being said when this album came out in 1984 it sounded different, clean yet a little rough, new wave yet a little hard around the edge which is why I loved this album. This is one of very few album that is flawless.  Years later (around 1998) Ric said this was a experimental album and it was the first album ever that was recorded through computer with synth and drum machine which make it even more better album because it doesn't sound cold like other new wave bands at the time. I highly recommand this album to anyone that want a classic new wave album.
B000003TA4|3.0|Over the past couple of years I've been getting into grunge music (I was only in grade school when this stuff originally came out) and I can see why it was popular and critically acclaimed back then. I was introduced to the genre by Soundgarden. The other big grunge bands never held my interest: Eddy Vedder likes to mumble, Alice In Chains is too heavy for me, and Nirvana? Well I'd never really given a Nirvana a complete listen because I've always thought Cobain was a whiny sininger.    I finally gave this \\"great and groundbreaking\\" album a listen and wasn't that impressed. The first three songs are great, but if you take those away (and you should since you can hear 'em just by turning on  your rdio), what's left?     Not much really. Just a bunch of wreckless screaming from Cobain in Territorial Pissings, Stay Away, and Drain You.    I liked On A Plain and Something in The Way, which is dark and weird, but this album is way overrated. Besides the three tracks everyone knows, there isn't much to sink your teeth into.
B0000085N4|5.0|This is the album that divided the fans back in the day.  My goth friends thought they had sold out with this album and the people who love metal thought it was too weird.  I on the other hand, like all kinds of music and thought this was the best hard rock album of the late 80's.  It was loud and bombastic, it put all of the other bad metal bands like poison, skid row and other to shame.  This album is why Metallica picked Bob Rock to produced their black album.
B000KX0HVY|4.0|What were they thinking when they put this collection together? Yes, it has almost - ALMOST - all of Elvis's greatest hits but where is \\"One Night\\"? And why, why, why would they dare to include Elvis's horrendous live version of \\"Polk Salad Annie\\" and omit a classic like \\"One Night\\"? It is for that glaring omission and that glaringly bad inclusion that I give this collection a rating of 4 rather than 5. Hey, I love Elvis Presley's music as much as anyone but he had no business recording \\"Polk Salad Annie.\\" There's only one version of that song that should ever be heard and that's the original by the song's writer, Tony Joe White.
0739326740|5.0|I just raed this book this week. A little late, I know, but I wanted to read it before I saw the movie. And I just got done watching the movie tonight as well. And, like most movies, the book was better than the film--but the film is brilliant as well. I was a little skeptical about this book after reading Digital Fortress a while ago. I must say, however, that Dan Brown has come a long way and transfomed himself into being a truly great writer. This week I'll be reading Angels and Deamons, and I am really looking forward to it. So regardless of whether or not you've seen this movie, I highly recommend reading this book. Dan Brown will not disappoint.
B000H0MKOC|4.0|This movie is really about spin. The tobacco industry is used to showcase how PR can make anything, even a lethal product, acceptable to the public. The insane thing is that you find yourself cheering for the spinmeister himself! A great cast including Katie Holmes in a sexy, hilarious role that makes you wonder why she has settled for being Mrs. Tom Cruise. Robert Duvall is terrific as the tobacco exec who falls victim to his own product. Highly recommended!
B000AGTPUU|5.0|I purchased the movie as a gift and was very pleased with the delivery as well as the actual movie itself when it arrived. It is a wonderful movie and i would recomend it to anyone.
B000ICL3KG|4.0|People who are not pro-environmentalists might think that this is another one of those scare tactics cooked up by environmentalists and they are wrong. If that's their theory, just look at the temperatures of the current winter season in North America. 2006 has also been recorded to be the hottest year ever, thus setting the stage for even more global warming in the future. There are people who argue that our unseasonably warm winter is due to normal fluctuations or the phenomenon known as El Nino. Sure, the temperatures do fluctuate, but the there has always been an upward trend. <br /> <br />I like this documentary because in it, Al Gore presents the facts without politicizing the environmental issue. Countless scientific studies and articles have warned the public about the potential harms of global warming but none have had the widespread impact or audience that this movie does. It is pretty cool to know that there are influential people who actually care about the environment enough to actually go out there and use their influence (or celebrity or power, whichever you like) to educate the public about it. I like that the director intersperses Al Gore's slide show presentation with behind-the-scenes snippets of Al Gore's life too.  <br /> <br />However, what I don't like about this documentary is the lack of information on how the individual can help save the environment. Towards the end of the movie, there are simple suggestions on how to save energy and recycle that are shown in really, really small types. I mean, really, who stays around after the movie to look at the credits? It would've been better to incorporate them into the documentary. <br /> <br />I recently read a commentary about Al Gore and this documentary. The article basically bashed Al Gore as being duplicitous and hypocritical because while he's going around the world preaching about the imminent environmental meltdown, he's not doing anything to help either. The writer mentioned that Al Gore has two oversized mansions powered with nonrenewable energy that he doesn't need (considering that his kids are grown up and not living with him). He also cited his \\"anti-environmentalist\\" voting record when he was the VP. <br /> <br />Although I'm disappointed by the actions (or lack thereof) of the messenger, it is still worthwhile to listen to the message of pro-environmentalism. Unlike other influential people who either do nothing or \\"actively ignore\\" corporations polluting the environment, at least Al Gore is trying to spread the news to people who might not know there is a real problem. Overall, I recommend this documentary for those who are curious or who want clarification on the global warming issue. This is not an \\"easy\\" movie to watch just because it will make you think.
0060849827|5.0|My husband and I wanted a little guide for our house and cars, so we'd be better prepared in case of disaster. We were hoping for something that would help in just about any situation: plane crash, getting stuck in the car in a blizzard, a natural disaster that cut off power and access to our house, and so on. This book meets that requirement beautifully. The SAS Guide (as opposed to the regular SAS Handbook) is a pocket-sized book, so it easily fits in the glovebox, and it's surprisingly complete for such a small book. I'm also grateful that it's completely free of any weird political agenda. It's just straightup information without even the slightest hint of a paranoid subtext. I'm thrilled with the purchase, and I'll buy more copies for other people in my family.
B000I0QK74|5.0|James Taylor is superb in this CD.  I played it over and over and will listen to it long after Christmas.  He never disappoints his listeners.
B000ICL3KG|4.0|Whether you're a fan of Al Gore or not, he isn't really the issue here. He does a great job presenting the various forms of overwhelming evidence for global warming and mankind's link to it, but he doesn't do it in a political or spiteful way. He shows global temperature and atmospheric carbon patterns, and he shows that our last 20 years have been the highest by a longshot over the previous 600,000 years.<br /><br />Even more importantly, it goes to show why we should care that global warming is occurring. As you may have seen in the trailer, if global warming continues at its current rate, the earth's coastlines will be flooded displacing tens of millions of people, it will increase the strength and frequency of hurricanes and tornadoes, it will irrevocably kill off many of the worlds glaciers, it will dry up lands interior to the coastline, and it will disrupt/kill species after species from polar bears to birds. These changes could occur in as short a time as ten to fifty years from NOW.<br /><br />Lastly, he finishes with ways in which we can affect a change. It would be easy to see this film, get depressed about all the state of affairs, and throw up one's hands in despair, but the film offers us ways, big and small, to help reverse global warming's effects right now.<br /><br />I urge you to see this film, you will not regret it.

B000ICL3KG|5.0|Even though I knew what to expect while watching this movie, I was very compelled by how sincerely passionate Gore is on the subject.  The footage of Antarctica and Greenland was enlightening also.  Some say this is a political issue, but it seems that economics is the more precise term.  Those who are in control currently don't want to lose market share since they have a virtual monopoly on energy.  Our economy would prosper if we went in the direction of alternative sources of energy, it's just that the revenues would be flowing to smaller companies.
B000BNNLN4|4.0|Marina Lewycka has written an intriguing novel about an aged father, his two warring daughters, his December-May marriage, and his treatise on tractors.  Two years after the death of their mother, the daughters have to join forces to save their father from his much younger, green-card seeking wife, whom they are convinced is using him, and may be abusing him.   <br />Nadia, the younger, resents Vera's deathbed pressure on their mother to alter her will in Vera's favor, but that's only the most recent excuse for them to be at odds.  There are also family secrets to be revealed about their parents' courtship and marriage, and the years spent in a labor camp before liberation and a new life in England.  Vera was the war child; Nadia the peace child, and no one will tell her what happened there and why her father is so angry with Vera.   <br />Lewycka explores whether or not the truth is always what one needs to hear.  She has a talent for bringing out the humor amid the pathos of the declining health and life of the father, and the senseless ongoing battle between the daughters.  I found a similarity to Ann Tyler in the plot and style of writing, which is not a bad thing.

B000004756|5.0|This cd is a wonderful release by three of the top Jazz guitarists in the world. John McLaughlin, Al Dimeola, and Paco de Lucia combine their talents to create a compelling, fast paced acoustic bossa nova tinged jazz record.

B000E6GBV2|3.0|So, let's just cut to the chase.  This band sounds like My Morning Jacket.  A lot like it.  You have droning two-chord repeat guitar riffs, a spark here and there with the drums but otherwise repetitive, and a 60's metal band era lead vocalist who whines into the microphone and uses all kinds of amplifiers to make his voice sound appealing.  Now that were over that, the band isn't that bad.  I mean, it's still music, isn't it?  I'm not a big fan of My Morning Jacket, a couple songs here, a couple there.  I was rather pleased with this album.  Although it didn't exactly rock my socks off or anything, it was pleasant to listen to.  I would recommend a listen, it might be your kind of thing.

B000ICL3KG|5.0|The title says it all. When we have to make adjustments that rock our comfort zone, it is an inconvenience. If anyone has an interest in our earth and global warming this DVD exposes this truth. Al Gore is outstanding in presenting the facts and specific details. Don't deprive yourself of watching it because of any political belief; Al Gore is just another person who cares about our earth, is very humorious and has enough pull to bring this critical issue to the forefront. I'll probably still be around in 20 years and I'll be a witness to this truth. What is the expression? Oh yes, the best Hindsight is Foresight.  <br />There is another express \\"My people die for a lack of Knowledge\\". Al Gore is providing us with that Knowledge.
B00004RJ71|5.0|I just watched this movie again for the 20th time last week and it reminded me why I watched it the other 19 times... it's just that good.<br /><br />If you like watching movies about street gangs, drugs, prison, and how lives are affected from one or the combination of them, this movie's for you.

It really kicks, after the softer sounds of the last album. <br />To the \\"servant of the Lion of Judah\\" reviewer below: Please get off your bigoted evangelical soapbox and read \\"Walk on: The Spiritual Journey of U2\\" by Steve Stockman (available on Amazon). While they may have strayed from the faith-path you would like them to follow, they have by no means rejected Jesus and become pawns of Satan. Quite the opposite.

I think that those who ridicule/bash this book for what it presents probably just don't understand it. -Or they're looking for a soapbox to stand on. Reviews are after all, a just a matter of opinion. I've read a lot of negative reviews on this book that I just don't agree with. My rule of thumb on any new material that I come across is: Take what applies, what feels right to you, and leave the rest behind. -And to be open to learn from everyone. And, I've personally found that sometimes the things that I think don't apply to me, very well may at a different time in my life. I happen to think that it's pretty wonderful that these people who put this together are so determined to spread the word about \\"The Secret\\". You can't please everybody all the time.<br /><br />The book tells you what the secret is and gives you many ways, examples, ideas on how to use it. It has relevant quotes throughout from a wide variety of people,  and each chapter ends with a 'secret summaries' which captures the important points of the chapter. There is a nice 'Biographies' section in the back that gives a little blurb and picture of the people who contributed to the book.<br /><br />What I got from this book was not only what the law of attraction is, and how it works, but the confirmation that we DO have the power to change what is in front of us -our life. Just because you may be in a bad situation now, it does not mean you must stay in that situation. The message here is that we have the control. It is up to no one but us to make the change, and I think that this book is a very good tool to use to find out how to do it. The point of taking responsibility is part of the transformation, -it's not to kick yourself even further down for your part in where you are. Recognize and accept what you've done in the past, learn from it and do things differently from now on!<br /><br />The book is highly attractive and informative. There are a number of resources and contributors to this book that I was already familiar with and it was good to see that they were included or part of this piece of work. -I was glad to see quotes from the works/writings of Robert Collier, and Charles Fillmore, and one of my very favorites -NEVILLE. John Demartini's book \\"Count your Blessings\\" has a sacred spot on my bookshelf. Some really super resources were pulled together for this.<br /><br />The 'Secret Team' did a great job in putting this together to get their message out. This book can save you a lot of time in that it has combined essential tools/techniques and examples of how to use this \\"secret\\" in your own life. Even though I've read many books along the same lines (and from many of the sources that were compiled for this book) I still pick this up and read a little now and then. Mostly when I am trying to concentrate on a certain thing that I want to attract. I'll be reading in this and be reminded of something that I'd forgotten about.<br /><br />I like the book a lot. From the various reviews posted about it, it looks like one of those books that's hard to tell... You'll just have to see for yourself. Just be open minded and willing to learn.ok is highly attractive and informative.

B000002HMH|4.0|i think this album has a few good songs although i dont like the album after this reload and i think that one sucks. i think the song Bleeding me is very good as well as 2X4 which i could rate more than 4 stars. i am the one who reviewed kill em all the one i threw out of my car that night. i will not throw this album out because i like this much better. i like metallica's albums from ride the lightning til this. i suggest you need to get this along with the four remaining classic metallica albums but avoid kill em all, reload, and saint anger.
B000002ADT|5.0|This is one of the most innovative records ever made.  It was Mile's response to all the Boppers of the time.  I haven't met one person who doesn't like this record.  Bill Evans, J.C., and Miles Davis on one Record!!!!!  Blue in Green is one of the most pretty and marose song's ever written........ ummmmm if you haven't heard this; buy it now.  These pieces aren't exactly the most complex pieces ever written but that's exactly what Miles/Bill Evans were trying to do, make a pretty yet simple record.  Every single musician complements each other very well and Bill Evans and Miles Davis are by far two of the best song writers ever (Don't forget Coltrane and Adderley).  All the songs are at a very slow tempo, which is harder to play because it's hard to fill up all that space and keep the composition interesting.  All the improv is very beautiful, flawless, and heartful.....BUY THIS NOW.
B000001ZS4|5.0|Following my discovery of Jean Michel Jarre sometime in 1985-ish with his Oxygene album from 1976, I immediately rushed out and got this 1978 release.  Although it is nice to have this on CD (my record collection disappeared a long time ago), I do miss the old vinyl.  At any rate, this is yet another excellent recording of electronic music by Jean Michel Jarre that more or less follows in the footsteps of the excellent Oxygene.<br /><br />Stylistically, this music is closest to the \\"Berlin School\\" approach to electronic music, although this electronica is a bit cheerier and more accessible.  Just like Oxygene, there is a multi-movement suite which unfolds over eight sections that range in length from 2'25\\" to 7'06\\". The movements combine brooding and spacey synth work with the occasional pulsating and synthetic rhythm (there are neither drums nor percussion on Equinoxe).  Jean Michel uses a lot of the same analog equipment he used on Oxygene, along with a few instruments that were in vogue at the time including polyphonic synthesizers manufactured by Oberheim (TSV1), Yamaha (CS-60), and Korg (Korg Polyphonic Ensemble).  Other synthesizers used on Equinoxe include the ARP 2600, EMS Synthi AKS synthesizer, EMS VCS3, RMI Harmonic synthesizer, ELKA X-707, along with the Eminent 310 organ, Novatron Mellotron 400, several sequencers, a \\"rhythmicomputer\\", and a vocoder.  I especially like the tones he gets: they sound very organic and warm.<br /><br />Together, these instruments are used to create electronic soundscapes that bubble, pulse, and brood - there is even a tiny bit of French folk music (played entirely on synths of course) on the closing track.  Jean Michel has a good sense of melody and they are splashed liberally across the entire album. There is also a bit more in the way of a driving, rhythmic element that reminds me somewhat of Kraftwerk's output in the mid 1970s.  On top of it all is his trademark phasing (just like that found on Oxygene), which makes everything sound just that much more spacey and drifting.<br /><br />All in all this is yet another fine example of electronic music by Jean Michel Jarre and is very highly recommended along with Oxygene and Kraftwerk's Autobahn album from 1974.t that much more spacey and drifting.     All in all this is yet another fine example of electronic music by Jean Michel Jarre and is very highly recommended along with Oxygene and Kraftwerk's Autobahn album from 1974.

B0007GAEGC|4.0|Bought this after seeing a PBS special and was blown away by the wonderful music. Having it in my home is a true gift. It is well worth the money.
B00003JRCQ|5.0|This is a beautiful adaptation of Austen's book. It follows closely the narration and pictures well the cheerful atmosphere in the post Napoleonic England. The music (J.S.Bach and F.Chopin) emphasizes in a superb way the mood of the characters. The actors are very good, especially Amanda Root and Ciara'n Hinds, who enter perfectly in their roles. There are particularly beautiful: the dinner at the Musgroves and the walks along the see.
B0000047CW|5.0|This CD was all I expected and more.  It was soothing without being muzac, and there was plenty of latin for spice.  I was raised with the old school style of jazz and this really fit the bill!
B00062RCBW|5.0|I got this for my husband as a Christmas gift- he loves Star Trek TNG and was very pleased to get this whole set- he never bought it for himself because he just could not bring himself to spend all that money (it is on the expensive side for a dvd set). Since Christmas we've been watching Star Trek non stop- the dvd's are of good quality which was my concern- and they are organized well.  Overall it was a great buy- and to make my husband this happy is priceless!
B00005JPE0|5.0|At various times while watching this film, I had the same sensation as the first time I watched GODFATHER 2 thirty years ago.   <br /> <br />The opening is so steeped in America's the past 60 years of our history, I wondered how many in the contemporary audience would get the connections.  Apparently WW2, Skull & Bones as the Masons for WASPs, the Cold War, Castro & the Mafia, American corporate interests controling Central America, the Bay of Pigs, the Kennedy administration in general, the LeCarre tradition, etc. are lost on the generation for whom \\"ancient history\\" means reruns of the first season of AMERICAN IDOL.   <br /> <br />The scene with Joe Pesci is also a visual paean to GODFATHER 2 (birthday cake not included), and contains one of the two major punchlines worthy of Arnold, Clint, or the ending of the original STEPFORD WIVES (\\"Disney, why do you do this?\\"  \\"Because we can.\\").  Pesci's mafioso observes the cultural pleasures of the Italians, the Irish, and so on, and then asks Damon's Company man what American WASPs can call THEIR own.  The response is delivered flawlessly.  The other killer one-liner comes at the end of the movie. <br /> <br />Haplessly, as with so many contemporary films, the movie ends about a dozen times before the final fade-out.  The tempered pacing and lapping-waves music make the film a mite long.  But the pay-offs are generally worth it, and it ultimately satisfies as might a thick, well-written novel.   <br /> <br />The cast is excellent, and the boy who plays the son holds his own among a bevy of heavy hitters.  But I do wish DeNiro had taken a tip from GIANT (1956) when it came to the ageing make-up.  Matt and Angelina, especially, should have gotten a bit thicker in the waist and facially lined or hair-streaked as they aged.  More than once Matt looks younger than his adolescent son, more like a date than a parent. <br /> <br />An origami of endings and glam-glam make-up aside, this is a pleasing film for adults, with a sly dig at current American torture techniques proving much more effective than a similar scene in SYRIANA.
0743201140|4.0|Overall this book is a quick and simple read that includes access to the Gallup's web strength analysis tool. This alone is worth the purchase for people you may lead volunteers in an organization, who may have no real appreciation for their own abilities. It will also help you to make effective use of people's talents and avoid organizational burnout. Do not expect depth here as the book only covers the surface. Knowing and using a tool such as Myers-Briggs will help you even more.

0385493622|4.0|Buyoed by Dr. Singh's writing style on the Code Book, I decided to tackle another one of his books. Fermat's Theorem is very intriguing, I remember thinking to myself, when I first encountered it in a discrete mathematics course. It is simple, and states that A**n + B**n = C**n does not have any solution for n > 2, and A > 0, B > 0, C > 0. This conjecture, for it is rightly a conjecture and not a theorem, remained unproven for over 300 years until a Princeton mathematician by the name of Andrew Wiles proved it. Fermat, an amateur mathematician in 17th century France, wrote in a book that he had found a fascinating proof of this theorem, but the margins of the book were not large enough to contain the proof. And then, he died. Dr. Singh's book provides a fascinating insight into Fermat, the person: he was a recluse, his reclusion forced by the fact that he was a judge and hence did not mingle with the rest of the population for the fear of adversely deciding a case. So he dabbled in mathematical puzzles; but was distracted easily and frequently. He would convince himself that he had a solution for a problem, and then move on to another problem, often not bothering to write down the solution. Which is what he seemed to have done with his last conjecture. Other mathematicians like Euler and Cauchy (remember them from the Calculus class?) tried to prove the conjecture but could not. Some proved that the conjecture was valid for all prime numbers, others proved that it was valid for values of n upto 100; but no one could prove it as a general case. Until Andrew Wiles came along. <br /> <br />The most interesting aspect of Prof. Wiles' proof is that he uses 20th century mathematics to prove a 17th century conjecture. Certainly Fermat would not have access to the Taniyama-Shimura conjecture, which was proved by Prof. Wiles as a prelude to proving Fermat's Last Theorem. So Fermat would have had some other means to prove his hypothesis -- something more fundamental and primitive, and something compact than the 300 page proof produced by Wiles (after all, Fermat did contemplat writing the proof in the margin, and then gave up on doing so. Could this mean that the proof was no more than a page or so long?) That original proof is yet to be discovered, and there are mathematicians who are still looking for a proof rooted in the mathematics of the 17th century. <br /> <br />This was a fascinating book to read. Dr. Singh takes the reader through a journey that includes many colorful characters spanning three centuries, many continents, and many cultures. You do not have to be a mathematician to enjoy the book (all concepts used are explained a priori), but it does not hurt to know a bit of mathematics to enjoy this book even more.

B000002HAJ|5.0|I got this album shortly after its release when I was newly 17 and I played it to death. It's a fantastic record; more in the vein of the newer modern-rock Cure stuff than the older punky Cure stuff, and it showcases the band's talent better than any of their previous recordings, in my opinion. <br /> <br />From the thickly layered opening track, Open, to the closing track, End, each song is a masterpiece. Unlike the punky earlier Cure, these tracks have a distinct feeling of volume to them - volume as in capacity, not loudness. They are all multiple-layered, and the arrangement comes across as almost orchestral which is a contrast to the Cure of the early 80s when the songs were all three minutes long and sounded similar. Make no mistake, this is classic Cure; but classic evolved Cure. Each incarnation of the Cure has its place, of course, but I do prefer this stuff. It is a fine mix of faster and slower tracks, from light to fairly dark material and the overall production and mix suits Robert Smith and Co perfectly. <br /> <br />The album yielded a few singles, the most well-known of which is the hit Friday I'm in Love. However, the true gems of the album are those which were not big singles - in particular, the almost-title track To Wish Impossible Things, which is an allegory to something, although whether it is a love lost or a life wasted or both or neither, I cannot be sure. However, hands down, my favourite track has got to be Doing the Unstuck, which is vintage Cure. Nobody does the same kind of trippy, bubbly, dizzy, mesmerising champagne happiness as the Cure do, and the track is reminiscent of Just Like Heaven and Hot Hot Hot in its arrangement. Those who appreciate guitar work will marvel at former strings man Porl Thomson's work-rate on this track, in particular if you can hear the live version from the album/dvd Show (which yes, you should most definitely buy as well!) during which he is unleashed on an old Stratocaster. <br /> <br />I think this wasan excellent follow-through to Disintegration, the seminal late-80s album by the band, and it is by far my favourite of theirs. The album also appears in my Top 5 of all time.

I also couldn't believe that Simon would criticize her. But look at her now. Wooooow. I am a huge fan. Track 10 is the best rendition of \\"And I Am Telling You I'm Not Going\\". I am listening to it right now & have chills. I am so glad this chick is getting the praise that she deserves. YIPPY FOR HER GOLDEN GLOBE. I have yet to see \\"Dreamgirls\\", and from the sound of this soundtrack it's ganna be captivating.  Can't wait until her debut CD.  It's worth getting this soundtrack just to hear her voice.  It is unparalleled.  Her voice is truly a blessing and soars to the Heavens.

B00008CLOA|5.0|My history with this album goes back to 1973. I heard a snippet of \\"Money\\" on the radio-barely 20 seconds. It stuck in my mind immediately as something special. I had no idea who it was. I assumed the name of the song was \\"Money,\\" but I had no way of knowing who it was. Don't forget, this was way before the Internet (it was still being developed by Al Gore-ha ha!) The Dark Side Of The Moon album, as some of you will recall, didn't have the song titles on the back cover, so my trips to record departments of stores were unsuccessful. <br /> <br />Finally, in 1974, I was at a Lechmere (remember Lechmere east coasters?) and asked a few employees if they knew who made the song \\"Money\\" that probably came out last year. Someone finally mentioned Pink Floyd and Dark Side Of The Moon. I had heard of Pink Floyd, but that was about it. I just knew they had a reputation of being, well \\"out there.\\"  <br /> <br />Based on that 20 second snippet, I bought Dark Side Of The Moon on the spot, and not for the last time! Since then I've bought it on cassette, CD, and now this 30th anniversary CD. I literally wore the record out throughout 1974 and 1975 while waiting for Wish You Were Here to come out (which Columbia Records wanted the band to title Darker Side Of The Moon. Thank God Roger Waters pretended they were joking.) While waiting, I also bought all of their other albums, even the vastly underrated Obscured By Clouds.  <br /> <br />Needless to say, I'm a Floyd fan forever. This 30th Anniversary Edition is a worthy remaster of this classic. More than likely you already own it if you've read this far, but if not, it's worth every penny.
0689878451|5.0|I think the controversy on this book is blown out of purportion.  It an innocent but true story about 2 male penguins that raises a young chick. People need to come to the realization that just because the animals are of the same sex does not mean they are not capable of loving.  I think more people should read the book and get over their homophobias.
B000HEWEDK|5.0|This movie has been one of my favorites since I was a kid.  This new two dics CD version with all the color enhancements and additional disc with additional info is fantastic.  For a 50's Sci-Fi flick this is a must to have.  The special effects are great and the story and acting are top notch for a Science Fiction movie of this era. If you are collector of the classic Science Fiction add this 50th Anniversary Special Edition of the Forbidden Planet to your collection!
0975991477|4.0|Whether you agree or disagree with what Dr. Lipton says this book is incredibly important. He bridges new discoveries with a new way of thinking about our minds and bodies. Unfortunately radically new ideas tend to be subject of much ridicule when first presented, however I'm convinced. Quantum physics has forced us to think different, and this is exactly what Dr. Lipton  has done. Pick this book up and decide for yourself.
B000BKVQTS|4.0|As much as I love Terry Gilliam, I'll admit that I didn't have very high hopes for his much maligned Brothers Grimm, which suffered from production delays, release date changes, and just overall trouble from the distributers and funders.  That aside, Gilliam still manages to craft a fast moving, whimsical, dark fairy tale featuring Matt Damon and Heath Ledger as Wilhelm and Jacob Grimm respectively; two folklore collectors and con-men who end up becoming heroes investigating the disappearances of young girls in the creepy woods.  Soon enough, they team up with beautiful Angelika (300's Lena Headey) as they take on a horde of beasts and evil lurking in the forest.  Gilliam pulls out no stops as there are many nods and homages to classic Grimm fairy tales, including Monica Bellucci as the evil Queen for whom there is no fairer of them all, and the rest of the cast, including greats Jonathan Pryce and Peter Stormare, are excellent as well.  As for the CGI effects, I keep reading and hearing about how great many think they are, but in truth they are a mixed bag.  Some of them are very well done and look surprisingly real, but a few don't look as great as many are claiming.  That aside, Gilliam's taut direction and the fantastic set design alone are enough to make Brothers Grimm a memorable ride, and anyone having second thoughts about the quality of the film should check it out to see how surprisingly good it is.
B000FGGE68|5.0|Love this flick!  Great Action!  Great Hair! Love the fight scenes!!!
B000ETQRCM|5.0|People who say this album is no good compared to PJ's first few albums are making a big mistake: comparing it to the first few albums. It's not the same. Each time Pearl Jam changes drummers, they change styles, and this is the best of the Matt Cameron years - hard rocking, political but not self-righteous, and ambitious. Phenomenal from start to finish. Too many people compare all Pearl Jam albums to Ten - but the mark of a good band is being able to find new territory without losing an identity. Pearl Jam does that with this album.
B000HCO83Q|4.0|There may currently be a calm, but there is a storm coming.  The conflict between human and mutant is about to heat up.  The spark that will set things off is a new mutant who cancels other mutants.  He has been used to develop a cure to being a mutant.  It is being offered in a voluntary fashion but there are those who believe it will be forced on mutants and Magneto is their leader.  As an added spark, Jean Grey has been found alive. <br /> <br />The cure may be offered to volunteers but authorities have developed cure weapons to use against mutants.  The spark has been put to the tinder.  Magneto's Brotherhood wants to rise and eliminate the so-called cure so that it may not be used against unwilling mutants.  Jean Grey has risen as the most powerful of all mutants and she is on Magneto's side.  It is now time for he X-Men to take a stand and defend freedom, liberty, and the cause of mutants. <br /> <br />This is an interesting film.  Not only do characters die, but we see new sides to old ones.  Xavier reveals his dark side while Magneto shows his good side.  Jean rises as a force of pure fury.  New mutants become part of the story, some more so than others.  In the end we have the feeling of a trilogy ended but there are also new beginnings and plenty of possibilities for more movies.  Check it out.

B000002J0B|5.0|Houses of the Holy was the mighty Zep at near the top of their game. As their first three albums redefined what rock and roll was, HOTH was one of a troika of albums (along with IV and Physical Graffiti) that RE-redefined rock all over again. This was Led Zeppelin at their most legendary, when they truly ruled the world. HOTH introduced the ethereal quality to Zeppelin's music that Prince would call mastery of \\"light and shade\\", from the end vocals of The Song Remains The Same, to the gloomy majesty of No Quarter. This album is a classic from beginning to end.

B000ICL3KG|4.0|The situation in Sea-Tac, WA is deplorable [a school district pulled the film from being seen due because of a stone-age religious fundamentalist parent]. It is simply jaw-dropping to even want to err on the side of ignorance. This is a very well-made film, pensive yet provocative enough to inspire action. At times, it does spend a little too much time romanticizing Gore's personal life, but it isn't overbearing and ably gets back on course. Today, we learn that a massive ice shelf has separated due to increased temperatures. No matter what your religious or political affiliation, you LIVE here with everyone else.
B00004ZAV3|5.0|I am not sure but I think Nowhere Man was a number one hit in 1966. I could be wrong if I am, sorry for my error. Nowhere Man should have been on this cd. Aside from this little glitch, this cd is beautifully 24 bit remastered and has made each of these magical 1960s Beatle masterpieces sound as fresh as they did in the wild 1960s. A nice collection with very informative linear booklet with miniature psychedelic Beatle portraits in the cd booklet. This is an awesome cd despite no \\"Nowhere Man\\". A nice 79 minute trip through the Beatles staggering career of musical genius. You also hear the awesome production quality in each Beatles song courtesy of Sir George Martin. A must have for any Beatle fan or music fan of any music genre. This music is ageless and timeless. Ps: My only other complaint: I wish Capital records would reissue the whole Beatles catologue and give it the same remastering treatment as they did here with \\"ONE\\". Either way Highly recommended, and bloody good listening!!!!!!!!!!!
B000002JSN|5.0|Arguably the best hard rock album ever made, the irony is that many of the tracks on PG were bonus tracks from other albums that never made the cut, and were thrown on PG to take up space. From the opening chords of The Rover and Custard Pie, Jimmy Page's riffs are at top form. Zep takes you to a dreamy, ethereal no-man's land of imagination in Kashmir, an epic song that may be the standard for rock's artistic statement. Side two has many of the throwaway tracks previously mentioned, the most notable being Ten Years Gone, a masterwork of blues-inspired music that nonetheless can't be easily classified. Essential to any rock and roll collection, get this album.
B000H305U0|4.0|I've always admired JT from afar during his NSync days but couldn't bring myself to buy an album - because of my perception it was teenage pop (save for the \\"gone\\" record). But my tune changed with this album because I first didn't recognize him in the ubiquitous \\"sexyback\\" single on the radio until the DJ announced his name, so my interest piqued.  Then I heard Justin play a few cuts on the Elvis' Duran show on my drive to work; I was moved by the Donny Hathawayesque sound of \\"Another Song (all over again).\\"  He got me there and I shed my dollars afterwards to buy the CD.  My favorites from the CD are: My love, Another Song, Losing My Way, and Until the end of time.
B0001GMIOE|4.0|I've tried using aftermarket batteries with my 20D, and none lasted more than a year, while the original Canon battery still works fine. So, I decided to replace my replacement battery with the Canon one. Yes, it's still a bit pricey, but it works better than the cheaper ones.

0099526409|5.0|Many people don't remember how important this book was in the Indian movement of the early '70s.  It is an excellent overview of many of the major atrocities inflicted by white people and the government on Indians, beginning with Columbus (murdered or let die an entire nation) to Wounded Knee (another, another, another round 'em up and kill them action by the army).  As Vine Deloria points out, the government had a perfect record in dealing with Indians:  600+ treaties made; 600+ treaties broken.  An excellent starter book for anyone interested in learning about why Indians dislike state and federal governments.
0529064847|5.0|While I feel this edition of the \\"New American Bible\\" is invaluable, you should avoid it if your faith depends on a strict literal interpretation of the Bible. (If this is the case with you, and you are looking for a nice version of the Bible, I suggest the \\"New King James.\\" That is a well written Bible that many Protestants use, and it should not upset your faith.) While the original \\"Revised Standard\\" is the translation I prefer the most, the \\"New American\\" is also a Catholic Approved Bible. (My only complaint is the overdone Gender Inclusive Language.) While I feel the \\"Good News\\" takes the prize for the most beginner friendly Bible, this edition of the \\"New American\\" comes really close. Like the \\"Good News,\\" this version has intros to the different books that are helpful for beginners or people seeking a deeper understanding of the text. Like the \\"Good News,\\" this version also has titles that break up the text and give an indication as to what the passages pertain to. The 'New Testament' is a revision of the previous edition of the \\"New American.\\" While I still prefer the original \\"Revised Standard,\\" this translation is well done. I say literalists and Protestants should use caution, because they will undoubtedly find the footnotes disturbing. But Roman Catholics and Anglo Catholics should find them impressive as well as enlightening. Amongst other things, the footnotes explain that not everything that was labled as an act of God was so; they also explain that the events were not being documented as they happened. As Gerard Rosse said in his \\"The Cry Of Jesus On The Cross:\\" 'The Bible must not be read as a newspaper, but as narrative theology.' Another nice bonus is this version has a list of the Popes from Peter to John Paul II. Since this is a Catholic Approved Bible, it of course contains the 'Deuterocanonicals.' (Better known as the 'Apocrypha.') I still feel the \\"Good News\\" is the best for beginners; and the original \\"Revised Standard\\" will probably always be my favorite version. But in my opinion, this edition of the \\"New American\\" should be in the library of any Roman Catholic or Anglo Catholic. I dare say Ukraine Orthodox as well. The price of $6.95 is virtually nothing when considering that you are getting a great Catholic Approved Bible, the 'Deuterocanonicals' / 'Apocrypha,' a list of the Popes, great introductions to the books, and outstanding footnotes. Few Bibles will get you closer to Christ than this one!be my favorite version.

B000E0WJIC|3.0|Like the other reviewer said: Mediocre. To me it sounds like another \\"emo\\" band. I'm sure the emo kids will eat this one up, as Im sure that this is the demographic that the band is aiming for.
B00005JNDZ|5.0|The two Bridget Jones films are a modern version of Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice. <br />
B000AARKOO|5.0|A totally captivating movie. Closely follows history, but without being boring. Truly not a boring moment in this movie. The final battle is awesome, almost like being there. The Pilgrim's Guide option made it totally understandable, explaining parts, giving background information that otherwise would not have been known. <br />I've watched it 4 times already and it just gets better and better. <br />Orlando Bloom is fabulous!
B000B8QEYC|5.0|This album is another great work form Enya. Is a very good music with her style and have a very good touch of sensitive.
B000JK8OYU|2.0|Last time could chose free freight, but this time no free freight.
B000002UVX|5.0|I must comment that when this was first ordered, we had it delivered to a P O Box, but to no avail.  Apparently someone there either stole it, or delivered it to the wrong P O Box, but Amazon was quite nice to us, and sent aonther copy free of charge to our residence.
B000083C49|5.0|The movie was a gift for my husband for his collection.  I was thrilled with the quick service and of course he was thrilled with the movie.  In fact, I was surprised to find two of his favorites so easily at your site as they are rather old movies.  Thank You!  Sally P.
B000BJS4SU|4.0|But still a great step in his evolution.  Blues and jazz infused on some already released songs along with a few new ones in a live setting.  Worth a TRY!
B000K7VHQ4|5.0|This was an excellent movie for its mix of special effects, love story, politics, historical backdrop, scenic imagery, not to mention the psychological teasing that interplays between the audiences in the film and the real audience watching the film. Norton's portrayal of a magician whose early mythological encounter with a disappearing master keeps us wondering throughout if it might be actually real, or is it just illusion?<br /><br />In that sense, is this film not a mockery of our tendency to hope beyond all odds? Don't we all want to believe beyond the pragmatism of our age that there are actually some mystics who can defy the laws we've accepted as true by bringing back the dead, preventing corruption, and seeing love triumph over class? Or is the crown prince correct to assert that we are all just fools?
B00006LI4S|5.0|It takes me all the way away, the video and the sound are perfect, the music is perfect, I will own this forever.
0446528056|4.0|Def a good book.  I couldn't put it down.  I agree that he really didn't touch the surface with autism but it was nice to see him talk about it in his books.  A lot of people don't know what it is and how to deal with it.  Good stuff!
B000001G16|4.0|While best known for his jammin licks in the band Bon Jovi, Richie Sambora holds his own this solo album.  Full of grit and soul.
B000002B2T|5.0|Unlike many other artists, Layne Staley's art is life changing for those who listen to it. Listening to Mad Season you can hear hope. There's definitely melancholy, pain, confusion, regret, nostalgia, the list goes on. But you didn't have to look hard to find the hope he had for himself. There was a light at the end of the tunnel. I've never heard a greater display of talent than Layne Staley. He is the greatest singer in rock music & in my opinion, the greatest singer in music overall. I've yet to hear so much emotion in someone's voice. His lyrics are superb. He always knows the right way to say things & even if you haven't been through the same things as him, you find a way to relate to pretty much all of it. Also, the music really lets him show off his versatility. He could sing anything & do it justice. The other thing that's really great is you get to see how much of an influence Layne had on AIC. Jerry Cantrell is one of my top 3 favorite guitarists & a great songwriter, but I still found his solo work to be a little boring. It's odd, but I really couldn't feel much soul. That isn't the case with Mad Season. Even though Layne is the one that shines on this album, we can't forget or ignore the other members. This is the most unique album I have ever heard. These boys are the Quentin Tarantino's of music. Barrett Martin's drums are nothing short of incredible. Especially on \\"X-ray Mind\\". That intro is one of the best I've heard. His style is very unique & he really knows how to get you air-drumming. Mike McCready's guitars are also really unique. They remind you of `60s & 70s style rock. I can't think of a song that he doesn't sound exceptional in. His stand-out solos in \\"Artificial Red\\" & \\"Wake Up\\" really know how to kick arse. I love how in \\"Artificial Red\\" it sounds as if Layne & the guitar are having a conversation. You'll only be able to understand after you hear it. The bass work by Baker is also awesome. I don't know about you, but in some bands I can'teven notice a bass player exists. Mad Season is definitely not one of those bands.  <br /> <br />There's a real chemistry between all the members. They all actually seem really satisfied & happy to be playing together (you can REALLY see it in the live tape that's out there). It's a nice change since you see so many bands breaking up over little arguments or just not getting along. I know they weren't recording & touring for decades or anything, but my point is they enjoyed themselves & you can tell.  <br /> <br />I love every track on this album. I can never listen to just one song. I  can't resist not listening to it start to finish. Here's why each one stands out for me: <br />-\\"Wake Up\\" is an overall great track. Layne's vocals are really touching & make you ache. The lyrics are honest & really fit the music. It actually sounds like waking up.  <br />-\\"X-Ray Mind\\" has awesome drums & bendy guitar. The lyrics are easy to relate to since you can find your own meaning in them other than the one that exists.  <br />-\\"River of Deceit\\". Great vocals & painful lyrics. Really makes you want to read \\"The Prophet\\" (something you should do if you like reading). <br />-\\"I'm Above\\" has a really great chorus. The whole song sounds very 60s. Reminds me of The Doors. <br />-\\"Artificial Red\\" is an amazing blues song. Layne's vocals & lyrics are just... Wow! I can't believe more people don't talk about this song. One of my favorites. <br />-\\"Lifeless Dead\\" has cool guitar work. I like how in the beginning it switches which sides you hear it on your speakers. Awesome scream in the chorus & the guitar just before the chorus is quite memorable.  <br />-\\"I Don't Know Anything\\" is a simple song. You can easily relate to the lyrics. <br />-\\"Long Gone Day\\" is the most unique track on the album & one of the most unique songs I've ever heard. It's very bluesy & jazzy with a certain Latin vibe. The lyrics totally hit the spot. Layne & Mark Lanegan's voices complement each other well.  <br/>-\\"November Hotel\\" doesn't get annoying or old like a lot of other instrumentals. You don't even notice it's 7 minutes long & everyone participates. Starts off with light drums & guitar, but before you know it everybody's rocking out & there's chaos. Maybe chaos isn't the right word since nothing clashes. Everybody's doing their own thing, but the sounds come together & form a masterpiece.  <br />-\\"All Alone\\". A really simple & mellow song with a constant pace & few lyrics. Anybody could come up with these lyrics. It's just \\"we're all alone\\". But Layne makes them sound genius; as if they're something special. The music makes you feel alone. This is the stand-out of the album that turns out to be the perfect way to end things.  <br /> <br />Basically what I'm trying to say is that this album is the sht. This band is the sht. If you don't already own this, you need to. You don't have to like any specific genre. You don't have to like any of the member's main bands. You don't have to be in a specific mood to want to listen to them. You just have to like listening to music. You won't be disappointed.  <br /> <br />Rest in peace Layne & Baker. <br /> <br />P.S.: Everyone should also download their cover of \\"I Don't Want To Be A Soldier\\". It was on some soundtrack. Sounds really smooth & polished. & sorry for the extra long review, but I couldn't help myself.
074356619X|5.0|I loved the movie 'The Secret' but having the audio version to play where ever you want to play it - in your car - in your office - in your bedroom - wherever is just fantastic - you can listen to it over and over - you can pick the cd you want to listen to the most - so the cd's are very much more versatile than the movie - as you listen to these cd's you will be given the tools to literally change your life - you will feel envigorated, exhillerated and movtivated to move forward with the ways to bring what you want to your life ..it's a joyous experience to listen on a daily basis.
0743487486|5.0|We got this book last year.  I love the ideas about treating kids with respect, like you would any other family member.  There is also a dvd you can order off of Alfie Kohn's website, which is good for parents who don't have much time to read but are interested, like my partner.  Putting this parenting style into practice has really made our lives so much better-more peaceful, enjoyable, happier.
1559408855|1.0|After reading all these 5 star reviews i was confident I had myself some real, sick, perversely arousing to my macabe taste and this over-priced movie was such a bore i didn't finish it. Maybe that was when it got good, but I doubt it.  There was a lot of human waste shots, but, it's obviously fake, the \\"torchered\\" youths seem to be enjoying themselves, there's no attempt at penitration, no terror,& no reckless tastelessness. <br />I don't get it I guess, I was literally bored to sleep.
B0000C9ZSV|3.0|One rarely gets to see Jimi's hands on the guitar due to the amateurish camera work. Meantime the cameras zoom too close into his face or neck or the spotlights or whatever. Then they show footage of riots when I'd rather see Hendrix. I mean that's why people buy Hendrix DVD's isn't it. Then I'm wondering why half the solo in 'Hear My Train a Comin' is edited out & why 'Hey Baby' on the film is cut short ! <br />The individuals that filmed this, flung it together & partially butchered it weren't worthy of being involved with this genius. <br />I rate it as 10 out of 10 for the playing & Jimi's incredible tone which was spot on, & I give it 0 out of 10 for the production.  <br />Average therefore is just 3 stars I'm sad to say.
B000H5U832|5.0|I have a four yr old little boy who loves all kinds of trucks and cars.  He could give you the names of all his vehicles long before he could identify his colors.  So when we saw the movie trailers for \\"Cars\\" on the computer, I knew that we needed to get this one.  As one of his Christmas gifts it is quickly becoming his new, all-time favorite.  It takes the self-centered racing car, Lightning McQueen and side-tracks him in a sleepy old town that the interstate by-passed.  During his week of community service, he makes friends and finds out that there is more to life than living in the fast lane.  It is a wonderful movie and well worth watching it over and over as four year olds love to do.
B000GTJT0W|5.0|I really enjoy this adventure movie with a mixture of action & humor. It's a fun movie for the whole family.<br /><br />This was my very first HD movie & I must say it's a great experience watching it in high definition! The video transfer is super. Mind you, I watched it in a 720p 42\\" display & I believe in 1080p resolution plus a bigger display, it's going to rock! Out of 10, I'd score it a full 10! The color of the blue/green sea water, the sand, rock, mountain, smoke, etc are simply vivid. The desert scenes & toward the ending is totally awesome.<br /><br />Now I understand why some viewers said after watching HD movies, it's hard to go back to the old standard DVD... As for the audio, I can't comment since I don't have a HDMI equiped receiver yet but so far the DTS 5.1 is pretty impressive. This movie is definitely worth collecting. Highly recommended!
1582701709|5.0|Awesome, I have the complete set audio, dvd and book!  I recommend this for everyone.  it's all about the law of attraction; good and bad.  I am applying the law of attraction to my personal and business life
0743289412|3.0|This was NOT Mr. king's best book- the story dragged and didn't have that 'invisible yarn' that keeps a story flowing.  The deceased character was very interesting- too bad his wife isn't.
0441003257|4.0|I really enjoyed this book, but you have to have a slightly cynical view of life and not easily offended on the point of religion.  Its about an alliance between an angel and demon and a mixup with the child antichrist.
B00005V3Z4|1.0|Nowhere near as good as the original. Rent \\"Harvey\\" instead. Personally, I think it's because in \\"Harvey,\\" they don't actually show the bunny. Leaves more to the imagination.
0312305060|5.0|I don't know why it took me so long to read this book--I had heard that both it, and the movie made based on it, were wonderful. In fact it had so much hype that I was sure it would not live up to it. I was wrong. It was one of the most enjoyable, moving, lovely reading experiences I have ever had. Not to say it wasn't full of many of the things that make the human experience a difficult one; pain, loss, abandonment, depression, unrequited love...but written with compassion, great insight and with prose that were like a painter's brush. I then saw the movie and they did a good job with it, although I would suggest reading the book first. Highly recommended.
B00009ZYBY|1.0|Ordered this item before Christmas with enough time to ship.  Got a notice it would ship after Christmas.  Never got the item.
068987474X|3.0|While a lot of what Greg says is true, the plain and simple fact (as his co-author Liz points out) is that there are more women than men in this country, and if we ever want to date or get married, we have to be more tolerant of certain behaviors that Greg would have us dump a guy for.  <br /> <br />For example, not calling when he says he will is a sure sign a man doesn't respect your time. However, while Greg would have us dump a guy for it, always dumping someone (especially on his first offense) for this would result in never dating or getting married.  <br /> <br />The simple reality is that, while it is unfair and wrong, we have to tolerate substandard treatment, at least in my opinion. There are those knights in shining armor who sometimes come along and show us what real men are like, however they usually will not come our way.  <br /> <br />It is true that there are some sins we should never tolerate. But for something like not calling on time, most women are more flexible than that, whether we should be or not.  <br /> <br />Greg is a great guy and seems to be great to his wife. He respects women and expects us to always be treated the best way we can be treated. But this isn't reality.  <br /> <br />That's why I'm giving this book 3 stars. Liz really brings reality to the table, and her commentary saves the book from a worse review. It isn't that I disagree with Greg's assertion that these behaviors are rude and arrogant, it is that I really don't think we're going to find Mr. Perfect. I think that is a fantasy and we need to face reality.
B0007M22TI|5.0|I tried this performance on CD and the visual effect of this cast on a dvd made it so much better.  It is mesmerizing.  I can't wait until the other one comes out this month
B000BW7QWW|5.0|I watched the t.v. series first (in DVD), and I got hooked with the story. Then I bought the movie, Serenity. I really recomend this movie. It's an excelent movie, not just for the visual effects but because it's a very well told story. Every character is well developed in the story and the suspense mixed with a very clever sense of humor keeps you sitting without blinking. It's a great movie for us, the lovers of sci-fi. This is the best sci-fi movie I have seen, after Star Wars... Go brown coats!
B000FFJ85I|4.0|Another good, solid album from AFI. I like the turn they seem to be taking here.
0875428940|5.0|It seems to me that for Tarot reader, finding \\"the one\\", if a reader does indeed prefer to have one deck to use with most, if not all readings, is a lot like house hunting. There is a lot of information to gather, but most of what the decision to select one deck as a favorite, or to purchase one home and not another, comes down to how it \\"feels\\".<br /><br />This deck \\"feels\\" like home to me. Yes, there are ample objective reasons to love this deck. Most would appreciate the deck for its artwork. The artwork is stunning and resplendent with rich symbolism. Every major and minor arcana card is rendered with such beauty and grace; it isn't as if you'll find the 4 of Cups depicted with simply 4 Cups standing in the air or something. Each card was created by Robin Wood very methodically and specifically, with such attention to detail and talent. Ms. Wood is exceptionally talented and she allows her pure vision to flow into this work.<br /><br />What I think is the major selling feature of this deck is the way it draws in the reader. There is always something new to catch the intuition's attention; meaning, there are so many subtle details in each card that the intuition will always hone in on the one that will help to best interpret the card's meaning. It is easy to sink into the cards. Every time I read I find myself contemplating the cards as if for the first time, and I have gone through 4 Robin Wood decks. I keep wearing through the cards and bending corners through heavy use.<br /><br />I've read professionally and of course for myself and loved ones, and continue to always go back to this deck. I've found that the cards speak to me in every circumstance and I am able to intuit and deliver necessary, timely information more easily with this deck than with other decks. It's by far my favorite- I guess that's obvious, considering that I keep having to replace worn-out decks!
B000GT7XXW|1.0|I love this movie (see rating), but what's the point of making a movie available for download in 4:3 that was shot in 65mm panavision? What a waste. I'd rather wait a few months...
B00003CXPD|5.0|makes you want to rush out and follow your dreams.  Loved the bit about Billy's and his father's trip to London for the audition.
1878424505|5.0|This book brings so many important concepts into focus that it is a \\"must have\\" for every individual interested in self improvement and achieving true self-actualization in life.
B000JJS8TM|5.0|Every song is different from it's original version, and the most of them are even better, so it's a great choose for those who want something more from the Beatles without expecting to find the same songs but in different order.
B0002F6AH0|5.0|Excellent period footage and commentary by veterans, politicians and civilians involved in the war.  Olivier's narration adds gravity to the well-researched commentary for each episode of the series.  Highly recommended to the serious student of WWII as well as to those with a casual interest in the topic.
B000K7VHQ4|5.0|As a total movie buff who has had nothing but one big disappointment after another through most of 2006, I cannot applaud The Illusionist enough.  This movie truly has all the right stuff.  I cannot think of any area that could have been done better.  The cast, the setting, the direction of the film were all superb.  This is a movie that takes you right from the beginning and has you glued to the screen right up to the end. It has been quite a long time since I jumped up and shouted \\"BRAVO!\\" at the end of a movie, then had to watch it again the next day to pick up all the little details that made it even better.  I have not stopped talking about this movie since its release on DVD January 9th.  If you, too, have had an unsatisfying year in 2006, let The Illusionist make it new for you, too.  Enjoy this rare treasure -- who knows when another close to its many merits will come along!
B000I5X81A|4.0|Vintage Clapton blues with the added resonance of J. J. Cale's musicianship.
B000H5U832|5.0|Thoroughly enjoyed this movie.  Loved the extra pieces one gets with a DVD that are missing at the movie house showing.
B000HIVO64|1.0|This album is different but still what you would expect from Beck. By far the music is good as is par, BUT would somebody please explain to me WHY the DVD that came with it only has 2 channel Digital Dolby and is not 5.1 surround like his prior two albums? I would feel completely ripped off if I wasn't a Beck fan. No wait I do kind of feel ripped off.
B000E1JOSE|5.0|My husband and I play the DVD every week and sing and dance to the music.  It's great fun and the next best thing to being at the concert live.  What a hoot to see Bruce Springsteen and Bonnie Raitt in their youth playing and singing with the great Roy Orbison.  It is a treasure not only to hear the music, but to see it on our 50\\" screen.  This is a must buy if you are a music lover.
B000G759LW|1.0|Don't believe all the hype...this album is terrible.  You will like this album if: <br /> <br />1.You enjoy the sound of a screaming woman singing endless scales...over...and over... and over again. <br /> <br />2.You love songs that go on and on about how great the singer is and just how wonderful she has managed to touch everyone's life (the last track).  It's really pathetic. <br /> <br />3. Sophmoric oversimplifications on what it means \\"to be a woman\\". <br /> <br />That said, there are two good songs on the first disc.  These are: <br /> <br />Back in the day <br /> <br />Still Nasty <br /> <br />But I have to tell you, you get pretty tired of playing these two songs over and over again....best thing is just to download them.  The second disc is pure superfluous junk, with a few good songs to make it interesting.   <br /> <br />Both discs would have made a decent single disc.  Don't waste your money without listening to the whole thing first. <br /> <br />
1932100660|5.0|This is a life changing book! It is written by a reputable scientist with impressive credentials who is not trying to sell you something to make a lot of money. It is easy to read, well documented, and makes sense of all the confusing health and diet recommendations and claims we are being constantly innundated with. It should be read by anyone with a tendency towards diabetes, heart problems, obesity or any of the other ills of our western life style.
B0002MG9SI|5.0|I bought this movie without review, without suggestion from anyone I knew and all I can say is wow... It is a bit of a fairy tale story so try not to look for very much reality but to me it is just perfect - it suspends reality, tells a beautiful story, and the story is timeless - it could have happened 100 yrs ago or yesterday.  <br /> <br />It's not for everyone but it is for me.
B000J103YI|5.0|NOTE: I also posted this review under the Dreamgirls, 2 CD Deluxe Set.<br /><br />After seeing the movie and many listens to the soundtrack, I can now talk about this excellent CD.<br /><br />First, when Dreamgirls landed on Broadway the \\"powers that be\\" went out of their way to deny any direct connection to The Supreme's story. The first page to the movie program corrects this, and pays tribute to not only The Supreme's, but Berry Gordy, and Motown. Jennifer Hudson is a treasure as many have already reported, but more on her later......<br /><br />Beyonce does a superb job portraying Deana Jones, the Diana Ross \\"role\\" complete with many of the insecurities and questions that Diana had when she was singled out to be the star (read Mary Wilson's book, Dreamgirl, for more on this and see my review). Ms. Knowle's standout song here is Listen, and she lets loose on the Disco version of One Night Only. A few critics knocked the song Listen as being out of step with the other songs, however, Listen is set at the time when the movie is taking place in the 70's, making it quite timely.<br /><br />Eddie Murphy is able to shine with his songs here, and why everyone seems so shocked that he can realy sing is beyond me. Patience is another standout track here, and Eddie sings this as a duet with Anika Rose, ala the famed Marvin Gaye/Tami Terrel duets of Motowns glory days. Eddie's alter ego in the movie, James \\"Thunder\\" Early is a mix of Marvin Gaye, James Brown, Jackie Wilson, and others, and the tracks I Want You Baby, Fake Your Way To The Top, Jimmy's Rap allow this diversity to shine. We all (should) know that Jamie Fox can sing, and his standouts here are Steppin To The Bad Side, and When I First Saw You.<br /><br />Jennifer Hudson, what is their to say, she is a vocal powerhouse, and yes she takes down the house with And I Am Telling You I'm Not Going. Jennifer however also shows what she's got with the tender, Love You I Do, the breakthrough of I Am Changing, and the ballad version of One Night Only. If only Florence \\"Flo\\" Ballad had her spirit.<br /><br />The \\"white\\" version of Cadillac Car lends a great time stamp on the era that Dreamgirls starts in.<br /><br />KenChanging, and the ballad version of One Night Only. If only Florence \\"Flo\\" Ballad had her spirit.  <br /> <br />The \\"white\\" version of Cadillac Car lends a great time stamp on the era that Dreamgirls starts in.  <br /> <br />Ken
0679720200|4.0|In the opening chapter we learn that Meursault's (the main characters) mother passed away, yet Meursault stands devoid of any emotional attachment (he didn't even cry). Intrigued by his apathy, I felt Meursault displayed traits of a psychopath. After much searching, I finally realized why Meursault felt indifferent towards his mother. Meursault is a existentialist by nature. Once that is realized, the book travels a linear path to the finale. Meursault life is much too empty, and his existentialist philosophy affects no change in his life. Meursault's friends are more chaotically inspired, than mutually beneficial. In a nutshell Meursault could careless where his relationships lead him. The beauty of the story is found at the end. He convincingly argues about the meaning of fate and life. To him nothing really matters outside the freedom of nothing.
B000I5X81K|4.0|Wow! I loved his others CDs and this one is just as good! Even though half the songs are in Italian, they have really grown on me. I can't understand the words, but the songs are still beautiful. One of my favorite qualities about his music is that his songs seem to be very romantic, which makes them really easy to fall in love with! Haha.  <br />It was all great, except the final song on the CD had a bit of a techno beat, something I didnt expect, and still strikes me as odd. <br />Overall, this CD is a great buy and I'd recommend it to anyone!
B000002JNJ|5.0|just make sure to pick up this CD Before you die so you can spend your last moments knowing you listened to what metal really is! <br /> <br />
0439206472|4.0|After already having seen the movie, I decided to invest in reading the books. Bk #1, THE BAD BEGINNING, only took me an hour to finish, and it was an enjoyable--if dark--read.<br /><br />The Baudelaire children--Violet, Klaus, and Sunny--are left orphaned after a mysterious fire destroys their home and kills their parents. Taken into custody by Mr. Poe, the executor of their parent's estate, they learn that their parent's will states that they must be cared for by a relative. The closest relative, unbeknownest to the children, is Count Olaf, an actor and leader of a theatre troupe who lives in a dilapitated house on the other side of town.<br /><br />Things, of course, only go from bad to worse after the children move into Count Olaf's home, which is strangely covered inside and out with drawings and representations of a strange-looking eye. Count Olaf even has a tattoo of the same image on his ankle. As the Count hatches a scheme to gain control of the Baudelaire fortune, which the children are not privy to until Violet comes of age, the children are alternately scared of their new \\"parent\\" and determined to find a way out of their dreadful situation.<br /><br />I enjoyed this walk on the dark side, and plan on reading Book #2 in the series later today. That said, however, I think it depends on your child and his or her maturity as to whether this would be a good read for them or not. Although the reading material is suitable for around 8 years old and up, the book IS dark-natured, and might scare some children. If they've already seen the movie, they might be prepared for its darkness--if the movie depiction scared them, then hold off on the book for awhile.<br /><br />Reviewed by:  Jennifer Wardrip, aka \\"The Genius\\"
0786838655|5.0|I really enjoyed this book, for a few reasons.  First I absolutly love mythology and find the stories to be so fasinating.  I love how the author incorporated the mythology stories into a book based on modern day.  It was such an original idea.  The book really kept my attention, it was a page turner.  I could not put it down.  For those of you who like history, and or mythology stories, this is a must read book.

B00092ZMDY|5.0|The Eagles Farewell I Tour - Live from Melbourne is superb! The Eagles are not just singers or guitarists but they are very highly talented musicians. The performance by the Eagles on stage was truly amazing. The background accompaniment provided by violinists/saxophonists/pianists were just great. Every song is worth listening to. You will want to view the live concert DVD and play your favourite songs again and again. You will never get tired of it. I would recommend it to everyone, both young and old.
B00005JPCY|5.0|Excellent movie. A great plot, great acting, great movie overall. <br /> <br />Movie is about an agent (Denzel) who is called into a scene where a ferry ship has just blown up. He is to find the person who caused it. With the help of forensics he determines that a woman (Patton) was killed right before the ship blew up. He turns to a group of people that have designed a machine that can go back 4 days and some hours and see exactly what a person was doing at that time. For some reason, they can also transport items back to the past. This agent decides to transport himself back to the past in order to save the woman and the 500+ passengers on the ferry.  <br /> <br />Movie is full of action. Towars the end it has you on the edge of your seat. The acting is great by everyone. It has a sorta sci-fi deal to it with the whole \\"time machine\\" but it is played off good for this movie's purpose. It doesnt come off as a joke.  <br /> <br />Overall, it has great features and great effects. Recommended as it is a catchy and different type of movie.
B0000457HB|3.0|Barry White, known for his iconic growling baritone, was at the forefront of Disco music.  His career continued into the `80s and `90s.  In fact one of his biggest hits would be 1994's \\"Practice What You Preach\\".  He would also become - along with Al Green, Gloria Gaynor, and a dancing baby - a reoccurring theme on FOX's hit television series \\"Ally McBeal\\".    THE ULTIMATE COLLECTION consists of 30 songs, from 1973 to 1999 on two discs; songs are in semi-chronological order.  Disc packaged in clear jewel case; total running time disc one: 64:13, total running time disc two: 65:35.  Booklet includes a short essay by Brian Chin, several photographs, photos of his pas album covers, and track information (including the release dates, chart positions, and albums of origins).  Sound quality is excellent.      Disc one has songs from 1973-1976.  Disc one, with the exception of 1973's \\"Love's Theme\\", has songs from 1977-1999.  The second disc is dominated by `70s recordings; tracks 9-15 are from 1979, 1980, 1987, 1991, 1994, 1994, and 1999, respectively.  The closest thing to a \\"glaring omission\\" is the absence of 1989's \\"The Secret Garden\\", the collaboration with El DeBarge, Al B. Sure!, and James Ingram from Quincy Jones's album \\"Back on the Block\\".      Three songs on disc one (tracks 6, 12, 16) and two songs on disc two (tracks1 and 8) are instrumental tracks by The Love Unlimited Orchestra.     My only complaint is that with 2 CDs, there should have been more music (There is just over one hour per disc).  I also would have preferred a completely chronological track order.  Other than that, this is a great collection for fans of Barry White as well as those who enjoy 1970s Disco music.
B000FMGTTE|4.0|Great opening score.  I didn't think so at first, but I truly prefer this one over John Williams '78 score.   It's cut down just a little bit though, but it's a bit faster, crisper, and better uses the snare drums - particularly during transitions within the score.    Only a couple of things missing:  1.) The Krypton theme as mentioned earlier  2.) Superman's standing ovation in the baseball stadium and Titan-tron view at the end of Rough Flight.  Very uplifting.  I almost wanted to stand up and applaud him myself when I saw the movie.
B000002UHG|5.0|Richard Wright is an amazing talent and this concept album attests to that.  Other reviewers have written about the content and various aspects of the music of this album, so I spare the reader from repeating details and technicalities.  I have had this album for about 6 years now, and recently returned to it, and listened to it by headphone a few times in a matter of a few days.  Wright's soundscapes are amazing, inspiring, moody, melancholic, choking, and rejuvenating.  In other words, there isn't anything he can't do with music.  He returns to what Floyd lost to Roger Water's departure: concept album.  The entire feat is about repressed memory syndrome due to childhood abuse, and how a remakable human effort can put that all behind, so that one can live a better future.  A truly humane and inspiring work of art, and socially committed, not to mention musically magical.  For this I am eternally thankful.
1932100660|5.0|As an M.D. nutritionist I was inspired by and practiced the concepts in Dr Campbell's book for over 10 years. I'm here to document that in practice,with very sick people these principles of nutrition work! For the past decade I have taught and guided many patients in vegan diets using Campbell's earlier booklet, The China Project, as my primary reinforcement. Thousands of very ill people with cancer, autoimmune disease,degenerative heart and vascular disease and other problems have reaped the benefits of this landmark nutritional masterpiece. Acheiving nutritional excellence does not \\"treat\\" disease. It does, however, enhance our body's innate physiologic mechanisms which fight disease. For over 10 years I've documented these often dramatic and unbelievable results. The beneficial response patterns over time are clear and undeniable. To delay reading this book is to postpone a journey into wellness. This book can and will change your life forever and you will never again fail to understand why you are sick and why conventional medical treatment may not be the answer. Doctor's, hospitals and medication kill over 200,000 people a year. Can you afford to trust your health to a medical system that may not have the answers to your dilemma? The answers you seek, the understanding you crave will be found in The China Study.       Dan E. Chesnut,M.D.

1558808000|4.0|I found it interesting that Roger Ebert disliked this movie. This movie is not artistic or well-acted. The situations are ludicrous and unlikely. However, this movie offers well-executed comedy that is highly entertaining.<br /><br />Michael J. Fox is Brantly Foster, a recent college graduate and the nephew of a business executive and his wife. Foster is intelligent and considers that Uncle Howard (Richard Jordan) might give him an opportunity in his company. A job in the mail room was not exactly the start that Foster had in mind.<br /><br />Foster realizes that in a corporation the size of his uncle's that it is easy to do things without anyone realizing what is happening. So Foster sets himself up as newly hired executive Carlton Whitfield. Most of the executives accept Whitfield for what he seems to be. Foster's only significant problems are keeping Uncle Howard from finding out that he is also Carlton Whitfield and keeping his mail room boss from learning that he is not always delivering mail when his boss thinks he should be.<br /><br />Foster/Whitfield soon encounters beautiful Christy Wills (Helen Slater), a young and highly intelligent executive, with whom he soon falls in love. Just as quickly he encounters Aunt Vera (Margaret Whitton) and has more than one amorous encounter, before and after finding out she is his aunt by marriage.<br /><br />With Foster impersonating an executive while working in the mail room, courting Christy, who, unbeknownst to him, is also involved with Uncle Howard, and avoiding Aunt Vera as much as possible, the comedic potential is high, and the movie delivers. Much of the comedy is borderline slapstick, but much of it is also situational.<br /><br />The highlight of this movie, as with many light comedies of the 80s, is the somewhat cliche happy ending in the face of apparent doom. While you know there has to be a happy ending somewhere, you have to be very attentive to catch the clues that suggest what the ending might be.<br /><br />This movie is one of my favorite 80s comedies. While some critics have treated it harshly, the movie is fun to watch over and over because the situations, while predictable, are well done. Michael J. Fox at the peak of his career always brought a likable presence to the screen and his execution usually brings at least smiles and more often laughs.<br /><br />Note that this version is a VHS tape and a DVD version also exists.t be. <br /> <br />This movie is one of my favorite 80s comedies.

But all in all - great performances by James and the backup singers (who are the best I've ever heard). Looking forward to more holiday music from JT. <br /> <br />

0618680004|2.0|I am an evangelical Christian who has enjoyed Dawkins' writing in the past.  I sometimes share his frustration with the behavior of Christians in the name of Jesus.  I would also recommend that Christians read this book, because of how it helps inform us about other viewpoints, even those with which we disagree. <br /> <br />It would be wonderful, one day, to pick up a book written about the futility and vanity of the \\"culture wars.\\"  It is possible to be both spiritual and anti-religious. <br /> <br />Although God did not need humanity, out of love God created humanity; although Jesus did not wish to die, out of love he accepted the cross; although God could have destroyed all who destroyed others through their greed and lust for power, instead God became human to offer reconciliation for those who desire it.  These are not scientific facts, which are not the ultimate concern of religious people, but Biblical truths.  Dawkins can write whatever he chooses, to and about whomever he chooses; he must determine his own standards as best he can.  Christians should follow these Biblical truths, and abstain from these \\"culture wars,\\" pursuing reconciliation, not division.  Our standards are clearly laid out for us. <br /> <br />Read the book - check it out of the library, if you want.  Just don't get sucked into a worldly battle. <br /> <br />

0618680004|1.0|The God Delusion is one of the most depressing books I remember reading. Not because of Dawkins' fanatical disdain of religion. I gave up believing in religion more than fifty years ago. My reasons were; 1) hypocrisy of religions, 2) internecine warfare between religions, 3) sexual and mental abuse of innocent children (and gullible adults), and 4) religions were created by human beings for controlling the hearts and minds of others. It seemed irrational that a `living' God would be confined to ancient scriptures. Was that all He had to say? Do we still need ancient words thumped into us because we're too thick to know what is beneficial or harmful? Come on! On the other hand . . . .<br /><br />I am suspicious of Dawkins' agenda. As an atheist he strenuously attacks religions, even supplying \\"A partial list of friendly addresses, for individuals needing support in escaping from religion\\". Why would any independently functioning, intelligent person require help to escape from something that is so obviously false? It may be that most believers are neither independent or intelligent. Perhaps those with intelligence have simply not taken the time or trouble to think for themselves. Another, more pernicious reason, I suspect, lies between the lines of Dawkins' book. He seems to be keen on becoming the first high priest of Atheism. `Follow me out of the bondage of religion. I will lead you into another form of bondage free from illusory faith and hope. I will raise your consciousness, fill your mind with the wonders of science, and prove to all human beings that nothing exists beyond scientific provability.' Like gravity didn't exist until Newton `discovered' it?<br /><br />Dawkins' bibliography is as extensive as his naming of friends and allies, but he somehow, perhaps consciously, ignores the dissenting voice of another rational geneticist. Readers would be well advised to read Gabriel Dover's scientific views of Dawkins in Dear Mr Darwin.<br /><br />More than anything mentioned above is the ridiculous assumption that divinity can be subjected to scientific criteria after someone's personal revelation or in advance of a possible manifestation `evolving' from an experience. This writer had a remarkable experience at the age of eleven. The comforting and confident voice I heard did not identify itself. It did not demand worship or impose any obligations whatsoever. It simply provided help and comfort. I might have later dismissed it as an hallucination or psychotic moment of a distressed and naive eleven year old boy. However, I didn't dismiss it. Nor did I permit Ego to expand the experience for self aggrandisement.<br /><br />I cannot say if God exists, but some wonders may only be revealed to and recognized by minds that have not denied their possibilities in advance. If God does exist it seems highly unlikely He will be troubled by our limitations.<br /><br />17 January 2007ything mentioned above is the ridiculous assumption that divinity can be subjected to scientific criteria after someone's personal revelation or in advance of a possible manifestation `evolving' from an experience.

B000F39M9W|5.0|I feel privileged to be a season ticket holder of the Los Angeles Philharmonic.  Even before Walt Disney Concert Hall opened in 2003, under Maestro Salonen this orchestra proved itself one of the finest in the world.  As I write this, I am \\"recovering\\" from a weekend performance that included Mahler's 7th Symphony.  I am still bumping into the furniture -- it was awesome.  (This Webern/Mahler performance will soon be available on i-Tunes.)  A brilliant performance of The Rite of Spring was programmed during Disney Hall's opening gala concerts.  This CD represents the Phil's debut recording on Deutsche Gramophone, and was recorded live during its regular concert season in the Spring of 2006.<br /><br />There is tremendous energy to these interpretations; the Mussorsky is rapid, mult-faceted and rhythmic.  The Bartok is brilliant and quick without losing its spooky roots.  This is not a CD to relax to, you should turn it up.<br /><br />This performance of the Rite of Spring may well be the new standard.  It is brilliant, bright, very visual, and rock steady.  It is showy and at the same time, very articulated.  It creates continuous momentum up to the brief and explosive final cadences.  There is a particular genius to Salonen's leadership that clarifies the music and makes it easier to understand -- and must constitute a liftime of risk, hard work and continued analysis on his part.  And the orchestra is perfection, the soloists outstanding!<br /><br />The Los Angeles Times review of this CD noted that the artwork failed to include a picture of the Walt Disney Concert Hall, so a decal was affixed to the case.  If you have never seen the Hall and you don't have a decal on your copy, pull up an image on your computer.  With its acoustics and beautiful shapes, the Hall deserves recognition too!
B000A2XC1C|4.0|In a day and age where claymation is archaic and computer generation is typical, Santa Claus the movie is a refreshing bit of story telling for young and old alike. For the young, it answers some of the nagging questions of where did Santa come from and how does he get it done. For the adults, there's good guys and bad guys and innocence and forgiveness...plenty to share at the dinner table to illustrate themes of the season. Santa Claus the Movie is delightful and very entertaining for all in the family, and I highly recommend it with hot chocolate and popcorn!
B00005ASOI|5.0|This film is utterly amazing to look at.  Dario Argento was a master at these kind of films from 1975 to 1987.  During that time, he made 6 films, several of which are masterpieces.  This is his signature film, the only that he will always be known for.  It's a worthy film to be known for.  It's one of the most terrifying films you'll ever see.  Seeing it letterboxed on DVD is the 2nd best way to see it.  I would love to see it in a theater (it was shot in 2.35:1).  It was shot on 3 strip Technicolor stock, which is why the colors are so vibrant and startling.  It was one of the last films to be shot on the old Technicolor stock (the same stock used for The Wizard of Oz).  The film's plot really doesn't make a lick of sense, but the visuals are utterly amazing.  Most of Argento's films have the same plots.  An English/American artist of some kind goes to Italy and gets involved in a murder mystery.  But his visuals overpower his stale plots.  The music by Goblin (who scored several Argento works) is one of the most amazing soundtracks in film history.  Argento made a few more masterpieces after this (Inferno and Phenomena), but this was his peak, and he's never come close to repeating or surpassing it.  This is a masterpiece...

0679422714|4.0|My initial impression of this book was it was just another book on a forgotten Chinese leader. It was not long before I was absorbed in the 56 chapters of this book. Using newly declassified Soviet source I became more aware what really was behind early Nationalist government and its dependence on Lenin's aid for controlling China. Chiang Kai-Shek (abbre. CKS thereafter) along with revolutionaries at the time who were invited by Lenin to master communism techniques. Those who favored a social class struggle and effectively applied a brutal social reform became communists; those who favored a gradual transformation became nationalists.<br /><br />Inspite of numerous Chinese, and non-Chinese language references cited, the authors did not carefully research and sometimes drew premature conclusions based on their grasp of the content. Some of the examples include but not limited here.<br /><br />During the Northern Campaign to unify China, Sun Yet-Sen probably had his own  agenda than Moscow's envoys. Officially his motto was \\"United with Soviets and Communists support the labor and farmers\\". The alliance became problematic quickly after the alliance as book suggests. Sun died and CKS who rose to replace Sun still had to rely Lenin for support. CKS's 1923 tour of Soviet Union showed disappointment (pp 19-25 in Reference 1 and pp 44-45 not substantiated in the book). It failed to mention that anti-imperialism was high on CKS agenda. Rather, the book merely suggested \\"CKS was being liquidated by Borodin with secret order\\" from Lenin. However, it was not confirmed in any documents. The split (i.e., purge of the communists) initiated by CKS was more an expression of disappointment of Nationalist faction over the socialists after the Second Congress in 1926 (pp 43). It was not a decision made by CKS. Confidential documents seized by Peking government showed Chinese communists were linked to Soviet subversion. Furthermore, bad news from Changsha violence instigated by Mao affected Nationalist army officers and soldiers alike. The order to purify communists in Shanghai was a matter of time to gain stronghold by KMT by riding trouble makers (pp 45).<br /><br />The book states Mao was on Nationalist payroll to be a member of a standing committee around 1922. In those days the difference between Nationalist and Communists is the ideology employed. Sun's Huang-Po Military Academy started with 500 rifles donated by Lenin. Socialism and capitalism were openly debated by cadets, instructors and civilians. It was perfectly acceptable to switch from communism to nationalism or vice versa. It is somewhat similar to a Republican in America switches to become a Democrat. Even as late as 1949 the defected generals allowed their subordinates to choose side going to Peking or Taiwan (pp 308-9).<br /><br />The explanation about Chiang made a deal with Mao let the Reds go in exchange of his son's release makes a nice story (pp137). However, it is not substantiated with any credible citations. The situation is much more complex as the truth really lies in the diary of CKS and his son CCK at Hoover's Institute's vault. A lot of long march occurred in the uncharted territory of the Celestica Kingdom. My 2001 trip to NE Sichuan-Gansu following the footsteps of terrain and long march suggested it was and is exceedingly difficult today to pursue people in these steep hills. It would take millions soldiers to encircle and trap the red army. It was a lot easier for the regional nationalists chase reds out of their turf giving them to other regional commanders.<br /><br />The description of Dadu bridge crossing (pp153-155) is an interesting one as it would certainly rewrite the modern history of PRC and ruins its credibility. Edgar Snow wrote a different version story dramatize the event. Every Chinese citizen today was taught early about the courageous walk across the planks on the bridge under \\"heavy enemy gun fire\\". If nationalist soldiers defending the same bridge by Li were actually 50 kilometers away and soldiers defended the bridge not there, this would have devastating impact on the credibility of modern PRC government. This is substantiated as Mao had often said to Zhou En-Lai:\\" We write modern history anyway we feel as fits\\".<br /><br />Another example of premature conclusion was labeling KMT general Hu Tsung-Nan a communist sleeper (pp 301). During the 1947 retake of Yenan, it was not \\"Hu K'ung-Mien, a representative of Hu, who passed on secrets to Mao\\" (pp 301). Rather, Hu's personal secretary Xiong Shiong Zhuan, recruited from Tsinghua University passed the information to Yenan. Mao was so confident about the source he did not allocate military resource to resist Hu. 90% of the Red Army was sent Manchuria instead (pg 302). Hu did not suspect Xiong. Mao stayed behind playing hide and seeks with pursuers (pp 304). The same argument went for General Wei Lihuang whose strategy in Manchuria caused the demise of the Nationalist military and support from the US (pp 306-8), as well as chief architect of Huai-Hai campaign involving some spies generals who deliberately messed up the battle plans causing the collapse of half a million nationalist soldiers equipped with American weapons (pp309).<br /><br />The downfall of the Nationalists and lack of support from the mass was described vividly. Chiang's reliance of his relatives, using less capable civil servants caused so much discontent. It was rumored his appointees were there for themselves. Perhaps because of Chiang's inconsistent policy he was the cause of fall of his own government.<br /><br />As Mao's indoctrination advocate and promise to the majority (97% of Chinese were peasants) to stand up fight against the mandarin system installed for centuries. The Communists promise appears to win an upper hand than the 3% landlord or gentry's class who support the nationalists. With so much defection going on, Chiang began to have less and less confidence in his officials. He had to rely on his own Huang Pu cadets who were labeled criminals of revolution. At battle field he often sent two officers to spy on another to ascertain one would not betray him thus making the task tedious and ineffective.<br /><br />The argument from Taiwan has been that \\"Communist moles\\" were planted everywhere. What happened to the Nationalists moles on the Communist side? After their agents were sent to infiltrate the liberated areas they realized many Communist teachings actually were for the people. In this case they just gave in. The total destruction of CCP's tight public security system on people's privacy meant there was little or no way can an individual (mole) contact ROC even if he wanted to. Children were told at school to spy on their parents. All individuals require ID at neighborhood association and police knows everyone and watch strangers like hawks today. Any stranger temporally taking up residence is required to submit registration and is under constant surveillance.<br /><br />After Mao liberated Chiang's capital Nanjing (pp 320-1) Chiang and people's party (KMT) essentially lost the support of the mass. Unlike the Japanese or Russians KMT did not carry out a \\"scorch earth policy\\" when they left mainland (pp321). They did manage to take them treasured imperial museum collection and some light items of military or economical use to Taiwan. Chiang left China with little damage. KMT left 68 ordinance and ship yards alone. It did much little destruction compared to the Soviets or Japanese. Chiang, while autocratic but believing in democracy and being a Methodist himself is not like Mao. The book pointed out, this was why Chiang was defeated by the authoritarian Mao (pp321).<br /><br />The authors also went into great details about waves of purge campaigns after taking over mainland China (chapters 34-47). From waging a wasteful Korean War with loss of 400,000 lives (pp 378), persecution of the intellectuals, anti-anything not in line with his philosophy, Mao's best weapon was use one group fight against other rivals so as to intimidate the mass. His organizational skills surpass any state leaders. He now has total control on China.<br /><br />Since the time of its first ruthless emperor, Qin Shihuang, known for building the Great Wall, China had been under centralized authoritarian rule. But when the Republic was formed in 1912, hopes were high for democratic political change. However, external and internal wars, self-serving warlords, and abysmal nationalist leaders tragically retarded China's political modularization. In 1949, a peasant rebellion influenced by a communist ideology led by Mao supported by Stalin created the PRC and drove the Nationalists to Taiwan. Mao Zedong, the self-proclaimed new emperor, perpetuated and intensified mainland China's despotic political tradition. Today's China is once again on the verge of merging with capitalism. Yet democratic reform in the PRC is still far from a certainty, much less a success. Fortunately, there are reasons to be optimistic. For one thing, Taiwan is prospering. Over the past decades, the Taiwanese have proudly proven that Western ideas of capitalism, freedom, and the rule of law can thrive together with Chinese culture. It may be this type of reform which will work in modern China. That may take some time for the central government to accept.<br />How Mao's well intentional programs failed miserably in the 1950-70 can be found in chapter 40 (pp 426 and on). Without any new technology people were pressed to carry out wasteful projects and most had to be abandoned. In 1957, Mao envisioned a scheme to beat Great Britain's steel production with another campaign. The rice fields were littered with home made dirt blast furnaces to produce steel (pp 431). Trees were cut to feed into those monstrous furnaces. People threw in their kitchen skillets to meet the useless iron production quota had no kitchenware to use. It was the kids, peasants who tried to please Mao who continued on with the non-sense talk\\" bourgeois professors' knowledge should be treated as dogs' fart, worth nothing\\"(pp 434). His edict to consolidate families into a commune work unit became so unpopular and brutal it had to be abandoned.<br /><br />Mao's campaign to elimination seed eating birds turned China into a disastrous locust and insect invasion on farms from the eco-imbalance effort 38,000,000 people starved to death (pp 439, numbers are higher than reported from other sources).  The death numbers never seem to bother Mao. He went in so far as telling Moscow in 1957 that China was ready to sacrifice 300 million for the sake of revolution. \\"The Tibetans did not even own rice bowls any more.

I highly recommend it to anyone who wants to improve their life with proper eating and eliminate the things that  are wearing you down.It was not what I expected. I thought it  would just be another diet and recipe book trying to sell you a supplement of some kind. It has very good information and tells of legitimate studies that back up all the information.MaryL.

The only thing that would make it better is if it came with a few more nerf darts (it only has enough to fill it once and you can not purchase extra of this kind yet).  It's a great alternative for the boys who like to \\"play guns\\", with out the look of the real thing.

B0007GADZO|5.0|The negative reviews here are a sad commentary on the extent to which most people want an artist to go on doing whatever he did before. Vai is one of those rare musicians who is truly versatile. After a crowdpleasing opening track (very stereotypically metal) this compilation explores many moods and directions; there's even a quasi-Zappa solo. Vai does have a slight tendency to be facile, but there are substantial compositions on this album. It's a very fine and thoughtful piece of work.

0316548189|5.0|Despite due respect for a great leader, I did not really expect to like this autobiography very much. Mandela is no great speaker, his TV presence is rather flat, his English apparently not masterful. The life story in summary does not seem to have that much interest either, considering the long jail time and the fact that most of the \\"hot action\\" of the anti-apartheid movement happened while he was on Robben Island.<br />All wrong. The writing is surprisingly fluent, the story telling surprisingly efficient and free of waste as well as redundancies. Also free of sentimentality and exaggerated pathos.<br />If there is anything that I wished to be more detailed it is the period of his childhood and youth. This period is described in a rather remote way and with a sometimes irritating lack of explanation or reflection. I realized that may have happened due to the conditions under which the book was written: in jail. Also I could imagine that editors suggested some shortening: after all the book is still quite hefty.<br />If there is one negative comment that I have to make, it refers to NM's insistence that all trouble between black groups, such as the Inkatha violence problems, or tribal conflicts, have been caused by the perfidy of the whites. As much as I can understand the psychology behind this wishful thinking, I do not think it is a realistic approach.<br />Despite this comment and despite the book's size, it is never boring. Highly recommendable.
0060512806|5.0|One could rave about the seamless plot, the perfect weaving of multiple timelines, locations, and characters.

B00005JPCA|5.0|The most human Bond so far, and to me the best. This Bond can bleed when he is injured, he screams when he is tortured, he cries or tries not to when he has reasons to, he can fall in love, and Craig makes it all completely plausible. It is as if James Bond suddenly had moved out of the realm of comics into the realm of real life.<br /><br />Let's not be delusional, this is still plain entertainment without pretensions to being art. But it is entertainment on a more intelligent level. Not to forget, this Bond also is fortunate to have one of the best Bond girls in Bond history as a play mate. Eva is gorgeous.<br /><br />The story uses fewer gimmicks than Bond's older versions. That is neither good nor bad in itself, but it does add to the \\"more human\\" feeling.
B000G8NXYG|5.0|Take a look at all the \\"classics\\" from the 40's on: many of them balloon over 3 hours and in some cases, fall dangerously close to 4. Now I have no issue with long films but I tend to like them better when the film kind of warrants it. JFK, one of my top 3 films ever, is at 3 hours and 15 or so and yet I never felt one ounce of it with me turning it off going \\"that was a long movie!\\" Seven Samurai's strength, and also of director Akira Kurosawa's, is that we have an interest and we're able to maintain it throughout the entire film even if the basic plot is pretty easy. How newer films can't maintain interest with the same idea in an hour and a half is beyond me. <br /> <br />The premise is really easy to see: a village terrorized by bandits needs help so they send a couple of people into town to hire samurai, hoping that they can accept payment in rice and nothing else. They manage to find it though with 7 samurai: Kanbei, Katsushiro, Gorobei, Kyuzo, Heihachi and Shichiroji. The 7th, Kikuchiyo, is a pretty out-there guy who wants to be samurai but isn't one so he overcompensates. Then the battle is on as the 7 samurai make a defense against the incoming bandits. <br /> <br />Seven Samurai, despite its length, is arguably Kurosawa's most accessible. In a way like the Godfather and Apocalypse Now to Francis Ford Coppola or Raging Bull and Goodfellas to Martin Scorsese, those looking for a good test in whether they would like a Kurosawa film tend to look here, or at the very least, Rashomon. The characters are well-defined and memorable, each scene is important and it's also well-directed without being \\"showy\\". The acting, especially by star Toshiro Mifune, will probably be a bit too noticeable. On first glance, it seems as if he's overdoing it, laughing maniacally, screaming and jumping all over. He reminded me of a bipolar Looney Tune that they didn't use. But then you realize that he overcompensates in everything he does, not only in his attitude but in his giganticsword he has to carry around. If there is one complaint is that the 7 samurai and small villagers such as Shino, Hanzo and Rikishi are easily identifiable but some don't really have clearly defined personalities. Samurai like Heihachi or Shichiroji kind of blend into the background because Kikuchiyo, Kanbei or Katsushiro get so much screen time. <br /> <br />Since this is a Criterion, you're going to get a huge remastering and restoring effort. Do they succeed? In part. The actual print is near flawless with nary and scratches or dust or anything. However, the main print seems off and there's a lot of vertical lines that show up, making the image look like it's raining. It ruins a great moment when Kyuzo returns from dispatching 2 guards and stealing a musket. Instead of him exiting an empty misty forest, the whole print just looks dirty. As for sound, it does sound great and well spaced out. People might go after the redone subtitles but honestly, they don't harm a thing. <br /> <br />The special features are also great but it doesn't look packed but there's quite a bit to get through. The commentary is informative but it's also a bit too stuffy, in that kind of \\"boy I know so much\\" tone and he also narrates some of the action, literally going: they look left, now they walk right, now they look right and they go left. I mean, that's not commentating, that's describing for people who are not blind it seems. The round table where one person gets a crack at commentating on a section at a time is better. We get a making-of that's pretty extensive and we get an informative sit-down interview with Kurosawa himself. If there is a complaint is that it's always fun to hear directors tell of inspirations so here we don't really get any in-depth looks at each of his films but he does mention them in certain contexts. <br /> <br />This film is literally the most expensive DVD purchase I've made but I don't regret it one bit. So if you can stomach the sometimes excessive pricein some circles or its length, then you'll be treated to a rightly deserved title of \\"one of the best movies ever\\".
B00005JP9V|5.0|When I heard (very recently), that the book Children of Men was being converted into a movie, I was only mildly interested, because I'd only read the book very recently after a number of authors I respect had alluded to it in favourable language.  I've read all of P. D. James's murder mysteries, but hearing about this foray into dystopian sci-fi didn't immediately energize me.  A lone pregnant woman in a world of mass infertility?  Come on.  Finally I checked the book out of the library and was surprised to find that the gimmick drew me in.  James had thought carefully through the violence, panic, and confusion twenty years' sterility would generate, and her detailed construction of such a disintegrating world was very powerful.  Unfortunately, I didn't buy the motives attributed to the characters and found the plot unsatisfying.  The premise ended up working beautifully, but, in my judgment, James had not provided such a compelling premise and setting with equally compelling characters or story. <br />  <br />This book, then, faltered in the ways a book should be different from a movie: the subtleties of interior psychological realism and the more intricate mechanisms of plot.  It must therefore have been an ideal book to make into a movie, since movies tend to simplify plot, streamline character, exteriorise psychology, and more fully realise setting.  At least, I decided that after reading some excited reviews of the movie, and my wife and I watched it the other afternoon. <br />  <br />It was difficult to watch, but very powerful and effective.  The large and rather meaningless supporting cast of the book were collapsed into a few key personalities whom we got to know and hoped they wouldn't have to die.  The few key personalities even cracked a few jokes--rare enough in a James book, for all her other excellent qualities.  The geography of the book--a spatial mess (we're going backward and forward and around in circles)--became, for the most part, one helpfullyheadlong flight.  The book alludes to refugee camps but never enters them; the moviemakers rightly seized on these camps as the most visually compelling illustrations of a culture gone mad.  We spend quite a bit of time in those camps.  Perhaps most significantly, the book's obsession with the relationship between Theo Fallon (the hero) and England's head of state is completely eliminated in the movie, which instead explores the desperation of rebels and refugees.  It is no longer a story about power structures but about the oscillation between despair and hope.  In its combination of casual violence and insistence upon the dignity of human life (in general and particular), it's a cross between The Bourne Identity and The Pianist.   <br />  <br />The movie is violent but must be; I found myself thinking of Nazi Germany, and Ireland in the 1970's, and the Middle East, and the Sudan, and all those places in the world where evil is more obvious, life more desperate, and hope more precious.  This movie helps me realise that the distance between who we are and who we ought to be is just as great in the (comparatively) peaceable West (established by the film's setting in Britain, whose British are the cruel ones), but in some of the more violent spots of the world is more accurately measured. <br /> <br />I should add that my wife and I had vastly divergent emotional reactions to this movie, reflected perhaps in the variety of opinions already expressed on this review board.  She was overwhelmingly oppressed by the evil and violence--it is true that very bad things happen to most of the characters.  Well, all of them.  Take our experiences as a warning: you may finish this movie inspired by a ray of hopeful dawn or deeply disturbed by the profundity of night that precedes it.

B000JK8OYU|2.0|One man's opinion, so please take it as such.  I grew up with the Beatles, and as a avid fan of the Beatles I can appreciate their music in almost any format, however . . .  If you appreciate the genius and artisty of the Beatles, and can never seem to get enough, get yourself the real thing in its original form.  If you appreciate show tunes, get yourself show tunes.  Love is a mixture of both, and in my opinion fails at both.  I never thought I'd think it, let alone express it, but this is a blatant attempt to exploit Beatle music in order to make a few more bucks.  As a collection of bits and pieces of Beatles music that was perfect in the original, but remixed here to give it a new look, it fails miserably.  Do what you want, but given a second chance, I would avoid it.

B00001ZULV|4.0|It's true, if a band stays together it will change, and sometimes become something different. Genesis changed quite a bit from the Peter Gabriel, Steve Hackett days, but then it had also changed from the Ant Phillips <br />days as well. And. let's not forget that Phil Collins was not an original member of Genesis. He was a very talented drummer and singer who auditioned for the band and was accepted into the fold somewhere around 1970, roughly the same time Steve Hackett joined (unless I'm mistaken). <br />What I'm trying to say is that a band will undergo several changes as the years progress and with every change they will lose fans and gain fans. This is what happened to Genesis. There's nothing wrong with the Abacab, Invisible Touch version of Genesis any more than fans of that era thinking the Lamb lies down on Broadway, I know what I Like version of Genesis is weird and unapproachable. This is a good CD. It's a good representation of the more commercial, but still very  very good version of Genesis, with a bit of the Gabriel, Hackett version thrown in for good measure.  <br />Bands change, it's natural.

B000001ELP|5.0|I truly wish that there had been more albums from KISS that fit this genre of rock. This is the most progressive rock you'll ever see from KISS.  I particularly love \\"Only You,\\" \\"World Without Heroes,\\" \\"Under the Rose.\\"  Those songs are a blast.  Honestly the album is a blast from beginning to end.  And Eric Carr was a REAL breath of fresh air after enduring the mundane and junior-high style of Peter Criss!! Some people don't realize that Criss's drumming was so poor that he was replaced as drummer with sessionists on \\"Dynasty.\\" Also, a great deal of this album did NOT have Ace Freheley's guitar work, which is fine with me. I like Vinnie Vincent and Bruce Kulick's work far better anyway. Ace and Peter were not great musicians.   <br />Bob Ezrin DID bring a progressive rock sound to this group that sounded like Yes, Rush, or Floyd. It's sad that KISS fans were so quick to reject a \\"Lord of the Rings\\" kind of adventure album full of mystery and adventure in favor of wanting KISS to return to \\"T&A\\" themes. KISS sang about the ladies room, chicks, back seats of cars, ladies, chicks and more chicks for years! This album, in my opinion, showed they were NOT softcore glam rockers. They could keep up with the best of 'em! After this album came \\"Creatures,\\" which had a few good songs but after that.....the 80's is a long decade of more sex songs and rehash.  Go buy this album, especially if you like fantasy genre like \\"Lord of the Rings,\\" \\"The Hobbit,\\" \\"Excalibur,\\" etc. Fun stuff and musically sound!!
B000068OCS|5.0|Well, it's not really stock footage, you people who call it that. The NASA and military footage of course is, but most of the film was filmed by that guy who filmed the film. DUH! First time I had the experience was in 1998 in a theatre at the art gallery, and they used a movie projector and film to show it! It... Was... EPIC (btw I wasn't using any chemical enhancement). Sort of like a psychedelic experience in that it was epic and heavy. Reality 101. It didn't show me anything I didn't already know, but still it was heavy and felt important (don't laugh when i use the term \\"heavy\\"). I think the cars and people are sped up to show the magnitude of their numbers, and the worker-bee-type quality of it all, not to make them seem chaotic in comparison to the calm nature scenes. Rent this movie and see where the journey takes you, even if it is to the stop/eject buttons.
B00005IC2H|5.0|Not long after buying this CD I realised I'd be playing it so often it would wear out, so I went out and bought a spare copy. \\"Agaetis byrjun\\" means \\"A good beginning\\" in Icelandic but the words might as well translate as \\"A mind-bending masterpiece few will ever even be able to dream of emulating\\". The title track always provokes a few tears, no matter how many times I hear it, and several other pieces on this quite hypnotising album are in my all-time Top 10. To my mind this is by far their best work: I thought little of () and Takk was frankly mediocre. I went to see the band a year ago in concert and they were dreadful, but that did not dent my feelings for \\"Agaetis byrjun\\". This music walks through my soul.
B000IU3XTM|4.0|I must say that I miss some of Damien Rice's hissing anger that burst forth from a whisper that was featured prominently on the album O. This album replaces that calous anger with a dark bleakness. Where O was put together beautifully and carefully, some songs on 9 seem as though they were put together in a dash, which is odd for an album which took so long to come out. I have been very satisfied with the album as a whole and for a sophomore effort Rice has produced a solid album.

B000ANVQ0K|5.0|In Titanic, not only has James Cameron created a masterpiece of cinema, he has shown us the magic of love that can strike like a bolt of lightning. <br /> <br />Those who dismiss the romance of Jack and Rose as completely implausible have themselves never had the glorious experience. <br /> <br />I have.   <br /> <br />I saw the love of my life across a crowded room, fell swiftly and madly in love with her and married her more than 35 years ago. <br /> <br />The love of Jack and Rose is rare but it certainly does exist and James Cameron has given us a look at that rare gem. <br /> <br />There is none so blind as him who will not see.  <br /> <br />I found it hard to fathom how people could find this movie awful when it is so clearly a masterpiece.  Then, I remember, the master's art is judged by all the cynicism or joy WE bring to the moment we experience the art before us.  It is our own baggage that drags us down. <br /> <br />If we do not have the experience or the hope of a deep and abiding love, we can never believe one could exist. <br /> <br />There is a reason Titanic is the most successful movie ever made.  It has deeply touched millions.  They have the capacity to deeply love and experience what Jack and Rose felt. <br /> <br />I sincerely appreciate James Cameron's creation of this masterpiece. <br /> <br />This movie is not so much about the end of a ship as it is about everlasting love. <br /> <br />Titanic is not about how suddenly and tragically you could die.   Titanic is about how fully you could live. <br /> <br />Cameron shows us one day of true love might be a priceless gift to treasure for a lifetime.
B000K7VHQ4|5.0|The Illusionist has to be one of the most underrated movies of the year. I hadn't heard very much hype about it and the trailer didn't really send me running out to see it, but after watching it, I think it was one of the best movies of 2006.<br /><br />Edward Norton, Paul Giamatti, Rufus Sewell, and even Jessica Biel all turned in remarkable performances throughout the film. The entire supporting cast steps up as well. The cinematography was equally stunning, as was the story, which stays intriguing until the very last frame.<br /><br />The Illusionist is a romantic drama, a thriller, a mystery, and a period piece all in one, and it never leans too heavily on any of the genres in order to skate by. It lives in all these realms, but it also lives in its own independent category.<br /><br />The special features on the DVD were pretty meager: a making of featurette, and then a \\"Jessica Biel on the Illusionist\\" featurette that was really just the same comments she made in the making of featurette edited down to a shorter version. The film itself is so amazing that the DVD doesn't really need any extras, although it would be nice to get a more in depth look at Edward Norton's preperation for the role, and the magicians that trained him.
020161622X|5.0|If you want to develop a sound practice when developing, this book may be worth your while.
0316172324|5.0|Reminds me of Cialdini's book, Influence.  Easy read, entertaining and enlightening.  I found it more interesting than The Tipping Point.
0743298020|5.0|I love books, and I truly love books about books. I did not read this so much as a Ghost Story - although there is that element in the book - but more as a wonderful book about the wonders of creating and telling stories. Here we have a book, that tells the story of a woman who grows up selling books and is engaged to create a book (biography, perhaps) about the life of another woman who writes books of fiction. Within the main book, we have the appearance of other books - Hester's diary for example - and the self referential nature of the work just keeps asserting itself. <br /> <br />In an author less skilled, this could rapidly fall into the realm of an academic exercise. But Dianne Sutterfield writes a gripping novel that spins a tale - several tales actually - that thoroughly engages you from start to finish. While plenty of references to Jane Eyre abound, my favorite literary moment is when the doctor prescribes 10 pages of Sherlock Holmes, twice a day, as a cure for Margaret's over wrought sensibilities. If only such a doctor existed outside the realm of fiction. <br /> <br />Well written, more that just a story - rather a piece of literature that you can read on many levels - I strongly recommend this book and eagerly await Ms. Sutterfield's next book. <br /> <br />
B000LC55F2|4.0|My view about any artistic endeavor is that every individual will view it from their own perspective and make their own decision about how worthy it is unless your middle initial happens to be \\"W\\".  Bottom line, I liked it, I was entertained and yes the hats kinda give you an idea of what is going on but that makes you feel good so all in all the film was worth seeing.  I learned something from the film too and that is always handy.
B0006213WG|4.0|This is overall Sum41's best album. It has a nice mix of slow tracks the best of which are Some Say and Pieces. This album, however, is a lot different than their previous albums; these guys are no longer the sarcastic punks they were in All Killer and Does This Look Infected. This music is much more serious and mature. Another plus is that none of the songs seem just thrown together. I remember listening to All Killer No Filler and thinking \\"Great hook, but where'd that other part come from?\\" Every part of each song goes together to make a great song which makes a great album. There is also no one song that is really that much better than the others, although No Reason is probably my favorite. Overall, buy this album, it's a lot better value than their other albums. <br /> <br />P.S. <br />Although this is their best overall album, The Hell Song and Fat Lip are still my favorites! :)
B000002L9W|5.0|This was a gift for my sondd, he absolutely LOVES it. David Lee Roth never fails to deliver.
B00005JPCA|5.0|I will agree with the other reviewer and say that this is the most human Bond.  Shows emotion, pain and joy.  Daniel Craig made Bond more real and more approachable.  You can actually feel with him what he goes through.  Amazing!  And as a woman I would like to add WOW and more WOW!  He is the sexiest Bond ever!
B000I5Y8ZU|3.0|Sounds too mainstream like those sellouts in Green Day.  Maybe it will grow on me.  Revenge and Bullets are better....cult classical music.  YOu cant raise a cult on this album.   But i doubt if MCR cares; they only went platinum once with the last album.  People have to remember that there's 5 poeple in he group.  SPlittin the profits from only platinum among 5 is like gettin nothin.  They want to make an album to get attention like American Idiot.
0307237699|5.0|Excellent book!  Very enjoyable reading.  Provides a lot of insight into who Barack Obama is and what he believes.
B000GY729M|5.0|I wasn't sure that The Killers could top their debut release, but they have. Sam's Town is one great album--and Brandon Flowers has plenty of reason to be so smug about it. I could listen to this cd and sing along to every song within a couple of listens...it is very catchy like that..just floooows. The tracks \\"This River is Wild\\" and \\" When You Were Young\\" are my favorites, but that is like trying to nail down which puppy in a litter you like best--you just can't choose. If you think you even kinda maybe like The Killers, buy this album and it will have you preaching to the choir.
B00004RHZU|4.0|i heard all the stuff that pink has done since lady marmalade and i was curious about this album. <br />First of all, i was prepared for hear some r&b stuff but i was really suprised with this album. <br />I'm not a r&b fan, i'm a pop fan but pink makes something special with this rythms... she demostrates once more that she rocks for real!
B000EMGAOY|5.0|You know when people tell you not to judge a CD on the first time you listen to it? To hear it a few times, let it sink in or grow on you before you pass judgement? In some cases it might be true...but it seems ridiculous to me to actually go through steps to make yourself like a CD. You won't have to with Stadium Arcadium! Right out of the chute this CD rocks with excellent hooks and lyrics you can't wait to learn and sing a long to! You will be rolling with this music immediately!<br /><br />I know, it's a bit intimidating to by a 2-CD set and wonder how many of the songs will be worth the price. Have no fear...I won't say I love EVERY song on this CD (In fact, I skip past three out of the 28) but the rest make up for that in spades. Want something you can enjoy immediately? Get this CD without hesitation.  A solid rocker with so much to offer!
B000FTWB7G|5.0|I have \\"Fallen\\", the band's debut album.  This album rocks just as much.  It is everything I hoped for.
B000FVQYYK|5.0|Love them! I discovered them a couple of years ago while I was downloading music from kazaa and limewire and have bought all of their albums! You wont regret buying this!
B000084T18|5.0|THIS IS 50CENTS BEST WORK IF YOU ASK ME! HOW CAN ANYBODY FRONT LIKE ITS NOT TRUE! THIS CD SHOWED 50 IN THE PRIME OF HIS CAREER!
B00005JPDP|3.0|I loved Patrick Suskind's novel Perfume immensely; I still remember the impact the imaginative and macabre story had on me: an 18th-century French orphan, born without a scent (and by implication without a soul) trains himself in the art of perfume-making, with the intent of creating a perfume from the bodies of murdered virgins (with a prostitute thrown in, presumably, for the \\"base note,\\"). <br /> <br />Up to about the 2-hour mark, this filmed version of the novel did a truly magnificent job of bringing the novel to life.  I particularly loved Ben Whishaw, who played the bizarre lead character, Jean-Baptiste Grenouille (Grenouille meaning \\"frog\\" in French), with a gangly, splay-footed, frog-like gait, gargantuan amphibious eyes, and a remarkable ability to convey his feelings (or lack of them) through those eyes.  Grenouille' sinister sence of smell allows him to catch up with even the finest, most exquisitely beautitful young lady in the province of Grasse, to complete his perfume. <br /> <br />And then, at the two-hour mark things, get very VERY silly; almost Monty-Python silly.  At the moment when Grenouille is sure to hang for his crimes, he applies a bit of his finished perfume; not only is everyone immediately certain that a man who smells like that must be innocent of all crime, but every ONE of the hundreds of peasants standing around waiting for a good crucifixion/hanging is suddenly compelled to a) strip off all clothes and b) attack the nearest naked body regardless of age gender or whatever. <br /> <br />I have to say this is the first time in many decades of filmgoing I have seen an audience laugh OUT LOUD at a scene meant to be moving and dramatic.  It did not offend me, but it made the end of the movie goofy and laughable. <br /> <br />I assume that the director was going for moving and horrific, but he got goofy and laughable instead.  If you'd like to end the evening slapping your knees at hundreds of writhing naked Frenchman, though, this is thefilm for you.  5 stars for the first 2/3s and 1 star for the end. <br />
B00005ASHM|2.0|I've listened to this album a number of times - I own this album. It's not bad, but it's not that good either. I simply don't understand why it's raved as one of the best albums of all time because it's so outdated. It's so cheesey and it gets boring. The songs are fun and poppy, but really get thin after a few listens. Why does it get such high reviews? It is important historically, but I sincerely believe that the legend is far too inflated for such a bland bit of 60s pop.     I guess I'm unimpressed by Brian Wilson.
0307346609|4.0|World War Z: An Oral History of the Zombie War; By Max Brooks<br /><br />ISBN: 0-307-34660-9<br /><br />The end was near...<br /><br /> \\"But the boy jerked again and I heard his left arm snap.  Jagged ends of both radius and ulna bones stabbed through his gray flesh.  The boy didn't cry out, didn't seem to notice...\\" Ranging now from the infamous village of New Dachang in the United Federation of China, where the epidemiological trial began with the 12 years old Patient Zero, to the unnamed northern forests where untold numbers sought a terrible and temporary refuge in the cold, to the United States of Southern Africa, where the Redecker Plan provided hope for humanity at an unspeakable price, to the west-of-the-Rockies redoubt where the North American tide finally started to turn, this invaluable chronic reflects the full scope and  direction of the Zombie War.  This book is fiction but when you read it, it sounds like the truth.<br /><br /> The book stood out of the shelves and I have the survival guide, that I gotten and had a preview of this book: World War Z.  I do recommend this book.  It has gore, true stories from people who survived or witnessed this horror... the Walking Dead.  The people who would like this book age between 14-40 years old and the type people would be people who like Zombie horror films (very few).  It was a page-turner because seeing how the hosts lived through the outbreaks and seeing what they had to say about their story and how the y lived through the outbreaks.  It was NOT boring at all because there would have been 56 stories and their plots or meaning.  My mind went wandering like crazy but never off the subject.  It happens every time at the end of the hosts' story goes wondering what would I do in their place.
B000HBK3MM|4.0|Corinne is way better than Snorah--er, I mean Norah--Jones. Great debut from a great vocalist. Check her out!
B00005JKHN|5.0|I was probably about three years old, when I first saw Walt Disney's SLEEPING BEAUTY in the movie theater.  It was re-released in the mid-1980s, and, no doubt, many of us Generation Yers, as well as people who were children when it was first released, a good thirty decades before, will recall just how beautiful a film it truly is.  For starters, the use of color to tell this oft-told tale, with great attention to detail.  Particularly, I recall the scenes that take place in the forest, when the beautiful Princess Aurora, who carries a curse on her head, bestowed on her by the evil and vindictive Malificent, is hiding away with her fairy godmothers, Flora, Fauna and Merriweather.  It's so green in these sequences that I can almost smell the earth.  What's more, Princess Aurora is drop-dead gorgeous.  It's easy to see why the jealous Malificent cursed the blonde-haired beauty at her christening.  [Yes, though most of you probably know about the plot already, for those of you who aren't familiar with it.  Aurora's curse is that, before sunset on her sixteenth birthday, she will fatally prick her finger on a spindle.]  What's more, the music is just beautiful.  For those of you familiar with the original score, by Tchaikovsky, you won't be disappointed.
B000A0GP4K|5.0|Scorcese hits a home run with this Dylan documentary. I can watch this over and over and over again. It's phenomenal.
B000JJSJR8|5.0|Obviously a great movie, but the HD DVD is very well done.  Excellent film transfer really shows off increased resolution.
B000GG4KTU|3.0|Maybe I just can't get into the \\"big\\" Diana Krall sound. When she was playing with her trio on her early albums, I absolutely loved her. Now, with all the horns and strings...not so much. Or maybe I'm just subconciously mad at her for marrying Elvis Costello instead of me. And having his twins instead of mine. In any case...Stepping Out and her tribute to Nat \\"King\\" Cole remain my favorite albums of hers. Ms. Krall: Less = More.
B000006MVD|4.0|I've owned this CD for quite some time, and despite a lot of fans of the movie and Klaus Doldinger/Giorgio Moroder fans accurately stating that the orchestral version of \\"Ivory Tower\\" can't be found, I would say this is still worth your money.  While it's true that some of the songs have been re-orchestrated with more synthesizers, most of the centerpieces of this soundtrack remain intact and are well worth the money for the nostalgia and pristine pop orchestra sound alone.  The main attraction is \\"Bastian's Happy Flight\\" which is 3:16 in length and is THE theme in full that you hear in The Never Ending Story with lots of flourishing French Horns and sweeping strings.  \\"Happy Flight\\" is simply the reprise of that same theme, it's the track that you hear at the end of the film when Bastian rides Falcor and scares off those bullies.  <br /> <br />Other highlights on this CD are the tracks \\"Atreju meets Falcor\\" (which is the softly lilting string melody that you hear when Atreju first rides Falcor as he continues his quest), \\"Atreju's Quest\\" (which is the song that plays when Atreju enters the Princess' tower to take on the quest to find the human child), \\"The Auryn\\" (which is the vocal choir theme when Atreju enters the Princess' chambers at the end to tell her he failed in his quest).   <br /> <br />Unfortunately, the \\"Ivory Tower\\" track that all of the nay-sayers are complaining about cannot be found at all - not on this soundtrack or the German-titled version called \\"Die Unendliche Geschichte\\".  It looks like fans will have to settle for listening to it off of their DVD.   <br /> <br />It's worth noting that this soundtrack was conceived of by two composers:  Klaus Doldinger (German and classically trained saxophonist and jazz musician and composer) and Giorgio Moroder (Italian record producer and father of 70's and 80's emergence of electronic music).  This is why you have a dichotomy and sometimes a fusion of orchestral and synthesized sounds in this soundtrack.It's quite easy to see how some tracks ended up being the Doldinger orchestral version and some ended up being Moroder versions when you have two people's vision being thrown into the mix together.  <br /> <br />Perhaps someday Doldinger and Moroder and the record execs will see fit to release a more comprehensive version of this soundtrack including \\"The Ivory Tower\\" film version track that many people desire... but until that time, this soundtrack is a good buy.
B000FQJAIW|5.0|This movie had such an impact, it literally re-invented the sci-fi genre.  A modern-day classic, with a great story and ground-breaking effects (at the time).  I'm really glad it includes the original version - it brings back fond memories of my high school & college days!
B000I5X81K|5.0|I have listened to nothing but this CD straight since I got it.  <br /> <br />Josh Groban's wonderful engery and soaring sound are back and better than ever. The first 10 tracks are similar to his previous work, but he has a much more hands-on, involved approach on this album. It's really nice to know that he's not just a pretty, trained voice, but that there is his own real musical talent pumping through this CD. He sings every song with such unrivaled passion. \\"Awake\\" certainly keeps up the great tradition of his past albums while also adding some new flavors.    <br /> <br />\\"You are loved\\" is the single. It's classic and inspiring, but the real jewel on this disk is \\"In her eyes.\\" It flies into your ears and into your heart. The last three songs, in which he collaborates with others are pretty different from usual Josh. At first they were surprising, but with time, and taking into account that they are different, they are actually some pretty good songs. Though, the political overtones of \\"Weeping\\" could hardly be more obvious. My only problem is that there are so many collaborations. One or two is cool, but three is pushing it. \\"Machine,\\" actually turns out pretty well.  <br /> <br />Overall though, this CD could easily replace my 1000+ song mp3 library, and I would be perfectly happy.
