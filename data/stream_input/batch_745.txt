B000VWYNNW|5.0|The Song Remains the Same couldn't be better. The sound is awesome. There are effects that have never been heard before. This is the closest to how  it probably sounded in Madison Square Garden. Flare sound from the drums.  The sound effects orchestrated by Jimmy Page during \\"Dazed And Confused\\"  & \\"Whole Lotta Love\\" is spectacular. A must have.  Simply it could not be better.  I also recommend \\"The Song Remains The Same\\" 2-disc DVD Set.

0440237688|3.0|Lois Lowry really took on very profound subject matter to write about, especially to make it YA fiction.  I applaud her for it.  This novel was rather good because it makes the young reader stop and self-examine.  I will spare you a summary of the book.  You can find that in many other reviews.<br />I like that this novel's audience is supposed to be 8-14.  I think that children at this age are capable of handling the difficult subject matter and should be exposed to books that can really challenge them.  When it comes to the severity of the material (particularly chapter 19), it's just a drastic point to convey to the reader:  If we live in a world without feeling nor true emotion and are bound by unquestioning rigidity, we are capable of doing ANYTHING without heart nor conscience.  As a mother I can understand why a parent would be hesitant to expose a child to the material, but as a book lover, I wouldn't keep this book away from them.<br />  When it comes to the \\"sci-fi\\" realm of this novel, I found that there were alot of unanswered questions regarding the society and the world they live in (I often feel this way when I read sci-fi though) so I didn't find it a feasible community.  She uses \\"genetic testing\\" alot to explain why things are the way they are, and I found that an easy excuse to not have to tie up loose ends or answer any questions .  Not very creative.  It's impossible to imagine a society could be created this way successfully.<br />  As for the subject of the whole novel, I felt that her point was rather, er, subjective.  She says that a world without feeling isn't worth living at all.  Now is it, really?  Of course someone who has experienced joys (from the most simple to the most complex) in their life would agree.  What about someone who's had a miserable life?  I'm sure they would rather live in a bland, rigid, yet reliable world than deal with pain and misery.  That's how Rosemary dealt with it.  She'd rather not live than deal with pain and suffering; in fact, it trumped the joys she experienced.  But if we're going to speak generally, of course the cliche \\"It's better to have loved and lost, than to have never loved at all.\\" would fare well.<br />As for the ambiguous ending, I do not enjoy these.  I think it's a lazy way of coming off as profound.ing; in fact, it trumped the joys she experienced.  But if we're going to speak generally, of course the cliche \\"It's better to have loved and lost, than to have never loved at all.\\" would fare well.

0684833395|5.0|Joseph Heller, who was an American bombardier in WWII, tells the story of a character in the same situation, John Yossarian, in his historical, satirical novel, Catch-22.  The title refers to a military rule in the book in which circular logic is employed to keep air-men flying their missions, despite their best efforts to avoid them.  It illustrates perfectly the message of the story: war is insane, and inane bureaucratic operation sustains it.    I began reading the novel with optimistic expectations, mainly from the critical acclaim it has received over the decades, but also because the title's concept seemed a clever premise for a novel.  However, as I read chapter after chapter I became disheartened.  The jokes were not funny, they made no sense, and the characters rambled on insanely about seemingly unimportant topics.  By about page 100 I was seriously considering moving on to something else, but then a colleague of mine saw it in my hand and said, \\"Catch-22, great novel, isn't it?\\"  This guy was highly-educated and a veteran educator - was I missing something?  \\"Actually,\\" I replied, \\"I'm not really getting into this one.\\"  He smiled and nodded knowingly: \\"It took me five tries to finish it.  The first hundred pages are tough, but once you get over that stretch it's really worth it.\\"  Taking him at his word I trudged on, and I am deeply grateful I did.  He was correct, as the story gradually began to come together brilliantly and by the end I decided that it was perhaps one of the most solid and intelligent novels that I have yet read.    There were reasons for my troubles, and I fear that many give up with a sour impression of the book due to them.  The novel is told from differing points of view, and the story is nonlinear.  Events are told repeatedly by different people, often out of sequence, and are revealed more and more in their entirety each time further details are offered.  This results in the completion of a set-up to a joke whose punch-line has already been told.  It allows the reader to laugh at and understand later a situation which previously seemed frivolous and unfunny.  It also changes one's perspective of characters that at first seemed insane, but are later found to be the sanest.    Catch-22 offers many instances of poignant insight and telling observations.  One of the most relevant to our own time involves a conversation between the American character Nately and an elderly Italian man:     \\"You put so much stock in winning wars,\\" the grubby iniquitous old man scoffed.  \\"The real trick lies in losing wars, in knowing which wars can be lost.  Italy has been losing wars for centuries,  and just see how splendidly we've done nonetheless.  France wins wars and is in a continual  state of crisis.  Germany loses and prospers.\\" (Heller 255)    And later...     \\"There is nothing so absurd about risking your life for your country,\\" he [Nately] declared.   \\"Isn't there?\\" asked the old man.  \\"What is a country?  A country is a piece of land surrounded on all sides by boundaries, usually unnatural.  Englishmen are dying for England, Americans are dying for America, Germans are dying for Germany, Russians are dying for Russia.  There are now fifty or sixty countries fighting in this war.  Surely so many countries can't be worth dying for.\\"   \\"Anything worth living for,\\" said Nately, \\"is worth dying for.\\"   \\"And anything worth dying for,\\" answered the sacrilegious old man, \\"is certainly worth living for... How old are you?  Twenty-five?  Twenty-six?\\"   \\"Nineteen,\\" said Nately, \\"I'll be twenty in January.\\"   \\"If you live.\\" (Heller 257)    Despite what justifications can be made for war, how else can war look to one who witnesses the carnage first-hand but to be absolutely without reason?  And though certain wars may be just, certainly not all battles are.  This is the experience of Yossarian.    The novel contains the heart-breaking reality of war coupled with the zaniness of people on the brink of sanity's edge.  It is real enough to be relevant, but surreal enough for the reader to laugh and enjoy without qualms of conscience.  For those who have been inhibited by the confusion of the first hundred pages of the book, I beg you to return once more for the long haul.  The journey is well-worth it.

0060507772|5.0|I loved this book!  The story was great fun (as are all of the Discworld stories) and quick to read.  I believe the story is particularly interesting as it brings together several characters who have not yet interacted in any of the Discworld novels (Rincewind, Leonard of Quirm, and Carrot work together for example) and introduces some great new characters as well.  The premise of the story is quite amusing - any book with Cohen the Barbarian is bound to be entertaining.  However, I would not have liked this book nearly so much without the illustrations.  I really love the illustrations.  Some of the characters of course don't look anything like I imagine them looking, but several of them are spot on.  I'm particularly fond of the images of The Librarian and Mad Hamish, both of whom look adorably insane in their portraits.  This book is completely worth the price because it effectively combines two books into one - The Last Hero and The Art of Discworld.  I would wholeheartedly recommend it to any Discworld fan.

B00006AVRK|5.0|Everyone knows that the story-lines, writing and humor of P.G.Wodehouse are top shelf, but Stephen Fry and Hugh Laurie have created the definitive Jeeves and Wooster.  Beyond their 3-dimensional acting abilities, their timing and chemistry are honed to perfection from their years as a comedy team (and as part of the Black Adder series among other projects).    While I absolutely love the series of four seasons, it is clear that cast and screenplay changes in the 2nd and especially 3rd seasons are somewhat weaker.  However, the overall series makes it well worth it.    Jeeves and Wooster is verbal slapstick (little overt physical comedy here), so if you like British comedy, this is a must.

B00005JPXY|2.0|This is by far the most over-hyped movie I've seen ever. No wonder they made this movie mysterious in the beginning of last year. There's no real story here. I thought this movie was going to be a spin off of Lost series after the SWAN hatch imploded at the end of season 2 possibly releasing a part of the \\"Black Smoke Monster\\". A lot of other Lost fans thought so also. But I highly doubt that. It's just another re-hashed monster flick where some giant creature trashes Manhattan Island. Instead of the perspective of Army and Marine grunts, Air Force pilots, and scientists, it takes the perspective of a bunch of young yuppie New Yorkers as they try to survive the monster and fight off it's bug like minions They're probably like remoras on sharks or small birds on rhinos. We don't get an explanation of what the monster is or what its little bug looking minions are doing when they bite someone. The monster doesn't even look like the old Japanese Godzilla or the new American Godzilla from 1998. It's not H.P. Lovecraft's Call of Cthulhu or Voltron. Everyone has seen this type Monster movie before. There's nothing new in this film. It'll probably end up in the Svengoolie show on Saturday night. So don't waste your money on this movie in the weekend. In the later half of the movie after we discover that it was indeed a monster, I was rooting for it to eat the people up, bite their heads off, and tear up the L-trains and subway trains like King Kong and eat the transit riders up like a bag of Jelly Beans and M&Ms. The ending was very ridiculous. At least Beth and her ex-boyfriend should have survived and live happily ever after. The title was also corny. I thought \\"Cloverfield\\" was the code word for the movie not the actual title. They should have came up with a better title like \\"Escape from New York part 2\\", \\"Mars Attack 2: their pet left behind\\", or \\"It Came from the Sewers\\".

B000WLIEKK|5.0|This band is Creed minus Scott Stapp, replaced with Myles Kennedy. I wasn't much into Creed, though I own their greatest hits CD and for me it is a very good collection of very good rock songs. I can hear remnants of Creed in this music but the band has grown pretty far away from those days and gotten heavier.<br /><br />I've just played through this new Alter Bridge release once and I am blown away. This is first rate songwriting, musicianship, and production in what I consider a straight up AMERICAN HARD ROCK genre. Myles blows away Scott as a lead singer on any level I could consider. Myles' voice may bring a tear to your eye, and his voice has that quality of \\"ringing\\" true on many notes. This music forces me to listen.<br /><br />These songs are very melodic and complex, with shredding metal riffs and crunching bridges aplenty. Mark's guitar playing has never been better IMO. For some reason this album makes me feel proud to be an American music consumer. I can't say why except I feel that their style and sound strikes hard as American. Maybe that's why the pro wrestling franchise WWE likes to use this music too.

B00005JPXY|3.0|Cloverfield (2008) - Matt Reeves    Going into the movie, I was not expecting anything out of the ordinary, which is ridiculous in itself considering the movie is anything but ordinary in its conception.  Actually, to be more specific, the plot itself is extremely banal, and I could honestly care less for most of the characters.  What is in fact most unique about the film, and by far its most interesting \\"character\\", is the hand held camera.  By basically viewing the action through the eyes of the holder of the camera for the duration of the film, the audience literally becomes a part of the action.  In fact, ideally, we feel everything the characters feel: their fears, hopes, excitement, etc.  However, unfortunately, the film has a few major flaws that, I feel, prevent it from achieving the status of a truly great movie.  Instead, it ends up becoming an extremely interesting diversion.      First of all, and this is the problem with a lot of movies that are extremely \\"gimmicky\\", the gimmick is TOO much the focus.  In other words, developments in the plot happen not due to character, which is how it should be, but seemingly only for the sake of coolness.  What ends up happening is the plot and characters end up feeling contrived, cliche, and even relatively light.  And when I say \\"for the sake of coolness\\", I mean that when a specific plot point occurs, what I feel is happening in the director's mind is \\"Oh, it would be cool to have the characters do this, so that the audience can experience this, too.\\"  The problem with that concept is that in its execution, a lot of the plot points end up inevitably weak, at least in the context of the film.  For example, Rob saving Beth is relatively ridiculous because as an audience member, you never feel that they truly loved each other in the first place.  In other words, the only reason to have Rob save her, and to have Hud (the holder of the camera) follow, is to lengthen the effect of the gimmick, which is an obvious tacticbecause the film is relatively short in duration.  Therefore, what ends up ultimately happening is that Cloverfield, instead of being a truly great film, ends up being a lesser film filled with great moments.  And yes, it has a few truly great moments.  I refer specifically to the first sequence that starts with the explosion that the characters witness from the balcony and ends with the flying head of the Statue of Liberty.  The helicopter flight to escape the city is an example of another fantastic sequence.      So, overall, the movie is definitely a worthwhile watch, and I recommend it without hesitation.  Just do not expect anything more than a visceral thrill ride, and you will be fine.  Oh, and do beware that the camera movement can be extremely jarring and potentially nauseating.  One of my friends actually had to leave the theatre because he began to feel extremely sick.

B000002P7R|4.0|Rarities, and good ones at that .Basically, this music proves that, if you strip away the distortion, the feedback, the burning guitars, and the onstage stunts, Jimi could've easily made a career as a pure blues guitarist. The album's horn-powered instrumental title song is a fine example; as is \\"Here He Comes (Lover Man)\\", taken at a blistering pace and equipped with a classic guitar solo; studio versions of \\"Power of Soul\\" and \\"Message to Love\\" are among Jimi's most fascinating and underrated tracks, with him eschewing his signature distortion almost entirely and still doing some of his best work. That's another thing this album proves - Jimi's technique was remarkable. It wasn't all smoke and mirrors. There's even an Elmore James cover, \\"Bleeding Heart\\" - how hardcore is that? I do think bits of this are unneeded, though. For instance, \\"Tax Free\\" is just Jimi soloing for five minutes against an inconsistent backdrop that actually uses a Doors tune, \\"Five to One\\", as the basis for one part's rhythm. There's nothing wrong with the playing, of course, but given the song's lack of a melody or even theme I get the feeling that nobody intended to release it. Instead, I think Jimi and a few friends sat down, got really high, and just played stuff. It could've worked as the basis for a song, for sure. But as an independent tune? No. The other guitar solos, \\"Midnight\\" (with a slightly distorted blues riff) and the funky \\"Pali Gap\\", are much better. But I'm not a great fan of the avant-garde \\"Stars that Play with Laughing Sam's Dice\\". It's a great title, but a dated song. It was only issued as a b-side - the flip, \\"All Along the Watchtower\\", is only available in its single mix, and while it's not terribly different from the well-known album version, that's okay because it's still \\"All Along the Watchtower\\", if you get what I mean. That said, I don't see why they included it. Anyway, for those interested there are also a couple demos - a good instrumental take of \\"Little Wing\\", and a bizarre \\"Angel\\", which starts halfway through the first verse and contains none of the gorgeous psychedelic guitar of the more well-known First Rays version. To my ears, the best track is the Delta blues of \\"Midnight Lightning\\", little more than Hendrix and an electric guitar, and it's one of his best guitar performances, too. This is only really of interest to the big fans, like me, but if you are a big fan and you've touched on all the essentials, this is a nice follow-up buy.ng\\", and a bizarre \\"Angel\\", which starts halfway through the first verse and contains none of the gorgeous psychedelic guitar of the more well-known First Rays version.

B000VI6T6K|4.0|This is among Jimi's most famous live performances. For one, it was his first with the Experience. For another, it was recorded at the legendary Monterey Pop Festival - I've heard bits of the boxed set, and I really liked the performances by Janis Joplin, the Who, Otis Redding and Booker T & the M.G.'s, so I'm hoping they all get separate releases too, though because all of their performances were so short (indeed, Hendrix was the only artist who got an even remotely long set), that's not likely. Anyway, there are three chief reasons why every Hendrix fan should have this now that it's out, and they're all covers that you really can't find anywhere else with Hendrix: \\"Like a Rolling Stone\\" is a real find, both for Hendrix's organ-imitating guitar and Mitch Mitchell's drumming; the high-energy opener \\"Killing Floor\\" is my favorite version of that song; \\"Rock Me Baby\\" is pretty much \\"Lover Man\\" with B.B. King's original lyrics, but \\"Lover Man\\" is such a good song that's no reason to complain. By the way, it's interesting that Jimi had the arrangement for \\"Lover Man\\" down pat since the start of his career, but never actually put it out. That's kind of sad, really, because it's a hell of a blues tune. I'm all for a stellar \\"Hey Joe\\", and that's what this offers; there's also a hell-raising \\"Can You See Me?\\" that easily outstrips the studio version. And listen to this version of \\"Purple Haze\\" for some spectacular drumming. And those spoken asides Jimi adds between songs are quirky and humorous, particularly the one about Bob Dylan's grandmother before \\"Like a Rolling Stone\\". Most the rest is pretty good, though nothing fantastic: \\"Foxey Lady\\" is always a good listen, but here it's perfunctory; and while \\"The Wind Cries Mary\\" is a big step down from its studio cousin, the guitar passage is still my favorite of all Hendrix's solos. \\"Wild Thing\\" starts off decently, but here's a comment on the legendary \\"Guitar-burning\\" - it probably was something impressive to see, but it's also something almost impossible to listen to. This is arguably his best live album, and it certainly reaches higher heights than all the others, except for that Band of Gypsys version of \\"Machine Gun\\", of course.s also something almost impossible to listen to.

B000002UR7|5.0|Radiohead's debut \\"Pablo Honey\\" may seem a bit rough around the edges after your first listen to it. It's not as smooth or as southing as their later albums. But if you take the album as it is, it is truly a masterpiece. From the angsty, beautiful \\"You\\" to the inspiring, experimental finale \\"Blow Out\\", the album never lets up. In the midst of a self esteem crisis, Thom Yorke crafted together many songs about how we all feel at least once in our lives, unsure and hating who we are. Every song has something special in store.     From \\"Pablo Honey\\", Radiohead started evolving into the experimental band they are today that hates the music industry. Thanks to this album's offering, \\"Creep\\" and it's commercial success, the band may not be where they are today. This album changed the course of Radiohead's career.     Highlights:  1)\\"You\\"-A beautiful song about a guy who is obsessed with a girl and he believes she is the \\"sun and moon and stars\\". Has guitar work that resembles later albums. It is epic when Thom Yorke holds a note throughout the entire bridge.   2)\\"Creep\\"-This is the song that is the reason why Radiohead is what they are today. A song that tells a sad story about a guy who deeply loves a girl and thinks she is the greatest thing on earth, but doesn't have enough self confidence to tell her how he feels. When he does though, she runs away. A very very depressing song that any guy can relate to at some point of your life. The bridge is one of the most emotional moments in Radiohead's career as Thom Yorke bursts out \\"She's running out again\\" in a beautiful falsetto. An absolutely amazing piece of music that's very special to me and many other angsty teens.  5)\\"Thinking About You\\"-This is hands down the most beautiful, heartfelt ballad Radiohead has ever written. It is about a guy who lost a girl to fame. He still loves her but she doesn't care anymore about him because she's onto bigger better things. Another very emotional offering that is essential to any Radiohead fans and music fans alike.   10)\\"I Can't\\"-Another sad song about someone feeling like they are incapable of doing anything. A very underrated song that has a catchy chorus.   11)\\"Lurgee\\"-One of the few optimistic songs on the album. A song about a man who loses a women but feels better now that she is gone. The dreamy melody and soft soothing vocals by Thom make this one hard to miss.  12)\\"Blow Out\\"-This song is the most like their new stuff. It has a jazzy beat at the beginning then it evolves into an intense mix of guitars and drums. An exciting end to this great album    If you're expecting this album to be like \\"Kid A\\" or \\"Amnesiac\\" you should look the other way. If you liked \\"The Bends\\" there is a huge chance you will love this one to. Let it grow on you and take the album as it is, a debut by one of the most influential bands of our generation.

I have always respected Watterson's decision to end the strip rather than watch his work be distorted by commercialization, but from a selfish point of view, I would have liked one or two more years of the strip.    I especially enjoyed Watterson's essay at the beginning of book 1. It offered interesting insights as to who he is, how the strip came to be, and why he felt it was time to say farewell to C & H.

The price of Ultimatum by itself is more than half of the price Amazon was asking for all three. So why not??    Watching all three on 1080p was well worth the price of admission.

I wanted to mention something Odd for all of you who owns this. Check out at 3:57 through 4:01 - there is a shot of the audience and you can see a guy in the center of the screen with glasses and fuzzy hair and yellow and brown shirt. He looks like he's not having a good time so they put a digital woman in front of him and you can tell it's digital, only to cover that guy. You can see her suddenly appear from the crowd below. I suspect there is more to it in those 3 to 4 seconds. Behind the brunette digital audience, there is a blonde guy with yellow long sleeve shirt and when he lower his arm, a still picture face appears that isn't moving. The face is a man that is smiling but isn't watching the concert. He stares else where and isn't moving. That's weird. I think there are other picture faces in there to make it more fuller. They used the same shot again at 47:21 through 47:24. Check it out - pause it and then check out each frame and you will see what I mean. Enjoy the DVD!!

B000YMBBH0|1.0|This item was suppose to be a Christmas gift.

Had to go to stores a purchase the trilogy seperate in order to give as gift.
B000YIGNKE|2.0|There's a long history of directors and producers taking artistic license with film adaptation of classic novels such as Persuasion, but this goes beyond the pale.  Persuasion is by far my favourite of the Austen novels, so I admit myself to be biased on the subject, but the changes made to the screenplay leave me bewildered as to whether or not a) the writer and director knew anything of society during that period of time, and b) anyone involved with the film had ever read the actual book.    There is much to love about this film: the costuming, the scenery, even a good deal of the acting, and for the most part I was able to get through it thinking that although it certainly was not a good adaptation, it wasn't a complete loss either.  The music in particular I loved and would happily purchase if a recording is ever offered for sale.  However, the ending is just...disappointingly bad, almost to the point of pain for someone who loves the original story.  Anne running all over Bath?  The terribly written explanation given to her of Mr. Elliott's character by her friend Mrs. Smith?  Wentworth buying Kellynch?  It completely ruined it for me, and I wish I'd never bought it; it leaves me irritated with the people who wrote and directed the movie, and with myself for not having read the reviews so that I might have saved myself wasted time and money.  Please do yourself a favour and leave this production alone, or at the very least rent it before buying.

B00005JPXY|1.0|I just saw the movie. I donot like this movie. The camera angels where bad. It was not anywhere near as good as Godzilla. Not much action just a lot of running and seeing threw the eyes of the camera. You did not see the monster destroy buildings. You did see a little bit of the monster now and than. I think this movie was made to see just how bad a movie can be made. If I could give a negitive in the stars I would. If the movie was shown buy the Army or Monster point of view it would have been a lot better. Poor writing, Poor Camera angels. One long boring Movie. Save your money and get a real action dvd. Like anything else.

B0007OCG4W|4.0|This movie is originally a playwright.  And it hasn't been film-ized, so it feels like you're watching a play on screen.  I think that's how you should watch this film rather than expect a conventional film.  As mentioned in other reviews the film is explicit in its sexuality and yet there are no sex scenes.  It's only in conversations you find out about the sex, lies, and betrayals.  Yes, the time frame is confusing as the change of scenes can mean the movie has moved forward a day or three months, but I think we're all smart enough to follow.  Personally I think the subtlety is what makes this movie brilliant.  We, as audience, aren't told what we're supposed to think but rather given the opportunity to actually think for ourselves.<br />This movie stands in its own league and really shouldn't be compared to your average romance movies.  The movie is lead by the four actors who are flawless in their performances and I recommend this movie to anyone looking for a unique film experience.
B000VWYJ8Q|4.0|The HD aspects of this HD-DVD are great.  The movie itself is well done and fits well with the first two.

0312360266|4.0|I just read Marked as well as Betrayed in a day!  The plot had me hooked from the very beginning.  Although I must admit that I did notice similarities to Harry Potter and Mean Girls in the plot, there is enough substance that it stands on it's own.  I would have prefered less cursing, but I suppose the author's are trying to be realistic.  I would definitely say that this book is more for older young adults since it does have several sexual situations and references.  I did really enjoy reading this and can't wait for Chosen!
B00003CXCQ|1.0|I was purchasing this product as a \\"New\\" item. Not only was the packaging open and obviously used before. But the Jewell Case was damaged, and cut my childs finger the very first moment she held it.     This seller misrepresents his products. Be very careful. Or better yet, stay away from this seller.
B000YIGNKE|2.0|I recently reread Persuasion, so I was looking forward to seeing the new adaptation in the \\"All Austen\\" PBS series.  I was quite disappointed by this adaptation.  It wasn't horrific, but it wasn't good. In fact, it was quite strange. First, there were inaccuracies that seemed to serve no purpose.  This didn't bother me too much, except at the end. Second, there were a few odd close-up shots of Anne Elliot that were disconcerting; it was almost like Anne Elliot the character knew that she had an audience.  Third, the acting style of the actor who played the younger Mr. Elliot was overly stiff; perhaps this is just a difference in interpretation of the character. Fourth, the movie was incredibly choppy; items 2 and 3 on this list certainly contributed to that.  Fifth, I found myself thinking that people who hadn't read the book would have had a difficult time figuring out how some of the characters were related to others.  Sixth, the actress who plays Mary, the youngest Elliot sister, makes her seem mentally disturbed; in Austen's novel, Mary is petulant, vain, easily offended and incredibly self-absorbed, but there is no hint of mental illness.  Seventh, while Wentworth's returning to Anne makes a fair amount of sense in the book, it seems insufficiently motivated here; it might be because Anne doesn't come across quite so well in the movie as she does in the book.  It might also be because Wentworth seems a little too indifferent to Anne throughout the movie. He doesn't even seem to be the kind of person who would appreciate someone like Anne. Eighth, I agree with the reviewer who thought that Elizabeth looked too old to be Anne's slightly older sister.  This didn't bother me, but it's another oddity in a rather long list of oddities. All in all, I don't see myself watching this again or buying it for any of my friends and relatives who are Austen fans.
B000XA5K4I|5.0|How the heck the came up with so many original ideas with such a tired old genre I dont know, its brilliant. I tip my hat to the the writer director,  I will gleefully watch for everything new he ever puts out from now on.  I dont normally like to watch movies more than once maybe twice but this is an exception, I'm very very pleased with my purchase
B0000V6SOG|1.0|I really wanted this soundtrack for a piece titled \\"Glasgow Symphony\\" that you cannot get anywhere else.  It arrived in a jewel case that was smashed and broken, \\"shredded\\" if you will.  I called the vendor to complain and their attitude was: \\"tough\\".  Very rude and totally unhelpful.  I will be careful NEVER to buy from these unprofessional jerks again.

B000YMBBH0|5.0|I love movies, mostly heroic underdog type of movie, foreign at times and documentaries.  The Lord of the Rings trilogy is probably my favorite. The Bourne series is extremely good; lots of action, plot twists, and a vulnerable yet strong hero.  The movies mesh well and the supporting characters are well cast.  I try to only purchase movies that I know I will enjoy watching many times. Since HD DVD is new and I do not know who will win the HD wars (HD DVD vs BLU RAY) I am especially careful about HD DVD purchases.  This series is worth the purchase price and will entertain for many viewings.

B000ERU5EK|5.0|This CD is perhaps one of the best trance CDs I have bought in a very long time, if it can even be labeled as trance. Albeit this album does hold some very strong dance anthems...the real beauty is found in the down-tempo chill tacks. Never before have I found such calming solace in one CD. Amazing. This is an album that has a great mix of chill and trance intermingled in a cocktail of sonic ecstasy. Buy it, you will no doubt be very pleased. The best tracks in my opinion are Alone Tonight, Home, World on Fire and Good for Me. But don't get me wrong...every song on this Album is fantastic it was hard even listing those four without ending up listing the entire album itself!

I was right with my decision. This CD is worth the buy. It is beautiful and I can't stop playing it. The CD is clean and family friendly so anyone can listen to it without being offended or worrying about objectional lyrics. The musicians are talented and the music just flows through your soul. Ryan is a beautiful angelic singer and he shows it through the entire CD. I can even say the music is also Spiritual and I would even reccomend it to a person who prefers the Christian Music over Mainstream. I hope these guys get a Grammy nod or win the whole statue because they deserve it!!    Don't listen to the negative reviews on this site. Notice that 90% of the reviews are very positive so that ALONE should tell you something! I like a variety of music from groups with offensive lyrics to classic rock and good ol 80's pop. One Republic is a group that just lifts my spirits and have allowed me to fall in love with them!!

B000X1Z0BU|5.0|\\"Once\\" is the best film I've seen in years. This quirky love story wraps two interesting, engaging characters around their shared ambitions to create music and resolve the complications in their respective relationships. They are in love, but not with each other - yet their mutual affection is palpable. The music is powerful, emotional, and appropriate, helping to pull the viewer into story rather than getting in the way. Hansard and Irglova are convincing and charming - you'll be rooting for them the whole way.<br /><br />You'll want to see \\"Once\\" more than once - and you'll want to buy the soundtrack.
B000H5V8DG|5.0|This is a great gift for the Alias fan.  Wonderful packaging and high quality DVD production.
0553582038|2.0|To be succinct: I loved the first 3 books. This book was not as engaging as a 600+ page book needs to be and I am very concerned that To Dance with Dragons will not answer the cliffhangers present in this book.    There are a number of cliffhangers in this book - some real good ones. In fact, just when I was considering giving up on this one it started to get interesting and the fate of some major characters is really left up in the air. Then it ends and there is a note from Mr. Martin explaining how all the other narratives will be in the next book - BUT - when will we find out the fate of the stories in this book? Book 6? Long and a bit dull with no pay-off for two more books is just asking a bit too much.
031286504X|4.0|I bought this book after seeing the new movie, and as is the usual case, the two vary quite a bit.  The book is a very good read, though the written \\"I Am Legend\\" is surprisingly short (less than 200 pp.).  The book also contains several other short stories by the author, of which I've read a few, but not all.  The namesake story has the protagonist as a much simpler character than was presented in the movie, without much in the way of scientific background.  However, he does attempt to sort out the story behind the plague that has turned all others in the world into essentially vampires.  The movie touched on the madness of being alone in the world, but the book goes further into showing how hopeless one person can become and how their perspectives in life will change.  The ending is quite different from that presented in the movie and I feel gives a better and more ironic explanation for why the story is titled the way it is.  I highly recommend the read.  As it is short, it is perfect for long plane rides or that relaxing weekend.
0439882826|5.0|This is the most amazing Pop-Up book I have ever seen! There are so many pop-ups that there are pop-ups inside of pop-ups inside of pop-ups!

140120306X|4.0|There's an old adage about jokes:  if they have to be explained, they're not funny.  What does that say about gags with references so esoteric that they have to be Googled?    Such references (not always humorous) abound in The League of Extraordinary Gentleman:  The Black Dossier, the latest volume in writer Alan Moore and artists Kevin O'Neill's graphic novel series about literary heroes and villains.  In previous installments, Mina Murray, the heroine of Dracula, led a Victorian Era espionage team also consisting of Allan Quartermain, Mr. Hyde, the Invisible Man, and Captain Nemo to face such challenges as Fu Manchu and The War of the Worlds' Martians.  This time, for a story mostly set in 1958, Mina and Allan rub elbows with characters of films and television as well as literature.    How necessary is it for readers to recognize the many characters, ranging from The Seven Against Thebes to Prospero, from the Scarlet Pimpernel to Jeeves and Wooster, from Big Brother to Captain Edmund Blackadder?  Not very, if the reader is content to enjoy a fanciful escapist adventure story with stunning visuals.  Still, most readers should have no trouble recognizing \\"Jimmy\\", a lecherous secret agent.  \\"...[I]s this what it's come to?  The British adventure hero?  Pathetic,\\" Allan says of Jimmy.  (Infer what you will about Moore's view of heroes.)    Some may be disturbed by the presence of Golliwog, a nineteenth century children's literature character who looks like a blackface minstrel performer.  Others might be uncomfortable with the sexual content, sometimes used for broad humor.      The scope of the Black Dossier is nothing if not ambitious.  Between incidents of the frame story are a comic strip about Orlando's millenia-spanning life, the first act of a lost Shakespeare play, a nearly unreadable parody of Kerouac, and a sample of the sort of pornography allowed in Airstrip One (if you don't know what Airstrip One is, then I recommend reading 1984 as soon as possible).The Black Dossier even comes with 3D glasses, helpful for enjoying the fanciful conclusion in which Moore channels Shakespeare in praise of fictional characters.    Researching the figures in the book does require some work, but it is a reasonable price to pay for the ability to enjoy a unique reading experience on multiple levels.

B000YA9R3C|5.0|There has never been a movie quite like Paul Thomas Anderson's \\"There Will Be Blood.\\" Its genre is virtually an oxymoron: it's an epic character study. Anderson keeps his focus fixed precisely on one character--Daniel Plainview (Daniel Day-Lewis), first seen as a lone prospector in 1898 and portrayed finally as a reclusive, filthy-rich oil tycoon in 1927. The bulk of the movie, however, takes place in 1911, as the velvet-voiced Plainview (his voice, as many reviewers have noted, a virtual ringer for John Huston's) attempts to bilk the residents of an oil-rich California desert town named Little Boston out of their land. Only three other characters in the film make any impression at all: H.W. (Dillon Freasier), Plainview's adopted son; Henry (Kevin J. O'Connor), a seedy drifter who may or may not be Plainview's long-lost brother; and, especially, Eli Sunday (Paul Dano), a creepily beatific young evangelist who sets himself up as Plainview's chief antagonist. Some reviewers have described the plot of \\"There Will Be Blood\\" minutely, which is too bad. This is the kind of film that the less you know about it before you see it, the better--not because of any plot twists, but because the peculiarities of Plainview's character need to catch you by surprise to have their full impact. \\"There Will Be Blood\\" has been described as a portrayal of the evils of unrestrained capitalism, and that may be true; but in my opinion it is much more a study of the evils that unrestrained wealth can wreak on a human soul. I read a quote once, the gist of which was that whatever is in your character, money will bring it out in the extreme. This certainly is true of Plainview, who progresses, by almost impercepitble steps, from a happily hermetic existence to total cynicism and misanthropy. \\"I look at people, and I see nothing worth liking,\\" he confesses at one point. Certainly there is nothing worth liking about Plainview, particularly at the film's terrifying end; but as Anderson writes him and Day-Lewis plays him, he will leave you utterly astonished. Plainview is a spectacular monster, a character straight out of Balzac, Dickens or even Shakespeare, and he will haunt your imagination for a long time to come. Robert Elswit's sweeping photography captures a desert landscape as vast and arid as Plainview's soul; production designer Jack Fisk captures perfectly the dusty, dangerous poverty of Little Boston; Jonny Greenwood's audacious music score--supplemented by ironically uplifting selections from Brahms and Arvo Part--cuts the silence like a dagger, setting us up to receive the total apocalypse of a man that is Daniel Plainview. Dano, O'Connor and young Freasier give notably fine performances, but this is Day-Lewis' show, and he towers in it, and over it.and Day-Lewis plays him, he will leave you utterly astonished.

B000VLE3GA|5.0|For somebody wanting an instant Led Zeppelin collection, Mothership is the perfect choice.  The songs on this CD encompass the best of the group from 1968 to 1980 with excellent sound quality. At this point in my life I seem to be undertaking a review of the great Rock music of my youth and early adulthood. I never warmed up to Led Zeppelin during their prime, but have come to look forward to them appearing on the radio. From this CD I can hear how talented and unique they were, see the development of their music, and also become aware of how Led Zeppelin continues to play in our cultural background. What better purpose can a greatest hits compilation serve?
B000NY133G|1.0|My wife's hairstylist gave her a copy of this moronic drivel, and we had a hoot laughing at it. Apart from that, though, it's a complete waste of time. Most of the \\"secrets\\" in the book are just recycled New Age nonsense, its claims to antiquity and supposed links to secret societies are purely fictional, and its primary appeal is to greed rather than well being. The \\"Law of Attraction\\" is simple: Work toward what you want and you might get it. Sadly, this book encourages readers to simply want what they want, which is -- at best -- very poor advice.<br /><br />A related observation: Any time someone claims to have realized a great truth after hitting rock bottom in their own lives, their \\"self-improvement\\" tips are bound to be either obvious to anyone with common sense or dubious to the highest degree. This book's advice falls primarily into the second category, with smatterings of the first. Good for a chuckle, though.

0783230079|4.0|I've had a soft spot for this odd duck of a movie ever since I saw it on the big screen. Last night I watched it on DVD. It starts slow, but after the first 30 minutes just about every scene sucks you in deeper in caring about the characters. Four spirits who died together are stuck acting as unofficial guardian angels for the kid who was being born at the time of their crash. They don't know why for 30 years, and when they find out, the film really takes off. Part \\"Ghost\\" and part \\"Heaven Can Wait\\" and a hint of \\"The Bishop's Wife\\" can be discovered here, but if your eyes are dry by the time it ends, then your heart is the hardness of a diamond but with none of the gem's sparkle. Downey is great, as is Charles Grodin, and everyone else in the cast is fine as well.

B00005JPXY|1.0|What a waste of time.  The only thing you will get from this movie is a headache.  Tell your friends.  Tell your family; this movie sucks.  The monster is ridiculous and unbelievable.  The humans are annoying and I found myself rooting for their demise pretty early on in the movie.  And the camera shaking for 80 minutes will leave you with a mild case of dementia.
B000IOM0YM|5.0|I bought have all these shows via Bootleg DVD's years back on Ebay and other places.<br /><br />I figured the shows would be superb but its actually the SAME quality, to a tee, but the shows are remixed in 5.1, but I really cant tell the difference.<br /><br />The Budakhan show is the best, because it was originally shot for a then young cable company called \\"HBO\\".<br /><br />All and all its cheaper than buying each show via bootleg and its all in one package.
1416524800|3.0|Being a big fan of other Dan Brown books, I was excited to dig into Deception Point, but walked away feeling a bit unsatisfied...  What began as a gripping tale quickly dissolved into a series of far-fetched, unbelievable events (see: \\"Polar Ice Flow Submarine Rescue\\" and \\"Special Forces vs. Scientists vs. Hammerhead Sharks Battle Royal\\").  But even in light of that, Brown's writing still has that nail-biting element to it.  So, instead of rolling my eyes and dropping the book, I made it to the end with mixed reactions.<br /><br />It's a decent book, but if you're comparing it to other Dan Brown titles, it falls far short in my opinion.
B00003JRCQ|1.0|I recieved it in a reasonable amount of time and it was in good condition, but the movie itself was a bit of a drag.  The characters dont show much passion and intensity in ther acting.
B000VWYJ86|5.0|This was a great movie. The third of the Bourne movies filled in a lot of blank spots. It did leave things open for a 4th movie. I would buy a 4th one also. And Matt Damon is one of my favorite actors.
0553582461|5.0|A truly amazing conclusion to one of the best fantasy series I've read to date.  Reading the Liveship Traders triology really enhanced it.
B000HL0EEE|5.0|I like the series very much. I feel it was original and that the  cast did a pretty good job as well. Sometimes there maybe things that  did not seem to fit perfectly in the larger storyline of the Star Trek  series, but the things improved and the story arc on the Xindi for example gave the series a strong narrative development. It is sad that  the show was cancelled just after the fourth season. I hope that amazon  start selling season four as well in its Unbox video format.

0553582453|5.0|Another great book by Robin Hobb!  This book was great and I'd highly recommend to anyone who is a fan of the Farseer Trilogy.  I HIGHLY suggest you read the Live Ship Traders trilogy first.  It really enhances this trilogy.
B000VLE3IS|5.0|I ordered this item as a Christmas gift. When the gift was given it was found that the order was not complete. I contacted Amazon and a replacement was received within 48 hours. Now that's great customer service.

B000TLMWMY|5.0|The importance of Johnny Cash in the 1960's is highlighted by the venue of his TV show for new and established musicians in rock, country and folk. Performances by Bob Dylan, Waylon Jennings, Neil Young and Joni Mitchell are excellant examples of the excitement in the 1960's music scene. Cash shines as the unique force of country music he was in the 1950's and 60's. A truly American sound.

B0002Y69NG|5.0|I purchased the video collection for my son for Christmas and he was absolutely delighted!  I received the product at my home quickly.  I cannot review on the product itself; as I have not seen the collection.  Shopping at Amazon is something I will definately do in the future!
B000Y1ZXUM|5.0|Shakira was outstanding. It is worth getting this DVD. There are some parts of the DVD is not in Blu-ray High Definition. Most entertaining and see more of her performance than attending the concert.
B000FA57N0|5.0|One of my co-workers told me about the short lived Fire Fly series. After watching those DVD which I got hooked on, I had to have this movie, which is more or less the conclusion of the series. Very good for say people that enjoy SciFi series/movies like Star Gate SG-1, etc.
B000VBJEEG|5.0|This a great picture for....grownups. Children can enjoy it, but adults may cherish it.  A lot of human nature is explored in such magnificent kids picture.  I recommend it heartly
B000P6XU56|5.0|I am addicted to the films of Howard Hawks and this must be my favorite one of his films.  It is difficult for me to articulate the attraction, but I have never tired of watching it.  This is the film that is credited with saving Dean Martin's career, boosting the career of Angie Dickinson and just giving John Wayne another classic role.  I particularly like the way the entire story is set up in the first 5 minutes of the film without any dialog.  Hawks lets his camera do his talking.  The movie could be characterized as an action film, but throughout the characters actually talk to each other. This is a movie that belongs in every collection, no matter your preferred genre.
B000N3T0DW|4.0|The theme of this movie is about a woman and her family in modern-day Spain. But, there are some twist and turns that rocks her world. Coming home from work to find her daughter (her sister) has murdered her husband. And that is the beginning of navigating through the maze.     Toward the end of movie, all the skeletoms in her family comes out of the closet.
B000088E6D|3.0|I was given this CD for Christmas by someone who knew I was into this kind of music (jazz standards), and I listened to it a few times, but now it has fallen out of favour. Why?<br /><br />Look, this is a decent effort by a popular, good-looking young singer, and it is pleasant enough to listen to. It is a lot better than similar efforts of singers like Rod Stewart, but Buble can hardly be considered one of the great interpreters of the Great American songbook.<br /><br />When I rate on a five star system, I am only going to give the full five stars to an album that I think is the best, or equal to the best of its type. When you compare this to some of the classic albums also available here on Amazon, you can hardly fail to note that while Buble has a pleasant voice, the arrangements and orchestration are verging on the insipid. The songs, yes the songs are great, but you can hear them better arranged and better sung.<br /><br />Here are a few alternates for comparison. Listen to the samples and then think about whether this is a five star album.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B00000JBDV Blue Rose]] Rosemary Clooney with Duke Ellington.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B00005UMT8 Come Swing with Me!]] Francis Albert Sinatra<br /><br />[[ASIN:B000005GVD The Best of Joe Williams: The Roulette, Solid State & Blue Note Years]] or get the Joe Williams album with the Basie band.<br />[[ASIN:B00000476B The Greatest!

B00005JNS0|5.0|This movie is a lot of fun for all ages. I especially enjoy the surround sound which is actually 6.1 DD-EX - most movies are only released in 5.1 DD...
B000WCBMA8|4.0|The Hives' \\"Black and White Album\\" is exactly what you think it's going to be...a series of catchy, manic songs crisply played with abandon.    The album roars from the start, with the terrific one-two punch of \\"Tick Tick Boom\\" and \\"Try It Again\\". \\"Tick\\" kickstarts everything with a fake-tune-up, wandering-around-the-stage snippet of noise, before launching into howling \\"Yeahs!\\" Churning guitars back up the ping-pong vocals, and the sudden silent brake stops are thrilling.  LOOOOOVE the \\"booms\\". It's a kick.    \\"Try It Again\\", with plenty of power chords to pogo to, just blasts out of speakers. The sassy cheerleading backups somehow work...this is modern rock that has an equal chance of making you smile as make you dance.    As other reviewers have noted, there's a \\"sameness\\" to many of the tracks, and they proudly wear their influences on their collective sleeves. That's fine with me. I listen to a Hives song to get exactly this sort of vibe and energy, and they are perfectly happy to supply me with some. Smart bands know how to incorporate their history with their \\"art\\". I find it fun to pick out the \\"Devo\\" moment, or their Midnight Star crib.    \\"Midnight Star\\" you ask? Well, I have to admit, during the song, \\"T.H.E.H.I.V.E.S.\\" I couldn't get the \\"Z.O.I.D.S.\\" spelling chant out of my head, from the song, \\"Freak-a-zoid.\\" But the chorus also has an 80's New Wave sound as well...    \\"Square One Here I Come\\" is another headlong sprint of a rock song, with an irresistible guitar hook. Actually, the song has like FOUR guitar hooks...man, if this song had been around for those Airband Mock Rock contests back at UCLA in the early 80's...    This is one fun album to listen to...
074356619X|5.0|We all have heard plenty about \\"The Secret.\\" Of course, the secret of it is that it has been around for the longest time, and author Rhonda Byrne would be the first to tell you that basically she has capitalized fantastically on ancient knowledge. Well, she doesn't quite put it that way, exactly. But she has done a lovely job of disseminating this knowledge with her many vehicles: I happen to like the audio CDs the best. Most people are familiar with the movie, but there is something about lying still, closing one's eyes, and listening to the many, varied speakers on the CDs telling their versions and vignettes, with Rhonda's haunting voice interspersed throughout, that is magical. I recommend this to the novice who is new to the Law of Attraction as this is a great introduction. Or, for the veteran, it is a good tool for \\"remembering to remember.\\"
B000SO7OL6|5.0|The Very Best of Diana Krall takes many of the old \\"standards\\" and gives them a new presentation with her jazzy vocals, superb keyboard work, and high quality back-up arrangements by either a small combo or a full orchestra. Krall says that Peggy Lee has been a strong influence on her performance style and you can hear it on \\"Peel Me A Grape.\\" But there's also a Sarah Vaughan quality to \\"Frim Fram Sauce,\\" that is really delightful. Highly recommended for decompressing from a tough day or as background for a sensuous seduction plan or the successrful morning after.
0439813786|5.0|This is an incredible book for all ages.  Children from ages 4or 5 will love to have the story read to them and the Pictures are fantastic.  This book tells the story with pictures and words.  Take a look at a few pages and you will love it
B004U7MQYC|1.0|I am a huge fan of the Highlander TV series, at least up until they &#34;jumped the shark&#34; with the ridiculous killing of Ritchie at the end of season five.  It went downhill entirely after that.  Unfortunately, when it comes to the movies, beyond the original film that started it all, they are all complete garbage.  Indeed, the hardest thing is to decide exactly which one is in fact the worst.  I might choose this one as the worst of the lot, but then they released &#34;The Source.&#34;  So it's really a toss-up.  Hard to believe they went against over 5 years and over 100 episodes of quality TV to change characters, back stories and much of the mythology and foist this upon a gullible public.  On top of all this the actors all apparently forgot everything they learned over the previous several years of acting in the TV series.  The performances are simply awful in this movie.  And Christopher Lambert really does look like he's over 400 years old, though I'm not sure that was intentional.  If someone suggests you see this, run, don't walk, in the other direction.  Watch a classic episode of the TV series and erase the memory of this film from your mind.  If you are forced to watch it, you may incur PTSD.
B000002U82|5.0|This is probably the best album of all time. Any rock lover should own this!!  And at this price, get two!!    What more is there to say than what has already been said by countless reviewers. From the opening heartbeat of Speak To Me, through the radio hit Money, to the closing beats of Eclipse, this is a perfect album.  Moody, haunting, and well-done.    One thing to note about the black cover edition.  There are newer releases, the so called \\"re-mastered\\" editions.  Keep in mind these are re-masters of 30 year old digital tapes.  Unless you have the SCAD players, avoid them. The older CD versions are closer to the true quality. I know, I have two editions on vinyl.  The older CD editions are closer the the vinyl.

0061122416|5.0|Our book group read this book. One woman commented that it was \\"life changing\\" for her. It is an excellent book for a group as there are so many facets to discuss. On the personal level it makes you examine your own life and is most thought provocative. I have read it twice and will read it again. It is a keeper for one's personal library and a good purchase.
032147404X|5.0|I understand that Kelby probably has a sense of humor that wont be liked by many but his book is genius. He attacks all the problems you would have on the field during a shoot and teaches you everything you need to know.

You will definatly be happy after this purchase i guarantee it!!

0439882826|5.0|This book was recommended by Whitney Matheson at Pop Candy - and she was right!  It is fun and informative, but the most amazing thing is the crazy, unexpected pop-ups.  The technology of the pop-up has changed drastically since the first Star Wars movie came out.  This book has wonderful full pop-ups of places and things from all the movies -- but even more impressive are the pop-ups within the pop-ups -- yowza!  Sadly, Star Wars: A Pop-Up Guide to the Galaxy is not a book for kids, because the pop-ups are so intricate and delicate. It is hard to re-close each page.  Because some pop-ups have their own pop-ups, the book should be opened and closed by an adult so it will stay intact. (and even this can be tricky without care)  The art is interesting, but not quite the realistic style I think of for Star Wars.  Sometimes it takes a little imagination to see who is who.  As a trivia buff, I loved the little details about the characters and places from these beloved films.  I enjoyed this book, and it makes a great gift for a Star Wars fan with a short attention span.

B000HZD08M|1.0|The movie was totally lame.  I don't believe it deserves even 1 star but that is the least it lets you rate it...
B00005JPXY|2.0|The movie \\"Cloverfield\\" is good at what it does. Remember all thost great scenes in Alien, for example, where the wreckage and bodies are piling up, the lights are flashing, and there's this great suspenseful moment with The Thing not yet emerged from the shadows? This movie does that scene really well.<br /><br />That's all it does. Really. That's it, front to back, beginning to end, but with bouncy hand-held cameras and yelling. That's all.<br /><br />The end.<br /><br />-- wiredweird

0393327655|5.0|The best-written and most tightly-argued of the recent spate of atheist polemics. The main thrust of Harris's argument is the surely incontrovertible point that \\"faith\\" makes a virtue of believing something to be true without having demonstrable evidence - and we don't find belief without evidence acceptable in, say, physics or history, so why do we find it not only acceptable but uncriticizable in polite society when it comes to matters of religion? As Harris puts it: \\"Because each new generation of children is taught that religious propositions need not be justified in the way that all others must, civilisation is still beseiged by armies of the preposterous. We are, even now, killing ourselves over ancient literature. Who would have thought something so tragically absurd could be possible?\\"    Harris argues, counter-intuitively but convincingly, that we should be no more accepting of religious moderates than we should of fundamentalist extremists. To be a religious moderate is merely to interpret loosely or ignore altogether the parts of scripture that are inconvenient for modern daily existence. Therefore, as Harris points out, moderate religion offers no firm ground from which to criticise fundamentalists for taking the same scripts literally: \\"Religious moderates are, in large part, responsible for the religious conflict in our world, because their beliefs provide the context in which scriptural literalism and religious violence can never be adequately opposed.\\"     One feature of Harris's book that makes me value it more than other similar efforts - most noticeably The God Delusion by Richard Dawkins, for whom any suggestion of tolerating spirituality is anathema - is Harris's readiness to concede that there is \\"clearly a sacred dimension to our existence, and coming to terms with it could well be the highest purpose of human life\\". There follows a fascinating discussion of Buddhism and what seems to be a suggestive correlation between spirituality, ethics and positive emotions. Harris argues that a rational approach to exploring spirituality will pay dividends in creating a mature science of the mind, which will one day have more precise things to say about these matters.    The book has one great flaw, in that Harris thinks himself into justifying torture through an analogy with the collateral damage we reluctantly accept during warfare. I believe this analogy breaks down because we accept collateral damage only because, and to the extent that, our most sophisticated weapons are imperfect. That is, every time someone invents more accurate weapons, we tolerate less collateral damage as a result. The logical conclusion of Harris's position, then, is that the acceptability of torture must somehow depend on the sophistication of our current weapons technology. This can't be right, can it?
0307237702|5.0|Reading this book is the ideal way to get to know presidential candidate Barack Obama.  You should know four things about the book.<br />(1) Obama admits his imperfections regularly.  For example, he ends the book admitting that he too often let his wife raise their two small daughters.  This, along with a number of Chicago Tribune online articles, have helped me to feel like I really understand what this man is like - his strengths and weaknesses.<br />(2) He gives a very fair-minded overview of the issues facing the United States.  This would be a great textbook for introducing high school and college students to political science, social work, and economic issues.  It is timely, well-written, and fair.<br />(3) Obama admits in the acknowledgements at the end  of the book that this book has been thoroughly vetted by political advisers.  I think it would be difficult to find a quote that could be used against Obama in a campaign.  I wonder if any of the candidates (Republican or Democrat) would differ with much he writes here.  But I also wonder whether any of them are as capable of seeing and articulating the various factors that must be considered when making decisions about particular issues.  This brings me to my last point.<br />(4) I conclude from this book that Obama is a thinker, a scholar, a writer, an academic, someone who is deeply concerned with ideas.  As a doctoral student at Duke, I am attracted to that.  But I realize there are others who will wonder whether he has the grit, experience, discipline and decisiveness to lead and manage the government.  That barely gets mentioned in this book.  The difference between Obama (the man of ideals) and Obama (what is really possible) is already apparent on the campaign trail.  For example, he writes eloquently about the Iraq war and about foreign policy in the book, but the sound bites that make it into the news are about his \\"attacks\\" on Hillary Clinton's judgment about Iraq and his promise to \\"bring the troops home.\\"  If he became president, would he be able to be the Barack Obama who wrote The Audacity of Hope or would he be the Barack Obama of the soundbite political campaign?  I have no doubt he wants to be the former but many wonder whether he would end up being the latter.<br /><br />Like a well-written textbook, I think virtually everyone would find this book informative and helpful for their own understanding of the various issues.ps home.\\"  If he became president, would he be able to be the Barack Obama who wrote The Audacity of Hope or would he be the Barack Obama of the soundbite political campaign?

B00006CXSS|5.0|I can't say enough good things about this series. It's just an outstanding piece of work that immortalizes the men of EZ Company, a WWII airborne infantry division that started out behind the lines of Normandy. If you have any kind of appreciation for the men who have fought for this country, or simply are fascinated with WWII history, then you will LOVE this collection.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.

This movie is great for Die Hard fans with references going all the way back to Die Hard, including and FBI agent named Agent Johnson & Yippe kiya m***** f***** (unrated only).  A must see for all Die Hard fans, definately fits in with the other movies and better than Die Hard with a Vengance.
B000YIGNKE|2.0|Along with others who have written, I was very unhappy with this version of Persuasion.  One would think that a newer adaptation would be better than the one in 1995 but this is not the case.  The actor who played Captain Wentworth was well enough but where did they get the actress who played Anne Elliot?  And why did the director spend so much time having Anne stare into the camera after writing one of her letters?  How annoying!  I did'nt really feel that much sympathy for her as much as I felt for Amanda Root in 1995.  The gentle way Captain Wentworth helps Anne into the carriage in the 1995 version coming back from the 'long walk' was changed with the abrupt way this new Captain grabs Anne by the arm and hoists her on the back of the carriage like a sack of potatoes! There were so many inconsistencies I cannot understand why this version was even made.  Somtimes it is better to leave well enough alone.
B000KWZ7VU|5.0|Barenboim's Beethoven is more intelligent and more musical than others. His sense of structure, his touch, his ability to make the piano \\"sing\\", everything is superb. The masterclasses give us the oportunity to understand the performer's points of view not only on Beethoven but also on music. A TREASURE just like this, in capital letters!!!

B00005OAA6|5.0|I didn't know that Victoria had recorded solo work.  I only recently discovered her music while checking out other music on [...].  I noticed that someone had Victoria Beckham on their playlist.  I was trying to figure out why she was on someone playlist so I checked on the song and fell in love with the song.  I don't remember the exact song now because I searched IMEEM.com using Victoria's name and found all of these songs which I really, really enjoyed listening to.  So I decided to see if I could get at least one of her CD's on [...], which I was able to do.  I got the VB CD and I LOVE ALL OF THE SONGS on that CD.  Now, I trying to find out how to get the songs \\"Full Stop,\\" \\"Gone,\\" \\"TheHustler,\\" and many more.  Believe me, you won't be dissapointed.  To be honest I didn't think that Victoria could really sing, but boy was I wrong.
B000001EC1|4.0|OK I'll admit I'm a bit of a non-fan of this band though you wouldn't know it if you trawled through my CD collection, each darn studio effort these boys put out up to Keep the Faith is present and accounted for. But even though I'm an avowed sceptic when it comes to this mob it must be admitted their brand of pop metal AOR shifted some serious units and the band did pen some great teen rock anthems all within a G rated atmosphere of uplifting good times.<br /><br />So at the juncture post New Jersey it's utterly justified for this mob to produce a best of for their loving minions of perennial 14 year old housewives and really, for the price you can get this for nowadays there are no excuses for even the very very occasional fan not to pick up this grab bag of BJ's finest moments.<br /><br />A quick flick down the track listing will show you that megahits like Livin' On A Prayer, Keep the Faith and You Give Love A Bad Name are all present and accounted for. The album is actually fairly rock orientated in a way that flies in the face of the bands girlie image and some real soul is injected into proceedings by the inclusion of Wanted Dead or Alive and the Jon solo hit Blaze of Glory. The collection reaches all the way back to their debut for their initial calling card of Runaway and the musically different feel of In & Out of Love shows that this band were capable of writing in forms other than the cliche.<br /><br />Sure there are a wad of soft rock ballads, some of which really should have you reaching for the sick bag (Bed of Roses anyone?), but the zest and dead seriousness with which even the ballads are attacked means that it's hard to fault the philosophical headspace from which they come.<br /><br />A look at the track listing should decide it for you but I would recommend picking this up if you've tapped your foot along to any of these songs on the radio.

B00005JPXY|4.0|Before I start my review, I feel it is pertinent that you all know that I grew up a Godzilla fanatic. So obviously, Cloverfield was barking up the right tree with this reviewer.<br /><br />Cloverfield is a difficult movie to figure out. At times, this movie truly entrenches you into a new realm of science fiction monster movies. Cloverfield's style is what Roland Emmerich's Godzilla should have been. Told in a War of the World's fashion, the story is told from the perspective of a bunch of average Joes. No marine biologist or \\"worm guys\\" in Cloverfield, they react more than often in the exact same ways that the audience would. Michael Stahl - David outshines the rest of the group and actually saves the movie from clich&eacute; bad acting. Another important element of the film was a use of a nearly invisible script. The actors do, for the most part, seem really be reacting to all of these events.<br /><br />No science fiction movie is going to be a success without a great monster. This beast is visually stunning and very refreshing in a genre that is most of the time by the book. Without revealing too much, there are also little creatures that play a huge role within the movie as well. Much like Jaws, the movie relies a lot of quick appearances and over powering dominance on the NYC. Too many monster movies depend on showing the monster non stop to show its monstrosity, but inherently, the more a monster is shown, the more flaws that are revealed. Describing what the monster looks like would only be an injustice to the reader. As a monster fan, I would not do that to you.<br /><br />The difficulty within the movie is the fact that darn handheld camera is both the movie's greatest accomplishment and greatest crutch. Its style really helps you connect with some of the characters and feel stuck with the group. The hand held camera also allows the monster and its critters to be more threatening because of their lack of detail. Like any movie that is based on hand held camera use, the style wears out its welcome very early in the movie. About 45 minutes in, motion sickness medicine doesn't sound like such a bad idea. Another problem with the hand held camera is who is holding the camera. T.J. Miller's \\"Hud\\" had to be one of the most annoying characters to give such a prominent role. His efforts of comic relief are both unrealistic and worst of all not very funny. I was cheering for him to be killed the entire movie.<br /><br />Overall, I would say the good outweighs the bad with a great monster and great effects. I would rank it as just as good or better than last year's sleeper, The Host. J.J. Abrams said in an interview that he was visiting Japan with his son and stopped by a toy store, and they were bombarded with Godzilla toys. J.J. decided America needed it's own monster. Unlike the cuddly King Kong, J.J. wanted to create something unrelenting and very insane. I would say for the most part that he succeeded.t its welcome very early in the movie.

0375842381|5.0|Without question the best \\"fantasy' series I've read.  Challenging, thought provoking, heretical in a way that invokes some of Robert Heinlein's work.  The characters are compelling and complex, the themes epic, and the end beautiful and heartbreaking.  To call this a children's work is to place it in a category beneath it's scope.  It's as good as literature gets.
B00000I07P|5.0|Bon Jovi have copped heaps of flak over the years and their seeming decision to rely utterly on their sales figures as a defence is perhaps indicative itself of some of their limitations but lets stop the nit-picking for a moment and give credit where it is due because this is a great AOR-bordering-on-hard-rock album.<br /><br />The production by Bruce Fairbairn and the entire feel of the record are huger than huge. The songs are catchy and melodic yet still utilise the full band sound typical of hard rock bands despite many of the sentiments put forth are teeny AOR in the extreme. Somehow with this album the uplifting buoyancy of proceedings sounds unmatched by just about any other record in this sphere, the brainless good times just washing over the listener with frontman and namesake Jon as circus master, leading you through a journey of boisterous yet playfully G rated rockers like the massive hits You Give Love A Bad Name and Livin' On A Prayer, songs that still sound good today.<br /><br />Other rockers are also pretty darn handy as opener Let It Rock pronounces that yes this band is an animal that still remembers the jungles of being a working bar band. Social Disease is both tongue in cheek and serious all at once, walking a fine line and I recall side one (in the old money) finishing with one of the crowning achievements of the entire BJ catalogue in the form of Wanted Dead or Alive. This is an exellent song full of more genuine emotion than any two or three more traditional BJ ballads and is deservedly more remembered than any of them.<br /><br />As side two - as it was called when this thing originally came out, rolled along it was obvious that the good time rockin' was very much part of the very heartbeat of this band with numbers like Raise Your Hands with massive production values that made much else of what was around sound very very yesterdays news. Ditto for Wild in the Streets as long as you can get over the idea of Bon Jovi being genuinely wild. Alas for side two there are the blights of three ballads in a row but for the times they were pretty spot on. The tryptych does make me think twice about giving this ablum five stars and perhaps I'm being generous, but I figure my gut feeling is the right one here as despite this thing being very calculated indeed, why not? I mean if you take yourself seriously as this mob have steadfastly done then why not calculate your albums?<br /><br />Anyway, that's my two cents worth regarding this quintessential party rock album that all these years later is probably still the main album this band is known for.re the blights of three ballads in a row but for the times they were pretty spot on.

B000TGJ8CQ|4.0|This is a good action film with a tight cast (Nick Cage, Jessica Biel, Julianne Moore), a creative story line, and amazing visual effects.  Cris Johnson can see two minutes into the future - his future - so the events that touch his life in this movie are so perfectly orchestrated that they are almost hysterical.<br /><br />However, the government wants him to find a missing nuclear warhead, and they will do anything to elicit his cooperation.  But the bad guys know about him, too.  There are many plot twists and thoughtful moments.  The ending is a bit abrupt, but once you catch your breath, the light bulb lights - or may take a while to go off - but it's a satisfying film overall.
B000M3452Y|5.0|I received Sound of Silver and the first album at the same time. I heard the song \\"Daft Punk is Playing at My House\\" on the now cancelled show \\"Love Monkey\\" (which was very good, I liked it, and that is the death knell to any show!). The only lyrics I remembered were \\"show you the ropes, show you the ropes,\\" so I Googled it and discovered LCD Soundsystem. The music has really gotten under my skin, especially Sound of Silver - this is my favorite album to crank + motivates me when I need it. James Murphy is my age and I appreciate HIS appreciation of various artists by whom he is obviously influenced - Talking Heads, Kraftwerk, Bowie, Eno, Prince, Mark E Smith and The Fall, Floyd, Beatles, Can, and the list goes on. Yes, it is derivative, but he pays homage with his own snarky, smart-a** twist. I mostly like all kinds of rock and am not really a big dance music fan or electronica fan, but THIS I like, because it is edgy + catchy. So put this on and shake your butt!

0141439475|5.0|Too many \\"Monster Mash\\" ditties and cheap movie treatments (\\"Young Frankenstein\\") have made us forget this story's deep pathos and overwhelming sadness. Rewind to Mary Shelley's original. \\"Frankenstein\\" is about recklessness, man's inhumanity to man, and the potential idolatry of science.<br />The creature's desire for friendship mirrors Dr. Victor Frankenstein's desire to confide his secret to someone \\"normal.\\"<br />Our author, the wife of English Romantic poet Percy Bysshe Shelley, wrote \\"Frankenstein\\" when she was only 19 years old. Her story construction shows a remarkable sensibility that we'd find, if at all, in people much older. Some examples:<br />Her choice of name for Victor's university instructor -- Professor Waldman. He encourages Victor's medical research to better diagnose and treat disease. Waldman represents the \\"wall\\" of ethical norms that no person, no matter how talented or well meaning, should go beyond. To do otherwise, a person may well lose himself and all he holds dear. Victor charges past the wall with disastrous results.<br />Ambiguities of time and setting increases the story's power. Victor Frankenstein's faith tradition is left undetailed. Frankenstein sounds Jewish yet Victor and his family seem part of Geneva's gentile establishment. Perhaps VF is Roman Catholic and retains that religion's unhealthy fascination with the dead (with its disturbing statues of nailed-up Jesus and the habit of praying to deceased \\"saints\\"). Odd yet welcome that these people are in the vanguard of today's pro-life movement.<br />It shouldn't escape notice that Geneva, while an international city at Europe's crossroads, was also home to John Calvin's experiment in Reform Protestant theocracy. So is Victor a Jew, a Catholic, or a Presbyterian? We aren't told and that's crucial. Shelley is showing us that spiritual blindness is an equal-opportunity malady.<br />Negative reactions to the creature give us a glimpse of the violence lurking just below the surface of \\"civilized\\" society. Shelley's story is a signpost for how the manufactured men of advanced biology and other minorities-cum-servants come to be treated in a violent society. For prologue, see Alex Haley's \\"Roots.\\" For meditations on the future, view the movie \\"Blade Runner.\\" For contemporary applications, consider the debates over cloning and stem-cell research against a backdrop of a country where boxing, professional wrestling, the International Fighting League, and fisticuffs in hockey are taken to be normal instead of the abominations they truly are.<br />The only weakness in \\"Frankenstein\\" is the creature's ability to speak. It's not clear how he received this power. The Vilna Gaon once told his most accomplished student, Rabbi Chaim Volozhiner, that it's not especially difficult to create a man if a person truly understands a book known as the Sefer Yetzirah. The creation is known as a golem. A golem can do everything a normal man can do including reason, the Gaon told Rav Chaim, the exception being the ability to talk. The speaking spirit that G-d gave Adam and subsequent members of the human race can only be bestowed by G-d.<br />\\"Frankenstein\\" would have been even more terrifying and moving had Shelley withheld the power of speech (and some better movie treatments have handled it this way). Victor finding the creature's thoughts in a journal after his reign of terror would have been more poignant. Guess we can't blame our British Protestant author for not knowing Jewish tales involving golems.<br />It's possible for Jews to become Frankensteins -- consider what Dr. Bernard Nathanson did to the unborn, including his own offspring, in the name of \\"women's rights\\" and \\"reproductive freedom\\" (read BN's \\"Aborting America\\") before his soul reawakened. Yet if Victor Frankenstein is Jewish he lacks the key ingredients in being an Israelite -- compassion and acceptance of responsibility.<br />Failure to accept responsibility is what got the early fathers of mankind cursed (see the Book of Genesis for how G-d reacts when Adam tries to put off his sin on Eve and when Cain questions whether he needs to concerned about the whereabouts of murdered brother Abel). Noah moved the ball somewhat but only took responsibility for his own family. Our father Abraham, history's first prophet, was the pioneer in taking compassion and responsibility outside one's own tent, making converts and doing kindness to strangers. This set the pattern for Abraham's descendants and the spirit would manifest itself powerfully in his great-grandchildren Joseph and Judah, the sons of Israel.<br />Notice in Genesis how the story of Judah taking responsibility for his children with Tamar (even embarrassing himself publicly in doing so) comes amid Joseph beginning a journey that will include stewardship of Egypt and a grand act of forgiveness. The Torah is showing us that the new ethic is blooming on two tracks destined to become one.<br />The culmination comes when Joseph publicly tests Judah over the matters of their father (Jacob/Israel) and brother Benjamin. Judah demonstrates that his repentance and acceptance of responsibility are complete and immovable. Joseph's reservations melt and the brothers are tearfully reunited. Epilogue: Judah became the largest of the Israelite tribes and eventually become the identity for the entire holy nation -- all Israelites today are known as Yehudim, \\"Jews,\\" (Yehudah being the Hebrew equivalent of Judah). It became halacha (Jewish law) that all Jews are responsible for one another. And Joseph was given an extra portion of inheritance by Jacob mainly for his (Joseph's) ability to avoid the desire for revenge, something that consumed the main characters in \\"Frankenstein.\\" Israel must eventually forgive its/our brothers, the nations of the world, for the final redemption to occur.<br />It's a pity Dr. Frankenstein didn't know the personal prayer of Rabbi Yehudah HaNassi (Judah \\"The Prince\\"), someone who knew a good bit about taking responsibility. Rabbi Yehudah, thanks to the good grace and cooperation of Edomite/Roman cousin Emperor Antoninus, was able to compile the Mishnah, ensuring Judaism's oral law would not be forgotten.<br />Rabbeinu HaKadosh's daily prayer is found in the Babylonian Talmud (Berachos 16B) --<br />\\"May it be Your Will, Hashem, my G-d, and the G-d of my forefathers, that You rescue me today and every day from brazen men and from brazenness, from an evil man, an evil companion, an evil neighbor, an evil mishap, the destructive spiritual impediment...\\"<br />A few words from our author's husband in the heart of Victor Frankenstein may have saved the doctor and his creation from fates worse than death --<br />\\"The winds of Heaven mix forever<br />With a sweet emotion<br />Nothing in the world is single<br />All things by a law divine<br />In one spirit meet and mingle.<br />Why not I with thine?\\"<br />(P.B.

B00005JPXY|5.0|There are monster movies and then there's \\"Cloverfield,\\" a film that many have correctly described as a cross between the \\"Godzilla\\" films and \\"The Blair Witch Project.\\" Rather than conventional movie cameras and conventional movie camera tricks, a handheld camcorder is utilized for this film, meaning that the visuals are effectively reduced to shaky close ups, choppy cuts, and problems with lighting and focusing. But camera tricks are only part of what makes \\"Cloverfield\\" so incredible: here's a film that reinvents the grade-B atomic films of the 1950s, first be eliminating the cheesy science fiction of outer space aliens, undersea creatures, and genetic mishaps, second by including a plausible and tense character story. This movie is not about camp--it's all about panic, fear, and the terror of a monstrous giant destroying New York City.    The film's real genius is in its mystery. Much like the characters, we too are completely in the dark about the situation, and we remain so even after the film ends. What exactly is this creature? Where did it come from? Why is it attacking? Since these questions are never answered, your guess is as good as mine. And that's exactly the way it should be, since the science-related explanations of films like \\"Godzilla,\\" \\"Them!\\" \\"Mothra,\\" and \\"It Came from Beneath the Sea\\" are so worn out and ridiculous. We don't even get a real sense of what this creature looks like, although we are treated to some brief glimpses and a silhouetted long shot near the end of the film. I'll spare you a description, simply because I want this review to be just as elusive and enticing as the film's ad campaign.    The human story is appropriately simple and insignificant, given the fact that we only care about the action. Rob Hawkins (Michael Stahl-David) has received and accepted a job opportunity from Japan; his friend, Lily (Jessica Lucas), and his brother, Jason (Mike Vogel), see him off with a surprise party, one that would have been a blast wereit not for Rob's would-be girlfriend, Beth (Odette Yustman) showing up with another man. Assigned the task of capturing testimonials with a camcorder is his friend, Hud (T.J. Miller)--he quickly forgets his assignment and begins filming everything, including the inevitable fight between Rob and Beth. Hud also begins following a girl named Marlena (Lizzy Caplan), who doesn't know anyone at the party that well and doesn't seem too comfortable with Hud or the camera.    Everything comes to a grinding halt when the ground momentarily shakes, causing the power to fluctuate and an oilrig near the Statue of Liberty to collapse. The news reluctantly speculates that an earthquake has struck New York City. But the truth is quickly revealed, and at that point, all hell breaks loose; an explosion across the river sends up a massive fireball, forcing everyone at the party to run out of the building. Soon after, the head of the Statue of Liberty comes skidding down the street, and that's immediately followed by the collapse of a massive skyscraper. The resulting cloud of dust and debris engulfs everything, forcing Hud, Rob, Jason, Lily, and Marlena to take refuge in a convenience store. While there, Marlena says something to the effect of, \\"I saw it! It's alive!\\" No one has a moment to question her because ground-splitting footsteps are shattering the windows.    This is only the first in a series of terrifying events documented by Hud, who never once switches the camera off. The Brooklyn Bridge is destroyed as thousands attempt to cross it. Smaller, scorpion-like creatures fall off the giant monster and begin attacking; we eventually learn that being bitten by one of them isn't a good thing. Military units are swamped, not only because of their depleting manpower, but also because of the number of injured civilians. As the city crumbles, Rob gets a frantic cell phone call from Beth, and he realizes that she's trapped within the city. Feeling guilty over the fight they had earlier, he vows to find and save her, no matter what. Hud and the others follow more out of fear than anything else, which is understandable since the thought of being separated in the middle of a disaster is horrifying.    Some of the most frightening moments take place underground, with the main characters traveling through New York's subway system. Who knows what could be lurking in the dark corners of the tunnels, away from the noise and chaos on the surface? And even if they do make it, what will they find when they emerge? Will there be anything left to find? Will something be waiting to find them? It's this maddening sense of uncertainty that makes \\"Cloverfield\\" more than just a monster movie rehash: there's genuine suspense coursing all throughout, and for once, it's BECAUSE of the gigantic monster, not IN SPITE of it. You know this is true when Beth's apartment building is finally revealed--it's leaning against a neighboring building like a domino ready to fall.    We occasionally see bursts of old camera footage showing Rob and Beth at Coney Island, which was effective given their current emotional drama. It was also effective for the movie as a whole; I instantly recognized the escapist potential of this film when I saw its first teaser trailer back in July, but even after months of insider rumors and speculation, I never once thought that I'd be using words like \\"brilliant\\" to describe it. But the reality is that it is brilliant: brilliant as a horror film, brilliant as a thriller, and brilliant as a reinvention of the monster movie. \\"Cloverfield\\" may actually be one of the greatest monster movies ever made, a taut, unnerving, and completely original fright fest that doesn't lose itself to campy science fiction. It's set a new standard: The monster movie that subsequent monster movies will be compared to.

B00005JPLW|4.0|Ever since this movie came out, everyone had something to say about it: jokes about Spartans in minimal leader tights, special effects, graphic scenes of death.  I personally wanted to see the movie about one of the best known battles in human history and the bravery of the Greeks from Sparta.  Battle of Themopylae has ben immortalized in history, myth and legend.  In this film, I liked the sly humor of these manly man.  There are portrayed not only as a brave and selfless soldiers, but they get to show us that they are smart and witty too.  Their women are strong and there is a sense of purpose to their lives - even if the purpose means loosing the life itself.  I had some issues with all the monsters in the movie.  I did not want to watch another \\"Lord of the Ring\\" movie. Xerxes was a brutal king, but portraying his army as a bunch of ugly looking monsters, was not something I could buy into easily.  The movie (and the actual historical event) is about fight for democracy and ideals at any cost, it is a lesson to humankind and its protagonists rightly so deserve their place in history.  But this was a fight about men against men, not men against monsters.  Spartans were outnumbered against Persian army, but they have willingly sacrificed their lives in order to spread awareness to the rest of the Greece and western world about the ideas worth dying for.  I personally loved the movie, but I would say that it is intended for mature audience.
B000YA82F6|2.0|There are some cute lines. There is an unexpected and unwanted pregnancy which ends in the birth of a live baby instead of a baby dead in an abortion. That's about it for this movie. The main characters are portrayed as shallow, jaded people who refuse to engage in the serious business of life. If everyone were like the people in this movie, thought would have vanished from the human scene. The pregnancy begins with experimental sex on a lark undertaken more out of curiosity than passion. It ends with the adoption of the child by an emotionally wounded single woman who clearly cannot provide a healthy environment for the child. Call it tragicomic if you will, laugh out loud at some of the gags, but remember what you read here -- two stars, and not a twinkle more.

B000N4SHOE|1.0|There are some actors and actresses that were great when you saw them infrequently or when they did something unique.  Zellweger was fantastic in Jerry Maguire for this reason- bringing a fresh female character to the Hollywood scene.  Likewise the reason why she worked well in Bridget Jones is because she played a ditsy, self-obsessed blonde very, very well.  In Cold Mountain she also went over the top, but again, at least it was unique.<br /><br />When I heard they were making a Beatrix Potter movie with a big budget I was thrilled.  Emily Watson- excellent.  Ewan MacGregor- excellent.  But I don't understand why an American should be cast as Beatrix Potter- especially Zellweger who is known for these over-the-top performances that increasingly make you want to smack her.  This is sadly a movie I avoided like the plague as soon as I saw the trailer.

B000YENUI6|3.0|I was disappointed in this film, the latest collaboration between David Cronenberg and Viggo Mortensen (the last was \\"A History of Violence\\" which I felt was a better film).  Too much is taken for granted in the narrative.  For example: a mobster in black leather who could scare the soundstage crew with his appearance, walking into the maternity ward of a large London hospital, taking a baby out of a crib, putting it into the big black satchel he's carrying, leaving a bouquet of roses in the crib, and walking out with the baby in the bag, without so much as an orderly calling out, \\"Hey, just what do you think you're doing?!\\" or at least calling a security guard.  Billed as a modern film noir/suspense entry, \\"Eastern Promises\\" doesn't really offer that much suspsense: it's obvious quite soon that Mortensen's character, Nikolai Luzhin, must be undercover - you'd have to be an idiot not to figure it out quickly. The rest of the suspense centers around whether and when the other characters in the film will figure it out, whether Mortensen and Naomi Watts will end up together, will Watts end up with the baby, and how the hell Mortensen manages to fight off two knife-wielding Russian thugs in leather jackets while stark naked in a steam bath.    The film opens with a young girl named Tatiana giving bloody birth to a daughter in the aforementioned large London hospital. Tatiana dies as the baby is born, and midwife Anna finds in her bag a diary written in Russian - that is the only way she knows the dead girl's name.  Anna just HAPPENS to be of Russian descent herself, imagine that! Hoping that the diary will give her some information as to the baby's living relatives, Anna recognizes in the diary the name of a Russian restaurant where Tatiana \\"worked\\", and takes the diary there.  In doing so, Anna walks right into the arms of the Russian mob, for whom the restaurant is a front. Among other business interests, the Russian mob does a brisk trade in young girls from EasternEurope (one thing the film never explains is how the pregnant Tatiana escaped from the sex stable in which she was imprisoned).  The Russian mob boss, played by German actor Armen Mueller-Stahl in the kind of familiar, kindly, grandfatherish facade that he seems to have been doing for 15 years, offers to translate the diary.  In reality, as we learn immediately, he is a vicious, amoral Russian Godfather, the autocrat of his crime and his blood family.    Mortensen's character, Luzhin, has infiltrated both families as the chauffeur and \\"minder\\" of the boss's son, Kiril, floridly well-played by French actor Vincent Cassel.  One of Kiril's problems is that he is a closet homosexual, an orientation that he knows his father and the Russian crime world view less than broadmindedly.  He drinks heavily to dull his longing for other men (including Luzhin) and his pain at being a disappointment to his formidable father.    The story unfolds from there. Mortensen, as is his wont, turns in a fine performance (it earned him a Best Actor Oscar nomination) as the disciplined Luzhin, carefully navigating the treacherous waters of his assignment for MI5's \\"Russian Desk\\".  Mortensen is gifted with languages and his Russian-inflected English sounds authentic.  Cassel, as mentioned before, is excellent as the swaggering but anguished Kiril, the crime family heir.  Naomi Watts, as the midwife, Anna, is weaker - squeezed between Mortensen's suppressed intensity and Cassel's histronic performance, she comes across as bland.  Even when she confronts Kiril about his grandfather's role in Tatiana's rape and death outside the restaurant, there is a curious lack of emotional force.  Mortensen can offer understatement because it is supported by suggested reserves of intensity - Watts doesn't have those reserves and can't.  And, except for the beginning of the film, we never see her delivering another baby: she only appears in medical garb walking the corridors of the hospital, or hovering overthe orphaned baby's crib.  Speaking of which, there is never an explanation of WHY the baby appears to be living permanently in the pediatric ward of the hospital, when we all know that child protective services would have removed the baby within a week at the outside.  This is just one of the many narrative holes that the director asks the viewer to take on faith, perhaps because he felt that with a cast this charismatic and a decent premise, he didn't have to bother plugging those holes.  But the holes rend gaps in the narrative's conceit and interrupt the viewer's immersion in it.  It's just laziness and there is no excuse for it.  Nevertheless, the cast is worth watching at least once, all good to excellent.  Mueller-Stahl, I must say, is believable as the jovial restaurant owner, as the brains of the mob, and as the brutal tormentor of his feckless son.  But he looks about seventy and we are also asked to accept him as the man who initially raped a struggling 14-year-old Tatiana when she was brought in to work in his stable, on the spur of the moment, when Kiril couldn't quite manage it. No offense to Mr. Mueller-Stahl's \\"amour propre\\", but this was also unconvincing.    The film tries hard, but doesn't find a sure enough footing: it's not quite a film noir, or a gangster film, or a romance, or a message movie about the nasty business of sex for sale.  It ventures part way into each of those territories but never quite nails its flag to the mast with enough conviction to raise the film to memorability, which is a shame given the talented cast and possibilities.  There are simply too many aspects that don't jell together, blunting the film's capacity for emotional impact.
B000P6YNSE|5.0|I now own all three seasons of LOST. This is the best TV show on Television to date. The way they handle the charactors with flashbacks, giving us more information about them, is perfect.  I can't imagine anyone not liking this series. It seems to have something for everyone. Even if you are not a sci-fi fan, there is still something to like about LOST! I have already watched season three two times. I can't wait for January 31 when season four starts.
B0006IIPIK|4.0|Based on the trailers for this film and the reviews I expected to dislike this movie intensely.  I usually hate CGI stuff but it works here: essentially everthing in the movie is CGI, except the actors, and so they avoided 2 major problems with CGI.  CGI tends to be very unnatural when they try to use it to create people, just look at the Spiderman movies.  And when they use CGI to just past an image on the screen, like the fighter plane in the last `Die Hard' movie, then it looks hokey as well.  But in this case the CGI is used to create an entire imaginary world.<br /><br />This film takes place in a retro-fantasy world, which somehow makes it possible to believe the impossible machines and action and improbable characters.  As a fan of old movie serials, 1950's scifi, George Reeves, Buster Crabbe, Clayton Moore, cartoons, and comic books, this movie is as close to tailor-made for me as will ever be.  People with similar interests should not hesitate to see this movie, and try to count every homage or reference to a cartoon, comic strip, or movie serial.<br /><br />A few posters have criticized this film regarding a lack of character growth, blah blah blah.  Well, this is not a movie for those who want hand-wringing angst or the ambivalent meanderings of modern relationships.  This is an escapist adventure, where the story and the action are paramount, and the great mysteries of the human condition are below the surface, only occasionally hinted at.  You want that other stuff go see `Mystic River.'<br /><br />Jude Law doesn't have the appeal of George Reeves, Clayton Moore, or Buster Crabbe, but in this context he comes across as a very suitable hero, a sort of poor man's Indiana Jones.  His character is clearly a ripoff/homage to the great comic book hero of World War II, Blackhawk, and as such he does a good job.  Gwynneth Palterow is easy on the eyes and does an adequate job but is just nowhere near as compelling as Phyllis Coates, Noel Niell, or Jean Rogers were in similar roles.<br /><br />This movie is more of an adventure film than a modern `action film,' which is, IMO, a good thing.  Also, the climactic sequence gives you more to ponder than most modern adventures, and thus has a bigger payoff.s.    This movie is more of an adventure film than a modern `action film,' which is, IMO, a good thing.

0395951054|5.0|It seams odd, VERRY odd to have purchased this book. I am neither a Nazi, Neo Nazi nor simpathiser of ANY sort or degree!!!! You have NO idea  how much bull I have recieved for just haviiing it, especially from my jewish aquaintances, but I think it is IMPORTANT to learn from the past. \\"You Know Who\\" was a MONSTER, a mad MONSTER, undeniabely!!!!!!! He was, however unfortunately, also a genius!!!!!  I felt compelled to read this book in an attempt to find some degree of understanding and insight into how ANYONE could be SOOOO TWISTED, even EVIL!!!! For one man to do such things to another, let alone hundreds of thousands. His existance was a tragedy on ALL of humanity, a scar which can never be erased!!!! If humanity doesn't learn from it's mistakes it will be condemned to repeat them!!!!!!! There is knowledge in ALL things, no matter how horable and/or tragic!!!!!! LEARN!!!!!!!
B000ZM1MG4|5.0|Like \\"Moonstruck\\", \\"Some Like it Hot\\", and a very small handful of other rare gems in the comedy/satire genre, \\"Tootsie\\" is a perfect movie from the first frame to the last.  From concept to script to cast to production, the result is a flawless and often hilarious film that (like the aforementioned efforts) you will probably end up watching many times.  Sydney Pollack gets it wrong now and then (ugh, the dreadful remake of \\"Sabrina\\"!) but he often gets it right, and in this instance got it sublimely right - and that includes his own on-the-nose supporting performance as Hoffman's theatrical agent.    Dustin Hoffman, in a brilliant and unforgettable performance, plays Michael Dorsey, the gifted but cranky and out-of-work actor who, in desperation, disguises himself as a mature character actress to land a lucrative role in a television soap opera.  Michael's success and growing nationwide fame in the role, however, generate a host of unforeseen problems, not least his growing passion for the soap opera's leading lady (Jessica Lange), whose father (the inimitable Charles Durning) develops a parallel passion for the \\"actress\\" he thinks his daughter works with.  Eventually, Michael begins racking his brains for a way to get out of his contract without sending his agent and himself to prison for fraud.  His solution, revealed toward the end of the film, has become a classic scene.  Along the way, gender inequality is slyly and cleverly explored, but the issue is never used to beat the viewer over the head.  The message and the narrative are seamlessly entwined.    A faultless supporting cast, headed by Bill Murray as Hoffman's playwright roommate, Teri Garr as Michael's despairing protegee, and Dabney Coleman as the obnoxious, chauvinist television director, make substantial contributions to the delightful experience that this movie is with performances that could have been two-dimensional, but aren't.  Funny and touching, this film deserved its nearly instantaneous rankas a classic.
B000X1Z0BU|5.0|This is a quiet little movie that sneaks up on the viewer and warms the heart like a smooth sip of Irish whisky. Upon first viewing you will be enchanted by the subtle story telling and honest performances of the cast. But upon successive viewings (and honestly... how often have you purchased a film that you've wanted to watch over and over again? This is one you will!) you'll notice added detail and hints along the way to the very satisfying conclusion. A wonderful film of depth and subtly with strong performances and of course an amazing sound track you'll want to listen to over and over again. This movie is for anyone who likes Music, Ireland, Love, and the complications and messiness of finding and keeping the right person.

Elements of the government use him to set up an assignation. The ex-marine solves the mystery. The action races to the end and you don't know what's going to happen next. A great special effects action movie with a very satisfying ending. Finally, I must say that this movie looks fantastic in HD. Not all HD movies are of equal quality but this one practically leaps from the screen with vivid color, depth and clarity.
0783225857|5.0|This is a turly classic film that has been universally recognized as one of the greatest films of all time. It is told from the eyes of a young girl named \\"Scout\\", the 6 year old daughter of a county lawyer, Atticus Finch.  Mary Badham marvelously plays \\"Scout\\", a Tom-boy, who with her brother \\"Jem\\", and friend \\"Dill\\" witness the events that swept them into the eye of the hurricane of racial hatred.  While the three children are consumed by the rumors about their mysterious neighbor, \\"Boo\\" Radley, Scout's father, Atticus Finch, prepares to defend the black man, Tom Robinson, who has been accused of raping a white girl.  Gregory Peck is absolutley fabulous as Atticus Finch.  Peck nails the character of Atticus the lawyer who defends the wrongfully accused black man of raping a white woman in the deep racial South in 1935. The outcome of the trial was a given, guilty; yet, Atticus courageously stands up to the prejudicial all-white jury and angrilly demands them to find the courage to stand up for the truth and set free an innocent man.  Yet, the social rules of the time demanded a guilty verdict and it was brought.  Robinson despairs and breaks away during a transfer and is shot and killed.  All seems lost, and Atticus and his children despair.  But the end is not yet. Bob Euell, the father of the girl who claimed rape has a hatred of Atticus that cannot be quenched even by the death of Robinson.  He blindly hates Atticus for daring to take the opinion of a black man over a white man.  Since he does not have the courage to face Atticus, he instead goes after Scout and Jem.  Suddenly and unexpectedly, the children are rescued by their mysterious reclusive neighbor Arthur \\"Boo\\" Radley, who was the children's protector, despite his mental retardation.<br /><br />The movie ends in a touching scene where Scout slowly walks Boo back to his house holding his pale hand in hers.  She then returns to the secure and comforting lap of her father Atticus, who is dutifully watching over injured Jem.  In the background is a picture of Atticus' deceased wife on the mantle, (the first view we have of her).  The love of this father for his children is clearly evident in his tenderness and decency.<br /><br />Oh how this world could so richly benefit from more honorable and courageous men like Atticus Finch.<br /><br />Buy this movie and watch it once a year with your children.  As your children age, they will see the deeper social message which is the heart of the movie.<br /><br />Jim Koeniginjured Jem.

Actually, I did not appreciate it the first three times I heard it, but so many musicians from all different musical genres kept praising it, and I gave it another chance. It worked. Something in my brain clicked, and it was as if my music neurons had been re-aligned to process and \\"understand\\" the simple, original, subtle, nuanced, and brilliant tunes that make up Kind of Blue.     Well, if you like music, even if it's only \\"Happy Birthday To You\\", just buy this, make it part of your musical life, and never look back.

B000003TA4|5.0|While it both alienated the band and made an indelible mark on rock music, Nirvana's 1991 breakthrough \\"Nevermind\\" is a rock classic. Bringing Seattle's moody grunge music to the big stage, \\"Nevermind\\" succeeds on great songwriting and Kurt Cobain's character. Although about 90% of the album has become rock radio staples, it carries an independent spirit. But even with the alternative feel, the album can be loved by anyone because it has undeniable hooks and song structure. Nirvana is loud, driving, and angry as ever here, and Cobain's moodiness is a perfect match for the music. The snarling guitars seem to complement his sentiments. Despite all the talk of mutilation and death, Cobain is truly appealing; you can almost feel his pain. He is depressed and disturbed, but he is such an effective songwriter and lyricist that he's almost always understandable. \\"Nevermind\\" sounds great and somehow, through all the depressing material, is great fun.<br /><br />\\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\\" opens the album with unarguably one of the greatest songs of the 90s. The hard-rocking guitars, well-toned verses, and Cobain's performance made this song a classic for the ages, and the subject matter inspired a generation of rock music. The moody, midtempo \\"In Bloom\\" has an innate appeal to it, and the classic \\"Come As You Are\\" is my favorite Nirvana song, for Kurt's down-to-earth philosophy and the wonderful songwriting. \\"Breed\\" is menacing yet catchy, and \\"Lithium\\" is one of the album's best cuts. You can almost feel Kurt about to collapse under the optimism of the opening verses, and the sunny music gives way to a loud and driving hook. \\"Polly\\" is so effective because over simple guitar strums, Cobain's words are disturbed and unstable. \\"Territorial Pissings\\" is short and strong, and \\"Drain You\\" is Cobain and Nirvana at their best. \\"Lounge Act\\" and \\"Stay Away\\" boast great instrumentals and passionate performance, and \\"On a Plain\\" is immediately endearing and catchy. The album closes with the somber \\"Something in the Way,\\" a moving 20-minute (mostly silent) track.<br /><br />Legions of grunge imitators would find their way to major labels in the aftermath of \\"Nevermind,\\" and Nirvana would continue a short-lived stardom as grunge icons until Cobain's suicide. \\"Nevermind\\" is their landmark recording, and should be owned by anyone curious or new to the band. For those familiar with \\"Nevermind,\\" I recommend their follow-up [[ASIN:B000003TAR In Utero]] and their other less well-known albums.mber \\"Something in the Way,\\" a moving 20-minute (mostly silent) track.

B000003TAW|5.0|I love Weezer's 1994 self-titled debut. At ten tracks, this is a piece of focused, irresistible pop-rock perfection. The LA quartet, led by Rivers Cuomo, emerged a universally appealing band for their pop sensibilities and underdog perspective. First of all, this is some of the plain catchiest music you'll ever hear. With the simple guitar lines but impeccable production, each song is capable of sticking with you for days at a time, even from first listen. But even the simple writing and catchy hooks don't overshadow the fact that Weezer is not only talented musicians but excellent songwriters. Weezer shows they are masters of the pop-ballad, and Cuomo is so endearing because everyone can comprehend where he's coming from in his lyrics. He is a nerdy, emotional optimist, who has problems with love and relationships just like the rest of us. \\"Weezer\\" does not have a weak spot on it, and with ten tracks is among the most immediately appealing pieces of 90s rock to be found. I highly recommend \\"Weezer\\" to all.<br /><br />With \\"My Name Is Jonas,\\" the album opens with a timeless song, which brings energy, great lyricism, and the irresistable guitar lines that pervade throughout the record. \\"No One Else\\" is an endearing, understandable and immediately catchy song. One of my favorites is \\"The World Has Turned and Left Me Here,\\" a post-breakup number with the sort of emotion that everyone can appreciate. The excellent tribute \\"Buddy Holly\\" precedes the conceptual gem \\"Undone (The Sweater Song),\\" a clever metaphor that maintains the ingenious pop sensibilities of the rest of the album. The optimistic and appealing \\"Surf Wax America\\" comes before the masterpiece \\"Say It Ain't So,\\" which from the opening bars is a classic rock song, the one that made me want to own this album so long ago. \\"In the Garage\\" is plain lovable, a song about the awkwardness of adolescence and the haven of garage rock. \\"Holiday\\" and the eight-minute closer \\"Only in Dreams\\" end the album perfectly.<br /><br />This album is a perfect blend of catchy hooks, musical artistry, and lovable lyricism. Weezer's debut set the stage for their long and fruitful career, but despite their other fine LPs I feel they have yet to top their wonderful debut. Regardless of your musical leanings, there's no doubt you can get into this album. I highly suggest a purchase to everyone.um is a perfect blend of catchy hooks, musical artistry, and lovable lyricism.

B000068LB5|4.0|\\"Battle Royale\\" was much talked-about in the United States back in 2001, but it took a while to get here, allegedly because distributors were reluctant to promote 2 hours of teenagers on a killing spree. The film is based on the popular Japanese novel by Koushun Takami, whose considerable length condenses surprisingly well to a fast-paced feature film. In a dystopian future, Japan is at risk of societal collapse from high unemployment, economic stagnation, and general discontent. Youth bully their teachers and boycott school. The \\"BR Act\\" is passed, authorizing the government to select classes of 9th graders to be confined to a deserted island and forced to fight each other to the death until only one student remains.<br /><br />Shuya (Tatsuya Rujiwara) is a thoughtful young man who lost both of his parents to Japan's bad times. On a class trip, he and his classmates are drugged, transported to the island where they will be forced to take part in the Battle Royale, and fitted with electronic collars that monitor their movements. Their bombastic teacher Kitano (Beat Takeshi) explains the rules of the game and distributes a survival kit and one weapon to each of the 42 students, including 2 mysterious \\"exchange students\\". If more than one person survives 3 days, they all die. We follow Shuya and his friend Noriko (Aki Maeda) as they come to grips with their situation and try to survive with the aid of Kawada (Taro Yamamoto), an older student whose purpose is not at first clear.<br /><br />The film strays from the book in some details but is substantively similar. We don't get to know the secondary characters as well, so questions of trust are not as complex as in the book. The instructor Kitano is fleshed out more in the film and comes across as a lonely and strangely pathetic man. It's interesting to observe how the various personalities react to the game, from the young lovers who commit suicide to the sickle-wielding vamp Mitsuko (Kou Shibasaki) who is determined to win. The politics behind the \\"BR Act\\" is simplified and more coherent in the film. Adults fear youth, because their refusal to accept the values of their elders will exacerbate social collapse. The \\"BR Act\\" forces young people to compete ruthlessly or perish. Kitano's sick sense of humor provides comic relief. \\"Battle Royale\\" is a bloody, unsubtle satire, but it's entertaining.litics behind the \\"BR Act\\" is simplified and more coherent in the film.

The diagrams and measurements were confussing but I was able to get some ideas and was able to use doll patterns I had and adjust them to the configurations in the book. Wasn't an easy matter however.  As a pleasent book to view and reflect on the fashions of that day and for ideas it was very nice. As an actual workable book for dressmaking I found it confussing and I've sewn for over 50 years.  Still in all, worth the price for the lovely designs.
1582701709|4.0|I bought this book for my mother who is currently incarcerated.  She was at absolute rock bottom, and because of this book she is a changed woman.  She is now looking foward to her release (which will be soon, I hope) and has a new \\"positive\\" outlook on life.  This book is for anyone who has ever needed a hug, or just that little kick of motivation. *****!
B000WQW988|5.0|Nirvana was one of, if not the most influential bands of the 1990's decade.  There \\"Unplugged\\" taping showed that they were not only a band that could play loud and with conviction but could express there point of view in a softer, acoustic form.  This performance truly shows the range of a band that was the poster childs for the \\"grunge\\" movement but expressed them in a way that shows how this band was much more than just a grunge band.  With Kurt Cobain's telling lyrics and the conhesiveness of it's members Nirvana will go down in history as one of the great bands.  This performance DVD shows why.
0307387178|5.0|this book is for anyone who belives you don't have to follow the crowd.  for anyone who has an imiganation and has desired to explore life \\"outside the box\\".
B000Q6GUW0|5.0|This is one of the best, most innovative series I've seen in a long time.  The acting is superb, the writing is superb; and to find yourself liking and  actually rooting for a serial killer is so twisted and unexpected that it is actually a gleeful, guilty pleasure!  I recommend this wonderfully off-kilter series to all adults with a dark sense of humor, and an appreciation for a well-done production.
B000Y1ZXU2|4.0|This DVD is incredible. The documentary with images of Adam working on Predator/Jurassic Park, etc. it's amazing. Most of them I've never seem before.  Then we have a little tour on CoSM. It's like \\"WOW, I must go there!\\".  The Vicarious video itself is a masterpiece, obviously. The combination of Jones and Grey it's always perfect. We waited more than a year, but it's not a disappoinment, for sure.
B000VNMMR0|4.0|Bruce Willis is back on top with this 4th sequel of the Die Hard series.<br />Lots of action scenes, good plot and even the villain looked and acted sick enough to be scary. This is the type of movie I don't mind watching over and over, maybe a couple of times a year.
B000HT3P7E|5.0|How I Met Your Mother is an excellent series that uses flashbacks to tell its story. All five of the major characters bring unique aspects to the series. It is well worth buying as it can be re watched over and over while still being hilarious.

B00005JPXY|4.0|Ever since I was about 4, I have been a diehard fan of giant monster movies. Godzilla, of course, was my favorite. I have fond memories of going to Hastings to rent another monster movie almost each week. As I grew older, my appreciation never ceased, but I began to long for a big-budget American monster movie. My wish kind of came true.    That \\"wish come true\\" came in the form of Dean Devlin and Roland Emmerich's [[ASIN:0767817478 Godzilla]] starring Matthew Broderick. Yes, the movie was a multi-million dollar American film. Yes, the main monster was Godzilla. No, it wasn't very good at all. Godzilla (or GINO) wasn't about an almost-indestructible monster wreaking havoc in New York and striking fear into the hearts of horrified victims. It was an over-sized lizard that just wanted to be left alone, so it could lay its eggs. As a film by itself, it was okay, but as a \\"Godzilla movie\\", it was an insult.    After that, no one in America even TRIED to touch a monster movie. It was left to the Japanese again, as well as Korea who began to experiment on the genre, to make the monster movies. Over the next decade, many good and succesful (and bad and unsuccesful) monster movies were released, such as [[ASIN:B00003CXLS Godzilla 2000]], [[ASIN:B0000VAGXU Godzilla, Mothra and King Ghidorah - Giant Monsters All-Out Attack]], Godzilla's 50th Anniversary film [[ASIN:B000BMY2L0 Godzilla - Final Wars]], the recent Korean film [[ASIN:B000YDOOEQ Dragon Wars]], and the much-more-succesful [[ASIN:B000PKG8TW The Host]]. With newly-growing interest in the U.S. (and even an American theatrical run of Dragon Wars), the time was ripe for another attempt in the U.S.    It started with a trailer attached to the new live-action Transformers film. The trailer showed the general skeleton of the beginning of the film and did not reveal its name, only saying that it was a new film from J.J. Abrams and \\"1-18-08\\". Many viral sites and further speculation of what the title could be quickly broughtthe hype to unbelievable heights. But one thing was certain: it was the first giant monster movie to be made in America in 10 years and that was reason to see no matter what the title.     \\"Cloverfield\\" is finally here and this is what I thought about it:    ***SPOILER WARNING***    First off, one of the biggest aspects is the fact that the entire movie is shown through a standard home video camera. I would like to say that I have never seen \\"The Blair Witch Project\\", so I wasn't distracted by comparing the two, like many others seemed to have been. Those that may not have enjoyed The Bourne Ultimatum's shaky camera will hate this move. I went to see this with two friends and one was fine, but the other got nauseated and left the theater even before the 1/3 mark. This didn't bother me too much, having a very strong stomach, but after a while, even I felt a little weird. So those of you who have weak stomachs, at least wait until it comes out on DVD.    The next aspect I want to point out is (what else) the monster. Now this is the reason I didn't give this movie 5 stars. Through most of the movie, the monster remains hidden and when his full profile does show up, blink and you'll miss it. When a few good shots finally showed the full monster, I kind of wished it had stayed hidden. I didn't think it looked very imposing, as I thought it would at first. To counter some of those rumors that the monster was an enourmous walking whale, they were WAY off. The monster is basically a giant spider monkey with no fur, gills and a reptillian tail. It did, however, remind me of some of the more outlandish Japanese inventions from back in the day, so maybe that's what Abrams was shooting for. Much more frightening though, were the creature's offspring. It was these that brought all of the horror aspects to the movie. They were much more spider-like than the giant \\"queen\\" and for some reason reminded me of Shelob from the \\"Lord of the Rings\\". Their reproductive system also reminded me of the horror film \\"Alien\\".    Next up, the plot...okay so maybe there isn't much to it. A guy by the name of Rob gets a surprise going away party the night before he leaves to go to Japan. The party is crashed, however, by a giant monster that emerges from the ocean and attacks Manhattan. There you go. The fact that there isn't really a plot makes sense, however, since a dude that just happens to have a camcorder isn't going to try to make an all-out epic film with a plot and all around something that is happening at this very moment. The movie really acts like it really happened, complete with a prologue and epilogue saying that this footage is government property and was found in \\"former Central Park\\". Overall, I think this could serve as a good \\"prologue\\" film for a much longer possible series. This theory is better supported after the credits, with a garbled radio transmition that, when said backwards, means \\"it's still alive\\".    Like [[ASIN:B000FA4TLQ Gojira / Godzilla]]before it, this film simbolizes the fears that the country has recently experienced. Godzilla represented the fears of the nuclear bomb, while \\"Cloverfield\\" represents the recent 9/11 attack and the fear of another attack. Much of the destruction, I noticed, resembled what was seen on that fateful day, complete with a lot of flying dust and bewildered people lulling around the streets.    If you're a fan of monster movies and don't care about shaky cameras, see this movie NOW! It was very much worth the ticket price and I walked out, hoping that \\"Cloverfield\\" would receive enough praise and money to inspire a sequel (which so far, it's going along the right track).

B000P0J024|4.0|It had been years since I played my old Traveling Wilburys records on LP. I recently viewed the Tom Petty DVD biography and enjoyed the private film shot back in the day of Tom Petty, Bob Dylan, George Harrison, Jeff Lynne and Roy Orbison sitting around each others homes playing music and seemingly having the time of their lives.<br /><br />This is a nice package that will make a listener appreciate the masters that each of these artists are, and if you bought these on vinyl originally, the better sound of this CD package and bonus DVD will be a great suprise. If you never heard the Traveling Wilburys but are fans of these men or just curious, you cannot go wrong. It is simply timeless music made by some of the best artists of all time.<br /><br />When you consider the fact that this was a side project for these guys, including a  former Beatle, it is hard not to be moved. George Harrison in particular was at a creative high at this time and sounds passionate and full of love.

0618918248|4.0|I have seen this argument so many times over the past 40 years; it's as if each new generation has to condemn God to find its own soul. I myself wrote a poem in college once, \\"Our Father, who art in hell....\\" You can imagine the sophomoric rest.<br /><br />There are so many other reviews, I want to use this space to highlight three ideas, point to one posted image, and link to several books that demonstrate that Mike Huckabee has it exactly right: we need God (not the high priests that steal our money to live lavishly) as a foundation for the community of man, as an absolute measure of our morality.<br /><br />Idea #1: God is or should be a moral standard. Fundamentalists of any stripe that claim to be the sole religion, calling all others unbelievers or heathen or worse, are nothing more than a cult.<br /><br />Idea #2: Religions are bad in so far as they incite hatred toward others or enrich a few at enormous cost to the many. We do not need intermediaries nor do we need interpreters. God loves us all (including Adolph Hitler and Dick Cheney) and God's love is immutable. We are what we are, and within God's love, we must simply strive to be better, longer.<br /><br />Idea #3: Engineers and scientists have a very hard time understanding any constructive role for religion. E. O. Wilson has answered the question, \\"why do the sciences need the humanities,\\" and I will sum it up in one word: Humanitas. There is a spiritual, artistic, ethical, quantum aspect to life that is often best explained through either myths or conventions.<br /><br />Here are ten books that have informed my appreciation for God, whom I found again, very strongly in my life, six months ago, when everything started going in the direction that I had been struggling to achieve for twenty years, not for myself, but for my children and the future of life.<br /><br />01 [[ASIN:0399153292 The Complete Conversations with God (Boxed Set)]] The Bible is useful as a point of departure. It is not a substitute for being right with God, direct.<br /><br />02 [[ASIN:1567310249 The Lessons of History]] Morality is a strategic asset of incalculable proportions (a Nobel Prize was awarded in the 1990's to a man who proved that trust lowers the cost of doing business).<br /><br />03 [[ASIN:B000NNXX30 The Left Hand of God: Taking Back Our Country from the Religious Right]] Rabbi Lerner's book touched me deeply. God is code for compassion, for doing the right thing, for avoiding partisan and fanatic differentiation.<br /><br />04 [[ASIN:B000VYVLR6 God's Politics LP]] Buy this used, I hope it is reprinted. Religion is like a gun--it is the person who chooses between an exclusive \\"true believer\\" role that is hateful, or an inclusive compassion that is respectful of all. I end my review saying he has my vote for Chaplain to the Nation.<br /><br />05 [[ASIN:0195160894 Faith-Based Diplomacy: Trumping Realpolitik]] The author is a Navy Captain (O-6) Retired, I know him, and he taught me that faith is a tangible value that can be demonstrated in a peaceful respectful manner, and doing so yields enormous dividends when negotiating or interacting with those whose faith is strong but different.<br /><br />06 [[ASIN:1571782109 Thank God for Evolution!: How the Marriage of Science and Religion Will Transform Your Life and Our World]] This is a joyous and worthy celebration of how to deconflict religion and science.<br /><br />07 [[ASIN:1400031915 Dogs of God: Columbus, the Inquisition, and the Defeat of the Moors]] I am often shocked by how little the average American knows of history, to include our genocide of the Native Americans, the Puritan exorcism of women as witches, the Catholic Church's inquisition, the crusades, and their all too eager collaboration with the Nazis in administering the Holocaust.

B00080ZG10|3.0|Good job of props, casting and acting however this movie tends to trivialize the life of a great man. I felt it should have spent more time on his vast acomplishments and less time on his physical/mental ailments which only became apparent in his later years, not early on as the film seems to suggest. I know, because my Grand Father worked with him on the HK-1 (Spruce Goose).

B000YXMMAE|3.0|the best music on this lp is in this order: 15step,bodysnatchers,jigsaw...,faust arp,reckoner,arpeggi,house of cards,all i need,big ideas,videotape; yes,have 2 say videotape is the worst. the first 6 r the best of course. the hvy ones r the first 3; the rest r mellow. very average lp; around a \\"5\\" out of 10 rating, give or take. Actually one of the hardest of their stuff to play on guitar. to me, 15step is (like hipbop/rap) beat meets rock. they're  doing there moderately elaborate, mellow style again. Wish they'd put cd2, of the box set, on this 1 lp for 1 complete cd & included \\"big boots or man o war which is the best version i heard them producing on meeting people is easy video; this song would have really dressed this cd up further. there's a live rock, entirely different version of reckoner they've done. To me their best stuff is their heavier/colorful, classic/ballad rock style of the past they could still probably do a lil more again in the future-this'd be cool/nice. its just an ok lp that goes w/ a cloudy, rainy, or sunny cool day,(not a hurricane cuz that'd be like metalrock i.e.). Its a mildly sweet, less noisy lp. I like \\"faust arp\\"-sounds like paul mccartney mellow beatles acoustic. I like their live \\"big ideas\\" version, for its more like a rock song. \\"reckoner\\" is a sweet song. most of these songs also have a late 60's hippie sound.

B0010YSD7M|2.0|This was pretty much like a normal bad SG1 episode from season 10.  It is not loaded with special effects nor is the acting anything worth ranting about.  The clip you see on Amazon with Tealc is about the best acting scene in the whole movie (Hence why its on Amazon).<br /><br /> The overall story is completely rushed, you get the feeling that the producers where saying (We have 2 hours to wrap up the Ori story so Move it!)  Overal I have seen many SG1 season enders that where better than this movie so that pretty much sums it up the quality.<br />Ben Browder and Claudia once again just dominated the show with there prescence while once again giving lack luster performances that nobody will ever care about.  Save your money and wait for this to come on TV.  It was truly a disapointing boring story even for die hard SG1 Fans like me, one of the first times I ever watched a SG1 episode and kept looking at my watch hoping the 2 hours was up.
B000ICL3KG|1.0|This DVD should be awarded the \\"Lenie Riefenstahl Award\\" for propaganda rather than an Oscar!

I hope we wake up quickly before we destroy our nation with a useless wild goose chase.

How can you leave out these emotion filled tunes??? I wish they would've made this a 2-CD collection. Just about all of the tracks from Rocky I should be included because it gave the audience an emotional picture about Rocky's life and what he was going through. Oh well, not to shabby but could've been great! I gotta go work out now.....that's what these tunes do to you.
B00125JP1C|2.0|This movie wants to be a comedy, but it's not funny. It wants to be an  action movie, but it's all mindless action and you don't care one way or another. It wants to be a crime thriller, but you don't identify with the characters or any meaningful motive for the crime as it tries to be funny at the same time, you just can't take any of it seriously. This movie wants to be a Bugs Bunny cartoon, but other than the carrot, everything else is missing here. I gave it too stars instead of just one, because it kept me sitting through all that non-sense regardless. I now only have no one but myself to blame for wasting time and money on this movie. I think the main characters are capable of doing better, but some all encompassing force is preventing that from happening.
B000VWYJ86|4.0|This is a great movie to sit and watch.  Usually sequels are not all that great but I have to admit that these were somewhat of a surprise.  It is loaded with action and a good plot as well.  Sit down and watch all 3 so you can see how the story comes together.  Matt Damon delivers a great performance as usual.

I had no idea that before it there was a TV show called firefly.  The TV show is like a movie in itself.  If you haven't seen the TV show which is not on anymore but you can still see this movie an be ok.  This movie can be confusing at first but the more times you watch it the more sense it will start to make.  I do recommend that you watch the show but if you don't them you can still understand the movie.
B000XUOIQ4|5.0|The Aristocats is another favorite from Walt Disney productions.  The story is cute the characters are phenomenal and the voice talents are beyond exceptional.  You will enjoy the story as well as the music.  Sit back and have fun watching this with the kids, grand kids or in my home with the hubby.  Your never too old to enjoy a Disney Classic.
B000LW7UR8|5.0|I love there cover of Kate bush's running up that hill and that was the main reason for me buying this cd.  I never would have realized how great the other songs on this cd are.  This I have to admit is one of my favorite cd by them.
B0002ZDVEU|4.0|This movie is a great sequel to Bourne Identity.  You will enjoy the whole story line and love the action as well.  Sit down and watch all 3 of the movies together and don't forget the popcorn.  Matt Damon turns out a surprising performance.
B000Z0OX9O|5.0|Torcon 3, the 61st World Science Fiction Convention in Toronto in 2003, conducted a poll of its members to determine the top science-fiction films of the 20th Century. \\"2001: A Space Odyssey\\" came in 1st. \\"Blade Runner\\" came in 2nd. Snippets of dialog from the film are scattered thruout this CD's musical excerpts from the soundtrack and help bring the movie back to life.    \\"I've ... SEEN things, things you wouldn't believe.\\"
B00023B1LC|4.0|You must sit down and watch this with all three movies together.  A way to spend the day when you don't have much else to do.  Grab a few steaks have a barbeque with some friends and have a movie marathon.
0439813786|2.0|Paris 1931 - Twelve-year old Hugo Cabret lives in a secret apartment above a train station, keeping its 27 clocks running smoothly and accurately, just as his uncle taught him before disappearing several months earlier. Stealing food and toy parts to repair an automaton, he is caught and forced to work in a toy maker's shop where he meets the man's goddaughter, Isabelle, also an orphan. But not before the toy maker confiscates Hugo's father's notebook of sketches. Together, although not always harmoniously, the children try to solve the mystery of the device and the drawing it was designed to create. When Hugo becomes too disabled to maintain the clocks properly, it is a race against time for the two to figure things out before the stationmaster does.<br /><br />Although the \\"one hundred and fifty-eight different pictures,\\" are unusual in quantity and use, not all are value added. The black framing around the pages is different but distracting, and the book is unnecessarily large due to the fact that many of the pages are only partially filled with text. Wondering what the automaton will produce is the high point, but about halfway through, when that it is revealed, the intrigue falls away as quickly as the pieces of the puzzle fall neatly into place. In addition, the reader is left hanging about the cause of the fire and the fate of Hugo's mother (never even mentioned). And except for the fifth, the meaning of these (apparent) clues (from p 299 and 362) are left unexplained: \\"[a]n empty box, a dry ocean, a lost monster\\" and \\"a wingless bird, a burned-up building, a splinter, a fly, a grain of sand.\\" An author thinking, writing and sketching \\"outside the box\\" is a welcome change, but neither the drawings nor the plot result in The Inventions of Hugo Cabret being much more than an average story with sketches uniquely used in its telling. Better: J. K. Rowlings' Harry Potter series and Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events series.
1569242739|5.0|This is a must have book for the collection. I love the mixture of basic to seriously gourmet recipes.
B000FDFVZ6|4.0|The book is written from the view of the murdered child which is so unlike any book written before.  The entire pros make you stop and think of the feelings of the child and the way the child leads everyone in the direction she wants them to go, this time it is all done the child's way.  I have never read a more upsetting, yet inticing book in my life.  I read this book in one read on a flight from Columbia, SC to Rochester, MN.  It is a page turner and then when it is over you wonder how anyone ever harms an innocent little girl.
B0002IU988|5.0|This CD kicks A**!! Alter Bridge blows Creed away, much harder and metal sounding. I Love Myles' voice and Mark is an underrated guitarist. Saw them in concert after this CD released and they rock live also.
B00003CXAA|5.0|The product came quickly and was the perfect gift for my boyfriend.  He loves it!!
B000VKJ6VS|5.0|It took me a few listens before I really started to like this CD for some reason. I love this CD now, Alter Bridge is the best.....
B000VAPZM2|5.0|I obtain this title for my grandchildren.  It seems that they never growth tired of watching it over and over again!  So it must be pretty good.
B000N6TYLW|5.0|I have loved the Gilore Girls since they came out. It was too bad that the show ended... However, this final set of episodes was great. Great buy!
B0000DIJO2|5.0|This is a great movie my only complaint is that it wasnt long enough the Bee Gees have a sound of their own and a stage presance that is incomprable its a shame that we will only be able to enjoy their past accomplishments the quality of the movie is fantastic and you seem to be there I listened through a surround sound system and really enjoyed it
B00005Y46O|3.0|From what I had read, I thought I'd get more enjoyment out of this package.  The first time I heard this album, I was shocked at the number of glowing reviews regarding Paul Rodgers' voice.  His voice is badly shot on several of these tracks.  However, some of them are really amazing, such as \\"Ride on a Pony.\\"  However, with the exception of \\"Trouble on Double,\\" I'd have to say that the extra tracks don't really sit well alongside the original tracks from the album, and that I didn't receive any new \\"revelations\\" that the box set didn't offer.  Actually, I have the box set \\"Molten Gold\\" and I'd say it's a better purchase.  Not like this album is terrible, but if you like gruff voices that actually work, given this kind of material, perhaps Paul wasn't old enough to pull it off throughout the show and you can probably get more mileage out of Roger Daltrey and Rod Stewart.  You can hear echoes of both of those artists here, but they are much stronger throated.  I wouldn't say skip this, but you can get better live albums from the era for the money.
630463949X|5.0|I have seen fleetwood mac in person and didnt feel as close to the performers as I did watching their video , the movie has great sound and picture quality and is a must for Fleetwood Mac fans
B00005JO9J|5.0|Obviously, you'd have to be a Grey's Anatomy fan to get into this package, because it chronicles the whole first season.  I wasn't into the show heavily at that point; my ex got me into it as it progressed that year, but I do remember a few of these episodes from first-run, and I like having this collection around, on the days that are not Thursday and I want to see a classic episode of this show.  One thing: I haven't seen Addison yet, as I don't think she appeared until season 2.  No Callie either; she didn't appear until Season 3.  This may not be for fans of Season 4 (current season), which is WAY different in tone than these DVDs.  At this time, a few years ago, I thought this was the best show on TV ever.  Due to some of the cast reshuffling, I no longer feel that way, as I do feel the quality has declined quite a bit (seasons 1-3 were the best, and I'd rate season 4 as 6/10, with some episodes rated as less than that).  The \\"emotional\\" factor is still there, occasionally, and it is probably heavier than it was in season 1, where they were just defining who the characters were, but I'd definitely say give seasons 1-3 a spin before getting into the post-Burke era, which doesn't seem to be their strongest.  Last point: in watching these episodes, it is clear to me that Burke (Isaiah Washington) is sorelly missed, as he was pretty much the \\"star\\" of the show at this time.  Case in point is the season 4 \\"let go of the dress\\" episode, which was just rerun.  That is one of the all time worst episodes in Grey's history.  Also, you may want to keep in mind, as you watch these episodes from season 1, that the show was part of the Sunday ABC lineup at the time, bookended by \\"Desperate Housewives.\\"  I personally thought this was the best pairing in the show's history, and you can't tell me the pairing with Grey's and \\"Big Shots\\" is better, because \\"Big Shots\\" needs to be cancelled asap.
1596680296|5.0|Great book to learn how to knit socks.  Well written, easy to follow, great patterns.  Brilliantly colored pictures, and a variety of skill levels.  Well worth the cost and even if you aren't at sock level, great for your library.
1582701709|4.0|I was postponing taking even a peak at this movie until now because I disliked the idea that the movie is referring to the Law of Attraction as \\"the Secret\\".  Not only is it referred to in the Bible, but has been known to small groups of people from the beginning of time.  Many people are familiar with the Law of Attraction and many have used it - but when I think of the bigger picture, there are still countless people who are not familiar with the Law of Attraction and even among those who are, most still don't know how to use it.<br /><br />As I read other people's comments, I see that some people look at challenging experiences in their lives and in other people's lives, and they are sure they have never \\"asked\\" for it. Most of the time we do not \\"ask\\" consciously and many challenging situations were designed even before we got into these bodies - not as punishments but because they provide opportunities for learning experiences - some of which may be to push us to dig deeper within and get more intimately acquainted with the Infinite Power of the Spirit Within through which we can overcome challenges that come our way.<br /><br />Some people also seem to think that it is enough to have one positive thought, but the truth is that we are always experiencing the effects of our predominant thoughts.  If someone spends five or 30 minutes a day focusing on prosperity and then spends another 23 hours worrying about the bills - through that worry, he is in effect programming into his subconscious the idea that he desires to be poor - he is then \\"asking\\" to be poor.<br /><br />We are creatures of habit and while sometimes we can change our perception of the world or of a particular situation in an instant and experience instant change (I know of many people who have experienced a burst of prosperity almost immediately when they opened themselves to the idea of prosperity) but it often takes time for the person to get used to this new way of being and living.  Persistance pays off.<br /><br />Throughout history all religions were teaching people to have faith and even in the Bible it is said that \\"faith is the substance of things not yet seen\\", but there are countless people who say that they belong to this or that religion or faith, who when someone suggests that they demonstrate that faith in action, when someone suggests that they can do anything they put their hearts and minds to, would rather stone those who dare to suggest such a thing and call them liars, manipulators, devils and God knows what, rather than ever even attempting to use the God-given power within - consciously to create the life they would enjoy living.<br /><br />In spite of all the marketing gigs associated with this movie, if more people become inspired to actually use the power of their minds to better their lives, then this movies has fulfilled its purpose.<br /><br />There is another side to manifesting, though, and that is asking not just for material things, but for divine understanding.  I do not belong to any religion, but I do appreciate some nuggets of wisdom from the Bible - one of them being that above all things one should first seek divine understanding.  Material things most certainly make life comfortable, but there is more to life than things that eventually rot and perish.  Taking some time each day to get intimately acquainted with one's own Divine Spirit, and seeking guidance even when manifesting things may help one to create that which will make his life fulfilling and not just filled with material things.ut history all religions were teaching people to have faith and even in the Bible it is said that \\"faith is the substance of things not yet seen\\", but there are countless people who say that they belong to this or that religion or faith, who when someone suggests that they demonstrate that faith in action, when someone suggests that they can do anything they put their hearts and minds to, would rather stone those who dare to suggest such a thing and call them liars, manipulators, devils and God knows what, rather than ever even attempting to use the God-given power within - consciously to create the life they would enjoy living.

0553208845|3.0|Well what can I say... This book was a life changing one. Once touched by it you kind of see the world in a different light. Siddhartha is well written and really does fuel your immagination not to mention it is quite a short book so there fore not that taxing. On the subject matter; I genuinly felt as if (if for only a brief momment) like I had been given small glimpse Of \\"Ohm\\" just enough to let you see how calm and peaceful the mind really can be. A great story that leaves you feeling humble but content with your place in the world. I recommend this book to any one who is struggling with consequences and pace of modern life :-)
B000NA2BEU|5.0|TO BE ABLE TO SEE THIS AFTER CABLE QUIT CARRYING THE CHANNEL WAS JUST GREAT. TO SEE THE OL TEAM BACK IN ACTION AGAIN WAS GREAT. A COUPLE OF PEOPLE GAINED A LITTLE WEIGHT DIDN'T THEY.

B000W9EOEC|5.0|This album is a \\"must have\\" for all Daft Punk fans.  For those who have never gotten the opportunity to see Daft Punk perform live, this is the next best thing. One thing that I really like about this live album is that you actually hear the music, loud, crisp and clear.  Yes, there is some crowd noise, but it's not overbearing like some live show albums can be.
B000P6YNSE|5.0|GREAT DVD - although I purchased it in time to arrive the next day, and it did came two days later unfortunately.     Great DVD and great condition though.
B000M3452Y|5.0|If you like their first album, you'll love this one. Possibly the best album release of the year.
B000059TEQ|3.0|There was to much profanity. The story itself is good. When I saw it on the TV years ago I didn't remember all of the use of profanity. If I had I wouldn't have order it.
B00005JPXY|5.0|After months of media hype, the J.J. Abrams-produced \\"Cloverfield\\" finally hit theaters, and the movie definitely delivers. \\"Cloverfield\\" is, without a doubt, the best monster flick yet made! I won't go into details about the plot, but it is very intense, exciting, and quite scary at times, with good performances from a terrific cast. The use of a P.O.V. style of film-making makes this film all the more believable.<br />I won't go into detail about the main monster, except to say that it is fantastic! The only spoiler I have is this: along with the main monster, there are also hundreds of little creatures, and they are terrifying to behold as well! This film definitely puts \\"Godzilla\\" to shame. This is a terrific film that fans of sci-fi, horror, and monster films will want to see! One of the best ever made!<br />Grade: A+
B000KQGX1Y|5.0|This music appeals to almost everyone.  Delightful and inspiring.  Even my 4 year old granddaughter has learned to sing along with many of these wonderul Irish songs. When we saw them in concert she danced in the aisle and has decided to learn to play the violin (fiddle)
B000NA2BEU|5.0|This third and last season was thought provoking, emotional, well-written, and fun.   I really enjoyed it and wished there were a 4th season.  Loved the relationship between father and daughter and Veronica and friends.  And Dick is a hoot!!!!

It's a real joy to see the attention to detail and whimsy in this Spiderwick field guide. I haven't read the Spiderwick chronicles myself, but this book is a must-have for the wonderful artwork.

Amazon had new dvds at a reasonable price, and I received the movies before Christmas. Thank You Amazon, you are my favorite shopping site on the Web.
B00004RF8J|5.0|I love this movie, I can't help myself.  It's silly and corny and campy and all of the things that make a b movie a b movie; but it's still great fun to watch.

B00124LFQ6|5.0|Wrapped in a snug fold-out digipak, this Rhino re-issue of Bee Gees Horizontal is a wonder to behold. Being the second album by the three brothers, Rhino has beautifully remastered the original into one CD that has all the original twelve songs in Stereo and Mono. These are different sounding recordings and not simply Stereo condensed into Mono. Classics like, \\"World\\" and their first #1 hit in the U.K., \\"Massachusetts\\" is given new life.<br /><br />Disc 2 contains fantastic Alternate Versions and previously unreleased material. Compare \\"Swan Song\\" or \\"Really And Sincerely\\" to the original takes. Also included on album for the first time are singles, \\"Words\\", \\"Barker Of The UFO\\", \\"Sinking Ships\\" and \\"Sir Geoffrey Saved The World\\". Other new delights are the vibrant, \\"Out Of Line\\" and \\"Ring My Bell\\". Eastern influence is obvious on \\"Deeply, Deeply Me\\" and the second CD concludes with two Christmas songs, the second being a medley never before released. With 37 songs and a running time of nearly 100 minutes, this is a long awaited release. \\"Massachusetts\\" went to #11 on the Billboard Charts and #1 in the U.K. (Their first #1!). The album hit #12 in the USA! Also includes a colorful booklet packed with trivia, history, album and single photos as well as comments from Barry and Robin Gibb.
B000001GQJ|5.0|Any work performed by Martha Argerich is sure to be an enriching experience.   Her awesome talent for the piano and her in depth understanding of the music she chooses to perform represents an artist who is interested in the music and not giving us yet another showy example of \\"greatest hits.\\"    When one listens to her interpretations of any composer, one is caught by high level of introspection, extraordinary technical facility and a love and respect for the repetoire she has chosen.    As a pianist, I have a great many CDs of various performers doing a wide range of repetoire.   Martha Argerich is consisitently miles above all of them for two main reasons.   First, she will not compromise her talent for fame or marketing issues.  Second, there is something which compels one to listen to each and every note as she is playing.  This can never be background music.    Beyond this, her personal life if one is to believe what one reads about it, is interesting and exotic and puts her in the role of those artists who combine a first-rate talent with a persona that can be termed \\"World Class Artist!\\"    Thomas Lee Randleman
B00124MCCW|5.0|At long last, the Brothers Gibb have crafted an album that surpasses all their earlier efforts. The sound is more basic (less synthesizer) and more mature (simplifying all their talents). The range is varied, but always maintains an upbeat, rock filled tempo. \\"She Keeps On Coming\\" and \\"Voice In The Wilderness\\" are amazing surprises of excellent R & B rock. Is this the Bee Gees? Even the ballads are mainstream upbeat, such as, \\"Wedding Day\\", \\"Embrace\\" and the oddly named, \\"Loose Talk, Costs Lives\\". Although, the title track has been chosen as the first single (in the rest of the World), any track could make it, (save for \\"Technicolor Dreams\\", which is a pleasant, but odd novelty song). Maurice even tops himself with the Beach Boys styled \\"Man In The Middle\\" and \\"Walking On Air\\". There are lots of surprises here and there is absolutely no way to try and pick which songs will be chosen for air-play. They are all that good.

B00124LFXY|5.0|Wrapped in a snug fold-out digipak, this Rhino re-issue of Bee Gees First is a wonder to behold. Being the first international album by the three brothers, Rhino has beautifully remastered the original into one CD that has all the original fourteen songs in Stereo and Mono. These are different sounding recordings and not simply Stereo condensed into Mono. Classics like, \\"To Love Somebody\\", \\"Holiday\\" and their first big hit \\"New York Mining Disaster 1941\\" are given new life. In fact, the latter song has four different versions included here.<br /><br />Disc 2 contains fantastic Alternate Versions and preciously unreleased material. Compare Barry's lead vocal of \\"One Minute woman\\" to Robin's take. Or compare the orchestral and instrumental differences between originals and Alternate Takes of \\"I Close My Eyes\\" and Turn Of The Century\\". It must have been a tough decision to make regarding songs choices. The Bee Gees show a remarkable sense of humor with \\"Mr. Wallor's Wailing Wall\\" and Beatle-esque perfection with \\"Gilbert Green\\" and \\"House Of Lords\\". With 42 songs and a running time of well over 100 minutes, this is a long awaited release. This album made it to #7 on the Billboard charts in 1967! Also includes a colorful booklet packed with trivia, history, album and single photos as well as comments from Barry and Robin Gibb.
B00003CXUM|5.0|In the Mood for Love has to be rated one of the best films ever made. The film is a visual feast -the art direction, lighting, sets and most of all the wardrobe are stunning. The story line  of two people meeting by chance and how in someway are forced into each others company. The main highlight of their story is the complexities of relationships and loyalties - two very profound life matters which test us on a daily basis. The actors performance is mesmerizing. There's not much dialogue and much of it is left to your interpretation.  The film's chemistry is focused in its visual presentation including the story and its dialogue - you pretty much feel like your looking through a visual and emotional kaleidoscope.
B00124MC8Q|5.0|This CD contains four hit singles, although the only one to chart in the USA was \\"Paying The Price Of Love\\", a fair, but unsuccessful attempt at 'hip-hop'. No matter. The rest of the album is wonderful. \\"Kiss Of Life\\" has an upbeat tempo with a killer chorus, while \\"How To Fall In Love, Part I\\" contains some of Barry's most soulful singing. Robin matches this soulfulness with his own on \\"Heart Like Mine\\". \\"Blue Island\\", a beautifully harmonized ballad dedicated to the children of Bosnia, has an amazing harmonica solo; unusual for the Gibbs. The remaining songs are all high tempo, especially \\"Above And Beyond\\" and \\"Fallen Angel\\", the latter being one of the Gibbs most danceable songs to date. The big sleeper here is, \\"For Whom The Bell Tolls\\", a romantic power ballad that should have been a big hit.<br />If you buy the IMPORT, you'll receive \\"Decadance\\", a high-tech remix of \\"You Should Be Dancing\\". It's worth the search. If you are very lucky, you may be one of the few to find a 'hidden track' - another version of \\"Decadance\\" not listed on the cover notes!
B000WQ9UA8|5.0|I am not a fan of Britney Spears but I truly enjoy this CD. Highly recommended!
B000YIGNKE|2.0|[[ASIN:B000YIGNKE Persuasion]]  This film production of Persuasion is so disappointing that I believe Jane Austen would denounce it if she were alive today.  The screenwriter and film director clearly did not understand the story characters in this Jane Austen story.  They turned Anne (the heroine) into a weepy, desperate & emotional basket-case instead of portraying her as a self-confident (in a quiet way), dignified, and full of common sense. A number of the support characters were so marginalized that it weakened and oversimplified the story.  My recommendation is to go with the Amanda Root/Ciaran Hinds film production which is about the best we'll ever see.
B000021Y77|5.0|Great Movie!  Really makes you think.  It is based on the theory that every second of every day determins your ultimate fate and even if one second was different, it could change your whole life.

B00005JPXY|5.0|People will always find a reason to bash a movie no matter what. But the truth is that this movie was original and done well. Hand-held cameras arent supposed to be hd theyre supposed to look rough and realistic so of course the screen will be blurry at times. But the story and the action was put together very good to where you would have been scared even if it was Bambi attacking you. And as far as the unanswered questions like where it came from thats retarded too. This is just supposed to be recovered video footage. Not a whole plotline planned out. So of course all the blanks wont be filled in and if they were that would make the movie completley cheesy and just a joke. Dont expect the best movie of all time but dont expect it to be as bad as people in this post say it is either. I keep seeing all this nonsense about godzilla, this is not a godzilla movie. Godzilla was cheesy and emotional to where he was almost your friend. Not to mention this monster looks very original and nothing like godzilla at all. This monster is scary as hell and ruthless and doesnt get exposed enough to where you get attached to it. And why are people bashing the hand-held camera thing? The preview clearly shows thats how it was filmed so if you hate that then dont go see it, and shut ur mouth. But if ur open to creativity and new movie ideas then youll probly enjoy it. And for those absolutley needing all the questions answered I just read that Abrams is already talking serious about a sequel. Although I fear that his mentioned ideas for it will be heavily criticized but we'll just have to wait and see.

His ways, however, are not always so divine as he falls for the bishop's wife. The story is heartwarming and funny and it's a great movie to watch at Christmas time. David Niven and Loretta Young round off this great cast.
B00005NB0F|3.0|This show was really good at first. The early episodes including the pilot were top notch. Then it kind of got off into the goofy 70's Bigfoot genre and came off the rails. But its got a great cast and Lee Majors was the man!

The only thing that got in the way was that babbling Daffy Duck of a director channeling his endless babble into the movie. It was just too much and too long and just babble babble babble. When they finally got down to the nitty gritty it was good.<br /><br />Daffy... er... Quentin?... SHUT THE HELL UP!<br /><br />ps Kurt Russell was great as Stuntman Mike!!!
B000P0J09C|5.0|The movie arrived just 2 days after ordering and came in perfect condition.  The movie quality (picture, sound, etc.) is exactly what it should be.

Just put aside your pre-conceived notions of what a show about space travel is supposed to be and enjoy!  They even have cows in space.
B000LC55F2|5.0|The movie was really mysterious and truly made you want to watch it again. I liked how they introducted Nikola Tesla in the movie. David Bowieplayed the part very well. Im glad a bought it, it's one of those movies you have to have in your collection.
B000LC55F2|5.0|Few films are as expertly crafted as this one. Beautifully filmed, with intricate plot twists that might leave you needing to rewind (or whatever one does with a DVD). Despite being somewhat fantastic in its story, it also provides imaginative food for thought on a few philosophical and social questions.
B00000JXVK|5.0|Beware.....you may buy a motorcycle after watching this movie.    Best Motorcycle movie I ever saw..........
0792839749|5.0|I really enjoyed the movie. My husband had never watched the movie and It was new to my grandkids, it was the quality of Mary Poppins. I came in a week I was very happy.A GREAT BARGAIN for such a quality family movie.
0440238609|4.0|This boxed book set is nice.  Nothing special, but nice.  The books are simple paperbacks, good typeface. Exactly as expected, just the right price, nothing more, nothing less.
B00005JM02|5.0|My husband and I just adore this movie so for Valentine's Day I bought him this DVD(He doesnt have a clue.).  :o)  He even quotes things from the movie so I thought he needed Finding Nemo for our DVD collection.  Such a cute show with enduring characters.  Thanks and just keep swimming!
B000VWYJ8Q|5.0|My wife and I liked very much what it is supposed to be the last leg of the Bourne's trio. It is full of action and interesting drama, we were not disappointed with this last movie, even though we do not have a High definition DVD player nor TV, we saw the regular version which also appears as an option in this combo. I would recommend it.
B0000C2IQD|5.0|This comes with the full screen and wide screen versions of the movie with an additional DVD loaded with extras. It also has a booklet with great photos and a basic story line. Our family loves this movie and if you do also you will love this DVD set. The first disc we received was defective but Amazon came thru with stellar customer service as always.
B000MRAAJW|5.0|This HD DVD set is everything I read about and some! It is very up close and personal for the viewer. I bought the DVD for my daughter for Christmas and we both have been absolutely awe shocked after watching it. You don't only watch the video, you experience it, which makes all the difference in the world! The set is definately a conversational piece for people of all ages. We now have a better understanding and appreciation for all living creatures on this earth and a new outlook on the importance of preserving and protecting the planet we live on.   Planet Earth in HD is a must see for everyone!
0920236162|5.0|A lesson in the things little girls need - every girl needs.  Don't miss this book if you have daughters - or if you are a daughter!  The female lead character in the book is strong and loyal, and she's a role model we could all learn a lesson from.  Loved this book, and my three daughters do, too.
0767812387|3.0|Beautiful people, beautiful story, great music, the kind of movie you watch to really relax and \\"go to a happy place\\". The ball-room dance afficionados will love it. Watch it!

B000K15VSA|5.0|As one of the few people who actually went to see Blade Runner in it's original theatrical review, I have been a huge Blade Runner fan for the full twenty-five year history of the film.  I have purchased each new release of Blade Runner as they were offered and enjoyed every variation that Sir Ridley Scott has provided.  Immediately following the first commercial that I saw for the \\"Final Cut\\" package (at 11:30PM) I jumped up from the couch and ordered it from Amazon.  When it arrived I was so impressed with the package that I ordered a second one for a friend.  Seeing the remastered \\"Final Cut\\" edition on my new 42 inch HDTV is an experience beyond words.  It is truly one of the finest and most enduring science fiction films of all time.  Thank you Amazon and thank you Sir Ridley!
B0001I561E|4.0|I sure hope so, because Disney's take on \\"Aladdin\\" is a wonderful rollercoaster ride of a tale.  Tucked securely in the middle of Disney's animated \\"Renaissance\\" in the late 80's to mid 90's, this fun-filled story pops off of the screen thanks to a wonderful digital transfer that highlights both the traditional animation of Disney and the (at the time) growing digital animation of Pixar.  This is most evident in the Cave of Wonders, where Aladdin, Abu and the Magic Carpet go for a wild ride as the cave collapses in on them.<br /><br />The plot is fairly generic.  It's a love story about a young man living on the streets and longing to become a \\"somebody\\" who falls for a young woman intent on breaking free from the chains of tradition.  Throw a power-hungry Vizier into the mix and you've got yourself a basic dramatic love story.  What makes this story more than just another run-of-the-mill animated romance, however, is a solid string of supporting characters who steal the show.  The chemistry between Aladdin and Jasmine is nice, but Robin Williams' Genie, who's own longing for freedom is an interesting subplot, injects the story with humor and action.  Gilbert Gottfried's Iago, the highly intelligent and cocky pet of the wicked Jafar, injects humor as well, though with quite a bit more bite than the Genie.  Heck even characters with smaller roles such as Abu, the Sultan, and the speechless Carpet, add fun to the story.<br /><br />Although the soundtrack isn't quite up to par with other Disney modern classics such as \\"Beauty and the Beast\\" and \\"The Lion King,\\" \\"Aladdin\\" has one of my personal favorite tunes in its arsenal, \\"A Whole New World.\\"  Both the film version and the pop radio cut by Regina Belle and Peabo Bryson are excellent.  This particular DVD features a new version of the song performed by then-married couple, Nick Lachey and Jessica Simpson.  Unfortunately for them, though, their version lacks the heart and soul that the film's and BelleBryson's version contains.<br /><br />This platinum edition DVD is a nice addition to any collection.  As stated before, the animation pops off of the screen.  The audio is excellent and the extras are a nice addition as well.  A Clay Aiken video, the original radio version of \\"A Whole New World\\" video, the Simspon/Lachey cut, and a pop-up information option highlight disc one.  Disc two contains plenty of fun and games, documentaries and other wonderful features.<br /><br />As a whole, \\"Aladdin\\" is a wonderful tale sure to capture the imagination of children and adults.  It isn't as breathtaking as \\"Beauty and the Beast,\\" nor is it as epic as \\"The Lion King,\\" but it has secured a spot for itself as one of Disney's greatest modern classics.  Highly recommended.s platinum edition DVD is a nice addition to any collection.  As stated before, the animation pops off of the screen.

B000UNYJXQ|5.0|Whether you love or hate Mr. Moore, you need to see this movie simply to see the ways in which civilized countries deal with their citizens and healthcare...one of the most interesting scenes involves a gathering of Americans currently working in France who talk about their guilt whenever they return home and see their parents and friends suffering through debt produced by health care bills or just an inability to get coverage...<br /><br />Eye-opening stuff. Also loved by my Mother the doctor..
B00004R9A4|5.0|This is one of Disney's all time classics for Kids and Adults. Angela Landsbury is as always a delight.
B0000024W3|5.0|Absolutely superior music from the 70's that is so much more Human/humane than the mountains of k-rap that is thrown at us to consume.  Mountain - Folk - a little Blue Grassie - easy listening; sorta early Bob Dylan music that you will smile to each time you play the CD/Album.
B000W7JWUA|5.0|We were introduced to Settlers by some young people in our church. I ordered it the next week for my 15 year old for Christmas. He loves to play Risk but gets annoyed by how long it takes to play and get it set up (me too).    We really like to play this game as a family. We even bought the 5-6 player expansion so more people could play. I highly recommend the game. The best part is that every time you play you have to develop a new strategy for winning. It just depends on where the hexes land.    One thing about version 4. The ocean border is created as interlocking like a puzzle. Great, unless you spill water on it, thus affecting its flatness. I really preferred the way that the previous version had the ocean hexes just like the rest. Not a big deal though.
0385333846|5.0|Fantastic movie with some tragic, sad, happy, funny moments! Michael Sacks is a fantastic actor! Awesome movie! The movie is based on the book, Slaughterhouse-Five by Kurt Vonnegut, Jr. I interpret it as being time-travel but without a time-machine. Smacks of 2001: Space Oddesy I had seen, but much, much better! Based on an American soldier's life in Germany during the 2nd World War. Highly recommend this movie for all science fiction aficianados! [Don't want to give away the ending. :)
B000Y7U98C|2.0|The beginning premise was good, however, the movie took a dramatic turn south during the last hour.  In the end, Sunshine is light horror movie mixed with a few 2001 A Space Odyssey moments.

B000I0QL82|5.0|We've always enjoyed the movie and still do.  However, we thought the DVD was a new colored version - like they did with the original Miracle on 34th Street. It's not, so don't be mislead by the packaging and the little color they added in the intro.

0142410314|5.0|I got this book from the library the year it was published. I was nine years old. I read it in one day and it was one of my favorite books. I didn't think either of the movies even came close to be as enthralling as this book. I bought it as a Christmas gift for my 8 year old great nephew. I highly recommend it for any child!
0061191752|5.0|This is a fascinating insight into the man, the chef, the legend-in-the-making; it is an easy read and very entertaining but buyers and fans need to know it is the SAME book as a previously released autobiography of Ramsay's entitled \\"Humble Pie\\". The same book, just repackaged and glossed up on the outside for his new American audience. Great book - but you don't need to buy it twice!
B000VUDSH6|4.0|From an American point of view, this movie is confusing, disconnected, and a bit melodramatic.  But this isn't an American movie.  Jackie Chan is Taiwanese.  This is that type of movie.  Watching this movie as a foreign film is quite enjoyable.  A little strange, but fun!

B00003CWTI|2.0|Overhyped, overly long (took me 5 or 6 viewings to even get through it), over-acted, and yes, BORING.  The falling frogs does not \\"save\\" the film, but only highlights what pretentious crap it is.  Cruise manages to shine, delivering an energetic and overall excellent performance.  Save your time and money though.  And be weary of all the great reviews.  It seems like they have an \\"Emperor's New Clothes\\" type of feel.  In the future, I will try to avoid movies billed as \\"ambitious\\".  Yuck!

B00005JPXY|4.0|Basically, this monster flick is a bonafide summer extravaganza masquerading as a wintertime release. And, yes, it's eardrum-busting loud and special effects heavy, but, amazingly CLOVERFIELD also has its deep waters. At a frenetic hour and a half, this film of survival in the face of the unthinkable doesn't have time to get mired in big-budgetism or blockbusteritis. So what we get instead is a taut and compelling pseudo-documentary style monster movie. Kind of. That's actually the backdrop. The film actually is more a focused story on a group of young people attempting to live thru a cataclysmic and unfathomable event. And that's the blessed key right there. CLOVERFIELD doesn't forget about the people, makes you pull for them to come thru okay, makes you all caught up in the throat when they don't. Least it did me.<br /><br />The film opens innocently enough as a group of young Manhattanites throw a farewell party for their friend, who's spending his last night in New York before he jets out to Japan for his new gig. The next 15 minutes or so clue us in with relevant scenes as we get to know the main characters and what's important to them. But, soon enough, news on television begin to cover an oil tanker just capsized in the New York harbor, and that's the start of it. Then comes the tremor, followed by a power outage. If you've caught the trailer, then you've seen folks scampering out to the roof, then pouring out into the streets, where the crap truly hits the fan.<br /><br />\\"People are gonna wanna know how it all went down,\\" declares the goofy would-be documentator as he holds fast to his buddy's camcorder and records the next several harrowing hours. It is thru this camcorder that we see this movie, treating us to a ground's eye view of the mounting panic and confusion and noise and fear and just the utter destruction left in the wake of the rampaging whatever-it-is. Because of the camcorder device, raw and shaky and frenetic, and utilized amateurishly enough to be realistic, there's an element of credibility which curtails the cheese factor of a typical monster movie. There's certainly a sense of immediacy here, and a decided impact felt. Bridges collapse, buildings topple, the head of the Statue of Liberty caroms off the side of an edifice, hurtling onto a crowded street. The military do their best, but don't fare too well. And there are other worrisome things out there to fret about, as evidenced by a frightening sequence in the subway tunnels. Reduced to witnessing events at a street level vantage point, pressed in squarely with the frantic victims and onlookers, a palpable feeling of helplessness and insignificance sinks in.<br /><br />CLOVERFIELD is a disaster movie as experienced thru the eyes of a young group of friends, never mind that the disaster is an unnatural one. No over-the-top heroics here by the cast, no vanquishing the behemoth or saving the city. Situations like this, the things that matter are quickly become well-defined. These Manhattanites are no world savers. They're mere mortals, concerned with personal survival and the survival of their loved ones. The brunt of the plot involves one character who means to brave the warzone to rescue a trapped loved one. His friends are loyal enough to accompany him. And because the movie takes the time to establish its cast, we're right there with them.<br /><br />Several SPOILERS follow.<br /><br />Exceptional CG work, of course, with most of the pretend stuff focusing on the wrack and ruin of Manhattan. And how does the monster look? Well, for most of CLOVERFIELD, there are only fleeting peeks at the raging monster, a tail here, a few limbs there, then a blurry shot of what might be the monster's head. Not until almost near the film's end do we get a close-up look of the big honking creature. This is all good, as, personally, the film-long tease ratcheted the suspense way up. I also liked that there wasn't an explanation provided for the monster, what it is,where it came from, all that. And when the closing credits roll around, we're left in the dark regarding the big picture. Was the monster ever vanquished? We know parts of New York are thoroughly devastated, as indicated by the film's introductory on-screen text. But I like that I might never find out. Meanwhile, now and then, we glimpse cutaway sequences of a happier time in the lead character's life (recorded on the same tape in the camcorder). These provide brief and bittersweet counterpoints to all the terror and is a reminder that, despite the f/x and the cool concept and the awesome featured creature, it's the moments of humanity in the film which keeps us invested, and sometimes on a visceral level. Go see this one.<br /><br />And if you end up enjoying CLOVERFIELD, you might also want to give [[ASIN:B000PKG8TW The Host (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)]] a go.where it came from, all that.

B000VWYJ8Q|4.0|After I bought this through amazon as a gift, I found HD DVDs less expensive, including a few 2 for 1 deals in actual retail stores. I was disappointed to get the phone call telling me I had given a bum DVD as a gift. Once we finally had a working DVD it was a great movie and good picture!

B00124EPWM|1.0|I have just received and viewed this \\"import\\", i.e. Korean made copy of 'The Four Feathers'.  Only purchased because no other is available at this time, it was disappointing and will only be useful for limited reasons.  For koreans who need the subtitles and for those who want a copy on  DVD format and are not expecting  a genuine  studio release disk.  Buyers will find this copy better than an old VHS copy made off TV but will be angry when discovering they did NOT get their $20.00 worth of quality.<br /><br />To be specific, as usual with these low resolution fakes you will notice color smearing, especially in the reds, as well as fade in and out or 'drift' in the chroma.  This was a genuine three-strip Technicolor film and such problems should not be present.  However, most notable will be the pixilation and image jump when the camera moves within a scene.  When on a static lock-down shot with little character motion the picture looks pretty good but will disappoint soon afterwards.<br /><br />This is a film valued for its visuals; accurate period costumes, Victorian British military uniforms etc...so that audience will have much to complain about, especially at the full retail price it is being sold for throughout Amazon et al.  This Inferior all-region oriental copy MAY be duplicated under license but I doubt it.  It should only be advertised as an amateur, 'collectors only' copy and priced at under five dollars.  Advice:  Try to buy the more expensive, authorized, American studio releases of these old but classic films instead of waiting for versions like this.  The art in the ad as displayed thru Amazon does not match the Korean version I received, which, in the actor titles lists the stars as 'Jack Lemmon, Lee Remick, Charles Bickford and Jack Klujaman\\", no less!<br />I work in the motion picture industry and am also an historian and writer.  This critique will be passed on to Amazon as a complaint about the sellers (who may be both unaware and indifferent  toward this issue).

B000Q9IZ5C|5.0|It is a shame that audiences have degraded entertainment down to 30 minute bites of fluff.  This series had incredible promise.  The character development  had such potential.  Bring it back!!  We are not all brain-dead zombies that can not still for more than 30 minutes.  Joss Whedon is my master now!!
B000F3T3CS|5.0|This is a delightfully acted and beautifully sung piece. Villazon is a joy to watch with his boy-like antics and expressions, and Netrebko sang  with great beauty, to match her own physical lovliness. She would often open her mouth a bit too much, (as critics have noted,) but she has changed that habit and kept the lovely sound, and the look is more natural. She sparkles, and the couple delights...beautifully!
0321525655|3.0|Like many others, I have grown (very) weary of the so-called \\"death by PowerPoint\\" culture which saturates the IT sector in which I work.  I would gladly substitute every minute of mindless suffering sitting through too many presentations by sales persons and various \\"engineers\\" with 150% more time at the Dentist's.  Much as I hate visiting my Dentist, at least I'll be healthier afterwards.<br /><br />Also like many others, I wager, I found out about Presentation Zen the book from Presentation Zen the blog of which I am a fan.  I am sorry to report that I am a bigger fan of the blog than I am of the book.  First, the good.<br /><br />The book itself is pleasing with good binding and great color.  It's easy to read with clear type and an attractive layout.  Chapter heading and sub-headings are clear and the flow of the book's content is harmonious.  The reader can tell that good quality work went into the typesetting and publishing--kudos to New Riders.<br /><br />How about content?  Well here a few shortcomings appear and although not enough to dismiss the book outright are enough to cause me wonder.  At 230 odd pages, the first impression as I flipped through is how \\"light\\" it is, literally and metaphorically.  There is a surprising amount of white space and while that's understandable from a design perspective, from a reader's however, it falls short of fulfilling the promise of content a similarly priced book should deliver on.<br /><br />Focused reading reveals surprisingly little that is original.  I stopped counting at 12 the number of books by other authors referenced and quoted from; and while that isn't a crime per se, it's certainly a shortcoming.  At best, it looks like Reynolds did a great job of editing, creating a pastiche of content from other authors and the reader might as well do the same thing: amass a large enough library and perform the acquisition of knowledge himself.  That, at least, comes with the advantage that reader will be getting it wholesale from the source instead of the Presentation Zen pr&eacute;cis.<br /><br />There is some practical and usable advice (start with analog brainstorming then proceed to the digital, keep the lights on, use a remote) but it's inadequately fleshed out.  This information is better presented and with a heightened emphasis on practicality in other books--Beyond Bullet Points by Cliff Atkinson comes to mind, one of the many cited as reference for further instruction.<br /><br />A possible defense to the accusation of being light is that Reynolds' wrote the book, as the subtitle hints, as more of a philosophical treatise on presentation design.  Fine, but even then, it's still light on those points as well.  Reynolds is content to regurgitate some Japanese aphorisms and quotes from various personages that, while certainly inspirational, possess little value beyond that.  The book ends up reading like a \\"pop psychology\\" cheer leading tome than what it means to be: a book instructing on presenting information to an audience.<br /><br />Some of the subtext I noticed from reading is that Reynolds is a dye in the wool fan of Apple products with little if any regard for PC and PC software (from Windows to PowerPoint) including them as an afterthought, perhaps to sell more books.  There is also a subtle but discernable thread of condescension toward American society--the number of \\"fat\\" Americans appearing in example slides started getting a little tired after a while.  I don't know if this was purposeful and I doubt it, but nevertheless it's there.<br /><br />The latter section of the book truly runs out of steam replete as it is with examples (with little to no analysis of them) filling page after page of slideware.  It peters out with some feel-good advice from the author about creativity, etc. in what felt like padding.<br /><br />In summary, Presentation Zen owes its existence (with apologies to Isaac Newton) to standing on the shoulders of giants on which it stands.  Amazon has it for sale at a great price so definitely get it from here.  Otherwise, there's no way I see of plunking down full price for this book at your local bookstore.erwise, there's no way I see of plunking down full price for this book at your local bookstore.
B000063UR2|1.0|I thought I would enjoy watching this movie again (I watched it years ago as a teenager). Sadly, I was wrong. Unfortunately, the special effects are so poor that it really is hard to follow. I always compare old movies to Star Wars. If they can't be close to that quality in special effects, then the plot better blow me away! This one is ok for little kids, I quess. . .
B000HIVIOW|5.0|I ordered copies of The Snowman DVD for both of my adult daughters as  Christmas gifts.  We have the video of the same that they started watching as young children. Each Christmas season we usually watch it again at least once.  This is a very heartwarming story of a boy who befriends a snowman and it is set to such beautiful music it'll bring you to tears.  Every child should have a copy of this very special DVD.
B000VAPZM2|5.0|It's a great DVD for kids.  The music is great.  It was fun to watch the rehearsal part of the extended edition.  My children love the videos and karaoke in the extended edition, too.

I got my refund but guess I lost my 25 dollar credit which makes me unhappy. I haven't heard that the 25 dollar credit was put back on my Amazon account. Other than that my experience was favorable.
B000UX6THK|5.0|I'm still working my way through the beginning of the second season, so I won't comment on the content other than to say it is as quirky, odd, complicated, and interesting as I've heard others say.  I didn't know Moby sampled from Laura Palmer's theme when he produced \\"Go,\\" but I recognized it right from the beginning of the pilot.    The video transfer is simply fantastic.  It's clear, colorful, and sharp.  Had I not known the show was more than 10 years old, it could have easily passed as being made today.  I've only listened to the English 2.0 soundtrack, but it gets the job done well.  Occasionally some dialogue comes through a little low, but I have a suspicion that was intentional.    Looking forward to the next episode!

Bearing little relation to the current show besides some shared names and major plot concept, it's an entertaining science fiction adventure story replete with charming scamps, evil enemies, devil-may-care heroes, and headstrong ladies.

B000AMJG4Y|5.0|I am in awe of doing business through Amazon and their affiliate shops. My service has always been better than cut rate providers off of the net. I definitely have learned to love i-net shopping. I ordered several gifts for my daughter around Christmas and they came on the 24th as promised. The dvd I ordered was beautiful, absolutely beautiful with no scratches or scuffs on the case or cd. I had gotten a bargain and will continue to shop here.
B000Y1ZXUM|4.0|I guess I should have known that since this concert is in Miami that the concert would mostly be in spanish.  That thought escaped me until I began watching the disc and I was unable to undertsand what she was singing.  However with Shakira does it really matter if you can't understand the words?  She is beautiful and the video is so clear!!

B00005JPXY|3.0|When one thinks of \\"Cloverfield\\" the awesome \\"hyped-up\\" trailer comes to mind. The teaser trailer was very well-marketed and does grab our attention. J.J. Abrams (Mission Impossible, Lost)definitely knows how to arouse the curiosity and attention of moviegoers. Now, the only problem with hyping up a film so much is that it either works or it doesn't. Hype can definitely work in putting people on theater seats but once word gets out that the film is \\"anything but...\\". Well, again, kudos to the producers who thought of the gimmick.<br /><br />The film's premise is looked at from the scope of POV of a DV camera during the farewell party for one bound for Japan executive Rob (Michael Stahl David). Suddenly, an unknown force rocks Manhattan. Wild fear and panic ensues as the military attempts to stop the gigantic menace on its path of destruction. Rob and a group of partygoers attempt to navigate through the city to save Rob's one true love; Beth. They find little hope as the rampage of the \\"unknown\\" force blocks all exits.<br /><br />\\"Blair Witch Project\\" anyone? Yes, the film takes on the camera style of the hugely successful horror film. Director Matt Reeves uses a single DV camera to take the audience into the heart of a monster film. Cloverfield is an ambitious film, it tries to escape from the usual clich&eacute;s and stereotypes that have plagued monster films before. Sadly, while the style did work for \\"Blair Witch\\", this film came off a little short. I do commend the producers for trying to widen the scope of a very limited premise in resorting to the video camera to emulate raw panic and fear. What made \\"Blair Witch\\" stand out was its ability to delve into the emotion of the unknown and the unexplained. \\"The Mist\\" already explored the unknown and while the \\"Cloverfield\\" does have a lot of emotions involved in the proceedings, I tend to look at things a bit differently. The gigantic monster is shown from time to time through the camera, and frankly it looks like the monster came from \\"The Mist\\". Even the once-again, spider-like creatures looked like they came from the aforementioned film by Frank Darabont.<br /><br />\\"Cloverfield\\" does attempt something different, the routes it took seem so ineffective. The film tries to give the viewer the feeling of REALITY through the video camera, but somehow, it fumbles its premise halfway through. It still fell to the usual clich&eacute;s inherent in a sci-fi monster film: display of military might, evacuation and panic, a love-sick hero with unexpressed love, dwindling hope, death and destruction, the usual heroics. The film employs obvious editing tricks to attempt to give the backstory of Beth and Rob's romance with the camera acting screwy that it rewinds from time to time. The film tries its best to make something so groundbreaking with a monster premise and while its producers/directors' hearts are in the correct place, the film's execution becomes nauseating. Quite frankly, the DV camera feels more like a \\"GIMMICK\\" than a REAL INHERENT part of the film. In \\"Blair Witch\\", at least, the characters are lost in the woods and they wish that a DV camera may give some light to what happens to them, which makes the video camera relevant.<br /><br />After all, who can hold a camera while your friends are being attacked? Why pick up the camera again after you drop it after you get attacked? (A metal bar would be more viable) Why hold on to the camera when you are scaling a tipped over rooftop? What kind of MORONIC stupidity is it for someone to keep on recording what is happening under the shadow of raw panic and hysteria? What kind of insensitivity is it to keep a dumb camera in play in the face of your friends' suffering? In REALITY, time is of the essence and the survival of your friends are the most important. REALITY dictates the video camera to be thrown aside for survival. After all is said and done, in this situation, the video camera is a useless piece of recording; for in REALITY, the whole world would know when a 200+ ft. monster is attacking a city. The camera needed to be turned off!<br /><br />To its credit, at the very least, there are some intense and scary moments in the film that are reminiscent of classic invasion films. The special effects are nicely done and the movie is indeed loud. The explosions are felt and pure destruction does save parts of the film. There is also some blood and gore. (although some of it happens off camera) I sure wished that the military encounters with the giant creature and the spider things were more explored. Actually, it would have done well if it was a reporter's first-person perspective who captured the footage of a heated encounter. Unfortunately, the director depends on crude humor and serious attempts at a sob story to generate sympathy. The film requires a large suspension of disbelief that contradicts its atmosphere to emulate a feeling of reality.<br /><br />Ultimately, \\"Cloverfield\\" could have survived without the single video camera gimmick. It could have just stuck to the basics of a monster film and still turned in a generous box-office take. Its attempts to emulate \\"REALITY\\" in the first person view may be its strength but its execution is also its greatest weakness. The pure \\"gimmick\\" of a single video camera tries to give the viewer a first-person view and/or spectator's point of view is an attempt to hide the hollow plot that it could have just as well be a spin-off of the far superior film; \\"The Mist\\". If you think about it, \\"Cloverfield\\" is what is happening in New York when \\"The Mist\\" took place in that small town. I am certain that this film will have its following who will say there is a deeper context and hidden subtle details where there is none. It does have the message of \\"seizing the moment\\", life is short, and love is powerful.<br /><br />But the next time someone says it is so original and groundbreaking, ask yourself this: How would I feel if a friend kept running around shooting a camera while we're running for our lives? Just enjoy it for what it is, a typical monster flick and it happens in New York again.<br />In truth, The Korean hit monster-family film; \\"The Host\\" and Darabont's \\"The Mist\\" is a lot better. Heck, at least, \\"Cloverfield\\" was better than the U.S. made \\"Godzilla\\" movie....<br /><br />It's ok, nothing spectacular but will definitely appeal to some.

1932100660|4.0|The primary theme of this book is that animal based proteins affect the rate of cancer in any given population. He does also consider other things such as fiber, and has important findings in this area, but overall, the animal protein was the most startling.<br /><br />In the introduction he explains how he worked in the Philippines when he was on the faculty at Virginia Tech. Their goal was to improve childhood malnutrition by making sure the children were getting as much protein as possible, in particular animal based protein. But, this led to a startling discovery, the children that consumed the most protein were also the most likely to develop liver cancer!<br /><br />He then found a study from India, saying in essence, the same thing. They had fed two groups of rats a cancer causing agent, but one group was given 20% protein while the other was given only 5%. 100% of the rats fed a diet of 20% protein developed liver cancer, while none of the rats on the 5% diet developed cancer.<br /><br />My initial thought was \\"What about vegetarians?\\" But many of them consume a large amount of animal based proteins in the form of milk, yogurt, cheese and eggs, which are all on his \\"avoid\\" list.<br /><br />This blew away everything he had been taught about nutrition. He eventually goes on to study the subject in the laboratory for 27 years funded by sources such as the National Institutes of Health, the American Cancer Society, and the American Institute for Cancer Research.<br /><br />His research showed that they could virtually turn on and off cancer growth by changing the level of protein consumed. This was a shocking discovery to say the least, one that eventually ends him up on a watch list funded by those who profit from the sale of animal protein.<br /><br />There were other interesting insights, such as peanuts are often contaminated with a fungus produced toxin called aflatoxin (AF). AF is said to be the most potent chemical carcinogen. Carcinogen simply means that the item has been found to cause cancer. He went on to get a grant to study the subject and found that peanut butter would have levels of AF as high as 300% above what was considered safe. Whereas the cocktail peanuts level of AF was within acceptable parameters. The conclusion was, the good peanuts were being sorted out at the factor to go in the jars of nuts, and the worst and moldiest nuts were made into peanut butter.<br /><br />There is of course political intrigue, because whenever you shake a financial tree like the meat producers, watch out what falls on your head. I felt like he handled this difficult aspect of his career with dignity, and didn't become an \\"Everybody's out to get me!\\" person. Instead, he continued on with his important research.<br /><br />It is a somewhat heavy read but provides many insights into today's illnesses of affluence.went on to get a grant to study the subject and found that peanut butter would have levels of AF as high as 300% above what was considered safe.

B00005JPXY|5.0|That would have been a good name for this movie, echoing perhaps the most quotable line of dialog from the film.  But to be honest, it wouldn't have mattered what the title was -- you could call it \\"Milk and Cereal\\" and it would have still been an awesome move.<br /><br />Based on the trailers, I expected a more mature attempt at Blair Witch filmmaking, with something of a sci-fi suspense twist.  In a way, I was right, but also in a way I was completely wrong.<br /><br />This movie is like nothing you have ever seen before.  It defies all genres.  I walked out of the theater amid a sea of voices muttering things like \\"wow. what did we just watch?\\"  This is film history.  In a time when everything coming from Hollywood is just a rehash of something else Hollywood gave us years ago, Cloverfield is the birth of something truly unique.<br /><br />The true genius of the film is in its synergy of iconic elements from the history of handheld video cameras, as well as a few what-ifs, imagining how something might have looked if it had been seen by a camera.  It's Blair Witch meets America's Funniest Home Videos, meets Godzilla, meets 9/11 documentary, meets the Zapruder film, meets Titanic, meets King Kong.<br /><br />Basically, it's like everything you've ever seen before, yet this film is like nothing you have ever seen before.
B00003XACV|5.0|I've had this score for years and have always loved it. I use to write to it a lot, great music for it. I actually heard the the track \\"American Beauty\\" at a \\"trendy\\" restaurant recently and was reminded of how good it was, which prompted me to give the score another complete spin.<br /><br />This music is incredibly well-composed. Anyone who would give this 1 or 2 stars simply is a tone deaf idiot, or they're trying to be cute (and we're all very impressed). Newman does an incredible job of creating mysterious, charming, and haunting pieces on this score. All of those adjectives also apply to the movie obviously, and Newman does a great job of conveying the movie's emotions through sound.<br /><br />Out of the 9 or 10 Newman scores I own- this one sits atop them all though there are ones not far behind (Shawshank Redemption, Road to Perdition, Pay it Forward (very similar to this one), Green Mile, etc.) There is beautful music on all of his scores- but those are just some of the really solid \\"through and through\\" ones in my opinion.<br /><br />Anyway, after 130 reviews, I'm sure this one doesn't even matter. But maybe it will help raise the overall review to the 5 stars it rightfully deserves.<br /><br />Just lay back and get lost. If you do lay back though, beware of \\"Root Beer\\" and \\"Spartanette\\" if you have earphones in at full blast.
B00008EY65|4.0|Ive had this dvd sitting around for the past few years and I finally got around to watch it. I loved this movie. The colors are rich, the effects are top notch, and it has some pretty good action sequences. Guillermo del Toro is an excellent director. The dvd has four cartoons as extras and the Tell Tale Heart is pretty amazing. I thought the second disc was unneccesary. Still, a great buy if you like action movies.
B000MRAAJW|1.0|The HD format does not work in our home theater system. So I cannot recommend it. It would be helpful if there was some information in the products details that helped tech novices buy the right format.
0783225849|3.0|While Psycho is one of the greatest films of all time, this dvd does no justice. The transfer is horrible. The film seems darker at some points in the film and it makes it hard to know what is going on. I still enjoyed the film just not the transfer.
B000Q9IZ5C|5.0|The movie was very good and as it stated it would be! Thanks for all of the things done!
B000MRAAJW|5.0|I purchased this for my boyfriend for Christmas. We had watched the show on TV, but the HD-DVD is breathtaking. Viewed on a Sony 1080p television and using the high end model of the Toshiba HD-DVD player. The picture quality is crisp and the colors really pop.  The show itself is wonderful, if you're a big fan of nature and the world's natural beauty, you're sure to enjoy it.
B000WMEAKC|5.0|I bought the album because I'd seen this group perform 'Apologize' several times on TV and feel in love with the song. This is one of those albums that has a great flow. This has quickly become one of my favorites.

0307120007|5.0|We bought this book 35 years ago for our babies. We must have bought a least a dozen more over the years for our friends young ones. It is a great first book for little ones both fun to read and to teach touch.
B000VBJEEG|2.0|I know there are reviewers who say this film should be in the \\"Best Picture\\" category for an Oscar, but after the initial premise unfolded and the animation wonder was revealed I was bored out of my mind. I think you have to be under 18 to fall in love with this --- or have a spirit that is a great deal more youthful than mine. The kids will love it, but this ain't adult viewing material, unless you have to watch with the kids.
B00009MGGI|5.0|If you like real drama, magnificent scripts and stellar acting, this is it. You will not be able to move once the characters suck you in. And the EVIL of Ian Richardson -- WOW! One of the great TV performances of all time.

B000H1RFKU|4.0|One of the finest films of Denzel Washington very impressive career, Training Day is a must have for all Blu-Ray owners, because this film clearly demonstrates the huge difference between DVD and the high definition formats.  Initially, I was skeptical about this film on next generation formats, but the impressive sharpness and three dimensional nature of a great many shots, sold me on it right from the beginning of the film.  While I remember this movie being bland and demonstrating a lot of crush in the nighttime shots at the conclusion of the film on DVD, the Blu-Ray showed all of those scenes the way they should look and infused a film that has a very limited palette of colors with a lot more life.  So sit back and enjoy a great film in a great transfer with Ethan Hawk and Denzel Washington at the top of their games.
B00005JPLW|2.0|I don't usually write negative reviews, but, after seeing 300, I couldn't hold back.     300 relies a little too much on macho, testosterone-driven war-cliché rhetoric, lines such as \\"Remember this day men!\\", \\"Tonight we dine in hell!\\", and \\"No retreat, no surrender!\\" Just think  WWE Smackdown combined with Gladiator minus credibility or depth. There is plenty of eye candy for those who enjoy gratuitous slow-motion violence (a la The Matrix) with rock-blaring soundtracks in the background and scantily clad warriors and women in erotic, albeit, pointless sex scenes. I'm not squeamish about violence and I love rock, but sometimes you have to call a spade a spade, and, although the film is based on a \\"graphic novel\\", the scenes here are just overblown, cartoonish and cheesy. It's just the kind of movie that does well at the box office and that the masses eat up and praise vehemently.     It's hard to decide what irked me most, the dialogue's stupidity, the lacking characterization, or the film's length (a shade under two hours). Let's start with characters, or lack thereof. There are virtually no characters that anyone could care less about in this film. The main character, Leonidas (Gerard Butler), leads his Spartan warriors into the Battle of Thermopylae, gives long winded, poetic, war speech after war speech to his comrades and there are no redeeming qualities to him, nothing to make you want to care what happens to him or his men. There is way too much of an effort to make one side the \\"good\\" guys and one side the \\"bad\\" guys. Too much over-simplication. The enemies are depicted as almost being \\"monsterish\\" at times, as if the producer wants you to side with the Spartans so much by making the Persians disgusting or vile. They try way too hard to get you to sympathize with Spartans as great warriors and \\"real men\\" by selling all this \\"blah blah blah\\" war-lingo in which Leonidas basically says \\"We're bad. We're better than them. We're going to take them down. This isthe most glorious fight ever\\" and on and on. The movie was also too long; it really could have been trimmed by at least twenty to thirty minutes without the oversimplified, drawn-out battles.     As much as this film was a disappointment, I can commend Zach Snyder on some positives: the visual effects are decent, and the attempt at originality is there. There is a strong attempt to make this story come to life visually and artistically the way it was written. There is just too much emphasis on this, though.  Too bad the story was stripped down (literally, figuratively) to its bare essentials.      All style, all flash, all hype. No substance.     Entertainment for entertainment's sake: that's about it. Some will love it; others will roll their eyes.
B00004XQ83|5.0|Thanks for the movie I ordered. It came in plenty of time for Christmas and was first quality. I appreciate it.  Gail T. Kent, Wa.
B000EZ7ZZE|4.0|This isn't an in-depth review of the movie, just a review of the Blu-Ray transfer.  You either like zombie movies, or you don't.  If you don't, don't bother with this one.  If you do, I recommend this.  Anyhow, what I'm concerned with here is the video quality and, to a lesser extent, the audio quality.  Both are excellent; however, I'm irritated by Sony's stubborn use of MPEG-2 transcoding rather than Microsoft's VC-1.  Both Sony Blu-Ray's that I own (Casino Royale and RE: Apocalypse) use MPEG-2 compression; so, I assume that Sony just doesn't want anything to do with Microsoft (See: HD format war).    Honestly, the DVD transfer of this film is top notch for that medium; so, unless you don't own RE: Apocalypse, I wouldn't recommend snagging this one unless you just HAVE to have it in 1080p.  The DVD version on my Oppo looks excellent.  But if you can find it cheap on Amazon, you won't be disappointed.
B000VWYJ86|5.0|Excellent film; exciting.  Having watched the others I looked forward to the experience and it was not a let down.  Leaves one with the thought that there may be another film in the future. Great series of movies.

B000VBJEEG|5.0|It was fun to watch this film.  Great graphics and presentation.  I am still not a fan of rats around the house but if they were like the ones in this film I would harness their talent.  Good story line and generally a enjoyable experience.
0743454537|5.0|I just finished this book and you know when you finish a really good book, you are left with this amazing satisfied feeling?  A pleasant surprise that you found such a gem of a book, sad it's over, so impressed with the writing and topics....that's exactly how I feel.<br /><br />This is my second Jodi Picoult novel, and I plan on reading her entire catalogue based on how much I enjoyed this book and Nineteen Minutes.  She is an absolute genius when it comes to character development and finding and creating a story that is unique, current and fascenating.  What has been amazing me with her writing is that she draws you in so easily with each of her characters and you find yourself understanding each ones point of view.  In a story like this, that is hard to do!<br /><br />The idea and reality of \\"designer babies\\" and organ donors and family donors, is one that is not easily dissected, and I'm happy to say that Picoult does not try to come up with any rights or wrongs, any easy answers.  She also did this with 19 Minutes.  It does the topic justice when she portrays it just as complex as it is in real life.  And again, to show us believably each characters point of view, it's no small feat.<br /><br />From beginning to end, this was a first class novel.  It's not often I am moved to tears by a novel, but in this one I was.  The entire story had me using all of my spare time to read, and when I got to the end, it was well worth it.  Read it!!
B000WBZ5M0|1.0|Not any where near as good as the films preceeding it.  Big stars but little on substance.  They have over extended themselves on this concept or theme.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|Pretty much everything has been said about Serenity already, that I would say. I can only add, that, I enjoyed it as much as the series for TV. Yet it stands alone too, for those who haven't seen the series yet. I recommend watching the TV episodes first, naturally, because that's the order in which I enjoyed Joss Whedon's pot pouri of fascinating characters (Serenity's crew). The plot driving the series is finished chillingly in this movie: evidently, Whedon took what was going to be Season Two and parts of Three, and wove them into a finished tale in the film. He did this very successfully, in my opinion.<br /><br />The reason why this is my favorite science-fiction movie is because it isn't a ripoff or clone of the genre. So much of it is unique that it is a fresh experience, even for jaded sci-fi fans.
B000MRAAJW|5.0|This is an incredible series. I can't imagine not viewing it in HD.  The footage is beyond belief.  Takes you places most of us will never go.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|The most interesting nature show I've ever seen.  You can see trees go through their yearly cycle in only 5 minutes.  Extremely cool.

B00006AVRK|4.0|What a great series this is.  I never saw it when it first aired but had caught some episodes re-aired on A&E.  I have read all the Jeeves & Wooster stories (written by P.G. Wodehouse).  The stories in book form are truly brilliant.  I've watched 2 1/2 of the four seasons and, frankly, it has gotten a little old.  The stories never get old.  The real genius is in Wodehouse's writing.  Check out the books.  You can get the complete collection of Jeeves and Wooster stories in one book.
B000V6BE6C|5.0|This is truly their best work to date. The music is just awesome and the vocals are much more expressive of his ability. This isn't just your typical \\"Screamer\\" he really has some pipes...and the whole band also sings parts on this.<br />Be sure you get the version with the DVD...it's well worth it.<br />I saw these guys live in St. Pete, FL and they KILLED!!!<br />I have all their music and this one is their best so far...<br />Neal

0385484518|3.0|Tuesdays with Morrie packages plain old common sense as new, deep spiritual insight.  I don't think anyone doesn't already know that life is short, family and friends are more important than material possessions, etc, but it's still good to be reminded.  Enjoy it for what it is: a simple story of a man facing death with a positive perspective.
B000AGTPUU|5.0|I was looking for us for awhile and was extremly pleased to find it. It is a terrific family film that catches the Christmas spirit.
0743487583|1.0|3 Words best describe this book: wordy, contrived, and melodramatic.  I LOVE reading classics, but this one consistently disappoints.  A lot of classics are wordy, and a lot of Gothic tales are contrived and melodramatic, but at least the pay-off is worth the effort.  Sadly, I cannot say the same for Mary Shelley's Frankenstein.  Hollywood does a better job with the story than the original author.
B000YA9R3C|4.0|It's an odd dichotomy, the debate over Anderson as a filmmaker.  There's a consortium who believe he's the supreme filmmaker of the past 2 decades, and there are those who insist its all style over substance.  Me? Well, while I've long been allergic to Anderson's habitually unwatchable, pompous hipster-flicks-for-critics, I never discounted that there is an inherent talent.  Only, the end result frequently left me cold and indifferent.  Sorta limp.  So, I dived into `There Will Be Blood' expecting a long, laborious characteristic PTA endurance test never assuming I would be magnified and thoroughly engrossed by its epoch sweep.  It is visually stunning, to be sure, and the soundtrack by Radiohead's Jonny Greenwood is film-scoring-as-symphony; it impales you as if it's its own character.  As self-indulgent as Anderson's films are, he seems to imbue great performances from his actors.  Here is no exception, especially in Daniel Day Lewis - he is monumental; so few times in my movie-going experience has a character so morally repugnant so immersed my psyche.  His Daniel Plainview lists as one of the great screen characters.  Just hand him the Oscar now, as there hasn't been this colossal a performance by an actor in years.  I believe it could be a masterpiece.  My grade: A
0975991477|5.0|Bruce Lipton does an excellent job of explaining the biology of our cells and what that means. As a teacher of biology for doctors today, he is wise and presents that \\"modern\\" Medicine is archaic in some ways. My opinion is that when God informs, then Man and in this case doctors, have to \\"approve\\" what happens directly from God, there is a disconnect someplace. I particularly liked the part where Modern Medicine shuns the Energy Medicine approach to healing because they do not understand it, but use the same energy patterns to provide MRIs and Echocardiagrams, etc, in diagonsis. It doesn't seem to fit. I am thankful for men of science speaking out in truth about the changes we are beginning to understand, but sometimes slow to implement because of that lack of understanding. Regardless, energy healing works - even if doctors don't understand.

B000ASATZ8|5.0|\\"Tremors\\" is one of my hubby's favorite movies, so I bought the \\"Attack Pack\\" set as a Christmas gift for him.  It had been a while since we saw #1 and #2 (never saw 3 & 4), so we had a \\"Tremors marathon\\" and watched all of them over the course of a few weekends.  What fun we had!!!    The secret to enjoying all four movies is to have an open mind and just let yourself be entertained.  Don't get hung up on comparing them with each other, don't pick at the details, just get your bowl of popcorn, sit back and get ready to have a good time.
B000VBJEEG|4.0|It is a lovely movie. I watched it at Christmas with my very worldly 16 year old and my 11 year old. We all loved it. My little guy now dreams to become a great chef. After the movie ends, you feel good about the human race, and even (some) rats. I hope the movie also makes more American viewers care about the quality of their food and drinks.

Anyway, I have a pair of Hd 485's, and I was surprised how detailed these headphones are.  Being a closed design probably helps though.  The noise suppression is every bit of what they claim, it is like gun range ear muffs.  I noticed that right out of the box there was a little sibilance (tinge, ringy, scratchy) but they tightened up after 15 min.  And word on the 'net says that they get better with 100-200 hours, so.....Awesome headphones.

He said he would read everything on a subject looking for \\" density \\" and then write his books and it shows here that he has done it again, after The Powers that Be and other outstanding books. Fascinating portraits of Truman, MacArthur, Acheson, Marshall and several military officers. So sorry his accidental death at 73 has deprived us of future Halberstam books. He had no competition.
B00003CXAT|5.0|While I loved almost every aspect of the movie, its the dinosaurs that steal the show, naturally.  And it's not just because we see a T-Rex in full form or a pair of ruthless Raptors, but this is the first time something is presented in glorious CGI.  Jurassic Park made a huge impact with that for its time, just like Terminator 2 did in 1990 and the Matrix in 1999.  Jurassic Park had its place too, at bringing to life dinosaurs that look wonderful and real, and hold up even today on the screen.<br /><br />Based off the book by Micahel Crichton, one can't expect the over all feel of the film to be as good, but honestly the whole thing worked just fine.  If you compare this original to the sequals, its even that much better.  The cast is quite decent, and though huge amounts of dialouge are not shared as well as deep in depthness to most of the characters, its ok because this is about the dinasours and the park on the island.  The first hour is spent much like one would feel taking a trip to this park, almost a vacation if you will, though already the park has its glitches.  A tropical storm comes, and combined with a sneaky worker named Dennis (Wayne Knight - that big nerdy guy in Animal House) who is just too funny sometimes, all heck breaks loose - including the dinosaurs.  Thus begins the last hour thrill ride of chases and survival tactics.  There are two scenes that are very action filled.  The first is the T-Rex attack on the two park vehicles in the rain at night.  The other was just down right scary, the pair of Velociraptors hunting the two children in the dark kitchen.<br /><br />In addition to the dinosaurs, I enjoyed the characters and their acting was fine.  The story was excellent too, and though a bit slow at first, it works out well.  Time is taken to appreciate and learn the mesmorizing truth about these creatures and how they have been recreated.  Thanks to the directing of Spielberg and the outsanding score by John Williams, every scene is a good one.  And thanks to Williams usual impressive composing skills, he creates not just good music, but a theme for Jurassic Park that is easily recognizable whenever heard.<br /><br />Though this went down as a great film, I think it deserves even more credit.  It was created before its time, and holding up very well for today's standads.  The sequals can't even compare.  The story is fascinating and the dinosaurs themselves - breathtaking, and scary.<br /><br />Acting - 4.5<br />Action - 5<br />Characters - 4.5<br />Story - 4.5<br />Overall - 5to Williams usual impressive composing skills, he creates not just good music, but a theme for Jurassic Park that is easily recognizable whenever heard.

B000MQC9H4|3.0|An interesting, but extraordinarily long piece that can only be described as a \\"chick-flick.\\"  Although its more like two \\"chick-flicks\\" rolled into one title.  The one with Jude Law and Cameron Diaz is a well developed exploration of the difficulty of making commitment, while the other half of this film, Jack Black and Kate Winslet feels about as dry and scripted as any performance I've seen yet.  Not a bad movie, but it sure is Looong!
B00005JPXY|2.0|Cloverfield focuses on a group of friends just prior to and after an attack on Manhattan by a giant monster. The entire film is presented as seen from a handheld video camera. As a viewer, you only see and hear what the friends and their camera does, so confusion and ignorance are the order of the day, just as the producers intended.     Many of the basic concepts of Cloverfield were well conceived. Keeping the focus on a small group and seeing things from their perspective helps build suspense and mystery. When you do see it, the monster looks great and is as powerful as you could ask for. There's never any doubt that this thing is incredibly dangerous and scary, and it is not a clone of any previous monsters.     Unfortunately, the rest of the movie left a lot to be desired. The video camera is always in motion, often spinning wildly around and around, bobbing, pointing at the ground, pointing at someone's shoes, out of focus, bouncing, and generally doing anything but just letting you lose yourself in the movie for more than a few seconds at a time. The cast is equally annoying as they are both stupid and unlikable even before the attack. The party scene at the beginning drags on for far too long and does little to make viewers care about the group. Once danger starts, they consistently put themselves in harm's way and do things that only a moron would consider.     I wanted to like Cloverfield. I grew up on old monster and always loved them even though I was frustrated by the obvious low quality. I was hoping that Cloverfield would be a breakthrough for its genre just as [[ASIN:B00003CXAT Jurassic Park (Widescreen Collector's Edition)]] was for dinosaurs but no such luck. When the movie ended, most of the audience laughed and many were commenting negatively on the way out.

159102594X|5.0|Abercrombie is a skilled writer whose clever turns of phrase are darkly funny. From Glokta's thoughts on bodies in the river, Logen's pragmatic remarks, or Jezal's naivete, each character is full and vibrant. Filled with intrigue, the plot moves along, meanwhile developing characters the reader will become deeply invested in. If Abercrombie's writing has a flaw, it his use of swearing in the story. Although humorous at times, I found that I was more often thrust out of the story by the use of modern curse words than drawn in. Some readers will take offense at his usage, but the story is too interesting to dismiss only because of this. Each character's motivations are different but compelling, and the fight scenes are impressively described.    Abercrombie's novel ends too soon. The characters and world have been set up, a few key events have occurred, but I was left unsatisfied in some ways. I'm still not sure what the point of the story is, other than a few cultural potshots and the character development. While I enjoyed the reading, and look forward to the next installment, I still am not sure where the story is going. Still, the character development is fun to read, and I hope the second book will really move the plot forward.    I recommend reading The Blade Itself. The story is wickedly funny, the fight scenes memorable, and the characters fascinating. Nothing in this novel is as it seems, and Abercrombie's contribution to the genre is sure to endure.

I felt this more to be a fiction story about Africa, with simple mysteries a way of moving plot forward and allowing back story highlighting African history and culture. Still, Precious Ramotswe is a likable character, and fans of Agatha Christie's Miss Marple are likely the readers who drove this book to the top of the National Bestseller lists.

B000XNZ7LG|5.0|There are alot of WWII themed films but this one is on a whole different level. It's not about tactics or battlefields. It's not about maximum carnage and body counts. It's not even about heroism and achieving final victory. No, this is one man's true story of surviving one of the most horrific periods in world history.<br /><br />This is the story of Wladyslaw Szpilman, played by Adrien Brody, a Jewish man livng in Poland who also happens to be an extraordinary pianist. When the Germans invade, his neighborhood, his city, his piano playing job , and his family are all turned utterly upsidedown. He and his family are forced to move, sell everything, and endure the hardships of a sadistic and heartless Nazi occupation. His whole life of prosperity and promise quickly deteriorates into a daily horror as he witnesses his friends and neighbors abused and murdered. Soon after, his family is penniless, bodies lay in the street, and the jewish people are constantly relocated until the day comes when they'll all be boarded a train to a horrible fate at a concentration camp. Szpilman escapes that fate but finds himself alone among the ruins of his once peaceful neighborhood. He takes shelter in the abandoned and burned out buildings, trying evade German troops and hold out as long as he can.<br /><br />The actors are wonderfully played and cast but Adrian Brody gives what I believe is his best performance ever. Many times, conveying his thoughts and emotions without a single word. He gives life and passion to his character. This is also Roman Polanski's finest hour as the sets, scenery, and overall look of the film are exquisite. He gives the viewer the eyes of the characters, as it becomes you that's looking to see if the coast is clear while peeking through windows and cracks between buildings. Every scene is set perfectly as the early part of the film is bright, colorful and clean. But as the events darken, so does the enviornment. The city takes on a slow decay until it lay in total ruin. It becomes dirty and war torn. Everything looks authentic and period like. The peoples clothes, cars and furniture, the soldiers uniforms, vehiles and weapons are all spot on. An excellent production all around.<br /><br />The video on the HD DVD disc is spotlessly clean, clear and vivd. It doesn't have the bright colors to give you that three dimensional pop, but it's detailed enough to remind you, your watching an HD DVD disc. I upgraded from my standard disc to this one and noticed the difference almost immediately. The standard disc is good but this one is clearly better overall. A superb transfer.<br /><br />The audio is presented in Dolby TrueHD and Dolby Digital Plus. I only listened to the TrueHD as it has a higher bitrate and is always the clear winner of the two. While I'm generally happy with the performance, it seemed a little too front loaded. There were'nt many times where the surrounds grabbed my attention with atmosphere or background movement. There are some big bangs, explosions and gunfire to pick things up a bit but the film is pretty quiet for alot of the time too, which doesn't really take advantage of the surrounds. I don't fault the disc though, as it's just the sound design. Still though, everything comes across clearly and distinguishable. The loud and soft moments are perfectly balanced to where you won't have to adjust the volume at all. The piano pieces are beautiful and sound wonderful too.<br /><br />This is a wonderful film. It's clearly WWII but different than most every other WWII film out there. The Pianist gives us another insight to the atrocities against the Jewish people but the film never forces excessive gore to create shock value. Theres almost no bad language to brace for either. There's maybe a handful at most through the entire film. For me, that's important and makes it much easier to watch. The violence isn't throughout, but what's there can be pretty unsettling. But it has to be there for this type of film, or it's just not accurate at all. We don't want to sugar coat this and besides, it's a true story. If your interested in true stories and WWII period films, it's an easy recommend. If your considering upgrading, it's even easier.l. We don't want to sugar coat this and besides, it's a true story.

B000EWD1KK|4.0|One of the all time classic comedic actors, Danny Kaye gives a charming and varied performance as day dreamer Walter Mitty. A helpless hopeful who works for a publishing company and constanly gets himself into trouble by dreaming his life more fantastic. Whether it be doctor, fighter pilot or gambling gentleman, he becomes the man he wishes he could be but is absolutely not. Charming, debonaire, brave and sophisticated. The real Walter Mitty posesses none of these attributes.<br /><br />Things take a turn for him though as he finds himself mixed up with a beautiful woman who's in trouble and involved in a dangerous plan to retrieve a book containing locations for some hidden WWII paintings. A former nazi named \\"The Boot\\" is also aware of the book and will kill anyone in the way of securing it for himself.<br /><br />Unfortunately for Walter, no one knows or believes his story as these people who constantly call on him for help are never around when anyone else is. His Boss, co-workers, and family all chalk it up to his wild imaginations and story writing career. This all makes for some funny moments where Walters secret life soon becomes his real life. But nobody knows it but him.<br /><br />Danny Kaye does a wonderful job of selling every performance he's asked to. Every character he plays is totally different from the other and is a tribute to his versitility. He absolutely sells this movie and makes it work. A great performance. Keep an eye out for Boris Karloff in his psychiatrist role as well.<br /><br />The disc works well for what it is. The color looks very good and natural. Overall, it's pretty clean and doesn't cause any unnecessary distractions. The audio is typically mono and focused to the front speakers. Everything is clearly heard and distinguishable. The score and dialog come across loud and clear.<br /><br />This is a fun film for all ages. It works very well and can easily be watched again and again. Highly recommended.

B000ICL3KG|5.0|The phenomenon of Global Warming has been at the back of my mind since I was very, very young.  Yet I think I always underestimated it's toll on our world.  Then one afternoon while reading the Economist when they nonchalantly declared it one of the two most important issues facing civilization I decided to pop it in and check it out.  While I've never been a fan of Gore before this, it is hard not to respect the man after seeing this movie, and not only respect but be INSPIRED by him.  If you don't feel like getting up and changing the world for the better after seeing this movie there is something wrong.  Powerful empirical data is revealed showing a world on the brink...  it's scary.  While points of the film have been disputed, you can't easily dismiss the main point of his movie.  Humanity has its hands full and hopefully this movie will push us in the right direction.
0385334176|5.0|I am a big Vonnegut fan and I absolutely loved this book.  The development of the main character, Rudy Waltz, is superb.  When the book ended I felt as though I understood him better than some of my real life friends.  The insights, the stories, and the memories which are described throughout the story are so personal that you can't help but truly understand Rudy as a person - as screwed up as he may be.  As usual, Vonnegut does it all through perfect insight, beautiful words, and an excellent mix of dark humor, absurdity, and realism.      I read some of the other reviews on this site and cannot believe that people had so many negative things to say about this book.  The tidbits of adding recipes and switching into \\"play mode\\" (complete with stage direction) were great techniques that further brought you into the mind of a \\"nobody\\" from a \\"nowhere\\" town.  If you want a book that starts with \\"once upon a time\\" and finishes with \\"the end\\" then you may want to avoid this one; it's a little more cerebral than your average tale.
B000VLOKQI|4.0|This is an entertaining history of my favorite band. Most of the footage I had not seen before, though I was disappointed there was no full-song concert footage. As far as content goes, there's not much new. We hear Pete explain for the billionth time why he smashed his guitar. No great revelations there. But what can an avid Who fan expect from such DVDs? If you really like the band, you've exhausted the catalogue. If you are unfamiliar with the Who, this is a good primer. The extra DVD is worth watching, as it gives great footage of all four members individually. For my money, the best Who treatment was the 30 Years of Maximum R & B feature done in 1994, which showed me, for the first time, the spectacular Second Isle of Wight concert footage as well as terrific versions of \\"Happy Jack\\" and \\"Anyway, Anyhow, Anywhere.\\" On the 30 Years show, we were treated to incoherent commentary by Keith Richard, whereas here, we hear incoherent commentary by Noel Gallagher.

B000AJIF4E|5.0|This headset has crisp highs and bellocose lows.  It is also extremely comfortable.  The soft leatherette padding is so comfortable you hardly know they are on your head, and they block out so much sound who needs the extra $300+ expense for noise cancellation!  The folding ear muffs design is great for traveling.  They pack really tight for a full size headset. My only concern is the rather flimsy appearing design of the swivel mechanism, but to date this is only a concern and not a problem.  These headphones work as well as those from Bose costing hundreds more.  Excellent value, good buy.
0060512806|4.0|This novel has two interwoven narratives: one that's set in 1944-1945, and one that's set in the present day. The World War Two narrative line is consistently funny, exciting, unpredictable and clever. The modern-day narrative is slow, pedestrian, occasionally confusing and contains several long, tedious digressions on topics like how to eat Cap'n Crunch cereal properly and how to steal information off your neighbor's computer monitor.    After a few hundred pages, it becomes clear why Stephenson's personal value system led him to write this sort of novel. The people that Stephenson clearly admires most are white, middle-class males with technical educations who are very gung-ho about America's Greatness. In the mid 1940s, these sorts of people were the saviors of civilization. In the 1990s they grew goatees, made their money selling garbage on the internet, and voted for George W. Bush because they were tired of all this gawdam political correctness. Thanks for that, guys!    When the two plots eventually come together, though, things pick up a bit, and I was left quite charmed by what a quick, entertaining read this colossus turned out to be. It also made me a bit sad though, 'cause it's nowhere near as original or groundbreaking as Stephenson's two earlier novels, SNOW CRASH or THE DIAMOND AGE. His desire to tell a good story has apparently been partly (though not wholly, thank god) superseded by middle-aged crankdom.
0440238609|5.0|First, I would define this book as geared for older teens not children.  I (a graduate student studying Molecular Biology) had to have a dictionary with me when reading the first book; that said, I loved it. The first book is written from the main characters perspective, and so well in fact, that when she was by something, so was I. Although in retrospect I should have been able to determine who the said person was.  I clearly am not as well written as the author.  Pullman is able to pull you in and re-direct you in such a fabulous way as to make you giggle or gasp out loud (much to my husband unease).   All I can say was that it was certainly more pleasing and thrilling of a ride than the Potter series and certainly far better written.  I would say this series is written for adult readers, where-as the Potter series is written with the goal of getting small children to read and enjoy reading. In comparison this is a much better written series and much more worthy of attention and glory.    I read the first 2 books in 7 days, and am in the middle of the third.  I have every other book the author has published in my wish list.  * I have not seen the movie, and thus cannot compare*  Adults BUY THIS SERIES!

B000YIGNKE|1.0|I'm afraid there were few redeeming points to this production of 'Persuasion.'  So I'll start there.  Costumes:  Great  Cinamatography: Very Good  Actors: They could have been very good had the screen play been any good.    I kept commenting to my husband that I felt I needed a neck brace since the pace of the story was so quick.  It was so quick, there was no way to get to know the characters.  Jane Austen is probably the English Languages best female writer.  She draws her characters so well that you feel you know them.  You either like them, hate them, or endure them - just like in real life.    This production was poorly done, none of the characters resembled who they were.  to make an analogy - it's like watered down skimmed milk.  Ick.  Captain Wentworth had no depth, and Anne Elliot was so hopeless, she seemed of no use to anyone.     If you did not see this version of 'Persuasion' save yourself the trouble.      See the one acted by Ciaran Hinds and Amanda Root in 1995.  [[ASIN:B00003JRCQ Persuasion]]   It's only 2 hrs long (approx) and even at that short lenght is faithful to the story.  Captain Wentworth has true feeling ... always watching from under his eyelashes without Anne ever knowing.  He is galant, and the abiss of his true emotions are just below his finely chisseled features.  Excellent!!
B000FIMG68|5.0|I wasn't into this show in the beginning, but after catching up on the first season I was hooked.  With the second season of Lost, the mysteries of the island grow numerous.  Seriously...like mangos on a tree.  In this season we learn much more about the others but yet they are still a mystery (or are they?).  We learn about the hatch, its purpose on the island and the connections between it and other strange happenings on the island.  As always, the character development via flashbacks is there and actually provides a lot of insight as to why people act the way they do on the island.  Ooo we learn about Ethan's abduction of Claire (crazy stuff folks)! All in all, an excellent follow up to Season One.  If you are into action, adventure, mystery and a little bit of studying human nature, you'll like this show.
B000HIVIOW|5.0|This is still the quintessential Christmas story, young and old will appreciate it. Excellent drawings by Raymond Briggs
1582701709|2.0|The interesting thing about the Secret is the secret is does not disclose. That is how the author so cleverly tricked thousands upon thousands of people into believing she had some ancient remedy for our social ills. She doesn't but she sure did have a solution to her overdraft and for that she deserves fantastic credit!! well done you.    See other reviews of mine for this era of books in self-help so you don't go wasting your hard earned.
B000HBKCDC|5.0|This is one of the most beautiful Christmas albums ever!! I play it all year long and have given it numerous times for a gift. Sarah McLachlan's goodness shines through.
1400032717|5.0|I read this book years ago, and I have purchased many copies since then as gifts for others.  I am an avid reader, but I have never read a book that was narrated in such a fresh and creative way.  I give this book five stars, but I cannot say the same for Haddon's other books... in fact, I don't think I would even give \\"A Spot of Bother\\" ONE star.  That's okay though, because I am glad that Haddon was able to capture my interest with \\"the curious incident\\"!
B000784WMW|4.0|I read some other people's reviews of various remakes of Jane Eyre. What is striking is that there are so many varieties of taste represented.  What is wonderful for one person is awful for another. That being said, this viewer likes this version of Jane Eyre, all five and one third hours of it. What stands out for me are the beautifully done costumes and the performances of the actors. I especially loved the way Jane and Rochester delivered their lines straight from the pages of the book, with almost no alterations.  So many of the movie versions play fast and loose with the text.  I think that the dialogue parts are like Shakespeare in that they should be quoted verbatim.  This mini series loses nothing by being long and thorough.  Watch it in several days or weeks if you like. Enjoy it with the book nearby. Savor all the parts.
B00003CY6M|4.0|This movie is definitely a chick flick--but both guys and girls will learn to love this movie--it has one of the 'fate' plotlines.
0440238609|4.0|Resonable price for 3 books.  Books came quickly even though it was Christmas time.
B000F7CMRW|4.0|This is another well written and acted, vehicle for Clooney, Matt Damon, Christopher Plummer, Jeffrey Wright and a considerable number of actors whose names suggest Middle Eastern descent. Imagine using actors who acually resemble or share ancestry with the people they're meant to portray. It's a thought provoking portrayal of, how the United States facilitates policy change, over seas, and the events surrounding such an occurrence. Though it's supposed to be based on true events I consider it an opportunity for the viewer to make up their own mind  about how valid is what's being presented. It's definitely worth a look and can be loaned from virtually any public library or purchased inexpensively through Amazon or other retailer. It's also a nod to the increasing efforts of well heeled, established actors more than willing to bring their talents to films pertaining to important, current news topics, presented in an adult and sophisticated manner.
B000PXUA5W|5.0|My son wears his watch everyday even to bed he loves it so much. He is 8 years old & he is able to put it on & take it off when ever he wants with out help. I(mom)love it because it's a one of a kind gift not sold in stores & was a great price on line. I would suggest this gift for a boy or girl who loves Legos.
B000MNP2KI|4.0|I saw this in the theatre first based on word of mouth. I agree with those reviews that this is a refreshing take on the 007 lineage. The opening chase scene is, I think, as exciting as my favorite 007 opening action scene, from 'Golden Eye', where Pierce Brosnan chases a plane off a precipice. The rest of 'Casino' is surprisingly well written and acted. While not perfect I would recommend 'Casino' to anyone interested in a well made action thriller
B000VDDDVO|5.0|A slow moving family movie with excellent taste as it was a 40's movie and a bit lengthy but with the right values that seem to have been lost for most of America
B000UBMZ4S|5.0|What can I say that hasn't already been said? Now with 3 all 3 version's in one collection plus 1 is in HD DVD, its even better. The audio and video are superb on the HD DVD transfer. I highly recommend this movie to any sci-fi fan.
B000LAZDQA|5.0|Mitchell's film is awesome. It's not just a 'gay themed' film and I really hate to see it get labelled that way. Everybody should see this. It's like a night at your favorite overblown gay bar on drugs. It's a goofy, very explicit take on the big O and emotional intimacy versus sexual. The Making Of parts of the DVD were excellent as well. I had no idea the grief and trouble Mitchell and the cast and crew went through just because they chose to show male nudity (big deal!). I'd recommend it to anyone as long as they were over 18.
0446401307|3.0|If you love Harry Bosch, you will both enjoy this book and find it frustrating. Here you will find Bosch's trademark authority-resisting swagger, his spot-on instincts about other people, his weakness for lady FBI agents -- all the things that make him a great hard-boiled detective. He is honorable enough to want to take a bullet for one of his partners in this case, but realistic enough to know that he has to defer to her in this instance. Most of the time he calls the plays perfectly, but he is still fallible and makes some pretty serious mistakes (the mention of which would make me a spoiler).     But while the mystery of who did what to whom and why they did it, does get tied up here, Bosch himself moves from one complicated position to another, and the novel leaves us with more painful questions about his mental state and indeed his very future than we started out with. This tension -- between a relatively straightforward plot (one reader accurately compared it to an episode of \\"24\\") and an increasingly desperate detective -- remains unresolved, which gives the book an unfinished and frustrating feel. I hope Connelly gets back to Harry soon, because I for one don't like being left in this kind of suspense!
B00003CXAA|5.0|Given as a gift but it was definitly top on his list of gifts. He said it was excellent.
B000002L9W|5.0|So, what do you do when you release an EP called 'Crazy from the Heat', and suddenly find yourself needing a band?  You get Steve Vai to play guitar and you release this album.  From opening lick to final chord, this is a fun, rocking album.  This is probably Dave at his best (Skyscraper is a very close second).  Dave solo is a more bluesy sound.  This is a good thing though.  I think some of the VH stuff was slightly out of his vocal range, but he did a good job of it and he came back to his range in his solo stuff.  THIS IS A MUST OWN FOR ANY ROCK/HARD ROCK/METAL FAN.
0307387178|3.0|I found this book only mildly interesting.  Krakauer obviously shares McCandless's fantasy of being a wanderer and a drifter, but the difference is that McCandless's arrogance led him to be a bit delusional.  Anyone who would wander into the tough Alaskan wilderness without proper provisions or an emergency backup plan must be a little crazy.
B0000AQS6R|5.0|This movie starts our family holiday season - we always watch it on or around Thanksgiving and we use many of the phrases in our every day conversation.  For instance . . . \\"are ya serious Clarke?\\"
0151001634|5.0|This is now my absolute favorite tragic novel. I can't justify how sincerely and compellingly Charlie's journal conveys his warmth and spirit. Charlie evolves from mental disability to genius and devolves back into intellectual darkness. But where we begin to see his intelligence shine through, we see his unhappiness and dissatisfaction with the world grow. His elation at the realization that he is growing smarter every day is matched only by his desperation and terror that his descent is even more rapid.     I bawled during the last ten pages or so, sharing his horror and deep sadness that he would soon forget who he was and who he had been. After a few moments of reflection, I began to wonder if the rise and fall of Charlie's intelligence was not overshadowed by his emotional journey. As a \\"retarded\\" adult, he was happy just knowing that he made others happy. As a genius, he was miserable in the thought that others were laughing at him. Finally, in the end, he again is able to recognize that happiness comes from making others happy. But he also has the knowledge of himself that he did not have at the beginning of the story.     Is he really better off having experienced the intellectual and emotional journey? Does his achievement of emotional enlightenment at the end balance his descent into intellectual darkness?
B000001GPX|4.0|This was supposed to be the greatest Beethoven Fifth ever recorded. It was fine until the fourth movement. Then it became a funeral march. Give me Reiner or Szell anytime.  However the Seventh was excellent.
B000YMBBH0|5.0|I bought the trilogy as a Christmas Gift For my Mother-In-Law but I have seen them all. Great movies, and yes, she does like that stuff... really. I can't wait to borrow them and see them again. They are thrillers; they have the suspense, and are the thinking person's action movies. Thanks for the great service. That probably has to be shared amongst Amazon and the UPS and God for the quick delivery. It got there 2 days before the projected ETA.
B0006Z2LP6|5.0|It is my father's favorite movie, thus his favorite Christmas gift. It is a great movie, and does make a nice gift for that generation who lived during the event.

B00005JPXY|2.0|They made a mistake by using the handheld for the whole thing.  It was scarey but I almost walked out near the begining because the begining party scene was too long.  It reminded me of being at ground zero on 9-11.  The acting was pretty bad too in some cases.  Unfortunately the worst was the guy holding the camera- terrible actor. And it would have been deeper if we had a little more information about the creatures.  The stupid jocks we're following around are too stupid to think much about it.  They stole the running rat scene from 28 Days Later, and let's face it- they stole the whole camera thing from Blair Witch.  This could have been a great film with normal cameras.
B000YA82F6|4.0|Ellen Page is incandescent and brings a razor-sharp wit to the role of Juno MacGuff, an unwed teen who finds herself preggers, so much so that the zinging lines seem overtly scripted.  The high-school slang at times is so dense you may need English subtitles.  (Do they really talk this way in Mankato, MN high schools?)    June's dweeby boyfriend -- Bleek -- seems too much like a zero and a loser to be revealed as her one true love.  Casting him as a track athlete would also seem to be a stretch, given his baby fat and general Napoleon Dynamite persona.      Minor quibbles for a charming film that will likely keep you entertained during the 90-minute ride.  Jason Bateman does a great job as the conflicted (adoptee) Dad-to-be. J.K. Simmons is great as Juno's understanding Dad, an HVAC specialist who is wise and compassionate.       Quirky folk-like songs complete the engaging soundtrack.      Worth seeing!
B000VBJEEG|1.0|Wanted to see this and bought it ..not exactly new...and when watching this was so disappointed when the disc stopped and would not go on...Had to return it and will try again...RATS!!!!
B000LXHK2C|4.0|I initially happened upon this movie while playing \\"channel roulette\\" flipping through TV channels. This was playing on HBO. I am a fan of Russell Crowe, so I thought I would give it a shot. I was pleasantly surprised by this movie. What I liked most about this movie was how beautifully it was photographed. I have never been to France, and, quite frankly, there are many places I would like to see before France. \\"A Good Year\\" was so well photographed that I might consider going to France and put up with all that \\"attitude.\\" There was some good natured give and take that poked fun at the cultural differences among the French, English, and Americans and the \\"sterotypical\\" characterizations. Nobody is perfect!      Nice story, good acting, and beautiful photography prompted me to by the DVD. Tres bien!
B000RZIGVS|3.0|Well, being a huge Star Trek fan, it goes without saying that I would enjoy the collection. The only thing missing is an episode guide. Something that had the Episode title with a brief discription would have been helpful.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|I watched most of Planet Earth when it aired, but I wanted to have this amazing collection.  Nothing compares to what those who filmed this have managed to capture. It is a pleasure to watch again and again.
B0010X745K|4.0|I have to admit, I was hesitant to watch this movie. When I left the theater, I was shocked to my very core--this was NOT what I read in the novella, and not what I was expecting...in a very, very GOOD way.<br /><br />Frank Durabont, the writer/director of other Stephen King adaptations such as The Shawshank Redemption and The Green Mile manages to yet again improve on an already superior work by King.<br /><br />This is one movie that is BETTER than the book.<br /><br />It begins with a still shot of our protagonist, David Drayton, painting a cover for an upcoming movie (Dark Tower fans, you will be pleased!). A storm sweeps through their sleepy town, scaring Drayton's family into a storm shelter. After it dies down, the family goes outside to examine the damage, and notice a thick, oppressive mist in the distance. To gather supplies for a sure period of power failure, David, his young son and next door neighbor make a quick trip into town to gather supplies...and everything goes awry.<br /><br />The mist closes in on the town, coating the quiet seaboard with a thick, opressive cloak of impenetrable dew. Everyone in the general store is frightened, especially when bloodied townspeople rush in, claiming that there are \\"monsters in the mist\\". The survivors in the store divide into groups--those who believe humanity is being punished for their sins, led by a TERRIFYING Marcia Gay Harden as Mrs. Carmody; those who believe firmly in rationality and that there is nothing out there, led by lawyer Norton; and those that know something is out there, but don't want to rush to any unfoolish conclusions led by David Drayton.<br /><br />The Mist is a wonderful exercise in humanity under duress, and marks a brilliant attempt at an apocalypse story. The ending of the movie is not how it is in the short story--and makes the movie all the better for it (in fact, Stephen King himself has said that if he had thought of this particular ending, he would have written it).<br /><br />There are some flaws with the story--the crappy CGI for one, some unnecessary scenes involving secondary characters...but overall, this movie is one of the most haunting, terrifying stories brought to screen in a long time.<br /><br />Highly recommended.CGI for one, some unnecessary scenes involving secondary characters...but overall, this movie is one of the most haunting, terrifying stories brought to screen in a long time.

0143038419|5.0|I'm drawn to Liz.  I even find her book inspirational.  Perhaps I'm at a similar point in my life, but I am comforted by her experiences and comfortable with her voice and her writing style.  The book has inspired me to write more, and I'm grateful for that.  I wonder if I'll find the voice of God in my own writing?
B000F3T3CS|4.0|This production is lovely in almost every respect. The scenery, costumes, lighting and direction all are appropriate and most of the time are very effective. The cast they assembled for this performance is about as big a name cast as you could put together for a single opera these days. Netrebko, Villazon, Nucci and D'Arcangelo are all big names in the opera world now, and in the case of Nucci for several years.     Anna Netrebko as Adina is beautifully cast, she looks the part and acts the part well, and even if her voice doesn't always have the agility required for this role she places everything well and sings as sweetly as I ever heard her.    Leo Nucci as Belcore is surprising, he is no longer a young man, but sings and acts the role with as much energy and confidence as I have seen. He doesn't necessarily look the part of the strapping, young womanising soldier but you tend to forgive this in opera.    Ildebrando D'Arcangelo as Dulcamara for me is the highlight. He has a comic genius that has shone through many productions of many operas in the past, no more so than his Leporello at the Salzburg festival. In this his voice is supple and agile, as he always is. His gondolier song with Adina and his entrance aria should be held up as examples and models for the next generation of young singers... no patter here... a perfectly placed, and sung, not spoken, performance here.    For me, the weakest link in this cast was Villazon. No one denies that the man has an amazing voice and a wonderful energetic presence on stage, but for Nemorino, his voice just isn't right. His voice at times is far too heavy, or as another reviewer stated 'muscular'. The best he sound in this opera is towards the end where Nemorino becomes forceful, knowing what he wants and knowing he can get it; Villazon's power really works here. But in the lighter moments like the beautiful aria 'Una Furtiva Lagrima' his voice is too harsh and displays little nuance or affection for the material. He also has a bad tendency to scoop to notes towards to top of his range which takes away from the purity of the performance. The encore that is done after this aria was a surprise... I didn't think the performance was good enough to get an encore... stunt? Perhaps? I would have preferred either Juan Diego Florez or Roberto Alagna (although Alagna doesn't have the voice of Villazon or Florez)... but the commercial attraction of pairing Villazon and Netrebko (who have a very obvious, powerful onstage chemistry)would be too much to turn down for a company life the Weiner Staatsoper.    The musical direction of Eschwe is fine, tight, controlled and full of life an fun... what more do you want for L'Eliser.     I love this opera and I love this production... I don't think that anyone could walk away from it without enjoying some aspect of the performance. If you get it you wont be disappointed.
B000VBJEEG|5.0|Good movie about following your dreams!  Originally saw at the theatre, the crowd seemed pleased at the end, from little ones to grandmas!  Personally, I loved it!
B000LC55F2|5.0|The Prestige is one of those films that doesn't come along much anymore.  It is not a remake or based loosely off a video game. This film is a smart, creative, original, and beautifully crafted masterpiece.  It's actually quite hard to describe because it is indeed very different.    The script itself is largely complex at times.  Many twists and turns leave the viewer wondering what the hell is going on.  This makes The Prestige very fun to watch over and over(as MANY have noted).  I have watched the film a few times and I still have to think about the events that are going on and what is really happening within them.  There hasn't been too many films like that made, especially made lately.  So many films become too dumbed done or boring nowadays.  It is refreshing to see a movie that can truly challenge ones mind at times.  To be frank, I haven't ever seen a film quite like this.  It's astonishing how good this script is.    The acting is wonderful here.  Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale have really proven themselves that they are very talented.  Bale is quickly becoming one of my favorite actors in Hollywood today; he is very good.  His performance surprised me because of how good it was.  I haven't seen too many Hugh Jackman films, but theres no mistaking that the man can act.  It is cool how at first the viewer almost roots for his character, but as time goes on that changes.  Michael Caine is always amazing; this film is no exception.  I'm not a huge Scarlett Johansson fan, but she did well.  Better than what I expected actually.  Certainly wasn't too hard to look at either!      Nolan's directing is so incredible here.  The man puts his heart in his art and it shows 100%.  The way the film is shot is also almost hard to describe because it is absolutely beautiful in every sense of the word.  The lighting and photography go beyond incredible.  The two work together  perfectly creating the slightly dark mood for the film and it works great.  The film is bathed in deep rich colors and textures.  Almost as good of eye candy as Johansson.    I thoroughly enjoyed The Prestige.  More so upon numerous viewings though.  It really grows on you and takes some time for it to fully settle in.  It is a complex film filled with mystery, rage, rivalry, and emotion.  The film keeps a steady perfect pace and never becomes boring.  It is a gorgeous piece of art.  A near perfect film that is highly recommended.

0060899220|4.0|This entertaining tour through the life of a restaurant kitchen made me think twice the next time I ate out.  I liked it on 2 levels: a warning for diners, and - even more interesting - as a sociological study, with the structure, interplay and hijinks of the cooking culture. I got tired of the author's \\"attitude\\" but he writes well. It's organized and neatly leads the reader to the most interesting chapters on \\"A Day in the Life\\" (a typical day in his kitchen) and the Life of Bryan (the chef's kitchen down the street).  Told with memorable humor, this chef's confessional is worth a read.

I received this book for Christmas, and every recipe I have used has turned out amazingly!!! Didn't think pancakes would taste good without cow's milk? HA!! Chocolate chip cookies need eggs and butter? Think again! The title is quite appropriate, as Colleen really has brought the joy back to baking for me. Your non-vegan friends will no longer make faces at your \\"weird\\" food. Instead, they'll be asking you for the recipes, as mine have done. I will never again enter my kitchen, attempting to make something new without consulting Colleen!!!

B000A5044C|2.0|This film is set in Tokyo and is about 4 children, fathered by four men to one mother (who is/was a prostitute).     The mother lives a mysterious live and abandons the children for increasing periods of time. The children don't go to school and are not known to anyone. In fact, the mother has to smuggle three of them into their rented flat in suitcases so the landlord does not know they exist. The film tells the story of how the children survive.    The problem I have with this film is that while the original premise of the plot is original and potentially interesting, the story becomes more and more unbelievable (I don't want to give too much of the plot away). Where are social services, the police, the landlord etc (the children are eventually unable to pay bills and have water, gas and electricity cut off). In fact where was the plot. Character development is poor. The mother's character is not developed (and she is surely the pivotal character). There is also some random school girl who ends up spending more and more time with them. What happened to her parents?    The last bit of the film is the most unbelievable part and brings together all of what I have said nicely.
B000U0F7RG|5.0|When I ordered this boxset I was a bit worried since so many people have been complaining about the format and the look of it. However, I really like the way it has been done. It has been done in good quality and so I don't understand what all the fuss is about!     I'm really happy with the boxset, now I can finally see all the seasons that haven't been aired over here in the UK. On another note, I'm really surprised at how quick shipping was!    So for all of you a bit worried about the quality and price, I wouldn't be since it is definitely a substantial boxset and of good quality! Plus you get all the seasons in a nice padded box!

B000002J03|5.0|Decided to start a new Christmas Tradition this year.  Give each of my children, (21 & 23 yrs) two of my all time favorite Classic Rock CD's.  Every Christmas.  It's kind of fun...figuring out which to give.  This year I gave this CD (Led Zeppelin II) and The Who, \\"Who's Next\\".  I was pleasantly surprised, how much they thought it was a excellent idea.  Coming from the \\"queen of hip hop\\" and my son \\"very,very,very hard rock fan, they both seem to be broadening their musical tastes.  Quoting my hip hop daughter.....Zeppelin Rocks Dad!!!

1582701709|4.0|According to THE SECRET by Rhonda Byrne (2006), the secret to a happy and fulfilling life is \\"the law of attraction\\". As I read it, phrases echoing with what I was taught from the Bible as a child, and try to live as an adult, resonated along my nerve endings. Reading this book reminded me of the power of personal faith and positive thinking. It reminds me to ask with the faith (knowing) that I will receive. It reminds me to walk in the spirit.       This past Christmas, I gave a few people \\"the secret\\" to a happy, productive, and prosperous life. What makes this book and others like it so special is their power to lead us back to the Word. It is a concrete step-by-step guide to activating our lifelines to God (\\"the universe\\"). This book is a good way to jump start a turning away from a dark present and an exhilarating kick out of the daily plodding walk in the ruts of depression where surviving each day is almost too much to do. The message it contains makes THE SECRET worthy of its cost.

B000PTYPAC|5.0|I'll be damned if Hayley Williams doesn't become a rock icon in the next 5-10 years.  She's not only one of the most talented female rock singers of the modern day, but she's a gorgeous ginger and only 19 years old.  Meanwhile, Paramore is already a constant on rock mainstreams with their second full length album and their popularity is growing by the day. 'Riot!' is nothing short of a masterpiece and indisputably one of the best albums of 2007.  I hear comparisons to No Doubt, but Gwen and the boys were more dependent on computer generated sound and better known for their dance pop (Hey Baby, Hella Good) and their power ballads (Don't Speak).  Paramore appears to be the next Tsunami Bomb in the making, only younger and more energetic with a wider appeal.  Lyrically, Hayley writes in a poetic fashion and discusses internal issues well beyond her years.<br />\\"Misery Business\\", the lead single, is said to be one of Hayley Williams' true life experiences of manipulation in relationships.  Her vocals soar to unbelievable heights in this song, showing her range off in a stylish and edgy manner.  This has quickly become one of my favorite songs of all time.<br /><br />The second single is \\"Hallelujah\\", a strong pop rock track with sizzling guitars and powerful vocals.  The chorus is well composed and beautifully sung.  On the other end of the spectrum \\"Crushcrushcrush\\", the third single is driven by angrier vocals and darker guitar riffs, probably the best guitar work I've heard from Paramore on either album.  I'm not crazy about the chorus, but the verses of this song are nothing short of incredible.<br />Other notable tracks:<br />\\"For A Pessimist I'm Pretty Optimistic\\"<br />\\"That's What You Get\\"<br />\\"When It Rains\\"<br />\\"Fences\\"<br />\\"Born For This\\"<br /><br />No sophomore slump for this band, only an encore that turns the heads of rock fans of every generation.  'Riot!' is not only a must buy, but you'd be foolish not to look into 'All We Know Is Falling' as well.  Some people may remember briefly seeing the video for 'Emergency' hit MTV.  That's only scratching the surface with this group.  Not only is their studio mastery evident on the discs they release, but they've also become widely known (as quoted by AP Magazine) for their truly exceptional stage presence and performance.

B000RJO58M|5.0|With such a strange title for a review the review is actually referring to the film's elements being complete while completely entertaining.  I was not shocked that I laughed as much as I did but I was pleasantly surprised that my girlfriend enjoyed the movie as well.  She primarily watches movies of 1 or 2 star fame in addition to films that are considered classics such as Casablanca.  That being said, this film caters to a greater audience and has the capacity to be entertaining to everyone.  It is wholesome in that it has a great plot with the perfect combinations of twists and turns.<br />The high definition quality you can read somewhere else.  Combo Discs are always a bonus in my opinion.
B00005JOFQ|5.0|I checked out this movie to see what all the controversy was about, it being the butt (no pun) of a lot of jokes.  I watched it with an open mind and found it to be a beautifully filmed, heart wrenching film.  Most already know the gist of it so I won't dwell on it (I won't mention how it ends) but it is about a rodeo rider and a ranch hand (Jack Twist and Ennis Del Mar) who get hired to herd sheep on Brokeback Mountain in 1963.  They begin a relationship there which, at first, appears violent but, in the next love scene, looks very tender.      Twist (played by the very handsome Jake Gyllenhaal) wants to start a life with his new friend but the reticent Del Mar (he mumbles as if he has marbles in his mouth--actually he reminds me a little of Boomhower from King of the Hill in terms of sometimes not being able to understand what he is saying)) does not believe it will ever work due to a horrible sight he had as a kid of the corpse of a man who was in a homosexual relationship beaten and dragged to death by a hate-filled gang which included, perhaps, Del Mar's father.  Del Mar (played by Heath Ledger) had plans to marry and both men do marry and have families of their own but are never really happy.  Twist is married to a cold woman and is despised by his father-in-law.  Del Mar's wife witnessed her husband and Twist kissing which created an unspoken resentment that led to the marriage failing.  The only happiness the men have is the occasional times they return to their hidden companionship and love life on Brokeback Mountain.  Even these good times are hampered by the fact that they must return to their lonely lives in the outside world.    I think there was a lot more tenderness between the men that could have been shown.  So much of their time together includes harsh words and physical violence.  Such love is revealed when Twist admits to his friend, \\"The truth is, sometimes I miss you so much I can hardly stand it.\\"  Another review used the word \\"understated,\\" and I think that is an excellent description of the film.  However understated it is, it had me crying at the end.      The scenery of Brokeback Mountain is beautiful and the film does an excellent job aging the characters as the film progresses through 20 years.  It is 2 hours and 15 minutes and, though it is not particularly fast-moving, it is interesting enough to hold one's attention throughout.  The extras (i.e. \\"The Making of..\\") are very well-done although there is a lot of the predictable praising between actors.  I don't know if it is the type of film I could watch numerous times, but it does make me want to read the short story which inspired it.

B0007TKNL0|5.0|I would recommend this Special Edition set over the others. Not only is it a great movie to watch, but the Special Edition gives you so much more than just the movie!
B00122O34O|5.0|I absolutely love this soundtrack, like seriously want to marry it. This is a great compilation that leaves me at peace and not wanting to kill anyone after a long hard day. To hear  Michael Cera & Ellen Page sing was very cool, I want to see the movie but the Mormon town I'm in isn't playing it...grrrr...definitely worth the buy.
B000LPS47U|4.0|Ever since my husband watched this movie years ago, he got hooked on it. It's one of the classic Sci-Fi Zombie movies he finds worth re-visiting and watching, again and again. If you're a Sci-Fi, Zombie, Horror movie watcher, then this is the movie for you.

B0012NVGHU|5.0|A total revelation.  Set in Dublin two unnamed musicians find each other on the streets and a sweet collaboration occurs with his songs and her conviction in the power of his music.  Both have people in their past that they still have feelings for and this the source for the power of the amazing music and their bitter-sweet relationship.  Great rental through Tivo-Unbox.
B000VBJEEG|4.0|I bought it as a Christmas gift for my favorite kids.  However, we all gathered around ( with snacks) and watched with the little ones. We all had a good time, and I bought a copy for myself.
B000Z0OX9O|5.0|This is a very entertaining album.  The first disc is the soundtrack release of Blade Runner from 1994, the second disc features unreleased music from the film's score, and the final disc has new material from the composer Vangelis.  The music to Blade Runner stands alone as a very illuminating and inspiring piece.  Most of the score is synthesized and jazz influenced.  The fan of Blade Runner will enjoy this album.
B000IJ7Q32|4.0|I never paid much attention to recent climate changes and the hype around global warming. Maybe that makes me a bit ignorant, but regardless, I choose to read this book because I thought it was broader then just societies dealing with the environment. I was pleasantly surprised with all his examples of cultures present and past, explaining (in great detail, I might add) what potentially caused certain civilizations to bite the big one. I majority of this did revolve around their environment, and the author laid that as the foundation for all his examples while interweaving every other factor of its collapse thru that. This I truly found interesting. The picture he painted about China I found the most intriguing, especially as they grow and, as he explains, will further tie all of their problems into the rest of the world thru our global society. He concluded with his points of us destroying our natural world and why, based on all his previous examples, this might not be in our best interest (duh?!?). I almost felt like I was just waiting for him to eventually get to this thru the whole book. After reading all his examples, its hard not to think about it. Were not going to mess up the earth, that'll re-structure itself based on what we do and move forward. We are, however, just going to screw ourselves, and (all of us) will allow our greed to bring our own demise. Yes, I am happy I read it. The case studies were worth it, and the knowledge gained is very practical.

1400097029|3.0|I am conflicted about saying The Sea is well-written, because on the one hand the language is quite lovely and beautiful (almost like reading a painting, if that makes sense), but on the other hand there are stylistic choices that Banville uses quite often that really disrupt the narrative. He uses too many appositives and asides that turn an otherwise nicely written sentence into a laborious and jagged mess. I assume this is meant to mirror the narrator's thought-process and memory-reconstruction as he writes, but I'm sorry, it just gets annoying fast. Here's a mild example:<br /><br />\\"My forbearance in Chloe's case was due, I believe, to a strong urge of protectiveness that I had toward her. Let me explain, it is interesting, I think it is interesting.\\"<br /><br />First off, the comma-delineated phrase \\"I believe\\" can be deleted entirely. *Of course* this is what he believes, he's the narrator! Or it could be moved to the beginning of the sentence so the commas don't slow us down. The second sentence is completely unnecessary. Don't tell us you want to explain, just explain it! It's what you've been doing for the past 120 pages anyway. Finally, \\"I think it is interesting\\" needs to be its own sentence. As it is now, it's a comma splice.<br /><br />Here are a couple of others:<br /><br />\\"We seemed to spend, Chloe and Myles and I, the most part of our days in the sea.\\"<br /><br />\\"This one took place -- no, was exchanged -- no, was consummated, that is the word, in the corrugate-iron picture house...\\"<br /><br />\\"We cornered him, the three of us, behind a concrete groyne.\\"<br /><br />You get the idea. Banville uses clauses and phrases like these all the time, and while I understand their theoretical importance to the story, they make for very difficult and frustrating reading.<br /><br />Finally, I have one other complaint, and that is that there is no focus in this novel. There are pages at a time when the narrator jumps between different events in each paragraph. Each paragraph represents some memory of an event or incident that happened when he spent time with Chloe and Myles, and each memory is independent and unrelated to the rest. They are there solely to develop small bits of character, but the overall impression I got was of a very disjointed narrative that never really found its foothold to begin with.hat happened when he spent time with Chloe and Myles, and each memory is independent and unrelated to the rest.

B000Y179KO|3.0|OK, no point getting all philosophical and overly analytical here, others have already done that.  This album is disappointing, and man I never thought I would say that about the Eagles.  The problem is that this is not an Eagles album.  Most of the songs were written solo or by non-band members.  A few are Don and Glen, but the magic really is not there. You get a few Don Henley songs which, as another reviewer noted, really do seem to be right off of Inside Job cutting room floor (Frail Grasp on the Big Picture, Business as Usual - as if you could not tell from the titles who wrote these). One or two harken back to On The Border (How Long), and throw in some typical Joe songs, etc.  Don was quoted as saying he thought this should have been a single album, and he was right.  The songs do not flow together at all, a number are just really sub-par, and the album seems piecemeal and weak.  For the first time ever I actually skip numerous songs on an Eagles album.  No, it certainly is not garbage as some reviewers have said, but neither is this anything at all of the quality of any prior Eagles album. Disappointing, unfortunately.
B00068NVI4|5.0|Yes can still enlighten us with their idealistic nature while electrifying fans and listeners alike with their musical craft. The first half of this show has the band rocking out with power jams, especially on great classics like \\"South Side Of The Sky,\\" and \\"Your Is No Disgrace.\\" The second half contains some extended plays too, and Wakeman's keyboard craft is still very distinguished, but the band offers a different spin on some of their classics with a slower, acoustic-like play on \\"Roundabout,\\" and \\"Owner Of A Lonely Heart,\\" and they pull it off. As a major musical force that helped to exemplify progressive rock back in the 70's, Yes are a classic but everlasting presence as they celebrate their love and ritual of music within the 21st century.

0060512806|5.0|I'm not a 5-star freak.  Very little is truly perfect, but I'm going to destroy my credibility up front by saying this is my favorite book.  Ever.  What makes me insane about Neal Stephenson's books is that I can't say definitavely what determines \\"the crack facor.\\"  In the first chapter, with the introduction of Bobby Shaftoe clinging to the side of a truck and composing haiku, I was hooked, completely addicted as to a drug.  Other Stephenson books have not grabbed me as intensly, namely, and sadly, the somewhat-prequel series The Baroque Cycle.  Other of his books are nearly as addictive: Diamond Age and Zodiac to name two.    This book spans decades and follows two families that become intertwined between the events of WW2 and the present day.  The depths of love, death, war, math, facial hair, jungle adventure, wisdom teeth, politics, communications and every sub-topic of geekology you can imagine are plummed.  I read this book the first time on a back-packing trip to South America, and carried the 12 lb trade paperback for a month after I'd read it because I hadn't found anyone who evinced enough passion over my description to be entrusted with it's ownership.  It ended up with 2 kiwis who I hope gave it a good home.  I've re-read it many times since and, simply, can't recommend it enough if you want to be intelligently and absorbingly entertained.

B000AGTPUU|5.0|If you have a chance to see this movie even in IMAX I highly recommend it. It tells of the spirit of Christmas that we possesed as children and hopefully still remember as adults.  Tom Hanks out did himself in this movie playing many of the roles himself.  The animation and music was well represented. The music warms the heart.  Sure to be a holiday classic many years from now.

The younger generation who has only seen that one may not warm to this version as quickley, but I love it. More details! And this one makes it much more clear at the end how bad what Lydia has done is, a concept that seems a little lost in the movie theatre version. My husband doesen't get it. But I know the rest of you Jane Austin fans do!

0634060384|4.0|If you play jazz, you will eventually have to have a real book. If you play a C instrument, this is probably the one you need. If you don't play jazz and haven't got a good musical foundation to build on, you won't be able to do much with this book without the help of a good instructor. If you just want some chords and notes for some tunes, there might be cheaper, better solutions (but I doubt it). Invariably, this will be missing one or two tunes that you really like, that you really thought were jazz standards, that you were sure would be in this book but are not, in which case, empty your tip jar and check out editions like [[ASIN:063406021X The Real Book - Volume II: C Instruments 2nd Edition (Real Books (Hal Leonard))]].
B00005N5S5|5.0|This may be the greatest science fiction film ever made.  In my opinion there should have been no sequels to it.  It was a perfect story in this single film.  No more was required.    The future is bleak, filled with destruction and genocide at the hands of the machines.  The Terminators are cybernetic organisms with the purpose of finding, and destroying, humans wherever they are found.    The special effects in this film have mixed results.  Some are still very well done.  Others are obviously dated to the 80s.  Despite that flaw this is the perfect sci-fi story.  Time travel, evil machines and robots, nuclear holocaust, murder, and one human being who must survive in order for the human race to survive the terror of the rise of the machines.    So many \\"sci-fi\\" films are so crummy that they give the sci-fi fans little to enjoy and the viewers have to leave much of what they watch to their own imaginations.  Not so with The Terminator.  It is a fully realized visual story and I give it 5 stars for it's impact on the science fiction genre.  Far more menacing and terrible than the follow up films, this movie is a classic that will stand the test of time.  It is too bad that movies of this quality of production and story come along only once or twice a decade.
B000000Y59|5.0|This is, for me, the quintessential Bill Evans album. Bill's trio finally had settled into their groove, and man, could they swing! This has lots of classic jazz standards and despite being recorded in the early days of stereo, the sound is terrific. If you need to delve deeper into what Bill was doing at the time, [[ASIN:B000AMJEKA The Complete Village Vanguard Recordings, 1961]] is a must buy companion, but this album a cornerstone of any serious jazz collection.

B000002I4S|4.0|I've never been a big fan of Coltrane because I find his later stuff to be too remote for me to enjoy. That's why I was surprised at how much I liked this album. I suppose John was just getting his feet under him in the jazz music world when he developed the style and songs that led to this album, which may be why I find it more refreshing and more rewarding to listen to than his later stuff. It may be I just didn't hear the right recordings or songs when I began my jazz journey. Whatever the reason, I consider this Coltrane's most accesible and enjoyable work, and obviously, this is an integral part of any jazz music core collection (just ask [[ASIN:0141023279 The Penguin Guide to Jazz Recordings: Eighth Edition (Penguin Guide to Jazz Recordings)]] if you don't believe me.)
B00005YW4H|1.0|... filing this CD under \\"Jazz\\". Only a generation spoiled by years of radio listening could come to the idea of calling anything (anything!)that sounded different \\"Jazz\\". But it isn´t. It doesn´t swing, it has little to no improvisation, it´s got no compositions to speak of. You could call this music \\"Popcountry-Kitsch\\" or maybe campfire music, the same thing Michelle Shocked did 20 years ago. But in the genre of \\"Popcountry-Kitsch\\" it sure deserves 5 stars.  Just listen to any song by Charles Mingus and you´ll understand what I mean!
B00000337U|3.0|I bought this album expecting something different. I'm not sure this is jazz, or rock, or what it is. As a budding jazz pianist, I thought I couldn't go wrong with something that had Keith Jarrett on it. And don't get me wrong, this is a good album. I just don't consider Gary Burton all that great, so the Throb portion of this CD (9 of the 14 tracks) is basically dead to me. Thankfully, the other five tracks are great. Grow your own is the classic acid-jazz-rock anthem (or whatever you want to call it) and it's fun to mess around with that and Como en Vietnam with the score straight out of [[ASIN:0634060384 The Real Book: Sixth Edition]]. I think, for me, however, that the music of the late sixties and early seventies that isn't classic rock is not all that interesting to listen to, so I won't get much play out of this CD.

B0000047CX|3.0|You can't be a serious jazz fan and not own this album. That's for sure. I bought it expecting more, but it took me back to listening to my parents' records on the dining room floor in front of the console stereo. The sound and style are very dated, which is not necessarily a bad thing. And sure, I was young and carefree in the 60's, but I won't be playing this album much except when I need to practice some \\"Ipanema\\" licks before a gig. That is to say, as good as it is, and even though it is a cornerstone of Latin jazz, I won't listen to it very often, at all.

0307386864|5.0|This -its author's most popular novel-revolves around the Bennett family which consists of Mother,Father and 5 daughters.The family is not wealthy and marrying off the progeny to suitable young men is a financial necessity, something felt particularly sharply by the Mother.The family and the district roundabout is thrown into confusion by the arrival of 2 wealthy young men both of whom are unattached.There is Charles Bingley who leases a house close to the Bennett home ,and his friend Mr Darcy with whom he shares. Visits are exchanged between the households and Bingley falls in love with the eldest Bennett daughter ,Jane.The second daughter ,Elizabeth, and Darcy circle each other warily.There is much verbal sparring and Elizabeth-clever,witty and ironic-finds herself intrigued by Darcy while being repelled by his apparent aloofness and seemingly arrogant demeanour.She also hears negative things of him from other people.Events conspire to keep the pair apart and a mix of social snobbery,self-will and just plain misunderstandings are other barriers that must be overcome if true love is to triumph over its enemies -pride and prejudice.<br />I have concentrated above on the relationship between darcy and Elizabeth but while this is the key relationship in the book it also has some well drawn supporting figures such as Lady Catherine de Bourgh ,a monster of snobbery and self-satisfaction personifying the aristocaracy at its worst  and Mr Collins ,the oleaginous and toadying clergyman whose true colours emerge in his cringe worthy proposal to Elizabeth.<br />The book is popular as a romance and while recognising this dimension to it have to say that for me it works best as a social comedy and an acute dissection of manners and relationships.It is among the great literary comedies as well as romances and is very clear eyed and unsentimental about such matters as marriage and social convention .<br /><br />This is not just a museum piece and deserves its wide readership
B000OPO6VU|5.0|This is one of Emerson, Lake, and Palmer's best studio albums.  It has a much more polished feel than Tarkus did, and the songwriting (save for one song) is exemplary.  The opening song, The Endless Enigma, is one of their signature songs, another epic (running 10 1/2 minutes if you include the fugue), and one that doesn't get put into the category of epic ELP tracks (but it should).  It also has some of Lake's best lyrics, brooding and mysterious.  From the Beginning is one of Lake's loveliest ballads, and Emerson and Palmer's accompaniment is really subtle and compliments the song beautifully.  The Sheriff is really intricate and entertaining, and I love Hoedown.  The title track is majestic, with some of Emerson's best piano playing ever.  The final track, Abaddon's Bolero, starts out slowly, but builds to a magnificent climax.  The only dud here is Living Sin, mainly due to the smarmy, sleazy lyrics.  The music isn't bad, but the lyrics (and Lake's vocal) really detract from it.  But aside from that one song, the album is pretty damn perfect, and it's one of ELP's best studio albums.
B000ATQYT2|5.0|Muppet Christmas Carol has been a family tradition for several years. When my kids were younger, we received the Video tape. I played it as we decorated our Christmas Tree and the tradition kept growing. They have many 'favorite lines' that they say along with the movie and then laugh like crazy. We all sing a lot of the songs. A favorite is \\"there's only one more sleep 'til Christmas'\\"<br /><br />Now my daughters are 22, 18, and 16 and still schedule that one day of the year when we go cut our tree in Michigan, bring it home, decorate it and drink egg nog and/or hot cider. My oldest daughter had her fiancee join us in 2007 and said it will be a tradition in their new home.<br /><br />I ordered the CD because we had worn out the video tape and they do not sell it by tapes anymore. I like the improved quality of the movie. Other movies have joined our holiday season tradition; Christmas Carol with George C Scott, and Its a Wonderful Life.

B000TLTUL0|4.0|...and he shall sing Sondheim's clever lyrics while Tim Burton unblinkingly depicts the effect of silver straight razor drawn violently across unguarded throats.  And therein lies the rub.  The graphic throat cuttings will, without doubt, repel many viewers, and it will be purely a matter of personal aesthetics whether this puts you off the other fine qualities of this film or not.    I didn't mind the graphic killings, this being, after all, a musical about a multiple murdering barber, although I confess I was surprised at how blatantly Burton chose to depict them.  I anticipated that this material would be a perfect vehicle for Burton's dark imagination and I was not disappointed.  All of the production values: art design, sets, costumes, cinematography are gloriously atmospheric and beautifully set the tone for the macabre tale that will follow.  Burton's camera is as busy as David Fincher's, although always in sync with the story and never intrusive. This is an extremely well made film, imbued with Burton's brilliant sense of design.    All of the cast handle their parts with aplomb.  Johnny Depp acceptably acquits his singing chores and brings the mad intensity and star power to Sweeney that is called for.  He is ably abetted by Helena Bonham Carter and the perfect choices for villains, Alan Rickman and Timothy Spall.    The insidiously clever and funny lyrics and Sondheim's brilliance have been served well, but it will all ultimately come down to those geysering cut throats.  It was a bold choice, and I like that kind of risk taking.  But, I can understand it turning many off.  For those that are not, Sweeney presents a very unusual night at the cinema, and is well worthwhile.
B000VWYJ86|4.0|The latest Bourne film manages to maintain almost the same standard as the first two films. I say almost because this isn't as good as the first two. Its certainly action-packed and a non-stop thrill ride from beginning to end. However, at times it borders on parody as Bourne manages to escape from another car crash, or leap from roof to roof completely unscathed. Any sense that this could really happen is lost in this film.<br /><br />It starts really well (and believeable to) as a Guardian newspaper journalist meets Bourne in London at a packed Waterloo station. This is a great set piece and the best part of the film. After this there are some other great set pieces and a memorable fight with an assasin where there is no background music - another brilliant sequence.<br /><br />However, the Jason Bourne is indestructible element, and the fact that he seems to get from country to country without any problem (the CIA can control cameras at Waterloo station but they can't catch people at Airports??) makes the whole thing totally inplausible. Now I've no doubt that if you analysis the first two films you can probably make the same criticsm - but I think less obviously so.<br /><br />So overall this is a classy action film, but its moved away from the 1960's style espionage film that made the first one so unique.
0439882826|4.0|I saw the creators of this book on Martha Stewart and decided to buy it for my husband who is a life long Star Wars fan.  I could'nt believe that it cost as little as it did considering the amount of labor that went into creating this book.  My husband thought the book was pretty amazing too and loved all the facts and features.
B000P7V45S|2.0|Ok, the music is great and sounds just like I expected, BUT once again (like the Duke CD/DVD) the concert footage is poorly remastered! The audio track does NOT match the video...Phil sings, but his vocals arrive a 'touch' late. Arrrgh!  Same annoying problem on the 'enhanced' Duke 1980 concert footage.    I have the VHS of that Trick of the Tail 1976 concert, and the audio is spot on. Also, the interviews on this DVD are perfect soundtrack-wise, so what's up with the concert audio? Is it just me? I bought the CD/DVD primarily for the incredible Glasgow '76 concert footage, but feel frustrated.  Any comments? Help?

B00000DHZJ|5.0|My best friend and I just discovered Hendrix a short time before he died--what an amazing artist and rocker! One of the 8-tracks I bought back then was Cry of Love--loaded with lesser known but very fine singles. These, along with the classics (Fire, Purple Haze, etc.), are here--making it in my view the best compilation of the best 60's psychodelic rocker. Check out Angel, Dolly Dagger, Night Bird Flying, and more...
B000YENUI6|4.0|I liked \\"A History of Violence,\\" but this movie is more suspenseful and more moving. Viggo plays Nikolai well and the character is interesting. The character is a lost soul, but with a purpose. He does not for a second doubt his path, but he does have small regrets. The violence is intense and comes in small spurts so it is very effective. The movie develops the characters well and the plot is very tight. There is very little wasted effort. Every character has a side to him that you don't expect when the character is first introduced. Every scene unfolds the story. Because of the violence and because the viewer often knows something very bad is going to happen to certain characters, the suspense is kept at a fairly high throughout the movie. The humor is very low key and it comes through Viggo's character. How the russian mob works and it's philosophy was interesting. The story about the tatoos was fascinating as well. The Russian mobster's tatoos reveal his life.    My only minor complaint is that the russian accents are a bit hard to understand at times.     In summary, if you can tolerate Viggo fighting totally nude and some gruesome violence, the movie is very entertaining.

B000AJIF4E|4.0|These headphones are very much worth the price.  I have approximately 20-30 high-end headphones.  I have spent as much as $900.00 for the top of the high-end headphones.  Each set offers different things that are wonderful.<br /><br />The Sony 7506 is no frills.  No leather covered earpads or aluminum fittings.  They fit snugly, but not as constrictive as Sennheiser 600 or 650.  They do not float on your head like the audiophile Audio-Technica models which are excellent.  The earpads fit on the ear rather than surrounding the ear like Audio-Technica.  The phones are closed back and achieve a very good seal as to outside noise.<br /><br />As far as sound, I cannot say that they are flat sounding.  They have an immediate sound stage.  You feel you are on stage with the musicians.  There is no sense of separation from the sources of the music.  The sound is very joyful and dynamic. They are very easily driven by an Ipod.  I have not heard them with a headphone amplifier.  I suspect that a headphone amplifier might make them sound overripe if not on the low gain setting.<br /><br />Often times, I prefer an open-backed headphone because it seems to give you a sound that has more space in it.  I like the more subtle approach, but these headphones do not seem too close.<br /><br />On a technical note, the headphones appear to be made of plastic rather than lightweight metal.  The wires that go to each earcup of the headphones are exposed so that they could be pulled if you do not use them very carefully.  One thing you will note from the Audio-Technica ATH-AD700 (which is approximately the same price) is that the wires to each of the earcups is hidden inside frame of the headphones.  Additionally, I believe (although I am not sure)that the headphone frames of the Audio-Technica ATH-AD700 are metal with metal fittings.  I cannot comment on how long the Sony headphones will last because I have only owned the 7506 for a month or so.  At the same price, you might want to consider the Audio-Technica ATH-AD700 or the Grado SR-80.<br /><br />In short, if you are not a fanatical collector of headphones and only want to purchase one pair, this is an excellent choice.  By the way, by having more than one set of headphones, you in effect have several different stereos--each sounding rather different than the other.  To achieve sound of this caliber from speakers, you would have to spend thousands of dollars to get the quality of sound a listener with good headphones can get from an Ipod featuring huge memory and portability.  Lastly, you will not burden everyone around you in your family with having to listen to the same music you are listening to your music.
B000K15VSA|5.0|It's been 25 years since Ridley Scott originally released his dystopian masterpiece, Blade Runner, and 15 years since the even greater Director's Cut came to realization. But this time Mr Scott has really outdone himself.<br /><br />Not only is \\"Blade Runner: The Final Cut\\" an immensely satisfying movie as it is, but this \\"Five-Disc Ultimate Collector's Edition\\" is about as rewarding as DVD-releases can possibly get: five different versions of the movie (the ultra rare Work Print, Original 1982 Release, International 1982 Release, The Director's Cut and The Final Cut) and such loads of extra features and bonus material that even the most knowledgeable Blade Runner aficionados will be blown away by the plethora of material presented here. This release definitely sets the standard for it's kind henceforth.<br />Timeless Classic in a Priceless Presentation. Not to be missed.
B000VWYJ86|2.0|Matt Damon as Bourne in the first two movies was great with the first production following the Ludlum novel fairly closely with an interesting plot. But like most action franchises, the later movies become parodies of the earlier which is the case in this one.<br />  \\"Ultimatum\\" is simply one long and unlikely chase with little plot, a lot of noise and mindlessly insistent music. After watching \\"Ultimatum\\",  it seemed that the director's chief objective was to try to one-up the opening chase sequences from \\"Casino Royale\\". In \\"Ultimatum\\" there is no acting and any actor could have taken the \\"role\\" of Bourne since virtually all of the work was done by stuntmen.<br />  The same problem exists with the later Bourne novels by Ludlum and Lustbader. In the novels there is an labored effort to stretch the orignal plot well beyond its limits and strive to build dramatic tension with long italized passages and lots of exclamation marks, sort of the print version of endless unlikely explosions.<br />  An NFL game has more plot and sometimes as much noise as \\"Ultimatum\\", but the movie is a fun if unchallenging couple of hours.<br />  Barry Wiley
0385340559|3.0|I might be on the brink of reader tolerance for Jack Reacher's cartoon-like vengeance on the meany-mean bad guys that writer Lee Child concocts. Or maybe this style of reading entertainment is just not suited for me. Either way I didn't enjoy this story as much as the previous \\"The Hard Way\\" but the writing chops is still good enough to have me looking for another outing from the talented Mr. Child.
0790729733|3.0|Of the theatrical release, that is. It looks like a lot of it was from the windy, overwrought closing arguments Jim Garrison made in the Clay Shaw trial. They bordered on Shakesperean soliloquy, suppressed tears and all. I found myself waiting for a bailiff or court reporter or someone to come out and offer Garrison a box of kleenex. I can't help but notice that Costner outgrew this type of overacting in later efforts. Still, this cri-de-coeur struck me on reflection as possibly being as much of an opportunity to rant for the pretentiously iconoclastic Oliver Stone as it was Garrison's words. Elsewhere in the story, I found myself wondering at the way Garrison \\"took his job home with him\\" by constantly ruminating out loud about the case around his family, or was it just another use of the hackneyed movie cliche about the resentment of cop/ doctor/ whatever spouses at their spouses' tendency to be consumed or endangered by the job. I guess this film had to be this long to tell the story, but it also serves to remind us of who Michael Moore's \\"daddy\\" was.
0446530573|5.0|This book brought back so many memories of living in  Newark, New Jersey as a youngster and learning from my mother and grandmother how to cook.  I am now sharing this with my son and grandchildren who have expressed a desire to learn to cook the way Grandma does.   The stories are great and it was a pleasure to see Artie call \\"spaghetti sauce\\"  by the name I still use, which is \\"red gravy\\".     Recipes are easy, from the province in Italy my people came from, and totally enjoyable.  But most of all, they are authentic!!    And the stories.......again, full of memories of Newark, New Jersey.    I have even ordered extras to give out to friends.    You don't have to be Italian to cook like one.  (I am).  This book makes it easy, informative and delightful.

1400079276|4.0|May contain SPOILERS    Murakami is a daring writer. Not only because, in his novel, a 15-year-old has sex with a fifty-year old woman, that is almost certainly his mother, or because a character, dressed as Johnnie Waker, slices cats open and eats their hearts, it's not because of the explicit sex or the talking cats and raining fish, it's because he never explains his novel, leaving more loose ends than you can possibly imagine, he never attempts to put some sense in his dreamy, trippy world, leaving a lot to be guessed. Not that I was frustrated by it, in fact, I think that it couldn't have ended in any other way, if more was answered the whole dreamy aspect of the novel would have gone down the drain, which would pretty much ruin the whole thing.  The story is amazingly interesting,specially because of it's weirdness, the only major problem is that the characters felt a little unrealistic, maybe it's because of all the absurdities that happened to them and around them or maybe is the way they talk, the dialogue, altought I did enjoy the small pieces of philosophy in it, gets a little stilted at times.
0618918248|5.0|The Editorial Review on Amazon.com betrays a hostility towards non-religious thought. The intolerance that Dawkins rejects is the type that lies at the heart of almost all religions, which rejects a scientific study of our universe, because religion by definition must rely on faith. Faith means believing without evidence, even rejecting those that would prove the opposite. The scientific approach relies on a willingness to test empirically every theory, and to revise or reject such theories should results disagree with predictions. That is scientific integrity.    As thinkers such as Richard Dawkings and Sam Harris have pointed out, if you really believe in God according to the Bible or Koran, you would've had no fear of dying. It would be glorious and wonderful, like Billy Graham said. And that's what the 9/11 hijackers believed. They're not crazy, or \\"terrorists.\\" They're simply doing God's will.    That is intolerance.

0786715103|5.0|I did quite a bit of research on Rwanda in 2006 and 2007.  This excellent book was by far the best, most accurate source of all the materials I used.  I then spent time in Kigali in the summer of 2007, doing extensive interviews with many Rwandan.  Unhesitatingly, Dallaire is loved in Rwanda.  Those who know of his book regard it as objective and authoritative.  I have purchased and given away probably a dozen of this book.  It is a MUST READ for all who are seeking an objective report of what transpired in Rwanda in 1993-1994.    Professor Bill
B00005JKG9|5.0|In my years of watching all genres of movies, none has ever struck me like this one.  It's the most intense and thrilling flick that doesn't involve a moment's violence.  The cast is perfect: Al Pacino as the confident, slick Ricky Roma; Jack Lemmon as the down-on-his-luck Shelley \\"The Machine\\" Levene; Ed Harris as the hot-headed yet shrewd Dave Moss; Alan Arkin as the ever-insecure George Aronow; Kevin Spacey as Mitch & Murray's \\"Company Man\\" Jon Williamson; and Alec Baldwin as Mr. Limpkin, the perfect symbol of upper-management arrogance and cruelty.  Never has a movie gone so far with basically just a half-dozen people on screen at any one time. (A then unknown Jonathan Pryce has a supporting role as James Link, one of Roma's clients/victims, but he's vastly overshadowed in this movie.)    The storyline is one of an ever-frustrating vicious circle: real estate salesmen in a struggling economy are trying to get on a hot streak again. Middle management of Mitch & Murray is no help, only promising that \\"new leads\\" will be introduced.  In walks Limpkin, there to supposedly give them a pep talk. Instead it's an insult-fest: Shelley goes over to get a cup of coffee and is immedeately chastised: \\"Coffee is for closers only!\\" Limpkin further attacks Levene, snidely remarking, \\"You call yourself a salesman, you son of a b****?\\"  One after another, these salesmen are ripped apart as being weak and incompetent.  The company sales competition is then reviewed....first prize, a Cadillac El Dorado; second prize, a set of steak knives; third prize? You're fired! Then, just as quickly as the new Glengarry leads are introduced, Limpkin reveals that they're not for \\"losers\\" like them: \\"To give them to you would be like throwing them away. They're for closers.\\" Baldwin's performance is brilliant here. His combination of intensity and cool cockiness has the effect of a boxer's punch: brief but stinging. And it helps set the tone for the movie's story of how the other salesmen reactto his not-so-pleasant visit.     Meanwhile, the one salesman on a hot streak, Ricky Roma, shows why as he casually talks a random man from the local restaurant (Pryce) about life, loves, and, eventually real estate.  His approach to closing is more suddle: get to know the person, buy them plenty to drink, pretend to care and empathize with them, all the while sizing them up for the deal.  At the same time, Moss concocts a plan to break into Mitch & Murray's and steal the new leads...with the help of a co-conspirator.  Dave needs a second person to do the dirty work, since he's been so vocal in his criticsm of M & M's handling of sales, so he works George over mentally to go along and illegally swipe the leads and sell them to a rival real estate agency.  Shelley, after failing to convince Williamson to loan him a couple of new leads, is out trying to close the old-fashioned way: going door-to-door.  In one scene, probably the most uncomfortable in the whole film, Levene does his best to smooth-talk a young husband to buy land, using all sorts of jargon to make the deal look and sound sweet, when both he and the young man know that no deal will be made. In a moment, it crystalizes what hard-luck the salesmen (except Roma) are going through.    The next morning, the robbery of the leads has indeed taken place, and personal situations change: the files for Roma's previous closings are also missing, along with every phone in the office. Each salesman is being interrogated by police, to seemingly no avail of finding answers. Shelley then enters, excited over a sale he's finally made. The experience is almost like a conquest: he's more confident,cheerful, and, like Roma, bust Williamson's butt for his lack of sales experience, among other things.  From here I won't give much more away: through a series of events, each salesman gains and loses something. All I'll say is that George probably ended up with the steak knives!    I know I went into long detail, but I love thismovie!! Writer/Screenplay David Mamet obviously worked in this field at one point; there is much attention to detail, between the sales-improving corporate-speak of \\"A.B.C.\\" and \\"A.I.D.A\\", to the indignant sign above Williamson's office which reads \\"SALESMEN ARE BORN NOT MADE\\", I'm willing to bet that this story had to come from some real-life experience.  I also thought the movie was actually enhanced by the exclusion of two things: scenes of the robbery itself, and when Shelley \\"closes\\" the deal with the Nyhborgs (I probably spelled that wrong, but so what?) This is a movie that is relevant in any era or any business; it shows the downfall of what was once considered an eternally existent profession.  Substitute \\"real estate\\" with \\"car\\" or \\"insurance\\" salesmen and it would still have the same effect.  Funny, brutal, with a twist of irony at the end, this is a movie I could watch every day and never be sick of.
B00013M6NK|1.0|This was clearly advertised as a \\"Nikon\\" battery but when it came it was a cheap generic substitute.
B000YA9R3C|4.0|Daniel Day-Lewis gives a performance of startling specificity, energy & intensity in his portrayal of oilman Daniel Plainview.  From the first moments we meet him, working as \\"miner\\" all by himself in a deep hole in New Mexico in 1898, we know this man is driven to bring wealth out of the depths of the earth.  From those early, lonely days digging for silver ore, to his early days prospecting for oil...he is a force of nature himself.  He doesn't seem interested in wealth, per se...but in the successful fulfillment of an almost uncontrollable desire to make his mark in his chosen profession.  Even when success would allow him to hire others, he still eagerly gets into the much of a new dig himself.  He MUST do what he can to personally wring from the hard earth the hidden treasures it is hiding from him.  It's almost a personal battle against the earth (and any competitors).    Eventually, we hear and see Plainview selling poor farmers on the idea of him allowing them to drill on their land, and we begin to suspect that not only will he do anything he physically can to achieve his goals...but he may be happy to deceive anyone he needs to.  He talks a good game, and he seems to back it up with results...but he's too driven to keep the promises he's made.    Plainview ends up in California's desert, where he is convinced he's about to strike it big.  He also meet s up with dough-faced Eli Sunday (Paul Dano)...a charismatic healer & preacher whom Plainview must cajole into allowing him to drill on and near his land.  We see that Plainview has a deep dislike for religion (a feeling that is never explained) and that he has no intention of fulfilling his promises to Eli.    This is just the 45 minutes or so of the film...because it is of epic scope and length.  And Day-Lewis is in almost every scene.  Here is an actor of such power and commitment that he literally rivets our attention at all times we see him.  In fact, if director Paul Thomas Anderson really wants us to pay attention to other characters, he must focus his camera directly on that other actor and not include Day-Lewis in the shot.  It's an old-fashioned performance in many ways because there is nothing subtle or down-played.  Day-Lewis knows how to make larger-than-life work better than any actor working today.  He's capable of playing a more modest man quite well (see THE CRUCIBLE or THE BALLAD OF JACK AND ROSE)...but here he's set free to scorch every frame he's in.  It makes his performance as Bill The Butcher in GANGS OF NEW YORK seem positively underplayed.  Yet he never teeters into camp or scenery chewing.  His Plainview is a many driven by demons we can only mostly guess at...but it's clear that Day-Lewis has decided exactly what those demons are and he goes full tilt.    The only thing that seems to matter in Plainview's life is his \\"son\\" HW...who is actually the orphan of a former worker whom Plainview has been raising since infancy.  We think that Plainview may be exploiting the boy...but for most of the film, we see that the only love Plainview has to give is towards this child, and we do not doubt that they actually have a loving relationship...certainly he is a better father than most men in 1910 would have been.    But one day, HW is injured and Plainview is unable to cope with the consequences of the injury.  He blames the young boy on some level, but he clearly blames the minister who says the blame is all Plainview's because he did not let Reverend Sunday bless the new well.  Thus begins a lifelong animosity between the two...and Plainview's somewhat inexplicable descent into madness.    The film is fascinating.  Aside from Day-Lewis, Paul Dano also gives an excellent performance as the pious reverend who may NOT be quite as saintly as he appears.  The scenery is beautiful and the specificity of the work of running an early oil field is wonderfully presented.  It feels wholly authentic.      Yet with all that brilliant work on display, I could not latch onto this film.  Not for one minute is it boring or less than fascinating.  Yet, with its abrupt final act and even more abrupt ending...I was left wondering what the heck all that hard work by Paul Thomas Anderson (the writer director of this...as well as BOOGIE NIGHTS and MAGNOLIA) and Daniel Day-Lewis was for.   As a story, it lacked a logical conclusion to its arc.  When the climactic confrontation comes...we are barely aware it is upon us until it's over.  And after spending all that time with Plainview...we just crave something more...a conclusion to the STORY.  So I was left with the conclusion that truly what Plainview was is a representation of capitalism.  A mad and maddening symbol of everything WRONG with business and greed.  And Eli Sunday is merely a symbol of the weakness and hypocrisy of religion.  So Anderson is condemning both the capitalism that has made this country great AND the religion that has given us much of our core values.  And HW may be the symbol for family...and if so, that goes quite sour as well.    So, I either spent 2 and a half hours watching an interesting story and character study that ends with a whimper...or 2 and a half hours watching a fascinatingly detailed screed against capitalism and religion.  Either way, I was tremendously disappointed...and frankly a little angry or perplexed at Anderson.  Even now, after a day to reflect on my experience of seeing THERE WILL BE BLOOD, I can't quite wrap my mind around any conclusion.    And before you accuse me of simply hating open ended, non-conclusive movies...I had no problems with NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN or EASTERN PROMISES...both brilliant films that didn't wrap things up in a tidy package.  I could ascribe meaning to those films, and I felt the stories were told to a point where I didn't mind walking away from them.  I wanted to yell at THERE WILL BE BLOOD...to demand of it \\"There Will Be a Meaning!!!\\"  But I'm afraid I missed it...and I'll be a lot of others will too.    Clearly the film has drawn huge praise from critics.  And there is MUCH to praise...don't get me wrong.  Seeing Daniel Day-Lewis at his very best is an experience not to be missed.  But I suspect that many of those same critics would be hard pressed to say, \\"This film meant...\\"  I think everyone should see it...but I also doubt it will remain a classic.     --Visit my site [...] for more reviews

B0006GAO5Y|5.0|perpetually-rewatchable with such a fantastic message: the underdog with a heart of gold, who sees the good in everything (even in a frigid, garbage-strewn Philadelphia), finally going the distance, but being content with just having lasted through the battle with the ultimate opponent.  Man, I love this film.  Everything about it, from the filthiness of Rocky's Philadelphia, to the creepy characters Rocky interacts with (all strangely devoid of strong profanity -- anyone notice that?) to the touching romance between Rocky and Adrianne.<br />A great and timeless story, and very inspiring.

B000UJ48V8|1.0|I can't say enough about one of my all time favorite movies, this with Apocalypse Now are the top 2 Vietnam movies for sure.  I love Kubrick and I love this movie, needless to say I was very disappointed in this DVD translation. I have to say this HD DVD was an extreme letdown for me.  This was the first HD DVD I bought, so I was ready to take the player back when I watched it the first time.   I even applied a patch to my player and watched it again but that didn't help either.  The graininess was almost unbearable for me, very disappointing.  Some standard DVDs look as good or better in my opinion.  If this is as good as it gets on HD DVD, I see why Blu-ray will win for sure.  A decent HD cable channel blows it away for richness of color and definition.  Don't waste your money on this and don't invest in a lot of HD DVDs, Stanley Kubrick must be doing somersaults in his grave!

It's a little slow paced initially, but as the plot evolves, you cant help but read on..... It also proves that Khalid Hosseini is a remarkable writer...he is surely one of the best writers of our times..
B000K15VSA|5.0|Lots of info. Great stuff. Facinating! Highly recommend. The amount of detail that went into making this movie is mind-blowing! Its become my favorite movie now knowing what I know.
B000000WFZ|5.0|This soundtrack has a profound soundtrack.  It has become a classic and has a cult-like following among intellectuals.  Oboeist enjoy the one track with a unique oboe lead and solo.
B00005JLT5|5.0|The Pianist by Adrien Brody, Frank Finlay, Thomas Kretschmann, Maureen Lipman<br /><br />Great War story turned cinema depiction.  A welcomed addition to my History films.  I also recommend: Schedulers' List and Enemy at the Gate.  The movie is a 8 of 10.<br /><br />Los Angeles, Ca.
0142410314|5.0|A classic children's book and rightly so.  Roald Dahl is one of the great authors for children, which is obvious since his books are still fun, funny, and interesting for adults.  The story is simple and sweet (that is not suppose to be a pun).  The writing never talks down to children without being above their heads.  You need to get this or any Roald Dahl book for any child you really care about (if they have a sense of humor or need to learn what it is to have one) or if you missed this classic as a child don't wait any longer and read it.
B000ICM5VW|5.0|King Kong [HD DVD]<br /><br />This movie was a hit in theaters and when viewed on a comparable Home Theater system with THX 7.1 and a Plasma HDTV; all I can say is Wow !  If this is where HD content is heading, then count me in.  I rate the movie a 8 out of 10.<br /><br />Los Angeles, Ca.
B00020HEG6|3.0|Title says most of what I intend to.  I like the cd, but the Goblet of Fire is much better, except for the three end songs on that one... more on that later.  Some parts sound just plain discordant to me, which is painful, when the rest is so beautiful.
B00012QM9K|5.0|Schindler's List - Collector's Widescreen Gift Set<br /><br />A touching film of the horrific genocide during WWII.  I have visited the real \\"War Camps\\" in Germany and Poland, very moving to say the least.  I recommend it for all to see. The movie is a 9 of 10 to me.  I also recommend Ann Frank, Enemy at the Gate, The Killing Fields  and ( Hitler's' Book) Mine Comph.  (my fight).<br /><br />Los Angeles, Ca.
B000W07EKW|5.0|I bought the Jason Bourne DVD collection and save over $20. The product was sold out in stores and I tried bidding on it via Ebay but bids went way to high. On Amazon they were also around $70 but on one day a seller had it for $35 and factory sealed. This was a great buy at a great saving. Too bad for the suckers that got it on EBAY.
1400079179|4.0|I will admit, I bought & read this book only because of all of the hoopla about it.  I'm mystified by the hoopla, but found the book an interesting afternoon with a historical novel.  So what if they take some \\"artistic license\\" with facts...its a NOVEL, not a reference book!  As a novel, it kept me interested.
B000K15VSA|5.0|This was a gift for my son for Christmas, and he loved it. It is one of his favorite movies, and all the extra stuff, made it more special.
B000LAZDQA|2.0|The message of the film or director might be indeed sent to the audiences, but I questioned if it could have been sent in a much less open way. Sometimes Less is More!
B0002CHIJW|2.0|I just didn't like this movie. I like Camille Keaton's performance, as well as the performance by Eron Tabor. With the exception of Johnny, the bad guys are insanely stupid and cruel. The movie made me angry and I was certainly happy when Jenny gets her revenge, I just wish she had tortured them a little longer. I'm glad I finally saw this so I can cross it off my list. I don't think I ever need to see it again.
B000VWYJ86|4.0|Ever watch a sequel & wonder what happened between the movies because people are different or events are untold? This one leaves no questions as it seamlessly moves into the new saga. Same suspense & anticipation as the first 2. Bourne is pursued again, or is he pursuing? You decide as you watch the tangle of events unfold and unexpected allies surface. Enjoy!
B000P6YNSE|1.0|after watching a marathon, disc 7 had some skipping... i got it new, but i don't why it had some problems.  It can't be my dvd player coz it's barely used... therefore, the show is great but the product was bad. I want to return it but i don't want to go through all the hassle.
B0009ML238|5.0|I bought Isolate and then it made me buy this, their first one. I was blown by the musicianship in both albums (yes, I did use the word \\"albums\\" - any questions?). These guys are A_M_A_Z_I_N_G! I haven't heard a band like this in years. To those into Prog Rock I highly recommend this and also if you can get your hands on any of Pagan's Mind albums, do so. You WON'T be dissapointed.

1594489505|5.0|This story is amazing!  I have read \\"The Kite Runner\\" and loved it but I could not put \\"A Thousand Splendid Suns\\" down from the very first page.  The story is not only great but you also get a history lesson sprinkled thoughout.  A riveting tale of friendship and sisterhood that forms between two women.  You will not be disappointed!
B000VBJEEG|1.0|We saw this in the movie theater and even gave it one more chance on DVD but this movie is BOOORING!  Sure the film is beautiful to look at but it has none of the Disney/Pixar magic that all the previous films had.  No lovable and funny characters at all.  A very lame script and horrible actors to play the voices.  It just didn't have all the emotions and learning experiences that all the other Pixar movies had.  There is no way people would want to watch this over and over.  It made no sense and no one in our family was ever on the edge of their seat, nor laughing nor cared how it was going to turn out in the end.  Disney can not market anything for this movie either which surprised me that they even considered it.  No toys, no clothes, no characters at Disney, no future rides.  It just had no imagination and leaves the kids nothing to talk about after.  The only reason I would give it no stars is that the computerization looks good.  Otherwise 2 adults, a 6 and 9yr old give it two thumbs WAY down.
B000FSME1A|3.0|This is my favorite movie of all time, so my rating certainly doesn't reflect on the quality of the movie at all, rather the DVD design.  This is a two disc set and instead of putting the original on one DVD and the Redux on the other DVD they put the first half of both versions on disc 1 and the second half on disc 2.  I think this ruins the flow of the movie because you have to get up and load the other dvd halfway through the movie.  LAME!
B000P6YNSE|3.0|Talk about a dragged out TV Series. I don't think it would keep me glued to my seat if I had to watch it weekly. I 've been watching it by renting it from the library. I was kinda getting disgusted thinking that is this all it is (meaning the 3rd season). When I saw there is going to be a fourth season. So that means it'll will be awhile until I see the entire show. I just hope the members of the airplane get better housing this season. Being on the beach with that flimsy tarp and bush construction just won't do.
B000BJS4SU|4.0|I knew next to nothing about John Mayer until I caught a PBS special one night and was blown away with his guitar playing. It was reminiscent of the great rock guitarist and certainly refreshing of a relatively new talent. So I went out and read reviews of all his CD's and decided on \\"Now\\".   I was not disappointed. His guitar playing at times reminds me of Stevie Ray Vaughan. And his bass player and drummer are certainly top-notch. I highly recommend this CD for any serious music lover.
B000UD0ESA|5.0|Fans of this ahead-of-its-time dystopian sci-fi movie will appreciate the disappearing of the voice over narration and will enjoy learning about the pre- cgi special effects.  This is a must have, even if you already own the director's cut.
B000YENUI6|5.0|Viggo Mortensen is now among the top two or three actors in Hollywood.  Both an intellectual and an exceptional physical actor, he is an utter pleasure to watch, even when many of the scenes in Eastern Promises are spurting blood in all directions.  The violence coexists with a sense of almost minimalist control and precision--in Mortensen's and Watts's acting and in Cronenberg's direction.  In some ways this is a small film, but it packs a huge punch.  It is circumscribed without being claustrophobic and the use of language--English, Russian, Ukrainian, et al. adds texture without being distracting.  This is superb work.  I loved A History of Violence and I consider Eastern Promises its equal.  The films are similar in concept, though very different in setting and context.  This is adult filmmaking in which the sex, violence and nudity are appropriate to the story and--though very explicit--are muted by the powerful story and engaging characters.  Don't miss this one.
B000XUOIQ4|4.0|This is my almost 4 year-old son's favorite Disney movie at the moment.  He even picked out a small stuffed cat and named her Duchess!  I love it for the jazz.  The music in this movie is right there with the Jungle Book, which makes it fun for adults as well as children.  Classic Disney animation, with a little extra sparkle.  Eva Gabor as Duchess was genius casting.
B00005JPXY|4.0|I don't understand the movie-going public anymore.  Every time I see a movie I go into it open-minded and willing to go along for the director's ride.  And in this case, \\"Cloverfield\\" is literally a ride.  It seems like it'd fit right in with any 3-D or interactive theme park ride, like Universal Studios' \\"B2tF Ride\\" and \\"T2 the Ride.\\"  Why did the a-holes behind me need everything to be explained?  This film is basically a civilian's account of a Godzila-esque attack and it works on that level.  It doesn't explain why the military was able to mobilize so quickly, why the creature exists, why it attacks NYC.  What we care about is Rob, Lily, Hud, Beth, Rob's brother, and Marlena.  This is a human survival movie not unlike \\"Body Snatchers.\\"<br /><br />Terrible dialogue?  The only thing I found unrealistic about the dialogue was the fact that no one cursed, which I guarantee I'd be doing if poop hit the fan like it did in the movie.  And as far as Hud's inappropriate interjections of humor, I bought it.  As a storytelling device, this movie with no humor would not have been as enjoyable as it ended up being.  Those awkward moments of laughter work for the audience to break the tension.  As a character, Hud says stupid things just to break the tension a little bit so he can feel a sense of normalcy in this ludicrous situation he's in.<br />Of COURSE of you don't get sucked into a movie you're going to find flaws in it.  The camera is shaky because that's how it would really be handled in that situation!  The dialogue is bad because this is supposed to reflect real life, not a movie.  This movie preys on our 9/11 memories becase it's what would happen to us even if it were really happening.  We'd all be going \\"Jesus God, not again.\\"  Those who hate this movie because the destruction is too real looking and is based on the 9/11 destruction, what did you expect from a movie about a giant monster attacking New York City?<br /><br />A lot of words and a lot of hate for the ciritcs aside, I dug this movie a lot and it is truly a heart-pounding experience I haven't had since I rode my last roller coaster.  If a movie ever needed a seat belt, this one is it.ciritcs aside, I dug this movie a lot and it is truly a heart-pounding experience I haven't had since I rode my last roller coaster.

1932907009|5.0|great book. informative, well written, actually gives you what you want when looking for HELP. a lot of screenwriting books just recycle the same old war stories. this gives you ideas and ways to work thru. good work.
B000WC3A0S|5.0|I received the movies in good condition and quickly despite being a last minute purchase during the holidays.
B000YXMMAE|2.0|I was pretty dissapointed by this one.  It seemed sort of half baked.  If I understood correctly, this was a bunch of songs recorded that might have just as well ended up as a bunch of odds and sods.  It pales horribly next to their other albums.
B000UCEJEQ|4.0|I'm an Annie Lennox fan but when this album first was released I listened to the 20 second samples and only found \\"Dark Road\\" worth downloading.  Then recently I found the album at my local library and listened to the entire album.  I like every song on the album and went out and purchased it.  I just didn't get the \\"sound\\" of each song from the samples.  So find a record store or borrow a copy from someone who has it and listen to the entire songs rather than the samples in making your decision whether to buy this one.
B000S5BUXI|4.0|This is an excellent record from the Cincy band.  The echoed voice of lead singer, Matt Berninger lingers in your head long after the songs are over.  I highly recommend this CD.
B000TGJ8CQ|3.0|I enjoyed the movie for the most part but it would have been nice had they explored the possibilities more.  Also some parts of the movie made no sense to me, one part in particular the character of jessica biel is told to place a knockout pill into his drink but wait 2 mins before doing so presumably because that is as far ahead as he can see, fair enough but can't he see ahead of time at any given time so even had she waited 2 mins, within that time he would have already seen ahead and saw her placing the pill.  Story was all over the place and rather short.

B000ICL3KG|5.0|When you think of watching an entertaining movie I'm sure, like most people, you think of plugging in an hour-and-a-half video with Al Gore. And what could add to the entertainment but knowing it's him giving a lecture on global warming? OK, maybe not. But this is not only a fact-based, hyperbole-free education of the crisis which has already arrived and only getting worse, it really is entertaining too. While one wishes the crisis would end, you also wish the movie wouldn't.  It is true that some propogandists may dislike the facts and try to use false logic to dispute global warming (and Al Gore and this movie and evolution and smoking is bad for your health and the world is round and and and...) former-Vice President Gore makes it clear that the facts are in and the crisis is indisputable. I suggest after watching the movie sending it to one of those people who claim there is no global warming because \\"it's the middle of January and here in the Northeast it's 20 degrees today\\" or the people who use claims (not facts) put out by major petroleum-industry companies and ask them to argue the facts of the movie. Not to use circular logic or any other tactic but to try and dispute the facts.  Or, you can just watch it and be entertained while educated.
B00005JPTI|3.0|Strictly looking at the later films (not Matheson's book or \\"The Last Man on Earth\\"), \\"I am Legend\\" although, full of suspense, does not seem to have the \\"flow\\" and \\"cool\\" of the \\"Omega Man\\" (Charlton Heston as Robert Neville). Not even Will Smith's acting can mask the CGI flaws (zombies and the bird's eyeview shot of the red Mustang driving around NY look fake). They should have stuck with orginal director choice Ridley Scott. I am sure Ridley Scott would have made sure that the graphics looked realistic. Nevertheless, it had its moments.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|\\"Planet Earth\\" has become my favorite thing to watch. I loved it when it was on TV, and was thrilled to get the DVDs with the bonus material. The shows were great for my family: we loved to watch them together, squished on the couch with popcorn as if we were watching the best movie ever.
B000MRAAJM|5.0|This product allows you to view the world in a way that cannot be done any other way.  The cinematography is fantastic, letting you see things as if you were there yourself.  Very well done for entertainment and educational purposes.
B00005JSGK|5.0|This is one of my all-time favorite movies.  It has adventure, comedy, romance...and Henry Mancini's music.  What's not to like?
B000A0GP4K|5.0|I am  not a Bob Dylan fan but this dvd is so interesting and insightful that you can't help but be a fan after watching it and to then share it with others.  It is also just a nice movie to play to hear the music of not only his but other passionate musicians.
B000002OZY|5.0|In the movie 'almost famous', when his sister leaves home she instructs him that if lights a candle, stares into it, while listening to tommy, he will see his future. the moment i first heard the into with Moon's incredible, effortless drumming, i was hooked. I downloaded the album and its utterly hypnotic. It is a classic oratorio, telling and weaving a complete story of the hero's journey, like 'handel's messiah'.
B000050HTO|5.0|If you want some really good Dylan music, NO!!~don't get the Greatest Hits!! Get this one!! Excellent 2-disc CD, audio is top quality, nice booklet, not the cheap 1-pg insert.

Glad I got'em!!!<br /><br />Thanks Amazon.com, again, received quickly!! God Bless!!

B000PMGS8G|5.0|I grew up seeing this movie on tv all the time, like over ten years ago and loved it. Nice packaging with this dvd by the way- This movie is Classic fun and the music is rocking great.  They don't make them quite like this anymore for good reasons but it is the best of it's kind.
B00005JPXY|3.0|Cloverfield brought a neat perspective on a monster flick, in more ways than one. The hand held camera work was pretty hard to watch at first. Mainly, the first character using the camera was just really bad at it and shot a lot of random things like feet. Much like you would expect to see from some of your friends videos ;) All of the bad camera was intentional. It does get better but still maintains the very hand held sensation. One of my friend's wife really didn't like the cameras throughout the movie. However, the cinematography didn't bother me much, must be from all my years playing first person shooters.<br /><br />It is impressive that this film was made on a budget slightly more than $30 million (which in all reality it is sad that $30 million is considered a small movie budget these days). The effects were surprisingly well done and the monster is not as illusive as you would imagine from a lower budget film. The film manages to show it throughout the movie (at least once it is revealed). The monster did have one unique trait that came as a surprise to me. I'm not going to say what it is in order to avoid spoiling anything for you.<br /><br />As far as the story goes, the movie doesn't provide as much closure or details about the incident as I would like. My guess is that they'll do something special when the film is released on DVD to address this. On the other hand, the lack of closure did make for a more interesting conclusion and it was nice to see a deviation from the typical American movie ending. Cloverfield is a relatively short movie but does provide decent character introductions and a plot.<br /><br />They movie does manage to bring some humor to an otherwise non-humorous story through one of the camera guys. This humor is done well enough not to detract from what's going on because it fits right in with one of the character's mentality.<br /><br />It is hard for me to say whether or not I liked the movie. I didn't really have an expectations going in- mainly due to the secrecy of the story and my avoidance of reading any potential spoilers. I do believe I liked the movie but its not a must see or a movie that I would buy. At the same time, I wouldn't tell anyone to avoid watching it if they were intrigued by the previews. So my recommendation is go see if it you think you are interested so you know for your self what all the hype is about. You may just really like it.cy of the story and my avoidance of reading any potential spoilers. I do believe I liked the movie but its not a must see or a movie that I would buy.

B000K15VSA|5.0|As a huge fan of this film I have to say this 'Ultimate Collection' is exactly that. With this set, real fans at last have all versions of the movie along with some great outtakes and deleted scenes (disc four) that have never been widely available until now. The documentary 'Dangerous Days' (disc two) will immerse you in the epic saga that was the making of Blade Runner and covers every aspect in great detail. It is also nice to have the original theatrical cut with the voice over (which I always liked) in addition to the '92 Directors cut and Ridley Scott's Final Cut. The Final Cut itself is at once immense and stunningly beautiful in picture and sound, and it's great that we finally have Scott's definitive vision of this landmark film. Also of interest will be the Workprint on disc five - a 'rough sketch' of the film, you might say, that also has not been widely seen. The commentaries are interesting and enlightening and you can see this was a labor of love for all involved. In all, we have all five versions of Blade Runner with a great collection of extras and the Collectors Edition is a real treat for true aficionados of this fine film. Highly Recommended.
B000Y7ZHCU|5.0|I was able to see Celine's show last September in Las Vegas.  This DVD was well shot and gives you the feeling of being there.  The special features (which I have not finished viewing yet) are interesting, but the gold of the collection is the actual performance.    All of her major hits are represented here as well as covers of Stevie Wonder amd Heart, and a duet with Frank Sinatra.    If you did not get to go to Las Vegas and wanted to, buy this DVD.  If you went to Las Vegas and wanted to go back, buy this DVD.  Give your friends and family a treat and buy them this DVD.
B000TGCR38|5.0|I have recommended this movie, and lent it out to more people than any other movie I own.<br /><br />Carice Van Houten gives a compelling performance in one of the best ever female lead roles, reminding me of Scarlett O Hara in Gone With the Wind.  What this character goes though in this movie kept me gripped to my seat throughout.  The stakes are so high, and the crap she has to put up with, smirk!<br /><br />My hope is that we will see her starring in many more movies, and my regards to her boyfriend, Luke E Bastaard.<br /><br />Seriously, though this movie has action, drama, heartstopping moments, heartbreaking moments, and even tender moments.
1570627215|5.0|This 1922 novella is often mistaken for a biography of the Buddha.  The story is set in India in the Buddha's time, the central character shares the Buddha's birth name, and in the end a similar experience of awakening.  Hesse's Siddhartha, though, follows a slightly different path.<br /><br />Both begin princes who renounce their inheritance for the life of a wandering ascetic.  Both go on to practice yogic austerities to create altered states of consciousness, states that because of their temporary nature prove ultimately unsatisfying.  At this point, the historical Siddhartha left his teachers and developed his own way to enlightenment.  Hesse's Siddhartha, though, decides to learn something about the sensual world and begins by courting the lovely Kamala, who may be based on Ambapali, a courtesan from Buddhist scriptures who donates a park to the Buddha's monks.  In Hesse's novel, Kamala leads Siddhartha into the world of sex, love, commerce, drink, and gambling, where he stays for many years until at last he begins to sicken of this life, experiencing a crisis that brings him close to death - and sets him back on the road to enlightenment.<br /><br />In the end Siddhartha realizes that while his decision to go out seeking himself was unavoidable, so too was his suffering.  That the life he lived could not have been any different, that his path to enlightenment required he live exactly the life he had lived - good, bad, and wretched.  As he tells his friend Govinda many years later:<br /><br />\\"I learned through my body and soul that it was necessary for me to sin, that I needed lust, that I had to strive for property and experience nausea and the depths of despair in order to learn not to resist them, in order to learn to love the world, and no longer compare it with some kind of desired imaginary world, some imaginary vision of perfection, but to leave it as it is, to love it and be glad to belong to it.\\"<br /><br />The old Siddhartha settles next to a river, becoming a ferryman, the metaphorical Buddha carrying people from one side of life to the other.  In his journeys back and forth listening to the river he realizes at last what he was searching for all these many years.<br /><br />\\"Within Siddhartha there slowly grew and ripened the knowledge of what wisdom really was and the goal of his long seeking.  It was nothing but a preparation of the soul, a capacity, a secret art of thinking, feeling, and breathing thoughts of unity at every moment of life.\\"<br /><br />I read this book nearly 30 years ago when I was 17.  I can't remember what I thought about it then or what I might have got out of it.  Now I wonder how someone just starting out on his journey could appreciate Hesse's insight.  Perhaps, though, there was then some inkling of its importance.  Perhaps that's why I remembered it fondly, which is perhaps what influenced me to pick it up again last month.  And for that I am thankful to my younger self, the one who had to travel much the same road as Hermann Hesse's Siddhartha.<br /><br />#etaphorical Buddha carrying people from one side of life to the other.

B000GPI2EK|4.0|this album is just a great metal album. dont look much into it. mastodon did not sell out they are just moving along with change and this album has every element that a great album needs. bands dont become bands to play for the same 500 people all the time and this might be softer than their earlier stuff but just remember that softer can be better. buy this album and have an open mind if you listened to their older stuff before.
B000Z0OX9O|5.0|Every Blade Runner fan should have this - disc one has the original soundtrack from 1994, disc two has music from the movie not included in the '94 release, and some really great tracks, but it's disc three that is the real treat: All new music composed by Vangelis for the 25th anniversary of BR, and there are some gems here, a lot of it reminiscent of Vangelis' work from the '80's through the mid '90's (re: Direct, The City, Opera Sauvage, etc.)... As a long time Vangelis fan I am very pleased with this three-disc set and very happy to have it in my collection. Highly recommended.

Besides his autobiographical 1966 movie, Chappaqua, his adaptation of Herman Hesse's Siddhartha was his one and only cinematic achievement. Today he is largely forgotten.  As of this writing he doesn't even have an entry in Wikipedia.<br /><br />But Siddhartha lives on as a literary classic and as a result the film is still sought out by loyal and often fanatical fans of the book.  A quarter century later it is still a visually beautiful film, one that can impress, especially on a large screen, with its panoramic shots.  Brooks knew India and his familiarity with the place shines through in the film.<br /><br />The acting is not bad, but on occasion overdone, such as the boatman's homilies delivered in a patronizingly saccharine voice.  The script is occasionally clunky, lifting bits straight from the book, and in parts the story seems a bit rushed.  The middle section - in which Siddhartha meets Kamala, moves to town, and becomes a local businessman - has the most natural and unhurried flow.  Two decades on the sex scenes are not unsurprisingly tame - and occasionally comical (such as Siddhartha's first orgasm).<br /><br />The biggest problem with the film is that it leaves out what is for me one of the most meaningful observations of Siddhartha's life, that his time as a husband and father, as a property owner and businessman, was not wasted time.  On the contrary, he could not have arrived at enlightenment without having experienced a life of sensual pleasure - and despair.  As Siddhartha tells his friend Govinda many years later:<br /><br />\\"I learned through my body and soul that it was necessary for me to sin, that I needed lust, that I had to strive for property and experience nausea and the depths of despair in order to learn not to resist them, in order to learn to love the world, and no longer compare it with some kind of desired imaginary world, some imaginary vision of perfection, but to leave it as it is, to love it and be glad to belong to it.\\"<br /><br />#world, and no longer compare it with some kind of desired imaginary world, some imaginary vision of perfection, but to leave it as it is, to love it and be glad to belong to it.\\"    #
B0000DIJO2|5.0|If you want the best possible Bee Gee experience, buy this DVD!  I have a fairly new TV, not even stereo.  When I play this DVD, it's like the sound fills the room - incredible sound!!!  Be sure to turn up the volume for the best experience.  The Brothers Gibb are the most talented song writers (over 1,000 songs) in American music.  Some of their songs will make you cry they are so beautiful.  Others will make you want to dance the night away.  I am old enough to remember them in the 60's, 70's and so on. This DVD brought back so many memories - but I appreciate the music 100% more now.  I can't begin to tell you how talented these men are.  Not only their music, but their singing ability is unbelieveable.  I will say it one more time - if you want the TOTAL BEE GEE EXPERIENCE, YOU MUST BUY THIS DVD.

B000NNXEH0|5.0|Kurasawa is a legend.  This movie is why.  If you haven't seen it, then you are missing on of the greatest action movies of all time and the work of a master.
1580176941|5.0|I loved this book.  Normally I skim \\"how-to\\" books. But not this one.  I read it cover to cover, absorbing great information for my cookie business.  Very beautiful pictures and easy to follow directions.  One of my favorites!!
B000UD0ESA|2.0|Yes, there are some added sceens, but they don't make up for the fact that the narations by Harrison Ford have been removed. Save your money. If you have the original versions, stick with them.
0743486285|5.0|I posted this in the comment section of the review by \\"Tyler Durden\\", with the title, \\"Wahhhhhhhhhhhhh! Mommy didn't love me!\\" and then saw a few other reviews with the same type opinion and decided to also post it here.                 A fan of the music maybe, apparently not the people who made it.   I would think having read \\"The Dirt\\", you also would have watched the DVD's, the VH1 specials, etc.. and if you had truly READ this book, with it's brutal honesty not often seen from many famous (or not) people, you would see that Mr. Sixx has \\"gotten over it\\", quite well I might add. Few in the place this man was, can turn it around and live the life he does now. And it has nothing to do with the money and fame he has. The arrogant, selfish person he portrayed and hid behind was never the person he wanted to be. He was able to come to terms with his anger and pain, sort it out and introduce the real Nikki Sixx to the world. We saw the bad and we get to see the good.     With it's diary entries showing Mr. Sixx then, and the observations he adds on them as Mr. Sixx now, you can't NOT notice and be somewhat amazed, of how he pulled himself out of that pure hell to go on and continue to be a very successful musician, businessman, and most important of all, loving, caring Father and friend. In spite of the childhood he had.   Yes, a lot of people have had crappy childhoods, but many, while not becoming \\"junkies\\", sadly have a lifelong struggle to be the type of parent they wish they had. To be affectionate and emotionally open is almost impossible for them, they just don't have or know how to obtain, the tools to do so. Mr. Sixx has learned from his mistakes, and the mistakes done to him and turned them into something positive, something an addict of his caliber rarely accomplishes because they usually don't make it out of that hell alive.  If you knew an addict, or viewed any show/documentaries on them you would know that he crawled out of that hell on his own, something he deserves a standing ovation for with a capitol O.   No matter how many people an addict has to offer help, unless they see and are willing to help themselves, no army of friends, loved ones or doctors can help. As many times as this man should have been dead, (I'm sure there were quite a few more  very close calls than the 2 times he actually was than maybe he/others realized) he knows how lucky he is to be alive, to have the family and friends he does. And wants to share that with those who might be interested.  If this book helps just one addict start the climb out of that hell, I think Mr. Sixx has accomplished what he set out to do with writing it. Kudos to him.
B00026WU9Q|5.0|Dylan's \\"Highway 61 Revisted\\" and \\"Blonde On Blonde\\" are considered by many to be his best albums. But, in some ways, this was his most momentous and important. It is here that Dylan \\"goes electric\\", with the first side of the album made up of blues based rockers and sardonic ballads. The second side is acoustic. But here too Dylan is transfroming, reaching a new level of lyrical and musical artistry.     Prior to Dylan rock and roll was considered by many, incuding some in the counter-culture, to be bubblegum pop music. But Dylan changed all that by combining the depth and substance of his words with the rhythm and energy of rock to create something entirely new and better. American music, and perhaps American culture itself, would never be the same.    This album is chock full of classic songs like \\"Subterranean Homesick Blues\\" and \\"Maggie's Farm\\". \\"Love Minus Zero/No Limit\\" is perhaps my favorite love song of all time, with lines like - \\"My love she laughs like the flowers/Valentines can't buy her.\\" Forget this bling-bling nonsense, that is what real romance is all about!    \\"Mr Tambourine Man\\" and \\"Baby Blue\\" have Dylan experimenting with surrealistic word play and imagery, a type of song writing that would go on to influence the Grateful Dead and many other great rock bands. But \\"It's Alright Ma (I'm Only Bleeding)\\" is perhaps the most glorious of all the songs here. The music providing a powerful underpinning for radical, extradorinary lyrics like \\"If my thought-dreams could be seen/they would probably put my head in a guillotine.\\"     Some called Dylan a \\"sell out\\" for turning from folk to rock. But the truth is that he was actually just taking it to the next level of artistic accomplishment, still willing to challenge mainstream society but now going beyond mere political rhetoric to explore what it means to be human in the heart and soul as well as the mind. Yes, it was Dylan who took music to the next level and we are all the better for it.
078693123X|5.0|There is not much more I can say that hasn't been said. I actually picked the first two re-issue hardcover books up at bookstore going out of business and it sat on the shelf for a long time. This book has actually got me reading on a regular basis again after a long break. The story is engaging enough that I am already trying to decide if I want this whole series in hardcover, which is quite a bit of investment. R.A. Salvatore has the ability to write a story in a way few authors can. If you like Fantasy, and especially Drow, this is the only way to go.
B000SQJ2JG|5.0|\\"You Keep On Moving\\" is worth the price of admission alone.  One of the great songs from the 1970's, and one of Deep Purple's best songs ever.  The rest of the album is also fine.  A great \\"lost' 70's hard rock classic.
B000W1V7K4|4.0|This title is definitely better than the second.  Yet, it is not as good as the first.  On the tech side, the visuals are gorgeous and the sound tries to keep up; as it is not an action movie, per se.  Nevertheless, a worthy Blu-Ray purchase.
B0006OBPTA|5.0|The films are fantastic. I can't remember a time when I was not in love with The Karate Kid, and having all four films available so easily is a dream come true. The sounds quality and picture are excellent, and except for, \\"The Next Karate Kid\\", so were the movies. I can't recommend these movies highly enough. They were by far my favorites growing up, and they still have a place of honor in my list of favorites.
B00005JPXY|5.0|First of all, all of those people complaining about how this movie didn't reveal any answers about the creature, you obviously didn't get the point.  This isn't a standard monster movie.  It's a pseudo-documentary of the chaos.  And not told from the perspective of the military, Department of Defense, emergency personnel, the president, etc.  but from the point of few of just a bunch of regular twenty-something year-olds having a going-away party for the main character, Rob, only to have it become the worst day of their lives.  To use a good analogy, a lot of people have compared the destruction of NYC in this movie to 9/11.  In all of the camera footage that was being filmed by regular people such as tourists right as 9/11 was happening, was there any mention of Osama Bin Laden, Al Queda, trade embargoes and bombings of Iraq, the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, etc.  No, there wasn't.   It was just chaos and terror all around.  The same thing is happening here.       Also don't believe all of those reviews who say that there's nothing likable about the cast.  From the very beginning it's obvious that Rob cares about and even loves Beth.  WARNING SPOILERS AHEAD!  The film even begins with a previously recorded segment of about a month ago where Rob wakes up and eventually wakes Beth up, whom he just slept with.  It's revealed that they're heading out to Coney Island that day as she has never been there before.  Cut to a month later with a new recording been done over the other one.  This one is Rob's brother, Jason, and his girlfriend, Lily, setting up a surprise going-away party for Rob as he's leaving for Japan.  The assign Rob's dunderheaded, yet lovable friend, Hud, with the task of gaining testimonials from people wishing Rob good luck.  Which Hud accepts once he learns that Lily's friend, Marlena, is going to be at the party.  Marlena is a bit of a loner, but it's obvious that Hud likes her, even though she doesn't remember him from the few times that they've met.  It's funny the way that he badly tries to hit on her and get her to say something for the camera. Eventually Beth shows up with her own date in tow, which leaves Rob distraught.  Jason and Hud get Lily to reveal that Rob and Beth, who had been friends since high school, slept together a few weeks ago.   However Rob didn't call Beth again after their day at Coney Island.  Rob says something insulting to Beth's date and he and Beth then get into a fight with her storming back to her own apartment.   Hud and Jason then try to cheer Rob up when suddenly a huge tremor occurs.          WARNING MAJOR SPOILERS AHEAD!!! All the electricity goes out for a few seconds and then when it comes back on, everyone sees the news about an oil tanker having been destroyed.  They go up to the roof and then see an explosion.  They then all go down to street level where they see the head of the Statue of Liberty tossed into their street along with an eventual glimpse of some skyscraper-sized monster.  And then all hell breaks loose.  At first all of them try going across the Brooklyn Bridge with throngs of masses only to have the tail of the mysterious monster destroy the bridge, taking Jason's life.  When the others get together to cope with the horror of Jason's death, Rob says that he needs to go see Beth since she called him saying that she was trapped in her building.  It's obvious therefore that he loves her, which makes the ending all the more tragic.  You care for the friends who follow him out of loyalty even when he tells them that they can follow the Army out of Manhattan.  You really come to care for Rob and Beth since they both love each other.  You also feel sorry for Hud, whom himself is cares for Marlena and tries to cheer her up with jokes after she saves his life, ultimately at the expense of her own, as some bites that she sustains end up doing her in (which is then disturbing to Hud).   Hud was an extra treat for me, as he provided some of the light comic relief that was almost a mirror of one of my friends whom I saw the movie with.  Me and the others were teasing him about it all throughout the film.         As for the monster.   What can you say about the monster?  It definitely wasn't Godzilla (as rumors leading up to the film's release said it was).  Throughout most of the movie you only see short glimpses of its appendages and tail.  It's also revealed that parts of its body fall off and turn into big spider-like creatures which then attack people (they're the ones that do Marlena in).  A few times we see the creatures face and jaws open wide, but only briefly.  It isn't until five minutes to the end when we get what in my opinion is the money shot of the whole ordeal.  Early morning in Central Park after a helicopter crash, Hud finds himself underneath the behemoth looking up, to which the creature looks down at him and you see a perfectly clear view of the monster's ugly mug with Hud shuddering in horror just before it does him in. END ALL SPOILERS!         Ultimately the movie is a great mix of terror, tragedy, and light humor at a few times, and even some romance (but not heavy-handed and cheesy, but rather brief, subtle, and genuine).  It wasn't Godzilla, but it blew away that ridiculous Godzilla movie of a decade ago.  You would feel any empathy for this monster, but will instead feel that it's something that came straight from hell.  The only legitimate reasons that I could think of for not seeing or liking this movie is if you have a bit of a queasy stomach for overly shaky cameras and footage that brings up the memory of 9/11.  Otherwise, YOU HAVE GOT TO SEE THIS MOVIE!!!    P.S.  For those you that might want some answers, near the end when the video show the lovely couple of Rob and Beth at Coney Island a month ago, off in the horizon you can see something falling from the sky into the ocean.  Most likely it's the monster itself.
B000UD0ESA|5.0|Directors don't always have the freedom to make the movie they intend to; sometimes it's budget problems, most of the time it comes down to the studio  trying to protect their investment.  To the minority who liked the \\"original\\" version with the voice-over by Harrison Ford: You are voting for creative decisions made by bankers, aimed at the lowest common denominator. The movie tanked at the box office when it came out; audiences were not sophisticated enough for it until years later. This is the movie Ridley Scott wanted to make, and in my humble opinion, it is a masterpiece.
0805079831|5.0|Reading Ms. Klein's book was an eye-opening, life-changing act for me.  It helped me to see the \\"story behind the story\\" of so many of the things that have been in the news since I became aware of the news.  The book is thoroughly researched, convincingly presented, and well organized.  It was difficult to read, but only because of how painful it was for me to see so many of the truly disgusting things my country has done to people, both here (for example, in New Orleans) and around the world.  I grew up in the 60s, believing that America was the greatest country in the world.  Now I realize, we are not the good guys.  Maybe we were once, but not any more.
B000AYEL6U|5.0|I wasn't sure what the film was about because I bought it to see  Richard Armitage a British actor.  I was not disappointed, the critics have compared this film with Pride and Predjudice and I was thinking the same as I watch it.  Both Daniela Denby-Ashe & Richard Armitage are handsome, talented actors; I hope their careers soar.  Because all the actors are from the UK or Ireland, they have not been exposed to America yet.  They all were suited to their parts and played them very well.
B000HBKCDC|5.0|Sarah did a beautiful job with this collection of Christmas songs. She has a very fresh, sweet voice that makes every song she sings uplifting.
B000V8I2QU|5.0|Springsteen has always had the distinctive ability to capture emotional life with vividness, energy and passion--be it the epic sweep of sagas like \\"Jungleland\\" or the spare and desolute \\"My City of Ruins\\".    What is most outstanding about \\"Magic\\" is the way in which Springsteen stretches as an artist.  The powerful and enduring classics are there: \\"You'll Be Coming Down\\" captures the warmth, energy, power and truth of Springsteen's best work, and the passionate \\"I'll Work For Your Love\\" stands alongside Springsteen's finest.      Listen to the driving, propulsive edge, the arrangement just pushing at the edge of chaos, of \\"Radio Nowhere; the sharper, edgier vocal of \\"Livin' In The Future\\", and the Elvis Costello-via-the-Beach-Boys infused \\"Girls in Their Summer Clothes\\", and you hear the voice of a musician expanding, seeming to grow both in wisdom and, remarkably, in youthful energy and power. \\"Last to Die\\" puts the energy and force of Springsteen's music behind a clear and vivid political declaration about loss of life in the face of misused power, and even the Byrds-like ringing 12-string underneath the gorgeous \\"Coming Down\\" adds a new dimension to Springsteen's music.    Springsteen, ironically like one of the year's other best's, X-Patriate's \\"[[ASIN:B000ZRMCRM Greetings From Lafayette Park]]\\" creates a work of extraordinary emotional strength, power and musical/lyrical range that reaches deeply into both the intellect and the heart. One of the best.
B000K15VSA|5.0|Finally a collector's edition they got right. Nothing more to be said than 5 stars.
0446401307|3.0|I guess everybody's entitled to take a break now and then and it looks like Connelly just decided to take it easy on this book.  It's a good read -- as is everything Connelly writes -- but it lacks the energy that his other books have.  It almost feels like reading a condensed book.  Nothing is quite as good as in his other books -- plot, characters, intensity, suspense. I think the fact that it started out as a serialization weakened it. But, I think everybody should read this book --it still is the work of a master craftsman -- but do so knowing that it aint quite as good as his other works.

B000N3ST7K|4.0|I must admit before purchasing the soundtrack, I tried to hunt down a way to download two or three songs from the C.D., but true to Quentin Tarrantino, you have to take the whole package.  (Even though his tenacity hasn't prevented 'Kill Bill' from being divided into two volumes, and the double feature 'Grindhouse' project has been split in two with 'Death Proof' and 'Planet Terror' respectively.  For me it's a good thing for the latter development that I didn't have to buy the score of 'Planet Terror,' too.)      Anyway, I digress.  We're here to share the merits of the soundtrack, so lets get back on track and not dilly-dally around like in the movie!  The two most coveted tracks cover the movie's two climaxes.  So top honors go to the big and bouncy \\"Hold Tight,\\" with its especially dizzying crescendo.  (Can't you still picture those pretty girls smiling and nodding their heads to the music in my favorite scene before it all turned ugly?)  Then, there's the infectious and delightfully irritating \\"Chick Habit\\" by April March.  (Now who was the agent who thought of that name?)    Don't expect the rest of the C.D. to be as exhiliarating.  Yet, T. Rex's \\"Jeepster\\" and Willie DeVille's rollickin' roadhouse blues number \\"It's So Easy\\" come remarkably close.      Most of the rest consists of good, slow, and obscure blues (including \\"Stagolee,\\" The Coasters' \\"Down in Mexico,\\" and Eddie Floyd's \\"Good Love, Bad Love\\")  It's also nice to have a late sixties version of Burt Bacharach's \\"Baby It's You\\".  As far as instrumentals go, \\"Riot in Thunder Alley\\" is decent, as is the opener \\"The Last Race,\\" which adds tension to the proceedings.  For variety, the ride slows down for a while on the truly beautiful piano instrumental \\"Sally and Jack\\". While not a personal favorite, many understandably revere Joe Tex's \\"The Love You Save (May Be Your Own)\\".      There's a little filler in between, and not all of it mixes well sequentially, but there's some essential stuff here, folks.As with many soundtracks, some tidbits of conversation are thrown in.  This is meant to elicit fond memories of the movie.  While I'm not as sentimental about the film as most people, the selection \\"Whatever-However\\" does demonstrate the most memorable dialogue for me. (Oddly, these are the only places that merit the \\"Parental Advisory\\" label.)    Pulling out rarities, Quentin Tarrantino has provided some living proof by resurrecting some fine music for a solid soundtrack.
0143038419|4.0|This is a VERY good book. I can see the point of view of some of the negative reviews that have been posted regarding this book, however, this is a book about Liz's search for happiness. It was her personal experiences, thoughts and feelings. She was not writing a tourist book and there is even a little disclosure in the introduction.   I felt that this book spoke to me in so many ways as I have personally experienced so many of the feelings that this author so PERFECTLY describes. One thing that I love about this author is that she is able to find the words for so many feelings and expressions that I NEVER could put into words, especially the way she hits the nail on the head every time with things such as the personification of Depression.  Liz took the ultimate journey that so many wish they could take! After my son was born and I turned 30, I felt like I lost myself somewhere between breastfeeding, being a Mom, working full time, being a wife and barely having time to keep up with getting dressed into real clothes every day. Where was I???? Who was I? Was there any light at the end of the tunnel. I knew I wasn't the gal I was 10 years prior. I did research and found a journey similar to what Liz did in India called a Sedona Soul Adventure (in Sedona, Arizona). I so badly wanted to go to try to pull myself back above this murky water. I couldn't do it due to having an 8 month old that needed his Mommy and the cost. That was 3 years ago. When this book fell into my hands, it was food for my soul. Even though I am not experiencing the same issues I did 3 years ago, I do feel lost at times and yearn for actualization. This book let me know that other women in other places also feel like they need more out of life as a woman. This book brought other ideas, such as meditation/yoga, into my life as a start for a journey into my own soul. I think I will try it.    The only thing I wish Liz would have added in the book was all the down and dirty details about her romancewith Felipe.... He He He!!! You go girl!!

B000FL7CAK|5.0|A true diamond in the rough, this show was.  Why it never caught on his more than I can fathom, but you can't say the CW didn't try.  This show never had the ratings (and on any other station would have been cancelled after a few episodes), but they gave it three outstanding season to find its niche.  Unfortunately, it never did.    Hopefully others will one day discover what those of us smart enough to watching during its original run already know:  that this is one of the best written shows ever to grace a television set.
B00008CMR6|5.0|A pretty good Waynestern from 1970.  While Wayne was ill during the filming of this movie, he hides it pretty well.  His Col. Cord McNally is the hero of the movie, but not its romantic lead.  The running joke is his being \\"comfortable\\" for the women in the movie.  The romantic lead goes to Jorge Rivero as Capt. Pierre Cordona (Wayne calls him Frenchy).  Jennifer O'Neill is the female lead and is OK, but delivers her lines a bit awkwardly.  For my money Susana Dosamentes as Maria Carmen and Sherry Lansing (yes, the later head of 20th Century Fox) as Amelita are more convincing.  Be that as it may, it is a good story and a very enjoyable film.<br /><br />The story opens with Wayne and his Union troops waiting for a gold shipment.  However, some Confederate Raiders know about the shipment and have a rather elaborate scheme to steal to gold as they have in previous shipments.  Wayne pursues the Raiders, is captured and gets to know Cordona and Tuscadora Phillips (Christopher Mitchum).  Wayne finds a way to turn the tables and after the war is over he meets up with Cordona and Tuscadora again to find out who the traitor was that tipped them off about the gold shipments.  They give him what they know and Wayne helps them with some resources to get home.<br /><br />Later, Cordona and McNally meet with Shasta Delany (O'Neill) when she involves them in a shootout as she is trying to escape from some obviously crooked lawmen.  It turns out that she is from the border town where Tuscador lives and it is being run by a very bad man named Ketcham (Victor French).  McNally, Cordona, and Shasta head to Rio Lobo to help their Tuscadora.  Along the way they also meet Tuscadora's father (played wonderfully by Jack Elam) and a great confrontation is set up that takes the rest of the film.  Quite a good Western, I think (my son calls them Waynesterns).<br /><br />Watch for the Wanted poster for Hondo Lane when the action turns around the Sheriff's Office.<br /><br />Recommended!<br /><br />Reviewed by Craig Matteson, Ann Arbor, MIArbor, MI

B00005JPXY|3.0|I have a form of Epilepsy.I am also a film editor.I took my meds in order to see this for an editing class I am taking .I SEIZED ANYWAY (to my surprise especially).I simply write this to WARN people who have certain motion disorders like myself or those with Menieure's Disease.At times I had to watch the film through one eye to complete my assignment. For what it is worth,CLOVERFIELD has some interesting points to it.I personally found the script a little B movieish with a dab of conceit,but from an editor's viewpoint (one eye,remember?) the concept of capturing the attack on  Manhattan reminded me of how Abraham Zapruder captured President Kennedy's assassination live back in 1963.I commend Matthew Reeves for his attempt to shock and thrill us.Drew Goddard, who scripted this film needs to do better than \\"Oh My God!\\" in his dialog.  With all of the comparisons ad nauseum to [[ASIN:B00001QGUM The Blair Witch Project]], that film was mild compared to this one for me.THIS ONE IS TOUGH, MOTION SICKNESS SUFFERERS.BEWARE.
B00003JRCQ|5.0|If you love Jane Austen's Persuasion, you will adore this marvelous film version of the story. And if you don't know the story, this film is the perfect introduction to it! The characters are all brought to life so amazingly! Also, the visuals and settings are extremely faithful to how things would have been at that period in time, right down to the natural lighting! Amanda Root is an absolutely picture perfect Anne. Her transformation from the downtrodden, but dignified and intelligent, daughter of a foolish lord into a hopeful and luminous woman in love is astounding to behold. And Ciaran Hinds is a rugged and masculine Captain Wentworth; portraying with masterful subtlety the Captain's determined but futile attempts to deny his feelings for Anne. The supporting characters in the story are also extremely good. Some are mere caricatures,  as Jane Austen intended them to be, while others are so well-rounded and multi-faceted, they will remind you of people you know in your everyday life. So, if you're a Jane Austen fan, or just a fan of good old-fashioned romance, give yourself a treat by watching this wonderful film.
B000HC2LI0|5.0|I've been wanting the complete West Wing on DVD ever since the program went off the air, but I never wanted to spend so much money on a TV show, but it's well worth it.  I've always loved the West Wing - in my opinion it's the best show EVER on TV - and besides actually seeing the original episodes in their entirety - lots of additional little parts of scenes, there are commentaries by the creators and other extras I haven't had time to see yet.  This will keep me immersed for a long time, and when I finsh the last episode it will be time to refresh my memory and start over - probably in about 3 years.

B0001LJC2K|5.0|Thank you to \\"Christopher Wood\\" for saying what was exactly on my mind.<br /><br />As someone who has just recently gotten into Muse, I must say I did associate the music with Radiohead at times but never Matthew Bellamy's voice. To me, Matthew sounds more like Jeff Buckley. Thom Yorke's voice comes no where near Matthew's voice. Matthew sounds like he has been classically trained which from what I have read he hasn't been. Thom's voice is often off key and bland but he gets away with it with the fantastic music Radiohead produce. And having heard Muse perform live, I must say Matthew never misses a note and sends shivers down your spine with his vocal technique whereas from what I have heard of Thom Yorke live, this isn't the case. I'm not having a go at Radiohead in a any way. I have all their CDs and am listening to \\"In Rainbow\\" as I type and I can tell you now, IT IS NOTHING LIKE MUSE.<br /><br />I will even go so far as to say that Muse are the ultimate band of the naughties. They use grunge, fantastic vocals, great lyrics and classically inspired music to create a sound that is, I feel, absolutely unique.<br /><br />Ok I'm talking about 3 guys, a drummer, a bassist and a vocalist who alternates between lead guitar and keyboards absolutely rocking on either instrument.<br /><br />Look all I'm trying to say is, go out and buy either this album, Origin of Symmetry or Black Holes & Revelations and you won't be disappointed. If you really want a blast, purchase Muse Absolution Tour on DVD and then you will know why I love these guys.

B000YIGNKE|2.0|\\"Persuasion\\" is one of my absolute favorite Jane Austen stories but this adaptation is just insulting. The character of Anne is completely misrepresented! In this version, she is so spiritless and dull it's impossible to imagine how  Captain Wentworth could ever have fallen in love with her in the first place, let alone carry a torch for her for almost a decade! And though the gentleman playing Wentworth is handsome, he lacks charisma and doesn't leave much of an impression. The costumes and sets were quite attractive though, it's just a shame they were wasted on such a terrible production. If you must see every Jane Austen adaptation ever made, just rent this one, because purchasing it would be a mistake.
B000I0QL82|5.0|I'd promised myself that this year I would not gush over the Holiday Season and remain as removed as possible from all the sentimentality associated with this time of the year.    Sadly, I failed and once again sat back and enjoyed an hour or so watching this seasonal favorite.    I do recommend this film for sentimentalists everywhere.
B00005JPXY|4.0|I noticed most of the negative reviewers on here seem to be comparing Cloverfield to the Godzilla mess of a decade ago. That right there should tip you off to quit reading. I of course had to see what all the fuss was about after all the hype and monster concealment. The camera was too jerky, but it really didn't bother me as much as I thought it would. I liked how you felt as if you were in the movie the entire time. Even the end credits leave you feeling like you watched real events on a tape someone left behind. The acting was pretty good for the most part and the CGI monster/New York City destruction looked real.<br /><br />If you get motion sickness easily, avoid at all costs. Otherwise, you can't miss this experience.
0439813786|5.0|The Invention of Hugo Cabret is clever, well written and drawn, and very well done.    The art is specific to the story; neither can be ignored.    Brian Selznick has written an creative and innovative book that is certainly deserving of the Caldecott Award.
0156907399|2.0|Virginia Woolf's novel \\"To the Lighthouse\\" is about the inner psyche of the Ramsay family and friends as they progress over a ten year period. It is written in an stream-of-consciousness style except for an interlude between the two major time periods. I did not find this book very interesting. Although there is a lot of prose on the pages, I found that in the end I knew very little about the major characters. This book just wasn't worth the read for me.  For those of you who don't like \\"spoilers\\" (there is one shocker at the end of the first time period), don't read the introduction by Eudora Welty found in this version. It reads like a book report and essentially summarizes the entire plot.
B000DWMN2S|2.0|Beautiful movie, nice music, good actors.     Awful translation - all actors (except for the Jewish lady at the end) don't even say the word \\"Jew\\", they use a much more derogatory term. If the intent was to show their anti-Semitism, this was lost in translation. In many cases spoken Russian and English subtitles don't match.    A number of things in the story do not make sense. A husband goes to America in 1941 to prepare for the rest of the family to come? From the Soviet Ukraine?? Or from the territory occupied by Germans??? In either case this is total baloney. The question from the old lady if the war is over, is like an old joke about a partisan who is still blowing up trains because he did not know the war ended ...    They don't have any Trabants in Ukraine - the car that was driven in the movie. That was purely East German phenomena. Although the story says that they are traveling from Odessa, Jonathan character comes to Lviv train station - totally different part of Ukraine. And so on...    First half of the movie is nice. After that it is all downhill. \\"Start wearing purple\\" song used in the movie is also incomplete.    I expected more from the movie ...
0060555661|4.0|I unfortunately first entered the stock market in the frenzy of the 1990s. I felt brilliant as my stock picks skyrocketed and like an idiot when they collapsed. The second adjective more accurately described what I knew about investing. I had heard about this book for some time and finally got around to reading it. It provides a common sense, basic approach to investing. Benjamin Graham writes in the gentlemanly style of the early twentieth century and covers a lot of fundamental topics. His passages are a bit dated and can by dry at times. Jason Zweig produces updated commentaries on each chapter in the more cynical and fast-paced style of the present era. He can be brutal in his criticisms of celebrity investors and advisors.  Overall it is an excellent book that should be part of an investing library, but other books are out there that give the same sound advice in a more compact form.
B000IJ79WU|2.0|Okay, I loved the original Superman, and when I saw the Donner extend ended version came out, I was excited. The other sups paled in comparison to the original. So when this version came out, the Donner cut, I figured why rent, the 2nd was good, donner's will even be better, buy it. Wrong.  I feel like this dvd cut version was put together in a day. The cuts are bad and abrupt, the effects a cheap. The original, back in the 70/80s are better, and the story itself isn't fleshed out. It just goes from scene to scene, and if you've never seen the film, you would be lost. It's a real shame. I know Donner only filmed a bit, but still, this version is sub par and the ending..um we've seen it, and this time around it's a total cop out. AVOID and see the original 2nd.
0151013047|3.0|I love the narration of this novel, the escalating tension, the way the author manages to convey the character of the nameless and faceless American listener in the cafe. The story is also compelling and the novel raises questions that we should at least think about, even if we don't find them comfortable or agree with the actions or viewpoints of the character Changez.     Some of the other reviews here have been excessively harsh. I personally did not think Changez is a religious \\"fundamentalist\\"--nowhere in the text does he reveal a belief in Islamic fundamentalism. He isn't even a religious character. Ironically, the primary times when \\"fundamental\\" appears is with respect to the \\"fundamentals first\\" approach of the ruthless Wall Street firm where Changez works--reluctantly. So I understood the book's title to refer to Changez' growing reluctance to be a part of the capitalist machinery. Where does he become a Muslim fundamentalist? He doesn't. Some reviewers also need to remember that Changez is a fictional character, not an actual guy--and please don't confuse the fictional narrator with the author.     That being said, some of the reviews give excessive praise. It does seem to me that if part of the author's goal is to provide insight into the perspective of the immigrant or sympathy for the immigrant's divided loyalties, the book fails by actually *perpetuating* stereotypes rather than challenging them. The writing itself is so strong and captivating that not until I completed the book did I realize how thin and stereotypical Changez turns out to be. There just isn't a lot of insight here. Changez finally comes across as shallow, superficial, self-absorbed, and entitled (in short, all the things he criticizes in American society).    I also felt perturbed by the fact that Changez' perceptions of America are gleaned solely from his interactions at the highest echelon of society. The corner of America in which he functions is indeed ruthless and elitist--towards the majority of our own citizens as well. But the upper-crust Ivy League aspect of America is not the whole country, and Changez draws his conclusions about America based on his interactions with a very small portion of it.     In the end, Hamid posits an excessively simplistic binary opposition that fails to satisfy. Hamid is a brilliant writer and has developed an effective literary device, but in the long run I found myself too disturbed to continue identifying with Changez, and disappointed that crucial opportunities for insights into cross-cultural conflicts were lost. I finished the book with the fear that such a simplistic approach will do more harm than good when it comes to promoting understanding, tolerance, and peace.

0307346617|4.0|Apocalyptic scenarios are my favorite horror theme, and make it a zombie apocalypse and you've made my day.  This book takes a different perspective to the usual zombie apocalyptic horror book.  It is told via interview first person POV in the aftermath of a zombie plague that swept the Earth.  The narrator introduces the premise of the book in an introduction, and how the book was an outgrowth of a UN report that was to detail the post-zombie plague.  A sort of after-action report of what happened and what could have been better.  This book is a collection of the various stories, eye-witness accounts, from people from all walks of life chronicling World War Z and the rise of the zombies (or Zed Head, Zack, G's).<br /><br />While all prior zombie horror books I've read chronicled a select few survivors battling zombies and trying to survive a zombie world, this book is different in that, instead of following a small group of characters, it broadens the cast to include the entire world.  That was one difference I liked, as every apocalyptic book I've read I always wondered what other countries were doing.  The reader gets to see the bigger picture and how different people from different countries survived during the plague.  So you get a glimpse into the various lives affected by this zombie menace.  You get the inside scoop from normal, every day people, to soldiers on the front-lines, doctors, politicians (one amusing interview was with the former chief of staff of the WH and his new job as a \\"fuel collector\\" for a plant, e.g., he collected dung!  The apparent fall-out from a job *not* well-done during the zombie crisis).<br /><br />I did have some disappointments with the book.  One negative about this style is that the reader doesn't get detailed information about the characters.  You don't get inside the character's head and get to know them.  There were a few stories I wish the author could have elaborated on.  The Chinese submarine crew and their families trolling the waters for months by itself, the woman recounting her and her family's escape from the U.S. north to Canada and their experiences, the former infantryman who fought at the Battle of Yonkers (a battle that would have been interesting to read more about), the droves of U.S. refugees who land on Cuba for a better life, the sudden \\"disappearance\\" off the grid of North Korea, etc.  You, like the narrator, are an observer from the outside, you really don't *share* in the experience.  You only know as much as the narrator is told by the interviewee.<br /><br />Another issue that bugged me about the book was that the cause for the zombie outbreak was never touched upon.  There were speculations from one interviewee, a medical doctor that performed questionable organ transplants, who mused it was possibly some sort of virus unheard of that caused the outbreak.  The basics of how the \\"virus\\" spread was mentioned, but the actual cause and research into the mysterious virus was never brought up or explained.  I thought it odd the author didn't include some character(s) who was involved in trying to obtain more knowledge about a virus that decimated the world and humanity.  What caused the virus was something that crossed my mind more than once.<br /><br />Other than those few quibbles, the book was enjoyable and I read it in one day.  This isn't your traditional horror, blood-and-gore zombie fest, so if you're looking for that type of book you will be disappointed.  I think what made this book horrific and terrifying was how realistic the author portrayed the crisis.  Oh, not the zombie outbreak, while that was horrifying that wasn't as horrifying as the blunders and reactions of the governments and people.  That, unfortunately, is something I could see occurring all to well in a disaster of apocalyptic proportions and I think the author portrayed that facet of realism very well.s for months by itself, the woman recounting her and her family's escape from the U.S. north to Canada and their experiences, the former infantryman who fought at the Battle of Yonkers (a battle that would have been interesting to read more about), the droves of U.S. refugees who land on Cuba for a better life, the sudden \\"disappearance\\" off the grid of North Korea, etc.  You, like the narrator, are an observer from the outside, you really don't *share* in the experience.

B00003CX9E|5.0|Orson Welles at his finest. Any time he won artistic control of his movies, he made greatness. I could hardly imagine how difficult it would be to make the greatest movie ever and do it as your first movie before your 26th birthday. When you look at movies, there is before \\"Citizen Kane\\" and after. There were so many innovations in that movie that have become standard now, some people fail to realize how great this movie is. It has everything.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|This DVD series not only has amazing and unique footage, but it just shows how intricately designed our planet is from the big scale Himalaya mountains to tiny bugs in the jungles of Borneo.  David Attenborough does a great job narrating--make sure you get the version where he is the narrator.

Anyway, I'm only reviewing this album to help it out a lil, How the heck does this album not have a 5 star rating?  I see so much crap on Amazon w/ 5 stars, but not this, wow...    Anyway, prolly one of the most beautiful albums ever made...Listen to it, \\"...when your drifting off to sleep\\"    O.o when they gunna have a new CD, I feel so starved...I guess theres no need to rush genius.
B0012PDVQ2|5.0|One of the top ten best science fiction movies, a young Harrison Ford is a pleasure to watch.  It has the balance of great story and compelling visuals. This film was influential on many sci fi flicks that followed and certainly worth a rewatch if it has been a while since you've seen it.
1400064287|3.0|This has the same format and style as \\"The Tipping Point\\" or \\"Blink\\" (scientific study mixed in with anecdotal stories and examples) but not nearly as well-written or well-researched.  I enjoyed parts of it, but overall was disappointed in comparison.
B000E0WJIC|5.0|With top 40 sounding like computerized rap/hiphop poppunk that sounds like my injured dog and actual rock bands sounding exactly the same, its refreshing to hear a metal band with some real substance behind them. They aren't obsessed with rebelling against society but at the same time aren't always wailing about a girl who didn't look at them the right way. The emotion is real high but not sterotypical and the music is the best i have heard in a really long time. I got into them about a year ago and just preordered their new album, Scream Aim Fire which will definetly be just as good. If you're looking for some metal with the perfect mix of screaming, singing, and solos then buy this freaking album. Like now.
B0000TB050|5.0|This is U2 minus the pretensions seen in some of their other dvd's. The performances are outstanding. They interact with each other, and the most enthusiastic crowd I've seen in a U2 concert. At one point during \\"All I Want is You\\" a fan throws water on Bono, and he quips \\"all i want is f***in you man\\" :).  Classic U2, excellent concert.

The production quality is absolutely amazing.
B000UR9T82|4.0|I purchased this product shortly after it was released on Blu-ray.  Now I am rating the blu-ray experience more than anything else, because it is a blu-ray trilogy.  I am not a movie critic (atleast I don't get paid for it) and the Spidey movies have been out for a while-we all know if we like them or don't.    On blu-ray these movies looks amazing.  I have a 1080i DLP (4 years old), Playstation 3, and XBOX 360 Elite with HD drive.  I run higher end HDMI from Monster Cable, as well as Monster optical for sound.  I have a 7.1 surround sound home theater and a 250W sub pushing the base.  Not the best setup but absloutely satisfying.    The clarity of the blu-ray discs is amazing.  Now, that isn't to say that every release is worthy of the new technology, but for this release it is.  The special effects are clear and crisp.  The sound is wonderful.  Just to make sure I was enjoying every little bit of my new experience, I watched the movies on regular DVD before putting in my BD's and I have to say that in some parts of the movie I heard sounds that were not audible before.  It is like night and day.    We can complain all we want about the content of the last installment in the trilogy, but what is done is done.  Yeah, I know that the character development was lacking in 3.  Yes, I agree that Topher Grace was a terrible choice for Venom/Eddie Brock... but this is about the technical side.. Blu-ray is an excellent media choice for those looking for the next gen of high definition.
B0001GOH6Q|5.0|This movie is spectacular.  Tim Burton outdoes his past efforts in this adaptation of the book.  The imagery is amazing and you get lost in this tale of love, life and redemption.  Ewan MacGregor, Jessica Lange and Albert Finney each give a wonderful performance as your disbelief is suspended and the tall tales run rampant. A must see and a must own.

0316010669|2.0|I bought this book because the introductory story about the Statue That Didn't Look Right fasinated me.     The author's propositions are that:  1. Decisions made very quickly can be as good as decisions made cautiously and deliberately.  2. Our unconscious is a powerful force.  3. Our snap judgements and first impressions can be educated and control.    This book was organized in such a way that the rest of the chapters after the introduction were devoted to proving that the three propositions really work. Psychological tests and theories, including the \\"thin slicing\\", were brought in to support them.     But can I rely on my instinct every time I make a decision? NO!! According to the author, snap decision can turn out to be wrong as well.    So what I gained from reading this book was almost nothing. The book stops short of telling me how to harness my snap decisions so that they are right most of the time. And that is no surpise. I don't expect anyone can tell me that.    Is it entertaining to read? Only the Introduction is. The rest, that is devoted on psychological stuff, is boring.

It was not a subject I cared to delve into, at least that's what I thought before I began reading.    I'm not sure at what point I got sucked in, but I did.  I just finished the book a few minutes ago and had to write a review.  Read this book.  The author does an amazing job with the development of each of the characters in the story.  Each chapter is told from a different character's point of view, allowing you to understand them better as well as telling what is happening in the story.  Usually I don't like this kind of book because it causes you to get lost, but the author limited the characters so it works well and is the only way a story like this can truly be told so you understand each of the complex sides.    It is a book worth your time, and you won't be the same after reading it.  Enjoy!

0393051587|5.0|Over the course of my life, I have enjoyed many and sundry versions of A Christmas Carol on screen and stage. But only recently did I finally get around to reading it. To my surprise, it turned out to be a Christian story. I knew it was inspiring, but I never dreamed there were so many Christian references, because only a few of them have survived in the many dramatic productions. (There are actually fifty or sixty different film versions of a Christmas Carol to date. You can read about most of them on the definitive Christmas Carol web site, [...]<br /><br />The amazing thing about this five-part story, which is one of the shortest of Dickens' works, is that we never tire of seeing or hearing it. We seem addicted to the idea that Christmas can transform us if we let it. In A Christmas Carol, we see the Victorian Christmas we have always dreamed of. In the miser Scrooge, we see the best and worst of ourselves. And in the conclusion to the tale, we see the hope that we, similarly, can be transformed by the Spirit of Christmas.<br /><br />It's interesting that A Christmas Carol is actually a ghost story. Tim Burton is not too far off in that regard. I suppose Dickens could have used angels; but ghosts fit the romantic sensibilities of his Victorian audience. They also kill any elusions that his audience may have had at the beginning that this would be a religious tale, as well as add a dramatically enticing element to the story. I mean, spirits. That begs the question, are they good or bad? Plus, it fits that a dead man might send spirits back to help a friend, while he may not have that kind of authority over angels. But what were the spirits if not angels, and what are angels if not spirits?<br /><br />At any rate, it's a wonderful idea for a story - one of the best. Making each of the spirits represent Past, Present or Future Christmases was genius. As I said, it has five acts, the first being Scrooge's former state; the second through fourth, each of the spirits who visit him; and the last his reborn state. He is reborn, you know. I cannot think of a better example of a man who's life has been changed by the Spirit of Christ in the New Birth than Scrooge. It isn't explained that way in the text, but it is implied by how Scrooge describes his change on Christmas morning after his night of visitations:<br /><br />\\"I will live in the Past, the Present and the Future! The Spirits of all Three shall strive within me. Oh Jacob Marley! Heaven and the Christmas Time be praised for this! I say it on my knees, old Jacob, on my knees!\\"<br /><br />What is this, but the attitude and posture of a repentant man. What are the three Spirits, but the Spirit of Christ. What is Heaven and the Christmas Time but Christ in his heart. Other references in the story confirm this.<br /><br />Then there is the way Scrooge acts after his experience:<br /><br />\\"I don't know what to do! I am as light as a feather, I am as happy as an angel, I am as merry as a schoolboy. I am as giddy as a drunken man. A Merry Christmas to everybody! A Happy New Year to all the world. Hallo here! Whoop! Hallo!\\"<br /><br />What is this, but the actions and feelings of a man that has been born again and filled with the Holy Spirit. The 180 degree reversal of Scrooge's nature in the events that follow confirm this.<br /><br />After this, Scrooge buys a turkey - a gigantic turkey - and sends it to Bob Cratchit's house in a cab. Here's how he felt afterwards:<br /><br />\\"The chuckle with which he said this, and the chuckle with which he paid for the turkey, and the chuckle with which he paid for the cab, and the chuckle with which he recompensed the boy, were only to be exceeded by the chuckle with which he sat down breathless in his chair again, and chuckled till he cried.\\"<br /><br />This is sheer joy: the joy of giving, the joy of Christmas, the joy of the New Birth.<br /><br />I love Scrooge, A Christmas Carol and Charles Dickens. In his famous Christmas tale, Dickens hasgiven us the hope that if Scrooge can change, so can we. And it doesn't take a visit from three ghosts: the source of change is right under our noses. Every year at Christmas time, God reminds us that He has given us the way to change: Christ. Every year, the hope is renewed in the world and in our hearts. Like Scrooge, let us be filled with the Spirit of Christmas, the Spirit of Christ. Let's wake up each morning shouting \\"Hallo here! Whoop! Hallo!\\" and go forth doing the work of Christ.<br /><br />A word about the historical context of A Christmas Carol, from Wikipedia:<br /><br />\\"A Christmas Carol in Prose, Being a Ghost Story of Christmas (commonly known as A Christmas Carol) is a novella by Charles Dickens, first published on December 19, 1843, with illustrations by John Leech.

The beginning where we're just given a tour of a goodbye party to the main character is lame and makes you think \\"ok this is dumb, when is it going to pick up ?\\". Then it gets started and holds your attention and never lets go.<br /><br />  I admire how realistic it is and how well done it was made. It's basically the Blair Witch Project with a monster and...a bigger budget but it's only flaw is that it follows the Blair Witch Project type of film-making too closely. By the end a movie that could of been entirely fantastic is just literly...The Blair Witch Project with a monster. Yes you never saw the witch and you see the monster here but still the formula is about the same.<br /><br />  The actors and effects carry the film well so they might as well of went the distance and gave us an ending with more answers and one less gloomy. If they did I would've definetly gave it **** or even *****. Instead we get another ending that makes the entire audience yell \\"oh come on!, that was it!\\". Other than that the movie was fun and entertaining and full of tension.
B000K15VSA|3.0|I read the book it's based on in the seventies and loved it. I saw the movie when it came out and my first thought; after the eye candy wore off, was that it just did not do justice to the book.<br />The making of disc shows that the film makers didn't like the book. The final screenwriter says it's short on narrative. It's Scott's vision.<br />It perpetuates the myth that humans come first. That isn't true in the book. In the book, being human doesn't make one a better human. In the movie the bots are just vicious killers. They should be wiped out.<br />Having said that, it is still one of the best examples of set decoration and production values ever filmed. Alas not much else.
B000I2MRHE|5.0|I think this product is great.. I bought it for my son who was 3 1/2 months old at the time.. The pediatrician said he needed to do tummy time 4x a day.. He hated tummy time so I got him this in hopes he would change his outlook on it.. He has, he is almost 5 months now and he love it, he plays with the toys on each petal.. Once he's tired of one he spins himself to the next.. Also to make this item even better, it is so compact.. You take it out to play with it than you can fold the mat up and take the tummy device and put it under his bed or in the closet or where ever.. It can go anywhere you go because its so easy to maneuver.. I would recommend this to everyone..
B00005JPXY|1.0|After 100 years of movie making, I didn't think it was possible for Hollywood to make a really bad movie. I was wrong. I was so thankful when it was finally over. If they were attempting to be artistic with this movie, they failed miserably.

B000PY52EU|5.0|The Los Angeles Times gave this movie such a bad review, and the way it was described set my feminist heart on fire...I would see the billboards and think what a sexist piece of *&%#. That was a huge flaw on my part, to judge something without seeing it myself. But then, this week, my dad told me he saw it and he liked it very much. He and I are movie buffs...SO...<br />I was completely impressed with this movie!<br />Original script, with such evocative dialog. Samuel Jackson and Cristina Ricci were impeccable. The other actors, including Justin Timberlake, were all top notch and belivable.I will not recount the story line here, as I am sure other reviewers have done so, but this was a story with heart and soul, about love and respect and understanding crossing all lines. About falling to the pits of agony and despair and being loved and helped up. About the healing power of music.<br />The score deserves honorable mention all it's own. The BEST music I have ever heard! GET the soundtrack, I am ordering it after I write this.<br />This was a truly artistic film, with some very painful and violent moments but they did serve to tell the story.<br />I am very happy I saw this.
B00005JPXY|5.0|J.J.Abram's boldly tells the story of those civilians who flee the city under giant monster attack from all those films in the 50's. The classic and contemporary Godzilla movies tell the story from the scientist and the army's perspective, never the little guy, only the big picture. \\"Cloverfield\\" focuses on those little guys and sells it by having the film done in blocks of \\"real time\\" video, which must be difficult to orchestrate on such mass extra fleeing-scenes. This is plenty brave to have a major picture without any major stars (another aspect that adds an edge of reality to the project), without music soundtrack (naturally, although Godzilla fans should stay for the end credits which include a revamp of the \\"Tokyo Evacuation March\\") and the boldest aspect: without a camera tripod. Like `em or hate `em there's little time to worry about that as the pace of the film is pretty rapid, and overall the film is a trim hour and a half (probably the best given the unorthodox visuals). Naturally, there's no \\"big\\" explaination offered or omniscient narration to clear things up, but honestly would the \\"little guy\\" really get one? I'm still waiting on the tidy epilogue following Katrina.<br /><br />The big question: How does the monster look?<br />The Answer: Pretty cool, pretty original, but it really is less the point, than the reactions mand behavior of our fleeing cast. And just to make things creepy--er, there are smaller critters to be found in Manhattan in addition to the daddy-mama-monster.<br /><br />Again, \\"Cloverfield\\" is the tale of some survivors of a giant-monster attack, survivors who need some advice on how to behave in a monster movie:<br /><br />1.) Never go BACK into the city, during the evacuation<br />2.) Never take the Subway tunnel to go BACK into the city during evac.<br />3.) Once in the subway tunnels, follow the fleeing rats!<br />4.) Monster bites are bad!<br />5.) Listen to the army guys.<br />6.) Don't try to video tape the entire event.<br /><br />Pre- or post film prep, check out the faux-Myspace pages of some of the major players.

B000JK8OYU|5.0|The Beatles, along with George and Giles Martin, are brilliant without question. The music in and of itself will always stand up on its own forever and ever--that is what makes them the greatest pop musical artists of all time! But I must say, this \\"remix\\" album designed to accompany the gorgeous Cirque du Soleil show \\"Love\\" is perfect in everyway. Not only is it a joy to hear the songs remastered and blended together in such creative ways, but also to hear some of them stripped down to a glorious pure form (like \\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\\" or my favorite, \\"Because\\") is almost heavenly. It flows evenly, swirling around our ears and painting pictures in our mind, taking us beyond our imaginations...just as the Boys would have hoped. I love the Beatles, and I love this album.
B000YXMMAE|5.0|I decided to download the album from the band's website and I chose to pay five dollars for it.  This was a good decision, because I've listened to it four times now, and I've decided that it was worth the $5 that I paid.  There's not a bad song on it.  This is one album to listen to more than once before forming an opinion on it.  Even if you don't like it on first listen (which I'm sure most of the negative reviewers did), listen to it again.  Give it another chance.  You may just change your mind!    Personally, In Rainbows ranks right up there with OK Computer, The Bends, and Kid A as one of their best albums (as I mentioned in the title of this review).  It's definitely better than their previous album, Hail to the Thief, which, in my opinion, is their worst album.
B000GRUS22|5.0|I waited for months before purchasing this latest Enigma title based on samples I had heard online.I even experienced very little interest or motivational drive in acquiring A Posteriori(which was HIGHLY unusual from someone who has EVERY Enigma release since 1990). Samples are just samples and only give rough glimpses of what the actual album is like;I foolishly put off buying this title for so long because I was not impressed by what I heard on the snippets of sound and by the lukewarm and mixed early reviews by both critics and fans.My first reaction was, \\"This cannot be the \\"new\\" Enigma sound??\\" My next thought was,\\"This new material has such a common, lack luster, ambient,trance-like electronic quality indestinguishable from all other electronica groups/bands/artists out there!\\" These are thoughts coming from a long time devoted Enigma fan since 1990...    I caved and bought A Posteriori in the early summer of 2007.Listened to it for a few weeks, then,put it away.I needed time to come up with clearer thoughts, a beter take and or perspective in order to do a review and see if my perception of the album had changed.It is now January 2008;I've decided to play this disc for the first time since last year.    I appreciate it much more now than I did on my first initial listening sessions of last year! One of the most common statements I have noticed other reviewers say is how this new Enigma project sounds nothing like his previous works and yet has retained that consistent and inherent trademark \\"sound\\" that Cretu does so damn well.Even I cannot quite put my finger on what it is.Familiarity? Is that the word?...What is highly evident or strikingly upfront (I am no musician or tech wizard) is the new or different synthesizer machinations and scapes created;Truly, Cretu spared no expense on updating his A.R.T. recording studio located in Ibiza,Spain---with this latest production it shows! It is absolutely a new direction with new material.Michael Cretu/Enigma has made it clear that the Gregorian chants,the foreign female seductive voices are gone. However, after a long absence from other previous albums, Louisa a.k.a \\"The Voice of Enigma\\" Stanley returns to lend her spoken vocals as the devilishly dark temptress on Dancing With Mephisto.Is she a beautiful woman luring someone who is weak to dance with the devil or is she a ghastly vision as in Mel Gibson's \\"The Passion of The Christ\\" actress who played Satan?One thing is strikingly assured that like ALL Enigma releases, Cretu produces music that fills the human mind with such rich otherworldy images and captivating visuals.Such adjectives as atmospheric, ambient,somber,moody,mysterious,hypnotic,etc. are all cliche words used before---However, that is exactly what A Posteriori displays in a number of tracks to great effect.The percussion and beats are still deep and even wonderfully layered in some sections(the track Dancing With Mephisto illustrates such enticing and \\"catchy\\" beats or hooks that work as artistic musical material and not gimmicky filler).Segueing and song transitions are smooth. The trademark Enigma horn intro on all of his albums is still present.However, the ethnic and Gregorian chants are used extremely sparingly;Very sparse approach this time;After all, what Cretu/Enigma makes clear is that this album's theme is about a voyage to the stars---  is it from the viewpoint of an astrologer? An astronomer? An astronaut?Or that of an astrophysicist?Perhaps all of the above. The thematic continuity is very well kept together. Michael Cretu is very focused on A Posteriori as to it's subject matter and does not leave a lot of \\"ambiguity\\" as on previous albums. Some fans like this and some don't.I believe this is where some critics and long time die hard fans may have been disappointed;Some liked the ambiguity of previous projects.     One omission that would have made a wonderful bonus track would have been the inclusion of the \\"original\\" version of \\"Hello and Welcome\\". It is the version that includes vocals by Andru Donalds and is more of an uptempo rock pop vibe than what Cretu released on A Posteriori.It was the version used as the theme for German boxer Felix Sturm's grand entrance back in 2006 for the WBA championship title.The original music video version of Hello and Welcome can be seen on YouTube.com.    This 2006 Enigma relase without a doubt is something that should not be missed by either long time fans or new ones as well as those who have never bought an Enigma album.The only Enigma album that took me a long time to get used to (even now, it remains my least favorite one) is 1996's Le Roi Est Mort,Vive Le Roi. A Posteriori is 10 years after that release and is definitely in another realm or direction.Many thought, as I, that 2003's Voyageur was the album to mark or segue into a new sonic and artistic direction for Enigma; Not so.Voyageur was just a more \\"pop\\" oriented and accessible album for possibly new listeners who were never into the Enigma sound. A Posteriori is the definite marker towards a new musical change,territory, and even style!
B00005V3Z4|5.0|Wow! Hauntingly beautiful and sad. Mysterious and deeply absorbing. Superbly choreagraphed, story, characters, and music all.
B000065BPB|5.0|Reviewed 20-30 different headphones at different Websites before selecting this model. These phones were bought as a Christmas present to replace some inexpensive AIWA Headphones my teenage son had used for 5-6 years. He gets a lot of use out of these new Sennheiser phones hooked up with a Samsung MP3 player. They are very high quality at a reasonable price.    Amazon Com had a great price and quick delivery. Could not have been happier with product selection and delivery of the item.
B000K15VSA|5.0|This Five-Disc Ultimate Collector's Edition is fantastic.  It's a treasure trove of behind the scenes info on this classic movie.  This cut isn't radically different -- but the new print looks AMAZING!!  That's reason alone for seeing it!!  If you're a fan of this movie, you have to check this out.   The main attractions for this edition are the extras.  And they are great!!  You get ALL the previous versions of the movie as well as a rare work-print.  Of great interest to me and any fan of design are the re-prints of concept/design sketches with their corresponding film stills.  A 2007 special documentary covering all aspects of the making of the film is a treat!! You've got interviews with everyone involved with the film, all the actors down to the special-effects people and the producers.   The part with the special effects people is great -- I work in the industry and it's great to see the ingenuity of these people. Blade Runner is the last analog sci-fi masterpiece.  If you've never seen this movie - do it now- (maybe with a less completist version) - but see it.  If you're a big fan like me - you won't be disappointed...hours of fun!!

0340766166|5.0|This is an old classic as far as I am concerned. As you read through the book, it gives you an insight into the elegant and committed life style of the Japanese culture.

1400063515|2.0|On face, The Black Swan may be the worst book I have ever read.  The author comes across as a pompous jackass.  He rambles on.  His examples are muddy.  He praises his sources, using annoying terms like \\"uberphilosopher\\" repeatedly.      But after thinking about it, I believe this was all INTENTIONAL! Taleb is laughing his way to the bank at people foolish enough to take this book seriously.    Taleb admits to enjoying childish pranks like slipping ice down someone's shirt.  The Black Swan is one huge prank! Taleb proves his point that books sell based upon contagion, not because they are any good.  Bravo!
B000XUUQQK|4.0|like the box says \\"fear. in the flesh.\\" couldn't have put it any better. see the first one was good because it had that supernatural eerieness to it. no matter where you went, alone or not he's there. very different than this boogeyman 2. it was good just different. i guess i was expecting it to be along those same lines, but no. this one was a real boogeyman. that made all your worst fears come to life. someone that can make you feel a fear unlike any other you've ever felt. and this one is very real. it bleeds, it can be stopped, and it's no longer only in the dark. the story follows a young woman and her brother who were both traumatized by the boogeyman when they were children. now years later, they have struggled to overcome this fear...but she's having a hard time, and now she feels him closer than before. she checks in to this facility, where people with severe phobias reside. little do they know that where they come to overcome their fears, will be the place where they will face their fears. laura, comes in and brings along with her the boogeyman phobia. as soon as she settles in things start to happen. no one believes her. the man in charge, played by tobin bell, turns his back on her as well. she must do something before her worst fear becomes reality. it has it's moments. the killing scenes were pretty good. the story was okay, but it would have been better had it been a true continuation of the first one. the actors were good, and of course tobin bell, just a nice creepy all around guy. just with that voice you know. although it didn't give me goosebumps like the first, i enjoyed it.
0439813786|3.0|There are so many better books of this type out there. Read some Philip Pullman (not just The Golden Compass), Joan Aiken, or Leon Garfield (best of all, but least known). The illustrations don't really add all that much to the so-so story, nor are the characters very original or well-developed.
B00005JPXY|5.0|When reviewing Cloverfield obvious comparisons to movies like [[ASIN:0767817478 Godzilla]] are easy to make, but this film is so much more then a simple monster bash. Cloverfield is a wild mix of Godzilla like monster fun, blended with [[ASIN:B00001QGUM The Blair Witch Project]]  camera style and [[ASIN:B0008KLVG4 Jaws (30th Anniversary Edition)]] like suspense all blended together to make one of the most perfect monster/disaster/horror films of the modern day.<br /><br />First off lets give some credit to the incredible job the producers did marketing this film. For all the months leading up to its release potential viewer's searched the internet for clews as to what this film may be about, all to no avail. No movie I've ever seen has been surrounded by so much mystery. What is it really about? Is it a giant monster? Aliens? Government tests? What? You really have to see it (or read reviews on Amazon) to find out.<br /><br />The movie is shot completely, from beginning to end, on a hand held digital camera that different characters take turns filming with throughout the course of the movie, very much like Blair Witch Project. Although this can take some getting used to, and yes it did make me extremely dizzy and disoriented, the artistic benefits from filming a movie in this way are obvious from the beginning. Viewers are able to see enough of the action and disaster to satisfy the biggest action junky, yet enough is left unexplained that the movie doesn't at any time seem fake or scripted. You are able to see the entire story as it unfolds though the eyes of a very small group of people which allows you to identify and ultimately sympathize with them. As well as giving the movie a more personal effect, the home camera gives this movie a very post 9/11 feel. We've all seen the shots of the WTC falling in NYC and people running for their lives as the dust from the towers quickly moves down the street engulfing everything in its path. Watching the Empire State Building fall to pieces before your very eyes will bring back memories of those fateful days in 2001 when our lives changed forever. The camera style also gives this movie a very Jaws like effect. The director of this film was able to show just enough of the monster to satisfy his audience, yet also hide it enough so that by the end you still aren't quite sure what it was or what it looked like. Although there are some shots where the monster thing is in full view and staring right at the camera, it is still hard to see because the camera is of such \\"poor\\" quality and doesn't allow you to see much. The monster is hidden in full view, a brilliant way of building suspense that is as scary as it is original (at least in the giant monster genera).<br /><br />Despite the very blatant references to 9/11 it is very refreshing to see a film that is brave enough to re-create that fateful day yet stay neutral on any political commentary. Cloverfield does not exist to pass judgment on anyone, or to give its own opinions or views on 9/11, instead it tries, and succeeds in my opinion, in showing how the events took place from the eyes of those who witness it. The movie focuses on the disaster itself, separating itself from all the political commentary and conspiracy theories that followed, and for that I give it major props for that.<br /><br />Although the movie steers clear of a lot of political commentary, it does not hesitate to give us a generous helping of social commentary. What does everyone do when the see the head of the Statue of Liberty rolling down the street? They take pictures on their camera phones of course, and then they huddle around the video camera to get a glimpse of what it was that just invaded their city. What do people do when the cops and military are preoccupied with fighting off the giant monster? They loot electronic stores and steal TV's and radios, a clear reference to the chaos that followed disaster in New Orleans and to a lesser extent Baghdad afterthe US invasion. People watch spongbob squarpants along with news footage of the destruction of Manhattan. Its the little things like this that are what sets Cloverfield above Godzilla and [[ASIN:B00005JO20 King Kong (Widescreen Edition)]] (as much as I love Peter Jackson) and makes it something memorable and special.<br /><br />But this movie doesn't get bogged down in its social commentary and 9/11 references. in its heart of hearts Cloverfield, for all its artistic filming style and commentary, really just wants to be an action/horror movie. From the second the monster shows up in the city to the very end every minute is filled with gun battles, fighter jets flying overhead unleashing their rockets into the city, and old fashioned giant monster destroying the city fun. This is what Godzilla should have been, instead of being a Hollywood style movie, shot in a very unoriginal and cheesy style with an unimaginative script and plot, Cloverfield manages to give action on a monumental scale yet show its audience relatively little of what is actually going on. The scares in this movie resemble those found in movies like [[ASIN:B000TJBN80 28 Weeks Later (Widescreen Edition)]]. There is a scene about halfway though the movie that takes place in an underground tunnel in almost complete darkness with all the light coming from a few dim lights in the ceiling and a night vision scope on the camera, reminiscent of similar scenes in last years sequel to [[ASIN:B00005JMA8 28 Days Later (Widescreen Edition)]]. This movie does not rely on cheap scares that any idiot can do, instead it slowly builds up tension and manages to keep its audience tense and scared throughout its entire running time.<br /><br />Believe the hype people, this movie not only lives up to the mystery and excitement of its trailers but surpasses them. This movie has all the potential to become the next great cult classic and join the ranks of horror greats from history. Move aside Godzilla, there's a new giant monster in town.<br /><br />Re-watch value; very high.h spongbob squarpants along with news footage of the destruction of Manhattan.

B000G0O5N2|5.0|A great action movie with great writing and a feverish pace that I love to watch again and again.  Blu-Ray makes the experience unbelievably clear both visually and sonically.
0380733358|5.0|This is the one to read.  Follett made his mark with this novel and it is a taut and well written \\"what if\\" story centered around WWII.    It has it all, cold-blooded killers, military secrets which can change the course of the war.      A page turner from start to finish and I have read it a few times over the years.  The movie with Donald Sutherland is also a very worthwhile one to watch if you get the chance to.  It is very well done and ranks up there as one of the better ones in the genre.
B0007MWZEK|1.0|This was a x-mas present from my wife's grandmother, I did not spend money from my pocket for the Swivel Sweeper -- thank the gods.    Used this product for about three months and _loved_ it. I have hardwood floors and the regular vacuum I brought along from my old, carpeted apartment has wheels that do my floor no good and also doesn't really work well on the floor. So the Swivel Sweeper was great, until it stopped working. I cleaned all the dirt, hair and dust from the brushes, which was a task in itself as they cannot be removed for cleaning, and it still wouldn't work.    I know all about rechargeable batteries and have been making sure to let it go for _no more_ than 10 hours, going out of my way to make it 6-8. 2 more than the required about isn't much of a margin for a product I've been using infrequently. I spent 25-30 minutes on hold waiting for a customer service representative who spoke down to me and had the most incredulous, apathetic and unconcerned attitude I've encountered from any help line. Unless you're a stay at home person who makes a point of keeping timers next to their chargers, avoid this product.    It would have been songs and fireworks had it not been for its lack of endurance, Ontel Products Corporation's bloody awful customer service and the cheaply made components. Unfortunately, the Swivel Sweeper is the spawn of infomercial mediocrity, and people are paying to find that out.
B000UD0ESA|5.0|It was a good movie.  I ordered it for my husband, he considers it worthy of keeping on DVD or we would have just ordered it on demand.  It has a twist at the end so you are not bored.  I would recommend it if you haven't seen it.
B00005JPXY|1.0|That's a first for me, and I've been going to the movies for close to 40 years!<br /><br /> The film jerked around almost constantly throughout the entire movie! It was so bad that a warning was posted all over the place at the movie theater that I attended. The sign read: \\" Warning! This film will can cause motion sickness similar to that of a roller coaster ride!\\" I have to admit, I thought at first the theater must be kidding, but when I ended-up having to close my eyes through 75% of the movie, the warning was a gross under statement! And it was unbearably annoying!<br /><br />Then the acting was terrible! Everyone came across as two-dimensional cardboard, with a pretty face! The beginning of the story reminded me of a dull soap opera until the monster strikes, then it reminded me of a cheap, Made-in-Japan, 1950's style, monster movie! How dull and tedious can you get?<br /><br />I guess the worst part was how much the destruction was made to remind anyone without amnesia how horrible the 9/11 disaster was! What a filmmaker will do to make a buck! Members of my own family missed being killed or injured by the skin-of-there-teeth or from dumb luck! Do I, and tens of thousands of other movie goers, who were directly affected by 9/11 need to be reminded of this real life horror when we go out to be entertained? Memo to future filmmakers: Try and have a little imagination and wreck a different city next time!<br /><br />And to think the director of this film, J.J. Abrams, is the same director working on the new Star Trek movie. I can just imagine what a muddled mess he's going to create if Cloverfield is the best he can do!<br /><br />This is, without a doubt, absolutely one of the very worst movies I have ever seen in my entire life! What ever you do - don't bring your children, or someone with post traumatic stress issues, an inner ear infection or prone to migraine headaches to this movie! You'll be doing them a very big favor, indeed!<br /><br />For a MUCH more entertaining approach to Science Fiction see:[[ASIN:B000059HAE Zardoz]] and [[ASIN:B000059HAC Enemy Mine]] and [[ASIN:B000TZN7KQ Fantastic Planet]] and [[ASIN:B00003CXXP A.I. - Artificial Intelligence (Widescreen Two-Disc Special Edition)]] and [[ASIN:630587493X Bicentennial Man]] and [[ASIN:B001S86J0I Galaxy Quest (Deluxe Edition)]][[ASIN:B000059HAE Zardoz]] and [[ASIN:B000059HAC Enemy Mine]] and [[ASIN:B000TZN7KQ Fantastic Planet]] and [[ASIN:B00003CXXP A.I. - Artificial Intelligence (Widescreen Two-Disc Special Edition)]] and [[ASIN:630587493X Bicentennial Man]] and [[ASIN:B001S86J0I Galaxy Quest (Deluxe Edition)]]
B00005JPXY|1.0|I can very much appreciate the efforts and ideas/methods of this film. It gave me chills in back of my head that this could be really happened before viewing this film.<br /><br />However we all know that pausing/pretend this film as authentic/really happened events by shooting with hand held video cam does not convinced me as more realistic when I started viewing film. It just made me sick and I really wanted to walk out of the theater.<br /><br />It was very unfortunate for me because what underneath of this insanely shaky camera works I also saw something very great.......:(

0439882826|5.0|This Pop-Up book was amazing. Anyone who is a fan of Star Wars or Pop-Ups will be happy to add this book to their collection.
B00000J2PH|5.0|Quick shipment.  Received in a timely manner for my child to receive for a school project.
B000W04S6U|5.0|I proudly own all three soundtracks.  This soundtrack really does give you the feeling of Halo through the music.  I think that it truly does the franchise the justice that it deserves.  A \\"MUST BUY\\" for any gamer.
0800141660|5.0|I'm not good at movie reviews, but this one is an excellent romance movie for a quiet night at home with your partner.  Its one that can be watched over and over with enjoyment.
B0006Q1UL6|5.0|This book is very simple and I wasn't sure my daughter would like it, but my 21 month old adores it and wants to read it over and over again!
1594489505|5.0|A Thousand Splendid Suns is a novel of deep anguish, unspeakable pain, heartfelt beauty, and unconquerable love. It takes place in the war-torn but beloved city of Kabul, Afghanistan, over a period of forty years. The protagonists of the book are women, Afghan women, Mariam and Laila. Their stories are difficult to read, yet impossible to ignore. Their worlds are three-dimensional, showing shades of gray and rainbows, not just black and white. Hosseini reveals layers of Afghan history and culture that would take years of study for a foreigner to uncover, much less understand.    After reading A Thousand Splendid Suns, I understand why Hosseini's two novels have been wildly popular. He has the rare and exquisite ability to write with both sparseness and beauty. Though the events in the novel are far from sunshiny, Hosseini could not be accused of melodrama. He conveys both depth and tenderness with a living, genuine voice that admits humor and love, even in the pathos and pain of life. The plot is steady and surprising. And the characters' voices are ringing and unmistakable, unsilenced in spite of their bitter circumstances. These voices, hitherto unheard, are the triumph of A Thousand Splendid Suns.

B000X5KSWM|5.0|I bought this CD because I have listened to Nightwish since 2000.  I did not expect this solo CD from Tarja to be as good as any of the Nightwish material.  But I was wrong.  I have listened to it many times and find something new every time.  The writing is very different than Nightwish, and Tarja's voice is better than ever.  The writing is more mature than Nightwish in my opinion.  It is difficult to try to categorize this album into one genre.      At this time, Amazon does not have any sound clips from the CD available.  I suggest visiting the CD s site   mywinterstorm.com and click the album link for samples.     I suggest to anyone that this is a great CD and worth getting.  It will see a lot of play time in my player.
B000OLGCI4|5.0|This was a special gift to our son, who first saw the original Jungle Book in the theater when he was approximately 10 years old.  This movie has always rated HIGH in his collection.  Now that he is in the movie industry, himself, this special 40th Anniversary Platium Edition was a MUST in his DVD library.

B000GFLKF8|5.0|I think this has to be the cleverest, most fascinating heist movie I've seen. It's definitely one I plan to watch again and again!
B000MR9D5E|5.0|My wife heard Oprah's recommendation and told me she wanted a copy for a gift to someone in the family.  We looked every where before the holidays and could not find it anywhere except on Amazon.  I ordered it for my wife not knowing if was a gift she intended for me.  I love video documentaries and Planet Earth is a must for any collector.  In every piece I learned something I didn't know before.  I highly recommend this DVD set.
B000YMBBH0|5.0|If you like action and suspense then you will love these movies, especially in HD-DVD. These movies look great and the story of these movies is quite like nothing else. Based of books written by a author who was known for spy type books these movies will be an excellent addition to anyones library. What better addition to make than all three at once.
1596912855|5.0|I knew I was going to like this book as soon as I read the dedication.  It says something like, \\"To Colin Firth:  You're a really great guy, but I'm married, so let's just be friends, okay?\\"  I could not put this book down. I actually finished it in less than 24 hours, which I do not have time to do.  I have a 2 year-old boy.  But I couldn't stop reading it, so I stayed up until 2am.  It was just pure fun, and actually funny as well.  I'm still detoxing from having that much fun end so soon.  Now I'm champing at the bit to watch the A&E Pride and Prejudice again.  In fact, I'm really wanting to read the book once again as well.  Loved it!
B000I0RNV6|5.0|This was not only a spectacular movie, but also a spectacular package.  It has two discs, one with the original movie as seen in theaters, and one with the extended directors cut, which adds on about 45 minutes, and also explains a lot of the plot.  Good price, good extra features...if you like this movie already, this package is a must have (especially if you have never seen the director's cut before).
B000MR9D5E|5.0|informative and very educational.  Everyone should have a set of these to share with families and friends.
B000F9RB9Y|3.0|Classic movie which is very enjoyable.  My only concern is that I really don't see any real viewing improvement in the Blu-Ray version over the standard DVD.  Perhaps this is due to the fact that much of the film occurs in relative darkness so it appears a bit grainy.  Probably not worth the extra expense to buy Blu-Ray over the standard DVD.
B000VBJEEG|5.0|My wife thinks its the best Pixar film yet, and I have a hard time to disagree with her, although I still hold on to the Incredibles.  Every time Pixar makes a movie you know its gonna be a great and safe treat for the entire family.  Let me tell you that Micky may be the most powerful rodent at Disney, but look out there is a rat chasing him, and he may just catch him.  Brad Bird made it so that even those whom hate rats the most will love this one, and most importantly want to invite him to your kitchen.
B0010Z32OA|5.0|I actually paid full price -- twice, to watch this movie.  The first time I didn't know what to expect, but was pleasantly surprised.  Robert DeNiro is in a very different role, and pulls it off with great hilarity.  I've always been a fan of Claire Danes, and was not disappointed.  Michelle Pfeiffer was quite excellent, and looks great to boot.  I was never a big fan of hers, but this made me one.    After seeing it the first time, and knowing it has a happy ending, I went to see it again.  I enjoyed it even more the second time, and have been waiting for the video for quite some time.    I too am disappointed it didn't do so great at the movie theatre, but believe it will become a classic as did the Princess Bride.    Thoroughly enjoyed the movie, and think pre-teens (if appropriate) should see this move to get an understanding of what 'love' is all about.  Its not about what you 'get' or what you 'give', but that you just enjoy being together and you don't have to prove anything.      Take a chance and watch it, I think you'll be pleasantly surprised.    .
B00000G3AZ|5.0|I've watched this movie at least 10 times since I purchased it! It is such a cute show! If you like movies based on Jane Austen's novels, you'll love this one!
B00006CXSS|5.0|I'm a big fan of the genre in general and this is the best. The stories, character development and special effects are perfect.
B000K7VHQE|1.0|I bought this movie b/c I was down and out and needed a pick me up.  After watching it I was disgusted b/c of the money wasted, time wasted and as my sister said to me,\\"You owe me for the power that it cost me to play it\\"!
B000MRAAJM|4.0|very educational and entertaining if you like nature stuff.  Blue ray was not that more impressive than upscaled version at least from my POV. Must have in collection.
B00028HBKM|1.0|Mel Gibson's movies often involve torture, usually of Mel himself. It's pointless to speculate on the source of Gibson's self-loathing and contempt, but being raised as a fundamentalist, anti-Semitic catholic may have something to do with it. Mel's psychopathology is taken to its ultimate extreme in this lengthy, plotless, graphic depiction of torture. There is no plot, no spirituality, no message, just an innocent man being flayed. It is blatant Sadean voyeurism using a mask of religion to conceal the fact that its creator is sick, sick sick. It is revealing that this movie was so popular in a country that would elect another sick, ignorant fundamentalist for its President.
B00004YRQA|3.0|Must have if you got a ps2. pricey for 8mb card if one considers the age of the technology.
B000YA82F6|4.0|Quirky teen Juno MacGuff is pregnant, and decides to give her child up for adoption. Over the course of her nine month term she learns about the nature of love in many different guises, and ultimately, discovers her own means of happiness.    This movie is full of fantastic actors giving excellent performances: Michael Cera proves he can play it sincere and straight after being hilarious in \\"Superbad\\",  Jason Bateman is a human and believable unhappy husband to Jennifer Garner's needy, driven wife, Allison Janney is excellent (as usual), and J.K. Simmons proves he's capable of much more depth and pathos than \\"Spiderman\\" would have you believe. But it's Ellen Page as the titular Juno that creates and maintains the balance of bizarre characters in this film: she's a remarkable actress giving an outstanding performance in this beautiful, offbeat film.    Director Jason Reitman proves to be the perfect match for writer Diablo Cody's sensitive, fluid script, and \\"Juno\\" moves at an easy, relaxed pace - but it never sinks into boring or over-long. The dialogue is so Teen and so Now that it wouldn't be out of place annoying intelligent people in \\"Not Another American Pie Slasher With Beer\\" type movie, but here, thanks to the skill of all involved in \\"Juno\\"'s production, it simply comes across as believable and real.     Without describing the plot to you, there's not much else to say about \\"Juno\\": other than to recommend you go and see it - this is a cut above most coming-of-age tales. It's bittersweet, warm, literate and thoroughly worthwhile. Highly recommended.
B000Q6GX5Y|4.0|Entertaining show as I fancy the genre. The blue ray was not as impressive as I had hoped -I believe in part because of the movie film format.  Regular DVD upscaled would have been probably equivalent and you may save a few $$
B000TGJ8CQ|1.0|Second-rate Las Vegas lounge magician Chris Johnson (Cage) has a little precognitive secret: he can see events up to two minutes in the future. Some generic nonamerican (of course!) terrorists have kidnapped a nuclear device and will blow things up with it (hey, they're terrorists with a bomb, right? What else would they do?!) unless joyless FBI bigwig Agent Ferris (Moore) can force Chris to use his gift to stop les bad guys. Oh, and there's some pretty female called Liz (Biel) in there too, just for good measure.    This is a terribly boring, poorly-made movie. There's no reason or setup for the bad guys, or their theft of the bomb, no explanation whatsoever behind Chris Johnson's prowess in physical combat and no chemistry at all from any one of the principal actors. The standards of dialogue and direction present in \\"Next\\" are so below par that, essentially, it feels like there's a good thirty minutes of plot missing - and a bad thirty minutes too many of Nicolas Cage dashing about being Nicolas Cage.     Perhaps I missed part of this movie (even though I watched it all) or perhaps it's a sequel to something better, some other film with the missing pieces to this (boring, frustrating) puzzle? But when talented actors such as Moore, Biel and yes, even Cage, are paraded so lazily in front of the audience with little or no substance behind their characters and a very sketchy plot, not even Star Quality or these A-List names can compensate for the lack of a decent basic plot.    Gimmicky and base, this film isn't anywhere near as entertaining as the so-so National Treasure series. Don't bother with this one.
B0000VAFO0|4.0|I enjoy the esthetics of the show along including the action.  Should have got the blue ray version.
B000VWYJ86|4.0|This product arrived on time for me to put in my Son's stocking for Christmas, and he loved it.
B000VWYJ86|4.0|Good value and speedy service from amazon.  I got all 3 in the series. Not many sequels are as good as the first. Trailers/extras were minimal.
B000WC3AJE|1.0|Very dissapointed in Warner Home Video, this collection, especially Part 111, which has a wonderful John Mauceri overture, just looks, and sounds flat. I own the laser disc box set, and I use it as a reference, the quality and dynamic fidelity of the above stated overture, is nothing short of spectacular, the video quality is first rate. Having bought the previously released dvd box set, mainly for the anamorphic enhancment of segments that apply, this transfer offers no improvement on video, perhaps even less,and the sound, well just imagine putting on a pair of ear muffs. To sum up, save your money.
B000VAPZM2|4.0|Got this for the kids.  Overlooked? the version was full screen and not widescreen. OTW good kid material. Its always playing on weekends.
B000641Z90|4.0|Phil has tremendous energy and he shares it with the audience.  This is fun feel good music.
B000UR9T8C|3.0|I wanted to complete the series. From my POV not as good as 2nd but graphics are quite impressive. I don't think the viewing experience would have been better on the blueray format and price differential.
0316286850|5.0|This book, like Kevin Aucoin's second book, Face Forward, is fantastic.  Well written, the pictures are great.  The step by steps are easy to follow, the layout is beautiful.  The makeup looks are different from each other and interesting.  Highly recommend, for both information and amusement.
0380729407|5.0|Thirty-five years after its initial release, this magical and mesmerizing story still carries a punch. The opening pages are more like a thriller where you know something is out there...waiting. You can hear it; you can feel it getting closer. And it's not going to be pleasant.<br /><br />You follow a pair of young boys on their pre-Halloween adventure until you realize there is a lot more at stake than just going to the carnival. And the father of one of the boys, a meek and beaten down man, has a great decision to make. Others in the town face a temptation that could and does change each person's life.<br /><br />A small town story with universal truths about life and what you make of it. This is a true masterpiece using Bradbury's poetic phrasing and the hypnotic pictures he paints with words.<br /><br />Read it again.
072325804X|5.0|[[ASIN:072325804X Beatrix Potter Complete Tales R/I]]    I ordered this book for my granddaughter's first birthday. It arrived sooner than promised, in perfect condition, complete with the gorgeous illustrations, by Potter,which graced the first printing. My conscious decision is to provide her with the basis of a fabulous library. To this end I have been purchasing the true classics of children's literature. This is just one of the books I have so far given her. Her mother, my daughter, is putting them aside until the child is old enough to handle them. By that time I hope to have supplied on the order of 50 beautiful classic hardbound books for her enjoyment.   A child who reads owns the world.
B00005JPXY|5.0|After witnessing (and pondering and questioning over) an insane teaser trailer before summer's \\"Transformers,\\" and then going on film boards and searching for any information, I've been slightly hooked on \\"Cloverfield\\". I'm a fan of J.J. Abrams' work (mostly \\"Lost\\"), love creature-features, and most of all, mystery surrounding films. Never before have I seen such a better marketing job than \\"Cloverfield\\". Everyone was left in the open, making up their own ideas for what exactly was destroying New York City, where it came from, and most importantly, what it looked like. In other words, the hype was huge for this film and going into it, I knew that it just couldn't meet my expectations. Well, it did just that and possibly exceeded them.    The film opens in New York City, where a goodbye-party is being held for Rob (Michael-Stahl David), whose leaving the country for a job in Japan. At the party, his best friend, Hud (T.J. Miller) is given the task of filming the entire get-together. Throughout his \\"documenting\\", we observe Rob's brother, Jason (Mike Vogel) and his girlfriend, Lily (Jessica Ford) flirting and being cute with each other, Hud's crush on a girl named Marlena (Lizzy Caplan), and finally, Rob's dilemma with his best friend, Beth (Odette Yustman), who he recently just slept with and has feelings for (which he hasn't told her about, of course). Anyway, Beth and Rob get into an argument and she leaves the party in a hurry. As Rob is talking about his relationship with her, the party is interrupted by what seems like an earthquake. The party-goers rush to the streets only to see the decapitated head of the Statue of Liberty land in the streets. From this point on, we know that whatever caused the earthquake is no earthquake and whatever it is, it's big and not of this world. The army comes in to evacuate, but Beth leaves a message on Rob's phone, telling her that she's in trouble and needs help. With Hud, Marlena, Lily, and his brother in tow, Rob decides to head towards her apartment, away from safety and right into the path of the monster's destruction.    The plot is fairly simple and not entirely original. A monster attacks New York City, while people try to outrun and live throughout the destruction around them. The core of the film though is not exactly the monster, but more the love story between Rob and Beth. It's not shown in a melodramatic, sappy way and there's not much dialog between the two characters, but it keeps the film together (I mean, if there wasn't a connection between the two, Rob wouldn't go into the city and there would be no movie). Rob is a person that many guys can relate to (wants to tell his feelings to the girl he's always liked) and that makes him even more believable and the audience can understand his actions because of this. Since their relationship is strong, the film becomes even more intense as you want to see both of them and Rob's friends make it through the ordeal.    Speaking of Rob and his friends, they are played by mostly unknown actors, which also helps the film. Not one actor is really well known save for Mike Vogel (\\"Poseidon\\", \\"Texas Chainsaw Massacre\\" remake) and that really helped me identify more with who they were as characters in the film instead of who was playing them. Michael Stahl-David does a great job as Rob and you feel for him as his friends begin to die even while he's still determined to save Beth. The best actor in the film though is definitely T.J. Miller. He brings a much needed amount of comic relief as the film's camera-man, but also layers of drama that I didn't expect to see from him (one scene of his, in particular, was quite heartbreaking). The rest of the cast do a fine job and were all believable, great in their roles, and you didn't want them to die.    Another issue to bring up about the movie is how it's filmed. It's all done with a video camera that someone's dad would use to film his son's baseball game. At first, this can be nauseating (theparty scene), but you get used to it and it really attributes to the greatness of the film. By shooting it in this style, everything feels real (even if it is CGI), because it's shown in a perspective that everyday people have experienced. Also, since the film is from one view, the audience is on the ride with these people and you follow them through the streets, tunnels, buildings, and more, as the creature attacks them and others. Two scenes, in particular, are intense, mainly because of the use of the camera. One takes place in a subway tunnel with something else besides the main creature (I'll get to this later) and the other, in the streets, as the group tries to run to safety, the creature closes in on them, crushing everything in its path. As much as I was apprehensive about the filming style, I'm happy to say that it makes the film even better than it is and gives it a mood that no other creature feature will be able to imitate.    Finally, the main reason most people will see this movie is for the monster and let me say, it does not disappoint. I'm not going to give away much about what it looks like, but all I'm going to say is that it's huge, walks like a bat would, eats people, and little creatures climb off its body. These little creatures are the ones that make their presence known in the subway scene (mentioned above). These things are fast, vicious, and their bite leaves a not-so-pretty consequence. The monster definitely lived up to the hype for me and its little minions just added to the greatness about it.    Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. The acting was top-notch, the filming style was unique and original, the special effects were amazing, the story was simple, but effective, and finally, the monster was amazingly done. As much as I loved the movie, I have a feeling that I'll never get the impact I did when I first watched it. I may be wrong though. After all, I didn't think the movie would live up to my expectations and I was wrong about that. It's not a classic by any means, but it gives you exactly what you came to the theaters for - a scary, intense, thrilling ride. And a darn good one at that.
B000K15VSA|5.0|[[ASIN:B000K15VSA Blade Runner (Five-Disc Ultimate Collector's Edition)]]    Blade Runner has been one of my favorite movies since its release, so my children grew up watching it often (I also loved the book on which the movie was based \\"Do Androids Dream of Electronic Sheep?\\". When my son was getting married last August he and his bride, both with MFAs in writing, put the newly released collectors edition 5 diisc set at the very top of their wish-list. I had to give it, of course. They are thrilled with the discs and have thanked me profusely. Maybe they will see this review and give me the same set for my birthday <hint hint>
B000W07EKW|5.0|This collection is amazing. For all three movies, I have to say, \\"WOW!!!\\" This has been by far the best action and suspense movies I have seen. Each movie keeps you on the edge of your seat, from start to finish.
0743486285|5.0|This book is amazing! It's nice to read about all the ups and downs of one of my favorite Rockstars!!!
B00079FUI6|5.0|Really good. The product came in well packaged and on time. Every DVD work well, as well. I recommend it to anyone.
B00003CX95|4.0|Mel Gibson did a pretty good in this epic movie. I love these long, over done movies with big battle scenes. This movie had some of the most impressive battles in the history of film. The acting was very good but a little corny and sappy in alot of places. Still a very good film if you like long, epic war movies. Awesome battle scenes.
B000WC3AGM|5.0|I received my boxset a couple dayts before I thought I would, which was a very nice surprise! It was in perfect condition and my girlfriend loved it when she opened it Christmas morning! :)
B0002EQ7EC|5.0|This is simply the best Paul Simon recording. The true masterpiece. The songs. The musicianship. The emotions. The depth and layers of production. All incomparable.    It is one of the best collections of \\"popular\\" compositions you can play on a sound system. It goes beyond categorizations.     It never gets old, nothing is artificial, its just solid as a rock.
0439882826|5.0|I bought this book for a friend who is a real star wars fan.  And a real ladies man too.  I know, seems totally impossible and now maybe I've lost all credibility with my review.  But here goes:<br /><br />This book is amazing.  Trust me.  If you want to be surprised by this work of art, stop reading HERE.<br /><br />Ok, you are still reading, so that means you are ok if I spoil the three surprises I found waiting for us in this book:<br /><br />1.  Each page has not ONE giant pop up, but MANY!  Five or so.  That's a LOT of pop ups!  It can take you many minutes per page to pop stuff up and read the little snippets of info.  GREAT!<br /><br />2.  Some pop ups have pop ups INSIDE them!  We didn't even notice that till the second time through!  Pop-ups INSIDE pop-ups!?  That's just CRAZY!<br /><br />3.  Ok here is the real spoiler.  Turn back now if you are already convinced.  Still here?  Ok, here it is: On the last page, two of the smaller pop ups have Luke and Darth Vader in them, with light-sabers drawn. But they weren't colored right.  They were both clear!  I said to my learned Star Wars friend, \\"why aren't their light sabers blue and red?\\" He said, \\"I don't know, that IS odd.\\"  Then he said \\"wait hold on a second.\\"  He turns the book over and there is a piece of tape on the back of the book.  He pulls the tape off, turns the book over and we open to the last page again and pop up Luke and Darth.  And BEHOLD!  Their sabers GLOWED!  GLOWED!  Awesome.<br /><br />So tons of popups, popups within popups and glowing light-sabers!?  This is a must have for any hardcore Star Wars fan.
B000AP04OM|5.0|It is unreal that a movie could be so successful without using the F word every 30 seconds and I don't believe I heard a word as strong as darn. No profanity, no sex and yet such a beautiful undertaking and the children of today love the movie just as much as yesteryears. Why can't the film makers of today understand this?? This is a must have.
B000W07EKW|5.0|I bought this for my husband for Christmas. He's a huge fan of the Jason Bourne series.  He was thrilled to get this.  The packaging makes it even more fun.  Good quality box and TONS of bonus features that make it well worth it.  Great price too for all three movies.
B000VWYJ86|3.0|I enjoyed this story and the acting was good enough not to detract from the storyline. The action scenes are very hard to truly enjoy since the director would zoom in for a close-up making it impossible to see what was going on.  Combine the inappropriate close-ups with the \\"fad\\" of shaky cameras and I'm really glad I did not pay full price for the DVD.  It also reinforces why I don't see movies in theatres anymore.  This director is now on my list of not worth the money movies.
B00008MLSH|3.0|She's not a true coloratura, at least not a very good one.  I have and love her \\"sempre libera\\" album.  Her mad scene from Lucia (though she slides to the 1st top note) made me involuntarily think the word \\"magnificent!\\".  But in this album (and on reflection, the other one too), she's just a soprano.  A very good one, but she's no Tetrazzini or Mesple or Sutherland or Jo.  She belongs in Verdi, not in Donizetti.  On the other hand, if all you want is good straight singing (Rosa Ponselle), and don't care about the ornamentation and pyrotechnics, you will probably like this album.  I was disappointed.
B0002F6AH0|5.0|Several years ago I watched this series on TV and I believe it is the best documentary on World War II ever produced.  It is even better on the DVD Disk in that the commentary about all the research that went into producing this great piece of history; and, the people that did it.  I believe that this documentary should be every school in the nation.  I am 68 years old and I think that today's schools are not covering history in the classes as they should--this documentary certainly explains how the war came about, what happen during the war, the countries involved, and the conclusion of the war.  This work is in my opinion the finest documentary on World War II.    Karl M Andrews
B0009Q0F5U|4.0|It was nice to hear the familiar sounds from the show but I was disappointed a little.  I don't think the songs were as well rounded as I wanted.  In any case, I use it for meditation with only mild irritation.
B000YXMMAE|5.0|I've been listening to Radiohead for years, and have all of their  albums. This album, in my opinion, sort of combines all of their best  ideas and sounds from the past, into one absolutely incredible album.   If your even a casual Radiohead you must check this CD out, its that  good. There is honestly not one bad track,  and it grows on you the  more you listen to it.  It has 2 of their best faster paced songs ever,  Bodysnatchers and Jigsaw Falling Into Place.  The latter is a song  you could dance with a girl to,  probably the only Radiohead song  of its type.  5 stars easily,  and one of the best rock releases   period in recent memory.
0393327655|5.0|This is a fantastic read.  I am buying more copies as gifts for those I know will appreciate the quality of writing and focus.  I applaud the author for having the guts to make such needed arguments against brainless following.  I also love his use of English in such eloquent writing.
B000Y2WAKM|4.0|Eels are one of my favorite bands, and as with most greatest hits deals, fans can quibble about why this song was left off or this song included.  This is a decent collection of the band/man's best work, although I'd recommend playing the disc on shuffle.  The songs are sequenced in order of their release so you start with the oldest material and work to the newest.  Shuffle allows you to get a better mix of the band's work.  After you start with \\"Meet The Eels\\" hit the rest of the catalog...it's worth it:)
0714834491|3.0|the book is big, heavy and has a confusing layout(page numbers refer to spreads, not individual pages) Some pages are printed with black type on darkblue or gray making them almost unreadable (including the index which also has numbers smaller than most eye charts.) There is no index and little way to get back to something you found before without post-its. Yet for all its drawbacks, it's a fascinating compendium of design ideas - ideas in general. Great price for this much imagery. And if one has even a bit of leisure to peruse books for what just might pop out, this would be a good one to have.
B000N3SU2E|5.0|First of all, this film is a great film! It's one of the best films I've seen in some time. If the right-wing nihilists weren't out in full force, do you think anyone would have a problem obeying the international laws that only United States refuses to implement? You heard me right, and you heard Al Gore right, and this is what he said in my own words: the reason America won't get off its collective butts to install laws that recognize the existence of Global Warming is because of China. That's right: China.<br /><br />Okay, here's a \\"weed whacker\\" if I ever saw one. I'm going to quote someone else's review from here at Amazon called \\"The Epitome of Hypocracy.\\" (I think the writer meant \\"hypocrisy\\" instead of \\"hypocracy.\\") The article with that name is correctly labeled, sans misspelling, but the epitome of hypocrisy belongs to that reviewer, and not the person on whom she has laid her blame. She calls herself \\"Stealth Kitten\\" Isn't that ironic! She's a clumsy writer. I quote her statements here:<br /><br />QUOTE--\\"Disclosure: Before you look at the one star review and your emotional belief system starts categorizing me as a Republican or a Bush supporter I would like to disclose that I despise both the republican and democratic parties which are in reality now two agents of the same agenda.\\"<br /><br />I know she'll be getting to her point soon; alas, I must wait.<br /><br />QUOTE--\\"And I'm not here to debate whether or not global warming is a real phenomenon. I'm also a former employee of the EPA [Environmental Protection Agency].\\"<br /><br />Okay, so if she's not going to debate it, I guess that's because she agrees with it. As an EPA employee, she'd be able to contest Al Gore's argument IF global warming does not exist.<br /><br />QUOTE--\\"That being said, the idea that Al Gore (or any american president) is an environmentalist is patently absurd.\\"<br /><br />Did this lady watch the same film I did? I just saw Al Gore preaching for TWO HOURS about the environment. Who's she tryin' to kid? He had scientific data, charts, and films.<br /><br />QUOTE--\\"Am I the only person who remembers that it was the Clinton administration that engineered the policy of the polution credits allowing companies who are polluters to actually pollute more?\\"<br /><br />WHAT DOES THAT HAVE TO DO WITH IT? Okay, so this complaint has no bearing on the film, but this lady wants people to talk about the credits of the Kyoto Protocol? Lady, if you're complaining about the credit system, you've missed the boat.<br /><br />QUOTE--\\"Like Bush and Cheney, Clinton and Gore manipulate and undermine the enviromentalist cause every chance they get.\\"<br /><br />Trite!<br /><br />QUOTE--\\"LOOK AT THE CAR AL GORE IS DRIVING IN THE FILM. Uhhh....\\"<br /><br />Over 30% of the world's greenhouse gases are emitted by the United States, but this woman is worried about which car Al Gore drives! Hey lady, can you say ICE AGE?<br /><br />QUOTE--\\"It was the Clinton administration that made it legal to POISON U.S. CITIZENS by putting carcinogens in their food. Don't believe me? Look up the Delaney clause and The Food Quality Protection Act sometime.\\"<br /><br />Irrelevant. She hasn't presented an argument without the trivial blame game! Is she going to talk about the content of the film today?<br /><br />QUOTE--\\"The reality of CO2 emissions is that we could operate completely of of eco-friendly energy using 1920's TECHNOLOGY if there was not a political conspiracy in place in order to prevent that from happening. Electric cars, windmills, and especially hydro-electric power have been here for a hundred years. Hydro electric power is and always has been the most efficient, most enviromentally friendly way to to produce electricity... and anyone who tells you otherwise is probably putting out disinformation on behalf of a corporation or intelligence agency. A few more dams the size of hoover and niagra could easily power north america and we could certainly have electric cars.\\"<br /><br />I think she's saying that global warming does exist, and she agrees that people should do something about it. Didn't Al Gore say this?<br /><br />QUOTE--\\"The real agenda here is that Al Gore's handlers have ordered him to use the environmentalist cause to bring about world socialist government which is what the agenda of people like Bush and Gore has been for a long time.\\"<br /><br />WHAT A FRUITCAKE! She's confused! This is outright presumptuous slander. Notice how she mixes opinions in with her \\"facts.\\" And, does anyone think Bush is attempting to \\"bring about world socialist government?\\" NO, THEY DON'T! She's arguing from a figment of her imagination, but contrary to her earlier argument, this one says that Gore IS BEING an environmentalist!<br /><br />QUOTE--\\"Wake up kids. If you want a real documentary watch 9/11 mysteries or Terror Storm.\\"<br /><br />Boy, that is the worst review of this film I've read so far. She doesn't mention anything in the film, except that Al Gore starred in it. What was she trying to say anyway? It sounded like confusion and frustration. Lady, you're a nut!<br /><br />What's worse is that a few nut bags deny every politician who try to do a job and provide a basic service to the American people. There are TWO definitions to the word democracy, the OTHER ONE is REPRESENTATIVE GOVERNMENT, of which we have little-to-none. Al Gore knows what he believes and what he's fighting for is good to Americans. While the Americans are sitting on their collective butts, the rest of the world has adopted the Kyoto Protocol. Why not the Americans?<br /><br />Because, CHINA. Or, because CREDITS. I'd like someone to explain to me what China has to do with whether or not America adopts the Kyoto Protocol! I mean, if America is the greatest, most \\"moral-est\\" country in the world, why does it take A CONVENIENT STANCE? Because, then America can ignore the problem? Of course, this to completely ignore the facts of the movie telling people that China is WAAAAAAY ahead of the United States in its greenhouse-gas emission standards!<br /><br />Those are great morals, America! At this rate, the world will have another Ice Age much sooner. What do you want, a pat on the back too?<br /><br />America is in denial of the change the world needs.<br /><br />If you're saying this is socialism, then you're a retard.<br /><br />Hey, is saving lives socialism too?say this?

In fact, the Dust concept was a great way to think about the Universe,   dark matter and a lot of higher order physics.     A great read for both adults and kids alike.    Kcail
B000A59PMO|5.0|This show is so smart, funny, and entertaining, I wonder how it ever got canceled. I guess the general public isn't smart enough for Veronica Mars. They prefer empty plots like those of Desperate Housewives. How is that show still on? If you haven't seen the V.M. series, and are craving some good TV 'cause of the writer's strike, YOU MUST BUY THIS SET!!! You won't regret it!
B000R7HY0K|5.0|Come on. If you have to read this review to watch Death Proof in the Grindhouse series you really need to check yourself, but at any rate, Death Proof was the best in the Grindhouse series.  The extended version or not, it was a great movie.  Although I wish they would have kept the Infamous Trailers that was a Must See at the Movie Theater, I mean they even gave two trailers for Planet Terror, but all in all it was a Fun Movie and the Acting was Superb. Even the Soundtrack was EXCELLENT!  Keep this in your DVD Library.

B00006FDCD|4.0|My girlfriend (now wife) and I watched this when it premiered in 1990.  It was a fun scare. I especially liked the relationship between the kids on the first night, even more than the 'scare' factor.    In the last few months we got the DVD and watched it again.  It was still fun (and now even nostalgic).      Seeing the movie again prompted me to finally read the book, which is absolutely phenomenal.  It is clear that trying to capture the novel in a two-night miniseries would be impossible.  It's a tribute to the cast and crew that they got as close as they did.    (On a side note, I believe Pennywise the Clown has been reverse typecast, and can only be played by Tim Curry.   Anyone wishing to try their hand at another attempt to film the novel may do well to enlist Mr. Curry ASAP!)    A jewel of the DVD is the commentary track, especially the trio of John Ritter, Tim Reid, and Dennis Christopher, who shared many humorous memories.  I began wishing *I* had been in the movie!  (Hard to believe that Mr. Ritter would be gone a year or two after recording the commentary.)  It was funny to note that some of the stars shared some of the same criticisms of this adaptation as some of the reviewers.    Wish list for the 20th anniversary edition in 2010:  commentary from all the surviving cast members, 'child' and 'adult', plus a making-of featurette.  And maybe package it with an Pennywise orange pom-pom or a balloon.

B000VNMMR0|5.0|Who would have thought nearly 20 years ago we would still be thrilled with the adventures of New York police detective John McClane? And yet here I sit typing about the latest thrill ride featuring the character portrayed excellently by Bruce Willis as he battles the newest form of terrorism, cyber terrorists.<br /><br />Computer whiz Thomas Gabriel (Timothy Oliphant) has assembled pieces of a master planned puzzle by putting to use information garnered via internet and computer hacker geniuses. Unbeknownst to each, they are a giving him the tools needed to take down the country and increase his bank account at the same time. The best way to cover his tracks is to eliminate each one, which he does.<br /><br />Enter McClane who has been asked to pick up one of these hackers, Matthew Farrell (Justin Long), for the FBI for questioning when a hack on their systems is discovered. A normal pick up turns ugly when mercenaries show to make sure that Farrell never gets a chance to talk to the Feds. One raging gun battle later and McClane and Farrell are on the road and looking for help.<br /><br />Gabriel launches his attack in the midst of Farrell's being taken into custody, cutting into the traffic control system of Washington, D.C. and then into the entire broadcasting network system to create hysteria across the country. Locating McClane and Farrell, he dispatches a helicopter as well as rerouting traffic while the pair is in a tunnel. What follows is one fantastic assemblage of stunt coordination and special effects to make your adrenaline pump faster than a tossed car.<br /><br />As the movie progresses, the duo attempt to find out exactly what it was that Farrell helped assemble with his one small part. Attacks on the power system that controls the entire east coast, a computer area that holds more knowledge than it should and the kidnapping of McClane's college aged daughter Lucy (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) turn things personal. Is there any doubt that a final face off between McClane and Gabriel will take place?<br /><br />This movie is not to be believed. No one could take the physical punishment that McClane does. No one can jump from an out of control jet onto a crumbling bridge and expect to survive. No one could dodge a car rolling through the air. And yet the answer is in front of you all the time...WHO CARES? This movie is not about actual physics or honest solutions to national problems. This movie is a roller coaster ride that gets the blood pumping, that makes you root for the good guy and that is nothing more than pure fun filled entertainment.<br /><br />The actors do their best between performing and being replaced by stuntmen when the danger ensues. Along with these stunt men and special effects people, they make this one fun flick to watch. Probably not suited for the youngest members of your house, but for everyone else, this movie is a blast and one worth adding to your collection.ll take place?    This movie is not to be believed.

B000W07EKW|4.0|In 2002, we were made privy to the world of Jason Bourne (Matt Damon), a man with no memory who found he had a knack for all things espionage. As he tried to find himself, he fell in love and ended with the woman of his non-existent dreams.<br /><br />In 2004, Bourne returned and his love was killed before his eyes. It seems someone framed him for a theft and the CIA is out to get him once and for all. Having warned them he would retaliate, he fulfills his promise.<br /><br />Now it's 2007 and there is more to the story of Jason Bourne, aka David Webb. Bourne is on the trail of the CIA still, hoping to find out more about his past and why he can't remember a thing.<br /><br />When Bourne resurfaces and contacts a news reporter who may have information for him, the reporter is killed and the hunt for Bourne begins anew. But one thing that these CIA officials seem to never learn is that just who is hunting who is a question that should have been asked long ago.<br /><br />The head of the CIA (Scott Glenn) brings in NSA member Noah Vossen (David Strathairn) and Pam Landy (Joan Allen) to use the full resources on hand to find Bourne. At the same time, they are trying to track down the link that contacted the reporter. An attempt to tie up what they consider loose ends results in more death and more reason for Bourne to tie up loose ends of his own. A solution needs to be found and Bourne will find it.<br /><br />Damon does an awesome job of making the difficult seem easy. The fight sequences are top of the line, fast moving and totally believable. His acting comes through as well, never resorting to action and nothing else. You believe that his is a troubled mind that will pull out all the stops to solve the mystery.<br /><br />Now, for fans of the series of films there is a must have on sale. THE JASON BOURNE COLLECTION is a box set with perks galore. Not only that, they've gone creative on the packaging, making the box look like a security box from a bank, a crucial element to the story.<br /><br />All three films are included in the set, all done to look as sharp and clear as possible. As well as the films and their own special features, there is another disc packaged in what appears to be a passport. This disc contains features about author Robert Ludlum, the creation of the Bourne character, a look at the success of the series and original trailers for all three films.<br /><br />For thriller fans, for spy fans, for Ludlum fans and especially for Bourne fans, this is the set that they'll want to see under their Christmas tree. And for all that you get, it's well worth the expense. Bourne is back in a big way.included in the set, all done to look as sharp and clear as possible.

It should be a must-buy for those who like classical piano, space/New Age music or (as I believe it was described somewhere) \\"acid jazz\\".

B000VNMMQG|4.0|Many believe that the stories conceived by writers offer compelling tales that take us on journeys unimagined. There is some truth in this idea. But at the same time, there are journey's that men have taken in the past that offer themselves to compelling tales as well, offering more drama than imaginable. Such is the story of William Wilberforce.<br /><br />Wilberforce (Ioan Gruffudd) was a 19th century politician whose views in Parliament were a bit unconventional for the times. As the tale beings, William has just lost his greatest political battle, an attempt to abolish the slave trade in the whole of the British kingdom. Succumbing to ill health, he has retreated to his cousin's home to recuperate. Along the way his cousin (and his wife) introduce William to a young woman who has similar viewpoints to his and who has been a staunch supporter of his beliefs. It is through their short courtship that William tells her the story of how he came to this point in his life.<br /><br />As his political career was beginning, Wilberforce hit a snag in the road. He was touched with a profound belief in God and considered a life as a minister turning his back on politics altogether. His friendship with one time classmate William Pitt the Younger (Benedict Cumberbatch) leads Pitt to coerce Wilberforce to learn more about the slave trade. Meeting in secret with those who have strived to have the cruelty of slavery brought into the public eye, Wilberforce is overcome with a belief that not only is it wrong but that it must be stopped.<br /><br />At one point in the story, The Duke Of Clarence (Toby Jones) offers to put up one of his slaves to offset a bet during a card game with Wilberforce. While he turns down the offer, he is encouraged by his friend to sing for fellow members of Parliament in the club where the game was taking place. The song he chooses is \\"Amazing Grace\\" which was written by a man Wilberforce is familiar with, an ex-sea captain named John Newton (Albert Finney) who has since retired and who wrote the song while overpowered with grief for the atrocities he had seen with the slaves.<br /><br />The story continues, showing the ups and downs of politics in the 19th century and the battles that Wilberforce and his followers went through in their attempts to change a system in place for many years, an economic whirlwind that brought money into the country but at what cost. It is the drama of mans inhumanity to man and one mans attempt to change what is accepted and make it unacceptable.<br /><br />Gruffudd does a wonderful job as Wilberforce, making him not only a noble person to look up to but a human one as well. The character is filled with passion for his beliefs and Gruffudd brings this out in each and every scene. The supporting cast is equally adept at bringing the story off of the pages of history and making it an inviting trip into history that many are unaware of.<br /><br />The song \\"Amazing Grace\\" may be only a starting point for many, bringing them round to the truth behind it. But the movie \\"Amazing Grace\\", while touching on a depressing subject, is an uplifting tale of a man who changed history for the better.

B000I5XOVE|3.0|Not much difference between standard DVD and Blu Ray version of this movie.

B00005JODK|5.0|We all eagerly awaited the opening of \\"Hairspray\\" the movie - the 2007 version, with John Travolta, Michelle Pfeiffer, et al. The trailers made it look awesome, and our son was very eager to see it. So I went on my own to watch it and see if it would be appropriate for him, and I am so glad that I did, as this is not a movie that he will be seeing until he is a bit older, or we see it at home so that we can either skip some of the scenes, or at least discuss them with him first.<br /><br />For example, in the very opening number - while the main character Tracy is on her way to school in the morning - we encounter a flasher who exposes himself to some ladies on the sidewalk, and a drunk in a bar who passes out and falls off his stool (first thing in the morning, no less)! The fact that the flasher and the drunk are made light of - played for laughs - doesn't really make it any better for children to see, even though the scenes may be funny for older teens and adults.<br /><br />There is also a scene where Tracy's mother (played by John Travolta - and he does a fabulous job!) is coaxed out of the house - she hasn't left the house in years - to see the whole new world outside - and as she is walking down the sidewalk, she glances into the window of a local establishment, and exclaims \\"It's so elegant!\\" - and then the camera pans to the object of her enchantment - several very pregnant women sitting at a bar smoking and drinking up a storm. Now, clearly this is intended as lampooning, and could in fact be a teaching moment for some kids, but not a scene we would have wanted our child to see without knowing about it first.<br /><br />Michelle Pfeiffer's character is a thoroughly despicable vamp, who will do anything for her daughter to win the local dance competition - just as she did anything herself, years earlier, to win the Miss Baltimore pageant, including, she tells the audience, \\"I screwed all the judges.\\" There is also a scene where she attempts to seduce Tracy's father (Christopher Walken) - it's over the top, but also quite pointed.<br /><br />The obligatory potty humour actually follows the attempted seduction scene, as Tracy's father, forced to sleep out of the house, sleeps downstairs in the joke and gag shop he owns - and with nothing else soft to sleep on, fashions a mattress out of dozens of inflated whoopie cushions.<br /><br />The theme which runs throughout the movie - and indeed it does it very well - is racial segregation and the move for integration. While it's a running theme, it is perhaps most striking and jarring not in the \\"march\\" scene, as you might think - but in a scene where there is a dance at the high school. It was very jarring, even as an adult, to see a gym full of teens happily dancing - with a thick rope down the middle of the gym, and all the white kids dancing on one side of the rope, and all the black kids dancing on the other.<br /><br />In fact, for these scenes, this is a great movie to lead to discussions about integration - one of the few I've seen where it's very evident, but not with in-your-face violent scenes - instead showing it as a day-to-day fact of life to be dealt with, and abolished.<br /><br />So don't get me wrong - this was a fantastic movie, and I can't wait until our son is old enough to see it. But personally I wouldn't take a child under the age of, say, 12 or 13 to see it. Not unless you want them asking \\"Mommy, what does 'screwing all the judges' mean? And why did that man hold open his coat at those ladies, and the other man fall down?\\"<br /><br />By the way, this movie provided me with what has to be one of my favourite movie lines of the year - when Queen Latifah's character advises her son and his white girlfriend that, as a biracial couple, they'd better prepare for \\"a whole lot of ugly from a never ending parade of stupid.\\"<br /><br />Anne<br />[...]s father (Christopher Walken) - it's over the top, but also quite pointed.<br /><br />The obligatory potty humour actually follows the attempted seduction scene, as Tracy's father, forced to sleep out of the house, sleeps downstairs in the joke and gag shop he owns - and with nothing else soft to sleep on, fashions a mattress out of dozens of inflated whoopie cushions.<br /><br />The theme which runs throughout the movie - and indeed it does it very well - is racial segregation and the move for integration.

And why did that man hold open his coat at those ladies, and the other man fall down?\\"<br /><br />By the way, this movie provided me with what has to be one of my favourite movie lines of the year - when Queen Latifah's character advises her son and his white girlfriend that, as a biracial couple, they'd better prepare for \\"a whole lot of ugly from a never ending parade of stupid.\\"<br /><br />Anne<br />[...]
B00001U0DP|5.0|No gratuitous pity party here... this film shows the sorrow of the holocaust but also how a family did their best to get through and protect the next generation.  I've never cried so much at the end of a film, but these were tears of both joy and sadness-- both of which make up the story of any survivor of trauma or terror.
B0000AK7AB|3.0|I had a hard time with whether or not to recommend the movie \\"Babe\\" in this review. Overall, it is a cute movie, but it has a lot of issues, and so I would not recommend it readily, and certainly not for someone under the age of, say, 12, and then only with eyes wide open.<br /><br />It isn't the language (there is only one notable language issue - when one of the animals calls another a \\"butt head\\").<br /><br />It's the violence. This is a very violent movie; much more so than I had remembered from the first time I saw it, back when it first came out.<br /><br />It starts with the farmer taking the baby pig (\\"Babe\\") out to shoot him for Christmas dinner. He carries a loaded shotgun, and you see him walk out with it, you hear the shot, and then you see him walking back to the house with a dead animal (which turns out to be a duck, not Babe).<br /><br />Then you see several animals looking through a window into the house, at the Christmas dinner scene, including a different duck, who is mourning the dead duck that they are eating.<br /><br />And that's only the beginning.<br /><br />As Babe becomes more of a favourite around the farm, and starts trying to herd sheep, one of the two real sheep dogs - the male - goes crazy, and attacks his mate (the female sheep dog - \\"Mom\\" - Babe's `adopted mother') in a fight which leaves her and the farmer wounded, and causes the male dog to be chained, muzzled, and drugged into a near comatose state.<br /><br />During this time, Babe is making friends with the sheep, whom the dogs consider stupid and worthy of contempt - a feeling which is returned by the sheep.<br /><br />The oldest sheep - Ma (or, in sheep, \\"Ma-a-a-a\\") - is a wise old female sheep, and is very sweet to Babe. In a horrific scene, she is attacked by a pack of wild dogs, brought down, and killed. The entire ruff around her neck is bloody. Babe, who drives the dogs off, sobs by her dead body, his own nose bloodied. That is how the farmer finds them, and he believes that Babe has killed the sheep. The next scene is of the dead sheep being driven back to the farm, on the back of a flatbed truck, her head flopping along the edge of the bed of the truck. The next scene is a very tense several moments of the farmer loading his shotgun, and taking Babe out to the shed, cocking the shotgun, and aiming it at Babe's head... finger on the trigger, slowly squeezing. (Because, you see, the rule is that any animal that kills a sheep has to be killed, and the farmer thinks that Babe killed Ma.)<br /><br />In addition to the violence, there is bullying and intimidation (dogs to the sheep, a cat to Babe), and, of course, the \\"butt head\\", which in contrast to the violence seems tame, but is, none the less, pretty objectionable.<br /><br />Perhaps I wouldn't have been so surprised and disappointed if \\"Babe\\" had garnered at least a PG rating, but these sorts of scenes are not what I expect - or want - in a G rated movie.<br /><br />Anne<br />[...]hat Babe has killed the sheep.

0143038419|5.0|I enjoyed this book so much that I purchased 10 additional copies and gave them as Christmas gifts.  Eat, Pray, Love is truly an inspirational read.  I highlighted excerpts throughout the book and refer back to them often.  Liz Gilbert hit upon so many emotions that a lot of us feel but are afraid to expose.  It was a relief to know that many of us share those same emotions.  I loved this book.
6305428387|2.0|This is the story of the Jamaican bobsled team that made it to the Olympics. It is based on a true story.    Unfortunately, true or not, there are scenes you just don't want children to see, and we were prettty shocked that it was rated only PG.    We could maybe have lived with one character calling another \\"*ssh*le\\", but there is an extended scene in a bar, involving a bar fight, during which the drinking, name-calling and fighting in that scene bracket another scene in the mens room of the bar, where one of the characters looks into a mirror and says, over and over, \\" I'm a bad-*ss mother who don't take no cr*p off of nobody!\\"    If these don't bother you - or if your child is of an age where you feel it's ok for them to see these scenes - then \\"Cool Runnings\\" is an otherwise ok movie. But these scenes were of a magnitude that for us this movie was definitely not ok.    Anne  [...]
0140306013|5.0|I love Watership Down. It's not just a story about rabbits - it's a peek at humanity and society at it's best and worst, simply from a four legged point of view. I read an average of 5 books a month and yet I make it a point to read this book at least once a year. After all these years, I still find myself looking forward to visiting with Fiver, Hazel and Bigwig. I recently took two books with me for a 12 hour flight to Greece - a new one and Watership Down. It was Watership that I read. If I were lost on a desert island and could have only one book with me, this would be the one.
B00007L4MJ|5.0|i took my daughter to see this when it was restored.  i think she was nine at the time.  she sat there and asked a few questions and then she watched saying nothing more until the film was done.  oh, the discussions we had on the way home!  we talked about the differences between white collar, blue collar, class distinctions, false idols, and how weak minds can be swayed becoming the mob.<br /><br />she's had her share of disney and the like.  it's nice for me to know that she likes these new things i show her as well as what cartoons she may watch. and that doesn't include anime...

B000ZN8036|5.0|Having become familiar with the story of Chris McCandless before the movie came out purely as a traveller, I was suprised to hear of the movie being done, and by sean penn no less.<br /><br />Having watched the movie, I feel that this is one of penn's greatest movies yet. The direction, powerful as it is raw and simple weaves a tale about the tales of Alexander Supertramp that make you feel as if you cant help but like the good nature of the character, despite the fact that all his travel to fill some void in his life, to give a sense of escapism to his life of material goods and comfortable exsistence for a life of survival.<br /><br />I believe everyone can take something away with themselves from this movie. Whether we reevaluate our place in life, our impact on this planet and how we have become disconnected from nature or the simple joy of being on the free road, this movie will affect most people that will walk away from it with something.<br /><br />I bought [[ASIN:B000ULQV0W Music for the Motion Picture Into the Wild]]months before I got to watch the movie, and the music is more fitting and special for the movie once you watch it, a deeply personal journey for Eddie Vedder too, or so it seems.
B00004U8JV|4.0|And so is daddy, in this Jurassic Park sequal that includes not one, but two T-Rexes.  For a sequal, I thought this held up well, though it still can't come close to the sharpness of the first Jurassic Park.  Though it comes down to mostly the story that never flows with the ease of the first film, and a group of characters that don't seem to click as well either, this is very enjoyable and thrilling at times, and deserves more credit than it receives.<br /><br />I was actually a bit surprised when I found out that Spielberg worked on this sequal.  The overall quality didn't feel like his work, and in addition, the music by John Williams was good, but less than what I would expect from him.  The action was definelty more abundant in this sequal, and still contained several scary moments involving the ever famous carnivores - TRex and Raptors, and both we see alot more of this time around.  Although there were more action scenes, those of the first film felt like they were put together very well, while these had your every-day slap-on approach without as much thought behind them.  The action in the first film felt like it progressed the plot along, while here, its more for just action purposes.  The TRex in San Diego scene is interesting.  Its fun in one sense, cause its almost a guilty pleasure of the \\"just what if?\\" scenario, but when you look back unfortunately it feels so unnecessary for the story.<br /><br />Ian Malcom (Jeff Goldblum) returns from the first film in the lead role this time around, which is one of my favorite things about the film because I actualy enjoyed his character so much from the first film.  Things have changed since last time we saw him, and his character has changed too, but still enjoyable.  The remaining cast of stars was nice to see in a film like this, but just because you are a good actor doesn't mean this is a film that flows naturally for you.  In other words, they were all good, but felt  bit more out of place than the naturality of those in the first film.  Other characters who make a return from the original Jurassic Park include John Hammond and his grandkids, but for nothing more than some cameos.<br /><br />All in all this is a good film, for a sequal.  There is plenty to be criticized, but these are all deatails and overall the movie is still filled with dinosaur fun, action and scares.  Not as good as the original, but better than the third.<br /><br />Acting - 4<br />Action - 4.5<br />Characters - 4<br />Story - 3.5<br />Overall - 4first film.

B000YXMMAE|5.0|Radiohead return after four years with \\"In Rainbows\\", their seventh studio album. For me, 2003's \\"Hail To The Thief\\" was an indicator that Radiohead needed a rest. During the past four years the band ended their contract with Capitol, Yorke released a solo album and the group tried something unheard of--releasing \\"In Rainbows\\" as a digital download on their website for whatever you wanted to pay.<br /><br />I did not buy \\"In Rainbows\\" as a digital download back in October 2007, but instead waited patiently for the compact disc version since I have their other six cds and wanted a physical copy to go with my collection.<br /><br />The question as to whether \\"In Rainbows\\" was going to be good remained. After listening a dozen times, capped with the sobering news of my mother's death, I have to say that \\"In Rainbows\\" is my favorite Radiohead cd since 1995's \\"The Bends\\". All 10 tracks seamless mesh together extremely well. There is no filler, no wasted space. It's been a long time since I've listened to a cd that I haven't felt the urge to skip a track, and it's been even longer since I have listened to a Radiohead cd all the way through and enjoyed it.<br /><br />\\"In Rainbows\\" does what \\"The Bends\\" did--it takes the best experimental and mainstream components of Radiohead and blends them together extremely  well. Gone are the endless noodlings of \\"Hail To The Thief\\", \\"Amnesiac\\" and \\"Kid A\\". The songs have structure and hooks finally, something to return to time and again.<br /><br />Are there tracks that stand out more than the others on \\"In Rainbows\\"? Yes, and I would say \\"15 Step\\", \\"All I Need\\", \\"Reckoner\\", \\"House Of Cards\\" and \\"Videotape\\" are my favorites.<br /><br />Five star rating because \\"In Rainbows\\" comes very close to \\"The Bends\\" and \\"OK Computer\\" in terms of quality. Radiohead are back, and without a record company interfering with their musical vision. Now, if only other artists could take Radiohead's cue. \\"In Rainbows\\" should not be missed by any Radiohead fan.

B00005JPXY|1.0|From all those trailers and commercials of Cloverfield, I was real excited to see this. It gave the intense feeling other monster movies use like Alien. However, many fall backs keep this (probably) great movie from reaching its potential. For one, the camera is very shakey; I understand the producers are trying to give the authentic point of view feeling, but they overdid it and made the camera bounce up and down and moving very rapidly. The beginning was horrible...party scene was tasteless and very long. As I said, don't watch this movie if you know you are sensitive to motion. I left early because I almost threw up, and I'm just giving you sound advice. Hope you find this helpful.

B00005221M|4.0|This film turned out much better than I had expected.  It is not one you hear mentioned everyday, but it has it's place here around my hometown in Western N.C.  It is here that some of the film was shot on location, specificaly the breathtaking climactic fight on the rock face mountain (shot at Chimney Rock park, just outside of Asheville.)  The scene, which is my original means for seeing this movie, was shot better than I could have imagined, and I have been to the park on numerous occasions.  The music, the charcaters, the story - it all came together in this climactic finish.  But enough about that, the entire film turned out to be astonishing and I enjoyed nearly every moment of it.<br /><br />The cinematography of the lush forests, pouring waterfalls, and glazing mountain ranges are almost guranteed to draw you into this epic, along with an incredible score that screams epic and beauty, which is so good it's worth buying on cd.  The story is well told and holds a good deal of interest, with points of view told from multiple angles - the English, French, Indians, and the Mohicans - 3 men, playing our main characters who remain neutral to the surrounding conflicts.  One is an Indian father, the other two his sons, one Indian and the other an adopted white - Hawkeye (Daniel Day-Lewis)  The story of these men is wondeful, showing us it is possible to stay neutral for only so long surrounded by such events.  Hawkeye falls in love with an English colonel's daughter, and from there on it gets complicated, though rewarding with love and romance.<br /><br />Speaking of romance, this is what the film comes down to.  In the end its really about love, and that sounds cheesy, but this is one of those films that take it so far without ever getting cheesy.  It is one of the best romance films I have seen.  The kiss shared between Hawkeye and Cora isn't your typical hollywood kiss scene.  Something about it shouts passion and love in the most realistic of senses.  And then there is the other love in the film, a shared and secretive love that had an astounding conclusion in the end - both wonderful yet immensly sad and tragic.  I don't want to say who these two were, because it is worth the watch to see this unfold.<br /><br />If you are an action junkie, this isn't really so much the movie for you, but be pleased to know that there is plenty of action throughout.  It may not hold up to scenes in films like Braveheart or The Patriot, but some of the action taking place admidst the beautiful landscapes give it that additional boost to standapart from the other films.  And like most films, there's always a villain, and Wes Studi portray's Magua very well, eventually doing as he said he would, ripping the heart out of the English colonel.<br /><br />Though this film will never compare to the perfection and grandness of say Dances With Wolves, this holds its own and has unique qualities that certainly sets itself apart.  Very underrated and not spoken of enough, this movie is one to be added to everyone's must see list.<br /><br />Acting - 4.5<br />Action - 4<br />Characters - 4.5<br />Story - 4.5<br />Overall - 4.5love in the film, a shared and secretive love that had an astounding conclusion in the end - both wonderful yet immensly sad and tragic.

B000K15VSA|5.0|It goes without saying, how fantastic it is to have so many different cuts of Blade Runner in one package.  I also don't need to mention how stunning \\"The Final Cut\\" is.  If you're buying this set, then you already know that.  The cool brief case, the toys inside, blah, blah blah.  A dream come true, all of it, sure.  But what turns out to be the best part?  Two words:  Dangerous Days.<br /><br />For rabid fans of the movie, the ones who immersed themselves in the conspiracy theories and the history of the movie.  The fans who obsessed over Paul Sammon's \\"Future Noir\\".  Dangerous Days is one of the most comprehensive \\"Making of\\" features I have ever seen.  Over 3 hours long, covering the genesis of the movie from the novel through it's release.  The new interviews, not only with cast, but also the producers, Ridley himself, but most importantly, the crew.  It's just remarkable hearing from the art department responsible for what has become one of the most visually influential movies of all time.<br /><br />The truth is, I have no idea why I'm writing this review, other than to gush over this answer to a fanboy's prayers.  But you don't need to hear it from me.  If you are like minded, then you ordered this set, months ago and I'm not telling you anything new.  And if you weren't a fan before, You won't get it now.
B00005ATZT|4.0|The Fugitive is a great thriller of a movie, but holds a special place with me.  Part of this film was shot in my hometown of Sylva, NC plus many of the other surrounding areas.  This is a small town not many have heard of, small enough to be used in this film as a small town somewhere in backwoods Illinois.  I didn't know there were mountains in Illinois anyways?  The train wreck scene, which is one of the most spectacular action sequences of the film, I have had the enjoyment of seeing the preserved wreckage in person on a train ride that you can take in the area.  The scene where Harrison Ford jumps from the dam is actually Fontana Dam, located about 45 minutes west of Sylva.  Anyways, enough of the details about those scenes, but in case you were wondering, thats where they were shot.<br /><br />As a whole this movie is extremely well crafted.  You've basically got an edge of your seat thriller, updated from the 1960's tv series.  Harrison Ford and Tommy Lee Jones both deliever first rate performances and have great chemistry, something that keeps this movie strong till the very end.  The story is well written and executed, and is complex enough to keep you thinking on your toes, but not too complex to ever feel left out.  The action scenes are wonderfully shot, and the chases and elements of suspense are tight.<br /><br />There's little more to say about this film, it is very good in all areas.  It doesn't contain the best story written, the best cast of characters, or the greatest action scenes of all time.  But it does have a dose of all of that, and with a very solid feel in the end.<br /><br />Acting - 4.5<br />Action - 4<br />Characters - 4.5<br />Story - 4.5<br />Overall - 4.5
B000UBMWG4|5.0|The Blu Ray 5 disk set is without a doubt the most in depth treatment of a film that I have ever viewed.  I think I can safetly say that I now know everything there is to know about Blade Runner. No stone has been left unturned.    I have always found this movie interesting, but this collection has skyrocketed it to being one of my favorites.  The story behind the movie is just as, if not, more interesting than the movie itself.  The new documentaty \\"Dangerous Days\\" is one of the most fascinating I have seen in a while, and is alone reason to buy this new set.    If you have any interest at all in this film, this set is a must own.  This is one of the most beautiful sci-fi flicks ever made, and the 5 versions presented here are all viewed in wonderful high def.  I have never been to film school but I definatley think I deserve a diploma, now that I have graduted the school of Blade Runner.
B00003CXXS|4.0|I found the story to JP3 to be much simpler than the first two films.  Both of the other JP's incorporated a business aspect to the films with the amusement park in the first, and the company INGEN in the 2nd, on top of the action, scares and magnificent creatures.  The third film seems to stay much simpler, with the story coming down to nothing much more than a rescue operation of a 12 year old boy on the site B-island (the island from the Lost World).  While the plot Held up for what it was, its mostly a good popcorn movie that does keep you on edge with its action.<br /><br />The slightly less than 90 minute run was actually a good length for JP3, since it didn't seem like the story would have been able to expand to two hours based on what was given.  The 90 minute run does establish some development between characters as well as some thought and feelings about the sensitive subject of these modern day dinosaurs,but most of the time is dedicated to lots of terrific thrills and action.  Most of the familiar dinos return such as the T-Rex and your loveable Raptors.  The T-Rex however, is given much less screentime in this film, as he is actually less superior to the new Spinosaurus (proven in a showdown between the two creatures) who gets plenty of scenes throughout the movie.  The raptors get their fare share of time too, though this time its not all about hunting and preying, they actually communicate now and have strategies.  In other words, they've gotten smarter since the last film.<br /><br />The cast actually held together well, and clicked a little more than the last film.  The biggest treats are the return of two main characters from the first JP - Alan and Ellie, both played by the same actors - Sam Neil and Laura Dern.  Ellie doesn't get nearly as much screentime in JP3, but Alan is basically back as the main character.  No Jeff Goldblum this time though.<br /><br />I'd say the action was pretty good overall, but I enjoyed the T-Rex and Raptor scenes more from the first two films.  The Spinosaurus did add a lot to JP3 though, and so did the dinobirds, called Pterosaurs.  There is enough action to keep things exciting from beginning to end, and the effects as always, were wonderful.<br /><br />JP3 keeps the series going, and going smoothly instead of brining a good franchise to a pitiful ending.<br /><br />Acting - 4<br />Action - 4<br />Characters - 4<br />Story - 3.5<br />Overall - 3.5ilms.

0385486804|1.0|A book about a person who spent his life creating journals, photo albums, writing postcards, documenting philosophical ideas of how find one's identity through strife, and trial - yet the book about this person contains not one single photograph taken by McCandless, no photo of his \\"unique, one of a kind, handmade leather belt\\" (though about half a page of verbose description was seen as necessary), not even a sample of McCandless' \\"characteristic handwriting\\".  No photos taken by the author of the place where McCandless lived, traveled, died...absolutely nothing at all.  What was the point of reading this, I wonder?  A two paragraph news article gives all the same details and information that takes KRAKAUER 207 pages to convey.  Typing \\"Chris McCandless\\" into google images search gives more of a glimpse into Chris' life than does his \\"Biography\\". If pictoral documentation was beyond the \\"scope\\" of this book, why \\"write\\" a biography of a visual artist?  Why verbally describe his artwork and not include any of it with the text?  Why write a book about one person, and end up filling about 40 pages of 200 with description of other (more interesting) journeymen and their adventures, and link them to McCandless' experiences with such weak paralells as \\"they were both unprepared, in the wilderness\\".  Looks like someone is just trying to fill enough pages to publish a book on a person that got a lot of media attention.<br />KRAKAUER glorifies the idea of being irresponsible, unable to hold a job, unable to be a worthy participant in human relationship roles such as son, or brother, or friend. He encourages McCandless' view that being a contribution to society means that you've forsaken the idea that humans are still animals at heart.<br />All in all, fails to satisfy any curiosity about McCandless' life and travels, and at the same time, successfully makes ignorant exaggerations of the nobility at the heart of a hobo lifestyle.
B00006LJ72|5.0|I had only ever heard Orinoco Flow (sail away) and Only Time.  But this is one of the most beautiful collections of music I have ever heard.  I ordered one for my son, and just tried to order one for my granddaugter, but somehow ended up with Amazon's preferred selection for me.    I love Amazon, but don't do my choosing for me.  I am very well capable of doing that myself, thank you.

B00005JPXY|5.0|I know many people want films to be neatly summed up and explained. For some films that is necessary and important. For a film such as \\"Cloverfield\\" the more that gets explained the more you take away from your audience and the less they can go home with.<br /><br />This film lets the mind race and wander as to what on earth is actually going on. Since no clear explanation is given, audience members are permitted to speculate and wonder. This film gives just enough info that I felt wholly satisfied, while at the same time leaving enough exposition in the dark as to make me truly feel I was in and amongst the chaos. People that do not like this type of filmmaking should steer clear of this.<br /><br />The visual echos of 9/11 are very obvious. Some people thought they were done in poor taste. I disagree. I think they gave the film more realism. Actually anything less than what we know reality to look like now when large buildings fall would have been criticized as unrealistic. This film was very realistic looking. Also the film spoke to the state of our society, our fears, and our paranoia. The ignorance the film made you feel is the very real ignorance we all have as to what is actually going on in this world and how we feel helpless in the face of many giant disasters, wars, and people of power. This is not political, rather, it's just timely and reactionary. Godzilla was a reaction to the atomic bombs, as were many atomic films of the day. Aliens attacking us are fears we may not be alone and what is out there may be worse than us. recent disaster films are reactions to 9/11 and what the future may hold. Ultimately all these types of disaster films find their roots in very base human fears of man against nature. We know we are insignificant despite all our progress and these types of films speak volumes about that.<br /><br />The comments the characters made in the film were just as stupid and lame brain as the ones the audience members were making in the theater, hence more realism. Real people are not actors and do not act cool in crisis. People react in ways that contradict reason during crisis. Going after a loved one is very realistic. People go back for pets so to track down a girlfriend is not much of a leap. As far as friends following, well... suspension of disbelief may be required. Since I was sitting in the theater trying to accept a giant monster destroying Manhattan...well... accepting a few friends tagging along to rescue some dudes girl was not hard to accept.<br /><br />If you need everything explained, if you don't like shaky camera work, if you hate Godzilla films, and if you thought \\"Independence Day\\" was great, then stay away from this. You will hate it.<br /><br />I loved it!al people are not actors and do not act cool in crisis. People react in ways that contradict reason during crisis. Going after a loved one is very realistic.

0312360266|5.0|Well written and had a great story.  I live close to Tulsa, so it was neat to read a book that included all the places I have grown up knowing.
0385338694|3.0|I was really taken in by the story. It is a fun, light and easy read, definitely a great \\"escape\\". I think I read the entire book in 2 days! I really couldn't put it down.    Those are the pros...Now for the cons. (NOTE: SPOILERS INCLUDED!!! READ AT YOUR OWN RISK!!! :) There are way too many loose ends that go untied at the conclusion of this book. The book closes with many of the subplots (including major ones) never even being discussed, much less wrapped up! There are several questions I would like answered: 1) What happens with Arnold? This should be an obvious one - Sam's story is supposedly all over the press. Don't you think a major corruption scandal involving London's best law firm and top banks would take precedence?!; 2) We never hear from Freya after her call to the Geiger's. What happened to her? She's supposed to be Sam's best friend!; 3) What happens to the Geiger's, especially regarding their \\"business purchase\\" that Sam helped wreck? I think it should've come out that Sam saved Mr. Geiger from a bad deal; and 4) For the obvious one, where do Sam & Nathaniel end up?     The sad thing is, that is not all of them! As soon as I finished reading the novel, I thought \\"where can I get the sequel?\\". Unfortunately, there isn't one (but it's not too late Sophie!!!! Bring back Samantha for us!!! :) As I stated earlier, it is a fun read but quite frustrating at the conclusion, which causes it to lose its luster.
0345494997|3.0|I would have never picked this book up if I hadn't read somewhere someone mentioning this in passing. When I saw it at the library cart, I thought, what the heck. I'll just pick it up and read it. I need something to distract me. It was cold out and I really needed something to read while taking care of two kids with a bad case of a head cold.    I know nil about Frank Lloyd Wright. I didn't really care about him nor about architecture. I am always game to reading something new though and I thought the premise for this novel was rather interesting. It started out strong especially since it's Mamah telling the story. Then I ran into a lot of dry spells where it was hard sticking with reading just this book. I wanted to finish this book for some reason and today, I managed to. The pace picked up more so after they've returned from Europe and the melodramas about losing her children ceased. However, I was not prepared for the ending. I had no idea that it was coming. That alone saved the book for me. Even then, it all fell flat at the end. It just didn't feel finished.    Was this a great love story? No, it was not. It was about an extremely selfish man who thought nothing of using anyone to get ahead. It did not surprise me that he didn't pay his creditors and his workers. It did not surprise me that he bought three baby grand pianos. None of it surprised me. I think I would have been more surprised if he did change his entire attitude and life around after Mamah's tragic end. And I had no patience for Mamah. If she really loved her children, then she would have fought tooth and nail to see them more often. From what it sounds like, her ex-husband was a geniunely nice guy. And she laments over her ruined relationship with her children. What did she expect after deserting them in Boulder, Colorado for Europe? I can't imagine what the kids thought and while you can't undo what has been done, I do believe the kids were the greatest victims in this story. They did not askfor their mother to be irresponsible and run off. They did not ask to be murdered. They were at the wrong place at the wrong time.     So at times, both characters can be sympathetic characters but it's hard to be sympathetic with someone when they've ill-abused their family and friends. However, this was a compelling story. I could not put down the last 150 pages. That says something to me as a reader. Since I didn't expect anything from this novel (I had not even heard of it till someone mentioned it!), I didn't have to be excited or disappointed about it.    It is good reading if you like historical fiction. It's not the best I've read nor is it the worst. It's just a good story and shows a great deal about the early 1900s which I am interested in.    1-20-08

B000PTYP5C|4.0|Systematic Chaos - 2-Disc Special Edition<br /><br />I made sure I got the special edition CD. Well worth the extra loot for this one. Since a billion people already reviewed this one, telling what songs are on there, I'll just give you a quick rundown of what I thought of the songs, being a long-time DT fan.<br /><br />In The Presence of Enemies - Great intro, great overall song. One of the few ones I can listen to all the way through and enjoy every piece.<br /><br />Forsaken - Usually skip this song. Has a Zack Wilde meets Megadeth feel to it, but the piano works well overall, balancing out the entire song.<br /><br />Constant Motion - A great overall song, except for the vocals. James meets Biohazard, just doesn't work at all. And having Portnoy growling doesn't make things better either. Numbing guitar, crippling rhythm, and Petrucci shows us one of the best solos on the album.<br /><br />The Dark Eternal Night - Hated this song at first because of the Biohazard-like vocals, but the riffs and solos are great. If you like screaming and growls this one's for you.<br /><br />Repentance - Such a beautiful song! The only other one I can listen to all the way through. Great vocals and lyrics (this is the kind of stuff you should stick to singing, James!), kool rhythm, and awesome keyboarding and guitar work.<br /><br />Prophets of War - Sorry. No matter how many times I try to listen to it, I can't. It's just too gay! Vocals and keyboards are just not DT material. Would have worked better on a Trixter album, not here.<br /><br />The Ministry of Lost Souls - Darker lyrics. Slow, slow introduction. The best part picks up around 9:20 and lasts for a few minutes. This instrumental section shows off the reasons to get this album: Petrucci's riffs, Portnoy's beats, and how the whole group just builds and builds, layering solos galore. Then it dies down and it's time to skip to the last song.<br /><br />In The Presence of Enemies Pt. II - Not a bad intro. Very Pink Floydish. My gripe with this song aren't so much the lyrics as the way James sings them, especially that `Dark Master' part! Sounds so gay and repetitive and just plain awful. That's really the only flaw with this song. I don't mind the fans chanting and shouting at all. As with the last one, around 11 minutes or so, we come into a great build of riffs, rhythms, and DT progression.<br /><br />Overall a great album. And the bonus DVD is great too.

B00005NTJM|4.0|While \\"This Was\\" is far from Jethro Tull's most developed or defining album, it is a very enjoyable introduction to the bands curious juxtapostion of flute against the standard rock band configuration. The material is deeper rooted in the blues forms that had a toe hold on most of the Brit rockers with mid/late 60's born-on-dates (think Cream) - However, the genre-fusing that continued to serve Tull very well into the new millennium was already in gear with tinges of jazz sweating through the muscular blues progressions the band vigorously fleshed out. Ian Anderson's song writing was already strong with gems like \\"A Song For Jeffrey\\", \\"Beggar's Farm\\" and the powerful \\"My Sunday Feeling.\\" And although he lacked the natural vocal tools possessed by most of his contemporaries, Anderson exuded more attitude and conviction than just about any front man on the scene. \\"This Was\\" sets the stage for Anderson's musical vision, signature flute and instantly recognizable vocals to navigate a near half-century journey through a myriad of musical styles and textures, played to a world that is much changed from even the turbulent decade from whence it came. Oh, did I mention that it sounds better now than it did then?
B00006CXSS|4.0|This miniseries is excellent, and I would rate it 5 stars except for the condition in which my DVDs arrived. The first set I received had scratched disks. I returned it and then in the second set I recieved the keepsake metal case was severly dented and the discs inside were flying around all over because the mechanisms which keep them in place were busted. I sent this one back for an exchange and amazon said they'll refund me, but won't send another. Fantastic. The way that this miniseries is packaged is setting it up for failure in shipping. Beware and try to buy it in a local store if possible, to minimize the beating it will recieve from UPS. Also, I noticed some people complaining that there were no English captions. They are available, but you must turn your TV's captions on just as you would if you were watching cable or satellite or whatever instead of finding them in the DVD menu.

0810945797|5.0|A must have for any Dark Crystal fan. It contains detailed pictures, decriptios of the various races, and a breif overveiw of how the world works.  It also contains some history on the making of the movie, and a copy of the orginal movie idea.  Even if you don't like the movie, it would be hard not to appreciate level of detail that went into this imaginary world.    Overall: An excellent book, which I highly recomend.

B00005JPXY|5.0|Unfourtuantly, I have to start this review a little negative.  Personally, I loved the movie, my parents went with me to see it last night and my dad was impressed, my mom couldn't watch it due to motion sickness.  Pretty much it has the same type of filming that the \\"Blair Witch\\" had, which was unsteady shots and jearky, which was expected considering the film was supposed to have been shot with a good old fashioned cam corder.  Pesonally, I liked the raw look given by the cam corder, it made me feel like I was actually a part of the movie and for it to have the effects that it did made it seem so realistic.  Now, enough about the filming, let me talk about the movie itself.  The acting was very believeable, the story very structured, and it was especially creepy considering the creature didn't ever have a name or origin.  The actors in this film touch a point that I have been pondering for quite some time.  It is a known fact that prehistoric fish, that were thought to have been extinct have been discovered, and also there is the lock ness monster.  The point given by the camera man is if these things exist what more is out in the water just waiting.  Overall, there are many scenes that are breath taking and very unexpected, pretty much when the head of the statue of liberty rolls down the street with bite and slash marks on it, you realize then anything is possiable, and truthfully it is.
B00000DR5I|5.0|This album must be listened to in the dark. Pitch black. Seriously.  You don't want to be distracted, because this music can do stuff to you.  It has to me.  It is, to me, the audio equivalent of an 0rg@$m.  The cover on it is another description of the music.  Sublime.<br /><br />While this album is only 30 years old (unlike classical music which is obviously older), I seriously feel that, like classical music, this stuff can give off so many emotions like classical music, it's expressive without a hint of lyrics, can take you places, and requires your full attention.  Like one of the other reviewers, my hats off to you if you can describe the music in words.  This stuff can do a lot of images.  Heck, I'm just anaylzing it like crazy here.  And for those of you who want something emotional out of music (not just something for psuedo music fans that tickle their fancy dissecting technical music), it's here.  All those expressiveness and places will bring up emotion, although it's sublime.  Heck, get this album yourself and listen to it.  I look forward listening to this album...again!<br /><br />Before I wrap this up, I want to address some of these people calling this not music.  It's easy to say that because it just doesn't have a beat or isn't structured like a song by Kiss, the Eagles, etc.  It brings up emotion, it relies on the sequence of sounds to make something with a bit of repition, it has a structure, it has melody, texture, and timbre.  It's a collection of organized sounds and you get something by letting it consume you and basking, thinking, feeling emotions.  For the people who intend using this as backround music for reading or some other stupid ______, I'm sorry, but those people are missing something.  THis isn't backround music, it requires attention, and you people should put the ________ book away and turn off the light, and let this music do something to you.<br /><br />Hopefully somedays, people will figure out more about these guys.  Despite that this music demands attention and lacks any convential melodies like the disposable _____ today, even the MTV fanatic tween (hey they have feelings too!) could get something out of this.  Dammnit, if those people had an attention span, they could even get something out of this.  Seriously.  If you don't have a soul, than yes, you really will not like this at all.  But that will never happen, so there's no excuse for anybody for not giving this a try.  Create your own world inside Rubycon.<br /><br />10/10ds attention and lacks any convential melodies like the disposable _____ today, even the MTV fanatic tween (hey they have feelings too!) could get something out of this.

It's hard to imagine the book being improved on, but I thought the book would have been better had it been pared down a tad.  She had several books rolled into one there.    I'm holding hope that PBS turns her book into a another fine production to view.

B000VBJEEG|5.0|I found this film to be charming. It's very sweet natured, and concerns a rat with a dream. Don't we all have a dream? I have no problem with rats as heros or determined heroic icons, having loved a mouse (Stuart Little, of course!) all my life, and numerous other animal stars. Obviously, viewers of this film must understand and accept what they are getting into when they watch \\"Ratatouille\\". Remy the rat is as adorable and as dedicated to his love of gourmet cooking as he can be. Linguini beomes his partner. This inept, Cinderella-like garbage boy of the kitchen in the fine French restaurant which keeps losing its stars and lustre is a great character, very human, bumbling, and loaded with appeal. Not as sweet, but totally charming is Colette, the attractive chef who is \\"stuck\\" with Linguini after he cooks up a soup all the diners discover and rave over. It has actually been cooked up by the incredibly talented rat-chef Remy, who had laboriously and secretively climbed up ladles, using them as springboards to drop bits of flavorings into the pot until his creation was perfection! Truly, all he has ever wanted to do all his life is cook! Remy believes with all his soul in a cookook author, now dead, who has written a book Remy read called Anyone Can Cook. That very same author is now a little bitty portly angel floating around on Remy's shoulder, talking to him and giving him supportive advice. Interestingly, Remy himself is on Linguini's actual HEAD, beneath Linguini's chef's hat, or \\"toque\\",  guiding him and giving HIM advice. He does this by directing him -- pulling his hair to the right, or the left, making him go toward one food item or another.<br /><br />Of course we're going to have some bad guys...we have a head chef who is a dirty rotten scoundrel, and we have a food critic (voice played by Peter O'Toole) who just generally hates the whole world, we know not why. We have a health department inspector who certainly doesn't love rats, and so on.<br /><br />How the food critic (most importantly) is won over by our motley little crew, at the end of the movie, is quite touching, and I had a tear in my eye.<br /><br />For the most part, however, instead I was laughing steadily throughout this enjoyable movie, which I recommend for family viewing. I don't really think your youngest chidren will go for it, but give them a chance.

B0000009RX|4.0|This classic album, a devastating satire of the 1960s hippie scene, is comprised of mostly short songs interspersed with even briefer linking snippets. One of the most memorable songs, Who Needs The Peace Corps? is all about San Francisco with acerbic observations on an aspiring hippie daydreaming about the big time in Height Street. Concentration Moon and Mom & Dad are more serious social commentary but Harry You're A Beast and What's The Ugliest Part Of Your Body? bring out the laughs again.<br /><br />Absolutely Free is a tuneful ditty and Flower Punk with its nervous rhythm takes the listener into the head of an ambitious, highly materialistic flower child. The instrumental Nasal Retentive Calliope Music is pure found sound a la Edgar Varese, Let's Make The Water Turn Black sounds like a singalong folk tune and The Idiot Bastard Son is a mix of talking vocals, sound FX and snatches of chorus. There are gripping instrumental textures in the lyrically sharp Lonely Little Girl and Take Your Clothes Off When You Dance.<br /><br />Then follows the reprise of What's The Ugliest Part Of Your Body, the penultimate track Mother People with lovely snatches of melody, including what sounds like classical music sequences. The album concludes with the only long track (over 6 minutes), called The Chrome Plated Megaphone Of Destiny, another excursion into Varese territory with its SFX. Overall, despite the different styles of music and the many short tracks, the album is quite cohesive. At first listen it sounds messy but repeated play will soon enough reveal the magic.

B00005JPXY|5.0|When I write a review for a book or a movie, I usually give a plot summary.  Since all of us either know what this is about or can very easily find out, I'm not going to bother.  What I am going to do is point out some of the criticisms against this film and do my best to debunk them:<br /><br />1.  The camera movement is too shaky-<br /><br />True, it is very shaky and shaky to the point of being annoying.  Then again, how is the average person supposed to keep a camera steady while running away from a monster the size of a luxury liner?  Or from nasty dog-sized spiderlike vermin whose sting can literally make a person explode?<br /><br />2.  The dialogue is bad-<br /><br />When confronted with a life or death situation, do we:<br /><br />a.  Think of what Shakespeare or Marcel Proust would say?<br />b.  Say only what is necessary and just try to stay alive?<br /><br />Cloverfield tries to speculate as to how REAL people would handle a giant monster attacking their city.  Real people don't have cool one-liners for every occasion.  That's life.<br /><br />3.  We don't learn where the monster comes from-<br /><br />After all the ridiculous explanations (extraterrestrial origin, radiation, etc.) we have been given over the years, do we really need another one?  Keep in mind that the main characters are not scientists or government insiders, they are just common people who are learning as they go along.  But mainly, their primary goal is just to survive.<br /><br />4.  We only catch momentary glimpses of the monster-<br /><br />No argument here.  If I was more artistically inclined and someone were to ask me to draw a complete picture of the Cloverfield monster, I would not be able to based on what I saw from the film.  Since the shots come from a cell phone camera, how could anyone get a perfect view?<br /><br />Take my explanations or leave them.  This movie in my opinion is the best giant monster film since [[ASIN:B0008KLVG4 Jaws]].  For having such a relatively small budget ($30 million), the effects are stunning.  The scenes in which we see the city's devastation actually looked realistic.  I also found the treatment of such a seemingly lowbrow subject matter to be surprisingly dignified and literate.<br /><br />Cloverfield does not try to be the next Godzilla film.  After the 1998 fiasco, that is something for which we all should all be grateful.vastation actually looked realistic.

His duet with Nellie Furtado on 'Quando Quando Quando' is fantastic. 'You and I' is the best song on the album. The kind of music that makes you feel you are on vacation at a swanky bar and grill overlooking the water on a warm summer evening while you are enjoying a cocktail and the company of the most enchanting woman you've ever had the pleasure to meet - it really gets and keeps you 'in the mood'
B0011NVC98|1.0|Why not tell the legend as written?<br /><br />Big disappointment, except for the incredible 3-D Imax images.<br /><br />The future of movies is here.  BEOWULF is stunning in crystal clear, ultra sharp Imax 3D with its big wattage surround sound.  An epic adventure that has an incredible sense of mood and time and place. And a terrific, rousing score.<br /><br />However, what's missing is the heroic heart of this most ancient of English tales in a world where the friction between paganism and the liberation of primitive Christianity.<br /><br />Wonder why the screenwriters decide to suck the life blood from Beowulf and instead offer a not so subtle Christian-bashing subtext and a hero so flawed that he loses his legendary worth.<br /><br />And the final fight of a redemption-challenged hero with his own offspring is a bizarre, perhaps ludicrous, take on the original story.  As is Wiglaf's lingering temptation with a seductive Grendel.<br /><br />Even our 13 year old son, no doubt the target demographic for this film, was also disappointed with the movie.  He's read the poem and asked \\"Why Wiglaf didn't throw an axe at Grendel's mom in the end.  Has Wiglaf learned nothing being Beowulf's best buddy all his life?\\" Apparently not.<br /><br />Check out the movie in 3-D if you can find it. Or even see it on DVD if you must, then read Seamus Heaney's translation or better yet, listen to his amazing narrative CD.<br /><br />In our age of religious conflict, is it possible to have a flawed but morally principled hero who will risk all for not for the glory and the fame and the fortune, but to remove the evil that has befallen an enemy?<br /><br />That's the real question.  How can an enemy become an ally?<br /><br />In the poem, Beowulf is clearly a type of Christ figure and that has been removed from the movie.<br /><br />We need heroic figures -- even if only on celluloid.

B00005JPXY|4.0|The movie that what seems like everyone has been talking about since the middle of last year finally arrived this past Friday in theaters. Cloverfield could be the monster movie surrounded with the most hype to ever be made. Don't confuse that with being the biggest monster movie ever made. It just has the most hype. If you couldn't tell by the trailer, the main premise of the film is that a monster attacks Manhattan. There isn't much story after that, but the beginning of the film goes a little something like this:<br /><br />Rob is leaving for Japan since he finally got that promotion he's been working so hard for. His friends have decided to surprise him and throw him a big going away party. As a token to remember them by, Lily wants her boyfriend Jason(who's also Rob's brother), to film testimonials from everyone at the party wishing Rob the best of luck in Japan. Jason winds up passing the duty onto Hud, who only takes the job because he finds out Marlena will be at the party whom he has a crush on. Things aren't so good for Rob though as he's in love with Beth. They used to date and Rob even filmed a romantic weekend they had(which you see snippets of throughout the movie). After that weekend though, Rob didn't contact Beth since he was going to be leaving for Japan. Beth took that as a sign that Rob wasn't interested and moved on. She shows up at the party with another guy named Travis. Rob and Beth get into an argument about the way things left off between them and Beth and Travis wind up leaving because of it. Rob winds up sulking about Beth until Jason and Hud go to talk to him. They basically tell Rob that he needs to go after Beth since he's in love with her. Then a loud crash is heard and all the lights go out. That's when all hell breaks loose.<br /><br />From here on out, the film revolves around a) the monster attacking the city b) everyone running for their lives and c) the military trying to take it down. There's a scene where Rob, Lily, Marlena, and Hud are running in the street and they wind up right in front of the monster, then the military comes out of nowhere and just starts blasting it with all the firepower they have. That's one of the most intense scenes in the movie. Worth the price of admission alone. The real gem of the film is the fact that it's all shot with a handheld camera. There is that risk of having motion sickness. It actually affected me a bit in the beginning, but you actually get used to it once the action starts. The camcorder makes things more personal. You get to follow one group of people as they try to survive this mayhem. If it was shot as just a normal movie, it wouldn't be nearly as good. It'd basically be like every other monster movie anyone has ever seen. The acting is also done very well. You believe the horror they're going through. It's the type of film that makes you feel like you need to go back and see it again because you know you missed something.<br /><br />I did have a few nitpicks about the movie though. The main one being that it felt like it took forever for things to start happening. The motion sickness thing also bothered me more during Rob's party than it did when the city was being destroyed. The other big one was that you never really get a clear shot of the monster. You get glimpses of it and enough to make out certain body parts and how many limbs it has, but even when you finally get to SEE the monster while it's bright outside...the monster is too dark to make out all the details. Don't get me wrong, you still see some of it. I guess I just wanted to see all of it in plain daylight. My other minor nitpick was the ending. It just felt...kinda rushed or something. It wasn't fulfilling. I guess it was to Rob and Beth's story, but it felt like there needed to be something else. Something more.<br /><br />Some people were upset that the movie didn't provide any answers. Things like where the monster came from and why it's attacking aren't explained in the film. I hear the viral marketing campaign provided a lot of answers and I wish I would've taken part in it when I had the chance. I've caught some of it, but not enough to fully understand everything. The thing is though...you don't really need any answers. You're seeing the film from Hud's point of view. You know what they know, which isn't much. The film accomplished what it set out to do and that's make a pretty good monster movie. And who says everything has to be explained right away anyway? Sometimes once the origin of something this massive is explained, then it's not nearly as good. Sometimes it's better not knowing.<br /><br />So, bottom line, I really enjoyed Cloverfield. It's actually one of the most intense movies I've ever seen. I actually liked the monster and I'm considering going to see it again. I've already read about a few things I missed the first time around. I'm wondering if there's anything else. I also left out a few things intentionally. A few key parts to the movie concerning the monster, how certain characters die, etc. I have to leave something for you when you see the movie, right? Despite having a few flaws, I think it lived up to the hype. I do plan on owning it once it's released on DVD and I'm more than willing to see a Cloverfield 2...if that rumor is true.<br /><br />Rating: 8/10campaign provided a lot of answers and I wish I would've taken part in it when I had the chance.

B000GPIPVU|5.0|I love this album! It has a softer, mellower touch than the first, but no less soulful. Of course, Ray Lamontagne's voice is no less stunning. If you want reflective, moody and sometimes dreamy, this will work for you.
0689877692|5.0|Our two year old and four year old love this book.  They pick out different items for one another to find.
B000UBMZ4S|5.0|I was so impressed with this movie when it came out years ago that watching it again with what I call the most pristine video quality I have seen was quite a treat, I highly resccomend it as one of the all time great sci fi movies, It set the precident for many of the styles of movie making that followed years later  Also Amazon is great for how they handle business, excellent customer service and support.
B00005JKHP|5.0|Of the six \\"true\\" Star Trek movies, this is my least favorite.  Having said that, this is not a bad movie.  It just didn't scream \\"Star Trek\\" as much as the others in the series.  I can't really explain why.  Any rate, the touch ups to the movie are good, as are the bonus features on disc 2.<br />They even cut out some of the computer voice over crap that was on there.  All in all, it's a good watch.  Sit back and enjoy.
0743455967|5.0|Despite its brevity, this book probably offers more help for the aspiring writer than any other book on writing. King shares with the reader his most important tips on writing, using his unique sense of humour and many insightful analogies.    The book begins with the 'C.V.', which is basically comprised of short, humourous anecdotes from his childhood and young adulthood. These serve as a kind of appetizer to get you in the mood for the lesson that follows.    The main section of the book focuses on how to write well (surprise, surprise). King writes with a no-nonsense, unforgiving tone, telling you that if you really want to become a writer, you must 'read a lot, write a lot' - he even urges you to read during meals, as you will have to sacrifice politeness anyway if you are to become a writer. However, King does offer words of encouragement, and his tips make a lot of sense and are very, very helpful.    I liked the idea of how King used a toolbox as a metaphor for the writer's craft. The toolbox is comprised of three or four layers, and on the top layer you have your most important tools, vocabulary and grammar. On the lower layers you have the subtler tools of writing, which you will learn about as you read this.    If there is anything I didn't like about this book, it was its length. I would have expected a lot more from one of the greatest writers of all time, but you can't really blame him as he suffered a near-fatal accident halfway through the writing of this book.    All in all, this is a great book, half-autobiography, half-writing manual, and every beginning writer should have a read.
0671015206|4.0|This book isn't just in my library, it's also a book that I regularly purchase and hand out to friends and familiy members.<br /><br />The authors lay out common sense information and details on how self-made millionaires achieved their financial success.<br /><br />Basically, if everybody read this book and followed its guidance, people would at least be more aware of how to save money for their future and potentiall obtain financial freedom.

0385338600|4.0|I read this book after others by Grisham and was pleasantly surprised.  It is different from his other books, but very enjoyable still. I   see that he has a sense of humor, which I did not detect in his  other books. I would say one of my favorites by this author.
B0001Z37HM|3.0|Skimpy clothes, swords, monsters, revenge, Its got it all - and a script that is easy enough for a child to understand.  Cult classic that it is - although who knows why.  It could have been a great movie, Brigitte Nielson and Arnold Swarzenegger taking a back seat (although not by much), best thing about the movie was the music - powerful and dynamic, it carried the movie along enough to make the watcher stay till the end.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|Like most of the BBC wildlife films, this is a must have for nature lovers.  Taking years to film and produce it is a comprehensive view of nature throughout the world.  The photography is outstanding, the commentary accurate, and they show both the warm and fuzzy as well as tooth and nail aspects of nature.  As a professional biologist and wildlife artist I had to own this series so that I could watch it again and again.  Considering the decline of wildlife throughout much of the world, this is an important record of what we are losing, and hopefully not a historical record of what once was.

0783229364|3.0|Who doesn't like Michael J Fox. And in this movie it is an impossibility. Fox plays the newly graduate Brantly from Kansas.  Brantly moves to the big city to make it big as an executive and comes up only with a job in the mail room.  But with the tenacity that we all love Brantly moves into a corner office, falls in love with a co-worker, has a small affair with his boss' wife (also his Aunt) and turns this company up-side down.  Hilarious movie.
B000NVT0RU|2.0|The hype over this movie is incredible, but the film fails far short of its potential, and  falls into a depressing and predictable rut. Make no doubt, this movie does not hold a candle to Saving Private Ryan, which is sad, because there is a compelling story to be told. Spielburg could have breathed life into this mess and made it a masterpiece.     Days of Glory misses every opportunity to deal with the tragic reality of oppressive racism and systematic abuse of French colonial troops. The movie quickly takes on an element of politicaly correct, and predictable whining. It ignores potential for exploring difficult, complex subject matter in a real and poignant way: the white French are all cowardly whimps, the colonial troops are all heros, blah, blah blah. The reality, was somewhere in between; there were plenty of examples of white French officers who fought bravely alongside there colonial troops in 1940. Nor will you find the a hint of the efforts of French officers to try and save their troops from barbaric summary executions by the German army during the blitzkrieg.     Sadly, because the characters are so wooden, there is never a meaningful or thought provoking conversation between a European or a colonial soldier. Nor is there any attempt to put a human face on the average  German soldier, most of whom where arguably victims of a the fanatical Nazi state. And the dialog between the Arabs isn't much better - very little character development takes place in Days of Glory. Compare this movie with the US Civil War masterpiece Glory and you get the picture of how first rate acting can set the screen on fire. Recall the look Denzel Washington gives before getting beaten for desertion - that is acting! The closest you get to that in Days of Glory is the tomato scene, which goes no where.    Another problem is the fantastic technical inaccuracies and poor effects in the movie. Compared to contemporary war movies (Saving Private Ryan, We Were Soldiers, Black Hawk down, etc) this film clearly lacked an knowledgable military advisor. There is nothing remotely like passable sound effects, which is criminal, even on a tight budget. The combat scenes look like they came out of a B-rate 1950s black and white films. This is paticularly true of the final battle scene which is just silly - no attempt at recreating small unit tactics, just guys running around with guns and melodramatic carnage. A weak sound track completes the disapointment.    All and all, this is a beer and pretzles movie to pass a couple of hours, but if you think that the movie is going to grab you like Saving Private Ryan, forget it. You will not get much in the way of history or action either.

B00005ASGG|5.0|They arrive in town for the funeral of a man who was the rock on which the waves beat but at the time, nobody noticed much; the steady, tough but true foundation leaned on by almost all of them at one time or another and taken largely for granted; a man who, though seemingly out of character for a person possessed of such strength himself, stepped aside to let others pass to take credit after the work was done.  Broken at last from within himself, recognizing unconquerable personal forces from people he loves or respects for the common cause necessary to tame the frontier, he knows he can never hope to win or make happy what he desires most - Hallie the waitress .    One of the first thrills the viewer sees are the ice blue eyes of Lee Marvin, enhanced threefold by the neckerchief covering the bottom half of his face during the holdup that starts the story off.  Even though the film is in black and white, the color of those piercing, deadly eyes is readily apparent. Lee Marvin did a splendid job as the outlaw, Liberty Valance - I can think of no other actor better suited to compliment the characters of John Wayne as Tom Donovan, a rough and ready settler ready to defend his property by the means at hand - which means his gun, which is all the law he has ever counted on;  and James Stewart as Rance Stoddard, the Eastern Attorney who knows things must change if they are to have a community.      One of the best of the best, and once seen, it's one you won't forget.  So for someone searching for an old movie, one that won't disappoint no matter how much time passes, this is one to view.
B000X418UE|4.0|This movie still is just great.  The picture quality on the Blu-Ray is also just outstanding.
0451196716|5.0|Stephen King has a long and wonderful career. His books are amazing, but for some reason, this book is my runaway favorite. That is for many reasons. Mostly because I can relate to it. After 18 years in the Marine Corps I know exactly what it is like to push the body and mind to it's absolute limits and with sleep deprivation. Though I was never threatend with a bullet to the head for falling out of a forced march, I never allowed myself to drop. Self-discipline is the key to success in situations such as these.<br /><br />This story is over 30 years old and I cannot imagine why it has never been made into a movie. Instead of Pet Semetary 2, or even worse 6 Children of the Corn sequals, why didn;t someone realize that not only could this be a very powerful and dramatic movie, but it could be done with a minimum cost? All you need are 100 teenagers, some dude to dress up like a major, and and soldiers riding on military vehicles. The only special effects needed would be intense death scenes, and heavy makeup for the third, fourth, and fifth day.<br /><br />Anyone reading this book will probably ask themselves if they would have the guts to do this. I also think people who read this book are naturally curious as to how far they could go. I do not think I would win, but I believe I could have made it to New Hampshire.<br /><br />Though I have read this book no less than 5 times, I still find myself unable to put it down once I start. It is a powerful book from page one and you keep turning the pages totally absorbing yourself into the situation.<br /><br />Some would say the ending is a disappointment and ends too quickly, but consider this, how would YOU end it? Walking for 5 days without sleep and watching 99 Walkers die, plus a soldier, what state would your mind be in? I wonder if after the Walk was over if Gary could even recognize Jan or his mother. Maybe this book did indeed need an epilogue, but maybe our own imaginations and suggestions of 'the day after the Walk' are more terrible than what even Stephen King could give us. It is the not knowing that gives this book an extra bit of horror. And yes I do consider this book a suspense/horror book.<br /><br />This is only one of four or five books that I have read repeatedly.even Stephen King could give us. It is the not knowing that gives this book an extra bit of horror. And yes I do consider this book a suspense/horror book.     This is only one of four or five books that I have read repeatedly.
B0010X745K|3.0|I will keep this review brief and to the point. The Mist offers up some of the most disturbing situations seen in a horror film since John Carpenter's The Thing (there's a blatant homage to that film in the opening scene). The acting is good for the most part but some of the dialogue seems forced and belongs in book form only. The sense of doom is great as are most of the visual effects. For some reason, the lead actor (Thomas Jane) makes a completely insane decision (to shock and offend the audience?) in the last 10 minutes of the film and it almost ruined the entire experience for me. -----SPOILER---- Any parent who loves their child as much as Jane's character did would NEVER in a million years murder his child to \\"spare him from a violent death by the creatures\\". As long as there is life, there is hope. So running out of gas on an abandoned road is no excuse to shoot your little boy in the head. Stupid decision by the filmmakers and it will no doubt enrage a lot of viewers. As a parent, I found this baffling and cheap. I would rather have had a pull-back shot of the earth showing the Mist covering the entire planet and a fade to black. -----END SPOILER---- There is almost no music in the film and that really adds to the realism. Overall, I may watch it again and shut if off before the final moments. The Mist minus the last 10 minutes.....That's a near perfect horror film.
B000H5V8DG|5.0|I was wary of ordering this collection because of all of the previous comments by people who received faulty copies of this set.  However, the DVDs in the collection I received were perfectly fine and have no trouble playing.  As a latecomer to the series, it was great to be able to own all five seasons at once--plus the packaging is really amazing.  I definitely recommend this set for any Alias fans!

B000UD0ESA|5.0|[[ASIN:B000UD0ESA Blade Runner - The Final Cut (Two-Disc Special Edition)]]    I have watched the entire collection and enjoyed it thoroughly.  The commentary is a bit dry and really only for those who like watching the History Channel (I do) but it gives the background to what the director was trying to convey and the struggle involved in making the movie.  Blade Runner was a film ahead of its time and it spawned a generation of film makers that were inspired by its darker vision of the future.  The movie was loosely based on the book \\"Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep\\" and was endorsed and enjoyed by the book's creator.      One question that this version answers is the question, \\"Is Deckard an android as well?\\"  To find the answer to that question you have to get this DVD and watch the commentaries.

B000LAZDQA|5.0|Hey, I'm glad you made it...<br /><br />This movie for me was and still is so very amazing in my eyes. I can't seem to stop watching it. I suggest a person that ISN'T too open not to watch this movie. Then again, it might be just the thing for you!<br /><br />Shortbus packs HIGHLY INTENSE emotion in it. Combined with HIGHLY INTENSE love scenes and sex scenes. What was so amazing about this DVD was the making of feature. John Cameron Mitchell, in 2003, had a website called \\"The Sex Project\\". It asked for people to send in audition tapes and so forth. From there, they (Film Crew) narrowed it down bit by bit until they reached 9 (I believe it was) People/auditions. They informed those people and brought them in and worked on developing the story and cast members (Personalities of the Actors and Actress's)and Script for three years, than they began filming. John Cameron Mitchell informed the cast that they will be having sex with these people and on camera.<br /><br />This Film won Two Film Festivals and A Nomination for Best Cast Ensemble.<br /><br />Genius Film I think! If you love Drama and Love. This movie is right up your alley.<br /><br />If you have problems in finding love or completeness...You're not the only one. This movie will help you coop a lot. Don't look at this like a movie look at it like this is what you need after you and your first love just broke up...<br /><br />If you also have a Immense Grudge for the MPAA, this for you. Enjoy!

For every woman out there, you are strong enough to make a difference..in your life and in the lives of others around you....  Really one of the best books i have read.

0143038419|5.0|It was surprising for me to see such negative reviews, but I can only assume that if you don't relate to this book, perhaps it's not good.  However - I absolutely loved it!  It was very descriptive and well written, to the point that I felt I had a vicarious vacation to these very interesting places.  As a 40-something woman, I could totally relate to what she was going through.  Of course the book is \\"self-absorbed\\" - it is HER journey!  You can see the mental chaos she was in at the beginning, and how going to these other very different, very dreamy places had different effects on her psyche.  I got a lot of curiosity satisfied about the romantic destinations in this book - of course, it is not a tour guide, it captures the feelings and the what-goes-on of these different destinations, which in my opinion makes it far more cool than a travel guide.  I thought some of her descriptive phrases were so funny that I laughed out loud.  I cherished my time with this book, lingering over images and insights.  The best book I've read in a long time, and I believe I will read it again.  I give it my highest recommendation - I guess especially if you are a soul searching, meaning searching, mid-life woman!  I completely related to her views towards the end a about men, and am glad she hooked up in a healthy relationship with a giving man - gosh, how cool is that?  I didn't find it gratuitous or detracting at all.
B00005JPXY|5.0|Why Cloverfield works is because it gets right what so many monster movies get wrong.  I'm not talking about the Blair Witch gimmick - Cloverfield would have still worked without that.  Cloverfield is a good movie because it takes its premise seriously.  Yes, the idea of a giant monster destroying a city is inherently ridiculous, but so what?  The American Godzilla failed because Emmerich and Devlin didn't try - they just padded out their endless movie with lots of lame humor and watered-down scares.    Cloverfield avoids the obvious pitfalls and clichés of monster movies: the inept public official, the general who just wants to blindly shoot at the monster no matter what, the scientist who explains it all.  The premise defies rational explanation, so Cloverfield just skips that part.  It relies on the oldest trick in the book: creating characters who you care about.  (You think other filmmakers would catch on to that?)    The story is about Rob, a yuppie New Yorker who is moving to Japan (inside joke) the next day.  Beth, his would-be girlfriend, shows up at his surprise party with another man.  They have a terrible fight and part badly.  Then something (possibly a terrorist attack) happens.  Beth calls Rob to ask for help - she is injured and can't move.  Rob then has to travel through the chaos to get to her.    The gimmick in this movie works brilliantly.  All the footage is from a camcorder found \\"in the area formerly known as Central Park.\\"  The brilliant thing about it is that the footage of the monster is \\"recorded over\\" the tape of Rob and Beth's first romantic day together, which allows for backstory.  (Watch the background when they are on the Ferris wheel.)  Yes, it is implausible that the camera is always on to catch just the right crucial information, but that is simply part of the premise.    I find myself thinking about this movie much more than other such entertainments.  It is obvious that Rob loves Beth deeply and I was heavily invested in his quest.  This is the type of movie that will improve with repeated viewings.
B000V6BE6M|3.0|I previously purchased the complete recordings for the Fellowship of the Ring and The Two Towers, so this completed the set.     The previous 2 also included a DVD-audio of the complete set, which I use in my car.  The DVD-a included with the Return of the King recordings is double side, and I could not tell which side is 'A' and which is 'B'.  This presents a pain because since I am listening to it in my car and the DVD-a player is in the center arm rest, I have to go through the motions of ejecting and flipping the disc while driving.      Besides that, I am happy with the purchase and quality of the music in this purchase, as well as the complete recordings for he earlier movies.
1594489505|5.0|I thought I knew how this story would end and I was glad when I was wrong--it has a much better ending (beginning?).  Hosseini is a great storyteller, and he's written another \\"must-read.\\"
B00005JPUN|3.0|You got to give this movie some credit for not being a direct scene by scene remake of the previous adaptations. For those who have seen recent remakes the majority of them rely on creating a pretty much scene by scene remake. Such movies include The Omen, Psycho, and The Amityville Horror.<br /><br /> Anyway the invasion is not a bad movie it's just that it had so much to offer that the creators couldn't decide what to do with it. Also this movie had a troubled production; originally set to be released in 2006 the movie would go through a lot of rewrites and re shoots. From what I heard the movie was going to originally have a twist ending, but it seems that it did not qualify with the studios demands. The Wachowski brothers were also hired to rewrite the initial script; aswell the director of V For Vendetta James McTeigue was  brought in to re shoot a more action ere film. The result of course is a mish mash of ideas put into one movie.<br /><br /> The movie begins with what seems to be the end of the film (don't worry i won't ruin anything important) the film later jumps into a scene where a NASA space craft crash lands with a alien life inside; if exposed to it the individual gets infected, the symptoms begin in REM sleep, the infected become a type of cocoon. As soon as they wake up they recollect the past memories of the host. Basically they seem human, look human, but they are not. The infected show no emotions. The ones who are not infected use this as an advantage to hide from them.<br /><br /> Anyway the movies central plot is pretty good it even has some edge of your seat moments. But unfortunately the creators just didn't know how to correctly develop the plot, and it shows. Such as the ending which is a complete letdown, the writers just didn't know what to do so they just ran the credits and called it an ending. Don't get me wrong the movie is good to watch once, it's just that there aren't any real surprises. it all feels very similar and formulaic.  honestly it's worth to rent and to watch once.<br /><br /> MY PERSONAL RATING: 2 ½ OUT OF 5h to rent and to watch once.      MY PERSONAL RATING: 2 ½ OUT OF 5
0525950079|4.0|Your decision to read \\"World Without End\\" will probably be influenced by many things: whether you like Ken Follett, and particularly \\"Pillars of the Earth\\"; whether you enjoy books about the plague (c'mon, who doesn't?) or historical fiction in general; maybe even by the reviews you read here. But please, for the love of god, don't let yourself be persuaded by those reviews that tear this book apart based on the a) perverted, explicit, graphic, disgusting, juvenile sex that supposedly permeates every page, and b) the author's use of modern slang words spoken by medieval characters.    The latter issue is clearly a stylistic choice made deliberately by the author. Rather than have his characters converse in \\"Ye Olde Dark Ages Speake,\\" Follett has dispensed with old-fashioned dialect altogether and instead translates everything into its modern equivalent. Thus, we have the lower-class characters using anachronistic slang that nevertheless clearly conveys both meaning and intent. Anyone arguing over whether \\"shag\\" was first used in the fifteenth or sixteenth century is missing the point. I would much rather see Follett's system adopted by other authors than suffer through more Ye Olde Speake, anyday.     As to the former - I confess, I was somewhat let down by the total lack of titillating, depraved sex that I had been promised. Seriously, people, if you consider what's in this book hardcore, you need to get out more. Yes, characters in the book do have sex. Yes, homosexuality exists. Get over it.     None of this is to say that \\"World Without End\\" is without flaws. There are plenty of them, some more egregious than others. Chief among them, I suppose, is the self-[...]: WWE is distressingly similar to PotE, right down to characters, plot lines, etc. There are historical gaffes beyond the dialect, and the supposed linchpin of the book - the effects of the Black Death on 14th century Europe - are dealt with superficially at best.     But WWE is an enormously entertaining book, one that is a breeze to read, even over a thousand pages. The characters may be archetypes - intelligent craftsman, wily serf, cruel noble, feminist nun - but you do come to care about them. If anything, I found myself wishing for more about Gwenda, the poor serf who scratches every bit of success in her life out of the dirt with her own bare hands. She's probably the most interesting (and historically accurate) of the quartet of children who grow up to become the book's main characters, but she's also given the smallest word count. Ah, well.     If you're easily offended, or if your blood pressure rises at historical anachronisms, then you'll probably have a coronary over World Without End. But if you're looking for an enjoyable, well-written story that happens to be set in one of the most tumultuous periods in history, you could do a lot worse than this book.
0790732203|4.0|When I first obtained this movie I didn't know what to expect. Many times I saw this movie lying for rent in blockbuster, it had a catchy cover but the synopsis of the back cover never caught my attention. It wasn't until one of my friends gave away a whole bunch of 80's flicks and guess what? Risky business was there; so I went ahead and gave it a chance.<br /><br />For those who are unfamiliar with the story of the movie then don't worry it's quite simple. The movie's plot revolves around the character of Joel (played by Tom Cruise) who is the ideal  son; he gets good grades, perfect attendance, top of his class, and plus he is very obedient to his parents.....until.. Both of Joel's parents decide to take a trip out of town without Joel. They leave Joel the responsibility of the house, car etc. But when Joel's friends keep pushing him to take a chance at taking risks and having a good time Joel doesn't hesitate to think twice. So up to know everything  is fun and games....until.. Joel meets a young charming prostitute named Lana (played by Rebecca de Mornay) who teaches him how to have a good time. there's a lot more story in the picture that of course is not new, it has been seen and used in many  recent teen flicks, like The Girl Next Door, Orange County, American Pie. Actually the story of this movie is very similar to that of The Girl Next Door. for example; good boy gone bad, boy meets a hot girl which he thinks is out of his league, there's a pimp involved who control's the hot girl. All of these details are reminiscent in both flicks<br /><br />As well the movie has some of the most memorable scenes, along with an awesome soundtrack from Tangerine Dream... Tom Cruise's first big staring role is still worth every penny even if it's heavily dated.<br /><br />MY PERSONAL RATING: 4 OUT OF 5
B000A59PMO|5.0|I bought this because Amazon had it at an great low price.  Seriously it was probably the best deal I have ever got on a DVD set.  Anyway the show is great fun, the writing is great, the characters are interesting as is the big mystery.  If you have never seen the show this is a great way to watch it, but be prepared because once you start watching you are going to want to watch every episode asap!
B000SO7OM0|4.0|We purchased this CD because of the connection with the Alhambra Palace in Granada, Spain, which we had recently visited and had enjoyed immensely. The music reflects the historical background of the setting perfectly with many instruments and a vocalist we had never heard of before. Quite mystical and haunting.
076781214X|3.0|I saw this trailer advertised on the Tootsie DVD, so just had to see it, as it reminded me a lot of some aspects of Back To The Future. I barely recognised Kathleen Turner, she's changed a lot in 20 years - but then again, I only really know her as Jessica Rabbit's voice, and Chandler's dad in Friends. (A woman playing a man dressed as a woman!)<br /><br />There's a few hilarious characters in this, listen to Nicolas Cage's voice - what a horrible voice it is, but apparently he based it on something else. But it's still horrible to listen to. (The hair's dodgy too!) Helen Hunt appears in a tiny role, playing Peggy Sue's daughter, although she's only 9 years younger than Kathleen Turner! Also look out for an incredibly young Jim Carrey, stealing every scene with his face pulling!<br /><br />The story is all about a girl called Peggy Sue, is going through a divorce from her childhood sweetheart, and nervous about going to her high school reunion. When she gets to her high school reunion, with her daughter as her 'date' she gets made the Queen, and faints. When she comes to, she's gone back in time by twenty five years. Back to her high school sweetheart, with even dodgier hair (!), and all her old friends. The film gets pretty basic from here on in, it's quite predictable what happens to her.<br /><br />Apart from that, it's a little gem of a film. More could have been done with it, but it's an hour and a half, and it's the perfect way to spend an afternoon. It's enjoyable, no thinking is required, and Jim Carrey is hilarious!!! Pick this up for cheap, and enjoy it. But you could also watch Back To The Future, which is better still!
0142004235|5.0|East of Eden is truly a work of art.  It is much more than a story about two families; in fact it is a sin to call it one.  The story explores concepts that are rooted within every family: love, hate, jealousy.      Drawing on the book of Genesis and the story of Cain and Abel, Steinbeck creatively weaves a tapestry of the interaction of two familial generations.  Much of the story is devoted to explain the brotherly struggles between Charles and Adam (first generation) and Caleb and Aron (second generation).      The interactions between the characters are quite amusing, as each pair of brothers try to outdo one another in order to gain their father's love.  However, in both cases, the father reluctantly favors the one with an `A' (Adam/Aron).      To say East of Eden as one of the best books ever written would be an understatement.  It is much more than a book; it is a story of life.  Don't let its length throw you off, every single page is worth it.
B000K15VSA|4.0|Dedicated fans of the Blade Runner films will appreciate this somewhat ostentatious, overly packaged \\"suitcase\\" that is little more than a big container for the set of five disks inside. The plastic unicorn and the \\"spinner\\" car are more like kids' toys than objects of serious value, but they are fun none-the-less. And the folder of lobby-style cards are nice. The really strange item, namely the 3-D plastic film strip sandwiched between two clunky pieces of clear acetate seemed curiously out of place and overdone. One might easily decide it was included just to add weight. A thin, lightweight laminated version would have sufficed just fine. The suitcase is large enough to add some of your own stuff, which is what I did. The special three-CD Vangelis music album fits perfectly with a little rearrangement. And the CDs are (coincidentally?)printed with the same special logo that appears on the DVDs themselves, for anyone who cares to notice. All in all, the quality of the DVDs and the inclusion of the 5th disk, makes this limited edition of 103,000 units well worth the extra money.
0525950079|4.0|World Without End is a worthy sequel to my beloved Pillars Of The Earth; I found the characters engaging and the plot twists exciting, as always with Ken Follett. I must admit, there were times I felt it should be called \\"Book Without End\\", because it does drag a bit here and there on the way to page 1014...but it's well worth the read! The author manages to sprinkle in  fascinating little bits of knowledge (know where the term \\"forestalling\\" comes from?) in a very interesting story- you can't ask for much more than that! I'll be hopeful for a third book in the series- I love Kingsbridge, and hope to revisit.
1895565669|5.0|This is a book I was shown as a little girl. Everytime I read it, I cry. As my children grow and become parents, I buy one for them. It says it all.
0767805712|5.0|I am a teacher aide in a high school and first saw this movie last year in one of our science classes as we were learning about DNA.....I was just taken in by it.....Great cast and I liked the movie so much that I just had to purchase it!
B000VR824S|4.0|Did not have any of the Alison Krauss performance on this, otherwise a good mix of what the day offered.
B000A59PMO|5.0|You know the best about this series? Everything. She's clever, funny, and know how to push things to help her. Despise everything that's happened to her, she's strong, and face the opponents without fear, sometimes losing and sometimes winning, but never giving up. The way she deals with her problems, fascinating. The way she destroys her enemies, astonishing. Impressive collection of episodes and cases, which will leave you in the end loving Kristen Bell.
B000UW8596|5.0|I have been trying to get a copy of this movie for awhile. It's one of the sickest films I've ever seen!
B0008JFMFG|5.0|I gotta say, it's hard to find a good dragon movie, and it's even harder to find a good dragon movie where the word \\"dragon\\" stands for \\"scale-covered reptilian monster with a breathe attack, commonly fire\\" rather than \\"Jackie Chan's style of martial arts\\" It's harder still for said movie to be aimed at adults rather than little kids. That being said, this movie, is AWESOME!! The dragons look and behave like dragons should (no cartoony looks or low IQ's), the humans use guns and tanks instead of karate, and the action scenes are actually pretty dang good. I never thought I'd say this, especially not so soon, but there is, in fact, a movie better than \\"Final Fantasy 7: Advent Children\\". And that movie is called \\"Reign of Fire\\".
038073186X|5.0|Character development, details, clever plot, action and suspense, this novel has them all. You will enjoy reading Shutter Island; it is one of the rare books that I have read twice.  I did not guess the ending and the twist was breathtaking.  This is a stand alone novel, not part of Mr. Lehane's Boston P.I. series. I passed this book along to a friend confident I brightened his reading day.
B0000VCZKM|5.0|I looked for this movie at discount stores and it wasn't there. I was so glad to find it for a reasonable price at Amazon .com  Carol Burnett is the funniest Miss Hannigan ever. Albert Finny is truly Daddy Warbucks in the flesh. What a great little actress Aileen Quinn is. She is both tough and tender.
0307387178|3.0|Jon Krakauar is a great author and the book is beautifullly written (the reason I gave it a 3 Star rating).    However, this book is a typical example of someone who failed to adapt to modern society. I am sure that Chris McCandless was a gifted and charming young man, but someone who had great difficulty accepting today's society (with all its admitted flaws).    The only factor that distinguished Chris from all the other dead young people was that he died in the wilderness of Alaska; most other young people with similar perspectives usually end up with drug overdoses.    And a few others end up like the unabomber (minus the bombs)    And while his death seems pointless, I feel that Chris was too mentally falwed (for some unknown reason) to lead a 'typical successful' life.
1594489505|5.0|Loved this beautiful story about love, loss, and courage.  It makes me realize how good we have it, and what goes on outside in the real world.
B00005JPD0|5.0|Great entertainment.  An action thriller - at the film's opening, a large Mississippi River ferry in New Orleans is destroyed by a bomb.  An ATF agent played by Denzel Washington arrives on scene to join the huge investigation.<br /><br />I don't like to give away plots and ruin it for future viewers, so I'll just say that what follows is fascinating and involves time travel.  Notwithstanding that time travel is actually impossible, the subject is handled intelligently in this film, and the \\"what if's\\" are handled well.<br /><br />Well casted (Denzel, lovely Paula Patton, light work by Val Kilmer, and James Caviezel in a much darker role).  Well acted, budgeted, directed, and filmed.  One of those that you have to pay attention to so as not to get left behind, but reasonably so.  Rated PG-13, but the rare nudity is muted and I can't actually recall any offensive language.  No sex.  Some violence, but no gratuitous slasher stuff.<br /><br />Nicely done. So pay attention, and enjoy.
B000VNMMR0|5.0|i bought this item for my boyfriend i do not know if it is good or not but it must be because i boyfriend wanted it really bad so i bought it
B00026WU4G|2.0|wow - reading the reviews here it strikes me that the forum is populated only by Dylan obsessives. To me this is a musically average album with the odd beautiful song among many  - well -  just average compositions.    Sweetheart Like You is beautiful but don't songs like Union Sundown sound as clumsy as any eighties songs with contemporary political messages?    Why can't dylan lovers simply acknowlegde he did good bad and average work and this is decidedly in the middle to latter category.
B000MNP2KI|5.0|david is a hottie i bought this movie for my boyfriend for christmas im going to watch it soon i was told its a good movie
B00005JKHP|4.0|This film is the epitome of Star Trek in theme and direction.  Alan Dean Foster visualized the perfect Star Trek show.  Much of the original TV series is prevalent in this movie.      If you are looking for a lot of action, don't bother.  This is science fiction in it's true sense, the effort of a movie to predict the future with terrific detail and science orientation.  The Star Trek original motion picture is all about the future that occurs when a machine society encounters Voyager 6, a truly fiction element, and comes for Earth looking for it's creator.  Little does this machine know that man is the origin of V-ger, Voyager 6.  The story carries great credibility through the character of Spock, the genius Vulcan who seeks perfect logic.  He finds it in V-ger and discovers that it is not enough.  V-ger likewise discovers that logic is not enough.    From there a new Star Trek phenomenon is born.    This is the greatest of the 10 Star Trek movies by far.  Although I give credit to movies 2, 6 and 8, I believe that this one carries the original of Star Trek to its ultimate end: the discovery of new life.  If you can enjoy a somewhat dry set of scenes, then this movie is for you.

B000W8OM5Y|5.0|Legends are rarely fully exploited with honor in film.  But, Mel Gibson establishes a legend here that will move audiences for generations.  There are some minor flaws in the film (where did the spears come from at Stirling?) but overall it is excellently imagined and portrayed.  The combat is grisly and powerful.    I'm not going to go into the story much, as I feel that providing spoilers really detracts from a review.  In this film are some cliched approaches to medieval legend.  Oppressive king.  Valiant rebel.  Woman in danger.  There are also a few stereotypes that are not necessary for the advancement of the story.  Overall, though, this is one of the most powerful emotional dramas I've ever watched.  Normally action films are short on drama.  Mel Gibson doesn't fall into that trap here.    What is truly remarkable is the sympathy garnered for the lead character, William Wallace, who loses everything when he only desires to have peace and raise a family.  His response to not having what he desires is overwhelming and precisely expressed.  When he loses everything at the point of a knife, he rebels against everything that comes from the English king.  He takes the absolute position that so long as there is no justice then there will be no peace for the English tyrant.    This is an epic movie that was long overdue from the movie industry.  It is epic and legendary for the stunning visual effects.  The battle scenes are powerful looks at what battles from that era were probably like, although the specific geography for the actual effort at revolt is rejected in order to make the combat more grand and powerful.    In the end the legendary Wallace is elevated to almost Messianic levels and the audience is driven to a white hot passion for freedom and patriotism.    This is probably the best work Mel Gibson ever contributed to the movie world.  Highly recommended.
B000W1V44I|5.0|they sound alot older so of course its not as teeny bopper sounding. beautiful sound, sexy voices, relaxing to listen too. what more could you ask for.
B000TGJ8IU|5.0|This is the best epic action film since Braveheart, even better than Gladiator.  Brad Pitt as Achilles is so convincing you will not doubt the legend of the man one bit.    I could go on and on about the greatness of this film.  I could also go on and on about it's flaws.  I will, however, concentrate on one statement:    Troy has the greatest single combat footage I've ever seen in a movie as the fight between Hector (Eric Bana) and Achilles is the true climax of this great action film.      The athletic prowess taking place between Bana and Pitt is so convincing that you are certain the two are actually fighting it out for real.  It never occurs to the viewer that the scene is pure acting by professionals who know how to spoof up a scene to capture an audience's attention.  What a fight this was.  It didn't carry on too long and it wasn't too short.  The timing and moves of the action are emotively powerful.  The only flaw is that it's clear from the beginning that Achilles is going to win the confrontation.  That doesn't detract, however, from the power of this combat sequence.  I recommend that this film is watched just for this few minutes worth of highlight.      But, beware when watching this film.  You might decide that you like all of it despite some overacting at some parts and some serious revisionism of the original Greek myth story.  It is an action myth that is well worth watching at least once.  Get the Director's Cut and watch the extended movie.  You'll be more than satisfied and I'll almost guarantee that for you.
B0000027RL|5.0|This is one of my favorite top three albums of ALL TIME. It is hard to follow up to the success of the first one, Pearl Jam has now gotten back to their roots of what got them where they started. It sounds great and makes me remember the times that I had in the late 80's and early 90's. I thoroughly enjoyed EVERY SONG on this disk.
B000PMGS8G|4.0|Certain movies stay with you long after you've seen them, and I can happily say that Flash Gordon is one of them. In order to appreciate the beauty of this science fiction gem from 1980, you must first recognize the screenwriter's background. Lorenzo Semple Jr. wrote this, and not too many years before he delivered the campy Batman television series that thrilled us children growing up in the late 60's. Well, all the campiness of that series works its way into this script, and translates into an almost comic book feel on the screen. Not coincidentally, Semple also wrote the campy screenplay to the remake of King Kong in 1976. You can sense that same type of purposeful corniness here. Although the cast is almost secondary to the characters depicted, they do a decent job with the material here. I'm glad the people who gave us Flash Gordon didn't try to take themselves or the nature of their product too seriously. As a bonus, and a defining bonus at that, we have the soundtrack delivered to us by Queen. It all adds up to a classic romp through the genre, and it only had the misfortune of being released between the first two Star Wars motion pictures. The special effects never quite achieve \\"special\\" status, but who cares? The lovers of Flash Gordon will always hold this one to heart closely.
B000ATQYT2|5.0|This story became an instant holiday tradition in my home.  As my girls grew up, we watched the tape over and over.  Last year it was lost and we didn't know what to do.  Thank you for putting this out on disc so my grandchildren can now share in the magic it brings us all.
B00000G3AZ|5.0|This was delightful!  I have never read the book, so it was completely new to me and I wasn't disappointed.  All the characters had positive qualities and I couldn't help but like them. The scenery was also breathtaking.
0143038419|5.0|I can only read a little at a time without being interupted by my Toddler, however, this book is a great read and searches the soul of a woman who is going through some changes in her life by capturing her travels, eating and finding that prayer works for her in ways that she could not imagine. Not preachy whatsoever, just a great inspirational read.  Recommended for all woman and men too!
B00005JOHC|5.0|[[ASIN:B00005JOHC Two and a Half Men - The Complete First Season]]I find this very entertaining....a must have to be watched over and over for great laughs every time.  What a good cast.  I recommend it and can be easily watched over and over....Two brothers trying to live together after one is divorced, mix in a pre-teen son, a grumpy housekeeper, a very interesting stalker neighbor, the perfect mother for such a group....this leads to a great show and obviously great writers....
0439813786|5.0|This is one of those books that comes along once in a long while.  I am reading this with my 6 and 8 year old sons right now and were are all mesmerized by the plot, the writing and the amazing drawings. As Selznick says, Hugo Cabret is and isn't quite a picture book, graphic novel and text-based novel.  This form is something new. I imagine will be emulated in the future. As boundaries between disciplines dissolve, Hugo is a great way to reach young minds...minds that want stimulation from both visual and text forms.  This book is incredible.
0670034711|1.0|To quote a phrase from the \\"Italy\\" section of this book, \\"cross the street\\" if you dare to even glance in a bookstore window and entertain a thought of buying this book. Elizabeth Gilbert has no ideas about life. Not only does she have nothing to teach, she has nothing to say. This book is so vicarious that it reveals a profound and deeply disturbing ignorance about the complexities of real life.        The author's observations about life are simplistic and her insights so embarrassingly undeveloped and unsophisticated that she comes across as a detached observer. There are very few passages in this book that reveal any real sense of transformation in her life. She never really seems to glean anything authentic or deeply affecting from any of her experiences. And because she has gained nothing, she has nothing to offer. The reader is frustrated and unable to connect with her on any level. This memoir not only lacks readability, it lacks any real humanity.        She is right when she says that she is not a traveler; she does not have the heart or spirit of a true traveler because she somehow remains deeply unaffected. She is more of a tourist, a spectator, barely scratching the surface of the lands she traverses, the people she encounters, and the experiences of what it means to be human.       In spite of her year long journey she is still unable to gain true insight or wisdom from her pain and struggle. After laboring through the book, I would guess that she is actually incapable of real growth. There is no profoundness in her journey, whether it be personal or physical. This book is just a simple walk through a simple mind. She is not even a good enough writer to be able to cleverly disguise her childlike observations in beautifully crafted language. I would rather read the trail journals of a young backpacker anyday. At least they are 'real.'        After reading the book, I wondered how it found it's way to the bestseller list. I was perplexed by its popularity. So I did some research. As it turns out \\"Eat, Pray, Love\\" is an ideal industry example of how a publishing company can \\"create\\" a best seller from the printing of a trade paperback. In hard cover, this book only generated mediocre book sales in the year in was published. However, someone at Penguin adopted it as a \\"darling\\" and created a hard core campaign to sell the trade paperback.       \\"l'arte d'arrangiarsi\\" the art of making something out of nothing! (p.61 \\"Eat, Pray, Love.\\")
B00004W3L3|5.0|At a time when the front leading Prog bands of the 1970's were either fading away (King Crimson, ELP) or adrift without a clear vision of what they wanted to accomplish (i.e. Genesis), Marillion (with Fish) took over the lead in progressive rock and delivered this masterpiece, giving Prog a much needed shot in the arm. MISPLACED CHILDHOOD has it all: a great story, intricate yet beautiful lyrics and incredibly amazing melodies. Those who love the Peter Gabriel era of Genesis, specifically SUPPER'S READY, will love this album.
B00005MCX0|4.0|I heard this in about 9th Grade back in the 70's and I own the Vinyl copy. Master of the Universe is probably my favorite track. OK, \\"Shouldn't do that\\" does go on for a long time but it's a trip. This music will appeal to those that want to achieve a certain state of mind. This is spaced-out metal for those that like to explore the outer fringes of music. Not recommended for the middle-of-the-road crowd.

B0002KVUKM|4.0|When you want to make one more film on Dracula who counts several hundred films already, both as assets and as drawbacks, you have to be original. No problem ! Let's patchwork together dozens of allusions to other films and create the first ever vampiristic salad. So Dr Frankenstein and his creature will be there.<br /><br />The use of the lightning to get electricity like in Back to the Future 1. The use of strange weapons halfway between Back to the Future 3 and The Lord of the Rings. The costume, dress, apparel of Van Helsing looks like Clint Eastwood's in a spaghetti western, and at times like the main hero's in the Matrix trilogy. The cows in the village are similar to those in Salem's Lot 2.<br /><br />Even the dance scene with the vampire reflected in a half empty mirror is borrowed from Dance of the Vampires. I would need a volume to quote them all. So what's left after all that composing of tidbits? A superhero Van Helsing who kills Dracula's three fianc&eacute;es, the thousands of baby vampires that look like upside down Aliens in their suspended pods, and Dracula himself. And all that on the order from the Vatican, the Pope and the good old godly Catholic church.<br /><br />That's a counter-allusion to the Da Vinci Code. The film then is more dictated in its plot by the brand new topnotch state of the art digitalized image processing of the modern world than the reverse. So the plot is a vast ballet between mountains and from abysses to cosmic skies.<br /><br />It is thus an amusing entertainment as shallow as the Thames River twenty kilometers before its spring. Or is it the Mississippi river?<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU
1594489505|5.0|After \\"The Kite Runner\\" I didn't quite know what to expect from this author's second novel.  His first book was entirely from a male point of view.  In \\"A Thousand Splendid Suns,\\" we see Afghanistan during the same period of time as \\"Kite,\\" but from the viewpoint of two females, and it is an even more tragic--almost unbearably tragic.  Some reviewers, I note, have assailed the book because it is laced with sentiment--but the sentiment never seemed forced to me.  Life for women in Kabul during this era of the Russians, the Mujahadeen, the warlords and the Taliban was anything but serene.  To be sure, it wasn't much better, by all accounts, for men.    The plot is relatively straight forward:  two very different women married to an ignorant, egotistic slob during a time of crisis.  The characters are depicted about as well as I have ever seen in a novel.  I know them all now, and they will never leave me.  The atmosphere of this unfortunate nation, oppressed by religious stupidity and male dominance is most unpleasant, but I've seen no reliable accounts of the time that contradict it.  The dialogue is excellent.  In fact, I cannot point to any flaw in the work.    And that brings me to the prose itself.  Husseini has the ability to tell the reader volumes by what he writes and by what he omits.  That may sound strange to anyone who has not read the book, but it is true.  I'll give one example:  a VCR tape appears near the end, and the person who views it does not understand why, although the reader does without being told.  It is a very touching moment.  There are several other examples I could give.  Too often writers feel they have to rub the readers noses in something, lest he not \\"get it.\\"    In summary, this is a truly great piece of work.  Despite that, it isn't a book for every reader.  There's no great uplifting of the spirit, no provocative sex scenes, no walking into the sunset of a better world.  I realize that some intelligent readers want more pleasant books.  But then neither \\"War and Peace\\" nor \\"Rebecca\\" nor a host of other fine novels are pleasant reads with soft landings for the hero and heroine.
B000UBMWG4|5.0|Des séquences à vous couper le souffle. La beauté des effets spéciaux, plus réalistes que le meilleur du numérique. Le plus complet, avec les différentes versions, des documentaires... multilangues. A posséder dans sa collection. Une pièce maîtresse.
0743554450|4.0|The audio reading of this book was beautiful.  I think it added to the story tremendously.  The reader's articulation of words gave life to the already strong story.  I highly recommend listening to the audio version.
B000MRAAJM|5.0|Le seul moyen de visionner ce documentaire de qualité en Europe, puisque multizone. A posséder. Peut-être un des derniers témoignages vivant de notre planète.
B000I2J0VK|4.0|I have nothing to say about Kubrick's masterpiece; it closes his life's achievement with a mischievous question to modern man... are you up to the challenge?\\"    Regarding the HD version I have mixed feelings; I expected a lot more. Yes, the quality is way above regular DVD. Yes, it is the unrated version. No, it does not look like in the movies... there is grain in the image. Then again maybe it is the negative... who knows!    I guess I still would buy the HD edition... there is nothing like Kubrick's care for storytelling.
B00005LK94|5.0|This is one of my grandson's favorite movies.  He loves the geese but I think he gets the biggest kick out of a young girl getting to fly an ultralight by herself over such a distance.  I love the music and always wipe a tear at the end.
B000VDDDVO|4.0|So good to have both color and black and white versions of the film. I have never been a fan of colorisation, but the color version here is quite appealing, especially as this film has suffered for years in bad prints never looking as good as it does here.<br /><br />In retrospect I am not sure the film deserves quite the masterpiece status it has acquired over the years. The storyline seems a little clunky today , but there is no denying its charm and there never has or ever will be anyone quite as wonderful as Jimmy Stewart.
067101756X|3.0|One has to give Philip Corso the benefit of his credentials and security clearance. The dramatic or poetic opening and closing seems a bit quaint but the environmental dark does swallow you up at night out there in the deserts of New Mexico.     There is some circumstantial \\"evidence\\" put forward, like the cover/contact lens of the aliens eyes that also makes one wonder if he saw the, now exposed, fake alien autopsy movie.  Still, it is probable but there is no proof or evidence.  Others might argue that much of the technology discussed was already under way by the time of the early 50's and 60's.     It is a good read and i find the video interviews with Corso, that i have seen, to be quite credible in his mannerism - reflecting a man of his previous experience and positions.  The bottom line, Corso says that there was a vehicle that crashed, and bodies were recovered.
B000OYC7A8|5.0|David Gilmour is indeed the voice of Pink Floyd. He sounds exactly the same as he did 40 years ago! Phenomenal recording ... get it!
B000X1Z0BU|5.0|My review title sums it up pretty well, I think.  This is a brilliant concept in the movie-musical genre.  The music is integrated naturally within the storyline instead of being imposed from outside.  And what a wonderful choice, to have the actors be the very artists who wrote the music!  This works all the better and makes for such touching and tender scenes because the actors were in the process of falling in love during the filming.  There is a palpable chemistry between Marketa and Glen throughout, and at the end, you feel that you've experienced something truly rare, human, and beautiful.  And what can I say about the music that hasn't already been said?  These are gorgeously haunting melodies that will stick in your mind long after the movie is over.  A couple of the songs, Falling Slowly and If You Want Me, are Oscar contenders this year.      By the way, Marketa's character replies in Czech to Glen's question \\"Do you love your husband?\\"  She says, \\"Miluju tebe.\\" and then refuses to translate.  So, he never knows what she said.  You can look it up!  This and some other plot details that I won't go into lead me to disagree with some other reviewers here who say this movie is all about \\"friendship.\\"  I think instead it's about something a little more complex.
B000K7VHQ4|5.0|The film is well above average and keeps you thinking all the way through.  The period setting is accurate and the acting excellent.  There is no foul language and a short sexual segment that is within the bounds of good taste.  Highly recommended by us.
B00005JPTI|3.0|Interesting mostly for the haunting view of an abandoned New York City, \\"I Am Legend\\" follows Will Smith as he tries to redeem himself for his part in unleashing a devastating plague on the world. For the first 2/3'rds of the movie, it's very affecting. Dr Neville (Smith) and dog Sam prowl an abandoned Manhattan, sharing the space with deer, lions and other critters.<br /><br />It's those other critters that amp up the middle of the movie, as Smith does a major boo-boo and grabs a female zombie-mutant plague victim who happens to be best gal pal to the alpha zombie. Seems Dr Neville needs to run tests on muties if he will find a cure and save mankind, yet for some romantic reason, alpha zombie wants his baby back. This conflict made for the best part of \\"I Am Legend,\\" but the film did not have the good sense to leave it at that. After three years alone with the dark-seekers, another pair of real live humans make it to NYC, and then the film stumbles.<br /><br />I won't go beyond this point, because all other plotlines follow from that moment. What was a strong lead character to this point suddenly gets muddled up, and all the cool CGI in the world can't make drama from stale pudding. However, for the scenes of Smith grooving on Bob Marley and the meditation on \\"Shrek,\\" this is a pretty good mid-level Science Fiction movie. Frankly, he was better in [[ASIN:B00005JN0T I, Robot]], where the CGI didn't overwhelm the real people.
B00003CXXP|4.0|Thoughtful sci-fi story about a robot boy (played by Haley Joel Osment) who wants to become a real boy like in the story Pinocchio so that the woman who purchased him (whom he considers his mother) will love him like she loves her real son. An intelligent sci-fi tear jerker from Steven Spielberg who as usual knows exactly what he is doing. A near faultless movie - ruined only by subplots involving Jude Law that don't go anywhere and a final scene that I felt could have been a bit better - that is emotionally satisfying and far superior to I, Robot (a film with a similar theme of whether robots should be treated like human beings). Spielberg went on to make the also excellent Minority Report the following year, so he was clearly on a roll. Very nearly 5 stars out of 5.
B000MRAAJM|4.0|Este producto llevara su nuevo sistema de alta definicion al extremo que usted queria llegar. Es un documental muy instructivo e interesante, apto para toda la familia. La calidad de imagen es sumamente superior al formato dvd, los datos informativos son muy detallados y diversos. Esta serie definitivamente no debe faltar en su coleccion. Las unicas fallas encontradas es que no posee audio en espa~ol apesar de que si posee subtitulos y el case no sostiene los discos en su lugar como deberia hacerlo.
B000R5N1MC|5.0|The collections it's really great, the extras are spectacular, don't miss this item, it's a most if you are a fan.    The beauty about the good science fiction it's that craft a poetic view of our self, a world were we can achieve the edge of our potential.    Here we are talking about one of the most influential pictures in all the movie history.  \\"Ghost in the Shell\\", \\"The Matrix\\", \\"Akira\\", \\"The Fifth Element\\", and many others, don't exist whit out this Sci-fi epic, that's put the cyberpunk literary genera on movies (please don't William Gibson forget \\"Neuromancer\\" as indispensable contribution of the genera) , and established its self as a cannon.      More than 25 years after its release this movie looks all brand new. like Citizen Kane, Casablanca or Lawrence of Arabia, because like any other truly master peace it's a reflection of his own time, also it is a critic, to all the previous and subsequent art, at the same time it is a critic to itself, that's why the real classics are above of time and space and always feels alive.    Ridley Scot creates an indispensable cult reference. understand perfectly Phillip K. Dick short story (besides he refuse to ever read the original story), and all the Sci-fi of the 60's and 70's, we present a perfect distopia, like any boroughs character, Dekard is tiered of the decadence sounded him, besides that, but in a small way the big corporations made some small rolls, you can see, trade marks like Coca-Cola, Panam, Malboro, and many others.     He used technology as a stetic and artistic element also as part of the narrative structure. The incredible and retro productions design, set decoration, the avant garde special effects, the cloths, the vehicles, the voight kamp treatment device, in resume, any visual idea, any object in film transport you to a dream reality, to a nostalgic space in side your brain.    Harrison Ford and Rutter Hauer crafted awesome performances. Also, the rest of the cast are perfect, I can not imagineany other actor to play the role of some of which they appear in the film.    The groundbreaking soundtrack of the Vangelis, put the right atmosphere. When you hear the music its make you feel like if you're  looking to a Rene Magritte canvas. Its the world that you see whit your eyes every day, but something it is not correct in some subconscience level, and annoying you in a very subtle way, also developed in side you the sensation of expansion whit out not boundaries.    This its truly science fiction, no fantasy like Star Wars (I am saying this not as an insult, its only editorial comparation), because Blade Runner talks about human condition, if you read the screen play and tray to made a resume of the plot, you only would see the history of a police officer who tray to kill some replicants (androids), but if you made a reflection, you will see that this picture represents the internal and eternal fight to try to define the essence of the human condition, using a futurist scene and characters in parts of robots with human actions and emotions to make patent the point in comment, all time  you know that robots don't exist, as they appear in the movie, but at the same time you can't avoid to identify your self whit the characters, and to see with greater clarity your own complexity in the process.              You can't understand any Sci-fi movie and any movie, whit out this poetic and beautiful masterpiece.
0765318741|5.0|The book contains the 1954 novella, I Am Legend, and ten superb short stories. It cannot be emphasized enough that Richard Matheson literally wrote the book on the modern horror genre.<br /><br />The romp through vampires, politics and war in I Am Legend will draw many new readers - due to the recent runaway smash movie with the same title - but the terror of The Near Departed and the giggling secret weapons of the military, Witch War, are brilliant. The raw hate, survival and murder in Prey must be read several times to fully appreciate Matheson's art of taking the reader on a roller-coaster ride of emotions.<br /><br />Few books can truly be pointed to as groundbreaking works of art. This is one of a mere handful.
B000A2XC1C|4.0|Still a great movie. Not as great as I remember, but Dudley Moore is great in it. Makes a nice change from the stuff normally on tv at Christmas.
B000VSBX34|5.0|Truly a wonderful walk down memory lane!  Reminds us of the good old days when you could just be entertained with good music and typical Beatles antics.  So glad we were able to get it.
B000VNMMQ6|5.0|The 4th installation of the Die Hard series is a must have movie for any movie collection. Blu-ray is awesome if you have the TV to do it justice. Bruce Willis is at his original Die Hard best. This is one of the best action movies ever because it is infused with comedy, a rare find done so well. I'd buy it again.
B00004Z4WQ|4.0|Guys! if you have seen \\"Scream\\" and \\"I know what u did last summer\\" then this movie would be the best ever seen comedy movie for u. I would call it the dangerous comedy movie. It is actually the parody of classic horror movies filled with \\"high end vulgar comedy\\" by Wayan brothers.
B00102F5WK|4.0|The film's main goal is entertainment, but it is nicely filled with political overtones that are truly thought-provoking. The cast makes up for a great ensemble, they all provide great performances. Nice international cast, by the way. This is a movie that unfortunately didn't do much business in theatres but sure is going to have a second life on home entertainment. It deserves to be seen.
0321344758|5.0|Brilliant book.  Very easy to read and digest, infact wonderful usability.  I highly recommend this to anyone who builds website from the beginner to the advanced professional.
0142000655|5.0|A biblical parallel to the stories of Cain and Abel and the Original Sin, East of Eden is written by John Steinbeck in the 1950s. Steinbeck beautifully captures the social and economic atmospheres of the late 19th to early 20th centuries, and gives an honest depiction of man's struggle in a society. There was no fluff or buffer as Steinbeck presents only the very truth in this novel. From Adam Trask's generation to that of his sons', they all faced the challenge of surpassing their inner fears and jealousy. This constant struggle truthfully conveys an ever-existing problem that remains unsolved today.<br />  Once I look past its daunting appearance (a whopping 762 pages!), this book is definitely a page-turner with its complex plotlines and dynamic characters. While there is a distinct climax (Cal, enraged and jealous when his father rejects Cal's gift of $15,000, takes out his anger on Aron by telling him about their mother's life as a prostitute and takes him to see Cathy at her brothel), the rest of the eventful novel retains a high interest level throughout with constant twists and turns.<br />  Steinbeck also introduces the interpretation of the ultimate message of the story, centering on the Hebrew word \\"timshel.\\" When Samuel Hamilton reads one translation of the story, the story seems slanted, but as Lee finally reveals through his investigations, the word is not a command, but rather a choice \\"thou mayest.\\" The original sin was the choice of humans, but Cain, and now Cal, can choose for themselves to overcome the inherent evil within them by taking a stand. They will never be perfect, but from now on, they can seek what they know is right.<br />  This novel is a pleasant surprise as compared to other Steinbeck's novels I have read - most of all however, is that it has worn off my mentality that John Steinbeck = dull. East of Eden is anything but dull.
B000I5X81K|5.0|Awake CD is Breathtaking and Touching..    Josh Groban has once again demonstrated why people refer to him as The Voice.  This young singer, only 26 years old, has managed to rip our hearts out again with his powerful voice on this CD.  Experimenting with different types of music - Groban is creative, imaginative, sensitive, and brilliant - taking us to places we haven't even considered with these songs.     This CD has drawn thousands to the huge arenas just to hear him sing them.  Which I might add, is an experience one would never forget. I traveled to two different states and one country just to hear him. His voice - although it was already breathtaking - has matured to an even deeper beauty since his last CD.       We can always depend on Josh to give us something new and wonderful through his music - sharing part of his soul with us.  I can't wait for his next CD.      Be sure to check out Noel too - even if it is past Christmas - I'm still listening to mine.
B00005M91K|4.0|I think this is a good wrap up of the 3 \\"qatsi\\" movie set but truly I recommend watch all those first.  Watch them all with friends and family to strike up some good conversation.  This one being newer has better quality sound and picture but I feel more energy from the classic qatsi's.
0061547832|4.0|This book offers good advice for all. As with any book, not all of the content will apply to each reader, but enough of it goes beyond mere commonsense and presents the valuable experience of someone who has had the courage to think big, make deals, and learn from their successes and mistakes. You could read a lot of books with complex theories that are hard to put into practice in your life without making you feel creepy, like you are trying to be someone else, but this book is written in simple language from the heart. Buy it, read it, and you will benefit.
