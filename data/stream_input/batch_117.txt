B0056Y339U|5|These jeans are classics, and it's so great to get them in an uncommon size. 35's are a perfect fit for my hubby, and they are not easy to find in stores.
B00062NHC0|4|A bit more expensive but fits well lasts long and has softer cotton than hanes. This word requirement keeps me from reviewing products
B00M9HYRJM|4|Very good quality
B0008EOAZ4|5|Bought this pants for work. It's thick and can be used as casual dress as well. Gotta love Amazon :)
B00816NSXQ|2|i purchased this product thinking that this was a 6 pack of black underwear because of the photograph. this is a multi-colored package with only one black pair of underwear, 2 beige, 1 brown, 1 pink, and 1 white. i specifically searched for black only.
B00MF1CIG6|3|Really like the looks of this sweater, unfortunately when it arrived and I tried it on, it fits a little larger than a medium.  I usually purchase mediums and they fit fine, this particular line fits somewhat large...to give you and idea, I am a average built male, 5'8&#34; and weigh 166 lbs and the sweater still is a bit large...
B00SA9SLIG|5|Very good!<br />Soft and comfortable!
B004Q2SZ8M|2|2 seams were ripped when inspected upon opening.<br />nice fabric, could be a little better sewn so they<br />could improve quality
B00G4CUFG2|4|Very soft... Good fit.... Launders well.... Dryer OK.
B00910V62Q|5|Thank you i love it its a gift im sure he will love it
B00CUZOGPI|5|Size 30 ran kinda small. Size 31 fit like a glove (perhaps I'm getting fat).<br /><br />On a side note, rarely size 31 fits me well, I usually get a somewhat tight 30 or a VERY loose 31 but, in this case size, size 31 was perfect.<br /><br />Anyway, EXCELLENT fit.<br /><br />The color isn't as *light* as the picture it's slightly darker.
B00FD2LZYA|5|This purchase was a gift. Dr. Who is this person's favorite show. I bought all the socks that Amazon offered.
B00T3O2EVM|5|One of the most beautiful blouses I have seen! Such a wonderful purchase
B003TY1ZVC|1|I'm not sure how \\"Extra Thick\\" translates from English to Korean, and vice-versa, but these are a FAR CRY from thick, let alone EXTRA thick.  These are like thin running socks, NOT like cushioned walking socks.
B0094KM1MC|5|i had to get it tailored…shoulders were WAY too broad.  other wise quality was awesome
B000783OGW|4|small fit but good quality.
B0072J9UQC|2|Too tight in the leg - and this is just an average school boy - not a bulked up dude.<br />Too huge in the waist
B00SGRZSRY|5|LOVE this dress. I've received compliments both times of worn it. It is fun a colorful but still office appropriate.
B00GVH6OKQ|5|warm and cozy
B00DGK0HLI|3|These are nice, the inseam is perfect for me. However, these pants sit high on the waist and it's a lot snugger than expected, which makes them a little uncomfortable as the day goes by.
B00AI3C3PE|4|There are some sticky hairs,But the price is cheap.
B00EAK3MMO|3|As other reviewers have mentioned, the turtleneck is a deal killer.  Sooooo tight.  Fits similar to the Patty Boutik Boat Neck Cocktail Sheath, but shows more lumps and bumps in the hip/thigh area.
B003U6II6Y|5|Looks smart and sexy. Perfect for either the day or a casual night out. The material is neither too flimsy nor too thick, and the neckline detailing give it an interesting flair without making it too &#34;hipster&#34;.  The other reviewers are spot on about sizing ... I usually wear a medium but ordered a large and it fits perfectly.
B0081O9PC6|5|Fabric is very soft and comfortable<br />The standard size<br />Dress fits me well<br />I really like this pair of jeans
B0010VF6R0|5|My waist size is 29in. Medium size fits perfect. Good quality.
B0049HMMQ0|5|I was looking for some wool socks to keep my feet from freezing. These are very warm and soft. Since I live in the United States and these socks come from Canada I didn't understand the washing instructions all there was on the label was small icons that I had no idea what they meant. I emailed the company and in very little time they responded back. They said the socks are machine washable and dry able. I wash in cold water and dry on the lowest setting. They haven't shrunk at all. Since they are a little big (I wear a size 7 woman's shoe)I wonder if I washed in warm if I could control the amount of shrinkage.
B0089KLB4W|5|Bought several pairs of Levi's Big Boy's Slim jeans and all are very comfy and nice looking.  Will buy more if more style are available.
B002M3TKKE|4|These are well manufactured briefs, of the quality you'd expect from the Fruit of the Loom brand. They are a bit small for the nominal size, but maybe that's why you call them tighty whities. The size 6 fit my five year old fine.<br /><br />They all feature the faces and torsos of various Marvel universe superheroes such as Captain America or Iron Man on the large back side panel. I would have preferred the symbols of the heroes instead, which would have made these more like costumes than fan clothing. Many heroes have a recognizable emblem such as Spider Man's spider, Captain America's star, Wolverine's stripes, etc. and that would have made these fun instead of just commercially exploitive of the character.<br /><br />Also, it's been my experience that this type of printing does not wear well and will eventually crack, blur, and fade, but then again children grow out of these things fast.<br /><br />Regardless, they do their job as underpants with reasonable comfort, so you can buy with confidence.
B008HHUQRK|5|For anyone who has LUPUS - this is the BEST hat EVER. Do not BUY this hat at fancy retail stores! I bought this same hat for<br />triple the amount listed on Amazon. BEST hat!
B004TQI9DG|1|Terrible fit, thin material. These pants are horrible. Rise is very low. I cannot bend over without showing my back side. Are these jeans designed for women? Carhartt, get it together.
B00VBPQ4U8|4|It's a nice levis shirt, exactly as it looks in the photo. I was looking for a light gray denim with a fabric that isn't too thick (something I can wear in spring or fall weather). It's not thin either, just right, and made with a sturdy 100% cotton material. So I'm a satisfied customer.<br />And as everyone noted, it is one size too small.<br />If you wear a medium usually, just get a large. Done!
B00KT0ZCUE|5|Great suit!  Love the fit and look....
B0013UMQYO|5|I have been buying Hagar slacks for several years and find them durable and comfortable.
B00G4OZEWU|2|runs very small, and cheap made
B004S2MSWO|5|I bought this as a special gift for a wonderful friend who is currently fighting breast cancer.  She LOVED it!  The quality is excellent.  Very well made.
B00DTQFGOM|4|I got this jacket for my son and he loves it the lining is really warm.And he said it zips up nice
B00K5STQCK|1|These are not original Genie bras! They are ripoff copies. I have originals (purchased at Sam'so Club) and love them. These have different and inferior padding in the bra cups. The pads are thin, white triangles of hard foam that don'the fully line the cup, leaving lumpy marks under the bra cup where they end. Not attractive and defeats the purpose of a smooth, lined cup. Originals have a soft type of spongy foam that is a curved hemisphere to follow the natural shape of the cup and fill it fully. These bras are also made of a scratchier type of nylon material that feels uncomfortable on the skin. Originals have both softer and thicker material. The stitching pattern is different. These are sewn with zigzag hemming. Originals are straight line. The edging material is different too. These don't match the bra material, unlike originals.<br /><br />Perhaps other sellers could have originals. There were provided by Top Mall.<br /><br />I will say that the colors were extremely pretty and true to the photo. They were an electric blue, deep, bright pink and lavender. They would have been fun with summer clothes or for the gym. The fit was true. I am a 35-36B and ordered a medium. The fit was the same as originals. I didn't find these colors in the store and was hoping these would work out. Sadly, not. Would be nice if I could find them somewhere.
B00CG6MKYK|4|The Harley Davidson bucket hat was a very nice hat but I should have went one size smaller. Thank you
B00GFQXUE6|5|It's beautiful
B00UT9OAE4|2|The item was much too large and fit uncomfortably.
B00OZMLT6S|5|Fit well and the color was the same as shown.
B0087JAJVQ|3|The corset is a very thin fabric.It only comes with one small flower for the head and the flowers on the costume are small and cheap. I still like it, but it was expensive for what it is.
B008HHMCMM|5|I love these. They fit perfect and they're so soft and comfy. I haven't washed them yet so I don't know how well they'll hold up compared to comparable brands. But, so far, I'm very happy. And don't notice panty lines.
B00LGMQOLA|1|I purchased XXL (would normally be too big, but I had read the reviews saying they ran small, so I went extra big)- does not even fit over my arms. Disappointing.
B003YJBYPE|5|These are my socks!  They are really great and can work with a variety of different dress styles.  I have purchased multiple packs as sadly they just wear out after a few years of heavy use.  Will purchase again when needed as always Champion has a great level of quality and pricing when compared to some other higher end brands.  I cannot tell the difference really they are socks aren't they usually hidden by your shoes?
B00I8IZGKU|5|I love these!! They fit great and look great as well! Like the other comments the mesh pocket will sometimes hang out of the bottom of the shorts. Mine does that when I'm walking, must be because I got them thick ol' thighs!! KFC ain't got nothing on these thighs!!
B00LBOMVYW|5|Love my dress!!!!!! Got here on time!!! Will def. Order from Wow Clothing again!!
B0081SOD74|2|Son received this for Christmas and it ripped out at the bottom of the bag where the strings go in.
B0001YS1OW|5|This are the only jeans I ever buy as they hold up really well. These do run a little big so I may get regular fit next time.
B003FLEEGC|3|It's pretty hard to keep the edges down so I recommend buying a lot of latex. I used it on my neck and it was hard to keep down.
B004JU2BAY|3|This was a cute dress.  I bought it because I liked the red belt as the accessory that I assumed would come with it.  I never got it.  Liked the dress.  It fit well.
B008YPKQ5M|5|needed for a mexican theme party and everyone loved it, it did fit a little big just added belt and looked cute.
B00CODM5K4|5|This credit card holder is made of soft, very fine-grained black leather with an antiqued bronze snap.  I compared it to an older Coach checkbook cover and a very old Brooks Brothers passport case and although the leather is quite different on all three, the quality of construction is the same, with carefully folded, incised, glued, and stitched edges and corners.<br /><br />There are a total of twenty individual credit card pockets, one with a window for an identification card, plus two pockets the the size of the wallet, each lined with fabric and large enough for most currencies, a checkbook, receipts, etc.  It's not intended to hold a pen but there's room for one along the fold and it will stay in place.<br /><br />I should also mention that it has a faint and pleasant leather smell, not a foul or overpowering odor like some inexpensive leather goods have.<br /><br />Overall, this wallet is quite nice and is ideal for keeping all of those credit cards, membership cards, retail point and milage cards, etc. all in one place and readily available when needed.<br /><br />A sample was provided for unbiased review by NEWPORT BLVD.
B00CW4J7X8|3|Nice shirt but sizes run way too large I got a medium and it was huge
B00BINZ21A|5|Overall, good Pj Set.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Very comfortable<br />cute pattern on fabric<br />Great price<br /><br />Cons:<br />too large. I ordered my regular size: small, but it’s still looks baggy on me.
B000I2UUNC|5|The recipient of this gift loved it, but it took way too long to arrive. Shipping was supposed to be quicker.
B00K715M5A|3|Sadly I returned this. It fit nicely around my middle (true to size) except the sleeves. It was too tight around the arms.
B00NSS2Y9Q|4|Love theses. They are stylish and very comfortable!
B00OOCC7EM|1|I usually take a s/m knowing this was coming from China and the sizes are much different, I ordered an XL  it was still too small. Didn't bother to send it back, but unfortunately I can't where it.  I will donate this.
B0097642D4|5|They wash well and stay on well too. Perfect for hardwood and tile floors. Maybe they had more girl options but didnt see any on amazon. Or maybe I didn't look hard enough.
B0008EOUYA|4|Speaking for those of us with a 42\\" waist, it can be hard to find comfortable, good-fitting jeans... these work for me!
B00C9VN0XC|4|It fits very nicely on the head and it's soft.  The part that covers the mouth is very cozy and fits nice.  I did not rate it a five star  because, when you fold the mouth piece up on top of head, it remains somewhat bulgy.  It is still very though and I recommend it!
B00OCUUH2K|5|I bought this for my boyfriend and it looks great!
B00KFRB7QE|4|This skirt is a little small, not exactly what I would call flowy as described but is still cute and decently made. It did shrink ALOT in the dryer but I didn't read the label so maybe it said not to dry it.
B00TX2RTVY|5|I found this dress in my local exchange on our military base and my two younger girls (3 & 6) absolutely loved theres. My eldest (age 8) wanted one, too, but they didn't carry her size, so we ordered one for her from Amazon. Every time her sisters wear theirs she asks where hers is, since there's been a delay with delivery, but I'm sure she'll love hers as much as they do.<br /><br />This dress is just absolutely adorable! The fabric is both soft and durable, which is a must for a preschooler, and the two different patterns are both adorable. We even found an additional way to make this dress even more diverse by adding a little white cotton shrug to it. The shrug looks the best with the floral print. The length is perfect for both spring and summer, because it falls just below the knee. Because the fabric is double thick, it can be enjoyed on a chillier day with the shrug, but because of its flow-y design, it is also very wearable for warmer days.<br /><br />No matter how you chose to have your daughter wear this, this dress just can't be beat. Your little girl will be swaying and twirling all over the place.
B00N0CFG4K|1|shrunk so bad after first wash that I can't wear it anymore.Gets one star only becauseI can't give it a zeroooooooo
B00K54Y9S0|4|Great shirt
B00WAJT5QY|5|Papa loved it!
B00P1W202I|3|The thong came apart when washed- even in a lingerie bag. So it must be washed by hand... Not so convenient.
B00HWFCK2C|3|These are more like boxer shorts-very thin. Fit is OK and I will wear to workout at home or to sleep. For the price, I'm not too disappointed.
B00NL4CM12|5|Such darling tights, I love them! I always get compliments!
B00HLR6NZQ|5|I was nervous about this one.  It _looks_ adorable in the photo, but really, how often do things you order online fit exactly as they should?  This fits PERFECTLY.  It's lined, fuzzy and warm, without being bulky.  Lays beautifully- perfect amount of 'slouch', and is so cute!  I threw mine in the wash and then (accidentally) in the dryer.  Came out great- no shrinkage whatsoever.  (Dryer was on &#34;low/casual&#34; setting.)  I want another one.  :)
B00AIIH79Q|3|Doesn't fit like a true 36 C...a little snug.  Luv the material and design though which was nice so I don't know if I would purchase another one.
B00553XOR8|4|Love the concept! Very Comfortable but runs a little large.<br />Cons:<br />This bra runs a little large. I wear a 40 DD and fill, it so that is what I ordered. It ended up being a little too big in the cup of the bottom layer, so I exchanged it for a 40 D and still seems to be a little loose.<br />The under bra part is a really thin fabric and loose fitting. When I tighten the top section for more support the underneath fabric scrunches and folds in places. This is not uncomfortable but it does not look very good to me.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Very comfortable and is gives great support for bouncing around, even if you have a large chest. I love the adjust-ability of the straps and the second layer. It give you the ability to get the snugness you like for the activity you are doing.
B00LYTB4GU|5|People said to get one size bigger than the person normally wears, well i wear small and extra small, and it still fits
B008TNNLUG|1|The quality of the shirt was not very good..
B008YWF9QQ|3|this is a nice looking adult set of cotton pj's but after 3 washes it shrank by at least an inch in each direction.  as well, the collar and chest button-sides wrinkled and curled.  they are no longer the sharp, clean pj's you see in the pictures.  if i were to buy them again, i would order at least 1-2 sizes bigger to account for the laundry shrinkage.
B00I1PND4G|5|Really nice quality and so super cute!!<br />I get a lot of comments on it.
B00H7V2CVU|1|The smell on this sweater is horrible like very old oil and diesel and I washed about four times and the smell is still there!!! I will not recommend this product
B002CNZWDS|5|Very nice well fitting shirt
B000L6EZUE|5|The coat was better than I expected, works great at keeping me dry. I recommend it. Fit is good for me, 6'1&#34; & 250#
B008F4S866|5|the pants are tight looking ,but they are very comfortable it's like they adjust to your legs .. i definitely will be buying more
B00HANNDDQ|2|The inside is annoying. Hard to take it off.
B00WDI8EEG|5|Very pretty wouldn't fit anyone much larger than 1X as the yolk would bind. I love the light gauzy fabric
B006G7JZAM|5|These socks are soft, sturdy, and comfortable to use. Meet all my expectations.  I Would buy from this manufacturer again. Sizing is accurate
B001PUJCUI|5|Son wore it for military ball. Worked great and he has a very small neck
B00H8KIXTK|4|fits really good
B0009MZV12|5|I have size 13 feet and the X-large fits perfectly.  I needed some warmer socks and these did great with my sneakers even in the snow!
B00LJVBOGI|5|Adorable!
B00KHE224Q|5|Love! Super comfy and have worn well.
B00CC7FA0O|3|I ordered 0-3 to put my daughter in to bring her home from the hospital in.. the hat was big enough for my head and the gown seemed way too big as well...like 2 sizes too big
B00MCNB82C|5|excellent price
B00FBD2G0I|5|These were actually purchased for a household of active teen girls, multiple packs and a good value...and that also simplified laundry sorting! The socks were of satisfactory quality, definitely a synthetic blend 'feel' as opposed to some of the thicker, pricier all cotton types- those same types also wearing out and stretching loose and slack before these will, no doubt...for these were quite snug at the top band. Good enough for 'bulk wear', and at less than a dollar a pair, a deal.
B00BAM1G3M|5|I love it
B005IBKPMO|5|This is a great swim suit.  It has a liner, which I prefer.  The pockets have velcro, which is what I'm looking for.  What's really nice about it is that it's a very light and airy material, so it dries quickly.  It is super comfortable as well.  It is loose, but not baggy yet keeps everything in place.
B00BT8V5B0|4|These pants seem decent and nice enough to wear to work. I don't love, love, love the feel of the material, but it certainly doesn't bother me enough to return them. I haven't washed them yet, so there's a chance I'll be back to update.
B0064Y454I|5|These leggings are perfect for wear in the house and under my polartec pants for outside. I immediately ordered two more.
B00WS08ZES|1|Not even close in sizing.  WAY TOO SMALL.
B00113IAHA|5|It is said that review must contain at least 20 words, so i can print the word beautiful 20 times. :) I love this prayer shawl; it gorgeous, nice, pure white and gold, and very good quality. I've bought another one, white-blue-and-silver, I love them both; still can not decide which is better.... :)
B00M3Y3076|4|Jacket is nice and warm for fall but was a tad bit too large for a 7lb newborn
B001BXVSWE|4|We use this for w small skit we did on our office. Worked great. The guys wore sweats over this and looks good.
B001OI2YTM|5|I absolutely love these camis.  I am the type of person who likes a tank or camisole under my shirts to keep me covered.  I discovered this product during my first pregnancy and quickly bought several.  I wore them over my pants early on and then would tuck them in later in pregnancy.  I always felt I was covered through every stage of pregnancy growth.  I followed the sizing chart and have not had problems with slippage or the back riding up.<br /><br />After my baby was born I discovered that they are the perfect nursing undergarment!  I could wear a normal shirt over the top, pull that up and, since the cami material is so stretchy, could pull it down with my nursing bra.  Coverage on top and belly while still wearing great clothing!  And no need to buy those tanks that attach to a nursing bra and serve no purpose once you're done nursing.  I also loved that it held in my now giggly post-pregnancy tummy.<br /><br />So much so that even after I stopped nursing and lost the giggle, I kept using these camis.  The same ones too!  The length is so much better than anything I can usually find being long-waisted.  The stretch maintained throughout.  They wash up great.  Occasionally I replace a white one because it starts to look grungy or another because of wear but I definitely get my money's worth.  On my second pregnancy now and still loving them!
B00081FVW8|3|I ordered this product in black.  When I got it, I was disappointed.    The material on this item was not what I expected.  I was expecting a full-grain leather material, just like the one shown on the product image. It was also listed as one of the product features.    Instead, I received one that was constructed out of a duller, smoother leather.  It didn't have the same texture appearance as the one shown on the product image.  In fact, it had little or no texture at all.    I'm not sure if this only applies to the black version.  It's possible that the other colors might be okay.    I will, however, keep this item because it does feel sturdy.  That's why I gave it three stars.  It's still a decent quality passport cover.  Besides, I don't like going through the whole return process.    If you like the dull, texture-less feeling leather, then I would recommend this product.  Other than that, don't be fooled by the product photo like I was.
B00IIJFJII|4|So I was not expecting much from a $10 shirt, but I was sure hoping for more than what I got.  The material is a very weird type of \\"jersey\\" fabric that looks cheap and unprofessional.  The shirt fits too large to really look nice, yet the sleeves and neck are a bit short and tight.  Just a very odd shirt that is not worth the price at all.<br /><br />Updated 5/30/14 - After contacting the seller and telling them I did not like the fit of the shirt nor the material, they offered to refund 40% of my purchase since the shipping back to them would be so expensive.  I thought this was a decent compromise and even though the shirt itself is not that great, in my opinion, I think the company is fair for offering this.  I have changed my review from 1 star to 4 star to reflect the company's correspondence and my experience with them.  After everything is said and done, I am only out $6 and I plan on just donating the shirt to charity.
B00I8QA27E|5|Very snuggly, often complimented. A bit too tight around the wrists, but tolerable. Have had for a year and image remains pristine despite many washings.
B0041PAVO0|2|Hat runs a bit small but really cute set. The gloves run really big and scarf is just right. My son loves it.
B001GAIUUU|2|\\"Vegan's are better\\" is written on the front of this shirt.  I'm not entirely sure why an apostrophe is included. I wish I would've noticed this before washing the shirt!!  :(
B001PTGAMW|5|Nice product!
B00NLYJCQU|1|It's look different in the pictures but in real it's look too big
B00I64M0Z0|5|I love this top. It fits me perfect and I can wear it with so many outfits. :)
B001CVG8FC|3|Material was thin and see through but super cute and worked out great!
B002QDJDXY|3|Too small
B00422MCVW|1|This wallet is made in india. It is poor in design, material and making.<br />(1). It is too small to fit standard card size, such as credit card in America<br />(2). There are only six such small slots for cards<br />(3). the leather is very thin<br />(4). the sewing wire is loosing even the wallet in new.<br />The quality of the packing box of the wallet is much better than that of the wallet itself.
B00LK0JGFO|1|Pants were bad quality. The waist tore on all 3 pairs that I purchased. Bad sticking. This is not Dockers quality.
B00069ZCPS|5|I have been on my feet for 20 years.  These are the BEST shoes for the on the foot woman.  They are soooo comfortable and can make it through a grueling 12 hour shift on my feet with no slipping on wet or greasy floors.  They are a must have for hairdressers, bartenders and restaurant workers.  Absolutely the best!!!!   I even wear them on my days off.
B000NQKFZG|5|this is soooo sexy I love it my husband loves it to. this is a great piece to have and priced well
B003ZSHDHC|5|I loved how thick the lining was and how comfortable the coat fit.  Definitely the best coat I've owned.  Nothing but London Fog from here on out.
B00J39472G|5|These were my #1 favorite newborn item. If I had not had these I might have given up on breastfeeding. These kept him from clawing his face and from clawing me. He wore them almost constantly for the first few weeks. I came to love them so much that I put them in his baby scrapbook in lieu of baby booties! I had NO problem with them coming off and the Velcro held up well through many washes. These will be my &#34;go to&#34; baby gift for all of my friends.
B00OM0XRK4|5|She loves it and will grow into it.
B0038LIZTG|3|its good material and thick but shrunk after 1st wash going back to footlocker to pay more for shirts that are long enough
B00A4WK3UQ|1|I tried this on as soon as I got it today and when I opened it there were holes in it. I tried it on and no way in hell is this a plus sized. I'm trying to cosplay harley quinn and now I have to find yet another piece. Horrible, and my most regretful buy.
B00MPE6RKQ|3|Good have been better in terms of colour and is very large, so the child i bought it for has to wait till he is older to wear it
B00DEZS24E|4|Once you go metal you'll never go back to plastic.  Where have these been all my life?  I ordered the assorted pack 'cause I just wasn't sure which ones I truly needed.  To be honest, I don't see when I will EVER use the really short ones or the really long ones.  The weight on these is great.  They are straight as an arrow and the edges are nice and rounded, not sharp at all.  There was no residual grease at all on mine as other reviews have noted.  The only reason that I won't give these a five start at this point is because I have not tried to use them with magnets.  Due to their nice weight, though, I really don't see the need for the magnet pairing as they lay nice and flat as it is...
B00LLIVQM6|4|A little smaller than I expected. But still managed to squeeze in . Love it
B007UPZBCA|5|These hats are awesome, made from high quality materials and they look dope. I honestly didn't know what to expect considering the price I am not disappointed.
B00H6V4X5E|5|cool T
B003DPP090|4|Love this hat so far. It sits a little higher on my head than I expected but it still looks really good on. The hat isn't flexible like the last one I had like this, its pretty tough like paper machete almost which may be better because it wont bend out of shape.
B001C44II8|5|this shirt is so cool, and the neon inks look awesome in person.  its a fitted and sort of long fit which I LOVE.  I wear it all the time, and would definitely recommend
B00PAVP0Q8|5|Love the fit. Waist about at belly button which I really like.
B00CE2TFF8|5|Nice fit, offers a little extra support, especially if you suffer from planter fasciitis.
B00UOYI1YO|4|It just too some time to get from China
B009D8GMJS|1|Sent back..
B00JMHRYQU|5|Tks
B005ON32TO|4|good price but material feels a little thinner and not as heavy as the Levis I am use to and always purchase
B00CONNILE|1|I am in the process of figuring out how to return this product.  It was stated it ran small....try about 3 sizes too small!  Very disappointed!
B00G570Q38|5|Good fit, well sewn at a good price.  Comfortable.
B00BFIDNR8|5|excellent seller and product. bought multiple items and all were excellent
B008KK1L46|5|The red jacket with leopard trim is super cute and a nice way to dress up an otherwise plain outfit. I would definitely recommend it for any girl who likes cats or wants an outfit that is a little more special than the ordinary.
B008ZBPSRQ|2|Was looking for a nice looking leather slipper that looked like a classic casual loafer.  These are flimsy and the material looks like pleather.  They were inexpensive.  You get what you pay for.
B005COXXHG|5|good
B004Y1N21K|3|The fits a little small, and they're not as dark as the picture made them seem. But they still worked for my purposes.
B000OV99Z2|5|Very good pants
B008AAYRMO|3|Great material, but unfortunately it was very large. I had to return.
B009OZUEVC|4|I gave this product 4 out of 5 stars because in the picture the pillow version of this blanket looks really well put together, but it is almost impossible to fold the blanket up and make it look like that! There is this little pocket and it gives you a sheet with instructions on how to fold the blanket and tuck it into the pocket so it becomes a pillow, but after 6 or 7 tries I just gave up! It didn't even come shipped looking like a pillow, it was just a folded snuggie so I doubt the makers even know how to make it look like a pillow! The blanket itself is nice and comfy though, and the colors are great! Putting aside the fact that it says it can be folded into a pillow, I would recommend this blanket to any Chicago Bears fans out there!
B00Y8E2ADY|5|Cute!!!
B007UT4YVK|4|Nice design but not as tight like i expected. Should have ordered xs . My height is 5'3 and im around 110 pounds
B00BVX7SOQ|2|It is so small, it should be XSmall for kids. Too bad. It looked cute. The color is great, the fabric the same.
B00LBXXV8I|5|So happy to have purchased this . Can't wait to wear it to the beach
B004OVELOC|5|GREAT FIT AND DEAL
B004PVUCAS|4|Very pleased with this bra. Nice lift for the fuller figure without any telltale tee shirt lines. If the straps were thicker I'd give it 5 stars.
B00HWRPDGK|5|I love it! It arrived within two weeks and I wasn't expecting it. I also wasn't expecting the string in the back but I like it I'm thinking of ordering another one in a different color. It's inexpensive and worth the money!
B0091CVZ5M|4|the dimension is greater than expected.<br />its much bigger than what I wanted, however still works great.<br />not sure if I like how the card slits all face the same direction, this - I just need to get used to.
B00PDM4LPK|5|My grandson loved this hoodie.  He normally takes a men's size Small, but this Medium was loose enough for comfort.  The colors are as bright as shown online.
B00NIN59WA|5|I bought this for my Step Dad to wear at Xmas time. He loves it and gets many complements on it!
B00GUAVD28|4|I like it
B004UULGU4|5|I wore this to Oktoberfest last weekend and people loved it! Everyone wanted to take a picture with me and keep saying how cute I looked. I ordered an L and XL due to the reviews that the costume ran small. I was to suppose to wear a L according to the size chart and the L fit perfectly. I am 5'1&#34; and have a big bust (38DD) so I had a bit of cleavage being that the white part to cover yours boobs is flimsy but I was drinking and having fun so I didn't care. Wore it with a strapless bra. Loved it!!
B005D6OSJA|5|I've gone through a lot of t-shirt brands and these appear to be the best yet. Highly recommended. Great fit and durability.
B00EUZ3ZXK|5|Excellent fit,great color would definitely recommend,wear with dark denim jeans or light color khakis with penny loafers to give a different kind of look.
B00KPL8CG8|5|Great product for the price. Received lots of compliments.
B007SZV6YO|5|Nice hat
B008LINKZA|5|Already reviewed this item last week.
B00BSXC2W2|5|Great shirt
B002AU1Y94|4|great but a bit baggy. If you like the extra comfy cloths this is suitable for you.
B00CPM886Y|2|I love the look and feel of these shorts.......The tag states my size, but they are too large...Trying to decide if I should have them altered to fit or send them back......Disappointed........
B008PDG2WE|4|These are very nice tights! They look like they will wear well but time will tell. The color is true to description.
B00F5Q5UGI|5|Theses are my favorite shorts now. I bought the denim and they fit true to there size. I wanted the brown but they didn't have them in 12? Please get more size 12s and ill buy more :)
B005C9GD6Y|5|I liked it so much I bought a second pack. It fits well, a bit longer than usual so that you don't lose the tuck. And no pesky neck tag!
B000GK620Q|4|Ever have a horrifically ugly blind date show up? If so, the Pig Face is for you. Once you slip this regal piece of medieval armor over their ugly mug, you won't be able to see so much as a hairy mole poking out through the air vents and slits. The only thing that keeps this from being 5 stars is that the eye slits make it hard for your ugly dates to see movies.
B00LEWXHWG|4|More narrow then I thought it should be for that size.
B00076ZRAU|1|Usually my size is large, but i selected medium size T-shirt, but medium size also looks like EXTRA LARGE
B00IXNZYTI|3|I ordered large so I could be sure it wrapped around, and it does. It is a little bit heavy, but will do the job
B00O41DEYK|5|As always Amazon delivers ..... The shorts fit as expected.
B0089NM9RC|5|As someone who has worn tube socks his whole life, I can honestly say these are the best I've ever worn.  I've been using the usual Hanes, Fruit-of-the-Loom, and standard socks that are sold in WalMart, KMart, and such for so long I thought that socks that lose their elasticity after a couple months and get thin quickly were normal.  After looking for socks locally and having a hard time finding any in a brick & mortar store I went to Amazon and found the Wigwam socks because of the high ratings.  I saw they cost a little more, but they are totally worth it.  They are incredibly comfortable, they actually stay UP on the calves all day, and I can't imagine going back to the cheap-os ever again.  Again, they may cost a little more, but you get what you pay for.
B001IV3VYW|5|Perfect fit! Well made and no shrinkage after washing and drying. I am very happy with this produc!!!
B004A7YLOA|5|I bought it as a gift for my brother. He simply loved it!
B006JXLO8O|5|the outfit is as described. shipping was quick. my child hadn't worn this yet but we did do an initial wash and it still came out nicely.
B00IL5VP14|5|Great dress! Great, but snug fit.  Will look lovely with a gardenia in my hair. Can't wait for the right occasion!
B00APKX5Q6|5|Got a great deal. Love the shirt
B00JQRP3SC|4|really nice
B00A6G46BW|5|I am a size 34 and the large fits just fine...my first crootas & very comfortable so time will tell as to durability....
B003HKDPJI|3|I ordered a youth size 5/S - it was HUGE and would almost fit my teenage daughter!  I had to take it to get altered to fit my 5 year old son for his birthday.  I buy youth 5 items for him in stores and they fit fine however their sizing might be off.  That said it was AWESOME!  Great quality!
B0085K38I8|5|Nice bra and as comfortable as a bra can be.
B00GN7Y0JG|5|verrry comfy!
B004QLX9X4|5|I bought this case for only 7 bucks, great deal! This case is sleek with a professional look. The only thing I can see wrong with it is that the back has no grip so it will easily slide off a counter or something.
B00NDAEGFE|3|Sleves are tight and its very very hot.
B00CQPC9RY|4|The wallet is well made and very, very colorful.  It includes a place to put your checks which was a bonus.  There are plenty of credit card holders and places to put money.  I would have given it 5 stars, but for me personally the colors are too bright. I think it is a great wallet in terms of functionality.
B00IRKVOBE|5|These are great belts for under tops, smoooth with no belt buckle bulge. The buckle takes a bit of getting used to, but once you master it you'll probably wear one everyday.
B007UXNKIY|4|Lovely fabric
B00CF3CSK0|4|Ended up seeming a little big in the neck area....but kept it anyway :)
B00SRZVXG0|5|love it snap back so one size fits all. runs a lil big but not much that itll effect u
B00960XR4Q|5|My girl love the dress.
B00XYZCEZW|4|good quality. but less than the pants jacket. Size 3T at the boy see a small increase in 94
B003E214CO|5|good
B00LTYNY0E|4|My hips are 34 in<br />I bought the small and the fit fine
B00JE9BIAY|5|great fit !!
B000VDTDKO|5|Not all cowhide! But as a whole has a type
B00L490TQG|5|Excelente
B005EK53G2|5|What else can I say but super cute.Looks way better in person,fits perfect.Nothing falling off wish I had bought every color
B00VZMYZ6C|4|Looks good now lets see how it will last. I think letters will be washed off soon
B00J8OOKCI|3|ok item
B00DGMKF8Q|3|The gown is soft, but riddled with static electricity and I don't know how to get rid of that. Feels like it's somewhere between a large and an extra large.
B000V2277Q|5|The corset isn't what I expected; a little cheaper than I thought it would be, plastic wrapped over sponge, so after I wore it and put it in storage, the shape went out of it so I haven't been able to wear it since, but for a one time product? Brilliant.<br />I wouldn't suggest it for a fancy dress party during the summer, because the dress is very heavy, but I wore it for Halloween and it was cold enough outside that I stayed a comfortable temperature. It fit great and looked great and the mask didn't hurt my eyes or nose like some masks do. So, 5/5.
B00GFYLIWE|5|Husband loved the shirt.  Lots of compliments.  Perfect fit. Great product for the money  will buy more in the future
B00LORONZQ|5|This jacket is awesome - the fit is perfect and it is a wonderful color.
B003XU5UTK|5|love these pants - these are the second ones I have bought exactly the same  comfortable, nice fit and good material...well recommended
B00G56NSLQ|5|They fit my son perfectly!  He is really skinny so I just knew they would be to big for him but nope they were perfect!  Love them and would recommend them to anyone.
B00EPG935I|5|Good5/5
B00AKFPOZQ|5|My daughter loved it!
B00DR81GUA|5|I didn't know IZOD made baby clothing so when I found this I didn't know what to expect but it is so cute! Feels very soft and has quickly become a go-to when it comes to comfortable clothing for my son.
B0075M1J0Q|5|Love this tie!  I bought it for my husband for an upcoming wedding with a grey suit.  They fabric is lovely, the design is understated and the sheen is just enough.  You won't be disappointed in this item!  Very classy!
B00DRCGC5A|5|Great piece!  The G-string are a bit flimsy and I actually purchased the crotchless lave thong w/bows to match instead.  Looks great together and is very sexy.  And this is coming from a middle aged, 5'3&#34; 140something lb woman.  Great coverage to help camouflage the flaws of time.  The quality is better than expected for a &#60;15.00 item.  I am really impressed with the Rene Rofe items I've found here on Amazon....
B00IIIL7YO|5|I truly love this dress . It is so easy to care for . Washes and dryers great . Verry flattering fit .
B0002FHG8C|4|Very nicely made garment. Great wind repellent characteristics.  I'll be ordering two more but I do have one caution. <br /> <br />The sizes seem to run large.  I ordered extra large and the item seems closer to an  \\"XX\\"  size. <br />I'll be ordering only \\"large\\" next time around.  I would  far prefer this anomaly, though, over having them be on the small side.
B00KDXKV7Q|5|Fit perfectly and comfortably, though so far I've had to put the bra on over my head as the back straps do not come apart. Other then that, this bra has definitely become one of my favorites!
B001A42GCK|5|I am not sure how many people read sock reviews. However, if you have large and wide feet, then you know that finding comfortable socks that fit can be a challenge. We all know that \\"one size does not fit all.\\" Several months ago I found Wigwam socks, and they offered my size. I purchased some fuzzy acrylic Everyday Work Socks. They fit well and were very comfortable. However, the socks produced lint and loose fuzz all over the house. I called Wigwam and was told that their socks are guaranteed for 12 months from purchase. Wow! Before I sent the socks back, I looked for replacements and found the Everyday Fusion socks. I returned the fuzzy socks, and Wigwam replaced the eight pairs of fuzzy socks with the Fusions. I did not expect such generosity.<br /><br />The lint/fuzz problems are history. These are the best socks that I have found in years. Yes, they are expensive, but over the last two months they have shown very few signs of wear and shrinkage. While writing about socks seems unusual to me, I believe that one should praise quality products and outstanding performance. Wigwam deserves praise for its innovative products and outstanding service. Yes, they do have sox appeal. The keys to keeping these socks in the best shape is washing them in COLD water and then drying them at low temperatures. A good detergent to use with these socks is Tide's new pods. I definately will buy these again.
B0029UJS9S|5|My husband is a big dork and loves things like this. We put bubble liquid and it works just like he hoped it would.
B00GD6CR06|5|Perfect! Just as described!
B000NVUXOO|4|GOOD QUALITY HUSBAND LOVES, RUNS RATHER LARGE IMO.  I GOT LARGE FOR HIM BUT HE NEEDS A MEDIUM, WHERE MOST OTHER SWEATSHIRTS WOULD HAVE FIT IN A LARGE.
B00CZBGHRC|4|Nice pants
B00DM3YL5C|4|Perfect
B004L6LB2K|5|True to size and so cute on!
B0065L8OVK|5|Crow flies straight
B001DSND8E|5|These are made nice. Very true to size. Thicker cotton nicer feel than Others brands ive purchased. Would buy over the Gerber brand.
B005ODTA5E|5|great mask , if you use spirit gum , stick it to your face , and then it moves with you, great product, low price , and very life like for a dead zombie !!!
B00COD186Q|5|VERY NICE SHIRT AND WASHES VERY WELL
B00S5BQP82|5|Wilm buy again
B000HAML7S|5|Perfect!
B00K84F01M|5|This cardigan brings out any outfit and is very comfortable.  Great for a date to a movies or dinner.
B004SKAY18|5|I bought this for a trip to Morocco to keep the sun off of my neck, and to my surprise, I found myself wearing it in the US. It's good for both warm and cold days, and I found myself getting a few compliments from it. Material is light and feels good - not too scratchy, not too gauzy. Not bad for something that was just meant as a functional piece!
B007C2ISS0|5|I read several reviews and decided to try these. They are great for my daughter to sleep in. They are perfect because it is easy to change her diaper at night and they are really soft. I have bought several more, they are my go to for night time.
B00GJ9AORA|5|I like that you can't tell even if they are a little dirty on the bottom. ;)
B009PIJJP0|4|I got this in blue, black, and white. Sadly, the fabric is too thin for the white shirt to be acceptable as anything but an undershirt, but these are cut nice and long in the body so it works well for that. I can't think of a use for the tiny curved collar pocket, but I doubt it was meant to be used. Still, they're attractive shirts and well worth it if you can get them for under $10.
B007UPM94S|4|They snap in and hold well.  They are noticeably thinner than Oakley lenses.
B008HS00RK|5|Very comfy and well made. It does NOT roll up in any places!!! Miracle!
B009CSBXH0|3|the seller is from ShenZhen, so you understand what i mean. if you from China, there is no need to buy made. when i saw the chinese label and receipt, i m so confused.<br /><br />the cape is so thick, i expected it be worn in spring/autumn, but obviously too thick.
B007WESNUQ|3|I was looking for a cute headband that would keep my ears warm, but it is too narrow to really cover my ears. It is cute though.
B00CS9FWQS|4|it fit we forgot we thought the pants came with it and order the pants  days ago, hope it reach by 20th Aug 2014
B00847BWJY|1|The size isn't true to its description I am highly dissapointed! I would not recommend to anyone! Pass on it
B0020ML3F2|3|Thes socks work well for me. I am gld I bought the socks. I think everyone should get socks like these.
B005949Q34|1|I absolutely loved these jeans. Great fit and extremely comfortable. However, they barely lasted six months before a hole wore through the inner thigh area. Very disappointing.
B00422M6FE|5|Nice
B00R7PY6ZG|5|The most comfortable socks I have ever owned!
B000NH3YK8|5|Underwear that does not ride up, roll down, or sneak up in cracks. The look very attractive on and they are very comfortable. They are my favorite in my undie drawer.
B00UXEHYMA|5|Nicely fitted dress...very stretchy. Thin material but its for summer so the material is just right! Shipped very quickly from seller and received 10 ays before expected. Will buy this dress in different styles as the material is wonderful!
B00DJRMS5Q|4|nice and warmvery warm ,Fit as expected,But the zipper is a little small problems,Not to draw ,Other aspects or great
B001D1H6UW|4|This wig was a great find - it looked very good and stayed on without extra clips or bobby pins.  The cap was a little large, but it did not slip down.  You cannot beat the price for a wig of this quality.
B005CSOMHW|5|The best crossover shorts out there! Fit is great, quality made, and very cool colors. I bought two  more pair, one of which I use for summer PJs.
B00K2QM104|5|Loved it. Definitely buy another one.
B009RE0H30|4|They are not leggings. However, they are a little thicker than footless tights. I love them. They are comfortable and have a light compression so that the bit of pain I was having has gone away. I will order more.
B00SRZ0XPW|3|returned
B0051T9K9M|4|Back style pockets in front and back are much cuter on the person than on the hanger. Jeans are soft and feel good to wear. They have a medium rise with a flattering fit. Current price is quite the value for these jeans!
B000P55S98|3|I bought these instead of my 'normal' shorts, to see if they were as good.  The answer is a conditional yes.  They are comfortable for the most part, fit well, and are true to size.  The issue is with the waistband.  It is to narrow, and rolls up like a rubber band, which is not very comfortable around your middle.  Now, I admit that I am no longer a hard body, but these should have a waistband at least a half inch wider than they do.  If they fixed the waistband roll, these would be perfect.  They fit well, hold things in place better than typical boxer briefs, and are comfortable except for the waistband....but that is a big except for me. My 'regular' brand does not have this issue, and fit almost as well, albeit at a slightly higher price.<br /><br />Best Regards,
B00JPWKU5E|4|I'm only 5'6&#34; and it doesn't look that big or long on me, but I would say it is a bit longer than a regular T-shirt.  The material is very thin and would be somewhat see-thru except the pattern mitigates that.  I like it and it seems to hold up to normal washing and drying.
B00FGFQPRQ|5|Bought as a birthday gift for my husband, & he loves it!
B00LS79LTU|5|Seriously
B002PUA00S|5|I will be honest... this is the first time that i buy cloth by the internet.. i think there is no better way that try the cloth by myself... But this sweter is really good and the size was perfect for me (the medium size).  In my country (Costa Rica) the temperature is never below 15C° and the sweter is perfect for the night and the \\"cold\\" days.  Great choice!!
B00LTG4UFA|3|Loved the shirt, but it came with a huge hole in the back, which I didn't notice until the person it was intended for opened the gift :( it looked like it had been cut with scissors... (No I didn't cut it myself) but the return was easy and I've just ordered a replacement so here's hoping..
B0043M5MGS|3|I read the previous review and ordered a medium thinking it would be fine.  Sadly, the jacket was way too small. I also wear a size 12, but I could not get the jacket to zip up over a sweater.  The purple is very dark in case you are wondering.  I returned the jacket and will buy the large.
B002DNYO7W|5|Came out of hand wash/ hang dry a bit wrinkly but ironed up okay.
B00I0ZB0BU|5|I just got my scarf in the mail and I just love it! The quality is like something you'd buy at Bloomingdales yet for a fraction of the cost. I'll definitely be ordering more products from this store. Love their stuff!
B000FLDNEY|5|I do not know what the two guys that ordered this shirt and were not happy with it wanted. This is EXACTLY like the one in the film Superman Returns. The colors are different than the typical Superman colors because this is a NEW take on the costume. It looks like it is 3-D and it is in fact an almost flat print. WELL WORTH the price.
B00JUC50CW|5|Excelente producto, recomendado100 %
B0002TW1V0|5|My husband wears a size 13 shoe and it has been virtually impossible to find a sock that fits. These are a great fit, as well, excellent quality.
B00C7YTYFE|3|100 percent cotton, good for trying to eliminate fungi nail, top of socks have no elastic so they will fall down to ankles.
B00AYUR65I|5|My boyfriend love this shirt it was a Christmas present got here on time had no issues with the shirt
B00JE49DEC|5|like it very much.
B00JOSPRA2|4|Love them, very smooth and comfortable, stretches to fit just right and not too small. Ordered two more pairs in different colors
B001K8P5XS|2|I thought this would have been different from the normal boring underwear. Trust me, it does not worth a trial.
B000KE0M18|5|Amazing tank!!!
B00JELG2XK|5|Great quality and totally fun t-shirt.  Runs only a little large.
B008FXOMNU|4|So comfortable and chic. I wear a body shaper under it when I go out because it does show off your figure, but if all my clothes were this beautiful and this comfortable, I'd be thrilled.
B00JX37VJI|4|Nice fitting. More sheer than expected but great with a cami. I will order a few more colors.
B000SKLTI4|5|exactly what I needed to wear with snake boots and fold over the top for comfort and the socks would not sag into the boot when walking
B00SI0BFIA|3|They shrink a lot when you wash them... I got a medium...I would suggest going a size up.
B000NDCHS2|4|This product is great. My wife bought it and she says it's comfortable and holds her pants up very well from 6month and onward
B00HIKOIKS|5|I love the shirt fits great
B0062EE8Q0|5|The fabric and colours are fantastic, I've had so many compliments on both. I have purchased a few items from C&C California and it is fast becoming my favourite. I would highly recommend this dress.  I'm 5ft 4in and I have had to have it taken up slightly but otherwise its a perfect fit, very true to size.
B000N3RTKI|5|My husband LOVES these pants!  He is an engineer and wears them every day of the week.  Looks great and fits great.
B00HA4BQ2K|5|Love the ruched sides! Very comfy and stylish.
B00JE0LLJ6|4|Kept me warm all winter
B005K05ZCI|5|Love these stockings. Feel great and they just look great.
B000N5BK88|5|love it!!!!!!!!
B00JBVUTHI|1|The quality, fit and fabric is poor. The black is not vibrant, but dulled and to some extent registers as pajama fabric. This is a purchase I would not make again, given the chance.
B008VVA9ZQ|4|Now I have a Blazer that looks expensive.
B00CE8QY3I|5|Holds up to daily use and my bf loves it. 5 stars for sure. It looks kind of cheap but again, it holds up very well. It's been over two months that he's been using it 5x a week +
B007IEGRBW|4|The costume was as described. The shirt material isn't very sturdy (feels like felt) but the overall effect is right on.  The wig took some work because the part in the middle isn't pronounced enough. Delivery was very fast!
B00HR0LNM0|4|Looks great, great quality product
B00DSHPKZ2|4|Very cute and good fit. I didn't notice the bunching on the sides, which makes me look wider (something I don't really need help with), so I probably wouldn't have purchased with that in mind, but I still occasionally wear it.
B000OD0JYK|5|I love these hats, they are well built , very durable usually buy 4 at the time white  for the summer,follow by stone or light beige for either fall or spring and last navy blue and black for winter I've never seen these hats locally here in El Paso, Tx.
B00U1H5H5A|5|My daughter got this for her nephew he loves it,he wears it alot.he loves trailer park boys its his fave show.this was just perfect for him.
B00B7B09QG|2|It was a tiny bit smaller than expected and the material is not the best, had some problems with lose strings at the seams the first time I wore it. But its for around the house so Im not too disappointed.
B009ESBAKS|5|Love it. Just as pictured. Fit perfect.
B00AMAB4YE|5|This is an anti-lose your keys, keychain. Just don't go throwing it on friends glass tables when you visit their peaceful homes.
B008G7J04Q|3|It's a nice looking coat, but fits a little snug for me, I would say, it's a great coat . But get the next size up.
B000GIQVN6|5|I'm wearing them now, a little tight, but I can wear them. Sent other pair back Friday 7\17\2015. I would wear a X-Queen. Thank you.
B000LNL2Z8|2|The item was bigger than anticipated, the packaging was insufficient and ending up with damage to the paint on the tomahawk blade due to lack of packaging. I'm surprised they were able to ship it. There is a tuff of fur attached to the bottom but no feathers. So don't believe the photo.
B0031U0PO2|4|There are lots of brand name belts out there that are made of bonded (glued) leather).   This one is cut from a solid piece of leather with a good buckle.  A good work and play belt.  Size is true. Not a dress belt nor does it claim to be.  Holds up to rough use such as a wearing a holster.   I ended up buying a black and brown one.
B00AYWVM1K|5|This bra is comfortable and has a smooth look under blouses and shirts.  The racerback is perfect for sleeveless outfits.
B003XCGZVU|5|Love the look and feel of this dress.  Was exactly as I expected and I actually bought two of them.  Will buy from this company again.
B00DYSNFG6|4|FITS GOOD
B000N8Q0FI|4|Worked for exactly what I needed it for and honesty, is a very good quality shirt and could get more use out of - other than just a costume.
B00JRUOL9U|5|FINALLY something that holds the girls in place so when I'm cross-training I don't get sore. I have tried numerous &#34;active sports bras&#34; and this is the FIRST to hole me where I need to be. It's also quite comfortable for the level of support it offers. I will buy again in more colors. I am not sure if it's too large b/c it just runs large, or if I've gotten smaller since my last fitting. I am 125 lbs and a 34DDD, and this fit very well, just a little large on one side.
B00GGMCUW2|5|Rosme lingerie is still little known in this country.  We're lucky to find them on Amazon.  Amazon UK has been carrying them for some time.  Items for sale through Amazon are from collections from the last couple of years.  Take a look at their present collection here:  http://www.rosme.lv/en/  to see what may be available for us to buy later this year or next.  They have a slick website.  If you're lucky you can find a matching pantie for a bra you like, get them both, as it might not be available later.  Rosme pantie sizes run small.  My wife bought size 6 (which should be comparable to US small.  She says they fit like our extra small, so Rosme size 8 should be closer to US small.  My wife has several Rosme bras with matching pantie, including the Lynette, and loves them all for fit, colors and materials.  Rosme is quick to ship orders but has no control over US customs letting packages sit for days or weeks.
B0027RCLCO|5|Nice tie!
B0041O1YRY|5|I ordered these jeans before the price went up and when I received them I was truly impressed with their quality and fit. Very sexy and true to size.
B008GOBNT4|4|i bought this tank for 2 reasons: it's purple & has buddha on it. & i love it. it does run a lil tight in the chest area, i have to wear a tank underneath. i am a 36c so if your any bigger than that, you will probably have problems in that area. other than that, it's adorable and a good lazy addition to the wardrobe.
B00DUYW1ZU|5|I LOVE Allegra K products.  Without fail they have been comfortable, flattering and hold up well to washing.  I am 5'7&#34;, 175 lbs, ordered the XL and this shirt fit exactly as pictured.  If I were younger (I am 53), I would wear it with black leggings and little black uggs (what the hey, I might go ahead and do that despite my age!)  I wore it with a tan knit maxi skirt and long tan knit belted cardigan to work the other day and received several compliments.  For the price, this shirt (as well as other similar AllegraK products) cannot be beat!
B005SW8GDI|2|not my favorite!
B00KJ0XBDE|5|I attended a masquerade party and got so many compliments for this mask. Perfect choice, great price, well made.
B000VVVO62|4|AM I THE ONLY ONE TO NOTICE THE HILARIOUS MISPLACED TREE ON THE CAMO ONE'S? I ALMOST FELL OVER LAUGHING.  ANYWAY........GOOD PANTS. THEY DO KEEP YOU WARM WITHOUT MAKING YOU SWEAT.
B00JR2GGXW|1|Way to large for size and fabric is horrible, the fabric is like paper, it ripped when I put it on
B00B1WAQ7I|4|I had to buy up 1 size. other than that they fit and look great. don't stretch out.
B004T8CTUS|5|I got this in mint, which is slightly brighter than the color in the photo here.  Really great shirt, good quality material, breathes and feels good on.  Runs slightly small (as expected, since it's slim fit, I guess).  And as a female who wears a lot of guys' clothes, the sleeves were way too long for me, so I got them tailored and now it is perfect.
B005H26QHC|1|Terrible fabric, poor quality comes out extremely wrinked from the washing machine due to the poor quality of the fabric.
B00F27WSOW|5|gracia  por el paquete me llego a tienpo  para una fiesta
B00MY9PUIC|5|I Love to wear scarves & Love my new Humble Chic Women's Chunky Knit Cold Weather Infinity - Cable Knit Circle Scarf! This Loops up twice like any traditional infinity scarf & is very comfortable. I'm glad I got to try this out for my honest unbiased opinion. It's a nice Creame/off white color so matches with almost everything. And the Cable knit style is very classic so again this one will go a long way. It's a Very Nice soft Chunky Woolen scarf. Material is gentle to the touch & doesn't irritate my skin. Arrived well packaged & in a timely manner. Will Definitely Recommend this!
B000YKFNJ4|4|It's your standard quality Halloween costume, I bought it because it was very cheap compared to similar costumes at the mall and Party City. even tho it's 'adult costume' t will fit an older child (I got it for a 5'2&#34; tween) but not a grown man 5'10&#34; or more.
B0020HRYZA|3|ok
B005J697YA|5|Just as pictured, big design, slightly muted colors, nice quality graphics and shirt. Recommended.
B00JRW3F1I|1|This dress was so far off in sizing, but when i found out the cost of returning it (more than 4 times the cost of the dress) I decided t0 keep it and give it away
B009SP3JNS|1|This is not the size I order, why you send a XLarge when I order a Large, the worse thing is this box travel to Central America and when I open here the package, my surprise it is the wrong size and this was a gift to my husband, a big mistake you make with a simple &iacute;tem,<br />I dont recommend this saller.
B00JMICRAC|5|Nice cap. Looks good.
B00CY06VIO|3|Loved the accessory - but it broke immediately upon wearing.  :(
B0013FHN3S|5|This is a Good quality cover for the price. It will fit most any bible. It's got a few pockets and a place to keep a pen but it's not too bulky.
B00541T7L8|5|This cover is beautiful.  It is large enough for my checkbook, register, and a few credit cards.  I love it.
B00JF0KI8K|5|Excellent
B00TRVYT3C|5|I followed the sizing chart and this shirt fits as expected if a little loose on top (after wearing for a little while) because I am a B cup. It is comfortable and a very feminine pink. The back is a bit thin and I find that bulges created by bras are visible. For the color I bought, baby pink, it is better to wear a nude color bra. I am happy to report that this shirt skims the body while hiding the bulges it is meant to conceal (in the front) as the picture shows. I would buy another color if prime shipping had another option without animal prints. I like this particular color because while it features different hues of pink, it is still one color which helps make me look longer (I am not tall). It is very flattering. In winter or chilly evenings this looks great with a cardigan.
B00CORIR0M|4|Comfortable to wear
B00GYV70W0|4|A  bit large
B00847BXMK|4|I really like this skirt, it fits me so well.. Very tight and sexy. This is nice for a night out.
B0076RNFZ2|5|Fit well. Nice quality.  I wear it for work and its a comfortable fit without being baggy.  I prefer these to my Nike, or other brand named similar shirts.
B00KT93PNQ|5|Everything I expected
B00A77VHAS|5|always wear thorlos
B008SOBF5E|5|Good product.  Keeps its colours well in the wash.
B00I5CUABY|3|The dress is quite long and I was disappointed about the synthetic fabric which is not ideal for a summer dress.
B006ZVYYFK|4|I love the thigh highs, and the one with the stripes doesn't roll at the top, but the Harlequin ones do. I'm gonna have to get some double sided tape, but I wore them out in public, tops were under my shorts.  (I'm short so i will have to sew them.) And received lots of compliments.
B00S89JW6S|5|Love these! Super easy to put on and cute, too.
B0055BBI46|3|This nighty is a very pretty color - a bright royal blue, not really \\"Navy\\" - and a pretty style. However, the manufacturing is very shoddy. The lace extends beyond the ribbon trim in several areas,especially at the hem line,  and the seams are uneven. I trimmed off the excess lace and decided not to spend the time & energy to return this item - but I would not order it again.
B000UZBV30|1|Just got the wallet and attempted to place my ID and assorted cards in the wallet. Found that the wallet's slots for cards are too small!!  They apparently are not cut for US cards.
B004LWZ2VA|5|Good
B00MQKV0U6|5|I will give five stars for this oh I love the dress fit so well and arrived before the date that I'm going to the party ☺️☺️☺️thanks
B00QNK0GIC|5|Great quality, fit a 10 year old boy perfectly, got him the 14/16 because kids like things big these days.
B002LVUY1G|5|Very happy. Authentic and just as described. I'm the envy of all my friends when I wear this vest to the bonfire or the mall.
B00WAJT384|5|Just what we wanted!
B011QIA3D8|2|You get what you pay for, cheap material, poor fit.
B0085TIAOG|5|I am an electrical foreman. These are great pants, soft, durable and the side pocket is great for my phone.
B00C3K4VO6|5|These shorts are good! Im here in kuwait right now, im using the shorts for the gym and for casual use. reminds me of home back in hawaii cause i always use surf shorts.
B00JZBX2IC|5|Excellent suspenders, well made and if you buy a Tall size they are perfect.  The clipping method is awesome. Strongly recommend.
B00R4LRFU6|5|Per-fit For me ,  not to light or heavy
B00IGVB0S6|1|way to much to work with  to get in and out of not good
B00ACIG1C6|5|Great fit
B009DNWG5C|4|Daughter loves them for wearing with school uniform.  She is required to wear black &#34;tights&#34; with her Catholic uniform but prefers leggings since she complains of being cold in school. She reports these are very warm. They are as thick as leggings but very fitted, like tights. You cannot really wear them alone as the seams at the crotch are very noticeable and what you would find on tights (V shaped seams in front and back). The inside is super soft and described as &#34;fur lined&#34; on the packaging.  Laundering instructions say to hang dry, hopefully the softness won't be effected by washing them.
B00FRCOXYU|5|Just what I needed for a wedding.
B000KD64ZM|5|My son love  the train T- shirt, thank you very much.
B004EBUCEU|5|💦💦
B003UPAZA2|2|Kind of cheap looking. Was not smooth in the back.
B00DBWYM0I|5|Excellent swim trunk. If you are NOT slender go a size up. European sizes are smaller than American sizes. Love Scotch & Soda.
B00BID6KYS|5|love them
B00L8WBEMW|3|Loved it but it's bigger then I anticipated and I had to sew some stitches becaus I thought it was a tad revealing
B003DA5YSM|5|these socks are great and stay on my daughters feet.  They are a little thick so they don't fit well with tight shoes - but they are so much cheaper than in the stores that it is worth every penny.
B00G365ZM8|5|Great fit! Nice quality and has held up well. Great one to have in multiple colors.
B004N3D0T8|5|This dress is absolutely more beautiful in person than it is online. The dress was exactly as advertised and it fit exactly as it said it would. I actually bought it the next size up, so my child will fit into it longer and I'm glad I did. She'll get a lot of use out of this dress. It's not too long, but it's not short. The fabric is comfortable to the touch!!!
B004RWTWSI|5|I've been in love with the Black Veil Brides since their first album and had to have this shirt. I ordered a medium just in case the small would be too small. It fits great and looks great and just like the picture. I love it and recommend this to anyone who loves BVB!
B00OANOLIA|5|Love me some meatballs!! Shirt is perfect!
B00LTVI6NW|1|Very cute suit BUT sizing is waaaay off.
B00UKRU22E|2|Dress size is stated to already be adjusted for American sizes but apparently that wasn't the case. I am a size small so I ordered a small and its huge. More like a size large. Be sure to order proper size! Thin material and see through. You get what you pay for!
B003CY210S|3|I'll keep it but it's hard to imagine how it will stay on with even the smallest puff of wind.  I don't believe there is any way from the website to get a sense of sizing.  It would be helpful.  The issue of me is the depth from top of hat to brim not brim size.<br /><br />We'll see.
B000GUAVH6|5|I have been a faithful Sorel and North Face customer for years and have loved wearing their boots.  I was in a pinch and needed new boots mid-season and found Irish Setter Snow Tracker Pac boots.  I love them.  I have worn them to two outdoor football games in single digit temps.  My feet were actually hot.  My toes never got cold. I have also had them out ice fishing and doing outdoor chores in the snow.  They are the warmest boots i have ever owned. These boots have a lot more insulation in the tow and on top of my foot.  They are cushy.  Very comfortable to walk in as well.  The height of the boots gives a little more support in the ankle that I need.  They almost feel like snow boarding boots in that regard.  I love them so far.
B007ZOA0OU|5|This tie has been the envy in my office. I was told it shows my feminine side... and made new friends. Not bad for $10, thanks Mr Trump, if I only can match your hairdo.
B00LIL9G5U|3|Beautiful, but a bit big.
B00KXJC0JC|5|Love it
B0031ER6MM|4|The person I bought it for really loved it.
B010XN588W|2|Fits a little funny
B0088FT3G6|5|Nice Wallet.<br />I received this wallet in 3 days, I like the way it feels.<br />I have 3 Credit card, debits, and my work ID and Holds them pretty good! I love the front pocket that it has.<br /><br />Overall a very good Wallet, have it for over 2 months and for the price that you pay, you cant ask for more!
B00N5PQ0HE|3|It would be a great coat to use if it was more true to size. I did like the style and color and concept except it was too small. usually xl but bought 2xl to be safe and it fit too small.
B000783NU4|5|Great shirt. Not too thick, but still keeps me warm. Fits perfectly.
B004YZ84RS|4|This product solved the problem of wedgies for my 5 year old daughter. Its great value for the price - 8 underwear, well packaged with attractive designs. The quality of the cotton is a bit thin but it serves its purpose well.
B00O3P091S|5|I absolutely love this shirt. I use it as a baselayer when cycling in wintertime. It's great at keeping me at a comfortable temperature, but it's not a bulky layer. I like the stitching detail. I like the thumb holes. I use them so much I've stretched it a bit in the wrist area. I'm a curvy woman but the xl fit perfectly.
B008KCJY2U|4|more large
B0067LMRZM|3|I bought two and one is not bad, a bit matronly on though.  The other is over an inch longer and much looser and looks too big, doesn't hug my middle closely.  It actually makes me look bigger than I am.  I washed and dried it and no change in the fit.  I will keep it to wear around the house.
B005C2WKE0|2|This jacket is junior cut not made for adults!  My husband is 5'8 and weighs 155, bought the xl [read the other reviews running small] thought xl would work. Not!! The collar is really batman like as well. I do like that it is faux leather.
B00CN9BGHW|5|Its a really cool stylish t-shirt that'll defiantly spark an interest to others around you! Recommend to kids, teens, and young adults!
B00LEV52YI|5|love it fast seller shipping
B00TPZNXKK|4|I bought this for my baby shower in purple. Sure the material is on the cheaper side, but you get what you pay for! Also, I don't mind the lighter weight fabric especially in 85 degree weather at 34 weeks pregnant! Did come with a faint cigarette smell despite being wrapped well for shipping, but I just put the dress in the dryer on a low setting with a dryer sheet and slightly damp washcloth. Got the smell and the wrinkles out! I'm tall (5ft 7.75in) so I did not mind the skirt being long. Hit an inch above my knees. Looks just like it's pictured.
B000BU0BEE|2|This is a good working shirt - for gardening, play.  Definitely not for work.  It shrunk so order a size larger.
B000VXZ0VA|5|Carhartt products continue to be well made at a good price. This is no exception. A sturdy warm hat that is actually the size it is suppose to be. Even fits well  with the ear cover up. I would recommend this hat, good buy.
B00RG7DWHI|5|It is very nice
B00347AJ2A|5|These are the best fitting, most comfortable, panties I've ever worn.  The mocrofiber has a luxurious silky feel.  The waist band is built in and never rolls.  There is no tag to irritate.  I give Barely There Hi Cut Pants a five star rating.
B009GYKDB2|5|LOVE THEM
B00G4RARFQ|5|awesome my daughter loved it
B00KHNJSX0|5|this was great.
B00N6XREMA|5|Although I usually order a medium, I read the reviews which were helpful and ordered a large, which fits very well on me, Love the hat, and have received lots of positive compliments on it. A very good cold/cool weather hat.
B006G7JXM2|3|Too Small.
B00K3J3DT8|4|nice dress for thin body
B00V688H96|1|This is the 3rd version of this shirt, 2nd version was the best.  This version is not as fitted at the waist, and is just not tailored as well overall, baggy on back of shoulders/arms.  Price has almost doubled, this is a $3.00 shirt.  It will only last 10 or so washings before it pills too much, and loses it's shape.  I have previous versions that have outlasted the new version already.  I am 6'3&#34;, 190, athletic build (44 in. chest, 33 in. waist) and an X-Large fits just right, I normally wear a large.  The previous version was much better made.  I have had seams rip completely out on brand new shirts at first washing.  Too bad, was a great T at a fair price.
B00HPQQQJG|5|Fits perfectly and is well made. Love the look and now comfortable it is.
B000TA8LJ8|5|Best , toughest work socks I've ever worn. Fit and comfort, long lasting, worth every cent. I buy these to replace my other brands as they wear out.  Can't go wrong.
B00JEM88YA|4|Nice value
B00OTZGHJ0|5|It fits perfect looks cute with any hat or pants
B00HAV6VLE|3|The skirt fit perfectly, the problem is the material. If it didn't look so cheap I would wear it all the time... I feel like I'm wearing a halloween costume. I got what I paid for though and it doesn't seem like it'll fall apart easily so at least I can keep it for a rainy day.
B002RYXC5C|5|Love these gloves, somehow I didn't see that there were different sizes so mine came small, which actually fit OK anyway.  I love them anyway, are very warm, have even taken them off in the car because my hands were too toasty!
B005QEOSX0|5|this wallet filled my expectations, the leather cover seems to be an excellent material, the cards slots are space-full, you can take any of them with one hand, the inly problem i found was the midle tab with the net, this tab isn't as accessible as one could wish, it's a kind of hard to put an id in there, because of the size reduction to fit in the middle of the wallet, but it fits after all, in conclusion i recomend this wallet to any one who wants a real leather wallet that may lasts forever
B0085AP7BE|4|The sweater fit me well and looks nice. It is also warm and goes well with a shirt or t-shirt.
B00Q3J15QK|5|Cute pajamas!!
B000FI4QHA|5|I bought this glasses and thought they were just regular sunglasses. When I started using them I realized: great design, great shape, great fit. Excellent service on the delivery
B001VN2N5A|4|Nice belt. Not as wide as I was expecting but nice quality
B00KKWG21Y|4|Lil bit big but good quality and speedy delivery
B00EKRKCHU|4|Very warm and comfy. They were bigger than I expected.
B00DQYOOMM|5|Purchased two of these for my sons and the jackets worked perfectly in a summer downpour!  They were cool in the summer heat and kept them totally dry.<br /><br />Purchased one size up and it fit them perfectly.
B003AIKX3I|5|Our 4 month old is long so we had to move up to 6-12 month kickeepants already. I think it all depends on the individual baby's size, however they do seem to run bigger than other baby clothes (ie my son cannot fit in Carter's 6 month sized clothes)<br />These are my favorite brand of baby clothes for both softness and quality, our little guy seems most comfortable in these too.<br />I wash these in cold water and hang them to dry overnight to keep them vibrant. This might seem like too much extra work but I do it gladly just for these articles of clothing because I am obsessed. They are luxurious, and in my opinion, worth the extra TLC.<br />A huge &#34;plus&#34; that separates these footies from other brands with similar styles in our baby's wardrobe: the actual feet on them are long like little elf shoes, they don't crunch his toes (again, our baby is long)<br />I started off with one of these that I found in a high end baby boutiquenow I'm surfing amazon all the time to swoop them up whenever I see them on discount! Love
B00COLS7V2|5|Gave as a gift
B00HJKU3WE|2|This is the smallest tote bag I have ever seen. You can't put much in it. It can be used as a kids lunch bag.
B0058CUOTW|4|everything fits beautiful, but still have two pocket tees on backorder.
B00ACIGYOG|4|A lot hotter than I need! But I live in Mexico-- I imagine that they're OK for temperate climates .. in autumn and winter.<br />The quality if good and they wash well and come out looking good. Good stitching and uniform size.
B00ARUY0UO|4|I bought size 24 mo for a 32# baby who lives overseas.<br />I gave it 4 stars only because it has a lot of 'glitter' on the shirt and I'm not sure how well it will stand up in a poorer country.
B00WCP8P30|5|Love it! My daughter wore hers for her first day of kindergarden
B00SJH89JA|5|Very nice looking and on time. Thank you for meeting my expectations
B00OZUG10E|1|Omg Horrible
B000N8MWS2|5|This is truly a spectacular scarf. The deep orange-red of the flowers is beaded in the same vibrant shade. It is as though the darkest part of each bloom is alight. I hoped the scarf would be okay with a new suede jacket in the same red-orange; the scarf is far more beautiful than I could have imagined.
B00IPSDX5S|5|Love wearing my state with pride. Well made and flattering.  Slightly fitted.
B00EDBT5V2|1|Very meh and wouldn't get again.
B006SRTFGY|5|perfect! And quick delivery.
B00P0E2SI8|5|Sometimes a special dress or skirt needs to have a little more bling, a little more fullness and that is where this product shines.  This is layered so it brings forth fullness without any  uneven areas. It is also comfortable next to the skin, no itchy material there.  My granddaughter, who is a teenager, feels this makes a beautiful skirt. Of course I feel it is to give fullness to a beautiful dress. However, it is so perfect there are many uses for it so why tie it down to only one.  This is very well made, is not going to rip easily and appears it will hold up for quite a while . Nice Product received for a honest review.
B00A0GLAM6|5|funny and way cool
B00JAJCNTS|5|Beautiful shirt! Just right for right now! Love the matching silky lining! Hope to see this shirt in more available colors. Shipped quickly!
B007WHW5TI|5|Good quality and perfect fit. I'm small, so this one is just good on me. It is very elastic, so I believe it still works if I gain weight.
B00D3D4ASE|4|Warm jacket and great for the price
B00FM8IPAW|4|Since I have large hands I can only hope that gloves would fit as well as these. I am happy with the purchase.
B00LZQKFP8|1|Ordered mens Xxxl. What a joke. Don't waste your money. Very disappointed. Extremely small.
B00EK5TEYE|5|Beautiful Scarf!!!
B009BKWE9U|5|The quality of this purse organizer is great. I will use one for my purse and another to put in our car to hold all the stuff that accumulates when we travel.  several pockets, 2 zippered sections, snaps to expand to make larger.  great also for a gift.
B00KCK5JVS|5|great shirt
B00ANLR5RW|5|I love this dress. The fabric is nice, very well-made. The colors & pattern are even prettier than in the pic. Order this dress if it caught your eye like it did mine. You won't regret it!
B00JPXN442|5|Quick delivery and as promised
B0089MQKT6|5|Great shirt, great value!
B005OU9BK6|5|This was a perfect sweater for my sons holiday celebration.  It fit true to size, is well made, and washed up nicely.  It's too bad he will out grow it before next year.  However the quality is good enough to pack away for his younger brother.
B00OL4GBEU|2|Its a very pretty skirt but the free size or one size description is wrong. My waist is 25&#34; and it was still too tight. Should be advertised as a juniors rather than a womens skirt. It has a drawstring but it is pointless because its sewn into the too-tight elastic waistband. Also, it is rather see through and needs a slip, but that's not my main complaint. I will be returning this product.
B00DW7ME5W|4|I'm going to contradict some other reviewers here - The brand is not associated with Polo Ralph Lauren, it is still good quality and is cute but don't be fooled, it says right on the tag that this brand is not affiliated. Also, the Mellon color looks peach online and someone noted that the stripes are brown. I just received mine and the color is very neon pink and the stripes are certainly black. Also good to note since I couldn't tell from the photo or description, this is not an athletic top with any built in bra support, just a tank top, 1 layer. I am happy with it, very cute and a good addition to my work out clothes.
B00H4SMZTK|5|I ordered the sister dress to this one in yellow and green so I just had to have this one in the shades of the ocean.  A great fit and I can't wait to wear it to church this Sunday!
B00BY0FYN8|2|The buckle on the front is gold toned not silver toned as pictured, kept it anyway but, a disappointment the same...
B00M7OC6HM|5|Fit
B002DUXTO4|5|Awesome costume<br />And great seller!
B00O6ZS0LQ|5|Quailty
B00ISRCCMQ|4|Perfect fit
B001I0SVX4|5|Fits perfect just what I wanted. Very well made. A lot of style.
B008H493H2|4|I really like the coat but the overall fit is smaller than the chart led me to believe. I ordered a large as I always do and should of went up one size.
B00594AOGM|5|The jeans are well made and perfect fit.  I'm 5'5\\", 115 lbs, and the Size 2 X 32 fit exactly as I hoped.  It is so hard to find quality black jeans with a good fit.  I'm so glad I found these.
B00N5N96ZY|2|The slippers were way to small and I have to donate them. The robe was a little to small but she loved it and is going to get some use out of it.
B00C20E5UM|5|Perfect! Very comfortable and practical. Love them!
B0011YG0EO|5|This bra supports so well while giving a really nice shape as well. I always feel confident and sexy wearing this bra. I am always a 34C bra size and this bra has just the right amount of control while not digging into me. Love this bra-feel great in it.
B00GNU6A8C|5|I just love this dress I got a size two xl duet to the fact that one customer said that the dress Is tight In the arms of the dress the entire dress fits me lovely and it came early than estimated delivery date
B00P57LQ7Y|5|love it.  warm enough for snowy days in Germany.  the brim has cardboard or something in it, which will make it difficult to wash, but otherwise it's adorable.
B004YDR53E|5|I loved this blouse but I'm going to have to return it.  I ordered a large but it simply doesn't fit.  It really seems like a small.  If you have a 36-38 C cup then you should definitely get 1 X if it comes in that size.  The print and the quality are lovely though and the picture doesn't do it justice.  I usually wear a large but not in this case.
B00TA3CY8Y|5|Perfect suit for my guy. He had to get a suit to be in a wedding and this was perfect. Pants were a little big, but we just had them altered. He's a little shorter and pretty thin. The rest of the suit and shirt for perfect!!
B002QRCLWK|1|I ordered a wool bucket hat with attached scarf from them for $19.99. With shipping, the total was nearly $26. They shipped it to me via First Class Mail in an envelope and profited greatly on what they charged me for shipping, so don't be deceived by their low price. When I received the hat, I discovered that it was tiny and could only fit a small child, even though it is supposed to be a hat for adults. I wrote to Luxury Divas and they said it is obviously a manufacturing error and they would refund me when they received the hat back. I returned the hat with a confirmation tracking number, and the return shipping was almost $6. They only refunded the price of the hat, so I'm out almost $12 in shipping on a $19.99 item that I do not have! This company justified screwing me by simply saying I should have seen their return policy. Luxury Divas lacks integrity and has no concept of good customer service! You are better off staying very far away from them and their defective merchandise, because they will not make it right after they screw you!!
B009IY0A9K|5|So... we picked this (and every character) up for Christmas for our daughter (2) who loves Gabba.  The only issue that we have run into is that this, and all the peruvian style Gabba hats (with the dangle ears & string) are that they are adult sized and tend to run quite large.  This Foofa hat is the biggest of the bunch and on my head (adult male) with an average sized noggin it's still pretty big.  If I put it on my daughter it's almost impossible to keep out of her eyes.<br /><br />I will review each item individually, but in case you're only looking at one of them I will break them down by size (at least our experience with size) here and in each review to try to help.  This list is in order from smallest to largest.  (Plex, Muno, Brobee, Toodee, Foofa)  We also got the DJ Lance Beanie and it's still adult size, but as a beanie it's small enough to still fit relatively well on our daughter without falling off or covering her eyes.<br /><br />The hat is very warm and is a great sleep hat as it's been exceptionally cold this winter.  Also, fantastic to embarass older children if you are willing to wear it out in public. :)
B00CWB0AM8|5|Came surprisingly quick since it shipped from the UK. Material is soft, not see through. Order a size smaller than what you normally wear. I'm a small and ordered an XS and it fits perfect. I would hand wash it though
B00B9FLGTE|1|Poor quality. Get loose after a few hours wearing. Can't wait to throw it into garbage.
B00M0ZBLU6|5|Suslo Couture Men's B2 White Button Down Shirt<br />Love this shirt. It has a very Gucci look to it. The fit is perfect. If you generally wear a L, get an XL as I did. It fits close to the torso. So unless you like that look, order a size larger than usual.<br />I highly recommend this shirt to anyone who has a taste for good styling. This shirt can be dressed up with slacks, or dressed down with jeans.
B009454ELS|5|excelente
B00OH25C4Q|5|This was a GREAT quality corset! it even had a cute leopard inner lining. I think i might have gotten it a size to small and please keep in mind that it is extremely long! which is why i got it. I however could wear it for long it was just not for me so i had to return it. Return was fast and easy. Great customer service would def buy from here again.
B00PW36P3G|4|They are nice--
B008YWHD56|2|I like the style but they are cheaply made and see through.  Don't waste your money.  I was disappointed with the poor quality.
B00KDQ4BPG|4|Arrived on time - as always with Prime - really cute and soft! I tried to use them on a 6 month old in my photography studio, because they looked big enough, but it was a tight squeeze! His chunky little legs just barely fit in them - I managed to get some cute pictures of him though! So even though they say Newborn, they could also fit an older baby. I think they would fit a 1 month old up to a 4 month old better. All in all I really liked them :) The mom was happy too!
B00KM8H5S0|5|my daughter loves it!<br />the lace is very classy and makes the shirt more feminine than a plain tee shirt.
B00H70TGHO|5|Really comfortable and it does push up! It stays in place all day and is so lightweight. I'm a 32a and it pushes up and holds them together!
B00JUFPF4W|5|thank you
B0062IE5Y6|5|I love this little top. Received plenty of compliments. Fits well. Cut a little low, so I word an undershirt for work.
B00MXM3ZXW|5|Love it, soft, fresh and nice.
B00QLH3CVU|4|After reading the other reviews, I decided to go for the XXL. I wear a 14 size jean and am 5'8. It fit pretty perfectly.
B00AHTK5RC|3|It fitted somewhat small so I suggest you buy a bigger size then you usually wear.Otherwise it would be comfortable.
B00LU0PFV8|5|Love these pj's!!!!  Actually fit my tall and growing boy and they aren't super slim like some other brands that make it impossible to wear.  He's just getting into 18 month sizes so the 18-24 is perfect with some room to grow into. They are light weight so on chillier nights we add an undershirt.
B003J4HC6Y|4|This item was a good fit for my head. I recommand this item to people whos heads are 24\\" or smaller.
B00DBDV9ZS|1|Shrinks after one wash.
B004LWH1ZA|5|I wore this with Pride the day after Alabama won the BCS National Championship Title!  I received alot of compliments!  Roll Tide!  Hounds Tooth Plaid seems to be an icon of Alabama!  Loved it and I wear it as often as I can!  I have ordered other itens from Amazon that are matching accessory items!
B005EM41KE|5|Baby socks can be really tricky - many are too small, some are too big, most don't stay on well at all, some are too tight. These are just right in all of those areas. They work well over the hands to keep my daughter from scratching herself, too. Over the hands, we turn them inside out so she doesn't get a bunch of sock fuzz in her palms and between her fingers.
B00W7JOPSA|4|Really enjoy the pouch, feels great, just wish it was more of a &#34;trunk&#34; than low rise.
B00HXRUMDI|5|perfect
B008DRQNFS|5|Very nice product.  Quick on the delivery.  Very nice look and feel.  Great price.  Size runs a little large, glad i went with the medium.
B000E31D5E|5|Did not like the way these looked on me. I prefer the capris, but Danskins are a good product. I believe I returned these with no problem.
B0007XGKM2|5|Great shirts, love them
B00421BP2K|5|This nightgown is very attractive but, even more important, it is very comfortable.  The straps cross in the back, so no slipping off your shoulders.  Best of all, however, is that the fabric is 94% modal (bamboo) which is very soft and absorbent.  For those of us experiencing hot flashes at night, this fabric is great!  The other 6% is an elastic so the nightgown tends to follow body curves closely. If you have some extra bulges you'd rather not accentuate, you might try a size larger than usual.
B00GMEVLQA|5|good boxer
B004L6JG6S|5|My husband really loves these shirts! He needs the pocket. The color is great on him. The cuffs are snug which he enjoys! GREAT SHIRTS!!! GLAD we found them here!!!
B00EQV0AQI|1|Just ridiculous how wrong the sizing is on these shirts. Maybe for kids it would be all rite but not anywhere close for a real person to fit correctly.........COME ON ! Fix the sizing or the shirts.... COME ON !
B00DZ7VA9U|4|This was reasonable, and with ironing and some work with the hat, worked well.  I dampened the bent parts of the hat, and then used a hair dryer and then some heavy books to flatten it out.  Worked great!
B00CK819Q4|4|They feel and look awesome,they are both stylish and sexy and somewhat naughty.The color is nice and delivery was earlier then expected.
B005KSZHHI|5|Can you add your own buckle to this belt? I'm just looking for a belt to add a buckle to please help
B0064YYFWA|3|I don't hate it, but I don't love it...<br />I'm sure I'll find a use for this briefer when the weather cools off some, but it probably won't be well suited for what I was hoping to use it for, which was a one piece deal to wear under gauzy summer dresses.  The material is quite warm, it fits snugger than I'd like (I'm not exactly conventionally proportioned, and could have used more room in the rear, honestly) and the bra area is not as supportive as I hoped.  I ordered my bra size of 36D, and I do wonder if a larger size would have given me a better fit overall, but then the top would probably be even less supportive.  Along with being snug, the fabric isn't as durable as I'd hope, because my thumb popped right through some of the lace just from grabbing it at the bottom seam, and pulling it down.  It is fairly comfortable, despite feeling snug.  I'm not familiar with briefers at all, but I'm also usually not very picky, and I'm not going to return this, even though it didn't end up being useful for what I hoped, I'm sure I'll find a use for it eventually.
B007XPO0YC|4|The jacket is very cute and fits well, but is a little lighter weight than I thought. It wouldn't work as an outdoor winter jacket (unless you live in a warmer climate during those months). Overall it is adorable and very affordable.
B007U46U1M|5|liked
B00BSMKDVK|3|I have to send this one back as soon as I find out how to do it! Do I need a return label?<br />The lace looks a little cheap with the threads hanging on the sleeve.
B00EZK0VB4|5|I am about 5'4&#34; and 120 lbs, I got the large because I didn't want to legs to be short- it fits perfect. The package arrived about 2 weeks early which was perfect. The fabric seemed thin but very soft (like silky soft) so I put in long shorts and a tank under the first time I wore it which was too much. It's really warm! The zipper on the back opens a butt flap but its not idealy for women, you still have to take it off to use the restroom. I am definitely going to get another one... Just can't decide which one :)
B001E1H80O|5|Long, but I did get the 32 so I did want it a little longer on me. They fit really nicely under my bellybutton but does not show anything in the back.
B004UUKPEC|5|Love it! But 2 small for me!
B00JDCQA1E|5|This dress was absolutely perfect. I received so many compliments. My husband loved it. The material is very lightweight and comfortable. It's not lined so I suggest some Spanx if you have a little baby fat or any little imperfections in some areas because this dress will show it all but with the correct under garments(if you need it) you will be the Belle of the Ball. People even thought I lost a few pounds because the dress accentuated all my curves. I mean it fit like a glove. I wear a size 14, I'm 5'9, and lusciously vivacious at 170lbs.  I'll post a pic another time. I love Angel-fashions they are truly Heaven sent!!
B00MHFDN96|1|Had a strong chemical smell, and fit poorly.
B0026BM86K|5|Exactly what I expected!! Loved it
B00E1ZOULA|5|Bought in May 2015. Comfy, good material, belt is attached so it's not lost, pockets for convenience, and a little strip of cloth at the neck that allows it to be hung up. I wish it were a tad longer, but I like the quarter sleeves.
B0055I74YM|5|Great T shirts, Fit Great, theses Shirts Last too.
B003UA9Q84|1|This bra has a really weird fit. It pushes up but doesn't really minimize. I'll return it. Not sure what its purpose is.
B00K2QLZUG|5|This swim suit honestly looks good on EVERY body type. From super curvy to super skinny girls, it truly looks flattering on every woman. I feel so pretty in it and super comfortable.
B00IV4JSI2|5|Love this top!  Just noticed the pot leaf! Love it even more now.
B0082944QC|5|Thank you so much for the cinderella costume.  It works just fine. The dress fits better. Thanks for everything you do
B00EV5DQAG|5|These are high-quality and fit my 3-year-old perfectly.
B00TIRMSSS|3|Like other reviewers have said, the shirt runs a bit small, so I'm glad I sized up, especially after I washed it. I normally wear a 1X-sometime 2X, so I ordered the 3x... and now it fits like a 1X. The material is a thick cotton, and is very comfy, but yes, there seems to be much more glitter than in the picture, and it does rub off a bit. The price is right to make this a pretty knock-around t-shirt, but don't wear it to bed or wash it with other dark clothes unless you want your world to be a bit more sparkly.
B00F52M5QA|4|Read the recommendation to order a size larger.  Don't!  I've got big hips but a small waist, and these are way too big around the waist.
B00A67G26S|5|I highly recommend this dress for that special occasion. Flattering on and easy to find shoes for. A very favorite!
B00NQFK5IS|5|I LOVE THIS! ITS WORTH IT! THANK YOU SO MUCH...
B007U4BND2|5|So Perf, fast shipping super warm, and I got a medium I am 5'7-8 I way 125lbs. I could have got a small but I wanted thd sleeves to be long enough and they are I am glad I got the medium cause that way for sledding I can put layers udder it!!! Seriously perfect and it's gonna look stellar with my moon boots oh yeah!!!!
B00KGH7YBK|1|Bad product. Not thigh highs, full tights. The faces only go to the knee not the thigh so the image gets stretched and distorted. Also seemed like it could be washed maybe once before they start unraveling. Poorly made
B00DND4WS2|5|The shirt is good quality and thick as expected, you'll have a warm impression when you'll put it on, it's lovely. Far away from the old shirt of lumberjack, the shape is pretty slim fit which is easier to wear.
B002NVCPQ6|5|perfect
B000VYYSK8|4|Will wear a pirate scarf under that should help with fit.
B00QPYWNTG|1|this one is terrible too.  so cheap looking.  would work better as a Halloween costume.  so bad but too expensive to send back to china.  trash trash!  shame on amazon for offering this trash!
B00D7WFMK6|5|Excelent product. Working just the way I wanted it to .Thank you.
B0042U3HEK|5|Pretty good hair bows.
B00L40R6WU|4|I didn't know the zippers were going to be GOLD not fond of it but otherwise I love it
B00B5RAIN6|5|Thanks for the fast shipping.  And I like to wear it while dancing!!
B00GGASZ1Y|5|awesome
B00AEVRM1K|5|My dad, a Vietnam vet who owns several leather jackets in the $400+ range, was amazed by the quality. I'm a Navy fanboy so I'll buy anything that is used the the Navy or Marine Corps. Bonus points for not being made in China. A leather Navy G1 made in U.S.A. Hell yeah! Apparently you're supposed to buy a size smaller so that it will fit on your body, so i got a size 40, but it was too short for my torso. Customer service was helpful and thorough they guided me through an exchange process and how i'm happy with my new jacket. My only gripe is that for some reason, the left sleeve seems more wrinkled that the right side. Hopefully in the future, this won't be a problem because when I'm riding, the want the wear and wear to show.
B00PDIBM7Y|5|Just one issue:  these are stretchy.  When I read what they were made of, I thought it said &#34;100% cotton&#34;, which is what I wanted. However, when they arrived, they are the stretchy stuff, like most &#34;jeans&#34; are now.  But that aside, these are good pants. Fit really well, feel good. Not too low, not high. Good pants.
B0029NYHR8|5|Just a quick note to express how pleased I was to be able to find these jeans on Amazon. Arrived as promised, great fit, great wearing...don't know why Lee stopped making them. Very nice jeans, excellent material, good feel.
B00UD2OYM0|5|A very nice belt that feels comfortable.
B0051D7YDC|4|Other than a small gap at the waist, the fit is perfect.<br />I am ordering another pair.
B00ARNR012|3|Good quality but fit too large- I am 5' 9&#34; 145 lbs. Its funny too because I was thinking it would fit a bit small so I could get a little squeeze out of it which I recommend when ordering dresses with the backs cut out like this one but had to return it since I do not know a magnificent dressmaker/tailor/seamstress who can adjust the dress without it looking like a cobbler worked on it.
B005NCBFIQ|5|loved the shirt but it starts to fade about 15-20 washes.
B00553PHK0|4|This cardigan is light and stylist which is perfect for summer. I can wear with tank top under or any light shirts in summer. Good quality and cheap!
B00L1Q42EM|5|These jeans fit perfectly!
B00AAHSFMS|5|Love it!
B004M4CSZA|5|My kids seem to want to hug me more in this shirt.<br />I really love it. I am a stay at home mom, and I do not<br />need to dress up a lot. I wear this with leggings to take<br />my daughter to gymnastic classes. Who doesn't like a<br />Panda?. My husband had to smile at my new shirt. He<br />said he would never wear it, lol. I also got this one too big,<br />but it still works. I can sleep in my big shirt. It is comfty,<br />but a little itchy and hot. Must be the material, but it can<br />heat you up quickly.
B00JA6RPX0|3|I'm a small girl with 34 C boobs. It was cute, but the bow on the butt part was sewn off center... which really sucked. I could always restitch it myself. That's what you get for the price though.
B001TQISQ2|5|This is actually my second one, as the first one finally wore out after about 15 years.  It's a great alternative to the traditional wallet, although I carry both this and a wallet.  I use it to carry a credit card, some cash and a few business cards.  I keep the things I need to carry but don't need to pull out very often (license, insurance cards, extra cash & cards, etc.) in my wallet.  However, a more disciplined person might be able to get rid of the wallet.  It's a great improvement over the traditional money clip, as you can carry the additional items, and your cash/cards aren't out there for the world to see when you pull it out of your pocket.<br /><br />I've bought a number of Bosca products over the years, and have found them to be very well made and durable.  They &#34;age&#34; well, and still look pretty good after many years of regular use.
B00QJ0V888|4|ok
B005CEWG88|5|very good quality product.
B00RFI8DB8|5|Good! like it.
B00CRWH7QE|5|Got it as a gift for him and he looks great in it! It is casual but VERY comfy. He loves it!
B006C9ASDM|3|It's what I expected.
B00M90FY7I|5|At first I was a little disappointed because it was more floppy than was pictured.  But, I stored it upside down for a few days before I needed to wear it, for a Derby party, and it helped straighten it out.  Not disappointed anymore.  Ever since then, it has looked just like this picture.  Adorable.
B00NIN1KF0|5|Great quality sweater and received a lot of compliments.
B00YC2ML0E|5|Perfect color and fit!!
B0009WKIIS|4|I purchased this product for my new job once I received my business cards. I was pleased with everything from the presentation of the nice box that it came in to the quality of the leather.  The product exceeded my expectations. I will recommend this product to anyone looking for something similar.
B00LP47LIE|1|This item was as advertised. The size medium was 32-34 and the inseam was advertised as 30 which I overlooked when I bought it but was acceptable when I tried them on. The problem was when I washed them they SHRUNK to 26. The seller agreed to refund the cost of the product but not the shipping or the return shipping. I decided to keep them and make a scarecrow . BUYER BEWARE
B00TZ5FUT2|4|With how hot this summer has been, I was desperate to find a 'cooling' shirt to help while out and about in the heat. The material of this shirt is unlike anything I have had before. It feels thick and of good quality, but when you wear it it truly is lightweight.<br /><br />If there was any downside, it's sweat marks. It's hard not to break a sweat walking around when it's 90+ degrees outside, it's perfectly expected, but when this shirt gets wet, it gets very dark. Just a fair warning!!
B0071UGQAA|5|Amazing. I received such a nice and beautiful dress more than i expected. I buy 18 mos for my 6 mos old chubby baby and it's just right for her. Planning to buy other princess faith products. I also love the packaging very nice
B00EV0DOKI|2|The fit was perfect and the dress is adorable, but  the dress is very flimsy  and thin. You  can't wear it  without anything under it but it's impossible to wear anything under it.
B00LDF5DM6|3|The product arrived fast and the color is as pictured. The only reason I'm giving it three stars is because the bottoms fit a bit weird on the butt and there is literally zero push up in the top, so unless you have pretty big boobs it won't look that good. I'm a size 32C and ordered a small. It's pretty true to its size.
B004HLWK8S|5|love the feel and fit. good quality more girls should wear these panties I love them and my husband loves the feel of me in them
B0009MZY8W|4|Great sock, a little fuzzy but it fits well and my feat are not either cold or sweaty while wearing this sock. I will purchase this brand again, I will probably try one of their other models
B002GHK35C|5|I work 14+ hours a day and these bras are very comfortable, especially on the shoulders.  They wear well after washing and no underwire to worry about.<br /><br />Great support!!!
B00KC82KLM|5|I tried this coat on in a boutique. But they did not have the size medium.<br />Small was too tight on my bust, even though I am petite. And large was too much material and too long in the arms. So I ordered online and the medium fits perfectly.<br />It is a very flattering coat!
B00NAE7HPE|5|Adorable Halloween costume for my daughter - easy to put with white shirt & white jeans
B00BN5Z6HI|5|I will be reviewing my Persona 4 school uniform.<br /><br />Everything is stitched on the jacket, not painted on. It fits really well and all of the buttons work. There is slight padding inside the jacket to make the shoulders more broad. The collar stands up nicely, and it even works well when its folded down. The interior of the jacket has a line of fabric that is smooth. My only drawback on the jacket itself is the collar seems too big for me. It goes up to my ears.<br /><br />The undershirt looks and feels like one of my work shirts. There really is no difference, other than it fits nice and snug because its tailored to me. No complaints.<br /><br />The pants feel great. They may be just an inch too long, but that is easily forgivable. I may have made an error in my measuring. They have working pockets, and a sturdy zipper. There are belt loops, so wearing a belt is no problem. They feel baggy, but it fits well with the theme of the outfit.<br /><br />I wore the whole outfit now for only a little bit; Its main use will not be until October for a Halloween party. All I can say is the complete outfit felt snug but comfortable. I am really happy with how well this turned out.
B0009G8C3C|5|Very nice.  Easy to wear.
B004UBL84M|4|The bow tie has an adjustable band. So make sure you know your neck size or you might find it hard to tie a nice looking bow. When adjusting the tie you just need to place the little tab on the back end of the tie into the slot for your neck size.<br /><br />The bow tie is very nice looking and goes well with my turndown collar shirt.
B00LHH9PVA|1|Didn't meet expectations at all. The top looks weird is not well fabricated.
B007Y4OVPU|5|the shirt looks good on me.<br /><br />g o o d  s e l l e r ,  g r e a t  p r o d u c t
B000QURHUU|1|The bras are just packed with plastic bags.Besides, the quality is very poor. I am not going to wear them.
B00CUP8ASM|5|I bought these for my husband who needs an often hard to find 29&#34; inseam.  These fit perfectly and are very comfortable.  He is very pleased with them.
B00H5JTB4A|3|It's definetally pretty! But um well they gave me a scarf thats a little darker print and wayy shorter than the one on the photo. Guess it just depends on luck huh? :P
B00EL8HWBC|1|Way too small...sigh, get it together on the sizes please! Cup size was even smaller than normal. Really disappointing and it would take months to get a refund or to get a different size. Smh
B00CBR2COW|3|It doesn't look as good as it does on here. Somewhat disappointed, but it makes for a cool sweatshirt for the gym.
B004WPHQ7Y|1|Cheep flimsy costume that looks NOTHING like the photograph. As soon as I took it out of the packaging two buttons fell off and the seams were separating. I will never buy another California Costumes product again.
B0085KE2W4|1|I own approx 20 pairs of NYDJ and this was the only product that the sizing was way off. Probably by 3 sizes too small  Am wondering if they were a knock off<br />I did return them and got a very fast refund with no problem
B003ZSHHU0|5|I bought 2 more pair of David Lerner leggings after recieving my first pair...great fit and the quality is excelent.
B004NP4TSW|1|not what I expected .they were nice but just not the idea ones that I wanted they were not the best
B00DF1FLL4|5|When I wore this sport coat,I received many compliments.
B00FDND7AE|1|Doesnt fit like an xxl should. Too clingy too tight.<br />Not what you think buying....
B008RFG22K|5|Fits perfect. The quality is superior. These shorts will last a lot longer than some shorts I got from Walmart
B0081U1FGO|5|My daughter is due in December and this is perfect for that!!!!  It's warm and adorable for winter!! This is just absolutely adorable!
B00KNUKLK6|4|I am a woman's size 12 so the XL fit since it is junior sizing.  The color is so beautiful and the fit is very flattering.  I had strangers come up to me and compliment me when I was out. The polka dots are printed on instead of being part of the fabric weave.  I would suggest washing it in cold water inside out on a hand wash or gentle cycle and then hanging to dry.
B00ED2XWTC|4|Gift for my daughter.  Fit well and she really liked it.
B009FPH2YI|3|My three month old at 12 pounds and above average length did not fit the 0-6 month size, it was way to big. It is cute and super soft, and looks really warm, but even at four months, she still swims in it.
B005GNM5YK|5|Fit great
B00NAFMZTG|5|Perfect fit, color and style.
B002XPWVDE|2|too larg and tall
B00OKD04R2|5|My daughter thought that it was a good coat for my grandson...I liked it as well
B000MXB5YK|5|Most comfortable.....really does pull in that tummy...
B0097G9DLK|5|It's great fits nice.
B004BKQPL8|5|My son wore this for Halloween.  Was a nice size and great quality for the price.
B009PY22W6|3|The hat Adam wears doesn't have any green on it. The underside of this hat's brim is green where it should be red.
B0053O1KHA|1|I moved to a different state, I spent years earning my degree, I earned sub-par wages as a doctoral student, I lived in sub-par housing, and even though I had grants and scholarships, I lived like a pauper because that money only paid for tuition and all my time and energy went into teaching and studying.  When I did earn from outside work, amounting to working 100 hour weeks, I had to report my earnings and it put my scholarships in jeopardy.<br /><br />And now you, Delicious, are telling me that I could have bought my diploma for 50 bucks??!!  Dammnn you, Delicious, dammnn you.
B0057RLSS4|2|shrunk after 1 washing
B00DTINL2Y|5|I gave this to my husband for his 55th birthday and he loves it!
B005UQ7R46|2|This item specified that the size is Adult Mens XL. When tried on it was way too small, so we compared it to other shirts. It is comparable to an Adult Mens Medium. It was meant for my husband but fits my son. I will keep it for my son...otherwise it would have to be returned.
B008G7NS4E|5|for my husband. he loves it. fits perfectly.
B003FMUSIO|4|True to size<br />Perfect fit and shape<br />Would definitely recommend this product and will definitely but it in the future.
B001KKSL0A|4|Great for a costume! Don't expect these to last forever unless you wash them very carefully.
B00F929KR8|2|I ordered this because of the &#34;active layer&#34; description and planned to use them for skiing.  When I opened the package I noticed they weren't the same as the other Cuddl Duds I have, but I figured that's because I didn't have the &#34;active layer&#34; style.  I washed and wore them right away, but was very disappointed in the fabric - it was NOT 4-way stretch as I expected, and the thumb-holes were very small and uncomfortable.  Although the top wasn't too tight, because it didn't stretch very well, it was constricting for skiing.  The item description said it included Spandex, so I thought it would be just right, but I am very disappointed.  I would return them if I could, and am now afraid to try other Cuddl Duds.
B00MTVNJ9M|5|Good product. Great price.
B009TCGJ3C|5|Nice hankie!  Just right with jeans.
B000JCXC7C|5|My daughter and I each got one, she has the green and it is wonderful for so much. A luau for sure, getting out of the shower, over your swim suit, as a skirt or shirt or just a wrap.  The size is perfect!
B00I4Y9NMU|5|I live in the South and wear dresses a lot in the summer so I like them to be easy to wash, not have to iron and comfortable.  This dress does it all.  I love it.  It fit perfectly (too long or me as I am only 5') so I had to have it shorten but that is not new.  It is very flattering and hangs great in the front to hide my belly.  I also bought another print - a little different and not quite cut the same but still a great buy and still flattering.
B002WUQCR6|5|A little less soft than some t-shirts, but soft enough that I'm not distracted by it. A large fit like my other large shirts, even after washing. Beautiful silk screening. I like to wear it when I'm off duty at the Academy.
B007MF3GUC|5|Excellent product....the best type of boxer from CK. My boyfriend love them they are the best! Since he bought one from CK he continue shopping here for CK microfiber boxer
B00B1FUHOW|5|This was a gift.  They loved it.
B005IB0OI4|5|Good quality and prompt shipping.  Very happy!!!
B007FOOGOK|5|Absolutely love this hat. Won't buy anything else.
B00WANM35U|5|Great products. Love them they're so cute
B0058O90AE|5|When I sent the first one to my daughter-in-law, I told her to watch closely when washed as it might shed. I don't know much about the fabric, but it was plausible it might shed. She said it didn't shed or have any problems. My little granddaughter must have it at bed time, and  if it is in the wash, she won't accept a different color (that I gave another granddaughter in the house). Even in the dark, she knows hers. I've been asked if I could send a second one and I just ordered it in the favored color, white with bright pink edge. It is a good blanket in my opinion, and very soft.
B00HG6EAXE|3|cute fir but not for swimming in ocean as pocket captures sand
B0026NQPB2|5|I was pleased with my daughters dresses, they looked good on her, and she liked them her self, I am glad I was able to purchase them that day.
B00JMZ80W4|1|I ordered to wear this summer and when it arrived at my house it was too small. I was realy disappointed.
B00JTQFKHY|1|The fabric is soft but waaay see through. I put them on and the letters started peeling apart. This is ridiculous.
B00BEMKYD6|3|I was disappointed that there were two robes and no PJ's in the package.  Not what was advertised.  Not sure why the item was mis-advertised, but beware!
B00AV6HNIU|2|Didn't wear it cause it was bigger then expected and pants were way to long .. Made for a real tall person.
B00LJOHZA4|5|Amazing costume quality. I had many questions when ordering this costume, and the client was quick to respond and very helpful. I would definitely order from Onecos again. Very fast shipping.
B00AKATIE4|4|Was looking for coverage for upper thigh area, definitely works for this but the skirt piece is higher to the back so your bum shows a bit. Skirt not same level all the way around. Fits well to size though. Looks really cute for a skirted bottom, not like old lady style. I like it
B00OWDHZGS|5|fast service at a great price
B00J7ICI74|5|Great jeans brand, love it! My wife is around 5'6 ,121lb and size 27 was too big, so had to reorder her usual size 26. Nice color, nice fit, pleasant to the body material, great jeans !!!!
B00HT13F96|4|This fit perfectly but it is way, way too long.  I am 5'5'' so I'm not short or very tall, just average.  I think if it is hemmed it will ruin the dress but I'm going to ask around to see if something can be done.  I need at least six inches off of it, maybe more.  I would have given it five stars if not for that because it is such a beautiful dress and makes me look good - if only I could walk in it and not trip.  Tall heels don't help either.  It is really, really long.
B001AVC52E|4|It looks good with dress. But the size runs little bit small.
B00EVPPG7M|5|I love this dress and would consider ordering it in different colors.  The green color is very flattering, and I received so many compliments when I wore it.  I love it because you can dress it up with some heels and nice jewelry, or you can dress it down (I wore it with a blue jean vest).  I would definitely recommend it.
B0031IFAAS|4|I have a larger bust so the vest ends more at the top of my natural waist than at the top of my hips in the product picture.  Otherwise, it is a super cute vest and I still love it.
B00NCUDUFC|3|The lacy don't hang down very long on the side's.
B00DTX0QFE|5|confortable
B00KT1LMZC|5|great product
B001O8SQ08|5|You can't go wrong for less than $3. It is definitely better than buying a $40+ beanie from urban outfitters hah!
B002IT01NC|5|Quality product, as described.
B00862DEH0|4|I am a Medium size and I purchased the Large (US Medium) size of this shirt only to find out that it was still too small. I had to re-order an XL(US Large).
B00CHQ5E0G|4|I both received and gave this robe as a Christmas present. So this review is actually for the one I received, which was a dark brown and larger. It's incredibly soft, and so far has survived being washed and dried with no issues.
B002750OZM|5|A very nice belt.  A little stiff but it's new.  Made in the USA which made a difference to me.  Price was totally reasonable.  I am thinking of getting another one in a different color.  Nice belt, period.
B0084NQQUS|5|We live in Chicago and my 2 year old has been plenty warm in this coat.  I got a 3T and she should be good to go for next winter too.
B00RL8QGCA|5|unlike an orange one I bought this one is perfect! The cup size was perfect, not too much padding, great straps. I was very impressed with the bottoms because I have a big butt, and most bottoms don't fit me right and create weird indentations but this one fit perfectly! I got the Medium size. I am 5'2&#34; 145 lbs and cup size 36C
B002HJ2QO0|5|Great!
B00EXJ25AM|5|This is a very comfortable bra.
B003XWZ8PE|5|I read the reviews and saw why some people gave this tie a poor rating.  I have been teaching for many years and I have a different tie for every school day.  When I saw this tie, I feel in love with it.  It is unique in the fact that is double sided - very cool!  I also bought one for my son who recently graduated from college with his degree in teaching.  I will agree that the material is thicker than some ties however, that does not bother me.  The tie is beautifully done and my students tell me how much they love it.  I would recommend this tie for anyone with works with children.
B0084E7A48|5|Pefect fit and exactly what I wanted for my hot yoga classes...thanks!
B00MQ0JRTW|2|Arms are much shorter than expected - I would not say this is one size fits all.  The color is also not as in the photo, it's more of a blue-green.
B00465OH6I|4|Runs large, but a very good-quality garment.
B00F1ARUFM|3|Coat is good but needs some alterations (way too big)and something is wrong with the lining on the right arm. With the cost of the alterations the coat will end up costing what it would if I had purchased it at a shop. C'est la vie.
B00BO9B5WI|5|Graet Shirt, Nice Quality!
B00ABDLGCM|5|Went to Belize and this was great with the intense sun.
B00AI1YN86|5|Great hats
B00X35VIG4|1|First, it doesn't come with the liner as pictured. Secondly, I am normally a medium, I ordered a large to be safe. I couldn't get it over my head. So, there's that.
B0050AFYNS|5|They fit my husband very well. I'm doing the review because I bought them for him. And these are very good quality and price. Not to mention the quick ship. It was a win-win :)
B007GCJEWA|5|They are slightly bigger than other scrubs this size. They are comfortable and I love the pockets
B00EU7OZN2|5|Pretty top!
B002AT9EZ6|5|Ordering online from Amazon is great!  I had what I ordered very quickly and the t-shirt looked exactly like what I viewed online.  I love using Amazon as opposed to other t-shirt websites.
B001GI21MA|3|I got it for my brother for xmas, and it's a really cool shirt.  The only problem is that the black faded almost immediately after he washed it .  That is my only problem with it.
B00CBAOBDY|5|Carhartt quality as expected. Washed up beautifully, held its deep black color, did not shrink.. Fits exactly as expected, sized true to Carhartt sizing charts
B006GDANSE|4|I had been using the binders from the hospital after my twisn were born but they had always cut in right under by chest and was uncomfortable.  This provides the right amout of support and is really comfortable-stays up and doesn't ride down throughout the day.  It's not as tight as the binder but does provide a good amoutn of support.  I would have given 5 stars if it was just a little more supportive.  Overall I'm happy with this purchase.
B00T56Y6VO|5|I'm a size US 10, I bought the large, it fits very well, and -- I'm told -- it looks great. The fabric is a soft, washable (but not machine-dryable), woven polyester that has a pattern that reminds me of my mom's dresses from way back in the day. If this dress was available in other colors, I'd have gotten them all!
B00OE3L558|5|These gloves are awesome!  I have never had a warmer and more durable pair of gloves in my life.  They have a rugged look to them that I like especially when I wear my thick leather coat or peacoat on very cold days.  They are warmer then my regular leather gloves and do not get messed up by rain/sleet/snow, or when I have to carry things.  I highly recommend these gloves especially for the coldest days.
B00SA0NCA2|5|Super cute! My daughter was thrilled! I like that they are closer to ankle socks. She can't stop wearing them :)
B009G6MRLE|4|These bows were everything i was looking for, they look great and they are not to big but best of all they do not leave marks on my little ones head. The reason i gave them a 4star is because one of the bows came stretched out and it will not fit my baby girl until maybe 12months or more  but other than that the rest of the bows were in great condition
B00DQD6688|4|The dress is very nice. I'm 5'2&#34;, 119 lbs, 32DD and bought a size small. The only problem for me was trying to pull it over my chest. It isn't stretchy in the area beneath the breast, so trying to pull the dress over head was a challenge. I tried to step into it and pull it up, but the same issue occurred with my butt - couldn't get it to go over. Ultimately, I was able to get it on over head. Once I did, it was comfortable and cute. It's not as orange in person, but not completely coral either. I think it will look great with a tan, some nude heels, and gold jewelry :)
B00KJY4DCI|3|Like it it goes well with my dress that I bough a Maggie so it's cool 😉
B000VTMHFG|5|There isn't much to say. The shirt was exactly what I was looking for to wear with my Clark Kent costume. Perfect colors and excellent screen printing. This one is officially branded and the quality shows.
B0090EOJJA|3|I ended up returning this jacket as the hood wasn't removable and the description didn't make that known.  The material was nice and the jacket seemed well constructed - I just didn't want a hood flapping around while I snowboard so returned it and kept looking.  If the hood wouldn't bother you, I'd say give it a try!
B00K35J6VG|4|It arrived sooner than I thought it would with time to spare. Looks exactly as shown.
B00CO5FLSA|4|Nice bright colors. All cotton makes me worried about possible shrinkage so will have to line dry. Fit is a little on the small side but not bad
B00EMG3U8C|3|Not stitched properly on bottom of shirt, broken button when delivered
B002G9UEHC|4|Very warm, good price, good style and prime shipping makes this a super deal. I'm happy with this purchase. I even bought one for my brother.
B0015D21GM|5|I love this bag it matches with my baby red Britax stroller and still has a touch of pink for a girly kind of look. Its spacious, easy to clean and durable. Evryone loves it and asks me where I bought it. The price was exellent on Amazon. I love shopping on Amazon. Trouble free and full satisfaction.
B001VH6TW4|5|This is the third pack of these socks I bought. They are durable, comfortable, great value, and look great.
B00N71G7JC|5|My husband loves these hats! Fit is comfortable and washes up well
B007ISCEOC|5|good jeans
B005I34MVW|5|My son is a truck driver and it's difficult to find gloves that hold up to the wear and tear of this job. Most gloves rip after a few times of wearing. Although they don't last an entire season, they are warm and last longer then most.
B00EZRQ8ZA|5|Great fit!!!!
B001RUU1V0|5|Very nice pants for the price.  Look good and fit as expected.
B002F7F95M|5|A nice looking vest!!  Fits nice and looks great!!  Local stores did not have in stock.  Thanks Amazon!!
B000FALM6Q|1|I usually don't buy clothing from the internet, but, since my husband has worn this size of Wrangler jean for years I thought there would be no problem. I was wrong! Those jeans were no where near a 36X30. This episode will curtail my internet clothing shopping.
B00GMVIW3S|5|I wear scarfs on day that I don't want to leave my bed. I wore this scarf for the first time on Wednesday. It was like I never left my bed. It cradled my head like my beloved fuzzy purple blanket. Along with my cuppa joe, I was snug as a bug in a Houndstooth check fringed shemagh woman's scarf ALL DAY LONG.
B005OGZQAE|2|I BOUGHT THIS FOLLOWING THE SIZING CHART AND BOY I SHOULDNT OF.  THIS TOPS ARE TOO LARGE...DEFINATELY NEED A SMALLER SIZE.
B00C5TOXE8|5|Silky - smooth fabric, very soft to the skin. I love the bright but gentle colors. Very comfortable and fits perfectly. Perfect for the beach and summer time.
B00D80YC08|5|Beautiful....I get compliments when wearing this jacket. I am 5'9&#34;, 175 lbs and this fits gr8.  I also have long arms and I don't have a problem with the arm length.
B00AM35QKE|4|Well packaged and comfortable. I would order again if I needed to. They did have raw edges but I don't think they will unravel.
B006ZS92CS|5|I have been buying Lee'S twill pleated pants for the last 12 years, each time they are perfect fit and are long lasting. I would recommend these to everyone who wishes to look professional, yet comfortable.
B003TLN1XA|5|Its real cute with the buttons in the back, the quality is'nt the best but for the price its better then I thought it would be. It's a little too short to belt if your like me with a long torso, I'm real small in my upper body except 32D bust, and it fits a little boxy but I know thats the style so it's better then most. All in all it's totally worth the money!
B009OZUXC2|5|It fits well looks good.  I love it, love the fabric doesn't need pressing light enough for me since I live in the tropics.
B006OPQMFC|2|This is seriously half the price on the band's website.  Don't let yourself get ripped off, buy it somewhere else.
B0063ORRLW|5|I'm so glad I got this for my 5 year old! The dinosaurs are super-cool! The rubbery outer layer is soft and feels great, the terry inner layer adds a nice bit of warmth and thickness.The quality is fantastic and I'm hoping for a rainy Spring so he can wear it often. No more plastic ponchos! It's well worth paying extra for such a nice coat. I got a pair of Hatley rainboots with whales on them to go with this coat and they're great, too! I highly recommend this raincoat (and the boots)!
B0092K4KIC|5|The picture doesn't do it justice. Detail's great, and it's not too big to wear on an everyday basis. Love it!
B00S9NPPOG|5|Great, light weight material. Perfect for Spring, Fall and Summer evenings!
B0009MZTE6|5|I love Thorlo socks and own several different styles for different activities. My feet, especially the heels, are very narrow, and the cushioning really does help prevent blisters. This fitness style is light and comfortable for exercising.
B00328HRK8|5|These are really nice slacks -- comfortable and dressy.  Mine are a little big, but that's because I don't quite know what my size is right now (I put on some weight).  The price is right, too.
B005ACFCCO|3|cuter in the picture
B008MQP4TG|5|Love the shirt is cute and love the way it fits. It is a perfect conformable day kind of shirt.
B000T8LQTW|3|It's not very expensive so I don't expect it to be like regular hair but I found it a little hard to style it for the costume I was making.  It was sufficient for what I purchased it for.
B00GXVDAH0|5|My fiance loves these board shorts. The color is beautiful and they fit him very well. His only complaint is that there are no pockets in them. But who needs pockets while swimming? :)
B005GZ197W|4|These are a great pajama pant, lightweight, not too hot (usually my husband sleeps with his boxers on), but they are a little short for him.  Not sure if I want to pay shipping to return them as they were only 10.00, so definitely good price for what you get!
B001NSEC3Y|5|The pants fit perfectly.  I like the permanent crease and the expandable waistband.  I have waited for awhile to order a new black pair of pants and these are exactly what I wanted.
B005VNFFGK|5|Awesome. Daughter has trouble finding bras that fit. We ordered one then ordered three more. Her favorite bra, she wears it daily and not only for workouts
B005A3RUQO|5|I bought these for my husband and he likes them so much that I am getting him another pair as a stocking stuffer.  The fabric and fit are great.  Very soft and comfortable!
B00FSO3WC6|4|Cute, definitely on the loose side.  My boy is small so it looked a little baggy, but quality is great.
B00CI1ZB6M|5|My son is just not as big but the clothes are great... Good fabric, decent price I'm glad I purchased
B00B611R40|1|Very disappointed. Ordered this t shirt because it was glow in the dark. Unfortunately it was not. My friend's grandson was so excited when he thought it would glow that he wore it to his bday party and they had all sorts of things that were flow in the dark. This shirt was NOT one of them.
B00KOWT1DQ|5|Thanks
B00FSC68N8|4|Good fit for a large frame. I'm glad to find a product that doesn't<br />see &#34;Big and Tall&#34; as &#34;fat.&#34;
B003ILFVAC|5|I've ordered these shorts before because I love them. They are so comfortable. However, when I ordered my first pair two years ago, I bought a size Small (I wear size 4). I could wear them, but they were a bit tight-particularly after washing them. So I ordered size Large the next time...they fit perfectly even after washing them. They allow me a little room...I love them!
B008EDVC9S|5|Boyfriend loves it. Fast shipping
B00TWXEGYC|3|Great feeling soft cotton material. But was way smaller than most large shirt sizes. This should've been labled medium. Also the shirt on the product page looks orange but the shirt I received was red. Still loved the graphics though.
B003DWXHBG|4|I previously ordered a more expensive visor but returned it because I did not like the quality or fit for the amount I paid for it so I had to return it.<br />I ordered two of these, different colors, and I am so please with the fit and quality of the visor.
B00MXCWZRY|1|I want to return these. I just got them about a week ago and they're too small. I'm only 5'4&#34; tall and they aren't KNEE socks. They actually fit about like the picture shows on the mannequin. They're more like a young girls size, not womens. I'm disappointed.
B00KMUM4N4|1|This skirt has a weird chemical smell that will not go away no matter how many times you wash it.
B008VQ18LA|5|Good fit, nice color.  It seems sturdy.  I don't like to review things until I've had them for a while, but this shirt looks like it has staying power.
B008B3NVQI|4|Nice casual hat to wear with black or neutral colors.  It has elastic at the back, but runs a little bit small.  I would have loved it if it had not been &#34;distressed&#34;.
B00UI9J7R0|5|Great outfit at a great price. The colors are true to the picture as well as true to size.
B00KCOAAFY|5|Just what I needed for a cosplay and I can regular use from it as well. :)
B00D83GR3A|4|This is a great jacket for my 3 year old.  The zipper is nice and smooth.  Perfect for cool weather!
B00C577ET6|4|Super cute but a bit sheer. I would give 5 stars otherwise. I am 5'2 148 pounds and teh leggings fit perfectly. I like them alot. Would reccomend for teh price.
B003PPSNPG|5|Perfect beanie. Love that it's available in a variety of colors and for such a great price!  I must note that the &#34;cyan&#34; color is more of a bright neon blue/turquoise rather than the deeper, dark turquoise as it appears on Amazon. I was happy because I was looking for the brighter color.
B00BMZGM18|5|It fit wells and is light weight.  True to size. Tanks are very expensive but I found this tank to be very affordable.!
B00LOGRMQO|5|Love!!
B008UZNV3U|2|I wear a 32D, and I found it fit around my rib cage, but the cups were a bit small.  Unfortunately the nude bra was damaged, the hook side of the back clasp looked like it was cut off so there was no hook.  I gave it to my daughter to play with rather than go through the hassle of returning it.
B003LO1X7G|1|waist is way to high
B0083EZE6U|5|Quality product with faster then expected shipping. I enjoy wearing my shirt and at the same time make a statement.  I will be ordering more in the future.
B00LSXCXA8|5|cute dress!!
B00HD938KA|5|Great quality shorts, fit very nice little big in the waist other than that the're perfect, and the sale price was amazing!!
B007IW8ZEQ|5|the size is good and the design is fit<br /><br />the real product is same as the picture<br /><br />good quality ..
B003LO1ZLK|4|I was impressed with the shirt. It fit a bit big but the length was great and the quality is obviously better than most shirts like it. I'm happy with my purchase and will come back to Carhartt again in the future.
B009YR8IMM|5|I really love my scrubs they are thick,and soft..ever since I have been buy my scrubs from amazon..
B00C45ZIWE|4|I love it! Will buy more.
B00PF70ZL2|4|The order was on time. I love it because it fits very well.
B003IBT702|4|Tried it on and fits true to size with good stitching and material. Bow is ugly though so that went in the trash!
B00JUM4IPW|3|Three stars
B00NTRZG6Y|1|this xxxxxl coat was at best an xl
B00D7WFN5K|5|It's great. Holds everything you need.
B00HSOZSX0|5|Very cute dress. Looks just like the picture. Fits perfectly. I received many compliments when I wore this dress. I'll be wearing it all summer long*
B00BIH8BTG|5|The looks and feels great. I recieve many compliments on the hat. I would recommend this product to anyone. I love the color choice and the Superman logo surrounded by the skulls.
B00CRARED2|1|This suit runs very small as others have stated, however my dissappointment was in the color.  It appears burgundy and arrived hot pink.
B00R0PKN6O|5|NIce
B00AHS6L30|5|I love it! I wear it to work out, and it is so perfect I had to get another one in a different color! It is very comfortable whether it is for casual wear or working out. On my first day wearing it, I got compliments on it, so it is a definite winner for me =).
B00GTPZYM4|4|I like this a bit less than other items I've bought from this line.  The cut would be more flattering on a taller person than me.(I'm 5'4&#34;)  The mocha color is not good for me, kind of light brown w/ light purple and orange hues? Hard to describe, but the picture does show the color pretty accurately. I had hoped the blouse would be a bit different color, so just my bad luck. The fabric is nice quality, has not snagged after several washings.
B00J3ICOMC|5|The scarf is very well made, This design of it is perfect, it stays comfortably  on your head with no pulling or tugging.I wore it out today and it was  sunny and a bit warm , the scarf was cool and comfy probably due to the white cotton lining. My only issue is they don't make it in the colors that I need. No Black ! Really!
B00JJC9QDW|5|Guys.... get her a gown like this. She will LOVE it.... and she won't have it on long!
B005LEUQHC|2|The adjustable feature is not so good. The belt keep moving out and when I get up I will need to push it back to fit the waist.
B00AME2YOO|3|The dress is ok, I did not quite like the finishing on the inside. It looked cheap
B0076R6LX0|1|I am so disappointed in the jacket.  It's CHEAP Quality!  I am spoiled I guess by The North Face line, I will probably be returning this, I expected so much more.  How hard is it to make a quality jacket?  It's a black jacket and looks faded or worn already?
B007KF23AS|4|Great pair of summer socks, a bit big for our 3.5 yr old, but will last the next year with ease.
B00POULEP6|2|Not a very good product.
B003MS0TTY|5|I love this hat, my doughter were it since she was 6 months old. Today I bought the third one - for 24 months.
B00GJ5I9RG|3|When it's wet covers her eyes.
B00A7H78TM|5|It is a good quality product with a good price
B00KIKWRK8|5|Great scarf. More beige in person
B00HK2XSVY|4|This fits me well. The only problem I had was it being form fitting near the top and it looks funny if I tuck in any shirt (which is just a personal preference). If you where it with a crop top or smaller shirt you should be fine though.
B00BCG2L44|5|Lee's Premium Select are the best value jean on market & they fit well too-- no surprises. Only problem is that I've found it harder to find the &#34;  Classic  Fit Straight Leg &#34; cut.  Maybe  Lee is phasing them out.
B00PHH7C48|5|Love it!
B00EK93AVI|3|The size chart is accurate. The dress is a like the picture in shape, not in color, the color is a darker purple. It came with the belt. The product came in perfects conditions.
B00N5PQOMK|5|Great fabric weight, fit and feel!
B003Z6OMKU|5|My wife loves this hat and gets so many compliments on it.
B00K8CV3CY|4|Nice fit and the quality was acceptable.
B00JEMOUJM|4|One size is hard to fit all. I ordered small and the dress is a little bigger than needed. The armholes are big, the bodice big, the skirt bigger ... so the top/bottom balance is a little off.  I'm hoping that after it gets washed, some of the skirt stiffness will subside, and it might shrink a little since it's all cotton, then it will be just perfect. It's not so big that I would return it because it's loose, which is good for hot TX weather, and I will always wear a camisole, so the armholes won't be an issue. Still worth the purchase, and it's so cute on.
B008626JLI|5|When I got it in the mail, my first reaction was disappointment. But when I washed it cashmere solution shampoo that I specifically bought for cashmere, and I loved it! Turn it inside out. I washed it on handwash in cold water on low spin. Then shake it a bit and hang on wide hangers overnight. For $50 it is soft and stylish. After washing it became soft and fluffy as I like it. I already bought 9 sweater and 2 dresses from Sofie Cashmere ( I catch them when they go on sale, usually while holidays) and wear them all year around. Get compliments all the time. People think I spent lots of Monet on my cashmere :) good, durable quality for the money.
B0016GKSA4|4|they are what I needed to work out in, and fit very comfortable as I need, I am happy with them
B00KMMSWE2|5|Price was right
B00394DMJA|2|This bra keeps sliding down, I think it may be too small? I think if the cup size was slightly bigger/covered more of the breast, the darn thing wouldn't keep sliding off my chest. It is not exactly the funnest thing to keep pulling up your bra.
B008D94Q9Q|4|This wallet is fantastic. It is low profile and holds my cards without any trouble. My only complaint is that the money clip is a little tight. It is hard to get bills in and out but it should break in.
B0012KB1VO|2|really thought it had more of a tanga feel to it, however the cut is only slightly higher than that of a full coverage.if that is what you are looking for then keep looking, the detailing is plain , best you spend your money on those with both the satin and lace trim.
B005KXB2CW|5|The bag came within 4 days of ordering. All my sons school binders fit without a problem. The material looks strong. I recommend this vendor everything in the description was on point. Delivery sooner than what was expected.
B0012OFN0A|3|The shirt I received was not X Large; although, it was marked X Large. I did not receive it until after Christmas when I was assured it would be here before.
B0018DPDSW|4|Build quality was good, however straps too large to conceal.
B00F9B5RGC|5|nice tie!
B00NLI5IUA|3|I thought this dress looked super cute in the pictures, but unfortunately it ended up being a little large and usually smalls work really well for me. It also ended up being longer than I would have liked. I am sure this dress would work really well for taller women  but being that I am only 5'2&#34; it seemed to long.
B00DZJ7H36|3|the material for the shirt was poorly chosen It began pilling with the first wash.  looks nasty if you get too close.  I still wear it because it has such stylish design
B00BG6FYKI|1|Quality not as expected, It looks cheap.
B00CFI5V4K|2|I bought this for my six month old daughter...it was too small for her. This wetsuit is also difficult to put on an infant.
B000V0EPZK|5|These scrubs are great. I have been wearing scrubs at work for over 5 years. These are the most affordable I have found. They are a little thin and the pants are long even though I bought an extra small; but overall they are great and I will continue to buy scrubs from them.
B0006JNRFK|5|I purchased this t shirt, it's awesome.  It represents everything the hippie movement stood for.  The tie dye in this shirt is beautiful, I wear it PROUDLY.......<br /><br />I have been a Led Zeppelin fan for over 40 years.  I had a hard time figuring out which t shirt to purchase, my old vintage one, with the old Zeppelin on it had finally turned to shreds.  So this one was the best I found for  me....<br /><br />the fit is great also, so all you old zeppelin fans, go for it...........<br /><br />I am not a kid by the way, the 60's had the best rock ever.  There will never be any music anytime, anyplace, anywhere that could replace the musicians of the 60's.
B00O058ECM|5|I was so excited when I got this in the mail! I am a huge sweater lover, so this was a pleasant suprise. I was a tad nervous about the one size fits all part about it, but was greeted by a great fit! (I am 5&#34;2) The only thing wrong with it is that when it arrives, it smells rather bad, but I'm sure a wash could fix that!
B00GG1JBNO|5|Bought this for my fiance and he always gets compliments on it. It is good quality and has not shrunk or faded at all.
B00G4TVW12|4|I may want to order a bigger size or your regulat underware.
B00EVTIHGK|5|Good quality, nice cotton, didn't shrink!
B00JJCCNLO|5|Love this shirt..excellent price, cool graphics..good purchase.
B005BP7RRS|5|It's absolutely, exactly what I expected!!<br />I just didn't get the color I ordered? lol still very happy!!<br /><br />p.s. I would like to order the brown one, if it is available?
B00C9IDBSY|4|Understated yet the logo is a nice contrast and stands out. Definite recommend.
B00BF2O30A|5|This is the only product I have ordered from G2 that I really liked.  I really like the material, it is very comfortable and cool for summer weather.
B00SPHDI5O|5|i haven't worn it out yet, but i tried it on and tried a few different styles which were very easy to mimic with the pictures on the tag. Super flattering!!!! Sexy, light, modern and appropriate for any age 20's, 30's, 40's...  Oh and midi- length is totally in FYI.<br />For the record, I am normally a size M in U.S. tops. FYI, I'm 5'3&#34;, 127lbs: 35&#34;bust, 30&#34;waist, 38&#34; hips and normally wear a size 6 top, 8 bottom. the M was perfect. I read lot's of reviews on other convertible dresses and many had bad reviews. This one was consistently good and I highly recommend it.  I will order another one in black... classic.
B00O4DXEW0|5|Classy and warm.
B0091XSGIU|5|I was so nervous these would not fit. But I bought the medium like I normally would, and boom! I got a butt again! These pants are just awesome! I plan on buying many more for the future. They're comfortable too!!
B00JZGI6GA|2|the bra cups are made weird and don't stay on the boobs it rides up towards my neck the cami part is loose I normaly wear a med to large in these I should of ordered a small.
B001DDS6AE|4|Definitely fits most teens and young adults
B002IRFV7U|4|We bought this for a Jimmy Buffett concert and it was perfect! Very comfortable and I liked that it was soft like a stuffed animal.
B00FFD76PE|3|I didn't realize the shirt was for Big and Tall men, so it was my fault that the shirt was too big and had to be returned.
B00DPNO9QA|4|Looks like it is in good condition.  I wish it would have come boxed as this is a gift.  I'll have to make do.......
B00DEHJIP4|5|I love it very much though. Just like the one in the picture. I love it and it fits perfectly
B006Z8JEYY|1|Long and weird fitting on 5-4 daughter
B0047N10ZA|5|These are very comfortable pants.  They feel soft to the touch.  But, be careful the comfort waist band makes them feel a little large.  I could have gotten by with a size smaller.
B00ESSCKXU|4|This is so cute and I can't wait to have my son wear it for Halloween.  That being said, my son is crazy small for his age - the costume fits fine, but the headpiece can only be worn as a &#34;hat&#34; because it is too small for his eyes.  I find this strange since my son is sooooo small.  You may want to order a bigger size if you plan on using the top as a mask and not a hat!
B00FPHXF2S|3|didnt wash up so great had to stretch the lace to look proper again still not bad for the price
B003PIRG4C|3|This is a great coat, the color is perfect. The zipper is a little stiff and hard to zip up but I am sure it will loosen with time. It is a little bigger than I had expected for a large but it is not too bad.
B00IVLMZDK|5|Runs a little bit small be careful
B00EUA4SKO|5|I like it
B00BK4NCKA|5|I got this for my Jareth the Goblin King costume and it did not disappoint.
B0074GWXDK|4|These pants are comfortable and true to length. I found them to be a little big through the waist and hips but not so much that I cannot wear them. These are perfect for business casual workplaces.
B00F2ZCQ28|5|These are great! Just the amount of extension to help my bras fit comfortably all day. The price was right, too.
B00L4FQ7DE|4|I like it, not sure how long it will last, printing seems like it will fade easy! A little too long and to tight for the size! Seems like that is consistent with official SW clothing.
B006F4BATU|5|This Mickey Mantle t-shirt is awesome! If you can't find a gift for the man who has everything and he is a Yankee fan then this is the gift to get him!!
B009UV614E|5|This is a great quality winter hat.  It is a gift for my son and I truly believe he will love it.  I ordered a different on from another company that was no wear near the quality of this one.  It came very fast as well.
B00OFFVRY4|5|gorgeous dress!
B007KFZGV6|5|When i first got it, i tried it on fits perfect then i did my work out with it on and felt comfortable, very good support definatly recommended ;)
B00JXEQ6IY|5|Nice shirt, loved the fabric.
B002GHFIKC|4|Bollywood Style Designer Indian Kurti - Unique Indian Kurtis for Women -Summer Dress lucknowi-chikan-- It's the latest in Indian fashion! If you are looking to buy the designer kurtis (tunic) to match with your jeans, trousers or salwars, simply browse this store..............
B0018OFOBM|5|The 550 relaxed fit is very comfortable long wearing and well constructed.<br /><br />Not fashion forward just good quality at a fair price.
B00EVLVLGQ|5|Fit as expected. Arrived as expected. Comfortable product.
B00VJG83RQ|2|I had bought this brand before (in a store) and loved the way they fit and felt. These leggings are shorter than pictured - they barely cover my knees and I am 5'6&#34;. The material is thinner than my original pair, some of the seams are crooked and there were large tufts of thread - one of which was in the crotch area - not a good look. I feel like these are either knock-offs or factory seconds.
B00L8T8PK4|2|Dress looked much nicer online. Fit was at least one whole size too small. I did return dress for a refund.
B00553XOIC|5|As a large chested woman, I have a hard time finding a sports bra that actually works. THIS WORKS!!!! It is comfy and holds everything in place! I highly recommend this!! Fits very true to size - at least for me!
B00CE1V5D4|5|Love the shirt; my son and I would sit and watch this show regularly when he was younger.  It brings back some good memories.  Its made of good material that should last for a while and the graphics/print is bold and bright
B00HFMH7E8|3|really cute
B00NNFNL0U|3|The suit is the style I ordered, but not the fabric I picked.  I chose a print that was different shades of blue, but the one I received is purple and white.  I'm not sending it back, but would have preferred the one I ordered.
B000JWDC04|5|Thank you so much! I am very pleased with how fast I received my order and it's quality! My fiancé is going to love it! Will buy from this seller again! Merry Christmas!
B003ID620S|5|Present for my niece and she loved it.
B003BH2NT0|5|This dress was very well made...heavier Bengaline fabric which makes it the perfect dress to hide imperfections and bring out the curves of your body.  The only thing that could have been better was an eye and hook fastener at the top of the zipper to finish it off.  :)  It's an eye turner for sure!
B004PBJ2UE|5|I had ordered the corset a few weeks before delivering my baby and I was kinda scared I ordered a size to smal. I had used the online measuring guide they offer on the website to help, I was surprised after all the swelling went down I was able to latch it. Within a week I was able to latch it on the smaller side. This was my second child and I can tell my stomach has gotten flatter faster than with my first :).  Another thing I like about it is it doesn't roll down and it's comfortable having to wear all day, and easy and quick to unlatch to use the restroom. I would recommend mothers buy thi. even if this isn't your first child. I'm already needing to go down to a smaller one and I'm 9 weeks post partum.
B00EP3EQI0|3|These ran a bit small.  But for the bargain price, we just gave them to a team mate.  Not worth the hassle to send them back.
B00QYZAE88|3|Arrived when expected. Was a bit smaller than expected glad I ordered next size up. Thank you.
B003EAIPWI|5|GREAT
B007BEILZE|4|Great in every way but it runs a little small...I ordered a size larger than needed hoping he could wear awhile but that may not happen.
B00JEY8DIY|5|Awesome combination... :)
B00TY5GGZ0|3|Cool designs but the just fit a little too tight.
B004O5IBJE|1|Returned
B00MH9HBHC|4|These may work for others.  I'm sure it's up to your preference.  They moved around too much for me so I returned them for the fabric covered ones.
B001ELL6SY|5|This is my favorite style of bra. It always fit properly and it is comfortable.  It is low cut enough in back for the more &#34;skimpy&#34; or deeper cut dresses.  I would like to find it in more colours! I cannot find a better bra on the market for my size.
B002NPCJ6I|3|Was looking for summer tank tops, these did the trick.
B004Y6R5EA|1|This is only going to fit you if you're a size 20 or higher.  The chest is elastic so that part is not a problem, but the skirt part of the dress is enormous, which makes it very unflattering if you're not a plus sized person.  Also, the quality of the cotton fabric is pretty low.  Do not recommend it at all.
B00IOWGBTA|5|Good quality
B000QWDQUS|5|I got my waist cincher, and the first time I put it on, it was a bit hard to get on, sort of like spanx the way it fits. I purchased a large, and it fits exactly as expected, I had a 35 inch waist, and when I measured myself a week later, I now have a 32 inch waist! it takes a couple hours and few wears to get used to, but after a week I noticed that it was becoming so comfortable that I completely forgot I was wearing it. I also found it does help my back and my posture, like other people were mentioning in the reviews. After a week, I got it on the second  hook, and it began to fit really well, and even a bit loose! Overall, its a great product, its not noticeable under most clothing, only very thin tight shirts, but I'm really happy about this product!
B001J6OGUO|5|I love this bodysuit. Years ago I tried a spanx product and it was too hot and too restricting.  This product is wonderful because it smooths you out all over AND allows you to breathe! I'm a size 6-8 but at 45yrs old there are bulges that show when you put on pantyhose, plus general cellulite on my butt too! This bodywrap smooths everything!  I got the brown and am buying the black one tonight!
B00HK50EQI|1|I am 5'4 and 138 pounds, I have slender legs and thighs but these socks are so tight and come to barely over the knee. The band is soo tight that it cuts off my blood supply. They are worthless to me. I would return them but the hassle is not worth the price. Especially since it took its sweet time coming. I guess you get what you pay for.
B00345WOP2|5|I bought the one in black, I love it! I'm buying more colors. It fits perfect to my little girl. she was 5 lb 6.5 oz
B001CCFNG6|5|Fantastic!!
B00N773KN2|4|Nice, big bow!!!
B00CPJDMUE|5|This product is great in color for my skin tone (which is difficult for me to find). It is comfortable and works well.
B00NFDDYWA|5|It's good,Just fits me.
B00997L4QE|5|I bought this dress for my daughter to wear to banquet this year. It looked great on her. She is long bodied and we usually have a hard time fitting her. The package did take a little longer to receive but came wrapped very nice.
B004GXA8UY|3|the lining on the inside of the upper cups is scratchy against sensitive skin
B00FPYQ41K|4|Runs very large but comfortable
B0058O7S1W|5|I bought these for a sexy Mrs.Clause costume and they are really cute!  They are nice and soft!  I am 5'7&#34; and 140lbs and they fit fine.  They slide down a little bit because they are so soft, so I just put a little bit of two-way body tape between the stocking and my leg and it worked perfect! The ribbon colour ran a little bit on the top of the stocking but not enough for me to care.  The shipping was fast too!  Would order again.
B007TOMSAK|5|Good Quality good price. Thanks
B001AJ2R2E|5|This bra is fantastic.  It is very comfortable even after 8 hours.  I bought one to try and now I have 6 in different colors.  Great purchase if you are looking for a light, comfortable and airy bra that stays put and does not bind.
B00KYWIMKO|5|my 8 year old loves this shirt. It has held up nicely after several washes. It fits nicely on my slim girl. Fit is long and slender.
B00GN6CRFQ|5|Very comfortable socks, I will be buying more!  They are breathable yet supportive.
B00FIZYXTQ|1|too small even for asian built (105 lbs). lots of loose thread hanging. one of the sleeves look like there is a hole on it due to loose knitting and the belt holder came off as soon as I opened the package.  will not buy from this brand again.
B00H4WO7YM|3|Not as fitted as I expected.  The collar is slightly too larger as well and I don't particularly like the fabric.
B000UMMN1M|2|too small! used it for 2 weeks now and still cannot store more than 3 credit cards in it....would NOT suggest buying it
B006F52QT2|1|this wallet looks like someone used it for a few years and they put it in a fancy box and re-sold it! i would not recommend this to anyone. while it looks good on the site what you see is not what you get. you get a wallet that looks like it was stuffed in some ones back pocket for a few years. USED! if the merchant is going to sell things in this condition i suggest you use the word \\"distressed\\" because this wallet looks very \\"Distressed\\"
B007SZL8MO|4|There's a big variety in this box.  There are many colors and styles.  Some of the styles are a bit bulky and not too attactive, but there are lots of cute ones as well.  Buying this whole box is definitely cheaper than individual ones.  I'm guessing approximately 60% of them are entirely cloth covered alligator clips.  They will not pinch or pull out hairs.  The remaining are small metal, snap bendy barettes where the tops are cloth covered and the bottoms are exposed metal.  These are probably meant for smaller infants with less hair.  They will stay in place better, but has the potential of pulling out a fews hairs if your little one is agressive in pulling them off without unsnapping it first.  My daughter has a tendency of pulling all head accessories and she hasn't gone bald yet.  So the cloth coverings proved to be good protection.
B00GRDC4BM|5|A simple design, which for some reason almost no one else makes: it orients your cards so they form two separate non-overlapping stacks. Why was it so hard for me to find a wallet like this? I literally looked for years-- even corresponded with the owner of a custom wallet company who told me that I should just carry fewer cards if I wanted my wallet to be thinner. If you've got a big stack of cards, this is the way to go, Bravo, Allett.
B00599WV8G|5|I am pleased with the overall size of this bag for sure. I was almost surprised! I love that it has the back section and the front with extra pockets and the zipper in the front. It seems sturdy and so far it is. Good buy, great price!!
B00KX1VVUO|5|:)
B003X0BPNA|1|This item was described as a Petite size yet it was a regular size and therefore I was disappointed in the fit.
B004S0SDZW|5|Realy nice coat. Great price.<br /><br />If you buy the pants : I wear 30, but need to enlarge it about 2cm (a seamstress will easily). you can also tahe a size up!
B00JIL2ZUU|2|this this is not the same lenght as in the picture i take a small and it fit as a large or medium..its not ankle lenght its way above the ankle
B009A116Z8|5|I'm a huge fan of Mission Belt!  I don't wear anything else since discovering the awesomeness of this belt!
B00UKFFB3Q|2|Even though I love these sun dresses, and have ordered them previously, I did not like this SOLID YELLOW color.  My previous purchase of these ACE Fashion sun dresses were beautiful prints.  They looked beautiful and fit perfectly.  When I returned the two solid color sun dresses, I ordered three more print dresses and I am very happy.  I would recommend the PRINT sun dresses, not the solid color dresses.
B001GE15V2|5|I love this suit. We had the size below and my son wore them every Sunday. They hold up well, look very expensive, and are adorable. I will never buy any other brand of suit!
B00J5H96OA|3|The pants seemed to be well made, and they looked cute & comfortable.<br /><br />I ordered a 2XL, because I have a large bum; I can vary between and XL and XXL, depending on style.<br /><br />These. . . I put them on, but I fit into ONE pant leg--completely, including my 44+&#34; hips (my widest point on my lower body). These are seriously oversized like I have NEVER seen before.<br /><br />I'm returning them, because even at 100% cotton there's no way I could get these to shrink enough. I'm glad I didn't remove the tag. As a Prime member, it's worth returning these.<br /><br />I wouldn't mind ordering them in a smaller size, because like I wrote earlier, they seem to be well made and would be comfy.<br /><br />If you do choose to order, order down (unless I just got a &#34;fluke&#34; pair).
B00STNWQM0|5|Nice quality shirt but it does run small.  I would suggest ordering the next size up.  I usually fit into a medium and a large fit me perfectly.
B00RYAYQOA|5|I love them!!! Best underwear on the market. I only wear performance underwear!!
B000TAADTO|4|Don't waist your money on more expensive over the calf socks.  These socks do the trick, are comfortable, stay up, and last.
B000P50WGC|4|Nice shirts. Will shrink at least one full size if washed in warm water and hot dryer. Good basic undershirts.
B0009U83HS|3|They look good and fit better thanI expected but the pocket openings are too small.
B00MRDPKIA|5|Love this shirt!
B00CWCWYOO|3|fit great, looks great but had a flaw in pocket material (was torn) but easy fix if you have a sewing machine.
B00HS7KQQ6|5|Perfect fit and the material is sooo nice as well! I love wearing this to work and it gives me that sleek and sexy butt-look.
B00DVXYPRM|2|Material wise and craftsman ship very poor. The ribbon isn't properly stitched and the fit for the lower half is not adjustable. In my case, it is quite loose and moves up. Which is really annoying because it takes away from image you want to convey.
B005GYGF5Y|5|I put on some extra weight from my pregnancy and am now trying to work it off, the fit is perfect
B00LFO7NV4|3|Was really excited to receive this dress, but overall it is not what I thought it would be. The pattern matches the picture, and it is not too tight, although it is a little short for my 5'3 frame. Plus, the design of the dress does not match up with my body type. It appears to be of okay quality, but I have not worn it yet.
B00C94IH7S|2|I don't like the coat because it is Large and I ordered Small, I'm unhappy with the product I want to change it.
B00VDSGQUQ|5|Absolutely LOVE! Can't go anywhere without them! They look exactly like the Dior &#34;So Real&#34; glasses.
B00ASVUKO2|4|i got a large size and it was to small on my top and bottom and if i would of known that i wouldnt of bought this!
B00FZ98CA6|4|A perfect jacket to wear inside your coat on extra cold days. The collar covers your throat-can even cover bit of your face if you pull up the collar. It is thick and blue-the internal klein blue. Like the fact like it has provision for threading your earphones through- but dont use it so cant tell whether it is comfortable
B009GN0GB0|5|Nice bra for the money.
B00OK31XVS|1|very cheap material!
B006LAMVSC|3|Very cute item but seems to be rather short for an 18 mo. size
B004WZEVHC|3|I can just tell that if this bra came in my real size 30D it would be the best bra ever.  I ordered the 32C just to see, and the cups are definitley too small and I have to fasten it on the last hook so there's no room to make it tighter as it stretches.  Now it looks like they aren't even offering the 32 band size at all.  I would settle for trying a 32D even.  I love the smooth, low stretch fabric, the design of the side and underbust support and I like that the straps are not too wide-set so that they lift from the top of the cup and not right in front of the arm pit.
B00GGMBASM|5|excelente
B00JAN98GK|5|Just kidding, but seriously, I'm now a lifelong customer.  I am trying to find the best fitting and feeling bamboo products on the Amazon market and these are the underwear I will buy from now on hands down. Perfect fit, feel, texture, weight, size, etc.  If you buy the cheaper brands they will be tight and too thin.  I'm all for a drop in price for these though because I want to buy these for all of my male family members.
B004D69ZRG|2|The shorts do cause you to sweat, I give you that, but I have seen zero reduction in cellulite. I have used the cellulite cream and worn them faithfully for a few months but really they have done nothing. I would not waste your money
B00Y1EF81C|5|PERFECT!  This dress is lovely, fit is just as expected, quality is great.  Soooo pretty and comfortable!
B000N8S18W|4|Very good quality but made a little small.  I would suggest ordering the next size up!
B00HNKX3ZY|5|it is certainly very good product I recommend it 100%
B00JAN97TI|5|I got some of these Vitrix brand boxers several years ago and I loved them. They're very comfortable. After a couple years, I was in need of some more, and I was excited to see them available! But, these are even better! They're extremely soft, extremely comfortable. I plan on buying more in the future.
B00AREJRM6|5|It is a great item....it fits as I expected.... and the colors are great. ...great deal good price, nice item.
B00BEU1S2Y|5|Great quality.  Great price.
B005A3YLNY|5|This jacket is perfect for fall/spring.  The fleece is a good weight.  The sizing runs small.  My son is almost 2 years old and small on the growth charts.  I returned the 2T for a 3T and it fits much better.  A good buy.
B00GA7VWTU|5|Excellent.
B00U2IU4OC|5|Awesome
B005DS9MNK|4|4.5! c: The stitching on this piece was great and sturdy. I would really recommend for a quick playtime at night! The only thing that sucks is that it doesn't have a cotton soft stitching for the lady parts. It isn't good for all day use! But otherwise perfect c:
B000NJY14E|5|My little girl loves it.
B004S9MO4E|5|Teens and pre-teens are now wearing bowties. They look so good! All of the bowties I purchased have been well made and look just like the pictures. They are a really good buy.
B000S0TB02|4|I'm short-waisted, so \\"classic fit\\" jeans and slacks put the waistband way up high, which is uncomfortable and unattractive.  These pants are just a little on the \\"low rise\\" end, so the waistband hits just at my waist.  Even better, it's a comfy waistband, slightly stretch, wide and lined.  The fabric is smooth and falls nicely.  Although the description says \\"straight leg\\" to my eye it looks like the legs flare just a little.  The price is great.  These were \\"on sale\\" at a department store for 50% more.  I take away a star for the fact that the back pockets aren't real.  They have flaps for decorative purposes.  What's with that?
B00LNWALIA|5|I use these for gift cards. Perfect
B0056QS7ZI|1|I made the mistake of having all of my patches sewn on ($70.00 + cost of patches ) before realizing there is no way to wear the jacket with the tapered sleeves!!!! Body is fine!!!<br />Over $200.00 wasted!<br />But; I can look at it hanging in the closet any time I wish to!!!<br />Why in the world would any company manufacture a jacket with the sleeves like this???????????
B0064BL882|1|These are awful. I had high hopes but was disappointed, They are extremely small. They are next to impossible to do by yourself. If you persevere you are rewarded with a noticeable lump and a great degree of discomfort. Then if you move at all they pop out. Maybe they would work better on those little narrow straps.<br />I hate to give a bad review but it is an honest review. A waste of time and money.
B00M94MXXM|4|Very thin coat - will be a early Spring coat if it still fits then.  It is really cute, though.
B00EDEKP9U|5|This mask is very good for any costume involving the Nolan Batman series.  It is made in a way that is easy to get on and off, and it fits well.  My only complaint is that it might need some cushioning under the eyelids to maintain a more defined shape (but not needed) and you will have to add a method of sealing the back flaps of the mask so it is a good fit (industrial velcro did the job nicely).<br /><br />My Reason for Purchasing:<br />I made the mistake of purchasing the \\"Super Deluxe Batman The Dark Knight Costume\\" which came with a mask that could not possible fit any human without an unrealistic amount of cushioning added, and even then you look like a bobblehead in a poorly sculpted mask.  As such, this new batman mask was exactly what I needed.  It was cheap, fits will, and looks much better than the one my expensive costume came with.  Even though it was shipped from China, it arrived in 5 business days which surprised me since it was delivered a month earlier than defined.<br /><br />Is this mask perfect... no, but it is sure close and will be a much better fit than most masks you can purchase on the market (unless you make your own).<br /><br />Updated (Oct 25 2013):<br />Dear Juan Cp, MacJunegrand, and Dbat;<br />I for some reason cannot upload any of my photos.  I am not very good with that type of thing sadly and have admitted defeat after trying to copy and paste the photos, then upload in video review, along with other failed attempts.  I can say the mask looks quite similar to the product photo already presented on the site.  It has the same coloration and structure.  I will however say the chin region (your chin, not the mask) sticks out a little more than the photo suggests, but it still doesn't take away from the look.  Also, I have a larger head (but not huge) and thus this might be why I personally experienced it.  The other thing I noticed which was different is the eyebrow regions when compared to the product photo.  Unfortunately for me, upon wearing it, these eyebrows fold (collapsed) inward and look quite odd.  However, to fix this, I used a rectangular piece of black felt furniture sliders (about $3 at Walmart) and cut and hot glued them into the interior shape of the mask eyebrows.  From there I simply hot glued them into place and now the eyebrows looks just like the product photo. Granted, my head being larger might have caused this issue and others might not have such an issue, but since the mask is not molded specifically around your individual head, gaps might be present (for me only the eyebrows presented like that) from your face where you need mild cushioning. In terms of the felt cushioning, please note, let the hot glue cool slightly if you attempt this method since I could see it burning the latex if you apply it into place too quickly.<br /><br />There was also a slight gap in the nose region which was a good thing in order to breath easily.  I have tried other batman masks prior where you have to mouth breath the entire time which is not comfortable over time.  This product did not present with such an issue for me.  However, I am sure exceptions might occur for some people.<br /><br />I know a photo speaks a thousand words, but sadly, a photo is not possible for me. I hope the added comments helped to define this product.<br /><br />(Update: 07-18-14)<br />After a recent summer \\"cosplay-like\\" costume party with a bunch of my nerdy friends (including my wife and I as nerds too), I have finally noticed a few imperfections occurring in the mask.  The latex is starting to fade into more of a grey (though I could most likely airbrush it again later) when compared to the rest of the costume and the slit in the back is growing with each removal (though I feel the velcro I added is slowing that issue).  In addition, I was trying to again figure out why some people last year stated they were receiving different masks than what I got and I can only figure it is because this mask has a neck piece attached (which after recently watching the movies again I see that is a differing aspect).  However, to be honest, I formed my own neck covering which hid that (since I noticed the attached neck piece left skin showing between it and a cape and chest/back piece).  As such, my costume does now look very similar to the movie costume because of that addition (which was simple another mask cut up and reformed from the overly large deluxe set I discussed in a prior post.  Once again though, I have a large head and this is the only batman mask I every tried that fit well, so if you have an average sized head, this might not fit as well for you.<br /><br />Sadly, once again, I tried to update the post with a photo, but again I failed.  I must be doing something wrong, that our it doesn't like my MAC.<br /><br />I hope this update helps.
B00EY37U2U|5|Perfect fit! I'm 5'8 and its the perfect length. I was scared it would b too short but its not. Its so versatile I'm having a hard time deciding which way I want to wear it. Love this dress!!!
B0046HHS3K|5|We love this tie! I wanted one for my husband too, LOL. My son even figured out how it worked so he was able to losen it or put it on when he needed to.
B001G58H2Q|4|but toy it isn't.  They're just some cool looking earmuffs that do quite a dandy job of keeping your ears warm.    They automatically collapse small enough to fit in my pocket.  I can wear ear buds w/o them being pushed further into my ear by the earmuffs.      Overall, they do what they're supposed to which is keep your ears warm.  if you can find them for less than $20 I'd say might as well get a pair.
B009LYDEVI|5|Super.....love these gloves...
B00FU804LW|1|The long white gloves arrived when promised, packaged in a plastic wrapper with hand-shaped flat white cardboard inserts expanding the hand portion of the glove.  The left glove had a small, noticeable gray grease spot even though these gloves are brand new.  I could not get a new pair of gloves in time for the event so I tried, unsuccessfully, to wash out the spot. These gloves are long but very ordinary, and the presence of the grease spot which cannot be washed out leads me to give these gloves one star.  The manufacturer should examine both packaging and manufacturing practices to see where dark grease comes in contact with the gloves before selling. Final analysis, do not waste your money on these; I wish I hadn't.
B00DUXIUVU|5|Love the color. Fits tight but comfortable.
B00K2F5VAW|5|Check the colors, lots of green and yellow--may want to up your shirt and tie game. Good socks, they'll do.
B00CTUVQ5C|5|Very cute top. It seems to be well constructed with sturdy fabric that will hold up to repeated wear. You may need to replace the lacing ribbons.<br />I went by the sizing they recommend and ordered an xlg even though I can usually fit into medium or large shirts, I could have easily gone up 1 more size for a better fit. I have a straight body type with 36b/ 31/37 measurements and 5'7\\" tall. This corset work better for my small b cup then the other one I bought from them,  Grey Boned lace Up Back Satin Corset top. There isn't a modesty panel in the back so you may want to go up at least 1 more size if you don't want a gap.  Order based on waist measurements!<br />You will have to loosen the corset before putting it on and then tighten it after closing the front.<br /><br />The product arrived in about 2  weeks.
B00WAUWCU4|1|too small
B00BUI6FG4|5|First of all my orders arrived way before the estimated delivery date... within 2-3 business days by standard shipping. I ordered these underwear in the navy and smoke blue. The quality of fabric, craftsmen and comfort rate very high. The fashion contrast colors are fun and the fit is extremely comfortable. I am a size 32 waist and ordered medium. I feel that there is good support and I also like where the waist band and rise falls. I've worn these all day through evening and experienced no riding, stretching or discomfort. Oh, and these underwear wash and dry very well. Highly recommended!
B003G2Z6OE|4|Shipped in time. Quality is good for the amount I paid. In size, som difference between the trouser I bought at store and the one I  received online. Guessing: Cloth may shrink after wash.
B00HJQMZOC|5|I Love it!! it fits prefectly & it looks good too!
B00I1LQXZG|4|Velcro ripped off pocket flap first day of wearing.  Fit great, look good and dry fast!
B00C009WI4|2|I got a few bras delivered at the same time and have not even washed this one because it's by far the most uncomfortable of the bunch. It is on my list of things to return, but since I almost never return things I'm sure it'll just sit on the shelf. Don't let it be one of those things that sit on your shelf - just pass.
B00B8R5A7W|4|I don't like the color ,but ,it very comfort when wearing it
B00R5C0TE8|3|Not my fav
B00IKUIUCC|5|I love this top. I am a size 4-6, usually i get a small, but sometimes has to go up 1-2 sizes depending onthe cut and material. This I ordered a small and fits perfectly and comfortably.  I bout one but went back for 4 more because I liked them so much. I also got lots of compliments from my co-workers. Would highly recommend.
B007KMUEXY|2|Lacks ANY kind of support, the straps are flimsy. It probably should not be made in a D cup.
B00MHDY70M|3|Arms fit a little small. Should have taken 1 size up to suit.
B00DQVTLR8|5|These pants are so comfy and look great!
B00KRX1YKU|3|BECAUSE THIS SHIRT WON'T KEEP YOU WARM. IT'S VERY LIGHTWEIGHT IN A NORMALLY HEAVYWEIGHT FIELD. AND ITS ALREADY WRINKLED AFTER ONE DAY'S LEISURE AROUND THE HOUSE WHILE SITTING AT THE COMPUTER IN HIS RECLINER. TO BE FAIR THE SHIRT WASN'T ADVERTISED AS EITHER  PERMANENT PRESS OR HEAVYWEIGHT. WE KEPT THE  SHIRT.
B007WADJGI|4|Very pretty shirt, soft fabric. Looking forward to wearing when it gets warmer. Will look great with slacks for work or jeans for hanging out. A good buy for the price.
B00LT8KJBC|4|My first order I bought 4 mid calf maxi skirts. I was a little skeptical at first because of how thin the material was. I've worn the brown, red, and grey so far with a longer shirt to cover the back side cuz it shows a little more than it should. It wore well for the most part but towards the end of day I had to keep adjusting. The PINK skirt I had to wear a slip under it cuz it was very shear n also a longer shirt as well.<br />Other words,  I  like the skirts cuz they are confy which is a bonus when you drive for a living!  So I ended up buying 2 more, a blue and a burgundy.<br />I normally wear a large but after reviews I got a xL.
B001G8APTG|2|It has been a year now, the waist is too big, and sloppy, and the length is down to 33, &#34;Waders&#34; they do look nice without ironing, but with the stretchy waist band they always slip-down, unless I  pull my belt way too tight, and the length shrank.  Now it's 2 years, they look worn out, inseam now 32, these were washed with another band of pants purchased at the same time, the other brand looks and fits great. I won't buy Dockers again.
B00PWQWI84|3|The material is actually some kind of stretchy fabric, the size is larger than it should be. I am usually a 12 and this was very loose on me.
B000M9O4EM|5|pair of pants. not fancy but comfortable. i like the light weight as opposed to fleece. about 1/4 the price of nike pants. i would have gotten the version with elastic at the ankles but it seems not to be available in my size and color. comfortable inseam. i use these for pajamas. don't expect a tight fit at the waiste. i have lots of these but in shorts and they are not designed to fit tight even with the draw string..... maybe that's just me. they are cut for loose fit. the navy are dark almost black. all cotton. very breatheable.
B00KVC9K2G|5|I ordered the black and the fabric is very nice, the boning is nice and stiff.<br />I am a size 18 in US women's clothing and I'm thick in the middle and 44D bra- I ordered a 6x according to my waist measurement and it works perfectly. When tightened it gives my bust a very nice cleavage and my waist a nice hourglass. My boyfriend seemed to really enjoy helping me into it and going through the tightening process, and he really REALLY enjoyed the look of it.  The ties are ribbon - they give a bit after it's on for awhile. I've ordered corset string which works better for getting it a bit tighter and holding it snug - I'd recommend doing that as well, just make sure you first measure the ribbon that comes with whatever corset you have so you know how long your string needs to be ordered as.<br />Also - helpful tip that I found along the way... there are different ways to lace a corset. I found that the &#34;tied in the middle&#34; method works best for me, since I'm thick in the middle and prefer the edges to be looser.  There are plenty of free online tutorials and, as a newbie corset girl, I found them helpful.
B003Z9L070|5|Hermoso conjunto!! se lo compre a mi hijo para usarlo el dia de su cumpleaños, el adora Mickey, le encanto!! Tiene 2 años y el talle 4T le quedo muy bien,(doblando un poco los puños) y podra usarlo por mucho tiempo. Muy buena calidad la confeccion.
B00BTGPR02|2|Thought it was going to be of better quality, didn't return because of the hassle! The brim is like a plastic disk<br />Not flexible at all!
B00MS4YD6I|1|So the side have so much extra material that it looks like it has pouches on the sides. The material makes it look more like a night gown then an actual little basic black dress.
B005W0LTO4|2|Bali discontinued one of their bras I use, and I hoped to find another style I could use.  This one got lots of positive reviews, so I had high hopes for it.  I guess it goes to show that bodies are different.  I wear a 34B in my other Bali bras, so I tried a S and XS in their smart sizes.  The small was too large all around, but the fit of the XS was a mess.  The cups felt too small.  They squished me flat, and hurt under the arms.  But when I lifted my arms, the bra rode up, so the band was too large.  Also, it was a bit droopy, and the strap isn't adjustable.  Not the bra for me. Guess I'll have to keep trying to find a bra that works.
B00A76WWTY|5|Great jacket for chilly weather. Quality is superb and i'm shocked at how cheap it is. Satisfied and prob may purchase this same jacket in different colors. buy with confidence.
B002N312ZE|5|I got this item and was a little concerned with the one size fits all part but I am happy to report it fits just fine ðŸ˜Š I am an 18/20 and have no complaints. The fabric is soft not scratchy or itchy and it is nice and poofy. I've seen peticoats in stores that were twice the price of this one and half the poofyness and the fabric was scratchy. This is a great buy and I HIGHLY RECOMMEND picking one up if your in need of some dress volume
B00KCP4R7A|5|Great shirt! Really fast shipping and so much nicer in person!
B00IKZRY60|5|Same great Carter's quality!
B000MX5Y3I|3|Fits smaller then expected. May need to up a cup size.
B00PFCDPU0|2|Really cute as a stylish rain coat but definitely not warm at all and runs too small. It takes a long time to get the hand through the sleeves.
B00VXACN4M|1|Super cute and soft , but after the first wash , it shrunk , now it's a t-shirt and not a nightshirt
B009PA6U78|5|I bought these as a gift for my son.  I was trying to get something that people don't normally buy for themselves.<br />They are really nice, thick are standing up well after a month of washing (no drying)  They seem to get softer all the time.<br />I may buy a pair for myself :)
B003ZFTAKI|3|These shorts are really cute and nice, but I am usually a size small/medium. Because of the reviews, I ordered a large just to be safe. They are STILL small. If you want these shorts I recommend ordering at least a size or maybe even 2 sizes bigger than what you actually are
B00HUC2S9M|5|Looked exactly how we hoped.
B004SM6ED8|1|I bought a few of your products last year.. I like it very much. But the quality of your wallet is very bad, in fact, less than a year has been damaged seriously. Has seriously cracked.
B000147652|4|Go off of the measurements and not the dress size. I went off the dress size and it was a bit small but still gave me a nice shape. For the price its a good buy and its hides very well under clothing. I would buy it again, just in a bigger size
B00Y5BLXRE|5|The detail of this blouse is lovely.  The scarf is a nice addition and doesn't burden my little one when wearing it.  The scarf is optional and the blouse can stand on its own as well.
B00KMC3QWA|4|Fits my 2T a bit tightly, and he's average size. I really can't see him wearing them as a 3T.
B00MIEL4TM|3|Snug in the shoulders, and my husband is not muscular
B0097YF5K0|5|This is the most flattering top I've ever bought online.  The sleeves are long enough and cute enough to wear all the way down to my wrists or ruched up.  The pleats on the front are subtle and cause a flattering shape.  The color is true to the picture, and is a great maroon.  The fabric is lightweight and flows nicely.  Excellent purchase!
B006TWHT98|5|Loved this! They were nice and warm.
B003CIYOHW|5|a lovely costume. the wig is not included. I got so many compliments.  The XL is a bit roomy and would probably fit size 16 to 18 (which was perfect for my daughter).  I received it quickly too!
B00KD5BV5U|4|Even though this little girl was a good size the gowns were kind of large. She will grow into them
B005E1KR2Q|5|Especially like the finish on the chain--not as bright as typical chains. The wallet is nice, too. You will not be disappointed.
B00PFOVP6Y|5|Thanks! my girlfriend she love it.
B005IZTT8Q|4|I live in black a-line tank tops all summer. My &#34;uniform is a pair of light weight yoga pants paired with the tank top. This top fits the bill. I prefer cotton, but this rayon top will keep it's shape and size. I washed it in cold water and hung it up and it was dry in about 15 minutes and did not lose it's shape or length. Can't beat the price and the delivery was lightening fast.
B00KUA75AS|5|Beautiful print, lightweight and comfy. My man thinks it's very sexy too! Good deal for the price.
B00H1ZTOIQ|4|I'm size 6 and the 8 of this style fits me perfect , I'm so happy with the purchase . I will be ordering a few more  . Perfect length , fits my body I'm so happy .
B00DV89XBA|5|Love the shirt fits great got it fast before daughters birthday she loves Pierce The Vail fits her really well
B003ZJH74K|4|I suppose they changed the fabric across the board, because I bought another pair at the department store not long after these arrived and they were thinner fabric as well.  Disappointing, but still a great fit.
B00OK3TRNO|5|After reading the reviews i thought this would have been too small. I got the extra small as i am a perfect xsmall. It fit perfectly, not too tight and definitely not loose. It his my ankles would want them longer, but I have long legs. I'm 5'6&#34; and 116lbs, definitely gonna order more. All colours.
B00CLFL5QK|5|I use it as a daily underwear and it is comfortable and sexy highly recommended
B00IIMGE84|4|Not crazy about the color but I love the way it feels so I'm going to wear it anyway.
B000A2KCNS|2|had to return and ordered shorter length<br />they looked great<br />can't wait for the correct size to arrive
B00IBNABKW|4|i wish this t-shirt is made in soft cotton like the shirts that you buy at old navy but is isnt
B007LNC0PC|5|I'm a 12D and have no problem with these socks. A quality item that I'm sure will hold up the Carhartt tradition.
B005CSNVZG|4|Nice pants, I like that they are short because I have petite legs. Be careful in the wash though, the material will pill up.
B0010Z3G8C|4|Again I ordered more items from the pepsi stuff promotion. This tshirt is nice. I love the faded logo from the 70's. It is a nicely cut mens tshirt. It actually seems to run a little big. I ordered xl and it is bigger than other shirts my hubby has, but it may shrink in the wash since it is 100% cotton. The material is thinner than what I think a men's tshirt should be, but again I think that this is the style now. I would definatly order this tshirt or the other pepsi stuff men's tshirts for gifts.
B00V8RPZS6|5|Fits great, I love it!
B0015C5PN4|5|I've always had trouble finding bras that fit my cleavage that is proportionally small compared to my larger body. I discovered this bra several years ago and it has been a tried-and-true solution. Nothing fit as well as this &#34;A&#34; cup. Even after losing 110 lbs and no longer &#34;plus size&#34;, this bra is still the one that has fit best.
B00EM6MTL6|5|Bought this for my husband, he loves it.  I chose the Coco and its beautiful, soft, cards move in and out of the pockets with no problem.  The quality is very good and is comfortable in his hip pocket.  Has room for a dozen pictures.  We are very satisfied with the purchase.  Arrived in two days with Prime as promised.
B00CJ55TW8|5|I love this alfit it is the cutest alfit!! A must to have
B00740W3ZE|3|Unfortunately, not for me.  It has a funky &#34;knot&#34; - the description called it an &#34;obi&#34; sash.  Either way, it just didn't look right and did not do anything for the &#34;girls&#34;. Maybe someone with a &#34;Twiggy&#34; frame.  And if you're too young to know who Twiggy is, think about someone with a shape like MaryKate or Ashley Olsen.
B00MNU5C58|5|This is a great suit!  I ordered the XS and it fits perfectly (32B, 107lb, 5'2).  The only thing that could be slightly improved is the sides poke out just a tiny bit when tied in the back but it's not a big deal.
B00J580I8C|3|Sheer (almost gossamer thin) / lightweight / bright colors as depicted.  The fabric is soft to the touch but very insubstantial.
B000JZNY2M|3|Bought two pairs in February.  Wore them alternately one hour every other day as I did an exercise routine.      The inside seams opened up and as anyone knows if you try to repair this kind of fabric on the inner leg seam, it is not effective.    Washed them on gentle cycle, inside out as they are black, and line dried.    Expected more.
B0024LAZHQ|4|It is somewhat large; however, I am enjoying it thoroughly.  Love the weight and cozy cotton feel.
B008RN2GNQ|3|This top was described as Burgundy, however, the actual color is more of a hot pink - does not look anything like the picture on-line. Quality and fit were good however.
B00AAWVQY2|5|As described.  Well made, nice material.
B00K3W7LQ6|5|Great product. I will say it IS bulky. To the reviews saying it is not, that may be compared to another bulkier wallet but compared to your average wallet from a department store it is. However the flip portion adds a bit that my old one did not have, it has a second currency pouch, and I have only been sitting on it for 2 days now so I'm sure it needs time to compress to my butt. It is a nice wallet and you could smell the leather when it came out of its convenient gift box. Like most, can't test the RFID but even the wallet is quite nice as is. Great product
B00DW1V5RQ|4|Shirt was delivered fast, fit as expected and is a cool different style shirt.
B000H8IWOG|3|My kids love Harry Potter!  The wand is a lot of fun and they play with it.  It does not have an on/off switch.  Even if no one is touching the wand, it makes noise if someone walks by it.  The only way to stop it is to remove the batteries; however, the battery cover is only removed by unscrewing a tiny screw.
B001UE74EA|5|A gift for my husband. I bought this a year ago. He still has it looking new. He's rough on wallets, this one can take his punishment.
B0014ZJPU6|5|Same classic look and top quality after many years. Love it when good things stay good. I'll probably be buried in this hat
B0084NNHXW|5|I ordered this dress in a M ( I am 5'10 - 140 pounds) and it was HUGE on me. I returned it and got the S and it fits much better!
B00761791O|5|Belt end to end is 34 inches. The front faux leather section with decoration clipped together is just shy of 10 inches. Widest part is almost 3 3/8 inches. The elastic waistband is  2 3/8 inches. So it's def a statement belt.<br /><br />PERFECT!!! And the sizing is correct with plenty of extra stretch. Haven't worn this out & about yet but I do like this wide stretch belt. Instantly transformed an oversized red & black flannel shirt to an outfit of high fashion LOL. This will go with tons of stuff!<br /><br />Super fast shipping as well. Will def be ordering in other styles.
B002XFHDEQ|3|It's a little weird in that it can be a bikini or a panty.  Either way it fit just fine, shows off your rear and ties on without issues.  Not sure if I would wear it in public as a bikini but would in private.  Again, not completely sure which direction to go with this, I wear as a panty more then a bikini.  The item is lined like a bikini, it does not have your typical cotton lined crotch but thin enough to be a panty.  Anyways, buyer just be aware that it can go either way.
B00XK7234Q|2|I just could not talk myself into keeping these even though the price was reasonable... they looked weird on me, especially unflattering on the butt, & showing panty-line. Much cuter on the model in the pic.  But I got to return them for free, so it was worth a try.
B00I8RXEFU|1|WAY SMALL! Very disappointed that I can't get any consistency in Andrew Christian products. My first pairs are perfect. But they don't make them anymore. These are tiny! Pouch and overall construction are in no way big enough. And there is virtually no stretch to them.
B008SDBOX8|5|Excellent quality.  Beautiful jersey.
B000FBZGXU|1|Have bought many caps cheaper which fit better this is way too short doesnt even reach the tips of my ears
B004WKVUC6|5|Got the wrong size at first, but finally got my replacement.  For the price, this is considered decent movie quality fangs.  If I ever planned to make a scary vamp movie, I would come back here and order a ton of these for the entire cast.
B000TAADTO|4|these are standard whit sweat socks, the claim of thick cushioning is a little exaggerated,  But, they do go over the calf, and after 5 washings they still stay up with no sagging.  Wigwam makes quality socks, if you're looking for a sock to wear with western boots these are a good choice.
B00QYBMEIU|5|This bathing suit was great! Very comfortable, I went with a large because that is what I am going to be this summer!
B00MZCMYR8|1|Stitching unravels after one wash.  Holes in waistband after one wash.  Trash!
B00EUL8X2W|2|Very sheer and because of the shape makes me look like I have a pouch... very/very long... I would keep it if it was only $15... but there are more flattering things for less money. I image unless your upper torso is short and you have a bigger bust - I don't think this would be a good fit...
B00KWMHG44|5|Got this on sale and very excited about this purchase. Came from overseas in 2 days! A must buy especially the sale price.
B00BNZSH6U|4|I have a tweed driver cap already that has brown tones, and bought this one in black, to use when black is a better match than brown with my outfit for the day.  It is comfortable and the size is between 7 and 7.25 inches, which is for a normal head size (normal to me anyway). I like that it is vented on top - the material has small holes and it is a little bit see-through. It is good for the warmer months.  I am hair-challenged (aka balding) so like wearing a cap that can also add a little style to my look. It really does create a younger appearance as well. It shipped to me very quickly also, without any damage. I am happy with this purchase and will probably buy another one in a different color.
B003LR6NS2|5|If you are going to buy a set make sure to buy a weeks worth. Classy all around and very earth friendly
B003UT0X5U|5|The cloak is very comfortable I got the right size for myself.The material that the cloak is made out of is great,very smooth exactly what the description shows when you are reading it.
B00SCF546A|5|Perfect! My GF love it!
B008CGQQWA|1|Lots of fleece falls and ruins my bed my carpet and everything! So so disappointed! Miss the return date. Never wear it again!
B009FSVS8G|5|This dress is nice quality for the money. The fabric is on the firm side, but it's not scratchy or rough and it hangs nicely. Be aware that the sash at the waist is simply a satin ribbon that you could purchase at any store, it's not a fabric one. However, this means that you can easily remove and swap ribbons of other colors if you wish.<br /><br />The only CON I have is that their sizing does indeed run small, probably because this is made in and shipped directly from China. My completely average-sized 6 1/2 year-old fits in this dress. I cannot imagine an average size 9 year-old fitting in this at all. Also, the opening under the armpits is quite gappy, probably because my daughter does not normally wear a size 9/10 in anything. Based on other reviewers, I ordered this bigger size and am very glad I did so. A simple tuck stitched by hand under each arm opening will solve the gap problem.<br /><br />Overall I am pleased with this purchase and would recommend this dress.
B00GJMSQ40|2|The fabric & colors on this dress are very pretty but the whole package just doesn't work; looks more like a maternity dress than something an actual person would want to wear.
B00801Y0Q6|5|This are great pants. They are reasonably priced and hold up to the rough tumbling of my boys. I highly recommend these pants.
B00JPWNN6W|5|These are great jeans! Great fit, perfect low-rise that's so hard to find! Wish they offered more low-rise jeans, I'd buy them all!
B00MGYSAPK|5|Excellent boonie hat.

B00HUM769E|5|Best running bra for large breasted women, I have tried them all!<br />True to size, fits great & comfortable!<br />I have paid twice as much money for not near the product!
B00DUSXXFI|3|I ordered these leggings as an item to wear out with a cute top. But when I got them they were baggy and too fuzzy. They are however super comfortable, I wear them to bed :)) I reccomend getting these as pj pants.
