B000002UA0|5.0|I've always been a fan of Pink Floyd ever since I was probably 12. I loved hearing all the later stuff, but, of course, as time went on, and Pink Floyd hasn't seemed to (come on guys! It's been 6 years since the last album!), i've gone on to bigger and well, um....crazier things. I just bought this CD, the debut by the Pink Floyd, and I must say that I do like it! I'd heard a bit of this stuff on an old copy of &quot;Relics&quot; so i'm fairly familiar with the material, but this is the ultimate experience of Pink Floyd........if Syd Barrett didn't fall from grace, that is.    It was 1967, and psychadelic music was the mainstay of rock in the underground scene. In London, the Pink Floyd were the biggest of the pyschadelic bands, and of course it only made sense that they made a record. With the blessings of such people as the Beatles themselves (!), this turned out to be the definite album of 1967. First of all, i'll have to say that if you're looking for something along the lines of &quot;Dark Side of the Moon&quot;, your'e looking in the wrong place. This is broad, imaginative, drug-induced, hazy, transcendental music, actually more of an atmospheric experience than their later work. This is all due to the bands original guitarist, the oft-overlooked Syd Barrett. He is credited for writing all but one or two of the tracks here, and the music has his signature all over it.     The album starts out with a sort of space theme, which a lot of people would have been interested in at the time. &quot;Astronomy Domine&quot; is a bit of craziness blended in with blurry sound effects. The album takes on a theme similar to that throughout, yet it is also experimental, as well. My personal favorite is &quot;Interstellar Overdrive&quot;, a 10 minute suite of madness. It has no singing, no guitar solos, just pure noise, pure sound, and it works rather good (I love the stereo panning at the end!). The album also has a few imaginary tunes laced with fantasy themes, such as &quot;The Gnome&quot;. It is closed by &quot;Bike&quot;, a song i've been familiar with for a while, and it's every bit as insane as it was when I first heard it, especially with the crazy toy sounds at the end (a sign of Syd's soon to be nervous breakdown?). I  do love the music though, and I wish that Syd was still making music. Unfortunately, he was outsed by the band, Dave Gilmour replaced him, and the rest is history. It's obvious that the guys were guilty over the years, as evident by &quot;Shine on You Crazy Diamond&quot; and even the character from &quot;The Wall&quot; is reminescent of Syd.    Pick this up if you like the pyschadelic sound of the 60's, if you like experimental textured music, and if you want to hear what Syd Barrett is all about. Let's hope that he makes a big comeback some day!
B0000509C4|4.0|This is a great collection of short stories. Chief wooden head being my favourite! It is definately worth buying.
0811826848|3.0|Yes, yes, yes: they were the greatest pop band of all time.  But does that really mean we have to be constantly reminded of the fact?  Please say that we dont.  <br />Anyone of you under 30 (who have had enough of ageing hippies telling us that todays music is 'rubbish') should save their $ and discover something truly exciting.  New Music!  If the fab four taught us anything, it was to always search for something new.  So go out and buy some Beck/Chemical Brothers/Mogwai/Michael Nyman/whatever: just dont buy the feel-good-cash-in-revisionist-history-overpriced book that will follow in its footprints in about, oh, 30 years time.<br />Great music mind.
B002GTZSZU|5.0|AUTHOR'S NOTE: This review was completely re-written and re-published on December 19, 2014)<br /><br />\\"Amadeus\\" has absolutely everything that a great movie should: fabulous acting, a fascinating plot, the best music ever composed, Peter Schaffer's Academy Award winning screenplay, and spectacular, Academy Award winning sets and costumes. \\"Amadeus\\" an adaptation of Peter Schaffer's smash Broadway play of the same name. Based loosely on the life of the world's greatest composer, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, \\"Amadeus\\" is in every way one of the great cinematic masterpieces ever created.<br /><br />The film's story begins in the aftermath of the attempted suicide of Antonio Salieri, a late eighteenth century composer who was wildly popular in his day, but who is now consigned to the dustbin of obscurity. In the film, Salieri (played by F. Murray Abraham), is tortured by guilt over the premature death of his arch-rival Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. He's confined to a Viennese mental institution, where he's visited by a Catholic priest who offers to hear his confession.<br /><br />Salieri's \\"confession\\" is a reminiscence of his experiences with Mozart thirty years earlier, just as the musical prodigy burst upon the Viennese musical scene as a composer in his own right. Mozart (played by Tom Hulce) is brought to the court of Austrian Emperor Joseph II (Jeffrey Jones), and is offered a commission to compose a new opera. At the time of Mozart's arrival, Salieri is the Emperor's court composer. Mozart's almost supernatural musical talents become immediately evident to Salieri and the musical coterie surrounding the emperor. Seeing their entrenched interests jeopardized, Salieri and his colleagues attempt to thwart Mozart at every turn, but the young genius' talents are so prodigious that he succeeds in spite of all efforts to impede him. Salieri recognizes Mozart's gifts as divine, and is driven to a pathological envy of the younger man. He begins to plot Mozart's death as a means of getting revenge against God for \\"making this obscene boy His instrument on earth,\\" while depriving Salieri of the same gift.<br /><br />Did Antonio Salieri murder Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart? You'll have to watch \\"Amadeus\\" to find out!<br /><br />Artistically and technically, \\"Amadeus\\" is a veritable feast for the eyes and ears. The acting is simply brilliant throughout! Most notable are the performances of  F. Murray Abraham, Tom Hulce, Jeffrey Jones, Elizabeth Berridge (as Constanze Mozart), and Ray Dotrice (as Leopold Mozart).<br /><br />But the true star of this magnificent film - never seen, but constantly heard - is Mozart's music, always the music. From the movie's dramatically dissonant opening chords, taken from Symphony No. 25,K. 183, to the deeply ethereal third movement of Serenade For Winds (Gran Partita), K. 361; from the gorgeously conciliatory Ah Tutti Contenti from Act IV of The Marriage Of Figaro, to the darkly tense and nightmarish \\"Commendatore\\" scene from Act II of Don Giovanni; from the grandeur and deep spirituality of Rex Tremendae, Confutatis, and Lacrimosa, (parts of Requiem, K. 626), to the peacefully idyllic second movement of Piano Concerto No. 20, K.466, which closes the film - Mozart's music, masterfully played by the Academy of St. Martin-In-The-Fields (under the direction of Sir Neville Marriner), provides an indescribably delightful and sumptuous festival for the ears.<br /><br />A word or two must be said at this point about the movie's plot. \\"Amadeus\\" is not intended as a cinematic biography of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. In fact, great historical license is deliberately taken in this film. The entire premise of \\"Amadeus\\" - that Antonio Salieri plotted and carried out Mozart's murder - been in existence almost since the day Mozart died. Most modern-day musicologists and historians dismiss claims of Salieri's complicity in Mozart's death as pure speculation.<br /><br />Because \\"Amadeus\\" is based upon a great \\"what if...?\\" rather than simple adherence to historical facts, it's all the more more fun and interesting to watch. Most written accounts of Mozart's tragically abbreviated life make for fascinating reading, but very few, I suspect, would translate successfully onto the silver screen. The hint of an actual eighteenth century \\"conspiracy theory,\\" as romantic an embellishment as it may be, adds immeasurably to the film's already considerable entertainment value.<br /><br />\\"Amadeus: The Director's Cut\\" (2002)<br /><br />In 2002, Warner Brothers, director Milos Foreman, and the Saul Zaentz Company released \\"Amadeus: The Director's Cut\\" on DVD. From its release, this highly anticipated version has been controversial. Some people view the Director's Cut as distinctly inferior to the theatrical release, while others believe the added 22 minutes of footage clarify the overall storyline and make an already nearly \\"perfect\\" film even better. I must confess my preference for the Director's Cut.<br /><br />The biggest enhancements to \\"Amadeus: The Director's Cut\\" are the technical improvements to the Blu-ray version. The earliest release of the film's theatrical version on DVD was on a \\"flipper disc,\\" that contained fuzzy images, washed-out color, and lifeless audio tracks. The Director's Cut DVD release was a distinct improvement; it was single-sided, double-layered, and digitally remastered. Today's Blu-ray edition of \\"Amadeus\\" is even better, with richer and more vibrant colors, crisper images, and a totally immersive Dolby TrueHD 5.1 lossless audio track.<br /><br />\\"Amadeus\\": The Director's Cut is a brilliant and well-deserved restoration that will in no way disappoint fans of this marvelous film, already a modern classic.mple adherence to historical facts, it's all the more more fun and interesting to watch.

B00004XONN|5.0|As you've probably read before, you will probably not connect to this album immediately. Radiohead are geniuses of rock, and everything they do is great, but this album is a test to see if you can connect to it. They have cut off every single conventional aspect of music on this album. In almost every song, there is no connection to any kind of a regular form. But it is alien to the point where you can't listen to it. <br />This is a very psychological record, and it jumps around. One track is almost entirely just Thom Yorke and a synthesizer. Another song's lyrics are almost incomprehendable, because they are strained through a computer. Then there is a record that has a biting fuzz bass line combined with what sounds like a New Orleans brass band on a hellishly nightmarish acid trip. And those are just the first 3 tracks. Rock guitar and vocal work is scarce here, but this is some of Thom's best singing. &quot;How To Disappear Completely&quot; is so haunting, with Thom's voice underscored by his acoustic guitar and a keyboard.<br />Check the liner notes too, there is some trippy artwork in there. Also, check beneath the hard plastic c.d. tray, there is a booklet with snippets of dialogue taken out of conext. The words range from odd to disturbing, or both.
B000001F26|4.0|The reason I chose to buy this album once [again] while already owning 1995's &quot;Cream Of Clapton&quot;, which includes classic Cream material from the '60's, then his solo hits up to 1981, and 1999's &quot;Clapton Chronicles-Best Of&quot;-his recent material from the '80's to '90's, is that I was extremely disapointed to learn that &quot;The Cream Of&quot; left off one my favorite Clapton classics &quot;Lay Down Sally&quot;, as well as his version of &quot;Swing Low Sweet Chariot&quot;, and something else I had never heard of before which I don't like as much, &quot;Willie And The Hand Jive&quot;. The other 8 songs are included on &quot;Cream&quot;, so it's really just the former two that I like being the reason this collection is a must. That said, I own this CD again, and I like it for the two that &quot;Cream&quot; doesn't have, but after looking over &quot;Time Pieces 2-Live In The '70's&quot;, I've decided to skip that one. Nobody's written about it yet, anyway. So there it is. Now I shall proceed to write my reviews of the other two compilations, coming soon to a webpage near you!
6305265488|5.0|Living at college, I can tell you that this is the all-time favorite movie of the residence hall! The plot is so sweet, and all of the characters are incredible! Drew Barrymore is perfect as Cinderella and Dougary Scott makes a fine prince. All of the actors threw themselves into the roles, all of the emotions are totally believable.<br />The sets and the music are incredible too. Everyone keeps borrowing my CD! This is the perfect feel-good movie, exactly what you want to watch for good characters and a fantastic plotline.
1572522089|5.0|If you have yet to see Akira Kurosawa's Ran, then go buy it.  Now.<br />This is, in the opinion of many, the finest movie ever made.  It is easy to see why so many hold this view, as it combines great writing (It's based on Shakespeare's King Lear afterall), incredibly cinematography (the reason it is ONLY availible in widescreen in that Kurosawa is one of the only directors who knew how to use the letterbox format), and great action.<br />At the time of it's filming it was the most expensive Japanese movie ever made, and it shows.  The costumes were given great attention, as were the spectacular battle scenes, all involving thousands of fully costumed extras.  The battle scene in which no sound effects were used creates an incredible amount of tension and shows the collapsing mind of King Hidetora literally.<br />All in all this is one of the best movies ever.  Buy it NOW!
0553106635|5.0|I have earlier been hesitant to give Martin the full five stars, but I have to give in and admitt that he is the best fantasy writer right now. Eriksson (&quot;Gardens of the Moon&quot;, &quot;Deadhouse Gates&quot;) needs to polish his style and Jordan (Wheel of Time series) to rediscover his form to get this good. Elliot (Crown of Stars series) is another snapping at Martins heels, but for now Martin is the best.<br />The pace that I felt slowed somewhat in the last book now picks up again. Focus is shifted towards new caracters and many of the plots that begun in the last book are actually concluded. This makes for a very interseting read (I bought it and read it the same day). Without saying to much of the plot the magic ingrediant becomes a  more important part of the plot. Another change from the earlier books is that this one is more brutal, showing some of the not so nice sides of war.<br />I think that anybody that has made it through the first two books  will need nobody telling them to continue (the series is that good). All in all this is the fantasy series to follow right now, the only bad side I can think of is that it will now be at least a year untill we find out what happens.
B000002KYB|5.0|You must listen to Dire Straits if you love music. The group is  unique. Many of the songs are so transporting. The guy reviewing down below me knows more , technically, about music than I do, but listen to me:  YOU WILL LIKE THIS.  HE SAYS SO, TOO.  TRUST US.<br />I chose this particular album to write a review of over the other Dire Straits' albums because it had such a powerful hold on me in the eighties for such a long time. At night, I would put it on my RECORD PLAYER (YES, record player) and I would play along on my Steinway upright with a couple of candles burning and I wouldn't need anything.  Not even a working knowledge of how to play the piano (a little could have helped but I didn't care). You can flow with them, seriously.<br />There is a darkness and sensual quality to this album that I particularly respond to, as a woman. Dire Straits has that depth and a certain quality of seductiveness on many of their albums, on many of their songs...so get ready for that...it isn't all &quot;Money for Nothing&quot; you know. A lot of it is pounding, some of it is raw, some of it is poignant.<br />I would recommend any of their albums, but this is definitely one of my favorites. Always happy to hear this album, any time, any day.<br />best,  jean
B00001U03Q|4.0|I'm not quite sure if that highly significant title still applies to Mr. Clapton in modern times. However, long before I was even born, I'm sure that those London Underground wall scrawlings were right on the mark, what with the excellent rock material formerly released, mostly included on both &quot;Time Pieces&quot; and &quot;The Cream Of&quot; albums. As for this compilation from last year on Reprise Records, it includes a good number of movie soundtrack contributions, which isn't really that much or a problem for me, but for the former hardcore Clapton diciples that much rather prefer his earlier harder songs, this collection is not for them. As for me, I like the sound of: &quot;Change The World&quot; (sometimes), &quot;My Father's Eyes&quot;, &quot;Tears In Heaven&quot; (only a little bit, really), the unplugged version of Derek and the Domino's &quot;Layla&quot; (For some reason, I like both versions equally), &quot;Pretending&quot;, then there's my absolute favorite from this CD &quot;Bad Love&quot;, with Phil Collins on drums, &quot;It's In The Way That You Use It&quot;, my second favorite &quot;Forever Man&quot;, and then one of the new ones for this collection &quot;(I) Get Lost&quot;, which has a very uncharacteristically different upbeat dance sound, and let me tell you, I'm sure not used to hearing a dance song from a rock and blues legend. But hey, I'm not really complaining. So now, for the casual Clapton fan such as myself, this and the other two compilation CD's are great for my music collection. Get it for yourself soon!
B000002UD1|4.0|You know, I just got my hands on a copy of this CD, and it sounds great.I forgot how much I loved and listened to this album (an old friend has returned). There really is a lot of great stuff on here. I'll be tearing apart the songs to teach my students how to put songs together. The vocals are absolutely phemonmenal on this album. The balance between rockers, ballads and mid-tempo songs is terrific. &quot;I Know&quot; and &quot;Aisumasen&quot; are just beautiful songs, &quot;Tight A$&quot; is a really really good bluesy rocker,Meat City rocks with reckless abandon, and last but not least, there's the title track! This album never ever got it's just due which is a shame. Capitol should have a re-release party for this baby!!!!!(Why Not!)
6305878323|5.0|The five stars speak for themselves, I can hardly add to the other justified praise MP has received.  But the Disney DVD Gold Collection version seems to have a sound glitch.  When playing in Dolby Digital mode on my new Onkyo TX-DS575 receiver there is no LFE (subwoofer) sound.  The supposed 5.1 channels are only 5.0 channels.  I need to play it in Dolby Pro Logic mode to get full range sound including the subwoofer.  I have encountered this problem also on some other older remastered DVD releases, e.g. Goldfinger.  The problem is not in my system since newer movies on DVD such as Matrix and Top Gun run fine.  'Tis a puzzlement.
B00003CXBK|5.0|This movie is definitely one of the best anime movies I have ever seen.  It has amazing visuals including stylistic, lush backgrounds and well drawn characters and animals.  The plot is interesting and exciting while still managing to have an underlying theme about the preservation of nature.  I highly recommend this movie to fans of anime.
0140441166|5.0|Dangerous Liaisons touches on an essential part of everyone's life, love. A tale that has no time, the story unfolds among a blanket of love, lies, and deceit, revolving around the lust and cruelty in two hearts that finally ends with dire consequences.
B0000033P2|5.0|This album has a special quality, something related to mood. While the change from \\"Tocatta\\" to \\"Still.... You Turn Me On\\" on \\"Brain Salad Surgery\\" makes an interesting jumping effect of contrast, as between \\"Knife Edge\\" and \\"The Three Fates\\" in the first ELP album, on \\"Trilogy\\" there are, even in the contrasting songs, an enigmatic smoothness among them. The piano introduction of \\"Endless Enigma\\" prepares the \\"Fugue\\", as this one makes \\"From the beginning\\" peaceful personality to impose itself all right after \\"Endless II\\". Emerson used to change his Hammond sound each record a bit. In \\"Trilogy\\" he had somehow the most proper and universal hammond ELP sound, the glissandi shaking than ever. Related in someways with \\"A Time and a Place\\" from \\"Tarkus\\", \\"Living Sin\\" has heavy sound, in a sincere violent rock'n roll song, with Lake's versatility. Indeed, highest and lowest vocal lines are in this record, the most rock'n roll sharped appearence of Lake in ELP.<br />\\"The Endless Enigma (part one)/Fugue/The Endless Enigma (part two)\\" is the best ELP synopsis, with trumpet synth sounds at the end that are incomparable, together with hammond and tubular bells producing a heavenly effect - the finest orchestrating effect found in the band's early records. I would say that Emerson's notion of sonority balance was at its peak, in no point of \\"Trilogy\\" you aren't able to hear a musical line because of excessive distortions or noise, and besides that, the album is full of belligerent sounds. \\"Trilogy\\" track has very effective synth effects, Palmer gives it a monstruous weight, as Lake thicks his voice after the middle of the song. Abbadon's Bolero is an interesting exercise after Ravel and Wendy Carlos (the orchestral version of the 77 tour was an impressive introducion). \\"The Sheriff\\" has something of \\"Jeremy Bender\\", rocky and a style apart from ELP's real personality. \\"Hoedown\\" makes clear again ELP' skilful arrangements. Marvelous.
B00003CXE7|5.0|This movie is simply awesome.  And, it has not come a minute too soon.  The ancient world is FULL of possiblities for stories like this (note, this is historical FICTION, not telling an actual event.)  Great direction, sets, plot, dialogue, and acting.  Oh, there is no &quot;drag in some spots&quot; that some reviewers have commented on.  I guess in this generation no one is allowed to TALK for more than 20 seconds without it being deemed &quot;wordy.&quot;  Also, I noticed two errors in otherwise good reviews below:  1) Commodus did not &quot;listen to his father's advisors&quot; at first - he immediately concluded a shameful peace with the Germans and left to enjoy the debauched pleasures of Rome before his father was hardly cold.  He was one of the very small group of emperors that nothing good can be said.  2)  Rome didn't &quot;fall due to greed and spectator sports&quot; - the Roman Empire basically was mortally wounded by plague that depopulated huge areas of the empire, with the resulting economic and military downturns, and due to pressure from the nomadic barbarians and barbarization of the army.  If the two great epidemics (one during Marcus Aurelius's time) hadn't happened, it is very possible today's major language would be based on Latin.    Anyway, it's a GREAT movie - grab it. One should also check out that wonderful film, &quot;Fall of the Roman Empire&quot; which covers similar ground, but in a very different plotline - another great film, and Will Durant (the historian) was an advisor on it.  And please disregard the numerous bad user reviews of this film, also.  It's a very good movie.
B00000IQC8|4.0|I watched Clerks last night on video with my wife after putting it off for a couple of years.  This is a very funny movie.  There is no plot per se, but essentially the movie centers around Dante, the convenience store clerk who has no direction in life and dreams about dumping his girlfriend Veronica, who is combative but loyal and caring, for his ex-girlfriend Caitlin, who cheated on him repeatedly when they were dating.  His buddy Randall, who works (sort of) at the nearby video store is the ultimate cool guy whose zen like observations about Dante's life are so on the mark.   Clerks is filled with funny and vulgar exchanges that I cannot repeat here, ... .  Also memorable is Silent Bob, played by the film maker Kevin Smith, who speaks only once but has the most profound line in the entire movie.   The girl who plays Veronica reminded me of Marisa Tomei in My Cousin Vinny.   My favorite scenes:  1) the chewing gum salesman trying to turn kids off of cigarette smoking,  2) the man who wants to use the rest room,  3) Randall ordering porno flicks over the phone in the presence of a young lady and her daughter, and 4) Dante and Veronica talking about how many people they have been with and their argument that ensues from it.   Clerks is a Gen-X classic best appreciated by high schoolers and those in their 20's, but even an old codger of 31 like myself can enjoy it too.
0684867621|5.0|I'm not a big fan (ok, but still a fan) of King's, but this book was excellent!  Ya, not so scary as some (just finished Desperation a few weeks ago - more scary!), but a well crafted novel about a small girl lost in the New England north woods.  No drooling, dissolving monsters in this book...just the kinds of &quot;things&quot; that any of us - adults included - could imagine if we were lost in the woods at night (or many nights in the case of this book).  Highly recommended and a fast read as it is fairly short for a King novel.  Good work Stephen!
0780631684|5.0|This movie will leave you thinking twice about life! I saw it in theatres three times and it was great everytime! This movie is not like all the horror movies like Scream and I Know What You Did Last Summer. Instead of a killer running around killing everyone with a knife, the killer is the in the wind. It's Death. The airplane crash was so vivid and real and the deaths were great! I highly reccomend this one!
0811826848|5.0|a Great overview on this very Important Band.great details&amp;Storys also Pictures.this book takes you from the start to the end of them as a Group.very Detailed.I have Read other Books on them but this one has all the goods.a Friend of mine who is more into the Beatles allowed me the chance to view this Book.it's worth a Viewing&amp;Reading.
B00004XMVM|4.0|I went to see this movie expecting the usual movie clichs, but found an entertaining story with a brain. The characters have more dimension and depth than they usually do in this type of movie. They question their motivations for having taken a course of action which may or may not have been the best decision-depending on the contex. The movie begins with an emergency crash-landing on a planet that has three suns, so it's always day time-24 hours a day. The planet is inhabited by strange beings- or animals?- that only come out to feed when it is dark. But since this planet has three suns, the survivors of the crash have nothing to worry-yet... Later they find out that every 22 years there is an eclipse that turns the planet-pitch black-waking the voracious beings that fly-and guess how many years have past since the last eclipse occurred? What I liked about the movie is that the traditional good guy/bad guy hero line was erased or smudged here. One of the survivors is the correctional officer who is to take a dangerous criminal to a prison, and he has a few skeletons in the closet ( the officer). The criminal named Riddick, is a muscle bound tough guy with an attitude, who as the story develops turns out to be more than meets the eye- so to speak...The actor who plays Riddick, Vin Diesel has a lot of character,(seldom found on young actors souch as himself) so much so that even when he's silent he delivers a strong performance. There are other survivors, a 13 year old boy, a religious man, among others. The pilot of the ship,is a woman called Fry, is constantly trying to keep command as the commanding officer and has a hard time keeping morals, survival and ethics in balance. The monsters will not attack if they keep a light source on. Soon they have no power to keep a light on, and the question is, how will they survive in the dark in an unknown landscape on a strange planet?  The special effects are well done, and the movie always keeps us watching, never a dullmoment. The pace of the movie is good, never to slow or to fast that you don't know what's going on. It's a very good movie to watch on a sunday afternoon with a bunch of friends.
B00004SCX6|3.0|I admit it. I like pop music. But only if the singers actually have talent, and decent lyrics, unlike Britney. Her lyrics are sappy, especially the only one she actually wrote, &quot;Dear Diary&quot; (sickeningly sweet). She has a few good songs, such as &quot;What U See.&quot; However, she has a thin voice and little talent. The album is not a total waste of money, because of the couple of good songs. But all the decent songs are in the front, so the rest of the album (Songs 8, 9, 11, &amp; 12) is just fluff. All in all, it would be better if you bought an album by a pop singer with TALENT, like Christina Aguilera or Mandy Moore.
B00004XONN|4.0|To my mind, Radiohead peaked with the release of 'The Bends' and whilst the wonderful 'OK computer' never stays far from my CD player, it never quite reached the parts of me that were tickled by their earlier offerings.<br />Kid A continues deeper into the realms that were embraced during the moodier elements of OK computer - perhaps a little too deep.  The Amazon reviewer hits the nail on the head with the suggestion that, in their efforts to push back the boundaries of traditional rock'n'roll/pop, the band slides into hitherto unexplored territory.  Whilst the creativity with which they do this is commendable, fans of their earlier guitar based anthems will initially find this album a chore.  For an example of this, I invite you to listen to the track &quot;Treefingers&quot; and make your own judgement.  It goes little beyond the sample on offer here. This is all good and well in the name of art, and perhaps I am missing the point, but I really can't see why this belongs on a pop album.<br />If this makes you think that I am unhappy with the CD, I have mislead you.  Once again, Radiohead have created something that eshews commerciality and seems to set out and almost punish those that enjoyed their earlier efforts.  It is not what you expected or hoped for.  However, it IS curiously addictive listening and challenges you to dislike it with almost every track - a notable exception is &quot;The National Anthem&quot; which climaxes with chaotic (almost comedic) horns.  Try not to smile as the track fades out.<br />Buy it, listen to it.  And keep listening to it.  If you keep your preconceptions at bay and it will grow on you with each audition and you will be rewarded... which is exactly what the band intended.
0684853523|5.0|A humorous read about the writing life and living. If you're looking for insight, some exceptional laughs, and a solid introduction to the value of living rather than existing...you'll LOVE this one!
0451191153|4.0|I would give this book 5 stars if I hadn't read Atlas Shrugged already.  While at least one review calls Rand's philosophy simplistic, living the philosophy gives the lie to his assertion that it is undesirable.  Rand's writings have given me a clarity of thought I heretofore had been denied.  Her philosophy was a part of my life before I found her books, but I was under the impression that I was wrestling with Satan with my thoughts.  Instead, I discovered that I was trying to deny my own existence by believing what I was taught.  Rand helped give me the words to fight the battle for my Self.  Do yourself a favor, read her books, and open yourself to existence.
0790749815|5.0|If it weren't for this DVD, I still wouldn't have respected North By Northwest as much as I do now.<br />Before, I had dismissed this film as entertaining Hitchcock fluff. But after watching this amazing DVD, in its glorious widescreen form (I originally bought the tape in regular old pan n' scan sans the documentary), I have a higher appriciation for this film. <br />The DVD is well-packaged with plenty of goodies inside: A music-only track (which is devine heaven for Bernard Herrmann freaks like myself), a commentary by Ernest Lehman, as well as a documentary on the film, which is so-so at best. But seeing this film in DVD form is amazing. It gives the film a special quality that VHS can not. Reccomended for any Hitchcock fan, or Cary Grant fan, or the plain old North By Northwest fan. :)
0446310786|5.0|This book sends a strong message about bigotry and racial prejudice and hatred that was experienced in the south by a small family.  It portrays the truth about then and sadly, even now. But not only does the book have a moral but it allows us to enjoy the childhood of Jed and Scout. Although often confusing and sometimes disturbing...I highly recommend this book...and I am a tough critic.
B00001PE4D|5.0|First off i want to say that cruel intentions is one of the best movies i've ever seen! its such a good drama its perfectley casted with sarah michelle playing the evil catherine adn just everything is perfect!

079073804X|5.0|This eternally shocking and sadistic masterpiece is a must-have for any DVD collection. The picture quality is clear and crisp enough to catch all the holy symbolism, the contrasting cinematography of the gorgeous desert sand and the chilly gloom of autumn Georgetown, and also the claustrophobic bedroom of possessed Regan. For anyone who was too young to experience this in a theater and was reduced to watching a hacked-up version on TV: BUY THIS NOW!!!!<br />Directed by true maverick William Friedkin, this film also has a great share of noteworthy performances, especially Linda Blair who was only twelve(!!) when this was made. I also have to give a hardy applause to the people responsible of picture and sound editing.<br />The extras in this Special Edition make it all the better when you find out the motives of making the movie with virtually everyone involved in a great BBC documentary (one debit: an annoying narrator). To get a peek at the design of make-up, the special effects tricks, the production design, talent rehersals, et al. makes you appreciate this stepping stone to a new age of horror films even more.
B00004XQP4|4.0|great CD overall! i'm hooked on &quot;Misery&quot; because it's so mellow and different sounding, the song is just amazing....towards the middle the songs start to blend and sound the same, the best tracks would have to be 1-6 and then 11 and 12...the middle 4 just seem to lose structure somewhere...but still an amazing album!
B000002INR|5.0|I'm tired of reading reviews of my favorite bands (Motley Crue, Skid Row, Kix, etc.) and seeing their sound described as &quot;unfortunately dated&quot;. Of course they're dated! Part of the appeal of Skid Row's debut, for instance, is that it's deliciously 80's sounding. I mean, you don't listen to SATURDAY NIGHT FEVER and complain that it's too 70's sounding. That's part of it's charm. Give it a rest people.

0553579908|3.0|I chose this book from among those available at an airport newsstand.  It made for an entertaining read and helped to while away the hours I had to spend in the concourse and aboard my flights.  However, when I say entertaining I do not mean that it was a great book or a fantastic story...merely entertaining.     Mr Martin can write a fine character when he's of a mind to do so.  Tyrion Lannister, Arya Stark, Jon Snow and Catelyn Stark are complex and intriguing.  But, in his rush to include everyone of import in Westeros, his characters suffer.  Major characters like Stannis, Renly, and Joff Lannister become two dimensional shades...capable of only one response to any given situation.     &quot;A Clash of Kings&quot; does distinguish itself when these characters are involved in the story lines.  They manage to exhibit a wide range of human emotions and elicit an equally wide range of emotional reactions.  But when he strays from Tyrion, Arya, Jon and Catelyn the story begins to drag.  It's almost as if Martin seeks to give depth to his world by trotting the names of places and people before the reader.     Most disturbing of all, is the cursory treatment given to the battles.  It is obvious that the Machiavellian workings of the principles is the centerpiece of this work, but it would have been nice to see one of them get better treatment than the &quot;X fought a battle and won/was vanquished&quot; that is resorted to time and time again.  Fantasy writers, as a rule, seem to be ignorant of war and it's sciences and tend to adopt a &quot;less said the better&quot; position.     On the whole, I think Mr Martin has written a good book filled with good characters.  It's nice to read a fantasy novel that's not filled with arcane magics and energies.  But he fails to replace the magical with the mundane and his characters suffer for it.  He'd have been better advised to write a shorter, more focused book.  Then we might have been treated to a great book peopled with great characters.
B00004XONN|4.0|I do not own Kid A yet, but I have heard it in it's entirity on the local alternative station.  It's not what I expected from Radiohead, but then again, haven't we always gotten what we haven't expected from Radiohead? This isn't at all like OK Computer or the Bends. Kid A focuses more on the music than lyrics. I found that the tracks flowed into each other, making it a great album to listen if you have time to sit down and listen to beginning to end.  It also has sort of a melancholiness to it, but well... most Radiohead songs do. It's just a great album all the way thru. It takes some getting used to, but trust me, you'll want to buy it. I personally like &quot;Optimistic&quot;. It gets constant airplay on the Philly alt station.
0790729628|5.0|- Director Ridley Scott gave us a great film here. The stylish noir feel, combined with the science fiction setting, made for one of the most innovative films of all time. - The cast is top notch as well, with Harrison Ford, Rutger Hauer, Edward James Almos, Sean Young, and Daryl Hannah all turning in wonderful performances that fit the tone of the piece. - The effects stand up well against the best there are today. - Some consider the &quot;Director's Cut&quot; to be lesser than the theatrical version. I personally favor not having everything spelled out for me. And the lack of the sunny ending doesn't bother me at all. - Don't let the directors opinion of Rick Deckard's identity keep you from this one. - Based upon Philip K. Dick's novel &quot;Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?&quot;

B00004U8P9|5.0|When I read that this was to be a 2 disk set, I wrongly assumed it was just a way to inflate the price.  That said, now I cannot believe they crammed all those goodies onto two disks.  The price very reasonable at Amazon.com<br />Having been a fan of the movies since 1981, and having memorized all the soundtrack since the same time, I was very excited to be able to see the deleted &quot;Superheroes&quot; number.  The other extra stuff was fun too.  The audience participation audio track was a dream come true.  Sadly, in the past, I actually tried to sinc up the VHS copy and the Audience Participation audio CD.  <br />Having the subtitles with the props was also a nice touch.  I always considered myself a &quot;props pro&quot; but I clearly missed out on some of the &quot;required&quot; props.<br />This is a perfect example of what happens when people that Love a film, get together to create a DVD product.  It is truly exceptional.  So many &quot;old&quot; movies often have nothing more than a trailer or two added.  Sometimes an audio track is included.  But this had just about every possible added feature you could want.<br />All in all, if I lost this DVD or it broke, I'd not hesitate to buy it again.  Hmm, maybe I better buy a backup copy in case it ever goes out of print.
0553573403|5.0|&quot;A Game of Thrones&quot; is an incredible fantasy epic.  Unique in its depth and detail describing the political turmoil in a fuedal kingdom.  Most of the familiar fantasy elements are here, but the focus is on the characters, and they could easily have been plucked straight for medival Europe.  Martin does not populate his fantasy world with and endless supply of elves and wizards and hobbits and the like, but gives us real human characters which the readers can understand and relate to.  The charcters each have their on complex desires and goals and this breings them each into to conflict with each other in ways too numerous to describe in anything less than the 800 pages of this book.<br />&quot;A Game of Thrones&quot; is a rare treat for the bold fantasy reader but the timid need not apply.  AGOT is dark, bloody, and intense, and at its enormous length (all the the more enormous when you consider Martin's entire tale will encompass six volumes) with every page full of complex plots and schemes, reading AGOT is quite a task.  But Martin's prose is easy to read and full of imagery, making AGOT a true joy to read.<br />The story is told from eight points of view.  Most of the POV characters are members of House Stark.  Lord Eddard Stark has been summoned to take the post of &quot;the King's Hand&quot; making him second only to the king. But Eddards conflict with King Robert's scheming wife soon place him and his family in danger as other forces plot to increase their own power and positions, it looks as if war is coming.<br />This all unfolds as winter (a season which last for years) is approaching, the last remaining heirs of the former king plot to return from their exile across the narrow sea, and mysterious forces from beyond the wall that defines the seven kingdom northern border begin moving south toward the lands of Lord Eddard.<br />&quot;A Game of Thrones&quot; is an amazing start.  If the other five books can do half as well, &quot;A Song of Ice and Fire&quot; will rival &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; as the ultimate fantasy epic.d Fire&quot; will rival &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; as the ultimate fantasy epic.

0451160916|5.0|This is a great story.  Stephen King is so good at desciption and history.  He desretely tells the reader the history of the story, without even really telling them.  He's feaking awesome.The movie is good too.Especially the part wit the dead girl in the bathtub.
B000000WF0|5.0|This is one of the best albums ever, maybe even THE best. Although a little repetitive, 'Bittersweet Symphony' opens this album perfectly. It is a great song with a fantastic melody and Ashcroft adds some great lyrics. My own personal favourite is 'Sonnet' as it seems to flow along perfectly, it's as good a song as you'll ever hear. It starts off with a nice acoustic guitar before building into a superb ballad. The ending is brilliant.<br />'The Rolling People' is another favourite of mine. It's very physcadelic and dark, a little in the style of 'Gas Panic' and 'Fade in-out' by Oasis. It has an incredible yet simple riff for the chorus and is a very well structured song made to fuul effect. 'The Drugs Don't Work' is a lovely, yet somewhat sad ballad. It deserved the success as it is great.<br />'Catching In The Butterfly' is another change of direction and is very diiferent from the other songs. Ashcrofts voice is excellent on this track. 'Neon Wilderness' is good following on from track 5 and then 'Space and Time' is another fantastic song, especially the bridge/pre chorus which is beautiful. It could have been a single but for the quality of the other songs.<br />'Weeping Willow' is another great song. From the first note to the last words it is an unbelievably brilliant effort. The lyrics and tune are exceptional. Another good single release is 'Lucky Man' which is another sound rock song. 'One Day' opens with beautiful lyrics and the song goes on from there really.<br />'This Time' sets the stage for an amazing climax to the album. The main melody in this is superb and it is in the same style as 'Weeping Willow'. 'Velvet Morning' for me makes this whole album. I wasn't too keen on the verse at first but after listening to it some more I like it. The chorus and ending are phenominal, made from three simple chords (A, E and D5), it just sounds so perfect.<br />'Come On' is a real rock and roll ending to a great album with Ashcroft hurling his voice, and a bit ofswearing, down the microphone towards the end. His voice bleeds emotion and he, and the Verve, are truly brilliant musicians. It's a shame they split up. Apart from Oasis, no one were as good as the Verve. Good luck to Richard Ashcroft, his solo album is fantastic.
0446604844|2.0|Interesting idea, but oddly written.  I'm not talking grammar and syntax, like some other reviewers.  I refer to the over-the-top style.  Everything is a crisis!!!  On every page characters are wincing or gimacing, their throats are constricting, they cannot breathe.  I spent a lot of my time rolling my eyes.  Why didn't I just put it down?  Good question- it is just compelling enough to keep turning those pages.
630280082X|5.0|I love this movie it's god a good theme and plot, but they should have chose a better lead roleplayer.(macchio is a horrible actor)  The movie kicks ten kinds! It is a must see!  Especially the grande finale' (Vai-Cooder)
0553106635|5.0|This fantasy series continues to live up to the extremely high standard set with the first volume. These books are novels first, and fantasy genre second. In other words, characters are fully developed, plot lines are far from predictable, the writing style is never annoying or weak (as so frequently with Robert Jordan and others) and fantasy cliches have satisfyingly failed to appear.<br />Oh, there are three dragons, but in this book they are not cliches and not what you think. The magical elements are deftly handled and not dominant.<br />The books are filled with adventure and surprise, but it must also be said that they are very bleak indeed. The world that Martin depicts is one torn by war and he does not hesitate to show us what that really means. So, if you want sunshine and light all round, then this series is not for you. But, that aside, if you are looking for absorbing fiction written by a master of the art, then read this series ... but definitely start with the first book. And, if you have already read the first two, reread them before beginning this one. You'll be glad you did.
B00003CX8J|5.0|OK. I have always been a huge comic fan and because of this I almost did not attend X-Men the Movie because of D.C. predecessors such as Superscam / Flatman and Spleen and lets not even start with Supergirl.  How refreshing to find a hero based movie with (a) a plot (b) enough continuity for the die hard fans and enough introduction for newcomers and (c) a talented cast second to none - Hugh Jackman as Wolvie was a surprisingly awesome move and I'll wager he who said &quot;no&quot; to the role will be kicking himself.  It would have been nice to see Patrick take a more active role but maybe this will occur in the sequel - there has to be a sequel.  I have so far seen this movie about a dozen times the last half dozen simply to play spot the mutants at the school.  Awesome movie ... awesome effects ... puts the X in eXtreme entertainment.
B00000FCBC|5.0|How many bands could pull this off?  Not many.  You have here over two hours of awesome covers done as only Metallica could.  Some you probably know, but many you probably don't.  There seems to be a dividing line here, which is where many of the (and I use this term loosely) fans who think Metallica sold out seem to stand.  Disc one is newly recorded, and thus sounds more like &quot;new Metallica&quot; and Disc two is older, thus sounding like &quot;old Metallica&quot;.  So, they then see the album as half good, half bad.  I prefer old Metallica to new, but still like it all, so I see it as half brilliant and half really good.  There are a lot of standouts on both discs, on Disc one we have &quot;Sabbra Cadabra&quot; (Metallica covering Sabbath?  I'm not in Heaven, am I?), the Mercyful Fate thing (I'm not crazy about Mercyful Fate, but Metallica does their stuff really well), the greatly improved &quot;Turn the Page&quot; and &quot;Whiskey in the Jar&quot;, and my personal favorite of the disc, &quot;Astronomy&quot;.  Wow, it's great.  Blue Oyster Cult was great, but Metallica does this song even better.  However, &quot;Free Speech for the Dumb&quot; is just awful, and completely ruins the disc.  I recommend skipping over it.  Okay, now we have Disc two.  Where to begin?  Well, I'd say that the Diamond Head covers are the best on here, I've had an education to Diamond Head thanks to this album, great band, sorta the Metallica before Metallica.  Another band I've discovered through this album is Budgie, but I was disappointed to find they're not quite as heavy as when Metallica covers them (but they were still ahead of their time).  The Motorhead covers are great, too, but the production quality could be better on a couple of them, I forget which.  &quot;Stone Cold Crazy&quot;, my favorite Queen song, in the case of BOC, is done even better by Metallica, truly thrilling.  &quot;So What&quot; is outrageously hilarious, but don't let the little ones hear it.  Yep, all in all, a magnificent achievement.  This proves that Metallica is one of the best (anyone else might have been sued!), makes Slayer's &quot;Undisputed Attitude&quot; look pretty bad (come on Tom, Kerry, you coulda done better!).  The only complaint I have is that I wish I'd known more of these songs beforehand, it would have increased my appreciation of Metallica doing them, but well, I'm only 17, and hey, it opened doors for me.  Sorry about the length of this review, but you know what they say, &quot;a long review for a long album&quot;.  Just buy this thing, it is incredible!in all, a magnificent achievement.

B00003CXDG|5.0|I was dissapointed to see that most of the reviews for this movie were less than favorable.  I'll admit that this film has little in common with the first film, and the entire Mission Impossible TV series,  but thats not the point of this movie. Like most action films, the point is to take you on a ride of spectacle, and MI2 does that over and over again.  Any complaints against the film are by people who have developed such a short attention span that they cant sit through any &quot;boring scenes with no action&quot;.   Lighten up,  this movie isnt trying to win the best picture oscar,  its just trying to have fun.  Forget about everything else and enjoy the ride.
B000002NHN|5.0|Every single Loreena McKennitt recording bears something wonderfully new and inventive in the way it is presented. This is no exception. Though this disc lacks the Celtic feel of &quot;The Visit&quot;, the sounds and instrumentation on this CD are on par with anything Loreena has released in the past. The amazing part of this CD is it's ability to totally entrance and seduce the listener. The sounds are so new and refreshing that it is impossible to comprehend the complexity of each nuance, each sound of every song in just one listen. Several listens are needed to appreciate the brilliance that this woman possesses. &quot;Skellig&quot;, &quot;Dante's Prayer&quot; and &quot;Night Ride Across The Caucasus&quot; are superior efforts. It is so gratifying to know that others feel the same and were drawn to Loreena following the success of &quot;The Mummer's Dance&quot; as a single. Unfortunately, this may be her last studio effort, following a very personal loss - a great disappointment to say the least. Here's hoping that she will continue to mesmerize us with her intelligent, achingly beautiful music.

0767803434|4.0|This will always be one of my fav. movies. The suspense, action, and terror (yes, I was in some scenes) are unmatched in the industry. The special effects were lacking in some areas though, as is the realism. I remember one scene when Ford is clearly shown in the movie to have ONE H&amp;K MP5 submachine-gun. Yet, he uses about 50 rounds of ammo with one MP5 (the magazine can only hold 30). Yes, for you non-gun fanatics, I'm not making any sense, but that scene was just funny to me. And nevertheless, after he appears the run out of ammo on that gun, he conviently finds another terroist to steal one from. Very funny if you watch it a couple of times. Don't forget the posts about the plane never undergoing &quot;explosive decompression&quot; from all the 5.56 and 9mm rounds. All in all still a wonderful movie
6305922756|5.0|When I anxiously poped this dvd into my player for the first time and watched the intro screen I was rolling on the floor laughing.

From music videos, to interviews, to hours of deleted scenes your hunger for more after the movie will be fullfilled.<br />As soon as the movie was finished I watched it over with the commentary on and laughed even harder all the way through.
078401213X|5.0|This film is beautifully done from the cinematography to the compelling character portrayal of a calculative, paranoid sociopath on the verge of understanding our universe.  I guess it would be unfair to call him paranoid since most of his fears were justifiable.  Fans of Kubrick, indy films, and or math will gladly hand over 90 minutes of their time for this movie.
6304119046|5.0|I had to watch this movie five or six times before I realized what a truly great film it is...and it's not because of the acting or cinamatography or special effects or any of that kind of thing.  Citizen Kane, more than any other film that I am aware of, lets us into the most inner reaches of the soul of the main character.  The ... review of this film sums up the conclusion of this film as &quot;...people are the sum of their contradictions, and can't be known easily&quot;.  But that's not true - Charles Foster Kane is a remarkably simple man, whose whole life has been a fruitless search for one thing - unconditional love.<br />I've known people like this--wealthy, influential, who seemingly have it all.  The problem here is that everyone wants something from them.  They are loved, but conditionally.  Pay their salary, and people will love you.  Stand up for their rights, and people will love you.<br />Imagine being 8 years old and sent away by your mother, the one person you were sure loved you unconditionally, never to see her again.  And on top of that, you are one of the richest people on the face of the earth.  How could you ever be sure again that anyone loved you for yourself?  This movie is the story of that unsuccessful search for unconditional love, and the longing for Rosebud, the symbol of the last time Kane experienced it.<br />Citizen Kane is known to have been based on the life of William Randolph Hearst, but I doubt Orson Welles had ever met the man prior to making this film.  He must have known well someone similar to Kane to so thouroughly understand how a wealthy and powerful person can be, deep down, so insecure.

Cruise is just as fun as always.  Thandie Newton is beautiful and talented.  If you've seen Ever After, it's a trip to see Dougray Scott as the quite wicked villian.  And I just adore Ving Rhames - my only problem with this movie is that he wasn't on screen enough!  As for the plot?  Who cares!  The world was threatened and a dedicated team of adventurers came to the rescue.  And they did it with flash and style.<br />When I'm looking for plot and art I look for something along the lines of Shakespeare in Love.  When I'm looking for thoughtless fun, I look for Mission Impossible.
B00004XONN|4.0|Let's take a trip back to 1997...Before Monica, before Jordan retired, and before any Y2K scare.  In July of that summer, amidst the height of all the electronica hype, an English band by the name of Radiohead released an album entitled &quot;OK Computer&quot;.  Ready to be writen of by everyone because of the lack of success or radio hit from their previous album &quot;The Bends&quot;, it changed the course of modern music.  I bought that album solely on the facts that I liked &quot;Fake Plastic Trees&quot; from The Bends, and it had recieved 4 stars in Rolling Stone, in an article I neglected to read.  It took some time for my 14 year old ears to get used to, but eventualy I realized the true genious of these 5 lads from England, as did pretty much everyone else in the world.  Like I said earlier, this album single handledly changed the course of modern music and the rest is history.  If you don't know the history, give OK Computer another listen and it should clear itself up.  This brings us up to date.  The &quot;history&quot; described above consited simply of EVERYONE (including the Grammys) falling in love with &quot;Computer&quot; and eagerly awaiting a follow-up.  But 3 years passed, and frankly I got tired of waiting.  My musical tastes changed, as did my intrests and lifestyle in general.  When I heard that Radiohead was comming out with a new album, I was only mildly interested.On October 3, everyone recieved Kid A, Radiohead's responce ( I refuse to call it a follow-up) to OK Computer.  I bought it out of respect. I felt that it should be good, just because OK was genious and this shouldn't be too much less.  I've only listened through it two times (I've also gone over their other albums), and am now convinced that Radiohead is a musical juggernaunt that can not be stopped.  The reason that I love this band is because there NEVER do what's expected.  This is NOT a follow-up to Computer...instead it clears up or uncovers what OK failed to.  I'm sure thattheir next album will discover all that was not on Kid A.  Some of these things they've uncovered were: The subtle jazz horns on &quot;National Anthem&quot;, the rediscovery of a great acoustic pop song (ala Fake Plastic Trees) in &quot;How To Disappear Compleetely&quot; and compleetely mocking everything OK denounced in &quot;Idioteque.&quot;&quot;This is really happening&quot;-the repeated phrase from &quot;Idioteque&quot;.  Radiohead has done it again.  It will be interesting to watch what Kid A has to do to modern music.
B00003CXE7|5.0|Russel Crowe and Ridley Scott prove beyond doubt that outstanding filmmaking is still all about masterful storytelling. The heroic tale of Maximus the general and gladiator keeps you spellbound from opening shot to the ending credits---thanks to the no-nonsense realism of Russel Crowe's portrayal , as well as the outstanding ---and sometimes scene stealing---performances by Joaquin Phoenix, Oliver Reed, and Richard Harris.<br />Of course, the riveting visuals and perfect pacing of the film are all signature Ridley Scott and provide the story-telling with  gritty, contemporary, and ---on occasion---ethereal qualities.  Who would think that the sandals-and-toga genre would be this captivating ?<br />Gladiator is an outstanding movie and certainly headed for hall-of-fame status. Perfect from all angles and so timely in its universal themes of heroism, strength, honor, and character.  It is a must-see for all, a must-die-for-to-collect for all great film afficionados.<br />Strength &amp; Honor forever!!!
B000002J1M|5.0|This album will forever be associated with January 1973, my senior year of high school. Going by Empire Music in Bethesda, Maryland, I spy this promotional album in the cut-out bin near the cash register that has a really strange cover. A fox with a lady's body standing on what looks like a floating chunk of ice? Far f**king out, man! I plunk down my $2.99 for the (vinyl) disc, hitchike home, slap the album on my turntable--and hear the best music I'd heard in a long time. It all came back to me tonight listening to &quot;Supper's Ready&quot; in all it's original glory. The years have gone by and that genesis of Genesis has gone by, too. Doesn't matter---the music on this album is timeless and involving and only reminds me each time I hear it of what a good band this really was.
B00004X01U|4.0|Madonna has never been one to jump on any bandwagon; her tendency, rather, is to be the driver.  Her new flavor: dance floor cowgirl funkstress.  Writing more creative lyrics that are the most exposing she's even sung, Madonna is displaying a wide range of maturity.<br />Don't judge Music, the album, by hearing &quot;Music&quot;, the single.  While the song is the catchiest and funkiest and probably will be the biggest hit of the album, Music offers a lot more, and excluding &quot;Music,&quot; the slower songs are the real gems.<br />&quot;Nobody's Perfect&quot; is her most self-exposing; she admits her mistakes and flaws but welcomes them and grows from them.  The use of the vocoder on this song and subtle and very appropriate to the song.  In fact, it's the only song it really sounds good on.  &quot;What It Feels Like For a Girl&quot; is one of the best songs, along with &quot;Gone,&quot; of the album.  It sounds like it could have been written by a younger Madonna during her earlier career.  &quot;Gone&quot; opens up with what must be Madonna's mantra for meditation: &quot;Selling out is not my thing.&quot;  These are simple pop songs, but they are beautiful and profound.<br />However, a couple songs are miserable compared to the rest of the album.  &quot;Impressive Instant&quot; is annoying and campy with more vocoder-tricks; these are overdone though.  &quot;Paradise (Not For Me)&quot; is the last miss of the album.  Contrite and stuffy, Madonna rasps out most of the lyrics for the song, and don't forget your French dictionary on this one--Madonna goes bilingual.  These are the only misses of the album though.<br />Overall, the sound is a leap ahead of her earlier work being even more playful and experimental, but still without the drama and lingering that made Ray of Light a milestone in Madonna's career.  Still, extremely capable and very fun...
B00003CX5P|3.0|&quot;The Phantom Menace&quot; is an exciting entry in the Star Wars saga.  However inventive and visually stylish, the film nearly fails due to a weak story and tepid performances.  Comparable in quality to &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot;, &quot;Menace&quot; lacks the charm and magic of the original three films.<br />The saving grace of &quot;Episode I&quot; is the highly inventive surrounding that Lucas puts these characters in.  Everything in Episode I looks different from the classic trilogy.  The worlds seem more populated and organized but it leaves you a bit unsatisfied.  There are highly complex action sequences which are a Star Wars staple.  But they would be more effective if we were given something more important to care about than a trade dispute on Naboo.<br />As for Anakin, I feel young Jake Lloyd did a competant job.  I feel it was a mistake to make Anakin an eight year old but that was Lucas' fault.  The film succeeds to entertain, but fails to offer anything new in the Star Wars saga.  The biggest slap in the face to fans of the series is Lucas' blatant disregard of the mystical Force.  Explaining the existence of the Force as if it were a Next Generation episode.  Episode II better not have any midichlorians.
B000002O7C|5.0|This is an amazing soundtrack, probably the best movie soundtrack ever made. The movie would not have been what it was without this music. The first song on this CD alone is a good reason to buy it.

0684853523|5.0|Whenever a newly released copy of Stephen King's latest work finds itself in my hands, I feel like I am visting an old friend.  Every tale brings new characters and new places (most of them small towns in Maine) but regardless of content, it is always vintage King.  On Writting is no different.  Half revealing self reflection and half instruction manual for the aspiring writer, this book sparkles through and through.  King's ability to tell a story roars to life as he recounts memorys one after another, from childhood adventures and loves that would shape the man the world knows today, to his shockingly candid look at his adult alcohol and drug abuse.  His text book on writing (no pun intended) is the most fun you will ever have learning and would be a great help and inspriation to any one with a yern to tell a story on paper.  Once again, Stephen King has made me hateful to turn that last page.  Visit again sometime soon, Steve.  I love the company!
0446608955|4.0|Are you a girl? Then you will love this book!  Are you a boy?  You may not like it quite as much.  A Walk to Remember is a bittersweet, inspiring book.  It starts out with a man who is in his late fifties telling about his senior year in high school.  This man's name is Landon Carter.  The year is 1958, and he lives in Beaufort, North Carolina.  Landon is a fairly normal young man, who in his own words, doesn't really excel in anything.  He is elected president of his senior class, and Homecoming is soon to arrive.  He doesn't have a date, so he decides to invite Jamie Sullivan, a girl he has known all his life.  Jamie is a do-gooder.  Her favorite activities include reading the Bible and visiting the orphanage, not to mention that her dad is the pastor of the local church that Landon attends.  He asks her, and she agrees.  At the dance, Landon's ex-girlfriend, Angela, shows up drunk and makes quite a mess in the bathroom.  Jamie and Landon clean it up, and Landon realizes that Jamie really is different.  She convinces him to be the lead in a Christmas pageant, one that has been performed every year, called \\"The Christmas Angel\\", and it just so happens that Jamie's dad wrote the play.  He agrees, grudgingly.  Throughout the practices, Landon walks Jamie home, and they talk about all sorts of things, mostly God, since Jamie is a devout Christian.  For Christmas, Jamie gives Landon a Bible, but not just any Bible.  It's the Bible that belonged to her mother before she died giving birth to Jamie.  This is a very special gift for Landon.  He soon finds himself falling in love with Jamie.  They spend a lot of time together.  Before long, Landon finds out that Jamie is very sick.  In fact she has a very rare case of leukemia, and she is dying.  In the little time that they have left together, Jamie still inspires Landon and never feels sorry for herself.  A little time before she dies, they decide to get married.  After she dies, the story returns to present day, and theman, Landon Carter is still very much in love with Jamie and always will be.  Despite the sadness of her death, Landon comes to know Christ through her, and knows the true meaning of love.
0684853523|5.0|King's new book is an outstanding writing manual, although King himself will be the first to say it's not a &quot;manual&quot; at all.  It's like driving across the country with the best writer in the univerwe and having a bull session about his life and writing.  Two great things: one, King not only shows you examples of bad writing, he tells you WHY it's bad.  Two, he shows a blue-pencil job he did on his own story.  The minor changes make an incredible difference in the readability and flow of the story.  This book is a brief autobiography plus a treatise on what ails much of the world of writing today.  And, if you've ever attended writing seminars or taken college classes in the subject, you will know his complaints and jabs are right on.  I only wish the book could've been 500+ pages.  You'll LOVE it!
B00001U0GQ|5.0|Out of the 3 Michael Mann movies I own (Last of the Mohicans, The Insider and Heat) this is certainly the best.  A classic story with beatiful scenery and an excellent soundtrack.  Daniel Day-Lewis is fabulous.
B000024JEX|5.0|This is a great set. Where his Sun Bear Concerts set is moving, beautiful music, these discs are just plain fun. These guys are, without a doubt, the tightest trio playing, and this set proves it.
0140157352|4.0|Often the mere mention of the term negotiations is enough to evoke less than positive images and ideas within most people.  The book gives readers a chance to peceive the negotiations process from a perspective where everyone can benefit.  It provides a realistic framework for negotiators on either side of the table to formulate their approach on the issue at hand.<br />Before you pass judgement that this is simply a repackaging of the Win-Win negotiations concept found in other books, let me assure you that this would be an incorrect conclusion.<br />Let me sum it up by saying BATNA.  Curious?  Read the book and I think you will be pleasantly surprised.

B00004XONN|5.0|Ok...so i waited forever for this album to come out. I had known before hand that it would be a bit different from the last album, as have the rest. After the first listen, I was confused to say the least, and I was hesitant about listening to it again. So, after listening to it about two more times, everything seemed a bit more clear to me. All of the sudden I was falling in love with every song I heard. And when you think about it, these songs on this album are very similar to what Radiohead has done before. Beautifully composed songs, that evoke a lot of emotion. Except, Radiohead, is not going to make every song sound the same...and if you're expecting to hear &quot;The Bends&quot; every time you pick up a Radiohead album, than you will be sadly disappointed, and your music taste really doesn't stretch that far. To me, they're a type of band who is trying to stretch their fans' taste and interest in music all on their own. I can understand why it is hard to listen to at first. And to be honest I was a bit disappointed by the lack of Thom's voice, and, should I say, real instruments....but I can also just go listen &quot;OK Computer&quot; whenever I'm feeling like I want that.  Radiohead shouldn't be criticized for doing something new. They should be praised for doing what they do best...which is creating something different all the time. A lot of artists don't have the talent to do that, sadly enough. I've already chosen my two favorites from the album..&quot;How to Disappear Completely..&quot; and &quot;Idioteque&quot;...mostly because the first one has all of these very typical RH elements (the feel of it sort of reminds me of &quot;Fake Plastic Trees&quot; meets &quot;Exit Music&quot;), and at the same time, &quot;Idioteque&quot; has none of the typical RH elements to it. It's just this classic creation, that i can honestly say I've never heard anywhere before. My only real disappointment on the album, is &quot;Motion Picture Soundtrack&quot;. I've heard other versions of that song before, that were much more expressive of the lyrics, that i just wasn't feeling as much in this album version, however, I'm still amazed with the sound of it. I'm not going to say that anyone is wrong for disliking this album, because at first I really thought I wasn't going to listen to it again....but if you don't like it at first, just try listening to it again....and again...and again, if you have to. It will grow on you, and amaze you.
B00004XQP4|5.0|As a die hard Green Day fan, I had great expectiations for this CD, and on October third they were fulfilled.  I grant you, this dosnt have to spunk that Dookie had, and its not as punk as their earlier kerplunk and 1039/smothed out slappy hours, but songs like &quot;Church on Sunday&quot; and &quot;Macys Day Parade&quot; prove this album is wonderful.  I'm glad Green Day didnt go the route of Blink 182 as an almost pop band, because pop is way too over rated and its time for the pop bands to pass on their fame to Rock and Pop!  Long live rock! Anyway, definatly buy this CD, its worth it.
630512762X|5.0|This movie is the best of the best if you like action movies this is for you. Sometimes you have movies like mission impossible and it is really confusing well it might sound like this movie is confusing  but it really isn't not even close. This is my favorite movie until matrix came out but this is still worth your money but it does have some bad words so watch out.
0684847817|5.0|This book was a wonderful insight in Faerie Lore.  I recommend this book to all of those who have an imagination that was made to grow!!! Enjoy!
B00003CXE7|5.0|I don't even know how to start about this movie it is one of the best movies I have ever seen. It has a lot of nice fights, good story, and just really awesome. If your looking for a good action movie mixed with adventure this is the movie for you trust me. You will love it, it's a little long but once your done watching it you will wish it was longer.
B000002VTE|3.0|there are more beautiful records out there (anything by My Bloody Valentine, Cocteau Twins, The Black Watch, Slowdive) but the sheer majesty if not audacity of the arrangements and the feel, as it were, of this record makes it worth auditioning a number of times.  Spacemen 3 were utterly transcendental, utterly mindblowing.  immense bands fade, splinter groups never equal their sources, and everyone has his own opinion:  buy this or borrow it, but you still do need to hear it.  let's try to be fair.
0553106635|4.0|Martin has again reached the heights he hit with A Game of Thrones.  A Storm of Swords is rife with intrigue and betrayal on a scope that dwarfs any other major medieval/fantasy series.  As usual, there is plenty of action but Martin understands the psychological wounds that fester in people's souls from their early years and which shape people's adult lives.  His main characters have more depth than major characters in any series other than Tolkien or Donaldson.  Even though he paints stark portraits (Roose Bolton, Balon Greyjoy, Walder Frey), those bit-players have subtlety and nuance to their personae.  <br />Most stunningly, Martin is not averse to killing off (literally) major characters.  In a Storm of Swords, many major players meet their demise and others meet a different doom.  Be prepared for the cliff-hanger ending that sets up the last 3 books in the series.<br />This volume was well-worth the expense of buying it from Amazon's UK site.  Thanks to Mr. Martin for winning the battle with his US publisher and keeping Storm of Swords one volume.
B00003CXAT|5.0|Director Steven Spielberg's spectacular blockbuster has finally arrived on DVD. The exceptional blockbuster set box-office records and remains one of the most popular FX films of all time. In a mysterious tropical island, eccentric billionaire John Hammond (Richard Attenborough) has created the ultimate theme park with living dinosaurs and invites a group of scientists (Sam Neill, Laura Dern & Jeff Goldblum) to inspect the park first hand. When a greedy employee (Wayne Knight) shuts down the park's security system, the prehistoric beasts escape and threaten the park's guests. Acclaimed director Steven Spielberg is still a master of landmark filmmaking. Based on the best-selling novel by Michael Crichton, \\"Jurassic Park\\" is an astounding edge-of-your-seat thrill ride. This impressive Sci-Fi adventure contains an engaging well structured storyline, strong performances and breathtaking thrills. Its remarkable visual effects set new standards in CGI effects technology. \\"Jurassic Park\\" grossed over $900 million worldwide, won three Academy Awards and spawned a multimillion dollar franchise.<br /><br />\\"Jurassic Park\\" Collector's Edition is a welcome addition to any DVD collection. This dazzling blockbuster is presented in 1.85:1 anamorphic widescreen format. Its picture quality is superb with vibrant colors and great sharpness. The Dolby Digital 5.1 sound is impressive with aggressive surround effects for an exciting home theater experience. The DVD comes fully loaded with great supplemental features including the revealing \\"The Making of Jurassic Park\\" behind-the-scenes documentary, \\"Raptors in the Kitchen\\" SFX featurette, theatrical trailers, an informative Dinosaur Encyclopedia, storyboards, production notes and DVD-ROM extras. The interactive DVD menus are really nice. With such interesting features and great viewing quality, \\"Jurassic Park\\" Collector's Edition earns an \\"A\\".
B00004XONN|5.0|well, I won't go on about standout tracks or art or concepts.  I'll just say that in my personal opinion, Radiohead takes a further plunge into the &quot;space rock&quot; genre from which Pink Floyd emerged years ago.  Fans of Radiohead that say they were disappointed by this album can't possibly be real fans of what Radiohead is and has been. the best part of a band like this is discovering these exciting new musical dimensions along with the band. many reviews said this is what music will be in the future. I hope so, this album is just fine with me.
0679720200|4.0|While I loved the book and its concepts, it left me feeling rather depressed about the characters. It was written well and really got the author's philisophical views across, developing characters well.
B00004RFFU|2.0|This movie is mostly for Anne Rice fans. I thought the movie was okay but you get tired of Louis whining through the whole thing.I prefer Dracula to these pansy vampires. Are all the vampires gay in this movie? I also did not like the line about Bram Stroker being a demented Irishman. Dracula is a classic novel, not this pornotrash of Anne Rice.If I was a vampire I would make myself vampire friends and party all night, not brood and whine like these losers. If these characters were straight they would make themselves vampire girlfriends! Even real life gay men who become vampires would be having more fun than these losers!I did like the production value and the location shooting. (You can visit sights where the film was made in New Orleans in the French quarter and on a plantation outside New Orleans)I did not understand how Louis killed the vampires in Paris. How come they did not come back to life like Lestat? I prefer the Dracula legends, not all of this revisionism of Anne Rice. I do love New Orleans and the location shooting which is why I give it 2 Stars.

0671775308|4.0|This book reveals interesting statistics about real-life wealthy people and their habits/secrets. <br />There is a lot of good advice and examples (some technical) on how to acheive wealth but the true eye opener is that self-made millionaires adopt a lifestyle which can be surprising...they are frugal. (ie may not be wearing a Rolex!)<br />This changed my personal outlook on becoming wealthy. For example by keeping my car a couple of extra years...then buying the model I wanted but 1year old instead of new etc.<br />The book shows us how if we truly adopt a frugal lifestyle it is much more realistic to become wealthy.  The great irony I see in this is that to become wealthy you need to focus your life on LIVING and not on THINGS or money itself (ie be frugal). <br />This book truly demonstrates methods and ways that people who adopt this lifestyle acheive the most in monetary terms.<br />This book is a definite must buy for anyone interested in gaining serious wealth no matter what your income may be.
B00004XONN|4.0|Let me make it simple for you.  If you feel like wading through almost 600 reviews here's what you're bound to find.  <br />Probably 90% of people think this recording is godhead (and perhaps they gush just a bit too much about it.)  The other 10% are either:<br />A. 17 year olds complaining &quot;where's my Bends and my Pablo Honey!  This isn't Radiohead!&quot;<br />B. People who obviously have no tolerance for a band that grows (or god forbid gets all &quot;experimental&quot; on them)<br />Kid A is darn good and its amazing that a band so popular has the integrity and the guts to keep pushing themsleves to new levels without worry of what their fans might think.  It's a more mature disc than anything they've done before and I think Radiohead just might have realized at the end of the extremely heavy OK Computer that the most radical thing one can sometimes do is to just turn off the distortion pedal.  <br />Kid A is an astonishingly oblique pop album that doesn't give up all its secrets all at once.  You won't grow tired of this one in a week.
B00004SU5J|5.0|With so many &quot;global lounge&quot; and trippy dub discs coming out recently, it is tough to decide what to get and it is rare that an album is so clearly as superior to the rest of its genre as is St. Germain's tourist.<br />Borrwing a page from Moby's Play and expanding on it, this disc is a combination of looped dub-like drums and bass sounds, vocal samples and live studio musicians.  The combination is astounding.  Deep seductive drum loops and bass tracks lay the foundation while the live insturmentation (horns, flute, keyboards, and percussion) are layered over the top.  Finally, jazz, blues, and latin vocal fragments float through the songs like swirls of puffy clouds floating through an otherwise perfect blue sky.<br />This CD is a delicious combination of sounds.  If any of the jazz cats from Miles Davis to Ben Webster could hear this, they would recognize that same smokey, groovy goodness that makes their own records perpetual favorites.  In fact, if Davis was the birth of cool, this is certainly a rebirthing or an upate for the new millenium.<br />Do yourself a favor and pick this up.
B00004XONN|5.0|so, here's the story.  it suddenly dawned on me thursday night that there was a new Radiohead album that just popped into stores on Tuesday.  For some distant, unescapable reason, i felt a necessary urge to get &quot;Kid A,&quot; listen to it, finish a college application, and get into bed sometime before 2 o'clock the next morning.  i was never a Radiohead fan in the past...  i bought OK Computer, certainly a more-than-deceent album, a couple years before...  Nevertheless, i never found myself really grabbed by the group.  But, call it divine intervention, i succeeded in my quest and got &quot;Kid A&quot; thursday night.  I proceeded to lay down in bed, slightly crank up the volume, and press the play button.  By the first few chords, i was hooked.  &quot;Kid A&quot; is an incredible album, layered to the brim with musical textures.  It never fails to grasp the listener's imagination and heart in its melodies and tones and words.  It's remarkable.  Just to give you an idea...  I promise you, anyone who even slightly enjoys Pink Floyd will love &quot;Kid A&quot;.  It continuously pays homage to &quot;Dark Side of the Moon,&quot; yet still manages to create its own form of rock and roll.  The album focuses on the significance of people's actions and responsibility...  sure, it comes with a little booklet with a bunch of funky, off-beat, slightly pretentious artwork...  but the album's music itself is, in a single word, beautiful.  Radiohead, kudos for this one.  Please, i'm beggin' you on my knees to buy this thing.  [P.S.- there's a secret booklet of more artwork and stuff on the inside of the jewel case.  you have to pry open the black plastic cover that holds the cd on the inside of the jewel case...  it's kinda groovy to find...  it made me grin.  :) ]
B00004TL21|5.0|This is a damn awesome CD...it is so strange because this CD compares to Tool's Aenima so much and i thought only Maynard himself could compete with his albums. I hadta write a review....here are the stand-out tracks&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 1,3,6,10, and ll...all the rest are awesome too but not as mind-numbing.  I actually got the new release so the tracks start with *Back To School(Mini Maggit)*  For the unfortunate ones who got the older version (the one that doesnt have one extra track)get a slower version of *back in school* on track 12...i tell ya what i like the heart beat sound at the end of that song (kew Bass-line)...BUT besides the point..This is a really great album no 1 should pass up!  Listen to &quot;Change, Passanger, and digital bath&quot; AWESOME
B00004T8RK|4.0|After seeing some of Binaural's material played live at The Palace in Auburn Hills, and hearing the incredible performances on their European &quot;bootlegs&quot; (if you haven't picked up any of those double disc packages yet, DO SO; they're unbelievable), I have to concede that Binaural really IS a fine effort after all, contrary to my earlier review.  They do virtually every song from Binaural on this tour (with the possible exception of &quot;Parting Ways,&quot; which I don't see on any of their &quot;bootlegs&quot;) and every song gets better every time I hear (or see) it.  In concert, songs like &quot;Soon Forget&quot; become an instant crowd-pleaser (Eddie with a ukelele!)...&quot;Nothing As it Seems&quot; becomes a bluesy, atmospheric tour de force...&quot;Thin Air&quot; takes on that 40,000-people-singing-along quality reserved for classics such as &quot;Small Town&quot; and &quot;Betterman&quot;...and &quot;Of the Girl&quot; receives the smooth-as-silk, darn-near-an-improv, we-could-stretch-this-out-for-30-minutes-if-we-wanted-to award.  When I first listened to Binaural, I wasn't impressed with its diversity and overall toned-down sound.  But I now see this as strength, maturity and the same kind of risk-taking that produced Vitalogy.  I wasn't a major Pearl Jam fan a few months ago.  But now I wouldn't miss seeing them again for the world...and being one of the first in line for their next CD.  Ignore my earlier review.  If you don't yet have Binaural, you should pick it up.  It may take a few listens to get into it, but the effort is worth it.
B00004XONN|5.0|This is probably the first musical suite I've encountered by a modern &quot;mainstream&quot; band (if Radiohead can really be called mainstream). All the tracks have a harmony to them that goes beyond common themes and similar sonic experimentation. Kid A reminds me of a suite by Bach--intricate, precisely crafted, each song belonging to the others in an integral way.<br />In tone Kid A sort of reminds me of Air without Prozac. Sort of. It's beautiful, and haunting, and just plain strange. Everything sounds as if it's being played through a thick layer of flannel with only a few exceptions like Idioteque, with its strident, frantic yet restrained beat. Some of the songs are so painful they make me want to cry, such as How To Disappear Completely. Like OK Computer, it's probably not possible to fully appreciate the whole album at first listen. I didn't even like it very much the first time--I was puzzled more than anything else--but after listening to it every day for the whole week I think it's pretty much close to perfect.<br />I think it's kind of futile to rate this album against anything else Radiohead has done; Pablo Honey can't be compared to The Bends; The Bends can't be compared with OK Computer; and OK Computer can't be compared to Kid A. In some ways Kid A seems to be a logical successor to OK Computer--it's almost as if the band took tracks like Paranoid Android and Fitter Happier and made them quieter, stranger and more dissonant--but I've listened to all three of their last albums back to back and I'm just struck by how different all of them are. I honestly can't say which ones are better than the other.<br />So those of you who loved OK Computer: RUN, don't walk, to the nearest store and get this album. Listen to it multiple times either on headphones or on a really, really good sounds system (you'll need it in order to catch all the odd aural tricks the band constantly plays). And enjoy.
B000050FEN|5.0|Seven is a very disturbing thriller about a serial killer,John Doe(Kevin Spacey), killing people via examples of the seven deadly sins - gluttony, greed, sloth, lust, pride, envy and wrath. The story begins with Detective Mills (Brad Pitt) being assigned to Detective Somerset (Morgan Freeman). Detective Somerset is due to retire at the end of the week, and Detective Mills is moving up in the world, and is to take Somerset's place. This is a very disturbing movie. It will keep you enthralled and glued to your seat for the entire 127 minutes. Indeed, I was staggered that I never once lost concentration or was bored with this movie.This is a movie with an unexpected ending that is absolutely unpredictable and which is not at all a &quot;Hollywood&quot; style ending. <br />The disc itself. The movie is presented in Anamorphic compared to the old letterbox version and this is great to see the film finally in its full glory!.The detail is quite good and crisp with very few problems (odd shimmer effect in certain scenes). The sound is recorded in Dolby Digital 5.1 which has no audio sync problems and the use of the surround mainly during rain sequences adding tone. The track was bass heavy in spots and gave the .1 channel a working. There is a number of extras on the second disk, featurettes - morgan freemans diary - directorys commentary, production notes and Star bios.   All said and done the film is one of the best, along with Silence of the Lambs, in its genre and the disc even with its faults is a qaulity purchase
6302610702|5.0|What can one say about The Godfather series? All three films were masterpieces. Classics. Part One told the tale of Vito Corleone played by Marlon Brando--the Mafia Don of a family in the 40's and 50's, which eventually is head by his son, Michael (Al Pacino) in the sequel. Part Two also tells the story of Vito as a young man in Sicily played by Robert DeNiro. In the final installment set about twenty years after the original, Michael's dreams of becoming legit are countered by his trigger-happy nephew (Andy Garcia), along with new and opposing foes that make it impossible to go straight and leave his crime backround behind. To quote Pacino: &quot;Just when I think I'm out, they pull me back in,&quot; and countless other lines will be quoted for years to come. The performances are absolutely perfect, the screenplay and direction are superb by Mario Puzo and Francis Ford Coppola. What more can I say? You must watch all three to appreciate just how great these movies are. At three hours apiece they would be great fun for a rainy day. Pop them in at 8 in the morning and by 6 you'll be a member of the family.  Part One is my favorite. Check out GoodFellas, another one of the best films of all time.
B00004TRD8|5.0|This DVD is awesome!  The sound and picture is phenomenal and it's worth every penny.  My one drawback (and I'm hoping someone can contact me at jusjams@home.com for a little help) is that the audio comes in 3 versions: Dolby Digital EX 5.1, Dolby Stereo 2 channel and finally DTS-ES which requires the decoder for the 3rd surround channel making it 6.1 channels.  I am unable to get my DVD player to play this version even though I don't have the latest set-up of 6.1 channels.  I'm told that this new format is backwards compatible with the 5.1 set-ups but it doesn't seem so with mine. Just the intro with the THX logo is enough to sell this DVD delight where you see Arnie blowing the T2 title apart and the metal starts to melt like the t-1000 and forms together as the THX logo!, but I wish I could run the DTS-ES version where the DTS logo and the CD explodes into a zillion pieces (like in the theatre runs)Mine only shows with no volume.  I still would recommend this DVD very much for all the extras and the mere fact that it's still one of the very best friggin' movies out there to date. (same level as Matrix) No regrets! Drew
B000002HRE|1.0|To call this band &quot;Metalica&quot; still is a travesty.  There is absolutely no way that the music displayed on both this album and its predecessor represent the band that most of their longtime fans loved.  Anyone who calls 'Reload' or 'Load' a &quot;musical maturity&quot; is full of it.  The music here isn't even good rock music, let alone up to the high standards of the band's past.  There is nothing whatsoever on this album that could be called listenable.  James Hetfield's vocals show that his &quot;growth as a vocalist&quot; means he now must squeal instead of screaming in key.  His ridiculous &quot;yeahs&quot; and &quot;he-he's&quot; throuhgout the songs are hilarious, at best.  'Reload' is absolutely pathetic.  The only reason that this album even sold well, is due to people either not knowing how the REAL Metallica is supposed to sound, or die-hard fans of this once great band, who will embrace anything they come out with.  The people who say that they did not sell out their style with this or 'Load' are lying to themselves.  This is not Metallica.  Those fans would listen to the group if the lyrical content consisted of James Hetfield singing his laundry list.  What happened to the thunderous drums from Lars Ulrich?  He now sounds like a 12-year old who learned how to play drums by banging his pencils on his desk in homeroom.  Remember when Kirk Hammett's guitar solos used to sing?  If he uses that wah-pedal anymore, I'd swear I was listening to a third-rate Stevie Ray Vaughan cover band.  This album is utterly sickening.  For a fair representation of what the name Metallica USED to mean, check out their 80's releases.  It seems like these four guys have absolutely no reason to rock our world anymore.  Just keep on copying yourselves, guys - We can't wait for Unforgiven III [yeah right.]
B00004XQP4|5.0|Only the mindless,hardcore,punk-loving Green Day fan will find this album diturbing and lacking. I on the other hand am a hardcore Green Day fan and I think it's Brilliant. Their really isn't a bad song on the album. It pisses me off that Rolling Stone only gave it 3/5 stars, it desreves at least a 4. Just because Green Day changes the critics have to start bashing them, and I think its stupid. I really don't see what they think is so wrong with the album.       Oh well, here are some of the standout tracks: &quot;Warning&quot; is definitely a standout track because it's a catchy song and it has a good message. &quot;Blood,Sex,and Booze&quot; is awesome because the guitar is infectious and I think a video for this song would be hilarious, I can just imagine Billie Joe being tied up to chair. &quot;Castaway&quot;'s guitar is also infectious, cool song. &quot;Macy's Day Parade&quot; is probably the only track on the album that my mom will sit through. My favorite track is definitely &quot;Waiting&quot;, all I have to say is that it better be made into a SINGLE.<br />P.S. VH1 needs to do a Behind the Music on Green Day badly!
B000002UUX|4.0|This is another one of those albums I've been talking about; half-thrash, half slow.But I like it so much because the songs I actually do like I really like. But it has a little more thrash on it than most of those type I have. In general it is awesome.
B00002MZ4W|5.0|After her debut album Tidal, a smash hit, cooled down, i was sure that Fiona Apple was a one hit wonder. But, i fear, i should stick my foot in my mouth. This album is a true masterpiece by one of todays most talented musicians. The CD starts off with the dark 'On The Bound'; skip a track and you've got the angst filled 'Limp'; next you've got the painfully beautiful 'Love Ridden,' followed by the Beatles 'White Album'-ish 'Paper Bag,' one of the album's highlights. I won't keep going on with all of the songs, but i will tell you about one: the last track, 'I Know,' the most beautiful song this year, or possibly, ever. She sings about desperate love for 4 minutes, and at the climax of the song, she sounds like she's going to break down and cry, but, oddly enough, this song has a happy ending. This is the best album i've bought this year/decade, and i guarantee you it won't disappoint.
0553062182|5.0|I found this book on the shelf of a local bookstore and the description seemed to warrant a read. Little did I know that it would revolutionize the understanding I have of myself.  <BR>Being a HSP has for me meant isolation and feelings of inferiority. This book has made me understand that I, on a very fundamental level is somewhat different from many others. Not in a superior way, nor in an inferior, just different. Gaining the insight this book gives about the nature of this difference I have realized what lies behind some of my reactions to the world that I observe and sometimes dislike. After reading the book I understand what is going on inside me and reading it has really lifted my spirits.<BR> If the description of the book just resonates a little bit with you, esteemed reader, I urge you to give it a read.
0679457313|5.0|I agree with the reader who says that this book needs to be read  asecond time in order to fully understand it. The first read usually leaves you a little confused and wondering what the entire thing was about. The story is a little disjointed and only a second pass helped me to associate the flash backs and flash forwards. But I'm glad I did. This definitely is a lot more substance than I've read in a while. People who have given up on it should definitely give it a second try.
079073804X|4.0|One of the most scary movies of all time? I would not say that, but it was a fantastic movie. I mainly enjoyed it because it was a well thought out film. Dispite the movie being great, I only gave the movie 4 stars due to there being a lot of vulger material included. By this i mean some of the lines in the script were gross and pretty much not needed. I know that the girl was possesed by the devil and of course she would use such language and experessions, but the fact of the matter is that it was discusting. However it did have its parts where you jump and it's parts where you are in suspense and terrified at the same time. I loved this movie. It is a must see.
B00004XONN|5.0|i have had enough!! why must we feel compelled to qualify and compare this to other legendary, excellent groups through out history?? should it not stand on it's own merit?? now, to answer all of those &quot;negative&quot; questions. this c.d. could have been made by a kid in a basement somewhere, and it would still be an incredible listen. it is NOT a hard listen. and to say only a couple of songs are listenable is ludicrous. do me this favor : name me how many discs that you own that you can listen to the majority of, if not the entire disc, without fast-forwarding? exactly! OK Computer, the Bends, &amp; now KidA are unquestioned in that you can listen from beginning to end. i consider a disc with 5 or more songs that are good to be a quality work. this one has at least 8. and Treefingers &amp; KidA work tremendously well within the context of the disc as a whole. Everything in its Right Place will leave your mouth open and Motion Picture Soundtrack will close it for you. this is a story put to music. the story of the 1st human clone and everything he would feel from birth to death. including the ten seconds of &quot;music&quot; found after the last track.(which is what the band thinks it would sound like as you ascend to heaven!!!) The National Anthem will jazz you, How To Disappear Completely will haunt you, Optimistic will move your soul, and Idioteque will amaze you. and the best part of this is that they sound EVEN BETTER live. don't believe me? watch SNL on the October 14th for proof. look, i am not saying go out and buy this. i bought 3 copies and i am loaning two of them to anyone who is uniniated to the band to try and give a listen, free of charge. if you don't enjoy it, great. at least you tried. that is what the band is all about. just giving your best effort for the satisfaction of yourself. so far, 14 people have listened, and they all have gone out and bought it. and not one of them had ever heard of Radiohead before. this is just like an engaging book, or a must see movie, or meeting a new friend. it is a slice of life that contains emotions and experiences that are all to rare now. so see if you can borrow a copy from a friend, and give it a fair listen. i bet you will not be disappointed. for now,i am off to disappear completely in creatvity and progression. just like radiohead has.
B00000IACG|5.0|Listening to this album now I can see that it is my favourite by Fugazi.  The mix and match compilation of all their demos leads you down the path into appreciating their later albums.  If you like Fugazi's background tracks, the music beneath the lyrics then you will love this album, watch out for 12 and 17.
0393317552|5.0|Logically, but without being pendantic, Diamond addresses the critical issue of why western culture dominates the world. Starting from the observation that the people he observes in New Zealand are no less intelligent that those in more &quot;developed&quot; cultures, he formulates his theory.  Marvelous.
B00004TL21|5.0|when i first popped this album in the cd player, i listened to the whole cd from one song to the other in amazement. this album has definately evolved and matured greatly from the earlier 2, i would say this album is the best deftones, or best album in the world EVER!!!!! the album is a little softer from the earlier 2, with songs like digital bath, and rx queen, and some heavier songs like elite, and korea, but my fave is change, definately worth the wait
B00004Z511|4.0|FACT 1 - Pablo Honey was a very strong record and those who write it off like an illegitimate first born put up for adoption to be forgotten are just snobs.<br />FACT 2 - KID A is a departure and different, but not brilliant. It just shows how scary talented this group is that they put out a fine record without mining the depths of their two most valued instruments, Thom's voice and Johnny's guitar.<br />With that out of the way, the cd kicks off with &quot;everything in it's right place&quot; which repeats a simple phrase over and over and you know what? it's catchy as hell...This cd is definitely headphone music to get lost in.<br />Motion Picture soudtrack was much better in it's originallly stripped down raw rendition that's been floating around unavailable commercially during the last couple of years. Hunt it down if you can.<br />One thing's for sure, whether you like this release or not. I just can't imagine how mecurial they will be on their next cd once they reign in the instruments and vocals. Many musicians claim that one needs to forget how to play their particular instruments (vocals included) and relearn them once again to really go to the next level that would truly define them. This cd just might their blowing off steam phase, before trekking heights rarely reached by others. Watching the &quot;meeting people is easy&quot; video, one could tell the boys haven't had the easiest couple of years since OK computer was released and annointed on many a top rock cd of ALL time lists.<br />C A U T I O N: Do not sink the xtra $ on the limited edition cd. It contains no supplemental audio or video like other cd releases. The only difference is an oversized cardboard cd case that is also a five paged &quot;book&quot; Each page has some artwork and about a sentence on each page rambling on about the melting polar ice caps. PUHHLEASE...save your money and get the regular version. Furthermore this version is roughly 3/4&quot; taller and 1/2&quot; wider than regular jewel cases, which would make it impossible for storage with normal cd's<br />B O T T O M   L I N E: This is a worthy CD by a band that obviously is either in a slight rut or just needed to deflate a bit with the pressure of being the annointed savior of Rock music by the world. Yes it's experimental and stretched a bit too thin, but still better than 90% of the pablum out there.<br />B Y  T H E  W A Y - Does anyone know what the guy lying on the sidewalk in their 1996 video says at the end of it? He was just about to tell the folks why he is kissing pavement.
B00004XONN|5.0|It's completely diffferent from OK computer (as is to be expected, as some of the tracks are about 4 years younger on this album, and 1 years more mature at the time of release) though they have a sample of that computer voice (the android?) saying something.  It sounds drunk and low tech this time, in complete contrast to the rest of the music, which is sort of cool I guess, in a high-school english way.  The entire album is mellow, with few 'songs' that could be considered chart-topping singles, in my humble opinion, however as with all R-head albums from the Bends onwards, the selection and ordering of the tracks is an integral part of the experience, and has been chosen superbly.  Jonny's string arrangements sound really cool, (they were performed in some kind of church I think), and some of the organ music is, well, just cool.  On the whole, about 5 minutes too short, could possibly have been enhanced by including an extra track or two (like 'Knives Out', a song supposedly about cannibalism), but a decent, mellow but high-tech, CD.  I think it's a whole lot better than the Smashing Pumpkins' 4th album anyway, but it won't get anywhere near as many 'album of all time' nominations that surrounded OK Computer.
B00004X01U|4.0|Yes, it's a good album.  Is it the best of the artist?  Probably not.  But then again it depends on where you're coming from and what you're looking for.<br />I've grown up with Madonna and I appreciate the fact that she's grown up too.  She's in her 40s now and I really think the age and maturity of a listener affect the response to Madonna's music.  You're not going to get the 20-something Madonna here.  If you want that, go get the older CDs and play them for awhile.  It's a bit like expecting the average 12-year-old boy to really appreciate Toni Braxton.  This is (thank goodness) not another round of kiddy-band pop/dance candy.<br />Then there's the whole electronica/dance thing.  I'm a huge fan of European music and quite irritated with what's popular on the American music scene now.  So I like what Madonna is doing for the simple reason that if it makes the stores stock that much more electronica then I'm a happy girl.  However, if you're a hardcore electronica fan, then this will probably irritate you more than please you, as Madonna will take any idea she's got and shape it for mainstream palates. And yes, Mirwais is ok but we know he's not the best of French dance let alone cutting-edge electronic music.  However, for what Madonna's doing, it's not bad.  And if you'd rather listen to heavy-duty alternative rock, why are you even surprised you don't like this stuff?<br />In the end, the dance-y tunes are fun and several of them grow on you.  The ballads (which have always been my favorite Madonna music) are good, but again, she's playing with genre here.  Yes, some of this is retro, but if one listens to Garage, or House or even some of the Jungle/Drum and Bass out there, they'd recognize that the funk/disco sounds of the 70s have crept back in to a lot of stuff and she's playing with the same sounds as other artists.<br />Give it a listen and see if your expectations are met.  I'm giving it 4 stars because I'm judging it against other current American pop standards.  Most days for pop music I'd rather listen to the new Madonna CD than a lot of other artists out there.standards.  Most days for pop music I'd rather listen to the new Madonna CD than a lot of other artists out there.
B00004XONN|4.0|Radiohead is still evolving.  Like looking at a pelican and understanding that it evolved from a dinosaur, but not seeing the transition, it is difficult to listen to Kid A, and think that this same band started with Pablo Honey.<br />Kid A as an album is difficult to put into words, since most of it is comprised of sounds that have never been heard. How can you explain the color green to someone who has never had sight?  All at once, Kid A is claustrophic and expansive, sterile and warm, frightening and reassuring.  Dark Side of the Moon aside, this might be the most successful musical interperitation of an acid trip.<br />Sorry to disappoint, but no one will understand Kid A without actually listening to it.  It is an album to be experienced.  Just the fact that so many people are talking about it (560 reviews so far) shows that people are having a hard time explaining it to eachother.  But that is a good thing in this case.  But be warned - Kid A is just as likely to alienate fans as it is to please them.  <br />It can at times be maddeningly obtuse and disconnected.  Where The Bends and OK Computer showed a guitar-and-drums band getting artsy, Kid A abandons anything similar to what can be considered rock music, but it is without a doubt a beautiful effort.  For those who are expecting another &quot;Paranoid Android&quot; or &quot;High and Dry&quot;, don't even bother with Kid A.  Radiohead has produced something that will forever be pondered and discussed, but it will sadly never get close to MTV or any other mainstream acceptance.  And that is a damn shame.<br />This might all prove to be a grand experiment since it is reported that Radiohead are already working on a more mainstream album, but Kid A will forever be with them.  Whether it's heralded as a masterpiece or an albatross around their necks remains to be seen.
015670160X|4.0|_Orlando_ is Virginia Woolf's mock biography of her friend Vita Sackville-West.  It follows the title character through English history from the Elizabethan Age to the 1920s, when the novel was written.  The writing is different sections of the book mimics the styles of different periods of English literature.  Most of the book is firmly tongue-in-cheek (Woolf can be very funny), but it does brush lightly upon issues of art, gender, and history.<br />I think _Orlando_ is the most purely entertaining of Woolf's novels.  Orlando's various adventures are highly laughable, and Woolf's dry commentary rarely fails to elicit a smile.  It is also one of Woolf's less experimental and ambitious novels.  She wrote this novel as a lark, for amusement--it is a very different project from, for example, _The Waves_.  This is not to say this is in any way a conventional novel--but it is rather different from Woolf's other works of the 1920s.<br />I would definitely recommend this to most readers--it is more accessible to the general reader than Woolf's other novels.  Readers familiar with the history of English literature will find it particularly amusing.  If you are a first-time Woolf reader looking to really experience her more important works, however, I would suggest _Mrs. Dalloway_ or _To the Lighthouse_ first.
B00003CX8J|5.0|JUST WANT TO SAY AS AN AVID X-MEN COLLECTOR FROM THE 80&quot;S AS WELL AS A BIG MOVIE BUFF THAT THIS FILM ROCKS!!! SURE, THERE ARE SOME THNGS I WOULD HAVE LIKED TO SEE, ESPECIALLY NIGHTCRAWLER, BUT I AM STILL A HAPPY GUY! WHAT A GREAT FILM! JACKMAN STEALS THE SHOW AS WOLVERINE, NO QUESTION!! AS A BIG FAN OF CAMERON FILMS I CAN SAY THIS MOVIE RANKS UP THERE WITH THE BEST  OF HIS TITLES.I HAVE ALREADY PRE-ORDERED THE DVD AND CANNOT WAIT TO ADD THIS TO MY COLLECTION. I WAS NOT DISAPPOINTED AT ALL AND ENJOYED HOW THE STORY WAS PUT TOGETHER FOR THE NON-FAN. BY FAR THE BEST COMIC-MOVIE ADDAPTION THIS FAN HAS SEEN!! CAN'T WAIT FOR THE SEQUEL!
B00004WIBW|4.0|this movie could have been expanded apon a great deal more to make it better, but seeing as how i am parcial to tim burton the movie was fantastic. i would have liked to have seen some more scenes with cristopher walken, but beggers can't be choosey.
B00003W8NM|5.0|...An outrageous claim, i know, but this is one outrageous movie. Cast away any notions that this is a gratuitously violent film - as many reviews will have you believe - and ponder on the fact that this is perhaps as much about fighting as 'Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance' is about motorcycle maintenance.   Yes, there are some rather graphic scenes of fists and blood, but this is merely one part of the complex story that makes up this sensational bit of cinema. Without going into too much detail: Ed Norton [brilliant] is having serious trouble sleeping, and this is the basis for all the mayhem that ensues.  This film ought to have you utterly absorbed by the orderly chaos that is Norton's life, which - with a generous dosing of laughter, shock, violence, and stabs at society - builds up to a mind-blowing climax. And that is the best part. The ending. Whereas with '6th Sense' the twist destroys the entire movie, here the climax is truly that. Up until the end this film is excellent. And then it becomes brilliant. Outstanding.  Watch this film the first time, and find yourself dazed, as if from a heavy right hook. Watch it a second time to check for flaws. And i think you will find there are none.<br />This DVD also contains various commentaries that make the whole experience even better.  You cannot purchase a more worthwhile DVD.
B00004TH83|5.0|Truly a vocal masterpiece!!  Europe has blessed the Americas with a godsend that is impeccably nourishing to the musical ear!  Adorned with songs that warm the heart and soul, this album is an example of the best in feminine sensuality. Lara's talent has brought her the utmost in admiration from my perspective.  Like Celine Dion, her voice resonates through the firmament of heaven like an angel.  This album is undoubtedly a must for those who crave dance energy and placid serenity!
B000002KHF|5.0|i was turned on to van morrison when i was 14, and boy this album captures truly the greatest songs that he ever recorded. i highly recommend this album verses the greatest hits.
6305648522|5.0|This film is truly a dramatic treasure in every sense.  The fact that love in any form can transcend the bounds of time is what I think dominates the plot of this movie.  Passion is absolutetly commonplace in the performances given by all the characters.  I felt a lot more in common with Toto due to the emotional fluctuation he experienced.  This film is truly a godsend in spectacular screenwork and a definite work of art indeed. One is dead if not one tear comes from watching this film!
0316777722|5.0|This is my first exposure to David Sedaris, and I'm totally impressed. His descriptions of his slightly-cracked family and friends reminded me of a less genteel James Thurber. Sedaris is original, self-deprecating, and totally engaging. I laughed out loud at some point in just about every essay. He certainly knows how to write for his audience.<br />Loved it!
B00000IL1K|3.0|This album is truly a major achievement! Sarah's voice is amazingly uplifting and full of endless passion. Peaceful is what this item is, there is no doubt. If relaxation is what one needs, here it is!
B00004XONN|5.0|It's a pity for those who don't &quot;understand&quot; that wonderful Work. Fortunately, they're not in the majority.
0783226063|5.0|What a work of art!!  The literary works of Frank Herbert finally come to life on the screen in boundless glory.  The conflict faced between the races of the Fremen, the Harkonnen, and the Padishah Emperor himself is displayed magnificently on film. Acting talent fueled from a large group of spectacular actors makes this movie a definite precursor to all of the sci-fi blockbusters of today.  The special effects and dialogue prove undoubtedly that this screenwork was far beyond its time when it was released into theatres. &quot;Dune&quot; is a must for fantasy!
B00003CWNR|5.0|I think that this movie was the greatest movie that has ever been made! i loves it so much and on the scale from 1-5 i think that it should be rated as 100!
B00004XONN|5.0|I love how everyone writes 1 star reviews of how radiohead needs to play something more &quot;traditional&quot; and even claim thom (and it is spelt with an h jackass)and radiohead are trying to make money. If you dont like the cd dont buy it, but dont pretend to be a fan who is &quot;left out in the cold&quot; because the band isnt releasing a cd over and over again that sounds just like your favorite one. This is one of the most original cds i have ever heard and obviously they make what they want because it sounds good. Go listen to britney spears, limp bizkit or eminem, i bet they arent out to make money (the only thing they make is garbage), and ill listen to radiohead, because i dont shun everything different that comes along. Listen to it with an open mind and youll like it.
B000002KO3|4.0|I Bought this a little while ago, but I was kept from hearing it until recently(it was barrowed for a while)  I brought it with me on a trip I took. And the first song,Born under punches just hooked me in for the duration of the album. This is one of the best albums that I own.
B000001FDP|5.0|...is in for a wakeup call here. Literally. This work runs the gamut between the crashing, thunderous grandeur of a Tchaikovsky or a Beethoven and the subtle magnetism of what industry pundits pretentiously call &quot;world music&quot;. Movement 1 has the scurrying arpeggiation reminsicent of &quot;Blade Runner&quot;. Movement 3 has an emphatic alternation of choral chords and tympani thunder (&quot;awww&quot;...CRASH!...&quot;awww&quot;...CRASH!...) in the main body of the passage (knowing Vangelis, the choir and tympani are real). Movement 4 has a vocal solo chant over some melodic percussion that sounds to me like a cross between marimbas and Carribean steel drums (so who says Bartok had a monopoly on folk roots, and who says you can only draw on Old World sources?). This is where Vangelis' strength lies--being able to draw on sounds usually found in various eras of what is now called &quot;techno&quot; and fusing them with Classical influences. And unlike most &quot;synth players&quot;, Vangelis uses traditional instruments when they'll either enrich the tonal color or electronics just won't provide the timbres he needs (as far as I know. you still can't do tympani on a sampler). Don't forget what the main instrument was in the main theme to &quot;Chariots Of Fire&quot;--the grand piano. Anybody looking for the soporific sound of New Age (which is valid enough in its own context) will find this one-man Philharmonic either a rude awakening or a breath of fresh air. Consider what you're looking for before you buy. For my own part, his name is enough to make me add it to my Shopping Cart. I can't say that about all that many artists.
6305903182|5.0|SCREAM 3 is the best slasher film of the year. It deliver's everything you want in a good slasher film. Neve Campbell gives her best performance ever in this movie as Sidney Prescott. The movie is a movie within a movie. While Sidney is living a little more happier life in her hide out house, STAB 3: Return To Woodsburo is filming. But as the cast members start to mysteriously die, Sidney and fellow survivor's and friends, Dewey Riley and Gayle Weathers, must face the terrible murder's that have haunted them one last time. Directed by Wes Craven with a really terrific cast, SCREAM 3 is the best scary slasher film of the year. I recomend you buy it on DVD or VHS right now! IT'S GREAT! That's why I give this movie 5 STARS.
B00004X01U|5.0|Madonna is constantly blowing me away by how much she changes and how much more I like her each time she does. Back in the eighties Madonna never really impressed me with her cheezy pop anthems such as &quot;Like A Virgin&quot;, and &quot;Like A Prayer&quot;. When Madonna released her Erotica album, and the sex book, I was sure that her career was over. However, she surprised me by releasing the ballad &quot;Rain&quot;, and the album &quot;Bedtime Stories&quot;. I had a little more respect for her then, but never really liked her music until the groundbreaking &quot;Ray of Light&quot;. From upbeat techno/pop songs (Ray of Light, Skin, Nothing Really Matters) to beautiful emotive ballads, (Power of Good-bye, Frozen, To Have Not To Hold)her then new sound blew me away. The shimmering electronic backdrops provided by William Orbit also added to the depth of the album. So of course, I patiently counted the days until Madonna's present album, &quot;Music&quot;.       The only negative thing I have to say about Madonna's new album is, why did she have to completely change her look. Couldn't she have thrown in one more Orbit ballad for the heck of it? Oh well. The result of Madonna's new album is more a reminder of what Madonna was about in the eighties. (Without the cheezy pop that is!) Madonna's new album is very fun and watered down, dance oriented, and overall a good morphing choice for Madonna, except for the folky country songs &quot;I deserve it&quot;, and &quot;Gone&quot;. &quot;Don't tell me&quot;, isn't that great either. However, the rest of the album is filled with club oriented songs that have simple, yet catchy lyrics. The title track &quot;Music&quot; is a perfect dance song, and from it's funky rythmic beat to the hip vocoder line &quot;Do you like to boogie woogie&quot;, to the great instrumentals provided by Mirwais Ahmadzai, it's probably the best song on the album. The next best song is &quot;Amazing&quot;. Produced by William Orbit, this song is basically a recapitulation of the hit single &quot;Beautiful Stranger&quot;, but a little bit funner and with better, more dancable rythm. . The sexy, soft song &quot;What it feels like for a girl&quot; is one of the surprising fun parts of the album. It sounds very European from the clip in the front to the almost Eurodance beat, to the simple, honest lyrics. &quot;Impressive Instant&quot; is another highlight of the album. From the vocoder line &quot;I'm in a trance&quot; to the almost discoey rythm, it's lot's of fun. I think this beats Madonna's &quot;Ray of Light&quot; album, but how can one compare. It's a great new look for Madonna, and her sound is wonderful. My only advise for Madonna is to try to include William Orbit more on her next album. He's one of the best career moves she's ever made. Madonna is a great singer/songwriter, and this is only the beginning. With great artists like her out, how can music help but get better. Much to look forward to, Go Madonna!

6304140711|5.0|This movie is the best, i enjoyed it so much, it was a little scary, but mark is so hot. I think he should make more movies like this one.
B000002B35|5.0|When I first saw &quot;Pulse&quot; in stores I thought it was a greatest hits album released so that the remaining Pink members could make one last cash grab.  Was I mistaken.  The live &quot;Pulse&quot; album consists of the entire &quot;Dark Side Of The Moon&quot; album along with some of the best cuts from &quot;The Wall&quot; and &quot;Wish You Were Here&quot;.  It also includes excellent selections from post-Waters albums, &quot;A Momentary Lapse Of Reason&quot; and &quot;The Division Bell&quot;.  Another aspect that makes this album even more complete is the appearence of Astronomy Domine from their debut album, &quot;Piper At The Gates Of Dawn&quot;.   Overall, Gilmour and company belt out great versions of Pink classics with &quot;random precision&quot; and prove they still have what got them called &quot;the best conceptual album writers of all time and one of the top three bands in history&quot;.  The choice cuts would definitely have to be Comfotably Numb, Wish You Were Here, Run Like Hell, Brain Damage, Eclipse and from the 1994 &quot;Division Bell&quot; album High Hopes.  As an added bonus, the two CD set comes in a deluxe slipcase package with an extensive booklet complete with tour pictures, equipment and track listings.  An absolute must.  Listen and you will understand why.
B00003CWNR|5.0|i haven't read the book yet -- reading the book first always ruins the movie, but for me, the movie was magical and the characters were so real to me.  this will be the first movie i ever buy.
B00004XONN|5.0|When listening to this CD, one has in the first place to accept that this is not &quot;Ok Computer&quot;. A work this complex and different should be handled with pure objectivism, totally free of expectations. I got into Radiohead after listening to OKC several times and I was quite sure such a compelling work would be impossible to repeat. And I think so were Radiohead themselves. Anyway they progressed but not in the way one would have expected (or it seems, in some case wished). Kid A is different, original and complex enough to maintain interest. The songs are very varied and contain lots of wonderful ideas and atmospheres. Only thing that bugs me with this album is that at some points Radiohead seem to be trying too hard to be &quot;creative&quot;. When a part starts to sound like &quot;ordinary&quot; pop-music, they distort it somehow. In some cases, this works, sometimes it sounds a bit pretentious. This is a record for people who love the music not the band.
B00004TFK3|5.0|This movie is everything a DVD was meant to be. When I first saw the pricetag on the limited edition of Men In Black, I was somewhat suprised at the cost. After all, it was a little steep. But having some extra cash, I decided to splurge. When I popped each dvd (There's Two) into my player, I quickly decided it was well worth the money. The sound and picture quality are superb, and the extras are mind boggling. The second disk, which is dedicated solely to extras, freatures several deleted scenes, a unique storyboard to movie comparison, a comprehensive look at the deconstruction of two key scenes in the movie, and so much more. And lets not forget about the free conceptual drawing and supplemental booklet, both included in the box set. As for the first disk, it includes the movie itself, along with a visual commentary by Tommy Lee Jones and director Barry Sonnenfeld. Trust me, if you have the cash, you wont regret adding this movie to your collection.
B00000FZQ8|5.0|This movie came out when I was 16, around the time of the first &quot;Earth Day&quot; at school.  It is a wonderful example of how everyone felt at the time - that our resources were dwindling, being squandered, and that there might be nothing left for our childrens' children.  The sound track by Joan Baez is WONDERFUL, and Bruce Dern plays his part quite well.<br />I logged on tonight in the hopes that I could buy this movie, because of the strong nostalgic feelings I have for it.  I can't believe the price, and will buy it as soon as I finish this line.  Thanks.
B00004XONN|2.0|I'm an avid Radiohead fan. Until now its been hard to find fault with the band that singlehandedly reinvented the guitar, has a one-in-a-million lead singer, and sings some of the most poignantly beautiful songs I've ever heard.<br />So what's wrong with this album?  For one, the band clearly believed too much of its own press.  In an effort to break new ground and bring us the latest greatest concept, they apparently forgot what they really are: Pop musicians.  Great pop musicians. <br />There are plenty of great vintage synth sounds on this album -- but there's a little too much exploring, and not enough basic songwriting.  What has always drawn me to Radiohead is that in their explorations of new musical territory they still manage to pull out some incredible pop.  But not this time...  <br />Radiohead needs to head back to the studio and work hard to remind us that they can still write songs.  And that they can rock.
B00000I8DY|5.0|Reading the reviews below I was a little disappointed to find so few mentions of Graciela Oddone, who is the absolutely marvelous Despina here.  This was my first Cosi, and during the 3-hour marathon I found myself turning to stare at my CD-player whenever Graciela came on.  She goes to extraordinary lengths to express the character!  The cackle of the Despina-notary is nothing like the usual fare the conventional listener is used to (of course, when she is Despina proper she sings great, too, with just the right amount of sass).  Everything about this recording is wonderful, but it is Graciela above all who reminds you of the FUN!  Bravissima!!!
6304595247|5.0|Of all the movies I own from the 16th to 19th century eras, this is without question, my favorite.  I love it so much I have seen it at least a dozen times and I'll watch it several dozen more times and never tire of it.  The music is so hauntingly beautiful, and the scenery magnificent.  Everyone I've loaned it to returns it to me saying &quot;I have a new favorite movie...&quot;  I highly recommend purchasing this movie.  It's worth every penny.
B00004YC2F|5.0|I couldn't disagree more with the other two reviewers.  This IS the best.  I just listened to Horowitz and Volodos back-to-back, and to make sure, I listened to both third movements again.  The Horowitz is muddy and passionless next to the Volodos.  Also the sound quality is at least twice as good on the Volodos version.  Surely the other listeners have not really compared the two.
0792842731|5.0|Goldeneye put the whole series in jeopardy--not enough 007 theme music coupled with the action. This movie restores the artistry of music/action and Brosnan arrives as 007.<br />The Terri Hatcher/Brosnan chemistry ignites the screen and almost takes away the movie's focus, what does Brosnan like about BITING his women, anyone else notice this?<br />It was sad to see Hatcher's Paris go, but it makes you feel no mercy for the villain, who you can't wait to get his just deserts! The action scenes are awesome as Bond and his Chinese operative close in on the madman, culminating in a gun battle on a stealth ship employing realistic weaponry.<br />The ultimate Bond movie question is would you watch it again, I could watch this movie with its haunting Sheryl Crow theme song, lovely Terri Hatcher, the non-stop action again and again.
B00003CXHJ|4.0|The reviews you will read below are perfectly divided between those who cant make movies and those that can.  Every complaint is from a non-american who, without our support During WWI and II and for the last 50+ years would be living under one form of German regime or another... it is shocking how none of these countries can produce an ounce of entertainment, but find the time to criticize US efforts at drama, action and suspense.  MOVIES ARE FOR ENTERTAINMENT...  Non-fiction Books, Classrooms etc are for the re-telling of history...  for the poor slob below who didnt like Saving Private Ryan, please just stay in your house and thank the US your not a prisoner of war, of fascism, or of communism...  THIS MOVIE IS ENTERTAINING, and someday, when those sad little countries are allowed to import DVD players with DTS sound, they will realize what a spectacular creation this is... Should any of these actors be compared to the likes of Shakespears finest, of course not...  is it better than watching a 3 hour 1-0 soccer match... ANY DAY OF THE WEEK...
B00004XONN|1.0|If you're thinking about purchasing this album, just keep in mind that a great band can put out an astoundingly mediocre record. Unfortunately, that's not the case here, since the record is worse than mediocre, and the great band was nowhere to be heard--all I heard was a bunch of synthesizers. Also take into consideration that you don't need crunchy hooks to make a record, but after this one, I'm beginning to think that in order to be listenable, they may be a necessary evil. Let people tell you you're not a real music fan, and that you don't appreciate the subtle genius that is displayed here, and then take your money and buy something with a melody. All I have to say about this album is caveat emptor. I'll keep listening to it for the time being only because, now that I bought it, I'm going to milk it for every penny it's worth. And after I get my nickel out of it, I'll...well, I'll let you know when I'm done--it'll take a while.
B000002572|5.0|Boston is the best!  This CD or any other Boston CD has the highest standard of technology and musical artistry, unlike crap like caveman sounding, musical sell-outs, Metallica.  I have been a Boston fan since 1976. This CD is their best (with Brad Delp).
B00004SCX6|5.0|This cd is the best, I'll admit, she isnt the best singer in pop this days(comparing to christina) but, i dont really pay attention to that. I pay attention to the songs, and all of them are great. You wont be dissapointed with any song, and if you dont like it at first, youll learn to love it. Britney to me, is still the best!  And damn is she sexy!  well, maybe that wont help people decide if they want to buy it...yeah right!
B000001DTM|5.0|Everybody knows about One,Mysterious Ways and all the big hits on this stunning work,but do yourself a favour and focus on the less famous tracks,since the real magic of the record is to be found in hidden pearls such as So Cruel,Acrobat,Ultra Violet,Love is Blindness....this album is so good there really isn't a way to review it without praising it,you've got to have a heart of stone and no blood running in your veins to remain indifferent. And one very important thing:even if you don't like U2,you will love this one because it's absolutely uncomparable with any other thing they've ever done. People tend to consider Zooropa and Pop as strictly related to Achtung Baby,yet the truth is that there's an artistic and inspirational abyss between this masterpiece and the following works. The Joshua Tree and The Unforgettable Fire may come close to  this one,but TJT had less powerful lyrics while TUF was a sort of work in progress. Achtung Baby....if every record were as good as this one!
B00004Z511|1.0|I must begin this review by stating that I love this band immensely. The Bends and OK Computer were absolutely phenomenal albums, musically and lyrically, and they deserved all the critical acclaim they received. That being said, the new album, Kid A, is disastrously pathetic. It is monotonous and droning, with sparse and unfulfilling vocals, excruciatingly dissonant chord progressions, and forced irregular rhythyms. Gone is the experimental yet accessible beauty of the last two studio albums. Gone is the subtlety, the complexity and the variety that make this band so rewarding to listen to. Kid A picks up where Blur's 13 left off: too many effects, noises, and lengthy awkward grooves, and not enough substance.  This album is all form and no content. It begins with three forgettable songs that each ramble 4 minutes too long. Next comes &quot;How to Disappear Completely,&quot; the first sign of life---unfortunately, the monotony and poor vocal phrasing keep this song from being anything other than decent. Then there is &quot;Optimistic,&quot; one of only two stand-out songs on Kid A, the other being the closer, &quot;Motion Picture Soundtrack.&quot; The only other song that is mildly interesting is &quot;Idioteque,&quot; if only for the inventive accapella harmonies. Every song seems like it should have been an intro, an outro, or a short bridge. Instead, they take these unimaginitive progressions/rhythyms/musical phrases and build musical landscapes out of them. And I don't care who the producer is, no amount of effects, samples or interesting noises can turn bad music into good music---you have to start with something substantial and let the experimental nuances be the window dressing. You cannot become so absorbed in experimentalism that you neglect the aspects of music that caused you to fall in love it. I know this album will be labeled as genius, as a litmus test for &quot;true&quot; radiohead fans, but this album is neither---it is boring and sloppy, full of musical ideas that should have been left on the cutting room floor. Anyone who heralds it as brilliant is either (1) such a blind fan that they would heap praise upon anything the band released, (2) one who enjoys atonality, dissonance, and monotony, and accept them as criteria for brilliance, or (3) lying. I still love this band, I still belive in this band, and I will still buy every album this band produces, but I cannot praise this album. I do not want to hear OK Computer sequels for the rest of my life, but I do want to hear a talented band reach their potential once more. Years from now, this album will be looked at as the lone disappointment in a string of beautiful, imaginitive works preceding and following it. I know their next major work will be evrything it can and should be.
B00004SCX6|4.0|Tracks 1, 2, 6, 7, 8, and 10 are wonderful.  I can't wait till her next album debuts.
0553284347|5.0|I just got this book this weekend, and it was a soul-searching weekend. I ran away at 19, after the emotional and physical abuse, from a father and stepmother, and having to raise two younger siblings. I have struggled with nightmares, bad relationships, alcohol, and six years ago, thoughts of ending my life which resulted in me being on the wrong side of razor blade, and having to be in a hospital. I've since been treated for Panic Disorder, and take medication...but I didn't know where to go from just taking meds. This book, although my dreams were graphic, got me started writing out in letter form all the garbage I've been carrying. And it feels good, although intense. I'm not finished...I can answer yes to all but one of Dr. Forward's questions, under the anger section, so I've got a ways to go...but, I offer thanks for her writing this book. My emotions have either been locked up, or explosive, and I want to be free of this emotional battleground/tightrope I've been walking for 36 years.
B000024A70|5.0|As an owner of both this version and several others, I gotta point out the differences.  This is a very good compilation, however, I can't validate paying import price for a compilation that can be attained at a domestic price. The track listing on this version is IDENTICAL to disc one of the two disc &quot;Gold Collection&quot; available in the US on the Hollywood label. (For about the same price, you also get Greatest Hits II with the gold package.)
0446608955|5.0|I've read all of Sparks' novels except The Rescue, and I have to say, this one is superb!  I really enjoy his books, but this one left me with a smile, and a warmth that differed from the rest.  If you want a book to make you feel young again, a book that makes you remember what its like to be new to love, this one will do it.  I'm looking forward to reading The Rescue!
0812567110|3.0|this book was really really twisted, our sophmore class had to read it for school, and almost everyone hated it
1572522232|5.0|You don't see great horror flicks like this anymore,(what a shame.) I saw this film on cable a while back and I found it to be a visually interesting yet creepy film. Yes, I have to admit that the plot is a little bit ridiclous, but fortunatly the scenery and whatever style Argento uses takes away from that. What I found visually mesmerizing was how red lighting was used in each scene. He has re-released some of his other classics uncut, uncensored and fully restored. I hope he will do the same for Suspiria soon. So if you are looking for a obscure, stylish 70's horror film, Suspiria is the one to see, (plus many of his others.)
B00000JCB2|1.0|Their first album was ok and showed some potential. But then they decided to kiss up to MTV and become rock's version of N'SYNC. On this album, you can tell that Fred Durst and buddies are very limited musically, all you hear is crap mixed with very weak rock. The reason why these guys are popular is because they write safe, conforming, uncreative songs that appeal to MTV's mindless teenybopper audience. The only good thing about this band is that they won't be around when the crap-rock fad dies in a few years.<br />If you like c-rap then, you might like this album, but if you like real rock or metal, then stay away from this.
B00003CXGG|5.0|This is an amazing film, just think of the matrix fighting and wirework but with an amazing proper martial arts guy (Jet Li who is amazing).
0425163407|4.0|This is a well paced continuation of the Scarpetta legacy.  It is not my favorite in the series, but it is another page turner for Cornwell.  Captivating with vivid imagery and solid character backgrounds. In my opinion, another hit for Cornwell.
0876855575|5.0|Having read nearly every word the man wrote (in his published career), I would agree wholly with the other reviewers who suggest that this is his best novel.<br />Some describe Bukowski as being unnecessarily crude. Personally, I feel that his &quot;crudeness&quot; is merely the most efficient vehicle of expression. In this respect, and many others, I consider Bukowski to be the most successful American author in history. <br />I have often felt insulted by his writing, but it has never insulted my intelligence with needless passive voice metaphors.
B00004XONN|5.0|There are few bands that can touch Radiohead. With each cd, Radiohead has set new standards in engineering, arranging, singing, playing and producing music. &quot;Kid A&quot; sounds something like you'd hear 100 years from now or while your shuttle is taking off into space. Or it could be the background music for a mortuary, something haunting, something you'd hear in the afterlife. This time out, the band experiements with synthesizers more than guitars, with song form and structure. The subject matter is entirely Radiohead's: alienation. There are excellent songs here like &quot;Everything In Its Right Place&quot;, &quot;Kid A&quot;, &quot;How To Disappear Completely&quot;, &quot;Idioteque&quot; and &quot;Motion Picture Soundtrack&quot;--which this cd could also double for. Not a note goes wasted, for the most part, on &quot;Kid A&quot; except for the song &quot;The National Anthem&quot; which doesn't sound like it quite fits into the song cycle. I look forward to hearing how this band will metamorphosize in the coming years.
0446677450|5.0|I was amazed that a book this highly tauted provided such invaluable insights.  Some of Kiyosaki's lessons I learned the hard way.  Other principles I've already implemented and profited from.  Between this book, and Katz's &quot;Encyclopedia of Trading Strategies,&quot; I feel more confident in my financial future than ever.
0679879269|5.0|THe Amber Spyglass was far better than my expectations.  I first read the Sally Lockhart books over 2 years ago and then read THe golden Compass.  THe Subtle Knife was much better than The Golden Compass.  After reading the Amber Spyglass, I can truthfully say it is the best of the 3.  It is well written and has a good, but sad, ending
B00000JGHM|4.0|Okay.. now the technical details reviewer gave the picture 5 out of 5 but one of the technical details reviewers gave Highlander 3.5 out of 5 when it is easily worse than a 3rd generation VHS tape. So I don't know what's wrong with the technical details reviews, but they are incorrect.<br />Anyhow.. the movie is fantastic.  There are almost no extras (3 trailers), but the picture quality is pretty good except for the really high black level. I can't actually adjust my set low enough that the 'black' doesn't look like dark brown.  Other than that, there are no motion artifacts that I could see except for some shimmering in very dark textures (because of that bad black level).  otherwise..
B00004UEDQ|5.0|This film has it all, it is funny, it is sad, it teaches a lesson but makes it barable with a great and hilarious cast. Its a movie about the sad but true lessons we learn in life as we meet different people and make or break the friendships that may last forever or just 28 days. I must say i was a little dissapointed in the ending, but the scene with the soap opra guy really loosened everyone up with one last laugh. Excellent job by Sandra Bullock, the guy playing her boyfriend could have used a bit more realism, are some people really that stupid? I guess I shouldnt ask that. This movie makes an instant classic, you can watch it with anyone and everyone and not worry about what youll see or hear, well, except every time the elevator opens, just put your hand over the kids eyes like on the rating poster for pg-13 movies. Some scenes may be a bit much for kids under 13 hince the fact its pg-13 so be ware (dont say I didnt warn you). Anyway, I plan on buying this on DVD very soon, I cant wait to play with all the cool extras.
B00003CXE7|5.0|Gladiator is a marvelous movie.  It gives you a sense of what it may have been like during these Roman times.  The story is, of course, fiction.  Maximus, quite possibly the greatest character created for the big screen, was made up and history was &quot;re-written&quot; for the sake of telling this story.  Ridley Scott has never denied that and has said that all along.  That aside, this movie is a must for people of all ages to watch and enjoy.  Movies like this are what get people excited for our world's history.  You'll be looking up these characters in books and online after watching the actors give such great performances as them.  I wish I could have seen this movie while in school.  It may've peaked my interest more in History:)
B00003CXHJ|4.0|Absolutley a fabulous movie. Awsome. I was gripped to the edge of my seat the entire time. The great thing about it is that it has a lot of action, but also has an exceptable story line. Easy to watch, and A whole lot of fun, It was just a great movie, and I honestly cannot wait until the DVD comes out. It was well scripted, thought out, acted, and put together. There's no Enigma here, U-571 is flat out, a great movie!
B00004XONN|5.0|I've never listened to a ton of Radiohead-- more out of ignorence than intent-- but bought this album under the belief that I had to understand the kind of hype that has began to surround this group during the course of the past couple of years....<br />I'd listened... and been captivated... by 'Creep'. I've never heard 'The Bends' or even 'OK, Computer': if you read reviews of either of these CDs, you'd think that this music is some kind of artistic second coming. And the surprise might just be that it is....<br />I'm not going to get into any kind of artistic lineage or heavy duty comparison or anything else; perhaps the music owes a lot to Brian Eno and Aphex Twin in his 'Selected Ambient Works vol. 2' era stuff. In the same sense, it owes a lot to Pink Floyd and Sonic Youth and the muses and gods that cause artists to forgo the gods of gold and girls for the sake of some kind of artistic creation.... I resent the reviewer who claimed that this stuff is less impressive than the works of Philip Glass and Terry Reily: that stuff is good; it's old, this is new.... and it sprouted from the overwrought art-music mathematical frames of twelve-tone and atonal composers whereas this sprouted from more punk-ish stuff (and some of the more heady electronic stuff...)<br />This is a good CD that gets better listen after listen; it might be the sound of our generation; it might be brilliant; it might be pretentious (somewhat) but it's definately worth the whatever Amazon is charging to listen for yourself and find out. Get this CD.....<br />Some other odd stuff that this reminds me of: DJ Spooky vs. Scanner 'The Quick and the Dead'; the Aphex Twin that I mentioned above; and Unit's 'The Narcoleptic Symphony'... People who are into Radiohead because it is good and experimental might like this stuff... and give it the slightly wider audience that it deserves....
B00004WKII|5.0|I just finished reading the other reviews from 'fans' of Hendrix. To me the whole point of this boxed set is found on the fourth CD where you find the astounding 'Hey Baby/In From the Storm' performed live in Hawaii. I first saw this on TV in 1970 and it was released as part of the Rainbow Bridge video/film but never on record. I have been waiting 30 years for this track. It is a great reminder of his last creativity and as far as I know the only time he played these two songs merged into one.<br />SO GO OUT AND BUY THIS BOXED SET FOR THIS ONE TRACK- IT'S WELL WORTH IT. PS. Why didn't you other guys mention it ??
0446310786|5.0|Like a lot of people, I originally read this novel in high school. It's considered a 'classic' and a book that young people should read before college. It is both of those things, but it is also an excellent novel to read for pleasure.<br />The story takes place in Maycomb, Alabama during the 1930's. A time and place very alien to most of us in the modern world. At the center of the story is Scout, a fiesty young tomboy, just old enough to go to school. She has an older brother, Jem, and the two of them get into all sorts of scrapes. They enjoy play-acting and spinning scary tales about the spooky town recluse, Boo Radley.<br />The other plot strand involves their father, Atticus Finch, who is the town lawyer. Atticus is called upon to defend an African-American man who has been accused of raping a white woman. The reader can imagine the climate of the town towards African-Americans at that time. The town is rampant with racism, and Atticus has his work cut out for him. Not because the accused is guilty, but because it's likely that the 12 white men sitting on the jury will convict him even if he's innocent.<br />Lee's mastery is shown when the two plot strands come together in a spectacular way, resulting in danger for the Finch family and the man Atticus has sworn to defend.<br />Sadly, this Pulitzer Prize winner was the only novel Lee ever wrote.
0811826848|5.0|The book was so heavy, I barely got it into the car and house.   BUT, was it worth all of the lugging. (I'll return the cart tomorrow, if you don't mind.)  As a Beatle fanatic since 1964, I have looked forward to a book like this for a long time...and the wait (weight? - 6 lbs. +) was worth it. I've just paged through it so far to see the layout and to get the &quot;lay of the land&quot;, and am glad to see so many previously unpublished and unavailable photos and rememberences.  I also like that the interviews have been placed in chronological order, not in some random fashion that have made other books about the Beatles so difficult to follow.  Well, gotta go begin my reading, and I'll try to update again when I get through it.  One word of caution...If you read in bed and fall asleep with the book on your lap while lying down, you better hope it doesn't hit you in the head...You may never wake up again!  Enjoy!!
0380002930|5.0|This book is entirely about and told from the point of view of rabbits. Don't laugh, it's definitely more than I bargained for when I first picked it up. A group of rabbits is evicted from their warren and must find a new home. Traveling is not easy for rabbits because they are so skittish and nervous. In their travels, this troupe of rabbits discover many different types of warrens, all which resemble familiar types of governments (democratic, communist, and dictatorship). They have to traverse all of them, avoid their pitfalls and even fight for their lives. The groups of rabbits have their own legends and moral tales that they pass on from generation to generation by word of mouth. This novel was also made into an animated feature of the same name, though it's definitely not for children. The cute 'lil bunnies can be vicious and brutal to each other (many parents may have made the mistake of bringing their kids to the animated feature when it was first released) and some bloody scenes are included. It may sound weird, but this classic novel is one everyone should read.
B00000JCOV|3.0|After hearing lead singer Corey on love line, I expected big things from slipknot. This guy came off as very intelligent and very pissed off. Well, one part of that was right. This is music created by a few talented muscicians who have a lot to say but absolutely NO idea how to say it. The music is wonderfully hard. I could go without the turntables but I can manage listening to them. The lyrics are another story. These lyrics sound like something an angry fourth grader would write. They are terrible. Their only virtue is that they go well with the music. However, they say NOTHING and do not hold my interest for long. Anger and agression are good if used properly, on this album it unfortunately isn't. If the members of Slipknot are reading, keep up the good music but find what you want to say and then say it well.
B000003CKH|4.0|I like Cake because they found their sound. All of the songs start with a scratchy guitar, the singer starts in (oh yeah... uh-huh....), there's a trumpet solo and the song ends. And it works for them. There's about three covers of other bands songs, which is a shame because Cake writes some good lyrics. But still, you can't help but the admire the unlikely pairing of Cake with Gloria Gaynor's &quot;I Will Survive.&quot; As for Cake-written songs, there's three original songs about cars, &quot;Stickshifts and Safetybelts&quot; being strangely romantic.<br />Cake sounds like an old 50's rock band, to me, at least. They keep up that sound until you come to &quot;Nugget&quot; where the lead singer swears at you relentlessly. This is a good record. There's nothing bad to point out, just that the songs don't get really great. They can reach a certain level and they just stay there. But it's fun place to stay.
B00004TRD8|5.0|Anyone that thinks it's hard to distinguish between Dolby Digital and DTS is in need of a hearing check and this DVD proves it! I've owned and enjoyed the previous DD release but it never came close in terms of accuracy and punch that the DTS edition provides. If you have the right equipment, compare the beginning battle scene when a terminator is walking into the picture from the right, blasting away at everything in sight and suddenly turns to fire at the audience. It's good with DD but you'll want to duck and avoid serious head trauma with the DTS version! And that's just one example of countless kidney-jarring scenes. I personally can't wait until more Sci-fi films are released in DTS! Incredible!
B00003CWL6|5.0|I knew I'd love this film when I read the script and saw the trailer. It is just one of those films which inspires me. As for the DVD, well it just makes things better. Kevin Spacey just looks so damn good.<br />All of the bonus material is better than you could imagine, even my friend Tony was impressed.<br />I wish I could direct movies like this, I was once in a movie and I like to think of myself as a young Mel Gibson. Who knows maybe someday people will be reviewing a movie of mine.<br />cheers. A.

B000002BE9|1.0|Everyone is like Fiona this and Fiona that. No offense to the girl, but her songs are boring and repetative, I thought there was a mistake. Maybe her other albums are better, but I was truly disappointed. One hit wonder. yeah I wonder allright. GOod nite
B00004XONN|5.0|it's funny to read reviews of artists' works by people other than the artists. yes, i suppose that sometimes the artist is the worst assessor of his or her own work (see bob dylan) but where do we, as fans, get this idea that artists (such as radiohead in this particular instance) create because of us, or primarily, for us? how are so many people disappointed that a work of art (again, specifically using the example of KID A) does not live up to their expectations? it is terribly selfish to think that radiohead made this album specifically for you. a work of art, if it is a REAL work of art, is not created for anyone but the artist himself/herself. and some might even take that statement a step further and say that is not created for anything but for the sake of ART itself. i guess i had hoped that people who call themselves radiohead &quot;fans&quot; would have understood this concept.<br />we are lucky to be given the chance to hear such a thing as a new album by a group of musicians - a group of musicians who most of us writing these &quot;reviews&quot; have come to enjoy, respect, etc. we should appreciate that and not take it personally when we are &quot;let down&quot; by what we think is &quot;sub-par radiohead&quot; or &quot;too-weird radiohead&quot; or &quot;not-enough-guitar radiohead.&quot; <br />but i can hear the argument then being raised that if radiohead are artists that need to create &quot;art,&quot; why release it and thus make us pay to hear it? well, everyone must make money to live, ya know. if they were working in factories, they most likely wouldn't have time to make their music. and no one is holding a gun to our heads, making us buy anything (i hope). so i am lucky and thank you, radiohead, and i have been moved by this album but if i wasn't moved by this album, i would not hold it personally against you (or feel the need to tell you what you need to better on your next album).
B00001R3GF|5.0|The Stones have always been adept at putting their own touch on different musical styles.  When they first started out, they played their version of Chicago R&amp;B and they went on to explore the sounds of country, blues &amp; reggae among others.  When Some Girls was released in 1978, disco and punk were the new musical stylings and the album contains the band's attempts at those genres.  As usual, the Stones were able to employ musical elements from those styles and make it sound all their own.  From the opening of the discoized number hit of &quot;Miss You&quot; to the closing of the frenzied punk of &quot;Shattered&quot;, the Stones bounce around the musical map. You get strong punk influenced rockers like &quot;When The Whip Comes Down&quot;, &quot;Respectable&quot; &amp; &quot;Lies&quot; to the goofy country of &quot;Faraway Eyes&quot; to the midtempo of &quot;Beast Of Burden&quot; &amp; &quot;Some Girls&quot;.  They transform the Temptations' &quot;Just My Imagination&quot; from the original ballad to a ripping rocker.  Some Girls is the last album by the Stones that goes from beginning to end without a throwaway track.  They went on to release some very good albums after this one, but this was their last truly great one.
B00004BZ16|5.0|this may turn you off originally, but you will discover that it is an astonishing album- more challenging than london calling but possibly even better. this was the third clash album i bought. the first was london calling, the second combat rock. having bought this, i bought the debut and rope, then the others. i am often glad that i did not buy this or combat rock as my first clash album.
B0000028SR|4.0|After a five year hiatus from releasing albums, Bruce Springsteen came back with two simultaneous releases, his first without the E Street Band (with the exception of Roy Bittan).  The fact that he recorded these songs with hired studio musicians make them easy targets for his hardcore fans.  Human Touch is the more commercial of the two and there is some high quality music on it.  The title track is a strong song with some of the best guitar work Bruce has ever recorded while &quot;Real World&quot; has all the anthemic qualities of classic Springsteen songs.  Bruce goes back to his old Asbury Park days with the soul influenced &quot;Man's Job&quot; &amp; the superb &quot;I Wish I Were Blind&quot; which has backing vocals by one of the masters of blue-eyed soul, Bobby Hatfield of the Righteous Brothers.  The problem with the album is that for the first time in his career, Bruce has some stinkers on it.  &quot;57 Channels&quot; is a bad attempt at social commentary which is usually his forte, &quot;All Or Nothin' At All&quot; has no feeling to it and &quot;Real Man&quot; might possibly be the worst song he has ever recorded.  The missteps aside, this album is still better than 90% of the music that is released and any music by Springsteen is better than no music by him.
B00004XONN|3.0|This sounds more like a band working out its artistic excesses, or trying recklessly to adapt to the world that surrounds it, rather than focusing on creating a good album.  Its almost feels like a trademark transition album, but a transition to what?<br />Someone [wisely] mentioned Talk Talk before, there's a band that took its radio-friendly dance-pop and really forged new ground.  But they put out their last album in 1991.   When I heard the tale of Thom Yorke spending 373 days to make a track that didn't even make the final album cut, I was reminded of Mark Hollis bringing in a full choir, at great expense to the record company, recording two days worth of singing and then ultimately cutting it all.  Those are the kinds of &quot;mad artist&quot; tales that send me running to the record store, although more often than not I am rewarded with dubious cuts like &quot;Motion Picture Soundtrack&quot; with its ridiculous harp swatches and heavenly pretentions.  (&quot;Let Down&quot; from _OK Computer_ was far more beautiful of a track than this, and it didn't sound like they were nearly trying as hard.)<br />Please ignore the press, which is automatically going to throw the words &quot;brilliant&quot; and &quot;groundbreaking&quot; no matter what pap Radiohead might put out, and try to judge the album on its own merits.  I absolutely love the first track &quot;Everything In Its Right Place&quot; which crackles and bristles with hidden tension and sadness but ultimately leaves you wanting more.  And the feeling of that song is unfortunately a microcosm of the album itself.  When one of the greatest guitar bands on the planet makes the equivalent of a salsa album, lets not call it anything more than an entertaining misstep.
B000000W5H|4.0|It's Only Rock 'N' Roll find the Stones picking up the tempo after the slower more subdued Goats Head Soup.  The album opens with a challenge in the rollicking &quot;If You Can Rock Me&quot;.  The band moves into a spirited cover of the Temptations classic &quot;Ain't Too Proud To Beg&quot; which stands up well next to the original.  The title cut has the classic line that sums up the band's attitude, &quot;I know it's only rock n roll, but I like it&quot;.  &quot;Till The Next Goodbye&quot; is one of the prettiest songs the band has ever done and &quot;Time Waits For No One&quot; finds them in a pensive mood.  The album kind of sags a little bit after that  with throwaways like &quot;Short &amp; Curlies&quot; &amp; &quot;If You Really Want...&quot;, but closes strongly with the funk workout &quot;Fingerprint Files&quot;.  The album keeps a trend that started on Goats Head Soup and one that the band would follow for much of the rest of their career (with a few exceptions), some very strong and good songs mixed in with filler.
1572522232|5.0|This is possibly the greatest horror film ever besides CannibalHolocaust. This film is the only film thats ever given me chills, ... . The music of this film is astonishing. The music is so eerie and creepy, you know that something scary or horrible is abound. Dario Argento is just as creative as John Carpenter or Wes Craven. The gore in this film is excellent. The acting isn't bad at all like some others are saying. Jessica Harper is wonderful! She should be in more movies. The ending of this film is lame, but still the first 90 minutes of this film makes up for it. The thing that pretty much scared me about this movie is this weird looking butler man. He is tall, and boy is he creepy looking. Italian horror buffs and real horror fans must take a look at this, because this is no doubt one of the best horror films ever made.
B000002B30|5.0|Even though Bruce Springsteen has had tremendous success on the singles chart, he has always been an album artist first.  Some of his most popular songs like &quot;Badlands&quot;, &quot;Thunder Road&quot; &amp; &quot;Atlantic City&quot; were never actually released as singles. You are always going to quibble with the selection of an a greatest hits album, especially with someone who has the amount of great songs that Bruce has.  This album is a great introduction for fans unfamiliar with him or casual fans who may not want to invest in his entire catalog.  It is a cd that should be in the collection of hardcore fans as well as it has four unreleased tracks including the amazing &quot;Murder Inc.&quot;  A single disk can never truly do Bruce justice, but within the time constraints of a single disk, this is best you can do.
B00002Z88D|5.0|This was the best CD that Metallica has ever put out!  It is the most awesome thing the way they combine the Symphony with the band.  It sounds awesome.  I like how it has all the hits that I absolutely love like Fuel, Enter Sandman, Master of Puppets, Of Wolf or Man, The Memory Remains, Battery, Sad but True, Where Ever I May Roam and many others.  I also love No Leaf Clover and Minus Human.  They are excellent songs also.  It's the Best They Have Ever Done!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B0000028SU|5.0|Released as the more personal, less commercial of his two simultaneous 1992 releases, Lucky Town is the true follow-up to Tunnel Of Love.  While Tunnel explored the fragility of marriage and relationships, Lucky Town speaks of the joys of marriage, family life and growing older.  &quot;Better Days&quot; speaks of his new found happiness in his married life to Patti Scialfa. &quot;Lucky Town&quot; is a strong and searing rocker.  Bruce was never comfortable with his rock superstar status, but &quot;Local Hero&quot; finds him coming to grips with that fact that he is a hero to alot of people and he is finding more and more comfort in that.  &quot;If I Should Fall Behind&quot; speaks of devotion to your mate while in &quot;Leap Of Faith&quot; &amp; &quot;Big Muddy&quot;, Bruce sings of the faith you have put in someone to find true love.  &quot;Book Of Dreams&quot; is about his wedding day and &quot;Souls Of The Departed&quot; is about the Gulf War and the pain parents feel about the loss of a child.  &quot;My Beautiful Reward&quot; is about the rewards one gets from the happiness of family life.  &quot;Living Proof&quot; is about the birth of his son and ranks right up their with the best songs he has ever done.  On his earlier albums, Bruce was restless and roaming, looking for answers to questions, on Lucky Town he has settled down and found out some the answers.
6305922756|5.0|I loved this movie when it came out, and I love it more now.  I'm continually in awe of the combination of musical and comedic talent on display here by all the performers, but Chris Guest in particular.   The new material adds a lot to the enjoyment - I particularly like the voice-over on the main menu, done by the band.   If you liked it before, this DVD is worth every penny.  If you never saw it, do yourself a favor.
B000000W5B|4.0|Goats Head Soup is the weakest album that the Stones released in the 70's. That being said, it is still a better than average album.  The streak of masterpieces from Beggars to Exile had to end at some point.  No one could possibly expect the band to keep that level up.  Goats Head Soup suffers from comparisons to those albums and in their light, it doesn't match up.  But the music is still very, very good and isn't that really the point.  &quot;Doo Doo Doo Doo Doo&quot; has a funky element to it and it has sound that band would explore further on &quot;Some Girls&quot;.  &quot;Can You Hear The Music&quot; is a throwback to their mid-60's songs and Keith Richards provides &quot;Coming Down Again&quot; which has it's obvious drug references.  &quot;Angie&quot; maybe the most argued about Stones song.  It seems people either love it or despise it.  I fall into the love camp as Jagger sings it with passion.  Mick Taylor has always been an underrated Stone as he never really fit into the band.  His playing on Soup is among his best with the group.  If you don't try to compare the album with previous releases, you'll find some really enjoyable music.
B00001OH7U|5.0|I can hardly find words to express how fantastic this album is. I love all the songs, especially &quot;Word on a Wing&quot;, which is one of my favourite Bowie songs. The Man really rocks!!!!
B00004XQP4|5.0|Some punks will raise the volume of their &quot;sellout&quot; accusations after hearing this album.  But if you listen closer, you find that Green Day has truely crafted a work of art.  The songs are longer than the tried and tested punk formula normally allows, but they back up that length with substance.  Billie Joe addresses mature subjects, such as his love for his wife and his hopes for the future.  The band use harmonicas, acordion, and keyboards, lending the record a full and interesting sound.  &quot;Church on Sunday&quot; is one of the greatest Green Day songs ever.  Not only is it a great example of pop-punk, it also shows Billie's maturity by touching on his relationship with his wife and the compromises inherent in marriage.  &quot;Minority&quot; and &quot;Macy's Day Parade&quot; are also great.  Also recommended: Dookie, Insomniac, and Nimrod (all also by Green Day).
B000002KLZ|5.0|I have every CD that FM &amp; Stevie Nicks ever made &amp; I Bought this to add it to my Stevie Nicks CD's, but it was FM that turned me on to Stevie, so there are all great in my ears &amp; eyes! Stevie's Voice on this Live Concert is worth ever dollar! A MUST OWN FOR THE DIE HARDS........Easy 5 stars rating.<br />Sounds Even Better With A Six Pack! Then It Jumps to A 10 Star!
1573221562|2.0|I had great expectations for Waters' latest novel after reading Tipping The Velvet. But unlike &quot;Velvet&quot; &quot;Affinity&quot; seemed to limp and drag. One reviewer has suggested that the slowness was neccessary for the build up to the final denoument.I was disappointed that Waters let so much ride on the final chapter,it reminded me more of a short story which had been stretched to breaking point than a novel.I can't help wondering whether this was Waters' first novel only published after her second work's success. It certainly lacked the dimension and character development so wonderful in &quot;Tipping The Velvet.&quot; While I agree that a novel written by a lesbian does not have to be a lesbian novel I found Waters' coyness with the subject irritating. After waiting so long to read this book I was very disappointed.
0782008372|1.0|I like to buy DVD's for the improved picture and audio.  You won't find either of those on this one.  I was really disappointed what they did to such a great film.<br />Highlander is such a great movie and they added all this great footage, but they really made a mess of the audio. I have the VHS Collectors version as well and it sounds a lot better.  This DVD will find its way to the auctions.  I'm glad I didn't sell the the VHS.<br />Don't let this review stop you from seeing the movie.  It really is one of the best, under-rated movies out there.  Just stay away from the DVD version.
B00003CXE7|4.0|It was a very good movie. Although the very beginning was fairly horibble and slow. Overall, I give it four stars.
B000000WF0|5.0|This CD has got to be the most amazing ever recorded. I bought it orginally back in 1998 after hearing Bittersweet Symphony and Lucky Man on the radio. Thinking I had wasted my money after listning to it, I one day was driving and listning to it and the track Space and Time came on. That track floored me. It has got to be one of the most emotional heartfelt songs ever sung. This entire album is a masterpiece. However this CD isnt for people who do not listen to lyrics in a song, because in the case of this CD the lyrics are the most important thing. Unlike todays BSB's and N'Sync who sing the same song over and over. This CD has songs about praising love lost and love found. Its about looking at our hearts and seeing how they look from the outside as well as inside. Anyways the tracks I recommend are Lucky Man,Space and Time,Weeping Willow,and Catching the Butterfly
0312243022|5.0|The Hours is a fantastic work of fiction, a literary imagining of the first order. In a time that has been, for me at least, bereft of good writing, Cunningham stands out as one of the two or three best I've read in years. Add Brauner's Love Songs of the Tone-Deaf and Lahiri's Interpreter of Maladies and you've got a reason to return to reading for good. Cunningham's interweaving of three stories, including that of Virginia Woolf herself, is nothing less than brilliant. Top-notch!
0783230621|4.0|The formula for these summer actions movies seems to be: Take an improbable but predictable plot filled with stereotypical characters, then add a bunch of special effects.   While Dante's Peak is guilty of following this formula, it's actually not a bad movie.  Sure, there are a lot of things wrong with this movie but it is fun to watch.  The chemistry between the Bronson and Hamilton characters is actually pretty good, although it's true that most of the other performances in this film are forgettable.  The plot is predictable (you know the volcano is going to blow in the end) but there are enough twists and turns in the action to hold your interest.<br />Admit it --  we watch movies like this for the special effects, and this film doesn't let you down. This film combines miniatures, live action,  and computer generated effects in a very believable way.  The sound on the DTS DVD is incredible.  It's like watching the film in a THX theater.  <br />Sure, this is not Citizen Kane, but it's a fun way to spend a couple of hours.
B00000DHTF|5.0|Much like the live set was a gift to his longtime fans who were begging him to release one, Tracks is also a gift to his fans who have long asked for him to release his outtakes.  Similar to the Bob Dylan bootleg series, Tracks takes us through Bruce's recording career from the original demos he made for John Hammond at CBS in 1972 up to new songs he recorded with the E Street Band in 1997.  For hardcore Bruce fans, most of the songs are familar and probably already owned on bootlegs, but it nice to hear songs like &quot;Seaside Bar Song&quot;, &quot;Roulette&quot;, &quot;Cynthia&quot;, &quot;Frankie&quot; and the others with high quality production instead of the iffy quality you get from bootlegs.  Of course there are some omissions, I would have loved him to include &quot;If I Were The Priest&quot; &amp; &quot;Sugarland&quot;, but how can you complain when you get four cds worth music.  This set shows the man's utter brilliance as many of the songs are better than the ones that appear on his albums and he didn't consider them worthy to make the cut.  All of our throwaways should be this good.
B0000025YW|5.0|I'm from a small town, and in it was one record store. The hippie that owned it was &quot;up&quot; on all the new music. I came in looking for Metallica, but it was sold out. Not wanting to lose a sale (Teeneager with money to spend), the hippie handed me this tape from Accept, he said &quot;Buy this one, if you don't like it, I'll but it back&quot;. Never having heard of the band, but knowing the hippie knew his stuff, I bought it.  I was so damned impressed after the first 30 seconds of music, I told all my friends about this band. If you don't own this album, you should. If you are a true Heavy Metal fan, this is one to put in your collection. Outstanding songs, great riffs, and a cool cd case. You cant go wrong with this one. I have all thier albums. This is one of my favorites.  Come to think of it, that hippie turned me on to Megadeth too...I wonder if he's still in business...
B00000IIXH|5.0|Bruce released 18 Tracks for those who may have not been able to afford a pricey 4 disk set or for those who wanted to get a taste of what the set was all about.  To make it worth the while for those who already bought the box set, he has included three additional songs.  Any longtime Bruce fan will want to pick this up for his version of &quot;The Fever&quot;.  He gave the song to Southside Johnny for his debut album, this version is among the best songs he's ever done.  Unfortunately, &quot;The Promise&quot; is a newly recorded version, not the one from '78, but this three songs make this a must for any Bruce completist.
B00002MZ2T|5.0|hello Everybody! Hopefully I dont sound like a babbling bufoon, but just have a listen to Savage Garden, and you will become converted! &quot;When you feel all alone, and the world has turned it's back on you,&quot; give this album a minute, and you will understand very quickly why Savage Garden are such a hit world wide! I am going to see their concert here in Ireland in December and I simply can'twait to hear Darren sing those lyrics which such beauty, passion, and strenght! I bought their first album by a mistake -I knew a friend of mine would like it, but she died before I had a chance to give it to her, so that album brings back a lot of feeling. The next album I bought because I just wanted some more of the magic, and Affirmation certainly didn't disappoint! So if you are reading thios, not quite sure wether you should chose this C.D or C.D's GO ON BUY IT! Darren, Daniel or co, if you happen to read this, I Truly, madly ,deeply love your C.D-may the talent be with you! God Bless!<br />Johanna
B00000J631|4.0|...but what do you expect?  It's the newest project from one of punk rock's most innovative minds today, Fat Mike... 101 bands on one album playing 30 seconds-and-under songs. The album taps the scenes of over ten countries, and leave it to Fat Mike to collect the most varied lineup of punk, old-school, hardcore, emo, ska, and radio bands of any compilation. So unplug your phone, remove all distractions, and lock yourself in your room before listening or else you might miss half of the bands. Don't plan on doing anything afterwards either, because your attention span will be completely shot.<br />There are a lot of cool tracks on the comp, mostly from bands that have mastered the art of the short song, such as the Descendents. The lineup features everything from legends like Bad Religion, Black Flag, and the Subhumans to today's popular punk bands like NOFX, Pennywise, and the Bouncing Souls. But with such a screwy setup, you're bound to get plenty of bands that don't really take the project seriously, and there are some disappointments. Out of 101 bands, though, what did you expect? There's enough good stuff that you can skip over the crap and still get your fix. Plus, the full-color booklet features a little something from each band, including as pictures, contact information, lyrics, or random band jokes. It's hard to take this CD seriously, but it's a good opportunity to hear a wide mix of punk bands or just sit around with some friends and see who can name the most bands (or count which bands can swear the most in under 30 seconds).
B000002KJQ|5.0|This is the one album that defines ZZ Top.  Great Stuff that grabs you from the first lick.   My 23 yr old Marine Sgt. son and I have both claimed to own our only cd copy.  But what I've always wanted to know is who did the food layout for the inside of the LP album cover.  I asked Billy Gibbons one time, but he didn't know.  Hot Damn!  That food looks as good as the album sounds.
B000002HRE|4.0|This was the first album by Metallica I bought. It was recommended to me by a friend, and I loved it when I got it. Then I heard the old Metallica, and I fell in love right then and their. Since then, I got Load, And Justice for all, Master of puppets, and black album. This is not the best Metallica album you can get, but still a good offering. If you are looking for fast paced, hard, older Metallica music (the best of all), get ...And Justice for All, the best album available right now!
B00004XONN|5.0|this album is amazing, although it does take a few listens to even begin to pick apart the complexity of it. it's great that there is actually still some mainstream creativity happening when every rock band on mtv sounds like korn and don't get me started on all that pop crap. great things happen when you free yourself and explore your creative options. i mean how many times can you rewrite the same song and rhyme the same words....ehem  greenday cough. radiohead has shown a gradual progression over the past four albums. not one sounding completely the same as another. and although i think, no, i know ok computer was the greatest album of any group ever, kid A is still much better than anything out there now. alot of people are just going miss this completely. but then again, those are the pop culturally brain washed lackies who need to hear a catchy chorus. stop playing games with my heart, with my.. oh sorry. face it, true genius is never realized in it's time. shakespeare was a mediocre playwrite in his day and van gogh never sold a single painting while he was alive. radiohead is arguably the greatest band of the 20th century. barring all the sentimental crap and decades of fame, when musicaly stacked against the biggest bands in history, their grasp of complex music theory, innovative capability and thom yorke's genius, emotionally driven vocals, radiohead eclipses all others. well, excuse my rantings, just retaliating to some of the other negative responses. but back to the point. kid A is an amazing album that is 100% worth checking out. but if you're used to the stuff carson daly gives you, this one might be too much for you. like someone trying to read a tale of two cities but is only used to stuff like, &quot;see spot run.&quot; just a different level. but don't take my word for it.
B00000DR8R|5.0|While current popular music is stylistically very far removed from the tree Lloyd was barking up with Rattlesnakes, it is by no means any further ahead.  Having listened to Rattlesnakes about 8 billion times in the decade following its release and having formed a very large part of my expectations of adulthood around its lyrics, I was shocked to find during a recent week of listening that it has held up remarkably well.<br />The album's timeless yet at the same time so firmly grounded in an era.  Like almost every one of The Beatles' (yes, I'm aware of what I'm saying here) albums post-Help, Rattlesnakes could have only been recorded when it was and yet there is nothing dated about it.  If I knew what it was that allows this to happen I would probably be able to describe it better but I can't.  So I'll leave you with this:  Rattlesnakes, from track to track, is probably one of the most coherent Albums I've ever heard.  Each song is lyrically grounded and blends into the others to form a well crafted whole.  Lloyd has written a valentine to the past while looking romantically out to the future.  Buy the album, it ain't bad.
B00003CXE7|5.0|I have always been a big fan of all gladiator films, from Tyrone Powers to Richard Burton.  Any actor donning the sandals and metal skirt has my attention.<br />Russell Crowe's character took my breath away.  His strength, power, and ruggedly good looks won me over.  If your a fan of this genre, or just like to see guys wearing skirts.  This movie is for you.
0780631684|4.0|It is refreshing to see a film that innovates.  The last film to do that in the horror genre was \\"Scream\\".  \\"Final Destination\\" has introduced an inventive approach to the genre, giving it a supernatural killer rather than a lunatic slasher dressed up in some kind of costume.  Using \\"Death\\" as the killer opens up myriad possibilities for the method of death and choice of victims.  This film was excellent at presenting the supernatural stalker's manipulation of the physical world to find murder weapons in everyday objects.  While the concept of Death taking people from earth is hardly new in films, the idea of Death as a malevolent attacker that has a plan that can be outwitted is a novelty.<br />This film is the germination of an interesting direction, but does not bring the concept to maturation.  It is unsophisticated in its storytelling and the characters lack subtlety and realism in their reactions to their situation.  They are undifferentiated from their hollow horror counterparts in that regard, just fodder for the beast.  <br />Director James Wong, who has mostly TV credits on his resume, breaks into feature films with a vengeance.  From the standpoint of the photography and visual effects, the film was excellent.  His camera perspectives were creative and lent greater force to the suspense.  His crafting of the scenes was less effective.  The prescient clues to the next murder lacked nuance.  There were no surprises except perhaps the last murder.  The formula was always the same, Alex predicts a murder and then rushes frantically to prevent it with mixed results.<br />As is often the case in this genre, the acting had a broad range from terrible to very good.  Devon Sawa was excellent.  He gave his character much more range and depth than we are used to seeing from horror heroes.  He was the closest to having genuine human responses to the tragedies, at least in the beginning of the film.  Ali Larter was good as Clear, but her character didn't have much range and she did little to expand the envelope.  The same is true of Kerr Smith whose character had even less dimensionality.  On the awful side, there were Daniel Robuck and Roger Guenveur Smith as the hapless FBI agents and Tony Todd as the completely implausible undertaker.<br />This was an entertaining film and a terrific story concept.  I rated it an 8/10.  It is a must-see for horror fans, but still enjoyable for a broader audience.  Few films of this genre have the potential to improve in the sequel.  This may be one of them.
B00003CX8J|5.0|I was a huge X-Men fan in my younger days.  So much so that I used to have a Wolverine poster in my room.  It must have been at least 15 years since I touched a comic book, but cannot express how thrilled I was to hear that the movie was being released.  I must say when I finally had the chance to watch it, it was as if I had been transported back to my junior high days, and was once again the wide-eyed pre-teen watching many of the heroes who until then only inhabited in the fragile pages of old comic books and in my imagination in &quot;real&quot; live action.  I enjoyed watching X-Men as I have not enjoyed watching such a movie in a long time.  For me to watch it was to be reminded of all that I enjoyed back in my youth.  I can only compare it with what I believe must have been like for people of the older generations to watch the &quot;Dick Tracy Movie&quot;.  I now eagerly await this movie on DVD, and look forward to watching it again.

0066620694|4.0|In my opinion this book is a must read for senior managers, esp. in large organizations, experiencing the growing pains of becoming too big. It illustrates its underlying theory by mainly using the disk drive industry as an example but the learnings can easily be replicated to all kind of companies including FMCGs.<br />The theory, proof and remedy suggesting that great companies fail because they are doing the right thing (!) is intriguing and makes sense after reading the entire book. For novice professionals and students this book might not be the best introudction to management or the subject.<br />Granted, Christensen does repeat himself a little too much, sometimes gets too detailed about the disk drive industry and some of his charts are a pain, but in summary this is a stand-out book.<br />Don't give copies to your co-workers but instead your boss since, as the book illustrates, the innovator's dilemna can only be overcome from the top. Shame that not more very senior managers seem to have read it.
B00004U2MY|5.0|This documentary is more than just a rendition of the controversy surrounding &quot;Citizen Kane,&quot; it is a pair of parallel biographies of the two men. (Everyone knows about the &quot;War of the Worlds&quot; broadcast, but how many know about his successes on stage--&quot;Julius Caesar&quot; on Broadway commenting darkly on the rise of fascism, or &quot;MacBeth&quot; set in Haiti with an all-black cast.) In the end, it poses the question of whether &quot;Kane&quot; is after all, as much about Welles as it is about Hearst.<br /> Time and time again Welles tempts fate, risking disaster to create masterpieces. Star of stage and radio, film with its limitless possibilities (and Hollywood with its machinations) prove his undoing.<br /> Watch and see how perilously close to losing arguably the greatest film ever made. Watch and see why Welles is still a legendary figure whose measure is still be taken.
B00004XQP4|5.0|I am the biggest Green Day fan in the world. You have to buy &quot;Warning&quot;, this is the greatest CD since Dookie. I will admit they sound different, I like Dookie better than the new one, but Billie Joe has the most awesome voice, and the music is better than all the ... . Trust me buy Warning, you will be very happy, also buy &quot;Dookie&quot; by Green Day, ... , and its the best CD ever.
B00004XONN|2.0|Let's put it this way.  <br />Giving it the &quot;edit playlist&quot; test.  If I delete 3-4 songs from the continuous program loop, the album is listenable and somewhat interesting.  But that is where the problem is.  As I have not felt the need to edit the playlist on any of the bands previous efforts.  So yes I am disappointed and believe it is a step backwards for RadioHead.  <br />To be honest I kind of like guitars and vocals.  And this album has hardly any.  Straight synthesizer and tape loops for the most part.  The pendulum simply swang to far off into left field on this CD.  With only brief flashes of the bands previous brilliance on display.  A very average CD from a very talented band.  But in all fairness perhaps I just expected to much after OK Computer.  <br />So in conclusion, I suggest you walk, not run, to buy this CD.  Cause your not really missing anything extraordinary by not having it.  And it probably won't be sold out anyways.
0440214041|5.0|I loved the way the book kept me on the edge of my seat trying to figure out what the heck was going on.  The suspense level was high, the story great, and the character fun to read about.  Highest reccomendation
B00004TRD8|5.0|The special edition DVD is simply a must have in anyone's collection. Three featurettes are included; one for the original version, one for the special edition and one for the Universal Studios 3D show. It would have been nice to see the whole 3D show, but I guess you have to go to Universal Studios to see it. A 50-chapter supplement composed of text notes inter-cut with interviews and special features. Design, pre-production, locations, training, weapons, sound, editing, publicity only touches the information given. You name it they covered it. I especially liked the sound chapter where they broke down the various sound elements so you can hear them isolated from each other. The audio commentary is very good coming from just about every cast and crew member involved. Subtitles are given so you know who is talking. Some of the material is reused though. For example, some of the audio commentary is from interviews used in the featurettes. Sixteen deleted scenes are added in the special version, 18 for the extended special version. To get the extended version enter the roman numbers seen to the right of the main menu; they look odd, but trust me they are roman numerals. I already had T2 on DVD, but the special edition, just for the delete scenes alone, makes it more than worth replacing it if you already have it. The extra scenes give extra depth to the story and the characters. Most bonus features become boring an initial viewing, but I think the ones on this DVD can easily be seen again and again. Overall, if you were stuck on a desert isle, this would be the DVD to have.
044022165X|5.0|Though I am not a fan of litigation, this is an awesome book.  The courtroom scenes between beginner Rudy and the seasoned veteran; forget his name; were absolutely hilarious.  The antics of Deck and Rudy are fun to read and make the book lots of fun.<br />The other plotline is much more serious, but just as good.  I won't say anything because it is better the first time.  Buy this book!
B00004TFK3|4.0|A very good set of DVD's. I would have preferred a double-sided DVD instead of two. The audio commentary was okay, but I've heard better. I liked the Mystery Theater 3000 way they set up the audio commentary, where you can see an outline of the director and Jones as they point at the screen. They also have a graphic where they can write on the film much like Monday Night Football. The bonus features had some very interesting items that I never seen on any other DVD. Interactive items where you can re-edit 3 different scenes and another where you can breakdown the special effects to their various components, very unique and interesting. Another feature where the aliens morph from initial concept to final look was also very interesting. There were no deleted scenes although the director talks about some scenes that were changed to modify the plot. Some storyboards from never shot scenes are also included. Overall, I'd say if you like science fiction or this movie, this is a must have. Otherwise, I might pass it up.
0440211727|5.0|This book is absolutely incredible!  The characters are believable, the plot incredible, and the trial scenes are totally awesome.  Grisham says that he &quot;would not change a word&quot; if given the chance and I heartily agree.  Thanks John!
6304132271|5.0|Seven is one of the greatest, most atmospheric thrillers ever made. <br />Andrew Kevin Walker takes, what seems to be on the surface, an unoriginal concept and makes it his own; producing one of the most original screenplays of the 90's. <br />David Fincher does a fine job as the director of Seven. His direction compliments the gritty screenplay nicely. He effectively brings the script's many stunning suspense sequences to life.<br />Howard Shore gives us a great restrained and ominous musical score. <br />Darius Khondji's cinematography also pays respect to the script by making the images on screen very dark. <br />The set design is wonderfully detailed and greatly adds to the mood. <br />Brad Pitt is pretty good as the cocky detective, David Mills, but he could be more dramatic in some of his more emotional scenes. Morgan Freemen is good but I feel that he underplays his character, William Somerset, a bit too much sometimes. Kevin Spacey gives the best performance of the film as the psychopath, John Doe. He speaks his lines with cold brutality. He is riveting to watch. <br />Seven's pacing is good for the most part; one or two scenes tend to drag on a bit too long, but I suppose this is to help build the suspense. <br />Seven is a great film; a cinematic gem of the 90's.<br />This is probably my favorite DVD. The picture quailty of this DVD is good. The commentaries and featurettes are very informative. I like how Fincher's tone and manner is almost conversational in the commentaries.
157492589X|5.0|I just watched the movie again on satalite and Duvall and Jones were as good as ever. I purchased three diffrent VHS tapes of this movie and they are of the poorest quality of any tape I have. I would be willing to pay a higher price to get a good copy of this movie. One of the best western movies ever made, you would think someone could make a quality VHS.
B000002UJQ|5.0|As I said in my bends review, I'm really not a huge fan of pop or alternative. Radiohead has been one of a couple of exceptions recently. I actually started out with the Bends, and only after a year or so when I began to appreciate it (I was in the process of modifying my tastes) did I think about getting ok computer. There are so many things to like about this album. Sometimes I like the cranky Paranoid Android, sometimes the light sounding no surprises, or the beautiful let down. In my goofy moods I love to read the lyrics. I haven't had the desire to try to make sense of them yet (I've only had it less than a week), but I just love saying &quot;unbornchikken voices in my head&quot;. The only criticism that I have about this cd is really only a difference from the bends. It really doesn't have the light hearted sound from a lot of the songs in the bends. There's always an underlying seriousness, cynicism, or sense or purpose, even in the lighter tracks i mentioned. I think this definitely changes the moods in which I desire to hear this, as opposed to the bends. Like I said, though, it's just a difference. Considering the quality of this release, I'm very surprised it became so popular. I have lost almost all my faith in the pop music scene. I look forward to the controversial Kid A.
0811826848|5.0|A Beatles book by the guys themselves and not another unauthorized book lacking facts by a hack.

B00004YX39|5.0|Gaucho is probably the most perfect album ever made. It is in fact so perfect, that you don't notice how much work went into it. It was as if the album was doomed from the start and I bow deep to Donald Fagen, Walter Becker, Gary Katz and Roger Nichols that they eventually got it finished. At the time of mixing, Walter Becker was almost whacked out of life by a car so he couldn't help mixing the record. A technician fell asleep on the job and erased one of the best songs (The Second Arrangement). It took three years and a million dollars to finally get it done. But it was worth it. The musicians on this album are in top notch shape, as is production, engineering and songwriting. An absolute classic.<br />The lazy decadence of the opening track Babylon Sisters is the perfect music to listen to when seated in a convertible, sun shining and cruising the highway. Listen to the fading chorus at the end: that alone took three days!<br />Hey Nineteen is a typical Steely Dan approach to telling a story abnout a guy who is feeling he gets older,...  Classic stuff.<br />Glamour Profession deals with addiction to drugs in a funny yet exacting way.<br />Title track Gaucho is a mean little story about a rendevous with great saxophone playing and abeautiful melody. <br />Time out of Mind features Mark Knopfler in his first stint as a session musician, an occasion he will not forget very easy. He was asked to play many hours of solos, but eventually saw seven seconds of his efforts mixed into this song. Listen carefully; blink and you've missed it.<br />My Rival is a song about I still can't figure out what. It is a great song, but if anybody can enlighten me about the subject, I'd be most obliged!<br />Legend has it that Third World Man is constructed around a solo that was lying around from the Royal Scam sessions (1976). A haunting melody and indeed a GREAT solo by Larry Carlton. <br />That concludes my review for one of the best albums by one of the best outfits. Buy this oneand you'll find it in your player more often then you would think.
080018789X|3.0|Jerry Maguire is an alright film, in fact it's pretty good, so why am I being so critical?  It probably has something to do with the fact that it's been hailed at the best romantic comedy of all time and simply can't stand up under the weight of it's own hype.  Tom Cruise stars as the title character, a ruthless sports agent who discompationate heart miraculously turns to gold after being critized by an ailing clients son.  It's a mid-life crisis of sorts but I can't help but think the first half of Jerry's life had to be more interesting than this.  He outs himself among his collegues and clients which leads to his firing and provides the films best moment as a perfectly cast Jay Mohr puts a new twist on the old 'we're letting you go' speech.  So Jerry heads out into the world with a staff of one and an equally unimpressive clients list.  Renee Zellweger plays Jerry's love interest and does well with the part but I can't help but be miffed at the notion that there's anything more between these two than a strong physical attraction.  Both are eqally charming and cute which works to their disadvantage here, as Cameron Crowe loses hold of the reighs and lets his movie slip into the relms of fluff.  I can't say too many bad things about Jerry Maguire except if you're looking for a Crowe film to see on a Friday night look to his latest - Almost Famous, which is a step in the right direction for this incrediblly talented filmmaker.

B00004XONN|5.0|If you like radiohead because they &quot;really rock&quot;, or if your favorite song by them is &quot;creep&quot;, I suggest that you forget about listening to this album.  You will be disappointed.  For the rest of us out there searching for an expansion in music beyond the confines popular commercialist rock music, this album will restore your faith in the future of music.  Yes, I read all the bad reviews, too.  I even read one reviewer (jack lockhart) who implied that radiohead was making a sophomore attempt at sounding like such avant-garde minimalists as Philip Glass or Steven Reich.  He then further insulted fans of &quot;kid a&quot; by stating, &quot;And how many of you that gave this album a five-star review own an album by any of those guys?&quot;  well, jack, since you're such a connoisseur of 20th Century music, let me ask you, which of the Philip Glass stages were radiohead impersonating?  His composition, &quot;Music in 12 Parts&quot;?...or perhaps &quot;Koyaanisqatsi&quot;?  Or maybe even the Steven Reich masterpiece, &quot;another view of counterpoint&quot;?  wait...I gave &quot;kid a&quot; a five star review, yet I am equally familiar with the excellence of those composers that you boast a great knowledge of.  Of course this poor fellow that I am bashing, as well as others, listed &quot;Pablo honey&quot; and &quot;the bends&quot; as being radiohead's better albums.  Ignore the bad reviews, music lovers.  radiohead is maturing, and their explorations have proven that there is still new music out there to be found.

B00002DEQQ|5.0|I bought this CD almost a year ago based on hearing three songs -- Burning Down the House, Are You Gonna Go My Way and Sexbomb. After a year, I still listen to this cd that any other I've bought since.<br />Tom is in top form and the selection of songs and artists are inspired. The cd has already put a few songs in the top ten in Europe -- try going to any club in Europe and not hearing Sexbomb -- and could be a big hit in the US if released here. I have yet to meet one person who doesn't like this cd.<br />Recommended tracks: Bruning Down the House, Are You Gonna Go My Way, Sexbomb, Looking Out My Window and Never Tear Us Apart.
0811826848|5.0|My first reaction when I took this collection out of its box was, &quot;Holy crap!  This thing is HUGE! &quot;  And rightly so, considering this is the Beatles' entire history described in their own words.  No 'ifs', 'ands', or 'buts' about it:  The Beatles were and are THE BEST ROCK 'N' ROLL BAND EVER.  I love the artistic license that was taken with this publication.  Text over a background of incredible photographs is a great touch throughout the book.  Graphically rendered reprints of such historical documents as the contracts for their concerts and Apple Corp's formation are amazing.  And this is not a mere photo album with the occasional caption included (though I wish many more of the photos in fact HAD captions to properly detail some of the momentous occasions).  This book has a TON of text.  No stone is left unturned, and all Beatles fans are better for it now.  Peace &amp; love always, and enjoy the book!

B000002L6P|3.0|This is the album that launched Madonna into superstardom, and it's packed with some of her biggest hits, including the title song, Material Girl, and Dress You Up.

0684853523|5.0|Tell the truth when you write fiction. This is one of the many important points that Stephen King makes in On Writing. This book also tells the truth about writing. It doesn't matter where you sit or how many friends you have in New York, good writers are people who love writing and have the drive and respect for their readers to do it well. I've never read any other Stephen King book, primarily because I'm squeemish, but I've very glad I read this one, twice.
0553579908|5.0|During one of those endless nights when I just couldn't put Clash of Kings down, I wondered: &quot;Why aren't there more books like this?&quot;  George Martin has created one of those most deeply involving and satisfying series out there.  In only two books, he has crafted real characters involved in the horrors of war.  Many of the reviews below accurately describe the way that Martin creates characters of grey, rather than comic book black and whites.  Many of the scenes in the book fit well with dark and somber lighting. This is not your daddy's fantasy novel.<br />Martin's characters bring a more realistic spin on knighthood and war.  Cersei describes it best to young Sansa when she destroys the young girl's romantic view of knights by remarking that knights are for killing, nothing more or less.  And kill they do.  The battle scenes are raw and unglamorous, like the opening scene from Saving Private Ryan.  Its all very realistic and gritty and heck, it makes sense: what do you really think happens when a not-so-sharp sword is swung haphazardly at another person: I've never seen it firsthand, but I'm sure its not pretty. It may be an oxymoron to claim that a fantasy book can be realistic, but this series is:  after seeing the battle scenes in Braveheart or Gladiator, I have a deeper understanding of the horrors of sword fighting in, say, the medieval times in English history.  Martin's story is realistic in the sense that it doesn't gloss over the horror and pain and terror of battles and the rage of the people who fight them.<br />Martin's series is a hardcore fantasy adventure for adults.  While other authors cater predominately to a younger fantasy audience, Martin seems to write for the &quot;college and beyond&quot; crowd (at 31, I'm well beyond).  Sex scenes, like the battles, are not glamorous in the least.  Whereas characters in Robert Jordan's Wheel of Time series constantly blush and stumble at the very thought of even kissing a girl, Martin's characters think lewd thoughts, perform graphic sex scenes, etc.  Yes, its not for all ages, or for every taste, but for those of us who are tired of the same old antiseptic stuff, Martin is a mature breathe of fresh air.<br />Meanwhile, he continues to awe me with his story telling.  The different kings are now in open conflict with each other. Whereas Game of Thrones focused on the Starks v. the Lannisters, in this installment, it seems as if the entire land is in termoil, with no less than six kings fighting each other and attacking each other.  The battles are terrific, including the climactic battle. (no spoilers here) <br />One other note I feel compelled to make is that Martin has created strong and independant female characters in his series.  People might assume, based on the reviews, that this is a male-dominated story.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  Martin spends as much time writing about the female characters (Sansa, Arya, Catelyn Stark) as the male characters, and the female characters rule (i.e. Cersei) and fight battles (I won't reveal any specifics on this point except to say that Martin introduces two female warriors.)<br />Martin has created a real world, with all the vices of our own, and given all his characters life.  Here's hoping that other writers take note.
B00000899T|5.0|adore strayed from billy corgan's, and the music business' style of writing, and he did well with it.  different from their last release, the sprawling success of MCIS had caught a lot of new fans, only to lose them because of the new sound.  the absence of drumming made the album so much more personal, and i think that if it had been successful, it wouldn't have been so personal.  this album is for the true fans.  it knocked me off my feet hearing it for the first time.  it wasn't what i had expected, nor what the critics expected.  the lyrics are deep, emotional, and raw, and the music is moody, dark and sythesized.  i love it.  if you liked this, check out aphex twin too.
0811826848|5.0|This is basically THE greatest Beatle book I've seen. After this, you don't want to read any other books about them, because they're not actually in The Beatle's own words.  The layout is positively GORGEOUS. Even though I'm still reading the beginning part, I like to skip around and just look at all the glossy pictures. The colors, the pictures- amazing! I love how they equally represented John, too, in this. A lot of books don't do that.  (I was born exactly 7 years after he was killed). This is a great book for devoted Beatle fans, such as myself, who love them but weren't around back then. It's probably great for the baby boomers too. Buy it! You won't regret it.
B00004Y6TQ|5.0|The soudtrack in itself is a masterful work, but when heard in the context of the film, it takes on a completely different life.  Not only do you get the chance to see Bjork give an award-winning acting performance, but you also get to understand and see how Bjork's music develops and takes life.  <br />In the film, as Selma gradually looses her eyesight, her world start to get dominated by audial daydreams.  Her escapes into the music her mind creates fulfill her girlish dreams of one day being a star in a musical.  However, the sounds that create this world in her mind do not come from violins or trumpets, but from industrial machinery, trains and a jumping 33rpm record for example, just like in Bjork's real-life world.  Every little click, bang, thump becomes an element of Selma's musical world, and gradually degenerate into a full-fledged composition or show-tune with full choreography and special effects.  <br />As in most of Bjork's compositions, the sounds are unusual, original and surprising, challenging your mind to go beyond the accepted musical boundaries.  In addition, with this recording, Bjork almost redifines the concept of &quot;soundtracks&quot;, which for the last few years have tended to be composed of songs that have no relation to the film what-so-ever.  In this case, the film could not exist without the music, even if the music can still perfectly stand on its own.  Once again, Bjork is a true pioneer.<br />It is however a shame that not all of Bjork's performances from &quot;Dancer in the Dark&quot; were included on this soundtrack.  In the film, she does a heart-wrenching rendition of &quot;My Favorite Things&quot;, from The Sound of Music.  Also, in one of the most climatic and emotional points in the movie, Selma sings one of the movie's most defining songs, acapella, but it is also not included on the soundtrack... I cannot describe this song in more detail without giving away too much from the movie, but those who have seen the movie willunderstand why it would have been so important to include that piece as well...
B00004XQP4|3.0|ok, the first time i listened to this record i was discusted.  im sorry, but the way the guys were building it up, i was really expecting more of a dookie/insomniac style album.  however, after listening to it a few times, i have come to appreciate it more.  the album is self produced, and it shows(i dont mean that in a good way-sorry guys).  the guitar is very low in the mix, and very lightly distorted if at all.  one of my favorite characteristics of old green day is that wall of guitar sound.  im also not a fan of all the experimentation with obscure instruments (accordian, harmonica, saxaphone?-please!)  but enough complaining-overall it really isnt a horrible cd.  the majority of the songs are well written, melodically its still green day, theyve just slowed down and turned down.  church on sunday, waiting, and minority are all gems.  macys day parade is herendous.  a weak attempt at another ballad.  misery and blood sex and booze are also embarassing.  but once again, its really not a horrible record. so, if youre prepared not to hear crunchy guitar and fast, two minute punk anthems, then but away.  the album seems to be getting good reviews and i do wish the best for the guys.
B00004X01U|1.0|If you ever found yourself bobbing your head in time to the sounds that the little white ball made in the classic video game &quot;Pong,&quot; then you'll love Madonna's new album &quot;Music.&quot; I swear, this CD has more bleeps and bloops than a televisied network showing of a Joe Pesci movie. A friend of mine was playing this CD and I had to stop and ask her what all the noise was; I thought maybe the fire alarm had gone off again in our dorm.<br />This CD is nothing like what its title claims it to be. Madonna's last, &quot;Ray Of Light,&quot; was different and innovative; her latest seems to be inspired by French rave music run through a casio keyboard anyone can buy at Toys R Us.
6305910103|2.0|This is probably my favorite ST movie.  Ricardo plays a great role and this is a great 'tactical' battle that holds a lot of suspense.  Unfortunately the transfer to DVD is one of the worst that I have seen and heard.  The transitions in the movie are crude and the quality is only ok, at best.  The audio portion would rate in the negative scale.  Switching from 5.1 to Dolby produced no difference, it sounds like it was recorded underwater.
0780631684|5.0|What sets this teenager slasher movie apart (and above) the others is the villain. After endless Jasons, Freddys, Michael Myers, Scream Ghosts, it's hard to imagine a creative new bad guy. Enter &quot;Death&quot;. In the hands of lesser film-makers, we would have had to sit through a whole flick of a cloaked, dark figure a la, &quot;I know What You Did Last Summer&quot;, but here we get to see, or experience, death as a natural force. Because you can't see the figure, and because it can be ubiquitous, it makes the &quot;shock&quot; killings all that more shocking. This is a suprisingly tight, well-made movie.  It's perhaps no surprise that it's the brain child of X-Files alumni Wong and Morgan. While other reviews have balked at the mix of humor and gore, I think it plays really well. It doesn't fall into pastiche comedy-horror, but rather titilates the audience with a teasing sense of humor. While you can assure yourself that there's no Freddy or Jason under your bed and get a good night's sleep, this movie makes you realize death is on its way and there's no escape. How confrontational is that for a teenager slasher? Kudos to the film makers for something different and enjoyable. Also, the DVD provides the original ending and a documentary on the &quot;test screening&quot; process and why the ending got changed. One of the best DVD supplements I've seen.
B00000JH09|5.0|This is simply one of the best hardcore albums ever. This group got me interested in the whole hard rock scene. Ever since i picked this album up 2 years ago, i couldn't get enough of them. The guitars on this album are great and the vocals are also equally excellent. Every song on here is awesome especially &quot;Sugar&quot;(a personal favorite), &quot;War?&quot;, and &quot;Spiders&quot;. All in all this album is one of the best.
B00004XONN|4.0|After rejecting conventional pop song structure and seeking refuge in the detached sonic textures of ambient/electronic music, David Bowie confounded the general listening public while receiving a great deal of critical acclaim for his adventurousness. The result? Record sales plummeted. Bowie was dropped from his label and began making conventional, run-of-the-mill pop records for the entirety of the 1980s.  Twenty years later, Bowie's most experimental albums are considered the work of pure musical genious while his stadium filling 80s work has been labeled &quot;sell out'.  Much like their influential musical godfather, Radiohead is yearning to grow. The Bends was fantastic, OK Computer was the seminal Rock opera bombast akin to early 70s Concept/Prog Rock.  Although these albums were far from conventional alternative fair, they contained enough catchy hooks to impress the most cyncial of critics to the average brooding 20 year old.  If one listens carefully to their first three full length albums, the content of KID A is not incredibly shocking.  Although rather guitar-driven, the songs on OK are layered with swirling high-tech noises and songs move from a whispering lull to an ecstatic climax to a brooding dirge within the course of minutes. Yorke's vocals have never been completely coherent, yet the haunting power of his vocals is indisputable.  Therefore,his decision to use his voice as a sort of instrument on several tracks is certainly not a total misuse of his talent.  In short, Radiohead has created a beautiful sounding little record with moments of icy chilliness while retaining certain elements of their pop sensibility.  It requires several intense listens and is by far their most aurally demanding work.  Not for the casual rock fan.  Unlike many reviewers that have posted, I am of the belief that this record does make a great deal of sense and I am excited to see what musical direction they will take next.  In the spirit of the Beatles, Bowie and RoxyMusic they have taken more than one risk and have, once again, created great art. 4 stars.
B00004XONN|5.0|I AM NOT A DIE-HARD RADIOHEAD FAN.  I came into their music over a year ago sort of indirectly - my fiance loves Radiohead's music.  Well, one listen of Kid A and I fell in love with it instantly.  This is a live wire to the astral plane, or collective unconscious, or whatEVER ... jolly-hop venture into this newly designed park created in the land of mythic symbols ~ tee hee ~ Your imagination and emotions will reel when you listen to this.  <br />I am soooooo amused by the people who claim this is rot, this is a loose mess, this is not music, this is not rock.  First of all, I really could care less about the particular label.  The fact remains:  THIS IS REAL MUSIC.  We need more innovation like this instead of the tired old musical styles and chords hashed out again and again over time.  That stuff makes me go ballistic.  It's neurotic no-thinking no-growing grinding nonsense and I can't see value in it for the 100,000th time around.<br />I am a really big Bjork fan.  I felt like I heard something similar to Bjorkian &quot;techno&quot; here in the songs structures and adventurous exploration.  To me, real music is a form of art and it comes from the spirit.  This means it's chock-full of impressionism at times and may seem like listening to someone's dream.  The Verve's debut is another great example of this.<br />Oh yeah - I was saying - for those who claim this is nothing, that this is rot, etc. - I think that perhaps they don't know how to listen, apparently.  I am no musical expert.  But I need a bit more than the same old melody/lyric/chorus garbage combo with familiarity galore to call it a solid piece of music.<br />I didn't know if Radiohead was going to make this reputedly &quot;experimental&quot; CD fly.  I just call it art.  It flies with me.  I love this.<br />Every song is very rich and complete.  Not everyone will &quot;get it&quot; because not everyone is that aware of some subtleties in life and emotion and existence and beauty as other different types are.  I don't mean that I'm overall better, or they're better, but just different, with our different gifts and faults.  I am not on a high horse.  My horse is just a different color.  And, my horse happens to dance to this CD.   <br />Earlier I said I was &quot;amused&quot; by the scoffers - I really mean to say SAD, though.  *sigh*  but oh well.  It's to be expected.<br />Oh, this is a beautiful CD - in the top 1%.  The only songs that DIDN'T grab me were Everything In It's Right Place and The National Anthem.  Can't pick a favorite yet - it's too early (and what does it matter?)<br />This CD is very magical.  It is a clear expression of the music I used to dream about and think on that would come into existence about this point in time.  CONGRATULATIONS, RADIOHEAD, FOR CREATING SUCH A PERSONAL AND SOULFUL WORK OF ART!  ;)<br />If you just want music to act as a fill-in wallpaper for your activities, or for some kind of ego boost when jamming with friends or whatever, stop buying CDs and take an art class, please.  Music is not adrenalin or security blankets for your socially-insecure little egos.  The world needs more introspection encouraged by art like this if we're ever going to see the positive changes we need.  K, k, getting too socio-political - i'm done now.<br />Silly me, that is what I have to say.  I doubt anyone will read this one anyway!
B00000IAU3|5.0|I saw Dido perform with Sting this summer, and she was really wonderful. I see comparisons to Sarah, Fiona, Beth Orton and others, but to me she sounds very similar to Irish singer-songwriter Eleanor McEvoy. Please check out her albums if you like Dido!!!

No one ever has or ever will show that much PASSION,OR TALENT for their craft as he did! <br />Fly on Jimi!
B00004Z400|3.0|...what was the point?  This CD just seems like a marketing gimmick to me.  They release the exact same album with 1 extra track and a new cover.  You could just Back to School off the net...  Seems marketed at hardcore fans and those who haven't purchased the CD yet, and it's kind of a kick in the .... to those who already have the CD and don't wan't to spend any more money.  Saddest thing is, I'll probably end up buying it...
B00004XONN|5.0|Ok people, I thought this album was going to get a huge amount of reviews. So here is another one and hopefully this will mean something. I think that Radiohead is finally doing something to change music (for better or worse, thats your call)and although as one reviewer had said there are alot of labels that have been doing this for years (warp, skam, rephlex etc..) this album is a great thing to hear from a mainstream band. Radiohead will not get top 40 songs with this one, and I think it takes alot of guts to put yourself out on a limb like that. Sure they could throw out another guitar rock album, and make most of the radio &quot;heads&quot; (sorry to use another pun. Had to do it)but they are listening to the voices that are getting tired of (what we now have come to call) rock music, and mainstream music. The only reason we have bad music out there (and why we all complain so much about it) is that the majority of us dont know any better. Most of us are only exposed to a VERY small amount of music (be it good or bad), almost none of us get to hear good Jazz, good afrocuban, good Techno music, we hear what people tell us to listen to, so we cant decide for ourselves. Radiohead I think is making a major change, and trying to expose to the majority of you what all of us IDM and Techno fans already know. We need to listen to these changes, to help music out, we need to be more educated in music. Most of us dont know John Coltrane from Kenny G. So, listen to the album, write your reviews and just make sure that you realize that Radiohead is trying to help the music community out, whether you are a fan of IDM or Techno, thats your call, but they are doing a good service for music and just aknowledge that fact. (ok, ill get off my soapbox now.)
015650300X|5.0|This is a book that everyone should read, like a sort of emotional vaccination in childhood. In simple language, in a simple story, it delves into how we should relate to each other, and how we should live our lives. Only great writers can convey this in such an uncomplicated way. There is something in this book that will speak to everyone.

B00003CX8I|5.0|I must say that this movie totally surpassed my expectations!  As a long-time X-Men fan, I was expecting an utter horror, either playing too much to the fans so people who've never read the comics wouldn't understand or totally ignoring all established history so fans would be clutching their heads in despair.  This movie managed a nice balance, with enough explanation for people who've never *heard* of the X-Men to understand it, yet attention to history and a few in-jokes for the fans.  <br />The only complaint I had was with Storm, who was an incredibly weak character played totally ineffectually by Halle Berry.  And what was with that accent?  The interplay between the other characters was perfect, including the relationship between Scott and the Professor and the Scott/Jean/Logan love triangle.<br />I heartily recommend this movie to anyone, whether or not you're an X-Men or sci-fi fan.  Fun for all!
B00004XONN|5.0|I'll be honest. I was really looking forward to the release of &quot;Kid A&quot;. In my mind, Radiohead is really one of the last &quot;rock&quot; bands that deserve any real attention. They are true innovators. Just check the progression from &quot;Creep&quot;, which at the time was labeled a &quot;grunge&quot; song, to &quot;OK Computer&quot;, which was universally heralded by the rock AND electronic press as an unmitigated masterpiece. The evolution continues with &quot;Kid A&quot;. It is the definition of a &quot;difficult&quot; album at first, seemingly impenetrable. But upon additional listening, the album starts to make sense. Lyrics are few and far between on some songs, and this intensifies the lonely, abandoned feel of the album. The sparse arrangements seemingly further distance the listener from the artists, but that may be the point. This is a very personal album, best listened to alone to allow a full examination of what it means to you, unfettered by other people's reactions or pronouncements. For this reason, even long-time fans may reject it as a joke or a misstep, but I feel that these people are possibly missing the whole point of Radiohead. They are not your average &quot;rock&quot; band, and this is far from your average &quot;rock&quot; album.
B00000G3HZ|5.0|College friends reunite after a friend kills himself. The seven friends, all now in their 30's, come together for one weekend. They stay in one of the friends' house, both of the owners having gone to college with the group and gotten married to each other. While there, they meet up and talk about their lives, their jobs and their loves. They end up learning things about eachother that they never knew, and during this small amount of time they go back home feeling changed.
B00004XONN|5.0|Radiohead is one of the few bands whose music evolves dramatically from albmum to album. &quot;OK Computer&quot; already was a big leap forward. With &quot;Kid A&quot;, they leave the realm of classic songwriting and go into a more avantgardistic or even experimental direction. The music is now much more electronic than before, and contains extensive soundscapes that can draw the listener into hypnotic trance. This album is difficult to listen to, and you need some degree of inner calmness to &quot;breathe&quot; it in - then it will carry you away into the open space.
B00004XQP4|5.0|i've been reading some of the reviews and alot of them are complaning that it dosent sound the same as the old stuff. one of the reason this album is so rad that it's so different. i can't stop loving how it's so different. the first time i heard the song &quot;misery&quot; i just said to myself wow!. so if your a green day fan this is a must. so make sure you check it out.
6304981635|5.0|Eversince I can think, I have been absorbed, motivated, astounded and driven foward in my own quest to master the art of fighting (&quot;whithout fighting&quot;, one might add as a quote out of the movie), Lee has been at my side all the way. Although he was buried the day I was born in 73, he is the greatest of all time, in spite of, or probably even because of, his untimely death.<br />OK - Let's get to the hard facts concerning the DVD. It is definetly a must-have for all fans. Although most of the footage of private Lee is available elsewhere, it is good to have it on one beautifully put together silver-disk. New for me was the Scene out of &quot;Marlow&quot;, whitch simply was unattainable here in Germany up to this point. I loved it, and can now understand the hype which this performance created. <br />The interview-gallary is informative, yet it's greatest value in my opinion lies in the fact that one get's to know the way Linda talks &quot;about&quot; Bruce a little more intimatly. <br />To sum it up... If you don't have this DVD already, you know what to do right away...Go get it. You'll see the old brilliant Bruce Lee in new brilliant picture and sound.
B00000DCHE|5.0|This is a great live set. The club feel comes through very well and it helps to catch you up on Billy before &quot;The Stranger&quot; made him a star. All the tracks here are from the albums prior to that. Rarely can an artist go back and give his audience a refresher course on what they've missed, but this album does it very well. And, Billy's extensive liner notes make for a great read.
B00004XPQL|5.0|This was, a interesting movie well the things Alex saw were scary and he saw the future the plane it scared me, well this movie is worth watching! Enjoy
6302101743|5.0|This was always one of my favorite Ray Harryhausen films. The Jerome Moross score elevates this film from being just another standard fantasy motion picture and transforms it into a Western dinosaur roundup. The setting enhanced by the score and Harryhausen's convincing stop motion creatures really dupes the viewer very subtly into thinking that this Western could have happened. Or almost! The actual valley when first seen by the cowboys has a very unsettling look about it, somewhere between prehistoric and surrealistic. The Jerome Moross score is very reminiscent of his \\"THE BIG COUNTRY,\\" \\"THE PROUD REBEL\\" and \\"THE JAYHAWKERS.\\" The dinosaur work here by Harryhausen ranks among his best. \\"I see what you mean Mister Kirby.\\"
0316777722|5.0|Another more malcontent malcontent!!Keep this on your bedside table and read in stages. If you like irreverent, ascerbic wit, you wont want this book to end.
B00004X01U|5.0|First, let me indicate to those die-hard elecronica/techno fans that are bashing this CD, why they need to silence themselves. There are a small group of fans that for some reason or another, think they are unique and &quot;elite&quot; because they happen to like an obscure band with titles like: The Braindead Coffee Cups, or Purple Feathered Air Freshners. That these type bands are little known, the fans develope a false secureness: ie, What ! You've never heard of The Swinging Monkey Tongues ? ! Well, I have and therefore I'm special. Yada yada yada. So when a world renowned artist like Madonna borrows little snippets of an underground genre, these &quot;special few&quot; can't wait to get to their little keyboards and sling some &quot;smarmy&quot; attitude. How dare Madonna invade their &quot;uniqueness&quot;. Point proven, notice all the name-dropping of obscure and little known bands in some of the posts. Well, the truth is, if these &quot;special fans&quot; truly like that kind of music, then they truly should be happy that Madonna is exposing a trace of it to a wider audience. Even a trace appears to be too much for some: We want the old Madonna....bicker..yada.. Now, for we music lovers in general, this is an amazing CD. Ten songs that get better with each listen, which is a good sign for endurance. Madonna puts everything PLUS the kitchen sink into this one. I highly recommend  this CD to music lovers in general.
0898459885|5.0|This book tells of a bunny saying goodnight to all the things around him before he sleeps.  The simple manner by which the story is told really catches my daughter's attention that it becomes easy for her to memorize the book by heart.<br />The illustrations are cute (especially the mouse --- seen in almost every page!) and the voices behind the songs (audio cassette) make my baby fall asleep faster! <br />A truly delightful book for babies and moms!
0312243022|5.0|I generally like a little more story to my story, and struggle with books that are well written slice of life pieces.  This book, however, did it so well that I didn't mind.  I did as many of these reviews suggested and read Mrs. Dalloway first and must admit I liked this better.  These are three interconnected stories that are woven together effortlessly and adeptly with a central motif of sex and suicide.  Cunningham uses language much like Woolf but the stories move faster and more purposively.
B00004XONN|4.0|After the let down of OK Computer I was a bit skeptical of Kid A. The first couple of listens I was scratching my head in wonder. Then after a few more listens it hit me, this album is great. Buy it!
B00004XONN|4.0|I'm going to agree with the silent but vocal majority out there and say &quot;Kid A&quot; can almost be considered derivative in lieu of techno albums.  In some ways it is nothing like Radiohead has ever produced.<br />However, there is also a tremendous amount of heart weaving its way through the songs, and that is totally Radiohead.  Thom seems to be especially moodful in &quot;Motion Picture Soundtrack&quot; and &quot;Everything in its Right Place&quot;, two of the seminal pieces on the albums.  Other songs are a little too techno for me (Idioteque springs to mind), but as Rolling Stone said, perhaps that is the point.  To embellish the derivative nature of humantiy going into the 21st century.<br />I'm not going to say this album rocks simply because I love Radiohead.  I liked &quot;The Bends&quot; and &quot;OK Computer&quot; much more, and only some of &quot;Pablo Honey&quot;.  However, they are certainly a band to watch and, with another album being worked on as we speak, I can only imagine how they will counteract such already beautiful painted images.
6303020089|5.0|All the producers responsible for all the sappy, manipulative garbage that has been made should watch this movie to see how drama is supose to be done. The movie presents a good, decent, and well developed main character and then evokes emotion from the viewer by having something happen to him that he does not deserve. That's how you evoke genuine emotion. You don't do it by telling how a flat and one dimensional character has everything to live for and then killing him or by having a lot of bad things happen to the type of character who can't solve his problems without the use of excessive violence. That garbage is just a complete insult to me. I also like the fact that Gerard is a good and respectable law enforcement officer and not either an idiot or corrupt like the cops in most wrongfully accused stories. And the story is very believable and deosn't insult the viewer's intelligence. Richard Kimble is convicted because he looks guilty, not for some stupid, lame reason like they come up with in most wrongfully accused movies. And they managed to give the entire motivation of the one-armed man with only five words. This movie is just absolute perfection.
B00003CXE7|5.0|This is just one of the good movies I ever seen, the drama and the argument fullfilled the attention of the viewer, the soundtrack music is outstanding, on every scene! and the visual effects are the best ones, for a movie that bring us such a grandeur time of the romans, We wanted so hot!!! atte:<br />Ivan Jaramillo
0780631684|4.0|This is a film that should not be classified with all of those formulaic slasher flicks. This is one of, if not the smartest, horror movies to come along in a very long time. This film is set up brilliantly, with many death scenes flawlessly laid out.  There are many points in this movie that you can not believe what has just happened. There are scenes that will make you look at everyday items in a different way. For example, a tile floor will be looked at with a little more skepticism from the fearful few that can believe that this will happen.  This film is very well acted, and there is not a point that you get sick of all of the actors, as you do in other teenager horror films. You may start to hate a character, but this will only want you to watch to see what happens next, to see if his/her number will be the next one up. The DVD offers numerous interesting features, including a game that will tell you when you are expected to die, and one that will test your skills at the paranormal. The deleted scenes are of interest, but the alternate ending only makes you relieved that they left on the original, thrilling end shot.
B00000IAU3|5.0|I bought this CD and have not been able to stop listening to it. I am addicted to Dido and her beautiful voice. *Here With Me* is great, but so is every song that comes after it. *Thank You* just fills a void and makes you feel all warm and fuzzy inside and all gitty, it's great. This is not just another girlie CD, Dido can appeal to all for she is extremly talented and her music hits all marks. I can not believe how great the entire CD is, truely not a one hit wonder. Thank you, Dido.

B00003CWTH|5.0|I love movies that make you think, this was one of those movies. I also love movies where all the characters are connected in some way and they do not realize it. I thought that this was a great movie. My favorite is that *Wise Up* scene. If you think you know what this movie is about before you see it, you're completely wrong. Tom Cruise gives a wonderful performance that is completely unlike anything he has ever done. Julianne Moore and Phillip Seymore Hoffmann are great in this film. Even William H. Macy adds to the movie with the small part that he has. The soundtrack by Aimee Mann is also defiantely worth picking up. It is incredible. This movie is long, but so worth. I recommed it to anyone.
B00000IAU3|3.0|It took listening 3 times to this cd before I fell in love with it.  The first time, a few tunes jumped out at me, but they all started to sound the same after a while.  The second time, more and more songs started jumping out and I began to think that maybe I was a little tired the first time I listened to it.  By the third listen, I was hooked.  I've had this disc in my car for 3 weeks now and the more I play it, the more I like it.<br />Notable songs include, but are not limited to: \\"Here with Me\\" (or the theme to Roswell) which blends beautifully into \\"Hunter,\\" the feel-good \\"Thank You,\\" and the dreamy \\"My Life.\\" <br />I hate saying that a new artist sounds like already established artists, but \\"No Angel\\" reminds me of a Portishead cd.  It's the type of music that almost puts you into a trance, it's so beautiful, but like Portishead, it's edgy and energizing at the same time.  Dido's voice is like a lullaby and the music gets under your skin and calms you after a long day.
B00002MZ4W|4.0|This CD was alright, but for fiona it was good. I love her attitude, but it is something that I have to be in the mood for. I love the beats on this CD and the emotion with which she sings. She is a wonderful artist.

B00000J6AG|5.0|This CD rocks so hard! It is considdered to be techno...but there are more mellow tracks on it that are great. I love listening to this CD because it energizes me so much. I clean to it dance around, you can do anything. Moby is just brilliant. There is not really much else to say...sorry....
B00004XONN|5.0|A lot of people seem mad with this record, and I can see why. This is not the record I expected, and I don't think it's the record ANYONE expected. Hey, I'll admit it; I was a little dissapointed after the  first listen. But this is one of those very few albums that actually get better every time I listen to it. The only other albums I can think of that do this are Sonic Youth's 'Daydream Nation' and the Pixie's 'Doolittle.' As far as 'Kid A' goes, I still don't think I've absorbed it all yet, and I've listend to it one or two times every day for the past week. Before you go and judge this album, listen to it four or five times. Sure, it may sound like &quot;ambient crap&quot; when you first hear it, but if you get to know it, you'll realize you have one of the most beautiful albums ever recorded lying in your hands.
6305013578|1.0|It's sad to think of the fact that approximately half of all the movies made before 1930 are irrecoverably lost, never to be seen again. The obvious conclusion one can draw from this is that we need to be extra vigilant about protecting the delicate prints we have of the films that are still here. And that's why it makes me angry to see the absolutely awful copy of Metropolis that is to date the only version of the film available on DVD. The film is framed poorly, played at the wrong speed and has awful music accompanying the film. That a company would put this classic film out in this fashion for people to pay money for is a scandal. There are better versions of the film available on VHS, especially the Kino Video release of the film which I was fortunate enough to see, so why should this be the only version of the movie available on DVD? For some reason, some classic films seems to have fallen through the cracks, and despite the heroic efforts of film restorers who are working hard to preserve as much of the early days of motion pictures as possible, it would be a crime if Metropolis ended up being one of the ones that disappears. Anyone who appreciates this film or indeed appreciates film in general should be crying out for Kino to release their version on DVD, or better yet, for Criterion to issue a restored version. THAT would be worth paying for!
B00004THAY|5.0|get in the car,put this cd in your player and start riding. This is white english and black american blues merged in a awesome way. I love blues pieces in this album.King has the breath of a big old blues hero,his riffs are flowing out freely from his hearth.Clapton is the one I like.This guy sometimes seems to think too much at the way he plays and his playing becomes boring and predictable;not this time this is clapton at his best it's the free and bluesy soul of this man to take over. You can feel it because every riff he plays during the singing is well placed and integrated with the song,it's not just a riff as itself. I love the pop songs too cause they have that rock-bluesy manner I like and Eric has done a lot of pop during his career and he knows how to do it. So that's all,enjoy the ride with the two kings.
0784011796|5.0|The only way to be able to judge this movie is by watching it several times, because there is so much there that it is impossible to absorb it all the first time.<br />Spirals are everywhere, whether they be hurricanes, or subatomic particle paths, or galaxies, and come in many forms. The belief of the main character(indeed, probably the only thing resembling a religious belief for him) is that all nature is defined by mathematics, by patterns, and that it is only a matter of finding the right pattern, and he begins to find himself surrounded by logarithmic spirals, and in some very unexpected ways.  <br />Forget about trying to say what this story is about, because the movie is about EVERYTHING; it is layered, intertwined and complex, but its messages can be interpreted so simply, it indeed deserves such a simple title.<br />Think about this: after having watched the movie, you can see that only Max was able to understand the number because he could see 'between' the numbers; he could see the entire hidden and intricate meaning behind it. Is there a meaning, or a message, behind this movie? Almost certainly, but one can only understand it if they can see all the facets of this movie (Max's growing insanity, the stock market, the Torah, consciousness, and so on) and be able to connect them. <br />And that is what I say, with no offense or pretension, to anyone who didn't like this movie. Please see it again. I get more out of it every time.
B00004XONN|5.0|a telltale sign that Radiohead are still on good terms with their muse:  they've managed to lure about half of their fans into otherworldly bliss, and completely alienate the other half.  folks, a muse is not a statue, and an artist is not a vending machine.  art is not static, art is more like a story:  it's always going somewhere, heading somewhere.  thom yorke, in the albums heart-wrenching opener, sounds like he's not only heading there, he's even passing himself on the way back (note the forward/backward theme in the vocal samples).  bend your ear a little &amp; you'll be amazed.
B00002Z88D|5.0|This album is very cool. I was expecting absolute trash from this cd set because of recent reviews posted on amazon but as I was expecting the people were wrong. Heck buy all the metallica albums and dont read the reviews these days. Metallica without question is the best Metal Band ever! People are just eating metallica up because of this napster issue. I think people need to grow up a bit and learn that it is not the band themselves thats important, its the music. Buy this album, approach it with an open mind and enjoy the ride of your life.
0380715430|3.0|'The Mother Tongue' is an entertaining book with many interesting anecdotes only vaguely related to language.  But then again, Mr. Bryson never pretended that his book was supposed to be anything else.  Where the book falters, however, is on the point of factual accuracy.  There are many, many errors in this book - some of them minor (spelling mistakes), while others are major (claiming other languages have no thesauri).  Most of these things were probably wrong in the primary literature he read, but there is really no need to perpetuate these mistakes.  This book should be read with a pinch of salt.
0780631684|2.0|Okay...don't get me wrong, the movie was pretty good, but I wouldn't buy it.  It was kind of dry - the best thing about the movie was the beginning and the whole plane crash &quot;VISION&quot; that Devon Sawa's character had.  The acting was either too flat, or too dramatic.... One thing about this movie was they told you who was going to die before they actually did, so you weren't really surprised, &amp; another ANNOYING thing was how these guys reacted towards there friends getting killed.  Heads getting chopped off, a friend getting splattered into pieces by a bus, all happening in front of them and aside from a few gasps and shocked faces, the next scene its like they really didn't give a crap. Another was these really pathetic FBI agents that were following Devon's character around, and the fact that he REPEATEDLY kept trying to save his friends who were suppose to be next on the &quot;list&quot; to get killed all the while making himself look like he actually killed them when the FBI agents showed up.  My suggestion is definitely RENT the movie first so you can see if you like it...if you do - Buy it! :) It was a fun movie to watch and had an interesting story line but after awhile it got really unrealistic and annoying!
B00004XQP4|1.0|Where are the big huge guitars on this record?? Where's the creativity and interesting music that made up Green Day's other CD's?? Who is this band on &quot;warning&quot;??? Whoever it is they are  &quot;warning&quot; you not to buy this CD, because you will be as disappointed as I am. This album is a bomb.
0767903854|5.0|We Australians are a pretty insecure lot, we are always very wary of how our country is being portrayed overseas. I personally got up late at night during the Olympics to see what the 'NBC Today Show' coverage from Sydney was like. Naturally when I heard that Bill Bryson's 'Sunburned Country' was doing well overseas I had to see what it had to say.<br />I must say I thoroughly enjoyed the read and oftentimes was bursting with pride (as well as laughter) at what Bryson wrote. Very rarely does anyone really get inside this country and tell people what it is all about - Bryson does it in this book. We get sick of the constant Aussie steriotypes being sent overseas - Kangaroos and Crockodile Dundee. Bryson goes beyond this and really digs deep into the country, its people, its history, and its culture.
B0000047CX|5.0|I probably own less that 30 CD's/albums, so I am the most casual of listeners.  Nevertheless, even I can tell that this recording simply is the coolest sound ever captured.  Ms. Gilberto's voice is a little thin at times, but that is the ONLY negative one can possibly come up with. If, as you listen to these achingly cool tones, you can't envision an intimate smokey coffee house with close tables and a few couples dancing, you're just not listening closely enough!
B00004XQ8H|5.0|Lisa della Casa's recording of the Four Last Songs has been a part of my life for the past twenty years; and in my book it beats all the competition, past, present and (probably) future.  It may not be your perfect rendition, because one's response to a voice is such a personal, unpredictable thing; but it is certainly mine.  Della Casa's shimmering, silvery soprano soars radiantly above the lush, romantic orchestration; and even after many, many times of listening to this disc, I still find something new in it.  I never get tired of it, and it never fails to move me.  The excerpts from Arabella are also excellent, although not as well recorded as the Four Last Songs.  However, they reward repeated listening, and they preserve della Casa's celebrated interpretation of Arabella (her most famous stage role).  Even if you have heard other interpreters of the Four Last Songs, and have your own favourite, please give this a try.  For sheer tonal beauty, it cannot be beaten.
B00004YRQA|5.0|Yes, you will be able to save games with your old memory card. The only thing though is that it wont save or load as fast as the newer one. Remember, all playstation equipment is compatible  with the PS2. You don't really need the card at the launch if you do have an older card since I really don't think game saves will be using that much memory for saving as of yet. If ever there would be a game using alot of memory for saves, it would have to be Dead or Alive: Hardcore since you can save a battle it self.  But hey, if you do have the money for it, by all means, buy it. It does save much faster than older memory cards.
0807281751|4.0|My nine-year old wanted to get a copy of Harry Potter because it was all the rage. I bought the book for him, which was supposed to be written for his grade level. I found he had a terrible time with the names. We ended up buying the cassette, and reading the book a long with the audio tape. This made it much more pleasant to read, but it is not the most economical way to enjoy the story. Next time we may just go for the tape.
B00004WGAI|5.0|If you've read the book, this version will not disappoint.  With very few changes, the screenplay follows what Bronte wrote.  I've owned the VHS version since the late 1980s, believe it or not, and I still get drawn into the story each and every time I watch it.  I wish they'd hurry and release this on DVD!! <br />Timothy Dalton is superb as Mr. Rochester and I couldn't wish for a better Jane Eyre than what is portrayed by Zelah Clarke.  Actors in these roles before and after this version are to be commended for portraying such wonderful characters, but it's the script that makes the movie.  Seeing how Orson Welles changed the story to fit his ideas made it unbearable to watch.  The mid-90s movie release, starring William Hurt, and the recent A&amp;E production (with one of my favorite actors, Ciaran Hinds) have not impressed me because of their screenplays.  Do yourselves a favor--get the BBC production with Dalton &amp; Clarke.  You'll be glad you did!
6305922756|5.0|Finally, one of my favorite movies is done justice and released on DVD.  The transfer is excellent, especially the clarity of the on-screen location titles.  What's impressive is the quantity/quality of the excised footage.  If you're like me and have seen this movie enough times that you've memorized the dialogue, watch it on DVD with the commentary track 'on'.  It adds another humorous element to an already funny movie.  This one is definitely a keeper!
B00004XONN|4.0|OK I'll tell the truth...I didn't read all 580 or so previous reviews...but I read enough to read things like &quot;No one has EVER made an album that sounds like this. EVER.&quot; Well, if such writers are 18 or so, I'll forgive 'em...but Brian Eno was making music like this ALL throughout the mid-70s and into the 80s: with Robert Fripp, with David Byrne (My Life in the Bush of Ghosts comes to mind), and then his whole Ambient series, which at the time was truly radical. That said, I completely like Kid A. I liked it from the first listen, and it's been around 8 listens now and yes there are actually songs on it. I don't know what the frig it's about, but that's another story entirely. (My apologies to those whose sentiments I've duplicated...like I said, I couldn't read through ALL the entries.)
0786889284|4.0|Ridley Pearson lights another burning success with this book about unexplained serial arsons in Seattle.  More than just a plot driven mystery, Pearson develops further the interesting and complex web of characters he has introduced to readers in other Lou Boldt series.<br />The story begins a bit slowly until it suddenly ignites into a fully engaging read.  Police psychologist Daphne Matthews seemed a bit brittle in this novel but other characters expand and glow.  The story itself taught me things I did not know I wanted to know about firefighting and arsonists - the sign of an excellent author!<br />Ignore your mundane tasks and blaze through this visit to  Pearson's world of crime fighting with very human characters fighting demons both within and outside the psyche.
B000001DQI|5.0|Its hard to relate to those people who feel that there is alot of excess on this record.  Seventeen tracks and hardly a stinker amongst the pack.  Whereas Funeral For A Friend/Love Lies Bleeding may be creepy to some, Elton has rarely been more creative on another piece of music than on this overture.  Candle In The Wind has some beautiful touching lyrics.  My fave, This Song Has No Title works for me as it offers goregous piano runs, soothing vocals, and lyrics that yearn for pleasant things.  All in the span of a couple of minutes.  There are so many other delightful touches whether it be the dance hop Your Sister Can't Twist, the rollicking All The Young Girls Love Alice, and the regaae flavored Jamaica Jerkoff.  What about the title track single and Bennie And The Jets?  Like I said before, its hard to find a bad tune and the styles blend quite nicely.  So pick this one up today, OK?
B00003CXFU|5.0|I was genuinely surprised to find Julia Roberts, who is difficult not to enjoy in any movie, immersing herself into the role of Erin -- her entire body language is different, as is her demeanor. She deserves an Oscar nod for this rousing movie, which only sporadically becomes a Hollywood-ish version of the truth.  The story, mostly true, is richly compelling, as are the characters of Erin, Ed (her boss, deftly played by an older, jollier Albert Finney) and George (Erin's too-good-to-be-true biker boyfriend, who is dashingly handsome beneath the ponytail).  For all of her alarmingly, and entertainingly over the top costumes, Julia's personal beauty has never radiated with as many layers as it does in this terrific story of a &quot;nobody&quot; who has the guts, determination, pride and smarts to take on the Establishment in a big way.  Her natural warmth works spectacularly well with the sad victims she tends to; the movie as a whole makes you want to cheer!
B00000ILBK|4.0|&quot;Insurrection&quot; is an uplifting adventure full of romance and humor.  In fact it's the best Trek film since Nimoy's Voyage Home.
0767817729|4.0|Unlike most of Kevin Costner's other movies, Revenge demonstrates that he can truly touch audiences with authentic emotional output. The final five minutes of this movie are so genuinely real, so demonstrative of redemption and despair, that one wonders why Costner can't reproduce this in some of his other movies. Maybe it's the musical score (which, depressingly, was never made into a soundtrack). Perhaps it's Stowe's final &quot;I love you,&quot; or perhaps it's the look on Costner's face while he holds her lifeless body in his arms. All I know is, I've rarely beheld such an emotional scene in any other movie. Yes, the movie is violent. But the violence is not senseless. It has purpose, and demonstrates the danger of crossing the barriers of fidelity.<br />One other scene stands out in my mind. When Costner and Stowe try to make lemonade in his bungalow, the sexual tension is unbelievably real. <br />One of my all-time favorite movies.
B00003XACV|5.0|american beauty, which despite its somewhat cliched characters and overwrought satire, was a film well worth the price of a movie ticket. the true highlight is the score, which i purchased after hearing &quot;dead already&quot; in the movie's trailer. many of the tracks are busy (&quot;root beer&quot;, &quot;spartanette&quot;), and may not be pleasant to the ears of traditional soundtrack buffs. but it is tracks like these that set american beauty apart, giving it a raw simplistic earthen feel. newman always manages to tap into the right emotional veins for the movies he scores, but american beauty is a new trick up his sleeve: the ultimate condensation of his percussion skills, and the purest union a score could have with the actions and words of a film.
B00004XONN|5.0|This album is a huge departure from radiohead's earlier work. The music is a lot more calm than before and the guitars and bass have been replaced by electronic music and organs on many of the songs. This album is very experimental and i respect radiohead for doing their own thing and not going more towards the mainstream.  I am a huge fan of everything by radiohead and think that this album is brilliant.  I don't think that it is for everyone though. If you like songs like meeting in the isle and stuff off the 'Airbag/How Am I Driving' Ep then you should like this. Overall the album is very sad but beautiful at the same time and Thom York's vocals are wonderful as always.
B00003CWOL|1.0|I guess maybe, with only a PhD, I'm not sophisticated enough.  Reading the other reviews, I get the impression that I should have been paying attention to the hidden, deeper message of this movie. All that apparently went right over my head.  I couldn't get past the incessant use of the F-word, and the concept of prophets of God whose main goal is to get a blow job.  I found myself amazed that actors with the credentials of Damon and Affleck would allow themselves to be associated with such junk.  I don't know the other actors (who seemed to be familiar to other reviewers), nor do I know the director.  What I know now is whose works to avoid in the future.<br />Jack
B00004XONN|5.0|who looked under the cd tray?  Yep, I pulled apart the cd case, and there was a nifty little book! Anyway, I really enjoyed the album, and i suppose those who didn't were disagreeable on the basis of ideological issues.  I assume that Radiohead decided to make some music without consulting the handy &quot;how to make music&quot; checklist (&quot;ok, guitar? check! verse? check! chorus? check! catchy hook? check!&quot;), and well, i guess some people are just not going to be into that.  I bet there's a sarcastic &quot;sorry&quot; for you all coming from the people who really dig this new album, which includes me!  Not to scoff though, but having been exposed to jazz and minimalism (yes i do own albums by Glass, et al!) this music doesn't sound strange or even &quot;challenging&quot; to me, it just sounds great! it's among the most thoughtful music ever to be released under the guise of pop music in quite a long time, and amen to any group which can expose pop fans to a little envelope pushing!  I especially loved the horns of &quot;the national anthem,&quot; which seemed more than a little sun ra (!) influenced, and as far as the &quot;ambient&quot; &quot;electronica,&quot; geez, could these two terms possibly be more overused? Just cause a song has a real subdued ambiance doesnt make it &quot;ambient.&quot;  and contrary to the trend, electronic or triggered drums and/or synths does not necissarily = electronica.
B000021Y77|5.0|I thoroughly enjoy movies that handle their multidimensionality with casual grace.  Run Lola Run is in every way wonderful without in any way seeming to try.  The plot is engaging, fast paced, well written, and packed with enough detail to bring you back again and again.  While a viewer might easily enjoy the film simoply on the basis of the staccato story line, it might also be savored for its thorough and precise treatment of Nietzche's concept of eternal return.  Triggering thoughts in me similar to those experienced while reading Milan Kundera's &quot;Unbearable Lightness of Being&quot; I was pleasingly surprised by the true exactitude of the plot.  Not a word, a shot, an image, or a second is wasted.
B000002LRX|5.0|I worked at a new and used CD store for 7 years and this CD came in used only 11 times in that period.  That says something right there.  This album changed my life.  I went out and bought it on the day of the release.  It is still in my car to date.  Never had an artist blown me away like that before. Mike Patton is still my favourite performer.  He is a cryptic genious.  This album will take you through every emotion possible.  The dynamics are insane and the songwriting is nothing short of pure excellence.  If you look back on the 90's and think about getting something you never owned.....do yourself a favour and get this.  Support the band and support Mr. Bungle!!!
0767815343|4.0|Midnight Express is the true story of Billy Hayes who is thrown into a turkish prison for trying to smuggle hash out of the country.During the five years he spends in the prison,he suffers emotional,physical and mental torment.The prison is run by a brutal guard played by Paul Smith who seems to have a good time beating the prisoners which makes him a symbol of cruelty.Among with Brad Davis' great performance as Billy Hayes is John Hurt and Randy Quaid who both deliver really great performances as well.Brad Davis I think was overlooked by the academy which surprised me because he displayed his character with so much emotion that you had to feel sorry not just for his character but also for him.Midnight Express is the kind of prison film that makes other prison films too hard to compare.The Shawshank Redemption was also a film I enjoyed but wasn't as gut wrenching or emotional as this film.Midnight Express is in my opinion a film that is too horrifying to ignore which means that this film  should not be ignored.It shouldn't be watched for entertainment value.That isn't why this film was made.Midnight Express I highly recommend.
B00001MXXG|5.0|I am a teenager and I love Ferris Buellers Days Off!! &quot;But don't get it and expect your kids to love it the way you did.&quot; Keith Simanton. Whatever, I love this movie, it is a classic teen flick and will always attract audiences. I have found that most teenagers enjoy this film as much as I do.
B000021Y77|5.0|There are already enough reviews of the excellent film and the acting Franka Potente, so I'm going to focus on the DVD itself.<br />And that said, this is a DVD that is worth owning.  The transfer is of very high quality.  And considering that the film is running at such a fast pace with images being thrown in and out of the camera's view, the high quality transfer really is essential to the film.  Even if the film was bad (and I think the other reviews can convince you that it isn't), the transfer is done so well that it allows you to marvel at the wonders of DVD (and make you happy that you haven't used that old VCR in quite some time).<br />But the transfer quality pales in comparison to the sound in Run Lola Run.  And whomever made Run Lola Run onto DVD was kind enough to take into consideration that not everybody has a full surround sound setup just yet.  So the film is made in both 2.0 and 5.1 for both English and German.  It's amazing how many films don't do this.  The 2.0 sound is actually good enough to sound better than some poorly made DVD's with 5.1.  But Run Lola Run's 5.1 sound is excellent.  I'd imagine you'd have to be a fan of the techno beats in Run Lola Run to really appreciate it, but if you're at least a little bit into the music, you'll love being right in the middle of the sound as it does take advantage of the rear speakers quite a bit.  I'd strongly recomend using the subtitles and listening to the German 5.1 over the English 5.1.  The English 5.1 sounds just fine, but the German is clearly better.<br />The special features are good, but not great.  The commentary with director Tykwer and Potente is better than most.  At least it is for an American not fully familiar with German cinema -- the commentary gives you some insight as to how films are made on the other side of the pond.  The music video is neat, but I can't imagine watching it more than a couple of times.<br />When my friends look at my collection of DVD's and ask me why I'm &quot;wasting&quot; my money on them when I have several of the movies on tape, Run Lola Run is one of the DVD's that I'll pop in to show them what DVD can really do.  A strongly recommended purchase -- especially for those who own high quality systems.
B00003CXE6|5.0|This movie ROCKS! Very realistic! Would be good without graphic violence (not that I don't like mind it)! You gotta see this movie!

B00004XONN|5.0|After the long wait we finally hae it here, the new album by Radiohead. This album is one of the best i've ever heard in my life. Radiohead has just created a new stile of music. You have to listen to this album with an open mind and really feelling every note.  Every time i hear this record I shiver. This is a real work of art. They should put it in a museum.
B00004XQP4|2.0|I am a huge Green day fan, and i am dissapointed with their new album. There is no punk in it, it is very soft and sort of like pop music. I am sad to say that they are no longer the kings of Punk music.
0440219078|5.0|I can't believe that woman/man thought that this book was sick! PLEASE!  I mean, this could actually happen to us. That person said that this encourages violence and other bad things-well I think this book teaches children that violence and hurting others are bad. I mean, this book may have been graphic, but I believe that children (preferrably over 10) should read this book. It really teaches you to value the life you have. Okay, that was my outburst, but here is my summary of the book (which I myself have read 6 times)!<br />The main character is Jonas. He lives in a world of routine and order-and no feelings. No one is allowed to choose there spouse or even have there own child! And the community picks there job (a.k.a. &quot;Assignment&quot;) Jonas is chosen as the reciever of memories. Now you see, the people can't feel anytning, good or bad, and they all have one generation memories. Which means thay only remember stuff that has happened since they were born. Like how we learn about war and stuff, they don't. They have no colors, music, and climate. Anyways, the reciever holds all of the memories from the past-good and bad. ALthought the good ones are great (such as LOVE, CHRISTMAS, and SNOW) the bad memories (such as WAR, RELEASE, and PAIN) really make the job hard. And no one knows anything about feelings because they don't allow them to feel them. Anyways, Jonas and the Giver decided on a plan to fix this. So......read the book to find out the rest, and I promise you that you won't be disappointed. I know that despite what others said, this book is a positive one and truly makes you think about right and wrong.
B00004XMVL|3.0|There are quite a lot of new movies that try to copy the emotional hi of Alien. But this one was a cheap try. The story and dialog were fairly good, costumes lacked common sense in space exploration.....
B00004HYLF|5.0|You need more stars to review this album. This all star line-up of Al,Stanley,Lenny, and of course Mr. Corea, are enough to make you see those extra stars flying around your head in amazement. This paricular album is sort of weird so you have to be open minded, but if I were going to describe the musicianship that takes place on this album, I would say that its Virtuoso to the 16th power thats four counts of Virtuoso for each member!
6304383827|3.0|The  only way in which this film is better than the TV version is in the casting of Gwyneth Paltrow as Emma. Emma is an exceptional character and an exceptional actress was needed to play her. But,   apart from her, the film suffers from a whole series of deplorable miscastings and whoever was responsible for the casting can surely not have read the novel. Mark Strong as Mr Knightley in the TV version is  infinitely to be preferred to Jeremy Northam. Mr Knightley is a responsible, serious-minded, authoritative figure and is described by Jane Austen as having a \\"downright, decided, commanding sort of manner.\\", a world away from the light-weight charmer as portrayed by Jeremy Northam, who, good actor though he is, had not the height or physical presence the role calls for. Ewan MacGregor is also badly miscast in the role of Frank Churchill, who is supposed to be suave and sophisticated. Ewan MacGregor is anything but that. <br />However, the worst piece of miscasting  by far is that of Toni Collette in the role of Harriet; she is too physically large for the role. Jane Austen refers to the character as \\"little Harriet\\" and describes her as a \\"humble, grateful  little girl\\". And I must say Samantha Morton, who took the role in the TV adaption, was absolutely perfect in the part.<br />But the film as a whole was too romanticised and idealised. I am not willing to believe that people  ever lived like that. Whereas the authenticity of the TV adaption was remarkable. It was like looking through a window into the 19th century. I felt - this is the way it must have been.
B00000IPAX|5.0|I'll admit i'm not a punk listener to begin with. But this cd completely captivates my attention from beginning to end. No other cd has ever had more playing time in my stereo. Fast drumming, awesome riffs, quality vocals, and memorable songs undoubtably make this a classic. For everyone thats compaining that this album isnt true punk,,,who cares!!!! Blink 182 redefined thier own style and went beyond paradigms. Critics could categorize this as country and it still wouldnt take anything away from this effort! Blink 182 Rules!!
0790736233|5.0|I have read many books by Carl Sagan and his original TV series (Cosmos) was superb. Although he was a very scientific person and didn't buy the believe of faith, in this movie we see the man behind the mask revealing a story of cosmic proportion. The question to you - the viewer - is, are you ready?
0060283122|2.0|I don't have a problem with the book being about unfortunate events - in fact it was the very reason why I picked up the book in the first place, because the premise seemed interesting.<br />However, the book has some very dark undertones which I consider inappropriate for a very young audience.<br />Firstly, the marriage between Violet and her Uncle smacked of incest, though he was a cousin several time removed.  Did no one else find it repulsive?  And then all his greasy friends touching her and saying overtly sexual things like you're a pretty one ... creepy.  <br />Secondly, the degree of violence in the book is very high.  The part where Klaus is hit right across the face, till his face is marked, is a bit strong.  Someone else I spoke to said that they felt that the author actually enjoyed showing the violent parts, including hanging a baby out from a tower.  I can't say with regards to that, but I do admit finding it disturbing that this is a &quot;children's book&quot;.<br />&quot;Unfortunate events&quot; are one thing, everyone knows that the premise of a good story is unfortunate events happening to the hero and heroine, but events bordering on the sadistic are another.  Perhaps the children of today can take it (I have seen a couple of kids' reviews that have liked it) but I think mothers might like to read through the book first, and decide whether they want their kids to read it.<br />I gave it 2 stars because I was entertained by the story to some extent.
B00004SCX6|2.0|I wanna nail  her as much as the next guy but her music is weak.First of a rolling stones cover,that is more funny than sad Oh well at least she has all those pic's in rolling stones.Oh yeah and her Vma performance.Woo Woo
B000001EHS|4.0|Def Leppard's Vault is the great introduction to get to know one of the greatest bands on earth.If you are constantly seeking American Top 40 hits and love melodic hard rock it is a must-buy album for your collection.<br />Opening track choice of Pour Some Sugar On Me from Hysteria is superb!! And opening five tracks well represent pop aspect of this band. So in 80s side it is 100 % all right. But 90s side sounds weak compared with 80s great tracks. Seeming like they peaked during 80s and fading in the 90s. This was proved wrong by their great recent album Euphoria.I do not think the choice of 90s hits well represents 90s Def Leppard. It sounds skin deep. To get to know 90s Def Leppard it might be better to buy their original albums and sure I will do.
0671027344|3.0|I found this book rather humorous and interesting, however, I would not say that it's a favorite.  I would recommend it to any teenager, mainly because it deals with a high school freshmen and the twists and turns of a teenagers life.  It's written in a strange format that you basically have to get used to.  In the beginning, I couldn't find myself interested all that much.  The guys grammar was absolutely horrible, but it was that way for a reason.  After a while it does get better, along with the book!  I did enjoy the book, but I often felt confused.
B00004Z4WR|1.0|First off this movie is a remake of  a chip's wannabe cheesy 70's action movie.2nd Nick Cage is playing the exact same charecter from Con AIR just with a less funny name.3rd since this movie is pg13 you know Angelina Jolie will be fully clothed the whole time
B0000025IE|4.0|I don't really know how to describe it but I'd have to say that &quot;Rapid Fire&quot;,&quot;Breaking the Law&quot; and Steeler are the best songs on there. I'd probably pick Rapid Fire as my fav. It's fast and powerful and Prieset's guitar solos are awesome.
B00003CXDG|5.0|For John Woo fans out there, no introduction into the Woo style of cinematography is required.  MI2 is easily John Woo's best direction in a film, and probably his second best movie only to Hard Boiled.  Where MI2 departs from Woo's previous accomplishments is that gone are the corny male bonding scenes and stunt driven plots in favor of a true emotionally driven action-adventure film.  MI2 is the kind of film that Bruckheimer has been trying to make for years.  MI2 is bare of all the gushy, contrived action film emotions in favor of a naturalistic approach to real-persons super-agent Ethan.  Expect the most fluid camera work and the most stunning visuals you've ever seen in a true &quot;action&quot; film.
6305736650|5.0|I love this movie I remember thinking it would not be good in English class but boy was I wrong.That Bogart guys voice is funny.I like when Peter Brady did his voice on the brady bunch.I can here  it right now,PORK Chops and Applesauce
B00000JCOV|1.0|Slipknot is the most awful band I've ever heard in my life.  Everyone fruity metal kid owns a slipknot shirt.  Slipknot rips off every metal bands style.  I went to a slipknot show, (only to see MACHINE HEAD) , and they sucked.  Everyone was moshing like football players.  It was so gay.  Don't buy this cd. Thank You.
B00004XONN|5.0|I just read a customer review of this album that referred to it as pretentious and suggested that this sort of music should be left to the likes of Glass, Adams, and Reich.  The reviewer went on to smugly assume that the fans of this album would have no idea who these composers are.  Having listened to numerous recordings of Glass, Adams' &quot;Nixon in China&quot; and a live Steve Reich concert when he was the artist in residence at my college, I can very happily say that Radiohead has (in my opinion) succeeded where the post-modernists have not.  This is based on my premise that the fundament of art is aesthetic beauty.  The academic composers mentioned above are all highly trained, highly intelligent men who have sought to bring down the barriers of Western art music by introducing rhythms and sounds that they either created or coopted from other, radically different musical forms.  The mistake that they make (which is a mistake shared by Aphex Twin, Mu-Ziq, and even Squarepusher who can be so brilliant at times) is that in their obsessive drive to challenge conventions and undermine established notions of beauty, they often make ugly, even unlistenable work.<br />Onto Radiohead's Kid A.  This is a challenging album.  It represents as great a departure from their previous work as each successive album of their's has been.  You will probably not get it on the first few listens, but you will probably not hate it either.  If you are a fan of OK Computer, you know how delightfully slow and long the journey can be to fully appreciate their work.  Stick with it.  This is not an album that tries to undermine aesthetic beauty.  It is a thoroughly beautiful work from start to finish, and the more you listen to it, the fewer notes seem to be out of place, until eventually you can swallow the entire album and appreciate it in it's remarkably sophisticated, deeply human, and utterly revolutionary totality.  Radiohead has ventured into unknown territory and instead of seemingconfused and insane (like Aphex Twin et al do all too often), they sound confident and mature.<br />The Post-Modernists decided that everything was equally relevant and made bad art to prove their point.  As an artistic movement it was a farce, a cricle jerk practised by academic elitists and dilettantes.  They have overrun academia with their wilfull denial of beauty, truth, and history.  Radiohead is not severing itself from musical history, but writing a remarkable new chapter in it.  There is old Radiohead here, along with influences from the Beatles, Pink Floyd, DJ Shadow, Aphex Twin, etc.  There is such a thing as aesthetic beauty and we have not even come close to exhausting its possibilites.  <br />Here's to Radiohead.  You are true artists.
0393317552|4.0|I find the book very comprehensive and easy to read. Mr Diamond does not try to hide under so called Christian Superiority, but lays bare all the scientific facts. His approach is way different from others on this topic. As other reviewers have pointed out that his conclusion is not new. But his way of taking you through all the clues of history is un-paralled. He wrote about touchy subjects like race without raising any dispute. Some has said that he has omitted religion and european zest for discovery in this book. Well, this is scientific book and not a Arabian Nights' Tales. In all, a superb book and must read for any student of history.
0375704027|4.0|I don't know why people are using such esoteric language to refer to a book that was so simple and straightforward.<br />Honesly, it really showed me that feelings of alienation or displacement aren't just an American phenomenon. Not everyone is happy and you just have to live with whatever comes your way.<br />Maybe I would think it was brilliant if I wasn't an Asian male.
B00004U9MS|5.0|Well, having read the detailed analyses of the music moguls below, I had to throw in my two cents' worth.  Endless comparisons and arguments over who is copying who are beside the point.  For anyone who likes thoughtful and intelligent modern music, this is a great album to listen to.  The songs are varied in style, the vocals display such range that I initially thought the band had more than one singer, and the arrangments are always intriguing. A superb record, overall. There's not a duff track on it. For me, the stand-out is &quot;Trouble.&quot;  I do agree with the reviewer below who says this CD sends a message to &quot;alternative&quot; radio stations this side of the Atlantic to stop playing interchangeable clone bands and start broadening their musical horizons.  There's so much more out there.  Anyway, buy Coldplay and you won't be disappointed.
B00004XONN|2.0|It is simple. 'Kid a' is disappointing. It is not that I expect the same 'Ok computer' (a masterpiece) over and over again, in fact I am very much in favour of experiment and changes. But let's be honest: this album is too pretentious, very dull and lacks any real atmosphere. <br />Kid a has a couple of good songs like 'How to disappear completely' and 'The national anthem', but these songs are also infected with the problem that can be heard all over this album: dull and repetitive arrangements. I like this style of music if it is used in one or two songs (like it was done on 'Ok Computer', 'Fitter happier'). 'Everything in its right place' is a very good example on 'Kid a' and really stands out as a beautiful piece of music. <br />'But this is ambient music and it is in the same league of Pink Floyd and other classics; you have to listen to it for a while to appreciate it', people point out in their reviews. I don't think so. In my opinion 'Kid a' is about being very eager on being different en intelligent just for the sake of it! <br />A shame, another band that does not deliver the goods!
B000002BPS|5.0|Let it be said that I am a HUGE fan of Offspring, so my review might not be the most unbiased. However, I think it's not too hard to make a case for this CD, regardless of fandom. The Offspring have come on an amazing journey over the years. They started out in the punk/indie scene, debuting with their self-titled album. Then they took a step forward with Ignition, moving into the more mainstream crowd. In my mind, Smash was a step backward (not in quality; it truly rocked); the songs clearly were more of the punk vibe. Dexter and company honed their style to a more rock oriented audience with this album, and have since completed a mainstream turn with Americana. But this album, in my eyes, truly catches them at the very point dead center between punk and rock, and the result is amazing. Some of the songs are still of the cynical, sarcastic mode, like &quot;Mota&quot; and &quot;Me and My Old Lady&quot;, and at least one downright lampoons the attitude of negativity (&quot;Cool to Hate&quot;). On the other hand, there's a hint of pop in the CD with &quot;I Choose&quot;, and &quot;Don't Pick It Up&quot;. But the best songs on this piece of plastic, in my opinion, are &quot;Gone Away&quot;, and &quot;Amazed&quot;, where The Offspring truly capture emotions and play them out in two very melodic, very moving tracks that I have listened to night in and night out. Dexter, Noodles, etc. made their statement here: we want to walk the line between punk and rock. This CD exemplifies that statement triumphantly.
B00004XONN|5.0|I would expect this to be a love or hate album, and the reviews so far confirm this. If you want radio friendly tunes, forget it, do not buy this album. If you want something that challenges you at every note, buy it immediately. I predict that in 20 years time, many trendy young bands will be declaring Radiohead to be a prime influence in much the same way many bands speak of the Velvet Underground today (even though half of them don't listen to it). My tastes mainly lay with artists such as Scott Walker, Laurie Anderson, Mitchell Froom, My Bloody Valentine, etc. If you appreciate these artists, I strongly suggest you try this album. It's a classic, it just will take a few years to be recognised as such - an album years ahead of its time.
B000001IPL|5.0|While I find the rock/punk amalgam of Ixnay to be the best album The Offspring has produced, this one truly caught them at their punk/alternative best. Back in 1994, I listened to classical music...only. When my friend brought Dookie over, I poo-pooed it as garbage. I said I wanted a real reason to like mainstream music. This album gave me one. I have since become a huge Offspring fan. This album took punk and said, &quot;Now why don't you poppy teens like it?&quot; The response was an overhwhelming, &quot;WE DO!&quot; The singles are surprisingly NOT mainstream rock. &quot;Come Out and Play&quot;, a sarcastic look at school violence, shows how truly amazing it is that The Offspring has made it big. The other singles, &quot;Self Esteem&quot;, and &quot;Gotta Get Away From Me&quot; are somewhat more mainstream in nature, but...oh well. With other tracks to soothe the punk urges such as the opening &quot;Nitro&quot;, the guiltless &quot;Innocent&quot;, and the cry of teen angst &quot;Smash&quot;, the band has made a showing of great proportions. If you are anyone who likes modern music, there isn't any reason not to like this album or this band.
B00004XONN|5.0|I've never heard OK Computer, The Bends, or any of Radiohead's previous releases. I've always been quite content writhing in my room to Morrissey, Eno, or Bowie. This album is something i've been waiting a long time for, however, and it fills me with the same images that hearing 'Radioactivity' (Kraftwerk) conjured. The ultimate task, in this form of music anyway, is to provoke images of some sort inside people. I've always felt this about other things - Morrissey has touched me deeply (Ooh er, missus), Eno has created great calm in me, and bowie...well, everyone loves Bowie. But I digress. This CD is one of those; one of the few things that truly deeply affects me, makes me wish everyone in the whole world could appreciate it in the way I do. We've people reviewing it left, right and centre on Amazon, and many have said things I can agree with, but what depresses me are the people giving it 1 star and saying &quot;Bring back the beatles&quot; and suchlike. I'm sure the beatles were very good, I used to love them when I was younger (10) but these days I am affected so much more by this sort of music. It's just wonderful, and some people truly need to realise there is more to music than melodies. The words don't need to make sense, they need to make you feel. What a load of pretentious twaddle.<br />I urge you to like this album, for your own good!
B00000DHRZ|4.0|Why did The Offspring change into this happy, pop band, instead of the punk innovators, as they have been known? Well, after flipping past &quot;Pretty Fly&quot; and &quot;Why Don't You Get a Job?&quot;, I realized they didn't. While they made me think they'd sold out by making an album with these mainstream junk tracks, I realized that they still couldn't give up that punk spirit. While &quot;Pretty Fly&quot; does give some interesting 90's commentary, the real tracks that set this album back with the rest are &quot;The Kids Aren't All Right&quot;, &quot;Walla Walla&quot; and &quot;The End of The Line&quot; (which is a rather angry version of Ixnay's &quot;Gone Away&quot;). These alone prove that despite the fact that making it big has indeed affected The Offspring, it won't kill their punk credibility. Long live The Offspring!
061300194X|4.0|A TIME TO KILL is a moving story of a young lawyer's(Jake Brigance) desire to win an unfair, prejudicial case for a black man(Carl Lee). Carl Lee's daughter got raped and beaten by two drunk white men. Carl Lee who got outraged, took matter into his own hands. Now he must put his life and trust into Jake Brigance's hands. Jake must show to the jury that Carl Lee is not guilty--even if it means risking his own and his family's life also! A TIME TO KILL will captivate you heart, and open up your mind and allow you to realize the injustice of racism. Although A TIME TO KILL is a a great book(Also a good movie!), there are parts of the book where it went by really slowly for me. It would go by really slowly because nothing would happen. There would be so much writing about one event. (example: like Jake waking up, eating breakfast, going to the office, and what he needs to do for the day or something like that) However, overall I think that this is a good book to read.
B00003CWPR|5.0|In my opinion, Stanley Kubrick's EYES WIDE SHUT is one of the best movies of the american director if not the best. I simply had to see the DVD two nights in a row because his last effort is so dense that one can not fully appreciate EYES WIDE SHUT's structure after the first viewing.<br />To present a movie that can be read at several different levels is the mark of a genuine author-director. Just take the time to read a dozen reviews about EYES WIDE SHUT and you will be astonished by the diversity of the reviewers's interpretations. And I think that all these interpretations are equally correct and must be respected. EYES WIDE SHUT is a spark that sets on fire people's imaginations.<br />Nicole Kidman, Tom Cruise and Sydney Pollack are excellent. The production design, as always in Kubrick's movies, is gorgeous and the mask reunion a moment of pure cinema during which  Kubrick is meeting Federico Fellini, another poet of the Strangeness.<br />Please note that I've seen EYES WIDE SHUT on the DVD zone 2 available at Amazon.fr. This version is slightly different from the one found on the DVD zone 1, the orgy scenes being more explicit in the european version. Above average sound and images. Interviews of Tom Cruise, Nicole Kidman and Steven Spielberg.<br />A DVD for your library.
B00004X01U|5.0|I have to say, this is the first Madonna CD I've bought in all of my 22 years.  I was hearing good things about it, and those things are correct.  This CD is so fresh,new and listenable!   And coming from a brit-pop nut/reformed metal head, this is definitely a comment.  I love it!    It seems that every CD I buy nowadays has one or two good tracks and the rest leave me disappointed.  Not this CD.  Every track is really great.  I think my personal FAVE is &quot;What It Feels Like For A Girl&quot;.   Let me just let it known that this CD is going to get a lot of &quot;spin time&quot; on my discman.  {{The best CD I've heard all year}}  Also, Madonna is so beautiful.  = )   I'd like to think that I'll look as good as she does 20 years from now!   (Actually, I wish I could look that good now! )  THANK YOU MADONNA!
0811826848|5.0|If you only buy one book on the Beatles this is the one to buy! It's a lot of fun to read and very accurate coming from the band themselves. Great photos and text.
0380804557|4.0|In fantasy writing, the quest is an established clich&eacute;.  Neil Gaiman has the enviable ability to  rise above clich&eacute;s, presenting the story of a real man in bizarre circumstances.  Although born  of a faerie mother, Tristran's only power is persistence, a quality any human can emulate.  He  seeks a fallen star, which any of us would assume would be but a bit of iron rock.  This one,  when finally retrieved, turns out to be an astral nymph of very human temperment.  Along  his way, Tristran skirts a dispute over a royal inheritance, encounters a witch of supremely  wicked deviousness and helpful gnome.  The cast is as complete as any fantasy tale.  Gaiman  manages to breathe fresh spirit into this array of characters, lifting them from the common  images often found in such tales.<br />My introduction to Gaiman was his collaboration with Terry Pratchett in Good Omens.  Without prior experience of his work, it was difficult to separate the input of each author.  This book demonstrates PTerry's wisdom in choosing Gaiman to relate that tale of  Armageddon.  Gaiman has a fine prose style and draws his characters with skill.  His wit is  excellent, demonstrated in his resolution of the problem of how to have a week of two  Mondays.  This is a fine read for young and older alike.
0811826848|4.0|The thing that makes this anthology a valuable buy is the fact that, while it doesn't contain any secrets or new information, it is incredibly comprehensive. The Beatles Anthology meticulously chronicles the world's most storied band and is fully equipped with first-person views on the band members, riveting anecdotes, and tons of pictures.<br />If you are a die-hard Beatles fan, the book comes highly recommended. If you are a casual fan looking for a single, definitive biographical volume -- this is it.
B00004SCX6|1.0|This is not meant to be taken offensively I'm just making my opinion heard.  So let me start by saying this is the worst CD I've ever heard.  I only gave it one star because there's nothing lower than that.  Her voice is high and squeaky and sounds like she has something caught in her nose.  Let me be frank.  I am NOT a Britney Spears fan.  But that didn't keep me from having an open mind about this.  I listened to it.  And only after that did I declare that it was the worst filth I've ever heard.  Oops I did it again is one of the most poppy and tacky songs I've ever heard (and what is up with the music video?)Oops I did it again is second only to Lucky, THE worst song I've ever heard.  I enjoyed Britney Spears when she first came out with Baby One More Time. But then I watched her true persona get worse and worse.  If you're looking for a good CD with excellent vocals STAY AWAY FROM THIS ONE.
0671042858|2.0|I bought this book in an airport, depending on Stephen King to get me through a multi-hour plane ride.  Imagine my disappointment.  Trekking around the woods with a young girl being chased by a not-particularly scary monster.  She keeps falling down, running the wrong way, etc.  The allusions to the family's experience while she's missing were the strongest parts of this novel, but they are momentary.  If you're a diehard Stephen King fan, get the book for your collection, then go back and read The Shining, Salem's Lot, or one of the other classics.
0684853523|5.0|Prospective novelists and fiction writers, the King of Pop Fiction has spoken! This book should be right on your shelf next to Strunk and White, another writing manual that King references often in the pages of On Writing.<br />King speaks authoritatively on his subject - as well he should, with volume after volume of best-selling fiction to his credit.  And his advice is simplicity itself: Read a lot. Write a lot.  Avoid superfluous adverbs.  Avoid passive construction.  For those familiar with the territory, nothing here is radically new, but King states it clearly and with vigor.  <br />The beginning of the book is a fascinating, funny look at how King's own career took flight.  He speaks candidly about his youth, his addictions, and his career, giving much credit to wife Tabitha for her contributions to both his writing and his sanity.  <br />King saves the most harrowing prose for the book's closing chapter, where he describes in detail the accident that almost took his life, and the role his writing has played in his recovery.<br />Like, love or loathe his fiction, you'll find a wealth of solid advice in this little book.  Would-be writers: avoid at your peril.  <br />A gem.  Buy it.  Read it.  Then read it again.  What are you waiting for?
B00004XONN|5.0|Avoid the tempation to &quot;skip around&quot;. Ignore anything you've read... anywhere. adjust your 21st Century brain to slow-motion setting. go someplace where you are completely alone. play entire disc. play again. develop opinion....   now read mine if you still feel it neccessary. This is not candy.  Very challenging.  Well worth it if you leave behind your preconceived notions of &quot;the band&quot; and your well nurtured desire for the big payoff chorus n every song.  If this album has done anything (besides make me cry) its made so much other music seem embarassingly obnoxious and bloated.  I made the mistake of reading magazine reviews before listening to this discso here are a few corrections from what I read... 1) idioteque is not a dance song, nor does it feel at all out of place on this album like Electioneering did on O.K. Computer. 2) The words to the song - Kid A are not indecipherable ... part of the excellence of this work is that it actually forces you to listen.  The Pied Piper metaphor is easy to distinguish. 3) Thom should stop doing interviews...  the music speaks, he doesn't like to ...  enough said. That last part was a bit off topic so anyway, How to disappear Completely and never be FOund is my favorite individual track. Being that I'm often too inside my head and socially phobic this makes sense, but i still recommend listening to this only in its entirety.  In a way if this music doesn't touch you I'm almost glad for you, but then again not.
B000001E18|3.0|Although a U2 fanatic,it's hard for me to share the enthusiastic comments on this record. There are a few FINE songs on Zooropa which make it worth having in your collection,but overall the album feels incomplete and some potentially great track is ruined by poor production,that is particularly unusual of Flood,one of the smartest guys in the business. The title track is a very cool song,Edge's guitar almost sounding like David Gilmour's.It also has great lyrics. Babyface sounds silly when you listen to it for the first time,but if you pay attention to the lyrics you'll find out it's not a sugary love song but a cool story about a man who falls in love with a lady he can only watch on television.The song sounds overproduced,though. I've never liked Numb and I haven't changed opinion so far. I used to detest Lemon but it's now my favourite song on this album,I love the way Bono shifts from falsetto to passionate vocals,the piano parts are beautiful too. Stay is a nice ballad but it pales when compared to One and With or Without You(and also to &quot;minor&quot; tracks on Achtung Baby),it also feels almost misplaced on this experimental record,it would have made more sense on Pop. Daddy's Gonna Pay For Your Crashed Car is halfway between fun and nonsense,it's a rather useless track in the end. Some Days Are Better Than Others is slightly more enjoyable but it gets nowhere,it doesn't grow on you at all,you'll soon forget about it. Dirty Day is a great track with a beautiful progression and an overwhelming finale,although it sounds restrained in comparison with the live version heard on Live at Sydney. The First Time is an embarassing copy of All I Want Is You,it's a smart track because you can't objectively dislike it,it has a nice piano and nice lyrics,but it's nothing more than a self quotation anyway. The Wanderer is a paradox:great lyrics and cool music but  arranged in the most awful way you could ever imagine;Figure out Johnny Cash singing a melody similar to stuff like &quot;The Long Black Veil&quot; and add funky bass and all sorts of loops...I guess the guys had too much faith in their skills when they recorded this one,they really ruined a good thing. I'm not a nostalgic freak regretting The Joshua Tree,I'm not underrating this album because I don't like electronic attempts, I like electronic when it fits the songs,unfortunately it doesn't always work out fine on this record. That said,I like Zooropa better than Pop; Pop is better produced and more immediate,but Zooropa is braver,crazier,weirder and can therefore remain interesting for longer time.

B000001FRY|4.0|I like U2's debut album much better than the largely more acclaimed War. Sure,War has Sunday Bloody Sunday,and New Year's Day,and 40...but Boy is more consistent in that all the songs on this record make sense,there's nothing to throw away,nothing useless at all. Adolescent problems never sounded more serious...Out Of Control is one of the best songs they've ever written.  Definitely recommended!
0684833395|5.0|This book had me failing in my attempts to suppress the laughter that it often evoked from me.  <br />Set in an aviation squadron in World War II, the characters' ambitions and actions are directly applicable to modern corporate America.<br />I just finished the novel and was glad to do so.  Part of the reason for this is that you never know what to expect in the novel, especially in two chapters that I won't forget any time soon and probably never will.  They weren't my favorite chapters to read, but without them the novel wouldn't have near the impact.  These chapters are for you to discover.  <br />If you figure out what ever happened to Major Major Major Major, let me know.
B000001F3C|3.0|There are several great songs on this album,as well as there are several forgettable ones. Sunday Bloody Sunday,New Year's Day and 40 need no introduction, although I largely prefer the live versions on Under A Blood Red Sky(this is especially true of &quot;Sunday&quot;). Two Hearts Beat As One is an overlooked ,only seemingly light-hearted song blending a love affair with existential doubts on which direction to take in life. Surrender might have been a majestic track but it's ruined by an excessively long musical interlude between the first 2 verses (I like musical parts but this one is plain repetitive);it's still a very good song,though. Like A Song is a hidden gem,it's lyrically and musically as good as New Year's Day,it only had the misfortune to be built on a difficult rythm to be rendered live,Larry couldn't keep the tempo and the song was subsequently dropped from the setlist of the War tour after the first show!Such a shame... The thing with War is: I love the aforementioned songs but I'm completely indifferent to the other ones. They're by no means bad songs but they simply don't grow on me. I can't help skipping Seconds and Red Light whenever I listen to the album,sometimes I try to go through Drowning Man but it gets too boring after the first minute,I think songs like Promenade (on The Unforgettable Fire)or Tomorrow(on October) are much more succesful attempts at writing atmospheric slow music. This album is worth buying for a couple of great songs not to be found on any compilation,and perhaps also because here you get the whole version of New Year's Day(which is usually performed without the last verse at live shows). It is also a valuable document of U2's first phase in their career,displaying both the best and the worst the Irish band had to offer:powerful melodies but excessive political intents,often outshadowing the music.
0811826848|5.0|This past weekend, my copy of The Beatles Anthology came from Amazon.com. The deliverer was glad she didn't have to go to the front office with it since it's so heavy!<br />This book is special because the Beatles themselves are the authors!  There are also contributing quotes from Pete Best, Stuart Sutcliffe, George Martin, Mal Evans, Neil Aspinall and others.<br />The stories are great, from their childhood (John being an avid reader in grade school, Paul's father supporting his music skills, George mastering the guitar at a young age, and Ringo being shuffled in and out of hospitals) to their days in Hamburg (John claims that's where he truly grew up!). <br />In Hamburg, John, Paul, George, Pete, and Stu play various taverns (and meet Ringo) until Stu falls in love and abandons the Beatles.  It seems like Ringo fits in better so they eventually sack Best for Ringo.<br />Funny stories include Mal breaking a windshield on a cold day while driving the Fab Four to their next gig and the Beatles hiding like school kids from an angry George Martin after missing a recording session!  <br />They meet celebrities like Fats Domino, Little Richard, the Queen, and the King (Elvis).  <br />John discusses &quot;Help&quot;, &quot;Lucy In the Sky with Diamonds&quot;, and &quot;Revolution 9&quot;, Paul discusses &quot;Yesterday&quot;, &quot;Eleanor Rigby&quot;, &quot;Yellow Submarine&quot; and the Abbey Road Medley (particularly its highlight &quot;The End&quot;), George discusses &quot;While My Guitar Gently Weeps&quot; and &quot;Taxman&quot;, and Ringo discusses &quot;Don't Pass Me By&quot; and &quot;Octopus' Garden&quot;.  <br />There are the sore subjects, too, like Manilla (Paul claims they were the 1st to snub Marcos), John's comments about Jesus, the death of Brian Epstein, the breakup coming close on the White Album and later on Let It Be.  <br />Although some of the photos and interviews here can be seen and heard in the Anthology video series and some perhaps read in other books, this brings most everything you need to know about the Beatles in full circle.  <br />And of course, the Beatles experiment with drugs (and later both John and George get  busted by Sgt. Pilcher for possession of them), seek spiritual guidance from the Maharishi (is he as &quot;cosmic&quot; as they think?), fall in love (John with Yoko, Paul with Linda).  Unlike in the video series, there is mention of Paul being &quot;dead&quot; and the final nail in the coffin for the Beatles in late 1969 and 1970.  <br />You can't tell it all even in this one (no mention of the Christmas singles, save for a poem by John called &quot;Wonsapon a Pool Table&quot;), but since the Beatles themselves (and their closest comrades) speak for the Beatles, a lot of myths and legends are put to rest.  If you're a Beatles fan, you won't want to pass this by!
B00000JG41|5.0|For anyone who has grown tired of the boring structure of modern music, there is hope.  The answer to your prayers is Mr. Bungle. I've been a Faith No More fan for a few years now and can't seem to get enough of Mike Patton's distinct vocal style.  Though this cd is not for all FNM fans, it does offer a wide variety of musical genres.  This cd combines equal parts metal, jazz, 60's pop, and adds a dash of latin influence to leave the listener with one of the best albums of all time.  This cd is definitely a must have for anyone who is bored with music today.  If you go to sleep at night feeling empty inside, it is undoubtedly because you do not yet own this cd.  Also check out anything by Faith No More, the other two Mr Bungle releases, Fantomas, Mike Patton solo, etc.
0887306667|1.0|Webster's Dictionary defines &quot;immutable&quot; as &quot;not capable of, or susceptible to, change.&quot; One would think then that immutable laws of marketing should be fundamental principles of marketing. They should be like physics concepts such as gravity and inertia, that are true regardless of whether we like them or not, apply equally to all situations, and helps us make sense of the world. <br />In &quot;The 22 Immutable Laws of Marketing: Violate Them at Your Own Risk,&quot; Al Ries and Jack Trout present a number of concepts that are true only sometimes, some that apply to a limited set of situations, or are observations that might be true if seen from a certain point of view but have limited value. The &quot;laws&quot; they present are better described as &quot;rules of thumb.&quot;<br />For instance, Ries &amp; Trout posit the &quot;The Law of Leadership&quot; which states, &quot;It's better to be first than it is to be better.&quot; However, Sony's Betamax VCR and Apple's Newton PDA are just two of many examples where being first DID NOT lead to success. VHS VCRs and Palm Pilots succeeded, even though they came later, because they were the first to gain enough customer acceptance and create enough momentum to create and sustain a profitable business. All things being equal, being first is preferable because you may get some &quot;first mover&quot; advantages. However, many companies have successfully adopted the &quot;fast follower&quot; strategy where they allow innovators do the hard work of creating a market, and then apply greater resources and management skill to achieve long-term dominance.<br />Another example is Ries' &amp; Trout's &quot;The Law of Perception&quot; which states, &quot;Marketing is not a battle of products, it's a battle of perceptions.&quot; While perceptions are important, making the claim that &quot;marketing is not a battle of products&quot; is overly simplistic. If a personal computer is twice as fast, and is one-half theprice than competitors with comparable features, who do you think is going to win? I would agree with Ries &amp; Trout that marketing is not MERELY a battle of products, and that other considerations like perceptions are important too. But they overstate the case and make a false dichotomy.<br />&quot;The 22 Immutable Laws of Marketing&quot; may be useful introduction to some marketing ideas for people new to the field, especially those involved with consumer products (e.g., toothpaste, soft drinks, tissue paper). For people interesting in learning about marketing and selling high-tech products, or marketing strategies for highly competitive markets, I'd suggest reading works by Geoffrey Moore, Regis McKenna and Philip Kotler.
B000002LRX|5.0|Definitely years before their time, Faith No More was producing music in the early 90's which has greatly infuenced the todays funk-metal movement.  The band scarred the face of popular music in 1989 with the release of the real thing.   At the time, the single, &quot;Epic&quot; was unlike anything ever heard before.  Blending rap with metal, synth noise, classical piano, and flowing bass-lines, the album was a masterpiece.  How could a band possibly top this effort.  The release of Angel Dust proved this task completely tangible.  Always out to further themselves musically, the members of Faith No More never stay in one place for very long.  Pattons high pitched, nasal vocals on the Real Thing were replaced by a blend of screams, harmony, low pitched talking, and his signature noises.  This album is a lot heavier with better bass-lines than the previous release.  With exception to Mr. Bungle's &quot;California&quot; this is probably my favorite album Mr. PAtton has been involved in.  Definitely the best Faith No More album.
6305810109|5.0|Richard Farnsworth's recent death is a tragic loss, a point driven home when viewing this wonderful story. Pace? As slow and relaxed as the lawnmower he rides. Plot? As simple, pithy and sweet as life itself. 5 Stars? Watch Mr. Farnsworth's performance -- or to be precise, see what is NOT there to clutter it up -- and you'll wish you had a sky full of stars to award. <br />(And for you parents out there -- while this is not lightweight fare, with its adult themes of forgiveness and reconciliation, we watched it with our 8- and 9-year olds, and they gave it a thumbs up, too. It's not cute, and there's no carchases or explosions, but it is magical.)
B00004XONN|5.0|After 3 of the best rock album ever release, Radiohead goes very far in their music achievement.  I think that's a great thing because the actual music is not very innovative in general.  But, I admit the deep and misterious sides of this album , but listen and let the music grow up in your soul.  Look at song like How to dissaper completely, this is a perfect musical achievement for me.  A little upset could be for guitarist like me the small place to guitar on the album.  Overall, you need to open your mind and this album will be your favorite.
0790725657|5.0|In a world full of high dollar film that are so riddled with trash, this film is wonderfully mastered and fulfilling.  It not only contains tantilizing screen play, but is wholesome and enchanting.  It takes you back to the wonders of childhood, and fills that void that adulthood brings.  Truely an A+ for all ages!

B00004Y6O9|5.0|Almost 22 years after it's release it still sounds fresh and good, but one thing to note. Warner Bros has &quot;Digitally Remastered&quot; the first 6 VH albums from I to 1984. What does this mean? It means that the sound quality is better then ever, also meaning &quot;get rid of your old VH CD's and get the Remastered versions with all ORIGINAL ARTWORK (YOU KNOW THE ARTWORK FROM THE VINYLS)&quot;. It was in mid September that i found out that Warner Bros recently did this (they did the samething with Dire Straits as well too), i was upset at first because, i now had to replace my old VH cd's and get the 6 remasters (at a good price too). If you are a Die-Hard VH fan, you must replace your old VH cd's and get these, they are worth the buy, and sound so much better making old VH blasting their way through the 21th Century for generations to come. (Cool Huh!!!!!)
0380002930|5.0|This is the greatest book I have ever read.  I don't make statements like that lightly.  A book about talking rabbits is going to be a tough sell to just about anyone but I'll try.  I have read hundreds of books and my tastes generally lead me to fantasy novels (Moorcock, Weis &amp; Hickman, R. A. Salvatore, etc...) most of these books really aren't five star material (I tend to be an incredibly tough rater) but they're fun and exiting to read.  SO IS THIS BOOK!  I can't emphisize that enough.  But please don't get the idea that this book is just for people who read fantasy.  I don't know of another book that will appeal to every type of reader as well as this one does.  There was a review for this book from the St. Louis Post that states &quot;anyone who can read english should read this book&quot;.  This is not just flattery.  It has wonderful character development and the adventures that they go through is so well written that you will find yourself turning to the next page or so to see how things turn out, that is if you remember that you are just reading and not living the story.  I don't know of a better compliment for a book.  So give it 3 chapters.  I'm sure that it will turn into 4, then 5, and so on.  At first the book may seem like a marathon given its size, but everyone I know who has read the book thinks that it was too small.  So will you. I promise.
B00000JLXG|3.0|Please!  Enough is enough!  It's not amazing anymore what someone can do with several years and $100 million dollars. I give this 2 1/2 stars for the special effects and 1/2 star for audacity.  The romance isn't that overwhelming; the acting is sub-par; and the plot (outside of an ocean liner sinking) is the stuff of a b-movie.  And, please, don't tell me i don't appreciate romance.  WEST SIDE STORY has more romance and more tragedy than this tripe.
B0000041TD|5.0|For one of my favorite recordings.  This performance is flawless.  As a Pavarotti fan, this is one of his best recordings, but I cannot think of a single weakness in the cast.  I won't go into the details as other, more experienced opera fans have, but you will NOT be disappointed in any way with this.
0790743132|5.0|The title of my review says it all.  Romance, comedy, intrigue, suspense, politics, morality, idealism, patriotism, Humphrey Bogart, Ingrid Bergman.  No other movie in the history of film has all that.  If you felt &quot;Titanic&quot; was a great movie, you haven't watched this film closely enough.  Here's lookng at you, kid.
B00004XONN|5.0|Okay, I read about the anticipation and anticipated myself. Read lots of reviews then came here to hear from real fans. Some positive and a lot of them negative at first. Well, I decided I would not buy the album, not having heard much Radiohead other than Creep and buying OK Computer and a friend borrowing it for the past two years (he moved away). <br />Well, impulse gave in and with low expectations this album blew me away on the first listen. Kid A is one of the most brilliant albums I have ever heard. The opening track, Everything In Its Place sets the tone of the album with its delicate synth chords. Moving through this sonic journey I felt a full range of emotions.<br />How To Disappear Completely has to be the most haunting yet beautiful pieces of music ever put on tape, where Optimistic sounds just plain angry.<br />Skeptic of the critics at first then it blew my expectations out of the water. Kid A is true brilliancy and raises the bar for the rest of pop.
0790729989|5.0|A gentleman I talked to once said he didn't like this film because the police never turned on a light in any room they went into.  Apparently, he forgot this was a movie.  I was impressed not only by the cinematography and art direction and set design but by Brad Pitt's ability to maintain a high level of acting skill opposite the great Morgan Freeman.  This is not a film for the squeamish.  Even if the scenes of violence acts pale next to the slasher films of the past several years, the intention and the theme of this movie are enough to perpetuate nightmares.  Unlike many horror films, this suspense thriller WILL make you think.  And sometimes the human mind is a scarier landscape than the film screen.

B00000K0DT|5.0|How can a movie with no DEFINITIVE answers and no real sense of closure be successful?  This one IS.  The whole idea of a movie is telling a story and then deciding if you felt it to be real or not.  This entire movie is JUST THAT: an elaborate story that we, as the viewers, must decide upon.  Is it real?  Or is it all just a story?  And if it is only a sotry, then what is real?  A rag-tag collection of unglamorous actors (Baldwin, Pollack, Del Toro, Byrne, and Spacey) absolutely shine in this piece.  Some have called the story and the writing convoluted.  But these actors play with words and phrases and nuances like children play with building blocks.  Story telling should always be this good.
0312867123|4.0|I have always been partial to Robert Sawyer, as he is Canada's greatest borne and bred and still resident science fiction writer.  Perhaps I tend to give him the benefit of the doubt especially when he rejects the staple of most Canadian writers; the government grant.  That being said, I liked Flashforward.  It is a good, solid, well researched, and well written novel.  It's perhaps not his best but it's good.<br />Flashforward is set at CERN in 2009.  Its primary protagonist is a Canadian scientist working at CERN trying to detect the illusive Higgs boson.  The new ultra-high energy experiment causes everyone to see through their own eyes what they will be doing some 20 years in the future for two minutes.  When the experience is over there have been accidents and deaths as a result.  Some people see futures they don't like.  Others see nothing indicating that they won't be alive in 20 years.  Flashforward is an exploration of the problems caused and philosophical points raised.<br />Do we have free will?  Is the future predetermined?  Why do some relationships succeed and others fail?  These are but some of the questions that Sawyer raises.  Typical Sawyer themes are present including his interest in longevity/immortality.  I am impressed that Sawyer can approach so many of his recurring themes from a fresh angle every time.<br />Sawyer's novels all appear well researched with the science not front and centre but well supported.  If one is a techie then there is technical content.  If one isn't then the technical content doesn't get in the way of the story.<br />Flashforward is a good novel but not without some weaknesses, principally in the ideas that it presents.  For instance, Sawyer implies that the world of 2030 will have greater sexual freedom than today/2009.  How much greater freedom could there be?  On the one hand Sawyer implies that greater sexual freedom would be a good thing.  On the other his protagonist regrets that someone had his divorced fiancéebefore he did.  Sawyer also skips over the effects of marital breakdown and absentee parents on the development of children.  Perhaps Sawyer will tackle these issues in his next novel.<br />While I like to wave the Canadian flag as often as possible, I think that Sawyer has overdone it.  Some of the Canadian references make great in-jokes for Canadian readers and don't detract from the story.  However, Sawyer gives some Canadian institutions, particularly the CBC, far more prominence than they receive internationally.<br />Flashforward is worth reading.  One of the subplots has a thrilling climax.  It will make the reader think.  The ending is a little untidy but so is life.
B000002A3T|4.0|I must say that I am very impressed.  After the dissapointing A Momentary Lapse of Reason I was pretty leary when buying this album. Quite honestly it ranks up there with Dark Side, WYWH, and The Wall.  Musically it eclipses everything the Floyd has done since WYWH (Shine On You Crazy Diamond).  Gilmour's guitar work is simply astounding and I was very pleased to see Wright getting the lead vocal on a track.  Lyrically it is still isn't up to par with some of Waters work but it isn't bad.  All in all, it's one of the best Pink Floyd albums out there and proves that the post Waters Pink Floyd is doing just fine. Besides, any Floyd fan who thinks that Waters actually wrote the music to all those he has his name on is fooling themselves (or better yet, is letting Waters ego fool them).
6305537798|4.0|Like many of the other people here, I avoided this film like the plague because of the way it was pitched:  directly at the teen market, between the &quot;slasher&quot; bores of I Know What You Did Last Summer and the &quot;romantic comedies&quot; featuring She's All That.  Plus, I have a general rule:  if the majority of my classmates like the movie, I refuse to see it.  This would be why I haven't enjoyed the likes of the Scream trilogy or Varsity Blues and American Pie.<br />However, upon much insistance of my English class, I finally broke down and watched it (plus, we were doing the original Taming of the Shrew).  To my surprise, this is a very smart and well crafted film.  The main ensemble cast (Heath Ledger, Larisa Oleynik, Julia Stiles, Joseph Gordon-Levitt) did a wonderful job, but what really made it especially endearing were the &quot;minor&quot; characters.  Mandella and Michael, the friends who find love over Macbeth; Andrew Keegan as Joey Donner, the guy everyone loves to hate and/or kiss up to; Alison Janney (from the West Wing) as the horny guidance counselor; Bogey Lowenson, the unassuming future MBA.  The person that stood out in my mind the most, though, was the English teacher.  He was the funniest person in the entire film.  The interaction between Mr. Morgan and Kat was quick, witty, and even a little double-edged.  <br />I would recommend this film to almost anyone, even those wary of the teen genre that's flooded the market with truly horrible flicks.  It probably takes someone with a penchant for Shakespeare--or feminist literature--to truly understand the wit of the lines.
B00004XONN|5.0|Granted I'm a Radiohead fan, but I found each track a joy the very first time I heard it. You can call it &quot;experimental&quot;, or a &quot;radical departure&quot;, but I call it great music from a truly visionary band. I'll be listening to this CD for a very long time.
B00004XONN|2.0|Amazing these days what passes for &quot;important&quot; records and music.  There are no songs on this record, just ideas, as someone else wrote here.  It's fun to watch people fall all over each other rushing to praise this latest example of an emperor who isn't wearing any clothes...sorry, but I just can't join the cult.
0316777722|5.0|An observer of life and exactly what is wrong with it can be studied right here in this hilariously twisted book.  No subject is sacred with Mr. Sedaris; he chronicles his own mishaps and the foilbles of his loved ones with a gently bladed tongue.  He forgives the cruelty of life's mishaps and his own place on this Earth - especially his unfortunate command of the French language.
0780631684|3.0|One of the best opening sequences for any sci-fi thriller, a bunch of students getting on a plane for Paris.  Then something horrible starts to happen--or does it?  Is it happening, or is one of the students having a pre-vision of a calamity?  Usually I hate &quot;dream sequences&quot; in movies that don't tell you you're looking at a dream and not reality, but this is the exception that proves the rule.  (Every rule has a possible exception.)  The dream-reality bit is just as justifiable here as it was in &quot;The Usual Suspects.&quot;  And so, we're off on what looks like a nonstop roller coaster ride.<br />If only the rest of the movie could have kept pace with the opening!  But it does a pretty good job.  There are highs and there are lows; the lows are when the director and screenwriter ran out of ideas for the moment. The important thing is that an intelligence is working behind the scenes; the movie, given its premise, is coherent and satisfying.  If we were allowed half-stars, I'd give this three-and-a-half. The DVD is very nicely produced. <br />Bottom line: well worth seeing.
6304143184|5.0|The story about a boy and his alien is hands down one of the greatest masterpieces in my film collection.  It's so touching and wonderful, you can't hardly put it in words, it's just that kind of movie you want to watch over and over.  I watched it again for the first time in over a decade, and in that time I'd forgotten what a masterpiece it truely is.  I found myself watching it again after I listened to some tracks from the score.  I thought it'd be fun to watch it again, and boy was I right! After watching it two things struck me, &quot;Wow, no wonder everyone loves it so much!&quot; and &quot;I think I'm going to cry!&quot; It's true E.T. strikes a chord in all of us that have ever needed a friend when times were bad, or ever was once a child (heck, I still am!)<br />Steven Spielberg was once quoted as saying, &quot;Someone once told me never to work with kids or animals.&quot; And yet he directly Henry Thomas, the ever lovable Drew Berrymore, and the others better then most directers could have.  All the acting is wonderful, especially the outstanding performance from E.T. in the closet scene.  All around direction was superb as always (it's Steven Spielberg for crying out loud!) As well as camera work, editing, and soundtrack (John Williams deserves a standing ovation, buy the soundtrack!) <br />Problems with the film?  I have no complaints what-so-ever!  This is a masterpiece, and I think even Gene Shallet would think twice before deciding he hated it (and for those of you who don't know Gene Shallet, he hates almost everything he reviews!) Know if you'll excuse me, E.T. has to go phone home!
B000002H4C|5.0|When i saw the movie, i was hooked. I didnt find about heavy metal 2000 till like 2 years later. I Havent seen the 2000 yet but the first one is a classix. When you hear like 45 seconds of the song in the movie, you know you want more. THis cd has it all. Its a must buy for any 80's fan or heavy metal fan.
6304106017|3.0|The movie &quot;From Dusk Till Dawn&quot; is strange in it's ways of how the story line goes.  It starts off with two guys trying to get to Mexico to get some money that is owed to them for killing known cowboys in the USA. They end up capturing hostages and get them to drive them through to the border of Mexico. They get through and end up at the 'Dusk Till Dawn' joint. Things were really great in this movie until this stage.  The movie then leads into them being there and all the dancers and strippers turning into vampires, in which they fight against them till dawn comes.  In my part, why start a movie off so excellent, and then let it all drop at the end basing it on vampires in such a remote and small location as the 'dusk till dawn' joint.  &quot;From Dusk Till Dawn&quot; shows no really great horror scene. I think the strange part about it is the fact it goes from an action movie to a silly horror scene.  This movie is one to borrow or rent, with my opinion do not buy it.
0446677450|5.0|An excellent book, and easy to read.  Mr. Kiyosaki uses his unique position of having two fathers to illustrate the differences in their thinking and their approach to money.  I found that I have often used the same thinking that the poor dad used, and was glad to have the opportunity to see an alternative approach.  Both dads worked hard, but one became rich while the other remained poor all his life.  This book defines assets as income producers - toys get included in liabilities. I've read many books on becoming rich, but this one finally got through to me.  An excellent book.  It has helped me change my financial life for the better.
0152438181|5.0|I read this book for the first time my Junior year in High School.  I have never been able to forget this book!  It took me back to a time when I was a young child and allowed me to appreciate it on that level.  At the same time, I was tuned into to all the deeper aspects of the themes of the novel.  I definately have a new appreciation for the little things in life I tend to take for granted.  Great book!
B0000025IE|5.0|This was one of those rare ocasions when everything falls into place to make a masterpiece since the band line-up to the chemistry between band producer, recording company and even the studio chosen to record the album. The result: an unforgetable metal album, one of the best of all times. Raw, simple and diect to the point, but not vulgar or cheap. Fantastic.
B00000IAU3|5.0|Dido Mixes unbelievable vocal talent with incredible musicianship on this album.  It's an excellent for anybody who appreciates musical talent.  The album is an excellent mood setter.  It's the perfect date CD.
B000002LUB|1.0|Id like to know why people get so angry when someone says that the only good Black Sabbath was that with Ozzy. THey say this is prejudice, hard-mind, etc. Well, lets see. Can someone figure QUEEN without Freddie Mercury. answer: no, so they quit. Can someone figure AC/DC without Angus Young, even being Malcolm the main songwriter? No. Can someone figure IRON MAIDEN without Steev Harris ? No. So, Black Sabbath ceased to exist when Ozzy left, even being Iomi the main songwriter. With Dio, they at least had a respectable replacement and still a lot of crative genius in Iommi and Butler. But, after that, they finished forever, and each new album bringing the name &quot;SABBATH&quot; in the front cover helped to destroy the myth. Sad. This is the simple truth.
B00004XONN|1.0|File this one on your bottom shelf, out of easy reach, in alphabetical order between Kajagoogoo and Sigue Sigue Sputnik.<br />I've listened to this several times already, and boy, I was disappointed.  I'm always a little wary when a band goes &quot;techno&quot; because usually this means they've reverted to various inane synchy sounds jumbled together, and sadly Radiohead appears to be no exception.  For those who have given glowing reviews, I wonder how how many would have given five star reviews had a band other than Radiohead put this out?  And surely the strength of music is the music and not the band?  Admittedly, sometimes some music is worth listening to if it signifies a certain progression or divergence of a band, but I found this album too much random bleeps to give it the benefit of the bleeping doubt.  I distinctly get the impression the strength of the current reviews are based on Radiohead and not &quot;Kid A&quot;.<br />This album could well be a little self indulgent experiment -it's certainly not going to be of a wide commercial appeal nor a glowing commercial success (most sales for this will be made by the Radiohead name, and any future releases will probably suffer because of this album).  So you can't say that Radiohead are  following commercial formula (and thank goodness). But the real problem lies with the fact this just doesn't cut it -particularly in view of their previous music which stood out of the crowd.  Bottom line: the music has to be good as well as the delivery, even if the delivery is considered to be novel or experimental.  <br />There are some mitigating factors for this review; 1. I don't like the techno style and sound usually, 2. Radiohead have put out such great music in the past, it has to be said they are a talented band, so maybe &quot;Kid A&quot; needs a few more listens?  (Alas for me, the answer at the moment is no) and 3. you really believe Kajagoogoo and Sigue Sigue Sputnik are musical mental giants with classic hits.
6300213714|5.0|I'm not exactly sure what it is about this movie that has always made it a favorite of mine, ever since I was in middle school when it first came out and seeing it was forbidden to me because it was a hard R movie with lots of violence.  I remember a lot of the tough, older kids in middle school dressing up as various members of The Warriors and other gangs in the movie (all the gangs in the movie have various costumes).  This really freaked my 11 year old self out.<br />It was a big controversy at the school that all these kids had dressed up like the characters in this movie because the movie itself was controversial for its violence, which is pretty mild by today's standards.  I don't think it was the level of violence that caused the controversy.  Rather, I think it was that this movie does such a good job of making this whole cartoon street gang lifestyle seem so cool.  After seeing the movie, it makes you feel like you want to be in a street gang, in the same way that seeing Rocky makes a kid want be a boxer, or seeing Rambo makes a kid want to run around in the jungle with a gigantic knife that has a compass in the handle.  I think the adults recognized that kids thought this violent street gang movie was so cool, and it scared the cr@p out of the adults, so theaters were banning the movie.  And only the most rebellious kids dressed up as a Warrior for Halloween.<br />I'm 31 now, and I still love to watch this movie.  I've seen it dozens and dozens of times over the years, and I never get sick of it.  I think everyone who loves movies has at least a few movies that are like that for them.<br />Plenty of the reviews here have already explained the premise and plot of the film, so I won't repeat them.  I give The Warriors 5 stars, but certainly a person with a mind to do so could pick all kinds of holes in this thing, find flaws in the acting or the script or whatever.  None of that means anything to me in this case.  This movie is just a fun thrillride and mydisbelief and critical eye is 100% suspended.  I really hope Walter Hill or someone at Paramount is reading all these reviews, because this movie is at the top of my list for restoration and conversion to DVD.
0767802470|5.0|This is the definitive submarine movie by which all others should be judged. But more than that it's a movie about men going about the nasty business of war as they face the threat of imminent death. The only negative (if you can call it that) is some of the special effects are a notch short of top quality however this is nowhere near enough to detract from the superb theme of this truly great film. In the DVD version I recommend at least one viewing with the original German audio turned on and using the English subtitles.  This directors cut is very well done and in spite of being over 3 hours long it keeps your interest. I highly recommend this movie and for an even greater understanding you might want to read the book too.  I read it first and it made my anticipation of the movie that much greater and I was not dissapointed.
B000002J20|3.0|It has been repeated many times in previous reviews here that Tales From Topographic Oceans is the Yes album fans either love or hate with nearly equal degrees of passion.  I believe I fall somewhere in the middle ground between the love/hate debate.  Is this Yes' greatest work, and the album against which all others in the genre be measured?  No, because I think this is not even their best album (Close To The Edge and Relayer both top this, due to more focused material).  Is this album deserving of such disdain by so many, due to its over-excessive pretentiousness?  No, for even within the bloat of these four side-long epics lies some wonderfully original, creative and beautiful music that merits continued listening. I think why many people seem to dislike Tales is because it is extremely difficult to listen to a work such as this in the manner intended, as a &quot;symphony&quot; in four movements.  I would guess many of Tales' detractors listen to these songs alone, and form their judgments based on how much they like or dislike the individual pieces.  It is a bit much for even the most open minded listener to sit through a 20 minute composition without losing interest somewhere along the way.  Multiply that loss of interest by a factor of four, and you get a great sum of boredom for many.    In my personal opinion, Tales ranks as a very good album, yet certainly not a great one.  I just believe Yes was a bit too ambitious with this project and lost a little bit of focus in the middle of the album, though I do have to give them a lot of credit for the idea.   If I were to break it down to a percentage of the album I like, it would come out to about 70%.  The first disc (The Revealing Science of God, The Remembering) is by far the stronger of the two, nearly a perfect single album by itself.  Both are wonderfully transcendental, moving compositions that compliment each other well, their musical themes well structured and arranged, each individual part flowing perfectly from one to the next, and do not meander off course (which helps when listening to songs of this length!).    However, I cannot give the second disc the same praises.  The Ancient, as a whole for me (and many others here seem to agree) feels as though it is thrown together, and is at times unbearable to listen to.   After listening to some wondrous playing on  the first disc, hearing Steve Howe's guitar on the first 12 minutes of this track feels like the musical equivalent of fingernails scratching a chalkboard. Even the acoustic portion of the song, as much as it is a nice change of pace from the rest of the track, and somewhat of a pleasure to listen to (after those &quot;ugly&quot; guitar parts), seems to make the same mistakes the first two-thirds of the song makes:  over-repetition.  To compound that mistake, the transition out of the section segues into the start-stop riff that bridges most of the disjointed passages, making this song way too boring.  It seems as if the band relied upon this one repetitive riff to build an entire side of the album, and threw some disparate parts in between.    Ritual, on the other hand, does save the second disc from complete disaster.  It is more in correlation with the first two tracks, with some subtle connections musically to Revealing Science of God (it does borrow the synth intro after the opening vocal &quot;chant&quot; at about the eight and half minute mark).  Ritual could have used some editing, though; even as well as the music is composed, arranged and performed, some parts, primarily the first quarter of the song and the percussion sequence, are a bit too long.  This does drag down the quality somewhat, but not much.  This closes the album on a good note, and Howe's solos, especially the ending one, are very nice, easily the best on the record.    This is an album that should be approached with extreme caution by casual Yes fans who are curious about this work (on second thought, I don't think there is sucha thing as a casual Yes fan).  Most of this material is quite inaccessible (you won't find anything like &quot;Roundabout&quot; or &quot;I've Seen All Good People&quot; here!) and takes more than a few listens to ALL of these songs in order for everything to sink in.  Not the album to start your Yes collection with.  I would probably recommend Close to the Edge first, for it provides a better introduction to the &quot;epic&quot; side of the band with the title track, and the other material is outstanding as well; then maybe Relayer for &quot;The Gates of Delirium&quot; (the best epic of theirs, according to the hardcore fans).  To do yourself justice, save Tales for a little later so that you may be able to form your own opinion of this work.
B000006NPY|5.0|I must admit, when I got this CD I wasn't expecting much, because I think 'Ava Adore' is absolutly the worst song by the pumpkins... I was expecting techno with Billy's whiney voice-not a good combination... however, when I heard the rest of the songs, I found that none of them were as horrid as 'Ava Adore', in fact, they were very good. I was reminded of the slower, melodic songs from Melon Collie... and the piano was just beautiful, and well incorparated into the songs.  I definatly recommend this CD if you fell in love with the songs from Mellon Collie, such as 'Mellon collie and the Infinite Sadness' 'Cupid de Locke' and 'farewell and goodnight'... The highlights of Adore are Annie-Dog, Shame, Tear, For Martha, and 17. the other songs are great too, it's just one of those CDs you can play straight through. The only flaw on this Cd is 'ava adore', but everything else more than makes up for it! I have about 20 Pumpkins Cds and this ranks number two, second only to the masterpeice Mellon Collie and the Infinite sadness.
B00004Y6TQ|5.0|This soundtrack tells the story and takes you back into the film. It is very moving and Bjork is BRILLIANT (even more so than usual). This is really unlike any of her other works. Especially the track &quot;scatterheart&quot;. The music commands your attention. I would compare this cd to the emotional equivalent of listening to This Mortal Coil - Blood and/or the Edward Scissorhands Soundtrack. But at the same time it is completely different. (?!) If you enjoy either of those, and you enjoy Bjork, you cannot lose with this cd. It is a bit short, but WORTH EVERY CENT! You can always put it on repeat.
B00003CXFG|5.0|This movie makes me want to get my eyes &quot;shined.&quot;  After you see this movie, you'll understand what I mean.  Vin Diesel is a great anti-hero. You can help but cheer him on.<br />He is a bad-a$$ that means business.  The aliens that he fights are awesome although you never get a real good look at one for an extended period of time.  They are a cross betweer the bugs from Starship Troopers and the aliens form Alien 1-4.<br />It has a twist ending that I will not spoil, but to say the least, I didn't see it coming.<br />Good flick to buy! Do it now.  PLus, add U571 or Gladiator, and you will be eligible for the Universal buy 2 get 1 free!
1573225517|3.0|As I began reading this book I felt a connection to the Rob Flemming character I can't remember feeling with any other. I felt for sure, this was going to be a real &quot;everyman&quot;, pro-guy, kinda book.  And it seemed to do it without disparaging women (too much). So I was disappointed when the plot became a clich: the one about the guy who has an irrational fear of commitment and he only appreciates what (and who) he has when it's (she's) gone. And if the grammar in the previous sentence annoyed you, don't buy this book: it's a snapshot of Hornby's style. Still, the book is filled with humorous characters and witty observations about the little nuances in relationships and sex.
B00004XONN|5.0|Let me see, I expect you people that gave it 1 star (or even 3 or 2) only listened to this album... once? I don't think you quite understand how this album works. It is not supposed to be instantly catchy. I bet most of these people didn't enjoy OK Computer a lot either, but listen to either album at least 10 times, then write your review. This album is simply incredible. It is filled with amazing musical triumphs, unseen before in any music. I think radiohead should give themselves a pat on the back for songs such as 'everything in the right place', 'kid a' and the beautiful 'national anthem'. 5 out of 5.<br />(i am so happy this was so much different to any of their previous albums, well done)<br />'pack, and get dressed, before your father hears us, before, all hell, breaks loose' - radiohead, exit music (for a film)

0140282033|2.0|Don't get me wrong, I love chocolate. I also have a great respect for wiccan, mother-centric religions, a deep mistrust of the organized church, a soft-spot for women trying to make it on their own against the odds, and I always cheer for the underdogs. Why then, did this book leave such a flat taste in my mouth?<br />Well, for one, and I know I'm not the first person to mention it, the characters are simply drawn and without more than a smidgen of complexity. In the same way that my son's cartoons feature really really bad guys, and really really good guys, Chocolat features heroines and villians, good versus evil, and pushes these characters so far into their assigned roles that all they can seem to do by the end of the book is repeat their initial gestures and thoughts. Again. And again. And again. <br />Not that Harris doesn't try to come up with some character development. With foreshadowing that was at first sort of interesting and then got tedious, we are made aware that the priest (A Bad Guy) has a mildly shocking, secret past that has made him the sad twisted individual he is. Vianne (A Heroine) is given over to moments of doubt, and in a really bizarre little paragraph towards the end of the book, it's suggested that her own mother perhaps abducted her as a youngster, a thread which is immediately dropped (perhaps because it would bring in too much complexity). Everybody else in the town is as predictable as a Disney movie, in fact it's such a simplistic story that it would be ideal for optioning--perfect Hollywood fare, and would probably be pretty popular for a while, as this book seems to be.<br />Chocolat has its moments--the descriptions of the chocolates themselves, the cooking techniques and the window displays were intruiging and mouth-watering enough to make me consider a trip to our local chocolatier. Vianne's daughter's imaginary friend Pantoufle kept me interested, the idea that a child's desire could create a reality that some could even see.The description of Armande's birthday feast was a moment of graciousness, a la Babette's Feast, and it was mildly interesting to see the roles of the vagrant gypsies (Good Guys, in case you were wondering) brought up to date complete with pierced eyebrows.<br />Listen. This is not a bad book, and you're not an idiot if you loved it. The Good Triumphs Over Evil (and Evil Gets its Just Desserts (no pun intended)) plotline satisfies a deep need in our souls for assurance that the good things we do will be rewarded, and people who do bad things will pay somehow. Stephen King's The Green Mile gives us a similar message. Unfortunately the end result of that kind of thinking is that it classifies people into Good and Bad categories, with no room for Grey, and that, my friends, is how all those witches ended up getting burned in the first place.
0783226063|3.0|Dune is a great movie for those who didn't read the novels. It has fantastic costume designs, great special fx for it's time, superb performance from the entire cast and a rocking soundtrack by Toto. But i still feel the DVD deserves better. The running time was many times shorter than the theatrical release. There was even a three hour plus DVD version of the movie available only in the U.K. For most part, the U.K release(Extended TV Edition)was better although it was toned down a bit but it improves a lot in the drama, plot and characters' development. Hopefully, Universal will bring the extended version to U.S shores or at least a director's cut of the film. In the audio/visual departments, this is still the best version without any sign of grain but picture tends to be soft at certain areas(the special fx areas)due to the age of the film. A recommended buy but i would wait for the extended version even if it takes ages!
B00004XONN|5.0|Like the editorial review says, this is the first cd of the 21st century. Like all the other reviews say, this is not the radiohead of old. But that should be expected, the difference between the bends and ok computer was quite a bit, the difference between kid a and ok computer is immense. I would have to say my favorite track is How to Disappear Completely, this song sounds like what you expect a typical radiohead song to sound like. The National Anthem (track 3) reminds me a lot of a song on the first Verve Album called Butterfly. The question remains, is this an album for the casual fan? I'm not sure yet. But my inclination would lean toward no. Ok Computer (IMO) was the best album of 90s. Is this a worthy followup, you bet it is, if not building on it. Yes its different, yes its unconventional, but in this day and age of recycled teen pop formulaic music, its a welcome refreshment.  So, my point is, if you are not the typical consumer who buys whatever is on TRL (which I imagine if you are searching this album you aren't) then you will like this album.
B00003CXHJ|2.0|U-571 is a shallow rip-off of &quot;Das Boot&quot;.  The characters are not well developed, and the obvious references to &quot;Run Silent, Run Deep&quot; (personality clash between CO and XO, and the &quot;dive! dive!&quot; scene) don't come off.  The theatre trailers suggested to us that the American crew in the German sub (which ran pretty well and looked amazingly ship-shape inside for having been all shot up in the seizure of the Engima) had to get through Allied combatants to get back to safety.  Overall, a very disappointing treatment of an interesting premise.
B0000026J6|4.0|Leonard Cohen's reputation is as follows:  Are you feeling happy?  Contented with life? but you want to feel depressed?  Then put on a Leonard Cohen album!  Feel the waves of desperation and melancholy wash over you!  With Leonard Cohen, the outlook is &quot;bleak&quot;.<br />So, that's what I was expecting.  BUT!  I was pleasantly surprised when I heard this, the first time I really listened to a Leonard Cohen album.  The sound is very 1980's, with early synths all over the place, and some girly backing singers here and there (actually, when I heard it, I reckoned it was probably circa 1981, from the sound of the synths, and not 1988, but if that's the way he wanted it.....).  Cohen's voice is deep and gravelly, and he seems to be singing softly with the mike right up to his face, but, again, if that's how he wanted it, fair enough.  What I heard, though, were funny, catchy songs, with nice musical licks - the total opposite of what I expected!<br />But the really good thing about this album is the lyrics.  The lyrics are witty and funny, but not too clever.  He sings about himself and women quite a bit, but tongue in cheek and with a lot of irony.  They're the kind of lyrics you could quote to people, and some of them are quite thought provoking.  Some samples:<br />\\"They sentenced me to twenty years of boredom For trying to change the system from within I'm coming now, I'm coming to reward them First we take Manhattan, then we take Berlin\\", or <br />\\"Ah but a man never got a woman back Not by begging on his knees Or I'd crawl to you baby And I'd fall at your feet And I'd howl at your beauty Like a dog in heat And I'd claw at your heart And I'd tear at your sheet I'd say please, please I'm your man\\".<br />See what I mean?  A lot better than the usual syrupy drivel about &quot;love&quot; that you usually hear!  Overall, this is a very interesting album, but one that you would have to listen closely too the first few times until you got to know it well.  After that,I suspect that you would stick it on every now and then whenever you wanted a bit of cheering up, believe it or not!
B000004286|5.0|This is the best score that James Horner has done for a film. Yes, I even thought that this was better than his score for the smash hit TITANIC. His use of Bagpipes and keyboards integrated into the London Symphony Orchestra's grand performance is absolutely stunning! If you love this movie, you'll love this album! Grade: A+
630382790X|5.0|The movie Apollo 13 is a wonderful look into a disaster that became a triumph. Based on astronaut Jim Lovells book &quot;Lost Moon&quot; and directed by Ron Howard this movie takes you within the first 10 minutes from the tradegy of Apollo 1, and the deaths of astronauts Grissom, White, and Chaffee, right into the Landing on the moon by Apollo 11. With that as a setting it will focus on the events leading to the disaster and through the heroics efforts of both the astronauts and the ground crew.<br />Based on a time when America had become somewhat bored with Moon landings (although this was only the third scheduled) Apollo 13 takes you step-by-step through the story. Starting with the 3 astronuats (Lovell, Haise. and Mattingly) training for their mission and displaying the type of teamwork that is so essential to a successful mission, it then leads you to the last minute replacement of Mattingly by Swaggart due to potential health concerns. From there it shows the concern of Haise and Lovell as Swaggart tries to fit into their style. Swaggart never quite accomplishes this which would lead to a confrontation with Haise during the flight. The personnel of Mission Control are the real heros here though, from the leadership of Flight Director Gene Krantz to the efforts of every single person.<br />The cast of Apollo 13 actually made the movie come alive. Yes, the special effects were great, but without the perfect acting jobs by the strong cast this could have fallen into documentry standards. Tom Hanks as Jim Lovell displays the confidence that you would expect from the mission leader. Gary Sinise as Ken Mattingly is wonderful, going from the excitment of pre-flight to the disappointment of being scatched from the mission to the results-driven savior. Bill Paxton, Ed Harris, Kevin Bacon, and Kathleen Quinlan round out a great cast.<br />Having read the book before seeing the movie it's interesting to note that while the movie is about a 50/50 mix of action between the astronauts and Mission Control, the book is about a 75/25 split in favor of Houston. Both approaches are correct. In book form the author can take the time to go into detail of all the heroic actions and efforts that the personel of Mission Control had to do to bring these men home safely. In the movie it's best to cover the essentials. However if this movie was interesting to you I would HIGHLY recommend the book. It gives you great insight into all that transpired.astronauts and Mission Control, the book is about a 75/25 split in favor of Houston. Both approaches are correct.

B00004XONN|4.0|Radiohead's Kid A is just the right departure from O.K.Computer; a progression.  It is a heavily layered, collection of sounds which will not disappoint you.  If you are already a Radiohead fan, you may be somewhat surprised by the lack of &quot;hooks.&quot;  You aren't going to be singing any of these song's in the shower, and you won't be hearing much of this stuff on the local top hits radio station.  But it will linger in your mind, and you'll find yourself turning to it again as you select music for driving, reading, living.  Electronic music can be soul-less; sometimes intentionally so, as in Portishead.  In this case, it is amazingly soulful, where it is utilized in this album.  You have to hear it all at once; buy the CD.  It's worth it.
6301008944|4.0|This movie is the best movie I have seen in a long time.  I watched it a lot when I was younger.  I taped it off the TV, so I could watch it all the time, but my nasty brother taped over it so I no longer have it.  I would really like a copy of this great movie.  So it should really be re-released!!!
B00000JG41|5.0|I mean... gosh... I cant explain it! This CD is absolutly my all time favorite CD! They are so original in their work and their vocals are Awesome. Heres were the story started, im in my friend Joes car and he puts in this CD. I ask him who is this and he tells me Mr.Bungle. I rush to the store and buy this CD. I have hooked 5 of my friends on Mr.Bungle just by letting them listen to the 1st song. Me and my friends cant stop singing sweet charity in school. People tilt their heads at us and ask Whatcha singing? We just smile and say Mr.Bungle.
0140177396|5.0|This is the first Steinbeck I've read and I have to say, it was an absolute pleasure.  I found the descriptive style curt, while still being beautifully evocative.  There is a lovely sense of space and movement to his backdrops.<br />The two characters Lennie and George make for an immediately adorable duo.  Lennie's childlike glea and innocence makes you want to just stop and hug him from his very first line.  You feel an overwhelming urge to want to protect him from the big bad world that George is all too aware of.<br />The journey details their search for work as farm handlers and their ambition to fulfill their dream of one day owning their own land.  Lennie must surely be one of the great literary characters of the 20th century.  He's looked down upon as a weirdo by most of the people he meets, when in fact he's too good for them.  He deserves better.<br />A philosophical novel that's impossible to put down (I read it in 1 day), I found it a great introduction to Steinbeck.  A classic to be recommended without reservation.
B000003JBM|5.0|I'm not a big hip-hop fan, but I like Jazz a lot. Jazzmatazz takes fusion to another level with amazing grooves and rhythmic jazz beats and a french rapper on one track. this cd is much jazzier than the other two, which is why i prefer it to the other two. The hip-hop is truly amazing in this cd too, but is definitely more mellow than the mainstream rap you hear nowadays. For anyone who likes jazz and hip-hop and can do without explicit lyrics (which you will find on the 3rd volume), this is absolutely a must.
6302293553|5.0|This movie probably is the funniest movie ever made.  I'm completely serious.  No movie is quoted nearly as often -- for crying out loud, it came out 25 years ago and people still recognize lines from it.  You will start laughing in the first minute or two, and will not stop laughing, or even slow down, for the entire duration of the film.  I have often wondered how these Monty Python guys ever came up with so much random hilariousness.<br />A couple things I just want to mention -- my theory is that the Monty Python guys set out to satirize not only the medieval world, but the nature of power, and it's relation to myth.  I took an amazing course once on this topic with Prof. Laurence DeLooze, and he pointed out a lot of intriguing things.  This movie can actually really get you thinking about what rationalizations underlie any powerful institutions, kingship or otherwise.  Or even what rationalizations we employ every day to justify our own behavior, Sir Lancelot's shenanigans at the wedding party being the case in point.  What if you didn't respond to some of the situations they portray with laughter, but with outrage?  Perhaps that is a better response.  Especially having read Eric Idle's remarkably sophisticated ideas about the nature of humor in a book he recently came out with, I'm inclined to suspect that these dudes had a few (good) ideas in mind, behind the laughter they've provoked for a quarter of a century.  Just a thought.
B00004XONN|5.0|This may be the greatest album I've ever heard.<br />While it certainly isn't for everyone, it's hard to argue that this isnt a work of art.  This album blends obscure, winding rythms with Thom Yorke's haunting voice to create an album so revolutionary it's no exaggeration to call this the equivelent of Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, in progressiveness at least.<br />However, if you felt the least bit alienated by Radiohead's 1997 CD, OK Computer, then you'll be completely lost in this one.  The tracks in Kid A seem to blend together eventually to form one underlying ryhtm, best shown in the song &quot;Morning Bell&quot;.  <br />I give no guarantee that you'll love it, but it worth a listen nonetheless.
B000002UAU|4.0|This album certainly has some great tracks:  &quot;Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds,&quot; &quot;Good Morning, Good Morning&quot; &quot;She's Leaving Home,&quot; &quot;A Day in the Life&quot; etc.  However, once we get past all the mumbo jumbo about how important it is, it really doesn't compare to the two previous Beatles' albums Revolver and Rubber Soul.   <br />     Did it make rock n' roll art for the first time? Of course not.  Robert Johnson was art.  Muddy Waters was art.  Elvis was art.  Bob Dylan was widely recognized as art (and was playing rock) a couple of years before this.  And, of course, the Beatles were art on their previous albums.  And, thanks to George Martin, little on this album really &quot;rocks&quot; anyway. Ultimately it's a really great orchestral pop album (and Frank Sinatra and others certainly made orchestral pop art a long time ago).<br />  Did it inaugurate the psychedelic era? In 1967? Are you kidding? By then the it was practically over on the West Coast.<br />   So, in other words, buy this CD for the music, not the hype.
B000002AZ8|5.0|One way to tell if an album is truly a masterpiece is to sit back and see how it sounds years later...And I must say, Pearl Jam's Vitalogy sounds better today than it did upon it's release six years ago (I'm listening to it on vinyl right now, and if you own a record player, I'd highly recommend you try the vinyl version). By my own admission, I was a Pearl Jam bandwaggoner in the early nineties.  I saw them at Lalapalooza, I knew all the songs from Ten, bought VS. the say it came out, didn't like it as much as Ten, bought Vitalogy the day it came out, didn't like it as much as Vs, and so on.  But sometime around 1997, I was going to sell some CDs and gave Vitalogy some airtime in my car to see if it was worth keeping.  I was literally amazed at how great it was.  Perhaps it was too 'ahead of it's time' to please my ears in 1994.  Well, the rest of the world had caught up.  And I listened to the album for 2 straight weeks without having it leave my car. 'Last Exit' and 'Spin the Black Circle', the first two tracks, rock like nothing PJ had done before.  'Not For You', Tremor Christ', and 'Nothingman' have a sort of grunged out Beatles feel to them.  And 'Whipping' wraps up side 1 very um, quickly.  Side two is much more experimental, opening with the strange 'Pry, To' followed by my favorite track, 'Corduroy', and then the interesting 'Bugs'.  The hard-edged 'Satan's Bed' is another highlight of the album.  You've most likely heard 'Betterman', and 'Aye Davanita' is another one of the more experimental tracks.  The album closes with the classic 'Immortality' followed by 'Stupid Mop', perhaps the low point of the album...but at least it comes at the end.<br />Overall, Vitalogy is an incredible album, and will probably sound as good in 20 years as it does today.
B00003CXBK|5.0|What a great film this is!  I loved every minute of it.  A great drama and nail-biting action: what is not to love?  The animation is certainly on par with AKIRA (actually, I would have to say that the animation is BETTER) and the story line is the best I have ever experienced for an anime.  Tremendous.  If you have not seen this movie and you consider yourself an anime fan, you are wrong.  THIS IS A MUST SEE!  A+++++<br />fin
B000002GXJ|5.0|I have some other favorite Eagles' songs that are not included on this album, but if I were to choose only one album by this group, this would absolutely be THE ONE.<br />I admit, some of their songs do not appeal to me, and yet others reach me way down and grab a hold of my heart or soul in a very complex way.  Why complex?  It's never just the music..rather...like other groups that appeal to me deeply, the lyrics have serious importance, to me. I am thinking in particular of &quot;Wasted Time&quot;, for example.  Now there's a song that is a perfectly balanced example of music combined with words.<br />Unfortunately, I can't help laughing now whenever I hear &quot;Desperado&quot;, because of the Seinfield episode with the dorky boyfriend Elaine dated briefly, who would stop and make everyone listen whenever that song came on the radio, but it IS a beautiful, beautiful song, and I loved it for years.  If I ever get back to the place I was at before Seinfield wrecked it (even though it was a funny episode), it will remain a beautiful song, to me.<br />I don't really understand the Eagles as a group. What was &quot;california style music&quot;? I see that as second level. They were not at their peak when this album was released, and I got turned on to them late.  However, their music suited me in a romantic way.  I am not as hot for their harder songs. I am not into Joe Walsh, for example.  Give me Stevie Ray Vaughn for rammin it.<br />Get this album if you like to drive and sing.  It will hold up. Get this album if you like diversity.  It has that. Get this album if you have a collection that spans decades before the nineties.  It has a valid place on any music lover's list, and there IS a reason the Eagles made it into the R &amp; R Hall of fame.<br />Fer shure.<br />best,  jean

6300268470|4.0|Rio Brovo is my favourite movie of all time!!  Wayne, Martin,Nelson and last but not least Walter Brennan play in the movie. This movie is about 3  deputys trying to rid their town of violence. Martin plays a drunken deputy who trys to quit drinking Nelson plays a tough gunfighting teenager  and Wayne is the sherrif.Walter Brennan adds humor to the movie. Altogether it is a great film. The only flaw is 3 cusswords! If it did not have them in the movie I would give it 5 stars!
6301969251|4.0|\\"The Greatest Story Ever Told\\" is certainly the most reverential treatment of the life of Jesus.  The 1965 movie was based on the book by Fulton Oursler, which integrated the four Gospels into a single narrative.  To appreciate this task just look at the different versions of what Jesus said on the cross according to each Gospel.  Reconciling the various versions is not an easy task and while viewers may question some of the specific choices, the only really significant alteration is the death of Judas by throwing himself into the sacrificial pit of the Great Temple, a symbolism that is unnecessarily heavy handed.<br />The choice of Max Von Sydow to play Jesus is an interesting selection to say the least.  His slight Swedish accent and closely cropped beard are certainly in keeping with the reverential tone of the film, but I can not help wondering if this was something of a reaction to the more populist Jesus portrayed by Jeffrey Hunter in \\"King of Kings.\\"  After all, this was 1965 and the Beatles invasion was underway making male hair length a hot issue.  This is a Jesus who is too solemn and too sedate for the most part.  There is a nice moment where one of the new disciples comments that he likes Jesus' name.  The smile and \\"Thank you\\" that follow are one of the few glimpses of the charisma of the man from Galilee.<br />The strength of the film is in the gorgeous cinematography by William C. Mellor (who died on the set of a heart attack) and Loyal Griggs, and scene composition under the direction of George Stevens.  The opening narration goes from the opening verses of John shot over ancient Christian murals to a shot of the manager, ending with a shot of the hand of the baby Jesus as the narrator announces in a most simple manner, \\"The Greatest Story Ever Told.\\"  The juxtaposition of images and moments from the live of Jesus is prevalent throughout the film.  When Mary and Joseph return from Egypt they travel the road to Nazareth that is lined with the crucified victims of the Roman occupation. The voice of John the Baptist is first heard over a series of aerial shots covering the many miles traveled by all those who came to hear him make straight the way of the Lord.<br />Stevens shows a deft touch in the large scenes involving crowds.  The resurrection of Lazarus is down in a long shot, with the focus more on the faces of those who are witnessing the miracle rather than on the actual emergence from the tomb.  To the finale of the Hallelujah Chorus a trio of the faithful ran across the plain to the gates of Jerusalem to spread the good news.  There is also a wonderful scene of the confrontation between the Roman soldiers and the crowd that had come to the Temple to hear Jesus preach at night.  The film also contains some nice small touches.  When Pilate presents Jesus to the people, the figure of Satan strides through the crowd to utter the first demand for crucifixion.  When Mary Magdalene remembers the promise of the resurrection and Thomas proclaims his disbelief, Peter looks up and sees the smiling face of Lazarus.  The musical score by Alfred Newman, Hugo Friedhofer and Fred Steiner is wonderfully attuned to what is on the screen.<br />The main problem is not that there are so many stars in this film-Charlton Heston is an imposing John the Baptist, and Jose Ferrer as Herod Antipas, Sal Mineo as Uriah, and Van Heflin as Bar Amand all perform admirably-but rather the cameo appearances that invariably detract from the moment.  It is one thing to recognize David McCallum, Jamie Farr and Russell Johnson in \\"before they were stars\\" roles, but it is quite another to suddenly see Sidney Portier help carry the cross or John Wayne silhouetted against the darkening sky as a Roman Centurion.  While such cameos may have worked in \\"The Longest Day\\" or \\"It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World\\" during the heyday of the fad, they most certainly do not work in this film.<br />I was surprised to learn this movie was filmed around the Lake Powellregion of Arizona, having always assumed it had been filmed in the Holy Land.  I would be interested to know which scenes were directed without credit by David Lean (who was finishing up \\"Doctor Zhivago\\" at the time) and Jean Negulesco (\\"Johnny Belinda\\" and the 1953 \\"Titanic\\").  I want to resist the impulse to credit my favorite scenes to Lean rather than Stevens.<br />The reverential tone of the film ends up hurting the pacing so that it seems overlong at 3 hours and 14 minutes.  Ultimately I prefer the vitality of Zefferelli's \\"Jesus of Nazareth\\" and the monumental performance of Robert Powell as the quintessential Jesus.  But there are several lovely moments in \\"The Greatest Story Ever Told\\" and I always end up screening one version at Christmas and the other at Easter.  The print obviously needs to be RESTORED and the film really should be seen in the widescreen format, although that makes the credits impossible to read.Powell region of Arizona, having always assumed it had been filmed in the Holy Land.

6303965415|4.0|Although it does not compete with the elegance of the theatrical releases of &quot;Sense &amp; Sensibility&quot; and &quot;Emma,&quot; this 1996 BBC Films production of &quot;Persuasion&quot; has its own place in the Jane Austen revival of the past decade.  With Anne Elliot (Amanda Root) and Captain Wentworth (Ciar&aacute;n Hinds) we have the longest suffering set of lovers in all of Austen's domestic novels.  Eight years early Anne had been persuaded by a snobbish friend of the family to reject Wentworth as a suitor since he was a young naval officer with no prospects.  But now the financial fortunes of both parties are reversed, with the Elliots on the verge of bankruptcy and Wentworth a successful captain in the war against Napoleon, but their feelings for each other are unchanged.  It is just a question of when the two lovers will figure this out.<br />Root and Hinds, both members of the Royal Shakespeare Company, bring the requisite maturity to their roles.  Anne Elliot is the quintessential Austen old maid, with a resigned acceptance of her fate and an inherent dignity in the face of life's little quirks that makes the happy ending all the more enjoyable.  This is one of those steady, unremarkable performances where you really forget Root is acting.  She simply is Anne.  Hinds has a marvelous scene where he puts aside the requirements of polite society to tell off the woman who thwarted his happiness.  As is a requirement with all BBC period piece productions, the supporting cast is superb, especially Sophie Thompson as Anne's hypochondriac sister Mary (this is another one of those Austen literary families where the heroine is the only worthwhile one in the lot).<br />To me the most intriguing part of this adaptation is that it manages to incorporate both Austen's original and revised endings for the novel.  I must admit that I prefer the revised ending because for once she has the reconciliation of the two lovers be the result of one of them having the courage to tell the other one how they feel (albeit in a letter rather than face to face).  This was certainly quite different from Austen's usual tack of them accidentally learning about their true feelings for each other (e.g., &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot;).  I always considered this to be evidence of Austen's maturity as a writer, but unfortunately the work was published posthumously.to tell the other one how they feel (albeit in a letter rather than face to face).

B000002OR4|5.0|This soundtrack is very moving and deep. It's different from the ordinary soundtracks Williams writes: It's more classical than popular. He doesn't use his tell-tale composing techniques. I came to respect Williams a lot more after this score was written. In traditional Jewish-sytle music, it portrays the delicate emotions of this historic nightmare. My favorite track is &quot;Schindler's Workforce&quot; with its key changes and steady rhythm. The music swells until you are surrounded by it. The soundtrack gets better each time you hear it -- the true mark of good music.
0380018179|5.0|The Thorn Birds is a gripping love story involving two characters that are never able to claim their love for each other.  Meggie Cleary and Father Ralph have deep feelings for one another but they are unable to show these feelings because Father Ralph is unable to be involved with a girl in that manner due to his career.  The novel is about the life of three generations in the Cleary family.  Mainly the novel focuses on the passion between Ralph and Meggie.  It shows the enternal heartbreak that can come of loving the unlovable.  Along with the heartbreak that Meggie deals with on a daily basis, there are also tramas in her everyday life that keep her spinning in every direction.  Yet, somehow she is able to continue on in her life.<br />Meggie is a strong character and from reading this book, I can relate to her struggles.  She was just a child when she was thrown into the adult world and was expected to adjust.  Throughout the book the reader is able to share her feelings, whether they may be good or bad.  Meggie has many strengths in her life.  She is able to cope with almost anything that is thrown at her.  When she was only a teenager, she held the responsibility of caring for her baby brother because her mother was much to busy to pay any attention to him.  Meggie's main weakness is her ever-growing love for Father Ralph.  She is unable to let her love for him die, therefore causing her great pain.<br />Colleen McCullough uses the title The Thorn Birds for a very specific purpose I think.  A thorn bird is a symbol of someone who is jabbed many times with problems and dilemmas constantly, but yet is able to come out on top.  The bird is singing and gets stuck with a thorn.  The bird does not stop singing, but instead sings whole-heartedly until it's dying breath.  This is just like Meggie and the other characters in the novel.  They get problems upon problems piled on them, but they never complain about any of it.  They silently work their way through it accepting any consequences that may come along with it.  The live like the thorn birds by never complaining about the bad in their lives, but only working to make it better and dying knowing that there was not much more that could be done.<br />I really enjoyed this book.  I was so interesting that I just couldn't stop reading it.  It was a book that I just couldn't put it down.  It takes a lot for me to like a book, but this is just one of the books that within the first chapter I loved it.  I hope that other people were able to enjoy it as much as I did.  I recommend it to anyone looking to read a good book.
B0000024LN|5.0|This is my favorite Redman CD and he is my favorite rapper, this CD came out after his second album, Dar iz a Darkside which was not even close to Redman quality. I donno what he did to change but what ever he did worked. The beats are good the lyrics great. If you see this CD in the store and don't already own it Pick it up, Pick it up. When you listen to it don't skip any songs. This CD is tight all the way through. If you like the new stuff out like Nelly and some of DmX I would not recommend this, but if you like Method Man, Dr. Dre and Wu Tang this is a must have for you. Redman's new album is coming out December 12th I can't hardly wait. If you are like me and craving the album buy The Outsidaz Da Bricks October 30th it should eaze the pain. Peace

B00003CXE7|2.0|but they blew it.  I must say I'm surprised at all the 5-star reviews.  The dramatic scenes are awful, starting with the confrontation between the emperor and his son.  You can see everything coming a mile away, and the scenes are long and drawn out, filmed with the subtlety of a 'Jerry Springer' episode.  You might as well have a narrator carefully explain to the audience exactly what they're supposed to feel, instead of allowing them to derive their experience from the acting and context.  The character development of Commodus is appallingly simplistic and one-dimensional. I liked the general plot, and the scene where we first enter the great Coliseum is fantastic, but the scripting and directing are second-rate.  Its as if they said.. &quot;good enough, with our huge marketing campaign this'll make us a ton of money, why put in the effort to make it really good?&quot;  The climax was a joke.  The set-up totally fails to suspend my disbelief, and you see the ending from two miles away, lending it the impact of a mouse fart.  Braveheart is a similar movie carefully (and well) made. I might rate it three stars for what good scenes it has, but it deserves to have one yanked for blowing the opportunity to make a truly good film.
B00004XONN|3.0|This is a mesmerizing CD. It has elements of Tangerine Dream and Kraftwerk (old techno/ambient music) as well as the Chemical Brothers (new techno).  <br />What it doesn't have much of is the groundbreaking (and popular) sound of OK Computer.  Still, if you enjoy this band, you should buy this CD. <br />Kid A is to OK Computer as The Million Dollar Hotel soundtrack is to U2's more mainstream sound. Radioheads's art can be heard in Kid A, but it may not be appreciated by a wide audience.
B00004XONN|5.0|The people saying that if some unknown band released this, we'd listen for about 10 seconds and then throw it away. . . that could very well be true, but it's irrellevant. Radiohead have gotten their foot in the door and bought themselves enough credibility with their previous albums for us to give them the benefit of the doubt long enough for this album to get its claws into us. There comes a point where a band is able to take risks, and many of them don't have the guts to try, only the great ones; the Pumpkins with Adore, PJ with No Code, to some extent Nirvana with In Utero, though I think they would have gone even farther if they'd had the chance. Unknown bands become known by being heard on the radio. This is anything but an album of radio hits, therefore it would never be played and the band would never be heard. I think part of where Radiohead was coming from was that they were at the point where they could try something like this and a reasonable amount of people would at least listen, which is all any band really has a right to ask for. They themselves have stated that the next album will be more radio-friendly, and so will appease the people who aren't really ready for this right now. Some consider this a dissappointment on what they expect to be a brilliant career. I consider it to be more of (what I expect will be) a slight digression in their sonic evolution . . . a wonderfull, beautifull digression.
B00004XONN|3.0|Almost everything in the late 90's has been horrible.  I sincerely hope 2000 encourages change -hopefully very soon .  Radiohead almost has it. What through me off was the electronic drum (reminiscent of the break-beat sound I grew tired of in  the middle 90's). I appreciate the departure from lyric-centric music, however, they are not bringing in anything really new.  <br />If their was no drum machine I would have rated this album higher. The drum machine has been beaten to death.<br />National Anthem...One word &quot;Spiritualized&quot;.

B00000IB4D|5.0|Not for the diehard Santana fan !  This is a wonderful blend of Brazilian melodies and Santana's Afro-Rhythmic Rock.  Many great guest artists, including John McLaughlin and Flora Purim, that breed many layers of texture and improvisation on some of Santana's best arrangements and songs.   Unfortunately, Carlos was losing his rock based audience, disenchanted and perhaps embarrassed by his religious turns, shown in this CD as well.  As shown recently, much of the pop audience  has matured and become more accepting of his multiple influences shown in Caravanserai and Borbolleta - and especially here! It would be great if Carlos was able to get this package re-released,or at least get some of these tracks re-issued in another compilation. . .  .
B00004XONN|1.0|Lots and lots of complaining about the new Radiohead. People either love it or hate it, understandably. I have a solution: For all you people out there that loved Pablo Honey and the more mainstream material of the 'Heads should trade up and support Supergrass. I'm loath to use a tactic such as this to promote someone other than the review subject, but if there was ever a group of music lovers who should appreciate the lads it's Radiohead fans. I cannot support Supergrass enough. I have been listening to their CD's NONSTOP since I bought them and they are simply brilliant. No art prog posing or meloncholy musings here, just simply the catchiest, groovinist tunes I've ever heard. These guys could pick up the standard 'dropped' by Radiohead and CLUB YOU with it! Check the guys out, I love Radiohead, but Chaz and the lads are the future-count on it!
0880381736|5.0|This is what really got me into fantasy! This book (and the rest of the series) is great! Tanis half-elven (the leader of the group) meets his friends long ago divided , but meet a new barbaric duo, one with a blue crystal staff of healing, and begin their quest for the legendary Dragonlance! They come upon many enimies in the quest, (even a few dragons!) but they slightly get away alive. The Half-elven Tanis, Human Barbarian Riverwind and soon to be husband Goldmoon the Healer, Flint the hot tempered Dwarf and somewhat of a sidekick Tas the Kender (more like thief), and last of all the young Mage Raistlin with a tattered body, all go on the perilous quest for the allmighty Dragonlance! I bet by now you are saying, &quot;What the heck is a 'Dragonlance'?&quot; Right? Well dragons once only myths are now returning to their world, Krynn. The Dragonlance was forged many years back before the Cataclysm to destroy dragons. The party will try to remove dragons from Krynn. Now i spose you are saying, &quot;What the heck is the 'Cataclysm'?&quot; Right? The Cata. was pretty much the destruction of all Krynn. Not very many &quot;things&quot; survived. What did, built up their species in the time they had between the Cata. and the book. I recomend this book for ages 12 or up, or if you kind of like fantasy and want to know what it really is, THIS IS A GREAT BOOK FOR YOU!!!!!!!<br />Thank you for reading my review and may the Force be with you!

B00003CWL5|2.0|After viewing &#34;American Beauty&#34; for the very first time, and I found myself confronted with the most viscerally negative reaction I can ever recall experiencing toward a film. Two words immediately spring to mind: DISAPPOINTMENT and OUTRAGE.  DISAPPOINTMENT, because the film simply lacks the requisite quality for the manifold awards and laurels it has received, and OUTRAGE, because this movie is billed as a &#34;provocative and wickedly funny&#34; satire, and a &#34;defining achievement in cinematic history.&#34; Provocative, indeed, it is; &#34;wickedly funny,&#34; and &#34;a defining achievement,&#34; it most certainly is NOT!<br /><br />&#34;American Beauty&#34;  is a film which purports to make a stinging social commentary about the barrenness of American life at the dawn of a new millennium, and the need for people to wake up and see beauty in their surroundings.  The vehicle for this message is ironically a pair of dysfunctional suburban families.  Meet the Burnhams:  Lester, a middle-aged &#34;burn-out&#34; at work; completely alienated from his hyperkinetic and overambitious wife, Carolyn, and his moody teenage daughter, Jane.  Meet also the Fittses:  Frank, a retired Marine Corps colonel - a rabid homophobe and an abusive &#34;control freak&#34; toward his voyeuristic, detached teenage son, Ricky, and his semi-catatonic wife, Barbara.<br /><br />In a film which somehow seeks to educate its viewers on the beauty of life, we have scenarios like these placed before us:  Lester lusts after his daughter's girlfriend, a teenager with a wildly scatological mouth. He quits his $60,000 a year job and  takes a  job flipping burgers at a fast food joint, he buys his &#34;dream car,&#34; and he begins smoking pot.  Carolyn begins a torrid affair with a rival real estate agent, a fact which doesn't seem to bother Lester at all when he finds out about it.  Frank forces Ricky to give urine samples to test for drug use, and, fearing that his son is gay, beats on him repeatedly.  Jane begins sleeping with Ricky, and suggests he put her lecherous father &#34;out of his misery.&#34;<br /><br />All this in the name of &#34;beauty.&#34;<br /><br />&#34;American Beauty&#34; is billed as a &#34;wickedly funny&#34; satire.  Now, when I read or hear the word &#34;satire,&#34; I immediately associate it with the word &#34;humor.&#34; That humor can be black, acerbic, biting, ironic, or dry...it doesn't matter.  My point is, I believe that satire, in order to be effective, must be imbued with at least a modicum of humor.  And humor is one quality &#34;American Beauty&#34; does not possess.<br /><br />I find nothing funny about  a 42-year old man engaging in overtly lewd daydreams about, and sexual overtures toward, a teenage girl;  nothing funny about  a homophobic, bigoted father forcing his son to give urine samples to test for drug use, or repeatedly beating on him for infractions of his &#34;rules;&#34;  nothing funny about a man threatening violence toward his wife by throwing a platterful of asparagus at the dining room wall;  nothing funny about a teenage daughter wanting to see her father dead.<br /><br />The only scenes in the entire movie which rise to the level of humor - albeit humor of the blackest variety - are the sex scene between Carolyn Burnham and Buddy Kane, the &#34;Real Estate King.&#34; That, and the scene when newly cuckolded, burger-flipping Lester catches his wife with her aforementioned partner. Those scenes did, in fact, evoke from me a wry chuckle or two.<br /><br />Now, I will concede, that &#34;American Beauty&#34; is an artistically and technically brilliant film. Kevin Spacey, Annette Bening, Thora Birch, Mena Suvari, Chris Cooper, and Wes Bently all excel in their roles. Spacey may even have deserved his Oscar. The cinematography is superb. The screenplay is eloquent and lyrical.  Put these things together, and what you should come up with a masterpiece. Film critics, the Academy of Motion Picture Artsand Sciences, and the public at large all seem to think that's exactly what they've got...a masterpiece, I mean.<br /><br />Alas, I do not share in that sentiment. For the life of me, I cannot understand why &#34;American Beauty&#34; remains such a critical and box-office success. Throughout this film's two hour, two minute running time, it remained for me little more than a lame attempt at witty social commentary, and a plodding, dreary film which was a drudgery to sit through.and Sciences, and the public at large all seem to think that's exactly what they've got...a masterpiece, I mean.<br /><br />Alas, I do not share in that sentiment.

No, it's Radiohead.<br />A successful fusion of ambient electronica and UK pop.<br />I got this CD the day it came out, and have listened to it countless times. All I can say is that it's easily one of the better albums to come out since OK Computer.<br />It's an extremely difficult listen, but is more than worth it. Prepare to grunt, grimace, hold your ears..just like the best Autechre or Aphex Twin albums. But once you're through the barrier, there's no turning back.<br />Give the cd a chance, and if you like intelligent, thoughtful, but barely accessible music for your mind, you just might see that this is one of the better albums to come around for a long time.<br />Can't wait for their next effort.
6303433766|2.0|Despite the rave reviews and stylish directing coupled together with a pair of fine performances, Heavenly Creatures was simply too weird for my tastes.  It's an art film, an abstract expressionists impression of what the world looks like through somebody elses eyes. Unfortunately those eyes are a pair of oddball friends who fall into a fantasy world from which they can not (nor desire) to leave.  It's not to say this is a bad film, just not for everyone, as I concede my favorites like Taxi Driver and Boogie Nights might not strike the same cord with others as it did me.  Especially good is Winslet, who prior to this I knew only as Rose from Titanic.  It's hard to imagine her fleshing out such an emotionally crippled character which she does with remarkable effectiveness and will make it very hard for me to critize her acting ability again.  It's worth checking out, that is if you can stomach an hour and a half of dancing clay figurines and ditsy dream sequences before things get really good.
B000050IMJ|4.0|It is true that this story is made for specific crouds only - men, and car lovers.  The extensive and impressive line of cars is definatly what kept the attention of the viewer, not to mention the sex-while-stealing-a-car scene, which is definatly one to remeber.  But besides the beautiful cars, the movie has a very unrealistic, phoney plot: stealing 50 cars all in one night.  The peak of ridiculousness reaches when Cage manages to escape poilce by flying many feet into the air over a huge truck. Take it from me - the cars are great, and Angelina Jolie is fabulous, but if your looking for a good story, look elsewhere!
B00003W8NM|4.0|I recently saw two movies about middle class crisis: American Beauty and Fight Club.  Fight Club's better.<br />Both are about middle class men getting just a little disillusioned with their lives.  Both document a descent into rebellion and insanity.  America Beauty does this by providing us with a timid, watered down &quot;Surrealism, Unplugged&quot; glimpse that attempts to redeem itself by taking itself far too seriously.  Fight Club does this by punching you square in the nose - definitely the choice for people who aren't afraid of having their sensibilities challenged.<br />It's nice to see a movie that doesn't pull its punches, and it was refreshing to see that this movie was nothing like what the title would imply.  It is further gratifying to see all the confused people who take the rebellion seriously, just as it was fun to see others wet themselves out of fear that their beliefs might be challenged.<br />Ultimately, Fight Club (as well as American Beauty) is about the self-absorption that comes of realizing that things aren't working, and the inevitable purile fantasies of rebellion and revenge that follow.<br />The directing was fantastic, showing quite a bit more originality and creativity than that provided by a bed of rose petals, and the acting was spot-on.  The only downside to this movie was the ending that took itself almost as seriously as American Beauty, attempting to give a logical explanation to everything, rather than leaving what came before as the cartoon that it really needs to be.  Kind of like this review.<br />And, oh yeah, I nearly peed myself, I laughed so hard.  This was just a fun, in-your-face funny movie.  That's the real point isn't it?
B00004SCX6|5.0|Britney Spears may not have the most amazing voice, but the girl knows how to deliver. Her second Cd does have hints of her first album, but who cares. Why change a good thing. The Cd kicks off with a bang with &quot;OOPs... I Did it Again&quot;, goes into the catchy, upbeat &quot;Stronger&quot;( which has a great lyric &quot;My lonliness ain't killin me no more&quot;) Other highlights include the funky &quot;What you See is What You Get, and the fun &quot;Lucky&quot;.Britneys ballads are a lot better than the last ones. A beautiful song called &quot;Don't Let Me Be the Last to Know&quot; was written by Shania Twain husband, and is perfect for Britney. If you enjoyed the first album you will love this CD.
0385484518|4.0|This was a great inspirational book. The best part of this book was the character, Morrie. You can't help but love him from the start. He's such an energetic, old man with so much wisdom that you feel like you've known him your whole life. This book makes you laugh and cry. Morrie opens your eyes to life, death, love, and family. He gives you humorous bits of wisdom and little life lessons that help you see death in a different light.<br />This book is about Morrie and his old college student, Mitch. Mitch loses touch with Morrie after college and forgets the important things in life. After Morrie catches ALS (a terminal illness), he guests on Nightline. Mitch happens to see the show and gets in touch with his old professor. They start visiting every Tuesday and Morrie shares with Mitch his life lessons and words of wisdom before he dies of the ALS.

Like the fabs,they take rock into frightening &amp; alien territory.As great a fan of the Beatles as I am,I have considered for a while that OKC is perhaps the best CD ever.Is Kid A as good? Maybe. Only time will tell,but it is a work of undoubted genius and I cannot recommend it high enough.Buy it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00000G3Q4|5.0|One of, if not the, biggest cult horror film of all time makes it's long awaited debut on DVD...and fans will not be disappointed.  Elite Entertianment has brought Sam Raimi's EVIL DEAD to us in an impessive collector's edition with enough extras to make any deadite fan happy.  First off, let's talk about the quality of the presentation.  In a word: excellent.  I've seen Evil Dead a number of times on video and I can safely say that i have never seen Evil Dead look this good.  The film is presented in it's original full-frame aspect ratio and the print is extremely clean.  The audio has been remixed in both a 2.0 stereo and 5.1 dolby surround soundtrack and I doubt that this film has looked or sounded this good...well, ever.  The DVD also contains a number of exciting extras including the films trailer, a still gallery, and about 20 minutes of raw behind the scenes footage.  The most exciting features, however, have to be the disks two audio commentary tracks.  One is a very insightful track featuring director Sam Raimi and Producer Rob Tapert.  The other track is the real gem of the disk.  A seperate audio track featuring star Bruce Campbell.  This is one of the most entertaining and funny tracks you will ever come across, as Cambell takes great liberties to make fun of the film, the director, and himself.  I don't know what Anchor Bay's future release of Evil Dead will hold, but for my money, this is the best version of the film that any fan could ever hope to own.
B00003CXGG|4.0|This is one of the most entertaining movie from Holly wood after the movie &quot;The Matrix&quot; I really like the Stunts in this movie and the way they have presented the special effects.
B00003CXHJ|3.0|This was a pretty good movie, don't get me wrong.  I just think they could have done much more with the story.  First off, I think the acting was great.  Matthew McConaughey was, as usual, brilliant as Lt. Andrew Tyler.  His character is firmly established within the first 20 minutes of the film.  The supporting cast was also great, including Bill Paxton as Lt. Commander Mike Dahlgren.<br />My problem with this film was that the character development overshadowed the tension and action of this film.  I never felt the desperation that should have been established for recovering the Enigma box.  This was the plot device used, but it was not introduced well.  They needed to establish that the intelligence community had been trying unsuccessfully for months to crack the code.  This might have added something to the story.  Second, there could have been a lot more tension/action established throughout to give the viewer more of a feel of submarine warfare.  We only get a couple of looks at it; at the beginning and at the end of the film.  I thought there should have been at least one more scene, maybe one explaining submarine warfare at that period of time to the audience.<br />This was a decent drama.  I think it should be watched at least once.  However, if you're after a really good submarine movie, go check out THE HUNT FOR RED OCTOBER.
B00003CXGG|1.0|The popular cinema has taken a paradigm shift and I believe movies like &quot;Romeo Must Die&quot; is a recognised example. Its in the hands of viewers to refuse being entertaiend by a low quality script and direction.
B00004UEDQ|4.0|Sandra Bullock delivers a powerful performance in this film as Gwen, an alcoholic, pill popping journalist.  She is introduced as she arrives at her sister's wedding 45 minutes late and drunk.  We begin to see her as other people see her:  inconsiderate, rude, and an embarassment.  After ruining the wedding cake, stealing a limo, and plowing into a house, she is sentenced to 28 days in a rehab clinic.<br />It is here that we are slowly exposed to the &quot;real&quot; Gwen, the one that is hidden under the haze of alcohol and drugs.  Sandra Bullock gives the performance of her career in showing Gwen slowly realizing that she needs help and that, if she only reaches out to those around her (not only her co-rehabs, but her family as well), they will be glad to help her.  We see her trying to hold onto her independence while, at the same time, trying to establish a link with those around her.  This performance is only aided by the great supporting cast.  None of the supporting characters are thoroughly fleshed out, but the actors portraying them give us enough of a glimpse that their presence only makes the film stronger.<br />This is a definite must see drama.  If you're a Sandra Bullock fan, you should love this movie.  I'll be disappointed if she doesn't get nominated for an Oscar in this role.
B00003CXGG|3.0|the action is superb.A movie which will keep you awake.
B000005RFQ|3.0|While for the most part I had only appreciated Sabbath with Dio fronting the band, a friend turned me on to this album in 1995. I was asked to guess when it had been released and I said 1992 (off by almost a decade-1983). Since then, this album has enjoyed moderate rotation during beer fests, and I can't help but really like the way Gillan sounds with the band. <br />The band takes Dio's &quot;Sword and the Sorceror&quot; lyrical m.o. and backs it with some amazingly heavy and thunderous metal stylings, then dips the whole thing in somewhat murky production values. Guess what? It works. The musicianship on the album is great (as always) but longtime Sabbath fans (of either Dio or Ozzy fame) will have to give Gillan's voice a chance. I've seen more than a few people initially turned off by it grow to like it before the CD finishes. <br />Stand out numbers include &quot;Trashed&quot;(personal fave) and &quot;Disturbing the Priest&quot; which sounds like it could have come from a horror movie soundtrack (albeit a good one). Of note: Ward left the band after recording the album and was replaced by ELO drummer Bev Bevan, which is why his picture is on the inner sleeve.<br />By the way the same friend that turned me on to this album also insisted that I re-examine the Ozzy years. Now I like them all (just about), but this album is certainly special for the group's one time line up with Gillan (though not for everyone).
B00004XONN|4.0|I don't have the time or will power to analyze every dehumanizing line or synth riff. Many seem to think that this music has never been made before. Anyone who has heard anything on Warp Records (on of Yorke's favorite labels) and Mo' Wax knows that the drum patterns and subtle, occasionly subconscious, ambient and artificial rhythm is entirely derivitive of Autechre and early Aphex Twin. People who see this as innovative must have lived in a cave-like dwelling for the last decade. However, simply putting the complex rhythmatic ideas into an album able to hit the top ten is commendable. Even DJ Shadow has applyed more creativity to this type of music than Radiohead. David Bowie's &quot;Low&quot; is way more challenging than this and it was written over 20 years ago! The lyrics, while better than most other albums this year, are devoid of the wit and criticism that turned OK Computer into a classic. There are intreasting songs (most notably, Everything In Its Right Place&quot; and &quot;The National Anthem&quot;, maybe &quot;In Limbo&quot;), but they are not part of some revolution in texture.
B000002GB6|5.0|If you like &quot;Feels So Good&quot; you're right! So does &quot;Hide &amp; Seek&quot;, &quot;Theme from &quot;Side Street&quot; and &quot;The XIth Commandment&quot;. Great hits!

Your music sounds cool.
0688171664|5.0|This book obviously rings true in the hearts and minds of many people.  I don't agree with some of the things in it, and think that maybe there is even a better word for the book's central concept than &quot;Quality&quot; (though I can't think of one--maybe that's part of its indefineability.)  That fact remains however, that he awakened in me a way of looking at the world that changes everything.  Baseing actions and viewpoints on the &quot;quality&quot; in things can save a lot of wasted effort in life, and make that life much more enjoyable. That, I think is the book's greatest point, and what I took from it.  Pirsig tried to write his book as a classic, and I think he succeeded.
B00002DE2L|2.0|I am annoyed at Anne-Sophie Mutter. Her new release on Deutsche Grammophon [289 463 259-2] There isn't much to say about the Vivaldi except that there's more performance than music. As for the packaging...well, it's silly. The packaging is bright, artsy and blatantly manipulative; it looks like more money was put into the CD cover and book than in the recording itself.
B00003CXAT|5.0|65 million years ago, dinosaurs became extinct. In 1993, imagination, science and technology came together, bringing these remarkable creatures back from extinction in a spectacular motion picture that became a worldwide phenomenon: Jurassic Park. A Steven Spielberg film starring Sam Neill, Laura Dern, Jeff Goldblum and Richard Attenborough, Jurassic Park is a breathtaking adventure that opens the gate to a lost world, the incredible world of the dinosaurs.<br />On a remote island in the west coast of Costa Rica, a venture capitalist called John Hammond figured out an astonishing recovering and cloning technique to re-create dinosaurs from DNA fragments preserved in amber. He started a company called InGen, which placed the genetically engineered dinosaurs in a theme park called Jurassic Park. Before opening the attraction to the public, Hammond invites a top paleontologist, a paleobotanist, a mathematician/theorist, and his two eager grandchildren to experience the park and help calm anxious investors. However, their visit is anything but tranquil as the park security system breaks down and the prehistoric creatures break out... This is the original story of Jurassic Park, a simple but well developed idea based not only on the best-selling novel by Michael Crichton, but also on truly scientific evidences.<br />It presents a world lost by time and by the human kind, a world where nature and its inhabitants used to live in perfect harmony. In order to evoke this lost world, Jurassic Park makes use of striking visual and sound effects that depicts faithfully these extraordinary creatures which were the dinosaurs, how they were and how they lived;  and a wonderful soundtrack composed and conducted by John Williams, which is the spirit of this unforgettable adventure, one of the greatest successes in the history of Cinema, winner of three Academy Awards.<br />This incredible motion picture goes 6,5 million years back of evolution to inspire millions of people today and give us what we humans must need: hope. Because although dinosaurs appear to be the real creatures, we are the villains of this story  which is life. And as the birds fly away at the end of the film it is time to think about our own existence and our place in the world habitat. Nature cannot be contained, cannot be controlled by men. \\"Life finds a way\\". As Spielberg said during filming of this biogenetics adventure \\"My interest is in making a good movie that honors the existence of dinosaurs\\". And he really made it!give us what we humans must need: hope. Because although dinosaurs appear to be the real creatures, we are the villains of this story  which is life.

B000001AJG|5.0|Truly a masterpiece! Calm,soothing,emotional and intense. Let Stevie take you on a journey throughout out nature and the world Japan,LA,India etc. This album will guide you. If this album wasn`t hated upon it`s release by all the Non-Believers that Stevie mentions, I feel strongly it could have united people of all different nations. Every song has it`s place and quite frankly RACE BABBLING is one of the coolest songs ever! Play it for your kids and when u listen to it... Headphones only!
B000002AGN|5.0|Time out is one of the most popular jazz albums or all time, and Take 5 is one of the most popular songs.  Although I think many people see past the rest of this album and just concentrate on Take Five.  Blue Rondo A La Turk is probably my favorite song on the album (probably due to my love for Stan Getz).  I recomend this album toanyone, jazz lover or not, you will be hearing a part of history, and will love the music.
B00004XONN|1.0|As someone who considers himself a die-hard Radiohead fan, I immediately ordered this album the instant I heard about its upcoming release. Upon its arrival, I rushed out to the car to give a listen.<br />Sadly, after forcing myself to leave this disk in the changer for the past four days, little of it has grown on me. Things start off nicely, with the eerie soup of &quot;Everything in its Right Place&quot; recalling much of the feel of earlier works, with some new textures. A perfect song for brooding while driving really fast. But from there, things mellow into an eerily calm, unemotional stupor. C'mon Thom! Is someone slipping you guys valium/prozac? Where is the energy, the &quot;bite&quot; of the music we've come to expect from Radiohead? For the first time ever, I'm disappointed.
B00000IPAX|2.0|Earlier this year, i wrote a reveiw giving this cd a great name. But as the time has gone by I have gotten quite sick of the Blink 182 I am now seeing every second on MTV, doing dumb commercials, and changing their sound just to be big. Man, I am really upset to see a group of funny guys who used to masters at the punk rock scene sellout. Their music used to be so awsome, but now, it's cheezy pop with dumb lyrics. The songs are catchy, i have to admit, and i listen to this album when i'm really in the mood, but still I thought Blink could've done a lot better with their old sound.  I mean Dammit was an awsome single, and if they would've just stuck to the Chesire Cat and Dude Ranch sound they could've made punk rock huge.  I still haven't lost hope completely for Blink. Maybe they will go back to how they were a few years ago, but right now i'm dissappointed to see my favorite band go down the drain. All you punkers out there, stick with NOFX for now.
0783225881|5.0|I met W. P. Kinsella, the author of &quot;Shoeless Joe,&quot; at a book-signing in Dallas.Since &quot;Field of Dreams&quot; is my favorite film, I naturally asked him if others were as deeply affected by it as I was.  He said that he still gets a couple of calls every week from viewers who fell under the spell of the film.  His favorite was a call from a man in Houston who told Kinsella, &quot;I saw your damn movie, then drove a couple of thousand miles to Seattle to visit my dad and tell him I love him.  I damned near lost my job.  I hope you're happy, Kinsella.&quot;  Well, that's the kind of movie this is.  It tells each of us a little about ourselves and makes us better individuals just for having watched it.  Kevin Costner and James Earl Jones give unforgettable performances.  Why Jones has never won an Academy Award is beyond me. The final scene is so moving and so uplifting, it is hard to imagine anyone not moved by it.  Do yourself a favor.  Buy the DVD and get ready to watch this film over and over again.

This book is totally great, and when I was reading it, I imagined myself in the book, in the same place, and doing the same things the five Children did. It is funny, that &quot;IT&quot;, asks for food, and how creative the author is, because the wishes only lasts until sunset. I loved the book. Congratulations Edith Nesbit!
0876852630|4.0|Every employer's ultimate nightmare Bukowski, brutally and often hilariously, describes the endless dead-end jobs he held to pay for roof, food, and booze, taking care to notice the rough poetry of faceless people on the social low-end, making a case for why (as Stendhal wrote somewhere) a proper poet should be a poor poet.<br />In books like &quot;Women&quot; Bukowski often ends up rambling on forever on the same subjects, but in &quot;Post Office&quot; and &quot;Factotum&quot; he stays much more focused and economical. &quot;Factotum&quot; is the book that even people who can't stand Bukowski often like.
B000002UAR|2.0|While the early Beatles and the final album (Abbey Road) are good, I find the transition period (Revolver &amp; Sgt. Pepper) pretty erratic.  While people put &quot;Eleanor Rigby&quot; on a pedestal, how can one say that it represents the completeness of the Beatles, since the backing music is purely orchestral?  On the other hand, &quot;Taxman&quot; reaches back to the magic of the early days.  Then again, &quot;Tomorrow Never Knows&quot; is a mess, and a hint of the self-indulgent chaos forthcoming on The White Album. 2-stars.
0452281881|5.0|e is brilliant. <br /> This book is realistic enough to astonish and hilarious enough to have me laughing out loud on the train. It is brain candy for the cyber-addicted. &quot;e&quot; should be read by anyone who thinks their job is more important than their real life.<br />The author has improved on the Bridget Jones idea. Thank you Matt Beaumont.
B000002B2X|5.0|After &quot;Facelift,&quot; Alice In Chains were placed with the Metal/Grunge lable. Considered incredibly depressing, bleak and heavy, that must have made this release all the more surprising.<br />Next to &quot;Facelift&quot; it's a complete 180 turn. The tunes are soft, melodic and soothing. Still there is the bleakness, but not depressingly so...this whole album has a dreamy overtone that shows their psychedelic influences. Everything here is perfectly structured, the lyrics are wonderful, and even more impressing is the acoustic fill-ins by guitarist/co-songwriter Jerry Cantrell.<br />Let's go with the songs. &quot;Brother&quot; is very special to me, for various personal reasons, and the lyrics can be interpreted in almost any way to give a sense of hope. &quot;Got Me Wrong,&quot; with it's groovy verses and unmistakable chorus, turned out to be one of AIC's biggest radio hits ever, and it's success pushed SAP to gold (and recently platinum) satus. I don't like to pick best songs, espescially with a group as good as Alice In Chains, but if I had to pick one song they did as their best, &quot;Got Me Wrong&quot; would likely be the one. From there is &quot;Right Turn&quot; which features some of the leaders of the Seattle movement...Chris Cornell of Soundgarden and Mark Arm of Mudhoney. The track is as good as any acoustic song AIC has done. And finally, there is &quot;Am I Inside?&quot; written by vocalist Layne Staley, and Cantrell. It's dreamy and coaxing, and must be one of the most beautiful songs I have ever heard.<br />The material here is dark, like I said, but not depressing. The best frame to listen to this is after a hard day, just sit down and enjoy it from start to finish, it really helps you unwind. There aren't as many obvious drug referances as their other albums, and Staley's voice is better than ever. The goofy hidden track is quite funny, but I'm not sure if it belongs here...<br />I can't really say if this is their best album, maybe it isn't...but I listen to this more than any of the others, because it's easier to listen to. One thing is for sure...if you are a huge AIC fan (like me) or are thinking of becoming one, this album is an absolute must have. It is well worth the price of a regular CD.
B00004UBBG|3.0|Wagner goes glam. In many respects The Hoople is Hunter and the band's implosion of everything glam. It takes all the cliches and pushes them to the extreme. I wouldn't be surprised to find Wagner's The Ring Cycle buried somewhere in the production. The bombastic production works to the album's advantage and nearly makes up for the lesser material.<br />I had forgotten how much I hated this album when it first came out hot on the heels of the band's finest Columbia album (Mott). Time has allowed The Hoople to age gracefully and what seemed shrill then seems fun now. The sound quality is a major step up over the domestic version of this album on CD. The booklet also tries to be as faithful to the original cover art as possible (that wasn't the case with the first CD). I would have liked to see this reissued like the Roxy Music remasters in an LP style sleeve with mimiciking the original album but I suppose that would be too much to ask for.<br />The opening and closing tracks bracket this CD with two great late period MTH songs. The bonus tracks have been available before (on the Greatest Hits CD, Mott the Hoople Anthology and All the Young Dudes Anthology)so they aren't rare. It would have been nice to have the alternate version of Through the Looking Glass and Saturday Gigs on here as well (and maybe some unreleased bits of studio chatter as well).<br />Still, all in all, this is more than I could have asked for with it's stellar sound and great booklet. Wagner would have been proud if he liked rock 'n' roll.
B00003CXGG|4.0|It was one of the coolest movies i have seen this month. I would recommend it to every action movie buff,its worth it.
B00004THAY|5.0|A lot has been said about this excellent album, but for a truly great example of Eric Clapton with another blues great, check out &quot;The Jimmy Rogers All Stars/Blues Blues Blues.&quot;  Jimmy and his authentic Chicago blues band do duets with majer rock stars who were influenced by him.  Clapton does two great songs.  Mick Jagger, Keith Richards do three, Robert Plant and Jimmy Page do one and Taj Mahal does two.  Also prominent throughout is the great Johnnie Johnson, the piano player on most of Chuck Berry's hits.

0944379044|5.0|The Best Kept Record of Any Horrific Historical Happening...thats all I can say
B00000IMCW|2.0|First off, the movie didn't hold up to how I remembered it. But if you're considering buying the DVD, chances are you love the movie. So I am not going to review it. But I was disappointed in the DVD itself. The back cover says \\"5.1 Surround\\" but there is nothing here. I even got up and put a different DVD in my player to be sure my rear and left and right speakers were working.I didn't expect start of the art sound, but saying &quot;5.1 Surround&quot; on the back cover is an total lie! If you have a good quality video version of this movie, the DVD will not be any better.
B00003CXE7|5.0|From the moment the preview slammed the television sets and the movie theaters with 'Bawitdaba' by Kid Rock, I knew this was going to be a hit...and not just a small one. I guess in Ancient Rome, they didn't do anything small, and in this example of the Gladiator games that took place during those times, they really DIDN'T do anything small. Director Ripley Scott has a classic on his hands and he knows it. The story follows Maximus (Russell Crowe, who is not exactly known for his action credentials) a Roman general who is deemed a traitor and made into a participant in one of the most brutal contests of all time. Joaquin Phoenix's performance almost makes you want to reach out and smack the living daylights out of him (which means he did a great job in his role). Ridley Scott's masterful work behind the camera is evident from the opening scene, eerily foreshadowing the rest of the movie. What this means I leave to you to find out. Worth the money for DVD? Without a doubt. The surround sound will make you shiver with anticipation as the roar of the crowd at the Roman Coliseum is enough to almost make a man wet his pants...both in the movie and out of. Just one thing to keep in mind, this movie is NOT for the faint of heart. Be ready for a wham-bam, sense-slamming experience that isn't without it's portion of beheadings (and with two swords!). Enjoy!
B00004XONN|5.0|Half of this is sensational, half good. Kid A is a much more varied project and much less sentimental than their previous efforts. It's hard to pin down because of the variety but there is a far away other worldly feel all the way through. It's like being homesick on another planet. I know what this feels like from my time in space :-) These are my fave tracks and the order I like to take them:<br /><br />  How To Disappear Completley<br /><br />  Morning Bell<br /><br />  Kid A<br /><br />  Motion Picture Soundtrack (3:18)<br /><br />  Everything in its Right Place<br /><br />  National Anthem.<br /><br />These are genuine stunners as good as anything the band has ever done. The others are in the good but not great category. Excellent album.
B00003CX8J|4.0|After enduring years of countless rumors, the motion picture event that comic book junkies alike have waited for has arrived. While there were many heroes that were missing and others who appeared to be too young to be major contributors to the story, the movie itself does a good job recreating everyone's favorite merry mutants to the silver screen. While I am slightly disappointed in the lack of characters like Gambit and Psylocke (Yes, I collected X-Men in my younger days), I was overall happy with the way the film was finished. The casting directors could not have produced a better person to play Professor X than Patrick Stewart while Ian mcKellan convinced the audience that the only way for humanity was his way and no other. I envisioned Wolverine to be physically larger than Hugh Jackman, however, his quick wit and wry smile fit the role better than expected. Yes, there were several discrepencies between the comic book and the movie itself, but definitely a good effort. Halle Berry as Storm? W..O..W. Her every appearance seemed to command respect from fellow mutants alike. Funnily enough, there were even cameos for those of you who are more familiar with the X-Men. Exactly who appears I will not say for the benefit of those who have yet to watch this movie, but keep your eyes open and you'll recognize many characters, both new and old. All in all, a good movie with stupendous efforts from the cast, producers, and the director. While I found the story to be somewhat...lacking, the effects can almost more than make up for this apparent oversight. Personally, I can't wait to see who they decide should be in the next one.

But let's be realistic-it's all about the money, and as sequel after sequel has proven, Michael Myers can certainly rake it in. This 7th installment is in my mind the third and final chapter in the story of Laurie Strode, who comes to realize her evil brother Michael is out to kill her, at any cost. The movie's soundtrack was lacking in the originality department(I suggest John Ottman's original score for the movie, entitled &quot;Portrait of Terror&quot;) and it was definitely too short. However, it cleanly deals with the truth of Haloween: When the evil comes to find you, you must face your fate.   3,4,5,6,and the forthcoming 8 may be good movies, and any true Halloween efficionado should own them (except for 3-what the heck was with &quot;The Season of the Witch&quot; anyway? ). But &quot;Halloween&quot;, &quot;Halloween 2&quot; and &quot;H20:Twenty years later&quot; are the true embodiment of what terrified us all one Halloween night, all those years ago.
B00003CXFG|4.0|For those people who actually watch movies for entertainment and not to try to annoy every other person in the theatre, this would be a good movie. There are substancial artsy features in the movie that made me like it all on their own....the fantastic lighting and color scheme for example. The plot is okay for the new movie season...if you can make a COMPLETELY origional movie up in your mind then you are a millionaire waiting to happen. The movie is nothing like alien or aliens...it has no super gun fights, and its not a super-human standoff against the aliens either. Its simply an entertaining movie with very good visual effects...and i would recommend it to everyone.
B00004T9UF|4.0|For those who concentrate heavily on lyrical content rather than hooks and beats, I would recommend not listening to this album. At all. However, for those of us who tend to laugh-off Eminem's twisted and demented outlook on life, get ready to enjoy his sophomore set. Listening to &quot;The Marshall Mathers LP&quot; is actually like sitting through a movie, albeit, a violent one. Eminem's style of rapping changes from track to track; from a comical/I'm-just-kiddin' tone, to a sympathetic, almost normal tone, to a downright shut-up-or-I'm-gonna-kill-you shriek of violence. This, fused in with the infectious beats and hooks (not to mention the almost hysterically funny skits) makes this album stand out among most of the records released in the last 10 years or so. I reiterate, if you're gonna take what he's rapping about seriously, don't even bother popping this into your CD player. You're the one who may suffer a cardiac arrest; what with all the stress and anger you pent up after listening to about only 3 tracks. If that happens, I'll bet you're gonna be on Eminem's third set.
B00004XONN|2.0|I have to say from the outset that I'm a huge fan of radiohead, but what I see going on is that everyone is afraid to dash this album.  Is it different from the other radiohead albums...certainly.  It is about as far from the Bends as Pablo Honey is from OK Computer.  However, I think that lyrically this album is in need.  Musically, radiohead tries to break new ground, but I think that Brian Eno has been here before.  But, I do give them credit for trying something new, and I do realize that everyone was expecting OK Computer-part II, and no matter what, they were going to get flack for not delivering on the OK Computer-part II goods.  Having said that, I will give Kid A another listen, with my mind as open as the Grand Canyon and I will muster as much will power as I can to force myself to like this album, it is after all, the geniuses of radiohead.  But should I have to try to like this album?  I don't think so.  Everyone reviews this CD and says \\"it'll grow on you.\\"  All of radiohead's previous material \\"grabbed\\" me and forced me to be in awe of it.  This is their first effort that asks me with a soft, whinny voice, \\"please like me, I am different, and I will grow on you.\\"
B00004T9UH|5.0|This cd is so funky!! I know some of you out there don't like Real slim shady so i'll keep this short.  The song is so funky!!! I love it and I love The way i am.  like, e-mail me if you want. From,
B00004XONN|5.0|this cd is a trance inducing drug.  i've only listened to it 3 times over the period of 9 days, and i can not get some of the melodies and lyrics out of my head.  its haunting me, dammit!  i don't think radiohead missed the mark at all on this cd.  its just plain ole different then their previous 3, as each of the previous 3 were exclusively different from one another.  its not like the deftones, who tried to make ok computer meets siamese dream, with white pony, where i had to listen to it about 50 times before i wanted to believe it was actually them.  this is just a good, but different cd.
B00000JLXG|5.0|So, who cares if it's not the deepest movie of all time?  Neither was &quot;Gone With The Wind&quot;, a romantic epic that will live forever.  And so will &quot;Titanic&quot;, a film that has drama, romance, adventure, villains, heroes, laughter, horror.....in other words, something for everyone!  Even those few who are not completely enthralled with the unfolding love story of Rose and Jack will be bowled over by the spectacle of the ship that &quot;God himself could not sink&quot; gradually being submerged in the icy waters of the north Atlantic.  Only the hardest heart could fail to be touched by the musicians' grave farewell to each other, the mother in steerage comforting her two children in their berth, and the old couple lying in their final embrace in their bed, moments before water crashes in to flood the remaining decks.  I may buy an extra copy of this movie and save it for when my present copy is worn out!!
0684853523|5.0|From the time I heard about this book I was anxious to read it. I am but a moderate King fan and I wanted to hear and to learn from a writer marked by success.<br />This is an excellent autobiography written in a story format as well as an excellent teaching aid for aspiring writers. Seldom have writers of King's stature been so forthright and open.<br />His line, &quot;you must do two things read a lot and write a lot&quot; is simple and yet profound. His reading list and examples of good and bad writing offers clear insight and information that is easy to digest. A book to learn from as well as an excellent autobiography.<br />You will also read about the personal trials and tribulations of King and get a fair sense of his values and where his motivation lies. You may also come to the old adage, &quot;behind every great man is a great women&quot; as it is clear that with the love and support of King's wife he has been able to overcome many obstacles. From his drug and alcohol days to his more recent set back associated with a car accident.<br />This book is all that I thought it would be with some nice extra's on the personal revelations of the writer. EXCELLENT!
0688171664|5.0|I had heard a lot about this book since I was in grade school, but could never get around to reading it. I finally did read it a couple of years back and I dont know how to express how it went. All I can say is that one must read it. In brief, and only one way of looking at this one is, he is trying to define quality. But that is just a small part of the whole. He is very observant and its a great mix of philosopy with what we feel and he does a great job in patching the rest up. The best part is that its a story and not some text on philosopy. I like his writing style and you will notice all the thought he put into every small detail. Its very carefully written. I particularly liked his expression of gumption. Read it. You wont regret it.
B00004XONN|5.0|The most interesting thing about this album is the way in which Radiohead forge a coherent statement out of their very large set of influences. Autechre-style intelligent techno (&quot;Idioteque&quot;), Krautrock-influenced post rock (&quot;The National Anthem&quot;), and more ambient music (&quot;Treefingers&quot;) all have seats at the table, but the result never has the awkward feeling that has crippled many other efforts to fuse electronic and more rock-oriented music. It's remarkable how effectively Radiohead have remade themselves as a non-guitar band.<br />Many reviewers have commented upon the lack of radio-friendly hooks on the album. I think this is one of the album's strengths, because it allows the album as a whole to breathe without the odd interruptions of The Rock that made OK Computer an occasionally jarring experience. The individual songs flow into one another seamlessly, and if this makes it difficult to pick out singles for airplay, it also makes for a very pleasant listening experience. The relatively uptempo first half progresses pleasantly into the second half's more languorous sprawl without any noticeable loss of momentum.<br />Thom Yorke's lyrics have always struck me as a little histrionic, and this album's set is no exception. Fortunately, his voice is so heavily treated much of the time that it becomes just another element of the whole -- he's a talented singer, and he's learned more interesting things to do with his voice since OK Computer. The same themes predominate -- a seamy sort of estrangement from humanity being the overriding theme.<br />Each Radiohead album has been a little more out there than the one before. It was only with OK Computer that they fully caught my interest, but both that and Kid A are albums that I've come to love. I'll go out on a limb and will say that I think that people will eventually regard Kid A as a classic album, and OK Computer as the album that laid the groundwork for it. It's been put together with delicacy and precision, and it's one of the rare albums where it's possible to hear nearly all the work that went into making it.delicacy and precision, and it's one of the rare albums where it's possible to hear nearly all the work that went into making it.
B000003S0F|5.0|I already posted a review of this album (a masterpiece), urging you to buy it.<br />This is just a brief message urging you to do nothing of the sort.<br />That is: get this album by all means, but make sure that you buy the re-remastered 24-bit version, not the &quot;ordinary&quot; remastered 16-bit (I believe) edition. The ordinary version is plagued by bad sound (and, frankly, lacklustre mastering). The new version is very much better, and features the &quot;lost&quot; orchestral sound-check at the very end to boot.<br />The new version is currently available in a mini gatefold edition (with a slim booklet featuring unfortunately truncated news clippings). It should be available in a regular jewel case edition also, now or at least soon.
B00003CXGG|4.0|This movie is a great watch for all action lovers.  Its after a long time that we get to see such a movie and it refreshes you with for the 120 mins you are in the theatre.
B00004XONN|4.0|This is absolutely amazing! Listening to the song \\"National Anthem\\" on Kid A and you will not be hard put to find a perfect synergy of Bebop and the future of rock in their wildest freeplay. Being a Mingus fan myself  and having read his influences on Thom from the Radiohead interview on Juice, the whole picture of their metamorphosis began to unfold. The beauty of every Radiohead act is that, there is always an element of surprise, so much so that what follows OK Computer would inevitably be tagged Sydney Olympic opening ceremony the sequel. But what a shift - on first listen I was totally in awe, knowing that Thom is taking us to another mindscape of him or probably the future of all mankind. Fans of earlier albums like Pablo Honey and The Bends might be disappointed or completely lost. Well, find yourself some space in the wee small hours before your stereo, and remember to take the prescriptions in full(3 days a week)....happier, fitter, more productive, regular exercise at the gym....
0684853523|1.0|This is one of the few times when, after reading a book, I have felt compelled to come here and rate it. I give On Writing 1 star, simply because that is the lowest rating I am allowed to give.  <br /> I'm not a hardcore Stephen King fan, but I have read a lot of his books. It is therefore not his 'popular fiction' that I am criticizing, but rather his writing memoir.  <br /> There is actually very little information about WRITING in this book. The first third of the book is taken up by Mr. King's childhood, and the last third of the book is taken up by his accident. If all Mr. King wanted to do was to describe the minute details of this accident and his great courage in moving on with life, perhaps he should have waited for someone else to write his biography? As it is, PATHETIC is the only word that comes to mind. <br /><br /> The few tips on writing included in the book may provide some interesting conversational material (eg. did you know that Mr. King once wrote a book in one week?) but are otherwise useless. Is this book directed at aspiring writers, or at 1st grade children learning how to form words? Mr. King seems to think they are both the same; I have to disagree. <br /><br /> Mr. King wonders why people don't ask pouplar fiction writers about the 'language' in their books. Funny that someone who writes about his 'cataclysmically smashed hip' should ask that question.  <br /> It is not the tips on writing that stick in my mind after reading this book, but rather the lack of respect Mr. King has for his readers. I'd say Mr. King failed in his attempt to 'not waste my time'. But of course, I don't believe that was his real intent: selling us the book and making more money is probably closer to the truth.  <br /> If you're interested in Mr. King's life story (but not in his writing because alas, there's not much on that!) read this book. If, however, you're interested in books on writing, give Room to Write and Writing Down the Bones a try!
B00004T8RK|5.0|Wow. This one is super. I was really waiting for it and bought it the first day it came out and it was worth the wait. Nos. 7,8,9 and 11 are cool. This one is again very very different from all the others. They say the 'Ten Phase' is over. Its rock now. Although I was kind of disappointed but the music more than compensates for the complete change in their taste. Music is more mellow than before so its not as heavy. But, its mighty strong and the band has tons of good taste. They are not done yet. I am waiting for their next one.
B00000HZFH|4.0|This album takes the sprawling, beautiful pop epics from Built To Spill's Perfect From Now On and refines them down into sparkly, single-sized jewels. This album would be worthwhile if only for &quot;You Were Right&quot;, which is beautiful for the way it boils down my AOR-listening childhood into a 5-minute song, but there's so much more on this album, and the lyrics are as insightful and beautiful as ever. Pretty much a spotless album (with the exception of &quot;Broken Chairs&quot;, which goes on for far too long), and recommended to anyone who ever heard a Built To Spill song they liked.
B00004SCBF|5.0|I already posted a review of the &quot;ordinary&quot; (actually already remastered) version of Islands. An album which I, to be brief, consider to be one of Crimson's best (in spite of the generally opposing critical opinion and very much contrary to Robert Fripp's own views).<br />But I did at that time have to point out that the audio quality of that edition was poor, with the background noise alone threatening to ruin much of the appreciation of the often subtle and quiet music.<br />Now, however, there's this re-remastered 24-bit version, and it's a huge improvement soundwise. This is definitely the one to get if you haven't got one yet (so to speak). <br />And don't worry if the gatefold limited edition is sold out by the time you read this. The same version should be available in a regular jewel case as well. Just make sure it's the 24-bit version, alright?
B00004X01U|5.0|Music is Madonna latest album, and she is still pushing the boundaries of music and making way for artists to follow. The album has a very french techno sound, thanks to her fellow collaborator Mirwais, a french DJ. The album is more happier than 1998's Ray of Light, a little more upbeat. The title track lead off single is a fun song with addictive lyrics and a song that will keep you dancing. There are other great dance tracks on here, like the song Impressive Instant which has a killer baseline and dance beat. Runaway Lover is bound to be a single, its one of the more upbeat songs on the album, a very fun airy dance track. I Deserve It, is the first in reflective tracks. She reflects on her career, stating everything was worth it. Amazing is an ok song, probably my least favorite. Not very original, it sounds almost exactly like 99's Beautiful Stranger. Nobody's Perfect is another song where Madonna reacts to the media critiquing her for everything, she is not perfect. Her voice has been transformed a bit on this one, but its nice. Dont Tell Me is a wonderful addictive acoustic type track which has an R&amp;B type flavor. What It Feels Like For A Girl is a song which would be an anthem for young females everywhere, coping with the way girls are treated. Paradise (Not For Me) is also on Mirwais album, a little strange but a nice song overall. Gone closes the album, a very acoustic track which is a nice closer for the album, a highlight. Mirwais contributed mostly to this album, but Orbit still did a few songs. Its a good album, not as spectacular in my opinion as Ray Of Light. Its fun to listen to, but wears off a little after a while. Up there with her best works such as Ray of Light, Erotica and Bedtime Stories. Go and get it!
B000002O1Q|5.0|Select track six, close your eyes and listen to the amazing TIWIMTBY and you`ll be hooked forever. After 16 years of listening to this it has never been away from my favourite hit list. No where fast is a well re written song by jim steinman which originally featured on Meatloafs &quot;bad attitude&quot; but this album really comes to life when you have seen the movie and i guarantee this will become one of your favourites
B0000027RL|5.0|Words cant describe this one. Just listen to it.  The band agrees that there will never be another TEN. Its awesome.
0375707972|1.0|I was very disappointed in this book.  It was an insipid story told with very little style or emotion.  The author's attempts to enlighten are pathetically juvenile.  This may be the last time I follow one of Oprah's recommendations.  A true waste of my time.
B000002U9E|2.0|I first discovered Kate Bush when she released Lionheart.  I can no longer play that old vinyl album, so I thought I would buy it in CD.  After logging on and reading the reviews, I decided to by Hounds of Love instead.  If it's better than Lionheart, it must be great.  I am very disappointed.  She does not display her vocal range on this CD, which was one of the things I originally found fascinating in her music.  I didn't find the haunting or varied melodies I expected.  And only a few tracks demonstrated her abilities with lyrics.  Several of the reviews suggested her music had 'matured' with this CD.  My impression is that she dumbed it down, or made it more generic, to appeal to a wider audience.  I'm going back to Lionheart.
0780020685|5.0|I don't know what to say that hasn't been said before, but I have to sharewhat I think about this masterpeice. One of the things I always valued about movies is the characters, and presentation of those characters. 7 Samurai is all about that. The western notion that good movies are movies with a well thought out unexpected script is not true. Here you have a movie that has a plot that can be explained in one sentense, yet it makes you sit through the whole thing in complete silence.  This movie is all about emotion, and emotion has far more effect and impact than any twist and unexpected turn of a script can have. I could relate to every single of the 7 samurai, because at one or another point of my life I've embodied what they did and felt in the movie. Akira Kurosawa is one of the best directors, ever.
0684853523|5.0|Before I read King's new book, I wrote like this:<br />This book am so swell, it did teach me to rite more better now? And if it wernt so I wouldn't say so now would I? But some othe words were to big for  a durn fool like me.... But Ifelt bad about that time when he got hit by a truck and it did make him watch scary movies twoo....<br />And after I read the book, I improved remarkably:<br />I feel that Stephen King`s new memoir/how-to book is a great way to get a reality check. King doesn't pussy-foot around here. He lets the wanna-be writer know that writing is a serious craft that takes diligent time and effort. <br />Stephen King also recounts the ups and downs of his own crazed existence. This book is a must-read, not only for potential scribes, but for anybody who loves a good rags-to-riches story. We also get to know about Tabitha King, whose seems to have rescued her husband on a number of occasions. Without her, perhaps we never would have  gotten to know this great man's work. <br />The best thing about this book is it's friendly style. You feel that King is speaking directly to you. After a lifetime of honing his craft; he has the remarkable ability to leap off the page and have a personal conversation with millions of readers all over the world (a skill which he likens to Telekenisis).<br />A great read!
B000002BYD|5.0|Again, this album is different from the previous ones. I personally like the changes I see in their music. Its refreshing and I love it. Frankly, my opinions are going to be biased because I have followed this band right since 92 and have liked everything they have made. This one is more rockish than before and everything is not by eddie. The others have much bigger contributions and it just shows off their talent too. Brain of J, In hiding and No way are just too good. For any fan, this one is also a must.
B00000G09Q|5.0|this is just 1 of turtle things i like all my life i had admired  them alli just want to say that i love the turtles
B00000JG41|5.0|I don't think anything more can be said about this recording than the praise already shared by the majority of Amazon reviewers here. This album is amazing. My only gripe about this band is... do we have to wait another four to five years for a new album!
B00000IPAX|3.0|Even though I'm a big fan to thrash/death metal and hardcore music, I also like bands that plays punk style rock music. Blink 182 is a good band, their music is relaxing and smooth compared to heavy metal bands, and the lyrics crack me up. But I was a bit disappointed with this album... most of the songs sounds the same, and the guitar riffs are really simple and never seems to change... Anyways, this is a decent album, if you're a blink 182 or a punk rock fan, then you'll love this album...Nice cd cover...  :)
B00002MZ4W|5.0|FIONA APPLE'S CD &quot;WHEN THE PAWN...&quot; IS HER MOST SOULFUL AND SEXY ALBUM AS OF YET. THIS SOPHMORE RELEASE SHOWS FIONA HAS GREATLY MATURED SINCE&quot;TIDAL&quot; HER LYRICS PROVING HER TO BE A STRONGER WOMAN THAN A FEW YEARS AGO. I HIGHLY SUGGEST THIS ALBUM TO LISTEN TO ON A REGULAR BASIS - IT NEVER LEAVES MY CD PLAYER.
B000002AZ8|5.0|This second album was much anticipated. Obviously, it was not as great as Ten, but its really good. The music is kind of different but it sounds nice. The band proved that they have the talent to do it again and do it well. Tremor Christ, Betterman, Corduroy, etc are great. The riffs in Tremor Christ are excellent. I think this is a good buy.
0790749998|4.0|The movie is really fantastic with all the stunting actions. With Jet Li and Aaliyah the stars of the movie, their performances are great!!!

B000002552|5.0|Out of all the albums I have (and I have a lot) this is probably one of my favorites. Something about this album makes me tingle inside, as I listen to it I say &quot;this IS music&quot;.  A group of guys getting together and jamming.  No money involved, no fame to project, only pure and untainted art.  <br />There is no album that I recommend more than 'The Basement Tapes' (with the exception of The White Album).<br />Ciao<br />Dave
B00004YM0D|5.0|Remember the Titans is the kind of movie that I will remember for years and years to come, it is the best movie out there right now, in my opinion. The soundtrack is excellent and includes many of my favorite songs from the movie although, some really good songs were left out, it still brings the mighty titans back home.
0805062971|5.0|Not only is this book well written, but it makes you think and  i also saw the movie 5 times. It's constructed and put together very brilliantly and Chuck Palahniuk is a talented writer. I seriously think that everybody should a least rent the movie and watch it about 3 times. Some things they say are unforgettable and it's a great script all together. I would be lying if I said it didn't deserve 5 stars. It's just flat out great.
B00001U0GQ|1.0|Let me start by saying that there is only one reason to own this DVD:  morbid curiosity.  If you enjoy watching a great film horrendeously butchered by the addition of superifilous scenes, then buy this DVD.  If you like that akward, confused feeling you get when you realize a great line of dialogue has been inexplicably cut from one of your favorite movies, then buy this DVD.  If you hated the unbelievably haunting and moving song, &quot;I will follow&quot; which originally accompanied Hawkeye's pursuit of his love through the mountains near the end of the film, then buy this DVD.  And if you're in to long, preachy, forced speeches that turn what was once a touching moment between father and adopted son into a reason to hurl your remote control straight through the back of your television, then buy this DVD.  Otherwise, head up into the attic and dust off the ol' VCR.  Or else pray, as I do, that the original version of this film will soon be made available on DVD.  Because this expanded version stinks!
B0000024RQ|5.0|Avast ye maties! We have at our mits an album of simplicity and complexity all rolled into one.  This is Bob Dylan.  Probably at his best, though some would argue that his Highway 61 period was far more magical, musically speaking that is.  I tend to agree, but I also have a space in my heart for the true and beautifull. And Freewheelin' is about as beautifull as it gets.  The mixing of scratchy vocals, unexpericanced lyrics, and pure inoccense makes for Bob's best.<br />Bob's been through many musical and personal changes, but this is the Bob I love.  This is the Bob I will remember.  (not that he's dead yet)  You know, metaphorically speaking.<br />Ciao<br />Dave
0679879269|5.0|I first read the Golden Compass when it came out four years ago and was instantly hooked on the writting skill of Philip Pullman. I laughed and cried with the strong characters he had written in this wonderfull book. When the Amber Spyglass came out I bought it as soon as the book store opened. I loved the book. I never knew how an author could get such an emotional response out of a reader, for I was silently urging Will and Lyre on and wondering what would become of the unspoken love the had developed between them in that book. I wished with all my heart that this was a 7 book series rather than just a three, and wished that it would go on forever.<br />    All things must end though, and in all of my life I have never read a fictional book to impact me in such a way that the Amber Spyglass did. I picked it up the very first day, and could not put it down until I finished it at 2 am, and I cried for at least an hour after that. The ending is a surprise, and while I will not spoil it for anyone, I can say that I never saw it coming. I hope that Pullman graces us with his writing by making one last book to show us what is characters have done in 20 years or so. There will never be another series like this written again. Pullman almost recieved the Newberry for his first book in the series, if he does not recieve it for this one I will be surprised. If you are thinking about this book please consider it a wonderfull story for all ages. Also recommended is the audio, dramatic storytelling of the books.
B000002S4V|5.0|If your looking for a &quot;Hammerklavier&quot; to add to your library, you can't go wrong with this one.  This release won Gramophone Magazine's award for remastering of historical material and justly so.  I've listened to this one again and again over the past few years and I never grow tired of it. An excellent buy.
0671578855|5.0|Perhaps the title should have been \\"Civil Campaigns,\\" becasuse there are more than one.  Miles and Mark are each engaged in a civil campaign.  The course of love does not run smooth for either.  Miles is the target of blackmail by a Vor lord who wants to be confirmed as a Count, and Miles' love quest is unintentionally sabotaged by one of his friends.  The would-be Count learns that Miles' response to attempted blackmail is not quite what he had anticipated, he attempts revenge with surprising, delightful, and hilarious results.    You will enjoy this book more if you have already read the other Vorkosigan books.  Start with [[ASIN:0671578286 Cordelia's Honor]] if you can, and read the rest in order.  Every one is a delight.  And, speaking of Honor, check out the Honor Harrington books by David Weber, beginning with [[ASIN:1416509372 On Basilisk Station (Honor Harrington Book 1)]] also great fun to read.    watziznaym@gmail.com
6304510861|4.0|Some people say this movie is just Lynch playing with the audience.  Other people say you shouldn't try to find meaning, but just sit back and enjoy it aesthetically.  Still others say that in fact it makes perfect logical sense if you just try hard enough.<br /><br />THEY'RE ALL WRONG!<br /><br />There is definitely enough cohesiveness of detail in this movie to rule out the possibility of it being either gibberish (the bad way of looking at it) or non-logical dream-like atmospherism (the good way of looking at it).  On the other hand, it doesn't /quite/ hold together in the way that, say, _12 Monkeys_ did in terms of plot elements fitting together to form a perfect structure.  In fact, it's somewhere in between--and there is no &quot;correct&quot; interpretation.  Is the movie about psychotic fugue, Faustian bargaining, or just plain insanity?  There's no way to know--Lynch doesn't give us enough clues.  However, the movie does hang together in a bizarre, intuitive way--much like _The Wind Up Bird Chronicle_ by Haruki Murakami, or The Firesign Theatre's _Don't Crush That Dwarf, Hand Me The Pliers_.<br /><br />My advice is, don't read the other reviews if you haven't seen it (they give too much away), but watch it twice.  The first time, you'll be confused.  Watch it again, keeping in mind that /the two transformations are simultaneous/.  Now watch it all cohere--until the ending...
0679879269|5.0|This book is better than the Golden Compass and the Subtle Knife because the writing is a step above. Pullman is a fantastic writer, and I think he ranks among the best storytellers in literature today -- regardless of genre. Some younger children might be a little put off by the relatively complicated and difficult style; I'm not sure why this trilogy is still classified as 'young adult.' <br /> I didn't realize until I read this book that the His Dark Materials trilogy is essentially a sequel to Paradise Lost. Really fascinating stuff -- Milton was inspired to write Paradise Lost by an enigmatic passage of the bible... some early part of Genesis. Adam and Eve eat from the tree of knowledge and god says, &quot;You know good and evil, now you are one of us.&quot; Milton thought &quot;what does he mean by 'us?'&quot; and wrote an epic poem about how angels had a fight with god before creation and god banished some of the angels from heaven. By 'us' he meant the angels he had banished. Starting to see the similarities? Now Lyra being Eve starts to make sense, huh? <br /> Anyway, buy this book. It's well worth the money.<br />P.S. The passage around page 30 involving Metatron is really incredible writing... he manages to give a sense of urgency and immediateness without resorting to tired fantasy cliches.
0790729989|5.0|Director David Fincher's dark, stylish thriller easily ranks as one of the decade's most frightening and suspenseful films. Set in a hellish vision of New York, where it is always raining and the air crackles with impending death, the film concerns Det. William Somerset (Morgan Freeman), a homicide specialist just one week from a well-deserved retirement. Every minute of his 32 years on the job is evident in Somerset's worn, exhausted face, and his soul aches with the pain which can only come from having seen and felt far too much. But Somerset's retirement must wait for one last case, for which he is teamed with young hotshot David Mills (Brad Pitt), the fiery detective set to replace him at the end of the week. Mills has talked his reluctant wife Tracy (Gwyneth Paltrow) into moving into the big city so that he could tackle important cases, but his first and Somerset's last are more than either man has bargained for. A diabolical serial killer is staging grisly murders, choosing victims representing the seven deadly sins. First, an obese man is forced to eat until his stomach ruptures to represent Gluttony, then a wealthy defense lawyer is made to cut off a pound of his own flesh as penance for Greed. Somerset initially refuses to take the case, realizing that there will be five more murders, ghastly sermons about Lust, Sloth, Pride, Wrath, and Envy presented by a madman to a sinful world. Somerset is correct, and something within him cannot let the case go, forcing the weary detective to team with Mills and see the case to its almost unspeakably horrible conclusion. Fincher's deadly serious film benefits from wonderfully moody photography by Darius Khondji and a tension-filled script by Andrew Kevin Walker. The nauseatingly vivid special effects (particularly the remarkable Sloth murder) are among the most effective ever done by makeup artist Rob Bottin, best known for more fantasy-oriented work in films like The Howling (1981). Seven, however, really belongs to Morgan Freeman, who turns in the best performance of his career as Somerset, whose every word and expression gives credence to the theory that once a man looks into the abyss for too long, it starts to look back at him. R. Lee Ermey, Richard Roundtree, and Kevin Spacey co-star in this haunting, atmospheric masterpiece.
0375501851|3.0|This book was a disappointment perhaps because it received such great reviews; had I discovered it by accident I would probably have enjoyed it more.  The mix of characters are interesting but it took a great many pages to get the plot together and I was still waiting when I turned the last page.  If the author had focused less on the writing of a good book and more on the telling of a good story it might have made all the difference.

B00001NFCY|4.0|-Creed: once a dark and hard, MINITURE metal band (miniture cause they wheren't really a metal band, just something very simlar). That rocked big time with their Pearl Jam like music and sounds. And then came the higher cd single w/z the video. sold out (after the video that is). countines making new album. and then Creed has lost themselve. <br />-the album: less harder than MOP but a few mini metal songs and the lyrics all could of been better. But still has some good song like higher and arms wide open. well its hard to say how Creed lost their ways of music and what they loss that made them rock. all the song are similar (except higher and arms w open)and the lyrics are too simple, and they lost their creativity. <br />above all if you want the album for the 2 hit song (higher and arms w open) go get this album. if you like MO Prison; might wanna skip this one unless you like the 2 hit songs go get this. I gave the album a 4 star cause arms w open is such a great song.
B000002GYI|5.0|I usually steer clear of \\"avant garde\\" or \\"cutting edge\\" anything, as all too often these are just sophisticated code-words for \\"fad\\". More often than not, supposedly trailblazing new works end up being embarrassing dead ends, with little intrisic worth, and little insight into the future.<br />Not the case with Kraftwerk. They were visionaries of the first order. On \\"Computer World\\" they seem to be describing the world we live in today, yet the album came out in 1981! I remember when I first heard the album that year; I was 8 yrs. old, and visiting a friend. We were going through his elder brother's record collection. Two of the albums really scared me: Pink Floyd's \\"The Wall\\" (1979), and Kraftwerk's \\"Computer World.\\" When I was in High School, I claimed \\"The Wall\\" as my own; as an angst-ridden teen it spoke to me. But it took me until now--at 27!--to fully appreciate the genius of \\"Computer World\\". That's how ahead of their time Krafwerk were. In hindsight, \\"The Wall\\" was an artifact of the 70's, mired in cheap Freudianism and bombast, but \\"Computer World\\" sounds as fresh as ever.<br />But \\"Computer World\\" isn't just an important cultural milestone, it's an enduring, powerful artistic statement as well. Think of how easy it would have been for Kraftwerk to take a melodromatic \\"Run, run, the evil computers are going to take over the world!\\" stance. Instead, they convey a frighteningly accurate understanding of what the computer revolution will mean for mankind. The exhilaration is here (eg. on tracks \\"It's more fun to compute\\" and \\"Pocket calculator\\"), but also the loneliness and isolation (eg. \\"computer love\\"). In fact, each track describes a different facet of the new frontier: commerce, communication, global security, entertainment, emotional gratification (or lack thereof). Yet it's no dry screed; Kraftwerk, as always, are slyly tongue in cheek. The vocals of \\"Computer Love\\" are delivered with a tenderness not heard since \\"Trans-Europe Express\\" and \\"Radio Activity\\".<br />Lastly, the music. Here too, the album is a watershed. When people search for the roots of the electronica Renaissance, they often point to, say, Orbital's 1991 \\"Green Album.\\" Well, this album came out 10 years earlier, and it sounds arguably less dated! Not to mention the fact that Kraftwerk played a crucial role in the genesis of rap music as well. Listen and you're bound to hear melodies and drum patterns that have since been exploited by trance, IDM, heck, maybe even drum n' bass. All in all, an exceptional, groundbreaking, and emotionally touching album.<br />Incidentally, though I don't have a paranoid bone in my body, and conspiracy theories about how the moon landing never happened or how the illuminati control everything make me despair about mankind, it wouldn't surprise me if Kraftwerk built the first functional time machine. Aren't these songs just too prescient for mere coincidence? I mean, listen to the lyrics of \\"Home Computer\\": \\"I program my home computer/Beam myself into the future...\\" Maybe we should take this at face value...Fun to imagine, at any rate...<br />If you like this, you should also get \\"Man-Machine\\", \\"Radio-Activity\\", and \\"Autobahn\\".
B00004VW0W|4.0|&quot;Foreigner&quot; was the last of the original Cat Stevens albums that I purchased and after a 10 year wait I think it was worth it.  Although not as powerful as &quot;Teaser and the Firecat&quot; nor as seamless as &quot;Tea for the Tillerman&quot; I found it much more thought provoking than &quot;Buddah and the Chocolate Box&quot;, &quot;Catch Bull at Four&quot;, &quot;Izitso&quot; and &quot;Matthew and Son&quot;.  The Suite has one of the best blends of guitar and piano that I've heard from recordings from the 70s.  Even though Cat's pursuit of the truth is evident in the tracks it can still be enjoyed without pondering on each of the lyrics.  &quot;Foreigner Suite&quot; and &quot;The Hurt&quot; are reminiscent of the profound lyrics and smooth melancholic melodies that he used with songs such as &quot;Lady D'Arbanville&quot; and &quot;Wild World&quot;.  This is a must for any Cat Stevens fan and at the very least makes outstanding driving music.
0679879269|5.0|After waiting for for this book for two years, I was afraid it would be disappointing, but it turned out to be even better than its predecessors (The Golden Compass and The Subtle Knife). The ending was perfect - it makes perfect sense and feels entirely appropriate, but I would never have guessed it ahead of time.  I stayed up all night reading it the day it was released, and I've rarely been so engrossed.  I can't recommend this book more strongly, but presumably anyone who has read Pullman's earlier books doesn't need my recommendation.
B000001Y42|5.0|This CD is one of the best rock CD s of all time.It starts with an Intro that is quite different to the one on LB's Significant Other CD.The second track is a real hard and heavy track called Pollution which is one of the best songs on the CD.Then track 3 the first song that LB released and they paid for it to go on the radio,is the best track on the CD.Track 4 is another real heavy track.Tracks 5,6,7 and 8 are really good too but track 7 is quite mellow in some ways.Then comes the song that made LB famous...........the one and only Faith.This is an awesome song.It's better than Geogre Micheal's version.Then the rest of the CD is pretty heavy and phat.It's a real good buy.If you're a Bizkit fan and you don't have this there is something wrong with your head.Go out and get.I recommend this to any hard rock fan.
B00003CXGG|4.0|To All,<br />It's a must to watch movie for all love birds... I had a nice time.
B00004XONN|4.0|My experience with Radiohead really started with OKC.  I had heard &quot;Bones&quot; off The Bends and liked it so I bought OKC and it became one of my favorite CDs.  After buying OK Computer I also bought The Bends and enjoyed it as well.  I think the reviewer who said Kid A followed in the footsteps of Blur's 13 was only partially correct.  I thought 13 was highly influenced by Ok computer, so who's influencing who?<br />Back to Kid A.  It does sound a little unfinished, especially in the title track.  The song finally seems to come together in the last 30 seconds and then it's over.  However, once it's done, you realize that all those parts that had come together were there throughout the whole song, just floating under the surface.  &quot;How to Disappear Completely&quot; is definitely my favorite track.  Would it stick out as much if it was on OK Computer?  No, because Kid A has a &quot;less is more&quot; philosophy to it.<br />It's not poppy, and it's not mainstream radio-friendly, those things have been covered in other reviews.  In spots it's hard to actually call it rock.  For such a minimalist record, there's still a lot here to break down if you look for it.  OK Computer was three years ago, I've changed a lot since then, and so has Radiohead.

6305910103|4.0|&quot;The Wrath of Khan&quot; begins an important set of events in the entire Star Trek saga as well as being the basis of an exciting trilogy.  &quot;Khan&quot; is more of a sequel to the &quot;Space Seed&quot; episode than to the first Star Trek film.  The events that happen in this installment are actually just run of the mill Star Trek fare.  What's special about it is the way the characters are presented.<br />Kirk, Spock and company are years older than they were on the series and they are well into middle age.  With this graduation they are presented with much more wisdom than before, even Kirk.  The characters in this installment haven't been given such noble traits since the &quot;City on the Edge of Forever&quot; episode in 1967.  There is greater sense of danger than ever before for these characters and it is a decision that one of them makes which will take the film series into an exciting direction.  This is where Star Trek got good!
B00000JCOV|5.0|This CD will blow you away. When I listened to it the first time, I didn't get much interested in songs other than Sic and Me Inside.

6303201954|3.0|&quot;Star Trek: The Motion Picture&quot; is a visual feast.  The film is filled with stunning space imagery and futuristic settings, but it is not &quot;Star Trek&quot;.  This first &quot;Star Trek&quot; film suffers from lack of character.  The story is good but it lacks the sense of danger and humor that the series excelled at.  It's still a worthy Trek entry it just feels a little flat.  The film series gets better from here.

0385334206|5.0|Of all the writers of this crazy age Vonnegut stands alone for the North Americans, in my opinion.  There's just so much inside this novel that any attempt at deconstruction would only be futile.  Vonnegut looks like Einstein's crazy long-lost brother and his novels are like some insane Schrodinger wave equation that finds a different place to collapse depending on the reader's state of mind.<br />What you take from this trip depends on what's inside your head; I always find reading this leaves me feeling like the world has tilted slightly.  Vonnegut could almost be a reincarnated Zen master weaving modern koans for the disillusioned age.
6304712936|5.0|This is a great movie, but what impressed me is the quality of the Dolby 3.2 soundtrack. It is absolutely the best demonstration and test of what is great about home theater sound versus stereo. If you love classical music, this soundtrack will absolutely send you into ectasy.

B000000WJZ|5.0|This CD defined alternate rock for me.  From the crashing sound of 'Cherub Rock', this puppy rocks and doesn't let up.  One GREAT twist is that some of the songs meander into psychedelia, and the gut-wrenching honesty of 'Disarm' is enough to make anyone take notice of this band.  Mind you, I was not crazy about Billy Corgan's voice when I first heard it, but it grew on me...and I have been a big fan since.  Other tracks like 'Today' and 'Rocket' are classic SP, as well as the comfy fit of the slide and grunge of 'Bummer'.<br />Corgan himself admits that he wanted this band to transcend the rather ordinary rock of his youth (Cheap Trick, Boston, etc), and he took this band that step further...he took the elements that made up 'good music', and added a twist that is uniquely the Smashing Pumpkins.  This is not the utterly 'down' music that dominates the airwaves today (Korn, Static-X), but is a powerfully introspective work (both lyrically and sonically).<br />If you don't have this one in your CD Tower or whatever, get it and you won't be disappointed!  This is in my Top 10 CD's of the 90's list (others include RATM's debut, Nirvana-Nevermind, etc)
B00000FYIL|5.0|This is my favorite romantic movie, and the soundtrack delivers beautiful, soul-stirring classical music, taken from Stephen Warbeck's score. I love to listen to this album when relaxing and studying (or having a candlelit dinner). ;) If you are a classical music fan, or if you just want to relive the beauty of the motion picture &quot;Shakespeare in Love&quot;, pop this CD into your player and get ready for your heart to be captured once again.
B000002OX7|5.0|Rounding 30 years on, one can still listen to this classic and found out where the rock *power* that was insurged into so many budding rock and rollers to come later on came from...<br />I am NOT stuck in 'classic rock' mode like so many, as I am into ALL sorts of music (alt, punk, new age, etc) - however, this album (when I got it way back when) was a wake up call to what rock and roll was to be...the power of &quot;Won't get fooled again&quot; still rings true today, and some of today's rockers to me are still trying to attain the pure energy, anger and power that went into so many of these tracks - except that today's volume and production are covering up a lame attempt.  Baba O'Reilly, Love ain't for keepin, My Wife, Behind Blue Eyes - I mean, what a range of power and passion!  This stuff still blows me away today.<br />This remaster includes some great bonus stuff that is well worth the price of admission - made me toss my 'first' copy of the CD just to get the improved sound of this classic.<br />Overall, one of the BEST rock albums ever - if you don't have it, you are missing out on music history.
6304698526|4.0|Steve Mcqueen hit the bullseye with this movie. A character that he was seemingly born to play, a tough withdrawn,taciturn cop. The plot stems from a witness protection job gone awry. Nothing from then is as it seems. Robert Vaughn playing a slick oily politician is brilliant,the doctors and ancillary cops are actually doctors and cops[what a concept!],so they lend a feel of authenticity. The car chase, driven by the actors through the streets of san francisco is classic, and unfortunately spanwned a generation of lame imitators. A good buy, an excellent police procedural and Mcqueen at his best.
B000002IJO|5.0|&quot;DANCING UNDERCOVER&quot; is the best COMPLETE Ratt album and probably the most underated of all, the only one that gets 5 STARS as far as I'm concerned. The record continues in the same vein as their previous release, &quot;INVASION OF YOUR PRIVACY&quot;, but the riffs are edgier and more creative. Every song is a winner here. Demartini's solos are explosive and very innovative. Great musical performance from all members. CAUTION: No commercialism here! This is heavier than some of their more &quot;radio-friendly&quot; albums (&quot;REACH FOR THE SKY&quot;, &quot;DETONATOR&quot;), so if you really want to hear the raw energy that is Ratt - this is the one to buy.
B000003BF1|5.0|If you are to understand the Rolling Stones, and more importanly, the history of Rock &amp; Roll, then Let it Bleed needs to be in your music library.  No question about it.  Every song on this album is simply incredible.  I cannot imagine going a week without listening to this record at least once.  I say this, because when I listen to it, I usually play it several times consecutively.  Much more than just classic rock, much more than part of the histroy of rock,  Let it Bleed teaches the listener about music.
0156907399|5.0|Many critics, teachers and readers consider To the Lighthouse to be Virginia Woolf's masterpiece.  To the Lighthouse was published in 1927 and its structure is unique, although it does contain elements of the Victorian.  Woolf wrote this novel in only one year and did very little rewriting.  Both subtle and sharp, the ease with which the book was written is apparent in the flow of both its narrative and its prose.  The novel was written during one of the brief peaceful and happy times in Woolf's life.  (In 1895, after her mother's death, Woolf became almost continuously depressed and suffered a series of nervous breakdowns, culminating in her suicide by drowning in 1941.)<br />To the Lighthouse, like Woolf's previous novel, Jacob's Room, is a somewhat disjointed story, possessing numerous characters, points-of-view and conflicts.  The overlapping and separation of the characters and their stories seems to result from both intention and oversight and is a product of what Woolf referred to as &quot;all characters boiled down,&quot; and the &quot;break of unity in my design.&quot;<br />The story centers around the summer vacation to the Isle of Skye of the Ramsey family, a family Woolf admitted was very much like her own.  In fact, Woolf said that writing To the Lighthouse helped her &quot;rub out&quot; the obsessive memory of her own mother.  Mrs. Ramsey, like Woolf's own mother, is a woman of decidedly Victorian ideals, choosing to focus on her home, her marriage and her family.<br />Interacting with Mrs. Ramsey is the character most representative of Woolf, herself, Lily Briscoe, a young girl who is staying in the same beachouse as the Ramseys.  Unmarried, Lily draws both disapproval and sympathy from Mrs. Ramsey who firmly believes that &quot;an unmarried woman has missed the best of life.&quot;<br />Mrs. Ramsey and Lily represent the conflict between the Victorian and the Edwardian eras, the age of the woman in the home and the advent of the woman in the workplace.  An intelligent young woman, as well as a sensitive and talented artist, Lily is very aware of Mrs. Ramsey's disapproval.<br />The role of art in the novel deals primarily with Post-Impressionism and the attempt to freeze reality, not on paper or on canvas, but in the mind, and then to paint the very equivalent of this reality.  In many ways, To the Lighthouse resembles a painting because of its three distinct images of reality:  the summer, the return and the seven years in between.<br />Woolf was not the only writer to &quot;paint&quot; her novels.  In Place in Fiction, Eudora Welty writes of &quot;painting and writing, always the closest two of the 'sister arts.'&quot;  Throughout the novel, Lily works on one painting and cannot seem to &quot;connect the mass on the right hand with that on the left...But the danger was that by doing that the unity of the whole might be broken.&quot;  The need for connection in the painting is much like the need for connection in the narrative.  And Lily and Mrs. Ramsey both serve to fulfill the role as unifier.<br />One of the most startling moments of unification occurs as Mrs. Ramsey is staring at a bowl of fruit she has placed in the middle of the table during a dinner party.  Because of her extreme attention to detail, Mrs. Ramsey focuses on the bowl throughout the dinner.  She particularly notices the perfection of the arrangement while also fearing its imminent destruction as she catches another guest looking at the fruit, no doubt desirous of it.  Mrs. Ramsey thinks, &quot;That was his way of looking, different from her.  But looking together united them.&quot;<br />Even when not physically present in the story, Mrs. Ramsey continues to exert a strong influence.  At the end of the novel, Mr. Ramsey finally takes his two youngest children, James and Cam, to the lighthouse.  Both children have changed considerably from the time of their first vacation; Mrs. Ramsey's absence has required that they develop a new independence, yet she was their only tie to their father, the typically restrained and uninvolved Victorian husband.<br />The children must, however, incorporate the influence of both of their parents on their journey to the lighthouse, a journey that is both literal and figurative.  From shore, Lily watches them as she paints their journey, recalling Mrs. Ramsey with both annoyance and love.  Lily, like Woolf, herself, has finally come to terms with the connection of all things, the completion of a painting as well as the completion of a journey.<br />To the Lighthouse is a quiet, reflective and meditative novel and one of the first to display Woolf's unique Impressionistic stream-of-consciousness style.
B000002U82|5.0|It was Dark Side of the Moon that most people 35 and younger heard for the first time.  I am 31 and I remember seeing commercials for &quot;The Wall&quot; with Bob Geldoff, but it was really Dark side of the Moon that made me a rabid Floyd fan.  I have all of their studio recordings, and some bootleg from when I lived in Germany, but it's Dark Side of the Moon that has never been out of my reach.<br />Put aside the Wizard of Oz thing, put away all of the lsd or marijuana hype, the album is solid without any of those things.  It's logged more weeks on the top 200 for some very good reasons. <br />Most likely you are just reading the reviews to see who the nut is that might have given this album less than 5 stars, but if you haven't bought this particular selection of music, do not delay.  buy it, put it on, and just sit back.
0312243022|5.0|Michael Cunningham's novel, The Hours, is a tribute to Virginia Woolf but it is a treasure chest of rare gems in its own right.<br />The book is the story of one day in the lives of three extraordinarily remarkable women living in three different periods in history.  In the first story, Cunningham takes a quasi-fictional look at the last day of Virginia Woolf's life.  His description of Woolf's final thoughts as she descends into the deep water of the river are terrifically poignant and moving.  Even those who are not fans of Woolf would be hard-pressed to come away from this without tears in their eyes.<br />The second story belongs to Clarissa Vaughan, nicknamed &quot;Mrs. Dalloway,&quot; a Bohemian-style book editor living in present-day Greenwich Village.  A woman concerned with aging, Clarissa still values individual moments, people, memories.  Clarissa is busy with preparations for a party she is hosting for her former lover, an award-winning poet now dying of AIDS, a man modeled after Woolf's Septimus Warren Smith who battled demons of his own.  The preparations for the party are more than reminiscent of Woolf's own heroine, Clarissa Dalloway.<br />The third story is set in post-World War II California and concerns itself with the life of Laura Brown.  Laura is a housewife living what amounts to an extremely claustrophobic life.  She feels closed in, shut out and intellectually impotent with regard to her mundane household chores.  Laura Brown desperately needs a &quot;room of her own.&quot;  She tries to carve out just enough hours in the day to read Woolf's &quot;Mrs. Dalloway,&quot; and she considers Woolf's own suicide a viable option of her own for escaping a life that has become unlivable, not through horror but through simple lack of meaning.  <br />Laura's story is, perhaps, the most difficult because it is the one that most parallels Woolf's own life.  A brilliant woman, Virginia Woolf had the misfortune to live during a time where woman were seen and slept with but whose opinions were valued little.  Cunningham adroitly gives us a look at, what must have been Woolf's own quiet desperation through Laura's eyes as she realizes that, no matter how intelligent is, no matter how much she has to contribute intellectually, no matter how many brilliant and original thoughts she has, ultimately, she will be judged only by the sheen on her kitchen floor and the flakiness of her pie crusts.<br />Although not long, The Hours is a book that demands the reader's undivided attention.  It takes time and effort to mine all of its treasures, many of which lie far below the surface.  The magic that ties these three disparate stories together is Cunningham's amazing prose.  Although there are three stories going on at the same time, none ever feels jarring, interrupted or intrusive.  Each jump in time, is, in fact, bittersweet.  We hate to leave Clarissa and yet, at the same time, we can't wait to return to Laura.  And Cunningham's careful attention to detail definitely shows his familiarity with Woolf.  Many passages in the book are so brilliantly written they almost sing.<br />The Hours is a book that dazzles, not with melodrama, but with those individual and ordinary moments that flicker in our memories and then replay themselves again and again, against all odds and expectations.
B000002U8G|5.0|I consider Meddle to be the last of the early Pink Floyd albums. Piper, Saucerful, Ummagumma, and Atom Heart Mother all preceed Meddle, but for my money, Meddle completes this era of music making.  With Meddle, I get a sense of fun that Dark side of the Moon has obviously abandoned.  Meddle begins with what is arguably some of the best guitar work ever produced to that time in rock and roll, and end with Echoes (originally titled Return of the Son of Nothing) that takes the listener on a sea voyage reminiscent of The Rhyme of the Ancient Mariner.<br />Roger Waters said that he felt too much pressure to compromise by having one side of the album consist of marketable shorter recordings, but there is no doubt that his idea of compromise is decidedly still infused with genius.  Every song on this album is a work of art and even though the style of songs vary widely, the mix works well.  For anyone who is interested in early Pink Floyd, this is a great place to start.
B00003CXGG|5.0|If there is one word in which the story line, actions and performance given by the actors in this piece can de expressed - It is - perfection! A must see for all movie lovers!
B000002LGA|4.0|For anyone who is wondering why there is so much hype surrounding Lou Reed and his relationship with music, turn to New York, released in early 1989.  The album consists of 14 songs meant to be listened to at once and in order, and what songs they are.  After listening to these songs, you will know that the social conscience of Rock music was not lost, only burried beneath the glam of the 1980's.  And even with the social issues that Lou brings up in every one of his songs, I never felt as if Lou Reed was preaching to me.  Lou Reed is one of those rare song writiers who are capable of sending a message, and being 100% sincere about the whole thing.<br />Lou Reed spins some really good tales on New York, and the best part is, it is live rock and roll.  Two guitars, bass, and drums.  The album as an album works, but if you are looking for stand-out songs, chech the title track, Dirty Blvd, and Last Great American Whale.
B000000NN4|5.0|My first exposure to Vangelis was in 1978 when my mother brought this album home from vacation in Los Angeles.  I was an 11-year-old still entranced by the Star Wars craze and I found the album utterly fascinating.  It was avant garde compared to the mainstream music of the time, but that's what made it more compelling.  I love the dynamic blend of electronic harmonies, such as those found in Pulstar and Alpha.  Mare Tranquillitatis makes you feel like you're on the Moon, with actual excerpts of some Apollo transmissions in the background.  The lullaby-like melodies of Sword Of Orion put one in a trance.  The title track, Albedo 0.39, is planetarium music.  In the background, a man states facts about the Earth, such as maximum distance from the Sun and length of the tropical year. . . interesting.  By the way, Albedo is the ratio of reflectivity, the percentage of light and radiation that strikes a planetary body that is reflected back.  Earth's is 0.39 or 39%
B00004XONN|5.0|Unlike the experience of most people, Kid A was the first Radiohead CD  for me.  I totally flipped out when I heard it--I think it's haunting, beautiful, innovative, futuristic, and yes, brilliant at times.  Hypnotic from the opening notes on the first track, the listener  is contantly being held in suspension, waiting for one beatiful resolution after another.   Tracks 6-9 totally rock my world.  Anyhow, upon purchasing their other stuff (OK Computer and the Bends), i now see what all the fuss is about.     Yeah, so the new one is on a completely different level than the others.  Some like it, some hate it.   Their past CD's are great, too--but it's like a &quot;been there, done that&quot; kind of thing.        The point is, they had the talent, creativity, and guts to put this new stuff out there.  I'm thrilled that they did.
B00000IPAX|1.0|Blink had something going on in the punk scene for a while  but this album just totally proves they are huge sell outs.  Its nothing close to punk its teeny bopper stuff.  there old cds are better like chesire cat.  Enema was made just to sell and it shows with its corny songs. If you are in the mood to listen to punk this is not the cd for you.<br />Less Than Jake kicks ass
B000007OY0|5.0|To be honest, sometimes it seems odd that so much people write similar things about this magnificient film, but then again, everybody ,including myself ,wish to express and convey his thoughts and emotions in his/her special unique way.<br />  Hence, I decided to take my time to write a few words . I hope you'll like them (The immediate reason for this is that I'm currently reading the novel,four years after seeing the movie for the first time).<br />  Andy Dufresne. The name evokes nobel feelings in me whenever I hear it.Portrayed so wonderfully by Tim Robbins,it represents so much ; A man who had had everything,lost everthing and,finally, gained everything back.<br />  His character is one of the most inspiring I've ever known. What a man ! An example of the strength of the human spirit, and one basic rule : diligence and patience with a little bit of luck and wisdom can get you anywhere . . . Even outside the walls of Shawshank state penitentiary...<br />  If you've seen it once - see it again ! It never loses it's impact. Watch it whenever you're down and feeling like everything is going wrong .I bet it shall lift your spirit just a little bit higher ,and help you through the crisis .
B000005GX7|5.0|This album is fantastic, but there's another trio set with Joe Henderson that captures him in even greater form: The one called &quot;An Evening With Joe Henderson, Charlie Haden, Al Foster&quot; on Red Records from 1987. That's the TRUE state of the tenor!

B00003CXGG|3.0|&quot;Romeo Must Die&quot; is a movie with lots of martial arts. Nice Movie as a whole.
B00004Z511|3.0|I like it, and I am waiting for the follow up because it feels like this album is about fifteen minutes long.
B00004XQP4|5.0|I think the album rocks, all the songs on it are great. THe best ones would be Waiting and Macy's Day Parade. I think it'S their second best album (after Kerplunk). Although I have no problem with the musical style of this album, i would have been even happier with an album like Kerplunk, or something.
0312853238|5.0|\\"Ender's Game\\" was written by Orson Scott card. The basic story is of a young boy, Andrew Wiggin, who is recruited of to battle school where his limits are tested to the max.  He lived in fear of his brother and the people at school, but all that changed with that one decision. He is torn from his family and most of all Valentine, the only one who loves him. Andrew was chosen for his genius ness, only being the age of six he sees things that normal people wouldn't pick up on.  He solves problems one time and he does them thorough enough that they are solved for good, such as the Stilson incident. Andrew, who is nicknamed Ender, goes up through the school and has his own army before he is ten. He masters the games and wars that are held at the school. He ranks at the top of the charts. He is then transferred to Command school. Where he under goes intense training, with the hero of the Bugger wars. and I will not give too much away. Card did a excellent job with this book, he portrayed  all the human qualities in this book. In Ender's eyes the world authorities are the enemies, and himself is the only on who understands it.  The book itself is some what science fiction, with the alien species and such.  However the book is more concentrated on Ender and his emotions than the Buggers. It was great and I would change nothing about it.  This book is a must read for any reader.
B00004XONN|3.0|The music on &quot;Kid A&quot; seems to echo the art work found on the sleeve. A collage of different elements glued and taped together. Radiohead seem to be reaching here for something new as any &quot;true artist&quot; does, not worrying about reviews and pleasing the general public, but taking risks. For this reason &quot;Kid A&quot; isn't as immediately pleasing as previous efforts. It may take time for it to grow on me but for now it seems like transitional effort. They are not gods nor rock saviours, just artists following their hearts, hopefully.
0899663036|5.0|I first read this book almost 40 years ago when I found it in my parent's bookcase.  I was in grammar school at the time and my mother thought I wasn't old enough to read it so she hid it from me.  It didn't take me very long to discover her hiding place and I read as much as I could each Saturday when she went to do her shopping.  Even as I child, I was moved by the story of Francie's coming of age in a city and economic situation that were completely foreign to mine.  Betty Smith's writing transported me into Francie's life.  I loved the book then and still have the copy that belonged to my mother.  Over the years, I have forgotten the details of the story, but have remembered the feelings that the book inspired in me and how I felt connected in some way to Francie.  I have just recently come across my old worn copy and am currently reading it again.  The feelings still ring true, but to read it now as an adult, I am finding a depth to the novel that I missed reading it as a child.  I thoroughly recommend this book.
B00003CX8J|5.0|I think that Bryan Singer's adaptation of the Marvel Comics title is the best, most true to form comic book film. While Tim Burton's Batman Returns is the best film of the comic book adaptations, X-Men feels the most like a true representation of the paper format. Rather than campy fun (a la Superman) or even complete misfire (Punisher, Captain America etc.), X-Men nails the comic book world with its representation of what the world might be like if it really had superheroes in it. <br />The best example of this is Alex Ross's Kingdome Come series, but that will never make it to the big screen. If you want a taste of comic book fun, as well as bare bones action and serious storytelling, check out X-Men.
0679879269|5.0|I've enjoyed this series immensely.  When I first read &quot;The Golden Compass&quot; I was struck by the fact that this was a story told unlike many I had read before.  &quot;The Subtle Knife&quot; continued this.  This is a remaking of Paradise Lost and it is wonderful.  I enjoyed the fact that our heroes do not get everything they want in the end.  I felt the pain that was there, the loss.  This story was ended perfectly.<br />There were some parts that could have been fixed better.  While I enjoyed the whole sequence with Mary Malone and the muelfa, what point did it really serve?  Also, Mrs. Coulter, the villianess from the previous few books, am I to believe such a change of heart.  There was nothing to gain from her actions here.  No advantage except what she was doing for love.  A change that was a bit disappointing.<br />But I digress.  Buy this book.  Read it to your children.  Answer their questions.  Read it for yourself.  This is storytelling at its finest.
B00003CXE7|5.0|Much has been made of the scale of the picture and of Russell Crowe's towering star turn. The kudos are well deserved. It's Ridley Scott's best film, as well as Crowe's most impressive performance.<br />But what really sold the film for me was the star-making turn by Joaquin Phoenix, River's little brother. Taking what could have easily been a one-note, one-dimensional &quot;villain&quot;, Phoenix absorbs the emperor in true pathos and mortality. His performance gives the film its emotional core, even though many would argue that that feat goes to Crowe. I believe that Scott's film is just as much about the emperor as it is the Gladiator.<br />Props to an excellent production crew. Gladiator is, like Saving Private Ryan, a wonderfully renderred historical epic.
B000002G1Y|5.0|&quot;Perfectly Good Guitar,&quot; released in 1993, finds John Hiatt flexing his rock 'n' roll muscles.  He can still find a balance with slower, folkier, or bluesy numbers--which are also perfect vehicles for his throaty, nasal vocals--but it's the stomping, harder offerings that really stand out.  <br />The opening track, &quot;Something Wild&quot; gets the album off to an explosive start, complete with Hiatt's cougar-like howls and snarls and his syncopated rhythm guitar.  The title track is equally powerful and raw, with an ominous chord progression that reflects the singer's anger toward other artists who disrespect or mistreat his favorite sacred instrument.<br />&quot;Buffalo River Home&quot; is one of those in-between songs that manages to be both rocking and folky at the same time.  &quot;Angel&quot; is terrific, but &quot;Cross My Fingers&quot; might be the album's high point.  The song manages to be haunting in spite of its breakneck pace.  &quot;Permanent Hurt&quot; is also toe-tapping and catchy, proving Hiatt hasn't lost his knack for insightfulness and wit.<br />As far as the ballads go, &quot;Blue Telescope&quot; is quite memorable, and perfectly placed among the faster numbers.<br />An all-around solid album, and a must for any John Hiatt aficionado.  If you've never owned a Hiatt disc, give the guy a chance.  His clever lyrics and distinctive melodies will surely pull you in.
B00003CXGG|4.0|with the come back of superstar Jet Li in yet another action packed movie which depicts a very traditional chinese family and its conflicts to a black business family . The war between these family's is mainly due to the control of the dockyard which is owened half by the blacks and half by the chinese . We can also see a emotional backing to it where Jet Li proves his love to his brother by finding his kileer's. So very much worth seeing movie
0790749998|3.0|i thought the movie was pathetic,there was no story line,the story deviated from it's main plot many times.the action scenes were not directed well.
0684853523|5.0|A fabulous book!  Not only are the personal anecdotes inspiring, but the instructional portion of the book is scintillating.  Not that there is all that much that is new, mind you.  But let's face it, there is a difference between reading an article in Writer's Digest from someone who has written two novels in the genre you are exploring, and reading the same advice from the bestselling author in the history of mankind.  I've read all the advice from the others.  It carries more weight coming from Stephen King.  And for that, in itself, I thank Mr. King.  That he took the time and gave a hoot about what bestselling wannabes care about shows that he belongs in the pantheon of great writers.  His unselfishness and candor gives all us hopefuls a glimpse into what it's all about.  This book is a winner, for all other winners to enjoy!
B00003CXGG|4.0|I'll say a good Time -Pass movie to watch but the idea behind the movie was not very convincing..
B000001ED1|5.0|after hearing osborne on jay leno, I knew I had to get more than just &quot;Safety in Numbers&quot;. Upon release of &quot;Righteous Love&quot; it was on my disc player. Hearing her on the computer at work , a co-worker asked,&quot;Janis??&quot;.  Curious about &quot;One of Us&quot;, I snatched &quot;Relish&quot;. Grrrrreat instrument work and Osborne's wide variance voice is utilized more on &quot;Relish&quot;. Can't wait to take it to &quot;work&quot; for the responses!!!!! Me and the dogs are dancin'at midnight. These songs are much bolder and more raw blues, rockin'and movin'. Just like you like it. &quot;Just lets' get......&quot;cut#9. Just ordered the Earlier Recordings.
0811826848|5.0|OK.  Now that the Beatles are out of the way, when can we get a similar, excellent chronicle of the Stones?  &quot;The Rolling Stones:  A Life on the Road&quot; was great, but not nearly enough new stuff, and virtually nothing for Stones fans already in the know.  We Stones fans need something like &quot;Anthology&quot;.  Leave it to the Beatles to get their first, though.  As usual.....

0783240503|5.0|We first rented just to see it, when we returned it we went out and bought the movie, we just couldn't do without it. We first saw it five days ago and already we know most of the songs. I really love the Narrator she is one of the best characters in the movie. Also, I thought Elvis is really funny, but I think my favorite part of the movie is the 70s' song. Donny Osmand as 'Joseph' was a really good idea, he is so good looking you just like the movie as soon as he appears singing &quot;I closed my eyes&quot;. I just LOVE that movie.
0679879269|5.0|The only books better than this are the other in it's series... I'm not even sure of that... This is a great book, you have got to read it!
B00003CXDU|5.0|I purchased a copy for our kids, hoping it wouldn't be too silly, or politically correct.  Granted, I don't expect much from the cultural morass that eminates from Hollywood, but &quot;Galaxy Quest&quot; is a gem.  My favorable opinion may be influenced by long familiarity with the movie's alter ego &quot;Star Trek&quot; (and its conventions), on which GQ is obviously based -- although don't tell Paramount's executives that.  You don't have to be a Trekkie to enjoy it, but it doesn't hurt.  (However, the cute drydock departure is designed to appeal to those who remember ST-TMP.)  The technobabel, e.g., &quot;beryllium balls&quot; (in lieu of &quot;dilithium crystals&quot;), was delightful.  (It also gave me the excuse to pull out a periodical table for the kids.  I pointed out that the GQ crew should have washed their hands after retrieving the ball since that metal is toxic.)  Unlike so many sci-fi films in which a feeble or incoherent plot is plastered by gee-whiz optics (&quot;Lost in Space&quot; and the &quot;Jurassic Park&quot; movies come to mind), GQ has a nicely arranged theme (much like &quot;Back to the Future&quot;) in which, once disbelief is suspended on physical premises, the story proceeds without being disrupted by internal contradictions or leftist sermonizing.  GQ is humorous without being needlessly slapstick, and although (or maybe because) it's deliberately camp, the plot holds together quite nicely.  The acting is also very appropriate for the story.  The effects are credible, but don't overwhelm the characters or the story.  Real nice job.
B000001Y9I|5.0|Some rock bands go down hill;  however, UFO and DP just keep getting better and better.<br />I am a big DP fan and think it is criminal that I never heard a track from this recording ever prior to purchase.  The radio chooses to blow smoke on us.  I bought this in the cut out bin but would have gladly paid full price.  Isn't it criminal that Bon Jovi gets air play and new DP does not?<br />Abandon may be better, but for some reason whenever I play DP I end up playing Purpendicular.<br />Having Blackmore leave DP is a good thing as it frees him to record a Rainbow recording.  I'm still waiting for him to top Rainbow Rising.  I'm optimistic that 2000 may be the best decade for traditional hard rock.  We just need to let all the teeny boppers know that there are bands better than Bon Jovi and Creed.  Seriously, I do not know why mediocre metal sells when we have rock veterans like DP and UFO recording excellent albums.  Check out Mogg/Way's Chocolate Box if you doubt rock veterans abilities to rock circles around the Limp Biscuits of the world. <br />There is not a single bad track on this recording.  It has a gestalt and can be put in the player and placed on repeat.  The best DP since In Rock:)
0375420525|5.0|Possibly the most &quot;real&quot; book I've ever read; it's quite possibly one of the best offering in recent memory. If you like a genuinly unnerving story, this will be just your thing. I'm not attesting that you will have nightmares spawned by it but rather that you may very well lose sleep because you find it unable to put down. Even after you've pried it out of your hands, sleep may be difficult. You'll remember those unending black corridors without windows, those shifting walls... But, yes, I digress. Anyway, if you are a fan of horror, this is one of the best. The author's invention is quite striking and nice to see after so much mediocrity in modern horror fiction- this transcends the genre well. Check it out, add it to your bookshelf, and hope that the darkness doesn't-
B00004XONN|5.0|I will keep this short. This is the best album you will hear this year. Radiohead is bold, creative, talented and have now reached the status of bands like U2, REM, Pink Floyd. Their music inspires and will be heard for decades to come and they will be considered the best rock band of the year, hands down. &quot;Ladies and Gentlemen, the grammy goes to...&quot;
0783241399|5.0|The Hurricane in my thought is  the best movie of the decade. It shows what had really happend in life back when all the whites were racist.  All the hardships the whites put the blacks through. The whites cops always accusing the blacks for crimes. Always trying to take all the blacks down and get rid of them all. This movie relates to this subject in history. In this movie Rubin the &quot;Hurricane&quot; Carter, a boxer, is played by the great Denzel Washington. This part was really meant for Denzel, he played the part absolutly marvolous.In the movie Rubin was trying to be taking down for a crime that was commited by a white person. A white cop who has always hated Rubin blamed him for the murder and took him down. Then Rubin was sent to court and was sent to jail by a white judge. Given up on his hopes of getting out of jail, a black boy that had read his book that he wrote, came to help him with a couple of white people, which proved not all the whites were racist. During this time in history most whites were racist but a few tryed to help the blacks. Those were the smart people in that time. The blacks are no different than the whites. We are all the same.  Which it took a long time for the whites too figure out. There are still some whites now that are racist. To find out what happens to Rubin you'll need to watch this great movie. I encourage you to see this movie. I have seen tons of movies and &quot;The Hurricane&quot; was definetly my favorite of them all.
B00000AFGM|5.0|So what if this album wasn't as scary as Antichrist Superstar? Every song Manson has ever wrote, including this album, he pulls no punches and has no fear about telling the truth about society. That's why I like this album so much. The Speed Of Pain and The Last Day On Earth are excellent, as is this entire album.  A true masterpiece.
B000002GVO|5.0|This is the Eagles at their best.  Every song on Hotel California has substance in both lyrics and music, and because of this, the album has really stood the test of time.  There are obvious classics like the title track and &quot;Life in the Fast Lane&quot;, but lesser known songs like &quot;Wasted Time&quot;, &quot;The Last Resort&quot;, and &quot;Pretty Maids All in a Row&quot; are great tunes, too!  If you only own one studio album by the Eagles, this is the one to have.
B00004TL21|5.0|This is a great album, the songs are fluid and the beat keeps me going. All the songs on this c.d are great not just a few, like some albums that you really just want to toss. Everyon should this c.d it is different from the mainstream rock but its so much fun to listen to.
B000002MFQ|2.0|It looks like I'm in the minority here, but man -- what a disappointment!  If one-hit wonders really exist in the electronic music field, then Mike Oldfield is surely at the top of the list.<br />With Tubular Bells 2, I was hoping for some fresh new music but instead got boring rehashes of everything in the first Tubular Bells.  In this album, all the old themes in the first one are touched on again, in about the same order, and with largely the same chord progressions.  The melody lines are a bit different, but come on Mike!  This album is nothing but lazy.<br />Some real sore points with me:<br />*  The last minute of the first &quot;half&quot; of the album sounds all too much like that wretched &quot;My Heart Will Go On&quot; from &quot;Titanic.&quot;  If you don't believe me, listen again!  Sure this album predates the movie, but it's still yuck.<br />*  The song &quot;Altered State&quot; which is nothing but a butchered version of the &quot;Piltdown Man&quot; sequence from the original is positively the goofiest thing I have ever heard anywhere.  Mike has added all sorts of really terrible voiceovers throughout the song in an attempt to make it funny -- but it comes off like an episode of Pokemon.  I felt like having a seizure.<br />*  The addition of lots of choral lines throughout the music takes away from the &quot;electronic&quot; effect in a big, big way.  If I wanted gospel, I'd buy gospel!<br />This is the first CD I've bought in a long, long time that I felt like returning after listening to it.  But since Trevor Horn (Yes, The Buggles) has a Producer credit on it, I'll probably hang onto it for a little while.  Maybe it will sound better after a few glasses of wine.<br />Buyer beware!  If you're an electronic music enthusiast, you'd do well to avoid this one.
B00000J7JO|5.0|Ive known of the Peppers back in the day from &quot;Under the Bridge,&quot; &quot;Give It Away,&quot; and even &quot;Aeroplane.&quot;  Then finally, years later, they came out with this God of a CD Californication.  I have had this CD for over a year now and I still listen to it daily while I drive.  By the way, you're in for an earful treat if you have a Subwoofer and tweeters in your ride.  All the guitar, and bass picks, as well as the kicking drums sound so good.  The peppers have a unique way of making their music.  Californication isnt just full of fast, aggressive rock (although the ones on it are great, such as All Around the Wolrd and Easily) they have slow songs such as Porcelain where you kind of place yourself chillin' by the shore sippin' a Corona, listening to the waves.  Even the words to their songs are somewhat poetic for example &quot;The story of a woman in the morning of a war, remind me if you will exactly what were fighting for!&quot;  The only songs I disliked were Parallel Universe and Get on Top.  Other than that this CD is great even for non Pepper fans.  Dont be satisfied with just the singles played on radio!  There are songs just as good if not, better than Scar Tissue, Otherside, All Around the Wrold, and dare I say it... Californication.
0811826848|5.0|Oh my god!  The Beatles &quot;Anthology&quot; is manna from heaven!!  Jam-packed with recollections, photos, receipts, ads, etc.  Truly a gift from the gods that will keep Beatle fans happy and fascinated for years to come.  Thank you thank you thank you John Paul George and Ringo for opening up and letting us in -- Certainly, the BOOK of the YEAR ... and the most awesome Beatle book there will EVER be !!!!
B00004XONN|5.0|This one may take you a while to get into...unless you're a member of the Obessesed Radiohead Fans Association, like me. This album is simply put, beautiful. Kid A is the most original and intelligent thing to come out this year, so chock full of raw emotion , you might just cry like Thom did the first time he heard it all the way through. My personal favorites on the CD are &quot;Idioteque&quot;-the darkly twisted technoish dancey song (once you hear it you'll understand why it's so hard to explain...the songs almost disintegrate into sound...) and &quot;Motion Picture Soundtrack&quot;, which is gorgeously sad. Kid A is more of an emotional experience than an album. Buy it now, you need it.
0553106635|5.0|Australia receives the UK distribution so we are ahead of Uncle Sam.   As somebody else said in another review - it would be difficult for Mr Martin to go upwards from his first two volumes.   Difficult or not, he did.    This is fantastic stuff.  Characters who are neither perfectly good or totally bad, characters who change, characters who DIE (most unexpectedly).   You come up gasping for breath after a session of reading.    This is really good.    I don't know if I can wait the year until the next volume and I both hope and don't hope that he will stop at six.
B00000IAU3|4.0|I was in the record store in need of some soul-soothing music, and remembered seeing Dido on VH1.  I had only heard &quot;Here With Me&quot; and part of &quot;Thank You,&quot; and bought the disc based on those 2 songs.  I am very glad I did. It is fast becoming one of my favs.  Dido's soothing voice and dreamy melodies are just what I needed.
B00003CXHJ|3.0|Overall, I found U-571 enjoyable, especially the depth charging scene!  I actually felt a bit claustrophobic and trapped as the charges came closer and became louder!<br />There were definitely some discrepancies, but overall, not a bad movie to sit back and enjoy.<br />Michael Dyckman, the reason the chief reported to the Lieutenant is that the rank of chief (multiple levels) is an enlisted rank whereas the rank of lieutenant (again, multiple levels)is an officer rank.  By the way Michael, enjoyed your review of U-571.
B0000024IE|5.0|NOT AS GOOD AS PAUL'S BOUTIQUE! <br />Why don't they make albums like this anymore? This has GOT to be the most angry hate-filled militant album ever. Well, okay not &quot;hate-filled&quot;. That was a stupid word. Ummm... How about &quot;in your face&quot;? Anyway, I admit that I know absolutely NOTHING about rap, but I gotta say that in the ten years since &quot;Fear&quot; there hasn't been anywhere NEAR an album as powerful as this. <br />See, Public Enemy were SUPPOSED to be the band that brought hip-hop to the white American mainstream, but then that stupid Dr Dre came around, turned it into a macho sexist killfest and RUINED THE WHOLE GENRE!  Nowadays you'll NEVER hear a song with lyrics as biting as those on the title song or &quot;Welcome To The Terrordome&quot;. At least I haven't. GREAT songs.<br />One song that is NOT great, however, is &quot;Meet the G that killed me&quot;, that shows that P.E. may be noise geniuses, but they are also HOMOPHOBIC!  That's not cool at all. Fight homophobia!<br />Oh by the way... Were Elvis &amp; John Wayne racist? It's NOT simple and plain. If they WERE, how did Public Enemy know this? Those are the greatest lyrics on the whole album though, even if they aren't true. I don't know, I guess there's just something really refreshing to hear somebody scream about the evils of the world in the world in such a direct manner. It's like they're staring racist white America straight in the eye. If anybody out there has any information on it please let me know.
6301562143|5.0|First, the music tells you that you are watching an epic tale; a man robbed of his childhood by crime. Withdrawing into himself he builds a suit of armor and his body into a crime-fighting super hero who confronts criminals directly, in-you-face: &quot;I AM BATMAN&quot; he says matter-of-factly. With nothing to lose, he is invincible as he confronts evil and keeps a dark city livable. Meanwhile, you have a cocky gangster finally gets his just deserts and he's disfigured. He, too has nothing to live or and he goes for the &quot;jugular&quot; of the city in a direct take-over scheme. We know that both men will eventually clash and it will be an epic struggle. As the audience, you don't really know the implications until Michael Keaton's Bruce Wayne tests the Joker and almost gets killed. The Joker remarks:<br />&quot;Ever dance with the devil in the pale moon light?&quot;<br />A haunting vision of what a crime incident is like, IF you survive it--Bruce Wayne's mom and dad did not. The verbal skirmish that led to the shooting was over reporter Kim Bassinger's Vicky Vale--a symbol of life that both men want but can't seem to have. While Batman and Joker battle it out leading up to the city's festival, Batman gets shot down in his jet and is hurt and bleeding. The tables have turned, he no longer has all the &quot;wonderful toys&quot; and the upper hand. You don't see him calling for an ambulance or &quot;time out&quot;. There is no time for this, the mission must come first. He has to go straight up---the same gothic church bell tower from VERTIGO and fight every step of the way because Joker must be stopped. His determination, his courage---propels him from the burning wreckage of his downed aircraft to meet Joker's thugs one-by-one as Vicki dances with the maniac criminal. The music reminds us that Batman will not be stopped as he knocks off each hoodlum until its just the Joker and Vicki. Then he asks Joker, the question:<br />&quot;Ever dance with the devil in the pale moon light?&quot;<br />SMACK!<br />He confronts his parent's killer.<br />A great film that reminds us that it takes someone willing to go toe-to-toe with criminals to stop them or we would all be victims. When we are as determined as Batman is to bring criminals to justice our crime problems will be greatly reduced.ale moon light?&quot;<br />SMACK!<br />He confronts his parent's killer. <br />A great film that reminds us that it takes someone willing to go toe-to-toe with criminals to stop them or we would all be victims.

157330087X|3.0|When I checked the line up I didn't really give buying this disc much thought. But after Jimmies try hard performance, performing in the light of his far more talented brother, I was more than a little disappointed. Jimmie just cant play, and the others seemed to be held back as though they weren't really into it. Given the event, I found this surprising. You would think a performance in Stevie's memory would inspire greater performances but I have seen them all perform well above what they do here.  For all that, it is still rare to see performers like this all in one place, paying tribute to a genuinely brilliant talent who is so sadly missed. If you want to remember the man, then this isn't the best way to go.
6303109950|5.0|Every once in awhile magic on the screen takes place where you don't expect it, least of all a dry, dusty western. This isn't really a western, this is a movie about friendship, courage, and about starting over.<br />Val Kilmer simply has the role of his career, where he catches the essence of Doc Holiday; for him there is no chance to &quot;start over&quot;, he is dying so he has to live in the here and now, helped by sexy Joanna Pacula. Standing in his way of enjoying his last days, and Wyatt Earp starting over is a group of bad guys who want to control the town by intimidation. Johnny Ringo is their faster gunslinger and he knows it. After showing his speed, Doc decides to put on a display of his own---the twirling cup sequence is brilliant and legendary. The &quot;Cowboys&quot; know that the Earps will not stand for their presence and Doc is with them.<br />After epic battles, where Doc comes to life and helps Kurt Russel's Earp and brothers put an end to the &quot;cowboys&quot;, there remains Johnny Ringo. And Johnny Ringo is faster than Earp. Russell doesn't know what to do. He is at his limit. He must face Johnny Ringo, his eventual end as a gunfighter..but he wants to start a new life with sexy, GORGEOUS Dana Delaney, herself a person with a &quot;past&quot;. Its like life will not give him a break for upholding the law. Meanwhile, his best friend, Doc is dying in his bed. Earp must meet Ringo in the morning. Outlook does not look good. But he must go, this is the TRUE test of courage that you do your duty when you know this time you are not going to make it. A similar ethos was when Matthew Broderick's Colonel leads the night attack at the end of Glory; you can sense their anguish, that this really is the end of the line.<br />What I want to remark on is the FRIENDSHIP of Doc Holliday towards Wyatt.  Ifthat doesn't move you, well!
0780631684|4.0|You think you can cheat death? No way! The movie has a great premise (kid has a premonition of a plane crash, gets kicked off plane - with some friends - plane really does crash).<br />But death feels cheated and in the most intricate, wonderfully choreographed ways it gets revenge (or tries to) on all those who avoided dying on the plane.<br />What lifts the movie above the cliche is the ways you are kept guessing as to who is next and how they will go. Also there is very little gratuitous gore or violence, something else that sets this movie apart.<br />You get some nice extra bits with the DVD (alternate ending - which I think is not as good as the original)but for the movie alone, this is worth buying and playing to your friends again and again. Just try to count the coincidences required to pull off a death! No wonder the grim reaper looks tired if he has to go through this effort to pick us off!

B000001EL3|5.0|&quot;Destroyer&quot; is the crowning achievement for this legendary band. This was the album that silenced the criticism and presented a band at its creative apex. &quot;Destroyer&quot; displayed a new found maturity and a colorful wide range with its intricate eclectic mix of songs. Famed producer Bob Ezrin who had produced such esteemed artists as Lou Reed and Alice Cooper put his creative spark into the making of &quot;Destroyer.&quot; &quot;Detroit Rock City&quot; and &quot;King Of The Night Time World&quot; contained imaginative lyrics,involved arrangements,and presented hard rock with a polished sophistication. &quot;Beth&quot; was an exquisite ballad arranged with orchestra and was a top 40 hit for the band. &quot;Do You Love Me&quot; was glam rock pomposity at its most gleaming with Paul Stanley providing all of the fireworks. &quot;God Of Thunder&quot; captures Gene Simmons at his most mischievous and is overwhelming in its concentrated dominating might. &quot;Shout It Out Loud&quot; is a great anthem bursting with a contagious enthusiasm that is timeless and classic. &quot;Destroyer&quot; also contains the proud protest of &quot;Flaming Youth&quot; and the playful &quot;Sweet Pain.&quot; Sheer Perfection! O.F.
B00003CXE7|5.0|With the exception of &quot;Braveheart&quot;, &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot;, and &quot;Dances With Wolves&quot; there isn't a better epic motion picture.  The battle scene at the beginning of the film is so impressive and realistic it will give you chills.  From watching how the Roman soldiers are assembled on the battlefield to how they devastate their enemy, every sequence is done with historical accuracy.  It gives you a true sense of what made the Roman Empire so powerful.        The film is extremely graphic in its battle sequences, but how else is a director supposed to give the viewer a true sense of what it must have really been like to live in such a savage age.        The story is tremendously gripping and sucks you into Maximus' (the main character) life in such a way that you feel vindicated at the movie's climax.        &quot;Gladiator&quot; is one of my all time favorite movies and I honestly can't wait to own this 2 disk collection.
B00004XONN|4.0|Radiohead has always been about great music. But it seems like each album has had its missteps. On Pablo Honey, there were only two songs, Creep and Thinking About You, that I thought were really top level songs. But then The Bends provided a whole CD full of great songs, however, each sort of stood alone, didn't relate to the others, and so in the larger scheme of &quot;the perfect album&quot; it failed, albiet gloriously. It made sense, then, that OK Computer would attempt the same, but be more fluid, more cohesive, more thematic. And it did that in a most inspired way. The only misstep, I felt, was that electronic voice thing in the middle, which I tolerate now, but still seems like a forced idea--a way to prove a point that has already been proven by the context of the other songs. <br />Kid A continues the trend. It reaches higher, pretty much abandons all pretense of what we think of as &quot;Pop Music,&quot; and still lands an emotional connection. And here's where Radiohead has always rated with me. They connect. This is, of course, subjective, but just as certain smells or images can unleash a horde of memories so it with sounds. Kid A puts together a tapestry of sounds that provide a dreamlike landscape of emotions. Twice I emailed friends while listening to this CD, telling them that I was having a &quot;Radiohead Moment.&quot; Meaning, I was connecting and feeling very emotional about the music. <br />This, isn't a perfect album. As with anything, if you don't fall you're not trying hard enough. The CD could be more story-like-- beginning, middle, end--be more pointed and show a greater range; it could use a classic denoument. But still it satisfies and grows with each listen and shows the boys can consistently push the envelope. <br />Perfect? No. But a penultimate effort for sure. I'll be listening to this CD for a long time and I look forward to much more.
B00004XONN|1.0|I was so horribly disappointed with this album, considering that I thought THE BENDS and OK COMPUTER were both brilliant albums. I thought OK COMPUTER was one of the best albums of the century! KID A is a departure, but much too much of a departure. It's just background noise, not unlike U2's side project Passengers (which I also disliked). Unfortunately, I was looking for guitar hooks, over-the-top vocals, brilliant song structure. I didn't get it! There are only one or two songs worth listening to. It is supposedly a &quot;concept&quot; album, but what (or where) is the concept? To me, KID A is just a bunch of guys in a studio acting new age, trying to invent something that's not there. It doesn't work. Radiohead, where is thy brilliance?
B000000OAN|4.0|Does this album define everything Queen was about?  Yes.  Is it excessive, bombastic, overflowing with detail and talent oozing from every musician?  Yes.  Does it contain Queen's greatest known song?  Yes, as well as other great songs.  As a whole, is it the best Queen album?  No.<br />  A Night at the Opera, as a whole, is very, very overrated. Most of the songs stand up well on their own, and the album starts off promising, with Death on Two Legs and I'm in Love with My Car sandwiching the loose, carefree Lazing on a Sunday Afternoon (sadly, Queen tries to remake this feel two other times on the album and it just doesn't work).  I'm in Love with My Car is handled masterfully by Roger Taylor and Brian May takes his vocals to the jangly, easy-going '39 and the pointless throwaway Good Company.  You're My Best Friend is a lovely, wistful tune which marks John Deacon's single debut as a songwriter and was a big hit.  Love of My Life is a simply beautiful love song and you can almost feel Mercury's heart breaking with every falsetto note, and Bohemian Rhapsody needs no explanation.<br />  However, the dizzying heights that are reached on this album are undercut by the bad moments, the aforementioned Sweet Lady is one of the worst songs this band ever did, simply unlistenable, and the carefree filler songs, instead of occasionally lightening the mood as they did on Queen II and Sheer Heart Attack, instead break up the flow of the album to the point where it's almost incoherent.  And when they try and completley re-hash the mother of all Queen epics, March of the Black Queen, with the Prophet's Song, they experience a rare moment where even the masters of excess can't handle the ridiciously long vocal-overdubbed passage in the middle of the song (It DOES start and end great, however, with haunting, apocolyptic verses and great singing and guitar work).<br />  A Night at the Opera may be a good introduction to what Queen was all about, excessiveness, carefree fun tempered by the occasional humorous, venemous rocker and the lumbering epic, but they've done it better before (Queen II) and they'd repeat this formula in fragments on later albums.  Their best two albums are Queen II and Innuendo, but as mentioned before, A Night at the Opera does do a great job of capturing Queen in the full spirit of what they're about.  Just don't be expecting the BEST of them when you get it.
0811826848|5.0|This beautifully bound book is more than I expected . The Beatles have always delivered on quality and value for the fans and this is no exception . Many photos are recognizable to the foursome's rabid followers but much more are new to public view . One picture I especially like is one of George and Paul sharing a laugh at a studio mike during sessions for the Abbey Road LP . ( And to think popular myth says they never had fun in their latter days as a group!). The layout is creatively done with writings and documents of Beatle significance often overlaid on the page . Think you know about all there is to know about the lads ? ... Paul McCartney, George Harrison, Ringo Starr , and the recorded rememberences of the groups founder John Lennon will prove you wrong . After over 30 years of a mountain of Beatle books it's only fitting that The Beatles themselves have the last word . To those who would say that they are just cashing in again on their fame I say : So What ! The Beatles were ripped off financially in so many ways in their performing days that they deserve everything they receive from this book .
0440211727|5.0|I have now read all of John Grisham's books and A Time To Kill is by far the best.  It is a well written and gripping read.  Grisham's recent books have started to feel formulatic and predictable.  This book is exciting and is truly a page turner.  It will entertain you and make you think at the same time.  If you have read a more recent Grisham book and disliked it give this one a try.  It really is a great book.
0767803434|5.0|DVD was made for movies like Air Force One.<br />It is definately the the best DVD I know, not meaning the best movie, but the best DVD.  It's maximum impact! The sound, the images, so crisp and clear, as close to theater quality as humanly possible!  The DVD I think  will even have a chance of surpassing it is Jurassic Park, but we'll have to wait a see if that's true.<br />Of course the movie itself is nothing to sneeze at, it's fantastic!  Wolfgang Peterson is a brilliant director, only he, mabye John McTiernan (director of Die Hard) could make an action movie this well.  The sound is incredible, the special effects are superb (except for in the last scene) the score is rich and patriotic (hats off to Jerry Goldsmith) and the acting, well let me tell you about the acting.<br />Harrison Ford, finaly a president you can like!  His acting is unsurpassed as always, heck we even finaly get to see Harrison Ford cry in this film!  And who makes him cry?  Only the 2nd craziest actor in hollywood, Gary Oldman (Christopher Walken being the first)  His portrayel of a Neo-Russian Radical is believable and terrifying.  The other actors are fair in their roles.  <br />I had one problem with the film though, parts of it were kind of confusing.  You find out right in the beginning who let the terrorists on the plane, yet the guy always seems to be on the good guys side even when he's fighting the terrorists, and oh, it's just too confusing to think about.  The action of the film is so intense though that you'll hardly notice the first time, but once you've watched the film as many times as I have, you might notice.<br />Once again this was the type of movie DVDs were made for, great action that makes for a great sound and video, without throwing away plot.
B00004TL21|5.0|The Deftones have emerged as probably the best band in hard music today (closely followed by Incubus and Rage Against the Machine).  Chino is a genius songwriter, and the band has just an incredible melodic sound. I found myself being totally relaxed at points listening to the CD just from the melodies.  Then the song would explode into a rage, and you would just be totally blown away. I had heard the two Deftones albums before this one, but I have to say this album tops all others.  It is definitely the best hard rock album of 2000.  Absolutely incredible CD.

B00000G3PA|1.0|I'll start by saying that I had really high expectations for this movie.The idea of a meteor hitting the Earth, possibly wiping out all life, I thought ''cool'', it had some decent actors in it, an excellent director, so where did it all go wrong? This must be one of the worst movies of all time, the idea is good, and was portrayed quite well in ''deep impact''(although it was hated by people, I really liked it.)  Although it starts off ok, then the ''oh the Americans will save the day'' thing starts, just like in ''Independence Day'', although in that movie, it wasn't so blatant.  I know it was only a movie, but come on.  And the end? Oh my. HOW BAD?????????????? Anyone who really gets genuinely upset about this must be pretty sad.  The best thing about the whole movie was the music and score.
B00000BKDZ|4.0|This is the album that lift Iron Maiden back to the impressing level they used to be on during the early 80's. it is also the album that introduced synths to the Maiden fanbase. It is been praised to be the second highlight of their career ( Number Of The Beast being the first ), but personally I don't think it quite stands up to challenge it. It is quite as good as Piece Of Mind, and as a whole, better than Powerslave. Sometimes the synths disturb me, though, and every now and then the songs don't sound as heavy. Good example is &quot;Can I Play With Madness&quot;, which is way too commercial, if you ask me. Still, &quot;Seventh son...&quot; is a very convincing effort, offering the best song material since The Number Of The beast.
B00004Z511|5.0|Amazing!  Radiohead was already on my top ten list of bands I love, but I wasn't really sure that this alblum was going to meet the standards that I hoped to hear. The bands' progression in style and lyrics has has a new &quot;ambiance&quot; that no one can deny.  I reccomend listening to this alblum when you need creative inspiration-- Although I wouldn't reccomend listening to it when your really bummed.  If so be prepared to feel your heart break.  Because you can feel his passion and creative energy in every song.

Hits from &quot;WAKING UP THE NEIGHBORS&quot;(1991) &quot;RECKLESS&quot;(1994) AND &quot;ON A DAY LIKE TODAY&quot;(1998) All of these songs are very good and reminds the listener that Bryan Adams hasne't slowed down even if the ill-fated &quot;18 TILL I DIE&quot; Realase was considered by many to be a weak point.

0060926317|3.0|When I originally saw Marlo Morgan on a CNN interview I dismissed her story as utterly unbelievable, but upon seeing the beautiful and cover at a bookstore I was compelled to buy it anyway.  I thoroughly enjoyed the book and many of the concepts it promotes. One particular quote on death I found so insightful I shared it as a final message sent to dying friend. It saddened me to find (after speaking to some white Australians and doing some Internet research) that I was naïve. The book has some wonderful concepts and I have no regrets about the feelings it stirred or giving the quote to my friend. Alas in my opinion it is no more than White American woman's wonderful fantasy. It saddens me  that she seems to have greatly insulted the people she so admires, and I hope the monetary gain she has received is being used charitably.  However I believe positive  ideas and acts can be sparked by inspirational books of dubious sources. The question of the authorship of Chief Seattle's inspirational speech is one example. If someone is sent down an erroneous path but still achieves a new level of enlightenment, is the flawed path to be considered bad?     <br />Below is an overview by ROBERT EGGINGTON  [...]<br />Robert Eggington is a Noongah man form the southwest of Western Australia. The traditional heritage of his people is embedded in the south west forest regions. The word 'Noongah' means `person', by which collectively the Aboriginal people of the southwest region identify themselves and their homelands. As the coordinator of the Dumbartung Aboriginal Corporation, Mr Robert Eggington organizes strategies to oppose cultural appropriation and exploitation. Before compiling the present and the previous reports, he has traveled extensively through outback regions, consulting with Aboriginal people about their response to the Book &quot;Mutant Message Downunder&quot;. In early 1996 Mr Eggington led a delegation of elder representatives to the United States, to formally protest the content and implication of &quot;Mutant Message Downunder&quot;. The contingent of Aboriginal elders represent the Voice of all Aboriginal people regarding cultural exploitation and appropriation.   <br />Overview<br />In 1990, Marlo Morgan published a book, &quot;Mutant Message Downunder&quot;, which chronicles the journey of a middle-age, white American woman with a group of 62 desert Aborigines, the &quot;Real People&quot;, across the continent of Australia. The book was written after the fact inspired by actual experience. &quot;Mutant Message Downunder&quot; quickly attained popularity with the new age movement in the United States and consequently the book was picked by giant publishing firm Harper Collins. To date over half a million copies of the Harper Collins version have been sold in the United States and Europe. In her lectures, Ms Morgan speaks of her actual experience with the &quot;real people&quot; and States that she is an Aborigine. A survey of Aboriginal groups in Central and Western Australia failed to uncover any indication of Ms Morgan's presence in the area, or of the existence of the &quot;real people&quot; tribe. Aboriginal groups believe Ms Morgan's desert journey to be utterly fabricated and that her book and teaching's lack any credibility whatsoever. It is deeply offensive to Aboriginal People for a white woman to be misrepresenting Aboriginal culture for self-promotion and profit. Aboriginal people are appalled that Ms Morgan's false Message is being accepted as fact by a naive American and European marker and are extremely concerned about the resulting long term implications for their culture. This report details the process undertaken by Aboriginal groups and initiated by their response to &quot;Mutant Message Downunder&quot;, which has lead to a unified voice of opposition to the exploitation of indigenous cultures throughout the world.

B00000K31Q|4.0|10 Things I Hate About You is a fairly basic teen love story, but with the added twist of Shakespeare and some good comedic acting.<br />The story is based on Shakespeare's Taming of the Shrew. It is about two sisters, one very popular, Bianca Stratford (played by Larisa Oleynik) and the other, Katrina, or \\"Kat\\" (played by Julia Stiles) hated because of her gruff character. Their overbearing father (played by the hilarious Larry Miller), devises a scheme whereby Bianca cannot date until rebellious Katrina does, which seems an impossibility. Thereby is set up a scheme to pair Katrina off with the roguish Patrick Verona. One of the masterminds of this plot is Cameron James (played by Joseph Gordon-Levitt), a newcomer to Padua high, where the movie takes place. The other is his assistant of sorts, Michael Eckman (played by David Khumoltz).<br />Though somewhat predictable, especially if you have read Taming of the Shrew, it is an interesting light diversion. The dialogue is quite well done, intertwining a word or phrase from Shakespeare with modern teen slang. Other odes to Shakespeare are seen in Kat's friend who idolizes him as if he is a teen heartthrob, plus reading of his works in one Kat's classes. The timing in the dialogue is also very Shakespearean (for a comedy). It's Very rapid fire. I think both David Khumoltz and Larry Miller are amazingly funny!<br />Overall, this is not your typical shallow teen romance movie, but can appeal to anyone who enjoys witty dialogue, and many literary references.<br />The DVD is unremarkable. It has a good DD 5.1 soundtrack driven by a nice selection of alternative rock - Letters from Clio had several cameos, but I believe they mainly played cover tunes, not their own stuff. The DVD does not contain any special features.

630542828X|3.0|A Civil action is a solid movie with some good performances and a story that does not cave into Hollywood's propensity for clich&eacute;s.<br />I was not expecting a whole lot from this movie, so I was pleasantly surprised. It offers an intriguing story based on real events surrounding the contamination of the water supply in the small, industrial Boston suburb. However, it seems to be at least as much if not more so about the legal process than about the suit itself. Travolta, who plays the prosecuting attorney, Jan Schlichtmann, before the trial was a successful was a not very respected personal injury lawyer (A.K.A. ambulance chaser). During the progression of the story, he narrates advice to the audience as if a he is a law professor. It is this instruction that he himself does not follow and thus leads to trouble for himself and his clients. The movie, in this way, is almost as much about the seemingly illogical logic behind litigation then it is about the individual case it portrays.<br />Travolta does an excellent job as the attorney who feels he constantly has something to prove to the corporate monstrosities of Beatrice and Grace and their Harvard-educated attorneys (Schlichtmann, it turns out, graduated from lowly Northwestern). Robert Duvall plays Jerome Facher, Beatrice's lawyer, as an old wise man who has seen everything and is impossible to ruffle. All he wants is to be left alone to eat his lunch in peace and he is content. William H. Macy plays Schlichtmann's firm's increasingly depressed accountant who is forced to leverage the partner's mortgages and take pile charges onto 20 credit cards in the seemingly hopeless effort to wait out the juggernauts their firm is up against.<br />The DVD is itself very mediocre. It has a 5.1 Dolby Digital soundtrack, but because this isn't an action film, but more of a human/courtroom drama, there's really not a whole lot here to take advantage of 5.1 channels. The only &quot;special feature&quot; of this DVD is the so-called &quot;Production Featurette&quot; which must be all of 5 minutes long and amounts to more of a glorified trailer than anything else - basically it's just a rehash of scenes from the movie with a couple of really quick takes from Travolta and Macy about the movie. I hope that Touchstone will improve a bit on these featurettes in the future to where they actually contain some significant content.-called &quot;Production Featurette&quot; which must be all of 5 minutes long and amounts to more of a glorified trailer than anything else - basically it's just a rehash of scenes from the movie with a couple of really quick takes from Travolta and Macy about the movie.

B00004XONN|4.0|A few reviews mention &quot;pretentious,&quot; but just throwing that word around means you are just that...Radiohead is too normal in terms of lifestyle and too bright not to know when they are or are not pretentious.  &quot;Kid A&quot; is great (with the exception of track 5 which is Brian Eno re-done), and those who think it is atonal or monotonous need listen to it a few times.  There's plenty of hooks, you just need to listen for them, and any record worth its salt doesn't divulge its secrets on first listen...I don't remember thinking that &quot;Ok Computer,&quot; &quot;Achtung Baby,&quot; &quot;Exile on Main Street&quot; or anything REM or Costello has done to be extraordinary on first listen, in fact most of them I despised for about five listens.  Ditto with &quot;Kid A.&quot;  No, it's not &quot;Ok Computer&quot; (thank God) but it is truly great...the best analogies I can come up with are REM's &quot;Green&quot; which followed the awesome &quot;Document&quot; and preceded &quot;Out of Time&quot; and &quot;Automatic for the People&quot;, and U2's &quot;Rattle and Hum&quot; (also labeled pretentious) between &quot;Joshua Tree&quot; and &quot;Achtung Baby.&quot;  Radiohead's next album is slated for March folks, and I think we are just getting set-up for round two of greatness, much like U2 and REM did a decade ago...Perhaps Mr. Yorke consulted Mr. Stipe on how to temper expectations...Anyway, however &quot;Kid A&quot; is received, this band's place in the Pantheon is assured.
0385484518|5.0|I read this book after hearing so many good things about it and the TV movie based on it. It's a very quick read - I finished it in two days, which is unheard of for me! The book is basically about Morrie Schwartz, a history professor at Brandeis University, who has been diagnosed with ALS (Lou Gehrig's Disease) and is dying. A former student, Mitch Albom, who had become a fairly well known sports writer, heard about his teacher from an interview with Ted Koppel on Nightline and decided to pay a visit. This visit soon turned into regular meetings - on Tuesdays - since at the time there was a strike at Albom's newspaper. Albom plots Morrie's declining health, which is quite depressing, but at the same time imparts Morrie's wisdom. One definitely can get a sense of what the important things in life are from someone who has little left, but Morrie is particularly eloquent and seems to carry an upbeat dignity to the end. Sometimes it takes the wisdom of a dying man to jog us enough to realize that human relationships and health are more important than all the gadgets, modern conveniences, pressures to get ahead professionally and monetarily combined. This is just the main point that Morrie starts &quot;teaching&quot; Albom and getting through to someone who, like many of us from time to time, have gotten obsessed with the real trivialities of life. The only complaint I have about this book is that it wasn't longer. I wanted to take more time and savor the wisdom and sweetness of this old man, but, like his illness's swiftness, reading the book seemed to go by all too quickly.
B00004XONN|5.0|The first time I heard this album, it simply didn't register.  Strange sound effects and meandering melodies strung together into &quot;songs&quot;.  I could have written a typical one or two star review at that point, complaining about how Radiohead has &quot;let me down&quot; and produced pretentious artsy electronic trash. Too much pressure to follow up OK Computer, yada yada. Then I listened to it again, and again. Then I couldn't STOP listening to it. (Uh-oh, need another hit of Kid A.) This is music to learn to appreciate, not to instantly like. As strange as the title track sounds, it is a puzzle to be contemplated each listening. (So far I've decided that the song reflects a young child's or infant's perspective, and that there's an allusion to the Pied Piper leading &quot;rats and children out of town&quot;. Who's got &quot;heads on sticks&quot;? The title, according to the NY Times magazine, derives from a software package containing children's songs, not the first human clone, as Thom Yorke joked. Hmmmm) As usual with a Radiohead album, repeated listening yields greater rewards. Kid A is no less crafted than anything else they've done. If you haven't already, give it a chance.
0345404475|5.0|I read Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep quite a few years ago, and many years after seeing the movie that was based on this book, &quot;Blade Runner.&quot; It was an extremely engrossing read.<br />If you've seen the movie, don't worry about the book being old hat. The two are actually quite different. The whole premise is kind inverted. Instead of the replicants being hunted down because they had developed emotion, they are being hunted down because they HAVE no emotion, so have no qualms about killing others. It's definitely a twist, but a very interesting one.<br />The preciousness of life, particularly animal life, however, is probably even more emphasized in the book than the movie. In addition, the book adds another dimension called Murcererism, which is this odd hi-tech form of religion. Kind of a machine that produces spiritual experiences and thus makes life more livable in a post-apocalyptic world where all animals (aside from humans) have been made extinct by the radiation from the bombs.
0792836510|5.0|There are 2 kinds of film in this world, gringo.  Those that are cinematic classics, and those that are not.<br />This is one of the former.<br />The three leads are truly magnetic in their screen presence.  Eli Wallach, Clint Eastwood and Lee Van Cleef are all tremendous in their own way.  Every time I'm asked to say who is best, I always get close to saying Wallach, and then the stone-faced visage of Eastwood comes into my head.  It's impossible to say who is the best, but it may be a fair assessment to say that all three are outshined from an unexpected quarter...<br />Ennio Morricone's soundtrack has entered the realms of cinematic lore as being amongst the best ever written.  It twists with the flow of the landscape, and always marks out the scenes perfectly.  Wallach running through the cemetary is indelibly etched in my mind thanks to the brilliant scoring work (which I first heard because of, strangely enough, Metallica).<br />2 and a half hours is quite a stretch, but once you have seen the poignancy, nihilism and general brilliance of every frame, you will want to watch it again and again.<br />Watch it, and be enriched.
B00004XONN|4.0|ok. i just bought this cd. while its not as good as the previous radiohead cd's like pablo honey and the bends, its still damn good.  not many bands are able to carry new sounds into every album well, and sound dumb doing it. but radiohead can play any style of music and make it sound good. they've gone from a trendy alternaive band, into what words cannot describe( there's no way to describe their sound).  but they still continue to amaze me and remain fresh with every cd they put out.  i highly recoomend this cd for serious radiohead fans
B000002J1B|5.0|This year, thanks to my curiousity of discovering progressive music (old and new), and a few friends of mine, I have been rewarded with great satisfaction from many new purchases.    One of the albums I had been curious about was Relayer.  I had heard so many great things said about it, had read many reviews here heaping praises upon it, yet still did not heed the advice.    It was only through seeing and hearing for myself that my eyes and ears were opened.  This summer I finally had the opportunity to experience a live Yes show for the first time.  I had read on the Yes website that this tour was going to be special- the set list was voted on by their fans.  And the songs chosen were all classics from the prime era of the band.  I was somewhat a casual fan of &quot;classic&quot; Yes, owned a couple of albums, and bought most of the &quot;new era&quot; material, and grew tired of it.    Most of these chosen songs I had never heard for myself- yet I had heard how great they were by word of mouth.  One of those songs I heard for the first time that night was &quot;The Gates of Delirium&quot;.  I could go on for days describing how exhilarating and powerful a listening experience it was. I just stood there, mystified by just what I was hearing!  It was unlike anything I had ever heard before- not just a song, but pure drama building and building, twisting and turning, rising and falling, and rising again until the music seemed to &quot;explode&quot;.  And after the release of all the pent-up rage, what I heard next was so completely soothing and beautiful I nearly cried.  I HAD to hear this all again, and soon...   So I went out and bought Relayer almost immediately (the first chance I got), and have been listening to it nearly endlessly ever since.  I do not think I can ever tire of hearing this great work.    So what can I say about &quot;The Gates of Delirium&quot; that hasn't already been oft-repeated here?  Only that it is likely the most delirious (pun intended), yet wonderful piece of modern rock music ever set to tape.  It starts quietly, but with an underlying tone of warning in the opening theme, then segues into Jon Anderson's opening vocal, accompanied by Steve Howe's playful guitar melody and Patrick Moraz's serene Moog synth.  Then the rest of the band comes in, somewhat aggressively, but a bit understating in the tension.  It gets quiet again, similar to the first verse, then the full band comes back in response, but now more forcefully over Anderson's angrier vocal as the drama builds more.   Then a Moraz keyboard line syncopated with a couple of clever Alan White tom fills launches the band into a section that culminates with Howe's solo.  Back come the vocals, and Chris Squire's bass mimicing the warning tone of the opening theme.  The rest of the band returns in much the same manner as its preceding part, but now with Howe and Moraz subtly trading parts here, foreshadowing what is soon to come.  Finally, one last angry Anderson vocal over Howe's snarling guitar, and then... at the 8 minute mark, a musical battle of epic porportions ensues as Moraz and Howe duel frenetically, while Squire's lightning fast Rick bass runs and White's drums (nearly buried in the frenzy) add their own elements to the battle.  As the battle rages on, each of Moraz and Howe's responses grow in intensity, and build to a climax as both &quot;sides&quot; prepare for the kill.  The frenzy slows with White finally coming to the fore with a long thunderous fill that slows toward the end, announcing the final phase of the battle.  Moraz leads off with his last attack for nearly a minute.  Howe responds, now on slide guitar, by repeating Moraz's part, with White throwing in some great fills for good measure until, finally, one last squeal from Howe's slide and a White fill brings the battle to an end, as both sides breathe their last, and an ethereal calm comes for the next minute as the smoke clears from the battlefield...   And then... thepeace comes, in the form of music so far removed from everything you have heard for the past 16 minutes, so sublime and beautiful tears will come to your eyes just from the release from madness.  I wish I could go on longer describing the &quot;Soon&quot; segment, but I know I've gone on too long.  Just listen, and see for yourself.  I don't think you will ever hear a piece of music quite like this on any other rock album.  You won't be disappointed.     No matter what you (or others) may think of the other two tracks, &quot;Sound Chaser&quot; and &quot;To Be Over&quot;, Relayer is worth the price for &quot;The Gates of Delirium&quot; alone, yet both of these songs are outstanding as well.  &quot;Sound Chaser&quot; is frenzied and aggressive, yet subtly beautiful in its own right, and &quot;To Be Over&quot; is a soothing closer that features some lovely sitar and slide guitar by Howe, and gentle vocal harmonies.
0440234743|5.0|The Testament was the first book I ever read by John Grisham.  The novel captivated me and carried me on a pleasant journey.  When it comes to books my fastidious nature sometimes forces me to overlook impeccable material.  After reading &quot;The Testament&quot; I've been on a Grisham binge to read everything he has touched.  If you have seen the movies this does not preclude the suspense and enjoyment you'll encounter by reading the novel.  From my experience, books are often significantly better than the movie.  Read &quot;The Testament&quot; you'll love it.
B00004TWZF|2.0|I am sorry to say that the Director's Cut of The Big Blue was very disappointing, sonically that is.  I bought the movie on DVD to enjoy the marvelous Luc Besson masterpiece and later  realized that all the music was changed.  A different score was apparently written and used in this version.  I loved the music from the original, which Eric Serra originally composed.  I would like to know if you can buy the DVD with the original soundtrack, otherwise I am returning my DVD and finding an old VHS.  I'd like to see the new DVD include the original score.  Great movie, its too bad the musical score was changed.

0875847706|5.0|The Art of Possibility, Transforming Professional and Personal Life, by Zander and Zander is a creative and in some ways an exciting book. In the book the authors write about ways the reader can get out of the&quot; box&quot;, to  see and experience a new perspective on things, and situations. The book also talks about empowering yourself and others. If you have done the EST Traning now known as the Forum you will find nothing new in this book. All the same its nice to see the ideas of Werner Erhard,Stewart Emery and L.Ron Hubbard explained in a new light. If you like this book , you will also enjoy Out Of The Box for life by Warren Berland and Working With Emotional Intelligence by Daniel Goldman. Both authors write about some of the ideas found in the Zanders Book. If you are not familiar with Erhard,Emery or Hubbard. hold on to your hat this book will be an eye opener

0060930349|5.0|A fantastic work! It is a pleasure to see a balanced view of American history for a change. A breath of fresh, unbiased air amid the liberal-elitest-American bashing-leftist smog. Anyone who considers themselves a well read historian MUST have a copy in their collection. As an educator I've already included it as required reading in the curriculum for my history students and many of my peers are doing the same.
158234082X|4.0|As a fifteen year member of the restaurant fraternity,I found Chef Bourdain's accounts of life in the &quot;Culinary Underbelly&quot;, Sordid, lewd, and deliciously accurate. While Chef does contrast his style and affection for chaos with Chef Scott Bryon's more reserved and in control methods, Chef Bourdain's accounts are far more the rule than the exception! The restaurant business is, almost by definition, a world, of break-neck energy, disturbingly diverse characters, and see it to believe it anecdotes. This book captures the true spirit and soul of the restaurant business. Moreover, it captures the passion of the cast of characters who call the industry their home, and to who, it is, all about the food. As for Chef Bourdain's writing style, I found the book to be a great read, he is not a highly polished pulitzer author, however I'm sure Mr. Stienbeck never tried to plate 300 meals in a night or even knew how to make a true demi-glace.
0684853523|5.0|If you are interested in writing, but unsure if you can actually produce, this book is for you.<br />King has synthesized a short biography of his life with a readable &quot;rules of the road&quot; for writing fiction. Although seemingly two different elements for a single book, both sections reinforce each other in this very readable piece.<br />King's life story is important in depicting himself as one of us. He is undoubtedly very talented, and his God-given talents sustain him at a unique level among current authors. But the fact that this man -- with no special training, no pedigree in literature or the arts, and no bank account to let him begin his career as a gentleman author -- was able to succeed will be a comfort to those who are wondering if their non-literary background excludes them from trying to write the stories they possess within. King was the product of a struggling single parent and wrote his first work in the laundry room of a doublewide trailer. The fact that he wasn't a child of privilege or the son of Shakespearean actors or a literary major at an Ivy makes his career accessible to many. And, if it is accessible it can be replicated. (I'm speaking of the actual writing, not any guarantee of commercial success).<br />The second part of this book reveals King's rules for good writing. Some of them are very practical. He reveals which stylebook to have handy, how one must kill most adverbs and his approach to writing dialogue. King's &quot;toolbox&quot; is a good starting point of reference. He also reveals his method of writing: do the first draft without input, write in a quite place, commit to producing 2,000 words a day every day (your novel will be finished in only three months!). These are also very useful instructions. This practical commentary is easy to follow and replicate for those who want to give their try at putting a good story to paper. I suspect as I write that hundreds of additional Americans who have read &quot;On Writing&quot; are getting up an hour early before work and hammering away at the story they always thought of trying to set to written words. His book has that motivational quality to it and succeeds at showing that &quot;you too can write with enough discipline and commitment.&quot;<br />I found it interesting that King does not plot out his stories. He has faith in a story developing from an interesting situation. The author creates situations in his mind before undertaking a new book. The story develops out of how his characters react to each other and events. This for me was the most surprising element of the book. I have always assumed that every successful storyteller knew how the story was going to end along and his major plot lines before committing pen to paper.<br />King brings parts one and two of his book together in describing the accident that almost killed him and how a return to writing (this book, in fact), helped heal what had been a very broken man.<br />All in all, a good book that will inspire the aspiring writer and presents a good road map and excellent toolbox for those who would seek to emulate the Stephen Kings of the world.; are getting up an hour early before work and hammering away at the story they always thought of trying to set to written words.

0446310786|5.0|I thought To Kill A Mocking Bird was a really good book The author, Harper Lee does a  really good job of tricking you into thinking you know exactly what is going to happen and then  the unthinkable happens. My favorite part was the end when the last thing you think could  possibly happen actually  happens. This book is fiction but it sounds as though it could or really has  happened.      The story takes place in Alabama, 1932 during segregation. It is told by Scout, an eight year old girl who does not want to grow up. She has an older brother named Jem and every summer their friend Dill comes up and visits them. They play games and try and get their creepy neighbor who never comes out, to come out. I think if the story had been told by Jem it would be totally different and the points of view would be very different.      I thought it was a very good book because something is always happening and you can't put it down. I highly recommend reading it.

0780627024|3.0|The premise of Pleasantville seemed irresistible (another \\"sure fire\\" Hollywood idea), but the execution turned out to be not so easy.  The problem is, it is very, very difficult to sustain a satire over an entire movie (although Kubrick did it in Dr. Strangelove); things can get especially confused if you try to make the satire into a morality tale with a \\"pleasant\\" ending, as Director Gary Ross does here.  He knows that life is too complex for easy answers, and that seemed to be one of the things he was trying to say, e.g., monogamy is not necessarily superior to, or inferior to, adultery.  Ditto for chastity and fornication.  Rain for a change is nice.<br />But he got confused somewhere along the way and ended up with a smug, sappy movie with ideas as shallow and black and white as the 50s milieu he was trying to satirize.  The \\"feel good\\" ending is beyond redemption, in its way even sappier than the mythical sit-com it tries to improve upon.  Yes, it is kind of neat to see things turn from black and white to color accompanied by stirring orchestral strings, especially as a result of something-like socking a bad guy in the jaw-that pleases one's prejudices.  But where are the shades of gray?  Not all red is fire engine red nor all blue, baby blue.<br />Reese Witherspoon plays a skanky teen (Jennifer) who teaches (as Mary Sue) the Pleasantvillians to fornicate (and her TV mom to masturbate) while she learns that reading is worthwhile.  Tobey Maguire plays her brother David/Bud who begins as a nerd, but ends up heroic, attractive to the opposite sex, and wise beyond his years.  (Yes, and we live in the best of all possible worlds.)  Strange how this movie manages to satirize itself.<br />Joan Allen is grim as the stay-at-home sit-com housewife, and William H. Macy is appropriately bland as her simpleminded husband.  Jeff Daniels as the soda jerk/artiste-and her unlikely lover-is tolerable.<br />Meandering through the film is a kind of confused extract of the Biblical story of the Garden of Eden.  In the Bible, eating the fruit from the tree of knowledge of good and evil forever removed humans from paradise.  In Pleasantville, knowledge of anything outside of town or of anything unpleasant has the same effect, while bestowing wondrous color.  We even have a very red apple presented to Bud by his TV girl friend Margaret (played with wholesome sexiness by pretty Marley Shelton).<br />What began to wear on me was the easy choice of target.  Going after fifties-style prudery and conformity is like shooting fish in a barrel.  I should add here that human desire is infinite: \\"too much is never enough.\\"  So perhaps it is better to start modestly with a soda at the soda fountain holding hands (the 50s style made fun of in the film) instead of immediately coupling below the dashboard with legs in the air (90s spin on same, lauded in the film).<br />Gary Ross, for your next flick, how about taking aim at today's violent, mercenary, duplicitous society?

B00004R99J|5.0|Meeko, Flit and Percy, these the are names of the animal friends who get in and out of mischief, befriend each other and accompany Pocahontas in the vast panorama of pristine North America that is the setting for \\"POCAHONTAS.\\" No Disney animated film would be complete without these familiar looking creatures and rightly so. These are films for the whole family, but \\"POCAHONTAS\\" was a notch above many of the animated films from Disney over the past two decades.<br />\\"POCAHONTAS\\" was a change-of-pace from the recent trend of animated films from Disney in 1995. This is one of my favorite Disney films and one of the best since the 1960s. It has substance and deals with real issues. We see the Native American Indians at peace and harmony with the land and nature. This is beautifully captured with the exceptional animation of vibrant green forests and flowing blue rivers. These scenes have a breath of fresh air about them that you can almost feel. When the European settlers arrive we know that it is only a matter of time before they begin to erode this paradise. The Europeans with closed minds did not realize how much they had to learn from the Indians and tried to impose their brand of civilization on them.  Their brand of civilization is to subjugate or annihilate the \\"savages\\" and ravage the land.<br />We see the two cultures meet in one of the finest animated scenes ever presented by Disney. Captain John Smith and Pocahontas come face to face by a waterfall. Smith lowers his rifle, as Pocahontas stands erect and unafraid. Their eyes meet and he no longer sees a \\"savage\\" but a human being. Their eyes tell us that they immediately fall in love. As Pocahontas  \\"listens with her heart\\" as Grandmother Willow has taught her they both communicate with each other. Soon their differences become apparent, but it is John Smith's ignorance revealed by inadvertently referring to Pocahontas as a \\"savage\\" that is the focus of the rift. He states that there is so much the \\"savages\\" can learn from the English. Pocahontas asks, &quot;If the savage one is me, how can there be so much that you don't know?&quot; During the \\"Colors of the Wind\\" sequence John Smith learns first hand the value and reverence of nature and that it should not be exploited out of mere human greed.<br />The message of \\"POCAHONTAS\\" is that European settlers leveled forests and imposed their own vision of a \\"civilized\\" society, whether or not it was welcome by the Native Americans. The corrupt Governor Ratcliffe is shown gleefully using cannons to level forests while his other men wield picks and axes in a mocking musical number. The brown piles of shoveled up earth stand in contrast to the majesty of the green untouched forest. When the settlers open fire on the Indians, they retaliate by capturing John Smith and prepare an execution for him. Only Pocahontas, who can empathize with both sides, can bring them to see their transgressions and teach them that violence only breeds violence.<br />The dramatic structure over which the film's message is delivered deals with her father's disapproval of the man she loves, because he belongs to a different race.  The film thus takes on more significance as it deals with ethnic discriminations as well. Her father wants her to marry a member of the tribe, who she dislikes because &quot;he's so serious.&quot; A similar theme is taken up in \\"THE LITTLE MERMAID.\\"<br />\\"POCAHONTAS\\" is based on legend, rooted in murky historical events. In real life, Pocahontas was about 13 when she first met John Smith. Smith claimed in his journals that Pocahontas saved his life. John Rolfe was the Englishman that she eventually married. She did indeed get to go to England (See \\"POCAHONTAS II\\"), where she was treated as a princess. She died in Europe, near 21 years of age.<br />What is particularly good about \\"POCAHONTAS\\" is the artistry of the animation. The virgin land of towering green forests, sparkling blue steams and rugged cliffs are drawn with a freedom and energy that posses real power and reverence. Very effective is the jutting rock that overlooks the landscape giving the entire film a feeling of sweep and grandeur. Anyone viewing the finale of this film can not help feel an emotional outburst as the \\"colors of the wind\\" blow past this precipice toward the horizon.  I know I did. The image is unforgettable.<br />The songs by Alan Menken and Stephen Schwartz include one unrestrained emotionally charged standout, &quot;Colors of the Wind.&quot; This is an unforgettable song that can be appreciated on so many levels.

6305750750|1.0|This is an absolutely horrendous pre-sequel. The first ten minutes are great. From there it slips into an abyss of boredom that even CG effects would not be able to duplicate. Hey! Great battle scenes near the end. Kind of looked like SPARTACUS. The only saving grace was John William's score. No, not the one we heard in the movie. That's right the one on CD. Sounded pretty good to me. But honestly, you have to admit that this film can't come close to Episodes IV, V or VI.  There is no innovation here, no magic. CG effects are not the answer. Go back to good old-fashioned scripting, editing, acting and melodrama. I hope the Force is with the next one.<br />As for the letterboxed VHS tape, it was pretty poor. The images were not clear or crisp at all. The quality of the tape itself was rather poor. There were quite a few dropout streaks. Very disappointing. Not a quality product. Bad showing all around. I just watched a letterboxed version of \\"MOONRAKER\\" on VHS. It was excellent. It almost looked as good as the DVD. \\"Well done, James.\\"
B000002HRE|4.0|I enjoyed Reload, but the fast and hard songs mainly. I love that Metallica is spreading their creative wings, but some of  their songs are very &quot;pop&quot;. If u love their older stuff don't be surprised if you are disappointed. If you are not that familiar with Metallica or not a metal/hard rock fan, you will love this CD. Reload is fun. Fuel, The Memory Remains, and Devil's Dance are great songs, hard hitting vintage Metallica. I still like this CD no matter what Metallica fans say to me. Oh yeah, I forgot to mention that I have become a Metallica fan just in the last 2 months. I love their music. PURE ROCK that really rocks. Metallica is now my favorite band. I am recently bought: Black, Load, S+M, and Reload, of course. I am can't wait to buy more!
B00004X0Q0|1.0|I have lost all respect for the writers of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; for hailing this album to be the saviour of rock music. This album offers nothing new or powerful.  Instead, you get a screaming fool with an afro, collapsing out on stage, trying to get your attention.  The sad thing is the audience falling for this childish act.  I saw them at the recent North X Northwest and was let down.  Take away the stupid on-stage antics and you have very average music played by guys pretending their sixteen and in a wannabe cool punk band.  The music industry is waiting for that one band that will take us into the future, clearly ATDI will only remind us of the past, not the future.
B000002LK1|4.0|This is one of my favorite CDs. This CD and &quot;Songs of Faith and Devotion&quot; are my 2 fav. DM albums. This is the CD that made me like Depeche Mode. Very creative and British techno sounding, but still a wonderful album.
1567407757|3.0|Mr. Albom's small book recounting his visits with his old friend, as the latter fades away from disease, is invariably insightful and affirming of what you know already to be true, and frequently tear-inducing as well.  What do you already know to be true that you are ignoring?  That the important things are not money or busy-ness.  The important things are love and appreciation of the world around us.  It's just that Albom's (and Morrie's)  prose is dull and artless.  It doesn't soar, it doesn't sing.  I wanted more from a book about a dying man's view of life.  And I definitely wanted something new to hear.  Well, this is a good book, and perhaps more people ought to read it, just as it is.  If you're undecided about buying the book vs. the tape version, here's a tip:  At the end of the tape, the producers have given us a generous sampling of excerpts from the tape recordings Albom made while with Morrie.  It's great to hear the old man say it in his own voice.
0800103661|3.0|Unlike many reviewers, I was disappointed in this film.  The film's central myth is the struggle of the individual human will against a Procrustean, deterministic society, which has been one of the most popular myths in Western literature for the past five thousand years.  To be successful, a treatment must add something to this myth.  Other than the wrinkle on genetic engineering, which is old hat in SF, Gattaca adds very little.<br />The film is stylish, to be sure.  This sometimes works and sometimes does not.  The idea that astronauts will wear business suits when strapped into acceleration couches strains credulity at best.  The acting is mostly competent but is directed to be so utterly flat in affect that one wonders why anybody in this future society would care about anything.  The exposition is constructed mostly of cliches and is predictable from beginning to end.  One of the cliches, a bone-clever gumshoe played wonderfully by Alan Arkin, provides a good contrast but seems entirely out of place--would such a society even permit people like this to occupy positions of authority?<br />Gattaca is a film that shows promise for a new director, but it doesn't quite make it.
6302820448|5.0|In a time when so many &quot;comedies&quot; are front loaded with their best material and then weakly trail off, this film is a good example of how a movie can start off hilariously then proceed to get funnier and funnier as it goes along! The supporting cast does a fine job, but this film is essentially a Bill Murray showcase. Watching his character Phil's various approaches to the bizarre Twilight Zone episode he finds himself in is not only funny but at times very insightful. After periods ranging from taking advantage of the situation to suicidal despair, Phil finally decides to start working on himself. When his diligent efforts at self improvement make him the toast of the town that he initially hated but has since come to love, the once unattainable goal of getting the girl of his dreams becomes virtually effortless. It's a rare film indeed that can be so highly entertaining while driving home such an important point. Bravo to Bill Murray and also to Harold Ramis for his excellent directing of a highly original film.
B00004W5UA|5.0|This is probably my number one favorite movie of all time.  I first seen it in theater (which made me love it even more).  Driving 75 miles to see it was truly worth it.  It has been a long time since a movie truly captured my brain and got to cover nearly every genre in movies today.  If you thought this movie was about a group of guys who just beat each other up....its not...sorry.  Although somewhat confusing near the end, it truly becomes confusing once it's over.  It really makes you think...and it's fun to come up with the theories of how the things came about.  I strongly suggest this movie to everyone....well, maybe not the easily offended, sick to the stomach type of people...but everyone else.  WATCH IT! BUY IT! PRAISE IT!
6302765536|3.0|Kevin boarding the wrong plane (hey, it could happen), Kevin and the burglars he busted last year in New York City at the same time (maybe a coincedince), a power outage every night before this family goes on vacation (tradition?), and Keven being 8 in the first movie and this movie takes place a year later and he's 10 (now that's unbelievable!).  Other than that this is still a pretty funny movie, especialy the part where those hotel clerks are after him and he makes them think there's a mobster in the room (&quot;Get down on your knees and tell me you love me!&quot;).  The boobi-trap ending was pretty much the same as the first, but unlike the first, most of the jokes in this one never get old!
B00000ICET|5.0|This is one of the best movies I have ever watched.  The special effects are cheesy and the acting isn't Oscar-calibre, but the writing and direction are both works of genius.  I loved the interaction between the characters as they succumbed to the sever cabin fever that one would expect from four men isolated in a small spaceship for twenty years.  Pinback, the janitor who was hooked onto the ship by accident just before launched, tries desperately to be the ship's cheerleader and model worker when with the crew, and privately deals with paranoid and low self-esteem after they ignore and rebuff him.  Boiler has become a bully in the boredom, antagonizing Pinback and destroying ship equipment.  Doolittle, thrust into the ship's command by the death of Captian Powell by equipment malfunction, leads the mission with complete lack-of-caring about it.  And Tably simply withdraws from the crew, preferring to spend years simply watching the stars.  The movie creates laughs many ways, from Pinback's slapstick fight with the alien 'mascot' and the elevator shaft, to the cerebral as Doolittle tries to convince Bomb 20 that it does not exist, to the extremely subtle as the crew has its 22,000th mealtime conversation.  I watch this movie at least once a year since I've bought the video, and each time it makes me laugh so hard I cry.  This has been one of my favorites, maybe my favorite, since I first saw it on TV about 18 years ago.  It's a must see.
B00004XONN|5.0|The thing about radiohead is that most people won't enjoy it the first time they hear it.  It's music that requires a deeper connection to yourself, rather than just a tune that you listen to two or three times and it makes you sick(like most music these days).  Listen to it and if you don't like it, listen to it again.  I think it will eventually come to you.  Good music often takes time to appreciate.
B00004XONN|4.0|On first listen, I concluded this album was a heap of atonal dung.  I kept the CD in my car stereo, though, because I couldn't quite shake it.  Five days (and about seven hundred miles) later, I love the CD.  I like OK Computer more, but I also like Abbey Road more than Rubber Soul.  Big deal.  They're all awesome. <br />&quot;Idioteque&quot;'s melodies absolutely stun me.  <br />And a message to all the pretentious twits who think they've figured out why people _think_ they like this album: Quit yer yappin'.  The &quot;Emperor Wears No Clothes&quot; argument is endlessly irritating, and is probably a favorite cop-out for detractors of something *you* love, (2001, Ulysses, Pet Sounds, etc...) Put down the cynicism, and walk slowly towards the door. Don't let it hit you on the rump on the way out.
B00004T40X|5.0|First of all, try to get the CD for 15.00 instead.  Ebay and dreamdisc is where I emailed to get the CD.  It has every song but Mary Lou, which is a really good song, but which I'm not upset about missing because the surrounding songs more than make up for the absence.  You can also get the cheaper CD off EBAY.<br />Now to the music:        This may very well be the best debut ever, in metal at least.  So many stong songs, with technical proficiencey and feeling in all instruments.  Keep in mind that All but the lead singer were 19 years old when this CD came out and your jaw will drop during Tracks 5, 10, and many others.  The singer is one of metal's best too.  He has a wonderful voice, and the accent adds nicely. There is much power in it and he has a heck of a range, and oh so much feeling in his words.  <br />  Start off with Black File and it will give you a sensation similar to plunging into the water escaping from the stresses around you.  The disc has an &quot;icey water feel&quot; to it for some of the songs, in how it refreshes you.  Kingdom For a Heart has a great intro guitar riff, and it's just fun.  Full Moon is the best song, and I guarrantee you'll find yourself screaming &quot;RUNAWAY RUNAWAY RUNAWAY!!&quot; during the chorus.  <br />  The only songs I don't like are Letter to Dana (way too depressing), and track 9, which just sounds like recycled bits from their other songs.<br />  Definitely get this CD, it has all the good aspects of power metal without the annoying repetitiveness.  This is the group to watch.  If these guys play that well at 19, I can't imagine what they'll be at 25.
B000002572|5.0|I WAS JUST BEGINNING TO LISTEN TO MUSIC WHEN THIS 1976 CLASSIC WAS RELEASED.  I REMEMBER HEARING IT ON THE RADIO AND A FEW YEARS LATER A FRIEND LET ME BORROW THIS ONE AND &quot;DON'T LOOK BACK&quot; AT THE LOCAL DRIVE IN &quot;MORE THAN A FEELING&quot;, &quot;PEACE OF MIND&quot; AND &quot;FOREPLAY/LONGTIME&quot; WERE STEADY QUARTER CONSUMERS ON THE JUKEBOX.  EVEN 24 YEARS LATER THE ALBUM STILL SOUNDS FRESH AND EXCITING.  ALBUM CUTS LIKE &quot;SMOKIN&quot; AND &quot;ROCK AND ROLL BAND&quot; STILL GET AIRPLAY ALONG WITH THE THREE HITS.  IF YOU LIKE BOSTON AND HAVEN'T PICKED UP THE 1980 ALBUM BY LEAD GUITARIST BARRY GOUDREAU (SELF TITLED) THEN YOU'RE MISSING OUT!  RECORDED WHILE THE BAND WAS HAVING TROUBLE WITH THEIR RECORD LABEL, FEATURES BRAD DELP ON VOCALS ALONG WITH FRAN COSMO WHO WOULD LATER END UP SINGING ON BOSTON ALBUMS.  SIB HASHIN SITS IN ON DRUMS, SO YOU HAVE THREE/FIFTHS OF BOSTON ON THIS MUST HAVE CD.  CLASSIC BOSTON VOCALS AND GUITARS WILL HAVE YOU CALLING THIS THE &quot;LOST BOSTON ALBUM&quot;  ENJOY!
B00004XMVH|4.0|Some things in this film are not credible, for example:<br />- How skillfully the American crew, few in number, manages so quickly to run that crippled, alien German submarine so well after they capture it;<br />- How doggedly (miraculously?) that poor sub survives the depth charging it endured crippling it before the Americans arrive, and the even more murderous ones by the German destroyer afterward;<br />-  How could such a battered boat survive a dive well beyond the maximum depth on its depth gauge?  (Best line in the film is from the Chief Petty Officer played by Keitel: &quot;Those Krauts sure know how to build a boat.&quot;) <br />-  Watertight doors seem never to be closed.  That's the first thing you do when you go to battle stations on a warship.<br />Nonetheless, a good, fairly gripping effort.  The sounds of the depth chargings are awesome on a good subwoofer system such as mine.  I have never been depth charged for real, though have read numerous descriptions in submarine literature and seen movies such as Das Boot.  Take away the occasionally intrusive music and this sound track must be close to what I imagine was the real thing.  Depth charging has been described as a huge awesome hammer.  That effect comes through - not only huge loud deafening metallic hammer blows but the deep boom of the explosions and the click of the trigger just before the charges go off.  Hats off to the people on all sides who endured that for real.<br />One last note:  it would have been better, and more diplomatic, for the note acknowledging that the British were first in capturing an enigma machine to have come at the beginning of the film rather than the end.  Also, a notation at the beginning that the film was a fictional dramatization of actual events would have been appropriate and more respectful to British and Americans alike.
0780631684|3.0|The latest entry into what seems to be a continual procession of horror flicks in the last year is Final Destination.  The plot revolves around a teen who sees a horrific vision of the plane he and his friends have just boarded, exploding in mid-air.  He awakens in a cold sweat and panics when the events in his dream begin to unfold just as he'd seen them in the vision.  It's an excellent and engaging start to a movie that unfortunately slowly deteriorates into what's more or less typical horror fare.<br /> Final Destination is all about shock-value and on that note, the movie delivers. One particularly disturbing scene caught everyone so much by surprise that it caused numerous vocal reactions and left our audience of mostly teens and twenty-something's giddy for the next several minutes. This scene will, no doubt, be the subject of many high school lunchroom conversations for the next month or so.  Similar incidents occur throughout keeping you enjoyably edgy and about as overly paranoid as our onscreen cast of characters.  It must be noted that there are some hideous scenes of gore and death, but this movie is far less heavy-handed with them than other movies in the genre such as Scream 3. <br /> Unfortunately, what starts off as a powerfully intense tale, gradually levels out into a movie full the usual irritants of idiotic behavior, gross inconsistencies, and silly plot lines so typical of horror.  If I see another person risk life and limb to save the family dog, I'm going to gag.  The movie goes from the seriousness of The Sixth Sense to the more or less tongue-in-cheek horror of I Know What You Did Last Summer, leaving me with mix emotions.    <br /> There can be little doubt, however, that Final Destination will make a lot of money and will be followed by numerous sequels in the coming years.   It is obviously designed to appeal to the less discriminating Generation X crowd, who will likely hail it as one of the greatest movies ever. More mature moviegoers,however, may find that it's pretty much a finely tuned re-hash of what already been done.  Nevertheless, if you want to see a movie for the sake of sheer shock value, I suggest you see this one.  You won't be disappointed. <br />Jeter
B000009RC2|5.0|How can anyone do with out this groundbreaking, fusion classic. &quot;Meeting Of The Spirits&quot;, and &quot;The Dance Of Maya&quot;, being highlights, this album is downright inspirational from start to finish. The fact that it is Digitally Remastered is another great asset. Billy Cobham's drums are more enhanced, and the recording sounds more balanced than the original mix. <br />Check it out!
B000002JSN|5.0|Led Zeppelin is all about creativity, new sounds, pushing the limits of music as we know it.  No album better displays their ability to break boundaries more than Physical Graffiti.  As a long time Led Head, I have always been attracted to the experimental pieces, as opposed to the singles that were written to sell the album.  Kashmir is the most amazing piece of music ever composed.  And it is a piece, not a song, and it was composed, not written.  There had never been anything remotley similar, and to this day there never has been.  It is the best piece of music I have ever set ears on.  If you buy this album, and for some incredibly strange reason you don't like any of the songs, it will still be worth the 25 bucks you drop simply because of Kashmir.  Buy it now! Now! Now!  Don't go another second without hearing this piece of music genius!  I can't describe it.  The words I would use would do no justice to the sheer beauty of this music.  You have to hear it for yourself!
B00004XQP4|4.0|Green Day are an awesome band, and I love them, but this CD is different.  Its the second best.  Its turned a little popish, but I still recomend getting it.  The video for, &quot;Minority&quot; is the BEST! It was taped her in my(and Blink182's) hometown, San Diego.  Well, Downtown SD.  If you don't have it, get it even though its popish.
B000003BDJ|5.0|Hot Rocks pulls together the classic Stones songs from the 60's and what more really needs to be said about them.  The album is a virtual history lesson of the band. &quot;Satisfaction&quot;, &quot;Jumping Jack Flash&quot;, &quot;Sympathy For The Devil&quot; and all the others have become more than just songs, they have become part of music lore.  Hot Rocks is a must for any fan of the band and a great place to start for those who aren't familiar with their music
B00004UFYU|4.0|When I was walking past a CD store and heard this otherwordly music playing I quickly went inside and bought the album, and have found it hard to put down since. The album was of course ERA. Only yesterday I found ERA 2 in the same store and, without hesitation, bought it. After listening this new album I was very impressed! ERA has managed to maintain an original album, while keeping within the style with the first. While I still prefer the first album, I recommend this the latest from ERA! A must for everyone!!
B00004OCRN|5.0|Chimes Of Freedom was originally released from Bruce's Amnesty International shows (the last time he played with the E Street Band prior to the 99-00 reunion tour) with the proceeds going to that cause.  The tour took place after his Tunnel of Love tour and you get two songs that were prominently featured in those shows, &quot;Tougher Than The Rest&quot; and &quot;Be True&quot;.  The latter song was originally released as a B-side to the River release &quot;Fade Away&quot; and is a great song.  The title track was played specifically for the tour and is an old Dylan song, but Bruce's version is taken from the Byrds rendition of the song.  Springsteen has always sang about the underdog and this song perfectly captures the spirit of what Amnesty is all about.  The disk closes with an intense acoustic version of &quot;Born To Run&quot;.  In it's original form, you can get lost in the big production of the song, but in this version it's stripped down to its core which is all about desperation and restlessness.  Chimes is an interesting document from an era in Bruce's career that doesn't get alot of attention, but considering what it was all about, maybe it should get more.
B000002E5J|5.0|Ese CD es de una frescura inmensa, tiene letras que no son muy escuchadas con una voz nueva y musca que es comercial hasta sierto puento pero con exceso de guitrras lo cual logra formar un CD que es de colecin. Shakira demuestra que a ella lo que le gusta es cantar y no andarse con poses aunque aveces asi lo paresca, me gustaria pensar que ella comone las letras mas ingenuas que lo que estan el el disco y Luis Ochoa les da una picelada para hacerlas rentables. Como disco fresco dentro de este mundo comercial es de lo mejor que hay.
B00000APLB|4.0|Anytime you have an album that contains &quot;Sympathy For The Devil&quot;, &quot;Tumbling Dice&quot;, &quot;You Can't Always Get What You Want&quot; &amp; &quot;Jumping Jack Flash&quot;, it can't be all that bad.  While this album isn't in the league of Get Yer Ya-Ya's out, it is still a good live record.  You get a nice selection from their mid 70's work in addition to the classic hits and the cover songs from the El Mocambo shows are a nice bonus in addition to the more familiar songs.  The two discs for the price of one make it more than worth your while to pick this one up.
B00003CXE7|5.0|Gladiator is one of the greatest movies I have ever seen in a very long time. It is the kind of movie you don't expect it to be soossoso good, but when you finally are watching it you experience every emotion there is for you to experience in a movie(tension, sadness, happiness and fear). Although it does contain some bloody and intense scenes of war, it gives a message of life that is too special to miss it. How love can conquer all and remain in ones mind forever. Gladiator is a movie that, especially in my experience, the viewer feels like it's living the story. Russell Crowe does a fanstastic job in this movie and well deserves the Best Actor Oscar. I hope Gladiator wins the Best Movie!!! HIGHLY recommended
B000002572|5.0|On my life-long quest for the greatest rock and roll album of all time, I would have to say this is the one! Every song is a great, sing-a-long classic. When I heard side one, it was the only thing I could listen to for a week, side two was just as good. &quot;Boston&quot; is the greatest debut ever, and the best album of all time. I gotta go buy the CD intead of my old record.
B00004XONN|2.0|OK Computer and The Bends were great, Pablo Honey was annoying, and this album falls somewhere in between.  I realize that bands need to progress artistically but I just can't see Kid A as progress.  (People in other reviews will probably point out that I &quot;just don't get it&quot;)  Well, they're right, I don't get this album. I don't understand why they chose to replace instruments with sound effects.  There are almost no guitar or drum parts. Instead the songs consist of beeping and organ-type sounds.  The whole album has a very bare and minimalistic feel to it.<br />I do like the hip-hop beat on Track 8, Idiotheque, but that's really the only song I enjoy listening to. I apologize to those high-browed, pretentious reviewers that scorn people for daring to criticize this album, but I just don't get Kid A.  Maybe they can explain it to me.

B00004T9UF|5.0|I bought this Cd because I thought &quot;The Real Slim Shady&quot; was a awesome song on MTV's TRL so the first week it was out I bought it I took it home and listened to it from track 1 to track 16 and I couldn't believe my ears it was great. If you are buying this CD for the song &quot;The Real Slim Shady&quot; then you're going to get a lot more out of it than that trust me every single song is as good or better than &quot;The Real Slim Shady&quot; actually &quot;The Real Slim Shady&quot; was one of the bad tracks on the CD. If you listen to this CD straight through it has a story in fact it is pretty hilarious. I hope you enjoy this CD as much as I did thanks for reading my review!!!!!!

B00003OST8|5.0|What can be said when everything else has been said already about this most glorious example of the Golden Age of Hollywood.  The gods smiled upon this one.   There is not a flaw in the entire 1938 film or any of its elements.  Since they struck a new printing a few years ago, like many others, I have been holding off on buying a VHS home version for that DVD to come out.  <br /> The distributors continue to put out meaningless junk while this one languishes in the can.   Most of us will play this marvelous film whenever we feel the need of a mood pickup.  This is like a glass of cold lemonade on a hot summer day, or a warm hearth in the midst of a frozen winter.   It is an oasis for the soul.  <br /> One can see the wonderful storyboard behind the scenes, and the N.C. Wyeth inspired sets and characters in every minute of this magic film.  It is beloved by all, throughout the world, A Joy Forever, as brilliant in this new Century as it was all throughout a large part of the last.  Thank you Errol Flynn, Olivia deHaviland, Michael Curtiz, Erich Wolfgang Korngold and all the rest of you wonderful people, wherever you are.
0767817478|5.0|I love character driven art-house fare.The kind of films that you will only find in select theaters,and with absolutely zero advertising.You have to be lucky to realize it has even been realeased(eg:Croupier(amazing film)).But,a film such as Godzilla 98 delivers the goods when it comes to big budget hollywood extravaganzas.I,unlike most reviewers actually somewhat identified with Mr G's actions.He found himself in  an extremely hostile environment(NYC),which is a fairly accurate portrayal.He only attacked when provoked,and only in self defense,or for revenge.All he wanted was a family,but he soon discovers that family values are not exactly something that's cherished in the big apple,and an all out assault is spearheaded by our fine military to eradicate this aspiring patriarch.Although sfx are always improving,the fx in this film are still cutting edge,a vast improvement over the dinos in the jurassic park films.Godzilla's movements are logical,and there is great detail in his skin and musclature.A standout out scene,one of my favorites of all time,is when he scales a building and lets out a piercing primal scream.A scream that conveys frustration,fear,confusion,and above all,as anyone who has ever lived in NYC can attest,loneliness.The characters admittedly take a back seat to the action,but that doesn't mean there aren't any amusing performances.I liked Broderick in the lead role as a lovesick scientist who has a respect and a childlike fascination with the big G.Maria Pitillo as his ex-girlfriend from college,who is now an ambitious but naive reporter,is somewhat annoying,but there relationship,dare i say it,is adorable.Hank Azaria has some funny lines as a fearless cameraman,as does Jean Reno,who plays a Government official working for the french government to eradicate Zilla.What truly puts the finishing touches on this film is the sound.It's the most powerful and effective use of DD5.1 to date(Starship Troopers and Batman Forever are other great examples).From the room trembling footfalls(you'll need a decent subwoofer),to the first helicopter chase scene through manhattan,your sound system will be pushed to the limit.The image quality is absolutely immaculate,with no artifacts or distortions evident.The colors are bright and vivid.This is an example of what dvd is all about,and what DD5.1 or DTS was meant to be.The sound channels are seperated masterfully,and each speaker is utilized at just the right moment depending on the onscreen action.The extras are abundant,too.Three teaser trailers(one that pokes fun at Jurassic Park(very funny)),2 Toho Godzilla trailers,a featurrette that doesn't take itself seriously(kind of pokes fun at Godzilla),a very informative commentary by the SFX supervisor and the associate visual effects supervisor(a serious amount of work went into this film,they should have won some awards for their efforts),and an entertaining video by the Wallflowers(and i'm not even a fan of theirs)called Hero.I'm not proclaiming this film to be a classic,but it is one of my personal favorites,and regardless of how many times i have seen it,i just keep coming back for more.Honestly,i was depressed at what happens at the end.I actually felt for the big guy,his intentions weren't at all malicious.
B00004XONN|4.0|Just as the bends ended with street spirit leading into ok computer, ok computer ends with the tourist and a bell, leading into Kid A.  things are different, the sounds has changed, may it be the future?  what will the sequel to kid a have in store for us?  nevertheless, this is a fine album.   i will now try to implement a new rating system, follow my lead.<br />1- everything in its right place: 70 (out of 100) i really liked this song the first few times i heard it, but now its a tad annoying.  i still enjoy listening.<br />2- Kid A: 90    I really like this.  many people hate it the most but i enjoy the piano work and the strings near the end, should be considered an instrumental, vocals are too hard to hear.  excellent, excellent, excellent.<br />3- The National Anthem: 72   Could be better, brass seems out of place.  but still a nice song, i enjoy it.  <br />4- How to disappear completely.  95    One reviewer once said they hated this song most on the album.  it is hard to understand why.  it is very &quot;exit music&quot;-esque (which would score a 97)  BY FAR THE BEST SONG ON THIS ALBUM, HTDC rules.  excellent, powerful, and you actually get to hear thom's voice.  goes well with idioteque.  (this isnt happening; this is really happening)<br />5- Treefingers: 80   Nice instrumental, calming.  chill music.  <br />6- Optimistic:  65   This is their first single and everyone loves it, but i dont think its that great.  some may love it, i think its alright.  <br />7- In Limbo:   50   i like the beat and the sound, but i miss the point.  <br />8- Idioteque:  85   Great beat, catchy lyrics, good.<br />9- Morning Bell:  87  Great vocals, by far the most catchy song, would be an excellent single.  <br />10- Motion picture soundtrack: 89   Another &quot;exit music&quot;-esque song.  maybe just the title...  great a tad strange, i like the background chanting vocals.  in the end a satisfactory end.<br />This is a fantastic follow up ... (...) but i dont think people notinto radiohead would like it at all.  if you like ok computer, spend [the money] and buy this, give it a shot, but you might hate it... whatever.  enjoy.  (... .)
0553278398|4.0|I read the first robot book and was just a little disappointed. But I have enjoyed this book a great deal. It is a thinkers book as it is very short on action.<br />    The ideas are interesting and different from many books I have read. The only real complaint I have is some of the characters are a little two dimensional, I find that with many of his books.<br />    But it is his ideas and concepts that draw me to reading his books rather than his characters. My only other complaint it is seems a little long and could probobly have been done a little shorter.<br />   However it is still a great read and very interesting.
0553573403|5.0|I think perhaps the best way I can sum up A Game of Thrones, and in fact the Song of Fire and Ice series so far, is that it's so REAL compared to others in the genre.<br />1. Not everyone is all good or all bad. Of course, some are &quot;more good&quot; than others, but even they have faults and reasons to question allying with them.<br />2. You don't know whom to trust. So many agendas are on the table that even those you think you know will surprise you.<br />3. Characters interact with each other differently on different occasions.  There are no &quot;char X = sweet and humble; char Y = evil and harsh&quot; constants throughout the story.  People are complex and varied, with different motivations on different days.<br />4. People make mistakes, and suffer the consequences. No one is safe here, and people don't always learn from their pasts, or even their own advice.<br />5. People die. Main characters die. Again, no one is safe.<br />Martin creates an enormous melee where both the prizes and weapons are power, loyalty, love, honor, and life.  He provides us with the god's eye view of it all and allows us to see through the different character's eyes...although what we see is distorted by what the character _believes_ is taking place at a given moment.  Due to jumps in time and space from character to character, we may or may not know the truth of the facts presented.  Sound confusing?  It is, sometimes.  But the effect is breathtaking...to truly be immersed in this world and to not know what will happen next, to try to figure out who should win, and who in fact will win, to try to reconcile the losses...to this is what fiction should be.
B000002U9E|5.0|Well, as i said, this is my life time favourite album. I was 14/15 years old when i first aquired this album, as a christmas present from my mum, who knew i was a fan, (as she herself was in the early years). Waking the witch and Under Ice remain my favourite tracks, but all of the tracks on the album bring back memories of winter dark nights. I am now 29 years old, and Kate Bush is still my favourite artiste, but this album is tops! (p.s. Sensual World is 2nd!)
B000002TPS|5.0|Looking back at Megadeth's history book, clear is their musicianship, talent and above all their constant maturity and improvements.The band hit the top when they recorded Countdown to Extinction and then.....they stormed over the top with Youthanasia. The album features a more mature sound/riffing/solos from the band. The songs are shorter than those in Rust in peace (which is Megadeth favourite album by fans) but each song in Youthanasia is as heavy as those in Rust....The solos are more melodic here and the techniques used in riffing and solos is more complex and melodic(again!). The album opens with the wicked 'Reckoning day' which has a cool 'acoustic-like' solo. then comes the 'Train of consequences &amp; Addicted to chaos'. what comes next is one of Megadeth's finest and most sincere moments....A tout le monde is a classic, with all the meanings that classic holds. the lyrics in this song are beautiful. The intro is one of my favourites and the bridge/chorus are among the best you can ever hear. Also on this album, there's the haunting 'Family tree' with its neat bass riff. The song 'Youthanasia' is also an excellent song advancing from the slow doomy-like riff to the typical Megadeth thrash riff. Then to add a magnificent final touch to the album, 'I thought I knew it all' comes to play. Everything in this song is perfect. The lyrics will haunt you for a long time. The riff will echo in your ears and the solo will complete this classic (too!)...The production on this album (like Countdown to extinction) is crisp and the sound is crystal-clear. All in all this album truley a masterpiece. I am not just writing down an opinion here just so you know that I'm a big fan of Megadeth, but good music should be appreciated anywhere and this album is surely one of music's finest hours, one of metal's greatest offerings and one of Megadeth's best albums...ever. It's an album to enjoy,keep and treasure...and that's a fact. Thank you.
0140135154|5.0|I purchased this book for a class I was taking in Visual Media and I have to say it's been one of the most enjoyable books I've read in college. It's short and John Berger speaks what I believe to be very true.  We watched the accompanying shows in which Berger pretty much says what he says in this book (to better exemplify things).  However you don't need to see those to understand this book.  Berger dispels the myth's behind advertising in European / Western culture... that's what I got out of it.
B00004U9MS|4.0|It seems unfair in my opinion, the labelling that has been placed on Coldplay as contender as the next Radiohead. This comes after the same treatment being handed out in liberal doses to such brilliant and individualistic Brit Bands as Muse, Travis, Doves and Badly Drawn Boy. Radiohead seems to be the buzz word for tagging any British export and after hearing Kid A I find this highly unjust. Coldplay do seem to have connections to Travis, as in the fact that the band appear to do nothing special while the front man writes potent songs and provides haunting and crisp tones to this bland background. Chris Martin taking the place of Fran Healy in this case. That judgement is true of Martin's fantastic vocal abilities (although he does seem to strain and add unnecessary high inflexions in songs such as &quot;Yellow&quot;). But the band of Guy Berryman, Jon Buckland and Will Champion provide  delicate and melodic background to Martin's soft but yet strong voice. This is highly evident from the start with the ambient opener &quot;Don't Panic&quot; to the acoustic strumming and harmonies of &quot;Shiver&quot;. Elements from other bands can certainly be found in this strong title but Coldplay have set out a strong stand in the market and thoroughly deserve it. If you hate angst rock and all that comes with it though, stay well well clear. This is well worthy of its Mercury Prize nomination and proves that the Parlophone symbol is one of greatness. If you do not want to buy without hearing it, listen to Yellow which is by far the best track on a very solid album.
B000002KGT|5.0|Well I think its about time that Rumours is Digitally Remastered  we have all waited long enough so comon Warner Bros records get your act into gear and digitally remaster this classic CD.<br />Meatloaf's Bat Out Of Hell album released the same year another classic of its time, and its out now remastered, so now its time for Rumours to be done....and also the other mac albums as well.

B000002JAX|4.0|I heard a track from this CD on our local pop station and thought,&quot;Wow! So Billie really CAN sing?&quot; (My appologies to all you BH fans, but the lady was the first to admit she wasn't a singer.) Ms. Peyroux really delivers the technique and style, and I had to have her album. I'm looking forward to any upcoming CDs she may put out, though, using her own personal vocal style.  If you like Billie Holliday, you'll love this CD. But watch out world if Ms. Peyroux decides to make a name of her own!

B00004YM0D|4.0|In the early 80's The Big Chill soundtrack took a number of twenty year old Motown hits, added a taste of white pop and produced a huge selling soundtrack.<br />&quot;Titans&quot; appears to try to copy that formula, albeit with somewhat less success. The probable reason for this is that so many of these songs have been released in other anthologies before, and there is little on the CD that a 70's pop fan won't already have several copies of. (Has any song ever appeared on as many compilations as Greenbaum's &quot;Spirit In The Sky&quot;?)<br />The scattershot approach (Buck Owens and Tina Turner? ) does guarantee something for everyone, but not everything for anyone. Fortunately, I can recommend several other various artist albums to meet your desires.<br />If you are into the pop sounds of Greenbaum, the Hollies or Steam, I recommend you check out any of the Rhino records series &quot;Super Hits of the 70's&quot;. If Marvin Gaye, Tina Turner or Charles Wright are your thing, check the &quot;Didn't It Blow Your Mind&quot; series. Both series have several volumes that chronologically cover the 1970's, priced about $12 apiece, and you can pick and choose the ones you want.<br />Also highly recommended, the AlmostFamous soundtrack. Not as 'pop'py as the Titans, but certainly as enjoyable.
B000002TQV|5.0|This is the best CD I own.  It helped me get through some difficult times.
B000002KET|4.0|A transitional album; a departure from the first four Sabbath albums. It seems that, after their initial sound reached their peak in their fantastic fourth album, 'Volume 4', they started seeking new ways to express themselves. Here, we see the first steps towards a new sonic direction, a direction that later brought some very interesting releases (the majestic Sabotage being one of them). I am not sure why this CD is considered by many a 'Sabbath trademark'. This is clearly not the most representative sample of the 'traditional' Sabbath music, but rather a deviation, an experimental CD, with heavy doses of keyboards, done by Rick Wakeman. You cannot tell though who plays the keyboards, as Rick's mastery (amptly displayed in 'The Six Wives of Henry VIII') is not present here. The only song that is somehow enhanced by the use of keyboards is 'Sabbra Cadabra'. 'Who Are You' is, of course, totally synth based, but, other than a strong instrumental chorus, it does not have much to offer. Overall, SBS, is not nearly as sinister as the front cover wants us to believe (I thought that a 'landscape' cover or something like that would have been more appropriate), and contains some very quiet music, alongside some heavy stuff. The only song that reflects the past is 'Killing Yourself To Live' (it could have been part of Vol 4). 'Fluff', an exquisite instrumental, also reminds of 'Laguna Sunrise'. 'A National Acrobat' is 'side one's' stronger moment. It blends a folk melody with some very heavy stuff with originality. Another interesting song is 'Looking for Today', simple hard rock served with a strong dose of melancholy. It could have been shorter, though, and less repetitive. These are good songs, but I think the real masterpiece of SBS is 'Spiral Architect', one of Sabbath's finest moments ever. It starts with a long beautiful acoustic introduction, and develops into a powerful and majestic composition. A sign of things (and sounds) to come in Sabotage and subsequent albums. If you are a Sabbath fan, chances are that you already own this album. If you are not, this may not be the best place to begin. Not that it is a bad album, but it takes a while to click into it.
B00004WKII|5.0|This set is, of course, beautifully packaged.  Booklet, box, and CDs are all strikingly decorated.  But who cares if the music is no good?  Fortunately, it is.  Although I do think some of the complaints are warranted, with the alternate versions sounding nearly identical to the album versions we are familiar with.  I was hoping for some really alternate versions, maybe done solo acoustic or in a much different form.  It seems that maybe 4 discs is being a little generous for this package, but since it's  Jimi, it's okay.  Some other complaints are that some of discs clock in at under an hour.  I, for one, don't mind.  I think some  of the compilations that are being made lately that each disc is nearly 80 minutes long are a little excessive and difficult to sit through.  Maybe I'm the only one that thinks that.  But this is still a 5 star set because everything here is excellent.
B000007T1M|5.0|This cd is crazy rock at its best.The lylrics are original,meaningful and at times funny.The instruments on the cd come together to make an awesome blend of sounds.This cd is what rock is all about freedom of speech an rebellion!!!
B000001Y42|5.0|This CD was before the release of the sell-out &quot;Significant Other&quot; with about 3 or 4 good songs on it. But I liked this stuff a lot better. I just got it recently and man, it's nothin like their second. &quot;Pollution&quot;, &quot;Counterfiet&quot;, &quot;Stuck&quot;, and &quot;Sour&quot; are all tyt tracks right down to the famous &quot;Faith&quot; that was one of my favorites. And now with the release of &quot;Chocolate Starfish and the Hotdog Flavored water&quot;, Limp Bizkit is gonna come back with the good stuff they had on this album.

B00004XONN|5.0|Creating an aural vista of strange and beautiful complexity, Kid transports you to a surreal, extraterrestrial world where Radiohead continue to show us how close they think we are to total annhilation. As a follow-up to OK Computer (arguably one of the most important album releases of the nineties), Kid A continues the dark, almost apocalyptic theme of OK Computer, but creates the setting in hypnotic, almost trance-like soundscapes, ala Brian Eno and Harold Budries. Gone is the insistance and immediacy of heavy guitar riffs as familiar methods of conjuring strong emotion. In Kid A, tension is created and maintained by more subtle methods. Many-layered keyboard tracks, coupled with an almost impossible number of different guitar sounds supply the foundation for the soulful, keening wail of Thom York. After listening to the recording all the way through for the first time, you are confused, disoriented, and probably more than a little amazed. Its only after several listens that you realize that Radiohead just may be showing us another direction the rock and roll of the furure may be headed towards.
B00004XONN|5.0|With all the new music I write and listen to, I always try to have objective ears and try to hear and play the music through my own associations and world experiences, etc....It is my feeling that Radiohead dug deep within themselves on Kid A. I think they wanted to do a completely unconvetional album that they themselves could get lost while writing it and playing it. That's what happens to the listener if he or she could get &quot;lost&quot; in the album. Radiohead continues to defy the limits of where music can go. Its a very ambient futuristic album with addictive fantasy drones and soundscapes of science fiction. Please take a seat before you listen to this masterpiece of sound and self-exploration...

B00004XONN|5.0|I just got through about 25 reviews for Kid A from &quot;so called&quot; Radiohead fans - you know who you are and you're sick in the head!<br />I will admit that I too was a little confused when I first listened to the album, not everything sounded the way I thought it would.  But, I've listened to it over 30 times now and I realize that it's a natural progression for a band that doesn't subscribe to the boundaries that these &quot;fans&quot; have obviously placed on them. Radiohead is about looking within themselves for their own creative vision and sound - this album is that extention.  Let's face it, innovators and pioneers in music don't sound like their last album.  The mates in Radiohead are innovators.  If you want the same old sound go buy Creed, Stone Temple Pilots or any other band that keeps pumping out albums to make a paycheck.  <br />To those who haven't bought Radiohead Kid A yet:  Do yourself a favor, buy it and make up you're own mind - and hey, if you hate it, go sell it on eBay.

B000006TRV|5.0|Even taking into account a few moments of 'incoherence,' The Wall definitely qualifies as a masterpiece of not only its genre, but recorded albums in general.  The 'incoherence'- is this really a flaw, or is it essential to the story?  A magnificent job is done of really taking listeners into the mind of the tortured soul.  That there are pieces that stand alone as great only adds to the brilliance of this album.  I don't know what to say to anyone who doesn't &quot;get&quot; it, except that I appreciate The Wall a hell of a lot more than I did when I was a teenager.
0684853523|5.0|If you are looking for a typical King terrorfest, don't look here!  This is a wonderful book; using his trademark plain, sometimes crude language, King has written a fine novel about what it takes to become a competent, perhaps even good writer.  The book starts out with a brief narrative of his life, including a gem of a story about an overweight babysitter who would sit on his head and fart (Pow!).  You can definitely see, even through this very short, abridged version, where he got his horror jones.  The middle of the book contains lessons on what you REALLY need to know about writing a book that will keep a reader's attention. It concludes with King's near-fatal accident in which he was struck by a van, shattering his leg, among other injuries.  During his long convalescence, King is quick to point out that &quot;writing did not save my life...but it has continued to do what it has always done: it makes my life a brighter and more pleasant place.&quot;  And that is the main point of this book:  if you're not writing because it is something you love to do, then you probably shouldn't be doing it.
B00004XONN|3.0|Simply put Radiohead have reached the status of  &quot;greatest band in the world&quot; - but quite like Curt Cobain was, it seems that Mr. Yorke is never happy with anything he does.  This is the never dying fascination for me with this group - they seem to hate the system completely but will do anything and everything to please it (interviews, videos, documentarys, touring, etc.). I think Yorke just can't stand to see himself as a good or service for the international gobal economy. This recording is an obvious act of self loathing - and though it has some brilliant bits, that this comes from a band that can make such a huge, beautiful noise, and with the most interesting singer vocally and lyrically alive... well, it has to be considered a miss. Best band in the world, yes - would die to see them live again, yes. Would tell someone to buy this record? NO - and you have to believe somewhere that is the point. It is anti-commerce -  which is beautiful in its own way. For the hardcore fan only, or not.
B00001ZWTS|1.0|Let's play guess the movie. I will describe a film and you guess it. Here goes. Somebody at Warner Bros. adapts an idea for a screenplay from god knows where, which involves 2 guys who has trouble getting along. One of them is portrayed by superstar Will Smith, the other, a familiar  caucasian.  The film has a lot of  special FX, corny jokes, ugly people, nifty looking vehicles and Will holding a gun. In the end these two have to put aside squabbling and fight against giant bug-like thing which stands on more than two legs. After that Will does his lil' rap when the credits come up. <br />What is the movie? Men In Black : The Prequel. Wild Wild West has nothing to offer except a head ache, a way of waste money and time. Will Smith disappointed us after he made people laugh with his show, charmed his fans in ID4, and had been a credible action hero in Bad Boys and Enemy of the State. Now he's in this appalling film that I keep wondering how could people waste money making this garbage.<br /> If you're a fan of &quot;Gangsta' rap&quot; and manage to see this nonsense, buy Eminem's, Dmx's and Dr. Dre's album and play it all night with loud speakers at high volume. Because if Will considers G. rap whack and choose to be a part of this, then it is best that kids of the world get a hold of the grimiest rap albums and see the nastiest movies with the most foul language around. The cast is totally wrong,  Kenneth Branaugh is a good actor but annoying villain. Selma Hayek's worst performance ever(sorry Selma).Kline puts more wit to the Gordon character but made him look like a sissy. <br />The screenplay is dumb and the 80 foot tarantula is just a distraction from that truth. Plus, Will makes a dreadful cowboy and the single &quot;Wild Wild West\\" is a travesty unlike his &quot;Men In Black&quot; song. I was willing to see a Men In Black 2 but now I'm not sure Will and director Barry Sonnenfeld has it anymore.
B00004XONN|4.0|With OK Computer, Radiohead took the genre it had settled into and created the best possible album they could think of for it.  Unable to really top themselves in the same arena, they decided to take a different path with Kid A: music without a genre altogether.  This, Kid A's greatest strength, is also its greatest weakness: Although obviously very well-crafted and thought through, it is, in the end, undefinable.  After listening to it, I couldn't deny its quality, but I couldn't categorize it in any way.  So the only thing it's lacking in the end is a sort of unifying musical theme that holds it together.  As for its lyrical and philosophical theme, I found that wasn't hard to find, at least in my interpretation; I'll leave you to yours.  To sum up, Radiohead is a beautiful, revolutionary, fascinating, but in the end, directionless album.  Definitely something you should pick up.
630575067X|4.0|The Phantom Menace, one of the most controversial, criticized and anticipated movie of all time. it's impossible for any filmmaker to recreat the success of his first movie, but despite some mediocre momments, George and his crew manage to make a pretty, good movie. Episode I is just as entertaining as the original, but the cast doesn't have that witty, chemistry that Luke and Co. had.<br /> However, the Duel of the fates fight scene with Darth Maul is excellent but interrupted by that Jar Jar. The podrace made Star wars haters show respect for the films. the sets, costumes,landscapes are beautiful. John Williams put alot of energy into the score. The story isn't that bad, needs more work on character developement though. For now I'd Accept the childish vibe that it has but i'd expect that ep 2 would be as mature as Anakin at 20. Since I'm a caribbean, Jar Jar was a bit offensive, but George won points with Sam Jackson as a Jedi and Capt.Panaka. Darth Maul, good villain but has nothing prove that he can be a match for Vader, except in a Duel. Qui-Gon is also a good character but has better cemistry with Watto than Obi-Wan. Obi-Wan doesn't mingle much with the rest of the cast or leaves Qui-Gon's shadow until the end.<br />I've been a fan since birth and I'm not very disappointed with this film. Yes, it could have been better, but after Matrix, It had some of the best Special FX than any other movie since Titanic so forget about Hollow Man! Still I wouldn't expect everyone to feel the same way about Menace.<br />This is a note 4 critics that dissed the podrace, for years movies has copied Star wars(ID4, wing commander, etc.) so what if the race reminds you of Ben Hur. The film did what it had to do- kick off The Saga and it did it! George, good luck wit' EP2!!!!!
B00004XQP4|4.0|Green Day has done it. They've released a cd that is still true to the punk scene, sure they're not as brash as Rancid, but they prove they can hang with the best. Upon first listening, I head several songs that can be heard on the alternative radio stations. So the media shouldn't be afraid to play them. Check out the title track, &amp; &quot;Blood, Sex And Booze&quot;, the first two tracks. This is good stuff.
B00004XONN|5.0|This is a breakthrough effort for Radiohead...I own all of their albums and I must say that this one has engaged me the most.  From the ambient/classical tunes to the hidden lyrics sheet (I was one of the lucky 75,000 to get one) this album has kept me busy.  Truly, only REAL Radiohead fans will appreciate this album...nothing is made for radio and nothing is done to appease...a truly fantastic effort!
B000001FOS|4.0|Probably not as indespensible as _Rising Force_ (a creative, excellent album) as it is very uneven,  but has some great moments.  Joe Lynn Turner is on vocals this time around, and the music definitely has a very glammy, 80's-era Rainbow feel to it, culminating with the ultra-cheezy hit &quot;Heaven Tonight&quot;.   But there is some amazing stuff on this album once you dig into it.  &quot;Hold On&quot; is a great piece and showcases the good that JLT can do for this incarnation of  Yngwie's band.  There's also good to be had with &quot;Bite The Bullet/Riot In The Dungeons&quot; and &quot;Krakatau&quot;, both of which are in the vein of Yngwie's earlier compositions.  But &quot;Dreaming (Tell Me)&quot; is the rather early climax, a dreamy, acoustic-tinged piece with an absolutely crushing solo at the end.  Its probably Yngwie's finest moment on any of his albums, and the reason this is a four-star review and not 2-1/2.
B00004XONN|2.0|I really hope my review gets posted high enough to help somebody decide. If you are Radiohead fan like me you don't need advise. You bought it and you'll die with it. But this is not the Radiohead album you want to start off with. Some &quot;truer fans&quot; than I will praise KA for the following months, but even they wouldn't be able to admit that this album is going to turn you into a fan. You need to go back to The Bends in order to do that. After you fall in love with TB and Pablo Honey, you pick up OK Computer and you will see a band that is evolving with tremendous skill. By then, you might risk the 13 bucks and buy Kid A with no remorse, telling yourself that &quot;it's just part of my awesome Radiohead collection&quot;. But you should buy the &quot;My Iron Lung&quot; and &quot;Itch&quot; EPs before that! The album starts on song number 4 (or maybe 5). By now you have listened to odd noises, sampling tracks and what could be Ed and Colin dozing off in the recording booth. And after that, the songs don't pack the punch that their previous recordings boasted. In other words, these &quot;songs&quot; are not meant for playing in large venues. Riots may break out. To sum up, the album is not worth it for the new listener. Only addicted fans like me should have the privilege of making what some people call a mistake.
B000002J6H|5.0|From vinyl to cassette to CD, I have owned this album for nearly 30 years, and it still stands up as one of the best ever made. In addition to songs that became classic, such as Love The One Your With, there are numerous soulful gems such as Do Unto Others and the monumental We Are Not Helpless. Wonderful songwriting. Stills has fun with the cajun-inspired  Black Queen, and shows tremendouse arranging ability with the sophisticated Cherokee. All of the top musicians and singers from the early 70's L.A. scene lend their talents throughout the album.There are very few perfect pieces of work out there, but Stephen Stills scored big time on this one.
B00003OST8|5.0|The tale of Robin Hood has always been a guilty pleasure for me since pre-adolescence.  I have read various versions as well as viewed several different film adaptations.  As far as film goes, I'll state my preference for the 1938 version starring Erroll Flynn and Olivia de Havilland.  The Adventures of Robin Hood is a cinematic classic.  You can keep the Costner version and let me have this one.  Erroll Flynn is a dashing hero who inspires the people to rebel against the evil Prince John.  Olivia de Havilland is a lovely Maid Marian.  I also like the casting of Alan Hale as Little John. I'm young enough that my first exposure to Hale was as the Skipper on Gilligan's Island.  It was amusing to see him as a younger, thinner man.  These subjects are loyal to King Richard who is away at war.  The story of Robin Hood is well known so I'll take a moment to discuss the spectacular film quality.  This colorful film is beautifully shot.  I can remember numerous times being impressed with the sheer brilliance of the cinematography.  The film was ahead of its time in effects.  The costumes were gorgeously flamboyant.  The acting was superb.  There has never (in my estimation) been a better film translation of this immortal tale.
B00004XONN|4.0|How can this be a bad album? Am I the only one who thinks this is a brilliant piece? Where is everyone?<br />I thought this is right up there with their two previous albums (OKC, bends). Many reviwers here point out that there is hardly any melody, just noise. I think its the other way around. I found  a lot of euphoric melody (in reminicense of OK Computer), and the noise actually made sense!<br />To the upset reviewers: did you actually think they should have made a second OK Computer? If you believe Radiohead is one of the greatest bands of this (and the past) decade so far, leave them to experiment, and not produce the same album over and over again. Doing that may prove that they are not so productive, and may cause them to lose credibility.<br />To the hopefuls: Listen again. and again. and again. You will eventually like it. Im surprised some people did not get it on first listen. I did!<br />To the ones who loved it: Rock on!
0553573403|5.0|Tolkien had originality, but sense then nothing has really compared to his work. But Martin comes along and arguebally blows tolkiens work out of the water.  Martin is a master at charecter devolpment, He has introduced us to charecters that will be remembered by its readers for a very very long time to come. Martin uses a sertain grace with his writing, its as if he takes his time with every little detail that happens to his charecters. Out of the 3 books that are currently out, this book is by far the best so far.  once you start you will not be able to put it down, and I almost would recamend not starting, for when you do you will be addicted to Martin and a song of ice and fire for life.
1878424114|5.0|As usual, Deepak Chopra provides us with a wonderful guide to living and the fulfilment of dreams in words anyone can understand. My favourite part of the book is at the end of each chapter. He provides a practical way of incorporating each spiritual law into your life, instead of just saying &quot;this is it!&quot;. It is not only easy to follow, but beautiful. This book will move your soul into directions you probably didn't even know you had a soul ;o) As they say we ARE all ONE ! Enjoy.
0679804021|4.0|I highly recommend Treasure Island by Robert Lewis Stevenson because <br />it has an excellent plot and theme.  Stevenson also writes using lots of details, and many <br />interesting similes and metaphors.  <br />This story of adventure fiction tells about Jim Hawkins the young protagonist who <br />happens upon a treasure map.  He then joins up with Dr Livesey who will lead the <br />adventure and the dangerous voyage filled with obstacles, and the evil pirate Long Jon <br />Silver and his crew in search of the buried treasure. The story begins in England in the <br /> year 1854, but they then sail to Treasure Island. <br />This book is written in past and present tense from the points of view of Jim <br />Hawkins, and Dr Livesey.  Here are some examples of Stevevson's writing as he uses <br />several details.  \\"From the side of the hill, which was here steep and stony, a spout of <br />gravel was dislodged, and fell rattling and bounding threw the trees.\\"  Here's an example <br />of Stevenson's great skill as he uses similes and metaphors.  \\"From trunk to trunk the <br />creature flitted like a dear, running man like on two legs, but unlike any man I had ever <br />seen stooping almost double as it ran.\\" <br />Every page is exciting and thrilling, often leaving the reader hanging on the edge, <br />not knowing what's going to happen next.  I think the chapter titles are really nice <br />because they give you a small idea about what's coming up next.<br />If your looking for an exciting and adventurous story I think that you would truly <br />enjoy this book.
B00004XONN|1.0|Pretty disappointing.  Some might say this music is ahead of its time and we're not going to understand what its about. Actually, I wouldn't even call this music.  I could let my cat walk on top of my MIDI keyboard and make something, perhaps, quite similar to the songs on this album.  It's like Vangelis on dope. Don't buy this, cause I know you'll be disappointed too like everyone else.
6304712499|5.0|Spawn is a movie that was translated to the film from a comic book, from those who may not have known that.  I was a fan of the comic books for quite a few years, and of Todd McFarlane longer than that, and I was heavily anticipating this movies release..  and it didn't let me down.  Agreed, the transaction from inked pages to living color wasn't exact, but it was well done none the same.<br />If you're not a fan of McFarlane's or of Spawn in particular, this movie should likely be reserved for those who enjoy heavy action films.  If you are a fan, this is certainly worth picking up.
0553108034|4.0|I have never seen any turn a world into so much chaos so gracefully and yes even flawlessly. With a clash of kings martin takes off right where Game of thrones left us with intensitiy and a quite strong emotional attatchment with his charecters. Although I would say this book wasnt quite as good as game of thrones, it was as close as it could possibly be.
B00004U8JU|4.0|A warning for those of you about to buy this DVD box set. First, Jurrasic Park is a fantatic move, they use every inch of 5.1 encoding; i have a state of the art sound system it was bliss.<br />Now, first you should know the &quot;hour of cut footage&quot; is 100% on the lost world CD not Jurrasic Park. the lost worl in my opinion was a very week movie. Almost like they were standing around with a bunch of Dino robots and extra film and they said &quot;why not&quot; So the lost worl cut footage was just as bad as the movie.<br />I wish they released it on DVD without Lost world, but still - worthy of my DVD collection.<br />Cheers.
B00004XONN|5.0|The complexity of the musical textures created by Radiohead on Kid A are beyond anything seen in Rock.
B00002MZ4W|4.0|This CD is hot. That's all i can say about it. I listen to it all the time. My parents are getting kinda of sick of it. I thought that the CD really represented Fiona. I didn't give it a perfect score because there are only 10 tracks. That doesn't matter though. All the songs are great. My favorite is &quot;A mistake&quot;. It has something about it. The way she worded the whole song was terrific. It is a must have for a Fiona fan.
B00003W8NM|5.0|There's more to this movie than what is on the surface, which I feel many Hollywood reviewers simply missed, or didn't understand.  On the outside, this movie is full of sex and violence and cussing and all the things we teach our kids to stay away from until they're.. well, at least 40.  Yet, this movie brings to life, on the underside, the trials and tribulations that the 20-something males of this world, and this country in particular, face from day to day.<br />Don't be fooled into believe this is a movie showing Brad Pitt and Edward Norton standing in a ring throwing punches at one another.  Agreed, fighting does have a play in the movie, but the title of the movie doesn't do the movie any justice.<br />Quite simply, I find this to be an absolutely amazing movie and I loved every second of it.  The moment I finished watching the rented VHS I jumped on here and ordered it immediately, and I've never been sorry for doing so.  A must-see for everyone, particularly the younger males of this world.. and do try looking past the hype and glamour to what the true meaning of the film holds.
B00004XONN|5.0|Imagine you've never heard of Radiohead or that they never existed before this record.  The question is this: &quot;Would you still like 'Kid A'?&quot;  If you have true musical taste, yes.  If you can find beauty in almost anything, this album is for you.  If you like complex art performed in music, then this album is definitely for you.  (you can stop pretending... now) If you like Radiohead, this album is for you.  If you don't have a clue who Radiohead is, take a listen.  This IS the future of music.<br />Radiohead took their formula for &quot;OK Computer&quot; (bring out some keyboards because of complete boredom of the guitar, and when bored of those, go back to guitars) and brought it to a higher level in this amazing record.  As soon as &quot;Everything In Its Right Place&quot; starts, you should know that you're in for one hell of a ride.  Sure, it might not amaze you the first listen.  But ignorant, one-star reviews are mainly coming from people who have only listened to it twice at the most.  This is an album that can do nothing but grow on you.  You cannot deny the utter complexity and fun of &quot;The National Anthem,&quot; nor can you deny the beauty of &quot;Motion Picture Soundtrack.&quot;  None of the masterpieces on this album are bombs.  This album hits every note beautifully and thensome.  The future of music is now, and Radiohead themselves have shown us the light.
630505116X|5.0|\\"This Ain't No Pleasure Cruise\\", the tag line of this under-appreciated movie reads, but it is for anyone who loves a good popcorn movie.If it weren't for \\"Jaws\\", I would have said this is the best, most fun sea monster movie ever made, period. I read about it in Fangoria, and the effects looked cool. I have trouble resisting a good monster movie, and I remember reading was that all the cast and crew said they had an absolute blast making the movie. I didn't really expect much, but this flick turned out to be so much fun I ended up buying it.<br />Treat Williams is Finnegan, a stock type of hero that is a cross between Han Solo and Bruce Campbell (or Bruce Campbell as Ash, I should say). You know, the type of 'scoundrel for hire' who owns his own ship and will get the job done for you for a price, even if it is technically criminal, but is basically a stand-up guy. He and his roughneck gang of mercenaries are hired to hijack and rob a luxury ocean liner on its maiden voyage in the South Seas. When he and his gang, which includes his stock Comic Relief Sidekick, Joey (Kevin J. O'Connor), find out that the rich scumbags who hired them to do the job left out some crucialinfo that make the job even more dangerous, they get cranky (standard dialogue such as \\"This wasn't part of the deal, and you know it!\\" ensues). However, this turns out to be the least of their friggin' problems, because when they board the ship, they find all the thousands of millionaire passengers have vanished without a trace. The only handful ones left alive are a sexy jewel thief (Famke Jannsen) and the big bosses of the ship. Hmmmmm...guess what happens? This is a monster movie, so...So I know this doesn't sound like much.<br />While this movie won't win any prizes for making you ponder the meaning of life, it is entertaining. One of those fun, mindless roller coaster movies that won't go down as the most thought provoking movie (you can predict exactly what is going to come out of a character's mouth at any given moment, such as \\"Hey...\\" \\"What?\\" (pause)\\"....Be careful\\"), but makes you realize how much fun a good dumb monster movie can be. The special effects are inventive and mind-blowing-they don't look low budget at all, and there's a ton of cool FX. Some of them are pretty memorable. The monster seems kind of run-of-the-mill at first, but keeps getting better and nastier. Instead of just eating its victims, it takes agonizing time to digest them before spitting out the gristle and bones, making for such a long painful death that characters save a bullet to kill themselves if the monster gets them, rather than go through the torture.<br />Without spoiling it,the monster turns out to be much more impressive and frightening (like other great monster movies, you don't see the entire creature in all its 'glory' till the grand finale) than anyone expects.<br />There's guts, goo, and gore-a-plenty for splatter fans (I was actually surprised that the MPAA let them get away with an R rating). There's many great horrifyingly disgusting moments, and I remember one in particular that occurs about 1/3 into the film that will make the most jaded viewer's jaws drop.<br />While the dialogue is corny and the characters 1-dimensional, there were actually several twists and turns to the storyline that were a shock, including one of the best and most original \\"the end...OR IS IT?\\" endings I've ever seen in a horror flick. Treat Williams is kind of a discount Bruce Campbell (man, that bit of casting would have made the movie perfect), but does a fine job even with some of the stupid catchphrases he is given (\\"NOW what?\\"). Famke Jannsen looks stunningly beautiful as always and is more talented and charismatic than more people give her credit for. The Sidekick, who does such a great job impersonating Joe Pantoliano (or \\"Joey Pants\\" as he is called by  the indie film industry) that I had to check the credits, actually gets some funny lines in (Finnegan: \\"Do you know how many uncharted islands there are out here?\\" Joey: \\"Uh, two?\\") The supporting cast, even the extras, ham it up and are clearly having lots of fun.<br /> There are some moments that are pretty frightening and there's plenty of nail biting suspense. While this movie is strongly reminiscent of John Carpenter's \\"The Thing\\", the \\"Alien\\" series, and even \\"The Empire Strikes Back\\" (Star Wars fans, listen to Williams when he raises his voice, he's a dead ringer for Ford as Han Solo) it is also very original. More importantly, this flick is just flat-out fun. If you're in the mood to escape reality completely, scream, and be entertained, then by all means pop in this underrated little gem , turn off your brain, and get ready to have a blast.<br />Full scream ahead, baby!charted islands there are out here?\\" Joey: \\"Uh, two?\\") The supporting cast, even the extras, ham it up and are clearly having lots of fun.<br /> There are some moments that are pretty frightening and there's plenty of nail biting suspense.

B000031WD9|5.0|I've always been a fan of lame jokes and the normal actions put forth in a teen movie, which is exactly what this is.  The movie itself I found incredibly hilarious.  As for the DVD features, (seeing how there are enough reviews pertaining to what the movie itself is about, I'll skip that) I found the Commentary to be absolutely the funniest thing I've heard.  Also, don't let the &quot;Unrated&quot; fool you..  the couple added scenes are nothing that will change the story nor make it any more enjoyable, don't expect anything exceptional here.  All in all, I found it to be a great movie.

B0000029DD|4.0|Jeff Buckley's music is truly amazing.  I can't believe the range in his voice esp how he sings in the song Corpus.  He makes me think of another musician with a voice with a wide range who I've just gotten into that being Happy Rhodes.  She sounds from Kate Bush to Annie Lennox in her music.  Her song If Love Is A Game, I Win is a good example of this.  Getting back to Buckley though I do sadly find it difficult to understand what he's saying in most of his songs so I lose out on alot I imagine.  His voice reminds me of Queen's singer and I think I'll listen to their song Who Wants To Live Forever in honor of Jeff.
B00001OH7N|4.0|this is my favorite along with hunky dory. to me, space oddity is merely ok and his stuff before that album , when i heard it,was probably the worst stuff ive heard from the 60s by a major rock musician! this album is stellar and there's nothing to complain about really. it is  probably the heaviest of his albums, some of this might remind you of black sabbath and led zeppelin. the songs seem very influenced  by nietzche and orwell.i'm surprised the songs aren't played at all on the radio- ( even though commercial radio sucks) and that the album was a flop when originally released. there are several classic cuts but the only 1 familiar to the average listener is the man who sold the world- but this album is so much more than that 1 song. there isn't a bad song on this fine record, although i dont listen to the supermen very often or she shook me cold.. i would call this a  very good album that falls just short of being a classic
B00004XONN|5.0|As I sit here listening to Radiohead's Kid A, the best album to come out this year, and quite possibly the best album they've ever made, for what could be the fifteenth time straight through since it was released a week ago, I can't help but believe that all the talk about being the &quot;saivors of rock&quot; and their new album being &quot;the most anticipated since In Utero&quot; is meaningless.  Toss away all convictions you may have recieved due to the controversy this album caused, and listen to it purely, straight, as a work of its own.  Evocative paranoia comes across on such songs/soundscapes as &quot;Kid A&quot; and &quot;Everything in It's Right Place.&quot;  Longing and frustration emerge on &quot;How to Disappear&quot; and &quot;In Limbo.&quot;  Resignation comes up front and center on &quot;Optimistic&quot; and the tear-jerking closer &quot;Motion Picture Soundtrack.&quot;  Whoever can say this isn't a heartfelt work of pain and effort in this age of Eminems and Limp Bizkits has lost touch with what music really is.  If you've been an obsessive fan of Radiohead's, or have never heard a song of theirs before, I stress you get this album.  Approach it on its own terms, and a thing of terrific beauty will emerge forth.  Listen to it.  Live it.  Love it.
B000001EYW|5.0|I remember listening to the Bee Gees when I was a youngster and that was that..game over...that was fun.  I saw this CD in the store last week and decided, for a laugh, to see what this sounded like.  Well, It's amazing!  The Bee Gees have done something that few long lived bands can do...produce music that is memorable and contemporary, while at the same time maintaining their unique style.  (want proof?  pick up a the Fixx's latest album..they could NOT pull it off)  The Bee Gees, however have pulled it off with ease.  Among favorites are Alone, My Lover's Prayer, I Will, and Miracles Happen.  Harmonizing at it's very best, with incredibly beautiful keyboards and funky beats will have you singing these songs long after the headphones come off!  In my opinion, it is a classic and the best album I've heard in quite some time. Games NOT over..long live the Bee Gees!!
B00004XONN|5.0|I suppose the only thing I may offer up as a characteristic of this review that sets it aside from the 600-odd other reviews is the fact that it is written by someone who is completely unexperienced with Radiohead.  Before purchasing this album, I had not even heard of Radiohead, and had no particular interest in the whole rock/alternative/whatever scene.  After listening to this album, however, it is clear that Radiohead had in mind an attempt at progression when they produced this album.<br />Perhaps this album is really nothing more than a departure from OK Computer (whatever the hell that album sounds like--I haven't heard anything from it); it seems to me that it's quality is nonetheless undeniable.  <br />Without going too far into my own theories of music and the apprehension of music, I'll note that Radiohead seems to have grasped the fact that lyrical content is relatively unimportant to a musical expression.  Who cares if I don't understand the singers in an Italian opera?  I still leave the opera house having experienced the emotion that the music (which includes the voices of the singers) evokes.  The same goes for Kid A; the phrases may be repeated, and some of it may be unintelligable--it is still evocative and damn powerful.<br />This album seems to be an experience, not merely a collection of songs from which a few favorites can be culled and then played on the local radio station.  It has its flaws, sure, but it is still a work of brilliance--though this may not be understandable to one who is accustomed to listening for &quot;hits.&quot; <br />From the perspective of one who has never heard Radiohead before Kid A, I say bravo.
B000002JOF|3.0|This is a nice enough sounding record, but it's terminally blighted. Rea is a tasty, if unoriginal guitar player: when he isn't aping Telegraph Road-era Knopfler he's ripping off mid seventies Gilmour, complete with wheezy slide. Enough plank-spanking talk, however. The guitar playing is one of the more pleasant aspects of the experience. The songs, and especially the title track are also agreeably melodious and solidly written.<br />But, somehow, it's all just a bit duff.<br />The lyrics don't help; they're fifth form, back-of-exercise-book in spirit and execution, and the rosy-red tinge to them don't really wash when written and delivered by a sportscar-driving portly rock star from High Barnet. More grating, though, is the instrumentation. The title track builds up moodily for a couple of minutes: you know, riders-on-the-storm-esque rain, some wish-you-were-here-esque ambient radio, some purring synth pads, trinkling piano (which I'm pretty sure has been nicked off a Chopin Prelude) and a crisply recorded gravelly voice intoning menacingly and then, from nowhere, SPLISH! WHACK-A-THUMP-A-WHACK-A-THUMP-A, as some clot hits &quot;play&quot; on a Boss Dr. Rhythm drum machine, converting said brooding atmospheric masterpiece into I've Got A Lovely Bunch of Coconuts as played on a Casiotone.<br />WHAT WAS HE THINKING? Clearly someone has invested a lot of studio time and session fees in this project - would it have been that hard to employ a real drummer? Unhappily there's rather a lot of this blight thoughout the record.<br />The Road to Hell isn't bad music, but it's ambient - if you focus on it to the exclusion of all else, pretty soon you'll start wincing and wishing they'd spent another couple of grand on the session band and not relied on machines. But I suppose it was eighties, and it seemed like the right thing to do back then. But then again, so did moon-walking.
B000001FOS|5.0|the album is good. you will listen to joe lynn turners vocals here. The johanssen brothers will be playing too on this album. the songs are okay. my favorite tracks are rising force, krakatau, crytal ball, heaven tonight, and Deja Vu. the other songs are okay, but just are not my favorites when hearing them.  overall the cd is good. highly recommended!

Harmonizing at it's very best, with incredibly beautiful keyboards and funky beats will have you singing these songs long after the headphones come off!  In my opinion, it is a classic and the best album I've heard in quite some time. Games NOT over..long live the Bee Gees!!
B00003OSSM|3.0|a mature film that seems to go against the usual norms and audience expectations nowadays, there are obvious problems with the plot and especially the second half of the movie, cannot fail to see some Kubrick influences, an interesting attempt overall
0440219078|5.0|I loved this book!  It really got me thinking!   I thought it was great and i highly recomend it!
B00004TL21|2.0|It's as if most metal bands operating on the scene since the mid-90's,that have reached platinum status think they are obligated to release an arty and experimental 3rd album.for example;korns'-issues and Limp Bizkits'-chocolate starfish.In some cases this musical &quot;maturity&quot; works,such as Korns'-issues yet in many cases does not work.White pony is an example where this musical &quot;maturity&quot; does not work.On White Pony Deftones forsake their energy and vibrancy for &quot;arty&quot; and keyboard  drenched &quot;soundscapes&quot;.Don't get me wrong,i am not against musical development into different sonic territories,yet White Pony sounds forced,There still is guitar distortion and hard drumming yet the chunky riffs of old and jagged drumming have been soaked in keyboard and over-spacious studio techniques.Also Chino Morenos voice has(purposefully?) become apathetic and show-offy,yet his lyrics still posess as much emotion and passion as on past Deftones releases.I am still a big fan of the Deftones,as i worship their first 2 albums.Yet,i sincerely hope that Deftones will get a shot of energy back into them for their fourth album.A HUGE dissapointment.
B00004XONN|1.0|This is definitely the worst thing I've ever heard. The only song that is remotely decent in my opinion is Idioteque, but that gets dull after about one listen. I got this CD as a gift, and I was fortunate enough to be able to return it, even though I had taken the plastic off. (I didn't know anything about it until I got it, so I thought it might be good.)
B00001OH7M|5.0|This is a very rare combination in rock. Hippy elements but pretty sensual lyrics for a male, See &quot;Letter to Hermione&quot;. David at his most angry &quot;Cygnet Comittee&quot; and &quot;Unwashed&quot;. The back up band is awesome. Tony Visconti is amazing, adding flute and recorder to retain some folk element to a new style of writing that was way ahead of it's time. Who sang so passionately about cult leaders back then? Very Psychedelic at times, with David's reverbed vocals on &quot;An occaisional Dream&quot;. David Bowie is like nothing else and this LP is like no other in his collection. That's why it's 5 stars.
078322608X|3.0|This simple movie had of course, a great cast.  But I thought that the plot was pretty complicated at first but it became simple in the end.  There was a lot of chaotic things going on and the movie lost my focus. I tried to stick with this movie but I just lost interest while I was watching it, and I was just sitting through this movie.  I sighed with relief once it was over and I don't think I will be watching it again.  This movie was a waste of money to me but I do recommend renting it off the shelves first before you buy.
B00000J8EK|5.0|If you can't get into this CD, you're wasting oxygen for the rest of us.
B000001FT0|3.0|I would actually give it 3 1/2 stars, and I am a very hard grader. (For example, I would give 5 stars to only a handful of albums) Anyway, I like this Winwood album better than any of his others because it has melodies that flow. I thought his later albums were too choppy. I don't like songs where the vocals dominate and dictate the beat. In &quot;Talking Back to the Night,&quot; there's none of that, but rather a fine balance of instrumentation and vocals. Some of the tracks on this album are great for driving. I'm not sure why Winwood abandoned this style, but I suppose he wanted to move on and try other techniques.
B000000OPU|5.0|This was one of the 1st CD's I ever got.  A friend of mine described this as &quot;perhaps the best sounding album of 1986&quot;.  You have to remember this was recorded right when the technology age was starting to boom!  Peter Gabriel brings in talents like Daniel Lanois (producer and guitar), David Rhodes (guitar), Kate Bush (vocals), Stewart Copeland (drums and hi-hat), Nile Rogers (guitar), Tony Levin (bass), Richard Tee (keyboards).  &quot;Big Time&quot; is a funny song  (&quot;and my heaven will be a big heaven and I will walk through the front door&quot;) with a rhythm and blues beat provided by Copeland.  &quot;Sledgehammer&quot; is done similarly with Mowtown-style brass (&quot;I've kicked the habit, shed my skin&quot;).  &quot;Don't Give Up&quot; is one of the most encouraging songs ever (with Kate Bush dueting).  &quot;Mercy Street&quot; has some of Peter Gabriel's best lyrics.  &quot;We Do What We're Told&quot; is based on Milgram's 33 experiment (where people were tricked into thinking they would have to punish others for giving the wrong answers).  &quot;This Is the Picture&quot; sounds a lot like the old Genesis of the 1970's.  &quot;In Your Eyes&quot; features some great guitar work from David Rhodes and was featured in the movie Say Anything, released 3 years after this album: &quot;All my instincts, they return, and the grand facade, so soon will burn&quot;.  &quot;That Voice Again&quot; features Richard Tee on piano and has some unique chord changes (F#, C#, C minor, E flat minor, and back to C#).  &quot;Red Rain&quot; has some cool percussion effects provided by Stewart Copeland and Jerry Marota, giving the listener the illusion of a rainstorm.
B000001FNL|5.0|This is a great album for the BG's. Wonderful R&amp;B songs, tender ballads and even a song about making love (growl.)<br />What I like most about it, and all pre-machine produced music, is the drums. Not flashy or overpowering, but right on. Clean &amp; precise which is something that was tragicly lost when the world of pop went to the electric percussion that dominated the 80's, and, that which has seemed to have returned, on the charts, lately.<br />Big hits: &quot;Jive Talkin'&quot;, &quot;Night On Broadway&quot;, &quot;Fanny (Be Tender With My Love&quot;.) Also here the country-ish &quot;Come On Over&quot;(a later hit for Olivia Newton-John) is nice, as is the closer &quot;Baby As You Turn Away.&quot;<br />A wonderful album of great, mid-70's produced, real songs. And one of the best BG's albums ever.
B00004X01U|1.0|As a fans of Madonna for over 10+ years, this album is a major let-down and total disappointment.  No wonder the pile of CDs at the used store is just as high.  I guess people either it love it or hate it.  People applause for what they call &quot;re-direction&quot;, &quot;re-invention&quot;, .... let just say that expectation and values of music have changed.  The album is a total sound manipulation.  Bunch of noise that you can't really hear what is being sung.  The lyrics are cliched and boring.  &quot;Music&quot; seems to be the best piece of the album and the rest is just fillers.
B0000048CX|5.0|A lovely cd.  I find myself reaching for it often.  This is my first and only Yo La Tengo cd but I plan to purchase many more now.  I just hope they're all as pleasing as this one.
6305750750|4.0|I enjoyed this movie, i do not see why everyone was soo dissapointed  in this movie.  It is worth about 3 stars in my book, but with what you get in this box set, it raised my rating a star.  Pros of the movie are:  Good special effects, Cool fighting scenes, and a cool pod racing scene.  Cons are:  Predictable, and not as worthly of a movie as its preceders.  But, never-the-less this movie is average.  If you like Star Wars, you should enjoy the contents of this box set.  It contains a movie reel and the movie and a book(i am pretty sure it is the screenplay, but i cant remember for certain.)
B00004XONN|3.0|I may be one of the last chubbas on the planet who has yet to hear &quot;OK Computer&quot;! So I stumbled at the doorstoop of &quot;Kid A&quot; with a rather unique perspective. I was drawn in, like many other wakullas it might seem, by the hype surrounding this release and the volcanic praise over OKC. I have listened to Kid three times in two days and this is my take on this disc. There are some really yummy sounds here and it does offer a somewhat staggered cohesiveness. And though I really, honestly have not heard &quot;OK Computer&quot;(busy, working, sleeping, out that year, in a coma, etc.), I *can* honestly say that this CD does not really explode genres nor necessarily break new soil. The vocals, what little there are, are best when they are most difficult to decipher as otherwise the lyrics can come across as trite(silly also comes to mind). My bias in this review, and I guess there really is some, comes from having lately lapped up oodles of luscious &quot;techno&quot; sounds(that's really what this CD is) from bands who do it much better than RH. These include but are not limited to Stereolab, Underworld, Brian Eno, Aphex Twin. There are obvious nods, if not downright homages to, some of these other electronic maestros woven in the shadowy sonics of Kid. For those ogarrs who suggest repeated plays, perhaps with phones-of-the-head on, it seemed to work for this fellar as I like it much more now than the first time. I'm not sure if I will keep it yet, I will have to listen to it some more. Oh, naturally, I can't *wait* to hear their earlier stuff to compare it with, won't that be a kick in the asser?! Now don't lose perspective in all the drivel, success for this CD seemed guaranteed, so listen to this coaster because it sounds good not because you think it should, not because the goopy reviews were so joyful, not because kid 'b' in the dorm room next door said so. If you don't like it don't fret, you've still got their earlier CDs to smooge and those other technotric bands I mentioned may come in handy.
0780631684|5.0|I just watched this movie, i do not think that i will ever be the same, either!  It is very suspensful, scary, and VERY bloody and VERY glory!!  It has some of the coolest death scenes to date!  Buy it, but before you watch it, buckle up, and expect the unexpected!!! HIGHLY RECCOMENDED!!!!!  15 OUT OF 10!!!!!!!!
B00004XONN|5.0|Radiohead were the most likely band to be written off as a one-hit wonder.  Nobody expected for there to be life after &quot;Creep&quot;.  But here they are, releasing their third consecutive superb album.  Their previous album OK Computer (with the hit single 'Fitter Happier') was a challenging CD which took some time to fully appreciate, and the same thing is likely to happen with this CD (feat. the top 10 smash 'Treefingers'), although I personally liked this one on first listen.  I happen to be a large fan of obtuse music, such as Sonic Youth, so this was my cup of tea right off the bat. It is extremely important to keep in mind that this is a LISTENING EXPERIENCE, and NOT a collection of songs.  Anybody who is looking for verse-chorus-verse pop ditties should stay away.  Anybody who is willing to delve into a 100% original sonic experience that no other set of human beings could have conceived, on the other hand, should buy this CD immediately.  Despite their radio-friendly beginnings in 'Creep', 'High And Dry' and 'Just', Radiohead have never been one to conform with the public's perceptions of what music should sound like.  Fully aware that their fan base will listen to, rather than hear, their music, they have intelliengtly released 10 unsettling, emotionally stunning tracks unlike anything from this side of the Atlantic Ocean.  The most radio-friendly tracks are the gorgeous string-laden 'How To Disappear Completely', 'Optimistic' and the fantastic dance-ish drum loops of 'Idioteque', but 'Kid A', 'In Limbo' and the 'Motion Picture Soundtrack' (with its stunning harp section) are equally likeable.  Songs like 'Everything In Its Right Place' and 'National Anthem', on the other hand, require a bit more time to fully comprehend what's happening, but in the end, are just as good as anything else they've done.  As for nature-show-sounding 'Treefingers', just sit back and relax to its serene ambience, you'll need it after the tumultuous first 4 songs.  And no review would be complete without mentioning Thom Yorke's stunning vocals.  His voice adds an extra dimension to songs such as 'Morning Bell' and 'Idioteque' while demonstrating to the max his broad range on 'In Limbo' and 'Kid A'.  All in all, every single track is remarkable in its own little way, but you have to listen to each of them in succession if you want to get the most out of Kid A.  Sheer genius?  For sure.  Better than OK Computer?  Maybe.  I think so anyway.  Album of the year?  Most likely.  The best album of all time?  It's a bit premature to say so now.  Let me listen to it for 5 more years then I'll decide.  In any case, I think I've finally found an album better than the first Mr. Bungle CD.  And it only took 9 years to find it!
B00004XONN|1.0|Some people I know hale this as the greatest piece of music to be recorded in the history of Western Civilization. A guy I work with says it lifted him to a new level of conciousness. Take a tip from me --- listen to the samples before you buy it --- to me it sounds like an hour long musical interpretation of a fatal car-wreck. Apparently taste is really subjective on this one --- To me it barely even qualifies as music --- its just a mish-mash of inharmonic noise. In my opinion, don't waste your time.
B00004XONN|3.0|This album is a trid diffrent from ok. Yet radiohead continues to change and influcence new styles. The only problem I have is how everyone is acting like they're the first to tread this style/bondry. I guess most people have forgotten sebadoh and proboly have never heard of Emperior Penguin which is what a kid sounds a lot like cept on vocals. But, hey it always takes the commercial band to wain everyones taste in style. If you like this I recommend checking out emperior penguin too.
0893860220|5.0|This book is one of the most profound books ever written. Although little known right now, in my view it is destined to become a classic of world literature.
6302732875|5.0|I had never been a big fan of Jack Lemmon (not including the Apartment) or Alec Baldwin prior to this movie.  In fact many times I have found Lemmon's style irritating.  However, Lemmon gives perhaps the best performance I have ever seen on screen in this painful-to-watch movie.  I have never been so touched by the raw emotion of a performance in my life.  He should have won the academy award.  <br />Alec Baldwin, if you can get past the ludicrous good looks and poor script choices, is simply an extraordinary actor and one of the best in Hollywood today.  His performance GGR proves that beyond the shadow of a doubt.  He also does an similarly great job in Outside Providence.<br />If you enjoy watching actors at the absolute peak of their game, buy this movie.
0671891634|3.0|I have to say that Lynch's ealier book is a better reading, as it detail more of his matters of picking stocks.<br />In this book, nothing new is introduced beside trying to get the average investor to invest more wisely in mutual funds. I really think that Lynch should actually discuss more on the technical aspect of his stock picking matters.<br />My advice to other readers - Do not waste your money if you already had a copy of &quot;one up on wall street&quot;.
B00004Y2QT|5.0|This started out as Prince doing the greatest thing ever on stage inluding the last live performance of 1999 the hit song from 1982 (but it's come a looong way!) on pay-per-view with great guest stars and great old time songs (The Lenny Kravitz part was cool). so you could have a FULL TIME BLAST just at home but now they are releasing it on VHS and DVD!  I have to give both the VHS and DVD version a very pleaseant 5 stars.
B000024JEX|5.0|Finally, the Blue Notes Sessions box set is avaible in the States (I had to get mine from Germany).  The earlier one disc release did not do justice to this collection (in fact, in my humble opinion, the 1st set on June 5th was the best and should have been released instead.)  What you have here is Keith Jarrett at his personal best, together with Peacock and DeJohnette, the trio goes through numerous jazz standards and a handful of Jarrett originals.  Keith keeps the moaning to a minimum and seems to play every set like it is his last.  A truly wonderful listening experience.  Check out On Green Dolphin Street, Autumn Leaves and My Romance in particular.  Trust me, it's worth the money!
067144901X|5.0|This book is so fun! We bought &quot;Moo, Baa, La La La&quot;, &quot;But Not the Hippopotamus&quot;, &quot;A to Z&quot;, &quot;Fingers, Toes and Everything In Between&quot;, &quot;Doggies&quot; and &quot;The Going to Bed Book&quot;, all at the same time.  Our son was 1 at the time.  Now we have a 2 year old daughter.  They have both loved them so much, the books are falling apart from being read!  We plan on having more children and will be buying the books again to replace the worn out ones!  You will absolutely love them!
B00000J6AG|5.0|I have heard many people try to classify &quot;Play&quot; into a single category. This is impossible. Moby has created one of the most musically diverse albums I have ever heard (the others being R.E.M.'s &quot;Up,&quot; Beck's &quot;Odelay,&quot; and Radiohead's &quot;Kid A&quot;). At over an hour in length, it may seem difficult at first to listen to the album all the way through, but to do so is extremely rewarding. It is especially fun to try and locate where on the album the &quot;genre changes&quot; take place. Songs like &quot;Honey,&quot; &quot;Bodyrock,&quot; and &quot;My Weakness&quot; seem as if they were made by different artists, and when listened to individually, they definitely do not feel like they should be on the same album. But this is what makes the album so great. Moby completely threw out the rules and created an album the way he wanted to, not the way some DJ would want him to. One of the best things about the album is not musically related at all. The liner notes contain several essays written by Moby himself, on topics such as veganism, fundamentalism, and laws regarding drug use. Fascinating stuff. Buy this album. You will be a better person for it.
B000001OAA|5.0|This is one of my favorite CDs ever so I had to review it on Amazon. :)  I saw Garbage in concert when they opened for Alanis and I hadn't known their music then but right away I was hoooked and I went out and bought both CD's.  Shirley Manson's vocals are awesome, and the band plays great background music.  What's even better is that Garbage's lyrics rock.  My favorite songs on this CD are &quot;I'm Only Happy When It Rains&quot; and &quot;Stupid Girl&quot;. The music on this CD will make you dance, and its lyrics will make you think.  If you're like me, you'll listen to this CD over and over and over again. :)
078881172X|3.0|I watched this video with my children. It was the first time I've seen Peter Pan since my own childhood and it was every bit as captivating as I'd remembered - with one exception. I waited expectantly for the moment that Peter Pan asks the audience to help him save Tinkerbell.  It seems that the scene was cut short.  Without that critical footage, it just wasn't the same movie.
6305949980|5.0|The Nightmare Before Christmas has replaced Bell, Book and Candle as my all time favorite Christmas movie!!

0345441184|5.0|I have read a lot of period novels about the Arthurian age of ancient Britain, but this is by far the greatest novel I have EVER read, hands down!
B000002IZ4|5.0|This CD complements the STP sound that came out with 'Core' - the songs here are intense, quirky, rockin, mellow - yet they all blend into one of the best alternative rock CD's of the 90's BY FAR.  <br />'Interstate Love Song' is simply classic, 'Meatplow' is a great aural infusion of heavy-alt, 'Vasoline' takes us to a new level of upbeat alt, 'Pretty Penny' eeks out a folky-intense sound, and 'Big Empty' is a wild combo of chord-crashing and mellow interludes that has found it's way to alt-rock station's playlist (what a feat!).  What is it all up?  Simply a mix of a lot of musical styles that blend well together into a great CD - we are not talking anything TOO weirdly diverse - just a CD that weaves lots of different styles together into a definitive alternative rock that doesn't do the simple '2 hard ones, 1 soft one' formula.  You just have to hear it to believe it!
0380002930|5.0|Watership Down tells the story of a bunch of rabbits (Hazel and his brother Fiver, Bigwig, Silver and others) who are forced to leave their warren as Fiver's sixth sense tells him great danger is coming. As they look for a place to settle down, not only do they encounter many enemies along the way, but also other rabbits with different ways of living, and who can sometimes be particularly unfriendly.<br />They finally find an idyllic place to live: on Watership Down. As they settle down, they suddenly realise they've forgotten about something: females!<br />The story goes on to describe their raids to capture does and bring them back to their new warren. They first manage to get a hutch female rabbit from a nearby farm, but soon realise that just one female is not enough.<br />So they make for Efrafa, a warren not far from theirs, only to discover it is run by a certain General Woundwort, a tyrant who thinks of his rabbits as an army. In fact, these rabbits are prisoners, unhappy and unable to escape.<br />So Hazel, Bigwig and their friends devise a plan to rescue some does, risking their own live in the process.<br />From this brief outline of the plot and even from the cover of the book, Watership Down may look like a children's book. Do not be fooled: this book is full of violence and cruelty, not just between rabbits and their natural foes, but also among themselves. And you realise early on that, somehow like in George Orwell's Animal Farm, it's fundamentaly a critical view of our own human society, a way of showing us how we also can behave in a barbarous way.<br />Anyway, I think the book is still suitable for children who will love this great adventure, as Watership Down is aslo full of suspense and once you've started, it's &quot;unputdownable&quot;! Moreover, its characters are very interesting and well developed, and in the end it's extremely amusing, especially when these rabbits take a look at us human beings...<br />This book is not just for bunny lovers so hop along and get yourself a copy quick! And don't forget it's companion: Tales from Watership Down.rs so hop along and get yourself a copy quick! And don't forget it's companion: Tales from Watership Down.
B000002J20|5.0|This has always been my favorite Yes record since it came out in 1973, but I always suspected that only I and my friend Gerry appreciated it. After reading and hearing 25 years of comments, I think I'm on track with the general consensus. This is both a deep and satisfying record, and also a frustrating - and at times tedious - one. My vinyl copy is almost worn out on sides 1 and 2, and almost unused on sides 3 and 4, so that should tell you something. The album was supposed to be based on a Buddhist concept, but I couldn't follow it. The lyrics, like most Yes lyrics, always sounded to me like computer-generated sentences that sound profound until you try to make some sense of them. (What does &quot;Coloured in pastures of chance dancing leaves cast spells of challenge&quot; mean?!) Unless I'm missing some profundity, I suspect that the lyrics are probably best appreciated as just word-shaped sound impressions. The music is where the real content of this album exists. The first side, or piece, or whatever you want to call it, The Revealing Science of God, is definitely the best. It carries you in and then leads you forward through a complex and very emotionally evocative process that feels like a journey. This is music that demands to be listened to, not just played in the background. The second side (The Remembering) is almost as good, but a little less deep, and able to be listened to in the background a little easier. The third side (The Ancient: Giants Under the Sun) is what my friend Gerry called &quot;The Making of Plastics music.&quot; Sounds like a '60's soundtrack from industrial process films. And the fourth side (The Ritual) is just meandering and draggy. Yes, all four sides have their moments, but all in all I'd say they spent their inspiration early on this record. Still, just the first two sides make it probably the best thing Yes ever did. &quot;Oceans&quot; also rates a &quot;2&quot; from me on the Stale and Dated scale of 1 to 10 when heard 27 yearslater (where 1 is &quot;The Basement Tapes&quot; and 10 is &quot;Saturday Night Fever&quot;). My kids would disagree, but a lot of what they like sounds like Side Three to me anyway.
B000007T1M|5.0|System of a Down is definitely one of the best bands out there.  I first heard their awesome single, &quot;sugar&quot; on the radio...and then my friend told me what good album it is...so i went out and bought it.  I didn't really know what to expect when i brought it home, but after listening it to a couple of times i knew that i had made a good choice.  Serj's vocals are probably some of the most interesting ones i've ever heard.  He ranges from 'goth' roars (on songs like &quot;suite pea&quot; and &quot;war?&quot; among others) to melodic warbling (on songs like &quot;mind&quot; and &quot;spiders.&quot;)  This range of sounds is part of what keeps the album interesting.<br />I'm not sure if you can compare their sound to anybody, it's quite unique.  But their politcal views are much like that of Rage Against the Machine.  I'm a big Rage fan, and i share some of their views, and finding another band that commented on the politics of the world enthralled me.  With songs like &quot;War?&quot; and &quot;P.L.U.C.K.&quot; (Politcally Lying Unlawful Cowardly Killers) commenting on things like the Armenian Massacre of 1915(go to SOAD's webpage [...] to find out more)I believe that thier politcal commentary might be better than Rage's.<br />Some of the other topics that they comment on are drug abuse in &quot;Peephole&quot; and the use of mind control technology in &quot;Mind.&quot;  These and other issues are just some of the ones that are covered throughout the 13 songs.<br />But, if you don't care about politics, there is the Music as well.  SOAD's pumped up guitar riffs and basslines, not to mention the drumming, leaves you hungry for more once the CD ends.  It is definitely a great album for all metal and non-metal fans out there. (My friend who recommended it to me doesn't listen to a lot of metal.)  If you're looking for a great album to spend some quality time with, I definitely reccomend System of a Down's self-titled debut album. <br />Come and join the system and Open Your Eyes, Open Your Mouths, Close Your Hands And Make A Fist!
0684853523|5.0|Pow!! Great read!!  Full of emotion as well as real usable information.  One paragraph I would be laughing out loud and the next my eyes would be full of tears.  Stephen gives his readers another page turner along with a wealth of knowledge about writing.  Rather a novice or a published author, it's time well spent.
B00004XONN|5.0|I got the CD, Kid A the day after it came out. I popped it in my CD player, turn the lights out, and sat in most comfy of chairs and LISTEN... Truthfully it's a lot to take in at once and the CD lacks in the traditional structure of a 'typical' rock album. No real songs! Intelligible lyrics and power riffs? Non-existent! Lots of keyboards, samples, bass guitars, drums. Sounds more electronica than rock. But, it's not a bad thing!!! Ah, what a BREATH OF FREASH AIR! After silly bands like Creed, Third Eye Blind, 3 Doors Down (blah!) and others like (not worth mentioning here) dominating the so-called alternative rock scene that has been so manufactured into a corporate money-machine that leaves little to the imagination than it's cool poster-boy image and snappy radio friendly, limp songs. If you like these bands and actually pay to go see them in concert. This CD is NOT for you! For the rest of us, Kid A is such a lush and texture collage and sounds that paints a dreamy landscape painting in our heads almost like the image on the album cover. It's an experience to listen this CD as a whole and not to break it apart into individual songs. Each piece compliments the other. The only other albums I can compare it to is Pink Floyd's &quot;Obscured By Clouds&quot; and Aphex Twin's &quot;I Care Because You Do&quot;. All I can say is that you feel isolated and removed from today's plastic music scene. This album expresses the confusion and malaise that is prevalent in today's world as a whole. Granted, it won't change your life. But, it is essential for musical sustenance. If you got it, you know what I mean. If you don't have it, break from the (POP) machine that you are a part of open your mind and ears.  If not, enjoy the rest of the day!
B000000WF0|5.0|Ouch this album STILL makes me cry....everytime...ever since it came out in 97. I havent heard much of the Verve before this  one but if they sound anything at all like this album then I  will probably like it. Too bad the Verve self destructed...I  think they could have gone even deeper if they stayed together  but I suppose its the whole &quot;rock star&quot; ego thing :) But this isnt about Richards new album.....Anyways this album is special  for me because I was in London the year it came out...and it just SO captured everything London and England/Europe was at  that point in time and in my life as well (issues I was  struggleing with and still are a bit) I like Sonnet and Bittersweet Symphony and just about all of them really! I like  the way the music makes you feel the very precious moments of your life passing before you...the desperation just to make ends  meet in a BIG city...(I just decided to move there and live  there on a student work abrod program for 4 months) it was the first time I really had to &quot;live on my own&quot;. Just get a copy of or buy this album its really worth it in my opinion, just dont feed yourself a daily dose of this music...you will get depressed and you will be crying and blubbering :) but you will get trance- ported to another place mabey even see the other side....at least I did :)
0792841344|2.0|Well, I bought this movie based on the numerous 4/5 stars given by other reviewers. Waited for quite some time till it got delivered and was expecting to see something outstanding (smth you cant put your hands on in the middle of Region 2...). But frankly I was disappointed. This movie is not scary at all. It has some interesting scenes (the tension is quite OK when inside the funeral house, liked the head drilling sphere, maybe the dwarfs) but not much else. The plot is easy, the caracters are somehow (maybe only for me) not really believable. The Tall Man is &quot;advertised&quot; as a dreadful, evil caracter. For me he's just a weird guy (I don't mean to offend any Phan, sorry). To be fair, I'll give it one more trial. There are movies you need to digest and at the second watch they may prove to be better. <br />I'm now working hard convincing myself that Phantasm has it's place in my collection as a horror classic but this does not seem to help. Luckily it did not cost a fortune.
B00000ILE7|1.0|The first two movies in this series, altough different in genre (horror and action) were very well done and and fit together perfectly.  The first movie moved smoothly into the next and made for an increadible journey.     The third movie destroys all of the work of the first two.  It seems that the producers/director did not like having a happy ending for &quot;Aliens&quot;.  They killed off characters that you rooted for the entire film (&quot;Aliens&quot;) without reason.  They end up with a script that is just an ordinary slasher film.   Creature chases good girl around huge building for 1 1/2 hours.  The creativity and zest of the first two was lost.     Do yourself a favor and skip to &quot;Ressurection&quot;!
6305807930|4.0|I have not much to comment on the movie itself. It'll be excellent for those ready to accept a surrealistic film and be poor for those looking for hight tech effects &amp; true plot. I have to admit that I personally very much enjoyed it. I saw this movie first when I was some 14 and it had a considerable effect on me. Actually I could never forget the scene with the rotting body at the &quot;basement&quot; (and was careful enough to avoid stepping on any sewer top for years...). Since than a good 15 years has passed so I was a bit sceptic whether the movie could still have the same effect on me. It almost could. But there was something completely disturbing: the dubbing. During the whole movie I saw the guys standing next to their microphones, with pages in their hands, reading a text. As if it was a kind of a penalty for them. This never happened to me before but it almost ruined the whole atmosphere of the film. I'll switch to Italien the next time I watch it -not understanding a word-  only to see if there's a difference. I won't lose much anyway since the movie is more built on visuals/sound rather than on conversations. I frankly don't understand how come a dubbing like that gets released.
B000000OMB|5.0|As I read the reviews previously written, I couldn't believe it would actually earn a 1 or 2 star rating from anyone. This album is INCREDIBLE! I think people who didn't like it probably had all kinds of pre-concieved notions about what these artists would sound like together. I bought this album in vinal back in '82, and it's going into my CD collection as well. This album does stand the test of time as far as I'm concerned, because each album on this song, with the excpetion of One Step Closer, is still every bit as exciting as it was when I first heard most of these songs on the radio. I believe 5 of the 9 songs played on the radio when this album was new. Even Alpha was a pretty good follow-up, just not near as awesome as thier first very memorable album. Asia Rocks! You must buy this album to believe it. Rarely does anyone put out an album with 8 songs that you just can't wait to hear.

0375501851|4.0|White Teeth is a story that has something for everyone!  It all begins with Archie trying to gas himself in a car and being 'rescued'.  From there it touches on marriages, wives, husbands, children, brothers, sisters, grandparents, friends and the relationships they all have with each other.<br />It's funny, touching, ambitious and really worth a read.  Congratluations Zadie on such a spectacular first novel.
B00004XONN|5.0|At first I was kinda skeptical about Radiohead.  When I first heard OK Computer, I was amazed by the music and how the sounds and rhythms fit into place.  I waited for the next album from them.  When I bought Kid A and popped it in my cd player, I was suprised to hear their music.  Their music wasn't similar to OK Computer, it was unique.  They weren't another sellout band producing the same sounds as other bands.  They had created a sonic blend of sounds that sounded incredible.  This is truly a cd I recommend to everyone.  It is created wonderfully, with twist rhythms and sounds.  This album is truly incredible, I salute you Radiohead.
B00003CX8I|4.0|As soon as our group got out of the theatre we all unanimously rated the movie as a four out of a possible five.  As a science fiction/action adventure film I would give this a five.  But as an X-Men fan, I felt a little disappointed that I did not see more characters.  Also, the knowledge that I was going to have to wait a few more years before I would get the chance to see more of those characters rained on my parade a little.  <br />At the same time, I also immediately decided to add this movie to my collection after seeing it because it IS a good movie.  For those who were introduced to the X-Men for the first time, this movie may have seemed sufficiently entertaining and complete in itself.  But as for me, although I loved watching it, I just couldn't help myself from longing to see a more complete (and varied) team of X-Men and a greater sense of finality to the ending.  Don't get me wrong - I loved the movie.  But something inside me wanted just a little bit more.
6300247120|5.0|I have watched Breaking Away more times than I can count.  I first saw it when it was on TV, and at the age of 7 or 8, I watched it with my dad.  It has only gotten better over time.  At first glance, it may seem like one of those cliche, underclass overcoming the odds and beating the priviliged movies, but it is so much more.<br />This movie has so many levels to it, I don't know where to begin.  I tend to focus on the cycling aspect, because it gives me hope that one day I will be able to do something cycling related.  Whenever I lose my motivation to go out for a ride, I just have to think of Dave and his love of cycling and I'm ready to go again.<br />It's not just a sports movie at all, though.  The interaction between characters.  Kids and parents not understanding eachother, but still caring, relationships between friends, and not wanting to fulfill certain expectations:  they all have a place in this movie.  I can honestly say that this movie gets to me like no other movie can.  Anyone who doesn't feel anything during the race at the end must have a cold, cold heart.<br />The story is great.  Four town kids, who feel like they are living in the shadows of the jocks attending the University in their town, who call them cutters because their parents worked for the quary, cutting stone, get by and eventually win their dignity.  One's a dreamer, searching for love and riding his bike.  The other is the brother of a cop, who can't stand living in that shadow.  Of course there's the joker.  And the little guy, who gets in over his head, but will never give up.  This may sound like a trite description, but each character has something that everyone will relate to, and that makes each character so alive.<br />I cannot recommend this movie enough.  If you liked Chariots of Fire, Stand by Me, or any other movies like that, I feel confident that you will like this.  And don't worry, it's so much better than American Flyers.
B00004XONN|5.0|do you have to have a meaning when you listen to a song? for those who are trying to analyze this band and their spectacular music are missing the point. for me it's just enough that i enjoy their music, and if anything that comes afterwards is just gravy. as for kid a being a new approach for RH, it shouldn't be any surprise to anyone epescially their most ardent fans...liking something is a choice, being forced to like it is another. RH....keep up the good work!
0679879269|5.0|The final book in Philip Pullman's Dark Materials trilogy, The Amber Spyglass is an amazing book. It picks up right where the Subtle Knife left off, with Will searching for Lyra, who has mysteriously disappeared.<br />In The Amber Spyglass, many old characters return: Roger, Iorek, Serafina Pekkala, and Mary Malone, and new characters are introduced, like the Gallevespians and the Mulefa.<br />I won't tell you anything about the book itself, because I think you should read it, whoever you are. It is definitely a good read, especially if you've read the other two books in the trilogy.

6305313687|5.0|It's very hard to put into words how this movie makes me feel, because each and every time I watch it, I am swept away by how powerful and influential it is. Bigotry is an ever-growing boorishness in our society and young Americans are easily induced into believing that one sex or one race is better than the other. It is scary to think that one man alone can be responsible for such wide-spread hatred, but this movie only proves that you need but a few people of similar thinking to spread the word and build your biased militia. The story is told through the eyes of Derek Vinyard's younger brother Danny (Edward Furlong), an impressionable adolescent who idolizes his brother's power of persuasion and blindly consigns to his discriminatory views.<br />Derek (Edward Norton) has reasonable predisposed opinions of African-Americans: his firefighting father was murdered by one of them while sousing a blaze in an impoverished quarter of Venice Beach, California. From the immediate point of this personal tragedy, his vocation is to spread the belief that foreigners and ethnics are given more rights than hard-working, white Protestants and the solution is now in the hands of the victims: themselves. Thus under the headship of well-known white supremacist Cameron Alexander, Derek builds his legion of racist devotees, deftly christening his growing gang of disillusioned teens the &quot;D.O.C.&quot;. The consequences of these beliefs take a powerful impact on his family when he guns down two Crips trying to steal his truck and is incarcerated for three years. During this time, his fledgling organization continues cultivating under the supervision of Cameron whilst Danny is swallowed into the chaos and adheres to Derek's corrupt ideals.<br />Through his junket in a maximum-security prison, his fellow inmate in the laundry happens to be a young black man interned for a false charge of assault. He breaks down the towering wall of stereotypes that surround his race, making Derek realize his beliefs were largely askew and that he had dissapatedly influenced many innocent people, more importantly his brother. As soon as he is paroled, he is on a mission to sway Danny from the neo-Nazi crew that he himself formulated and to unlearn the harmful ethics he so vigorously preached. This proves to be a difficult task as Danny has been completely conditioned by the fascist agenda of the D.O.C., posing a grueling solution: Derek must confront Cameron and confess to Danny the agonizing incident that induced his miraculous epiphany behind bars.<br />Edward Furlong is excellent here, showing there is a deeper acting power lurking in him than such flops as &quot;Brainscan&quot;, &quot;Detroit Rock City&quot; and &quot;Pet Sematary II&quot;. He plays his character with impressive range and doesn't inflate Danny's Nazi disposition to a ridiculous degree and balances his emotional outbursts to an acceptable median. Beverly D'Angelo and newcomer Jennifer Lien turn in top-notch performances as Derek's distraught mother Doris and his educated, fiercely liberal sibling Davina. I have to say I was surprised to see Ethan Suplee as Derek's narrow-minded companion Seth after the bawling dimwit he played in Kevin Smith's critical flop &quot;Mallrats&quot;. Some other famous faces included Stacy Keach as the indomitable Cameron Alexander, Avery Brooks as the laissez-faire counselor Bob Sweeney, and the former Mr. Streisand Eliot Gould as the Jewish boyfriend Murray. Who I was not surprised to see playing the brainwashed girlfriend Stacey is Fairuza Balk, a veteran of such bizarre films as &quot;Return To Oz&quot;, &quot;The Island Of Dr. Moreau&quot; and &quot;The Craft&quot;. She definetely fits the character description with her willingness to buzz her raven locks and wear unattractive appliques to the most noticeable parts of her face. She's one in a million, and I have to say she was wonderful.<br />Who really turns this film and its audience upside down is Edward Norton. A colossal performance anchoring this recycled theme, Edward brings the stereotypical skinhead to life with horrifying realism, pushing the limits with Derek's loutish temperament and blissful ignorance. He spews the Nazi-esque propaganda with nary a flaw or pause, his powerful preaching frightening convincing at times. I found myself nodding my head in agreement in the scene where he complained about &quot;border jumpers&quot; vying for American jobs and the citizens of our country receiving inadequate support in their growing poverty because of invading foreigners. I thought how incredible it was that I had been swayed as easily as his audience of teenagers on these issues, but not on others (believing I am supreme because I'm a Catholic Caucasian). This is a sign of an amazing writer, one who harbors an autocratic power that is channeled through this mesmerizing and credible character.<br />Tony Kaye's artistic brilliance lent this film an emotive and metaphorical leg, curbing the abhorrent pretense with ingenious merit and poetic essence. The black and white segments are purposely applied to convey the mindset of its protaganist. The film finishes with the full-color portions of the beach, suggesting to the audience that everyone (characters and viewers) is illuminated as a result. Many complained that this artsy approach hampered the grisly subject matter, but I think it balanced a delicate scale of mindless violence by reintroducing humanity with our fragile existences. Overall, &quot;American History X&quot; shows us that violence is an infinite circle that traverses far and wide but always comes back to haunt us.Norton.

B000007WK4|4.0|From the opening track Square Peg Round Hole, there is a scent in the air that Chris Rea still knows how to punch out a great tune.  With his trademark gravelly vocals and superb slide guitar, you know that Rea can always deliver.  With songs such as On The Beach and Let's Dance, Chris Rea found success, using simple melodies and riffs to create wonderful music.  The Blue Cafe is no different - from the slide guitar on As Long As I Have Your Love to the upbeat rhythm of the title track, Chris Rea still performs excellently.  Highlights of the album include the riffy Square Peg, the Bond-esque strings of Shadows Of The Big Man and even the solo of Thinking Of You will make the most earnest toe tap.  It is true that this album, whilst being musically terrific, also has something for everyone, so it would be hard not to like this if you aren't a fan already!! Definite entertainment.
B00004XQP4|5.0|Warning doesn't match up to Dookie, but the CD is still great.  Their first CD in three years, Warning shows that Green Day can be grouchy, funny, serious, and gloomy all at the same time. What's very brilliant of Green Day is that they have a few power chords that they play over and over.  And the songs are catchy that way.  I was at a concert and Billy Joe asked anyone who played the guitar for him on stange and all he did was play 5 chords in the same order.  Anyway, about the music, it's unique and all of them are very catchy.  Green Day and Blink 182 are the best punk rockers out there.

B000005IU2|5.0|Rock and roll has evolved over the years. New bands borrowing on what had gone before, building on the riffs that they blasted out on their stereos as kids.<br />Without this album, Rock would not exist in its current form. This album spawned a million garage bands. Kids who would never have dreamed of being musicians said &quot;Why not?&quot;. They picked up a guitar and went BANG. They made music. They knew that the rules didn't exist anymore, cause Iggy did exist.<br />It's THAT important. If you don't have this album then you just don't get it. <br />Buy it. Play it. Play it very loud.

B000007VCM|5.0|Sure people still love Sanctuary but what about the rest of this cd.  This was a great guitar album when nobody in the alternative market was doing it anymore.  There is a reason that The Cult are such big influences even today.  They made great rock and roll.<br />This cd is darker than their others and has a great sound.  The guitar just grooves.  You don't hear this sound very often.  This cd still has a fresh sound after 15 years.
0780626478|4.0|I didn't see this movie when it was in the theaters- nor did I have much desire to even rent it- largely because the TV commercials promoting its release did not do it justice (and because most of Brendan Fraser's films have not done well financially or critically).  So I was pretty surprised when I finally did see it and found that it was witty and much more intelligent than I expected.<br />Adam (named after the biblical first man on earth, since his parents believed they were the only survivors of the &quot;blast&quot; that kept them locked in their amazingly well-stocked shelter for 35 years, waiting for the radiation to clear) is sent out into the real world for supplies when his father suffers a heart attack.  After his inital shock at seeing the sky for the first time, exploring the supermarket, and riding the bus, he meets Eve by chance at a baseball card store.  (She prevents him from getting ripped off by the store owner, who is trying to buy Adam's extremely valuable 60's cards for a fraction of their worth).  Reluctantly (for Eve, not for the puppydog-ish Adam), the two gradually become friends as Adam persuades Eve to help him gather groceries and other staples... never really revealing why it is he needs so much stuff.  By the time Eve finds out about Adam's past, even the fact that she (briefly) thinks he's clinically insane can't stop her from falling for him.  <br />Of course, this whole story line is completely unbelievable, but that's part of the fun.  It's amusing to see how Los Angeles grows, changes, and decays above-ground while things remain stuck in a 60's time-warp down below.  (And can someone please explain how this family of three managed to live down there for 35 years without killing each other?)  Also humorous is the side-story of the down-on-his-luck guy (an employee of the various businesses occupying the space above the shelter over the years) who is there to witness Adam's arrival into the real world, and builds a whole religion out of worshipping his new god.  (It's funnier than it sounds).  I must also say I disagree with ... claim that Alicia Silverstone is poorly cast as Eve.  Though her character could have been more well-rounded and personable, I think Alicia did a fine job with the role (and her hair looked great, by the way).<br />All in all, a creative, sweet, and funny movie.

B000002GBJ|4.0|If you are a big fan of keyboard-drenched songs, this album is close to heaven. Rick Wakeman's playing is masterful as always, and the songs are wonderfullyarranged and produced; this is one of the rare older CDs with excellent sound quality.  Wakeman is not the only star, either. The other instruments (guitar, bass, etc.) all stand out at times, and drums are particularly excellent. All the songs are good. This is a must for Wakeman fans, and many others should check it out.
0553213105|4.0|Mrs. Bennet was a simple woman, with but one goal in life: to get her daughters married.  She went about this task in a dedicated manner, pouncing on every man that comes by, from nobles to officers.  Marriage was the only option for a respectable girl and the husband had to be chosen with care.  We usually automatically make the assumption that the love and marriage go hand in hand.  But at one time a marriage was thought of as a business transaction.  Wealth and social standing were thought of first and foremost, love and happiness could come afterward.  Any wealthy bachelor was \\"considered the rightful property of some one or other of their daughters.\\"  Elizabeth Bennet thought she knew better, for a happily ever after there had to be love and understanding.  We follow her misadventures in search of happiness with a range of comical characters from her assertive, matchmaking mother to her arrogantly, meek cousin.  Marriage, it seems, is more than both an economic decision and an emotional rush.  We are given examples of each of these extremes through Elizabeth's sisters.  Through this and Austen's humor and wit, we are given a delightful satire of the British matrimonial arrangements.
0811826848|5.0|&quot;Anthology&quot; is THE ultimate Beatle artifact. Anyone who loves the Beatles will be blown away by this 368 page monster packed with hundreds of rare photos and the real story behind the music as told by John, Paul, George and Ringo. True, thousands of books have been written about the Beatles but, &quot;Anthology&quot; is the first to be written BY the Beatles. That's what makes this book so refreshing and unique.<br />Everything--and I mean EVERYTHING -- from their Liverpool upbringing through their bitter 1970 breakup is discussed and debated. Ironically, the Beatles often disagree on the details of their historic career. For instance John always claimed that the Beatles smoked pot at Buckingham Palace while being awarded the MBE by the Queen in 1965. George, however, says it never happened. John claims to have written the classic &quot;In My Life&quot; all by himself, while Paul swears it was a collaboration! Such tid-bits -- and there are many of them -- are what makes &quot;Anthology&quot; so much fun to read. <br />The book is adorned with hundreds of beautiful, glossy photos -- many of which have never been seen by the public. Most impressive are rare color shots from the Canary Islands in '63, Miami, New York and Tahiti in '64 and India in '66 and '68. <br />&quot;Anthology&quot; is truly breathtaking in terms of content and scope. I suspect it will take many months to fully disect and digest the wealth of information contained within its pages. This is a truly remarkable piece of work that I would highly recommend to anyone whose life was changed by the Beatles and their fabulous music. Five stars are not enough.

B00004XONN|5.0|Radiohead is not for the everyday rock/pop listener.  If you are drawn to music that conjures trippy images, much like a good film score, Pink Floyd or Zeppelin 'B' side track can, this album is for you, as well as past work by Radiohead.  I consider their work to be one of the premiere creative influxes of pseudo pop music in the past decade.  Innovative, with a true creative focus (rather than what makes albums sell to the many), Radiohead will be regarded as one of the true alternatives to mass mainstream music.  And &quot;Kid A&quot; is only another example of their creative prowess.  I hope they never achieve total popularity.  To do so would only put Radiohead in the all too simple trend for boring, standardized, and fabricated pop music. Listeners need to listen before they finally get what's going on.<br />Thanks from Seattle.
B00004XONN|3.0|Im not a big fan of Radiohead but i have heard many songs of them. My biggest favourites is &quot;Karma Police&quot;, &quot;Creep&quot;, and &quot;Street Spirit&quot;. These songs is totally great. These songs is very strong and catchy, and very athmospheric, and has good lyrics, and good music too, whith some mixed sounds. And good lyrics to. im gonna buy the albums, &quot;The Bends&quot;, and &quot;Ok Computer&quot;, the best albums of Radiohead. Bono in U2-(big fan of them)- likes Radiohead, and thats a inspiration for me. Kid A is a very strange record, it has many difficult sounds, and is mixing techno whith pop and whith a little bit of rock, but mostly a poptechno record. This record can be very difficult to listen to. But its a good album. Buy it. Its good enough. But its a little bit overrestimated album. Thanks.
B000002J1M|4.0|Foxtrot was the first classic Genesis album I heard, and it's definitely one of the best Genesis albums, and the start of taking their musical creativity and experimentation to new heights.  Songs like Watcher of the Skies and Suppers Ready are classic, and Horizons shows that Steve Hackett is right up there in the league with his comtemporaries like Steve Howe.  Terrific album.
B00001MXWX|5.0|Trek at it's best, this movie I thought was very entertaining.  It had a good blend of action and comedy, plus had a good plot. I recommend any fan of non-fan who has not seen it, see it.   It has some of the best special effects I have ever seen in a movie(except Star Wars episode 1).  For an odd film, It is a worthy Star Trek movie.
B000002UJQ|5.0|After going through the high that was The Bends, I must admit there was a slight letdown when I first listened to OK Computer, but as the years have gone by, I am starting to rank this album right up there with The Bends.  Each album has music that is unlike anything I've heard, and Radiohead has definitely evolved into a band like no other with a sound of their own.
B00000DD2D|5.0|Jimmy Rogers was second guitarist in Muddy Waters' classic lineup, which also included harpist Little Walter and bassists Big Crawford or Willie Dixon.  As a solo artist, Rogers used these musicians (minus Waters) to record his classic sides for Chess in the Fifties.  If you don't already own the two-disc The Complete Chess Recordings, that would be the logical place to start.<br />But as a tribute to one of Chicago's greatest bluesmen (Rogers died in 1997 before this album's release), Blues Blues Blues is a great collection of songs.  The idea of coupling an aging blues musician with superstar guests is nothing new.  Chess Did it with its London Sessions series in the early Seventies, and John Lee Hooker has made a career out of it since releasing The Healer back in 1989.  While this type of recording tends to be something of a mixed bag, Blues Blues Blues is an overall success.<br />Rogers is still in fine voice even into his seventies.  And guest artists are top-notch.  Guest vocalists (who share lead vocals with Rogers on all tracks) include Robert Plant, Eric Clapton, Mick Jagger and Taj Mahal. Lead guitar is provided by Clapton, Keith Richards, Jimmy Page and Jeff Healey.  Either Kim Wilson or Carey Bell plays harmonica on most tracks.<br />Whether the band is performing Rogers' originals like &quot;That's All Right&quot; and &quot;Luedella,&quot; or classic blues songs like Waters' &quot;Trouble No More&quot; or Jimmy Reed's &quot;Bright Lights Big City,&quot; they play with authority and conviction.<br />While the album was recorded as a celebration of Rogers' contribution to the blues, it serves as a fitting tribute.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED
B000002J1C|5.0|Although I consider Fragile to be the best Yes album, that's not to say that The Yes Album doesn't come close to it.  Full of classic tracks that we all know and love, this ushered in the Steve Howe era with a bang.  Yours Is No Disgrace is terrific where anyone will immediately recognize its opening notes (as Bruford once joked on a documentary that it's &quot;straight-up Bonanza&quot;).  Starship Trooper:  what can I say other than it blows your mind away.  This album is a must listen for any beginning listener of Yes music.
B000002U82|5.0|From 1967-1970 when Syd Barrett was fighting off the throes of madness, he was trying to record with the then five piece Floyd, music that would transcend the barriers of time and space.  During the &quot;Obscured by Clouds/Saucer Full of Secrets&quot; sessions towards the end of Syd's tenure in the Floyd, Syd off-handedly suggested using a horn section and a chorus of backing vocals on some of the tracks for enhancement.  There was no doubt that by this point Syd was mad, but Waters and the rest of the group just sort of shrugged off Syd's suggestions and shortly after ousted him from the group he founded for reasons well known.  It is somewhat ironic that six years later Waters and Co. produced &quot;The Dark Side of the Moon&quot; laden with wailing background vocals and saxophone solos.  Syd may have been mad but he was still a genius and light years ahead of anyone remaining in the tightly regimented Floyd, especially Waters.  It is undeniable that &quot;The Dark Side of the Moon&quot; is a classic, a fantasic album with lush soundscapes and poignant lyrics, but again who was the catalyst and inspiration for this album, Syd Barrett of course.  So, to all of the Pink Floyd fans who think that this is the peak of the band, I'm sorry to say it's not. (SEE The Piper at the Gates of Dawn).
B000002UR7|3.0|This is Radiohead in their raw unrefined state, but you could get the sense of bigger things to come that Radiohead was going to be more than just another band coming out with the grunge sound during the time bands like Nirvana and Pearl Jam were at the height of their popularity.  Not a great album, but worth listening to.
B00003W8NM|5.0|OK first off, if you want a movie that's just fighting and violence then this is not for you.  But if you want a movie that's full of dark black humor and lines that will stay with us forever then you're in luck.  Edward Norton is at his finest playing an insomniac who goes to support groups as a means to fall asleep, and later ends up creating his own (Fight Club).  Along the way he runs into Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt's best role since True Romance) and that's when the fun really starts.  I don't want to get to into it because that would ruin some great scenes but watch for a cameo by the lead singer of Live.  The commentary is great with Edward Norton and David Fincher (Brad is pretty witty himself) but I could do without Helena Bonham Carter's commentary.  She's too full of herself and I think that she had to do it seperatlly because the others hated her... that's what I think at least.  The internet promos are cool, the public service announcements are to die for, plus the Spanish adds are cool.  You can even see a few adds they geared towards women.  There is a nice video for the Dust Brothers video (watch it after the movie) and pictures of the promo catalog that they gave out to hype the film.  The booklet on how to start a fight is one of the few DVD booklets worth reading.  All and all this is why they made DVD players, for all the bonus material.  So much they made two discs.
B000002TQV|5.0|That's all I can say about this album.  A brilliant album sonically and lyrically, and it showed they were evolving into more than just the regular kind of rock band.  An absolute must for your definitive collection of album's of the 90's.
B0000024JA|4.0|Positives: Method Man has an extremely huge amount of talent and potential and this is made clear on his first album. This record has a much rougher and alternative sound compared to most rap and his own clan's stuff too. &quot;Release Yo Delf&quot; is my favorite track on the album because it's a song that'll really pump you up. It's nice to wake you up in the morning. The mysteriousness of Method Man is a puzzling aspect of him. You never feel like you're hearing all Meth really has to say.<br />Negatives: There are only a few tracks that are a little weak and sometimes the beats and his flow are too &quot;old-school&quot; for me. Meth comes off in most of his raps as not really saying anything and having no message. I find that a lot of the time this is what it seems like but sometimes you just don't get what he's saying immediately. Give it a few plays before making up your mind.
B000002J1X|4.0|Yes was still finding their way on this album.  The use of strings was very brave to say the least, but you got the sense of what they were going to become.  From covering Richie Havens' &quot;No Opportunity Necessary, No Experience Needed&quot; to 60's psychedelia like &quot;Astral Traveller&quot; and &quot;Then&quot;, they were in the midst of experimentation.  The obvious sense of change was on the album cover when they used a portrait of the band that included new guitarist Steve Howe instead of original guitarist Peter Banks.  I personally like the album because of how different it was.
B000002AHM|5.0|The word Duende is best translated as &quot;divinely inspired&quot;, and is used by the Spanish to classify exceptional perfomances. In a manner of speaking the artist transforms into an instrument of the Gods. Never before have I listen to a CD that, within the limitations of the medium, succeeds this well in capturing and transferring this experience to its audience. Well, just listen to the RealAudio example of the Mediterranean Sundance, and remember that this is just a prelude to a truely exceptional performance.<br />Especially if you have a high-end HiFi set you must be prepared to get blown away by man's ability to create this kind of music from some lumps of wood with some strings attached to it :).
B000002J1O|5.0|This is classic Gabriel-era Genesis at its very best, and the best of each band member comes out on this album.  The music is melodic and the lyrics are sopisticated and unsurpassed.  Dancing with the Moonlit Knight and Cinema Show are my personal favorites.  It also signals the debut of Phil's singing talent with More Fool Me.<br />I consider this to be the greatest Genesis album.  Oh, how I wish that the classic lineup will someday get back together and tour.
B00000253N|5.0|The best pop/rock album of all time.  Only Van Morrison's Astral Weeks approaches it.  And only barely. Bob is ripping out his own guts and holding them out for all to hear.  If you &quot;get&quot; this album, no explanatiion is necessary . If you don't, no explanation is possible. Long live Dylan.
B00004XONN|4.0|I have to confess I didn't really like the album at first.  But it's growing on me more and more as I listen to it, and it's another brave step that the band has taken in their musical evolution.  That's always been what I've liked about Radiohead; that they're willing to take risks even if there's a chance of alienating some of their fans.  My advice is don't just listen to Kid A once and then decide what you think of it.  My personal favorites are still The Bends and OK Computer, but this one is definitely worthy of being part of their discography.
0767853946|3.0|Bad Boys is yet another action comedy that follows 48 HOURS &amp; the BEVERLY HILLS COP mode. The viloence is a non-stop fury from start to finnish and the profanity that anyone comes to expect films of this nature. This film benefits greatly from Will Smith and Martin Laurence`s chemsitry, as long as they`re on screen together things move along but when they`re apart the film ends losing crediabillty. The film is two hours or so long has more complications it needs.The storyline surounds the theft of millons of dollars worth of drugs confiscated from a Miami Police warehouse by an evil french crimminal named Fouchet,  sounds more like a name for expensive french chocalate than a French crimminal, played awful by Tchelky Karyo. BAD BOYS doesn`t stay focused halfway it comes up with what somebody must have thought was a brilliant move and proceeds to beat it to death for reasons not worth mentioning are forced to switch identies. So the ladies man Mike(Smith) moves in with his partner`s family while Marcus(Laurence)spends day &amp; night at Mike`s place guarding a material witness an attractive annyoning woman(Tea Leoni) From this point its a mix-match of endless guns blazing foul language and the same style of film i`ve seen endless times before.
B000002J23|3.0|Despite the fact that Trevor Horn had the unenviable task of following in Jon Anderson's footsteps, this isn't really that bad of an album, and it's probably unfairly singled out as a bad album by some Yes fans just because Anderson isn't singing on it.  There really isn't a bad track, and the former Buggles (Horn and Downes) did an admirable job of replacing Anderson and Wakeman.  The best tracks are Machine Messiah, Does It Really Happen, and Tempest Fugit.  Give it a listen without having any preconceived notions about it.

B000002J1L|4.0|I never really understood why this album didn't sell when it first came out.  It has some of the best Genesis material.  The Musical Box is definitely a signature tune for the band, and I never get tired of listening to it.  The Return of the Giant Hogweed is one of the many examples of Peter Gabriel's imagination and brainstorming, and the Fountain of Salmacis is an underappreciated track that is brings out much of the best of the group.   I never really appreciated just how good a drummer Phil Collins is until I heard Nursery Cryme.
B00004XONN|4.0|While it may be true that Radiohead can be indulgent and overly experimental, almost to the point to of &quot;wanting&quot; to alienate the listener, let me say, that is the point. The band is doing what they do best, creating, exploring, and blazing a trail through the uncharted territory that is &quot;anti-rock&quot;. Kid A is about resolutions, while OK Computer is about causes. Keep an open mind, and Kid A will grow on you.
B000002J2B|3.0|I consider this the swan song of Genesis as we know it.  This was the last album made before Steve Hackett's departure from the band, and as far as I'm concerned it's been all downhill after that as they enter their commercial &quot;we want hit singles&quot; stage.  Not as good as Trick of the Tail, but Hackett keeps this album afloat.  Blood on the Rooftops is definitely the best song of this album.
B00003CWNR|5.0|Great film. But I've got one question: I have not been able to access any kind of commentary. I was able to view all the other features, the making of, etc. but for some reason on my DVD there is no running commentary alongside the film.<br />Is anyone else having this problem, or am I the only knucklhead out here who can't figure it out? Please advise.<br />Thanks.
B000002J1F|5.0|Roundabout was the first song from the classic Yes era that I ever listened to, and I've been hooked ever since.  In my opinion their best album with the best lineup of Anderson, Squire, Howe, Wakeman and Bruford.  Not only does this album have some of their greatest songs like Heart of the Sunrise and Long Distance Runaround, but you also had tracks that brought out each individual musicians best.  If you want to listen to what is Yes, then Fragile is it.
B000001E18|2.0|Most people think this is U2's worst album, that's because it is. This is the tidemark left by the wave of great music from their career in the 80s that finally broke on this desolate shore. Compared to the scaffold-climbing, flag-waving, rabble-rousing U2 of the 80s, here we have tired old men slouching down the corridors of studios, more worried what the critics will think than the fans. The lyrics are quite good but Johnny Cash sounds like the youngest guy on the record. No wonder U2 are now talking about going &quot;back to basics&quot; with All You Can't Leave Behind.
B000002J27|4.0|Just when you thought they were down when Peter Gabriel departed, Genesis came back with this terrific album.  Each track is enjoyable to listen to, and it still maintains the classic sound of albums past.
6305470464|4.0|If I could meet a lump collective of famous people, a great place to start would be the cast of Playing By Heart.  I don't remember hearing \\"boo\\" about this movie.  Nada, nuttin, zilch.  Every single character is portrayed by a famous actor.  And quite well I might add, I really enjoyed the depth brought to each performance.<br /> Playing By Heart is a relationship movie.  It's also billed as a romantic comedy on the video jacket.  I beg to differ.  It's a drama if I've ever seen one.  Playing By Heart deals with some very complex relationship issues in a direct, honest manner.  The intensity of the relationship formats is engrossing.<br /> The movie is set up in a variety of pairings, not all of which are romantically linked.  The relationships that are romantic, represent a wide spectrum of ages, and stages in such a relationship.<br /> We meet Hannah (Gena Rowlands) and Paul (Sean Connery).  They've been married forty years.  Their relationship is in a state of flux almost from the very start of the movie.  Their story is evidence that, even after all those years of marriage, there are things to discover about your spouse.  The notion that Paul might still be carrying a torch for an old flame is a bone of contention between he and Hannah.  One example of their combativeness is when Paul remarks, \\"It's been almost twenty-four hours since we traded barbs.  We don't want to get rusty do we?\\"<br /> Then there's Joan (Angelina Jolie) and Keenan (Ryan Phillippe).  They are the young, wild twenty-somethings who discover each other in the L.A. club scene.  Keenan is withdrawn and anti-social where Joan is boisterous and the poster child for high drama, her every life event intensely scrutinized for anyone who will listen.  Joan keeps doing her level best to work her way into Keenan's life while he puts forth the same effort pushing her away.  At one point, he finally tells her, \\"This isn't anything.  This will never be anything.\\"     Meredith (Gillian Anderson), on the other hand, pushes men away because of a long history of being burned in relationships, or as she puts it, \\"scalded repeatedly\\".  She is a theatre director who has been keeping herself consumed with work, but when she pulls a bookshelf down on herself at the library, an architect named Trent uses the opportunity to ask her out on a date.<br /> He maintains that, \\"I'm not just asking you out to dinner as a preemptive strike against litigation.\\"  Despite her steadfastness to the contrary, she accepts, saying, \\"Anyone who can say preemptive strike against litigation with a straight face deserves a dinner companion.\\"<br /> Theirs becomes a rollercoaster relationship of her pushing him away and him not accepting her attempts to shut him out.  Meredith makes some interesting observations about the dating process that anyone who is dating or has ever dated may find refreshingly honest.  So much of the dating process is calculated artificiality.  She even admits to Trent, that before their first date, she had been on the phone with her sister coming up with a psychological profile for him.<br /> Perhaps the most intense relationship in the movie is a mother-son pairing.  Mildred (Ellen Burstyn) is the mother to a gay son, Mark (Jay Mohr).  He is in the hospital dying of, it is assumed, AIDS.  His final wishes are to start their relationship over, being honest with each other and sharing some of their thoughts with each other.  She, and the rest of Mark's family, had been in denial about his being gay, and he doesn't want his last days to be full of her denial about his dying.  Some powerful and moving scenes between them.<br /> As a mother with sons, the most moving moment was when he asked her to tell him a story.  He wants to hear the last part of \\"Goodnight Moon\\".  My boys have this book.  We read it quite often.  The thought of speaking those words to one of them as they lay dying in my arms tore through my heart.  She also reflects on the time she was pregnant with him.These are instances that all you moms out there will be hard-pressed not to have tears streaming down your cheeks.<br /> Among the other characters are Gracie (Madeleine Stowe) and Roger (Anthony Edwards), who are both married and having an affair.  There is also Hugh (Dennis Quaid), who spends his nights going from bar to bar, telling tall tales of woe to any woman who will listen to him.  Their relationships are evidence of the understanding one tries to have about what they are doing and why.<br /> Why do some people love each other?  How does it happen?  Joan considers something a friend had told her once.  \\"Talking about love is like dancing about architecture.\\"  She maintains that, however true that statement is, she's still going to try to talk about love anyway.     On the flip side, Paul recalls the advice Joan had given their children about falling in love.  \\"The wonderful thing about falling in love is you learn everything about that person and so quickly.  And if it's true love, then you start to see yourself through their eyes.  And it brings out the best in you.  It's almost as if you're falling in love with yourself.\\"<br /> Playing By Heart is honest and genuine.  Some of the honesty manifests itself in some big-time swearing and sexual innuendo, hence the \\"R\\" rating.     It's a drama in the sense that relationships are dramas with light-hearted comedic moments to equal the playing field.  It's about falling in love.  It's about not wanting to fall in love but falling in love anyway.
B000002NZO|3.0|A very good debut for what we would eventually come to know as the classic Genesis sound.  Even without the contributions of future bandmates Steve Hackett and Phil Collins, this album stands on its own.  Worth listening to, especially for the tracks Visions of Angels, Stagnation, and The Knife.
B00003CXFV|5.0|I've been a fan of Julia's for as long as she has been making movies.  She has truly grown up and is definitely one the hottest hollywood actresses of all time. <br />In this movie she starts out looking for work, with no luck.  Of course her woodrobe left a little to be desired (after all she was basing her roll on a true story).  Then the accident, the lawyer promises she'll win (sound familiar?) but doesn't.  She really fights to get any type of work, and forces her lawyer (the same one who promised she'd win) to give her job. If I tell much more about this movie you wouldn't want to see it because I have spoiled the ending.<br />This is a definite must see movie.  This is definitely an Oscar worthy performance for Julia and I look forward to her at the Oscar's as a nominee.<br />I look forward to her next movie.
630476524X|4.0|I know a lot has been written about this picture.  Some of it is supporting, but most of it is complaining.  I for one thought this was a really good movie.  A lot of the scenes (particularly those with Iggy Pop) have stayed in my head for eternity. I saw this movie before I knew anything about the Crow legacy, and I instantly loved it.  Slowly, I backtracked through the story's history until I watched the original.  Suprisingly, I found that I enjoyed watching The Crow:COA more than the original.  The death of a little kid and his father in the epitome of slums meant more to me than the death of an older couple in Detroit. Finally, I'd like to address Perez's accent.  Yes, it exists, there's no denying that.  But SO WHAT!??!  It makes it seem more realistic.  Not to bash the original film, but there's more credibility in this movie than there was about a rock musican who was killed the night before his wedding.
0451191153|3.0|Ayn Rand is a gifted storyteller.  This is apparent in the first twenty pages.  It is an extremely engaging book with phenomenal characterization and it weaves an interconnected plot which rivets the attention of the reader like few other books can do.  However---the enjoyment of the book is contingent upon the reader's philosophical leanings.  It is, at heart, a philosophical novel, but perhaps one of the best (with the exception of Tolstoy) to erect a philosophical system while keeping the reader fascinated with the characterization.  The final question remains at the end of the book---did I like what Rand said?   For me the answer was unequivocally &quot;no.&quot; Often downright polemical, the book extolls the virtues of the individual will to power.  I am with Rand all the way on the individual will to power, as, like her, I believe it accounts for the evolutionary progress of mankind.  However, the characters representing her philosophies sometimes take on the qualities of caricatures, almost surreal in their embodiment of the ideas Rand has designated them to symbolize. The Fountainhead reveals Rand's fear of the mob, the herds of humanity and their petty desires and motivations.  It champions the spirit of egotism, the rigorous adherence to one's own drives.  But it does so in a way which leaves a bad taste in the mouth of anyone who has ever felt a sense of connection with their fellow human beings.  Unfortunately, it is Rand's political ideology which has put the US in the current position it is in.  1% of the population controls the majority of its wealth.  And hand in hand with the domination of capital come the other &quot;isms&quot; which are cancerous: sexism, racism, classism.  Rand's characters are such patently sexist archetypes, one almost gets the sense that Rand herself has a little self-contempt for being female. Dominique Francon desires her rape, longs to be dominated and crushed into a subhuman existence.  Even the male heroes of the book, despite being the only characters to have &quot;ideals&quot;, are driven underneath it all by the sexual urge.  The book, like capitalist philosophy, essentially takes the low road in terms of its measurement of overall human character. The worst thing I could say about it is that is essentially a document embodying all the darker elements of capitalist ideology and I sincerely believe that it is a justification of all the unfortunate (or fortunate depending upon your power position) conditions that arise from a nation guided by these principles. The best thing I could say about it is that it is an extremely well-written character drama.
0684800713|4.0|This is a wonderful book. The laconic prose can be refreshing. It captures (I assume) the emptiness and indifference of the &quot;lost generation.&quot;  This is evidenced on a textual level by Hemingway's fondness for short, sober sentences devoid of exuberance.  There are moments of emotion, but they are confused, realizing the characters' impotence to express themselves or even know what they are feeling.  The last lines of this book are chilling.
B00000AFGM|5.0|After the long, chaotic night of Antichrist Superstar, Mechanical Animals is the cold, misty dawn following it. Marilyn has not only broken his hard-worn exterior shell, he's been reborn into his own emotions. This album is a very meaningful, and expressive peice of his life where he stepped out into the cold and flushed the world with sadness. &quot;It looked like space, and the stars just glittered like a morgue, but then again aren't we all, Mechanical Animals?&quot;.....
B00003CX59|5.0|Another viewer, Graves, commented on how 'impossible to follow' the story. For a child, I grant you, that is the case. For an adult, though?? Come on. Its not hard to follow at all and it's a very refreshing take on the classic tale by Washington Irving. Now Tim Burton did take some liberties in the story, but so what? I have read the original tale and loved it. I likewise have enjoyed the various adaptations throughout the years, most notably the Disney animated version. Burton was smart, though. He made a totally adult version, blood and all. I thoroughly enjoyed it. The settings were perfect and Johnny Depp shocked me. I thought his performance was immaculate.
B00003CX8J|5.0|I've seen this film 4 times.  I liked it and now am a regular at the local comic book store.  The cast is great and the story is very well thought out. I heard people saying it would never live up to it's comic ncounterpart or it's cartoon series , but I believe that it surpassed everybody's expectations.  if you haven't seen it , go see it and if you've seen it , see it again.  :)
B00003CXDG|5.0|Mission Impossible 2 is the best action movie I saw allsummer. ... . The plot of M:I 2 is excellent, but even if the plot wasn't there, it has some of the best action scenes ever. Probobly has the best motorcycle chase scene. Cruise is the perfect star to play Ethan Hunt and the girl in the film would beat among the best Bond girls. See this now!  You won't regret it.

B000020617|5.0|The Foo Fighters are proof positive that rock is not dead.  Dave Grohl and company rock and they rock hard.  And to all of you who say it's not &quot;hard&quot; enough:  grow up.  Grohl has.  His songwriting has evolved to give the Foos style all their own.  He is serious about music, unlike too many acts today.  Every song on this album is great.  The ones you hear on the radio, with the exception of &quot;Learn to Fly,&quot; are in my opinion, the weakest.  You want punk rock:  &quot;Stacked Actors.&quot;  You want great guitar rock:  &quot;Generator.&quot;  You want insightful, yet catchy songs:  &quot;Aurora&quot; or &quot;M.I.A.&quot;  Do yourself a favor and get into one of the few great rock bands left.
B00003CWL6|5.0|I think that &quot;American Beauty&quot; is one of the best movies I've seen in a long time. It is so beautifully done and definitely deserved every single award it has recieved. There is also a great ensemble cast including Kevin Spacey and Annette Bening who make the screen light up and make you anticipate what is going to happen. I will definitely add this to my DVD collection. Excellent!  10/10!
0790720434|5.0|If you love the book, this movie will completely deliver on your expectations.  If you've never read the book, this movie still has plenty to offer--it's visually stunning, a magical historic drama, a fabulous performance from the great Maggie Smith (as well as from the rest of the very well chosen cast).<br />This movie makes great rainy day viewing, and will be a hit among adults, kids, and period-romantic drama.
B00000J6AG|5.0|This is one of the most interesting albums I've ever come across. Most of the songs really feel like extended samples, but all of them are really cool to listen to. Every song has a different beat and style than all of the other songs. This will be like nothing you've heard before. Natural Blues and Bodyrock are two of the singles from the CD which you can listen to over and over again. What is so great about this CD is that you can listen to this CD straight throught without even skipping. Get it now!!
0553106635|4.0|Martin's world has successively darkened over the three volumes of his saga; in this book, terror, gloom and shadows are prevalent. Death is an every-day companion to all. Martin is not afraid to kill main characters, which adds spice to an already captivating plot. While Martin's device of writing each chapter from the perspective of a different main character continues to fragment the storyline, taking away some of its continuity and emotional punch, he manages to integrate the chapters better in the latter half of the book. There were too many viewpoint characters, however -- Samwell's endless trudging through the snow and Lord Davos' brief interludes fell rather flat. Arya also seemed to go in circles, mostly, and Bran's wanderings and dreams added nothing new. On the plus side, Jaime was an interesting addition, Daenerys' chapters were among the best, and Jon and Sansa well-written. Unfortunately, it is easy to see which characters Martin is most enamoured with -- I would be very surprised if any of them died.<br />Overall, it was an enjoyable read. While Martin upped the level of violence in this book, it fit into this bleak world, and was compensated by a few small, beautifully evoked triumphs of the protagonists.
6304698526|5.0|Forget &quot;Gone in Sixty Seconds&quot; it's implausible and terribly acted. &quot;Ronin&quot; (Robert DeNiro) is pretty good. But &quot;Bullitt&quot; is the best, gritty and real. It still has THE best chase footage. It's an intergral part of the story line, unlike most movies now that include chase seens out of habit. Steve McQueen is subtle and brilliant. Robert Vaugh is cool evil personified. It has it's technical glitches(How can a car loose 6 wheel covers?)that have added to it's mystique over the last 32 years.
0553269631|5.0|This book is so lovely.  McCullers has an incredibly unpretentious way of writing that never preens or demands attention, but the cumulative effect of this book is amazing.  It is definitely a &quot;Southern&quot; book, and I read it before ever reading Faulkner, Capote, or O'Connor, so its blend of the grotesque and tragic had a tremendous effect on me.  This effect might be lost on readers who are already steeped in the Southern style. A lot about the characters is suggested but never said, particularly the cafe owner's dubious sexuality, and this unstated quality adds real texture to the characters.  In the hands of a contemporary writer, this story would have devolved into identity politics, but McCullers is a real writer, as interested in the individual heart as well as the social.  She earns the added distinction as being the only white writer I've ever read who created complex, sympathetic but multi-dimensional black characters.  Highly recommended.

B00004XONN|5.0|They always seem to amaze me!  I have been a fan for a few years and as always, their music just grows on ya!  At first listen, didn't know what to think...but ya know...you got to give it to Radiohead!  Kid A is a great album.  Here you have a band who does not give a crap of what the general audience thinks, they just put out brilliant music for the true Radiohead fans out there.  This album is different from anything you have heard before, which is a good thing.  Why would Radiohead put out an album that is just like OKC?  These guys are true artist and write/play the type of music that they want to and they do it because...they can!  Anyone who will consider not purchasing this album based on the one-star reviews, are the ones who will miss out on a brilliant album.  As with all Radiohead albums, the songs grow on ya!  And if you don't keep the cd in for at least a week, you are not a true music fan, nor a die-hard Radiohead FAN!  Go buy this abulm!   Simply, pack a big one and slip into the world of Kid A!
B00004XONN|4.0|The tracks on Kid A  showcase Radiohead's rhythm section rather than its vocalist or its guitarist.  Even on the slower tunes, there is a sense of panic that, for once, isn't eased by a soaring Yorke vocal or a Big Rock Riff. A good choice, and one that makes this album as unique (and dare I say thematically complete) as OK Computer and the Bends were.  <br />Devoid of single material, the album is deliberately non-radio-ready.  And this step away from salesmanship is a good one, I think.  Not solely because I'm protective of bands I like, but because the band has not always successfully straddled the line separating irony from self-loathing.  Anyone who's seen Radiohead perform a &quot;hit&quot; like Creep live to a stadium crowd of fist-pumping, weightlifting drunk teens 'n' twenties knows what I mean.   Nothing against being young and happy, but if you mature and your music doesn't, you'll soon become Tom Jones.<br />As for me, I plan to listen a few more times before deciding whether Yorke's underwater vocal lines can really be as infectious as they seemed during the first few trips round the disc.
B00003CWTI|5.0|MAGNOLIA<br />Paul Thomas Anderson made a small, thoughtful film a few years back, the film Hard Eight (which he calls Sydney) is an earnest little movie that introduced his fluid camera work and ear for dialogue to an world still charged with a Tarantino need for quick words, quick violence all wrapped in a shimmery, ultra-bright package. (NOTE:  Don't get me wrong--I saw Pulp Fiction three times at the multiplex... IN ONE DAY!)<br />No one knew what was on the horizon.<br />Then, BAM! BOOGIE NIGHTS. It cracked. It sizzled. It lasted nearly three, count 'em, THREE HOURS. But we stayed with it, rode it out, and loved the outcome. P.T. Anderson had arrived. And we loved him. He gave us a rush that our Tarantino-less days needed, desired, craved. <br />Then, last Christmas, the next magnum opus from Mr. Anderson graced the silver screen. This multi-character driven story spanning three hours (P.T. must tie his editor in the corner or something) of gut wrenching melodrama that would probably cause  Rob Altman to pee his pants in delight over (and the illustrous maverick director wasn't the only one wet) made the dreary Christmas season a true treat for me. Anderson's present was more than I could have ever hoped for.<br />I loved the film on several levels. The prologue jarred me to attention, the suicide/murder a sight to behold. The actors moved me, from Robard's death rattling coot to Cruise's crazed sex god to Moore's drug addled trophy wife to Macy's braces obsessed former kid genius, it seemed like one big muclear (bomb) family of losers that were as real as they come. And finally the story kept me from looking at my watch one time, spinning tendrils of joy and despair to all the characters involved until the bottom falls out (or the sky, I guess) and redemption comes creeping 'round the corner for all. Great film. <br />The movie also has the endearing quality that makes a movie a classic--It gets better every time you see it. This final fact is what makes the double DVD such a sensation.<br />The documentary, MAGNOLIA DIARY, is worth the price of admission alone. To see Anderson nearly have a nervous breakdown during the course of filming Magnolia, to hear old timer Robards anecdote on the big gila monster, to see the performance art piece involving P.T. and girlie Fiona Apple (who plays the part of the berated film(!) MAGNOLIA) is wonderful. I loved it also.<br />The other extras are nice as well, anything tacked onto such a fine DVD as Magnolia is more than welcome in my book.<br />Thank you Mr. Anderson. Bravo! Can't wait to see the next one (it'll probably be two days long, but I'll probably love it all the same).<br />Now, to get back to the subject of Quentin's absence...
B000031WYP|5.0|Wagner's Parsifal to the tunes of Mascagni's Cavalleria rusticana would be a good slogan for this recording. Karajan's massive, overpowering but sensitive conducting bestows the score with a rapt luminescence rarely heard in this piece.  It has to be one of the slowest Cavallerias on record (the composer's own version a strong contender). The well-cast singers are totally committed and moving but never vulgar.  The recording is absolutely first rate.
B00004RFFU|4.0|How is it that very few books become top movies? Interview With the Vampire is alluring enough as a book, the movie even more seductive. When I first saw the movie I cried for Louis and continue to do so when ever I watched it. No part was left out, but I just wish that the makers could of used the same filming technique that was used in Sleepy Hollow. The pain of a vampire that can feel as humans do that is just sheer talent. An actor that can portray that vampire that is just charisma. Kirsten Dunst showed us an exact copy of Claudia and how we all feel. The vampire tale is not the usual Dracula version. The emtion and hope that was put into this amkes everyone think. Perhaps I think more than others do, but can we not see ourselves be like these creatures in some ways? We all have the selfish side, we are all tormented by something, we are all cold and ucaring in some way. We are truly vampires in certain ways.

B00004Y6TQ|5.0|There's not much to criticize about this glorius EP/Album/Soundrack, except that perhaps it would be best to see the equally stunning film (DANCER IN THE DARK) before listening to it.  The only other thing is that this is not an exact document of the music in the film.  Most of the songs are remixed and do not include some of the actor's voices from the film.  Although I love the way the film's music is presented on this album, I would also like to have a recording of the film versions of these songs.  Otherwise this is another fine example of Bjork's musical genius.  I particularly love the songs, &quot;I've Seen It All,&quot; &quot;Cvalda,&quot; and &quot;In the Musicals&quot; - that's almost all the songs!  Just buy this album and enjoy.
B00004T37H|5.0|Most animation movies portray extreme courage or self power. Very rarely we see a movie about balance, and this one is about our own backyard - Nature. It's a New Age type movie with a very powerful meaning.
B000002UAX|5.0|either this or Abbey Road.  I'm not sure which is my favorite.  The White Album has so many types of music...so no matter what your in the mood for theirs probably something on the White Album that you'll like. Rock Jazz Heavy Metal Classical<br />and so on......While My guitar Gently Weeps might be the best song on the album.  Despite it's criticism I also like Revolution 9.
079284632X|5.0|I am a huge fan of horror films. That being understood,I would not classify this as a horror movie. In fact, I don't know what I would classify this as. It's part horror, part exploitation, part action, part drama, and part slapstick.<br />I found it very disturbing and graphic in its depictions of humiliation and savagery. The violence in this film is so gritty and in your face that you can't help but feel as helpless as the films young victims. The film shows no remorse at all for the torture inflicted on the helpless young women, and that is probably why people have such a strong response to this movie.<br />Do yourself a favor and buy this film. It pushes all of the right buttons in your psyche to make you writhe at the torture of the victims, and at the same time love the villans as only a true horror fan can.
B000002UDB|5.0|Sandwiched between Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band (perhaps the Beatles' finest album) and &quot;The White Album,&quot; the Beatles' Magical Mystery Tour remains one of the most forgotten and neglected albums in the Beatles' impressive catalogue. Recorded at the zenith of their career, it is still an impressive collection of songs. In spite of a mostly forgettable movie, the soundtrack contains two gems: &quot;The Fool on the Hill&quot; and &quot;I Am the Walrus&quot; (for some, possibly the greatest song the group ever recorded). Throw in &quot;Penny Lane&quot; and &quot;Strawberry Fields Forever&quot; and you have the Beatles about as good as they get. You won't be disappointed: buy this one!
068484267X|2.0|But I was glad when I got to the end. God, it bored me.
0671004107|5.0|Yes, I admit, I saw the movie before I read the book.  The movie took some serious liberties with the book, presumably to make it translate better to a film (i.e. stepped-up sex, violence, and controversy).  The written word, however, can go to depths that the film can not.<br />The character of Ellie Arroway is fleshier and juicier when we are allowed into her most intimate thoughts.  A friend of mine, upon seeing me reading the book remarked that the movie was &quot;boring&quot; and that it &quot;dragged&quot;.  I found the movie and the book intriguing because Sagan delves deeper into questions I've pondered about in the wee hours of the morning with roommates and close friends and asks the questions that never even entered our minds.  Sagan probes the relationship between religion and science and the mutual animosity its respective champions have for each other and their doctrines.<br />The building of the Machine sent (by extraterrestrials from Vega) as a plan over radio waves is almost a secondary plot thread, taking a back seat to more pressing political, theological, and scientific concerns.  Imagine receiving this plan in today's world.  How many people would assume it was a doomsday machine, or from the devil, or that it was a summons that could not be ignored from a higher technology?  How many people would insist we build the Machine, and how many would insist that we should not?  How does the world-wide community reconcile its differences, and &quot;get along&quot; so the Machine, which can not be done by one country alone, be built?  Fascinating and thought-provoking for me, apparently 'boring' for others, I recommend it wholeheartedly.
6305897786|2.0|I watched this film twice during two days because I thought that I had missed something the first time, I hadnt. When I finished watching it the second time I realised that either A)Polanski had left tons of stuff out or B)The ending was bad to begin with. You are presented with numerous clues that you try to solve along the way which is fun, But by the time you get to the end you have more questions than answers. If only the ending matched the rest of the movie. I think I will read the book.....
0441172717|5.0|One of my all-time favorite novels, I cannot say enough good things about it. It's a book that every science fiction fan will instantly fall in love with. It's the kind of book you can also read over and over, and you will find new meanings each time.<br />The novel follows the young Duke Paul Atreides in his feud with the rival noble house of Harkonnens. The politics in this universe of the future are complex as well as very deadly. In addition, every family in the galaxy is driven by their greed over the addictive spice that is mined from the planet Arrakis, or Dune. A mind-enhancing drug, the spice is expensive, difficult and dangerous to mine, and very valuable. Whoever controls the spice calls the shots.<br />Paul and his mother become outcasts after the Harkonnens raid their home on Dune and kill the old Duke. Then begins the adventure which transforms Paul into a legend in his own time. Throw in suspicious natives, a demented baron Harkonnen, an Atreides traitor, ancient rituals, psychic abilities and giant sand worms and you've got a definite page-turner by a fabulous writer. If you'rea sci-fi fan and haven't read this book, you're truly missing out!
B0000027RL|5.0|WOW! What a powerful album. If you don't own this one do yourself a favor and get it, now! Pearl Jam and Nirvana were the pioneers of a generation of new music, Grunge. &quot;Nevermind&quot; and &quot;Ten&quot; are the 2 albums that started it all. Eddie Vedder's song writing is raw and emotional. The music is great. Sit back and enjoy the classic music that capsulizes generation X.
0805062971|5.0|This book was turly written for the disenchanted generation X, quite often you find Mr. Palahniuk slipping into a poetry with his words and the way it is written is even more interesting that the story itself. When I was half way throught the copy I got from the libary, I wanted to hurry to return it so the next person could read it.<br />The book is not really about business men fighting to a pulp. It is turly about the freedom of hoplessness. If you aren't afraid of going to prision then you can break the law with impunity, if you aren't afarid of living in a condemed building then you aren't afraid of losing your job and yes, if you aren't afraid of getting hurt then you aren't afraid of getting hurt.<br />The book follows the life of the main character who is never identified by name, and it takes you over the pointlessness of his life and how he longs to die in a midair collision. There is nothing that is presented in life that seems to be of any importance, he has grown angery at the world and the big corporation that have made it what it is although he doesn't let himself realize that he is angery. Then on a business trip he meets Tyler Durden, a man who lives for perfect moments and works to punish the rich and powerful as a champion for the poor and oppressed.<br />Unfortunanly I saw the movie first, this is not a critizism the movie was great, however the unusual plot twist is easier to believe in the book that is written in such a poetic sense that often you don't know how much time has passed for the main character in one paragraph. I recommend reading the book then seeing the movie. This is a story most men will enjoy.
B000001F3C|5.0|U2 arrived with this album. Intense songwriting and just plain great music. A staple for every music fan's library. I never get bored listening to this CD. Do your ears a favor and buy this work of art.
B00003CX8J|5.0|I was very excited to see this movie because I have been a long time fan of X-men.  It lived up to my expectations and more. The acting is great, the special effects are awesome and the overall movie is the best.  Everyone needs to own this movie. Very well done.
B0000028UK|5.0|Pearl Jam is excellent. Many people are very critical of the next album released when a band has great success, like PJ had with &quot;Ten&quot;. They answered all the critics with another blockbuster album. How do they write 2 great albums in a row, I will never know? The first 5 songs are incredible and my favorite is &quot;Elderly Woman Behind...&quot; Great music and songwriting make this album a perfect &quot;10&quot;!!!
B000002OX3|4.0|A different album from its predecessor &quot;My Generation&quot; but equally as good, &quot;A Quick One&quot; finds The Who taking its first steps into more advanced lyrical territory and song construction, without sacrificing its basic powerhouse sound.  Each member of the group is allowed two songs (actually, Daltrey could only muster one), which gives the album greater variety, and Entwistle establishes himself as a second important songwriter within the band.  His two songs &quot;Boris The Spider&quot; and &quot;Whiskey Man&quot; are among the album's highlights, and feature his trademark wit, landmark bass playing and snaky horn work.  Townshend contributes one of his finest early rockers &quot;Run Run Run&quot; (with its bone-crunching riff and masterful guitar break), the catchy pop of &quot;So Sad About Us&quot; and the ambitious multi-part mock rock-opera &quot;A Quick One&quot;, which closes the album on the adrenaline rush of &quot;You Are Forgiven&quot;.  Even Moon doesn't do so bad with his two tracks; I Need You&quot; is a humorous tale of club-hopping studded with Beatle-esque touches of harpischord and sound effects, while &quot;Cobwebs and Strange&quot; is a fun novelty instrumental that showcases his stellar drum work.  However, several weak points continue to crop up--the production mix is inexcusably muddy (the rare German stereo version is supposed to be an improvement), the cover of &quot;Heatwave&quot; is a bomb and &quot;Don't Look Away&quot; is forgettable country-esque filler (albeit well-performed).  Had the album included the experimental pop-art song &quot;Disguises&quot; and the current singles &quot;I'm A Boy&quot; and/or &quot;Happy Jack&quot; in place of these numbers, it would have been perfected.  As it stands, &quot;A Quick One&quot; is still a worthy effort that remains underrated by most Who fans; although it lacks the conceptual continuity of a &quot;Tommy&quot; or &quot;Quadrophenia&quot;, the classic elements of the Who's power-pop blend are still strongly in evidence, and aided by the use of a wider array of instrumentation, sound effects and song structure that was characteristic of the increased experimentation among Swinging London's top groups in 1966 (see also &quot;Aftermath&quot;, &quot;Revolver&quot;, &quot;Face To Face&quot;, Roger The Engineer&quot;, &quot;Sunshine Superman&quot; and &quot;Between The Buttons&quot;).  As a snapshot of The Who in transition from the raw mod power of &quot;My Generation&quot; to the sophisticated sound of &quot;Sell Out&quot;, it is invaluable. The CD re-master of the album contains ten bonus tracks conisisting of B-sides, EP cuts and outtakes of varying quality; while some of these (&quot;Batman&quot;, &quot;Barbara Ann&quot;, &quot;Bucket T.&quot;, &quot;In The City&quot;) are among the most forgettable the group ever recorded, there are now tracks like &quot;Disguises&quot;, the hilarious &quot;Doctor, Doctor&quot; and a marvelous acoustic rendition of &quot;Happy Jack&quot; as well (and yes, there was enough room for the single version on the remaster, but oh well); with the right track selection one can now program their CD player to play the ultimate version of &quot;A Quick One&quot;.
B00003CWOL|4.0|LOL...Aww man this is 1 of the funniest movies I've seen in a long time.  It's better than Austin Powers, I think.  I rented this one day when I was sick &amp; it cheared me up bigtime!  It was so funny &amp; entertaining.  Though I could see why people would be offended by this.  It was really offensive to Catholic Religion.  But still, even though I'm Catholic, I was able to lighten up &amp; enjoy this funny funny comedy.  Some of the performances are the funniest parts of it.  Ben Aflect &amp; Matt Damon have some hilarious dialoge.  All the actting was great I think, it was over the top, and I think it needed to be for this film.  Go rent this one now!
B000002OX5|5.0|&quot;Sell Out&quot; is my personal favorite Who album, although it is completely unlike any the group made before or since.  Their first concept album, it is jammed with commercial parodies, station jingles and between-song announcements that give it the zany feel of the pirate radio stations which were being shut down by the BBC at the time.  The album's sense of humor is often cited by critics as one of its many strengths; the stark juxstaposition of such pop-culture silliness in the midst of the group's most beautiful and serious set of songs to date makes for a kind of postmodern Zen epiphany unique among concept works.  Musically, the album is all over the map: elements of perfect pop balladry (&quot;I Can't Reach You&quot;, &quot;Our Love Was&quot;) coexist alongside Entwistles's dark gothic humor (&quot;Silas Stingy&quot;), elements of which later became &quot;Sparks&quot; and &quot;Underture&quot; in &quot;Tommy&quot;) and full-blown psychedelia (&quot;Armenia City In The Sky&quot;, &quot;I Can See For Miles&quot;, &quot;Relax&quot;) which take The Who's thrilling hard rock style to new heights of sonic wizardry. The classic &quot;Tattoo&quot; became a concert staple that encapsulated the album's effortless mix of the meaningful and absurd in one stroke; Daltrey's vocal here has an ethereal quality which would unfortunately be discarded in the wake of 70s bombast.  As an overall statement, &quot;Sell Out&quot; looks nostalgically back to the innocence of pop music and commercial radio, but is unafriad to embrace the new world of psychedelia; indeeed, one could say that the album as a whole presents the pre-psych world as looked through with a psych lens. Critics of the album complain about the relative lack of more typical hard rock material and the fizzling of the concept in the middle of side two, but these problems have at last been addressed with the remasters.  The CD remaster of &quot;Sell Out&quot; presents the album with a vastly superior remix; those fans who complained about missing the reverb once integral to the original can play their old CD's, and what is gained (far greater clarity, louder volume, excellent balance--and hey, I still hear plenty of the oriignal reverb) makes the album one of the best sounding in the Who's entire catalogue, second only to &quot;Who's Next&quot;.  The bonus tracks present more B-sides and outtakes, &quot;Glow Girl&quot; and &quot;Melancholia&quot; which--while excellent--do not date from the &quot;Sell Out&quot; period.  The group's 1967 studio renditions of &quot;Summertime Blues&quot; and &quot;My Way&quot; should have been included in their stead, but at least these can now happily be found on the &quot;Odds'n'Sods&quot; remaster.  As with &quot;A Quick One&quot;, someone with the remasters of &quot;Sell Out&quot; and &quot;Odds And Sods&quot; can now compile their own alternate version, which could include the extra commercials to fill out the concept, and the versions of &quot;Summertime Blues&quot; and &quot;My Way&quot; that would provide a greater balance of hard-rock numbers (I personally use these to replace &quot;I Can't Reach You&quot; and &quot;Silas Stingy&quot;, two of the slightly lesser tracks from the original IMHO).  Any way you look at it, however, &quot;Sell Out&quot; remains one of the band's finest works.
B00004XONN|5.0|I remember the first time I heard &quot;I am the walrus&quot; by the beloved Beatles. I remember thinking I had never heard anything like it.It possessed a certain craftmenship and ambition i was very unfamiliar with. This song was the trojan horse that turned me onto the beatles and changed the way I listened to music.<br />This was a song on an album (Magical Mystery) that many at the time of it's release were puzzled by and even offended by because it challenged conventions and was different from previous beatles material. I'm not saying that Kid A is of the same calibur or importance, but, simply that it has touched me in a way that music similar to it cant even come close to. i dont mean the music itself but the overall heart and concept of the album which has challenged us all and has forced us to think and remember the past efforts of musical pioneers. In this cynical age that we live in it's no wander so many great albums like Kid A go unnoticed and unappreciated.
0679731725|5.0|One can't, in The Remains of the Day, hope for the same intellectual fulfillment that may come from reading a novel such as The Great Gatsby.  However, this does not, in any way, detract from the novel's worth and greatness.<br />The Remains of the Day is a brilliantly crafted novel, concerned primarily with the character of Mr Stevens, that uses the plot as a device for the characters, rather than the other way round.  In other words - Mr Stevens, Miss Kenton, Mr Farraday and Lord Darlington are such well written characters that one is genuinely able to care about them and the way they live their lives.  Stevens, despite being often infuriating and incredibly stubborn, is at times simply magnificant in his devotion to duty.<br />Arguably, the reader can never feel totally satisfied with Stevens' progress due to the final moments of the book.  I do not wish to elaborate on this, as it may lessen your enjoyment of the novel, but suffice to say - the greatest potency in The Remains of the Day comes from not what will happen, but from what will not happen.  The philosophical doctrine of Carpe Diem is at its most profound, yet also at its most unorthodox, in Ishiguro's quite beautiful masterpiece.
0140282033|5.0|Much like the confections she describes, Joanne Harris' story is a sweet indulgence. The book is similar in tone to Alice Hofmann, with a mystical outsider, Vianne Rocher arriving in a small town and her effect on it's inhabitants. The book early on sets up it's themes of right and wrong,  spirituality, religion, and the delight in sensual pleasures. But be aware, this isn't a sappy candy coated romance or mortality tale. Underneath it's simple story are a set of rich and complex characters battling their own demons, and who help bring alive this small French village.

It's a tad confusing, which is why I give it only four stars.  I hope that there are other books out there that are just as small and just as complex as &quot;The Tao of Pooh&quot;.<br />&quot;The WHAT of Pooh?&quot; asked Pooh.<br />&quot;'The Tao of Pooh',&quot; I said.<br />&quot;It sounded like you said 'The OW! of Pooh',&quot; said Pooh.<br />&quot;Isn't this conversation in the book?&quot; I asked.<br />&quot;Oh, yes,&quot; said Pooh.  &quot;So it is.&quot;
B00003CXIP|5.0|I am 16 years old and &quot;Stand By Me&quot; is the best movie I've ever seen.  It is one one of my all time favorites.  I would recomend that if you haven't seen this movie yet then you should as soon as possible.  Phoenix, Wheaton, Feldman, and O'Connell are great when they work together.  This is the best movie of all time.  Everyone should see it.
0783117388|5.0|At long last.  <br />Available on video for those of us LOSERS who missed the first season while it was on television.  Also for those of you FABULOUS people who watched from the get-go but just want to savour the early episodes again...and again. <br />The writing is out-of this world.  The chemistry between the 4 recurring characters is a joy to behold.  And where else does one see topics such as (those of delicate nerves, please stop reading here!) the Rabbit vibrator (don't pretend that you have no idea what I'm talking about, girls) or large paintings depicting Ladies' Nether Regions openly discussed among 4 grown women who are not hookers or actresses who play them?  <br />True, this might not be the kind of fare you wish to watch with your 91 year-old grandmother, so don't take these tapes to watch with the whole family at Thanksgiving.  But I have lent my  much-loved 3-tape set to all sorts of friends who had never before watched a single episode, and they are all addicted. <br />Go on.  You know you want it.
6305910103|5.0|. . .this film is, by far, the greatest pure science-fiction movie ever made, regardless of whether or not one is normally a fan of &quot;Star Trek&quot;.<br />A quality drama, with good character development, wonderful special effects, a remarkable villain (played with incredible melodrama by Ricardo Montelban), and an unbelievably powerful and emotional ending (complete with the catharsis of a Greek tragedy) make this the most unforgettable movie in the &quot;Star Trek&quot; series -- and arguably one of the greatest Sci-fi flicks of all time.
0316777722|5.0|The book has some slow moments, but David Sedaris' Easter description makes me laugh just to remember it.  I heard him reading parts of this on NPR, which really adds to the enjoyment of the book (look them up on the archive site - you really need to hear him sing the Oscar Myer song.)  Its not great literature, but for pure reading pleasure, this book is it.  He goes on my short list of &quot;hardback&quot; authors.
B00004YM0D|5.0|Remember The Titans is a wonder combination of many classical songs. They just keep bringing wonderful hits for you to dance to. Remember The Titans is a terrific, wonderful, and great soundtrack. The movie, is wonderful! I reccomend this soundtrack to anyone, any age, any where.
0783242808|4.0|I thought American Pie would be as bad as all the other teenybopper films I had seen in 1999. However, this one was surprisingly enjoyable, I had a blast watching it. It has none of the `best-film-ever-made' quality, but it was still hilarious, good-natured entertainment that any and every audience will enjoy.<br />Jim (Jason Biggs), Kevin (Thomas Ian Nicholas), Oz (Chris Klein) and Finch (Eddie Kay Thomas) are 4 high school guys who are all desperate to score. That is when Kevin suggests they should make a pact; they must all get laid before the end of high school. That gives them a few major opportunities, including the fabulous school prom. Kevin is already one step ahead with his girlfriend Vicky (Tara Reid), Jim is still stranded on third base, Finch is developing a secretly raunchy reputation and Oz has a major leap to love with goody-goody choir-chick Heather (Mena Suvari). <br />Thank God, American Pie is no lovely-dovey \\"She's All That\\", it is a rude, crude, silly, hip and outstandingly funny flick that deserves to get a mention in the `teen-classic book'. Highly recommended for Friday night fun!<br />I rate American Pie 8 out of 10.
B00004T8RK|2.0|Pearl Jam really dissapointed me with this CD.  There's really not any great songs on the album, maybe a few that are listenable, but none worth mentioning.  Even if you are a die hard pearl jam fan, dont waste the money on thisn.
B00004W3MS|5.0|This album is in the style of Air's &quot;Moon Safari&quot;: very spacey, very soothing, very enchanting. It's a great listen, especially for fans of Air and other noise-scape bands like Beta Band. Great CD.
B00004XQP4|4.0|I have to admit that when I first bought &quot;Warning&quot;, I was surprised.  I wasn't sure if this was even the same band that brought us &quot;Dookie&quot; and &quot;Insomniac&quot;.  It sounded ok, but incredibly different from their earlier works.  After a few spins, though, I began to hear vintage Green Day behind the  new melodies and tempo's.  The frantic, explosive energy of a young band has disappeared, replaced with a more thoughtful introspectiveness.  Greenday has truly become a deeper, more mature group capable of greater means of expression.   The best song on this cd is &quot;Macy's Day Parade&quot; which contains the depth and beauty of &quot;Time of Your Life&quot; but moves in a totally different direction.  It serves as an example of the evolution of Green Day from a young, powerful punk band to a broader, more all-encompasing group.  Yes, it's true that &quot;Warning&quot; is slower than &quot;Dookie&quot;, and the familiar wall of crunchy guitar and electric tempos are gone, but Green Day has still managed to create a thoughtful, expressive, more- mature album.
B00004U8JU|4.0|I am not writing this to comment on the movie.  You either like good popcorn effects movies or you don't.  I got this DVD almost solely for the workout it would give my home-theater (well I do actually like popcorn movies).  I was very impressed with the visual transfer; the image is crisp and colorful.  What I was surprised about was the lackluster audio especially being DTS.  I was expecting the T-Rex scene to really have presence but it didn't.  It is a good DVD but I was really expecting more considering that Spielberg took so long getting this out the door.
B000002VEP|5.0|I've been a fan of the Alan Parsons Project for years and years, but had been unfamiliar with this album until very recently, when I added it to my APP CD collection. As it turns out, the only song I had heard before, &quot;Standing On Higher Ground,&quot; turned out to be my least favorite of the album.<br />&quot;Gaudi&quot; starts out on an intense, anthemlike (I think someone else used that word for this song; it's just so appropriate!) note with &quot;La Sagrada Familia&quot;. I've always liked APP's use of several different lead vocalists, depending on the mood of the song, and John Miles' emotional range, from wistful and smooth to rough and yearning, fits this song perfectly. One can almost sense the frustrated genius behind the unfinished masterpiece of Gaudi's cathedral.<br />My second personal favorite is &quot;Closer to Heaven.&quot; Once again, the images of soaring spires comes to mind as Eric Woolfson's pensive vocals wonder &quot;is this the real world or a fool's paradise?&quot;<br />&quot;Too Late&quot; is a more traditional offering from APP. Even after I educated myself somewhat about Antonio Gaudi, I'm still not sure what APP was trying to say with this song, but it's enjoyable. Lenny Zakatek is a less frequent lead vocalist, but a good one.<br />The instrumental &quot;Paseo de Gracia&quot; is as beautiful as any of APP's other instrumental works (check out their &quot;Instrumental Works&quot; CD!) and picks up elements of &quot;La Sagrada Familia&quot; and other songs on the album.<br />The only song I don't really care for is &quot;Money Talks,&quot; even though it makes use of the talented John Miles. I think it's just the style of music that doesn't appeal to me. Don't let that dissuade you, though; APP has created, through structure and design, an elegant tribute to Antonio Gaudi and his works.
0316920045|5.0|I would never admit to being close to a literary reviewing expert.  But, I feel the need to add to the large commentary regarding this book.  I spent the summer of 1997 (the entire summer) reading this book.  I just about lost a girlfriend over it as well as my sanity.  <br />Never have I experienced a story that kept me simultaneously so captivated, frustrated, and entertained before.  Captivated because of the neverending feeling to read every single word to make sure not to miss a major moment in the storyline.  Also, the overly dysfunctional cast are very endearing to follow around.  Frustrated, because many times the wild goose chase for meaning came up empty after weaving through many pages of very small font footnotes, I found myself reading a boatload of pages in an already long book over and over again to comprehend what was being said (stilted), and lastly I arrived to page 1200 something or other and wanted more!!!!  Entertained because the breadth of DFW's subject coverage, humor, surprises out of left field, and commentaries on everything from addiction, to government, to family, to the ugliness in extreme beauty, pitfalls in the possibilities of future technology, and of course international defense and displomacy cross-bred with tennis will keep you wanting to stay til the end.<br />Upon crossing the finish line, I realized I was pulled into someones else's interesting and strange world for a summer, Isn't that what fiction has the potential to do anyway?  And as humorous as this story can be at times, the infinite jest part of the equation I believe had to do with ME, the reader.  Good one David, thanks.  <br />PS  For those of you who want to get a taste of DFW, &quot;A supposed thing...&quot;  is easier to read.
0780631684|3.0|The idea of the movie was good...unfortunately...it was packaged to be a teeny bopper horror scare.  However pop, it does have some mind blowing occurances that are up there with Brad Pitt's bus incident in Meet Joe Black. Okay...it's not that bad of a movie after all....I'd watch it again.
6305807043|1.0|Oh gawd.  Where to even start?  <br />Before: Ooh!  Creative premise!  Ah must see it!<br />After:&quot;...&quot;<br />Yes indeed, words have a hard time expressing how much I despised this film.  It's clever, but that's ALL it is.  Much like a Thomas Pynchon novel, but at least you don't find all the characters (such as they are) in Gravity's Rainbow to be entirely repulsive.  Let's not mince words: the characters weren't just unsympathetic.  They were utterly, utterly horrible.  Human garbage.  Throughout the entire film all I could think was, why am I being forced to watch these people?  Evidently, I was suppose to find their evil little machinations somehow...&quot;funny.&quot;  The problem is, I don't find complete self-serving cynicism to be funny.  Indeed, I hope I'm not sounding like a Christian fundamentalist here, but I found this movie to be deeply offensive.  How can people find people who are quite willing to inflict insane psychic torture on another human being to acheive their own hedonistic ends amusing in any sense?<br />Don't get me wrong: I'm quite aware that a film doesn't *need* sympathetic characters to be worthwhile.  One of my favourite films is Trainspotting, which suffers from a similar lack.  The difference is that in that movie we weren't being asked to find wacky humour in the characters' behaviour.  I just don't find that acceptable.<br />I have friends who like BJM--and most of the Amazon reviewers seem to agree with them--and that scare me a little: are so many of us really willing to put aside all human feeling in the name of a few cheap laughs?  This film is suppose to be a breath of fresh air in a world of stale and unoriginal films.  Well, I ain't buying: painfully hip it may be, but it's also a very cruel and mean-spirited film, and I hated it.  Finis.
0783246641|4.0|I liked the guy personally.....he seems easy to get along with really.  I guess.  Well, this movie was a great one, but I'd categorize it under Dark Comedy myself.  Sure the guy's killing people, but he prophesizes about the best Genesis album of all time before the murders!  C'mon....how is that not funny?  Really, ignore the nonsense about it's nonsense and watch it...if you figure it out it kinda makes you go &quot;Maybe I shouldn't be a businessperson afterall.&quot;  Recognition is the whole idea.
B000002H97|5.0|This review is not only for me to brag for Metallica, but for the up coming &quot;Metallikids&quot; to let you know which cd is the best of them all.  Even though, all of Metallica's cds are excellent, but there is one cd that is the best of them all.  That cd is called &quot;Metallica&quot; (a.k.a. &quot;The Black Album&quot;).  All the songs on this cd are all good.  There are couple of songs on there that are slow, but they explode at the end so that not too bad.  This album was Metallica's break through album.  They worked ten months and sold over ten million copies.  This whole album buts the word heavy in heavy metal.  There are four songs on here that I like especially, and they are &quot;Enter Sandman,&quot; &quot;Sad But True,&quot; Of &quot;Wolf and Man,&quot; and &quot;My Friend Misery.&quot;  &quot;Sandman&quot; and &quot;Sad But True&quot; I like, because they are strictly heavy, which we all expect from Metallica.  The reason why I like &quot;Of Wolf and Man&quot; is that one I like wolves and it also brings out the &quot;wolf&quot; out of you, meaning your &quot;wild side.&quot;  The main reason I like &quot;My Friend Misery&quot; is that the bass solo in the beginning is so good and that it affects your emotions, meaning that it can put you in a bad mood when you already in a bad mood.  The sound of all the instruments on this cd sound awesome and the vocals as well.  So that is my review and I hope that I have convinced all of you new &quot;Metallikids,&quot; which cd is the best of them all.  Just remember what I said above there is nothing bad about this cd and the songs are all heavy.
B00003CWTH|5.0|High Praise must be given to this film.  The greatly intwined plot deserves much credit and the actors played their roles quite superbly.  The woven plot alone makes this movie slow at first, but once you start to figure out how the characters are connected to one and all, it triumphs.  From the wiz kid to the old man to the cop to everyone and back again....what a ride.  I don't wan't to ruin it for anybody but just remember the word FROGS.  You may now applaud.
1573225517|3.0|Anyone who has ever made a compilation tape for their girlfriend (instead of actually expressing their feelings direclty) will enjoy this book.  The British slang gets a bit thick, but overall a good airplane read, with a half-dozen LOL's.  Don't expect too much insight into the human soul.<br />I just saw the movie and it's a bit disappointing. It glosses over the personal complexities that make these characters interesting.  Tom Robbins' performance saves an otherwise dull adaptation.
B00003XACV|5.0|Watch Citizen Cohn, The Green Mile, or Shawshank and you instantly deduce the work of Thomas Newman.  You hear the piano and you know exactly who wrote the part, but the music of American Beauty was so unlike any of Newman's other endeavors into film-scores.  Placing the focus more on light percussion like the xylophone almost threw me off at times that it was indeed his work.  The movie was needless to say intelligent and bizarre, (in other words EXCELLENT,) but music plays such a key role and his music is just so good OUTSIDE the film.  Buy this.  But don't put it on while cooking or balancing your checkbook.  Put it in and just listen.  It's spectacular.
6304286961|5.0|this video is a must have for anyone who enjoys the doors. Val Kilmner's portrayal of Jim Morrison is the best thing that he has ever done. you will swear that he is posessed by the spirit of Morrison. Meg Ryan as Pam completes this tale of late 60's drug crazed rock and roll. Get it you won't regret it.
B000002KAT|5.0|Most reviews pay attention to the first 5 tracks of this CD. But what about Slim Slow Slider. What a track....&quot;I know you are dying, baby, and i know you know it too....Every time I see you I just dont know what to do&quot; <br />This track with ofcourse the magnificient The Way Young Lovers Do is worth five stars on their one
B00004XONN|5.0|If OK Computer was indeed loosely based on the realization of an ultra-techological society and the fear that developed from that realization, then Kid A is the next concept album going in the same direction.  The songs feel and sound like a completely new beginning, and that's what they are.  Radiohead has abondoned the guitar blasts and 'conventional' arrangements but not at the expense of songs.  &quot;Everything in its Right Place&quot; comes after OK Computer:  it is about waking in this ultra modern society and realizing that everything is completely different yet somehow the same.  Imagine the confusion.<br />Moving through &quot;The National Anthem&quot; the listener may feel a sense of confusion, one that arrises from vivid memories of the past clashing with the nanosecond pace of modern life.  On &quot;How to Disappear Completely&quot; and &quot;Treefingers&quot; we stop for a minute, escape from the daily grind only to see a memory from the past destroyed, lost forever, only able to exist on the digital airwaves.  Later the realization that &quot;The best you can is good enough&quot; rings all too true, because technology will always outperform.<br />Kid A is ahead of its time:  musically, lyrically, and socially.  Kid A could be a metahpor for humanity:  a new generation growing up in a world where there are more computers than people;  a generation that is about to make the biggest leap foreward (or the biggest step back) since the creation of language.  Is that what it is?  I don't know.  What I do know is that Radiohead has created another teriffic album and I'm going to let them lead me to wherever it is they're going.
B000000YG5|5.0|In my opinion, there is no better tenor sax player than Sonny Rollins. The reviewer who states that he lacked the curiosity of Miles and the fire of Trane simply hasn't been listening to Sonny. Rollins has a track record stretching close to fifty years of sterling performances. Miles lost his fire and turned to rock funk. Trane went so far out he was thinking it was time to come back as he noted in a conversation with Monk shortly before his untimely death. But Sonny just keeps on developing and blowing without ever forgetting his roots. Colossus is proof of just how good Sonny can be and how approachable he remains while attaining his goal.s
0679879269|5.0|Given the time and delays involved in the writing of THE AMBER SPYGLASS, I was initially afraid that it wouldn't live up to the huge expectations raised by the first two books.  The first hundred pages or so, too, seemed slower and less tightly written than the previous volumes.  Fortunately, this turns out to be only a building of tension before the near-apocalyptic events the book describes, and Pullman carries off his conclusion in brilliant theological, emotional, and literary fashion.  Pullman shows his normal invention throughout The two-layered ending of the book is both joyous and painful, and is a masterpiece of the art of writing for both children and adults; nothing is explicitly sexual, but the finale is deeply erotic nonetheless.  <br />Much mention has been made of the book being a kind of sequel to PARADISE LOST; undoubtedly true, but remember that it also makes great use of the works of that other prophet, William Blake (whose MILTON, of course, is a sequel to PARADISE LOST in itself.)  The joy of the body and the mind, unchained by religion, is one of the main themes of the book.  The book is, of course, deeply religious, even mystical, in its imagery, language, and feeling, but its overall message is one of a powerful imaginative atheism.  <br />Some readers might be disturbed by this message.  After all, this is a book that says, quite clearly, that &quot;Christianity is a very powerful and convincing mistake.&quot;  Myself, I'm all for it, and I think that Christian parents should allow their children to be challenged by the message of the book, but, if you feel strongly about such things, be warned.  <br />The one element of the book I would question is the subplot involving the mulefa (diamond-wheeled creatures in an alternate ecology) which seems disconcertingly science-fictional, and which lack the fantastical resonance of the other creatures in the trilogy.  They seem included largely to make a point, not by virtue of their own interest, andthose sections, while necessary to the overall plot, slow the book down.  Still, it's a minor flaw in what is probably the greatest sequence of novels, for adults *or* children, published in the last decade or two.
0440219078|5.0|When Jonas and the rest of the Elevens (surmised to be eleven year olds) approaches December, they know that the upcoming \\"graduation\\" is a significant change.  When they become Twelves, their jobs in the Community will be announced.  The Elders have been observing them for their entire lives, and they will hold these positions for the remainder of their time.  At the ceremony, Jonas is alarmed when the Elder in charge assigns him to the job of the Receiver.  He had never heard of the job previously.  For all of his life, he has been guided in acting uniformly with whomever was nearby.  How was he supposed to do that now? <br /> Nothing in his environment has variances.  Crimes have been banished.  Hate was out-ruled.  Love dissolved along with malevolence and bloodshed. As Jonas experiences the teachings of The Giver, he solitarily confronts life prior to his Community.  Memories that The Giver must pass on to Jonas are both excruciating and intoxicating, yet they make him think.  They force him to turn his mind on doubting conformers and apprehending change.<br /> Although the story can get a little sci-fi/freaky, the message it conveys superceeds all of its negatives. A definite must read.
B00003CXE7|4.0|Respect Ridley Scott for what he has done with Gladiator. In revisiting an ancient civilisation, he has essentially regenerated the 'sword and sandals' epics of the 50s (Ben Hur, Spartacus in the 60s). Gladiator is astounding. The first ten minutes of the film are possibly the most awe-inspiring in any film (barring Star Wars), and this stream of adrenaline pumping action continues throughout the film. And the Tigers rock. And that's the good bit of the film.  The flawed aspect is the story itself, for although the idea of a vengeful Roman General fighting through gladiator 'school' and into the Colloseum is effective, and very cool, although not entirely original, it is when we are given this sub-plot of a secret Roman political conspiracy, and Maximus' role in disolving this conspiracy, that the film starts to slip a bit.The 'politics'of the screenplay detract from what we all want to see more of in this film-people getting chopped to bits. And that is what I think of the film. When it's good, it's the best action 'done in the old style' film in a long time, but when it starts to believe it has a well crafted, engaging story, it just becomes rather too Hollywood.
0679879269|5.0|Amber Spyglass was a wonderful end to an amazing trilogy. Bill Pullman is perhaps one of the only authors who have been able to make me want to live in the world of his characters and exist as them. This is definately his strongest book of all three, although I enjoyed all of them. Whoever has not read this yet, the ending is very suprising! You will not believe what you are reading. This is one of the few times have have been possesed to both laugh and cry (my eyes were horribly puffy the morning after reading this book, just to warn you ) and I enjoyed every minute of it. The travels of Will  and Lyra and the development of their relationship was so beutiful. To anyone who wants a good read, pick up this book, you will be very glad you did!
B00004Y6Q5|5.0|A surprisingly faithful adaptation of the book (with the exception of substituting a motivational-speaker-type TV program for a game show), &quot;Requiem for a Dream&quot; is a journey into obsession and madness that spirals to a relentlessly intense climax. Clint Mansell's score is perfect in every way for the material. The score is by turns painfully moving, shocking, ethereal and always haunting. &quot;Requiem for a Dream&quot; may well turn out to be the best movie released in 2000, and Mansell (and the Kronos Quartet's) soundtrack is by far my favorite score from any movie released this year. A hands-down masterpiece!
B000023VR6|4.0|Dr.Dre still has it.He is truly the best rapper and producer ever.Most songs on here are good,if not great.There are 3 songs on here that will probaly considered classic songs from DRE.&quot;Still Dre&quot; &quot;Forgot About Dre&quot; and &quot;The Next Episode&quot;.Also Murder Ink,Watcher,Message,Lets Get High,and Whats the Diffrence.Dre also brings many great rappers in the album like Snoop Dogg and Eminem.Eminem has a great verse in &quot;Forgot About Dre&quot;.The only bad parts are not many songs with just DRE(only 3 or 4)and the interludes arent very good.But overall,the beats are tight,the lyrics are sweet,and it just has that Dre Atmosphere.Dre is just the best!
B00003CWNR|3.0|My biggest problem with this film was the fact that it didn't really have a plot.  It was basically a coming of age story, but there was no ultimate goal of the story.  True, there was a climax, but there was no building towards it.  It just sort of happened.<br />What saved this movie, in my eyes, was the fact that the characters were so well developed and so engaging, that I didn't mind the fact that the story was missing a plot.  Michael Caine, Tobey Maguire, Charlize Theron, and Delroy Lindo all give brilliant performances.  Erykah Badu does an excellent job as the daughter of Delroy Lindo's character.  I liked all of these characters and I wanted to see what happened to them.  That's how this movie kept my attention.  I was surprised at this since, normally, when a movie doesn't have a plot, I lose interest.  That was definitely not the case here.  It was interesting seeing Tobey Maguire's character learn about the world and interact in his semi-innocent way with those around him.  The tragic love story wound into the story was an added level of sophistication in my eyes.<br />A surprisingly enjoyable movie, despite it's shortcomings as a story.
B00003Q438|4.0|The film itself is very good, the story is engaging and the effects are excellent.  There are two versions presented, the original theatrical and a longer version with cut scenes.  Both are good, but I prefer the cut scenes version since it fleshes out the ending better.<br />As far as extra material, this set is full of them.  The production notes are very complete, and there are a number of items on how they filmed and all the troubles thay had.  The drama of actually making this film at some times exceeds what ended up on screen.<br />If you have seen this film and liked it then get this DVD for all the bonus materials, it is still a bargain at the price.  If you have never seen the film, get this DVD and you will enjoy it, plus you have about 10 hours of material to watch so plan on taking some time to devour it all.  If you like the art of filmaking and learing how it all happens then this DVD is one you should have.
B000009MF7|5.0|This is some impeccable playing. Mr. Zimerman's performance is  outstanding. I have just recently become familiar with his recordings, and I find the Ravel concertos among the best I've heard from him so far. I must also comment on the quality of the recording, which deserves an honorable mention for its excellence. Overall, this recording is a winner in my book.
B000002N2Z|5.0|The first time i heard this CD, i thought it was GREAT! the song &quot;7 Words&quot; is awesome, you should hear it. &quot;Bored&quot; is also kool. i think that everyone should go out and buy the CD and listen to it all the time.
B00004X01U|1.0|Definitely go the Napster rout on this Madonna Reincarnation. I'm sorry; you can only reinvent yourself so many times. No doubt, this CD will go Multi-Platinum. Not on its merits mind you, but by the name pasted on it, MADONNA.

0316777722|4.0|Something must have been in the drinking water at the Sedaris' home some years ago.  Although we all have family/life stories to share, most of ours are nothing like David's.  His comic bathroom struggle to dispose of an un-claimed... out of fear that the next in line will believe it to be his, is hi-LAR-ious!  I like the way that David views life.
B0000026KQ|5.0|I'm cracking up reading a couple of these reviews that say stuff like, 'I do not like this album' and 'overproduced'  ... bull, complete bull.  This album is a timeless masterpiece by a trio of uncompromising, virtuosic musicians.  This album could not be any better.  If you are a musician then you know that sometimes you can get totally locked in on a vibe, wave, energy, cosmic beam, sign from God ... whatever!  Believe me, these guys are locked in the whole way on this one.  You will not be disappointed
0060925000|1.0|By the time I'd finished with Vikram Seth's A Suitable Boy, I was on the verge of flinging, if one can actually fling this huge tome, across the room. <br />I stuck with the characters from the start and ploughed through the entire length of the book only to find an anti-climax waiting for me at the end. The book does nothing to alleviate its protaganist and makes her resign to cliches. The rest of the characters in the book are neither endearing nor engaging. The family tree that's displayed in the beginning of the book is a guide map that goes awry with every addition of a new character. The whole book reads like a TV soap, resorting to melodrama and again, cliches, but minus the camp value of TV soap or the humour. <br />Worse, Mr Seth, obviously in a moment of triumph, pens a silly, self-indulgent poem at the start of the book thanking readers for patiently sitting through A Suitable Boy and for digging into their coffers to pay for it. I'm so glad I for one didn't cough up money for this. I borrowed this from the local library and I highly recommend you do the same. Better still, forgo reading this completely. I'm sure your precious free time can be better spent doing something else.
B00004XONN|5.0|I can fully relate with all of you who were a bit taken aback upon the first listen of Kid A, for I was right there with you (even ignoring the fact that I was wearing a pair a bad headphones which made everything horribly raspy).  However, each subsequent listen brought with it new discoveries into the astonishing depth Radiohead manages to pump into each track.  It isn't The Bends and is hardly reminiscent of OK Computer, but it is an amazing listen which, for whatever reason, cannot be appreciated on the first time through.      I do NOT advise listening to these songs on an individual level in mp3 format...the album is meant to be heard as one entity and some of the impact is lost in the shuffling.  Give it more than one listen and listen to it as a whole and you will not be disappointed.
B0000029DD|5.0|This album was Jeff Buckley's only finished full length LP, but it has earned its place in music and will give Buckley a long lasting legacy as a remarkably talented vocalist an deeply introspective songwriter.  Like his father(Tim), he has an experimental vocal style that can easily move through four octaves.  He immediately shows his talent in the emotional opener &quot;Mojo Pin&quot; where he laments about lost love and compares the feeling of his lover by his side to the need of a &quot;Mojo Pin&quot;, a reference to heroin addiction, all of this is backed by whispering guitars and sped up organ tracks.  The standout cut is &quot;Grace&quot; with its brilliant guitar work and captivating vocal performance where Buckley shows off his multiple octave range.  This truly is a masterpiece with few flaws.  In a time of grunge and &quot;hard rock&quot;, Buckley was not afraid to write moving and emotional songs.  It costed him in record sales, but his talent will always live on far past his untimely death.
B00004T1NA|4.0|I just started listening to Porcupine Tree, and so far I've been very impressed.  Lightbulb Sun is one of three CDs I have purchased (Signify and Voyage 34: The Complete Trip being the other two), and so far I would have to say my favorite (although I would rate all three 4 stars).<br />The two tracks that really stand out for me are &quot;Russia On Ice&quot; and &quot;Hatesong&quot;.  &quot;Russia On Ice&quot; features a backing string section, one of three songs on the CD featuring strings. The song can be divided into two sections, the first lasting about seven and a half minutes.  The two sections contrast each other very nicely, with the first section filled with the emotion of the string section and beautiful vocals while the second half of the song is a heavy-driven instrumental. &quot;Hatesong&quot; works off of a simple opening bass line. What really works about the song is that it builds throughout most of the song but always comes back to that bass line.<br />Other standouts include &quot;How Is Your Life Today?&quot; (sounds as if it could be on Sgt. Pepper or Magical Mystery Tour), &quot;Four Chords That Made a Million&quot; (guitar-driven rock song), &quot;Where We Would Be&quot;, and &quot;The Rest Will Flow&quot; (another song with strings; very solid poppish-sounding song).
B000000WJZ|5.0|this is the best cd in the whole world ive been listening to it for the past five years.. and its sooooo great.
0440219078|5.0|This Book is the greatest. It pulled me into it and aroused my curiosity. It made me feel what Jonas, the main character, was feeling. It was incredible how Lois Lowry depicted everything in this story. The way Jonas discovers color, feelings, and love is mind boggling. I can not get over how great this story was.
B00004XONN|1.0|i use to listen to a lot of hard music like sepultura and canibal corpse, then along came radiohead and changed my life completely..inspired me to become a budist monk, my friend who has been listening to radiohead became very depressed..so slit on all you happy radiohead listeners.
0316777722|5.0|This is hands down one of the funniest books I have ever read. I was totally unfamiliar with David Sedaris until I saw him interviewed on David Letterman and found him mildly amusing. At the end of the interview they flashed this book up and I didn't think about it again. I saw it the next day at the book store and just from reading the dust jacket I was so hooked I purchased it and another of his books, Naked. Both are very good but I prefer Me Talk Pretty One Day to Naked. I have recommended this book to dozens of people. If you need a pick me up this is the book to do it!
B000022TSF|4.0|Chinatown doesn't only hold up because of the excellent story.  Because of the excellent DVD quality it's really hard to identify the time it has been made. Off course we know it's from the seventies because it's daring, weird and highly original and accompanied by one of the best soundtracks ever written (Jerry Goldsmith). Not daring &amp; weird in a far fetched Polanski kind of way, but really believable and disturbing.It's one of the top 5 masterpieces ever made.The film also has a couple of kneeslapping 'unneeded' hilarity, for instance the scene where Jack Nicholson inspects one of the waterpipes with a couple of policemen, (we are now 1 h 39m 30 s into the film) when suddenly one of the cops makes a loud hickuppy kind of sound. They look at him and do not react. It's so sweet! I rented this copy but i'm going out tomorrow to buy it. The interview with Polanski &amp; writers is far to short, but it's there, so that's good. The 5.1 surround sound is adding to the mood brilliantly. Wow!
B00004XONN|5.0|But it's really sad that you did not :(<br />I think this is an album that you either &quot;get&quot; or you don't.  The people that dislike it will say that the rest of us are merely tricking ourselves into thinking we like it, but I can personally testify that that is NOT the case.  Granted, it's not as easy to listen to as The Bends, and it's not as guitar-driven as OK Computer, but that's the POINT.  This is an evolving band.<br />OK Computer was one of the greatest albums of the '90s (if not for Automatic for the People, it'd probably be the best).  If Radiohead tried to make another album like it they'd have made fools of themselves.  <br />Thom Yorke once said (on the recording of OKC): &quot;We weren't listening to guitar bands, we were thoroughly ashamed of being a guitar band. So we bought loads of keyboards and learned how to use them, and when we got bored we went back to guitars.&quot;   Kid A is Radiohead pulling those keyboards out of the closet and realizing they weren't as boring as they thought.<br />Kid A is different, yes.  It's electronic, dense, ambient, and very, very difficult.  It's also purely brilliant.  <br />Kid A, The National Anthem, How to Disappear Completely, Optimistic, Idioteque and Motion Picture Soundtrack are the strongest songs this album has to offer.  Guitars are prominent in only two of these.  Anyone expecting a &quot;rock&quot; album in the traditional sense will be SEVERELY disappointed.  Those that are a little more open-minded will most certainly not be.<br />Neil Young once said &quot;rock and roll will never die.&quot;  This remains as true today as it was in 1979.  Rock and roll will NEVER die...but, with Kid A, Radiohead has proven that it can evolve.

B000001F7R|4.0|ON THROUGH THE NIGHT, recorded in 1979 (!) and released in '80, simply rocks! Songs like 'Rock Brigade', 'Hello America', and 'Wasted' are absolute classics of the genre. One reviewer suggested that the band re-record it with modern equipment. Hell no!!! No disrespect to Def Leppard, but there's no way that a middle-aged band could recapture the youth, vitality, excitement, and innocence that was brimming on this recording. It'd be like asking God to rewrite the Bible. LOL Anyway, I would've given 5 stars, but there's one or two songs that fall just a bit short. Still great though. On a slightly different note, I'd just like to remark on what a shame it is that the band no longer acknowledge this album. I personally think it's to appease Phil Collen and Mutt Lange because it was recorded before they came into the picture. ON THROUGH THE NIGHT and HIGH &amp; DRY are sort of like the children of a first marriage who got &quot;forgotten&quot; when the 2nd wife came into the picture, in this case, Collen and Lange.
B00004XQP4|4.0|I have to admit that the first time that I listened to &quot;Warning&quot;, I was truly surprised.  The rythms and acoustics were slower than classic Green Day, and at first I wasn't sure if this was the same band that brought us &quot;Dookie&quot; and &quot;Insomniac&quot;.  After a few spins though, I heard more and more of the old band.  Green Day has truly grown and matured.  They have managed to broaden their artistic horizens while retaining the frantic, feverish, wild energy of their earlier years.  &quot;Warning&quot; is truly different in the same sense that &quot;Nimrod&quot; was when it was released.  This is not Green Day's best cd, but it is not horrendouse, as some reviews below mine have said.  Instead, it is simply another step in the evolution of Green Day from an energetic punk band into a more emotionaly and artisticaly mature group.  Their melodies, lyrics, and overall attitude have become deeper and more introspective.  It does have a lot more pop than &quot;Dookie&quot; had, but it also has more variety.  Green Day is truly becoming a broader, wiser band.  Yes, &quot;Dookie&quot; is a better cd, but please, do yourself a favor and buy &quot;Warning&quot;.
B000001DVD|5.0|This album is awesome. I don't know if it's the mix of the CD or what, but it sounds better and more powerful than any other 80's record. You actually get a vicarious feeling of pure, youthful energy listening to this. I love Van Halen, but HIGH &amp; DRY makes their sacred debut sound almost average, and that's no easy task. The songs are great. I agree with the notion about what a shame it is that Def Leppard no longer acknowledge their first two records. Maybe they're afraid of facing the reality that they'll never match this again.
B00003CXB6|4.0|The second installment of the Jurassic Park trilogy came and went with a lot of fan-fare but little praise.  It was seen as a big-buget flop, a movie made for finicaial gain even at the expense of the audience.  I only bring this up to dismiss such rumors.  In truth it's better than the original, if only for conventially shallow reasons.  The special effects are better, the digital sound is first rate and the new additions to the cast couldn't be better.  And they include (deep breath) Julianne Moore, snubbed by academy voters that same year for a knockout performance in Boogie Nights, Vince Vaughn whose gone onto cackle his way into our hearts and minds with leading man quality work in Psycho &amp; Clay Pigeons and Richard Schiff who'd gone unnoticed with roles in Seven and The Arrival but made his mark on TV's The West Wing (for which he won an Emmey this year).  You get the idea.  So the group of fresh faces find themselves trapped on a desolate island along with free-roaming dinosaurs who seem twice as ferocious here as in the original.  We move from one action sequence to another, Spielberg holding back the reins so as not to desensitize his audience with violence and general mayhem.  It's those broad master strokes that keep us aware that we've put our faith in a great filmmaker and he won't let us down.  I found myself more caught up in the DVD than I could've possibly imagined having not realized how much the film had lost in it's VHS transfer.  The disc offers a pair of interesting deleted scenes but the biggest disappointment comes in the Jurassic 3 'trailer' which is actually not even worthy of being called a 'teaser.'  But whose to complain when everything else is so outstanding.
B00003CXBK|5.0|i've been waiting to see this moive for a long time, and when i saw it, it didn't let me down. this movie has everything: violence, gore, and one scene that alone deserves an acadamy award. this movie has the perfect blend of magic, might, love, and scenes that truly test the courage of the protagonist. i highly recommend this to everyone.
B00004XONN|5.0|I have been a huge Radiohead fan since the revolutionary-like albumn, OK Computer, but Kid A has just pushed Radiohead into a new dimension.  Before I continue, you first must understand something when buying this albumn though...I do not recommend it for all people.  If you don't understand Radiohead, and all that they bring to music...YOU WONT LIKE THIS ALBUMN.  All of the people who are saying how horrible the albumn is either only like what they hear of them on the radio, or dont have either The Bands, or OK Computer (their last two cds...I do not include Pablo Honey, simpily because it is not really what they are about anymore).  Now, if you are a true Radiohead fan, or would like to become one, this is a must.  According to a few of my fellow reviewies who may just not get it, Thom rambles on and on, and there is no real &quot;song.&quot;  What makes Radiohead so unique is their willingness to expand and try new ideas, even if they may not be received too well.  Well, I got news for you, Thom does ramble, and it isn't always easy to pick up quite what he is saying.  If they knew anything about Radiohead, or had their past two cds, they would have known this before buying the cd, they may not have been disappointed.  Now, I have no idea where they would get an idea where there is no real song.  Often they have songs lead into the next, but it keeps you involved.  I have listened to this cd many times now, and there are no two tracks alike.  Track 1, &quot;Everything is in Its Right Place&quot; is monumental in its own.  It is by far one of the most beautiful, creepy songs ever.  Kid A continues on to Track 3, where &quot;The National Anthem&quot; sounds rockish, untill about 2 and a half minutes into the song, it turns into a progessive jazz wonder, with a full horn harmony.  Track 6 is &quot;Optimistic&quot; which I'm sure you have heard on the radio.  The most shocking song on Kid A, is the masterful &quot;Idioteque.&quot;  Unlike anything I have ever heard or may ever hear, it turns an ordinary dance beat, into a powerful, deep, and spellbinding piece.  This is the kind of thing that made me into a fan.  All in all, one of the best compilations of all time, Radiohead's masterpiece Kid A, does not disappoint.  It was well worth the wait for anybody who knows or appreciates what Radiohead has done for music.
B00004XONN|5.0|Okay, i made a review earlier in these (now) 691 votes for this album.  The album is great, and I don't think it's for everyone.  But I want to make one note to anyone who buys this album, hears a section of it, or decides that they just flat out hate rock music: personally, I adored the album.  I had not heard any complaints or praises for it at the time I bought it.  It was my sheer curiosity as to how the band had progressed since OK Computer, and I was delighted at what I found.  However, please...  PLEASE, don't view that anyone who likes this album is part of a &quot;cult&quot; or &quot;fad.&quot;  Yes, the album is slightly pretentious, but you know what?  it moves me like very few albums have.  I'm a huge Pink Floyd fan, and this is the most life I've seen jolted into an album in years, upon years.  &quot;Rock is alive&quot; ~Time Magazine   ...Please, believe me when I say that it would be even worse to avoid the opportunity of listening to this amazing album by viewing it as a cult phoenomenon.  That's about as closed-minded as pretentiousness comes.  Please, buy the album and judge for yourself.  It's a hell of a ride.
0394800184|5.0|This book is perfect for toddlers who are just starting to appreciate illustrations.  It tells of a young bird searching for his mom and asking each animal he meets, &quot;Are you my mother?&quot;<br />Kids can easily relate to the young bird's quest for his mom.  He meets a kitten, a hen, a dog, a cow and a snort only to find out that his mom just got food for him and came back for him in their nest!  The illustrations are simple, realistic and fun to look at.<br />A story with a valuable lesson:  The importance of the  mother-child bonding which transcends all beings in the animal kingdom.
0140157352|5.0|I read this book in an MBA course for Dispute Mediation. Although it was not a required reading, every text and article mentioned this book. You can easily read it in a weekend. Do not expect theory, paradigm, or lofty descriptions-this is cut to the chase stuff that lets you know many techniques for negotiating and helping the other side make a decision that is right for all involved. Some helpful key concepts include elimintating emotions from the process, or dealing with the emotional techniques that the other side may use against you. It also describes BATNA, or the best alternatives to a negotiated agreement-those agreements which may be the most realistic and beneficial terms for both sides. I think that the other book, getting past no, by the same author, is an additional reference that anyone considerring this book should also read as an excellent complementary text to the principles outlined in this classic.
6302759110|1.0|This film disgusted me.  The way the vampires are portrayed, so ugly and unfeeling, repulsed me.  (For a look at some beautiful vampires, check out Interview with the Vampire).  There was far too much reddness and fog in the sky in Transylvania.  The visual effect is that of a low-budget sci-fi flick.   If Amazon had half ratings (which, they don't, so too bad), I'd give it one and a half stars for Gary Oldman, who can portray a tortured lover like no other (see Immortal Beloved and The Scarlet Letter).  Wynona Ryder isn't too bad in this film, but I've seen much better from her.
B000002H70|5.0|How can I sum up the power of this album in just 1000 words. Disitengration is one of those albums that peacefully lulls you into a relaxing mood...Or it can wake you up and put a bounce in your step. No matter what you want to feel, Disintegration can help you do it.  Especially wonderful on rainy, overcast days driving down the highway...  If I was on a desert island and could only bring a cd player and one cd...Disintegration would be it.  No lie. :)
B0000041JU|4.0|I'll go ahead and agree with Amazon that the Mussorgsky is a bit slow.  &quot;Ill Vecchio Castilo&quot; and the catacomb movement in particular just drag on and on.  However...<br />The Ravel is an absolute delight.  Never has &quot;Valses&quot; been so &quot;Sentimental.&quot;  Every phrase is given the utmost care, and the true beauty of the music is brought out.  While Porgelich's interpretation of these simple pieces sometimes borders on ambient, he somehow manages to drag the melody out of it...just when you think you're lost...<br />Anyone who would like to hear a fresh interpretation should pick this up.
6300214559|3.0|Let's start with what's good about this movie.  The cast is wonderful, the costumes superb, etc.<br />And, they even got part of the history right.  In the 16th century people did argue passionately (and die) over religion, poor innocent Jane was the puppet of ruthlessly ambitious adults.<br />Blast it!  That dumb love story ruined the whoe movie.  There is absolutely no evidence that Jane and Guilford Dudley ever loved each other.  Nor did they attempt to reform the coinage, build public schools, redistribute income...  I think Jane's story is even more tragic when you realize that her horrible parents forced her into a loveless marriage to further their own ends.<br />But yet, the execution scene was true to the historical accounts. Can you imagine the horror of watching a blinfolded sixteen year old groping for the executioner's block, and asking:  &quot;Where is it?  What do I do?&quot;<br />If you ever go to London, visit the British Library where Jane's prayerbook is on display.  The night before she died, she wrote a letter to her sister on the endpapers.  The handwriting never wavers.  What courage this innocent child had.
B00003CX8J|4.0|During the last few years we've put up with some bad comic book adaptations that totally let the fans down. Movies like Batman &amp; Robin, Steel ,and two of the last Superman flicks are some examples. Then came along the long awaited X-men movie which really changed the face of comic book films. In my eyes, this is the second most anticipated film made recently (first was Phantom Menace) and it was one of the best films this summer. The biggest star of the film should be the director, Bryan Singer, for making an actual movie version of a comic strip story that display its characters in detail.<br />But sadly the movie had some flaws that a number of hardcore fans of X-men would disapprove of. The most obvious for me is that Hallie Berry (Storm) had little to do with the plot, so it was hard to determine if Hallie was right for the role in the first place. <br />The film should have been called Wolverine 'cause he was the center of the story(not the ensemble, while Cyclops and co. takes the back seat. The Wolverine/ Sabretooth fight was good, but meant nothing cause their history from the comic didn't surface. The other fight scenes belittled the X-men, making them appear unable to throw a single punch. Plus, there are sections of the dialogue that were a bit dull.<br />Despite the screenplay mistakes the film is reasonably good. The sets are cleverly designed, the Magneto/ Professor X  rivalry was done brilliantly by Patrick Stewart and  Ian McKellen, the brief funny moments were fine like when Wolverine gave Cyclops the &quot;claw&quot;. <br />Also Ray Park does another good turn as a super villain since his vile debut as Darth Maul in Episode 1, now he's the elusive Toad who really stole some scenes. The chick who played Rouge had a certain mysterious persona but a bit too sweet for the strong willed character, she did o.k. The special FX complemented the film without being a distraction or overkill. Hugh Jackman has potential to be one of  the new action heroesof the 21st century. He played Wolverine like Michael Keaton played Batman. The rest of the cast could have done better but like I said, the writer made a few mistakes.<br />Bottom line, the movie is plain cool. It adapted the heart of the comic and has a subtle status like Matrix. This is the type of direction that the genre needs. Let's hope that the makers of the new Superman movie actually reads a couple comic books like Bryan read his. Forget it!  Bryan should direct the new Superman, and Batman 5. X-men doesn't break any new ground, but a good film nevertheless.
B000024D4R|5.0|How could this legendary progressive-rock band possibly top the classic double-header of &quot;Dark Side Of The Moon&quot; and &quot;Wish You Were Here&quot;? Simple---drop the saxophonist and the female backup singers, make the music less spacey and more harder-edged, and lay down some of the most powerful, enthralling, bone-crunching prog-rock ever committed to tape! The mighty Pink Floyd did just that with 1977's &quot;Animals,&quot; an astounding rock album that is not only an all-time classic, but it's also hands down the band's best work. Hey, I love &quot;Dark Side&quot; et al just as much as the next Floyd fan, but with &quot;Animals,&quot; Pink Floyd ROCK with everything they've got, and for the very last time as a four-piece (session musicians were once again used by the band for &quot;The Wall&quot; and every Floyd album that has followed it).The theme of &quot;Animals,&quot; inspired by George Orwell's &quot;Animal Farm,&quot; is a journey through society split into three caste systems of animals---dogs, pigs, &amp; sheep. The dogs are the ruthless cutthroats, the pigs are the stuck-up authority figures, and the sheep are the blind followers. Roger Waters, David Gilmour, Nick Mason, and Richard Wright blaze through this work with astonishing musical force. With no extra help from session musicians, the band have only themselves to play off of here, and because of that, the band's musical power is given extra strength. &quot;Dogs,&quot; in particular, is a great example---Gilmour's shimmering acoustic guitar strums initially sound far off, but then draw closer. As Wright's eerie keyboards make a cameo, Gilmour lays down the strongest, most powerful lead vocal he's ever done for the band. Then the rest of the band kick in, and &quot;Animals&quot; becomes absolutely mindblowing as the band REALLY shift into high gear.I also love the album's intro and outro in the form of Waters' two parter, &quot;Pigs On The Wing,&quot; which is actually a love song to Waters' then-wife, Carolyn. The first part of the song beautifully acts as a sort of &quot;calm before the storm,&quot; as it settles you into your seat or on your bed, and gets you ready for the sheer musical force to follow. Forty minutes later, after the Floyd's incredible treatment of &quot;Sheep&quot; finally fades away into the distance, Waters comes in with the second half of &quot;Pigs On The Wing,&quot; the peace *after* the storm, if you like. It ends the album on a very poignant, memorable note.Pink Floyd have got many brilliant albums in their catalog, but &quot;Animals&quot; is the big one for me. It's outstanding, and, as a concept album, it's also a very fascinating allegory about our own society. Simply put, &quot;Animals&quot; is a brilliant opus from one of rock's greatest bands.

B000002MNL|5.0|Never before has music captured my emotions so poignantly... <br />I bought this on a whim, the day I was to break up with my girlfriend, Valentines Day 2000.  How ironic.  For the next month, as my life wallowed in uncertainty, this was the soundtrack.  &quot;Now My Heart Is Full,&quot; &quot;Hold On To Your Friends,&quot; and especially &quot;Speedway&quot; took me places I never knew existed.  <br />Morrissey certainly has a way with the English language, stretching syllables out and twisting them into something wonderful.  Some of the melodies (&quot;The More You Ignore Me...&quot;) are just breathtakingly gorgeous and grab you by the ear.  I'm too young to have grown up on the Smiths, and I don't listen to a lot of rock, so I hadn't really heard much about Morrissey.  Even though I love &quot;Vauxhall and I&quot; (a take on &quot;Withnail and I,&quot; a seminal British film), I haven't rushed out and bought other albums by Morrissey because I'm afraid I'll be disappointed.  <br />This is really intelligent music; Morrissey refers to characters from Graham Greene's &quot;Brighton Rock&quot; in &quot;Now My Heart Is Full,&quot; and a lot of the metaphors are quite nice.  If you're tired of alterna-trash and want some truly great rock music, get this, and you won't regret it.

0679879269|5.0|I read The Golden Compass at the end of 1997, The Subtle Knife at the end of 1998, and have been waiting desperatly for The Amber Spyglass to come out ever since. I have grown up, but the characters were still waiting there for me, as passionate and determined as ever. The entire plot is a rushing force, the characters are perfect in their strengths and downfalls. I give The Amber Spyglass the highest compliment I can bestom, and this is saying that it is even better than the first two books in the His Dark Materials trilogy.

The end with Lyra and Will just bothered me, though.  I was hoping for it not to develope into a love story, even though I could see it coming throughout the whole book.  I hope my review doesn't offend anyone, because the first two in the series are two of my favorite books ever, just NOT this one.

B00004XONN|5.0|I'm not going to say anyone is right or wrong when judging this album. I can see why you hate it, and I can see why you love it. Personally, I love it. But this is also because my taste in music stretches past typical pop/rock...and I have learned from RH albums, never to expect what you've heard the last time. I read from another reviewer that some of us would have never bought this album unless it was by RH...which in some cases may be very true. However, a band like RH is lucky enough to use their popularity in order to push their fans' taste in music a bit. Which I think is wonderful. First, for those of you who are unsure about getting this album, I would like to make some recommendations. You might want to first take a listen to all the past recordings of RH in order as they came out. Then maybe listen to one of the Aphex Twin's albums, or even Bjork's Homogenic. I know it make sound stupid, but if you're more open to something new before you go into it, you just may appreciate it more. My two favorites on this album, like everyone else, are &quot;How to Disappear..&quot; and &quot;Idioteque&quot;. The first one (kind of a mix between &quot;Street Spirit&quot; and &quot;End Music&quot;, I think) has all these very typical emotional qualities that you would expect from a RH &quot;ballad.&quot; I like Idioteque because it's not really something I've heard before...which is exactly the point...who wants to hear the same thing all the time?  It's a wonderful album as a whole. No song on it sounds similar to another. I would recommend it to anybody. And with the crap that's out nowadays, we should really take the time to appreciate a band, and an album that actually has something to offer music listeners. For those of you who hated it...well, I truly think you were expecting RH to be something of the likes of Mathbox 20 or Oasis, who puts the same boring, unoriginal song out every year, just with different lyrics. And if you just can't appreciate it due to the factthat you haven't been more subjected to this &quot;type&quot; of music, than maybe you need to broaden your musical interest.
0312243022|5.0|I have read all 179 reviews.  What is this opposition to &quot;purple prose&quot; i.e. something well written, penned beautifully? Down with minimalism and let the language breath!   Is it possible that the English language has deteriorated to such an extent we have all ascended to the top of the tower of lexicon lackadaisical lunacy?  Those who are so repulsed by Mr. Cunningham's use of ornate language, should be conceptual in their observation and see how tightly he wraps this novel.  There is not an ounce of excess to be found.  <br />Whether anyone relates to these characters or the overall theme is not the point. We are witnessing the true artist at his very best.  The truth -- as I see it -- is that Mr. Cunningham uses contemporary language to its fullest and modern style to the max! I deplore criticism of content for content sake alone.  If one wants entertainment, read Barbara Cartland, or anything that Ophra Winfrey person has on her Book-of-the-Whatever club.  <br />I hope this book is never made into a movie! I wish Mr. Cunningham all the financial success he deserves, but I would hate to see Follywood destroy another good novel.<br />If Mr. Cunningham continues to write books of this caliber, his next prize will be the Nobel.   Hip hip hooray for Mr Cunningham!
B000002IAS|5.0|What a tour this must have been! Imagine a pick-up band with Eric Clapton, Dave Mason and Jessie Ed Davis on guitars, the rest of Derek and the Dominoes behind them, Jim Price and Bobby Keys on horns and Rita Coolidge to sing back up vocals. That's the team that Delaney and Bonnie Bramlett fielded for this 1970 gem. Thank God it was recorded! You won't be able to sit still during the opening Things Get Better, which manages to showcase every musician in one killer tune. Delaney and Bonnie's voices are wonderfully soulful in their Tribute Medley to Robert Johnson, and Dave Mason's Only You Know and I know rises to a new level. Bonnie really belts it out during That's What My Man is For, and a fun Little Richard Medley is icing on the cake. E.C. always loved being part of a band, and it really shows here. Everyone playing on this CD was young, healthy, energetic and still learning how good their music could be. I bought the vinyl 30 years ago, and now with the CD, I'm still loving it.Buy it and BOOGIE!
B00004U3UG|4.0|When I bought this movie I was just planning on it being mildly entertaining.  I watched it the same night I bought it, and I was totally taken by surprise.  Bruce Campbell is one of the most unique actors of our time.  This movie fully brings out the best in him.  Although the video and sound quality is not as good as it should be, it's tolerable.  Army of Darkness opened me up to the wonderfull world of Evil Dead, Bruce Campbell and Sam Raimi. Although Evil Dead 2 is better, Army of Darkness should not be passed up.  It should be seen to Evil Dead fans because of the appearance of Bruce, but if you're like me, it is a great first taste of what the Evil Dead Triligy is all about.

B000001FC0|5.0|Many people believed it would never happen but the magical duo that brought you this album just this week completed their first recording session for a new album as Tears for Fears.  It should be very interesting to see what they both bring to the sound board after a long estrangement.  As for Songs From the Big Chair, it is certainly the classic of the 80s as Seeds of Love, in my mind's eye, was the first album of the 90s.  Everything Roland does is superb but, of course, Songs sticks in everyone's mind because it took the whole world by surprise.  5 Primal Screams of Pure Joy!
B000002IZM|5.0|A great soundtrack to a great film, but one little criticism: why couldn't it have included the subtle, tentative, bleak but wonderfully atmospheric piece used over the film's opening credits?<br />Incidentally, anyone who likes this  might also find the Cocteau Twins of interest, particularly their VICTORIALAND album. The TALES OF THE FUTURE track on BR uses Demis Roussos' abstract vocals in a very Liz Fraser-ish fashion.
0684867621|4.0|Nine year old Trisha McFarland, The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon, is out for a short hike on the Appalachian Trail with her divorced Mom and her brother, who are arguing so vociferously that they fail to notice when she stops to relieve herself.  When Trisha tries to get back on the Trail, she becomes disoriented and is quickly lost in the dense woods.  In the ensuing days she will be forced to fend for herself, armed with little more than some junk food, a poncho, a Walkman and a surpassing love for the Red Sox closer.  Battling bugs, bogs, hunger, malevolent woodland spirits and bears, she is sustained by listening to Red Sox games, by visitations from a spirit Gordon and by &quot;The Subaudible&quot;, as her father once described his impression of the divine in every day life.<br />There are a couple of things I really liked about this book.  First, it is one of the most feminist stories you'll ever read.  Trisha is the sole character for nearly the entire book.  She is determined and resourceful and easy to root for in her quest to survive.  Second, I liked the sustaining effect of the radio broadcast of the Sox games.  I am a huge fan of radio baseball; except in very rare cases, I would rather listen than watch.  As it happens, I listen to Sox games too.  Joe Castiglione and Jerry Trupiano are not terribly good broadcasters--especially if, like me, you grew up listening to Bob Murphy and Ralph Kiner do Mets games--but the rhythms of the game, the daily presence and the steady narrative flow over a period of months all combine to make them a welcome presence on Summer nights.  Baseball is the one sport that can be fully captured on radio, perhaps because it is so familiar that we can run the films in our minds and don't really need to see in order to &quot;see.&quot;  Whatever the reason, anyone who has a similar love of radio can easily relate to the comfort that the games provide this little lost girl.<br />There is, however, another aspect of the book which is much less successful, that is the spiritual angle.  Taken purely for what he is, Stephen King is one of the great storytellers in all of literature.  But that is pretty much all there is,  Critics have tried reading more into this book in particular, by taking Trisha's relationship with the Tom Gordon spirit and with the Subaudible to imply that King has found God or something.  Well, it is something, but it's not God.  We Red Sox fans are familiar with Gordon's religious devotion, which he demonstrates by pointing heavenward after every save.  Like her hero, Trisha determines that she will have to cultivate the quality of having &quot;ice water in her veins.&quot;  But Gordon, of course, derives his sublime confidence and self-assurance from his faith in God.  Trisha seemingly derives hers from faith in Gordon and the Subaudible alone.  If King's point is that traditional organized religions are all hogwash and faith of any kind suffices, even faith in a temporarily celebrated ballplayer, point taken.  But to suggest that the book offers any kind of profound new spiritual side of King seems to be quite a stretch.<br />In a way, this is somewhat disappointing.  King had an opportunity here to actually grapple with a weighty theme for once.  The book would be much better, and more significant, if Trisha's experience did forge in her some heightened spirituality.  Her adoration of Gordon could have been a leaping off point for her to consider why his religiosity provides him with such empowering spiritual sustenance.  Her fairly stock confrontation with the creature at the end of the book could have been replaced with a really interesting confrontation with the fact of her own possesion of a soul.  But King's not really interested in these ideas, which is of course his right.<br />Over all, I did like the book; it is helped greatly by the fact that it can be read in one sitting.  I particularly like the idea that thirty years from now you'll be able to pick up the book and recapture one fairly mediocre iteration of the Red Sox (though I found it enormously frustrating that Jason Varitek's name was repeatedly spelled &quot;Veritek.&quot;) and have a whole flood of memories come cascading down. This is an enjoyable enough way to kill a couple hour--an ideal plane book--but if you're looking for any important philosophical messages within its pages, you're bound to be disappointed.<br />GRADE: B<br />(N.B.--except for some brief and relatively mild profanity, the book is appropriate for teens, who should like it very much)book and recapture one fairly mediocre iteration of the Red Sox (though I found it enormously frustrating that Jason Varitek's name was repeatedly spelled &quot;Veritek.&quot;) and have a whole flood of memories come cascading down.

0451191153|2.0|&quot;The Fountainhead&quot; was supposed to be -if one believes the back cover- a book about two architects at war.  But instead of focusing on such an interesting idea -Peter Keating, always leaning on crutches; and Howard Roark, always breaking free with new forms and materials- what we have here instead is a &quot;novel of ideas&quot; that attempts in one swoop to cover the media, altruism and selfishness, and a love story that reminds one of pulp fiction (not the movie, but the &quot;school&quot; of writing).<br />I gave it two stars because, if you can suffer through all the cliches, there's some extremely thought provoking ideas that are inspiring.  Stick to your guns, Rand tells us, and anything is possible.  Don't compromise, and don't listen to others telling you you can't.<br />But oh, the cliches!  Every time Roark raises a building he walks through the skeleton, the girders lunging heavenward (as she might put it in her many variations on this same exact scene), with his hands clasped, with a cool, confident demeanor, languishuing in his own deftness and surety.  And of course the kid on the bike, whom Roark gave &quot;the courage to go on living&quot;.  I suppose some cliche usage is permissable, but after 700 pages it really gets on the nerves!<br />Philosophically the book is very interesting, very foundation-shaking, but it's a NOVEL, of course, not a book on philosophy (of which she has several), and in examining &quot;The Fountainhead&quot; strictly as a novel, as a big story, I'm left feeling cold. Perhaps I'm just a product of my times, but way too much artifice and melodrama, and not nearly enough passion.  Also: far too diffused, too many topics!  Read it for the powerful philosophical ideas, but skip it if you want a good story!

B000002UAR|5.0|This has my favorite album cover of all time, though with the CD this doesn't count for much any more. <br />Musically, the album stradles the early and late periods beautifully. The songs are more sophisticated than the early tunes but still clean and lean. The only regrets are Good Day Sunshine, which I've always hated, and the fact that the high harmonies seemed to be on the wane.  Rubber Soul was the last great album for high harmonies.<br />Note: thankfully, this is not the American version which I don't think even ran a full 30 minutes.
1573225517|4.0|Rob Fleming, a 35 year old Londoner, is extremely average, but the story he has to tell is unusually witty &amp; insightful, especially in his assessment of the mysterious relations between men and women:<br />Read any women's magazine and you'll see the same complaint over and over again: men--those little boys ten or twenty or thirty years on--are hopeless in bed.  They are not interested in 'foreplay'; they have no desire to stimulate the erogenous zones of the oppositre sex; they are selfish, greedy, clumsy, unsophisticated.  These complaints, you can't help feeling, are kind of ironic.  Back then, all we wanted was foreplay, and girls weren't interested.  They didn't want to be touched, caressed, stimulated, aroused; in fact, they used to thump us if we tried.  It's not really surprising, then, that we're not much good at all that.  We spent two or three long and extremely formative years being told very forcibly not even to think about it.  Between the ages of fourteen and twenty-four, foreplay changes from being something that boys want to do and girls don't, to something that women want and men can't be bothered with. ... The perfect match, if you ask me, is between the Cosmo woman and the fourteen-year old boy.<br />and the cultural importance of pop music:<br />People worry about kids playing with guns, and teenagers watching violent videos; we are scared that some sort of culture of violence will take them over.  Nobody worries about kids listening to thousands--literally thousands--of songs about broken hearts and rejection and pain and misery and loss.  The unhappiest people I know, romantically speaking, are the ones who like pop music the most; and I don't know whether pop music hgas caused this unhappiness, but I do know that they've been listening to the sad songs longer than they've been living the unhappy lives.<br />and the vital interstices where men and women &amp; music meet, as we see when he asks his girlfriend one of the great questions in the history of the opposing genders:<br />How can you like Art Garfunkel and Solomon Burke?  It's like saying you support the Israelis and the Palestinians.<br />The book is filled with this kind of sly, snarky Four Weddings-style humor, perhaps too full.  I found 300 pages of the fundamentally immature Rob to be a tad excessive.  But in the end, when he learns that: it's not what you like but what you're like, we can't help but feel happy for his triumph.<br />GRADE: A-in the history of the opposing genders: <br />How can you like Art Garfunkel and Solomon Burke?

Its exiting, it has suspense , its serious, but most of all its funny. All the work that Hugh Jackman, Patrick Stewart and Bryan Singer put into this movie is amazing.

B000001ESP|1.0|Rush wanted to get on the radio so Neil Peart decided to write Limelight and Tom Sawyer. He sold out and it worked. They got FM air play. Gone are the days of 2112 and Hemipheres,where originallity and substance were key to their early unique song writing. MTV garbage is what we have hear. Yes YYZ is the best song on the CD. Witch Hunt also shows some promise. Other than that this was the beginning of the end for Rush
B000002UDB|3.0|I've loved The Beatles since I was 8 years-old, but have to admit that I think this is the weakest of their later albums. There are a few great moments (I Am the Walrus, Strawberry Fields) but there are a lot of mediocre songs too. Many of the songs strike me as superficial -- A Fool on the Hill has a nice melody but is too pedestrian; the title track isn't even a complete song, etc. And I think the album's production is too schmaltzy, a classic example of late '60s excess.
B00004XONN|5.0|I cannot believe that so-called Radiohead &quot;fans&quot; are trashing this CD. So, it's not OK Computer, so what! Get over it. How boring would it be if they tried to capitialize on that album?Radiohead is moving on, visionaries that they are and I applaud that. Unlike, many folks who've posted and said they did'nt dig the album on the first listen, I was hooked from the opening strains of Everything in it's Right Place. I wasn't much of a RH fan till they released the incredible OK Computer, as I found the stuff on Pablo Honey and The Bends alright, but nothing out of the ordinary. Typical &quot;alternative&quot; stuff. Now I feel Radiohead is a force to be reckoned with. I'll be checking for anything they put out in the future and I hope they continue to keep us guessing.

068818071X|4.0|If you want an entertaining story you can't do much better than this - it really is laugh out loud, funny but also  well written book about a potentially depressing subject. Truly Rachael is a character we can all empathise with on many levels. The ending is straight out of a movie and although a little predictable , lets face it wouldn't life be lovely if it could always work out that way? READ IT! BUY IT! GET THE OTHERS! And watch out for her new book just published in Ireland this week - ' Sushi for Beginners'
B00004U8JU|5.0|Most of you know the story and the movie, and you either like it or you don't (I do).  My comments will focus on the DTS version of the DVD.  In short, I believe that this is a reference quality DVD.  I own over 50 DVD's, including most of those that you can use to demo your home theater (Matrix, Air Force 1, Eagles Hell Freezes Over, several Bonds, etc.), and I think I'll be using the T-Rex scene as my personal HT demo scene.  The sound is the best I've heard (I believe Jurassic Park was the first film to use DTS in theaters).  During the T-Rex attack scene, the rain and other sounds surrounding me made me feel like I was in one of the Explorers.  Hearing T-Rex approach, as the drink spits out concentric circles, was unreal on my Hsu subwoofer, with tons of low bass information.  T-Rex's roar was truly frightening, and I've seen this movie a number of times.  <br />Visually, the movie is also stunning.  The dinosaurs look as I would imagine them, and the transfer to video seems excellent.  My only (small) nit would be a momentary pause fairly early in the film when the disc is probably changing layers, but this could be a function of my player (Panasonic A120) as much as it is the disc, although my player hasn't experienced this momentary delay except once or twice before.  Overall, this is a must-own DVD for HT buffs.
B00001SIES|5.0|I bought this CD almost blind folded. i recall listening to it in a record store and thinking &quot;Man, that tunes give chills to my spine&quot; It's just amazing, Matt's voice is truly very similar to Yorke, but the songs go in another direction, which is very pleasing. Muse is no Radiohead wannabe, this band has great stuff to show. I do not agree with the main review here that says that they have no appeal like their fav bands. It's never been the appeal, it's the music, and this is a great collection of songs. I can't help crying every time i listen to Unintended. Buy this thing.
B000001GXE|5.0|As with his recording of Beethoven's fifth and seventh, Kleiber's interpretation of Schubert's &quot;Unfinished&quot; takes a tempo that brings out the searing, steely intensity of the piece, and it succeeds brilliantly. He also chooses a brisk pace for the much lesser known third, and here it has a different but equally successful effect. The third is a happily unselfconscious symphony, and Kleiber brings out its innocence and energy perfectly. I think many conductors try to infuse Schubert's early symphonies with an earnestness that's not there, and I'm glad Kleiber chose to go with what I for one feel Schubert's intentions for this piece were. A good counterbalance to Kleiber's interpretations is Karl Bohm's forthright and convincing series, which I had on LP's a number of years ago but which don't seem to have appeared on CD yet. I hope they come out in the near future.
B000002ADT|5.0|Those who scan through the 2oth Century for moments of supreme musical brilliance need look no further than this album.  Guided by a man who defied musical convention for over four decades yet still found tremendous public acclaim, this is Miles Davis' finest hour.  Ably supported by luminaries such as John Coltrane and Bill Evans, amongst others, &quot;Kind Of Blue&quot; sounds effortless yet complex, ever fresh yet firmly rooted in history and quintessentially jazz even though it has served as inspiration for musicians in all walks of life.  It's the one album that you simply HAVE to hear.
6305358567|5.0|This film is one of the best movies ever made. From start to finish it will completly hold your attention. Cate Blanchett as Elizabeth the first gave the best female performance of the 1990's and one of the best of all time. Every scene with her is worth mentioning. The Parliament scene. The scene where she gets the Mary I (Kathy Burke) ring. Her practicing her parliament speech scene. The scenes she has with Walsingham (Geoffrey Rush). Her &quot;I am my father's daughter speech.&quot; The scene at the end where she walks to her throne-riveting. She gives an amazingly nuanced and remarkable performance that can not be over-praised. The fact that she lost best Actress is one of the biggest robberies in Oscar history.        Fanny Ardant gives an amazingly real performance as Mary Of Guise. An astonishing example of a small role that is made big by a remarkable performance- 100% Oscar worhty. Kathy Burke is great as Mary I (&quot;Bloody Mary.&quot;)Her plea to Elizabeth to uphold Catholicism in England was Oscar Worthy. Geoffrey Rush is ruthless and conniving as Walsingham. His scene where he describes to Elizabeth how she should be seen as a ruler made him deserve the Oscar for best Supporting actor of 1998. Also worth mentioning are Richard Attenborough and Christpher Eccleston.       The direction job by Shekhar Kapur is one of the best of the 1990's and ever. The angles, the close-ups, brilliant. The editing by Jill Bilcock is remarkably done and adds tremendously to the story. The script by Michael Hirst has some of the best lines ever written-an amazing job. The costumes, cinematography, score and sets are by far some of the best of the 1990's and of all time. Especially the costumes and the cinematography.        Overall Elizabeth is the definition of a masterpeice, one of the best movies ever made. Script, performance, technically its all there. A MASTERPEICE.
0783228317|5.0|This film definitely confirmed my view that Terry Gilliam is one of the best film directors of today. Before I saw it, I thought nobdoy could successfully transmit Hunter S. Thompson's classic, \\"Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas\\" to the screen - but Gilliam proved me wrong. It was almost like stepping into the pages of the book. Gilliam totally captured the feel and intensity of Thompson's drug-induced view of Las Vegas and his biting commentary on American culture. \\"Fear and Loathing\\" is thus simultaneously satire, social criticism and psychedelic mayhem. Johnny Depp as Thompson is also fantastic, as he plays the role with a driven, paranoid brilliance. I can't praise this film enough, it's an instant classic.
079073463X|5.0|I have seen this movie probably 20 times. I never tire of it. While there has been criticism about the soundtrack, I can only say that your reaction to it will depend on your taste and how much a movie's soundtrack affects your feeling about the movie. While in some movies the soundtrack is very integral, I think in Ladyhawke the soundtrack is really not that important. I personally enjoy the music very much and I hadn't ever really thought about it--I think it fits an 80s movie and it's kind of interesting and different--however, I recently watched the movie with a friend who said the soundtrack was &quot;cheesy.&quot;  Whether you like the soundtrack or not, the story is so compelling that it is doubtful the music will keep you from enjoying the film.  The story is based on an old legend about two lovers who have been cursed by an evil bishop so that the man, Navarre, is a wolf at night and the woman, Isabeau, is a hawk by day. The lovers' path crosses with that of a thief named Philippe &quot;the mouse&quot;, played by Matthew Broderick.  Romance, action, adventure, and a little comedy ensues to bring you to a dramatic and heartwarming ending. The story itself is at once beautiful, dark, sad and uplifting, and it's definitely the kind of movie that captivates you in a way that will stay with you for a long time, perhaps forever! If you're particularly empathetic you will probably be brought to tears at some of the more poignant scenes. This is an enduring classic that is sure to become one of your favorites if you choose to watch it.

But The Beatles Anthology is no such disappointment! It has everything!<br />It's absolutely beautiful too. The silver cover will immediately catch anyone's eye, even non-Beatles fans. The pictures are FABULOUS. There's some in it that I'd never seen before. There's also wonderful articles and memories. It's perfect as a coffee table book. People have come over and asked me where I bought it! Beatles fans out there are going to be overjoyed at this treasure.<br />It's well worth the price--in fact, I'd have easily paid more! I've already picked up a copy for my friend's Christmas gift!
B00004SYWZ|3.0|Perhaps I was expecting too much, the last album 'memorial beach' was a highlight, and after that, they split up. They came together for this one, and it's not reaching the level they had once. I'm disappointed. The mixing of Morten's voice is bad done, the mastering is okay, they used a few samplers everyone is using, just to sound 'modern'. But I miss the pithiness they were known for their earlier songs...
B00000DGUG|5.0|It's rare to catch music this wise, this frantic, and this beautiful all in the same package.  Too often folks relate Morissette's work with anger and rage, and I think the only reason this is done is because of &quot;You Oughtta Know,&quot; --certainly a classic in bitter, angry resentment, and certainly NOT her only song!  Most of her music, on both of her well-known albums, is more introspective than people seem to notice.  How are &quot;Ironic&quot; and &quot;You Live&quot; ironic?  On this album, which works better as a whole than any of its individual songs for the most part, I detect very little rage, not even towards herself.  This is a collection of works centered on self-counselling, self-awareness, simple wisdom.  <br />&quot;Junkie&quot; is a classic album which must not be forgotten.
0140186409|5.0|This book is a major classic.  The story flows and leads the reader into the depths of the Great Depression.  Amazingly accurate and increasingly personal, the story about the Joads is very emotional.<br />The book starts out with Tom Joad getting out from prison and expecting life to be as it was.  But it isn't, instead his family is about to get kicked off the land by &quot;the monster bank owners in the east&quot;.  As the story progresses, Steinbeck tells of their journey to California.  The place where all their dreams will come true.  But dreams aren't always reality.  When the Joads finally reach California, their fantasies and visons are all shattered as they slowly realize and witness the evils of humanity.<br />The ending is so profoundly emotional.  After I finished the book, I sat there with the book in my lap, just thinking about the ending.  So amazingly written.  Touching and beautiful.  Definately Recommended.
B000002L9Y|5.0|I got this album as a sort of celebration when I went to a national chess tournament.  I got it for three reasons: I love Fleetwood Mac, I liked the title, and the shop didn't have &quot;Rumors.&quot;  So I started listening, and I loved the album.  Personally, I can see why &quot;Rumors&quot; sold [quite a few] more copies, but I personally prefer TITN by a long shot.  The title track is unbelievable, &quot;Isn't It Midnight&quot; can be listened to several times on end and keeps getting better, and &quot;Seven Wonders&quot; is quite simply my favorite song.  Ever.
B00003CXDG|2.0|Mission Impossible II was a movie that was good on action and low on everything else. John Woo's great action sequences are second to none and should be well applauded. The story line of this movie though completely sucked. This movie should have been called, &quot;John Woo presents: Ethan Hunt and his worthless team-mates and foes. Ving's Rhames performance was almost as non-existence as Halle Berry's in &quot;X-Men&quot;. And I `am sorry but, Dougray Scott did not make a believable villain. How this movie grossed so much money I'll never know. This was almost as bad as watching &quot;The Perfect Storm&quot;...almost.
B000001EAQ|5.0|What would you get if you gave an electronica/techno artist the skills to craft well written songs?  Answer: You'd get &quot;Pop&quot;, U2's 3rd album of experimentation and re-invention.  Thanks to Howie B, U2 are able to integrate the aural experience of listening to house/dance/techno/electronica music while still holding onto standard song forms with excellent songwriting craftsmanship.  Criticism came from all over for &quot;underperforming&quot; sales of both this album and tour, but POP will stand the test of time to become yet another essential recording to any collection.  For my money, this was one of the two best CDs of 1997 (the other being Radiohead's &quot;OK Computer&quot;)
B00003CX8J|4.0|X-Men is one of the top three best comic book adapted movies every made (Superman 1 &amp; Batman 1 being the other two). The movie is made in a way in which people who have never picked up the comic book before can relate. No bright color spandex. No over the top explanation of why they have the powers they do. You walk out thinking, &quot;Yeah, I believe that's possible. Every actor plays his or her role to the &quot;T&quot;. This is the perfect jump of movie for Hugh Jackman, who gives an excellent rendition of his comic book counter part Wolverine. Although Halle Berry performance as Storm was not as great as some would have hoped, (honestly due to a lack of lines and badly written at that) she does have the upcoming squeal to improve. I was glad to see that the director, Bryan Singer, did not overflow his cast of characters as some other comic book movies have done in the past. Although this movie could have been called Wolverine and the X-Men, most of the other characters are well represented. This movie proves that as long as you keep the essence of the character in tact, you still can have a successful movie that everyone will enjoy. I can't wait for the sequel. Sentinels anyone?
B000006TRV|5.0|As a wannabe-musician I enjoy this album for it's variety in rock music. As a human being I enjoy it for the story it tells.  What I'm really fascinated about is that I can relate to the charachter Pink in almost every song. The album tells the story of his rock-star life from the cradle and explores how his mind evolves due to different events. &quot;All in all you were just a brick in the wall&quot;, he sings as his daddy dies in the war. His tormentor-teachers are the next bricks, all building up this mental wall against society and other people. His girlfriend leaving him is the final brick and we leave the first disc with Pink apparently going to commit suicide.  The story goes on, revealing more and more, delivering musical masterpiece after musical masterpiece. Most notable are perhaps: &quot;Hey You&quot;, &quot;Waiting For The Worms&quot;, &quot;Comfortably Numb&quot;, &quot;Goodbye Blue Sky&quot; and &quot;Young Lust&quot;.   What can I say? I like this album a lot, it's definitely one of the best albums in rock music-history and deserves a listen. If you, like I, enjoy rock, I guarantee you won't regret anything.
B000001Y9I|5.0|Clearly the best and most progressive album from these guys in a long time.  I can't say I'll miss Ritchie &quot;Dictator&quot; Blackmore&quot; (and neither will his former bandmates from what I understand).  &quot;Progressive&quot; is a term that Ritchie has obviously forgotten as is evident from the crap he's pumped out of Purple in more recent years.  I look forward to more from this line-up which is more than I could say in the past.
B00004X01U|5.0|This is Madonna's best album.If you like computer make up voices then this is the cd for you!!
B00004XONN|5.0|OK, for those of you with your head in the sand, this record is about musicians trying to find a new way to express themselves through their art.  Its not about songs.  It is about &quot;doing things differently or not at all&quot; as Radiohead has pointed out in several reviews.  The bottom line is that these guys made this record for themselves, not anyone else.  Most, if not all, great music is created from this artistic space.  Frankly, what they have done is astounding: they made a record utilizing techniques (in terms of composing, arranging, and instrumentation) they had never used before, and STILL MANAGED TO MAKE A RECORD THAT IS CLEARLY RADIOHEAD.  This not safe music.  Like all true art, it is challenging, and beautiful, stark, and disturbing.  This is not &quot;pasteurized for your protection&quot; music for lemmings.  This is not over-produced Pop Rock or Rap Rock.  This is not ROCK music.  But it is GREAT music because it expresses emotions uniquely, and un-selfconciously.<br />These guys are for real, and so is their music.  Let's hope that their entry in the Number 1 position on Billboard's record charts helps to change record company beliefs about what people want to hear.  For the first time ever, I actually believe there is reason to be hopeful about modern music.
6305078564|5.0|This 6 Tape mini series is the closest that film has ever come to the actual novel. Following the story practically perfect, it stars Colin Firth as the silant Mr. Darcy and Jennifer Etle as the outspoken Elizabeth Bennet.  Also if you have seen the A&amp;E version of Emma, the same woman that plays Augusta also portrays one of Mr. Bingleys sisters Mrs. Hurst.  With wonderful acting and excellant scenery especially Pemberly these tapes are a must for every Jane Austen Fan.
B00004XONN|4.0|OK, the album is extremely abstract and that is quite a shift for some people to get a handle on.  However, I think besides the similarities many people have noticed between Radiohead and Pink Floyd, this album is to Radiohead what Atom Heart Mother was to Pink Floyd.      AHM was a concept album that was a sharp departure from what the Floyd had put out before and after, but it was it's uniqueness that made it fun.  Who knows what path these guys will go down in the coming months and years, but I can only hope that the quality of music they put out continues to increase and that they keep pushing the boundaries.
6304795254|5.0|Once in a while you come across a great thriller. To accomplish this you have to have a great story line, superb acting and cinematography, a generous budget and an excellent styling consultant so that everything's just perfect. And The Game has all these aspects. A wealthy financier (Michael Douglas) who has apparently everything and is bored with life gets a surprise birthday gift from his brother (Sean Penn): the participation in a very interesting and intense game. It is one of these movies that is unpredictable for the most part with action scenes that will take your breath away. The ending is unique and an unpredictable surprise and it gives the movie the final edge to classify it as one of these rare top-rated thrillers.
