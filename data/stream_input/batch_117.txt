B000C5CEWU|2|Didn't fit 100%
B003OAES8I|1|Waste of money. I purchase them for my 2015 Jeep JK. They didn't fit, to small. I took the grill off and tried again, they were just to small for the opening. And they looked really bad. ( Cheep) I instead purchase the Angry Birds complete Grill, really love it. Looks great gives s good look.
B009NCYSJU|5|It was just as described and a breeze to install.
B004MUGBJS|5|Arrived quickly and was very easy to install. The color was a perfect match and the unit works as expected.
B00HHGPIHU|1|Did not fit my vehicle but got excellent customer service when I contacted the company directly!
B00DLMKHVG|5|I put these on my 1998 Jeep Cherokee and almost 6 months later they are still working great mechanical high low beam is awesome, no relight burn time, excellent piece of equipment for the price
B00N3VGPYS|5|Recomendable 100%
B00E1SKMQY|5|Came quick changed out quick great fit on my 01 ford escape
B001O4CIHY|5|These are awesome!!  With the quick release trailer mounting kit, it makes it a breeze to attached and release them from the trailer.  I would recommend the Condor 6400 wheel chock to anyone that want a secure way to trailer their bike.  Great product.
B002LYITR4|5|This Holds alot more stuff than you would think.  It was fantastic for our overloaded trip.  The only thing with having anything on your roof is the air drag costs more gas.  This was the best we had ever had.  I will keep it and use it again.
B00J1COM8Y|5|Incredible fit, looks fantastic, and in Arizona it is very important for keeping dash from cracking!
B00HFWYZO8|5|Great Looking rugs. Meant to order one but I guess ordered two by mistake. These two pairs of rugs were super heavy in the package.  They are thick and nice looking. Instead of returning the extra I decided to keep it for my other car. These rugs make my cars look newer and nicer. They look great and cover a lot of the floor meaning they should trap the dirt really well. Also since they are heavy they don't slip.  Highly recommend them. I purchased the tan ones for my 2005 Ford Mustang Convertible and 2007 BMW 328i.
B00N83366G|5|Great quality.  Heavy rings and stitching stand up to the miles
B000FIA11K|5|Used it in my popup camper. Better than the original because it has setting values. The original one had no numbers so you were setting it to who knows what...<br />Fits perfectly in place of the Suburban it replaced! No adjustments needed.
B003SRHNE8|5|These fit great and I like the feel of them. They were so easy that my son even helped me put them on. I didnt have the time to take all my back seats apart so I got it rigged just right 😉 but it looked easy I just didnt have time to do all of them.<br /><br />Oh I did sew in a wonder womab logo to go with my car a little better 👍🏾
B00AW7S490|5|Fast shipping and great product
B00AZ4RVIK|5|Good quality
B00D8Y780U|5|Great Stuff!
B00Z07822G|5|Constructed with high quality material, it has 6 hooks which hold down my luggage very tightly Very strong and comes in black colour. It is over sized so that I can load up any amount of luggage on my vehicle. It is extremely easy to use and light in weight. I love it.
B005FYJ5B6|5|XS POWER D3400!!! Holy Moly power batman! This battery is awesome.<br /><br />If you’re in the market to buy a battery, wether its for upgrading your sound system or to simply replace your old battery, then this is it. Is it pricey, is it going to last 10+ years, is it a direct fit, or is it durable, HELL YEAH!!<br /><br />Since 2003, I had an Optima yellow top in my IS300 and had to replace it once with another Optima yellow top and I’ve had enough. Replacing a yellow top every 6 years at $200+ a pop… it’s not worth it anymore. I’ve read somewhere that these things will last 10 years no problem, well I’ll see about that. Still skeptical.<br /><br />This bad boy is hefty! It bolts right on like a champ. It comes with the M6 terminal bolt and you can bolt things right up. It does NOT come with battery posts, but can be purchased separately. Some may think this is a bad thing, but it really isn’t since your old battery terminal has a top mounted bolt, simply remove your cables from that bolt and mount it directly to the battery. Since you’re battery is coming out anyways, I’d recommend running a parasitic battery draw test with a meter. Google “parasitic battery draw”.<br /><br />This thing fires up real quick! I think it comes close to doubling up on the CC amps on my IS300. So my car starts right up. Heavy duty for sure, I’ve ran my radio with my car off with an eD nine-4 with DLS Nordica 6.5s and a Audioque d1200 with an Acoustic Elegance ib15, and this thing rocks and after an hour my car started right up.
B00ANJACP6|5|We put these on a customer car at my shop. There were few other aftermarket choices and most were substantially more expensive. I was a bit hesitant at first since one of his was already broken, but the fit was great and there wasn't noise. He was thrilled with price. On car for 4 months now and no problems.
B00W63X0LA|5|Perfect
B0015S95XE|5|I put them on my 1997 Corolla, fit well and work well, I have no issues with them at all and would purchase again.
B000EDUTTK|4|The included instructions were not complete but after looking up a video online we were able to install it.
B00LLU7ALA|5|Hubby LOVES this Chamois!!  He wants to buy more!
B00BFUG64I|5|This stuff is great for cleaning heavy grime on cars. PERFECT for cleaning heavily stained floor mats (not the carpet kind--the heavy weather kind). I've purchased this product previously at online store but it was even cheaper here!
B008RU9EDE|5|F650 filter works well and fits great.  2nd one and both were great.
B010G379OK|5|Looks great on the car. Need to be careful applying - go slowly so as not to rip any of the small parts (gandalf's staff, gimli's axe, almost lost legolas entirely) but all worked out.
B00CK0V65Q|3|I hate that I am required to write something rather then just rating the product.  I can understand requirement if I give poor rating.
B00RW4MG40|4|the hub caps are thinner plastic than I expected. I had trouble keeping one of them on the tire at first, but it seems to have conformed to the tire now. Overall, a decent product for the price.
B00NB8U7S8|5|Great ,very bright, easy installation
B000F4US0S|5|Always use it.
B0002UEOLO|5|This is slightly different colored from the copper anti-seize lubricant that you typically find, but it works just as well. Two years after application, I was able to unbolt my calipers from the hub fairly easily, and they can still be seen on the threads. Does the job and this size tube is actually enough to last you for a good number of years. A little of this goes a long way.
B005DZKORG|5|OEM Mopar part, fit as it should.  It did not come with the license plate light cover, but I expected that from other reviews.  It did have the bulb however.
B00II6ONQU|5|Looks much more expensive than the price paid! Recommended by a friend, who had a set on his streetglide, I installed them on my 06 Electra glide, had to open up the ends with a tool loaned from the auto parts store, other than that it was an easy install.  The looks and sound is fantastic!!  Put a grin on my face, like I said: you can't beat the price!
B008RAD3NG|5|If you have never used them, give them a try...I have found nothing better!
B000ALIT2U|5|I replaced the aging hatch struts on my 1997 Ford Probe GTS and what a difference. A little nudge lifts this very heavy hatch up and it take 2 hands to close it again. Finally a strong support for a large glass hatchback.
B00TBHXC4E|5|This is great for keeping vinyl parts and seats in good shape and protecting them from the sun. It goes on easily and makes it look nice. Highly recommended. I Am pleased with the results.
B00PMN7PJO|5|My dearest Hetalians, look no further for a Hetalia Lanyard! It's in fantastic condition, the Hetalia characters are adorable, and what better way to show off your Hetalian Pride? Other than a Make Pasta Not War Shirt.. Rock on fellow Hetalians!
B00180G366|5|Perfect.  Great quality. 5 stars.
B001GRSYB8|5|Awesome floor mats especially in the winter when snow might build up and stay in the mat and having greasy boots it doesn't mark the carpet since the walls of the mats go up a good amount to prevent both of this from happening. Fit my 2011 Tacoma perfectly..I only got the front mats
B0096QB6M0|5|I gave this as a retirement gift.  Very professional looking, made out of metal not plastic.<br />My friend was very pleased..
B000VSYFFW|5|Easy to install and fit my 07 double cab(not the one with 4 doors of the same size) Tundra.
B00AWRFAHY|5|This stuff works just as good as Plexus on my motorcycle windshield at a more realistic price.
B001C6OJ1C|5|Better than OE tie rod ends. The stupid hex-end OE tie rod end studs are stupid. The castle nut design is much much easier to work with. Grease fittings are a great feature that are also not available on the OE tie rod ends.
B00TBHXC4E|5|What else can I really say but:  It works.  This stuff cleans up Vinyl really well.  Just be sure you read the directions:  wipe it all off before it dries... because it doesn't dry... not ever.  And, you are not supposed to touch it in any quantity.  Be safe and this product will make you very happy.  It works.
B000C847YU|5|It is what they say it is no problem at all
B001TI5IIQ|5|Used once; works well on headlights, though have to do another round after a few weeks. Good to provide more light.
B000N9HZWY|5|In the process of rebuilding my original pump in my '87 25hp Evinrude I accidentally broke the barb off the plastic housing. This was the best deal I found and did not require replacing the mounting screws. Has a brass barb as well so it should last.
B00496KFTW|5|Great fit.
B00E1JBQLS|4|Works as designed but hurts if you accidentally step on it with bare feet. Very lightweight to it can be easily moved.
B00HCOI71G|5|very good
B003BSB7PU|5|Use this in your RV sink-y and you will no longer have a big stinky.  Fabulous at keeping grey tank clean and odor free.
B0026JK8FK|5|I've used this is my 2002 Subaru WRX 5 speed manual and 2005 ACURA TL 6 speed manual transmission. Not only did it shift like it was new but it cured the &#34;notchiness&#34; in 3rd gear that Acura/Honda 6 speed MT's notoriously experienced in the mid '00 models. It also made the WRX shift like it was brand new and upgraded!<br /><br />If you have either one of these vehicles, USE THIS ASAP!! You can thank me later!
B00178WH9G|4|So far so good
B00VNQNRZA|1|These lights are junk put in three none of them work. And their white not red like advertised.
B00BZA260G|5|It's OEM...
B00CBL1E8I|1|Description is misleading.  It said it will fit wheels 175 - 255 mm.  The wheel of my 2006 Toyota Tacoma truck is 255 mm.  Even the Amazon pop-up said it would fit.  Well........ it will fit on my truck's 255 mm rim as long as I don't have a tire on it!!!  It doesn't even come close to fitting.  Sending it back!
B00C6MWGQQ|1|Lasted about 100 miles until cylinder became loose
B007UN13NI|5|I always have a hard time finding gloves that fit and that don't cost an arm and a leg, these fit properly and didn't break the bank.
B00KV8U20O|4|Works as advertised
B005ASY23I|5|Fantastic little device.  Glad I trusted the reviews...
B00QAMKNYK|4|Very nice set of tools
B00F23BNUG|1|These look fantastic in my Jetta's Headlights. Problem is, they started flickering right after two and half weeks of having them installed. The install itself was a gigantic pain in the you know what, and now I'm embarrassed to even leave them on.  UPDATE: They are about 90% burnt out now and flicker like a strobe light. The other JDM ASTAR Bulbs I bought for my city light were fine too until one completely went out. I will NOT be buying this brand again and would advise caution.
B001G8AIMU|5|Good:)
B0002F66F6|4|Great
B000GU18FK|5|made my yfz 450 faster at the top end. Exactly what I wanted
B007ZQM3YI|5|Seriously great product.
B0066R669A|1|The plastic part on this control arm broke immediately.
B000C9MWOG|5|came in when it was suppose to and works great
B00B4YIR56|4|Can this switch be used to replace one on the drivers side?
B00YC28OUU|5|helps with getting in and out of the jeep
B004I5RPM4|5|Looks great. Easy to install
B00BMU9CEM|5|Worked as it said
B00KSDKWZ2|5|Fits perfectly - great product!
B00NFSNAS8|5|I was surprise to received this compressor with a storage pouch, which is very nice.  I have used this compressor about 3 times and is very realiable.<br />Although it's a bit noisy it does the job and doesn't overheat.  The indicator tells you the pressure it's at even when you shut it off.  It pumped my car tires from approx.  22 psi to 30 psi in less than 2 minutes.  I do recommend this product for purchasing.
B000EQ8URA|5|The product came exactly as described.  It fit my 2006 E90 330i Sedan with Sports Package perfectly.  Even the OEM dustcap fit fine even though it is slightly snug.  I've had it on the car for a few months and so far so good.<br /><br />This replaced my OEM strut mount which had bearing noise whenever going over bumps.  The noise was anywhere from a slight metallic scraping noise all the way to a thump sound depending on the size of the road bump I was going over.
B0012TT5MW|5|Good fit great product
B00JGJGLEU|5|Works well.
B001FLQZLG|5|Fit as expected
B004LQR6EW|5|Easy to install and it works. Very easy to shut off.
B003CEJWI2|5|I bought these four at a reasonable price, my van looks brand new
B00K0FGM0M|5|Nice fit. fix the problem no issues
B000Q0P9OG|5|Works like it's supposed to!
B0095RXBKA|1|This was the wrong part but i returned it.
B00K85EL9I|5|I bought these for my 2005 Silverado and they worked everywhere except the front corner light. I ended up buying some with only 1 LED on the side and those fit just fine. They work as described, very bright, and great for the price.
B007CX6DWW|4|The hubcap fits very well. Not too difficult to install, just need to push a little hard to secure the cap in place. The only reason I gave a 4 stars instead of 5 was the fake lug nuts on the caps. The authentic caps have 5 holes instead of lug nuts. Otherwise, everything looks great, matches almost identically to other hubcaps
B000A6Z9AU|5|very good fix for may pontiac grand prix 2003
B00T0R16VQ|3|Stick pads could have been in a sheet instead of small circles.
B000N3W8J0|5|Great way to help reducing swirl marks on your paint.  You need to buy two of these and use the two bucket system.  One for cleaning your sponge or rag with clear water, and one for soaping your sponge.  The grit guard helps by making it hard for your sponge to contact any grit that fell of your sponge and settles to the bottom of the bucket.
B0009XQUKC|5|Many of my specialty tools were stolen and I assume pawned this is to replace my old one. This is a professional quality tool. Very fair price and works great!
B00GWEUT04|1|This unit worked for about a week and already my driver window will not roll back up and down. Very disappointed.
B00WIU718Y|4|Great color ...states truth about complete difference from factory to these. Only problem is there not very bright on roads with no street light u will have to use bright lights for that! Not sure on the life dependence yet just installed 2 days ago but will update if any problems with life of bulbs...but also from what I read and understood they have some type of warranty?? I will have to investigate further. Would recommend for others if u want drastic color change but again not that bright!  *Update bulbs still working but ran into a power problem! I am a GM ASE certified tech and have ran into ALOT of electrical wiring problems but these bulbs seem to be running quit a bit more than 55watts due to the fact they have melted my headlight bulb connectors! I tested a higher wattage bulb in another headlamp assembly I had for car and NO PROBLEMS!  So if it looks like over time u blew a bulb check ur harness plug to make sure it hasn't melted it because these bulbs are very dependable on life expectancy they just run higher than 55watts!
B009TC8IFY|5|Use it almost everyday at work. Works perfectly
B000PDPH3W|5|Product works and is a fair price.
B003BZCZZE|5|Nice
B0030CW396|5|sent pretty quick  just little bend  not a big deal  quick fix to fit the bumper<br />thanks !  (better than go to junkyard to get one)
B0073WEZU4|5|Super
B004UPZXQM|5|My favorite stuff. Chemical guys is awesome.
B00LNM6Y68|5|Very nicely made.
B004M09LZE|5|Nostalgic memories!!
B006LJ1IV4|1|Installed on my 2015 Silverado 2500HD and ballasts got extremely hot and bulbs did not work.
B00Y16E92O|1|these do no fit my 2012 Honda CRV as it says they did. the back one is too long and the front ones are not wide enough
B00UY8B7JQ|5|These are really good quality and look great
B0040CYRWQ|5|Good replacement for Ford van ceiling panel.  The diameter was a slightly smaller than the origional retainers but still did the job.
B00PT18QAQ|4|good product. east to read and operate.......only issue reads about 1lb low compared to digital accutire gage.
B00NGYFKAC|1|Crap stuff from china do not buy.
B001RKH7FS|3|The power cable comes with it is so cheap. They should have spent few more cents to get a better cable. The quality of fridge/warmer is okay
B00W2RBI0K|4|Nice mat
B000JZD7JC|5|Great product, fits perfectly!  Just make sure you buy the right one by looking at the number of blades.  Radiator and condenser fans are two different things but are located in the same area.
B00SZA16Z0|5|GREAT PRICE!! FAST SHIPPER!!
B00B5KZRU2|1|The part is not the right part. It's too big. The  biggest problem is I'm trying to return it, and no one wants to get back with me.
B000FFF3GG|5|Great for water conservation
B00J62PHCY|4|Good price and easy to install
B00D8DR0AO|5|I just bought this on another account for a detail today. I love this product, it works great to remove dirt and as a clay lubricant!<br /><br />My method of use:<br />Fill a gallon or two of water in a 5 gallon bucket and pour an ounce of solution in.<br />Next, grab a wash mitt and a drying towel and dip your mitt in the solution.<br />Wipe your vehicle's panel with the mitt then wipe with the drying towel.<br />Lastly, use your grit guard and rub your mitt on it then repeat.<br /><br />FOR CLAY LUBRICANT:<br />I filled my 32oz spray bottle close to the top, then I poured 1/4 to 1/2 of solution in the sprayer.<br />I believe this worked as good, if not better, than an actual clay lubricant.<br /><br />This is one of the best products I have, and will continue, to use.
B00EPDL4VW|5|Great product
B00FSL07FY|1|When we got this, it was clear that it resembled the part that I needed. However, there was no way it would fit. It was waaaay too small, the package seal had been broken and the bag it was in was ripped open as well, making it clear that someone else had ordered the same part, got this crappy nonfitting one, and returned it. Kinda annoyed that I had to take a loss on a part that didn't work for my vehicle at all, despite the description, both in time and the money I had to pay to ship it back. Don't get this for a 2007 Hyundai Accent!! You will completely waste your time and cash!!!
B00KBBL4H6|1|Junk, don't waste your money.
B0032HQJ7G|1|Didn't work well.  Once you start to tighten the lug nuts, the wheel will shift to be centered by the lug nut and this plastic product gets pinched.  I do not recommend them!!!
B00E6TXW6U|5|This Brake Bleeder is most awesome! I've tried others but still needed assistance from a second person. With this Phoenix Systems bleeder no other person is needed and it works on the first try.
B001B5DA9G|5|Just received my kit in record time from Amazon. To those other lesser reviews if the kit was missing parts I'm certain it was a mistake and easily fixed. To the guy who used the pilot bearing in the kit hell those are just paperweights. Proper Ford Racing bearings are on the way for my 95 Mustang GT. Most anyone will tell you to never use the bearings that come with a clutch kit.<br /><br />I expect nothing but good from this clutch as my original clutch just went after 143,000 miles. Nice heavy pieces and if you look at the same kits on American Muscle the Exedy 350 stage one is a different clutch. This appears to be an Exedy 400 Stage 2 by appearance its just $100 cheaper.<br /><br />Now if only the other companies I bought from were half as easy to deal with as Amazon.
B000C3XDAE|5|AAAAA+++++
B00F8LOAX4|4|The instructions are no help except for removing the old head lights.<br />The Lights themselves look fantastic I get a lot of compliments on them.<br />As far as the review the product itself would get a 5 star but the install was such a headache and<br />when you pay 300$ for an upgrade I think accurate instructions isn't to much too ask so you get 4<br />stars AnZO.
B0038AYV0Y|5|Worth buying! Very happy with my purchase.
B001D9E41I|4|Works as advertised the sticky on the small Velcro squares came off even after using alcohol and wiping everything down.
B0009IQZFM|5|I was pleasantly surprised at how well this worked.  I remember using a chamois years ago that was rather useless so I have been using towels.  After trying this product, I won't go back to towels.  Pre-wetting the towel does seem to help.
B001GMX9TK|5|love it
B004UHRFSO|4|Nice
B0024ECIP0|5|This is the cord to beat all cords! Well constructed and the handles will make it easy to work with...especially with gloves on!
B00E4U6PLA|4|Nice and good price
B0085IL0QC|5|A-ok
B00BTHNEDI|5|Bright, clear lighting. Very happy with this purchase.
B000CPI6VI|5|A-ok
B009PNEIHY|5|worked and fit perfectly
B000C40TAK|5|Good part
B001Q8DMA0|5|great drying towel, wasn't happy when i snagged it on a sharp corner and pulled some strands out of the towel
B00HSR6F5W|5|works and looks great in my classic car
B001XCBCQK|2|flimsey
B000LDB8XO|3|High quality construction. This made it nearly impossible to maneuver without three strong men. Ended up returning after I wasn't able to move it with just my wife and I to work on home projects.
B0049C9XDA|3|Could be a little stronger. Not as strong as factory.
B007ZDFP8C|5|Thanks!! Very good
B004YEZ16G|5|Not an exact fit but was able to easily install using existing set up. Existing clip does not accommodate this part for a 2000 Sienna but still seats properly using screw mounts.  In use for a month and so far, so good !
B004PLAGEK|5|Took less than an hour to install.  Works great and completely plug and play on the 2011 Honda Pilot.
B00J62VV4W|5|Fit nicely
B0079IT1XS|3|First, I discover immediately that the manufacturer's claim (&#34;The Aeroplus has been designed to fit just about any roof bars that fit across the width of your car&#34;) may be true in England but not in the U.S., where round Yakima roof bars are probably half the U.S. market.  I checked with the deflector's maker and no, there is no adapter available, so I had to spend $60 for a machinist to carve a semi-circle into the four brackets that make contact with the round roof bar.  Then I discover that the bolts don't fit through the smaller holes in the deflector, so I had to drill the holes wider.  Then I find that, since I don't have a metric ratchet wrench I had to spend about 60-90 minutes with a &#34;spanner&#34; (monkey-wrench) and pliers to tighten the four &#34;Nylock&#34; nuts on the four separate bolts, each bolt being about 5 inches long, to secure the deflector to the bolts, as per the instructions.  Then I discover that, sure enough, the five-inch bolts are too long: They extend down beyond the cross-bar too far and hit the roof, preventing the brackets from closing on the cross-bar.  So, I had to hack-saw about an inch off each of the bolts, which were already secured (permanently by now, as far as I was concerned) to the deflector, and file the new, ragged bolt ends so that the hand-tigtened nuts would fit them.  &#34;Aeroplus is fitted to the roof bars by two clamps that are secured with two hand-tightened nuts. That's it! - very simple and straight forward.&#34;??  I don't THINK so!  Anyway, I did a test run and found that the wind noise is not excessive (compared to the noise of the bare cross-bar, which was really bad) but that the hand-tightened nuts are not sufficient to keep the angle of the deflector fixed in the face of high wind, given the usage of the round Yakima bar instead of a flat bar such as what Thule supplies (but Thule only sells their cross-bars in pairs, hence my Yakima single-bar purchase).  I bought this wind deflector for thecab of my Tundra pickup, which has a pop-up camper in the truck bed with an overhanging extension over the cab.  I want the deflector to re-direct the wind over the camper's overhanging extension, so I bought only one cross-bar to mount the deflector.  Now I'll have to figure out a way to keep the deflector's angle fixed in high wind, maybe by securing a brace or two between the deflector's rear face and the camper's overhanging front face, a distance of about four inches.  The deflector is sure to keep bugs from splattering across the front of the camper's front extension, but It remains to be seen if the deflector actually improves my gas mileage or reduces the buffeting from passing semi-tractor-trailers and other sources of high wind.  I may have just spent a bundle and spent agonizing workshop-time simply on a fancy bug-deflector that gives a bat-mobile look to my truck cab.  I'll add an updated review in a couple of months.
B008FCG3XI|3|I like it and it does it's job nicely in my volt's trunk but after one year it still smells strongly of phenolic plastic. Very distinct sweet smell while not horribly objectionable it's just surprising it has not gone away after a year. Doesn't protect the carpet and match my other weather resistant floor mats perfectly. I have a volt shelf in the back of my car and therefore the trunk is sealed in but for those without a volt shelf your car will smell strongly for quite sometime and I'm not certain will go away within a year.
B003UVCY00|5|My husband loves this, and just in time for the Frio River vacation and the hill country of Texas. It was awesome and not have to worry about it getting wet and stay charge for the entire week, we only use it at night when neeDed
B00G6188EM|5|The best TRON effect rim tape on the market. Great adhesion and lights up like crazy
B00NLQXUCA|5|Great colour match!  This metallic paint blended in perfectly.  Great value, thanks!
B00KCQSIRY|4|Took 3 daya to receive it. I put it on my '08 TL and I will say for the price I'm very content. Wish the backseat would of gave with a hole for the arm rest but it gets the job done. Add some flot mats and 5 stars
B00LQHR9GE|5|Just finished installing the light bar on the front upper roll bars of a Teryx4 UTV. The curved light fits nicely around the curve of the Teryx4 roof as I hoped it would. The problem with the curvature is that the mounts end up needing to be mounted to a curved surface or fit exactly between the roll bars. i was going to mount this to a flat panel mounted to the roll bars... Didn't happen. Had to modify some additional mounts that I had from other ATV's. I wish now that I would have purchased the straight bar for installation ease. I haven't taken this on the trails yet but tried it in the yard. It turned night into day and made my headlights unnoticeable. There also are some issues with the manufacture of the unit. The assembly covers weren't the correct shape and noticeable gaps are present. I will be sealing this unit prior to taking it in the rain / streams. Update: Took the unit on a night ride in the mountains of Windrock Park, TN. The light performed great. The trails were lit up clearly at a far enough distance to drive at a rapid pace. The wide angle lighting made it possible to handle the tightest turns with confidence. There were occasional light showers and a week later no fog or leakage (I did seal the unit with RTV). I used the Mistuning 40 amp light bar wiring harness and it performed as advertised. The light bar held up well to the jarring terrain and moisture. I would purchase again if I had another vehicle to put it on. Changed the rating to 5 stars from 4.
B00FWOQ094|5|Works just fine.
B00Y2GZI6O|5|Installed on an 08 avenger, fit and sprays like it should. Shipped on time very pleased
B00IVA50K6|5|Great!
B007AOQUGC|5|No issues so far, we'll worth the purchase.
B00BC127DO|5|This logo was as described.  Very easy to apply, and has been durable so far.
B00AWRFAHY|5|Fixed my issue
B00IO99ZCI|4|Good quality for a low price. The only problem that I have with these is that they are noisy when I apply tge pedel to stop. Other than that they have great stopping power.
B00G7RP1V8|5|Maybe this will get the point across to those I work with. Service was very prompt.
B00Y1HTY64|1|Did not bother telling me upfront that I need 2 keys already in hand to program new keys. I only have 1 and had to go spend 100 at dealership to have 1 made.
B000CO7E6M|5|Great price fast shipping.
B000IYSKAK|5|Bought to replace my original condenser fan on a 2007 Dodge Ram 1500 hemi. Matched up nicely against the stock one, and other than the expected modification (around the coolant lines), it was a great fit.  For anyone looking to do this, I highly recommend checking out the video from 1AAuto, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1t4rYxz40U, that details how to do this swap.  My setup was slightly different (didn't need a 13m to relocated the fuse box, as it was held in place with clips), but it made the rest of the process go a lot faster.
B004MDEVBU|5|I bought this for my 2012 Hyundai Santa Fe. I have never installed a hitch before, I got a YouTube video and with the help of a friend we installed this hitch in about 45 minutes . Everything went according to the directions on the video, make sure you have the necessary tools  before starting the installation. You will need a friend to help you hold the hitch up unless you're stronger than I am!
B004W974QS|5|They fit my 1993 silverado ss454 perfect not a flaw anywhere. I would recommend these for anyone , I give them two thumbs up
B00BITLQ8C|1|Purchased and installed two of these for left and right on 2002 ranger.  Worked for exactly 4 months.  Both broke within the same timeframe.  Very disappointed as I now have to order a new pair (will pay extra for OEM this time) and have to remove and install again.  Don't try and cheap out like I did, and save yourself time and money by avoiding these.
B006X8AVG6|4|Came with a few bars bent in. Covered them with a towel and hammered them back. Now it looks great! The sides of the bars are black with the polished face just as it should be.
B0066T5RH0|5|it works
B0019FJM9K|5|100%recomended it's cheap but its good material and it look awesome I'm 185 lbs (85kg) of weigth and i get a M and fits perfect for me !
B001KPGBS4|4|installation kinda sucked, required drilling into frame. once it's on it was great.
B00ZUYFEXO|5|Great love them
B009RRZVXS|5|Great product
B000760FWU|5|When setting up my rv for the winter stabilizes the coach better
B00MA6QBSM|5|Good buy
B00VNJ4Z30|1|Looking forward to get this cool looking antenna for your 2003 Jeep Liberty? Well, keep looking, it won't fit.
B002302KK8|2|It's OK for how expensive it is. Due to vibration it's also somewhat difficult to make out objects in the mirror at highway speeds.<br /><br />My left mirror also broke and fell off while driving down a gravel road. Granted the road was bumpy but I wouldn't expected to just fall off without hitting anything.
B001P1037S|5|Works perfectly very easy to install in my 05 4 Runner, adjusted on the fly with no problems.
B00B3YM76M|5|Great Product and great service..
B000N321MO|4|WORKS GREAT !
B003G1RU5S|5|Great Product and great service..
B00HSRNVRW|4|Works great!!
B0055FFMGM|5|Great Product and great service..
B00YDKDDRA|5|This helmet rocks!  Old style 1/2 shells look like a mushroom sitting on your head and the wind catchs the lip of the helmet on highway rides, which causes your neck and shoulders to hurt from fighting the wind on longer rides.  Novelty helmets cut right thru the wind, but offer no protection and are illegal where helmets are required.  This helmet offers the best of both worlds!  No mushroom head, no sore neck and shoulders, but legal and offers as much protection as a 1/2 shell can offer.  Also love the chin strap system.  No more fumbling with D rings or trying to get the clip in just right.  This one you just push the male end into the reciever and done.  Time to take it off, you just pull a small tab and it is done.  Best helmet I have owned yet!
B0031XULF2|5|I liked it.  I got another one for the other side too.
B000HDJLSW|5|Great rack for the money. The hardware is good accept for the strange twist on bolts. Makes it very hard to secure quickly. Save yourself some stress and just get 4 bolts you can tighten with a socket. otherwise this rack looks and feels awesome on my 98 Toyota 4Runner. I also bought the 24 inch extension. Plenty of room for sunroof to operate and the rear hatch.
B00BR1R8N8|5|It does what is supposed to do, it shuts of the Active Fuel Management on my 2007 Chevy Avalanche and no more burning oil. This is a pretty common issue on 2007 chevy 5.3 liter with AFM. Also fuel MPG didn't change at all in traffic, highway I got 20 Miles per gallon so no change there as well.<br /><br /> If you notice your truck is going low on oil and you have a 5.3 liter with AFM try this Gadget.<br /><br />I give a thumbs up !
B007NVSXR6|2|I have had two reconstructive surgeries and have been looking for something to give my arm/shoulder more support.  This was not it.
B00F5LWJBC|5|Very nice package starter kit worked perfect for our 1st RV trip.
B009E32DGS|5|Expensive but it is the first sun shield that really fit!!!!!  I have tried them all I swear.  M.ost don't fit well or are too flimsy.  I have a black interior which will heat up more than other colors plus I really don't want it to fad to a gray!  I take care of my investment!  This shield is a stiffer material which you would think would be harder to put up but it FITS the window as advertised for MY car (Jeep Grand Cherokee).  It F-I-T-S. It stays in place. It rocks!  I chose the rose color since my car was red and it is really a beautiful and classy looking color.  Its one of the 'small stresses' that are gone not fussing with a sun shield for the car!  Very nice indeed!
B00EDY7DUY|5|Thanks :)
B000BYNN3G|5|OEM part for Stihl FS 45 string trimmer. The wire had very little slack and I was unable to get the plug boot far enough out of the way to change the plug, so I had to cut off most of the plastic guard to get to it with a socket. If you have a longer cord and/or sockets with thin walls, you might be able to avoid trimming the guard. Hope this helps.
B00196FDOW|5|I have ordered five to date for my customer. the only way they could have been more was if they could install themselves
B001DKQL6I|5|its been about 9 months and no issues yet
B000C1MWGM|5|High quality. Smooth ride, highly recommend!
B00Q34AIUO|1|Stinks like burnt rubber. Disclaimer in package says causes cancer!
B003E3NZXO|5|This was a great addition to my truck, installs in about a minute.
B002O1P9SG|4|Excellent fit no guess work
B001YIYAYO|5|Amazing product to say the least. VERY well made, clean edges, smooth holes and super easy to put in. Changes the look and feel of the bike 110%. A must have imo
B00TUJ9PO4|5|:)
B00VNJ49E0|1|It didn't fit properly
B00BEXUQVU|5|Very good quality decals which have held up well on my vehicle for over a year. They are recommended for glass but I put them on the sides of my Jeep being as I'm a former 19 Delta NCO and have gotten a number of compliments and people giving me thumbs up in traffic.
B00FH8P1DG|5|very bright...great light...fast delivery
B000ALJ5I2|5|Great as advertised.
B007W57YG4|4|Good fit and does the job well. Had to keep tight. I have not used tools to tighten.
B00K24JEJM|4|Great product for the price
B006RW5NNY|1|It sucks
B002UX7I9G|1|Thought that these bulbs would be a great asset to our night time country driving. Liked the light they provided but expected that the long life described by the manufacturer would last  greater than three months !  You would have to be crazy to ever buy them at the full suggested retail price and even at the discounted price I  now feel ripped off.  Never had such a short lived light bulb. Bad choice.
B001UCEUUS|4|I give it a 4 because they were too thick to put in the caliper, so my mechanic had to shaved them down some.
B005CEJKE6|4|it good for a filler
B000BVRZ74|5|Love to use this on my windshield! Rain just beads off!
B009I6BMUE|3|Be very wary if you intend to pair this bumper with a valance for a Ford Ranger (mine is a 2003).  I bought a valance from Evan-Fischer that was also for my Ranger and this bumper WAS NOT compatible.  The ends of the bumper were not recessed to fit the valance and the slots for the 4 tabs on each end were also not there.  Its a solid bumper and took primer and paint very nicely but you will need all the bolts, washers, nuts, etc. because this came with nothing, not even directions.
B0040DXAWI|5|Great wide angel mirror
B0023W5GE8|5|I got what I expected. Very satisfied with my purchase.
B001J0WF08|5|Good product.  Works well and the fiberglass pole flexes well also.
B007Q144I0|5|exactly as described, excellent price
B00JBJ3IL4|1|These things look great.  They are packaged well and I was very happy with the look and the finish.  The fit was good though I  had to enlarge a mounting hole and the the bulbs seemed a little loose when installed in the housing. Seems like poor tolerances that helped lead to condensation on the inside.  Using different O-ring and die-electric grease will help seal these areas better.<br /><br />However, my first automatic car wash yielded condensation in all housings. Lower lights were worse than head lights. I contacted the company and sent pictures.  This was mid June.  It's obvious the leak is from main union of clear lens. SPPC agreed to swap them out, but I had to provide credit card to avoid being without headlights for a week.  I guess they are back ordered because I have been waiting for many weeks.  I washed my truck two days ago and there was water standing in lower housing.  Today I removed to drain and dry and I noticed the chrome coating on the inside is corroding.  It's also corroding on the rear/back of the housing.  It's obvious that these housing will not last.  Only normal car wash soap was used. It's apparent that inferior processes and materials were used. Probably explains 30  day warranty. Photos show damage to reflective coating on inside of both lights and discoloration on outside showing coating seems attacked by standard car wash soap.  I feel amazon shouldn't sell items that are this bad.  I only hope i get replacements so I can sell them.  I guess I'll put old ones back in until I find alternative. Please get involved Amazon.
B000C9FYPU|5|exactly as described, excellent price
B0013WFURM|5|ok.....
B004711K34|5|Worked perfect for my 1994 Ford F-250. Had to drill out the original one that was broken off.
B000RFSARI|4|Haven't used it yet but it looks like it will do the job
B003CJIPOY|5|This fit perfectly on my '87 ninja 500. It took less than 5 minutes to make the change from the old broken one. Very simple.
B000S2UGWC|5|Easy install and works as new
B0023VIKSS|5|Verry Good Item.
B00JW1WM2C|1|When its after market product there is always apart thats doesn't fit..in my case the two hosing inlets are the wrong size. .dont buy anything that is not from dealer item
B00KGID0ZS|5|No problems works great
B00029JXNE|5|Put this in my civic. Dont know why it didnt come with one. Anyways, I don't know how I managed to get all the wires hooked up right the first time. It works!!! Directions that it came with helped alot. Im don't know much about electronic circuits, but I still got it in my car easy.
B009TRUFYQ|5|Loved it! No complaints at all. It's prefect right in my back car window.
B00DHVEXIE|5|Perfect fit to give me more room in my 1974 Corvette. I was also able to use original Vette horn button and it increased a already good steering response, into a really crisp response. Feels good in your hands, comfort level excellent, would definitely buy again
B0053PLFYM|5|I was having problems with a check engine light staying on.  I used Hot shot to clean my injectors which I believe in time cure the engine light.  Also will have the turbo waste gate inspected and replaced if needed.
B000EDUTVS|3|Good for dog tie or alt tie down.  Mine has bent though so could be stronger. Hard to get into ground too
B000NWA5VY|5|Great product! Factory at less than half the price. Simple to change with the right tools.
B006MX7ZB6|3|I bought these for my dad and they fit. It's a good price fit the complete set and it qualified for one day shipping so i got it the very next day which was great. It's not the best material but for the price I guess you can't complain. It matched the original upholstery in the car so you can't really tell there is a cover on it.  It isn't a prefect fit because it's flat where the seat curves around the back but at least it does not keep you from sitting comfortably.  So far it gets 3 stars from me.
B000BQWLE6|2|Please change the photo to put this thing in context. For those of us who shop with pictures it's deceiving. This thing can hold one empty can of soda that's it. I expected it to be huge. My loss for not reading more
B000COSATC|5|Lowest price for a quality gas charged shock absorber as I had shopped other vendors and sites. I installed them on my classic pick up this weekend and significantly improved it's ride and handling.<br /><br />Note: the manufacturer should have included new bolts, washer, and nut for the bottom portion of shock  installation as only only top ones provided, which is half-baked and illogical.
B00R2S1PI4|5|Fast delivery. Work perfectly. I recomended.
B00KPR6TBM|5|I used these to make a custom hideaway TV mount. I had searched forever and found these to be basically the only solution available. They were extremely heavy duty, and the ability to lock them back in place was great. The fact that they come in several different lengths is nice, too. The TV was nowhere near their rater weight limit, but they sure to feel like they could take quite a load. I would recommend.
B009SIO9ZW|5|Great product
B000DINKPQ|4|The horn works well.  I read a review by another shopper that said that this 72112 low note horn sounds better when paired with the 72102 high note horn.  I paired this with the high note horn and it sounds good.
B00SLLYEQQ|5|Very happy with this cover. Love the extras. Easy to install. One person could do without a problem
B00LW9G1BA|4|Works and fits as described.
B00ELHNKB4|3|worked good
B005O25CXE|3|I took a gamble and lost big time.  I saw the mixed reviews and figured maybe user error--thank you user who took pictures with their red Grand Cherokee. Well guess what? Wrong! I followed all the instructions and just as many reviewers had said, they fly off.  I might try the Weathertech ones next time, maybe.  I have never had a problem with the exterior mounted versions (except for some added noise) on my other trucks.<br />UPDATE: I called the maker (Lund International) and a service rep listened to my complaint.  Then they had me take a picture of my car with the visors on (minus the one that is on the interstate, obviously).  Within 7 days I received a new set.  It has been over a month since I attached the missing visor and they all have stayed on.  I'm very happy that they stood by their product and therefore updated my review.  I was very upset when it came off, but now I'm very satisfied with the service I got from the maker.
B00BAX0MTA|4|Easy install fits perfectly in the cargo area. I was hoping for a bit more cargo space for groceries but I think it will be enough.
B00L847KGE|5|Great Product and yes i would buy again.
B00JM208IG|5|Great product, easy install.
B002DU3TTO|5|Good product, excelent quality.....
B000C7WTBY|5|ok
B003AOOD9M|5|Fit my 1992 Jeep Cherokee 4-door well.  They fit tight and do not budge. These seals crack, and the doors can hold water.  Hopefully replacing this helps my problem.
B006W5HV40|5|Works well so far and the color is spot on.
B0000AY50X|5|It worked great on my boat.
B00KTJ7IGQ|1|This is for an elder lady's car and the buttons are much harder for her to push than the OE fobs
B00AM2501A|5|EXCELLENT Product. Easy to install and the fit was perfect.
B00HNMLQAG|5|These are great for popping off the plastic door sills and interior panels of modern cars without destroying the panels or the clips.  Probably not strong enough for daily pro shop use, but at this price point, they are not sold as professional tools. Perfect for the DIYer.
B0009XQUJI|5|great product , easy to use and the price was right
B002X6VXL4|4|working very well. Filling a tire was a bit troublesome due to the short air hose. But I would recommend this item to a friend....
B000C7QMGC|5|I bought this one for my '88 Bronco 5.8L and returned it for a Spectra F8E.  Be sure to measure the fuel sender unit size and match it up accordingly.  This one (F8D) is the larger size.  See my F8E review for more info on this tank and tips/tricks for installing it.
B008FCCY04|4|Durable, heavy weight. Holds coolers and other things in place. Great addition to any bed without a spray in liner.
B00OO1OPJS|1|It doesn't fit good at all I had to throw it away because it broke being put in. I believe It was for the drivers side but said left side as well
B004ME11FS|5|Very nice product.  A bit stiff but not a problem.
B00N7C2O6G|4|Not bright
B005H7DRQA|5|great
B008TXSB6U|5|Background: I have used K&N intake kits in numerous vehicles in the past. A few have had minor design flaws that were slight irritations, but certainly not anything that scared me away from continuing to purchase K&N products for each vehicle I own. Fast forward to my use of this product...<br /><br />Installation: The installation of this product could not be easy. The directions were clear, easy to understand, and extremely simply. I am not a mechanic by any stretch of the imagination, but I was able to simply and easily install this product in my truck in only about 40 minutes.<br /><br />Power: With the turbo charged F-150, there is a normal turbo lag when you first press on the gas pedal. It is difficult to explain, but if  you have ever driven a turbo-charged vehicle, you know what I mean. With this installed, I think the turbo lag has been greatly reduced, and once the turbos are fully up to speed, the engine doesn't know any limits. The power increase I've noticed has been tremendous, especially when pulling heavier loads like my skid loader or camper.<br /><br />Economy: I have noticed about a 1.5 to 2 mpg increase after installation. I do not drive conservatively at all, but if you did, I would only imagine the difference would be even greater.<br /><br />I could not recommend this product more!<br /><br />The one drawback, if you can call it that (I obviously don't considering the 5 star rating), is you will be able to hear the intake as the turbos spool up to speed. It sounds like a vacuum, and with the quiet exhaust notes of the eco boost motor, I think it's even more noticeable. In my opinion, this is not an issue but wanted to mention it.
B00NFSNAS8|5|I bought one for my son and one for myself. Very practical. Loved the product & the service.
B00MYA78D6|5|Excellent job. No issues whatsoever. Received weather tech mats in two days from shipment. All is well! Thank you!
B007PYFFXQ|5|Looks great on the car. So far no one has smashed in my window. LOL
B004UGGTK0|5|Great quality.
B0086I9KEU|5|Very nice key ring.
B005NLQAHS|5|Awesome. Works without a hiccup in my 98 f150. Have yet to test the jag, but a great product
B001AZW61K|5|Very nice key ring.
B00QXYL6LY|4|I dread putting these on, but thankfully today was a hot day so the cover becomes stretchable straight from the hot mail truck. I put it on immediately on my 2000 Toyota Tacoma's 15.5 inch steering wheel and it fits on there nice and tight. There is a white rubber inlay inside the cover that gives it better grip on the steering wheel to not slip out of place. Putting it on will take strength to stretch it onto the steering wheel, and was glad I managed to do so a little easier than I thought! In the process though, a thread came loose from its stitching so be careful putting it on. I just stuffed the loose thread under the steering cover and put a little piece of tape there to keep it from coming out so I don't accidentally pull on it while doing a turn. The fake carbon fiber inlay looks nice and is squishy to the touch, while the leatherette is nice and not cheap feeling.
B002JBDH26|1|Advertised as metal, IS NOT, junk. The threads on mount studs do not match original nut which you have to use to secure, result the stud broke off rendering the latch useless! DO NOT BUY, TOTAL WASTE OF TIME! Amazon refunded $ directly. I ordered another all metal latch from another seller and it actually is all metal and is $1.50 cheaper!
B004GE6NFM|3|The product is fine.  The item pictured is a driver's side fender which is what I needed. They sent a passenger side finder.  I printed out a return slip but UPS refuses to pick it up.  If you will issue a full shipping label I can drop it off at a UPS store.
B00QSLNG06|3|They work but when I press my brake pedal with the car off it chimes like my lights are on. I'm thinking these are 7440 not 7443 bulbs.
B00EI6CKVE|5|&#60;3 this soo much! I get stopped all the time when people read it. Good quality!
B00684TAYY|5|This is a great remote! Took less than a minute to program and the directions are very straight forward. Much better deal than compared to the tons of money I would be spending at a dealership!
B00QKXCNNI|4|Very nice. Shipping was a little late but the quality of the goods was great.
B001EAQTRI|5|I've been using a Tendak bluetooth car audio kit to listen to music via on my phone via the car's AUX port. I was getting a very annoying hissing noise that was mostly drowned out by the music but still audible at lower volumes and enough to be an annoyance. Instead of having to buy a more expensive, better filtered bluetooth kit, I thought I'd give this filter a try. Success! Absolutely no hint remains of any feedback or hiss from the charging port and I couldn't be happier.<br /><br />- Install takes 2 seconds<br />- Great price (a cheaper bluetooth kit + this is still cheaper than the more expensive kits)<br />- Works exactly as advertised<br /><br />My one single (tiny) nitpick: there is a cord on both sides of the device which I think is a bit unnessessary. It would be better if there was a short male plug and a female plug built into the side of the filter housing just to reduce clutter a tiny bit. Both cords are short though so that's a positive.
B0085IL8XM|5|A-ok
B001CAR6PY|5|solid
B005G9C846|5|Awesome lights.  Well worth the money!!
B00DSL8ZGO|1|Utter junk. Arrived crushed but thats USPS for you. Ground wire was detached from connector on circuit board. Electronics case is in no way water proof or resistant and feels like it will break. Opened the case to redo the ground cable and found the circuit board had a chunk missing which is also why it didnt work. It has two LED connector slots to add a second strip, when i contacted the seller they asked why i opened it and said that now they dont know if i broke it or if it was defective. Really? I could have said nothing and just returned it so why would i lie about it? Plus you have to open it to expand it with two strips. Plus why would i send it back? The cost of shiping would be more than what this junk is worth.<br /><br />This of course is my fault. If you buy cheap, cheap quality is what you get.
B000JFHNEC|5|Item as advertised and delivered promptly.  It works just fine allowing me to use my AC gauges and hoses originally purchased for R12 systems for use on the R134 connections.
B0062O404K|5|Great.  Husband loves it.
B0019I0B38|5|great brake pads, VERY QUITE
B00FJ5LBOA|5|Use this to blow leaves and it works just as good as the expensive blowers.love the Compact size I was able to give this duty to my 5 year old as a chore and he can handle it and enjoy it.
B009IKAARQ|5|works very well. very tough.
B000E4PNCC|5|It's a mirror, it works. It's not the same color as my car, but I can't complain too much. My sister wound up breaking off my original mirror when she was biking around the driveway. I'm just glad amazon had what I needed.
B005OVDIN6|5|The part work perfect the price was amazing and the speed of delivery was very satisfactory thank you very much
B005BHX3QK|1|Not at all satisfied. Was advertiesed as fitting small block 350 from 1980-1996 it does not. So my 1994 LT1 small block 350 remains dipstick less. Id bother to return it but I'd rather keep it and remind my customers not to by it.
B004UQG23E|5|Theses strap are exactly what I wanted ..They fit perfectly
B009DJTAVE|1|This rating is for the product not the vendor. The first pair I received worked for about 2 months. And I took a long time to ensure I was installing everything properly. I even replaced the motors. I was frustrated and reached out to the vendor through Amazon for replacement. They said I had to send mine back before I would receive new ones. I dragged my feet, never sent back the defective ones back and a week later received a replacement pair. They failed after about 2 weeks. Since we had problems with the first pair we didn't use the back windows more than once in those 2 weeks and somehow they still broke. Window falling down and have to push up with my hands to close. Poor quality... horrible product.
B00180G2HQ|1|Amazon said this fits my vehicle. It does not and now it's too late to return it.
B007EA6PS0|3|1 1/4 size hitch wobbles too much, otherwise ok
B000CO9YPG|5|I really like this thing. Super heavy though. Fell through the bottom of the box and jacked my foot up.<br />Reliable jack.
B007ZD3FE8|3|They are ok, but if you have a problem do not expect weather tech to warranty the item. If you did not buy it from them they said it is not their problem.
B00FWP8QBS|5|It was exactly what I needed. It matched my other wheels perfectly.
B00D8L3SHU|5|very good great service
B00U6HXX06|5|Good pads last way longer than<br />Oem
B001DRHMQO|5|Fit ok in a Volví XC60 D5 diesel
B002MW6HRO|5|This product is pretty self-explanatory.  My personal use case was to provide a dash-mounted USB plug for my new Pioneer stereo that only had rear USB inputs.  The cord and plug both seem to be of decent quality and perform as expected.
B0049KXF4A|5|Not even expected it, really,  really good!
B00KBINF7G|1|Didn't last 8 months. Won't take a charge anymore. No warranty. They say 12 months, but only back to the manufacturer, and there isn't any manufacturer information.
B000E4PV6U|5|Perfect fit. Hope it lasts, seems to be a little thicker handle than factory.
B00VSC6CWO|3|These work well enough, but since they could easily have lengthened the portion that holds onto the visor when extended so that it does not get so flimsy or fall off when extended to the max. Does the job when the sun is within the reach of the extender.
B0057FJNIS|5|Perfect!
B00E9HWRK6|5|You can't beat the price and shipping is super fast. I placed the order, pushed confirm on the order and order shipping adress and there is a knock on my door. The darn matts was there and ups was pulling away!!!!!! Mind blown.......seriously fast shipping and a good quality product and great price. Buy with confidence
B00OH0S5Y2|5|This is one of the only brand I trust when it comes to Led bulbs. Great products these were no different.
B00K8730SE|2|Fits my 2015  XP 1000 (2 person) very well but tore easily when it caught on a rather rounded, not sharp, license plate bracket..overall I am NOT pleased with this product
B0009F9UZM|5|Saw the video on YouTube on how to install with the part number for that item it fit perfect no problem 10 minutes insulation would recommend to a would
B00W8H4KH2|5|I've been looking for a reliable charger of some sort when I go camping and I've found it. I do alot of camping where there is no electricity and there have been time where my phone has died or my truck as died and its not a good feeling when you're all alone in the middle of no where. I've been looking for something small that I can carry in a back pack and this product is it. I've tested my phone and truck battery with the viper and it works flawlessly. Its comforting know that I will always be able to charge my phone and truck when needed. Everything else is a bonus. I can pump up a tire or an air mattress if needed. Over all I'm happy with what this kit has to offer and would highly recommend it.
B001GSGQOE|1|bent and ruined
B00I8OK7X0|5|30 minuts to install, rugged as all get out and what a bargain!  The factory hitch is $395!  Great product and great company.
B00FALVU3U|4|Best stuff on the market

B00JMAPU4A|5|Best oil made. Great service.
B00ZSGKUCO|4|Bucket seat covers were good, but the back bench seat cover did not workout for my ford sport trac
B00KTI0KKI|2|Great delivery and took keys to dealer to be programmed and cut, works well!
B008O111XC|3|What I expected
B0054EHCQW|5|A lot of comments from those at work as my ID badge is on it!
B00AMLQ74K|5|These are great, and a perfect fit for my 2015 Black Ram 1500. Installation was easy, but take people seriously when they tell you that you have to swap the rear brackets right for left. I ignored them and installed the brackets on the truck, but the bar then won't fit. Swap the brackets and the bar fits perfectly. It's a bar fitment issue, not a truck fitment issue. With the bracket swap, the install took about 90 minutes. Look great, and my wife and 10 year old daughter appreciate the help getting into the truck.
B001DKQNUC|4|Nice clean bubble.
B00558Q1BY|1|It's not what i expected
B00PC16LL4|3|I mean I like it but theres some times I could barely hear it. I don't know if its the car exhuast or if its the wrong size. its like one of those things that havge their days, for example I herd it loud and clear this morning going to work, but there are some other days I could really not hear the whistle
B00SZ7XJ8K|5|LOVE IT...NEED I SAY MORE
B0063CU52M|4|Installed on my 2015 Honda CRV.<br />Prompt delivery.<br />Adequate packaging and protection.<br />Well made, quality product.<br />Easy (&#60; 5min) installation.<br />Good fit.<br /><br />Wish it were wider.<br />Recommended
B00CTLGSZO|4|easy install, nice view of rear of vehicle
B00AN5REV0|1|These stated they would fit my 4runner but they did not. I have to return.
B00K35QQTG|5|It works great.  I am very pleased with this product.
B005A0S7IW|2|Lasted all of 2 months!
B001F7GJMK|5|Denso is the factory part for my 2004 accord. This was so easy to replace too. A 10 year old kid could do it. Quality part! Turned off my check engine code instantly.
B0091OE6K6|4|Helps hold seat belt away from neck
B000BUU5XG|5|Incredible product!  I wish I had bought this years ago.  We can leave the windows open while running the generator and no diesel fumes are detectable inside or outside the motor home (front generator Class A motor home.)  Thank you!
B000JL95TC|5|I like how they smell and they seem to keep the mosquitoes away.  If they only worked on flies ....
B000VB87XA|4|I'm very happy with this
B000A8JLIY|5|The Japanese car we scoot around in started idling rough and lost power. I recognized the syndrome. Time for a spark plug change. The car came with NGKs, and I'm happy to continue using them. Over the years I've seen many spark plug designs and features come and go. I passed up the split, forked or otherwise as well as the old fashioned copper core spark plugs.<br />Iridium seems to be the top plug. These were available with Prime shipping. I ordered and installed them.<br />Whenever I install new spark plugs I make it a habit to also change the spark plug wires. Sure, a little more money and time, but your are right there anyway. Pull off a cap, or scrape the wire, have corrosion on one of the connections and you're hiking down to the auto parts store.<br />Use anti-seize on the threads. This is a must.<br />Put a dollop of tune-up grease on the top of the spark plug and the connections of the spark plug wire.<br />Torque the spark plug to manufacturer's specifications. Do not over torque. Resist the urge. You do not want to twist the top off of the spark plug and have to extract the base.<br />When all was back together the idle was smooth, glass smooth, acceleration was back, the car was happy again.
B009214RWU|5|Love this bag. I just used it on a BMW R1150R for a 1200 mile bike ride from Michigan to Tennessee. It was perfect!
B00M90T8QG|4|A bit large though I placed mine on a Corolla Ceres (sporty), so there is &#34;relative size&#34; issue. Looks good though but depending on the viewing angle when lit, it appears to blur a bit and it is not clearly a Toyota sign. I did not use the adhesive tape to mount it as I fear that someone may try to rip it off and due to the thickness, it does provide a good hand grip for the would be thief. I actually cut the finisher at the back of my car and mounted it from the inside, that is within the finisher. So it barely protrudes from the surface and there is no grip for the &#34;thief&#34;. This way of mounting also gives a more &#34;factory finish&#34;, as if the car came with the badge instead of an after market stick on.<br />I connected to my park lights and it is very bright. I have observed drivers behind switching off their headlights for better viewing of the badge, as if they wanted to confirm the lighting of the badge and not that it may be a painted effect.<br /><br />Very satisfied so far.
B00JVAGI2E|5|Fast shipping. Everything is working great.
B000M298A4|1|came out of the box in pieces had to return
B00757KJTI|1|Nope can't pick up any stations at all zero thanks for nothing
B00AZXAZE8|5|I'm happy,, THE PROPLEM WAS ACTUALLY A BAD GROUND FROM THE PLUG TO THE CASING.
B00ISLZL98|5|I used these in a camper van and they are well made and bright.
B006WQSXSW|5|Great deal. Works Awesome . Quiet
B00PJVOKDS|5|Exactly what I wanted, looks great on my truck especially at night.
B00B2PZ8EA|5|Best you can buy
B00UZFPKBE|1|I bought this item, when I went on a road trip. I used it to charge phone. I had to charge it every night. now it won't charge at all.
B007GLCO3W|5|Use this all the time to protect my cars interior.
B0077RM6D8|4|No review it's just lock bars. I will say that we hear the wind through them
B0007G8X4W|5|I have the comp box on my 02 with 100hp injectors, 3rd gen htt 62/65 and a fass 150. It will get sideways on 35's from a standstill! Going to stack it with a smarty when I get the tranny built.
B000IYEMBQ|5|Great Product. Quality.<br /><br />Helpful hint. Make sure your bearing is not 180 degrees the wrong way. I installed it wrong and the ABS sensor wouldn't fit correctly. Had to uninstall and reinstall. All my fault hahaha  .
B001GC2LVM|4|Works pretty good, but found out it doesn't work well on concrete or aphalt. Leveler tends to slip out when backing up on hard surfaces.
B00FTB0AVY|5|As Advertised.
B004GDFE6M|5|worked out great.
B00069D55M|1|Now the description says they won't fit,  didn't state such when I ordered them.  Some dimensions would have helped.  At least return process was painless and easy.
B004AN3YD8|5|Quick and as advertised.
B0009IK5TO|3|It was a decent wiper, while it lasted.  I was disappointed in the longevity.  They needed to be replaced after 8 months because they would no longer clear the windshield without streaking, even after efforts to clean it.
B000C5GB1A|5|Good
B00G6ZMCQI|5|So great for camping and for kids because you can heat pancake syrups in these cups over the stovetop, etc.
B000A0CANA|5|Bought this on sale PLUS Fram had a rebate! The sale was 2/$20 for air filter and cabin air filter. Then got rebate checks for $2 and $3. I debated using a $0.50 stamp for them but I figured hey why not? They were just collecting dust in my wallet anyways.<br /><br />This was for a 2008 Toyota Matrix XR. I had just bought it and it didn't look like the filter had been changed since the car was manufactured, luckily it only had 45k miles. I bought this and some fuel cleaner, Lucas I believe, and the car runs perfect.<br /><br />By the way, Amazon doesn't always show a rebate, like this time, so just check Fram's website.
B00GBTGFDK|5|great idea. and works shooting pictures of fish when they come to boat.
B00EECLY64|5|They came on time and in one piece.
B00FAN89AU|1|Agree with the other reviewers, the hydraulic bottle on this jack is extremely poorly made; thus will leak sooner rather than later. Mine is only a year or so old, has NOT been abused, and leaks like a sieve around the piston seal (which means it won't hold pressure/raise the stands...). I am in process of contacting &#34;Shinn Funn&#34; or whoever makes these things and seeing if I can get a replacement bottle; will update. Do not recommend; there are better options even in this price range.  UPDATE: The Chinese got me on this one. NO replacements so it's useless. Good guys up there in the KC HQ; but they're saddled with sub-standard Chinese rubbish.
B001HATY36|4|Works easily and provides some level of theft protection. Thief's can overcome anything if they try hard enough and have enough tools, but this will give them some trouble for a while. For my low end TT, it works great.
B00AZ4QAY6|4|Fit on both back and front windows on my honda element the back windows won't open because of the shape of the visor but other then that they look nice when installed.
B00R0AXOWE|5|Bought for summer use have large windshield and it works great.  Temp down quite a bit in the car.  Will buy a spare for the price.
B00JJ66B9A|5|great product
B005C2OK3O|5|I get great compliments on this item. I have washed my car several times and its still in tact.
B0001MII88|5|The wife is the gardener in the family.  The previous hose gave up so I was directed to replace it.  The fact one can safely drink out of it is a plus.  This is a light durable hose which I consider to be a good value.
B007CEJ8FA|5|Easy to fit, everthing you need in the box. Tow well
B000C9PYVE|1|Doesn't look like pic. Oem looks like pic.
B005HSOUZQ|5|I have had this tool for about 7 years , we use it about twice a month and so far so good, I bought this as a back up.
B00YMHC9E2|5|fits the bill
B000C476BK|5|Good fit, works good.
B00YBAH6QQ|4|great lights. said white but they are blue
B00NE33ORQ|5|Very nice product very fast delivery
B00COOS5NY|5|These are the best high quality H.I.D kit you need. Look no more!! These look amazing in my wifes Honda Civic Si. Also have this kit for my RSX Type S. Very fast shipping as well!
B000GTW68E|5|Was happy with the shipping. It was exactly as shown in picture. Perfect fitment on my 98 zx6r.
B006G3ZML2|5|These were better then I thought covers all the boot thick and they look great.Thanks
B007WWROJO|5|looks like my other one that's 20 years old and still working, it doesn't market JEGS name anywhere or on the box but it has a lifetime warranty so im happy for the money.
B00SN7KX54|5|Works great!!  Very happy I can open my doors again.  Sure makes a difference when you have to go back to using the key to open your doors.
B00BCRMA9Y|2|The rear seat cover did not fit as it said it would. There were no seatbelt holes for the seatbelt to go through. The material feels cheap and tears very easy. I only gave it a 2 star because the front seat covers do look good. The color of red shown was not the color I received. I would spend the extra money to buy better quality seat covers.
B00JCFXKRY|4|Very nice
B00J3NW288|1|Don't buy this. I purchased and installed in VW van and it died after &#60;500 hours service. Norcold was very unhelpful, sending me from one service center to another and the final diagnosis was &#34;Buy a new one, this is dead.&#34;<br />No replace parts, nothing to do just pour more money to Norcold.
B00P2D3VZG|5|These are great bulbs.  Perfect white, not blue, and BRIGHT.  I put them in my license plate and all 4 dome lights in my trailblazer ss and they are awesome.  I've tried a LOT of other different types of led bulbs and these are brighter and made better.  Even the wire for the contacts is much heavier than the no name stuff here on amazon and ebay.  I have some other bulbs that are so loose that they fall out or just don't make contact to work without putting pressure on them but these are nice and snug.  They aren't going anywhere unless you force them.  These are now my go-to bulbs for sure.
B004A6OEM0|5|Working perfectly...fits like a glove...fast shipping, excellent value
B006TMMXSA|5|Perfect for my 2012 Mazda 6, a rock broke the original but this one was great but it makes the other one look so dull. Have to order the other side
B00429NKWK|5|Works fabulously, it only took me about an hour. I read a review where someone was using a squirt bottle to wet their lens, I highly recommend using a hose and just letting water run slowly over the light as you sand, the more water the better, also I was worried bc my light wasn't perfectly clear at the end of step 2 and it didn't mention a slight gaze like it did previously but as soon as you apply step 3 boom! Crystal clear
B001XLG5FE|3|Much smaller than expected, and doesn't really stay up in the windshield of my 2014 Honda civic si. You need a very small car for this to work out.
B00IRBPCF2|5|A great little gadget for all bicycle riders.  Sturdy and easy to carry
B005MEMF8O|5|Exelent product
B000CB3WZM|5|these worked well, easy to fit, for half the price.
B00D44PIW4|5|The part was exactly the one that I needed.  It arrived a day early, and I had it installed in 15 minutes.  It works like a champ.
B00OEC40Z6|5|Perfect! Looks fantastic on my car
B000UVUAFO|4|Haven't use it yet but looks interesting....let's see.
B001810SHA|5|Fantastic! The car's and air-conditioning has never been so cold. Easy and straightforward. It was enough for two cars.
B004I8BEHS|5|works and fits well
B00IT9SH7W|3|I LOVE these bags. However, they don't fit new sportsters as advertised. I have a 15' Sportster  48 and these do not fit without some extra work or modification. I ended up using heavy duty black zip ties to secure these bags to my sporty. Additionally they arent as sturdy as my left side Harley brand saddlebag but they don't have a frame to install like the Harley bag.  Damn they look good and are otherwise perfect. I'm giving 2 less stars for fitment and false advertising.
B00LX2D94I|5|Great for mowing grass after dark.
B008G35UB2|5|Perfect Fit, easy to install and very cost effective.
B00D2QL0DU|5|Pump works well to transfer fluids.
B00BG3GGTE|3|When you compare these to the original BMW equivalent you can't beat them. In terms of coloring is identical to the original BMW. Internally the design is identical except for the outer side on the original is matte while on this one is shinny no a deal breaker if anything it looks better.  A bonus is that is ready to use as the regular bottom bulbs are installed basically you remove the (4) bolts with a 8MM socket unplug connector and reverse and you are done and a heck of a savings.<br />What I did not like...  Mine came with a scuff mark that won't come out.  Also is not a perfect fit (see for yourself on my pictures) I have both the left driver side (this item) and the right passenger side original BMW see for yourself.<br />The bottom line... if you do not want to pay $300 plus for an original BMW taillight then this is your best option.<br /><br />Additional notes:  not sure if the item I got is defective or not but can't afford to wait to return it back to Amazon/Vendor and wait for a replacement
B003LUPH2M|5|White baby...!!!
B0119JIIGI|5|Love this helmet! More beautiful than it looks in the pics. Fits well, and is DOT compliant. Awesome helmet for the price.
B000FCRS0I|5|I've lost it,but I still like it
B007O4Q2QG|5|Fits my 2014 Buick Verano perfectly!!!
B000OAZHP4|3|its a good product but its not as loud as 4 in dose sound good tho!!!
B00JXA0PH6|5|These lights where by far the easiest HID bulbs ever installed. I have installed many HID systems on my two sons cars and my wife's also. I have never gotten a set to wor on my dodge trucks to work properly. This kit went on the first time with no flaws. Great product!
B00L2P1J3Y|5|Did a great job on a small scratch I had on my roof
B004ZVRGXO|4|Love it still working. Love how i open my car 97 accord and the blue led bulb appears. Not bright but it gets the job done.
B010BUBKHU|5|Didn't have no problems
B006OPJSCG|5|Great
B005PZMKZI|3|I'm not sure if the breakdown is with Amazon or the seller.The description says it will fit my model Yukon (2005 XL), but it doesn't. The back seat doesn't even come close. We ended up leaving off the back portion and rigging up a way to secure the seat.  The bucket covers don't take into account the arm rest or seat belts and there were no holes for the headrest. We were heading on a road trip so we managed to make accommodations.  They do look nice and the price is good even if we had to doctor it up to get them to fit.
B00NMQMKLG|3|i would like to have seller contact me.  the reverse light are a smaller size and will not fit.  The 2 interior bulb housing for the front seats are different from the rear seating area and are too big. thanks ORDER # 110-8332305-2660252
B012YMDPHG|5|This scanner is pretty straightforward and simple to hook up. There's such a variety of scanners out there, it can be overwhelming. This one is a great deal and works perfectly, it does everything it says it does.No need to keep running back and forth from Autozone or O'Riley's. Comes with code info but there are sites online that you can go to and get the error code info and possible solutions. I would recommend this product to every one.
B001AWLTX4|4|Good
B00EZ9Y33W|4|Just finished installing this switch for a 50 inch light bar placed on the front upper roll bars on a Teryx4 UTV. The switch worked as advertised. It feels lightweight but operates the light bar. The relay/fuse lead is approximately 10 inches and needs to be mounted close to the battery. That was somewhat inconvenient as it would have required drilling into the firewall which I won't do. I jimmy rigged it with wire ties. The switch lead needs to be wired to a power supply that turns on with the ignition. The LED indicators are always on (either red/off or green/on). Not a big problem but I'll have to wire them into a cigarette lighter plug. The price was right on this for what you get. If the switch eventually goes bad there are replacements. Having the wiring harness with fuse and relay hooked in is worth every penny. If you plan on using this for the tail end lights of a side by side, the wires may not reach. For atv's and front lights on a utv, the wires are long enough.
B00XK1N04Y|5|Small, but strong. Very happy with it
B00KGETCHW|5|Great quality. Nice soft flexible rubber, lays down and stays in place.
B001GH5PRE|3|It's nice but had to trim off the sides to fit
B0009IQXM2|5|No complaints. Does what it says.
B000CPJ4TQ|5|Very Nice
B00EQ26FPW|5|Good quality rehabs of oem
B007TK0TOQ|5|Haven't used yet but looks great and can't beat the deal
B005OV6MS4|5|very good quality
B0077HE8PM|5|I bought two for reasonable price, chahging is easy
B00HZOBCJW|1|I am quite disappointed with these mats. I've only had them for 5 months and they are scratched, hard to vacuum and already look very worn. They must be removed to be cleaned with a wet rag because dirt and sand won't vacuum off, as if debris &#34;sticks&#34; to it. Not a good investment.
B005A8ZBW4|4|its a good product for the money.
B00Y5EK1DS|3|This emblem is actually VERY SMALL  and somewhat not big enough to read from a distance- needs to be a little larger
B009KBUR2Q|5|Works great - get one
B002QYOT1Y|5|wonderful Father's day gift
B000QDHENM|5|Great Gas Can
B0038N1VD6|5|Fits, works, and there are not many choices anyway for the early Miata.  I was happy to find it and am back on the road.
B00S75G3BU|5|Looks great. Was about half the price of most other places and looks just as good as the one I bought for my 351. Can't say how well it works as I have more work to do to the engine but looks promising.
B000Q8U5N8|2|Very cheap chain and ring.The chain broke after 2 days.
B007VRCQE8|1|product rattled and vibrated super bad, removed and threw it away directly after installing.  this was a huge waste of money
B000CN7B5C|5|Awesome fitment on my 1977 nova i couldn't be happier with overall appeal and functionality.
B00TPUKM8Q|5|This is a thick, high quality seat cover that's elastic enough to fit over any bench seat. It's easy to clean and looks surprisingly sharp. It even folds very small for easy storage. This is a good cover that's easy to put on, take off, and care for. No complaints, five stars.
B000H3Q2FC|5|need the screws worked great thanks
B00E5OUOCQ|5|The new sunshade is just what we were hoping for.  My daughter is using it in her Honda Civic, and it fits well.  Thank you!
B00DHX86J4|5|Love this gremlin bell. Well made and went right on the Harley!
B00GSAUHB8|5|&#34;Works great. I love the &#34;overlap&#34; fabric on the edges that keep the entire front windshield covered!&#34;
B00080QHMM|1|It takes me awhile to write reviews on some things.  Especially when it's something that you've only picked up a couple of times, gotten frustrated with it, and it makes its way to the bottom of your tools.<br /><br />First of all, mine DID NOT come with any batteries.  And certainly not rechargeable ones.  I have actually been through 3 sets of batteries now (watch cell style, as it shows inside the battery compartment).  The thing keeps draining them.  I will use it once or twice, then a week later, use it again.  And boom - dead.<br /><br />Maybe I just got a dud.  Or a used one.  I don't know.  But mine was crap.
B00SW26D0Y|5|Just as pictured.  This is a cute plush and so cute being so small
B002P8H8V4|4|Didn't fit exactly.  I don't think it was made for a SC1.  For the price it was &#34;good enough&#34;.
B00FPL10WQ|1|I am appalled that Amazon still sells this.  I have gone through five of these as of today.  Every single one has failed.  I contacted Dorman and they are &#34;aware of a problem.&#34;  Yet, the Dorman representative when asked what he can do to rectify the situation, simply stops answering emails.  How's that for customer service.<br /><br />Luckily, my first four faulty products failed immediately (1-3 days) and were in the Amazon return period.  Now outside of that window, I am out 90-odd dollars (price was much higher when I bought the first one) and in no better place than I was when the OE failed.<br /><br />The only diagnostic information I have is that these products seem to fail in cold weather.  So if you live in the northeast, forget buying this.  This morning's &#34;cold snap&#34; of 60 degrees has now rendered another actuator useless.  The only actuator that lasted more than 3 days was installed right before summer.  I would be interested to see if the reviewers who gave 4+ stars all live in warm climates, or if their products are still functioning.<br /><br />With as many negative reviews as there are, I really cannot understand how this product is still on Amazon's marketplace.
B0041CDPQO|5|Good
B00DQCG4IQ|1|After 3 Weeks only one light works. The other one clicks 3 times. Doesn't last
B007HG7VWU|5|yup, this is it
B00D2HI32U|5|Keeps my guys out of harms way. This is a must have addition to your winch!
B00SSCHP1Y|5|Great product. Fast shipping with tracking number. Super fast and easy install- unplug stock taillights and plug in Anzos! Smoke tail light looks great with grey metallic paint.
B000QV0FIA|1|Cap does not fit 2004 ford f150 although amazon states that it does..nice cap if it fit though
B00KWQRC4O|5|The Deluxe Car Garbage Bag is great for people who get frustrated trying to keep their vehicle clean and organized! It attaches easily to the back of the seat, collapses when empty, is easy for all ages to utilize and even has places for a water bottle and tissues! It comes to mind as especially handy for those long trips when luggage, meals on the road, and lots of leftover cups and paper seem to take over the car. Children can easily reach this item from their belted in seats. If you do not need it for a garbage bag, consider using it to store the childrens' markers, drawing books and small toys! You cannot go wrong with this item.
B00NBDG6QU|5|I ordered this sticker to replace an old one. Beautiful sticker, must be very careful when placing sticker!
B0031GUUU0|5|Took care of the blinker (or non-blinking) issue I had in my wife's car: 2002 Chrysler Concorde LX.<br /><br />Located under dash, between brake pedal and emergency brake pedal.  Removed the wire connector, and zip tied this new ELM470 into the wire connector, than zip tied the assembly up under the dash.
B000RDG7PW|5|I ordered this and the 23345 to replace the catalytic converters on our 98 F-150.  The passenger side catalytics were worn out and throwing check engine lights, so I replaced both sides at the same time.  Great fit up, exact match to the factory pipes and manifolds.  No more check engine light.  Much better performance and fuel economy than the original factory exhaust, which was probably well past its useful life.  Overall it was a half-day project to replace the entire front pipe and catalytic section; no welding, and cost less than having the cats replaced at a local shop.<br /><br />Quick tip:  Spray all the exhaust bolts down with PB Blaster the night before to make for easy removal without breaking any studs (or knuckles).
B00CUEI786|5|Makes everybody laugh who sees it!
B00OM0H5ES|5|Rear guards are a little tough to position and install but heavy aluminum and precision machining
B00TS9J1AO|5|Great sticker 😉 especially if you live that lifestyle
B001G3Q43M|5|Original part, fitted perfectly.  Now I have my AC Blower working at a normal speed
B008RIEQXY|5|Used these on my steel plate bumper for tag lights worked perfectly
B00A6GGZ9S|3|wore out very quickly. will buy OEM parts for now on
B00EVMT6A8|2|not clear
B007FGR852|1|Crappiest piece ever. Its mounted on a thin piece of metal that cant support the weight. The head light just flopps around
B00029CYRG|5|I used the Meguiar's M6732  followed by M6332. The results were spectacular on my older Truck Camper. It removed all the old wax and oxidization and restored it to a beautiful new shine. The wax enhanced and protected it and made it shine even more. A lot of work, but I used my husband's sander with the orange compounding pad and it made it easier . My camper looks like it came right off the showroom floor. Amazing stuff !!!! Highly recommend !
B00AF67MSC|1|Did not come with anything to attach the lights to my car. Also the directions were so illiterate, it was just sad. Don't waste your time or money on this.
B00GIPCX3I|5|Quick delivery!! Great product!!
B00I15STK4|4|Exactly as described.
B006N0TIQS|4|I like the look but the bulb holder wouldn't plug into my 2003 jaguar x type. Had to use the stock bulb holder and the o ring from the New bulb holder in order to get it to work.
B010VUZGFC|5|Very impressed, these are as good, if not better than the ones I had from Costco...excellent diamond pattern, nice and plush. When I saw these and realized how good they were, I bought two more for the back seats.
B002I0GYZU|5|My Chevy pickup came with these from the factory. At 50K miles the idle seemed a little rough. Ok, time for a spark plug change. There are many choices out there but this is what my mechanic recommended. Normally I would change spark plugs myself but these new engines pack so many electronic features and computer modules that I let the professionals do the changing.<br />I also change the spark plug wires. In this case, one wire had rubbed against a metal shroud and had a rent on one side.<br />The end result is what I wanted. A smooth idle, acceleration returned, and a professional did the whole thing in a couple of hours.
B00MGI60RQ|5|They work
B00U81ZJQ6|5|Worked perfectly..installed in less than two minutes
B004OIMMYG|5|Fast shipping, product worked great!
B0070Y36WI|1|They said that they fit my car and when I went to put hem in they were way too small
B00ED8SYM6|5|Genuine Mishimoto 4&#34; stainless steel tension clamps.  I bought these to put in place of regular clams on my cold air intake but found out the hard way that I should of bought the 5&#34; instead a long with a 6&#34; or two because the boots are thicker even though the tube itself is 4&#34;!
B00JG3OHVK|5|Rain was coming in my convertible top I was going to replace and now i'm not
B00AQ29GA2|5|Looks great
B00DBEM7HG|1|forget about this one
B00SDQPQPM|5|Awesome!!!!
B000WJEY8S|4|Working just fine and seems waterproof just like it said.
B007BXCNEU|4|High end oil filter..... good for 10,000 miles..... worth the extra cost
B00PBDT3B8|5|Takes some time to install, but works great.  Much better than the old steering cable system.<br />I have it on my 150 Evinrude Etec and I don't have any issues.
B00H2WXYM0|5|Beautiful. My car is a sporty number and I wanted to add a feminine touch and this did it.
B00130L5AA|5|Excellent price!  Arrived on time and no dents or damage
B000N3W8J0|5|sure seems to cut down on marring at least based on what's left in the buckets 1, 2, and 3 when I'm done
B009S9RRQ4|3|The sticker was larger than I had thought. It takes up a good amount of the rear window of a Honda CRV; but was easy to apply and readily visible. The biggest problem my husband and I had with it, though, was that it seemed to really piss people off - to the point  of more than a couple instances of road rage and nasty parking lot commentary. I guess the rubes that live here in our adopted state of NH take their stick figure families very seriously, and have no sense of humor what-so-ever. Saw tons of these on a recent trip to NY via MA, where people obviously have brains and can appreciate a joke. We (sadly) removed it, as the car is brand new.
B00APN8V44|5|Complete, simple, cheaper then replacing one air bag
B000Y87R4K|4|I like it. Very nice look.
B00GE9Y5IE|5|Fit perfect.  Excellent engineering.  Looks like they arrived from the factory already installed.  They installed at ease with no tire removal.  Only slight issue with extremely tight fit installing rear flaps.  However, I have larger than stock tires so I can't complain too much.  Would buy again.
B004W0QJ2C|1|These are very poor quality. I also choosed an aweful, Sunflower Gold color. They look like sponges stuck to my door!!!<br />Actually, I should have just used 2 sponges and velcro, and stuck them on my lower arm rest.<br /> These are not dense at all, and if I lean on them, I can feel my arm, sink right through the Suburbans door lower arm rest.<br />And to top it off, I bought 2 sets!!
B000CQHVLI|5|I used this product to patch 8 holes in the exhaust pipe before the catalytic converter. I also used it and a clamp to seal up a gap in the flanges between the catalytic converter and muffler, this was on a 13 year old exhaust system. It works better if you pre-harden it - I used a propane torch - otherwise the exhaust pressure makes it bubble up. So no problems after 1000 miles, it passed state inspection and the vehicle is very quiet now.
B00OCYXTYY|3|My rating will go up when OBD Solutions fixes the WiFi disconnect issue -- they say a firmware update is in the works (as of 12-Aug-2015), but ETA unknown.  Apart from that annoying issue, it works great, the bundled free iOS app has a lot of functionality, and it works great with TrackAddict which also has a free version available.<br /><br />Biggest downside compared to the PLX Devices Kiwi 2 WiFi is that the OBDLink MX WiFi does not have the ability to accept other non-OBD sensors to display/log on iPhone.  The PLX unit does with an optional add-on so you can have upto 16 external sensors!  No other OBD WiFi tool has that feature!
B003ENG3M4|5|Delivery was much faster than expected, which was good! Installed in 45 minutes taking my time. Used a foot stool to make things easier, also invested in a t-40 Torx socket from Lowes. $5 or so. The instructions say you need a hex wrench- but I didn't need it. The parts are solid, genuine Honda. DO tighten the nuts down to get the paint off the posts- makes the last part of the install painless. Also the tabs on the covers over the posts on the CRV are on the upper side (towards the middle of the vehicle) and the tabs on the rear covers are on the rear of the cover(towards the back of the vehicle). They are easy to get off without scraping up the rails once you find the slots. The bars changed the look of the CRV for the better in my opinion and they do not impede mileage or add to the road noise.
B006OH5ZCQ|5|I've used the more expensive ADCO cover and after six months it ripped everywhere. Thought I would try this one and at $100....I couldn't resist!  It's a basic cover with no perks, so if you use your RV a lot or need to access your RV, this might not be the cover for you. We only use our RV once or twice a year. We live in SoCal and needed something to keep out the elements especially the sun beating down on our rubber roof. We own a 2013 Coachmen Freelander 19CB (19ft.....21ft with the cab). Everyone kept saying how big this cover was and to order a smaller size....I ordered the 18ft-20ft. It fit my RV like a glove. The material seems to be a bit thicker then ADCO. I will update after a few months of use, to see if any rips appear, but so far so good!
B005VKAZRM|5|Just like what GM installed on the factory line.  Perfect fit, and it included a costly headlight bulb.  VERY satisfied!
B007HRYHDA|1|Have used for about 6 months and the lens is already cracked about halfway across. Very cheap product.
B002YCE5V2|5|Works perfect in 2000 silverado 1500! Took me less than 5 minutes to install. Fixed my &#34;service 4WD&#34; error code. Great product for the price!
B001AM3IXI|5|Excellent shock.  I anticipate this shock will last a long time.
B006T2L4YE|4|It did what I needed it to do. However I wish they came in a pack of four or more.
B006V35U82|4|As promised...
B00DSS9O5S|5|worked great. very happy.
B00LR0KZI4|4|The fit is on the mark and for the price it is worth it
B001MSDCSG|5|Great cover. Fit 98 seadoo gs perfect.
B005FI5BBA|5|I bought it two years ago and it still loos great!
B005VNSLI4|5|The right replacement part
B0076PKA34|4|I replaced my stock fog lights on my Mercedes-Benz 97 E420 they came fast looked good worked for about 2 weeks one went out week later the chrome started coming off I was going to HID them but one of the adjuster must have came off when driving so I still have the chrome part on my car just not the part to put the bulb in is gone looks like a hole because it is now I mean i liked them but for the price no when I got them it cost 76$ plus an  I can't send them back because I waited to long for the return I did put them on myself so It could be my fault but that's a maybe? But that's why I'm trying one more time to be sure
B000BRQ0TW|5|I LOVE this stuff.  I ordered a brand new steel stock tank.  When the tank arrived, I discovered it was leaking from one end.  I applied J-B WaterWeld to the interior of the leaky tank, underwater!! The next day the epoxy was hard-cured (underwater still!)  and the leak was fixed.  This stuff is pure magic and saved me from having to return a big, heavy and expensive item.  Definitely recommend.
B00RCEISQK|4|Good quality, but the image of this product os black, and it was send me navy
B00390X5AU|4|Exact replacement for the one I lost from extended fender flares on a YJ.
B005NXMFW0|5|Great
B00IKPFI0Y|5|Installed and works great!
B00HR5RYNW|5|Perfect. I now have 4 cupholders in the front. It has a space for this but did not come with a second one when the vehicle was purchased. Very Happy
B00HRY7550|4|fit fine, worked fine.  Pleased
B00H554R98|4|Great products
B00S5P0DVI|4|Work good but I had to upgrade it little bit myself.
B005J43I56|5|Works perfectly with 2015 FZ-09
B00192JGDU|5|super study. clever design. the grill platform can be a bit slick so I had to apply duct tape to create friction.
B00JIIZCM6|5|Love it!!! My sofa looks GREAT!!!
B000KL3E84|5|Make sure you check your make and model and YEAR for your car when ordering. I had the wrong year down by two years and it was definitely off.  Now, having ordered the right year, duh,  it fits like a dream!  I love the look.  Perfect for winter or summer.  If you are a person that lives in the snow area then you know that you usually have to change mats to accomiate the puddle of water from the melting snow from your feet.  These mats are like a bucket!  I simply love how neat the they look. They pick out very easy to sake dirt off.  Just love them!
B0058J4O7S|4|Tail lights were a perfect fit.  The screws that came with it were put in so far that I could not get them out without damaging them.  Whoever put them in should send them in a baggy with the lights not in them already.
B00CIJY5L6|5|These are excellent gaskets. I used this one on a 1969 Chevy 350 rebuild. I use Moroso products whenever I can! They've been in the racing/hotrod business since the beginning. They use only the best materials. Fit and function are second to none!
B001GN1GLM|4|works great on our motorhome
B00B92RU9W|5|LOVE IT
B002BG58TE|5|Very nice mat. Looks good and is sturdy.
B000GTUM9O|3|Not bad but a tad bit small
B0065739VY|1|Not as advertised, wrong size and quantity was not as stated.
B0006VORDY|4|The stove worked great and was solid as can be asked for. Only wish it was a little taller.
B0006H8BDU|5|Nice replacement for stock that won't kill your wallet
B001MOSBRW|1|Bought this for my 98 Altima drivers side door. This was a very cheap product. It's as simple as plugging it in to install. The door lock button then decided to roll all of my windows down in the dead of winter before it completely fried (within minutes). Was forced to buy from a dealership where it was $100. Do not even try it guys. Words of wisdom
B003SRQT9S|4|I love the seat covers. They match my little red car perfectly. They did take a bit of time to put on to make sure they were nice and snug. Unfortunately, I decided not to use the headrest covers since they are all too big for each one of my headrests. I know they're universal but there's no way to get rid of the look of excess material, so I just left my headrests uncovered. That's the only reason for one less star. I'm still very happy with the way they look, with my plain black headrests. Thanks FH Group for a really great and inexpensive product! I'm constantly getting compliments on them! (:
B005JU5XE4|5|awesome wiper blades!
B009XOX3OO|5|Great product
B007NGB3I2|1|This runs extremely small I ordered two sizes bigger than I wear and it was like I tried on an xs.
B001AX8AWQ|5|Great Product and great service..
B0055PD1H4|5|Great as advertised.
B008Y2DRXS|4|Works great if you treat it like a piece of flimsy plastic which is what it is.  Mine went for most of 2 years before I bumped it from the side.  Now I am ordering a second.
B003RCFFTE|5|The plate beat my expectations.
B00CPYC9BC|5|I was a little apprehensive because we had priced a custom made hose extension from a local propane dealer at more than twice the price.  The hose was delivered quickly and the quality is good.  I have used it several times.  The quick release fittings are a little difficult to install on our grill but that is because of the awkwardness of positioning.  Hooking it to the trailer end is no problem at all.  Very pleased and would recommend it to anyone.
B00HEABWH4|4|would recommend this product. It saved me alot of money and worked well on my truck.
B0062EI33O|4|Fits pretty well good for price. No problems yet and DID NOT remove intake manifold to install! Just be careful and use wd40 if it gets stuck a little.
B00MLKY9AO|3|Any review I post would be unfair. Not as advertised because the box said biohazard but the helmet had no graphics. Great helmet but I paid extra for the graphics and did not get it
B00470JPDW|5|Operates as designed
B000GRY6KM|5|Worked out great
B00B1VBQRS|5|I can tell you this much about fuel injection service that you get from a mechanic. Royal Purple works just as good and its just as effective, I should know I was a mechanic. Just do this, change out your air filter once a year and if your car has a fuel filter chance bat once every two years and you are guarrented not to have any fuels consumption issues. the service that is provided at you mechanic is the samething as this judt costs much less.
B001DRNNEO|5|Great fit and quality for my VW!
B0085KGOH0|5|This is an excellent product.  It does what it is supposed to do.  The only thing I have to say negative is do now fill it all the way up as it is too heavy to handle.  If I ever buy another one it will have four wheels.
B000B61TPS|5|quality is good and dimension are exactly as posted.<br />fit perfectly in compartment door opening of my travel trailer.
B00BKXDXR8|5|A quality product that is reasonably priced and shipped quickly.
B001BDJ2ZE|5|Great product fits and looks great.
B004EIAADG|5|This smart battery charger is exactly the description said it is it started a battery that had been sitting for a year and a half in seconds! I am ecstatic😍 that I discovered is fantastic technology I purchase one for a relatives and will make more purchases in the future
B00OAOANYK|1|Be aware. Gives error code on 2010 VW Golf
B00UW4DNEO|5|Worked well, however, there needs to be some charge in the batteries that you are jump starting. otherwise the drain from the poor battery sucks to much power from this unit. Started boats and one car thus far.
B006H34AE6|3|Works well but the bristles started breaking off after only two months of use.
B00YIMUYOS|1|Does not fit my 97 Valkrie too thick tried in each caliper with fluid cover open and completely  open also no wear groves?
B00BLZB1BK|5|They look very good, as good as any I have ever seen, seems to work fine, very cheap price
B00DRHLWQ4|4|Spoiler color matched great. Comes with adhesive but self applied. Great over all
B00YHY10XQ|3|I really like how bright the LED's are and that one bar can do everything at the same time (running, stop, left and right blinkers). I drilled holes for the wires and installed on the trailer. Then I noticed a crack in the middle of the light - did not think much of it and considered it a defect or shipping damage. I requested a replacement and received it promptly. I did a closer inspection of replacement light and noticed that the light bar has a concave shape to it (the ends of light stick up). So when you install and tighten the bolts at the ends, the middle of the light raises up and cracks the light. That is what must of happened to the first light. In addition, the spot where the wires come out is different between the lights so I had to drill another hole for the wires. I do not have time to ask for a third light and decided to just live with it by adding a rubber bushing (or 2-3 washers) on each end between the light and trailer so when you tighten the bolts it does not flatten the light and crack it. I wanted a flush installation but have to live with the banana gap look I guess.... I'd give it 5 stars if it was not for the build quality issue (maybe it is just the batch I ran into). No comments on durability yet.
B00NPIUFMM|1|Only one unit tested.  It did not light up.  Might have just been a lemon.  Seemed to be well made so willing to reorder
B004A6JA5Q|4|I am a manufacturing engineer, use it to protect my clothing when I go out in the shop.
B000IYSI66|5|Bought this for the wifes 03 altima. Perfect fit and the unit was vacuumed sealed so I knew it would not leak. Cheaper than any parts store and works great. Remember to vacuum your AC system to remove any moisture and air before you refill the system with Freon.
B002QGVW3K|5|arrived as promised , actually arrived sooner then expected
B000PWY8PG|1|This thing never worked well for me. Followed setup instructions, which are terrible, oiled with tube provided. Hooked up to more than adequate shop air and it never had enough power to fully collapse any of the provided rivets. Additionally, it doesn't fit into it's own case with an air fitting screwed into it. Needless to say, now it's lost.
B000JUXGAC|1|Worked great when I first installed it on my boat engine but it quit working after 15 running hours. Fortunately it quit when I was running the engine in the driveway to flush the cooling system. Glad I wasn't miles out on the water. I installed the original points and condenser I saved for a back-up and everything is working fine. If you buy this, keep your original parts and make sure you have tools with you to replace the PerTronix Igniter if it quits working.
B00AZOHPOK|5|Works great, great price
B00EC0YL2C|5|fit very good thank you.
B00480J4JG|5|exactly as described
B000CSW7K6|5|Works  great. Fixed problem
B00F685J2U|5|Good Quality
B00CZ8Y45M|5|Dope
B000CB6D0S|5|exactly as described!
B00832OKF8|5|Fit exactly as expected and easy to install.
B0073J97K0|5|This was a perfect part started my motorcycle right the first time. excellent by, I should have got two of them at that time, hopefully the next time I need one it will be there and that affordable. praise the Lord
B00CXAOS5I|5|Easy install (getting my old cat out wasn't though!!!).  Works as expected... It's a freaking pipe, so how could you go wrong? I noticed a subtle increase in the sound of the exhaust at startup, but I don't notice much while driving. Sounds pretty much stock on my car, which has stock exhaust components everywhere else in the exhaust system.  Can't beat the price. It's quite beefy too, and thankfully it comes with hardware and gaskets.
B00AO6FJGU|4|Good helmets. However the clip on strap springs fail easily. Also they cannot be threaded to the seat hooks. Comfortable. Have ridden from St.Louis to Dallas wearing these. However there is high wind noise which can be fixed by a $3 earplugs from auto zone. Looks good. I am using this right now.
B003CLK6OO|5|Fit extremely well, easy to install.
B00OFRUUPE|5|Very nice, but a bit more bulky than i expected.
B00QJWUPC6|3|Mine driver side headlight just went out on me a month after installing. They were great till then. Not impressed
B009DJM6JM|5|Nice OEM style tail light. Gave to father in law and even he could put it in!
B00IKMC6M0|4|working great!! but little noise
B0041FCNU0|5|Just what I needed.
B00MAG6RMM|5|Higher quality and noticeably brighter than generic T10 bulbs I've used in the past. Pure white light, no blue tint to these...I would call the color 5k white. Installed these a few weeks ago and expect durability to be good. Will order these again because the higher quality and better output are worth the extra cost vs. the cheaper ones out there. Will update the review if there are any issues down the road.
B00LNNR9GG|1|bad product
B00NX5PWWU|5|I love it
B00MOYJ0YW|5|Works great!  Like the white light.
B0006JLW84|5|Worked well, has only been on for a month and has done what you would hope.  Install was straight forward, I would have been happier with a metal one but that isn't what I went with as I need the light this one provides.
B000UVUAFO|3|i do not know how to describe... but it still can see
B00RCEIUSG|5|Bought for wife's new fiat.  she loves them .  That's all i wanted.
B00FAQO5LO|5|Great company and great product.  Worked perfectly and just as advertised.
B001DBVPY0|5|Perfect fit!  I had read where someone had an issue with the bolt holes on the heat shield not lining up with the holes from the old filter box.  I found that if you don't tighten the bolts on the heat shield until you have it bolted down to the body, that it makes the line up a lot easier.  I noticed almost an instant performance increase.  Sound is very noticeable when stomp on it.  I noticed a difference when pulling my 3000lb camper.
B008JG1HHW|5|Perfect
B00DDZIU4C|5|Smells so refreshing, definitely the best price. Can't beat it. Thank you =]
B00GSAUHB8|4|It works very well.
B0006IX87S|3|a lot of charcoal comes out
B00KH84KFQ|5|Works as expected for a 2010 Escape.  Just got the key cut for cheap and programmed it myself following owners manual instructions.  So much better than paying dealer prices for this service.
B000GHZMTQ|2|Not useful and hard to use. I purchased it to use on a Saturn Ion, rear drum brakes, and really didn't use it, I tried, but it was not the work<br />saver I had hoped.
B006WQ9SYU|5|A little thicker than I thought it would be, but then I realized that the thickness is what gives it the quality and the durability it needs.  Looks really nice on the car. It covered up some deep scratches I had from accidentally hitting things on their way into the trunk. I recommend patching up the deep scratches with a touch up paint kit first to avoid any corrosion under this installation.  I am certain things will be so much better now with this on the bumper.
B000C9EN1G|5|Came in Ac Delco box, it was an exact fix. No issues with install. Great price on a quality product
B00D329B8Y|5|Works well, a little small for front seats of Honda Accord.
B00LOO380K|5|Excellent!!
B002R12LEI|5|Great product, perfect fit, best price, quick delivery. I highly recommend this seller. Thanks for the great experience.
B00C5SW0VC|5|Works Great
B000CO86BY|4|Does what its suppose to do
B00E1SOKUI|5|Fast shipping, perfectly fit my 04 dodge ram 1500.<br />Great product for the money.
B001U04NCA|5|happy
B00U85SHT8|5|Nice quality product.
B002EO69RS|5|This is a cool decal.  Ended up using it on the back of my son's tball helmet.  He loves him some transformers.
B004QQ8SEY|5|It works as expected.
B008S1QTWQ|4|Looks great it's just a little hard to install with all the curves and points but still looks great
B00JH1R2LS|3|This would be an amazing product if the design was rethought. You truly only need the neoprene on the top panel of the armrest cover. Then the sides that wrap around the armrest and underneath the edges to hold it in place should just be a thin stretchy protective fabric. Then you would not have the bulk of the neoprene all the way the armrest with creates bunching on the sides and bottom of the armrest lid.<br /><br />The cover does fit not perfectly. Also, once you get this installed, please know your armrest will not lock closed due to the bulky neoprene. I would suggest looking at other cover options that are not neoprene all the way around. When installed, it does not look like the picture shown in the product photo. If your wanting that look after installation, look at a cover that is not bulky neoprene. I am only keeping this because it does offer waterproof protection from my dog's feet. He loves to stand on the armrest from the back seat when in the car.
B000LW1TRU|5|I actually bought this Face Mask as part of a costume.  I have a large head, and this one did not fit, but I went to ZANHeadgear and found the same thing in extra large.  It fits great.  I tried to return this one, and they promptly gave me a refund but did not actually take the regular size one back.  Great product and exceptional service!!
B000OO4LUW|5|great! no problems at all. met all expectations.
B00WJQOTCI|4|Fit was... ok. the supplied clips didn't want to stay pressed in to their spots.
B007REFW32|5|Very cute! Great size!
B000C5DE1K|5|Nice well made strong complete.  I found that I needed auto brake adjuster kit as well, bought locally.  Good deal and necessary on my 21 yr old truck.
B007K9331W|1|This scopes works alright, but if you ever need any replacement parts they are not available. OTC has the worst customer service anywhere! You will be transferred from agent to agent with the end result being nothing but frustration. Under no circumstances would I buy another product from OTC again.
B0010DPCKY|5|Fit perfect and was well made in the USA :)
B009CXLYA6|3|Could stick a little better , clean real good first , which I did
B0049MICU0|5|It works! My aging A/C is back to blowing ice cold air. Thanks!
B0027QWNDM|3|Wasn't blown away by the product
B0049MH07G|5|Look at the picture so you will know what you are going to get.  This is a tail light harness.  There is no break out or additional wires for the side lights.  The ground wire does not have a terminal on it.  This is a good harness at a good price.  What else are you going to need?
B002OMLBUK|5|Love it. Got here quick too. Big bars are a must for wheelies!!!
B006RYSBAY|2|Fell off right away
B000OGIP7K|5|Perfect, as always with Cometic.
B001KS0M5O|5|Perfect replacement for rear wiper of my 2010 Ford Escape. Only issue now is the wiper arm action is kind of weak, but that's an entirely different issue and not cause of the new wiper. Highly recommend.
B0007OWD2M|5|This stuff works great, no residue!
B003E2WQE4|3|This product arrived on time and was in good condition. Once I got it assembled it seems to be decent quality for the price.<br /><br /> BUT..........it would have been really nice if htere were some assembly instructions included. I was just glad that I have some mechanical ability as I was forced to just look at the picture on the product web site to figure out which parts went where. Hopefully this is not the norm with this product. I just hope I assembled it correctly and the thing doesn't fall apart the first time I use it.<br /><br />Not sure if I would put a 500 lb motorcycle on it for more than an across town trip, but it should be fine for the scooter I plan on transporting.
B00HJZGWEW|5|This is nice, wanted to add something to the back of the truck.  Well made and a quality piece.
B00W0XCLVQ|5|Work and fit perfectly on my 2014 wrangler unlimited sahara!
B004BNV8B2|5|Very cool.  Wife loves it on the back of her car.  Well made, quality piece.
B0000AYFTV|5|Worked perfect to rewire my cargo trailer.
B009XOX3OO|5|A+++++++@@
B00XULVDHK|5|Stuck these on my back windows to keep the sun off the little one, and it works wonderfully! It has not fallen down at all since I've put them up, and it's been a month now! They do a great job of &#34;hiding&#34; everything inside, when you're on the outside looking in, while still allowing you to see everything from the inside out!
B004FOM86Q|5|Awesome .. Worked great and looks great on the Harley
B006C1NTEU|1|junk
B0000UUU50|5|My son installed my running boards easily and they look great.  They are sturdy to help me get into my van.
B00PV37ZEA|4|It is a nice size and good quality. I like that it sits flat against the back of the seat when it's not in use. It has vencro on it that keeps it from flopping open.
B007KPX7HQ|5|I've used this product for years. This is probably my 3rd or 4th can. It lasts a long time and is great for a quick polish. It tears through bugs pretty easy and shines well on paint or chrome.
B00AWE0FPE|5|Great price, work great couldn't be happier and like the fact it came with the pegs
B000COCU8O|5|Works Perfect
B001VJZOBO|2|Not accurate enough for my garage setup.  I need to keep the car close to the garage door.  I found that the variance was too big and almost closed the door on the bumper.
B00DQXOEG4|5|Packaged well, exactly like my OEM ones. Excellent quality.
B00N509LP2|5|Haven't needed to use it yet (thankfully) but gives me piece of mind that I will be safe in a time of vehicle emergency. Small and compact, everything is easy to differentiate
B009LZUJRY|5|Works Perfect
B00FKE3JMW|4|Went well tks
B002GOST3S|5|oh yeah
B007XE5LTG|5|With this I found out what else was going wrong with my van. I now know that I need to replace my catalytic converter, and going to put in a new muffler as well. If you get the codes and are a little confused, they can be looked up on the Autel site.
B00T9LR9FA|4|Works grea . Gotta buff it to reduce the haze it leaves and it won't be perfect. Tried it in my car and might as well deal with fogging windows since that haziness it just as irritating.
B001DKLYH4|5|Great for repainting my wicker chairs.
B004MYDO80|5|Delivered as promised, excellent .., all as promised, .price. quality and deliver.
B001PLSU5K|5|Perfect for my Ham Radio Portable Solar Power Generator. Handles easy 20 Amp.
B00ODD3NK4|4|husband likes them
B00YDORJXK|5|Used these the day they arrived and the money I made on that one job paid for the set.  These four carburetor jet adjustment tools fit many different brands of carburetors.  Makes small engine carburetor tuning so much easier.  Great tools.
B00B9O3AH6|5|fit and finish great .would buy these again
B001C6NL52|5|I love these well made,  they are tall need a deep draw
B00JIJ4LWW|5|Excellent product and customer service. Thank you! :)
B000R308RA|5|My husband loves it! Its awesome!
B003YHFI5S|5|Excellent fit and look amazing. Helps to take the grill off which is only 4 screws. Incredibly easy to adjust the bulbs
B00H9S71LW|5|Works great and very easy to set up. After a few months one little button broke and the customer service was amazing. Got my replacement device before I even sent the old one in. I use it with Torque and Harry's laptimer.
B00WISY2VK|5|perfect fit & function for the original one that broke after 9 years
B0009IK6F2|5|no problem...
B00S7CNWTY|5|They feel great and came to my house super fast thanks :)
B00063X7KG|5|works great but they are not very aggressive if that's what you're looking for.
B0015YDAZW|4|they fit good at first, then  over time they shrink very tight,  will buy a size larger size next time
B0083IYCN2|3|Bought as a gift
B0046IQD6C|5|Very heavy duty and solved my turning problem. A must for short bed truck with a wide front trailer.
B00DQVXG2O|5|It was exactly what was described.  I am so happy with it. It looks great as the center piece on the back window of my car.
B005VJFPUK|5|hit a critter great replacement parts
B00UJC65KI|1|Even though the search said these bulbs would fit a 2002 Dodge Grand Caravan Sport, they do not.. The opening in the casing is about 1/16 of an inch too small.  I plan to return.  These fog/driving lights came on the vehicle from the factory.
B00065L2D8|5|Perfect length
B00JVEGRNK|3|Haven't installed yet, but looks kind of cheap.
B00OR1BQ6A|5|Arrived on time, was very easy to install overall sturdy product.
B000IYN8NO|5|This was identical to the one I removed from my 93 Buick Century. Fit perfectly in the tank except for one issue. The rubber seal included in the kit did not compress enough to install the hold down for the pump. Installed the used one and it worked fine. It has been working fine for over a month. Way cheaper than up town....
B0022ZPF5G|5|I used this to remove the impellers on my 1998 seadoo speedster.  The product I used was not like the one in this picture, it was like a bolt with splines on it.  It worked well and there were no problems.  You'll need a vice to hold the shaft steady while you unscrew the impeller.
B004M6RUEW|5|This pre filter came on time and is of good quality.
B008JQ1AN8|5|Ok,fit perfectly
B00ARJQZ7G|5|This was exactly what I needed to fix my 2004 Subaru forester, it had a fault code of running to lean P0171
B004UGR2BU|5|As Advertised.
B00BVL7M26|4|This wire stripper works great.  Not the most sturdy built stripper but it is very easy to use.  Too bad they did not make this stripper out of metal like the 4466 model but it works better than the 4466.  It feels a little cheap being made out of all plastic but does not damage the wire insulation at all
B00FC7S5QW|1|Not built well.  Won't work well with stock turn signals.  Don't make the mistake I made, buy another brand.
B0089DNXR2|3|a
B000BMWXZM|5|Good
B001O0XE1M|5|Good items!
B010156HN2|5|Exactly what my husband wanted. Easy to install and fast delivery.
B002G1PBHI|4|works good for me
B002EO69RS|5|Great as advertised.
B002ZTPMXO|4|This is a direct fit replacement cable. Installing requires removal or unbolting the parking break. The rubber seal is not the proper size. Do your research about installing and watch a YouTube video.
B001C6IVYI|1|Bad aftermarket part !!! That's why is so cheap!!! Buy genuine part only. After one week this part will go bad  . Don't waste your money
B007ZDDUCK|5|Awesome product.  This is the best leather treatment I have used.  It smells good and it is very easy to apply.  Other treatments are pasty and dont work well with vented seats.  This is more a liquid form and does not have a problem with porous seats
B00JAJTW38|5|I like it
B005NLQAHS|5|Plugged it in and it worked with the Torque app very well. Exactly what I wanted.
B002M72K98|5|Ok
B007ZOEGT0|4|Good replacement for a cracked radiator in my 1988 MR2.<br />Only things to note are the threads on the temp sensor port are a little bit looser than on the stock rad, so put some thermostat housing RTV on the sensor's threads before installing. Also, the upper bleeder is not designed to allow you to leave open and let the coolant level come up the clear tube as the coolant leaks out around the plastic fitting while open, but bleeding was still possible. (MR2 owners will know what I mean. Disregard for front engine cars.)
B00KTHJDA2|5|Arrived quickly and went in like a dream.
B005GLP19S|4|No user manual ever covers repair of the automatic transmission.  This manual is the same.  It was published in the UK and is about the same information found in the Peter Russek manuals which cost a lot more.  I found it quite useful for repairing my brakes,  No sure what the other reviewer was looking at, but all the illustrations seem to match my 2004 Sprinter.
B001QKVGBU|4|Does the job.
B00Y2EMTFO|5|Really incredible quality in this clever little garbage can. Good heft, great build. The clasp is reliable as is the spring, and it will fit about a pack's worth of butts before you need to empty it. Bought this for Burning Man (where they're very big on not leaving any trace) and have been recommending it to everyone as the ultimate in not-being-a-jerk-who-litters.
B002TRZ74G|4|does the job
B00192KZQ2|5|Works great. I kept rinsing black tank until the water ran clear and now my holding tank monitor works perfect again'
B003G0MCN4|5|Fits the trunk like a glove! Protection is wonderful and looks really nice too!
B00B0ETZ9M|5|Excellent
B007ECFURK|5|Great
B00VE399VI|3|When they came to me one lens cover was broken off, I had to super glue it back on. Also there was a raddling noise in the same mirror. Both mirrors shake a little when driving. The only good thing is the mirrors look great on the truck
B0117FXJZ4|1|Bag smelt terrible!!!! Like toxic chemicals. Got a small partial refund. Nervous for my kid to use this even after I wash it
B000COCU8O|5|Perfect Fit
B000A0ILII|5|Fit perfect and for the money I feel it was a great buy.
B00CNI1SDA|5|Good stuff. Slightly misleading name - some leather is just dead.
B00EN7JOQC|1|Do not buy a waste of money its not in English
B0024E6V30|5|Use these camping with OR WITHOUT an RV. I filter the campground water to drink!
B0051V4ZMW|5|Perfect fit
B00N52LH7A|5|There things are huge. bought them for sand storms here in west Texas. they provide a good seal on my face and they're very clear.
B00BP4M7YW|4|I'll likely use this as a secondary pair of padded shorts  when my others are dirty.  I bought for dirt biking.  Haven't tried out yet.<br /><br />The tailbone pad is a bit cheesy.<br /><br />Overall, seems as advertised.  Much less expensive than other brands.
B00C6MXHIC|5|Perfect fit for my c35 laurel
B00KTHZUJU|5|Purchasing this key saved me $150+ off the dealer price and programming took less than 1 minute.  Super easy!
B00JA3BMDW|5|Works great
B00HYNXCE2|5|More stylish than the usual boring corporate signage, but gets noticed just as well.
B004YIXGMS|5|excellent
B003LJIZAY|5|Perfect fit on 08 ram 6.7!
B0002NIJUS|4|They shipped fast so receiving them quick was a plus. But the screws are cheaply made and didn't stay screwed in my car. Also they bend permanently after some time depending on how low you install them. I ended up just taking them off by hand since the screws are crap. They looked nice while they were on though
B00OOJFTGI|5|These are good quality and have rubber o-rings to help seal.
B001FGLN2W|5|Wipes all the dirt off the back glass of our 2011 Audi A3
B001CEXSE8|3|advertised as 2014 but really for 2007-2013,modified holes and brackets and made it work for my truck
B0076H0VHM|5|Does what it's supposed to do!
B000CKGAV6|4|Just installed these today on my equinox and they look good. They are a bit brighter than the standard light they replaced. Hopefully they will last as many years as the last pair.
B001O0BJUK|5|Outstanding buy and good quality Amazon does it again with Arvin prices and fast shipping. Can't beat it...
B00CEJCJNG|5|used for a portable sprayer.....works great!
B00SDGVDJK|3|This light works as described. not extremely bright but sheds light on the situation for working on the car.
B00LNIPCME|3|They are supposed to fit my '14 GMC Acadia, but they are generic and required significant re-enginering to fit. Finally made them fit 2nd row captain's chairs and 3rd row bench seat, but they were not large enough nor the right design for the front seats, which have a significant depression for the headrest to sit in. Material is quite cheap, but hope they may serve in lesser used seats. They look OK.
B00ONHPPCE|4|Haven't installed yet. I have an 06 silverado single cab work truck with tow hooks no fog lights. This is GRAY NOT BLACK!
B00VEW34LU|5|Awesome thanks for correcting the mistake! A+++++++
B00AR379U4|2|was the wrong carburtor
B00QO5NUH0|5|All I can say is perfect n very happy
B00E5OUOCQ|5|Good product
B001C6LG3Q|4|It worked quite well.
B008Y3OP24|5|Perfect fit!!!!!!!!
B003SYWZZS|5|Work as expected, simple LED solution for my dash .. I was looking for some sort of pod,  but wasn't able to find any so end drilling my dash.
B00KR7AY98|1|Carburetors  are cheep trash that doesn't  work
B00OPEFKBQ|5|Like others have said:  This is not a perfect OEM eyelash installation, but earns stars for the &#34;value&#34;.  It replaces the front marker lights that go on with Parking lights and headlights -- NOT Daytime running lights.  A very nice style upgrade to modernize the look, and at a very affordable price.  A few minutes to upgrade my 3-year-old, bottom-of-the-line LX with a fresh look.
B00QN8HFKQ|4|Well designed and made.
B000E3GHGE|3|Material is pretty thin.  Tore in a couple places just getting them on the seats.  Even though the indicated they were for our year/make/model - they do not have opening for the armrest.  Not sure how long they will hold up.
B00E0VCF8A|5|A+++
B00BIRBCA6|2|Where to begin?  I hate the fact that these have clips but at least they are painted black clips.. for however long that paint lasts anyway.<br /><br />The primary reason one would buy these is to allow air into the cabin of the vehicle but NOT moisture/rain.  This design kind of flies in the face of why one would want these!  The design allows for small areas of the window opening (when leaving the windows cracked) to be exposed.  This is the number one complaint I have with these!  These should have extended further down the front in length. Given the back tail ends flip up rather than remain straight these probably should have been wider as well - since the flip takes away from the space a window can be left open.<br /><br />I assume the tail ends flip up to reduce/eliminate wind noise while driving, and this does work to do that! I get no wind noise or drag while driving with windows up with these on.<br /><br />Of course this means I have to roll up the window, down the window, up the window, down, up, etc. until I finally get just a smidge of a crack for an opening.  Not only does this take time but I'm sure it will wear out my window motors that much faster!<br /><br />This is the third set of visors I've tried for my 2015 Kia Sorento, the other two didn't work either.  I've decided to keep these because even though the don't work that well, they still do work to a certain degree where the other ones didn't work well at all.<br /><br />And it goes without saying the price of these for plastic is totally insane..  I wish weather tech had these in my year/make/model but they don't yet.<br /><br />So I'll keep them but would advise you check Weather tech out to see if they have the year/make/model at the time you want them before you buy these.
B00CLLWZ1I|3|The kit showed up and everything was good other than no camshaft or rod bushings. It shows it and I called them and it is not offerd in this kit.pic is false advertising. Other than that everything else was good.
B000CJ8C9K|5|It's a NGK Spark plug that fits my John Deere L130 Lawn tractor with a Kohler Command 23HP motor.  They install as Original Equipment, with no identifiable increase/decrease in performance over the JD branded maintenance kit plugs and they are a lower price than the JD brand stuff.<br /><br />The included pic is the plugs after my annual maintenance and about 45-50 hours of use on them.  I don't need to replace them, but it's a habit.
B001QV88FQ|5|Fit my 99 blazer, solved all my steering issues. I did all the steering and alignment myself. too easy and the shop wanted over $800 for less than $100 in parts and about 4 hours of work. I will never pay a mechanic to work on my vehicles.
B0040DX7EO|4|Great mirror that adds better viewing from my rear view mirror.  The logo needs to go.
B00JF5LRN0|5|I purchased this along with a ROLA 59119 rainproof cargo carrier bag for my 2009 Acura MDX to support a coast to coast move. After driving 6 days through extreme heat and rain, my cargo contents remained safe. The cargo carrier provided enough space to allow full use of my trunk even when installed. I did have to purchase a hitch pin separately to secure this carrier to my trailer hitch which does not come with the carrier. Other than that, this is a great product which took less than 15 minutes to assemble.
B000HMPF06|5|I used this on my entire vehicle and it's wheels. I removed the wheels, cleaned all of the brake dust off of them and applied two coats of Rejex to the wheels. They are super slick and brake dust now wipes off easily. I would purchase this product again.
B007KSY5W4|4|Bought the same motor from camping world double the price
B008ML113E|1|product was as advertised
B000C560J8|5|good stuff
B002UC2XZ6|4|Love this filter for my Travel Trailer- improves the taste and smell of my water. Deducted one star because it came with incorrect fittings. Thankfully my local hardware store had what I needed in stock because I had already cut the cold water line under my kitchen sink. It is supplying filtered water to my whole house- if it lasts a year as advertised you can see what a bargain it is- even if I need to replace sooner, the replacemet filters are about $24 so I still consider it a good buy.
B008RPZWLC|5|Great product ,protects my vehicles,easy to work with! Good value
B0083WF6Q0|5|This was pretty good. Any plan to restock? This product alone doesn't keep it's place on a seat, but I used 2 bungee cords to hold it. And that works really well.
B00AZJYDQI|5|finally a clip on valve stem fitting that actually stays in place and seals without having to hold it.
B00GJQDT48|1|Neck is not long enough to fit what said it would.
B00HTOB0NG|5|ok
B0040CTUAA|5|These worked great on our 2010 Nissan Rouge.  Used to attach the covers by the wheel and some of the shroud under the hood.
B00FGPTBK4|4|At first I was nervous because after I ordered it a buddy said he had one and hated it, he said he constantly bumped his knees on it and since I was 6'3&#34; I was worried.  Installation was too easy unscrew 2 Phillips head screws replace them with the new ones supplied.  Hook the base in the groove and screw them back in.  The shelf could be a little bigger but it works great for me I have been keeping my wallet and my phone in it as well as my insurance info, my registration etc.  all in a bank bag.  I also keep my front plate in it so it will hold a bit of stuff.  I never once have hit my knees on it wouldn't even know it was there.  it gets 4 stars just cause its not deep enough but really I do love it.
B000CK9O50|3|The quality of the brake pads looked outstanding, however the brakes did not fit my 1999 Subaru Impreza Outback as the brake pads have a tab that would not fit the OEM caliper housing; I'm sure if the caliper was replaced with a matching Raybestos caliper the pads would fit; only gave 3 stars as I returned the brake pads.
B005SUXT6E|4|The recessed chock works great and love being able to store it when not on use.  One minor improvement - I will weld some angled material to center the tire in pop up chock (but it doesn't prohibit its use).
B00TE2WHEW|5|Exactly what we were looking for.  Installed easily on our 2006 Range Rover HSE.  No issues.
B00F9LPJ8S|5|Been using this battery for 4 months. No problems what so ever. Never trickle charged to date. Never left me stranded. Fully confident in its ability to get me rolling. Installed on 1997 SUZUKI savage.
B00Q8AQPHS|5|They are just what i wanted and cheap enough to.
B00EKTJOX6|5|Beautiful product, fits perfectly.
B00BNVJZPQ|5|Works for my 2012 Mazda 3
B007XKZ1NQ|1|Fall off<br />Won't stay on
B00KJAEL60|5|just the right thing.
B000ALG1VQ|5|I replaced the aging hatch struts on my 1997 Ford Probe GTS and what a difference. A little nudge lifts this very heavy hatch up and it take 2 hands to close it again. Finally a strong support for a large glass hatchback
B0002L6PJW|5|It doesn't get any better then this guys!
B00KTLNP8E|5|Same as original sensor. Got it installed no problem, but took a little time to uninstalled and installed the new one due to where is it located. Saved a lot of money if it was replace from the dealer.
B000IZ4A1M|3|they were ok but did not fit.
B0016KBTJE|5|Works great on my 2003 Toyota Camry.  I returned a Uhaul hitch that was too bulky looking because part of it went under the talipipe in rear and hung down too low, whereas this Reese hitch goes above the tailpipe and looks more normal.
B005JCQ5WQ|5|Very well made.
B000BUOSGG|5|Prefect fit for our RV sink.
B000CON4SO|5|works great
B0009N0W6U|4|Looks cool.
B001EOV46K|5|Just what I wanted.
B0031BQRVG|5|Perfect
B00T5ZKDB2|1|the didn't fit and they want pictures which I can't provide so I have to eat these!!
B000TTILZ8|1|Installed on a 1998 Lincoln Mark VIII.  Belt made noise. Was already doing work on the car and changed both idler pulleys and water pump and the noise didn't go away.  Used some belt dressing on it, still no luck. Installed old belt and noise went away.<br /><br />I contacted the Seller as soon as I found out it was a belt issue and they refused to RMA it because of the time that had passed.  I explained the car was down with the rear end work I was doing and it made no difference.<br /><br />Just go by a cheaper one from the local auto parts store.  Not worth the extra money.
B00K8I4CAI|5|Seems to work great. We used it to replace a brand name battery in our alarm system. So far, so good.
B00877SL2M|1|would not work
B00VOL798U|5|Fast delivery and descriptions right on the nose
B0002F68FO|5|Nice product. Easy install. Gives my wife and I much better stability going in and out of our RV.
B00BG4LE4U|3|In comparing it with my standard tread depth gauge I found it not as accurate.
B0009H51V2|5|Fit perfectly in my 1996 Toyota 4Runner.
B0084USM2Q|5|Delivery was faster than expected. Bars matched our car perfectly.
B00378K6LU|5|I have these on all four of my quads, they work awesome!
B000CEBX50|5|Used it for a 4X8 cargo trailer for 5 weeks in Canada and back to the US.  Worked great keeping everything in place and combined with a blue tarp, kept everything clean and dry as well.
B006WAMM80|1|Covers didn't fit my car as promised
B0067PUMXW|5|I put these on the back window of my car.  They beat the boring family stickers most folks have back there and serve as a reminder to the world of the pending zombie apocalypse
B00KQPMZIO|5|Love that my truck key can work on these; easy set up and less keys to carry.
B00AOGDNE0|4|great quality
B008YFTB4E|5|Great product and very good customer service
B000OUXUI0|1|it arrived 1 day late package tore apart 3 parts missing
B0057FU52G|5|Works Great!
B00LEBKDOC|1|First off, I did not buy these from Amazon. I got them from a neighborhood auto parts store. They are not worth the price. The driver's side wiper lasted less than 9 months. The 'rubber' blade has begun to tear away from the housing. I've had Walmart house brand wiper blades last longer than this.
B009IVM6C2|5|Fit my 2000 Chevrolet S10 well.  You will have to splice some wires, but its very easy to figure out and it worked out well in the end.  I did have one pitfall though.  I chose to remove the bed of the truck for this installation.  In removing the bed, I also detached the ground wire back around the tail-lights.  Well, it turns out that's also the ground wire for the pump, so it would not function until I put the bed back on and re-attached the ground.  That took me a day or so to figure out :)
B004GDAA6Q|4|WASNT EXACT BUT I MADE IT WORK
B002VW7EC2|5|Great product with fast shipping.
B010G6P77S|5|Just installed these and they look great.  The instructions were super easy to follow and the installation was a piece of cake.  Really really well engineered product.  Love them.
B00DBLIOSA|5|wow it looks amazing!
B00I4BNTLE|5|Works  great!
B000E0T6HY|5|excellent
B00F73F7BW|4|The floor mats were of high quality however they were packed in the smallest box possible so they were bent and warped upon arrival. To remedy this, I layed them out for a few days which helped. After they were placed in the car, they formed to the shape of the floor 95% which is more than adequate.
B00PHTXWQS|5|Much brighter than the original incandescent bulbs. Installed them for my front turn signals on my 2004 Silverado 1500.
B000TM7HXC|5|Perfect
B002VPLB32|5|This is a OEM filter. I was using the K&N filter, big mistake. Very poor gas mileage with the K & N, I installed this in about 3 minutes total. With this filter, on the highway I got an immediate jump in mileage. With the KN I was getting 18 mpg tops, now im getting 27/28 mpg. I'll stick with the OEM products from now on!
B00U31WDL0|1|anything more than a star is too high of a rating, terrible product.
B002SB02PC|4|Did not send any hardware to attach and no instructions.  Do look nice once I was able to figure out a way to install.
B005ZYAH4U|5|Perfect replacement.  Fast shipment.  Top quality!
B0035B04HA|5|So Awesome! Absolutely MAGISTERIAL! put it up on my blacked out toyota celica....It's beautiful!
B001DH4BLI|5|Verry Good Item.
B000C7QLCC|4|Fits perfect! Quality product.
B003XNGLJU|1|adhesive pad does not stick, whistle takes a dixie in the first rain.
B00Y7CCK46|5|Awesome.
B004IARRZO|5|As described. Received quickly.
B0068FZ6Z0|5|Five stars because they were cheap and worked exactly how I wanted them to.
B00EHIO7NM|5|Very bright I think. And good quality thank you.
B00QAMKNYK|5|Great
B005OZNZD0|5|great price for a great item
B000GU5LSK|4|Perfect! Looks great on my bike
B000HEBR3I|5|This little battery operated pump will do the job. I used it to pump water from my boat cover and was amazed how well it pumped. I would recommend this for this type of job. Very handy to have around.
B005PZMKZI|3|it does not fit with my car. it is not bad but not good.
B000XBFE7U|5|Excellent item. As advertised. Fast delivery. Well packed.
B0006VORDY|5|Works great I can boil 10 gal of water in less than 45 min and it compacts great, all my friends have campchefs and they love there's as much as I do mine.
B005TDKZHG|5|These mounts are awesome! They look sharp and mount easy.. They don't shake when driving down the road. I would buy from again!
B00C5RJNV8|5|Delivered as promised, excellent .., all as promised, .price. quality and deliver.
B00HPMZAPQ|5|I ordered these for my sons dirt bike. They are exactly what he wanted and I got them from much cheaper than I could have gotten them anywhere else. He informed me of something I never knew about these things. When you get them in, if you put them in the freezer until you get ready to install them, it keeps the barrens cold and keeps them from falling out when you try to install them. Makes sense because they are set in a greasy substance and i guess that substance freezes. Worked out great for him.
B00WJTEE1G|4|Works very well. I'm still not sure how to set them .. Make sure the backing nut is tight so they aren't little pieces floating around the globe box ..
B0042Z0XWY|5|Looks nice and good quality
B007LIB6AW|2|No issue with shipping, product is really attractive up close. But... it is too big for my 14.5 steering wheel in my 2014 Soul. I was so excited to get this to match my car and I'm really disappointed that it did not fit as advertised. it's not just a little loose, it is shifting under my hands which is not a good thing while driving. I had to take it off and put back on the one I had previously.
B00AUIJG0W|5|Also works amazing with plastic dip love it
B005Q73D24|5|This is an excellent product.  It's well-designed, well made, and has met all my expectations.
B004VG8DS0|4|Used painters tape to affix to hood and traced sides. Front edge on Tesla Model S is straight. Cut to fit and followed install directions except for using heat. Get a felt squeegee. Enough left over to wrap several cell phones.
B00CNEQZHS|5|Fit perfectly with no hassel
B00KYSV1J2|3|Very pleased! Was easy to get programmed!
B003BZ3E5E|2|The instructions that came with the product were almost unreadable they were printed so small. The directions were incomplete and were not specific for the vehicle. The 2 covers for the 2 front seats were different and there was not a way to differentiate what went where. Called service and they were very unhelpful. Would not buy from Coverking again.
B00CPUHRO0|3|Raw material such as the towel and rubber must functioning to install the seat position
B002Q907QU|5|a littler thicker then most boot oils I've used, excellent product.
B004QHI5XW|1|Good price, Seems to be built well and went in well. The only issue I had (not due to the part) was removing the old ones due to the age (2005) and mileage (243K) on the Jeep. Helpful hint for folks doing this on a Jeep GC WK, the day before you go to pull your old front bearings, spray WD40 in the small space behind the bearing where the CV joint/Half shaft go through the axle support and engages the bearing. This would be applied with a straw and position inside facing out. This will hopefully release some of the rust weld off the bearing and make for an easier removal. Granted I didn't have the right size puller so maybe someone with a little less &#34;shade tree&#34; approach might have an easier time than I did with my 3lbs hammer.  UPDATE: After 13 months and 25K Miles of these on my Jeep GC WK they started to fail. I originally just had the right front wear out and I thought, &#34;Hmm, maybe that was just a defect? So I bought another of these cheap bearings since they are at least $100 cheaper than any other&#34;. That was 2 weeks ago and now I hear the right front beginning to fail. The reality is obviously these have a ~25K mile life expectancy so you chose. The OEM bearings lasted 200K miles so unless you are planning on selling your car within the next 20K miles or you only drive 5K miles a year, I suggest you pay the extra money. In this case, cheap price = cheap product. Just thought you should know.
B005992QKO|5|Well made locks!
B00TG3NZUY|5|Good deal
B009DJYIH0|1|It seems like a nice window regulator little did I know it was made out of cheap metal and within six months of installation the gears the teeth on the wheel started stripping off. I highly recommend spending a little more and get in the right one. A total waste of money and time
B006WPA9E4|5|excelent
B00SUNH7GY|4|Great! Except one strip of led does not work correctly
B00DSO9JZW|5|Larger suckers than the previous holder I owned for the larger eZpass. Sticks to the window nice, holds the pass tight with no rattles and looks like it's going to stay there. Does the job as advertised. Would buy again
B00F64N052|5|Easy installation, keeps the heat out, completes the look of the interior. I attached photos of mine with the interior painted black to further compliment the head liner.
B00BISE6MG|1|I put 4 amg batteries in my Rv coach.  The reserve power is about 1/2 of 7 year old maint. batteries. not worth the extra cost.
B00RF9J8DY|5|Great product for its purpose.  My wife is very active with our church and is always taking my tools when ever it is needed.  This tool set is perfect for this reason.  She keeps it in her car along with some nails and screws that I've containerized for her to go along with her tool set.
B0040CU0HM|5|As described.
B00DJF4UKY|4|It is a little more tan than in the photos. It looks more like gold than the photos do it justice.
B0027Z1KE6|5|great so far
B000OR18BE|3|Front tires are not as pictured. They are inflatable. I tried to contact company no reply on how to fix tube that burst or was defective. Will work on contacting when back in town. Left message and email.<br />Overall product worked except for front tires.
B000C8Z898|4|Works like it should. Quieted my old Jeep down.
B000C2ZKDS|3|It is an affordable High Mileage filter.
B00HESFIJ4|5|easy to use, durable
B00KNNBMWY|5|Looks great on my Rav 4
B00V1MUF9W|5|nice
B000M5YZFY|5|It's a lot more heavy duty that I expected<br /><br />works great
B00E1SM47O|5|These are great thank you . and about one third what i paid for factory rear brake rotors.
B00GSAUHB8|2|This seemed to fit when I put it in the windshield, but when I returned to the car it had slumped down completely. So if you need a sun screen for the dash and steering wheel, this would do the trick. If you want a shade for your windshield, not so much. I bought an old fashioned accordian reflective plastic one, and am much happier.
B000EQR7XS|5|Perfect fit.
B002YKMCDW|4|Pretty slick little tool.  Much easier to read and more repeatable than the circle ones.
B00DBERD9S|1|forget about this one
B00HDMEU68|5|Works great! Easy to put on, easy to take off to wash.
B009IFKG0W|5|fast ship, excellent product at a fair price
B00JMCCE6U|4|It's what my Dodge Ram recommends, it does the job
B00GBVHQB8|4|They give me some hotspots (pre blisters) when I wear them awhile. But hey, I paid 7 dollars.
B000CO788G|4|Cable appears to be manufactured well and the new attachment hardware was included.
B00BAZCRRS|5|new item, on time
B008D5TTBU|5|Just what I want...!!!
B000O51VJ0|5|More than has met our expectations. So much heat from such a small heater.
B000C5I2YO|5|Great pad. Actually doing better than the factory one in my opinion.
B00T7CRMJY|2|This was a repackaged seatcover that didn't fit my Ford F150 at all.  When I searched Amazon, I searched for my vehicle in particular.  This vendor shouldn't send out product that obviously doesn't fit. Its nice material and I would have kept it if it had fit.
B002R0LKWS|5|fits well was little tight but was no big deal if you know what your doing an matches the color of the stock one exactly. have not had any leaks yet
B00GHT7JUC|5|Worked on my 2000 Cherokee with cruise control. - Fixed the problem when my old clock spring died and my horn and cruise went dead, and my airbag light came on.  Here is a good video that I used on how to swap out the clock spring on a Cherokee https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxYHC6oX6eQ
B00BN5XVZW|5|My head measures about 23&#34; around. I debated getting the Large size but after reading reviews that the sizes ran a little small I decided to get the XL. I'm glad I went the next size up. The helmet fits nicely, not too tight and not too loose.<br />The stitching and vents seem sturdy and I haven't noticed any glaring quality problems.<br />The flat black is a bit of a fingerprint magnet but doesn't bother me as it's easy to clean.<br />I also purchased the tinted Series B face shield and now my helmet looks even more sexy. Search YouTube for steps to swap the face shield, it's very simple.
B001VACMXQ|5|Fits and looks amazing!
B0000V0EB4|1|JUNK
B00KXE3Q3Q|5|Love it!
B000EDQR50|5|Great quality, better construction than OEM catches on my RV.
B0083TKK5A|5|Purchased these for car wash bucket.  There are several ridges on the bottom of the bucket that work great for cleaning off wash mitt between uses.  Good qualify, not poorly made.
B002R0YHF0|5|Perfect fit and price
B00UO7VD4Q|5|I saw this company name on Nissan Murano blog. I have a unique color so I was surprised how well color matched. I purchased a CPO vehicle I love so needed to repair minor scratches. Im satisfied!
B005FG6936|1|The brake light/bulb is defective. Supplier wants me to take a picture of the defective bulb. I'm still figuring out how to take picture of the inside of the bulb without breaking the glass.
B00353PWAW|5|Love this stuff!
B0055A2N2S|1|Arrived with no software load, rendering the service number meaningless.
B004YHOAMY|4|great combo of products, chemical guys stuff is top notch.  Definitely gives paint extra gloss and silky smooth finish
B009XOTRBM|4|Hitch was easy to install, you only need a tape measure and a 3/4&#34; wrench to get the job done!
B000BUQOAE|4|It work well I would recommend to anyone
B000FPXV5G|3|Holes are a little bit on the small side. Hold a coke can perfectly but not cups from fast food restaurants to well. Overall its ok.
B0013I2GJQ|5|Put them in the car and the brightness is perfect
B0010AYJEC|3|From reading the questions and comments I was under the assumption that the product came with screws. There was no screws and that made me very sad. Shipping was on time and product was good minus the screws that were missing. It should be stated clearly that this does not come with screws
B003YLH9QA|5|Helped solve my a/c problem!
B000ZMI596|5|Exactly what I wanted.  Perfect.  Couldn't be happier.  They let me e-mail several times as I was worried about the exact wording top and bottom.  Came fast too, within a week, looks wonderful!
B001GJ3FEC|5|working well after a year and have held up to 10+ washes so far. had to pull off a few hard plastic strings along the seamline which I'm certain might have scuffed or swirled a clearcoat so just be careful before you start using them
B00WCQDBCY|1|Led's don't work less than half of the lights ended up turning on. Took the car to shop and was told product was no good. Had all light bulbs tested and only 4 of 13 worked.
B00EC2CN2K|5|Actually a little longer than I need, but the bungee itself is of good quality.  Good duty cord and caribiners.
B002PUTC0M|5|Great inflator, worth every penny.  To those twits who can't seem to put the batteries in without a screwing up the screws...leave the wrenching to professionals.  I had the batteries in and the tool operational within five minutes.  Love the fact that I can let air out of the tire as well as put it inb.  Buy the tool, you'll love it.
B00PV5CGI8|5|Love love love these car mats! I trimmed all the excess for the driver's side so as not to interfere with my pedals and minor trimming on the others. They fit perfect and look really good inside my car. Good quality rubber mats without the strong scent.
B001IH8Q0A|5|I have used this on my class 2 hitch that is 1 1/4&#34; to use with a hitch tray for a 400 mile trip. It has held up well in the highway and some uneven roads. It was very sturdy. There was a little play with the tray but it didn't impede function.<br /><br />Just remember for your safety, Use only with a class 2 hitch and not with the class 1.
B00R8ILPTW|5|Fit the Toyota Avalon XL 2000 perfectly
B010KZCURA|5|Very nice look great love them fast shipping !
B00E1SOLH0|5|Great part
B004HCM9H4|5|This is excellent wax, goes on easy and it removes even easier.  I hate wax that sticks to everything and after hours of working on your car you are unable to get it all off.  This wax can go on your plastics, rubber, etc. without worry.  Does not leave any white residue on your plastics, smells great, and lasts long.
B001ECT3BK|4|satisfied
B0089UEOKA|4|Works as it should, I painted mine with black high temp grill paint to help protect it from rust as I live in the North East. Only issue is it came up about 4 inches short on the rest of the exhaust, would recommend either welding in an additional piece of piping or simply purchasing a high flow cat/test pipe to solve the issue.
B000C9JS66|5|Perfect fit works great
B001CF4UXU|5|Rugged and durable strap, a recovery must.
B003FYKF9Y|5|Parts only been on for a few days so I cannot comment on any performance gains however, part is well built and easy to install.
B000NS5UZ4|5|Worked great and price was right
B0035GQ4UQ|5|Worked perfect,good quality,and fast shipping!
B00DV91B96|5|Loved doing loomed beadwork, hated sewing in warp threads when I was done!  Cuts my project time down by half!  Love!
B0075XHDHI|5|just what I needed at a good price
B008VLVDII|5|Very Nice!
B001TI5IIQ|5|Great product! I just received it today and have alreaxdy used it.on my Subaru Forester headlights. They were yellowed and dull and now they almost look new. Just the tiny nicks from road debris remain but the clarity is great. Takes a bit of time to restore the headlight but that is to be expected. Easy to use, just make sure you follolw the directions.
B007CN9IJW|5|Do what they are made for!
B00429Y8ZI|5|This bell solar ashtray with metal canister is a good product.  Also love the solar light.
B00A0JFLFU|5|Great replacement.  Just like new.  Got rid of all of the noise that I thought were my new tires.  Increased MPG.  Smooth and silent ride is back!  This was for 07 Lexus ls460
B0049HSMGE|3|I can't rate this item due to the fact that it did not fit the vehicle it was ordered for.
B00TBHXC4E|5|Although this formula has been specially formulated for &#34;Clear Vinyl&#34; *as it dries clear and leaves no discoloration or noticeable residue. I've found that it works just as well on colored vinyls like the dash pad on my 67 Impala.  It is black and it shows any swirls or swipe marks left by a variety of vinyl cleaners I've used in he past. This goes on and off without any noticeable marks and it also makes the surface look like new. The layer of dust that appears almost instantly after cleaning in the past is not there. I think it just blows off as the rough, dull places where it could settle into are filled in with this protective cleaner. However it works, my car and I are loving it!
B003LLZIJ8|5|Exact fit, firing clean and quiet!
B001NYYSLY|5|AAAA+
B0024NSGYS|3|Happy so far.  Do not try to use led<br />Bulbs.
B0016KABFC|5|Thanks
B0024E6V9E|3|It really needs more support to stand up to the weight of the filter.  Didn't use for much because the Culligan RVF-10 filter I purchased leaked.
B00651CACY|5|Works. Good quality.
B00K1PQDGO|3|graphics did not fit my radiator plastic on my 98 yz250 other than that everything else fit well
B0050SFZBG|4|Really good for boats with old corroded hose barbs and glued on hoses. So far this thing has worked on all sizes large and small. I flattened the tip (1 mm) and use it for tubing as well. Black handle is invisible so wrapped w red adhesive heat shrink. Only marked 4 stars because OTC has let me down recently and I have since stopped buying the brand.
B00ZV9XUV6|4|Work perfectly for my Chevy remote start
B0000AXC24|5|Very high quality which has a built-in Guage same quality of any auto shop. Super buy...
B0054YCW62|5|Love this cargo net, used it last week while on vacation. The hooks are movable so you can place them where needed. With the ability to move the hooks this net can be used on different truck bed sizes, which is great for me as I have two different pick-up's.
B000NCOKZQ|5|Worked perfectly for connecting my LiFePO4 battery to my Battery Tender charger.
B00FNXBTMC|5|Purchased to replace old GE security system back up battery. Perfect fit. Takes a while to charge up.
B0010ADJIE|5|Worked great! Just what I needed for the boat.
B00JIB5T94|5|Just as good as the original, very strong and easy to install on my 2000 Volvo s70
B0006JO0TC|4|Works great.  I have surfed the internet with this 5 watt cell, but it takes too long to recharge.  Needs more power.
B00YMTJN2G|3|didn't come with gasket like it needed.
B0009YIE1O|5|Works as advertised.
B0034ZT4DM|5|Much better performance than the oe. No cavitation during maneuvers. Hole shot is much better. Top end is the same as before.
B0054YE8AU|5|Easy to use.
B004306VTC|5|Great mat, shipped fast.
B00IPDQWLK|1|Product arrived poorly manufactured. Did not work at all
B0023WEVQC|5|Perfect
B00GI781BY|2|It doest fit my 04 tacoma  and it snapped as I tried to get it to fit a second time and leds are not very bright
B006WPQNB2|4|As a portable easy to use pottie, I think it's awesome.  We use our boat fairly heavily in the summer and early fall.  The toilet probably gets used twice a day minimum by each of us.  We can, ahem, &#34;down load&#34; into it about 20 times before the full indicator comes into view - so that's about 2 weeks use for us)<br /><br />Once full, it weighs about 50 pounds.  It can be carried by one person to a standard toilet or pump out station to empty it.  If you have two people, that's certainly easier, and the bottom unit (the poop portion) is equipped with a couple of handles for two people to walk together carrying that bit of themselves down the dock.<br /><br />we have a Tattoo 26 (MacGregor 26M) with the head on the starboard side.  We found it possible to conveniently tie the unit in place.  It stays rock steady even on heeling more than 35 degrees.<br /><br />Perhaps the only downside we've had is that opening the pottie valve to dump the waste into the bottom half can fill the boat with some challenging odors.  The unit does come with a liquid chemical to help eliminate those odors at the source, and we've found it on the low end of reasonably effective.  We're still experimenting with the whole odor elimination issue, but have found increased relief with using both the liquid chemical and being conscientious with a spray odor neutralizer afterward too.<br /><br />To be clear, any bad odor does not last long.  We're talking seconds really.  Nothing to worry about unless you have the weakest stomach ever.
B00SAXBP30|5|Nice and bright and appear to be good quality. Wires are a bit hard to work with since they are so small but overall I am happy.
B00915JI08|4|Fit and worked as well as the original.
B002EFP68U|4|Great fit and finish .
B000CO82DG|5|Sounds great! !!
B00BFE473G|5|It fits perfect!!
B00EJWX9IU|2|SMaller then I expected
B000F5LJQO|5|Worked just fine, would buy again
B000LY5LWC|5|Worked great.  My son put them on quickly.  They look really nice and work as a step up into my van.
B001KSG3OS|3|THe quality of this isn't that great, but as a temporary it's alright
B000T5BI8Y|4|Worked as advertised for limiting side to side and in and out movement. Did not stop up and down movement.
B00GSQ8MSC|5|good cuality
B001FAGLAM|5|Installed with no problem, clear directions.  Arrived ahead of schedule.  Will recommend to anyone who has a Ford with the vacuum system that needs service or repair.
B00NM1A8SI|1|Not for use with an iPhone
B00A7WAHTU|5|Good quality set of JIS Screwdrivers.
B001QUP82I|5|Bolted right in like the originals from 1971!  Couldn't be happier with the design.
B000HHYEMQ|5|Just like the one I broke. Works great if you use it correctly.
B002KMBJBA|5|Fit perfect. Good price.
B00S4OUU90|5|Looks nice
B007UBLSSU|5|Great product at a great price!
B0012INT98|3|The carrier held a lot and worked fine but the zipper pull broke off after first use.
B000Q0S0FQ|2|Didn't fit my 2006 Charger even though they said it would
B000GD5FMY|3|My second pair. Not bad for the money.
B00J11NJ2U|4|Works as expected but the reflective film has a large bubble in it and I'm unsure if it will last with daily use compared to my previous coverking.
B00KN0UOEE|5|Works great!
B000NSMXPY|5|This is a good product. Good quality material. In sits within the saddle of my jack. It should sit over it, but I ordered the wrong size, but it still works fine this way, because I put another smaller BMW specific pad on top of it. It conserves the body work of my car(s), when using my jack
B005LS6QWW|5|Gift for a family member to put on the keys of their new Highlander.
B0059XCVVO|5|Arrived in 3 days as expected...Beware of size 12&#34;
B00V5AY2P8|5|The dash cap arrived much quicker than we expected. Following the installation instructions was very easy.  You can not tell the dash cap is an add on, it looks great
B00QNR08D8|5|Well made
B00374TL56|5|The Mats are good quality and they fit in my 2000 Mitsubishi Galant ES and even came a little early
B002NBMW0U|4|fit fine, however make SURE and remove the old seal (light orange) that may stick up inside the transmission fluid intake.  It'll slip right out if left in there and this new filter kit will slip right in place.  Just watch for the old seal section to stick in tranny!
B000WOHIFE|5|As described.
B00K8D9P2I|5|AWESOME
B000BQR100|5|works well for us
B002D33QBW|5|As Advertised.
B003U4RS1M|5|batter than Lucas.
B000765MHI|3|Pretty loud; good air though.
B00MIZT7OK|4|Lethal Purrrtection! Light weight and Sharp! I find that the finger holes are a bit snug for my comfort tho.
B003CKGYIW|5|Mucho better then stock
B004W988CC|4|Havent installed it yet but it look bout right
B0002SA22Q|5|Perfect
B00JMUKIHO|5|Great price fit great no problem than you ....
B002F05R7E|5|just like originals.... Fit and finish are awesome!!!
B00771Y07E|5|Good oem product. Fast shipping
B00D9C2CDO|5|Perfect bag I love this. Great for my family of 5. Used this for camping and soon we are driving from mi to fl. This is a great roof bag buy this right now!!
B006D1GBMG|5|I am very happy with this HID kit. I had someone installed the kit on my 2008 Honda CR-V and it works and looks really good. I like the fact that the kit enhances the way my SUV looks from the front. I would highly recommend this HID kit.
B003S0B9EA|4|Wings are quite long & unadjustable. Too wide to fit in my Mercedes 380 SL with the soft top, but a nice fit with the pagoda!
B00TV6S8ZI|1|They should of included a small Allen wrench to install, the big complaint is you can't find a installation mug to fit in it
B00F5GAFPY|5|Looks great!
B00UG52P7U|3|Great for toy storage. The tablet insert sits too low to watch anything on the iPad. The plastic piece that goes over the iPad also glares making it hard to see. We just use that section for more toy storage which is needed anyway.
B00065ZIJ2|5|its the best lock i've ever had. Its way lighter than all the other steering locks i had before. Fully satisfied with the product.
