B00127RAJY|5.0|I'm a ballet dancer, and I'm always looking for a really good workout that doesn't take a million hours to do but is very beneficial.  I've been doing this workout for almost three weeks, and I love it!  Each of the three levels are very challenging in their own way and work different parts of your body.  For instance, the first level had difficult arm exercises; the second level had high intensity aerobics as well as arm and leg exercises; and the third level really works your legs and everything else (my inner thighs were sore for a couple of days after doing the third level).    Each level has three circuits of three minutes of arms, two minutes of aerobics, and one minute of abs.  It really gets you breathing hard, so I suggest to be aware of your breathing and time it with the exercises.
B000WQWPKA|4.0|The blu-ray video transfer is great as is the audio, but I was disappointed that the extended version of the film wasn't included, as it was on the regular DVD.  Other than that, I'd have given it a \\"5\\".
0743454537|5.0|Our book club consists of women ages 26-60 and everyone enjoyed reading this novel. I believe there's something in it for everyone and really, Jodi Picoult does such an excellent job of expressing so many varied points of view.     It can be emotional at times but none of it is forced the way other novels sometimes pull you into tear jerker moments. I very much recommend this book to anyone who wants a good read and is hoping for something that will be a page turner without having to be an action or mystery novel. You'll really care for the characters, which is something I believe is crucial to enjoying any book.

1594489505|5.0|The book is well written and informative (in terms of the country's history.  I could not put down this book and am looking forward impatiently for the author's next book.
1595141715|4.0|I started this book at 11:00 at night, and let me tell you, it creeped me out. It wasn't until the next day, (when it was light outside) that I really got into it. The story didn't become creepy anymore, It became...compelling. The story is about high school student Clay Jensen receiving cassete tapes from a girl--who killed herself two weeks earlier. We follow the tapes through what seems to be a list of people and how they contributed to her suicide.        This story is so interesting. I've never read a book like it. The one thing I hated about the book though, was that while we are listening through these tapes, the end product is inevitable. Nothing changes. She still kills herself, and that's what makes this book really sad. Don't get me wrong, I loved it. But \\"listening\\" through these tapes, you can tell, Hannah isn't a very strong person. Sure, suicide is an easy way to end your problems, but it takes an even stronger person to move past everything they've been through, instead of taking the easy way out.               \\"Suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem.\\"

0446401307|4.0|A radiotherapist is shot to death on an overlook near his home. It looks like another \\"ordinary\\" homicide until it is discovered that right before his death he stole 26 ampoules of radioactive cesium from one of the hospitals where he worked. The cesium would be exchanged against his wife, who is kidnapped. All lights start flashing at the FBI, especially when a witness thinks he might have heard someone calling \\"Allah\\" at the moment of the shot. Harry Bosch is not only up against a murderer, but also against special terrorism units from both the FBI and his own LAPD. His mission is to find that killer, which he is sure will lead to the cesium, the mission of the terrorism units is to find the cesium, forget about the killer. In the end both are a little bit right and the solution is much more mundane, but also more sad, than one would initially expect.    Another one in the Harry Bosch series with Harry having yet another partner, but teaming up with the FBI agent Rachel Walling that we already met in previous books. Not the most nerve-wracking book of the series, but a solid piece of detective writing again.
0736063684|5.0|Simply stated, this book is awesome.  I just started working out this year.  Everything my hired trainer is teaching me is in this book, and more.  I love the way it shows you exactly what muscles are being affected by an exercise.  If theres something you want to target on a certain day, just get this book out and start working!  It is great!
B000M341RI|5.0|Though I've seen this film at least twice, I've wanted to have it as part of my personal film library for some time. The Full Monty reveals just how excellent the British are at making movies that are entertaining and informed with sensibilities that touch the human heart. This one makes you 'LOL\\" while touching on the reality of the changing economic forces that put many people in the position of having to go in directions never fathomed in order to survive. Every single frame gets 5 stars from me!!!

B000MQC9H4|4.0|The Holiday is an enjoyable film that proceeds along two parallel storylines.  First we have Kate Winslet and her holiday experience travelling from London to spend the holidays in Los Angeles.  Second we have the parallel story of Cameron Diaz, and her holiday in England after leaving Los Angeles.      Kate Winslet's story, in particular, was well acted and very entertaining.  Cameron Diaz's story was also entertaining, with the introduction of Jude Law's character.  However, I had one major problem with the Cameron Diaz storyline.      SPOILER ALERT!!!    During the course of the film, we learn that Jude Law has two young daughters, and that he is a widower.  He is struggling to raise his young children, do well in his career, and maintain some semblance of a social life.  However, other than the one time when Jude Law informs Cameron Diaz that he is a widower, there is absolutely no mention of the late wife.  Even the children make no reference to her.  It is as if there are no lasting scars at all of the late mother.  I would have expected that the passing of a mother would have a tremendous emotional impact upon a young family, however we see no onscreen reflection of this.  Some onscreen development of this storyline would have helped.  Perhaps a conversation between Jude Law and Cameron Diaz where they discuss his late wife, or perhaps one of the children mentioning that she misses her mother.  Yet the film contains nothing like that.      We are then left with an odd situation: a young handsome father, with two charming daughters, just waiting for a woman to walk into their lives.  Any lasting impression of the late wife/mother has been completed wiped out.  It is as if the writers were searching for a way to create a situation to make Jude Law's character very sympathetic, through a tragedy, and then showing most of the good side of the equation, with little of the pain that must have come with the passing of the wife.  I found this very odd, and it detracted from the film.      Otherwise, the film was well written and enjoyable.  The storyline about Kate Winslet befriending the famous screenwriter is particularly good.  Overall a very enjoyable movie.
B000006XSD|1.0|By far and away.....no questions....only for completists.  This is where the dreadful box set gets it right.   Only two good songs.  The very rock and rolling it's Hot Tonight and You and Me.  Besides these two enigmas I have no idea what Alice was thinking.   Even as a total drunk (i mean this respectfully) this is the worst piece of drivel Alice ever did.  Check out DADA or the two MCA releases.....God forbid.....the nadir of his career.  Everyone has to get back on their feet.  Beware all fans and new fans, unless you have everything else that Alice has committed to tape please pass.  Nothing here that, unfortunately, deserves any attention.
0465043550|2.0|Mandelbrot is quite a character. I admire the guy's independence, his creativity, his chutzpah and all his achievements in the world of mathematics. However, this book is an intellectual rat hole. This is the type of book you could read and immediately feel smarter than those silly practitioners who have to make do with bad models, like the Gaussian and the CAPM. But the fact of the matter is, Gaussians and CAPM are a good way to go. A good fraction of modern life is based on these models. Anyone who has worked with the actual financial data for a few seconds will realize they're baloney (at least compared to models like Maxwells Equations), but they still are quite useful.  Mandelbrot makes it sound as if some lone genius might some day come up with a mathematically perfect distribution which works better than a Gaussian and steal all the MBA's money. This is not a useful way of thinking about things, to say the least. Mandelbrot doesn't point us towards the useful ways of thinking about such things.<br /><br />While Mandelbrot stands at one fat tail of his statistical distribution, this book is somewhere in the opposite tail. Don't waste your time.
B000002I99|5.0|The last great Alice album.......for awhile.  Keep it short.    This album really picks up where Billion Dollar Babies leaves off.  I often times wonder where Alice would have gone from here if he was not so far off in his addiction.  Man, God bless Alice for coming back.  I know that this is not much of a review of the album, but I think it is.  If you know what Alice has done lately you might recognize that this is very Cold cold cold cold octane.    If you are an Alice fan, this is a must have;  top ten.....my opinion, number 5 of everything he did.  God bless Bob Ezrin.  He knew talent.  Does anyone know if he has produced anything lately........Three greatest producers of all time.....Mutt Lange.......Roy Thomas Baker.......Bob Ezrin

B00127RAJY|5.0|I've done this work out three times now, starting at the first level. So far so good, it's made with really basic and simple moves that are super effective. I love the fact that it's going back to simple (jumping jacks, push ups...) moves. The first two times I did the level one workouts I was so sore the next day! I haven't been active for a couple months so thats partly why, but at least I know that the 20 minute workout actually did something and was worth it!
1582701709|1.0|My sister begged me to read this book as she maintained it was of tremendous help to her.      First of all, this books seems be written by 2 people, or one that wised up as she was writing.  First person was likely the author of many of those late night infomercials that promise to make you $5,000 in the first week of doing something part time.  Second person at least made the read somewhat interesting, but it doesn't start until about 1/3 of a way through this.    The book brings up quantum physics here and there.  Some nerve.  There are very sound \\"theories\\" in quantum mathematics and physics that do relate to humans, universe and time and how everything is interconnected. But this voodoo is more like what I named my review - quantum alchemy.      Even philosophically speaking, their theories have holes the size of empire state building, that they simply do not have the intelligence to see through and correct - maybe they'll fix it for second edition.    During one of these \\"get rich quick\\" paragraphs, one of the supposed experts condescendingly notes that the reason why not everyone drives a BMW, is because \\"not everyone wants to drive a BMW\\", implying that some people are actually happy driving 1992 Oldsmobile Eighty Eight.  But their whole theory is based on the fact that you can get absolutely anything you want, without limits (!) or effort - you just have to think about it.  So driving in your Olds, and getting passed by a shiny new 550i - you wouldn't just want to wish it for you?      And the whole ANYTHING you want without limits bit - so I can technically wish myself onto the next spaceship headed for Alpha Centauri?     My sister claims that this books helps her with finding parking (one of the applications of this theory that is described in the book) - so I guess if you live in the area that has very little free parking and a lot of paid parking, this book might be worth getting as you actually might save yourself the cost of it in parking fees, pastthat - get a comic book, it will be more entertaining and more truthful.

B00004TRD8|5.0|I have seen all versions of T2 and the Ultimate Edition DVD is the one to buy:  T2:Extreme Edition DVD is just the theatrical release with very little extras.This version comes in a metal case and on disc 2 is a PC version of the film(don't ask me why).  T2:Blu Ray is the theatrical release with very little extras,the HD transfer isn't much better than the SD version.This version comes with the standard Blu Ray case.  T2:Ultimate Edition DVD has three versions of the film plus it's loaded with extras on the second disc.You can spend days going through all the extras on the second disc and if you hit a wrong button on your remote the terminator will threaten you.This version has the easter egg(82997) that allows you to view the directors cut which in my opinion is the best version.This version comes in a plastic case with a cardboard jacket,it includes an informative booklet.  The picture and audio quality of all versions is outstanding.
B000068FUS|5.0|As much as radio -- and really most of the general public -- would like to think, Southern Rock did not die along with Ronnie Van Zant.<br /><br />The Drive-By Truckers' ode to the music they grew up on is a brilliant piece of songwriting. Utilizing nostalgia, culture and masterful storytelling, the Truckers take the listener on a journey to their youth and tell tales of personal tragedy, coming of age, musical discovery, and cultural acceptance.<br /><br />But what makes this album truly great is that it doesn't alienate the listener if they aren't Southern. While it is geared towards those from below the Mason-Dixon, it is written in a way that invites others to try and understand and share in DBT's upbringing.<br /><br />Any fan of rock n roll should give this a listen -- especially people who like dirty, fast, crank-it-up-to-11 rock.
B0015D3Z4O|2.0|I have to say that this is my least favorite Madonna album.     Buried under the pointless raps and overdone production and overlong repetition is a really great pop album. But unfortunately the hip-hop fools move in and destroy nearly every song. I like \\"Miles Away\\" and \\"Devil Wouldn't Recognize You\\" (except for the stupid Boyz II Men type harmony toward the end of the song) and \\"Voices\\" (except for Justin Timberlake's silly intro), but other than that, the album falls flat.     Listening to it, I kept wishing that it was just a simple pop album, then it would have been wonderful. \\"Incredible\\" is the lightest and bounciest song she's written since \\"La Isla Bonita,\\" but it's ruined by running too long and collapsing into mindless repetition. Nearly all the songs on this album suffer from too long a running time. Alas.     My favorite of Madge's albums remains Bedtime Stories.
B00005RG6B|5.0|This DVD sure brought back fond memories of the best concert I have ever seen - and I have seen numerous concerts over the years.  I was one of the 10,000 or so that can actually say I was there the night in Madison when it was filmed, and am glad I was.  I had purchased the VHS version upon release, but that since has gone the way of the VCR itself.  The ONLY disappointing thing I had with the DVD version is that there was no booklet included that acted as a \\"program\\" for the production, unlike the original VHS version.  Otherwise...it was all that I expected - and remembered!
0452289963|5.0|I have been sharing Echhart Tolle's book \\"A New Earth\\" with my yoga students and anyone else that will listen.  This book has given me such an amazing view of the world and the \\"dramas\\" that we all live through.<br />If you are interested in living a more spiritual lifestyle, this book is for you.  Very insightful as well as practical.  Eckhart Tolle teaches the universal truths in clear English with little or no ego.  This guru rocks!
B00065MDRW|4.0|I hadn't heard it in a very long time. It's not played often on the air, but I caught a little bit of it watching \\"Children of Men\\". It's been put away in my collection and will be brought out occasionally. It brought some great memories flooding back how ever vague they may still be.
0061122092|5.0|Coelho is, hands down, my favorite author. After reading several of his novels, I couldn't wait to read this book. And I was not disappointed. Although there are countless formulas for writing love stories, somehow this book was different. I was captivated. Coelho has such an amazing way of expressing the character's feelings that you come to really know the characters in his stories.  All of Coelho's novels have themes, this one being 'forgivness'. At first, I didn't really grasp why, but after reading it, I think its a story about forgiving yourself.  Pilar (the main character in this story) takes you through a week that she spends with a childhood friend whom she hasnt seen in over a decade but happens to be in love with. During this week, Pilar experiences a huge 'ephinany' and begins to rediscover her faith. (I thought this novel focused a little to much on religion, but the concept of religion can be looked upon as a metaphor).   When I finished the book, I literally sighed with relief. I'm not sure why. Coelho's language brings you into a completely alternate world than your own and makes you actually feel the character's feelings.   READ THIS BOOK!!
0425188809|5.0|I discovered WATCHERS back when it first came out thanks to the Mystery Guild.  Gave it a shot (having never heard of Dean Koontz at that time!)and fell in love with the book. I recently reread it, fearing it wasn't as good as I remembered it but it was still terrific! I have recommended this book to everyone I know and not one person has been disappointed in it. WATCHERS is one of the formative books of my life - right up there with IN COLD BLOOD, SALEM'S LOT, TIME AND AGAIN etc.  It is one of the most entertaining novels ever written. With WATCHERS Koontz became one of my all time favorite authors. I knew when reading WATCHERS that Koontz would now be added to my very short list of \\"go-to\\" authors. Just as I knew I'd be a Stephen King fan while reading CARRIE and an Anne Rice fan after INTERVIEW WITH THE VAMPIRE. While not every Koontz book has been up to the level of WATCHERS, most of them have been wonderful and a handful, amazing.  If you haven't read this yet, please don't wait. I really don't think you'll regret it.

B00000IPAX|5.0|So who wouldn't want to buy this CD?<br />Especially with the album cover (you know what I'm talkin' 'bout)!<br /><br />Anyways, she is the first woman I fell in love with back in 7th grade...<br />And with her came my love for blink-182...  Their style and music is so catchy that I never get tired of listening to any of their CD's, however, I have to say this one might be their best!<br /><br />Every song/track has it's own character/story that makes it interesting, and easy to get hooked into.  Whenever I want to go back to the 90's I chuck this CD in and remember all the good ol' days when girls weren't PMS-ing, school was fun, US exchange was up, gas prices were down (even though I couldn't drive), and I wasn't so stressed out.<br /><br />Even the title of this album makes me laugh! Ha ha ha, so clever, so clever....<br /><br />^_^

B0015D3Z4O|5.0|Let me add my voice to the chorus of five-star reviews for Madonna's latest musical effort. She continues to surprise and delight and HARD CANDY is a solid effort: danceable, in step with the times (as only Madge can be), and a slickly-produced winner. It's very rare I buy a CD on which I love every single song...but that's the case here. This is one you'll listen to again and again...it only gets better!

B000W4D94I|2.0|Lets see, where do I start? Color banding, poor contrast, heavy film grain, soft focus and a lackluster True HD soundtrack. Warner Brothers should have never put this out like this. I remember the original SD DVD as looking pretty darn good. Not the usual quality we expect from Warner Bros. I'm thinking they are in a hurry to rush this stuff out so keep an eye on reviews before buying. What irritates me is that this Blu-Ray release received decent reviews from trusted sources on the internet. I don't see how they could have possibly missed these serious flaws. After reading some of these reviews here, I see the consumers obviously have not missed them.

0670018651|5.0|I am thrilled to have this book on my shelf.  Even though I do not agree with all of the reviews, it has been lots of fun to look up my favorite scents as well as those I am considering purchasing.  I have been taking the scent pages out of magazines and looking them up so the book is filling up with lots of those 'sniff' samples sticking out of it.  The reviews are smart and witty; an imaginative use of language adds to the enjoyment.    It is a great combination of information and fun.
B0002DB0FO|5.0|I've been holding off on this review for a while because frankly I can't begin to express how good this show is. One of my favorite shows of all time has been \\"The Wonder Years\\" and I'm starting to think that Everwood is even better. The Characters are deep. The Drama is excellent but not over bearing with a wonderful balance of humor at just the right moments. And the story's are wonderful without being afraid to tackle issues of the day. Buying it is a no brainier now that its only Nineteen Ninety Nine. The only problem is there is very little known about whether the last 3 seasons are coming out anytime soon. So If you get hooked good luck trying to find those episodes. *wink* Really I can't tell you how good it is your going to have to see for yourself and really at the price of a newly released movie could you really pass up the chance of a at least what you can consider a wonderful 17 hour mini-series.
B000R7I3LY|5.0|I was pleasantly surprised by how good this disc is.  Sara is truly a great song writer, poet and singer.  What you hear on the radio barely scratches the surface of what she has to offer.  Some of the deeper cuts are the best.  I  highly recommend this disc.
B0010YSD7M|5.0|This two-hour conclusion of the Ori storyline (which would have been drawn out into Season 11 had the show not been canceled) was well-written, well-developed and well-done! While all Stargate fans would have preferred an actual Season 11, at least we can now rest easy knowing how the Ori threat was ultimately handled. While the cast was quickly broken into separate groups, the movie wasn't at all choppy and moved well between the different storylines.  A must-have for all Stargate SG-1 fans.

It's great for holding keys and other small items if you don't want to take a big diaper bag with you on quick trips into stores and such.  I can also keep it on the stroller when I fold it, which is great - I don't have to keep putting it on and taking it off.  Great buy for the money!!
B0010VD7EO|4.0|Trying to define the genre of this album is irresponsible.  After all, they set out to create entertaining music with no regard to respecting a musical style.  And they sure have succeeded.  By mixing the sophisticated instrumentation and arrangements of modern pop, and infusing it with percussive and guitar sounds more akin to rock, MGMT have achieved a refreshing combination that will keep your feet bopping, and your arms rocking.  Not every track here achieves the particular significance of mixing genres successfully, so some fans might be disappointed by what seems a calculated effort to broaden their commercial appeal, however, whether you are a techno, dance, pop, rock, a Justin Timberlake or Nine Inch Nails fan you will appreciate the ingeniousness that MGMT have put into this album.
B0002I831S|5.0|What I like with my DVD's is English Captions and the ability to skip forward through the video in segments to get to where I was before I had to turn it off.  These DVD's do this and more.  I liked the movie maker's comments that are optional with some of the episodes.  And I really liked Rodenberry telling his story of how Star Trek started.  I liked the addition of each star in the movie talking to the viewer in a separate section of the video.

1423101464|4.0|This is the 4th installment of the series and to me it was as engrossing as the first. Admittedly, I had to read the first 20 pages or so before I finally got into the story but after that I was pulled into the story and couldn't put the book down till I finished. Filled with just as many interesting characters as the previous books in the series, I feel that Riordan has done an excellent job in continuing the story line and yet leaving readers wanting more.
B0010VD7EO|4.0|Should a band stick to traditionalist tendencies to sell records? MGMT forces you to question that concept, and traditionalist songwriting throughout the ten songs on this disc. I am a big fan of genre blending and a willingness to explore the functionality of sound. So it can come of no surprise that the MGMT record, in that regard, fits that criteria.<br /><br />A multitude of genres permeate the record: electro-funk, [[ASIN:B00001OH7W Low]] era psychadelia, even Flaming Lips pop are expertly woven together. This is no small feat, and making it unify, aurally, is the hardest thing to do. It appears that producer Dave Friedman and MGMT are a perfect fit, and even if that is not true, the results sure appear that way. Opening track \\"Time to Pretend\\" sweeps together fills a full spectrum of sound, a trick that only a fine producer (Dave Friedman, of [[ASIN:B00000BKI4 Deserter's Songs]] fame) could do. Friedman's hands are all over this record: taking sheets of synth and turning them into [[ASIN:B000002LRJ Loveless]]-esque walls of sound. \\"The Youth\\" may reek of Bowie (what doesn't now adays), but the minimalist songwriting is elevated by the orchestration of sounds, so conceptualized and crafted that it is hard not to resist.<br /><br />With all this talk of blending, mashing, and fusing of sound, the songwriting seems under appreciated. Overall, these are well crafted songs, pop oriented in a variety of genres. Combined with a smart producer, MGMT manages to put out one of the most coherent releases that, while psychedelic in its heart, are easy to grasp by Joe Music Listener. The progressions make sense, but the sound used to get there is where the real imagination happens. I recommend.
B000PTYPAC|4.0|I was skeptical about this cd because I'm normally not into this type of music but I impressed after listening to it. It's not something I'd listen to everyday but it is certainly catchy. Not only is Haley nice to look at but she's got a nice voice too.
B0015D3Z4O|1.0|What a mistake! I should have known from the flat, cliched, and plainly unattractive cover this would be bad. Terrible production, fake sounding ( or maybe they were fake) drums, her vocals were mixed as if in a distant tunnel with those gdawful drums beating the life out of the mix. Cliched and dull lyrics.<br />And Madonna herself- I will give her credit, her voice was good but she seemed depressed and lifeless actually. No pizazz or charisma. As if she was going thru the motions knowing she would make even more money than any human really needs, and doing \\"sigh\\" one more set of pictures showing her as \\"That madly sexual creature everyone expects\\". She has a great body, she can dance as we all know, but that was the ugliest outfit of all time.  (I am all for any and all women being creative and beautiful and sexual no matter their ( our) ages, and maybe Madonna thinks she looks great and sexy. To each their own but to ME, I shoulda known. )<br /><br />Update 2/21/2009:<br />Well, I have to give Ms Madonna a huge bow... I just watched her documentary [..]  about the poverty stricken Malawi in Africa.  I give Madonna so much credit for using her wealth in such a positive way to help the people, and now I am glad I bought this CD -it seems she is using her profits in such an amazing way. There are  too many overpaid celebrities who seem to care only about their fame, and Madonna used to come across like that. Now? I think she is blossoming into a compassionate human who is trying to make the world a better place.
B000VNMMQG|4.0|Ioan Gruffudd does an excellent job as William Wilberforce. Personally I thought he was magnificent as \\"Captain Horatio Hornblower\\" so no great surprise to me he would handle this role so well. Fans of \\"Amistad\\" will find this movie takes a different approach at showing us the changing position of the United Kingdom on slavery. Here we see the interaction of the English Ministry and how they enact laws. We get to see how Wilberforce was closely tied to the Prime Minister of the time. Although the time line may jump a little it still gives a good picture of his adult life and his battles in and out of court including those with his health. We see all those that impacted his life. I was impressed by the performances of the reformed slaver captain that became a minister, played by Albert Finney, that wrote the song \\"Amazing Grace, and the abolishionists including a former slave that had been a king in Africa. A very well done movie and I recommend it to the whole family. Great quality DVD with good replayability.
B0000AGWJ7|4.0|this is their best album along with their first album it's sucks they aren't like this anymore but m shadows made it clear that the first two albums were gonna be half screaming and half singing,and the next two just singing.Look it's not real metal altough i called the drummer real metal,but it's still great heavy music.This guys can really play i mean they really are good even tough i hate their new stuff except some few songs.Im gonna say what most people say \\"if you are a true a7x fan than get their old stuff\\"i just think this sounds great,and what do you mean this is emo metal they said they just play METAL!
B0007MWZEK|4.0|I've had this product for 5.5 months now.  I use it everynight to clean the kitty litter and shed fur in a bathroom with linoleum.  I love the way it maneuvers so easily around things.      We have had to clean the brushes with the supplied tool once due to cat hair wrapping around it.    The only improvement would be to some how make the dust/dirt tray bigger.
0060254920|5.0|One of the best kids books in my opinion. I got this and some 'monster slippers' as a gift for friends kids. Everyone should own a copy and read them (if not to their kids than to themselves!).
B0010VD7EO|4.0|I had no idea what to expect when I selected this, and the naked men on the cover only led me to wonder what I was getting myself into.  And really, their naked form is about all I know about the band members.  I don't know what instruments they play, who sings what... the liner notes don't seem to indicate much, the lyrics are in handwriting and difficult to read, and you really have to listen to pick up the lyrics at all.    And it's just as well, because I can focus on the music without bias, and in doing so, I've found something well worth keeping on the iPod.    I've heard it described as New-Psychedelic.  I suppose that's as good a description as any, though it does sound like good old rock to me.    There is an eclectic mix of instruments, though--guitars, percussion, keyboards.  This is pleasant.  It is almost a kinder sort of Nine Inch Nails.      One of the best things I can say about this album is it's quite different from what you are probably familiar with.  Maybe it can jog you out of the radio stereotype.    Recommended.
0452289963|5.0|This book can coincide with any religon, it is a book about truths, things that have been told for centuries, even by our Lord Jesus Christ himself.  IT puts everything together into perspective.  Excellent choice of reading!
B00004W5A6|5.0|Gotta admit, definitely better than the regular or remastered cd.  I'm able to pick up a little better what his hand is doing as it crosses  strings. His ability to use all of his hands (fingers, palms) to drive rhythm and timing was just exceptional. Never did get a chance to see this man play.    Still looking for the other SACD version of \\"Couldn't stand the Weather\\". Not all stereo sacds provide enough there to improve on the regular cd.    Best SACD stereo mix bought to date is the \\"Dances with Wolves\\" soundtrack.      That said, peace SRV
B001437DMA|2.0|This is a pretty mundane recording from Satch - nothing too interesting here.  It's mostly listenable, but none of the tracks stand out either.
B0015AARJI|3.0|Dual Shock 3 looks more exciting but the only problem that there isn't enough tittles which supports Dual Shock 3. However, the release of Metal Gear Solid 4 will boost up Dual Shock 3 and will give it more credits.
B0018RBN8C|2.0|Evidently some music industry executive has decided that this album is going to be the Next Big Thing in music, because of the amazing advertising ... free song video download from iTunes using redeemable cards at Starbucks, ads on prominent webpages (possibly the way you got to this webpage), etc.<br /><br />This would be necessary as the music won't sell itself on your own, unless you're looking for the latest in music fashion or bubblegum sounds.  It's empty.  Overused pop music hooks twisted around and sold again ... annoying, screeching vocals ... the usual vapid lyrics.  It's just so boring.  Any of the last ten contestants on American Idol could have done better.
076781326X|5.0|I'd forgotten how good the songs were.  I remembered nearly every one.  Ron Moody is a force of nature and Billy Wilde is a splendid little Artful Dodger.  Oliver Reed as Sykes is also excellent.  Highly recommended for kids and grownups alike.
B000ULQV0W|5.0|I listened to the soundtrack before I saw the movie and I thought it was great. However when I saw the movie, I was amazed how delicately the soundtrack was chosen. After that moment, the soundtrack takes me through a 30 minute journey.    The songs have inspiring lyrics and great melody. As a Pearl Jam fan, I think it makes you realize the great voice that their frontman has. Fully recommend.
B0010VD7EO|4.0|These guys mimic several of my favorite groups: Scissor Sisters, Guns 'n' Roses, !!!, Rolling Stones, and Pink Floyd. Each song seemed to be have a different style such that you strain to figure out who they sound like in each one. This works nicely for MGMT. They're disco meets late 60s rock. Despite each of their songs mimicking a different group, they do have a sound of their own. Amongst the disco rock, there's also a peaceful haunting stillness that comes through in many of their songs.<br /><br />The lyrics to the first song are rather drug-heavy, and the lyrics to subsequent songs probably only make sense only if you're under the influence. I didn't think they were very \\"oracular\\" in nature unless you mean that the lyrics were obscure rather than wise. However, the title is still a fun title. I wouldn't say that lyrics are their strength; their strength is definitely their music.<br /><br />I want to see how this band grows into its own style in the future. At least 2 of the songs get stuck in my head after just a few listens. While it is the best new album I've heard this year so far, I can't give it 5 stars because I think they WILL have a 5 star album in the future and that this isn't quite it yet. I'll be looking forward to their next album.
B0010VD7EO|5.0|MGMT seem to thrive off of the utterly disgusting nature of this post 'Kid-A' world where everyone an their mother seems to be pushing to become the next \\"quirky\\" electro infused indie star. 'Oracular Spectacular' is every be as arrogant as the album title implies, with good reason mind you, the opening track of this glitchy pop masterpiece immediately screams \\"repeat\\" and each subsiquent song slowly grows like a California wild fire until you end up engulfed in it's simplistic beauty.
0452289963|3.0|I haven't found my life's purpose--except maybe to go live in a cave so that my big ego doesn't further ruin anyone else's life or my own.  Isn't that my ego taking over?  Yes! This book makes me feel like a big wart, like I shouldn't have been born so I could have spared the world from my being.  I am having a hard time getting though it.  But other people think it's fantastic.  I just hasn't been earth-moving for me.
B000VNMMQG|5.0|Amazing Grace is an outstanding story of perseverance.  Highly recommended for the whole family.    The DVD arrived in perfect condition.  I am very satisfied with the service.
B0013BNY2Q|4.0|I own every REM album, including this one. Most reviews that I have read have been good but I'm frustrated by the implication that REM is back. I think they never lost it. Reveal was a real dud for me, and Monster is also at the bottom end of their catalog for me. However, I actually dug Around the Sun so I didn't see Accelerate as some massive comeback or step up.<br /><br />That said, Accelerate is a very good REM album. Hey, there's only so much they can keep coming up with after all these years, but the vigor on this album is apparent. The songs are frequently political, and biting. The high speed of the album is actually a treat, and as a listener it feels like running through images and thoughts at a great pace. Supposedly, the production on this was pretty quick, too, and there are a couple of songs near the end that are lacking, such as Sing for the Submarine which could have used some judicial editing, and Horse to Water which is basically filler.<br /><br />The rest, however, is killer, and the album really shines in the middle with Accelerate, Until the Day is Done, and Mr. Richards.
B0013XS8A2|5.0|Mike Oldfield fans will readily recognize Tubular Bells side one in this classical music style composition. This is not, however, the orchestral version of Tubular Bells which we have already heard. It is a variation on the theme blending classical music with the modern guitar and the variety of instuments Mike Oldfield is known for. Fans of classical music will find something new and interesting here. Fans of Mike Oldfield will enjoy hearing Mike Oldfiled with a variation on the familiar theme in a new genre. Mike Oldfield says in his liner notes that he believes that this is the music that moves the spheres of the universe. I believe he is sincere as listeners will hear the familar haunting theme that runs through almost all of his music.
B0013POLS8|4.0|sure it's a treat to the ears, especially when it comes to songs like \\"fly like a bird\\" and \\"don't forget about us\\". the performance is stunning as always.    however watching a barely-covered fat woman walking around and singing is absolutely not a treat. I just wished she put more clothes on. it's fine if she has a body shown in music videos and on CD covers, but she hasn't.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I love Jillian and wish, she'd be my personal trainer!<br />Her '30 Day Shred' workout is fun and quick. It has 3 levels, 1 being the easiest yet still tough for a beginner. (That being said, I'm intermediate/advanced and some exercises on level 1 still 'kill' me with my 5 & 8 lbs weights!)<br />Each level is 20 mins with a quick warm-up and cool-down. Jillian is encouraging and guides you through 3 circuits each containing cardio, strength and abs.<br /><br />20 minutes seems to be a bit too short for me personally, I mostly combine at least 2 workouts and do them back to back in order to get a bit longer workout. But if I'm pressed for time, it's wonderful of having the option to only do 1 level on its own and get a nice quick workout in.
B000O599WG|5.0|...I like this movie so much, but it's fun and it has John Wayne.  They all looked like they were having a good time.
B0002Y4T92|3.0|Disc 01 is missing. The box came in with 2 Disc 02. I am still trying to figure out how this could have happened. The sealed item was delivered to my hotel address in Las Vegas. I was there on a visit when I placed the order. I opened the package when I got back to my home in Pakistan and got this surprise.  I did not expect this from Amazon.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I am just starting my workout regimen, and I purchased this DVD.  This is not for beginners!  It will definitely be a milestone in my workout when I can complete this DVD.  However, I am looking forward to that day.  I definitely recommend it, but maybe if you're already on a program and need to change it up.
B000VNMMQG|5.0|Everyone should see this film.  It made me want to go out and fight injustice.  I think this is the reason God gave us movies, so that men and women of great talent could tell inspiring stories like this one.  The script was complex and thought provoking, with moments of incredible emotion.  The whole thing was a little over-dramatic, I must admit, but this is good storytelling, not a documentary film.<br /><br />Maybe not everyone should see this film.  Small children will be disturbed by graphic descriptions of slavery and some frightening scenes of slave children working in a sugar refinery.  But anyone old enough to face the world's injustices ought to see this film. It is one of those rare films that will change your life.
1878424777|5.0|I've read the book before, and bought the CDs because I wanted to listen to them on the way in to work. It's a great way to start the day and keep the principles of the book in the forefront of my mind. The narration is fairly well done, and the pace is just right.
B0000DZ3EN|5.0|As a girl, I grew up loving the Wizard of Oz.  Either this version, or the MGM grand technicolor extravaganza.  Both versions frightened and delighted me.<br /><br />But now, things have changed.  I still enjoy watching both, but I appreciate this film so much more.  The flying monkeys no longer torment me the way the wheelers still do.  I still like both Dorothys, but I realize I have always cheered on Fairuza Balk, while I never cheered for Judy Garland.  And although the Wicked Witch of the West is still a great character, how can she challenge the head shifting Mombi?<br /><br />This live action version is darker and more of a literal translation of the books.  I appreciate this version so much more for those reasons.<br /><br />I highly recommend this film--especially for children with wild imaginations!
0061091480|5.0|This is the book you've been looking for.    I'm not gonna yammer on and on about why you should get this book, but I will tell you that this has helped me drastically or more so than any other self-help book out there when it comes to not needing or seeking the approval of others. It also helped me prioritize my life, the way I want it.    So easy to read, I loved it. I can control my anxiety much better now.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I want to start by saying that it is impossible for me to lose weight, but not for lack of trying. i have tried so many workouts, but my schedule does not make room for working out. I didn't start working out the day I got this. Slacker, I know. The workouts are tough, and they seemed to make me sweat a lot more than longer workouts I've tried. Anyway, after working out 2 weeks, I'd actually lost almost 8 lbs. I'll stick with it. This one's a keeper. Anyone can find 20 minutes a day. If I can, you can.
0316926345|5.0|As someone very interested in the field of Queer Theory, I was pleasantly surprised to pick up this book and discover such fascinating love relationships in the life of Charlie Ryder. Set between the two World Wars, Brideshead Revisited follows the life of Charlie Ryder and his dealings (and romances) with members of the Flyte family. Waugh has both a beautiful way with words and a scathing, satirical wit. He seems to revere and scorn the British aristocracy. Charlie is in love with the beautiful but highly eccentric/flamboyant Sebastian, and later moves on to the sister who bears an uncanny resemblance to her brother. Though I have never heard the book mentioned in a Queer Theory course, it would certainly be a fitting novel in which to apply ideas of queer performativity etc.<br />Through this book, I have become a big fan of Waugh and look forward to reading more of his many works.<br />For those interested in visual representations of classic novels, there is also a miniseries (available on Netflix) of the same title which actually got the book re-recognized in the early 1980s. It is quite good--Jeremy Irons plays Charlie Ryder in his first screen role ever.
B0000TG9E2|5.0|I was so happy to find this film on DVD!  I always loved Alice in Wonderland as a kid, but now it is even better.<br /><br />The quality of the DVD is amazing (although I would expect nothing less from Disney).  The colors are so crisp and bright.  The sound seems to even be a better quality, too.<br /><br />But the story is still the same masterpiece I fell in love with as a child.<br /><br />And the little extras contained on the second disc are perfect! \\"Thru the looking glass\\" has to be one of the most memorable Mickey cartoons.  Get your hands on a copy of this one and enjoy it!
B00008PW2D|5.0|This product seemed like it took a long time to be shipped to me, but it was still within the time frame. Usually the product seems to get to me faster, even with the lowest priced shipping. Otherwise, no problems
B000001FA4|1.0|U2 are not and will not ever be a powerhouse.  Maybe a pop powerhouse.
159562015X|5.0|I am the manager of a large Salon/Day Spa and we purchased a copy of this book for each of our employees.  It is helping us learn how to manage each person based on their personality strengths rather than their weaknesses.  They are also having a great time learning about each other in a different way.  We all have a better understanding of each other.  I would highly recommend this book.
0452289963|5.0|Get ready to be enlightened! When I bought this book I was a little skeptical. I believed a book could not tell you who you are or who to be or how to be. And I believed that anyone who tried to tell you who you should be was just arrogant and self serving. But I bought this book anyway as part of a book club selection. What I found was that Eckart Tolle never once tells you what to do, instead, I was introduced to a concept I hadn't previously considered... presence. There's nothing to do, no act to follow, just be present to the moment. And just by becoming aware of the present moment, I was able to let go of past pains and resentments and insecurities in my life. Just by being, and not focusing on doing, I was able to unlock a new deeper dimension of my being. I was also able to realize that I am not my circumstances, or my mind, or the many roles I play. Instead, I am the awareness behind it all. This book is beautifully written and answers many question you might have. A New Earth has strengthened my faith and brought so much gratitude and appreciation into my life...amazing book!
B000I5X81K|2.0|I own Groban's first two albums and really like them, but this album leaves me cold.  The song selection doesn't show off his vocal talent; many of the songs are bland, with childish or poor lyrics.  His Spanish pronunciation is a bit off in this one, too.  As other reviewers have mentioned, the passion of his previous music is simply gone.  What happened, Josh?    The only songs in this new style that hold a hint of interest are \\"In Her Eyes\\" and \\"Now Or Never\\" (written by the talented Imogen Heap).  I'm wishing I hadn't paid full price for two good songs.  Word of advice:  Even if you like Groban, check this one out from the library or borrow a copy.  Listen to the full CD BEFORE you buy.
B00000DFSK|1.0|Who the hell is the kid on half of their lame album covers.  Bono is a retard, U2 sucks, and the songs on this album proves it and shows how \\"rock\\" they are.
0307387178|5.0|I ordewr the book after seeing the movie. It arrived in perfect condition and I enjoyed the book as much as the movie.
0451457994|3.0|I don't know that I would classify Clark as a creator of great fiction; as mentioned in other reviews, the \\"human equation\\" in his works is largely missing. Clark excels and creating vivid descriptions of technology and alien grandeur, but his books are a bit lifeless at they have almost no character developement or interesting dialog.     I've read most of his books, and find he is a great alternative in those times I would find myself reaching for an atlas or a National Geographic. Honestly, I think AC Clarke is one of those sacred cow authors--praised by those who think it raises their intellectual profile, and read mainly when bored by those who can see that the emperor, while not entirely naked, could do with more than a loincloth.

B000P12LWY|4.0|What Showtime's historical drama The Tudors lacks in historical accuracy, it more than makes up for with it's wonderful production design and well chosen cast.  Jonathan Rhys Meyers stars as King Henry VIII, whose sexual appetites are only matched by his desire for power and to ultimately get his way.  The only person in his court that matches his desire for power is his closest advisor, Cardinal Wolsey (Sam Neill), who Henry's subordinates Brandon (Henry Cavill), Norfolk (Henry Czerny), and George Boleyn (Nick Dunning) seek to remove from power.  Involved in their plans are Boleyn's daughters, specifically Anne (Natalie Dormer) who catches Henry's eye and becomes a thorn in the side of Henry's wife Katherine (Maria Doyle Kennedy).  The performances are great, the production is grand, and as a whole, The Tudors is thoroughly entertaining and engrossing.  It lacks the epic feel that say, HBO's Rome, manages to weave; but the potential here is high for the show to become something special indeed.  All in all, if you're looking for pure historical accuracy, you won't find it with The Tudors, but instead you will find an entertaining historical drama that delivers the goods.
B00154GEFU|3.0|In my opinion is seems like this alblum was rushed a bit - too much borrowing from previous tunes and some of the 80's sounding keyboards sound like, well, 80's (could have lived without that). Also, I know John went through alot lattely and I'm glad that he's fine but it seems to me that he spends too much time writing about the joys of being alive, sounds more like motivational musicthen the cliche driven ASIA classics of the past. I guess the biggest disappointment for me was that after seeing them live (and they where excellent and so are the Asia live CDs and DVDs) the performances on this CD do not live up to their live performances. Again, my biggest disappoint was that this CD seemed rushed. Well, hope they spend more time on the next CD which may be a year out since Steve is touring with YES this summer (hopefully YES will release a new CD to follow the tour).
0307346617|5.0|Warning.. if you read or listen to audio of this book, you may accidentally think all that is written really happened! That is how well this is all written and 'documented'. A very good edition to any undead lovers collection.
B0016HNOXQ|2.0|As you have probably figured out, Third is a radical departure for Portishead. It is a complete change in sound. Gone are the lazy beats, samples, and admittedly tepid scratching that dominated their first two albums, replaced with industrial sounds and loose guitar & drum arrangements.     For the most part the album is jarring and dissonant. Gibbons' voice is frequently at odds with the music, unlike the old days when it was an eery compliment. It doesn't work well in part and not at all in whole and is, at the end, a disappointing effort.    'Silence' is unremarkable. 'Hunter' sounds like Mazzy Star. 'Nylon Smile' starts okay, but I suspect I mostly like it because it sounds like a bossa nova. 'The Rip' is just boring. 'Plastic' is actually my favorite song on the album, but that's because it's the closest to the old Portishead sound. 'We Carry On' starts out interesting but drones on for too long.     'Deep Water' deserves special recognition for being spectacularly dreadful. Adrian Utley has loudly expressed his hatred for this song, and it amazes me that anybody actually tries to defend it. It's Beth singing scratchily and off-key over a strumming ukelele. To anybody who pretends to like this song: we know you're faking. The only positive thing about the track is that it sounds hilariously like Bernadette Peters singing 'Tonight You Belong to Me' in 'The Jerk'. Horrible.    'Machine Gun' was the first single. I'm not a fan. A small repeating set of machine-gun-ish beat loops played over and over. 'Small' is a meandering guitar instrumental backing Beth singing about sad things. 'Magic Doors' is a weird start-and-stop drum sample (with cowbell!). Beth sings about sad things some more but never comes near the beat. 'Threads' is 'Small' with meandering drums added.    The album never builds any tension. There are none of the operatic moments of the first two albums, no great hooks.     I'm not going to have the argument about 'should an artist ever change or not'. The fact is that people like bands because they like that band's sound. Every band you like, you like for their distinct sound. So it's understandable why many fans are disappointed by this weird departure.     Some of the changes you can even explain away. Nobody scratches anymore, and to be fair the scratches in Portishead's music were mostly embarrassing. I wouldn't really expect Barrow to bring back the Theramin, and you can only sample \\"Ike's Rap\\" so many times.     But that's not even the main issue. It's not that Portishead changed. It's that many people don't like their new sound. And if you read anything Geoff Barrow has had to say in the past 20 years, you'll know why.     Barrow always hated Portishead's sound (at least, that's what he says). He went through years of screaming and crying about being labeled 'trip-hop', and saying how he doesn't want to be 'corporate background music'. He and Mark Ronson have a well-publicized fued in which Barrow keeps bagging on Ronson's commerciality.     Barrow is a tortured artiste. I guess it's easy when you live in a nice house your crap commercial music bought for you. I'm not judging him, it's his life and so forth. But understand that the guy never wanted to make the music that most Portishead fans like. This is the music Barrow wants to make, largely I think because he believes if people reject it, he's accomplished something great. The only thing I can hope is that enough people buy this ill-advised album so Barrow will hate it too, and pull a 180. But I imagine for most Portishead fans this album will just be a disappointment.
0765318741|5.0|Don't be fooled by the cover. A short story in this book inspired the movie with Will Smith, but it is NOT the same story as the movie. The movie changed the story a lot. Both are very good. There are many other short stories in this book as well.
0061245097|4.0|What can I say - I liked the first one and this one didn't disappoint.      Overall it was a tight engaging story like the first, with likeable characters, in particular the secondary characters.  I give it a 4 for a few weaknesses - for one I was a little weirded out by Tate (Dont' want to spoil so I'll leave it there) and also by the slight potential I smelled for an LKH Haremfest in the future.  I'm not saying it seemed like it was going there, but it COULD, and lets face it - that didn't work out so great for LKH.    There were also occasionally phrases that seemed slightly out of place -- I think this was due to the fact that I honestly think it could have been longer and the editor/publisher hacked it down to an acceptable length for the genre.  I personally would rather read another hundred pages and get a lusher book, but I realize that authors don't have a lot of control over it - if the publisher says that urban fantasy only sells if its under X pages then they'll slash it til its under X pages.  a little more exposition, a little more description could have gone a long way here.
B000ASATZ8|5.0|just a quick note, after reading previous reviews, i do have to agree that the original 'tremors' was indeed the best...but i have to strongly disagree about #4 being the weakest...  i really loved #4, and i thought they did a great job, considering the onslaught of bad 'prequels' that have left the gate...(\\"...paging mr. lucas...mr. george lucas...\\")...  the second one was a typical sequel...good, not great...  #3 i could live without...once you start initiating the hunt, it becomes your own bloody fault...  but stick around for #4...it's definitely worth it...
0446402389|5.0|Best book I have read for ages. Well done on a great first novel. I recommend this to anyone.
B000MGB6M8|4.0|My husband and I saw this movie in the theater. We both remember the movie being longer. Is this a cut version? The scene in the beginning with the dancing in the rain is super short on this DVD as is the scene with the angry sex. We were disappointed by that and no explanation on the box. Usually you get the \\"director's cut\\" longer version on DVD than in the theater. What gives? Quality was great. A fun movie.
0312379293|5.0|I don't like British authors.  I think they get paid by the word.  But this story is fun.  Throughout the book things turn out well, rather than lots of misery resolved in the last few pages.  It's a feel-good book.
0452289963|5.0|One of the passages in this book that really resonated for me was about how it is possible to keep one's state of well being regardless of whether the present circumstances are good or bad.  In other words, it is not necessary to lose your well being if life shows up as challenging or upsetting in some way.  It is equally not necessary to lose your well being if things show up the way you prefer.  He explains that it is an old Zen idea that a person can maintain well being regardless of circumstances - and that your preferences don't need to determine how you 'feel' about a situation.  I also highly recommend authors Ariel and Shya Kane. Their books [[ASIN:1888043180 Being Here: Modern Day Tales of Enlightenment]] and [[ASIN:1888043148 How To Create a Magical Relationship]] are exceptional.  They are highly readable and offer a fantastic approach to ideas like living in the moment and maintaining well being in your everyday life. Check them out!  I have the most magical relationship because of them - the ideas they present are so right on, and so unexpected.
0618918248|5.0|For an author with open contempt towards religion, one would expect 'The God Delusion' to preach to the Atheist choir by degrading religion and dismissing it as pure fantasy.<br /><br />To a degree Dawkins does just that but he shows restraint and approaches the topic from a purely scientific standpoint. In addition to explaining the probability (and lack there of) of a creator he covers social issues involving religion as well as the scripture itself.<br /><br />At one point in my reading of 'The God Delusion' I went to my Bible and read the referenced sections for myself because I just couldn't believe Dawkins claims of incest, gang rape, and genocide. Of course, these passages were in the Bible and at that point (after putting down Dawkins book to re-read the Bible, which I had not read since I was 12 years old), the points Dawkins is trying to make start to become a sort of clarity for me.<br /><br />I'd hate to say the book is revolutionary, but for me that's essentially what it was.
B00006DEF9|5.0|Singin' In the Rain is without a doubt the best musical ever made, with one of the best musical actors of the time ever, Gene Kelly. It's a great love story, and has an overall great story in general. It's a great movie about Hollywood during the transition from silent to talking pictures and a popular actor who is having trouble with the transition, he meets a girl and they fall in love. It is a fun movie for everyone and has wonderful music, I would recommend it to anyone.
B00005Q4CS|4.0|i watched this movie back when it first came out and didn't really get it.  i recently re watched it and found it to be extremely thought provoking and true to life.  this is a true glimpse into the life of a world most don't know.  one thing that really grabbed me the second time is how the cycle of addiction really is a family problem.  not for the faint of heart but a great movie if you want to see something that will make you think.
B000RZIGSG|5.0|Yes, I am a child of the 80's, so I am partial to this movie along with many other 80's movies as well, but I will say that this movie is one of the most memorable movies of it's time, and has stood the test of time well.   It is still popular today with people of all ages.    Jennifer Beals was HOT! Every guy I knew dreamed of being with her, and she made her mark with this movie.    I totally recommend this movie to anyone, and it is truly one of the great movies.   People still talk about it today!!!  The dance scene at the end was incredible!!!
B0014CDKVY|4.0|I went into this movie with mixed feelings. I am a big fan of the original Charlton Heston version [[ASIN:B000VAHR14 The Omega Man [Blu-ray]]] And I am an even bigger fan of the book [[ASIN:B000B9J4EI I Am Legend]]<br /><br />If you just take it as a movie it is an average movie and most of the stuff was acceptable hollywood fun. But there are two things about this movie that make it just a little bit special:<br /><br />Peppered through Will Smith's Mansion are some actual Van Gogh Paintings. I mean the real thing. I read that they actually got to use the real ones in the movie. The camera, director, actors, don't focus on the paintings. They are just there - and they are absolutely magnificent. You can't help but be drawn to them.<br /><br />And they are there in the movie for a reason. The movie is all about the potential end of humanity and the pictures say (without uttering a word) that humanity, is sometimes capable of a beauty that goes beyond words. Breathtaking.<br /><br />Also, Will Smith launches into a little soliloquy about Bob Marley that comes very close to the same effect. It will choke you up even if you never heard a single Bob Marley song.<br /><br />Because they are so different it is almost a contradiction to use Bob Marley and Vincent Van Gogh in the same movie as examples but that is the beauty of humanity.
B000FZETIO|1.0|Can't even watch it as it was made in Mexico it doesn't work in any DVD players.  Would have been great if i've was told that before i bought it.
B00004VVPR|5.0|Having remembered fondly the other Buck Rogers movie from the late 70s, if I recall right, I had always wanted to see this one.<br /><br />I wasn't disappointed. Filled with dramatic and improved special effects (it was now several years from the first Star Wars movie), spectacular cinematography, absolutely fabulous costumes, beautifully done sets, and a stellar cast, this movie delivers on all counts. I suspect just their costume budget was more than the original Star Wars movie.<br /><br />The plot is well known, so I won't comment there. But the entire cast looks like they're having a grand time with this campy, fun-filled, futuristic romp. Brian Blessed, who plays Vultan, the king of the Hawkmen, looks like he's having the time of his life. In fact, while watching the movie I reflected that I couldn't ever recall seeing an actor having such an uproarious, rip-snorting good time playing a role. He is absolutely beside himself with the pleasure of playing that part,  and I just found out why after doing a little research on the IMDB site. Here's an except from the page there:<br /><br />\\"As a child he and his friends used to play at Flash Gordon, inspired by the Buster Crabbe TV serials. In these childhood games Brian would always play Vultan, leader of the Hawkmen. In the 1980 film Flash Gordon he played the same role as he had in childhood.\\"<br /><br />No wonder Brian is having such a good time. :-) It's amazing that he got to play the role of his favorite character in the big screen movie. Good for Brian, who has always been one of my favorite actors. What an amazing coincidence and stroke of good luck for Brian.<br /><br />All the actors are great too, and Max von Sydow is perfect as the evil Ming. But everyone else in the cast is superb also, including the ones I didn't know as well, and I only knew Timothy Dalton from his James Bond roles.<br /><br />Overall, a fun movie that more than does justice to the original concept.
B0011KQSZ4|4.0|This is a very funny, irreverent, quirky black comedy.  The various diverse people gathering for a funeral make for great characters, some lovable some not.  This is a laugh out loud, good belly laugh movie highly recommended.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|We loved this series, and were astonished to find it had been cancelled after such a brief run.  Well-written, witty, with stories you want to keep following, it's a winner all around.  Felt the same way about Stargate's first few seasons.  Battlestar Gallactica?  We watch it because there's nothing else to watch.  But this is LIGHTYEARS better entertainment. Constantly losing, dying out, never getting any closer to any reasonable hope of survival, Gallactica can get really aggravating.  You'd think they'd all get bored enough to just run into a fracking star or something equally final.  Never got that loser mentality on Firefly!  To the contrary, these people maintain hope and determination and integrity throughout the series and bring you right along with them.  Buy Serenity, too.  Good stuff.
B000OV170W|4.0|I normally read nonfiction buy this was a gift so I gave it a read.  I couldn't put the book down.  The story was well written.  I could see this happening (in fact have seen the basic part of the story just not the lawsuit). It pulls at the heartstrings and makes you think what you would do if EVER in such a situation.  It did jump around a bit but that didn't matter to the story.
0743270754|5.0|This is a brilliant account of Abraham Lincoln, his cabinet, and their times. It is commodious in scope, unfailingly insightful, lucid, poignant, and engaging. Washington excelled in courage and honour; Lincoln added honesty, humility, humor, and wisdom.
B00003CX9E|1.0|Citizen Kane is not the greatest film of all time. How it garnered that reputation is far beyond me. This film is often prided on its technical innovations. The lighting, the cinematography, the editing is all done exeptionally. Lovers of the film resort to saying things like that, because the actual content of the film is banal and uninspired. Charles Foster Kane is not an interesting character. Through Well's film we learn nothing of Kane, he is one dimensional. This film is completely shallow, as if no emotion went into making it. It is mechanical, fails to make me think or question what I thought to be true. It fails as a character study and as an examination of human behavior. For a true work of art, by a true artist (as opposed to merely a Hollywood personality like Wells), watch City Lights instead. Citizen Kane is just empty.
B000WGWQG8|5.0|There is much to argue with in HBO's interpretation of David McCullough's Pulitzer Prize winning masterwork - timelines, cinematography and perhaps some casting choices. However, these \\"technical\\" issues are really beside the point and do little to undermine the overall power and scope of the entire series. Whatever we think we know of these events through the idealized rote of history, McCullough's baseline brilliantly illuminates the struggle of imperfect men attempting to create \\"perfect\\" government. Throughout the series I was constantly reminded of the old admonition about the grotesque similarities between the making of sausage and legislation.      The core cast (Paul Giammati, Laura Linney, Tom Dellane) is spectacular. Linney in particular powerfully makes the case that without the emotional intelligence of Abigail Adams as counterbalance to her husband's inexhaustable volatility our history might have been very different.     John Adams is time well spent and highly recommended.
B00127RAJY|5.0|The 30-Day Shred is geared toward a beg-intermediate workout.  I bought this video to add to my weekly regime and she does not mess around! This video works on the 3-2-1 work out schedule for 20 mins. 3 mins cardio, 2 mins light weights and 1 min abs/core.  Cardio and that is my weakness and this has strengthened my breathing. She keeps you moving hard for the whole 20 mins, just keep moving to catch your breath. I noticed tightness right away and I love the fact that she does moves completely different from my other dvds.  This is definitely in the every-other-day rotation.  If you are seriously wanting to lose weight or tighten up I recommend using this as I have done, in a rotation with other light weight videos.
B000UX6THK|5.0|I was a big fan when it was on TV, very dissappointed the network morons canceled it...this happens every time there is too much script, guess the majority of the people watching TV only care about explosions, murder and death...feeble brains is my guess.

B00154GEFU|4.0|Same format as previous discs. It's good having all the old band together again. It's worth the $10 to add to a collection.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|Groundbreaking, breathtaking cinematography and arrangement.  My children and I have watched the entire collection with awe and amazement...it is such an incredible way for us to \\"experience\\" many parts of the earth that we may never be able to see.  Masterful!  Worth the investment.
0446402389|2.0|The odd way the author indicates a character is speaking is distracting in the extreme. Instead of going for the tried-and-true quotation mark, he decides to go with an m-dash and italics.  Did the author think quotation marks just weren't up to the job for him? Too old-fashioned? And where in the world was his editor on this choice?<br /><br />Honestly, I think I would have enjoyed the story a lot more if I hadn't been so distracted by this strange choice through the entire book.
B000JU7NCE|3.0|The concert experience from Robert Smith's point of view. Great audio, so-so video. Too many camera shots of Robert's face and torso. Would prefer to see the actual playing of the instruments and more of the crowd's perspective. You really cannot appreciate the lighting effects from this perspective. Additionally, this concert is performed without keyboards, which sonically, leaves the songs less impressive.
006135323X|5.0|This is a wonderfully provocative work.  Most of us insist that we are making logical decisions most of the time, and carefully weighing the options before making a choice or coming to a conclusion. Dan Ariely and his colleagues prove us all wrong!  We are very susceptible to subtle messages that point us toward a direction which has more to do with how we humans are wired rather than to any logical choice. This is must reading for all of us \\"rational thinkers\\".  Would you like a free upgrade with this?
B0014Z4OQG|1.0|I'm just glad I didn't pay to see this movie at the theatre.  The constantly shaking camera work would have given me motion sickness.  The movie would have been semi-OK if they had mixed in some professional production work along with the sickening POV stuff.  SPOILER ALERT:  At the end of the movie we are no closer to finding out what the monster was or where it came from - very disappointing.

B0009KQOME|2.0|It's not an Oscar winning anything, it's just a sexy, fast, fun movie, that looks good, and a good time killer.  It's 5 stars for fun -- not for script or cinematic achievement.<br /><br />I give it a low rating as you are forced to watch several previews before getting to the menu.  It's hard enough to click around on the PSP for movies, and yes, you can continue to attempt to skip them, but we should not have to deal with this annoyance.  It should not even be an option.  I bought the movie.  Just put the damn feature film on the disc, along with relevant features, thats it.
B0013D8LOK|4.0|Stephen Sondheim's wonderful \\"Sweeney Todd\\" gets a superbly creepy and gory treatment from Johnny Depp and Tim Burton.  My knowledge of musicals goes only as far as \\"My Fair Lady,\\" \\"Camelot,\\" and \\"The Sound Of Music,\\" so I will review this particular musical as a fan of Depp, Burton and Helena Bonham Carter, among others in the production.  First of all, Burton sets a dark and gloomy tone for the story as it opens on Todd's return to London.  He has been away for fifteen years in a prison for a crime he did not commit.  When he arrives on the streets, revenge is in his heart.  We also meet a young sailor named Anthony (Jamie Campbell Bower), who will play a key role later in the story.  Todd returns to his barber shop where his family is no more.  He learns from one Mrs. Lovett (Bonham Carter), that his wife has committed suicide and his daughter is being held captive at the home of Judge Turpin (Alan Rickman), who is the source of all of Todd's turmoil.  This sets into motion a brilliant story of revenge, internal struggle, and all-out violence.  Todd and Lovett conspire to get revenge not on the judge alone, but any and every person of high importance.  From vicar to royal, no one is safe.<br /><br />The brilliance of this story is built not on just the music and atmosphere, but on the performances of the actors as well.  Depp is sinister as the wronged Todd.  Bonham Carter plays the longing romantic in love with Todd perfectly.  Rickman and Timothy Spall (Beadle) outdo themselves with their characters.  Young Ed Sanders plays the highly loyal and overprotective Toby and, in my opinion, delivers one of the best performances in the film.  Sacha Baron Cohen (yep, Borat) surprised me with his portrayal of Pirelli, a devious con man out to blackmail Todd.  Also of note is a brief cameo from Anthony Head.<br /><br />There is plenty of blood in this film.  Lots of it.  Tons of it.  Although not as garish as modern zombie films, when the blood flows, it sprays walls, faces, and just about anything within reach.  If you cannot handle gore, you may not want to watch this.  What's bizarre is that in all of this film, only the bright red color of the blood stands apart from the gloominess of the rest of the story.<br /><br />I highly recommend this film to fans of Depp, Bonham Carter, Burton or Rickman.  Even if you've never watched a musical, sit through this one long enough and you'll see that it really is a wonderful, macabre tale.ut anything within reach.

B00151G08Y|5.0|I'm on my 4th or 5th listen right now as I'm writing this.  I heard the album twice yesterday and figured I should wait at least a day so I could hear it fresh again.      After hearing it several times, wow! This album has exceeded my expectations and then some.  After reading various bad reviews I was skeptical and had somewhat less hope, but I loved the sound of Hold Your Colour and figured I'd listen to this one with an open mind.   The songs got me pumped, and the vocals sound mature and accomplished.  It surprises me that so many DnB fans were completely let down with this release.  Pendulum really held onto their sound but instead of duplicating Hold Your Colour decided to try a few new things.    Just buy it, or download it or whatever.  It's worth your time.    Least favorite track at this point - Visions  Favorite track at this point - Show Down
B000UCEJEQ|5.0|It seems that Annie has written a lighter album with Songs....when you compare it to Bare.  I am a very late Annie lennox fan, but I LOVE THIS GAL!!  I really enjoy the new younger girls..Duffy, Coco, Trista Prettyman, BUT I am aging and I can't relate so much with their world experiences so much.  I love Annie because I get what she is experiencing.  I wish more women writers and singers were as honest as her.  I love her writing more than the actual music.  I have really enjoyed recently getting all her albums recently and raging with her in the car, in house, and all over.  Finally my husband came up to me while I was loudly playing \\"Sing\\"...and said..okay not every wants to hear the sisters singing!!!LOL!! Can't wait for her next album!! I am a fan!!!
0307346617|3.0|I understand why so many people loved this book, but it didn't entirely work for me. The central conceit - that the book is a series of interviews with key survivors of the Zombie Wars - is good, but it makes for a very episodic read.<br /><br />In it's effect, the book is more like a collection of short stories than a single coherent narrative. Yes, all the interviews are telling the same \\"story,\\" but the characters and settings never overlap - you get scores of unrelated narrators sharing their own tales  of horror.<br /><br />Thus, there's no build up of suspense or tension over the three-hundred plus pages of this book. Each \\"short story\\" has its own dramatic arc. Some work better than others. But, with rare exception, you could delete any one of the chapters in this book without affecting the others, or, conversely, you could add twenty more chapters without changing the outcome. A lot if it is interesting, but it all feels kind of arbitrary.<br /><br />Lastly, without continuing characters, there's really no one to root for or against. You never get emotionally connected to anyone - the stories can involve you, but they almost never move or inspire or touch you. Compare this with a book like Stephen King's The Stand - which also told dozens of apocalyptic stories, but linked them together in one  coherent narrative with consistent characters, and you'll see how much less emotionally involving Brook's book is.<br /><br />Still, this is a good, gory read. If you like horror, a lot of these stories are morbidly fun with nightmarishly memorable moments. Just keep your expectations low-to-moderate. Max Brooks definitely has talent, and I look forward to reading what he does next.
B000NA2776|1.0|I walked into a restaurant today and \\"Love Today\\" off this album was auto-playing on the jukebox.  Ordinarily I don't pay much attention to jukeboxes, but this song is pretty hard to ignore.  Sensing a Rickroll opportunity that was also a win for the audience, I put a hard-earned 50 cents into the jukebox and fired up \\"Never Gonna Give You Up\\" by Rick Astley.  Normally the first few notes of this are all that's needed to rile up an angry mob, but in this case after having been prepped by Mika they were really into it.  That pretty much sums up how bad this song is, buyer beware.
0783240236|5.0|Modern day movies can never compare to the Great Alfred Hitchcock. This legandary film is Amazing. Any Hithcock fan will totally agree with me.
B00005RHGL|5.0|I could watch this movie every day for a year and still never tire of it. Val Kilmer is fantastic as is Kurt Russell. Michael Biehn as Johnny Ringo dominates every scene he's in and the bar scene with him and Val Kilmer is a great moment where Doc uses his droll humor to diffuse an otherwise deadly situation. This movie is definitely my Huckleberry!

B000PDYVVG|3.0|Being a commercial writer myself, books like this make me wonder if I'm missing something because this book is really not very interesting. It left me feeling that most readers who enjoy such a story must be living a very superficial existence because this is exactly what this story describes, even taking into consideration its lightweight overtures to some vague kind of spiritual dimension working behind the mundane goings on of everyday life. If you're looking to hear about something new and inspirational and exciting I would not recommend that you read eat, pray and love.
0670018651|5.0|This book would be important even if it weren't great. But it is! Most of us who wear fragrance make choices in an information wasteland, absent, until now, consumer reports. Perfume lovers, perfume likers and \\"who me, perfume?\\" people, read it and rise to the next level.    Those who enjoy the visual and performance arts, couture, wines and other pleasures take for granted that critical reviews anchor our understanding and increase our enjoyment of the art. A good movie will get raves and a bad one will be panned.     Turin and Sanchez transform the industry by talking straight about specific scents. Unlike the women's beauty magazine articles that promote a list of scents, all equally wonderful - just choose one based on your sexy, romantic or sporty personality - these authors tell you What It Smells Like.    It is a relief not to be the manufacturer of scents earning these distinctions: \\"short-lived sugary fruity blah in a hilariously cheap blinged-out bottle that looks like a toy designed for a six-year old and made in China...like getting lemon juice in a paper cut...synthetic citrus, green-herbal, and woody-amber horror...rubbing alcohol mixed with Palmolive dishwashing liquid...death by jasmine...like chewing tinfoil while staring at a welding arc...wear it at home exclusively, and tape the windows shut...mercifully, doesn't last.\\"    Praise is more detailed and effusive than the bashings, however, and this is where Turin and Sanchez shine.    My complaints are few in number. I waited too long for this book, having followed Luca Turin and Tania Sanchez in perfume blogs for years and loving Turin's French, and much shorter version of the guide published in 1994. Searching the guide for certain scents I've loved, hated or wondered about, I found them not. Hopefully, Perfumes, The Guide Volume Two is not far behind.    Are they snobs? Yes and no. All talk of subjective perception and interpretation aside, these two know that there is such a thing as \\"good.\\" Quality exists, whence the one to five star ratings. They recognize a place for Elvis on Velvet, but want better for you. Despite occasionally savage criticism - some sins of perfumery are unforgivable to Turin and Sanchez - the playful spirit prevails in the end.    Luca Turin and Tania Sanchez are brilliant, both masters of the notes and the meaning of scent. They serve up a reader-friendly meal of chemistry, fashion, culture and language with a generous helping of mischief.
B00192IOBA|5.0|This album is superb.  Jason always gives us the highest quality music - and this is exciting, heartfelt, exhilirating music.  And the songs are the full spectrum of styles and sounds, and Jason's voice pulls you through and around as only he can do.  Every song is a delight.  He is a sublime songwriter and your ears just thrill at his singing and his energy.     Don't miss outt on the entire album.  Each song is a gem. Jason is absolutely mind-blowing artist - so glad I have this new collection.
B0014I4KIK|2.0|Duffy does have a lovely voice and I especially like Mercy, which was the basis on which I preordered this CD, via a local radio station. But I was very disappointed with the rest of the album. The other songs are forgettable, roll into each other, and quite frankly bored me. I do believe she has alot of potential and a great voice but her song choices really need to be looked at.
1582701709|3.0|Great message, great enthusiastic delivery, but . . . I can't help thinking that despite principles such as the Law Of Attraction, there isn't much about human experience thus far explored by our greatest thinkers to supply us with much optimism. Mankind - oops, shouldn't that be PERSONkind in this PC age? - is and remains a selfish, savage breed. I generalize, of course: not everybody resembles this state. But if there is a higher being - or universal principle that allows light and abundance and limitless love into our lives - then why is Mankind's nature so ruthlessly base? Nature, too, is relentlessly cruel.  Surely a benevolent being wouldn't have created man and beast so? I look to the guidance and principles of The Secret and, at most, cheer on its lantern-leading light through the darkness and doubt that afflicts us all; but I remain a reluctant cynic. I'm not implying that only gullible gombeens (an Irish expression for fool) will glean guidance from this book but I am sharply aware that the world's natural state isn't necessarily guided by loving principles. I feel compelled to add here that The Secret's author would smile at my comment of 'the world's a cruel place' and shake her head in pity at my 'belief' (which would need to be revised, according to the principles of the book) but I remain unshaken in my belief that while our reality may be guided by intelligent forces, it's yet to be exclusively revealed whether those forces can actually impact on our lives, for good, or for bad. I do, however, grasp at tendrils of optimism, and for that, I'm glad this book attempts to give those tendrils substance.
B0015D3Z4O|5.0|Some have said that this was going to be Madonna's final album. Is she retiring from show business? Well,she damn well better not! She was just inducted into the Rock And Roll Hall Of Fame and she deserved to be. I've been a Madonna fan since BORDERLINE and HOLIDAY were on the pop/rock charts. Anyway,here's another great set of original tracks such as 4 MINUTES with Justin Timberlake,late of N'Sync. Maybe Madonna was dropped from the Warner Bros. label after recording on the label for the last quarter-century. She has enough hit material now for a \\"Greatest Hits Volume 3\\" collection,since she had three studio albums following the 2001 release of GREATEST HITS VOLUME 2(AMERICAN LIFE,CONFESSIONS ON A DANCE FLOOR and this album). The third Greatest Hits collection could even feature her hits that appeared on neither THE IMMACULATE COLLECTION or GHV2 such as TRUE BLUE,ANGEL,WHO'S THAT GIRL?,BURNING UP,HANKY PANKY,KEEP IT TOGETHER and DRESS YOU UP. Some sources say that Madonna is the biggest-selling female solo artist in pop/rock music history. I once thought Whitney Houston would be that. Mariah Carey is the second biggest-selling female solo artist in pop/rock music history. Except Carey doesn't qualify for induction into the RARHOF until 2015. I just bought this CD,but haven't yet played it. But I know I'll love it.

I feel he offers some real insight and hope for today's society, about living in the moment and creating your life to be one you really love. \\"Love is eternal\\" is an uplifting, powerful message delivered in an easy, engaging style throughout this book. His message of \\"never worry about meeting your soulmate\\" resonates deeply.
B0014BECF8|5.0|One reviewer said that this album was released in the UK in 2006 and finally released in the US this year. I say \\"twenty-five years of George Michael\\" because he had put out his Wham! debut album FANTASTIC twenty-five years ago. Wham! remained little-acknowledged until the 1984 blockbuster release MAKE IT BIG. Michael and Wham! may have debuted in the UK in or around 1981. This reviewer also said,which is true,that this collection is very similar to another set,the 1998 double-disc release of LADIES AND GENTLEMEN-THE BEST OF GEORGE MICHAEL.  You get in this collection the MIB hits WAKE ME UP BEOFRE YOU GO-GO,EVERYTHING SHE WANTS and CARELESS WHISPER(CW may be the single version although the album version is played on the radio as well). A DIFFERENT CORNER is a nice easy listening piece from MUSIC FROM THE EDGE OF HEAVEN,released in 1986. You also have from Michael's Grammy-winning '87 solo debut FAITH(which won the Album Of The Year in '88),the title track,FATHER FIGURE and ONE MORE TRY. MOTHER'S PRIDE is from the '90 follow-up LISTEN WITHOUT PREJUDICE. Again recycled is Elton John's and Bernie Taupin's DON'T LET THE SUN GO DOWN ON ME,a live duet between Michael and EJ. This 1991 recording was initially released as a single,then on EJ's DUETS album,then on EJ's LOVE SONGS album,then on LAG. Michael had been dropped from Columbia Records,the label he even recorded on during the Wham! era. He had been assigned to a smaller label,releasing OLDER in 1996. From OLDER is JESUS TO A CHILD which was relased initially as a single in January 1996. Another interesting track is JOHN(Lennon) AND ELVIS(Presley) ARE DEAD,Michael's personal tribute to the ex-Beatle and King of Rock And Roll. The other songs are awesome!
051788710X|4.0|I've always been interested in dreams and their interpretation regarding everyday life. I agree with Moss regarding using dreams to understand your life. He gives sound examples of how to recall your dreams upon waking, and I have been doing this for years with good results. The book is filled with useful exercises for visualization to aid with creativity, life's messages and healing of self.
B00104QSOM|5.0|Wow!  Even after seeing director Paul Thomas Anderson's vision come to life in \\"There Will Be Blood,\\" you're not quite sure what to make of it.  Is it a character study of a complex man?  Is it a moral tale of what depths men will stoop to in the pursuit of money?  Is it a tale of good and evil, community?  Is it part heavy drama and part seriously twisted comedy?  Well, it might be a little bit of all these.  Watch it yourself to see what you make of it.<br /><br />Daniel Day-Lewis turns in a phenomenal performance--nuanced at times (something he really isn't known for) and over the top as you would expect.  His over the top moments though fit as his oil wildcatter subject, Daniel Plainview, is peeled back like an onion layer after layer until all that's left is this stinking rotten psycho inside...a complex and evil character indeed.  All performances are finely played and perhaps the most interesting things about the flick are tied between the cinematography and the script.  The writing is sparse allowing the characters to tell the tale through both action, word, and deed.<br /><br />Threaded throughout there is this issue of religion and what it does for people's motivations and how it's juxtaposed to a man almost without conscience.  The sense of community and religion even scratch Daniel's oil-slicked and slate hardened skin as it leads him to seemingly have a moment of regret in his relationship with his son.<br /><br />By the end of the movie, despite the title, there really isn't that much blood.  Comparing this to that year's other big Oscar nominated movies, Juno and No Country For Old Men...well it's a better flick than No Country and skillfully told with far less blood and Juno well...there isn't as many pregnant teenagers...but that's beside the point.<br /><br />The point is, see this flick.  By the time you arrive in the bowling alley, you won't know whether you are supposed to be laughing or horrified to the core.  And you don't really know who the Plainview character is which seems to be just what the director, actor, and writer intended.  A fine fine human study...this flick is.  Get it.  ...mmwms to be just what the director, actor, and writer intended.  A fine fine human study...this flick is.  Get it.   ...mmw
0525244581|5.0|People. It is a beautiful spring day today. The sun is shining, a warm breeze is caressing, the clouds are puffy cotton, the squirrels are scurrying and the birds are chirping. (Which is o.k. as long as they don't fly overhead!). Your Metamorpho decided to take his pen and pad to the ol' babbling brook to get into the reflective mood to write this next review. I sat down against an old oak tree and started to write. However, it was so peaceful I started to doze off. In the middle of envisioning Sondra the Seerest doing her latest belly dance, I felt a furry hand tugging at my white linen cuff.<br /><br />\\"Wake up Mr. Metamorpho, wake up!\\" a voice said. I blinked my eyes open to find Pooh there, face full of honey.<br /><br />\\"Oh it's you Pooh,\\" I said with surprise. \\"Funny you should be here. I was just going to write about you.\\"<br /><br />\\"You were?\\" he said with eyes wide open. \\"Why?\\"<br /><br />\\"Well, because I'm here writing a review of Benjamin Hoff's book called 'The Tao of Pooh', which is about you.\\"<br /><br />\\"It is?\\" he asked. \\"Wow!\\"<br /><br />\\"No, Tao Pooh\\", I corrected.<br /><br />\\"What is Tao Mr. Metamorpho?\\" he asked with a puzzled look.<br /><br />\\"Well, I think it is one of the great teachings of China. A philosopy of sorts. Mr. Hoff equates this with how you are. An uncarved block, as he puts it.\\"<br /><br />\\"He thinks I'm a blockhead?\\" Pooh said, as a lone tear started to form.<br /><br />\\"No no Pooh. Even though you are a bear of simple brain, Mr. Hoff explains that you are not stupid, but representative of the simplicity one needs to lead a calm and natural life. Go with the flow, if you will.\\"<br /><br />\\"That sounds better,\\" he smiled.<br /><br />\\"Sure does. The concept of Tao is very interesting, but, essentially the belief is that there is constant evolution in the world. In other words, there is a natural balance in nature and the universe. It is the concept that total harmony will be achieved by letting things be, to run their own course, if you will.\\"<br /><br />\\"I ran a course once, along with Kanga and Roo,\\" he said smiling.<br /><br />\\"Well, it's not exactly like that,\\" I said. \\"You see Pooh, he believes in yin and yang. Two energies that, although opposite, are complimentary and needed for harmony. This applies to many facets of life.\\"<br /><br />\\"Maybe I should ask owl,\\" he said.<br /><br />\\"Well, you could,\\" I said. \\"But he makes a distinction here between knowledge and true wisdom. The answers don't lie in a book per se, they just are, within yourself, if you are aware of the interconnectivity of all things in the universe.\\"<br /><br />\\"You mean I am?\\" he said with surprise.<br /><br />\\"Mr. Hoff seems to thinks so. And I wouldn't apply this to any of your friends. Rabbit never slows himself down long enough to recognize the simple pleasures of life,\\" I said. \\"Eeyore, well, you know Eeyore, he brays over things he can't control. And Piglet, although very small, is uncertain and afraid to take action.\\"<br /><br />\\"I'm hungry. Do you have a jar of honey with you?\\" he asked.<br /><br />\\"No, but I have this,\\" and I handed him a honey graham cracker. \\"There is much more to this philosophy, but the main thing is that the only constant in the universe is change. If you war against it you will only produce unnatural and artificial results, which could produce much unhappiness because it goes against the natural rythmn and flow of life.\\"<br /><br />\\"I don't think I am unhappy Mr. Metamorpho,\\" he said.<br /><br />\\"No Pooh, you aren't,\\" I smiled. \\"You are a living, breathing, stuffed example of Tao.\\"<br /><br />\\"Well, Mr. Metamorpho, I'm not stuffed yet. No honey, huh?\\"<br /><br />\\"No, Pooh. But, I have no doubt that you will find it. Tao provides beary nice things for those who follow the path.\\"<br /><br />\\"Thanks Mr. Metamorpho. Speaking of path, I should go find Christopher Robin. He should be home about now,\\" he said and then sauntered off.<br /><br />And people, if you have read this so far, you will know I will take full advantage of the deus ex machina (a popular method in Greece) to tell you that when I woke up, I remembered this meeting word for word, and wrote it here for your amazement. Now, let me get back to my daydream of Sondra. It was a very pleasurable experience, but I wished she would stop fluttering those stupid silk scarfs in my face. The things one puts up with for love. I tell ya.<br /><br />For the child in all of us -- Metamorphome get back to my daydream of Sondra.

B0006ZE7G2|5.0|I have never liked Pink Floyd's music- You know, maybe 2 or 3 songs, but otherwise I can't stand them- However, this movie is really something special. It's creative, and it's mind boggling. I'd suggest picking it up just based on the fact of its trippy nature. Any fans of art/sci fi/sick stuff, will definitely enjoy this movie. So watch it.
B0015AARJI|5.0|Finally, They did it !!! I remember when it was a problem for Sony to include vibration in its joystick control, and saying that it was impossible. Yes, I remember that, anybody would not believe it could happen.    Who said impossible is nothing ? BBRRRRRRRRRRRR.....!!!
B00151G08Y|4.0|I'm convinced Pendulum's In Silico is a psychological test which reveals what music someone really likes, and how open they are to cross-genre fusions.    First up, I hope In Silico will garner Pendulum -- as ambassadors -- a lot of new fans, and introduce them to other varieties of drum 'n' bass. They've been a powerful live concert act, something which is still a rarity in this DJ-dominated day and age.    No, this is certainly not \\"purist\\" DnB, but no landmark or importantly wonderful music is -- even Goldie's Timeless was surprisingly melodic and delved into soul and other historical influences.    What's especially powerful about this album are the variations in tone and tempo: most DnB/jungle sounds aggressive and balls-to-the-wall, but it's a thin veneer for a lack of expressive range, like an actor who acts macho all the time but unable to be more versatile. Most DnB's definition of \\"courage\\" is to remove the drum (and bass) temporarily during a breakdown section, then bring it back. On the other end -- the high-end! -- of the quality spectrum, Pendulum introduces tempo doublings and halvings, live-sounding drum fills, and a lot of changes and variation which really take you on a wild ride.    Pendulum's bravery to interpolate a certain happy hardcore-esque tune (from Dune) in \\"Granite\\" speaks loudly of their disregard for snobbery, and talent to pick a great basis to lay their beats (and more) on.    I wish this album ran longer, but am quite pleased with how Pendulum has stirred up such a tasty stew: the closer, \\"The Tempest\\", would make an excellent film for a triumphant action movie scene, blaring with heavy metal sensibility while pushing forth the nimble, quick-footed drum 'n' bass style with loads of substance.
B0000AC8N4|5.0|I'm enjoying this CD. Unfortunately I can't elaborate in terms of the composition and harmonic balance, etc because I'm not that sophisticated a listener, but I feel he's a fantastic musician and this CD captures the spirit of his genius well.
0131103628|4.0|This book is extremely well written but it moves very fast.  It is a short read so in order to get the most out of it you'll need to read then re-read much of it.  Also, actually doing the examples and excercises will get you that much closer to knowing the C language intimately.    I know that this book was written a long time ago and the fact that it still holds up is pretty amazing.  It is somewhat dated in terms of the typography and layout in fact it's not the easiest book to read visually.      If you are brand new to programming you'll definately want to start out with a different book.  This book is not a friendly intro to programming but more of an expert essay on the C language.    Two things that really bother me:  This book has some Unix based exercises toward the end so you'll need to get a copy of Cygwin (a unix environment that runs on Windows) if you are running a Windows based operating system to complete the excercizes.  The next thing which bothers me even more is there is almost little to no material on dynamic memory.  It skims over the use of keywords like \\"malloc\\" and some of the examples which use dynamic memory don't handle memory cleanup at all.  In fact there's almost no mention of cleaning up after yourself after you've requested memory using \\"malloc\\"  I find this disturbing because to be effective at dynamic memory management which is a foundational concept in C you have to understand how important it is to be responsible about requesting memory from the OS and then \\"free\\"ing it once you are done with it.  Again, the material on this subject is very thin.    But, aside from that...if you are a C programmer it's almost a given that you own this book.    Trivia: Ever wondered where the \\"Hello World\\" statement came from?  This book is it!  ;)
B0002V7O3I|4.0|The 80's was a good time to be a kid as far as movies went.     Speilberg's influence was big at that time, mainly due to \\"E.T.\\", a movie that had a big sense of innnocence and childlike wonderment. ET had a big influence on a lot of the other sci fi and fantasy movies that came out after it, for a number of years, including this film.     It was directed by Speilberg collaborator Joe Dante, & is for sure similar in many ways to \\"ET\\", but with a 50/50 blend of Spielbergian wonder and Joe Dante's classic movie nostalgia and wisecracks.    The three kids get the help of unseen, freindly aliens in making a sort of \\"force field bubble\\" that can fly anywhere, even into space...after converting an old abandoned carnival Tilt-O-Whirl car into their spaceship, they are able to put themselves inside the bubble, which, after some test runs, takes the three kids off into space, where they visit with the aleins who contacted them, being pulled in to a giant alien spaceship floating somewhere in space...  However, the aliens themselves, rather than be some sort of \\"source of knowledge\\" as the main character hopes, instead make the kids laugh with their own wisecracks and jokes. It is especially funny that the aliens learned to speak english from intercepting tv broadcasts that have gone out into space...thus the aliens impersonate cartoon characters, celebrities, etc...    this was not as major a film as ET was, in fact back at that time it was sadly undermarketed...I remember seeing it for the first time on HBO over a year after it came out...However, This movie is, to me, a lesser known 80's classic...not as famous as \\"Goonies\\" or \\"ET\\", but similar for it's own child-like and optimistic story.
B0010YSD7M|3.0|My wife and I rented this movie because we just could not slog through all of the Ori episodes of SG1, but wanted to see how they could possibly end the battle against the Ori.<br /><br />See, the good thing about SG1 pre-Ori, was that all the characters had personality - even the bad old Goa'uld. When they introduced the Ori, all that ended. The Goa'uld you loved to hate. The Ori you could only hate.<br /><br />Everything in this movie seemed rushed and disjointed. The ending was hokey. The movie was filled with scenes that were reminiscent of scenes from pre-Ori episodes.<br /><br />I have to wonder why Christoper Judge was even in the movie. Did he speak two complete sentences in the entire movie, other than to try to make \\"Tommy\\" not feel so despairing over his past?<br /><br />Vala's Ori daughter added almost nothing to the movie - her petulant pouting and posturing not withstanding.<br /><br />We were glad to see, finally, an ancient actually take responsibility and bust the chops of the Ori.<br /><br />The way the movie ended, they left it open for future SG1 movies. From what I've read of Continuum, though, there seems to be nothing original they can do to return to the glory days of SG1.<br /><br />I give it three stars only because I was so glad to see the end of the Ori.
1932907009|5.0|...do yourself a favor and read some Blake Snyder!    As a general rule, I'm not a fan of screenwriting books.  Most of them parrot the same drivel over and over and by the end you really don't feel like you've learned anything new.  Blake takes a more casual, less academic approach than many so-called gurus and the result is entertaining, informative, and practical.  And he's got actual produced credits with major studios, too -- take that, McKee!  He's been through the trenches, suffered through the nine rings of development hell, and lived to tell us all about it.  We can all learn from his experience.    I also like that he covers every aspect of the craft, not just the actual nuts and bolts of writing the scripts.  He takes you through crafting an idea, bullet-proofing its market potential, creating a solid logline, breaking down genres... everything you need to know.  And he does it with humor and personality and makes it all so easy to grasp.  His \\"Blake Snyder Beat Sheet\\" breaks down structure into all those simple beats you know and love, but he makes each one his own and informs every step with  new insights.  He also addresses things such as exposition and character arc in ways you never considered.  He comes at them from a new perspective.    My writing partner and I consider Blake's books invaluable resources.  They've not only helped us in developing new material, but with older pre-Cat scripts as well.  We had numerous old specs sitting in drawers, knowing they had problems but unable to pinpoint them.  Save the Cat helped us break through some of those barriers and gave us some genuine \\"a-ha!\\" moments.  Hopefully, they will do the same for you.    And don't forget the software!  It takes the old \\"index card\\" method into the digital age, letting you drag and drop scenes all around a virtual corkboard.  And it won't let you move forward with making your little index cards until you've laid out a title, logline, and all the steps for your beat sheet.  Ilike this because it forces a little discipline on you and won't let you dive head first into the shark pond without some kind of fail safe.  Another great resource for any screenwriter, neophyte or professional.       HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!
B0010358D0|4.0|If you liked Appleseed you'll like this, but don't expect to see anything new. The eye-popping visuals are back with a finer palette of colors but the storyline is weak. It feels more like an episode than a movie.<br />Personally I liked Vexille (2007) better. It will undoubtedly draw comparisons due to the fact that the writer/director, Fumihiko Sori, is the same man who produced Appleseed (2004). But I think you'll find the storyline to be a little fresher. Still, Ex Machina is worth buying. I suggest that you buy this product at a retail store. My pre-order on the collectable metal case edition arrived sealed with the discs and nothing else. No chapter booklet, nor did it have the special edition comic that came with a retail purchase. A mistake I won't make again.

B00006CXSS|5.0|My husband likes all the war movies, me, not so much.  But I have to say they hit a home run with this series.  I could not wait to watch the next episode.  It is a very personal view of war and their experiences.
B000F0UUIM|5.0|He stands in the doorway because he is the typical Ford hero. He is a wanderer and outsider who serves a society he cannot himself live in. He respects the values of that society, the domestic virtues of home and community, but he is driven by a higher call to duty. He is independent, self-reliant, more physical than intellectual, expresses himself more through gestures than words, and is not afraid to use violence when it is required. He drinks hard, fights hard, lives hard, and remains always alone. Living outside the law of society, he embodies the spirit of that law by adhering to a strict personal code of moral behavior and an almost religious respect for ritual and honor. He is an ordinary human being raised to the stature of hero through his courageous acceptance of a situation that he cannot, as a self-respecting man, avoid. He usually dies. He is almost always defeated. But the proof of his heroism is his private victory in the face of defeat.
B000Y7ZHCU|4.0|loved the dvd ,only problem the second special features won't play on my dvd player
B000JLSM00|5.0|The first image in The Searches is the silhouette of a woman who is standing in the cool, dark doorway of a frontier cabin and looking out into the searing heat and sun of the desert. As she stoically waits, a man rides up, wearily dismounts, and walks slowly toward her. We are in John Ford country, and all the elements are there. Pictorially, it is a scene of stark contrasts, light in conflict with dark, interior pitted against exterior, the figures sharply etched in their solitude, the implacable outlines of a harsh environment looming behind them. The people are dramatic, larger than life, and what happens to them has the force and fatality of history recorded on the screen
B00005JOA0|1.0|This is the worst BBC movie I have ever seen. When I order one of those classic Jane Austen-style movies, I expect something \\"clean\\" that I could watch with children in the house. I did not expect or desire to view bedroom scenes in a period film, especially scenes containing sexual perversion and depravity. I guess they wanted to show how demented the heroine's husband was, but the scenes were disturbing and I wish I had never seen that movie.

B000AYEL6U|5.0|Thank you BBC for a movie worth watching! (there are so few out there these days). This is one of the best movies I have ever seen. It reminded me a little of Pride and Prejudice, but with a new twist, giving it a feel of its own that kept the viewer captivated the entire 4 hours.<br /><br />It highlighted characters of differing social spheres and put them all together in a way that gave the viewer a unique insight into that particular time period. I'm not a big history buff, but even so, found it very interesting to watch the workings of the cotton mill and all of the politics involved between the \\"masters\\" and workers, and so forth.<br /><br />And the love story was very nice - the thread that held it all together. It was a rough road, but it was heart-warming to see how the two main characters evolved and softened towards each other as the film went on. I also thought the heroine was cast a little differently from what you usually see in these movies, adding more interest overall. A movie definitely worth seeing!
B000IAZPKM|5.0|Extremely well done all around with great sounds and visuals, showcasing the showmanship of the band members and capturing the excitement of the Norwegian audience!

0061020710|5.0|I recently finished The Color of Magic, the first Discworld book by Terry Pratchett. Although short, it was really a fast read. It's satirical and irreverent without being wordy, poking fun at many fantasy cliches which have dominated the genre for years. Yet, Pratchett uses some of these himself as well as some creative techniques. I'll admit that some things we simply cannot wrap our heads around because they are so fantastic! Often, his style reminds me of the late Douglas Adams whose series The Hitch Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy has been a favourite of mine since I first discovered it in middle school.<br /><br />The novel starts quickly with a great city afire (though Pratchett assures us it will rebuild as it always has) which as been accidentally started by one of the main characters, Twoflower who begins the novel by fleeing said city with his newfound companion Rincewind \\"the Wizard\\" who has actually flunked out of wizardry school and isn't much of a magic handler at all.<br /><br />The Colour of Magic<br />The book flashes back to their acquaintanceship where Rincewind discovers Twoflower (and his mysterious sentient chest of Luggage), a visitor to Rincewind's home city Ankh-Morpork (the first ever tourist on Discworld) and follows them on their coming journey which eventually leads them to the end of the world, literally.<br /><br />Rincewind and Twoflower live on Discworld, literally a disc sitting on the backs of 4 elephants who themselves sit on the back of a giant turtle (gender unknown which is quite the curiosity to Discworld inhabitants). In such a world, direction is measured in relation to the rim of the disc (rimward) or hub (hubward).<br /><br />Though they battle the original fire, common thieves, a soul eating monster, imagined dragons who reside in an upside down mountain with their quarreling family of royal imaginers, and eventually end up in Krull at the edge of the world, while avoiding saying the number 8 (which Pratchett also avoids saying by describing it any number of round-about ways) which is closely associated with magic, Octarine (the eighth color, that of magic) and all-things-generally-unpleasant as Rincewind repeatedly eludes the none-too-happy-about-it Death, they remain generally unscathed.<br /><br />Or do they? I recommend you try this book out and see for yourself (as do countless editors, critics and journalists whose opinions of Pratchett and his works who preface this novel)!ound-about ways) which is closely associated with magic, Octarine (the eighth color, that of magic) and all-things-generally-unpleasant as Rincewind repeatedly eludes the none-too-happy-about-it Death, they remain generally unscathed.

0395631246|4.0|Since there are already 140 reviews, I'll keep it short.<br /><br />\\"Getting to yes\\" has been recommended to me for many years and used as a basis of several trainings and discussions I had in the past. I finally decided to read the book to see if there is anything more than what I heard earlier. From that perspective, I was disappointed. Though, looking at the book without previous knowledge, I'd say that it's a great introduction to principled negotiation, probably the best there is.<br /><br />The core of the book tries to explain the reader that negotiating about fixes positions is most of the time a lose-lose scenario. Therefore it's better to try to look at what both negotiators interests are and then try to work from there. Then by using these interests, the negotiators will be able to find a solutions with is mutual beneficial for both parties. That way a negotiations turns into a win-win situation and also does not have any personal impacts on the people doing the negotiation.<br /><br />From this core perspectives, the authors approach different topics related to negotiation. When to negotiate (having you're alternative). Ways to brainstorm solutions. Ways to negotiate with many parties. Working in a principled way if the person with whom you are negotiating is not, etc etc.<br /><br />The second edition ends with a section on answers to common questions, which almost summarizes the book itself.<br /><br />\\"Getting to Yes\\" is a small book (though it could have been smaller!) and is definitively worth reading. It wasn't as good as I expected, but have not seem a better book on this topic. Recommended.
0316926345|4.0|I read \\"Brideshead Revisted\\" after I saw the PBS special back in 81. I was absolutley mesmerized when Jeremy Irons saw the grand house for the last time.The book was utterly fantastic but then I am a fan of English literature. One can surmise how religion especially the Catholic religion can become a choke hold in one's life and to challenge that choke hold would begin a lifetime of guilt and reqret.Waugh depicted these subjects in a most unusual prose. My life is completely different from the guilded manor houses of 1920's but When reading this great book, I find myself immerse into the Marchmain family problems with some understanding. Unusual indeed since I am from the back woods of Louisiana.
0446310786|5.0|One of the biggest daily challenges high school students face is the struggle to be accepted. As high school students reading Harper Lee's \\"To Kill a Mockingbird, we are reminded of the progressive thinking of the 1960s. Many of the lessons Atticus teaches Scout represent the values of this era. In the 60s, acceptance and love were upheld and the Civil Rights movement became apparent in everyday lives of Americans.   In TKAM, Atticus addresses these morals, such as when Atticus advises Scout not to call African-Americans the n-word. Atticus explains that just because people are different doesn't mean that they should be shunned and disrespected. This is an ideal of the 60s, as shown by the progress of the Civil Rights Movement.   Another of the 1960s values shown in Atticus' teachings is displayed when he says to Scout, \\"You just hold your head high and keep those fists down.\\" The anti violence concept that Atticus preaches was prevalent in the 1960s culture. Many people advocated an anti-war stance which called for peace and unity over violence. We find that To Kill a Mockingbird manifests the ideals of the 1960s which are still valuable today.

B00114LF4E|5.0|These are all wonderful performances from the peak of Karajan's career, and fabulous Decca recorded sound that has rarely if ever been surpassed in almost 50 years since. I even enjoyed the two Brahms symphonies more than some other reviewers seem to have.    I was, however, disappointed in the accompanying booklet, which did not seem very complete or adequate for a box like this. There's a general essay about Karajan's career, but nothing about the circumstances of these particular recordings. The booklet also omits specific recording dates and production credits -- certainly not up to the standards of DG's \\"Originals\\" series or other historical reissues. Nevertheless, if you know any of these recordings or are just wondering what all the fuss is about on the 100th anniversary of Karajan's birth, grab this before it disappears!

0060935464|4.0|Harper Lee's Pulitzer-prize winning novel, To Kill A Mockingbird, was published in 1960. The novel, set in 1930's Alabama, details the life of a young girl, Scout, and her older brother, Jem, as they encounter the prejudices of their small town. Their father, Atticus Finch, the town's lawyer, must defend a Negro male in a case that changes the Finch's lives forever. The book details Scout's period of self discovery & her exploration of ethics in a time of racial conflict in America's South. Scout, the narrator of the novel, is six at the beginning, but as she grows, so too does the novel's vocabulary. Words like \\"stricture\\" and \\"slop\\" turn into \\"ex cathedro\\" and \\"morphodite\\". The diction evolves in accordance with the development of the character changing to reflect shifting views & perspectives.       Although a great piece of literature, the novel does not contain similes or metaphors. This lack, however, does not detract from the literary experience, but rather adds to the book a refreshing element of honesty & innocence. A relatively new literary work, To Kill A Mockingbird is a masterpiece that will be enjoyed by adults, children and families for years to come.    Reviewed by: K. Klavon, P. Friedman, J.

B000B8IA2G|1.0|Well, I *wanted* to like it, really I did. The effects were gorgeous, the premise wonderful... the writing abysmal, and the acting about 50-50. And when I say 50-50, I don't mean average; I mean 50% excellent and 50% forehead-slappingly bad.<br /><br />If you loved the original series... you can watch this, but don't expect the same high quality, competence or intelligence.  The writers are evidently rehashing old sci-fi standard plots, one at a time, without comprehending the basic premise behind the originals. I'm afraid we were yelling at the TV in disgust at one point. Writing characters who wouldn't be able to survive due to being too dumb to live on this world does not make me believe in their ability to make it on another.<br /><br />It does get better, a little. If you can sit through the worst of it in the beginning they start to manage a couple better episodes towards the end. Now, if we can just some up with a way to assassinate that idiotic commander chick, it might all turn out ok. (I can only blame so much of her character on the writers having no clue of the leadership qualities necessary to run a remote scientific/military outpost. The rest is just bad acting.)
B00132D808|4.0|I dug \\"Fever you cant sweat out\\" . I thought it was fun and catchy and  slightly different. It seems like they threw a lot of what they liked in the first record. They used big band  themes, dance themes, punk themes. They didn't hold back. But unfortunately its also kind  of forgettable at times. Don't get me wrong, i liked it but wasn't overly excited about their next record. Kind of thought they were going to go the way of rehashing the same sound and and really going more of  the way of the catchy radio friendly stuff; cause lets face it, it sold really well. Then someone told me pretty odd came out. I went and  checked it out and was completely surprised.    I was floored to hear songs that didn't sound like anything going on right now. They have crafted an album, that in my head is mature and honest. They grew up. Its not the same catchy pop they used to do. They explored a different side of music that isnt hidden behind loud guitars and thumping drums. They went or true songwriting. There is definitely a Beatlesesque tone to the record but  who cares. Who hasn't gone that way at one point? In a lot of ways Panic! has reminded me that music is an art and not a business. Going in the direction they did is more punk rock than putting out \\"Fever you can't sweat out 2\\".   In a lot of ways this reminds me of my experience with the get up kids. I'm 29, so when the GUK announced that they were going to release their longly anticipated album \\"On a wire\\" i couldn't wait ( i was 22 at the time.) I had (and still am) a huge GUK fan. I loved everything they did.  I got up early the day it came out, picked it up and put it on and got a band that i didn't recognize. It was folky. It was slow, it wasn't up beat. It wasn't even the GUK. I hated it. I swore it off. About a 2 years later i put it on and loved it. So all i'm saying is don't hate on the record. Put it away for a year or so then go back to it. It really will surprise you.

0446364495|1.0|I read this in one sitting yesterday afternoon, and immediately regretted it. What's so romantic about betraying your spouse? Maybe this is just my conservative upbringing, but both Francesca and Robert disgusted me beyond belief. I especially hated her daughter's reaction to the affair. There is no justification for cheating, least of all fickle emotions. It seems Waller is trying to insult the reader's intelligence.    [..]The romance itself was unconvincing, rushed, and unrealistic. I certainly hope this \\"novel\\" doesn't find its way onto any required reading lists, because it's such garbage.

B0016HNOXQ|5.0|I think I will be coming at this album from a different perspective to 90% of you...I had not been a Portishead fan prior to this album.  I had heard some of their previous work in passing and been mostly unimpressed.  I happened upon this album by accident and it has truly blown me away.  It strikes me from reading the mixed reviews that the \\"traditional\\" Portishead fans are mad that they didn't stick to the tried n' true formula, whereas, more open minded folks are lauding it as a classic.  I'm definately in the latter category.  This album is very special in a unique, insular, introspective kind of way...the songs are built around odd, somewhat glitchy, off kilter rhythms (or none at all) that kind of ebb and flow...the sounds provide a lush, and yes, sometimes prickly background to Beth's musings which mostly seem to be inner thoughts about the fragility of life and love expressed in a somewhat somber, if thoughful, tone.  This is the kind of album you cherish for it's singular beauty and complete unrelatedness to any music scene current or past.  It just is... Now for some comparisons (gotta have 'em for reference):  if you mix up the following albums into a witches brew, you might come up with something close to this \\"This is Stina Nordenstam\\" by Stina Nordenstam, \\"Soak\\" by Mimi (Goese), and \\"When I was a Boy\\" by Jane Siberry.  If you are fans of these artists you will like this album.

There are some twists and turns I was not expecting in \\"I Am Legend\\" and some tear gerking moments that were not present in the old movie. Overall I liked \\"I Am Legend\\", was a bit disapointed in the ending. Entertaining, what else do you want in a movie. I'll watch it again.
0553805460|1.0|Poor Chandler and Carter. Not only are their parents divorced, and their father is a drug addict and a convicted felon. One of them saw daddy push mommy down the stairs. And regardless of what he says (Jordan Belfort has the self-awareness of a bug), their father came out of jail being the same pathetic jerk he was going in.    He devotes zero pages of the book to the effect his actions had on others, and he seems to consider breaking the law wrong simply because he got caught. And he now lurks on Amazon.com, attacking the many reviewers who didn't like his book, calling them \\"morons\\" and even, in one case suggesting the reviewer resign his job - simply because he hated the book. Let me repeat: this is a guy who thinks someone who doesn't like his book should give up his day job. That's how much of a jerk Jordan Belfort is, and it shows in every page of his tedious book.     I feel sorry for his children. I bet they'll be in rehab or jail before they turn twenty-one.
B0013FXWU6|5.0|All I can say is \\"intense\\". New, bold, unlike any other movie I have seen in a long time. Action packed, no, but the intensitey of the moment keeps you glued to the screen.  What an ending, from prospector to insane. If anyone has felt motivated for their own cause this move will strike a note. Watch it to the end. I loved it.
0743289692|5.0|My curiosity has been fed about Ayaan Hirsi Ali. When I browsed the bookstore looking for another captivating book to read, I came across her book cover, which did interest me, but it was her story that intrigued me. Who is this woman? Who is this Infidel?    Through her words and imagery, I traveled throughout the vast lands of Africa from Somalia to Kenya and all the way to Europe. Her story is a journey not just physical but also a spiritual and intellectual journey. This novel explored her upbringing in Africa as a child of the Muslim faith. As in any faith, we are naïve to what is beyond the teachings that are passed down to us through interpreters. Children are dared not to question the prevalent contradictions that exist within organized religions and they are definitely not allowed to question the purpose of certain customs and rituals that as in some cultures are connected to the core of one's faith. Ayaan's soul began to question her surroundings as her eyes began to open to the ugly truth of her faith however her questions were not tolerated as a Muslim (or as in any other religious system the only difference is that you can suffer by death for your inquiries). It is generally believed that if you are questioning the precepts of one's faith then you are allowing satanic influences to steer you from the \\"Straight Path\\" which is an abomination to you and to the honor of your family--your dedication to your faith should be unequivocal and be  a complete submission to Allah.     Ayaan could have shunned her growing feelings of doubt about her faith but she chose not to for her own self-betterment and in the name of truth. Her quest to discovering the truths of being a Muslim and its doctrines wasn't an easy path because Ayaan truly loved her faith, her family and her culture. As she progressed from childhood to adulthood with these burning questions, she longed for her freedom from the constraints of this paternalistic, clan-segregated society. She wanted more and sought her freedom in Europe. She courageously established her new beginning in Holland and soon obtained her Dutch citizenship. She lived the immigrants' dream to become a productive member of a new society. She became educated and was a hard worker--staying connected to immigrants from Somalia she served as a translator. However she began to see the same violence exhibited back home from where she ran away from at the doorsteps of Holland--her new home. The violence that she saw were Muslim girls and women repeatedly being abused, and even killed by their families and husbands in the name of Allah. Women were not only physically abused but deprived of independent thought, choice of freedom and equality. The Dutch government was unaware of this problem soon to become an ever-growing trend of violence that would forever change the religious, political and economic landscape of their society.     She couldn't stand for this! Ayaan pledged to bring awareness to the Dutch about this but before she could go on her crusade for justice she had to arm herself with the social and political history of Holland and the world. She later entered the political arena and was a new voice with vigor. She captivated society's attention--good and bad. When she became a member of parliament (historic!), she reveled this opportunity to influence change and introduce new legislation bringing to light the realities of the abuse crisis and the violence overtures of the Muslim teachings. However, her term in parliament was marred by death threats and murder of a confidant leaving Ayaan feeling like a prisoner in her own skin as she was constantly being relocated.    Her story doesn't end on the very last page--it simply begins a new chapter as she continues her journey to the United States to engage in intellectual discourse on the Muslim truth.

0316776963|4.0|I found that the book, Me Talk Pretty One Day,  By David Sedaris was an amusing autobiography.  It captured my attention and forced me to want to continue reading.  I thought that Sedaris descriptively explained the details of his life.  Sedaris made his personal life story hilarious, dramatic, and quite dirty.    The book was comical and kept me laughing a majority of the time.  Sedaris has a very random sense of humor and that compelled me to read more.  I also found some of his life tragedies were really stirring, keeping me on my toes as I read along.  At a lot of times, Sedaris would speak in an exceeding indecent way.  It was still very humorous, but if you don't prefer books that have a crude sense of humor, I would advise that this is not the book for you.  This book most certainly had aspects that make it a really appealing book to read.    I definitely enjoyed this book and it was extremely interesting to read.  This book is a great book for people who are seeking a droll book about a man's struggles in life.  Me Talk Pretty One Day is a great book and I loved reading it.

B000WMEAKC|5.0|OneRepublic made waves with their hit single \\"Apologize\\" as a remix produced by Timbaland.  Some could argue that if it wasn't for Timbaland remixing the song, they wouldn't be popular.  Even if that's so, their debut album \\"Dreaming Out Loud\\" Is a great listen from beginning to finish.  The best songs are clearly the hits \\"Apologize\\" and \\"Stop And Stare.\\"  Every song is good and well-written.  They're a very likeable band that has fans of all ages and backgrounds.  If you liked the hit singles from this album you'll like the rest like me. I highly reccomend this  album, one of 2007's best!

B000W1V44I|4.0|I always had a softspot for backstreet boys, even though I'm a guy.  I thought they were one of the better boybands to come out of the late 90's.  I liked how they all shared vocals and there wasn't one lead singer.  I think they're very talented.  If you liked their big hits like \\"I Want It That Way\\" or \\"As Long As You Love Me\\" then there's more to offer on this great album.  They've matured a lot since their self-titled debut album.  This album may not have sold very well and it's a shame it didn't.  Even if you don't love the backstreet boys, I urge you to give this album and the band a chance.  It's such a good album!
B000VWE5OY|2.0|Having seen & enjoyed Dr. Who & with the high ratings this series was being given, I expected a lot more from it.  I loved the first two shows, but as I got deeper into the series I thought it deteriorated into specious ridiculousness.  There was so much great material to work with & they could have done so much better.  One thing I think was missing was an on-going touch of humor (humour, if you're Brit). Guess I'll stick with Firefly.
B000G8NXYG|5.0|What can I tell you about \\"Seven Samurai\\" that you haven't already heard? I was thinking recently about why it is that, although the dialogue in the film mostly functions to advance the plot, and the later scenes are mostly devoted to the mechanics of battle, nonetheless every one of the characters is vibrant and alive, and instantly wins one's trust and sympathy. The answer, I think, lies in gestures and facial expressions. The faces of the samurai embody distinct and memorable character types, and their mannerisms, rather than their words, serve to bring out details of their personality.    Katsushiro, the young samurai, has few if any \\"introspective\\" lines, but he's the most expressive depiction of the \\"naive youth\\" archetype that I have ever seen, in any film. The performance captures countless lifelike details -- like how he doesn't know what to do when Shino comes on to him, and how later he stands around looking shell-shocked. Or, for instance, how, when he sees Kikuchiyo brooding outside, he runs up to him with a boyish smile, evidently used to viewing Kikuchiyo as the jester of the group, and then suddenly looks bewildered when he sees that Kikuchiyo is not in the best of moods. Or his embarrassment when he throws the coins at Yohei and Rikichi in the inn and sees their obeisance. Or his amazement when he finally kills a bandit in battle, or his explosion of grief at the battle's end.     Kikuchiyo, too, is always interesting to watch. I don't have to point out his passionate nature, but it's interesting how the film puts in little details that set him apart from the samurai. The scene where he unsuccessfully tries to ride Yohei's horse is very funny, but it also underscores the fact that the other samurai have been trained to ride from birth, and Kikuchiyo's most valiant efforts just aren't enough to bridge the gulf between them. He frequently misinterprets \\"what it means to be a samurai,\\" and can't understand what exactly he's missing. He tops Kyuzo's feat by stealing one of the bandits' guns and then fearlessly taunting them, and is surprised when Kambei scolds him. The distinction, of course, is that Kyuzo performed heroic deeds during his free time, whereas Kikuchiyo abandoned his post, but the latter doesn't get it.    Kyuzo himself is an iconic figure. The best scene in the entire film (I have seen it cause a standing ovation in a theatre) is when he returns in the morning with the stolen gun and modestly sits down to sleep. Katsushiro praises him to the skies, and after he prances away, there is a remarkable expression on Kyuzo's face, a bit flattered and embarrassed, and also empathetic to Katsushiro's youth. And Kyuzo's absolutely detached calm, as he sits by a tree and picks flowers while he waits for the bandits to arrive, is another timeless image.     Then there's Gorobei, who has almost no lines at all, but who instantly wins one over with his good-natured grin. He's the guy who immediately sees through Kambei's \\"trap\\" in the inn, and calls from outside, \\"Please, no jokes!\\" He is rarely in the spotlight, but he seems to be closer to Kambei in character than the others. And it's funny that he's so easily amused by Heihachi -- the way he cracks up at the latter's jokes is funnier than the jokes themselves.    Kambei, as the leader who holds the group together and never loses his cool, and also has most of the \\"meaningful\\" lines, has probably been extensively analyzed already. But aside from his personal appeal, his methodical approach to strategy is captivating, because each of his moves looks so logical and well-thought-out, like something one ought to do in that situation, not at all like a mere plot point. One of the best conversations occurs when he asks Gorobei, \\"How would you attack this village?\\" A professional approach, forsooth.    The film's power of suggestion extends to the setting itself. Kurosawa firmly insists on the distance between samurai and peasants. In the final scene with Shino, Rikichi's statements about the power of love fall on deaf ears, as they should. The villagers turn and leave, and Kambei decides not to intervene. This resolution, gloomy mainly due to the sense of inevitability that it creates, is admirably true to life. Also notable, and very understated, is the fact that all casualties among the samurai are due to guns. Perhaps this is a subtle way of suggesting that their era is already almost over, and even the utmost skill won't help them in modern war.    Everyone has already commented on the visual aspects of the film, but the imagery is unforgettable. There's a horrifying image early on when the farmers' rice is stolen in the inn, and Yohei tries to pick up fallen grains one by one. And the most indelible sight is that of the chaotic, vicious final battle in the rain and mud. Kambei's meticulous planning, after holding out for so long, finally gives way to a total mess, a jumble of horses and people in which the samurai accomplish amazing martial feats in every shot, but the shots move so quickly that one doesn't have time to appreciate them.    This is one of the few truly flawless films in existence. It is three and a half hours long, but the length is hardly noticeable. The battles are gripping. But aside from the masterful choreography and technical innovation, the characters just come to life so vividly! It's difficult to name another film where such thorough characterization would be implied through such indirect means. It belongs in any film collection.
B0013FXWU6|4.0|Winner of two Academy Awards for Best Actor (Daniel Day-Lewis) and Best Cinematography, \\"There Will Be Blood\\" is based upon the 1927 novel \\"Oil!\\" by Upton Sinclair and takes place in California during the early 20th century with an oil prospecter making his fortune.  Daniel Plainview (Day-Lewis), the aforementioned oilman, is a shrewd businessman and sees death early on as a part of life in the industry but it is only after he is challenged by a deceptive evangelist does death go from inadvertent to unmistakably discriminate.<br /><br />In a cacophonous mix of cutthroat business and zealous religion, a war is instigated when a young man named Paul Sunday (Dano) comes to Daniel and offers to point him in the direction of a surefire fortune in exchange for a handsome sum.  Paul's hometown village of \\"Little Boston\\" is a figurative gold mine, the family farm and the hundreds of miles surrounding it an untapped wealth of crude oil.  Under the guise of pheasant hunting enthusiasts, Daniel and his son H.W. (Freasier) start investigating the property and their suspicions are quickly confirmed.  Within no time, a deal is on the table but Paul's twin brother Eli (Dano), a local preacher, impedes the contract by not only demanding a generous portion of the proceeds but also the chance to expand his modest congregation.  Hiding behind the façade of Christianity, he is motivated by greed, only to be unexpectedly matched by the cruelty and cunning of Daniel.<br /><br />The film is more than deserved of both of its Oscars, namely Day-Lewis's riveting performance as Daniel Plainview, a man who is torn between the love for his son and his love for self-affluence (or so one thinks).  The 52-year old Oscar winner's performance is matched by that of his 24-year old co-star Paul Dano as Eli Sunday.  Though he was cast as both of the Sunday brothers, it is as the sanctimonious Eli that Dano makes a pointed connection with the audience.  He is the character whom viewers love to hate, using religion to veil his egoism and his struggle for power, so much so that he aids in lending sympathy to Daniel, a man whose motivations are equally insatiate to his own.<br /><br />Stunning cinematography comes courtesy of Robert Elswit, a man who served as director of photography for P.T. Anderson's much-discussed `99 film \\"Magnolia\\".  Filmed in greater part in Marfa, Texas (neighboring with the cast and crew of \\"No Country For Old Men\\"), Elswit recreates and highlights the best of old California's sweeping vistas, its rustic mountain ranges, rolling hills and dry desert-like tundra the picture-perfect backdrop.<br /><br />Paul Thomas Anderson has a short but unique body of work and this film has created the official apex of his career.  It is also a sign that there will be many more interesting projects to come from this 38-year old writer/director/producer.  Dusting off the ashes ten years after the outrageous cult favorite \\"Boogie Nights\\", \\"There Will Be Blood\\" is a definitive sign that this director has matured.<br /><br />Out of a total of 10 stars, I give it a 9.  I can only hope it will parallel to Joel and Ethan Cohen's magnum opus \\"No Country For Old Men\\".veil his egoism and his struggle for power, so much so that he aids in lending sympathy to Daniel, a man whose motivations are equally insatiate to his own.

I loved Hale's Jane and could totally relate to her Darcy/P&P obsession -- and found myself caught up in her real life angst and disappointments.  My Janeite sensibilites never were in danger of offense, even by Hale's blatantly, contrived happy ending.  (Because we all know, happy endings were one of JA's speciality.)  This book left me with a happy heart!  A must buy! sooner than later.
B00006EXCC|5.0|The Stones, right before the change, of Between The Buttons and Their Satanic...where they struggled for their sound and identity, to regain it, with such future classics as Jumpin' Jack Flash, Street Fighting Man, Gimme Shelter etc, til the beginning of their downfall with Exile (3 great songs, and it makes all them stupid critic's lists).    This was the first album where the Stones wrote all their material, and what gems are contained here! They were never snottier, or more sexist! (hooray!) Mother's Little Helper is of course a classic; how more obnoxious can you get than with an opening line like \\"what a drag it is getting old\\"? Good drug song.    Stupid Girl! Ah, what a great song about a stuck-up, narcissistic woman.  An underrated classic, just like this album. Nobody seems to know how great this LP is, it's like an appendage to a greatest hits collection, to make your classic Stones collection complete.  Great lines here: \\"she purrs like a pussycat; then she turns around and hisses back\\" (must've been about a Scorpio chick!)  The whole song has such wonderful venomous lyrics!    Lady Jane -- a love song following that? nah, this is sarcasm at its best I feel. This is probably the most sonically stunning song on this superb remaster (sure sounds a lot better than my old German CD version). The interlude is positively beautiful.    Other highlights are Doncha Bother Me, the horny Going Home (Mick's building up steam there, determined, he's gonna be back, oh YEAH. Great bluesy number); Out Of Time (another great sexist song; the message: you're too late, b---h! your loss, clearly [\\"my poor DISCARDED baby\\"]); I Am Waiting (the saddest song here -- \\"stand of coming years, escalation fears, you will find out\\" -- sadder than the truth behind Mother's Little Helper); What To Do (super-catchy number); and of course, the piece de resistance of sexism, Under My Thumb.    What a classic song! While Social Distortion did a brilliant couple (okay, FOUR) cover versions with incredible venom, there's no need here; she's clearly just a \\"squirmy dog\\" who \\"does just what she's told\\" and, best of all this so-called conquerer of men who once had our protagonist down -- \\"the way she talks when she's spoken to\\" --YEAH!!!! Also, \\"her eyes are just kept to herself\\". This may be the greatest song ever!  For any guy who's been done wrong, this is YOUR song!  In fact, it's the way to BE!  It's like \\"Heart Of Stone\\", yknow?, except HERE the Stones MEAN it!    A vicious album; yet not angry in delivery: The Stones know who's boss. (60's rock stars!)    My fave Stones album easily, after this I'd say --well first you need at least \\"Hot Rocks\\" or something, a best-of, covering the 60's. Then this, and then, well, the merits of Got Live If You Want It is widely debated, but I think it's great, just give me the old stereo mix with just Mick's vocals and handclaps in the right channel, and the band in the left, and you've got the next best album.    I don't care less what they're doing now, they've been miserable for the most part after the 60s, although especially after It's Only Rock n Roll (and the incredible live period with Mick Taylor, their best guitarist ever, forget Richards next to HIM!). Plus, after Tattoo You, nothing by them is any good.    Their peak, really. From the best year in popular rock and roll music, 1966, coincidentally when the bands influenced by the Stones were legion.    Your best choice after a greatest hits for one of their 60s albums, much better than those that preceded it, or came after.

B00008OWZC|5.0|Not that you needed another five-star review to think about getting this, but I have to chime in.  This is one of the finest live albums I've ever heard.  Zep were in their prime here (the material for this album was taken from two concerts in June of 1972, one in Inglewood and one in Long Beach) and boy, does it show.  My favorite song on the album is \\"Bron-Yr-Aur Stomp\\" which the fellas play with a great deal of energy and the appreciative crowd enthusiastically claps along.  Their big hits from that era are here, like \\"Black Dog\\", \\"Rock And Roll\\", \\"Immigrant Song\\", and of course \\"Stairway To Heaven.\\"  If you're even kind of a Zep fan, this album is absolutely essential.
B0001ARCFA|5.0|Coming from a pair of enclosed Sony headphones I originally thought the bass response was too light. However, after listening to professionally mastered tracks and building tunes from the ground up on these headphones, I rate them highly. They give a very even flat response which is what you want in a pair of headphones for monitoring. I like to use these in combination with my closed headphones, crappy computer speakers, and car stereo when mixing down and mastering tracks. I can say that since I started using these my tunes have sounded better (not too much bass or overly loud elements) and more even in different listening enviornments.<br /><br />I've only used two other headphones other than these for monitoring so my experience is limited in comparison to others.
B0000203YT|5.0|Watch this video. Start your journey today. Find out what Shakespeare has brought to the world. Okay, so this movie might not please the academics and the purists, but so what. Stoppard has put enough stuff here to please the wiser sort, yeah. The part about the rat and John Webster being just one of 'em.<br />The rest of the film is pure joy. You'll be swept along by Paltrow's earnest performance and Fiennes' certain charm as the bard and Romeo. Geoffrey Rush is mucho supremo--this guy could act as Casanova Frankenstein, and still be wonderful.
0756404746|5.0|I was surfing amazon for a book I could buy in our local store and I found a link for this book. The book is great!! The only downside is that book 2 is still far off. I recommend this book to anyone with an open imagination.
B000TXNDUW|4.0|Breathless is a great example of French New Wave, a film with innovative camerawork and editing. It does not resemble the majority of films made previous to it which is why it is interesting. Jean Luc Godard was one of several filmmakers who felt that movies were getting stale, so he attempted to rejuvinate the medium.<br /><br />Michel Poiccard (Jean-Paul Belmondo) kills a cop after stealing a car. He overreacted but now needs to play it cool to avoid detection. He is a wanted man, but he steals cars left and right and persues a beautiful American girl (Jean Seberg) instead of fleeing the country. She is ambivalent about him, but the two spend a lot of time together. Their conversations are the most enjoyable parts of the movie, especially the one in her apartment.<br /><br />A simple movie that sometimes feels like sneaking into a stranger's conversation, Breathless is highly enjoyable. It was made on a modest budget, but it comes off as being slick and interesting.<br /><br />This DVD edition has an extra disk just brimming over with special features. For die hard fans, this is essential.
B000OV170W|4.0|This is a really touching book, there are so many true emotions that suck you in that prove how talented Picoult is. It is intense, fast-paced and just when you think you know how the story is going to end, you are proved wrong. My Sister's Keeper is a great book for book clubs because there are so many topics that you can discuss and debate what you would have done if you were put into the situation. It isn't my favorite book, and I liked Picoult's Vanishing Acts better, but it is written so well you can't help but like it, even if the ending wasn't quite what I would have hoped it would have been. I would recommend this book to anyone who appreciates good literature or has been going through a medical crises of their own.
B00104QSOM|3.0|This film had a lot of potential but I found it ultimately disappointing. The story basically follows Daniel Plainview, a harsh, rags to riches oilman who makes his fortune by drilling in the vast deserts of the early 20th century American West. Daniel is an ambitious but disturbed character and by the end of the film he appears to have completely lost his mind. The film is beautifully shot with some decent acting, but I just couldn't really get into it. It has it's moments for sure, but a weak story line and somewhat exaggerated premise ruined it for me. I'm not sure if it was just a story, or if it is trying to make some larger social point. If it's the latter, what's the point? Oil makes you crazy? Greed makes you crazy? This seems to be a bit of a stretch.<br /><br />I will defend Daniel Day-Lewis to the death as a tremendous actor, and he is impressively intense as usual here, but he didn't have much to work with in the way of a script. The film was pretty weak in that regard. All in all, this film could have been great, but in my eyes, it fell way short of the mark. 3.5 stars.
B000XA5K48|4.0|Great action movie acting...a shameless celebration of bullets, guns, gratuitous violence with a twist of intrigue... chuckle under your breath dark humour. It does for carrots what poppey did for spinach. Monica belucci is incredibly well casted....[why does she always play the whore so WELL??], Clive Owen is sardonically brilliant, the villains look bad, talk bad and shoot bad....fun, adrenalin packed, filthy-good pop art. Loved it...Great stunts, well written short lines...SHOOT 'EM UP...makes Rambo look like a pussy..!!
B000000XB9|5.0|Creedence Clearwater Revival, a band far ahead of its time, hailed from California, but one would never know it. As a Louisiana native I can attest to the fact that CCR represents the sounds of the south as well, if not better, than any home grown \\" Southern Rock\\" outfit. The Bayou clearly courses through John Fogerty's veins, regardless of  his geography.<br /><br />This is a \\"Best of\\" that truly spans a remarkable career. The band had a short run ( their most prolific period occurring between 1968 t0 1970), but the talent produced a back catalog of amazing proportion. One rarely likes to recommend a survey when a tremendous library is available, but this work deserves a place at the table.<br /><br />The songs.... they are three to eleven minute vignettes of pure blues/rock/country-pop magic. Activist by nature, Fogerty wrote some scathing time-piece tunes, like \\" Fortunate Son\\" and \\" Commotion\\", two fine offerings from this CD. \\"Susie Q\\", a gem from Lightnin' Hopkin's treasure trove, drives home a beat and guitar working second to none. \\" I Heard it Throuh the Grapevine\\" gets a unique overhaul, quite different from the original in its bluesy delivery. \\" Lookin' Out My Backdoor\\" and \\" Down on the Corner\\" takes the listener on a quick, sweet journey to the parts of Dixie that are worth experiencing. An innocent, open, fun-loving atmosphere, not qualities usually associated with the south by people from other regions. A transplanted native, even one who was better for the move, can wax poetically about southern summers, remembering fondly \\"listin' to Buck Owens\\" while \\" doing cartwheels\\", or gathering around the local busker to hear someone like \\" the poor boys\\" strut their stuff.<br /><br />The track list is exhaustive, including all of the hits, plus a few lesser known wonders, such as \\" Sweet Hitchhiker\\". Fogerty and the gang didn't solve the world's problems during their heyday, but they sure provided some good music to rock out to. If unfamiliar with CCR, get thee a copy of this singularly  great Greatest Hits.... pronto.ngularly  great Greatest Hits.... pronto.
B000MXPE7O|1.0|I appreciate, love and respect every single key actor in this movie...but still I found it insufferably long and dull. I love political intrigue, wordy movies and am a fan of theatre, Silence of the Lambs was a great movie. Casino Royale great....But Dear Jesus, how this movie tested my patience!! I am not a person to fall asleep during movies. Usually my curiosity keeps me awake long enough...I could not survive THIS movie.
B00005JXY3|5.0|I thought the 1st \\"Karate Kid\\" was excellent, and I think II is an EXCELLENT followup. In Part 1, we learned about Daniel and his situation. 2 takes it to the next level. After meet Daniel, we soon learn more about Myagi. (To the next level!) Myagi learns that his father (still in Japan) is very ill. While this is hard enough of a trip to make, Myagi realizes that he also has to risk running into an old friend who has an unresolved dispute with him. (Great expansion of myagi's past!)<br /><br />Daniel of course feels that it is his duty to go with Myagi and be there for Myagi as Myagi was there for him in Part 1. (Great growth from Daniel!) Daniel and Myagi arrive in Japan. The photography there is beautiful!<br /><br />I may add that in Part 1, Daniel learned karate. Now he is learning culture. (Better still!) Myagi runs into his enemy (once friend) Sato. Naturally, the tensions arise. Sato wants to fight Myagi over a conflict that happened many years ago that put his honor into question. Myagi would rather let bygones be bygones. Despite Sato's coldness and brutality, we never forget that he has some redeeming points. And we are probably hoping that these 2 will reconcile, rather than fight.<br /><br />Sato's # 1 student Chozen persues Daniel in hopes of forcing Myagi to fight Sato. While Daniel triumphed over the Cobra Kais in Part 1, Chozen proves himself to be a notably worse threat. The Cobra Kais were nasty people, but they weren't willing to kill Daniel. Chozen is. (Nice rise of tension!) I may also add that Chozen would trash Johnny, Kreese, Terry Silver, Mike Barnes, or Colonel Dugan.<br /><br />If I say much more, I'll probably ruin the movie for those of you who have not seen it. But I can say that the 'unseen hand' comes in and makes some reconciliation possible. Daniel also goes from fighting in a tournamentto a battle where the stakes are life and death.<br /><br />I call this sequel phenomenal, because not only does it avoid repeating part 1, it takes things to the next level and provides interesting new surprises.des interesting new surprises.
B0015D3Z4O|4.0|Madonna is the Queen of Reinvention...except when it comes to Hard Candy.  She may have reinvented her look for an album cover, but the music on Hard Candy is nothing new, nothing ground-breaking, nothing innovative.  To quote her hit song, \\"Sorry\\", I've heard it all before...and it's called The Sweet Escape or Loose.  But aside from this little rehash, Hard Candy is a pretty decent album that is friendly to the ears and fun to dance to.    The producers of choice here are Pharrell Williams and the dynamic duo of Timbaland & Justin Timberlake.  While it's the latter team that's getting all the press, Pharrell's tracks completely outshine the Timbaland/Timberlake ones.  The album opens with the fun \\"Candy Shop\\", which sets the mood for the record, before launching into simplistic dance music that you can't help but adore.  Lead single \\"4 Minutes\\" is in there, but it's really the oddball track of the album.  For a better listen, try the zany \\"Give It 2 Me\\", the groovy \\"Heartbeat\\", the thumping \\"Beat Goes On\\", or the haunting and exceptional \\"Devil Wouldn't Recognize You\\".  Fans of the Madonna ballad will no doubt love \\"Miles Away\\", which is probably the most typically Madonna track on the whole album.    While listening to the record, it's obvious that Madonna doesn't have the strongest vocals.  In fact, I daresay these are the worst since the out-of-tune I'm Breathless album.  But it's not about that here.  The music is done so exceptionally that it becomes more about the overall package than vocals alone.  Unlike, say, Mariah Carey, Madonna doesn't rely on her vocal prowess to carry the record.  This works best for her, and the result is a dancy, catchy album that's all about...well, dancing!    As a dance record, it's probably the best one out there.  As a Madonna record, it's just okay.  Madonna fans who will undoubtedly compare to her past triumphs won't find it as cutting-edge as Music or as deep as Ray of Light or American Life.  And while Hard Candy features plenty of retro, it's not the homage to the 70's that Confessions on a Dance Floor was.  Hard Candy may not be the greatest Madonna album, but it's definitely a strong moment in the 25-year-long career of the still-undisputed Queen of Pop!
B000000W5P|5.0|this is a nice album. there are nice songs on this album. the cover art is nice. the cut-out jacket with the interchangeable sleeve promotes an element of fun. the musical contributors are very talented with their upbeat songs and childish humor. the singer is particularly enthusiastic with finger-snapping guitar music.
B00127RAJY|5.0|These work outs are not for the faint hearted - Jillian manages to push you at every level - the best workout ever, packed into 20 mins.
B000002IPZ|4.0|After three excellent releases Testament brings us Souls of Black. Probably my favorite album cover from Testament. Oh yeah, the music.<br />I remember when this came out. I was quite surprised that it came out so soon after Practice What You Preach. And it shows. Yes, the disc is awesome. Everything I came to love from Testament. But it had a rushed feeling to it. It basically copied the formula from Practice but didn't do anything to advance their status as a thrash pioneer. If they had taken another year to really work on this album it would have solidified Testament's place in the top tier of thrash bands. Sadly it all goes down hill after this release. Still, Souls of Black is a must have for and metal head. No collection is complete without it.
0060512806|5.0|This is a staggeringly clever book, extremely well written.  Not an easy read, but so funny and insightful that one never minds the effort.  Carry it everywhere and savor it slowly.
B000001C6M|5.0|The big four. Slayer,Metallica,Megadeth, and Anthrax. Scratch Anthrax, I never liked them anyway. Replace them with Testament. Slayer has consistently released quality album after album starting with this one. A masterpeice that has withstood the test of time. From start to finish. Brutal,evil,scary, everything metal should be. Slayer has only, after 25 years started to be recognized for their contributions. And it's about time. If your new to Slayer, this is a great place to start.
0007105045|5.0|This collection should be on the shelf of any admirer of JRTT. The pieces, which vary in medium (poetry, short story, essay) are actually strikingly similar in content -- you cannot read them without coming to better understand what Tolkien himself was after in his writing of LOTR. 'Leaf by Niggle' is simply a beautiful and fun short story to which no artist -- or lover of life -- could be deaf. It's Tolkien's story about himself, really. The poem 'Mythopoeia' deserves several read throughs -- it took me a while, but once it starts to become clear, it won't let go. And of course, this collection includes the famous lecture \\"On Fairy Stories\\" -- which will help you to better understand not only JRRT, but also CS Lewis (see: 'Tree of Tales', ed Hart)
B000002IMG|5.0|Testament's second album was an advance similar to the jump Metallica made from Kill Em All to Ride The Lightning. The music matured, as did the lyrics. Powerful, angry, melodic. It was The Legacy but much more mature. A must have for any Testament fan. And a must have for any of the new kids who would like to find out where todays bands got their inspiration from.
0316166685|3.0|The novel's premise is interesting: Teenaged Susie is raped and murdered on her way home from school, and watches the effect that her life and death have on her family. The novel really drives home the brutal truth about what murder does to a victim's family: that there IS no \\"closure\\", ever.<br /><br />I kept reading because I hoped that, at the least, Susie's murderer would be brought to justice or perhaps her remains found; this doesn't happen, and what she knew has her family slowly disintegrates.<br /><br />The book drives home the brutality of murder, especially on young victims, and effectively portrays the pain suffered by loved ones...but I found it so disturbing that I really wish I hadn't read it.
015601386X|5.0|I love this book! It's a classic for any children's book collection and it's one of the few German-language books available in the States. I'm a MS & HS German teacher and I use this book with my higher classes. They can read it entirely in German, use the pictures for clues, and enjoy the plot. A must have!
6304479689|5.0|Hello to all Elvis Fans. I purchased this VHS and reviewed it i must say it was everything i thought it would be. I am so glad that i have this even though it's on VHS it is a great video and lots of great performances by Elvis. If you don't have this by all means get it before it goes away for good. I don't think this will ever be on DVD and if it is it may not be the same quality as it is on the VHS. Every Elvis collector should have this in your collection. To see all the cities and the excited fans waiting to see him in concert and for a time you forget that this is a video you are watching because you get caught up in the excitement of Elvis going on stage and 2001 Space Odessy is playing and you know he is about to appear. Buy it before it's to late to me it doesn't matter if it's on VHS i'm glad i purchased it for my collection before it no longer exist.    Anne
B0002858YS|4.0|This is a very good band. Hey, let's be honest and say they're a great band, IMO. Hot Fuss is a good CD from a GREAT BAND! I've been hooked from the first time I heard there music and I still am today.    Jeff
B0000025L0|5.0|What can I add to this list of glowing reviews? everything has been said, and I cannot agree more. This is a great jazz-rock album, perhaps erasing the lines between fusion and jazz-rock, if there ever were any? Anyway, great playing, especially keyboard/guitar. Amazing drumming also. Bass, great of course, although I am am not a fan of bass as solo instrument. Nevertheless, if you like fusion as much as I do, chops aside, this album is a very charming specimen of the genre. Someone said of fusion that it is a sunny street where funk, classical, jazz and rock live happily together. They appear to be most happy on School Days. Giddit!
B0000009SM|4.0|One Size fits all is one of the albums created by zappa's 1973-1975 band.  This band is considered by most fans to be Zappa's most musically adept band ever.   One Size definitely shows this.  The band is extrodinarily tight, and consists of superb musicians such as: George Duke (jazz pianist), Johnny Guitar Watson (r&b guitarist), Captain Beefheart (rock?), and the great Tom Fowler (Bass Guitarist).    THIS IS NOT A JAZZ/ROCK ALBUM OR A JAZZY ALBUM.    The reason for me writing this review was to debunk the popular myth that this is a jazz fusion album.  -The music doesn't swing (the rythms are not jazzy at all), it does not have horns, the chords are not complex, and the chord progressions have a rock feel.    -Inca Roads may be a bit of an exception.  The rythms are very complex, and there is a somewhat jazzy keyboard solo.  But for the most part, this song cannot be catagorized at all.  -Can't Afford no Shoes is a charming peice with a heavy beat (emphasizes downbeats AKA: opposite of jazz).  It's a Blues/Rock tune with a bombastic feel  -Sofa No.1- a charming peice.  It is a VERY SIMPLE waltz, with a typical chord progression. Draws from Classical influences.  -Pojama People - another blues/rock tune with a blistering, heavy bluesy guitar solo.  -Florentine Pogen- Cannot be described. Typical Zappa. some odd rythms.  -Evelyn, a modified dog- A VERY dull tune (hence the 4 stars instead of 5), with a harpsicord and voice. Draws from Classical influences.  -San Berdino- A LONG blues/rock tune with a heavy beat.  -Andy- Another LONG blues/rock tune with a heavy beat.  -Sofa No.2 - sofa no.1 with words    The majority of the album are the blues/rock influenced tunes.  So if one HAS to classify this album (one should not classify Zappa), it would be much more accurate to label it as a Blues/Rock album instead of a Jazz Fusion album.
B000002JOH|5.0|This was the best of all Pantera's work, I love all the albums but this one hands down is the best. I would rate this album with Slayer's South of Heaven, Black Sabbath's Paranoid, Metallica's Master of Puppets, or Anthrax's Among the Living!! This is real metal raw and in your face, the way it should be!! There's a lot to love on this album Phil's piss & vinegar vocals, and Dimebags (R.I.P.) skull crushing guitar work. Mouth for War, Walk, and By Demons Be Driven will having your grinning in sinister delight!! Grab a copy of this album, and let your aggression flow!!
0452285186|1.0|Bunnies are sweet,loving,and innocent creatures and anyone who could write books with this sort of theme is a very sick person as are everyone who would find it funny!! If it was about children there would be a major outcry over it,but because its not its ok. Animals are just as helpless as children so if you wouldn't want books like this about children don't condone it about bunnies or any other animals!!
B000001FTD|5.0|This album is the best of Anthrax. Belladonna's high flying vocals, Benante's pounding drums, and Scott Ian's punch you in your face guitar work make this a thrash metal classic!! Classic songs like Caught In A Mosh, I Am The Law, and the title track are speed metal anthems!! Enjoy!!, I sure as hell did!!
0340834048|1.0|The sicko who wrote this series would not have had it published if it had been written about children and the sickos who find it funny would not find it amusing if it was about children!! Bunnies and other animals are helpless creatures so don't write or read/condone sick stuff written about them if you wouldn't read/condone the same stuff about children!!
B000002LUB|5.0|This is one of the best Sab albums to come along for a long time!! This album reunites the Mob Rules line up Iommi, Butler, Appice, and Dio. This album is a classic, and should be up there with the likes of Paranoid and Heaven and Hell. Great blistering vocals by Dio, and blazing Iommi riffs. There's not a ballad in sight on this album, just straight up metal from Sab. Dio is my favorite vocalists with the exception of Ozzy, and he rightfully belongs in Black Sabbath. Great album you won't be disappointed!!
B000YABYLA|4.0|To be perfectly honest, I'm not sure what Juno is supposed to be. If it was intended as a true-to-life story of teenage pregnancy, then it's almost certainly a failure. The film's titular sixteen-year-old protagonist is the luckiest teen mom in the history of humanity; her parents are completely supportive, the father is hopelessly in love with her, and there's even a nice yuppie couple that's willing to take the little tyke off of her hands. And that's only because Juno decided not to have an abortion, which also would have been fine with all concerned parties. Which isn't to say that it's all sunshine and flowers for the girl (at one point, she even cries real tears!), but it is safe to determine that the movie romanticizes all of the anguish out of teen pregnancy. A female friend of mine jokingly remarked that watching Juno made her want to rush right out and get knocked up. Similarly, Juno isn't much of a coming-of-age story. That genre demands that its characters be challenged,     So why the not-too-shabby rating? Well, I like to look on the bright side of things. I see Juno as a vehicle for some great characters and fantastic acting. Of course, Ellen Page steals the show with her generation-defining take on the title role. Her performance is just plain completely wonderful, full of humor and warmth and intelligence and charm. The character itself is a fantastic creation, an endearing balance of coy sarcasm and raw vulnerability hidden under a charming sheen of pop-culture references and smart teenage cool. She's what every sixteen-year-old kid with an above average IQ wishes they could be (Trust me, I tried but couldn't pull it off). Other highlights include Mark and Vanessa (played ably by Jason Bateman and Jennifer Garner), the complex, shifty, but ultimately sympathetic adoptive parents of Juno's kid. There's also Michael Cera, whose portrayal of the meek, endearingly awkward father provides a great foil to Juno's quiet strength. Throw in a duo of goofy parents (yes, Allison Janney and J.K. Simmons are great), a pleasantly ditzy best friend (Olivia Thrilby), and a hilarious appearance by Rainn Wilson, and you've got yourself an irresistible cast of characters.    In the end, I see Juno (film and character) as a female counterpart to boy-driven smart teen comedies like The Breakfast Club and Charlie Bartlett. Its subject matter isn't handled perfectly, but its humor and charm are spot-on.
B000Y7ZHCU|3.0|I have been waiting for this dvd to be released for a long time and when it finally was I was not impresed. This is just another concert and great dancers but if you want to see an spectacular show look for Madonna's Blond Ambition or the Confessions Tour.
B00151G08Y|4.0|Im giving Pendulums in silico 4/5 stars... only because its not as Drum and Bass, as Pendulum's last album \\"hold your colour\\" or \\"jungle sound gold\\" Pendulum in moving in a different direction with this new hybrid sound however they still have some DNB roots in some of their tracks.. It took me a while to warm up to the new sound that pendulum is producing...  I miss those heavy hard hitting DNB tracks pendulum had in \\"hold your colour\\" If you are completely in the Dark about the whole DNB genre give this CD a go...

B0014I4KIK|4.0|I had heard Duffy's \\"Rockferry\\" a few months ago when it came out in the UK and immediately liked the song and her voice.  After to listening to the cd I do like it as a whole.  She's sort of Dusty Springfield meets Amy Winehouse without the lesbianism, alcohol and drug abuse (or at least for now, who knows she could self-destruct down the line).  Her voice has that raspy quality that is prevalent in a number of the blue-eyed soul ladies coming out of the UK now (Adele, Gabriella Cilmi, Ms. Winehouse, Estelle to name a few).  60's soul sounding songs with a modern take seem to be a big thing over there and every now and then one of those artists does breakthrough over here and I hope Duffy will take off.  This is a good first effort I look forward to seeing how things go for her.

159102594X|5.0|My first review... I loved this book so much, I just had to share. I'll skip the synopsis. Lately, it seems as though I'm always looking for something to read until the next Song of Ice and Fire book comes out, with quite a few half-read books on the shelf stored under the 'Disappointing' category. Not so for The First Law trilogy. I wasn't expecting much, but this trilogy was extremely entertaining.    Written in first person narrative for several well drawn-out characters. Gritty, dark, although not as dark as Martin, funny, very enjoyable! I absolutely loved the characters, especially Logen Ninefingers and Glokta... I never thought I would actually feel sympathy for a torturer! I enjoyed these books from the first page to the very last line, which I can't get out of my head now, honest to goodness Laugh-Out-Loud!     I loved the first two books so much, I ordered the third book through Amazon.uk... as of this writing it isn't yet published in the US. Bravo Joe Abercrombie!
0446401307|3.0|Harry Bosch is now assigned to Homicide Special: waiting for cases that are politically sensitive, have a level of media interest, or are just too hot for the regular LAPD to handle.  Harry's first case with Homicide Special, it quickly becomes apparent, combines all three of these ingredients.<br /><br />An execution style murder, the theft of significant quantities of a potentially deadly radioactive chemical and the involvement of multiple agencies all place pressure on Harry's capacity to work the murder case effectively.  Harry himself is dedicated to finding the murderer while those in the agencies around him are intent on exploring terrorist possibilities.  Harry, of course, is not above  redefining co-operation to suit the needs of his case and, by following the evidence rather than speculation solves the murder. A case, perhaps, for the straightforward application of `all other things being equal, the simplest solution is the best' (the principle known as `Occam's Razor').<br /><br />I enjoyed this relatively short Harry Bosch story. While it lacks some of the detailed writing of other Bosch novels, it was a great way to spend a couple of spare hours.  While I worked out aspects of the solution before the end of the novel, there were sufficient loose ends to keep my attention until the end.<br /><br />Jennifer Cameron-Smith
0767827716|1.0|The reason I love John Carpenter is his movies are entertaining.  They may be scary, creepy, atmospheric, funny, whatever but generally entertaining.       Today I just finished watching Christine for the second time and for the first time in many many years.  Boring.  Not scary, not creepy, not atmospheric, not funny. Not anything but boring.  Boring.    I suppose if I believed in supernatural cars this might do something for me.  But I don't and it doesn't.   In my opinion if one goes through the Carpenter canon in chronological order this would be his first dud.   Even the usual great Carpenter music that accompanied so many of his movies back then is missing.  He relies on commercial hits of the past.    A dud.  Did I mention the acting is horrid?  The acting is horrid.  Unless you are a completist or it does not take much to entertain you, I would say avoid this dud.  Disappointing to say the least.
006135323X|5.0|I really enjoyed reading this book (which is a big plus to start with - after all a book should at the very least achieve this goal right?).  I found the research examples thought provoking, they caused me to consciously examine some of my decisions and decisions of those around me and it gave a new perspective in a lot of cases.    Definitely a recommended read - great job Dan (and all those who contributed to this book).
B00000GV55|4.0|This reminds me of those 70's detective tv movies, where the weird and wacky soundtrack jived and jostled all over the place; then Peter Falk would solve the most unlikely of murders, besieged it seemed, by belligerent superiors and zany camera angles.<br /><br />The celluloid connection is important in my little world. If music is 'cinematic' then it goes up a notch in my estimation. If it's vast and complex (like Thomas Leer) or dynamic and sexy (like Dollar) the stars on this antiquated review points system are dripping atop each other like so many clicking poker chips.<br /><br />Music should be about surprises, about little sound-deceits  that play quick tricks with the ear. Startle the brain, stimulate, give pleasure (so much music is designed to do the opposite), be fun!<br />I love surprises. Count those stars and you'll see just how much 'Leg End' is the desired artifact. I spend a lot of time seeking out this type of stuff. Challenging-in-a-good-sense. Talented people who don't think banging things constitutes 'art', and scoff derisorily at the simpletons who do. (And there's load's of 'them')<br /><br />I can't work out whether Henry Cow are snobs looking down their noses, or lads having a laugh.<br />Either's fine.<br />The music at the end of whatever process they're employing is outstanding in every sense - not the only validation they achieve. A deserved vindication.<br /><br />I'm not as converse with some of this stuff as I'd like to think. It's a misnomer of sorts, this reviewing thing. There's only so much to say, only so much emotion energized by the surging brass and blistering percussion.<br /><br />I'm staggered as to how good this is. From a sympathetic position anyway, I got myself further and further embroiled in it with each delirious spin. What kind of people make a marvelous music like this, then call themselves Henry Cow?<br />A decent vorticist would be in raptures.<br /><br />Is it rock or jazz or what I hear you ask, there is no defining answer to that. If you need to ask, you may also need to ask if Henry Cow are really for you.<br />Too radical? Too revolutionary? Too unpredictable....<br /><br />And fun(ny!). I've decided Henry Cow are neither snobs nor lay-a-bouts, they occupy a middle ground, bound to other musics only by huge swathes of time and distance. On the middle, but pushed so far forward as to become existential.<br />A music which throbs with this much originality, warmth and humour doesn't belong with the plebs and charlatans you usually find festering under the 'experimental' umbrella. (more like a toadstool actually, chortle!)<br /><br />And the socks? Your guess is as good as mine on that one.

159102594X|5.0|I picked up the books THE BLADE ITSELF and BEFORE THEY ARE HANGED several months ago and I have to tell you, I miss the characters from these books more than I miss a lot of people I've known. I poured through the books in pretty short order. I found the pacing was fast, the story was highly entertaining, and the settings were vivid and believable. Then, like most books I've read, I set them aside and moved on to something else. But unlike most other books, these keep creeping back into my thoughts on almost a daily basis.<br /><br />Joe Abercrombie wrote these books from the perspective of several different and fascinating characters, each with their own set of issues and problems. All the characters in the book are fully realized, complex individuals that are an absolute pleasure to love or hate, as you see fit. Even the most minor of characters are uniquely written and entertaining; many of them will make you squirm in your seat and all will make you want to turn to the next page.<br /><br />There's Logan Ninefingers, the northern barbarian who is one of the most likable and grounded of people, except of course when turns into a berserker, known and feared far and wide as \\"The Bloody Nine.\\"<br /><br />San Dan Glotka is a complex, cunning and dangerous ex-officer of the Army who was captured by the enemy, brutally tortured for years, and left a cripple. His total cynicism and contempt has him seeing conspiracies and assassins around every corner, and makes him the perfect inquisitor for the Union!<br /><br />And There's Bayaz; the impossibly old first mage with tremendous powers, who gathers a group of disparate individuals together to further his own private agenda. Not only is he the center one of the major story arcs, but he supplies this fascinating world with a rich and compelling back story that rivals Middle Earth in complexity and wonder.<br /><br />I could go on with many more biographies, but my point is made. The story is very good on all counts. Set against the backdrop of impending war on two fronts, the books wind through perilous journeys, doomed battles, ill-fated love affairs, political and economic intrigue, tournaments for glory, and thousand year old rivalries between the world's remaining mages. But in the end, it's the characters that you will remember. As I said in the beginning, hardly a day goes by that I don't ponder the fate of the Dogman, Ferro, Jezal, and Colonel West.<br /><br />I highly recommend both books and I cannot wait to get my hands on the third installment, LAST ARGUMENT OF KINGS. Joe Abercrombie is an author to watch.n two fronts, the books wind through perilous journeys, doomed battles, ill-fated love affairs, political and economic intrigue, tournaments for glory, and thousand year old rivalries between the world's remaining mages.

B0010VD7EO|4.0|It's tough to place this group and album in a genre - and that's refreshing. Certainly the group relies heavy upon electronic sound, but they're not really electronica. They have a very 70s rock-opera vibe but with a modern approach.<br /><br />Many of the songs are quite catchy, although some (4th Dimensional Trnsition) are quite psychedelic. The music is heavily layered and rich, making an album that's fun to listen to again and again.<br /><br />The duo's vocals and lyrics are quirky, but work well overall.
0800141660|5.0|That such a classic should be not only brought to the screen, but in such as way as to be better than the book is just remarkable. Emma Thompson and Alan Rickman are pure magic, and Hugh Grant is excellent also. The countryside will make you think you're back in early 1800 England. Truly remarkable.

B00006RAKP|2.0|Elton John,...is terrible on this disc. The songs, \\"Melou, Melou\\", \\"Bride with Red\\", \\"Threaten Love Bast\\" and etc, are just too tedious to non Elton Fans. A complete waste of time if you don't read his books first.
B000LPQ6DE|2.0|I can not believe how many people wrote raving reviews about this movie  But let's start with good points- cinematography is simply beautiful  Second- Ruth Wilson is excellent as Jane, and she is \\"easy on the eye\\", unlike Zelah Clark in 1983 version. Unfortunately, the script is poor, and Ruth Wilson did not have much to work with.    Next- Toby Stephens- what can I say- nobody can play Mr. Edward Fairfax Rochester to the perection that Timothy Dalton did. Timothy Dalton is simply the gold standard , and , in my opinion, he will be etched in the eternity as the definitive  Mr. Rochester:-))    But my main grievance about this movie is as follows- the scriptwriters BUTCHERED the beautiful, witty, eloquent dialogues created by Charlotte Bronte  In my opinion, the dialogues are the most important part of this classical book.  Just think of it- there must be a reason why this book has become a classical masterpiece of the English literature, and the reason is- eloquent prose of Charlotte Bronte  How can anyone think that they can do a BETTER job writing lines of the dialogues than the MASTER???  Apparently, these scriptwriters did, and they have no excuse, because with the 4-5 hours of screentime, they had enough room to keep all the important lines and events. They substituted beautiful, eloquent lines with insipid, meaningless phrases...    But you have to read a book to fully understand what have they done to this beautiful masterpiece, absolutely no justice at all.  My advise- watch this movie just for the good cinematography, and a very cute Jane( in my opinion, Ruth wilson is beautiful, not in the classical sense, but nevertheless), but do not expect a masterpiece from this very poor version of Jane Eyre

159102594X|5.0|Logen Ninefingers is a Northman who has had a long history of blood and battles, too long for his liking, yet there is no rest for the weary.  We meet him in the middle of fighting and trying to survive the non-human Shanka who have wiped out his people.  When it looks as if they have wiped out his men, he turns from battles and the mountains of his home and heads south where he senses a new destiny awaits:  a Mage is looking for him.<br /><br />Bayaz is the First of the Magi, an ancient who has appeared from time to time in the history of Midderland and the Union.  Now, however, magic is virtually unknown in the Union and belief in even its early history is lost.  Nonetheless, Bayaz is on a quest, one that involves the breaking of the First Law of the Magi, that of touching the Otherworld.  Logan Ninefingers is willing to accompany Bayaz, as a change of pace and a new direction, although the battles do not cease.<br /><br />In the great capital city of Adua, Inquisitor Sand dan Glokta, once a promising young noble, swordsman and soldier before 2 years of torture in the Emperor of Gurkhal's dungeons after being captured during battle has left him crippled and maimed, does his duty rooting out criminals and traitors.  Barely alive, torture is one thing he now knows well, and he is the brains behind the muscle of his Practicals, his aides.  He has caught the eye of the head of King's Inquisitors, the Arch Lector, and is drawn into political moves against the powerful Guild of Mercers and certain allies on the Councils that rule the Union in lieu of the feeble-minded King.  But in the face of growing threats from the North, with the upstart King of Angland, ostensibly a part of the Union, and the growing power of the new Emperor in the Union's old adversary, the empire of Gurkhal, are these political moves aiding the Union or weakening it?  And does the massively cynical Glokta even care enough to feel it matters?<br /><br />The Union has grown soft and decadent, ruled by effete aristocrats interested only in maintaining their luxurious wealth and power.  Captain Jezal dan Luthar seems to epitomize this.  He will compete in the all-important Contest (fencing), where his name will be made, mostly to please his father and discomfit his brothers, but he's lazy in training, worrying mostly about winning money from his friends at cards and carousing.  Politics and trouble in the North and in Gurkhal are things he'd rather not think about.  One who does capture his thoughts is the commoner sister of his superior officer and friend, Major West.  He is not sure why he should be so attracted to someone so unsuitable, but he is.<br /><br />The characters and the world and their situations are utterly fascinating.  The actual plot is just beginning in this book, which is the first in a series, and although the overall plot advances slowly and is not resolved at all by the end, there is so much action and characterization and detail that it doesn't matter; rather it makes it even better to look forward to the next books in this curious tale.<br /><br />While the basic elements are nothing new in fantasy:  the torturer, the old warrior, the ancient mage, the want-to-be-hero who has much to prove, the battles and the intrigues and incipient war; the gritty, dark style, the brilliant characterization, the depth and detail of the world, the events and the secondary characters, the harrowing action scenes, all add up to an unforgettable read.<br /><br />I wasn't sure I would like this book, not being a huge fan of dark and gritty tales--with torture and violence and language, but the word of mouth and reviews were too good.  I am so glad I did not pass this up.  I will get a hold of the next book as soon as I can and will expect another engrossing read.interested only in maintaining their luxurious wealth and power.

1423101464|5.0|This is the fourth installment in this excellent series about half greek god, half human kids who must battle the Titans to save the world from destruction.

Halfbloods Percy and Annabeth, along with their friends Grover the Satyr and Tyson the Cyclops must navigate to Daedalus' workshop at the center of the labrinth so the can convince him not help the Titans find their camp and to help the good guys instead. Unfourtunately, not only is the Labrinth treacherous with a trap around every corner, Daedalus had already given the Titans a tool to navigate the Labrinth. The kids return to their camp and prepare to fight a battle. When the Titan army comes out of the Labrinth they are waiting and eventually they drive the Titan army out of the camp. But the triumph is short lived. Kronos, lord of the Titans, has reformed and is drawing more creatures into his army. Soon he will attack olympus but that is for the next book. This was an excellent read and all the stuff about greek myths made it very interesting. I would recomend this book to anyone.
B00003CXCQ|4.0|Simply put this is a super Disney classic, worth every dime I paid for it.  We purchased the movie because we were taking our three year old daughter to Disneyworld and she didn't even know who Snow White was because we couldn't rent the movie from a video store or the local library on DVD.  I grew up on the Disney princess movies, she's a little girl and should be able to enjoy all of the Disney movies while she is still little.  They need to re-release all of the Disney classics on DVD.  A generation of little ones are missing out.

You won't be disappointed, I sure wasn't! :)
B0014Z4OQG|3.0|I'm not a big fan of giant monster movies, though I don't hate them either.  I watched this mostly because I like J.J. Abrams, the producer.  The first twenty minutes or so are pretty boring, and I wanted to turn the movie off.  The cameraman, Hud, panning the audience during the party, created some moments of queasiness, but overall wasn't that bad - especially compared with later camera effects.  I found Hud to be really annoying and insensitive, and I found myself hoping he would die so I wouldn't have to listen to him anymore.    Other than the constant camera jerking, supposedly made to look like a hand-held video camera in a real-life situation (good job by the creators in making it real), I only found minor flaws, or things I didn't like for some reason.  Spoilers, so don't read if you want to be 100% surprised.    One, the head of the Statue of Liberty seems much too small when it comes flying down the street.  And all the people taking pictures of it?  I think I'd be running away from it.      Rob's need to run right past the monster (who is everywhere they turn) into the city to find his best friend, Beth, was believable on one level -he loves her, after all.  But, I think there comes a point when most people would cut their losses and run away.  Of course, if Rob did this, there wouldn't be a movie.      Beth's ability to run while seriously injured (down 57 flights of stairs, no less) amused me.  I felt she should have been carried or dragged more than she was.      Why is it that in every monster movie, the entire city has to cross a major bridge?  Don't they know the bridge will collapse for some reason?  I wanted to smack them all.  I realize they're on an island, but dang - this is very sterotypical.    One thing my husband pointed out that I was thinking also... Rob's phone call to his mother didn't seem emotional enough, but then he immediately broke down and became more emotional than Lilly.  It was weird that she was remaining more calm while hewas not.  Given the relationship in question, I can see why he was so upset, but something about the emotions didn't seem real.      Oh, and how the heck do they NOT see the monster (which I really liked the look of, by the way - I expected Godzilla and was surprised to see something new and creative) in broad daylight until it was standing right over Hud?  Several moments like this, even in the dark made me realize this was definitely a movie, not very realistic.  I think I would have seen that thing miles away, even in the dark, and not been surprised to find it so close to me.    All in all, I liked this.  I will probably never watch it again, though, because the camera angle really got to me.  My husband didn't have a problem with it - it really is subjective.  I recommend this movie to people who like suspense and haven't eaten recently or don't become easily nauseated.
B000056JYC|5.0|English guitar hero Peter Frampton's fifth album Frampton Comes Alive was released in January of 1976.<br />This album, over 32 years on, still rocks and does not only feature Frampton's great guitar solos and vocals and Stanley Sheldon's great bass playing but also showed us what great musicians the late John Siomos and Bob Mayo were. John was what Peter called \\"the John Bonham of his band\\" and John's death in January of 2004 was a sad moment and less then a month after John's passing keyboard player/occasional guitarist/backing vocalist Bob Mayo died of a heart attack in Switzerland while touring with Peter.

So, thanks again Isa & Chandra, VCTOTW impressed me so much, I just bought your Veganomicon book- cant wait to have fun w/ all your creative recipe creations.

This is probably the best album to come out of the Southern Rock movement.Pure gold.
B00144VBBS|5.0|This is an excellent collection at a low price.  The 35 tracks contain the majority of his hits from 1993 on.  We can always quibble over what should have been included or excluded or if She's a Hottie should be included.  However, there is over two hours of solid Toby Keith hits on two CDs for under forty cents a song.  That is real value and a hard buy to pass up.  Unless you have not listened to music since the 1990s, you have heard one of these songs.  A number of them are radio standards and will stay on the radio play lists for years.  Unless you can't stand the new Nashville sound, this is a great collection of songs that you will listen to again & again.
0385338724|5.0|What would happen if you woke up and could only remember from 2004 to the present? That's what happened to 27 year-old Lexi. She was in a car accident and when she awakes, she can only remember an accident where she fell 3 years previously, and everything else is blank. She can remember being in a club with her friends, Fi, Carolyn and Debs. They were drinking banana cocktails and Lexi was upset that Dave stood her up. Then she wakes up in the hospital. But what's amazing is that from the moment she can remember, everything changed. She had her teeth fixed and she went on a TV show called Ambition and met Eric. Eric is now her husband and she doesn't even know him. Then, at work, she got a huge promotion. Her friends Fi, Carolyn, and Debs now hate and ignore her. She has a new best friend, Rosalie. Her cute little sister has turned into a hellion and all her mother does is talk to her dogs. How did all of this happen? Will anyone help her fill in the blank spots and will she ever get her life back?<br /><br />Sophie Kinsella is SUCH a great author and this book is no exception. It's a book that anyone can enjoy. I felt for Lexi, because she woke up in this life that she has no idea about, decides to make the best of it and to figure out what happened to her. And she wants to figure out how she became \\"the cobra\\" at work and why everyone there hates her. She also meets Jon, an architect, who works with her husband, that she might have more to do with than she can imagine. All the characters are vivid and colorful. You'll hope Lexi can turn things around and remember everything. This is an awesome book and highly recommended read.<br /><br />REPOSTED FROM: [...]
B0002DB52M|5.0|Perfect...   I did not \\"want\\" to watch the movie, I have read some reviews here (those reviews 1 star). However I was feeling that I need to watch and have my own opinion. Bought it and watched it.  I strongly disagree with the \\"bad\\" reviews.   This film is 5 star for sure. Now it is in my very particular list of BEST FILMS EVER.
0393327655|1.0|I like to consider myself an athiest/agnostic. I bought this book thinking that it would be an interesting read. I did not like it- though he is correct that conflicts in the name of religion has caused many of the great wars in Western civilization and prior civilizations. I did not like his analysis of Islam- it used the typical fearmongering techniques that you see in the mainstream press. Most Muslims are normal people with ordinary lives and although he mentions this, he creates the idea that it is up to Western Civilization to rid of Islam due to association with terrorism. Does this author even understand why there is terrorism in the first place? It has little to do with the Islamic faith but everything to do with lack of opportunity, resources, and exploitation by western powers. Yet, Mr. Harris fails to take this into consideration. He considers Islam a very dangerous faith and that this world needs to fear Muslims. Moreover, he shows little compassion and sympathy for others who have been innocently victimized or killed by the War on Terror and attempts to reason his way through it- arguing that innocent people die everyday and if someone gets killed by a bombing from US forces then it is only an accident. B.S.! Thumbs down in my opinion. This book just feeds into the fear created by the mainstream media complex and the administration's justification for war. Do yourself a favor- read the 'God Delusion'. You are much better off for it. Not recommended at all.
0385340540|5.0|This book is by far the best book Grisham has written. The plotline was believable and the espionage was not hokey, as some authors can get when they don't really know what they're talking about. The plot was a l nail biter right until the end and then I was still sure that it wasn't over. I didn't want to put the book down, and managed to think about the character and upcoming events in the plotline driving to and from work.<br />The one thing that I didn't care for was the constant reference to language and the translation. I know that this was intended to make the book more real and involve the reader more, but in reality I found it tedious and irritating. If there were one thing I'd like to be changed, it would be this.<br />All in all, an excellent read. I feel I'm now going to be spoiled and thing that other John Grisham books aren't as good.
0812971825|5.0|This is a bittersweet novel of a pastor dealing with the death of his wife. His wife was not really \\"cut out\\" to be a pastor's wife, and she struggled with that role - and their marriage suffered because they didn't know how to look honestly at their struggles/challenges. And learning to look honestly at others and one's self is what the book captures best. It also conveys well the sense of life being puzzling.    It's a bit of the \\"academy award\\" winning, very deep kind of book - and has a significant focus on feelings. I tend to appreciate faster moving books - and ones where there is less sadness in the pages of things gone wrong. Nonetheless, there is hope in the book and winsome humour, nonetheless, and I'd definitely recommend it.
1904633013|5.0|I love this 'Collector's Library' too.  Yes, they used to have it in Barnes and Nobles but somehow they discontinued it.  It is a very small book but that's why I like it, I can carry it everywhere I go.
0142000671|5.0|Of Mice and Men is a novel based on the lives of two men, Lennie and George, who travel together. Lennie is a mentally unstable grown man, who acts like a child but has amazing strength-which inadvertantly gets him into trouble. After a misinterperated mishap in Weed, Lennie and George escape to avoid being lynched. They are left a long distance from their work after the driver of the bus on which they were travelling tells them that the distance is not far. Here is where we learn about Lennie's dream of living in their own house... which, at this point, is only a made up story to keep Lennie busy. The next morning, they travel to a working ranch, where they meet Slim, who is not the boss but seems to have the upper hand among the men, Candy, an old worker, Crooks, who works and is forced to live in the stables, and is mistreated because of the color of his skin, and Curley, a pugnacious character who also happens to be the boss's son. After a while, George begins to believe that the dream of owning a house could be possible, seeing how Candy offers to help to avoid being canned. Also, George confides in lim, telling him the story of himself and Lennie. As the story progresses, another mishap causes anger among the men, and forces George to make an important decision...
0452289963|5.0|I have read many inspirational books in the last decade and this is one of the books in my top list,for sure. You have to read a second or more times to get what it meant for YOU. Although it mentioned Biblical sayings,it actually is the essence of Buddhism, Zen,and other religion: When I carry water,I carry water; when I chop wood,I chop wood.If you do them and other daily routine and 'boring' chores with 'alert intention' or awareness,you are on your way to the next level, you don't need to go to seek out some guru at  the Himalayas! There are so many gems in this book that you really have to read slowly and stop reading frequently to sleep over it to get the message.
B0015XASFS|5.0|This is an incredible production of this concert.  I have seen this particular concert LIVE 4 times, and the DVD captures the essence of the concert.  So much superior to previous DVD's of Josh's live concerts.  If you haven't had the pleasure of seeing him live this is extremely close to being there!
B0002Z1EG2|5.0|I got the CD yesterday and I have not stopped listening to it.  I am planning to buy two more for family.  It is a very uplifting CD, just terrific!
B00092ZL80|5.0|It's amazing to see these two great bands together in a concert.  I recommend this DVD to everyone who loves their music. It's a spectacular concert.
0143038419|5.0|What a delightful book! I read it twice. Having been to Italy and Indonesia several times, I connected immediately to what Liz Gilbert had written, and I tended to breeze through India a bit too fast. That part was probably the most meaningful of the book and I'm glad I paid more attention the 2nd time around.  What an inspiring story. The author's style is easy to follow. It's one of the best books of the decade in my opinion!
B000VBP38C|2.0|This was a total disappointment.  Everything from script, set and costume design, to actual filming angles and editing FLAWED. Who ever heard of the British Army wearing BLUE COATS?  And all of the FRENCH set design elements?  And where was the wit and intelligence which was and is JANE AUSTIN?  If you are looking for the best contemporary version of Pride and Prejudice, look no further than the mini-series starring Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle.  All the elements were correct and the acting was leaps and bounds better than this latest attempt!
B0014Z4OQG|1.0|Has no plot, lousy acting, special effects are o.k., however nothing to write home about.<br /><br />If you order this movie, they should send it to you free, and pay YOU $100 for taking it off their hands.
B00190OHD6|1.0|What happened to the line between what is good taste and poor taste.  Gutter talk in my opinion is not appropriate for Romance Movie.  Top it off with miscasting - maybe just me, but Hilary Swank is UGLY and there was ZERO chemistry between her and G. Butler.  And Kathy Bates cast as her mom? - that was just WRONG.  And the sister...first, she couldn't act and second, another complete miscast.  If the movie had a different female lead, different mom, and different sister, a rewritten script with all of the profanity thrown out the window, different camera placement, and some proper scene transitions, then maybe, maybe it would have been OK.  My better half has this aversion to movies that use FLASH CARD TIME PLATES to keep track of time. He says it is a clear sign someone didn't write the script or want to spend money/time to scout and shoot sets properly.(GREAT CONTRAST to show how it CAN BE DONE would be \\"Nottinghill\\"). There seems to be a great deal of mediocrity in films these days. Doesn't anyone know how to make a LOVE STORY without crudeness?
B000GYHVFC|5.0|Great Graphics on the HD Player, and it was less than $12.00 bucks. Good movie to really enjoy HD DVD, thumbs up
B000VNMMQG|5.0|An amazing historic drama inspired by real events that brought a great song and a great cause into the forefront, helping those wishing to put an end to slavery change minds, and hearts. An emotionally intense story that brings an important historic brawl between right and wrong into perspective. I hadn't fully grasped the difficult journey William Wilberforce and his friends took on their path to bring truth into the light. Wonderful movie!<br /><br />Chrissy K. McVay - Author
B000E1MTY0|5.0|This is a great movie. Best Batman by far. Excellent picture quality on HD DVD. Should be in everybodys collection. Period.
B000X1Z0BU|5.0|The music C.D. is on my 'must have' list and well deserving of 'Oscar'. Though the musicians are the first to admit they weren't seasoned actors when taking on the characters of the film, they played the parts superbly. The story is 'soulfully simple' in its plot and there's not really any exceptional dialogue, but the heart of the lyrical tale is what makes you fall in love with the characters and their music. I loved it!  I'll also be playing the grooves off the C.D.  I also love any movie that helps draw a younger generation back to the magic of a musical.<br /><br />Chrissy K.

B0007MWZEK|5.0|The sweeper is great!  It is lightweight and picks up well. It, of course, doesn't have the suction of a vacuum cleaner, but for daily light duty cleaning, it is wonderful.  I have dogs and on a daily basis I can use this instead of hauling out my heavy vacuum cleaner.  It is also good in the kitchen, after the dogs have eaten and dinner has been prepared to pick up whatever lands on the floor.  It has a battery pack you keep plugged in, and it stores away easily without taking up much room.
B000ZN802W|5.0|Having lost a young adventurous cousin (Donald Charles Williams) in the mountains of Arizona while he was on a camping trip (he was murdered, and to date, his killer has not been found), this movie had special meaning to me.  The young often go on 'seeking' quests, full of the normal human debates going on inside them, often urging them 'into the wild'. I believe that if Chris McCandless had lived through his Alaska adventure he would have come back with new wisdom that helped him grasp the fact that his parents were imperfect humans doing the same juggling act with struggles we all encounter in life in one form or another. I also believe he forgave them for their imperfections. It's heartbreaking to watch this movie, but I was so touched by it that I thank the family for allowing it to be told. It must have been very painful for them. Penn did an excellent job of adapting Krakauer's book by the same name.<br /><br />Chrissy K. McVay<br />Author of 'Souls of the North Wind'
B0012Q94QW|1.0|Seriously, this is the worst movie I've seen in the last year.  Dreadful doesn't even begin to describe it - terrible acting, non-existent plot, awful dialogue and not remotely exciting or interesting. I will give the CGI folks credit, it's excellent but even that can't save this dreadful movie.    Save your money and don't even think about renting it either - it's not even worth the rental fee :-(
B0011KQSZ4|5.0|I loved the subtle humor of this movie and the interesting twists.  Things unravel for a family at a funeral when it turns out the deceased has been hiding an uncomfortable secret from his sons and wife. Add an accidental drug mishap to the fray and you have a hilarious 'misadventure'. The comedy has a light touch and the humor isn't overplayed, leaving it seem natural despite the bizarre events.<br /><br />Chrissy K. McVay - Author

0783219695|2.0|Do not be fooled by the tag, \\"IMAX theatrical experience\\". This is the original theatrical release version of the movie. Which was very fine, because it's a very fine movie. But I haven't seen the original theatrical version since I saw it at the movies the first time! Since then, I've been watching the special extended cut on VHS. Finally updating to \\"anniversary edition\\" DVD, I was MUCHO DISAPPOINTED to find all my favorite extra scenes cut!<br /><br />The extras ARE worth having, so it wasn't a total mis-buy, but now I will have to find a DVD version of the extended cut, too, so I can have the complete movie that I love in my collection.

I own 1000s of CDs including a couple with Emmylou and many with Mark.<br /><br />I really enjoyed the continuity between the artists, each lending their own sound to enhance the final product. Is there some country? Uh huh. Does it rock? Uh, uh. Am I glad to own it? YOU BET!
B000F7CMRM|1.0|What happened to the days when watching a movie was an escapist experience?  This movie makes you look at the clock more than the subtitles (which you have to have on, in order to follow the droll, elephant trodding they call a script)!    I hope the negatives are lost for the sake of posterity.      Clooney sucks also...as usual.        Jack
0143038419|2.0|After seeing this book do so well, I had to read it!  However, while reading it, I found myself wondering what all the fuss was about.  While I found Gilbert to be incredibly talented with metaphors and insightful at times, she displayed an air of superiority that got under my skin and kept me from fully enjoying her story.

0307387178|4.0|Into the Wild is classic Krakauer - reads much like Into Thin Air.  Brilliant, heart-breaking and lovely all at the same time.
B00076F0KC|4.0|First, a warning. This is not a book that's going to teach you how to predict the markets. If you're looking for that kind of book, look elsewhere. In fact, if you're looking to learn about trading or investing in the markets, this is probably not a good book for you. This is not an overly practical book in terms of providing any methods or techniques for use in your day to day trading.<br /><br />The (Mis)Behavior of Markets is much more along the lines of a scholarly discussion of prices. For those with a desire to understand how prices move, this is a good book. In particular, it's great for understanding why it is that even the supposedly best and brightest (like Long-Term Capital Management - LTCM) could get it so wrong. In short, much of what university economics and finance departments have been teaching for years is at best misleading and at worst dangerous.<br /><br />I must state for the record that I have long held a less than aggreeable view toward efficient market theory, Black-Scholes, random walk, and all of that stuff. It goes back to my days as an undergraduate finance student when I just intuitively didn't believe what I was being told and often saw the major flaws. When I started working in the markets I saw first hand how ridiculous many of the underlying assumptions behind classic financial theory really are.<br /><br />In The (Mis)Behavior of Markets Mandebrot takes on classic financial theory in a very straightfoward manner. He is extremely critical of the way economic (and by extension financial) theory has been developed and moved forward. He spends a fair amount of time explaining how the now classic theories of price movements came about, which I found interesting since I'm a bit of a history buff.<br /><br />From what I understand, many of the things that I used to gripe about with my professors as being major problems with classic finance have finally been recognized in recent years by academia as just that. This from a professor friend of mine. I don't know whether or not things have changed in what's being taught, though. My impression is not so much, which to me seems a major disservice.<br /><br />The thing I found most interesting in the book was how all these theories have been torn apart, not just recently, but for decades. Mandelbrot and others figured out very early on that price changes do not conform to a normal bell shaped distribution. They also figured out that price changes are not independent (among other things). Those are two major capstones underlying efficient market and random walk theories and the pricing of options using Black-Scholes.<br /><br />The thing that really irks me is that none of these critiques were ever presented to me in the classroom. We were just taught the same stuff that had been taught for years and years with no perspective on how research was showing major problems.<br /><br />The biggest thing Mandelbrot focuses on in terms of the implications of all the errorenous assumptions is the implied risk. He points out that things like the Crash in 1987 and other market shocks in recent years were also so improbable as to be beyond any reasonable expectation of classical theory. Given how many securities are priced using models based on that classical foundation, and how the commonly employed Value at Risk (VAR) calculations are similarly based, you can see how this is a major problem. Investors and institutions have been taking much more risk than they thought. This is something which once again became readily apparent last summer as the credit crises exploded.<br /><br />Mandlebrot, naturally, presents a different way of looking at price movement - one founded in his fractal theories. He readily admits, however, that it is still early in its development. Much more work and research needs to be done. One cannot use anything he presents in the book to help forecast prices, though it can help to understand better how prices move, and thus by extension the risk of financial assets, which is a benefit of potentially enormous value on its own.<br /><br />To be honest, the discussion of the fractals and such was the least interesting part of the book for me. That could just be my practitioner's perspective, though. Others might be much more facinated. I personally am far from convinced that mathematics is ever going to be suitably useful in price forecasting the way people seem to think it will.<br /><br />All in all, I would call The (Mis)Behavior of Markets a good read. It's informative and thought provoking, but doesn't bog the reader down in a gread deal of math and complexity (there's an appendix for those inclined in that direction). If you are at all intellectually curious about the financial markets, this is definitely a book worth reading.alue on its own.

B000YAA68C|2.0|Maybe I'm biased, because I've never read the book. I didn't even know there was a book. But I do love Hilary Swank and I believe she is a wonderful actress. But this movie was horrendous. First of all, the first scene with the fighting was drawn out and predictable. I took that as a sign of how the rest of the movie would be. Yes, I finished watching the rest of movie to give it a chance, but I had to fight the urge to not get up and walk out instead. Even for a 'romantic comedy' the movie is unrealistic.     Yes, I do believe that the length of Holly's grieving time was appropriate, and so was her attitude towards Daniel. But I thought it was silly that Daniel thought he had a chance with her and it'd only been a couple of weeks...? Months? Kathy Bates as the mom sure is harsh for knowing the situation Holly is in. Though..Lisa Kudrow has moments and some great lines.   I just felt some characters and scenes weren't needed, such as putting Daniel through torture of reading a letter to him?! And then what follows after that reading made me cringe not because I didn't agree with it, but because it was just too soon...and weird given the vibe of the letter, and of Holly's newly found self-awareness.    Also, Holly and her escapade with William seemed unrealistic that it'd be somehow connected to Jerry out of all the men in Ireland. Even though this is addressed, it still gave me a gross vibe for some reason. Maybe because I felt like she was just with this man because it reminded her of Jerry.    Gerald Butler completely steals the film and all I kept waiting for was the next time he'd enter the scene. So, if you're looking for some handsome faces, then you've found the right movie. (Hence the two star rating) But besides the eye candy, I couldn't connect with Holly, I empathized with her situation, but I felt no chemistry projecting from the screen or within the actors themselves. I guess it was just missing that 'feel good' vibe that Holly feels when she realizes that can move on. But does she really move on? Or is because Jerry tells her she can?     In the end, I left empty inside still waiting for the story to really take on a meaning...and I'm usually a tear-jerker for these type of movies. I didn't feel sad. Even once.    Predictable scenes. Predictable lines. Unrealistic interactions. Maybe I'd love this movie more if I had the book.
B0016HNOXQ|3.0|This will definitely be a very polarizing album.<br /><br />Third seems to have more in common with NIN's esoteric offerings than any previous Portishead music.  It's certainly a very interesting album, for sure.  Very interesting.  But the warm, muddy, groovyness that was Portishead is gone.  Totally absent are any sort of bassy beats and trip-hop rhythms.  There's none of that.  Even spy guitars are on short order.<br /><br />Trip hop has died, and instead of trying to revive that sound for risk of beating a dead horse, they've again created a type of music which does not exist.  This time it's cold, off-putting and alienating.  It's too strange and well thought-out to suck, but too appallingly creepy to be considered good by most people.  On many tracks Beth seems to be fighting against the music rather than accompanying it.<br /><br />If someone was to be in the mood to listen to Third, \\"I can't wait to get home to listen to Third\\", I'd question their mental state.  Call the paramedics!<br /><br />All that negative sounding stuff being said, there are a few good tracks on here.  \\"The Rip\\" being closest to the Portishead sound you may be wanting / expecting.  This is a truly beautiful song which slowly builds itself up (as a few other songs on Third do).  Still, it has an \\"Out Of Season\\" feel moreso than old Portishead . . . or even the rest of Third for that matter.<br /><br />The songs \\"Plastic\\" and \\"Nylon Smile\\" are also pretty good.  \\"Machine Gun\\" is a hard listen, perhaps the most challenging song on the album.  The other tracks are also hard to get into, but might be to your liking depending on your temperament.<br /><br />I didn't like this album at first, but find myself coming back to a few tracks and really enjoying them.  It's worth checking out.<br /><br />I can only expect the people that grew up with Portishead expecting the same old thing will be remixing this album into something truly amazing though.  So if you don't like it, I'm sure some great stuff will still come out of it.
B0000214F0|5.0|This is an amazing movie. There is nothing like it and I doubt there ever will be. It is pure entertainment from start to finish and yes, it has pornographic scenes. Guess what. So does life. Especially if that life is taking place in ancient Rome, a time and place known for excess and indulgence. The cast is spectacular, the sets monumental (be sure to watch the special features) and the script chock full of quotable lines.<br /><br />This movie has been bashed since day one, but if you watch this with an open mind and a yearning for big screen style entertainment, you won't be disappointed.
0452289963|5.0|Being an Oprah fanatic, this book definately had to be read, moreso with the classes being offered online(which I am taking)I could not be left behind.    Eckhart shows the various ways the ego maifests itself in various forms.I liked the part where Eckhart says that every human has a dysfunction. it all depends on it's degree.And the begining of realizing one's sanity is the true conscious awakening.    This is book that prodes deep thinking in trying to identify the real \\"I\\" or the real \\"you\\". The moment you discover the ego in you then you become aware of yourself.    Takes time to understand it. Definately a best buy! Good job Eckhart.

0142405809|5.0|I read 3 books every night to my almost-4 year old daughter (I love to read and share this love with her) and this is one of our very favorites.  It is beautifully written, marvelously illustrated and just so very sweet.  My husband loves to read it too.  A book for children that makes even parents dream about travelling adventures on the back of the whale!  Most highly recommended.
0143038419|4.0|This is an exellent book for those of you who love the richness of grammar and descriptive language.    I could not put down the book. Elizabeth's journey towards discovering herself made me ponder if I had discovered my purpose in life!!!    Highly recommended for those in search of who they want to be and for those who have a light sense of humor.
B00005JPTK|3.0|This was an interesting movie. Not exactly one of Will Smith's best, but a very interesting one.
B000YABYLA|5.0|I love this movie!  First of all, it's laugh-out-loud funny.  The language is fast and off-the-wall and you'll wish you had a kid with you to translate, but then you'll find yourself using (or at least thinking) some of these expressions.  (If you are way over the hill like me, it's fun to at least sound cool again! LOL)<br /><br />Juno is your typical \\"misfit\\" kid, albeit with a very quick wit and her very own take on the world.  She's crushing on Paulie, who is not your typical teen-movie  hottie; so, she seduces him, resulting in yep, another teen pregnancy. This movie puts a bit of a new spin on it, and also gently reminds us that the grim statistics have real people with real stories behind them.  Even if these people are (as teenagers all too often seem to grown-ups) a bit foreign and alien and impossible to comprehend.<br /><br />Juno's dad and stepmom handle the pregnancy well, with humor and grit and a \\"we'll get through this\\" attitude that is admirable and hey, what else can you do that makes sense?<br /><br />I think this movie is a *must* for parents of teens or pre-teens.  Even if you need a translator.  Watch it with your kids and talk about it.  Even if it scares the crap out of you.<br /><br />P.S., I love the music, too.
B000X418UO|5.0|The 90s were full of Die Hard rip-offs and few of those managed to stand on their own two feet. Con Air (along with [[ASIN:B003ZD9DXY Ronin (Two-Disc Blu-ray/DVD Combo)]], [[ASIN:B00005OKQH Army of One (aka Joshua Tree)]] and [[ASIN:B000W4HIXQ Die Hard With a Vengeance [Blu-ray]]]) is everything an action movie and a summer movie should be. It's bursting at the seams with fire, explosions, blue skies and sunshine and never fails to excite.<br /><br />Jerry Bruckheimer's production style rarely makes a good movie but Con Air is one of those rare exceptions in which all the OTT mayhem and full-on action make a film so exhilarating it scorches when you watch it.<br /><br />Nic Cage (in a typically bad performance) is Cameron Poe, a US Ranger who is sent to prison for accidentally killing a thug who attacks his pregnant wife. After 8 years of porridge he is freed and hitches a ride home on a prison plane called The Jailbird. But this is no ordinary flight.<br /><br />On Board are a small army of America's toughest crooks including Cyrus 'The Virus' Grissom (John Malkovich) a man on death row for murder, robbery, kidnapping and extortion. Nathan 'Diamond Dog' Jones (Ving Rhames), a black militant inside for murder. Billy Bedlam (Nick Chinlund), inside for killing his cheating wife's family and dog. Pinball Parker (Dave Chapelle), a pimp and drug-dealer. Swamp Thing (MC Gainey) a pilot who knows a few things about a good hijack. And finally Garland Green AKA The Marietta Mangler (Steve Buscemi) a serial killer in for killing a zillion people and crossing 2 state borders wearing a girl's head as a hat.<br /><br />As you can tell, with such a eclectic bunch of psychos on board it's only a matter of seconds before all hell breaks loose. As soon as the plane is in the air the cons have taken over, restrained or killed the guards and have changed the destination from prison to South America.<br /><br />Poe, being the good-hearted sort of chap that he is, doesn't rat out as his best pal needs his insulin shot and no one else will help. It's up to Poe to sneakily round up the baddies until US Marshall Larkin (John Cusack) and the cavalry can get there. Easier said than done, as double-crosses, suspicious cons and incompetent authority foul everything up. The result is action overload as the film blazes through to it's anarchic, devastating climax upon another anarchic, devastating climax. At the end you'll be left breathless and your senses stinging with over-stimulation.<br /><br />Steve Buscemi steals the whole show. His deadpan, bug-eyed and dare I say 'innocent' portrayal of a deranged killer is the centerpiece of the whole film. The scene where he sings with a little girl (and continues later on) will either freak you out or steal your heart. And the ending is the best you could hope for.<br /><br />Mark Mancina and Trevor Rabin provide a loud, blaring score of thrash-metal and acoustic guitars with the usual Media Ventures flare. It's brilliant stuff and I suggest you hunt down the (sadly incomplete) [[ASIN:B000000OGP Con Air: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack]]. And this film really did deserve the Best Original Song award over that pansy Titanic one.<br /><br />Superior to both [[ASIN:B000X418UE The Rock [Blu-ray]]] and [[ASIN:B000RZGIOA Face/Off [Blu-ray]]], Con Air is Nic Cage at his (worst) best as an action hero and Bruckheimer at his best as an action producer. See it, for the love of God, see it.<br /><br />The Blu Ray looks brilliant in 1080P and sounds just amazing.one else will help.

B00000IUP4|5.0|We have tried many brands of wooden trains and tracks. For our various brands of wooden tracks (Brio and cheaper knock offs), ONLY BRIO ENGINES are able to stay on the tracks, without falling off tracks around the curves or get stuck up a hill;-)  We tried the Learning Curves and Thomas & Friends Wooden Railway battery-driven engines, and they are esthetically pleasing, but don't stay on the tracks we have.   Perhaps because Brio battery-driven engines' wheels have rubbergribs, some turn with the track in the instance of the bigger \\"Polar Express\\", wheels are thinner or closer together.     And no recalls yet! I love all our Brio and look forward to pass on to the future generations!
B000003GBN|5.0|Beethoven's Fifth Symphony is unique, sui generis.  With no predecessors and no successors, it just sort of stands there.  A bolt of lightning: the single purest musical inspiration ever.<br /><br />It seems a bit odd that Fritz Reiner would be the one to create the best recorded performance of the Fifth, when you think of his operatic work and his colorful sound spectaculars with big Strauss pieces.  The Fifth, however, requires massive, tutti passion, and I suppose that Reiner's discipline must be what matched so well with those demands.<br /><br />Whether by luck or not, he had at his command the amazing warmth, power, and virtuosity of the best symphony orchestra ever.  The stunning work of Chicago's first-chair players is for once not called on.  What Reiner gets instead is a great hammer of an ensemble.<br /><br />One has the sense of an encounter between two mythic beasts.
B0007ZEO4G|4.0|I can't believe nobody is mentioning Ian Paice's drumming on the song Burn. Are you F#$@ing kidding me? Everyone seems to want to give us a Deep Purple history lesson and impress us all with what they know. There don't need to be 30 reviews that break that all down. One will do. \\"Purists\\" already know all of this anyway. For people who maybe don't know all of it, or are new, or looking for a great album from this era. This is it. This album stands very well on its own. Funk, Blues, Rock, whatever. Good stuff period. If you are new to Deep Purple I would suggest picking up The Very Best Of Deep Purple disc and Live Made In Japan. I do highly recommend Burn though.
B000OCZD60|5.0|This is a great flick.  I have always been a fan of the Mad Max trilogy.  Something about movies with fast cars....Bullitt is also one of my favorites.    anyways, you will not regret getting this movie.
B000F2C87Q|5.0|i love this kind of music and was very happy to find in on amazon.  my son introduced me to the black keys, and i love to play it at work.
B00132D808|4.0|This album sounds nothing like you would expect. It probably sounds like the complete opposite of anything you would expect to hear from a former psuedocabaret band. It definately takes some getting used to but Pretty. Odd is Pretty. Golden once you get to listen to it about four times over. Only two of the songs i think are completely trippy(lyrically) and give off the vibe that they were \\"up to no good\\" up in the mountains for four months. But the album is definately one any fan should own, and one every FBR and Decaydance alum should have in their collection. And for the rest of you, just buy it, very Beetles, very different for our time, very odd.
0375423877|4.0|If you find yourself needing a little uplifting relaxation and a fun read, pick up a copy of Alexander McCall Smith's The No.1 Ladies' Detective Agency, the first book in the overwhelmingly series. A perfect break from an overdose of too many noir crime novels!<br /><br />The story tells how Mma (aka Precious) Ramotswe struggles to get the only detective agency run by a woman in Botswana off the ground. Smith, a native of Zimbabwe, intermixes several story strands, including Mma Ramotswe's back story. She deftly solves mysteries large and small without violence or high-tech equipment. Smith uses the stories to take the reader to a little bit of southern Africa.<br /><br />A very enjoyable read. Often compared to Agatha Christie with some justification, Mma Ramotswe is a worthy and wise fictional character in her own right. She narrates her own tales with a delightful light and commonsensical tone. Highly recommended.
B000N6TYLW|5.0|Season Seven was a nice and fitting end to a well written series... the snappy dialogue which was for me the reason for the show was not quite as crisp but it was a real winner over-all.  I liked the whole concept of the show and wish there was something similar still going on.... Oh well..       To me, the whole Gilmore Girls run was great.
0446402389|3.0|Tom Rob Smith's debut novel is very well written.  Excellent, thought provoking, detailed historical novel.  Has the 'feels like you were there' in post-WWII Russia.  However, the novel was too dark and depressing for my taste, although the thrill factor is high with many twists and turns. The book really hammers home the despair of a people pressed down by a military state.  Fans of Russian history or the politics of communism will most likely enjoy the book.
1591791707|5.0|Im still listening to this but all I can say is wow. It will really put your mind, your thinking in a better place. It will definitley change your life positively if you let it. The author speaks eloquently and simply to get the message across very clearly..all i kept thinking was this should be required education in school. a real gem.
B0011UBDTK|5.0|Hi all SATC fans! Like the the first two reviewers, I wondered what the difference between this collection, currently on sale for $109.99, and the \\"Collector's Edition\\" on sale for $196.99. But since all I really wanted was to have all the episodes on DVD I went ahead and ordered the cheaper set. When I received it today, I read the back and toward the end of the top paragraph it said:<br /><br />\\"Celebrate the show that explores the day-to-day - and night-to-night, world of single women in this, the definitive collector's edition.<br /><br />With that read, I wanted to see if I really got the \\"Collector's Edition\\" so I called my girlfriend who bought her \\"Collector's Edition\\" at the regular price of $300 back a few years ago to compare the difference. Good news! Sounds like they're the exact same thing! What I received in my $109.99 set is a pink velvet spiral binder with various color pictures of the ladies and scenes from the show and short summaries of each episode. The DVDs are nicely tucked away, by seasons, in pockets of thicker pages after the summaries. The pink velvet spiral binder comes in a plastic sleeve for protection from scratches, etc. There's no way, however, to see if this DVD set was made in 2007. Everywhere I looked said 2005. Oh well, I'll be happy if all the DVDs work!<br /><br />If you want to peek at what this set looks like I suggest clicking on the \\"Collector's Edition\\" for $196.99 and looking at Picture 4 of 9. It's the picture with the binder (closed and open) with the DVDs nicely scattered in front of it. That is exactly what I received today.<br /><br />Happy shopping and I hope this helps!
0740748475|5.0|Very good collection! Shipping should have more padding to protect box hich is quite heavy and avoid denting.
B0002F6AZC|5.0|Better then the first for many reason. Creepshow 2 has different kind of people. The first Creepshow (beside the second story) deals with rich people. Also it's long and boring. The second Creepshow it's about 90 minutes. The stories are quick easy to follow. Creepshow 2 got a animated Creep to tell the stories. Effects are great plus it helps to hve some nudity.
0887307280|4.0|I liked this book even though I felt it was a little light in detail. I also found the presentation a bit redundant. Having said that, this book presents two very important concepts that bear repeating:<br /><br />1) You can't (and shouldn't if you could) do it all.<br />2) A truly successful business must be able to run without the owner present.<br /><br />Mr. Gerber correctly points out the way to implement the latter is to preplan for growth and implement systems that are documented in a Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) manual that are simple enough for an entry level employee to follow. Easier said than done.<br /><br />Mr. Gerber doesn't address how the small business owner already working 70+ hours per week in his or her business is supposed to find the time to do the kind of detailed process workflow analysis required to produce such a document.  No matter that the need for doing so is evidently clear.<br /><br />Nor does Mr. Gerber address the obvious capital requirements necessary, even if one can find the time, to get the job done. Time is money and time and money are the two precious resources most small business owners have the least of.  This is a classic catch-22 situation where it's imperative that business owners systematize their operations but lack the resources to accomplish the task.<br /><br />Perhaps a great companion book for the author to write would be a meaningful blueprint for implementing the good advice found in E-Myth Revisited. Or perhaps the author could add a chapter or two to the existing book.<br /><br />Either way I give it four stars for not providing enough content to support an otherwise salient concept. It would also be helpful if his example business owner wasn't so docile and one dimensional.<br /><br />Joe Waynick, Author<br />\\"Internet Bookselling Made Easy!\\" series<br />[...]
0143038419|3.0|I enjoyed sharing Elizabeth Gilbert's journey to find herself.  Although she had a life many would envy her for, she was unhappy.  I believe the fact that she took the initiative to do something about it and take time out in order to come to terms with herself is what this book is all about.  While I feel that her decisions were selfish, at least she was truthful and determined not to deceive herself or those close to her.      During her journey, she was determined to seek God.  However, I believe she missed out on seeking His order and purpose for Man.  In addition, she came to her own conclusions about God that I have to strongly disagree with.  I don't believe that anyone can make his or her speculations about God and assume them to be true.      Nevertheless, the success in finding inner peace and forgiveness is commendable. I did find myself getting a lot of laughs as I was reading! Gilbert's honest and realistic perspective is what made this book an enjoyable read.  I like it when people say it like it is!
0375842381|5.0|I initially learned of this series after hearing it compared to the Harry Potter books.  I adored Harry's adventures with his friends and wanted more of the same British magic. After reading both I realized that Phillip Pullman's work can in no way be compared to J.K. Rowling.  Both authors are spectacular in their storytelling, but are so different in their styles and objectives for their works that comparing and contrasting them would do neither justice.    Philllip Pullman's His Dark Materials Trilogy is a complex work of courage, love and betrayal, and conveys to the readers a wide diapason of human emotions and personalities. My initial impression of The Golden Compass (book 1 in the series) was that it was an anti-religious book and the propaganda behind it almost turned me off the entire series. I have to admit that I was utterly wrong in making such a conclusion so soon and am glad that I made myself suspend my skepticism and read to the end. True believers in a cause, be it eternal salvation or something entirely different, are sometimes blind to reason since they see nothing but the burning beacon of their faith directing their paths of righteousness. Their deeds might appear wicked in the eyes of the atheists among us, but are they truly so? Can you compare the actions of Father Gomez in his mission to kill Lyra and spare Will, who is in his eyes an innocent, to a common murderer? Does his unwavering belief absolve him of sin or condemn him even more? What about Ms. Coulter, who did unspeakable things in her life until she finally found the bliss that is maternal love? Does her final sacrifice make all the other deeds accidental?      There are so many questions of human nature that this series raises and manages to avoid giving free answers that don't encourage thought and reflection. It shows that not everything in life is black and white and there are as many shades of gray as there are misconceptions, deceptions and misunderstandings within human character. And with all that, the purity of spirit and love shine through in both Will and Lyra as they undertake the most perilous tasks and continuously find themselves battling for the greater good that children should never have to do. Then again, may be it can only take the innocence and ingenuity of a child to accomplish what they managed without loosing themselves in the process.     I will not spoil the ending of the series, but will say that it was as powerfully and beautifully written as the rest of the tale. All three books were fast paced and captivated my interest completely.  I would personally not recommend this trilogy to children and in my opinion they were quite a bit darker then the Harry Potter books. On the other hand, the original Brothers Grimm stories are a lot more gruesome and I've read them as a child myself. Whatever you do, don't miss this phenomenal read.
0201485672|5.0|I was referred to this book from a colleague after a quick discussion on \\"Replace temp with Query\\" in our projects code base.    I thought I knew it all as a software developer, but reading this book, I soon came to realize that as a software developer I was leaving a legacy of code that was not at the standard it should be.    This book opened my eyes to some really simple concepts, for example, when trying to understand code someone else has written (or yourself in some cases) take the time to re-factor the code (i.e. Extract Method) so that the code is understandable, since most of the work is spent in trying to understand the code in the first place. This concept of modifying code as you understand it is superb.     I must say I was skeptical at first but the benefits are really starting to show. This book is written with the knowledge of Martin Fowler, and as such is written with experience of what it is like to be a developer in a commercial environment, for example, trying to explain to management the trade-offs of re-factoring first instead of \\"tacking on\\" that new feature.  Something that is difficult in any environment.    This book will by no means solve your problems, but it will empower you with a new found love to make the IT project(s) you work on better (i.e. not thinking of the now but the future) practice some of the smaller concepts this book presents on a daily basis and the rewards are well worth it, break those bad habits today.
B0002A2WDQ|4.0|Crossroads is a decent attempt at drama from men (John Fusco and Walter Hill) who are known for anything but drama.  However, even if it weren't entertaining, the final scene is worth the price of admission.  On the other hand, unless you can ignore Macchio it's basically a reason to punch yourself for two hours, as he plays an extremely unconvincing Julliard-schooled, classicly-trained guitarist with a love of the blues.<br /><br />Eugene \\"Lightning Boy\\" Martone (Macchio) has a gift for classical guitar; only, he's too stupid to take advantage of that fact and run with it.  Instead he incessantly harps, whines, and pouts about his fascination with the blues.  His teachers hate him.  He is so fascinated that he begins to stalk an old blues player named Willie Brown (Joe Seneca), who has a plethora of aliases such as Smokehouse Brown and Blind Dog Fulton.  After tormenting the old man who wanted to live the rest of his days in anonymity, Eugene breaks Willie out of an old folks' home.  Their mission: walk and hitch-hike (aka hobo-ing) down to Mississippi where Willie promises to teach Eugene a lost song that was written by Robert Johnson.  Only, there's no such song.<br /><br />The real reason Willie leads the naïve, gullible, dumb-as-a-rock Eugene down south is to get out of a deal he made with the devil in the 1930s.  It is during this journey that Eugene gets his first sexual interaction with another person (not with Willie, with Jamie Gertz), and \\"truly\\" learns what the blues are after she dumps him for a rocker or a drug-dealer.  Presumably.<br /><br />Throughout the entire movie, Eugene made me cringe and wish for Johnny from Karate Kid to come in and dish out a beating.  How someone could be so unaware of the world around them is beyond me.  I'm completely convinced that if there had been a sequel to this movie - thankfully there was not - it would have been about 45 minutes long, and Willie would have traded Eugene to a garage band for a bottle of whiskey and some smokes.<br /><br />Anyway, Macchio fumbles through his performance as a blues guitarist so much that the musical scenes alone should have garnered this film an R rating.  Don't get me wrong; the music is beautiful.  But it's just too hard to overlook the fact that it's Macchio attempting to give off a convincing performance as a blues man.  The final scene, however, saves him.  In a guitar version of Dueling Banjos - without the inbreeding - Eugene must utilize all of his skills, aided by some slick harmonica work from Willie, to beat the devil's representative, Jack Butler (Steve Vai), in a musical duel for souls.<br /><br />I ended up being quite pleased with this movie, despite Macchio.  It's full of American folklore, good music, a great tale, a nubile Jamie Gertz, and one of the eeriest portrayals of the devil I have ever seen., Macchio fumbles through his performance as a blues guitarist so much that the musical scenes alone should have garnered this film an R rating.

B0013J30XG|3.0|It's pretty much the way you remember the cartoons: lots of action, racing, not much thinking things through, cars, bloodless violence, racing, annoying kid brother, cars, family values, racing, and a chaste girlfriend. The good guys are squeaky clean, the bad guys storm and sneer, and being nice wins out in the end - and the bad guys get theirs. (C'mon, that's not really a spoiler. You knew it had to happen that way.) If that were all this movie offered, I wouldn't bother.<br /><br />The effects keep it moving at a roller-coaster pace, though. Fast cars on (and often in the air over) surreal race tracks pound together like supersonic bumper-cars, seen through vertiginous angles of the CGI \\"camera.\\" Everything gets amped up a notch by the movie's eye-popping use of color, flashing lights, and fast-moving montages. It's as if the Wachowskis were trying to grab your adrenal glands by reaching in through the optic nerve.<br /><br />As far as plot and all that go, this movie ranks a few steps below ordinary. As a fast paced effects-fest, though, there's nothing like it around.<br /><br />-- wiredweird
B0018CWEYY|5.0|How can a customer have *reviewed* this item when it won't even be available until 12/2008? Yes, I will be buying this when it becomes available, but that is because I love the TV show. I have no idea what the discs will look like, play like, or even extras to name a few. Besides, suppose these discs aren't ready for sale on time? Suppose they aren't released at all? Unlikely, sure (and I don't want that), BUT - you can't review something you don't have.
B000M341QE|5.0|Loved this gangster mob flim.  It was unpredictable and smart.  The characters were engrossing.  Completely believable characters with depth.  Great acting and well written. Definitely deserved the oscar it received.  Best movie I have seen in ages.  I am a tough critic and not impressed by Hollywood.
B00127RAJY|5.0|This 30 day shred from jillian michaels really works. It is really good. But you have to do the 20 minutes without interruptions, because you want to get the most of it. In the beginning you will feel like a truck drove over you a couple of times, which is a good sign, but gradually you will get use to it. You will fell muscles that you did not know you even had. It is a workout full of sweat and results.

0375842209|5.0|Finally got through this treasure since my library bought it on audiobook.  The Book Thief was a Printz Honor award winner and tells the story of a young girl growing up in Nazi Germany.  This has been done before, of course, but what gives this book its unique flavor is that it is narrated by Death.  Death is fascinated by Liesel, this book thief, and claims he gets distracted by her.  After blowing the end of the story for everyone, Death goes back to the beginning and tells Liesel's tale.  Death is a great character here, and exhibits the perfect combination of sly humor, a solemn tone, and a miraculous awe at the humans he watches from afar until the fateful moment.  Full of heartbreaking characters and miraculous moments, this book will leave you hungry for MORE ZUSAK.
B00132D808|3.0|This Panic At The Disco album was disappointing. And definitely boring (probably why they took the ! out of their name). Everyone for months were saying how creative it was going to be, but it sounds so Beatlesque. That's not creative, that's copying someone else's sound.

I could really see these two people being perfect for each other unlike some of the actors in other Jane Eyre films. Get this movie, you won't be disappointed.

Replace those thoughts with hope and faith and know that the universe \\"GOD\\" gives us people and situations in our lives that offer us lessons that need to be learned and will continuing doing so until we've actually learned the lesson.  Just surrender and let things be as they are, knowing that you are still the perfect \\"you\\" that was created in HIS image for a purpose greater than ourselves. It keeps me from creating issues that just really don't exist in the universe, but only in my head. I learned much about my ego's need to control by trying to justify, judge, and condem, issues & people in an attempt to justify my own ego and increase my self worth. It is these empty thoughts that lead to alienation from intimate relationships and rob you of your joy and peace. Thank you and God bless your indivual journey.
0452289963|3.0|A friend of mine recommended this book as one of the best books that they ALMOST read.  They had purchased the book on Oprah's recommendation and started the book---really enjoyed the start but just could not get though it---they thought that they would get back to it some day.  I was intrigued so I took the book out of my local library---I had to wait a few weeks---once again the power of an Oprah recommendation.  I started the reading the book and was very impressed with his philosophy but knew that I had read similar and eminently more readable philosophies that asked us to be Aware and Awake---I recommend all of the writings of Anthony Demello as alternatives or further reading for those who semm to believe something is here but can not get through the stuffiness of this volume---Demello writes with a sense of humor and a heart of love. reading his work will inspire many.  The three stars are for my affinity to Tolle's philosohy not the book.

B000Q6GUW0|5.0|First let me say that I would give this show 4 1/2 stars but it doesnt give you the option.<br />For the first few episodes I found myself wanted a little more from the series. Dont get me wrong... I liked it but found it lacking in certain areas.<br />Then as I progressed into season 1, Dexter was like a parasite that attached itself to me and I was trapt. I was intrigued. What can I say, it was a great show.<br />As the last few episodes approached I was so into it, I found myself biting my nails from the well writin tension between Dexter and The Ice Truck Killer, which is a total shock as for his true identity. You wont be dissapointed.<br />So if at first you dont care for the show, stick with it. It gets more involved and interesting. I will definately be watching season 2. I am after all, now, a Dexter fan.
0345444051|5.0|Sir Arthur C. Clarke (1917 - 2008) is one of the masters of the genre of Science Fiction from its golden age.  Though undoubtedly best known for \\"2001: A Space Odyssey\\", there are numerous other works of his which should be on every fan of science fiction's reading list.  \\"Childhood's End\\" is one of those books.  This book deals with concepts such as the utopian society, individuality, a `hive mind\\", and much more.  This novel grew out of a short story titled \\"Guardian Angel\\" which was published in 1950 (\\"Famous Fantastic Mysteries\\").  The original novel was written in February through December of 1952 and was published on August 24th of 1953 by Ballentine.  The text which I am reviewing includes a new chapter (or prolog) which was added in 1990, replacing the original.    When \\"Childhood's End\\" was first published, it included a disclaimer \\"The opinions expressed in this book are not those of the author\\".  Though certainly an odd statement, it did have its purpose as Clarke explains in his introduction.  After publishing \\"The Exploration of Space\\" he felt that people would be confused by a book expressing the idea that \\"The stars are not meant for man\\" which is not only in opposition to the book he had just published, but in many ways is the opposite of most of his works which express an opinion in that area.    The story is told in three parts.  The first section is titled \\"Earth and the Overlords\\".  The original prolog had the United States and the Soviet Union both on the verge of creating nuclear powered spaceships for space exploration venture when a fleet of alien spaceships appear over all the major cities of the world.  Reinhold is the main scientist for the U.S., and Konrad Schneider is the USSR's lead scientist.  The new prolog replaces that with Earth starting the 21st century by proclaiming it the Century of the Solar System with mankind on the verge of visiting the other planets when the Overlord fleet arrives.      The story then picks up five years down the road, with the overlords firmly in control of Earth, but with people becoming more and more restless about the still unseen Overlords and specifically the Supervisor, Karellen.  Secretary General Stormgren is the only one who has even been able to talk to the Overlords, as he meets with Karellen on the Overlords' ship, but he sits in a room with what he thinks is a view screen and is only allowed to talk to Karellen.  When his time as Secretary General is coming to an end, Stormgren is kidnapped and finds that he has been used as bait by Karellen to find the leaders of those who are opposed to Earth allowing the Overlords to control humanity.  Stormgren then comes up with his own plot, to find out what the Overlords look like, with or without their permission.    The second section is titled \\"The Golden Age\\" and starts with the Overlords allowing at last humanity to see what they look like.  This is also the golden age on Earth.  Humanity has evolved and put aside many of its prejudices and superstitions and with the help of the Overlords has attained new heights in almost every scientific area.  This is man's second shot at the paradise.  Will man be cast out of the Garden of Eden again?  This time the apple is the exploration of the stars, and Adam is in the form of Jan Rodricks, who learns the location of the Overlords home star, and attempts to stowaway on one of their ships to find out more about their home world and the Overlords themselves.  Clarke borrows from the story of Jonah and the whale in this story, to add to some of the biblical allusions.    The last section is titled \\"The Last Generation\\", and this section reveals the Overlords real purpose, which is to guard over and guide the evolution of man into what mankind will evolve into.  It is also revealed that the Overlords themselves are fated to advance no further.  The message for the rest of humanity is not so wonderful though, as they are fated to be the last generation.  Their entire purpose was to be the caterpillar for the butterfly that is to be man's evolution.  There are theological motifs played out as well, for what are the Angels (Overlords) in relation to humanity?  Mankind was made in the image of God, while the Angels are the servants.  Jan Rodricks returns to Earth and do to time dilation and the psychological effects on the world, he is alone as the last human in existence, able to observe the Overlords observing what man has become.    This novel has many thinking points.  Is it better to be a member of a species which will evolve, but your own species is but a stepping stone to that higher level, or to be a member of a species which is stagnant, force to watch and serve those who are more advanced?  Clearly Clarke prefers the latter, but there is a certain sadness to know that all that one accomplishes is meaningless with the exception of one's descendents.  There is also the question of what the real fate is of humanity's child, does it really partner with the Overlords master as they say?  How would they really know?  This is science fiction at its best, an engaging story which keeps the reader thinking while reading as well as after finishing.
0156034026|3.0|I liked the writer's style. The whole book is written as a conversation between a pakistani national and an American tourist, set in Pakistan. It is a very easy read, maybe couple hours, and doesn't get into much details about anything which is good! I was a little disinterested towards the end because I felt the author had some trouble maintaining focus. But overall a decent read.     But I am not particularly appreciative about the way he writes about India being the big bully waiting to wage war against Pakistan. Oh well...
B00168HARG|4.0|So what went down with the characters in the Terminator movies between T2 and T3??? Well, to find out you can pick up Terminator - The Sarah Connor Chronicles on DVD if you didn't catch the 9-episode premier season on FOX.<br /><br />Fresh from the first season of the hit series [[ASIN:B000QDLSR0 Heroes]], Thomas Dekker takes his turn in the role of John Connor, the future's lead guy in taking the Earth away from SkyNet and the machines. Summer Wow...er...um...I mean *Glau* is The Terminator; like Arnold in [[ASIN:B000EWBKKI T2]] she's sent to protect Connor. And like Kristanna Loken in [[ASIN:B000XFVIMQ T3]], she's mega-hot! And as Sarah Connor you have Lena Headey who I had never even heard of until her recent role in [[ASIN:B000Q6GX5Y 300]].<br /><br />Importantly, the entire cast of The Sarah Connor Chronicles take their roles seriously, and they preserve the integrity and the awesomeness of the movies that spawned the TV series. Sure, the producers of the TV show needed to take some liberties with the T 1 - 3 storyline that fans of the movies are so familiar with, but they keep a good story flow rolling that makes you anxious for the next episode. Just try not to think about why there's never any reference to all this TV show stuff in T3.<br /><br />And they'll be bock! (I know, bad Arnold accent.) Everyone's signed on to bring season 2 to viewers...this time hopefully with more than just 9 episodes! Pick season 1 up and check it out before season 2 starts.
B000XUUQQK|4.0|its a farcry from the original, but honestly.. who would want an actual sequel to Boogeyman? haha..<br /><br />the set up kind of reminded me of Nightmare on Elm Street 3, which also took place in a sort of mental ward. i found all the characters really believable, and i can honestly say i felt for some of them.<br /><br />the kills are excellent, and some of the best ive seen recently. i dont want to get into too many details, but ill just let you know, its bloody this time around. maggots crawling under someones skin, someone getting ripped in half, the removal of a still-beating heart, and lots more good stuff. lets just say, the violence delivered. in the realm of slashers, this is some hardcore stuff.<br /><br />there really isnt much in the way of plot developement. the main character saw her parents mudered as a child and hasnt recovered since, now shes checked into the mental hospital. there is a dark force preying on the secific fears of everyone in the building. varying from fear of the dark, to fear of gaining weight, and even fear of germs. every kill is brutal and creative.<br /><br />Tobin Bell does make a few appearances throughout the movie as the head of the mental ward, but it deffinitely wasnt enough screen time. well.. i probably wouldn't be satisfied unless he was starring.<br /><br />so in the end, if you're a horror fan, i would at leased give this a rental. slasher fans should buy it. its right up there with Hatchet and See no Evil as one of the best slashers in recent memory.

B00005UEAR|5.0|As a new fan to Dream Theater, having only listened to them for a few months now, I'm beginning to enjoy the works of Awake, Scenes From a Memory and Octavarium. However, Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence became one of my favourite records from the very first listen. I've come to appreciate Dream Theater for they're epic masterpieces, and here, they truly deliver. Disc 1 is solid - not flowing as one quite so well as Awake does but still brilliant. However, it is the 42 minute long title track that possesses a whole disc for itself which shows Dream Theater at their finest. The epic is broken up into 8 parts, though you would never listen to it out of order or just one part at a time. 40 minutes has never flown by faster than when listening to the second disc.
B0013J30XG|4.0|***SPOILER WARNING ***  First of all, as you may have already noticed, this movie pretty much gets one star or five stars.  Something to consider about this film is the fact that it is PG rather than the ever-popular PG-13 rating (Ironman).  That means this film is geared as much toward children as it is toward adults.  This film is a bold approach in art direction and creativity.  Kind-of the TRON of the 21st Century.  I doubt you will see it on any Academy Award listings but that is not the reason I go see movies.  If that were the case, I would have already seen No Country For Old Men.<br /><br />So now for the review...Take is as you will.  Reviews and opinions are just that.  I will tell you the facts and what I believe to be general good information about the film.  Whether you lay down, near ten bucks to see it, will be a decision you have to make for yourself.  I saw this film at an IMAX theater with my family (wife, 5yr-old son and 9yr-old daughter).  To prepare my son for the onslaught of action, I bought him the entire 60's era Speed Racer series on DVD two months before the release of the film.  When he stepped into the theater, he knew the characters and was prepared for all the action; unlike when he saw Transformers.  In my opinion, IMAX is the only way to go with this film.  I had to travel over an hour to get to an IMAX theater and then pay a premium to see the film, but I think it was worth it.  A week after seeing this film, my son is still asking to go see it again.  What did he like most, you may ask?  Well, remember he is a 5yr-old; he most remembers the scene when Speed is young boy, and is day-dreaming in class about winning a race.  Something about the wacky animation and music connected with my son, somehow.  He still laughs about it.  Currently, he has no less than 8 Mach vehicles in his collection.  The one thing about the film, that was disappointing for my son, was the reveal of Racer X.  In the cartoon, Racer X is Speed's older brother.  In this film, when his identity is revealed, Racer X does not look like Speed's older brother (due to an elaborate plot to fake his death and extensive plastic surgery).  This disappointed my son, because he couldn't understand the whole \\"deception/plastic surgery\\" thing.  My son said, \\"I guess he isn't Speed's brother.  That's not right.\\"  In any case, this is a small gripe, which shows that some parts of this film will play to an older audience.  When you think about what \\"going to the movies\\" is all about, this film stacks-up nicely.  There was a lot of effort to do it well, some really great lines, comedy, action and colors galore.  If you just can't sit back and enjoy a flick without having to banter around philosophical discussions of salt shakers and silly expectations, you should probably just go rent a copy of No Country For Old Men...the critics loved that one.is film, when his identity is revealed, Racer X does not look like Speed's older brother (due to an elaborate plot to fake his death and extensive plastic surgery).

B00125WAXC|5.0|This is a beautiful, captivating movie.  I can't say enough about the actors in this film, every one of them is superb!  This movie is a keeper and one I could watch again.
B000EULJLU|5.0|This Cd is great. I love Tool. This is my favorite of theirs besides Lateralus. They have such talent. I'm sorry I'm late on this review. Have to give the 5 star props. If you get the chance, go see Tool. They came out with flames to Jambi. Wings for Marie ( both parts ) will put you in another universe if you lose yourself in them. To me this cd seemed like a emotional evolution for tool. With undertow and opiate they we're almost crazy evil, like they were mad at God for putting them here. On Lateralus they seemed like they were accepting who they were and tring to grasp it and move forward. On 10,000 days they are blessed. It was like God handed them their instruments and said play this. I believe they show that we are all sacred beings on right in two. Listen to beauty at the end of rosetta stoned if you need proof of greatness. I will happily wait 20 years or however long it takes to make another record by these guys. Peace.
B0013D8LCW|5.0|I'm previewing \\"Shelter\\" for the Brisbane Queer Film Festival where it screens on Saturday 24th May 2008. \\"Shelter\\" shines as a film with huge heart, and one that's been made with equal care by the actors and all of the film-makers.<br /><br />It's not at all like the angst-ridden abomination of a gay surf flick \\"Tan Lines\\". In \\"Shelter\\" surfing is simply a fact of life element - it's not used or abused as a device.<br /><br />\\"Shelter\\" is a beautifully edited, spectacular looking and luscious sounding film which is definitely character driven. Each of the main characters is carefully developed so that we quite soon decide that we really do care about Zach, his young nephew Cody and Zach's love interest, Shaun. We want things to work out for them.<br /><br />We understand that Zach is in a bind - he's allowed himself to be the physical and emotional anchor for a progressively more dysfunctional family, but we know that he deserves much better life options. The writer and director of Shelter has done a fantastic job - not a look or word is wasted, and yet the whole pace of the film is very relaxed.<br /><br />\\"Shelter\\" deserves every accolade that any individual or Festival might care to bestow.<br /><br />Straight audiences must find \\"Shelter\\" to be equally rewarding. The film's theme is, after all, about love, honour and commitment. What could be more wholesome than that?
B00139W3NE|4.0|This movie is great for what it is. A well adaptation of the first of three books. The  special effects are wonderful and the storytelling was great. I did have to watch it twice to understand most of it. The ending was left wide open, but that is understood because their will be 2 more movies to follow. Nichole Kidman does a wonderful job as a villian, and it was very well thought out to not only capture adult's imagination but children's as well. The little girl who plays the title role does a excellant job as well. The Polar Bears, especially a particular fight scene involving them, add color to a sometimes slow movie. It's no Lord of The Rings but it is far better than most fantasy movies these days . I don't believe this movie will go against any religions either, I cannot speak for the next two, but this one is fine. Just try to remember if that is an issue to you that it is just a story. I look forward to the future installments.
B0015GF4FO|5.0|I was addicted to this series, I think every one can relate to one of the characters, whether or not they want to admit it.     The show made you feel like you were a fly on the wall..,the actors wonderful and so believeable.  I can't say enough good things about this show.    I hope HBO picks this up for a 2nd season.
B00005NI5Y|5.0|Hard to compare one Dylan release from the next.  I have the majority of his studio work.  I think I like the newer stuff even better than the old.  If 'Love and Theft' is not a masterpiece, its very close.  I'm in pure wonderment at times of the lyrical prowess of this recording, but then it is Dylan, so one should not be so surprised.  But I still say 'Wow!', aint bobby so cool.
B0014Z4OQG|1.0|by the time the first five mins were up I wanted everybody to die in this movie. I think the use of filming the the events as it happens by a guy wno never filmed before was overly exagerated. he never ran out of film or even batteries. and believe me if this kind of crap is going on I can see some of the footage could be filmed but not consistantly. and the video quality was far too good to say it was your average video camera. even the best cameras are not that good which is why 28 days later still rules as the best film shot on a digital camera ever. everything is crap.<br /><br />[...]
B0015D3Z4O|4.0|With \\"Hard Candy\\", Madonna isn't trying to push the boundaries of pop music (\\"Ray of Light\\", \\"Music\\"), critique the American dream (\\"American Life\\") or disguise spiritually-focused songs in dizzying future disco (\\"Confessions on a Dancefloor\\"). These twelve new songs find Madonna doing what the public likes best for her to do: dance, be fabulous and have a good time.<br /><br />Instead of working with obscure, edgy European producers, Madonna picked the most popular, good-time American producers out there to work with. So the question is, is she just winging it? Hardly. Workaholic Madonna is trying just as hard as ever, this time she's just trying to make the best mainstream, fun pop album she can.<br /><br />When she's not just having a good time on \\"Hard Candy\\", the somber moments seem to be all inspired by personal relationships. On \\"Devil Wouldn't Recognize You\\", she sings \\"angels they surround my heart/telling me to let you go.\\" On \\"Incredible\\", she pleads \\"We've got to get back there before it's too late.\\" Lyrics like these will hardly lay to rest the rumors that her married days are numbered.
B00005QAPH|5.0|Federico Fellini's `8 ½' is a film about film.  It carries the very essence of art in it's most entrancing form and delivers a beautiful interpretation of the glories as well as the tragedies of creating that said art.  I think that may be why `8 ½' is considered to be one of the finest films ever made, because it truly fleshes out the angels and demons involved in getting a directors vision off the ground.  It attacks the distress and anguish over desiring to create something meaningful and original without turning your good name into a disgrace by inventing a flop.  Thanks to a very strong and honest performance by Italian actor Marcello Mastroianni, `8 ½' becomes something real and beautiful.<br /><br />Mastroianni plays Guido Anselmi, an Italian director who is trying to escape pressure to start his next film.  While supposedly resting at a spa he finds himself bombarded by critics and producers and actresses, all wanting to know what his next film is going to be about, what their roles are going to be and when they can expect to start shooting.  The problem is that Guido can't decide what his next film should be about.  He wants to create something beautiful, something strong and meaningful but his ideas are not coming as richly as he would like.  Guido cannot seem to find solace outside of work with his wife and even his mistress giving him grief on a personal level and so Guido finds himself retreating into his mind, concocting dream sequences that prove to be the greatest inspiration for his next film.<br /><br />It is also within these dreams that we come to know who Guido really his.  We see segments from his childhood, fictionalized to create a dream world in which he is free to explore the facets of his life that helped shape the man, the director, the artist that he is today.  To me, the opening scene alone is what defines the final feeling I was left with at the movies end.  The scene, involving Guido trapped inside a car filling with fumes, cars surrounding him at all sides, his constant screams and pleadings going unanswered, unnoticed even express the struggle one has to undergo in order to create their vision; pressure building from all sides to conform and sell-out and give in to the demands of others.<br /><br />The acting here is superb, truly elevating this film to masterpiece levels of greatness.  Marcello Mastroianni is marvelous as Guido, really getting into his soul and fleshing out his ever feeling; from distress and desperation to a giddy gleefulness that comes from becoming a part of his vision.  Anouk Aimee is effective as Luisa, Guido's troubled wife.  Her face reads many layers of pain and heartache.  Sandra Milo is superbly cast as Carla, Guido's mistress.  She is charming and funny and full of life; a nice contrast to the cold etched on Mastroianni's face.  Claudia Cardinale is a dream as Guido's muse Claudia, an actress who tends to be almost too demanding for Guido's taste.  Barbara Steele is intriguing as Gloria, the fianc&eacute;e of Guido's good friend Mario and Mario Pisu is impressive as that good friend.  All involved, the ones mentioned as well as each and every other supporting actor, are wonderfully cast and only add to the films greatness.<br /><br />What I love about `8 ½' is the fact that it allows the audience to appreciate what goes into creating the films we all love to watch.  In fact, I think that `8 ½' is a film that any lover of film must witness for it completes the obsession so-to-speak, giving us a chance to live the life of the ones responsible for giving us these gifts in film.  It has been noted that `8 ½' is somewhat of an autobiographical film for Fellini, and it truly possesses an honesty that could only come from experience.  As the film draws to a close one is forced to face the fear of creating something below you, while confronting the heartbreak that comes from abandoning something you truly treasure because of fear of outside interpretation.<br /><br />I couldn't help but see a likeness to Woody Allen when watching this movie.  It had that same sort of dramedy vibe that Allen seems to capture (granted I have not seen a lot of Allen's films but it's undeniable the similarities).  The film never seems dated or irrelevant.  The rich black and white tones are beautifully captured and displayed for the audience, and the cinematography, score and set design (including the costumes) are all top notch.  `8 ½' could have been made last year, it is that beautifully constructed.  Rightfully winning the Oscar for Best Foreign Film (and rightfully garnering Fellini a directing nomination), `8 ½' is one of the greatest films I've had the pleasure of witnessing.  Named by many as one of the top 50 films of all time, I truly feel that `8 ½' is actually one of the most important films of all time, for it allows the public to crawl inside their obsession with film and understand the makings of cinema all to a greater degree.ldn't help but see a likeness to Woody Allen when watching this movie.

0061120081|3.0|A good book but not as good as the movie.  The exact ending as to how the attacker was killed left too much doubt as to who actually was the killer--I don't think this was a good way to end the book. If Boo actually was the killer it should have been clearer to the reader instead of making the reader play a guessing game.
B0013FNC38|5.0|First of all, what is with the cardboard packaging these days? More and more artists are having their work put in cardboard instead of the jewel case that used to be the standard. This just seems cheap. And the booklet inside is like the paper that comes out of my printer. Very cheap.<br /><br />As for the music, it's brilliant. I love Jason's laid back style. This is music to listen to on a lazy afternoon. It'll put you in a good mood and if you're already in one, it'll make it even better.
B000TUXL2A|5.0|Within the very narrow corridors of the iTunes obsessed (music as disposable content) recording industry, Mark Knopfler's Kill To Get Crimson is a welcome reminder of a not too distant past when complete \\"albums\\" were not just the medium but the message as well.     Knopfler's work on KTGC is nothing short of astonishing, vividly flowing together as a twelve title song cycle that strolls through the last three generations of British popular (and not so popular) culture - looking through the window of pawn brokers, failed artists, humbled actors, corporate sycophants and the occasional MILF. This is Britannic Tin Pan Alley and is easily the best work that Knopfler has ever done.     The shimmering production and fully realized artistic vision makes KTGC an essential and critical distraction from an era where rock stars are either invented on games shows or lamely masquerade as Disney Channel ingenues.    VERY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!
0802130208|1.0|First off, the book is hideous.  A novel to glorify the weakness of mankind.  This is the first book I have ever thrown in the trash.  I could not disgrace the various authors of my collection by placing this novel on the shelf.    The comedy of this book is in it's reviews.  To glorify this novel is to glorify disparity, vulgarity, and despair.  If these reviews were written as a joke on mankind, the least the reviewers could have done was credit the proper reviewer...Ellsworth Toohey.    It's not even good drivel.  It's a poor, vulgar rendition of Catch-22 without plot or character development.     Anyone who knows who Ellsworth Toohey is or can answer the following question will find nothing but frustration and disgust in this novel.    Who is John Galt?
B00127RAJY|5.0|Before i bought this dvd i read all the reviews and thought wow this must work... let me begin by sayin i am 5 foot and 100 pounds. I am not worried about losing weight... although that would be great if i could lose even 5 pounds because i can not lose weight for anything... but more about toning i bought this. I used to go to the gym 5-6 days a week and do cardio for 2 hours and strength machines for an hour. Today i did this dvd and wow it seriously feels like i have just came home from the gym.... i will keep everyone updated on my progress to show that this works :)
B0013BNY2Q|5.0|I can't say that I didn't like \\"Around the Sun\\".  I did.  But Accelerate is a different animal alltogether, and a new direction for the band at a time that they needed to diverge a bit.  Where \\"Around the Sun\\" and \\"Reveal\\" had a more subdued and dark tone, Accelerate is a driving rocker, with just enough slower melodies mixed in.    You can't listen to Accelerate without thinking about what songs would fit on what previous albums.  It's not that the songs sound or feel old, it's that they have such appealing harmonies and melodies that they conjure up other great REM works.  The first four tracks on this CD rival pretty much any album since \\"Automatic\\" or \\"Document\\".     \\"Mister Richards\\" could fit on UP, \\"Until the day is Done\\" could fit on Automatic, and \\"Man Sized Wreath\\" could fit on Monster or New Adventures.  These songs, and the entire album for that matter, give us a new direction for the most part but retain enough REM backbone to make you feel comfortable as you listen.  Buck's jangling guitar is out in front and Stipe's Lyrics are again right on target.  Mills' baseline is more driving and focused on songs like \\"Living Well\\".  There is still a  good dose of political message here, as in the last two albums.  But this time there is an attitude of defiance and confidence rather than sadness and despair.     The feel of Accelerate is sometimes rough (\\"Living Well is the Best Revenge\\") and sometimes perfectly polished (Until the day is Done\\") but always a great listen.  This is one CD I have to stop myself from playing over and over so I don't get tired of it.  It's that good.      The recording quality is very good, and it sounds great on my Ipod or on my big system (or blaring out my car windows).    Enjoy it!
B001661RC2|5.0|Still worth it. The Black Keys will never be anything different than the Black Keys, but who would want that? Catchy music, it makes you want to drive fast sometimes and lulls you into weird dreams others. Genius drumming and solid formulaic riffs.
B0014I4KIK|5.0|Goodbye Amy Winehouse, Hello Duffy.  Duffy's got the same retro sound--some liken her to Dusty Springfield, Lulu, Petula Clark, or yep, Amy Winehouse.  Duffy's got a strong soulful voice that cuts right to the bone.      \\"Mercy\\" was the cut that got my attention, but listen to the dark \\"Rockferry\\" or \\"Warwick Avenue.\\" Those are the three header cuts, but they're all worth a repeat or three on the turntable.  Just listen for yourself and see what I mean.  You need longer cuts than what's on this page, Youtube has several to pick from and they'll sell this CD.     My only complaint is this CD is short at only ten tracks.  It's still well worth the price.
B000068OSK|5.0|I wore out their other albums (Except for the first popular one...the name escapes me) like a pair of shoes...I listened to De Stijl every day for maybe six months. This album hasn't gotten worn out for me too bad. Some great stuff, some okay stuff. A good album. Cannon is the one, though. And the Robert Johnson song is almost unrecognizable.
B0016HNOXQ|5.0|This album has really moved me. Their first two albums were good but just did not even come close to hitting me as hard as this one did. The other two were trapped in the 90's.  In a style that has been long forgotten.  This one is simply more timeless.  Everything about it is just perfect in my eyes actually. The more stripped down arrangements are incredible. Great percussive drum grooves with orgasmic guitar drones and improv and Beths voice is still as beautiful as ever.  Overall it is just a haunting journey with so many twists and turns along the way.  A bit disjointed at times even.      This is what I call a true masterpiece.  I noticed that there is more of a kraut/art rock influence than hip hop or jazz so it's pretty obvious that this isn't the same ole trip hop but I think what they did is took these old inspirations and turned them into something new and something completely different for them. Yet, It still sounds like them. This is one of my favorite albums of the decade. I couldn't recommend it enough.
B000TERK3C|5.0|A classic product in a complete package. It truly doesn't get any better than this. If you want soup-to-nuts Radiohead, this is the place. Would recommend you jump on this right away.
1428144331|5.0|This audio book was read very well, The writer and story were simply great, very thought provoking and timely.
B0013FYTA8|4.0|I have followed this band since their days of pre-signing with a major record label, and I for one totally appreciate this album.  I don't much listen to Crutch or the last song on the album but everthing else is great, if you like Theory.  I love the way they have progressed on this relaese. They seem to have concentrated more on their melodic ability and their great harmonies.  Most songs are 100% radio playable and most all could be instant hits.  They have improved their song writing, with more songs about things that relate to everyone's lives.  And the addititon of a song written with Chris daughtry is killer....it's called BY The Way, which is so far my favorte. I promise you'll enjoy it.
006135323X|5.0|I love New Age psychology as much as the next guy - The Secret, The Power of Attraction, The Power of Now - it's all good to me.<br /><br />But as appealing as it can be to believe in the mystic, it's nice to remember that we live in the real world, too. Predictably Irrational isn't the product of magical thinking - it's based on real research, careful psychological testing that reveals that we're prone to making the same kinds of illogical but all-too-human mistakes.<br /><br />Did you ever buy an item that you knew you didn't want, and yet you didn't return it? Have you over-scheduled yourself to the point where you can't do anything well, yet you're reluctant to cut anything out? Have you ever had sex with someone who, in the cold, cool light of the morning, you really regretted bedding?<br /><br />Predictably Irrational will show you that you're not alone. But this isn't just a case of misery loving company. By explaining the real motivations behind these self-defeating behaviors, Predictably Irrational empowers you to alter them. With understanding comes, if not the promise, at least the opportunity to change.<br /><br />If this sounds heavy, it's not. This book is written in an extremely accessible and even entertaining prose. Every chapter asks an interesting question - how will people behave when faced with an opportunity to be irrational? Do they make the \\"right\\" choice or the one that feels right? Some of these experiments will truly amaze you.<br /><br />If you want to understand yourself and others in a brighter and more useful light, read Predictably Irrational. It's not magic - it's better. Science is our friend and the science of the mind is an endlessly fascinating subject.
B00013F38K|1.0|THIS is why DVD's will not be around much longer. Edited product, framed incorrectly. Why does it seem that the smaller companies, such as Blue Underground, put out beautiful product, while bigger companies completely miss the point of why people would want to own these shows. The sixties version of DRAGNET is one of my favorite shows, but when it was released on DVD, they sent it to Mexico to be produced, and many of the sets had to be returned, resulting in low sales and the unlikelyhood of any more glorious seasons. Where can I find KUNG FU's first season in a full-frame format? Thanks in advance to anyone who knows.
B0009UC7H0|3.0|The producers of Sahara might have done well to have considered how well the previous attempt to bring one of Clive Cussler's Dirk Pitt novels to the screen went before pouring a hundred or so million dollars into it even before Cussler launched an ill-fated lawsuit against the end product. While it's not as dull as Raise the Titanic, it didn't exactly set the box-office on fire let alone kickstart a new Indiana Jones-style franchise about the maritime treasure hunter that the studio so desperately wanted. It's not that hard to figure out why. Matthew \\"Naked Bongos\\" McConaughey and Penelope Cruz make for an unsurprisingly bland pair of leads, not helped by a plodding script that, after a terrific prologue in the American Civil War, pretty much traipses along with only a single boat chase to hold your attention until an action-packed last half hour finally wakes the film up. The outlandish premise - McConaughey's hunting a Civil War ironclad ship in the Sahara desert while Cruz is tracking the source of a new disease that threatens to poison the continent and beyond - works rather better than it should and the film's other MaGuffin, a solar-powered toxic waste disposal plant, must have had the Bond people kicking themselves that they didn't think of it first, but not well enough to make up for the lack of any chemical reactions among the cast. Perfectly watchable but also perfectly forgettable stuff.
B000ICL3KG|5.0|Thought provoking, action orientated - essential viewing for all people on the planet.  Why hasn't George W. Bush seen this?
B000VKJ6VS|5.0|WOW. well ive had this cd for a while now. and i can safly say that its one of the best i have and thats saying alot. i have an 80 gig i pod filled all the way with music and i keep coming back to Blackbird. burried alive is one of the best songs ive heard in the past few years.the combo of songwriting and musical genious i think is most present on this song. but dont take my word for it listen to it and check it out. they are defenetly one of the best bands to coume out in a long time!. i think its a combonation of Mark's guitar skills and Myles amazing vocals. this is something soo hard to find in a band. i guess some would put alterbridge in the super band catagory but they transend this label. i hope alterbridge's carrier is only begining and will not end like velvet revolver and audioslave. that being said i wish there was more alterbridge to listen to. if you just need to get your alterbridge fix and you cant get it with jsut one day remains and blackbird then check out The Mayfeild Four. thats myles old band before he joined alterbridge. his vocals and songwriting are present but they are lacking marks guitar skills. this is a nice alternative to blackbird if you need a break and i would recoment checking THE Mayfeild Four out! they got two albums .....
B000NA2BEU|5.0|Smart, sexy and sarcastic, what more could you want.  Season three sees Veronica at Hearst College with love trouble, the Dean's \\"suicide\\", militant feminists, and a serial rapist roaming campus. The script is witty and fast paced with classic one liners.  The cast are fabulous, with some new faces introduced.  This is a great series with clever plots and a schoolgirl detective who kicks Nancy Drew's butt.  Veronica Mars, my hero.

0385335989|4.0|A little scattered, with multiple shifting narratives, this fourth installment is still enjoyable for those who have been smitten with the Scottish Highlander Jamie and his time shifting wife Claire. I actually didn't find the book boring like some reviewers have, I just found it repetitious. Where the arrival of some characters from the earlier books are welcome and fun (Lord John for example) there is a recycled element to the book that left me wanting less of Brianna and her betrothed Roger, and more of Jamie and Claire. Once again she employs a pretty generic and  stock villain who left me wondering is somebody always going to be raped in these stories?And while the first three books had some pretty terrific climaxes,  this kind of peters out with a whimper. Still, the fact that this woman can clock a book in a over a thousand pages and still make it hard to put down, any quibbles feel pretty minor.
B0013FNC38|4.0|For his third studio album, Jason Mraz continues to prove why he has earned such strong support since his debut in 2003.  \\"We Sing, We Dance, We Steal Things\\" steers Mraz firmly back into the singer-songerwriter genre, avoiding some of the pop trappings that cropped up on his last album, \\"Mr. A-Z.\\"  This is both good and bad, because while the album lacks a song as powerful and mesmerizing as \\"O.Lover\\" or \\"Plane,\\" it also lacks any real clunkers, something that cannot be said for his previous work (\\"Forecast\\" was a massive mistake of a song).    In fact, this is probably Mraz's most consistant studio effort to date.  Opener \\"Make It Mine\\" is incredibly catchy and a perfect accompaniment to the changing weather, and as the CD continues there isn't one song that breaks the spell.  Granted, both \\"I'm Yours\\" and \\"Lucky\\" (his duet with Colbie Callait), sound like they belong on the \\"Juno\\" soundtrack, but this is not a bad thing, and is true to Mraz's roots.  As always, Mraz's voice is pleasant and soothing to listen too, while still packing a punch when necessary.    All that being said, Mraz still hasn't topped the magic of his Live album, \\"Tonight, Not Again.\\"  He's a good singer and a creative, witty songwriter, but he is an incredible performer who deserves to be seen live.  If you for some reason don't own that album and think you'd be even remotely interested, you should buy that first.  For those of you who already own the Live album and are fans of Mraz, \\"We Sing, We Dance, We Steal Things\\" is sure to appease your appetite until you can get to his next concert.
B000WGNLLW|5.0|The CD is great in itself - and the bonus CD with the making of the album - interviews with the band and video make it a keeper to watch and listen to over and over again!God Bless!
0446677450|4.0|In his debut book, Robert Kiyosaki launches his \\"Rich Dad\\" brand that now gets him an easy several million whenever one of his \\"Team mates\\" writes a spin-off book and Kiyosaki slaps his gold and purple logo on it. I'm not trying to sound cynical. I admire Kiyosaki's business savvy and ability to turn one book into a financial education empire. This should be evidence enough about Kiyosaki's financial intelligence    Kiyosaki's writing style is very informal and his grammar structure is often weak. I'm not sure if this is because he is a poor author, or does this intentionally to appeal to a particular audience (American middle class?). Instead of simply stating his message, Kiyosaki uses a simple allegory of his Rich Dad and his Poor Dad. His Rich Dad obviously represents the higher upper class and his Poor Dad represents everyone else - from the GED blue collar to the M.D. and Ph. D.    Kiyosaki offers some general financial tips such as pay with cash instead of credit, buy assets instead of liabilities, etc. However, he offers very little practical advice and instead ops to inspire his readers to think for themselves. I think this works to Kiyosaki's benefit in two ways:    1) This helps motivate the readers to continue their long term financial education instead of settling for get-rich-quick schemes.  2) It protects his credibility by being vague. If he were to say, \\"Buy XYZ stock.\\" and people lost money on it, they would blame Kiyosaki instead of admitting it was their own fault for blindly following his advice.    The biggest reason this book is so popular is that it gives the reader a whole new perspective on money. Kiyosaki's biggest argument in the book is about our country's lack of financial education in schools. We go to school so that we can get a good education. We then apply that education to get a high paying job. Once we get that high paying job, we work tirelessly to get raise after raise. The ironic part is, once we get our paychecks, we don't know what to do with the money. This vicious cycle is what is causing our nation and its citizens to dig deeper and deeper into debt.    Definitely give this book a read. It will change the way you think about money.
B0015D3Z4O|5.0|After reading review after review on Madonna's new CD \\"Hard Candy\\" I felt I needed to add my opinion. To me, Hard Candy is exactly what I would have expected from Madonna. She is not one to do the same tired thing time after time. As with her changing image she is always exploring and introducing us to new styles of music. I am a huge fan of Madonna and have been ever since I heard \\"Everybody\\" & \\"Burning Up\\" way back in the 80's. Even though I am a huge fan I will say that there have been many time's I have heard a new song from Madonna and was not impressed at first listen. This was the case with the \\"Ray of Light\\" Cd and even the new single \\"4 Minutes\\". At first I was did'nt really like them. The \\"Ray of Light\\" CD was so different from what I expected from Madonna but ended up being one of her hugest selling and critically acclaimed Cds ever. Part of Madonna's appeal is her versatility. Think on the \\"I'm Breathless\\" CD. This is also another one of my favorite cds. So to tie things up I just want you to ignore all of the other mixed reviews and be your own judge. Even the biggest Madonna fan is not going to love everything she releases and does. If you're a true fan you will respect her versatility and creativity and give all of her music a chance. I personally think \\"Hard Candy\\" is one of her better CDs and look forward to more from her in the future. She never disappoints me.
B00005JPS7|5.0|One of the great pleasures of summer is the release of the big budget, popcorn films that feed the eye with amazing special effects and take the movie goer on an action-packed thrill ride!  Not all summer films achieve the goal of pleasing the masses but this new movie, based on the Marvel comic book hero, Iron Man, does just that!<br /><br />  Robert Downey Jr., the talent and charismatic actor who received an Oscar nod for his turn in \\"Chaplin\\", takes on the role of Tony Stark, an extremely wealthy man whose fortune has been amassed by providing weapons to the world's warriors, good and bad.  After being abducted and held by terrorists in the Middle East, Stark realizes the damage his weapons are doing and decides to change the path of his business.  After escaping from his captors using an armor he creates during his abduction, Stark returns to the U. S. and begins working on an improved version that will allow him to fight the forces he has empowered with his own, technologically advanced weaponry.  Thus, the birth of Iron Man, a super hero with a flashy red and gold suit of armor that packs a treasure trove of crime fighting gadgets that would make even Batman jealous!<br /><br />  Aiding Stark is Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow), his dedicated executive assistant and apparent future love interest and his best friend Lt. Col. James Rhodes (Terrence Howard).  Jeff Bridges plays Stark's mentor and father figure, Obadiah Stone, a man who took young Tony under his wing after the death of the elder Stark and groomed him to take over the Stark empire.  All three actors do a great job with their parts, especially Paltrow and Bridges.  Hopefully Howard's character will grow in the inevitable sequel.  And, of course, there is the usual Stan Lee cameo, which is quite funny in this film.<br /><br />  Jon Favereau did a great job with this movie and apparently pleased fans and non-fans alike, considering its impressive take thus far, both domestically and internationally.  Although I was a comic book kid growing up, I never read the Iron Man comic books but I thoroughly enjoyed this film.  I have to give kudos to Marvel for really making sure that their latest hero films are up to par---Spiderman (other than Spidey 3, which was a disaster), the X-Men films and now Iron Man have all been well made and appeal to everyone.<br /><br />  Grab a friend, buy some popcorn and sit back and relax with the first blockbuster of the summer!  Highly recommend!!was a comic book kid growing up, I never read the Iron Man comic books but I thoroughly enjoyed this film.

B0012GMZMW|4.0|Augeri was a perfect fit. He sounds in between a low key Perry and a melodic John Waite. Augeri has the phrasing of John and the melody of Perry.I don't know why I am the only one who thinks this way but if you listen good you will surely agree. Everybody knows that Jonathan Cain was from the Baby's and there was also Bad English with both Cain and Waite with Schon, Phillips and Castronovo. I am a Filipino and I like Pineda a lot. He can sing the old hits in the same key with Perry and he had kept the band going like Augeri. For me I buy Journey because of Schon..actually I buy anything Schon. This album continues with all of the things we grew up and loved about Journey. I would rate this as 4 stars or say in the same rate as the first Bad English album and all the other Journey albums except for Escape (7 stars) Frontiers (5 stars) and TBF (2.5 stars). Listen and enjoy.
1423101464|5.0|This is one of the best books I've read recently.  It is cool because it has all the Greek Gods.  It is a fast pased adventure/fantasy book with great dialog.  I would recomend it to anyone.
B000WGWQG8|1.0|Let's call a spade a spade--this was just not very good movie making.  I forced myself to watch every episode but the finale (my dedication has limits).  Each time I wanted the show to do well, but each time it left me oddly unengaged, as if I were getting the story second-hand from a disinterested correspondent.  Is it the curse of the American revolution, whose story can't seem to be made into an entertaining movie?
0887307280|3.0|This book was reccomended to me as a must read.  well I read it and it was unimpressive.  It may be of value to a young entrepreneur with little business education, but rather basic for someone with a degree in business.
B000ZOXDFA|3.0|\\"Elizabeth: The Golden Age\\" is a continuation of the life and loves of Queen Elizabeth I of England as portrayed by Cate Blanchett and directed by Shekhar Kapur. The first \\"Elizabeth\\" was a perfectly watchable costume drama, but never quite made it to excellence. The sequel leaves more to be desired.    Familiar themes from the first movie remain a source of contention for Elizabeth. Religious strife threatens to rip the country in half and Europe teeters on war. Elizabeth, despite the advice of spymaster Sir Walshingham (once again played by the great Geoffrey Rush) takes a restrained approach to dealing with the English Catholics. Less restrained is she in the affairs of the heart when the dashing Sir Walter Raleigh (Clive Owen) returns from plundering the Spanish. Plunder is a dish best served with potatoes. (Just watch it ...)    Of course, when devout religious believers, politics, and a megalomaniac monarch meet, things get a little dicey. King Philip of Spain, under the pretext of avenging the execution of Mary Stuart (history is a little distorted here) launches his massive Armada to England, but is defeated by a storm.    The film lacks the emotional depth and lacks pathos for the character. Also, the defeat of the Armada completely lacks any sense of urgency or desperation that the English must have felt.    It may have been Elizabeth's Golden Age, but it only wins a bronze medal.
B000P12LWY|4.0|While its not very accurate as has been stated.  It is good however to see the King be himself and the energy that he brings to the character.  The customes and sites seem to have been well done also.  I'm however not a big fan of explicit disregard for his wife and daughter despite Henry's \\"caring\\" about her.  It might have be the thing to do at that time but it irritated me everytime.  He was in a room with his wife, the Queen and the mistress Anne is there as well.  He's suddenly so in love and can't live without her.  He wants to divorce his wife because the marriage was supposedly not legal.<br /><br />All of sudden after all the one nighters with women he probably can't even remember or name if put to the test.  His focus should be more on running the country and all the other issues that the people are having around him, not chasing after a woman (that has more skeletons in her closet than a cemetary).  While i enjoyed Johnathan Rhys Meyers acting in in this for the most part and he's very likeable guy.  I can't help but hope that the story picks up for this series.<br /><br />It has some promise and i hope that the Tudors can deliver on that in the 2nd season.  I'd like to see more about the Queen, her background and other relevant issues that Henry went through during his time.
B0012E6R3W|5.0|Admittedly, I had forgotten about these guys, even having 6 Testament CD's in my collection and having had the pleasure of seeing them at a Mosters of Rock Festival in Germany in '93/'94.   From hearing some samples, I knew FORMATION was going to be a good CD however, when I popped it in I was blown away right from the beginning. This CD is a rush, turn it to 10 and hold on. Song for song it is as good if not better than The Gathering and is a much needed kick in the pants for today's metal were everyone sounds so similar and each band's songs sound the same throughout their the albums.   I am glad these guys are back and I cannot wait to see them on the METAL MASTERS Tour this summer. Hopefully they will finally get the recognition they deserve.   If anyone can tell me other new albums that are as good as this or better, please let me know as I always need to hear new music.
0446364495|1.0|This book is SO over the top I found myself anticipating the next breathless passage with actual excitement.  It also provides another exception to the cliche that \\"the book is always superior to the movie\\"---the Eastwood movie is actually a nice little bittersweet romance----if you want a love story see the movie---if you want a laugh read the book!
B000ZOXDG4|3.0|I looked forward to seeing this sequel to the 1998 release but somehow despite the great production values and Cate Blanchett's great performance in the lead role, I was disappointed. Most of the problem concerns the script which seems to lack focus.  First we are treated to Elizabeth's problems with Mary Stuart, then her relationshop with Walter Raleigh (an excellent Clive Owen) and then the struggle with Prince Phillip of Spain to maintain diplomacy which culminates in war. In comparison to the original, there was a distinct point of view but in this sequel, everything is scattered with a lack of focus. The 3 stars I give this to are the superb HD DVD transfer, Blanchette's performance and of course the battle scenes.  This is disc you would need to show off the virtues of HI-DEF!! If you like this type of history, do check it out but there are better films on this subject such as \\"Elizabeth and Essex\\" and \\"The Virgin Queen\\".
B000PTYPAC|3.0|That's what this CD is in my CD collection. I didn't want to like this band, I really didn't. I wanted to see them as another Avril Lavigne wannabe who wanted to ride the coattails of the male dominated rock scene. I wanted this to be another chick band. It certainly didn't seem like anything special musically. The guitars aren't all that special, and they cheat in the studio to get two six strings when the band only has one six string player. The bass is virtually ignored and basically follows the six strings. This had the making of a terrible chick band.    But it's not. And why isn't it? Because for some reason, in the midst of all the sell out MTV trivial bull, this seems almost credible. Almost. Now, I'm not going to penalize a band for becoming popular on MTV if the music is good, because too many people do that and it's really stupid, who cares if they get famous and live luxuriously as long as they stay true to their music. And I think they do this pretty well. I love Haley's voice, it's perfect for the softer songs she sings but then also she can turn the energy up on songs like the opening track and the singles.    I wouldn't lie to you, this band isn't amazing, but it's worth looking at if you're into this sort of thing or even if you're not (I'm not for the most part) Basically I bought this CD for Hayley's voice and because I thought it would be a fun listen, and for the majority of the CD it is. I can appreciate this music even if I can't appreciate the lifestyle or any other artists of this genre.
B000ZLFALI|4.0|The story is great, the characters are great, and the way the songs were weaved into the storyline was fantastic.
B000FP2Z0S|4.0|I thought that never happened? This band has proved me wrong. They have moved up to a major record label (Well, technically this is the second major label release) and haven't changed all that much. Is the music less angry? Less edgy? Maybe a tad, but by so little that it's almost negligible.    For anyone who knew this band before \\"Swing Life Away,\\" Rise Against mixes shreding guitar licks and power chords with a clean bass, blasting drumbeats, and vocals that scream and sing both equally well. Tim has got one of the best voices in the industry today. The lyrics are very political and attack subjects like working class issues, poverty, lying politicians, and the like. These guys are just as into the message as they are into the music, but unlike bands like Anti-Flag the message doesn't get in the way of the message, so anyone can appreciate it, not just an animal rights activists associated with PETA or the like.    As for this CD, it's still good. It's a small, itty bitty step down from their previous works because it doesn't have any of the insane, \\"off the wall\\" angry songs like \\"Dead Ringer\\" \\"To the Core\\" and \\"State of the Union\\" and the bass is totally neglected throughout the entire CD. What happened Joe? Did you forget how to be awesome like you were on songs like \\"Black Masks and Gasoline\\" and \\"Like the Angel\\" and just decide to play bland and boring basslines? Hopefully he'll step it up for the 2008/2009 release.    Other than that this is still the awesome Rise Against from years ago (not many years, but years). Songs like \\"Chamber the Cartidge\\" and \\"Bricks\\" are speed pumped anthems to get your fists pumping to, \\"Injection\\" \\"Survive\\" and \\"Drones\\" are the heavier ones, \\"Prayer of the Refugee\\" and \\"The Good Left Undone\\" explore some new territory while managing not to stray too far from home.    Overall, solid release. Not as good as the old stuff but this is Rise Against, and their worst CD would still be 100 times better than most bands best CD. Any argument that these guys sold out is totally invalid, because they still kick like they used to even though they're on a major label. You can tell that Geffen gave these guys complete control of what they produce and that's always a good thing because they produce some NICE music.
0321356683|5.0|Please see my review of the first edition for my general response. My opinion hasn't changed with the second, so I'll focus on what's new in this review.<br /><br />The second edition was well worth the wait. The number of items are beefed up to 78 from 57. The chapter \\"Substitutes for C Constructs\\" is gone, but replaced by more contemporary material on \\"Generics\\" and \\"Enums and Annotations.\\" Some first edition items have been amended to address features new to Java since the first edition was released. Some new items also address concurrency, favoring it over traditional Java threads. As expected, the cases for each item are methodically and persuaisvely made. If you are particularly interested in concurrency, also consider [[ASIN:0321349601 Java Concurrency in Practice]].<br /><br />The item discussions use boldface liberally to highlight key points, sometimes calling attention to arguments in the first edition that have been updated. If you're skimming -- the author in fact doesn't encourage cover-to-cover reading -- these highlights are useful attractors to important material you might otherwise gloss.<br /><br />It's often helpful to have practices or insights you've earned on your own backed up by a reputable authority. Effective Java certainly helps with that. More importantly, the arguments that support his items are clear, easy to read, and compelling. Anyone proficient with Java would have to go a long way to find fault with them. In fact, it took considerable investigation to determine that one item from the first edition -- \\"Provide a readResolve method when necessary\\" -- was not the best advice for some cases. Bloch addresses that issue head-on in this edition, and provides its replacement (\\"For instance control, prefer enum types to readResolve\\").<br /><br />As with the first edition, this one is a necessity for any serious Java developer.
B00133KFGW|4.0|I was wary getting this movie because I have been burned before on reading great reviews on movies, then getting them only to find out they are crap. Well this one delivered, and it is beautiful! The music really touches your soul as does the movie. The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is because of the ending. It ended I thought abruptly, and did not live up to the wonderful ending you were waiting for through the whole movie. Don't get me wrong, it was a wonderful ending, but it could have been a little bit longer if you ask me.
B000006OBQ|5.0|I listen to this CD almost every day, especially when I need to escape from my current reality. That says a lot because I HATE it when things are overplayed, even if I love them in the beginning.<br /><br />This CD, for me, can be summed up in one word: FUN.<br /><br />Just pop this in the player, sit down with a Jack Daniel's on the rocks (or whatever your poision of choice is) close your eyes, and picture Sinatra on stage, right in front of you. You can hear glasses tinkling, people murmuring, but above all you hear the clash of cymbals, the pounding of the piano, and most importantly, you hear The Voice.<br /><br />You can tell that Sinatra had a ton of fun throughout this taping, especially during the second track, \\"I've Got A Crush On You,\\" where he's flirting and interacting with the audience. The \\"Tea Break Monologue\\" alone is worth the price of the CD for me. Sinatra is in his natural element, being charming and funny with his stories and jokes. Everytime I hear it, I stop and grin and wish I could have been there that night.<br /><br />The instrumental on \\"Makin' Whoopee!\\" is beyond excellent and \\"Luck Be A Lady\\" is probably one of my favorite tracks. I can practically see Sinatra rolling a pair of dice across the table and praying that Lady Luck is still with him.<br /><br />I highly recommend this CD and I know you won't regret it!
0618680004|5.0|Richard Dawson has presented a \\"fair and balanced\\" expose of the delusional fantasy of god. All religions and sects are equally resposible and to blame, for the squandering of both life and the worlds resources, over the eons; in the name of the fiction of religion. His discussion on the fallacy of separation of church and State as practised in America makes for great reading, and should inspire us all to get the church out of the State's business. Let them pay taxes, like the rest of us, if they want to participate in politics  The book is not an easy read as is true with most non-fiction, but it is well worth the effort.  Congratulations to Dr Dawson for this outstanding presentation of the \\"true\\" truth.
0446402389|4.0|Tom Rob Smith's debut novel takes place in Stalinist Russia where \\"...it's citizens live free from the fear of ordinary crime and criminals\\". We all know better than that and this novel shows you how fearful the State of Russia was.<br /><br />Rising Soviet state security force officer Leo Demidov encounters the test of his career when a serial killer challenges his beliefs about the paradise of the working world, resulting in his demotion and threats against the lives of his family members.<br /><br />I found this to be a very exciting and powerful story. With all the cruelties and hardships the people of Russia endured.<br /> I really got pulled into the plot with the writing style. The 'no quotation' dialogue took a little getting used to, but an overall great debut.

B00011RPB0|4.0|Movie Review:  Lost in Translation   Directed by Sofia Coppola, Lost in Translation brings the audience into the fantastic city of Tokyo, Japan.  This film consumes the audience in an aura of neon lights, karaoke bars, metropolis adventures, loneliness, soul-searching, and that the connections that we make in life may not last, but are never forgotten.  Shot on location, in just 27 days, Lost in Translation presents a simple but beautiful story with fantastic performances by Scarlett Johansen and Bill Murray, stunning cinematography, and powerful messages presented to the audience.     Murray plays Bob Harris, an aging American actor who is in Tokyo to do a Japanese Whiskey commercial for big bucks, instead of maintaining his status on the artistic role call or spending time with his family.  It is immediately apparent that Bob is confused and essentially lost in his life not knowing what he should do.  He eventually meets and befriends the youthful Charlotte, played by Scarlett Johansen who is staying in the same luxury hotel as Harris.  Charlotte is a young, lovelorn, newlywed, tagging along to Tokyo with her neurotic Photographer husband.  Even before Charlotte's workaholic husband essentially abandons her; it is apparent that Charlotte is also in a soul searching transitional state, stifled by a lack of direction in her life.  Both Charlotte and Bob seem physically and emotionally isolated from their spouses and find themselves reflecting on their lives and where they are headed.  The mutual soul searching and insomnia eventually drive the two into meeting each other.  The chance encounters between Charlotte and Harris eventually blossom into a surprising friendship, with powerful camaraderie.  The audience then follows the pair on their chaotic yet beautiful adventures throughout the city of Tokyo and the hilarious encounters with its citizens.  From being shot with automatic pellet guns, running through the Tokyo metropolis, to late night karaoke in high rises, Lost in Translation truly depicts the craziness and beauty of the city.  Bob and Charlotte discover this magnificence and the meaningfulness behind loving friendships.     The journey brings excitement to the lives of Charlotte and Harris and the two ultimately discover a new belief in life's possibilities.  Inevitably, the fairy-tale journey has to end and Harris and Charlotte have to part ways.  The film ends on a controversial and graceful note which again exemplifies the theme of living in the moment and making the most of the attachments we form while we can.  While the ending may burn some people, film lovers will forever adore its mystery and bittersweet quality.      The performances of Murray and Johanssen are both equally terrific.  Until recent years, when most people think of a Bill Murray movie, thoughts of Caddyshack, Groundhog's Day, Stripes, and classic SNL hi-jinks immediately come to mind.  Although these films are not considered groundbreaking, Murray has truly proven himself to be a comedic genius.  Aside from his underrated yet profound performance of Hunter S. Thompson in Where the Buffalo Roam, Lost in Translation marks the beginning of Murray's transition into more dramatic roles.  Throughout the film, Murray does an incredible job of portraying a man who is truly lost in his life and not knowing where to turn.  On the surface it seems that he should be content.  He has a family, success as an actor, and large amounts of wealth.  However, he is able to portray a man who is completely alone, distraught, and reflecting on his life with no feeling of accomplishment.  He does this so well that the audience can't help but feel his sorrow.  At the same time, he is able to combine these feelings of loneliness with his world renowned humor in a very subtle manner.     Johannsen's performance is equally ground-breaking and compliments Murray's character very well.  Her role as a confused young woman still discovering herself takes the audience backto any point in their lives when they felt the same way.  The chemistry that develops between the two on screen is just as humorous as it is beautiful.  Charlotte and Bob are able to laugh at the people and situations they find themselves in and laugh at each other.  This coupled with their natural dialogue allows the audience to relate to each of the characters very well.    Several messages can be taken away from this film.  One is the idea of inspiring friendships, and that the connections that we make in our lives may not last, but are never forgotten.  This of course comes through in the relationship that Harris and Charlotte form.  Although they only spend a week together, the bond that they form is incredibly strong.  The love and deep feelings that Charlotte and Harris feel for each other is handled smartly and romantically, because the two know that they live in a real world with real consequences.  This highlights the subtle theme of bittersweet loneliness that is present throughout the film, which seems to challenge the audience by forcing them to reflect on their hopelessly lonely moments.  What started out as a surprising friendship develops into a deep, beautiful love story and the way in which the two discover they're soul mates will be cherished in the film world for years to come.     The idea of being lost and searching for something is another one of the prominent themes in this film.  Although they are at different stages in their lives, Bob and Charlotte are lost and searching for something in their lives.  By finding each other and sharing the experience they seem to rediscover themselves and realize the beauty of living in the moment.  At one point, Bob makes the statement that he's lost and realizes he wants to live healthier and take better care of himself.  This film is by no means preaching about health and being physically fit, but just the fact that life is beautiful and we should try and live it the best we can.  Having the movie take place in a foreign land seems to make it somewhat easier for the two main characters to see this.  Being in Tokyo, and being exposed to a different culture helps Bob and Charlotte live in the moment, and forces them to take a step back and put things into perspective.     Overall, I found Lost in Translation a positively terrific film with several elements all coming together in perfect harmony.  After watching this movie, I had many conflicting emotions.  For one of the first times in my life, I felt sad and happy simultaneously.  I was overcome with a feeling of sorrow and grief, but also a feeling of inspiration that I couldn't really describe.  From examining the nature of close friendships, to showing the fascinating and chaotic aspects of another culture, to someone's own personal soul search, there are many things that one can take away from this film.
B00005JPS7|5.0|I saw this at a local theater with my co-worker friend on a very rainy day while on a two and a half hour lunch from work (ok, we played hooky).  It was the first show of the first day that this film was released.  I think there were about 30 people in the theater.  I had to wait 2 weeks to let my \\"giddies\\" subside enough so that I could write a somewhat coherent review.  I've gotten in the habit of writing in little, categorized chapters.  Here goes;<br /><br />THIS FILM ROCKS!!!.....<br />  Sorry about that.  I promised myself I would never do that.  I can't seem to help myself.  This might be the most excited I have ever been about a movie since seeing \\"Star Wars\\" nearly 32 years ago.  Not even \\"Lord of the Rings\\" got me this stoked (and I love that series).  I read an interview with Director, Jon Favreau in the Detroit Free Press.  He described his initial meeting with ILM at their facilities.  In a conference room full of ILM staff and notables he uttered these words; \\"I hate CGI\\".  As you would guess they were quite stunned.  It's because of this attitude that Favreau is quickly becoming my favorite Hollywood Director ( \\"Zathura\\" was also surprisingly good).  His belief in using practical effects whenever possible is leading to more realistic and believable films than most of his peers.  Of course, his desire to see really cool and smart movies (like most people) does not hurt.  He really has faith in his audience and it pays off tremendously.<br /><br />THIS FILM ROCKS!!<br />  Pardon me!!  MAN, 0 for 2!  I'm being completely honest when I say this; by the time Stark invents his first \\"Iron\\" suit to break out of his prison, this had already become my favorite live action superhero movie.  That was roughly half way through.  The film could have ended there and I would have been completely satisfied.  But wait, there is so much more.  We spend the next 3rd of the film watching him transform technically and personally, and it is a joy.  But wait, there is more.  We get to laugh at his failures and impulsive behavior, and it is a joy.  But wait, there is more.  He starts to save the world, one person at a time and it is spectacular and... ...it is a joy.  But wait!!  Well, you get the picture.  By the time the final climactic battle comes around, you might think it was unnecessary; however, it is a joy<br /><br />THIS FILM ROCKS!!!<br />OK!!  Now it's just getting annoying!!  Despite the great visual FX and the outstanding action and nearly perfect story, it is the characters that make this film.  I have never been a huge fan of any of the actors in this film.  I thought they were ok but never was too wowed.  Now, I am having a serious case of man-love for Robert Downey Jr.. I thought his casting as Tony Stark was a good idea before seeing the film.  Now I'm convinced it was pure genius.  Gwyneth Paltrow's secondary role as Pepper Potts (assistant savant) actually stood out.  She brought a huge amount of depth and realism to a fringe character; impressive.  The rest of the characters/actors were equally believable and performed above my expectations.  Again, I think this speaks of masterful direction.<br /><br />THIS FILM RO....<br />That's enough!!  This is the first solo film production from Marvel Entertainment.  HUGE KUDOS!!  They obviously know their core product much better than the Hollywood regulars.  They recently announced their plans through 2011.  In the next few years we will get to see a new and hopefully better Hulk, Captain America, Mighty Thor, more Iron Man and Nick Fury; Agent of SHEILD.  All of these films will be connected in some way and seem to be pointing at a culmination in an \\"Avengers\\" film.  If Marvel keep their focus and stick to what worked so brilliantly in \\"Iron Man\\" we are all in for a real treat!!<br /><br />A WORD TO PARENTS<br />There is one sex scene in this film.  It's a bit rough (physically speaking). Though no real nudity occurs it might be more than you'd like your kids to see.  Some of the violence could be too intense for younger or sensitive kids<br /><br />Did I mention that THIS FILM ROCKS!?!?!?  Just checking.ensitive kids    Did I mention that THIS FILM ROCKS!?!?!?

0060254920|1.0|With all the hype surrounding this book, I was excited to get this for my six year old daughter.  She loves books, but neither she nor I could get the point of this.  The uninspired writing goes nowhere.  The plot(?) is strange and doesn't promote any appropriate values for children.  Even the illustrations, while \\"classic\\", are only \\"classic\\" as they are easily recognizable; fact is, they're just not all that captivating.<br /><br />My family was very disappointed in this book. If you must, take it out of a library, but I wouldn't waste my money.
B000VR824S|4.0|Great music from the most talented in the business.  I never need an excuse to hear all of these great people together on the same stage.
0061142026|4.0|Stardust is a charming novel and beautifully written. The language is simple, concise, and to-the-point (I appreciate not having to re-read convoluted sentences). If you're looking for a deep, dark epic that's heavy on description, characterization, political intrigue, and plot twists, this isn't it. This is a light break from the heavy stuff. It's fun and entertaining. The plot is quick and has a bit of the Princess Bride feel in that it's purposely a bit silly in places.<br /><br />I listened to Stardust in audiobook format, which I highly recommend because Neil Gaiman himself is the reader, and he does an excellent job. His voice is smooth and pleasant and there are none of those little problems where the reader stresses the wrong word or uses the wrong tone because (s)he didn't realize exactly what the author was trying to get across. I really enjoyed hearing the author read his own book, and there was an interesting interview with Mr Gaiman after the story.<br /><br />A fun and easy read, especially for Princess Bride fans. Try the audiobook!!  --FanLit.net
0307276902|3.0|I read this book before the whole controversy was exposed, but I knew something was wrong with this 'true' story in the first few pages.  The first thing I thought was strange was that he was onboard a commercial airliner in his condition.  I could be wrong, but I doubt any airline would let someone on a plane as physically beat up as he described.  Next, during the dental incident, he claims they didn't give him any pain medication due to his drug addiction.  My dad was a dentist, and he told me that he would give novocaine to anybody, regardless of the patients drug history.  Also, as far as post-surgery, they could at least give him Tylenol.  He wasn't a heroin addict.  Which brings me to the next point:  He claimed to be hooked on alcohol, cocaine in addition to being a glue/gas sniffer?  The high from alcohol and illicit drugs is caused because those substances trigger pleasure centers in the brain.  The buzz from huffing gas/glue comes from lack of oxygen.  I've come across many drug freaks in my life, and none of them used inhalants as a substitute.  Then came the story of how he searched the streets of Minneapolis to find his girlfriend. The whole story seemed far-feched.  The fact that he found her in a major metropolis in such a short time seemed silly.  Finally, at the end, almost every character in the book was dead, leaving virtually nobody to corroborate his story.    I did like the book, though.  It was well-paced and interesting, and I do recommend it.  I also know how hard it is to break into the publishing industry, but that doesn't give a writer permission to pass off fiction as truth.
0321544080|5.0|I have the feeling that once they assembled the photos, then the author or editors decided upon what the various chapters would be called. I say this because the reality is the chapters broken out into Shoot what you love, Keep your eye on the camera, The logic of light, There is always something to bounce light off of - to me don't really speak to the real power of the book. Its about photography right? So just flipping through the book is actually more a delight and worthwhile than following a seemingly bare thread of like associated topics.<br /><br />The photos are a great collection. The text accompanying each photo gives a story about the shot which details something different each time - such as a story about using a bed sheet to cut hard sun for a Time life cover shot - a lesson, story and technique rolled into one. The book cleverly moves through this way, showing great photos by well known photographers over time. And photography is what it is about. The Shot. The quickness to capture what is there. One great line is that you have to make sure the picture speaks for itself - as you will not be in the room when people look at it. Basic<br />advice, but one like other basic and straight forward advice, is valuable and oft ignored.<br /><br />Treat this book at a group of mentors imparting some advice to you. While not a book to use as a tool such as - hey I want to replicate that picture - but one that will guide you by a mixture of stories, technique, talent and just maybe a little luck.<br /><br />Great for all types of photographers.

0440203856|3.0|I read this book for the first time the day it went on sale back in 1987, and while I found it mildly disappointing, Steel's obsession with the details, a fictional story weaved with true details of historical events (the murder of the Russian Tsar's family, the revolution that followed) kept me reading until the very last page.
B000QQFKYE|1.0|I've had half-remembered dreams three times more coherent than this film. It means nothing--yes, the camera work is exquisite and the acting sublime and the girls (with big breasts) pretty and the mood professionally eeire--but it means nothing. Nothing. Nothing. Nothing.
B0000AEKCG|5.0|I came to Hawkwind through Michael Moorcock's science fiction and I immediately loved them, and this, their finest work.  I own this album on vinyl and CD, and would buy the MP3 if i-Tunes had it.  There is no more intense riff than the opening of the album \\"Assault & Battery Part I.\\"  Lemmy lays down a propulsive bass over Simon House's 'Tron riif,  and then slashing, primitive drums enter before the vocals. Simply perfect, and if you want to hear this right, hear it on vinyl - very loud.  Every time I hear this song, my eyes roll back into my head and I foam at the mouth.  Lots of bands had better technique, better melodies, better smells, but Hawkwind's total space Gesalt trumped the nimble-fingers and twiddly-bits of many other proggers.  Heavy in the best sense-not in anger, meanness, or terror, but in awe of the dazzling possibilities of sound and the universe.<br />Quite possibly albums whose mission was to send you on a cosmic trip were too complex to do that. Hawkwind, on the other hand, are not afraid to repeat lines, riffs, atmospheres over and over, letting the listener float into the soundscape, rather than analyze it death.<br />Sci-Fi doyen Michael Moorcock influenced this album in many ways, from the title, to his spoken word interludes, which are not too intrusive.  The ethos is one of decay, of endless lightyears of sorrow, made manifest by the lush and chilling mellotron and the incessant beat that characterizes so many songs on this masterpeice.<br />Hawkwind never again make an album this good. Personnel changes (Lemmy was more important than these lads knew) and band conflicts made for a series of tighter and more serious albums.  Alas.  But we still have this great work to listen to, even if the only thing floating in space right now is the detritus of our unfulfilled ambitions.
0743496736|4.0|It is difficult to read in the beginning because of the recent VA Tech shootings.  However, stick with it to get the perspective of the shooter. What pushes people to commit such acts. A must read for this day and time.  People need to be educated on the seriousness of bullying and its affects on people. There is a very dramatic ending!
B0013BNY2Q|1.0|This is a good album, no arguments, but it sounds like it was recorded on a commodore 64. This is the worst audio I've heard in a long while, and there is absolutely no excuse for it. I can't understand how they can release something that sounds so bad. I really can't listen to it on the main system. Ruins an otherwise great album.
3836501899|5.0|This is a classic which sold out its first printing. BUY THIS NOW! You will have, preserved on your bookshelf the essence of what Edwin Land envisioned over 65 years ago distilled in one BEAUTIFUL volume. How can the Petters Group (who now owns Polaroid) dare to banish such a beautiful art form from humanity? That's right, Polaroid has stopped making instant film and the supply may barely run through the end of this year, and all expire by the end of next year. THIS IS A CRIME AGAINST ART AND HUMANITY!! Buy the book, then go to savepolaroid.com and join us all to save this incredible art form. JUST LOOK AT THE PAGES OF THIS INCREDIBLE VOLUME!!! You will be amazed!
B000YXMMAE|5.0|This is a brilliant and surprisingly accessible album, considering Radiohead likes to experiment and we, the listeners, were probably expecting something that sounded like it came from another planet.  But In Rainbows is a wonderful lack of pushing any envelope; this is just an amazing album that satisfies any Radiohead fan.  It's engaging and edgy and yes, accessible to even mainstream listeners who think Radiohead is maybe a little bit 'out there'.  I say with great sincerity that this is certainly their best album since OK Computer; yes, it's that good.  Taking nothing away from Kid A...I love that album, too, but this is just exceptional.  My favorite tracks are Bodysnatchers, Weird Fishes/Arpeggi, House Of Cards and Jigsaw Falling Into Place.  How a band can take five years off and still make something this good is beyond me.  Long live Radiohead!!
B00009MGGI|5.0|Short and sweet, and to the point: This is my all-time favorite series. I liked these stories so much that I bought all three books Michael Dobbs wrote that this series was based upon (same titles as the series) and they were equally as enjoyable, but with a twist. Ususally you find that the movie made from a book is not as good, however in this BBC series the movies were made BETTER than the books because the writers altered the plots just enough to make the series better. It goes without saying that Ian Richardson as Francis U. is the best there is-perfect. This series will never be re-made by anyone else to be one jot better. Highly recommended. \\"You might think that, I couldn't possibly comment\\".
B000N6TYLW|3.0|I wasn't able to watch season 7, because it isn't coming to the family channel just yet, so I bought it. I really wanted to know what happened. I wanted to know about Rory and Logan and who Lorilei ends up with. Boy this season started off very slow and it seemed to me very dark and sad. The quick wit was not mixed in the way that it was in past seasons. But in one way they finished it with Rory becoming the very strong independent women following in her mom's foot steps.<br /><br />Karen
B00005JPS7|4.0|After an eye-opening stint as a hostage in Afghanistan, multi-zillionaire weapons manufacturer Tony Stark (Robert Downey, Jr.) gives up being a merchant of death to don a high-tech suit of his own invention and fight for justice and atonement as Iron Man.  This is a top-notch debut effort from Marvel Studios and hopefully portends more great movies to come.      That said, it doesn't quite reach the heights of the first two Spider-Man films.  A superhero really benefits from having a great villain to battle; Spider-Man has the Green Goblin and Dr. Octopus, Batman has the Joker, but Iron Man really never had such an arch-nemesis, even in the comics.  Maybe the Mandarin came closest (and there's a subtle nod to the character in the name of the terrorist organization The Ten Rings), but he's too mystical to be a good fit in a movie like this.  So for a finale we get Stark Industries CEO Obadiah Stane (Jeff Bridges) in an even bigger suit.  By the end of this somewhat underwhelming climax, I was getting flashbacks to Robocop.  Nevertheless, the cast is great, the script is smart, and director Jon Favreau shows a sure hand with this material.  I'm looking forward to the next one.    The final line of the film is perfect.
B0013FNC38|5.0|Jason's lyrics and melodies never cease to amaze me. I was gladly surprised to hear that the instrumental production on this album wasn't as pronounced on his previous albums; his voice definitely has more opportunity to shine!     This album has a very interesting musical direction; you can tell how this 3 year hiatus has affected Jason's mentality and overall outlook on life. There are some instances such as 'Live High' and 'A Beautiful Mess' where you can hear background vocals coming together like a gospel choir. But Jason still keeps his laid back roots with his fun and articulate lyrics and island melodies ('I'm Yours' anyone?).    Jason keeps it fresh, revitalizing, and new. What more can you ask for? Go and get it!
B00127RAJY|5.0|This is the kind of workout I've been looking for! I'm an advanced exerciser who began working out 17 years ago with The Firm and moved on to Cathe Friedrich and Jari Love. I love intense exercise and need it to stay in shape. I also use it as a natural anti-depressant. However, I'm a single mom with an intense day job and am also a professional belly dancer (meaning, occasionally my busy schedule lets me take a gig!). I'm 49 years old, and don't have the genetics to look hot in a belly dance costume without regular workouts! I try to do an intense workout every morning but have less than half an hour. I've resorted to doing half of a Jari Love or Cathe Friedrich workout.     But Jillian has solved my problem! With 3 circuits of strength, cardio, and abs, and a short warm-up and cool-down, I get it all in 22 minutes. Her workouts also require little equipment. I took the DVD with me out of state to watch my sister's kids, and did it every day in the living room, using canned tomatoes and laundry detergent as my hand-weights! One thing about this video is that it doesn't give any guidance on weights; I imagine they assume exercisers will start with low weight. The types of moves and activities remind me of Phy. Ed. classes in grade school; they're different than what you'll find on a lot of workout DVDs. I do more stretching after the workout is over.     One caution is that you move quickly from the cardio segments to abs, which usually means you have a very elevated heart rate when you lie down to do abs. For experienced exercisers, this probably poses little risk. But if you're new to exercise, I'd press the pause button after the cardio segments and walk around for a few seconds to bring your heart rate down, and then when you lie down to do abs, try to do so in a way that keeps your head elevated higher than your heart. I started doing all 3 workouts in rotation (Level 1 on the first day, Level 2 on the second, Level 3 on the third, and starting again at Level 1on the fourth day). I'm a firm believer in keeping my muscles guessing what I'm going to throw at them! I hope Jillian comes out with more workouts in this format because there are many of us who need very short, very intense workouts!

1400063515|5.0|A wonderful book on how the beloved normal distribution fails us when we use it to explain everything.  It is well crafted, at times silly, at times playful, but always thought provoking.  The writing is what you would expect if you had a favorite statistical philosopher over for a dinner and a few drinks: sometimes the ideas are overstated and enthusiastic, but that does not diminish the quality of the thought.  This book talks about things we do not want to think about, and in the process encourages us to think about our own thinking as well as to question our assumptions about what \\"improbable\\" actually means.
B00005JPKE|4.0|This film apparently came out to accompany Flags of our Fathers also directed by Eastwood but here showing the Japanese side of the conflict.<br /><br />Unlike Flags I felt that this film gave a greater examination of the individual soldier and the personal daemons he has to face both in preparation for battle and during it.  The film gives us flash backs to some of the men's lives back in Japan, the families they left behind and the emotional turmoil they were suffering with both willing to serve the Emperor in the war effort and return to their loved ones.<br /><br />The film also examines some of the reasons as to why the Japanese lost the war.  Far from being highly disciplined men commanding officers are shown to disobey direct orders to retreat and regroup from seniors and lead their men into hopeless counter attacks.  The lack of ammunition that the Japanese army had and also their lack of troops and supplies.<br /><br />The film displays touching scenes of both camaraderie between soldiers (For example a soldier sent to their unit who initially they thought was sent to spy on them turns out to have been sent there because he refused to shoot a families dog) and also the camaraderie between opposing armies (The treatment of an injured American soldier by his Japanese captors)<br /><br />Some may be put off by the film being in subtitles and not being a speaker of Japanese I cannot comment on the quality of translation.  Still I found this a fascinating film and one I recommend.
B0002DB0FO|4.0|Sadly, I became a fan of this show after it gone off the air. I watched the entire series when they did reruns on cable, and I wished I had gotten into it sooner. It's a great show. There are so many story lines going on that it's hard not to relate to at least one of them. I just wish the rest of the series was available on DVD.

The corridor, the hotel, the stores, the illogically meandering streets. She new she was in Harvard Square, but she didn't know which way was home.\\" - Alice, September 2003.<br /><br />Heart-wrenching, uplifting, devastating, wonderful, difficult to pick up, hard to put down, informative, depressing, poignant, perceptive, tragic, erudite, compassionate, a must-read.<br /><br />All of the above describe the novel STILL ALICE by psychologist and neuroscientist Lisa Genova, Ph.D.<br /><br />Genova's protagonist is Dr. Alice Howland, a tenured and honored professor of psycholinguistics at Harvard University. At age 50, Alice is diagnosed as having early-onset Alzheimer's Disease (EoAD). The story, from Howland's perspective, evolves over the two years post diagnosis as her mind is inexorably enveloped by the spreading tentacles of dementia.<br /><br />STILL ALICE is for anyone who's recently been diagnosed with EoAD, or the care-giver of a loved one with the affliction, or anyone who has a friend in either situation. The author's message is that Alzheimer's victims need family understanding and, if available, a support network of kindred sufferers. Indeed, the book's last pages make pointedly sure you know about just such an organization, a very real one, the Dementia Advocacy and Support Network International.<br /><br />The book effectively closes in the summer of 2005 with a now rare, lucid exchange between a seriously deteriorated Alice and her husband, John:<br /><br />Alice: \\"I miss myself.\\"<br />John: \\"I miss you, too, Ali, so much.\\"<br />Alice: \\"I never planned to get like this.\\"<br />John: \\"I know.\\"<br /><br />You may well weep for Alice.

B0000931QA|5.0|Operation: Mindcrime is without doubt an essential addition to any hard rock or heavy metal collection.    This album is best heard as a whole. It tells the painful story of Nikki, who is disillusioned with the greed and pseudo-evangelism of Reagan-era America and winds up murdering the love of his life at the request of a cult leader.    Early in the story, there are numerous references to the greed and corruption in corporate America under the Reagan administration: \\"Who do you trust when everyone's a crook?\\" and \\"Seven years of power, the corporation claw. The rich control the government, the media, the law\\" -- note that the album came out 7 years into Reagan's presidency. It also touches on the televangelist scandals (\\"Swiss bank accounts while giving their secretaries the slam\\"). It even compares these societal ills to sexually transmitted disease. While some would say this dates the album somewhat, the fact that so many similar problems are still in the news makes the first half of Operation: Mindcrime resonate even 20 years later. Later in the story, it concentrates much more on Nikki's love for ex-prostitute Mary and the cult of Dr. X.    However, despite the fact that each song is part of the story, many of the tracks sound great on their own. \\"Revolution Calling,\\" the title track, \\"The Mission,\\" \\"Breaking The Silence,\\" and of course the singles \\"I Don't Believe In Love\\" and \\"Eyes Of A Stranger\\" are all great songs all by themselves.    If you don't have this one, buy it today. You won't be sorry.
B000RP4LEO|5.0|Helen Grimaud is a considerable talent and her interpretation of Beethoven's Piano Concerto No. 5 is passionate and powerful. She style is so very clear and crisp.    The first movement, the Allegro, is full of passion and emotion. The hints of triumphal marches, the force and drive of the work, can only be described as heroic and powerful. Yet this theme is countered with wit and poetry as the movement is reconciled.    The second movement, Adagio un poco mosso, is delicate and warm. The delicacy of the piano compliments the warmth of the horns and violins much like dew on leaves in morning light. The piece is sweet yet graceful and fluid for it never is too sweet. It ascends and then resolves the ascension with warm compassion.    The third movement, the Rondo, is massive. The piano seems to dance with the orchestra as your concentration shifts back and forth between orchestra and piano. The heroic seems to be tamed in this final movement and yet remains full of energy and fire. The third movement also seems to me to be most grounded in a sense of the 18th century with its evocations of waltz and military pomp.  The piano is allowed to play the witty commentator upon the regal orchestra to great effect.    Whereas in the first and third movements the piano is a witty commentator upon the force of the orchestra until given reign and shows considerable emotion and passion. The middle passage contrasts beautifully with the first and third in that the piano becomes light,lyric, delicate against the tapestry like warmth of the orchestra.    A fine listening experience.

B000HT386M|5.0|The spiritual metaphors are rampant in this intelligently and cleverly orchestrated film. When the movie is over, you'll be inspired to enjoy every moment more than you already do, and that's saying a lot!<br /><br />Though the primary spiritual messages are clear as day, you may have to watch it two or three times just to pick up on all the subtleties that make this shine as one of the best spiritual movies in quite some time... especially considering it is targeted towards mainstream audiences.<br /><br />If you don't like Adam Sandler, then I strongly urge you to give this film a try... it truly is his best.  And if you are a Sandler fan, then you won't be disappointed despite there being much less slapstick humor in this movie than his others.<br /><br />Chris Cade<br />[...]
B0000028M7|5.0|I have always considered 'Dirt' to be 'Facelift, Pt. 2,' just because it kind of picks up where 'Facelift' left off. It's got plenty of great songs like 'God Smack,' 'Them Bones,' 'Rooster' and 'Would?,' as well as the unusually bizarre untitled track (I've heard it be called 'Iron Man' and 'Dream Sequence'), that's 43 seconds long.    The Seattle boys are back with this record. I can't help but think of what a loss it was when we lost AIC's lead vocalist Layne Staley in 2002. He had such a great voice, and it shows on 'Dirt.'    Highly recommended for any grunge or '90s alternative fan, or Alice In Chains fan.    RIP Layne. You will be missed.     ENJOY!!!
B000JBWWQ0|4.0|For a while, \\"coincidences\\" have been happening in my life and they've started to happen in other peoples' lives as well, such as friends and family.<br /><br />This movie really helped me understand the nature of coincidences and how powerful and influential they can be in our lives.  I also have been opened up to new ways of thinking about how the world works, and in a small way, what it means to be human, to connect, and to relate with other people.<br /><br />Some of the concepts in this film may go over the heads of people who do not consider themselves to be 'spiritual,' but for them I recommend the movie even more highly if they are open to possibilities that can be observed but not explained by modern science.<br /><br />At times, the cinematography seems a bit... b-rate.  And the dialog can be cheesy at times.  If the movie had those two things, I'd give it a 5.  However, for what it is and tries to be, it's still worth watching and owning.<br /><br />Chris Cade<br />[...]
B000VLE3IS|5.0|Led Zeppelin's 'Mothership' compilation is really cool. Jimmy Page and everybody at Atlantic and Rhino did a splendid job remastering songs from Zep's catalog, and the result was the two CD 'Mothership.'    Almost all of Zep's hits are here. 'Kashmir,' 'Stairway To Heaven,' 'Ramble On,' 'Immigrant Song,' 'Over The Hills And Far Away,' and 'Houses Of The Holy' all appear on this two CD set. And the sound quality is worth the price of the album alone. It's so crisp and clean. Anything less than five stars is, well, wrong.    But I do have some complaints. Why didn't Page and company include anything from the 'Coda' record? Ugh! 'Early Days and Latter Days' had the same problem. That means no 'Darlene,' 'Poor Tom' or 'We're Gonna Groove,' which are, in my opinion, three of Zep's finest songs.    And, why isn't 'Living Loving Maid,' 'Sick Again' or 'The Battle Of Evermore' on here?     And the packaging sucks. Why didn't they at least put a protective sleeve on? Without that, the CDs get surface scratches, which is very irritating.    Overall, buy it because of the superb sound. It's just incredible. Highly recommended for any Zep fan. ENJOY!!!

0767827902|5.0|Anyone who buys the Mayberry image of Southern small town life will be greatly shocked after watching this movie.  Anarene is definitely no Puritan utopia.  The town's residents include adulterers, sex-obsessed teenagers, and even a pedophile, who happens to be the minister's son.  This film just goes to show that you cannot always believe what's on the surface.  Few films expose small town hypocrisy better than this one, while at the same time treating the characters with respect.  This difference is what sets this film about from the typical teenage sex comedies, which are not worthy to be mentioned in the same sentence as this cinematic classic.      The performances are all outstanding, but the performances of Ben Johnson and Cloris Leachman are especially noteworthy.  It is not difficult to figure out why both won Oscars for their roles.  No one but Ben Johnson could have played Sam the Lion.  Even John Wayne couldn't have pulled it off.  Cloris Leachman's dramatic scenes made you forget that she was a regular on the Mary Tyler Moore show.
B00132D808|5.0|Pretty Odd is Pretty Different and Fresh. If your comparing it to the previous album, its completely different, first album was more energetic and high-beat, whereas this album is more mello, easy-listening and entertaining, as well as beatiful arranged with a full orchestra.

0804106304|3.0|The Joy Luck Club, written by Amy Tan is a very unique novel that I would recommend anyone to read. Amy Tan uses a clever style of writing throughout this novel. It consists of many mini-stories that are combined into one.   In the beginning of each story, the page has a name above the title. This represents either the mother or daughter involved in the story. On the second page of contents there are two separate lists. One is a list of the four mothers, Suyuan Woo, An-mei Hsu, Lindo Jong, and Ying-ying St. Clair. Also there is a list of the four daughters, Jing-mei \\"June\\" Woo, Rose Hsu Jordan, Waverly Jong, and Lena St. Clair.   Even though at first it is a little tough to understand her style of writing, Amy Tan has a connection between all of the mothers and daughters that are in the individual stories. Amy Tan discusses the Chinese culture and mother/daughter relationships. Every mini-story is connected to each other, in that way.   The author's style of writing drew me into this novel because I was curious to figure out how she would tie everything together.   The Joy Luck Club is a novel that is basically centered on mother/daughter relationships.   All together there are four mothers and four daughters. Each mother wants their daughters to grow up in America and have opportunities, but also retain their Chinese values and customs.   \\"I am to replace my mother, whose seat at the mah jong table has been empty since she died two months ago.\\" This quote is stated at the very beginning of the novel by the daughter Jing-mei Woo. Even though she isn't very happy about \\"replacing\\" her mother, the rest of her family assumes she will carry on the tradition and she feels obligated to do so.   \\"I wanted my children to have the best combination: American circumstances and Chinese character. How could I know these two things do not mix?\\" stated Lindo on page 289. Lindo and her daughter, Waverly, have a troubled relationship. Lindo wanted to be liker her own mother as shewas growing up, and she is hurt as she sees Waverly doesn't want to be like her mother at all.   In a Chinese society, women were taught that it was an honor to become like their mother. However, in an American society, the goal is to become our own person.   What exactly is the Joy Luck Club? It's a club initially created by four Chinese women, who were recent immigrants to San Francisco that became united to share unspeakable losses and dreams.   The four women, in the city of Kweilin, took shelter from the Japanese raid. They wanted and needed to raise the spirits of one another. \\"What was worse, we asked among ourselves, to sit and wait for our own deaths, with proper somber faces? Or to choose our own happiness?\\"   \\"We feasted, we laughed, we played games, lost and won, we told the best stories. And each week, we could hope to be lucky. That hoe was our only joy. And that's how we came to call our little parties Joy Luck.\\"   Those women were often terrified of what to expect from the raid, but it never showed on their faces.   Amy Tan, the author of the Joy Luck club, that was placed nine months on the New York Times Bestseller List, established a powerful and mesmerizing novel.
B00005MP58|5.0|P&P is my all-time favorite book.  This is the only version I've seen that's really captured what I love about the book.  It doesn't throw it off by making Liz so much prettier than Jane (like the other movie versions) when vice-versa is true.  All the great scenes are there, and they stay quite true to the book.   The wit and humour are spot on.  The actors do a good job in portraying the tumult of emotions that are present in each character... the confusion, the hurts, the denial of emotions, the desire, the disappointments....      If you're doing a book-report and don't have the time to read the actual book, this is the best version for you.    If you love the book, you've probably already seen this version on A&E and are just trying to buy it for the best price.  Just wait for the next holiday and justify the purchase that way.
B00104QSOM|5.0|Set against the backdrop of the Southern California oil boom of the late-19th and early-20th centuries, it tells a story of greed and envy of biblical proportions -- reverberating with Old Testament sound and fury and New Testament evangelicalism -- which Mr. Anderson has mined from Upton Sinclair's 1927 novel \\"Oil!\\" There is no God but money in this oil-rich desert and his messenger is Daniel Plainview, a petroleum speculator played by a monstrous and shattering Daniel Day-Lewis.    Plainview is coarse and animalistic, sentimental in matters of love and ruthless in matters of avarice. Mr. Anderson opens his story in 1898, closer to Norris's novel than Sinclair's, which begins in the years leading up to World War I. And the film's opener is a stunner -- spooky and strange, blanketed in shadows and nearly wordless. Inside a deep, dark hole, a man pickaxes the hard-packed soil it shows the main character; Plainview.      Over the next two and a half mesmerizing hours Plainview will strike oil, then strike it rich and transform a bootstrapper's dream into a terrifying prophecy about the coming American century. It's a century he plunges into slicked in oil, dabbed with blood and accompanied by H. W. (eventually played by the newcomer Dillon Freasier), the child who enters his life in 1902 after he makes his first strike and seems to have burbled from the ground like the liquid itself. The brief scenes of Plainview's first tender, awkward moments with H. W. will haunt the story. In one of the most quietly lovely images in a film of boisterous beauty, he gazes at the tiny, pale toddler, chucking him under the chin as they sit on a train very much alone.      \\"There Will Be Blood\\" involves a tangle of relationships, mainly intersecting sets of fathers and sons and pairs of brothers. But it is Plainview's intense, needful bond with H. W. that raises the stakes and gives enormous emotional force to this expansively imagined period story with its pictorial and historical sweep, its raging fires, geysers of oil and inevitable blood. (Rarely has a film's title seemed so ominous.) By the time H. W. is about 10, he has become a kind of partner to his father, at once a child and a sober little man with a jacket and neatly combed hair who dutifully stands by Plainview's side as quiet as his conscience.      A large swath of the story takes place in 1911, by which point Plainview has become a successful oilman with his own fast-growing company. Flanked by the watchful H. W., he storms through California, sniffing out prospects and trying to persuade frenzied men and women to lease their land for drilling. (H. W. gives Plainview his human mask: \\"I'm a family man,\\" he proclaims to prospective leasers.) One day a gangling, unsmiling young man, Paul Sunday (Paul Dano), arrives with news that oil is seeping out of the ground at his family's ranch. The stranger sells this information to Plainview, who promptly sets off with H. W. to a stretch of California desert where oil puddles the ground among the cactus, scrub and human misery.      Not long afterward oil is gushing out of that desert. The eruption rattles both the earth and the local population, whom Plainview soothes with promises. Poor, isolated, thirsting for water (they don't have enough even to grow wheat), the dazed inhabitants gaze at the oilman like hungry baby birds. (Their barren town is oddly named Little Boston.) He promises schools, roads and water, delivering his sermon with a carefully enunciated, sepulchral voice that Mr. Day-Lewis seems to have largely borrowed from the director John Huston. Plainview is preaching a new gospel, though one soon challenged by another salesman, Paul Sunday's Holy Roller brother, Eli (also Mr. Dano). A charismatic preacher looking to build a new church, Eli slithers into the story, one more snake in the desert.      Mr. Anderson has always worn his influences openly, cribbing from Martin Scorsese and Robert Altman among others (he helped the ailing Altman with his final film, \\"A Prairie Home Companion\\"), but rarely has his movie love been as organically integrated into his work as it is here. Movie history weighs on every filmmaker, informs every cut, camera angle and movement. \\"There Will Be Blood\\" is very much a personal endeavor for Mr. Anderson; it feels like an act of possession. Yet it is also directly engaged with our cinematically constructed history, specifically with films -- \\"Greed\\" and \\"Chinatown,\\" but also \\"Citizen Kane\\" -- that have dismantled the mythologies of American success and, in doing so, replaced one utopian ideal for another, namely that of the movies themselves.      This is Mr. Anderson's fifth feature and it proves a breakthrough for him as a filmmaker. Although there are more differences than similarities between it and the Sinclair book, the novel has provided him with something he has lacked in the past, a great theme. It may also help explain the new film's narrative coherence. His first feature, \\"Sydney\\" (also known as \\"Hard Eight\\"), showed Mr. Anderson to be an intuitively gifted filmmaker, someone who was born to make images with a camera. His subsequent features -- \\"Boogie Nights,\\" \\"Magnolia\\" and \\"Punch-Drunk Love\\" -- have ambition and flair, though to increasingly diminished ends. Elliptical, self-conscious, at times multithreaded, they contain passages of clarity and brilliance. But in their escalating stylization you feel the burdens of virtuosity, originality, independence.      \\"There Will Be Blood\\" exhibits much the same qualities as Mr. Anderson's previous work -- every shot seems exactly right -- but its narrative form is more classical and less weighted down by the pressures of self-aware auteurism. It flows smoothly, linearly, building momentum and unbearable tension. Mr. Day-Lewis's outsize performance, with its footnote references to Huston and strange, contorted Kabuki-like grimaces, occasionally breaks the skin of the film's surface like a dangerous undertow.The actor seems to have invaded Plainview's every atom, filling an otherwise empty vessel with so much rage and purpose you wait for him to blow. It's a thrilling performance, among the greatest I've seen, purposefully alienating and brilliantly located at the juncture between cinematic realism and theatrical spectacle.      This tension between realism and spectacle runs like a fissure through the film and invests it with tremendous unease. You are constantly being pulled away from and toward the charismatic Plainview, whose pursuit of oil reads like a chapter from America's grand narrative of discovery and conquest. His 1911 strike puts the contradictions of this story into graphic, visual terms. Mr. Anderson initially thrusts you close to the awesome power of the geyser, which soon bursts into flames, then pulls back for a longer view, his sensuously fluid camera keeping pace with Plainview and his men as they race about trying to contain what they've unleashed. But the monster has been uncorked. The black billowing smoke pours into the sky, and there it will stay.      It's safe to say I loved this movie! If your a lover of films, you'll enjoy this incredible display of acting and film making. With a story of and for our times, \\"There Will Be Blood\\" can certainly be viewed through the smeary window that looks onto the larger world. It's timeless and topical, general and specific, abstract and as plain as the name of its fiery oilman. It's an origin story of sorts, and the film is above all a consummate work of art, one that transcends the historically fraught context of its making, and its pleasures are unapologetically aesthetic. It reveals, excites, disturbs, provokes, but the window it opens is to human consciousness itself.
B000N6TYLW|5.0|If you are even looking at this product, chances are you're already hooked on Gilmore Girls and are just trying to figure out if you should spend the money on the DVD (took me a while to decide as well).  Go ahead and buy it!  Of course, if you REALLY wanted to see Rory and Logan sail off into the sunset (like I did), then skip this one and just get the earlier DVDs.  OR... just don't watch the last couple of episodes  But even with that, it was a good buy.  We don't know how much longer they'll be showing Gilmore Girls re-runs (although if the networks are smart, they'll continue to do so until they do a Gilmore Girls reunion), so this is your best bet to continue to get your GG-fix.  For we are GG junkies after all.     Considering all the depressing things we see on the news these days, you deserve one thing you can count on to make you laugh and help you ignore everything else.
0525950079|5.0|I thought that Pillars of the Earth was fantastic and could not be outdone, but Follett came through with another fantastic and fascinating read.  Loved it.
B000VNMMR0|4.0|More than ten years after movie screens exploded with the third chapter in Die Hard's high-energy action franchise, the infamous John McClane (Bruce Willis) is back, and this time the vengeance becomes personal for him when American terrorist Thomas Gabriel (Timothy Olyphant) kidnaps his semi-estranged college-aged daughter Lucy (Mary Elizabeth Winstead).   Directed by Len Wiseman and set in the cryptic underground world of computer hackers, Live Free or Die Hard features all of the crank-induced adrenaline audiences have come to expect from the rapid cuts, frenetic camera movements, and over-the-top CGI of this millennium's action films.  It is not merely the stunts and special effects that have been upgraded, though; the terrorists themselves have now found a new weapon in the Internet, virtually using our own technology against us.  Naturally, Live Free or Die Hard takes on the same formula as the three that proceeded it: the \\"every man\\" hero of McClane battles physical combat, gunfire, and even a helicopter chase, but this time around he lacks all of the necessary knowledge to bring down Gabriel and his minions.    Enter Matt Farrell (Justin Long), a young hacker McClane is initially hired to bring into the FBI as a suspect.  Despite being surrounded by FBI personnel, Farrell seems to be the only one with enough computer knowledge to figure out that Gabriel and his girlfriend Mai Linh (Maggie Q) have created the elusive \\"fire sale,\\" a three-step chain of events that will shut down anything run by computer, which is pretty much everything from transportation to financial transactions on Wall Street.  Though often bumbling, Farrell understands the finesses of technology that McClane seems to have let pass by him for the past decade, and their relationship becomes that of a dysfunctional father and son: each one thinks they know it all but soon find out they can actually learn quite a lot from each other.      When Live Free or Die Hard was released in theatres, some viewers noticed moments where the dialogue didn't seem to match the actors' mouths.  The film had been ADRed to comply with the MPAA's regulations in order to garner a PG-13 rating.  In many ways, the theatrical version seemed Formatted to Fit Your Screen for an airing on network television or on an airplane.  Thankfully, though, the Unrated version restores all of the original dialogue, therefore eliminating those aforementioned sync issues, and returning the \\"Yippee-ki-ay\\" catchphrase in full.  Needless to say, the Unrated version also features additional profanity in shots that had been eliminated from the theatrical release, including McClane staring at Mai's dead body, releasing a string of superfluous expletives.  Some scenes, most notably the McClane's battle with the helicopter, are extended, and there are a handful of extra intro shots to certain locations, like the FBI Command.  The optional audio commentary track by Willis, Wiseman, and Nicolas De Touth offers some more insight into the decisions that went into what to leave out of the theatrical version.    The Special Features disc on the Live Free or Die Hard DVD is chock full of unnecessary extras, such as an interview where Kevin Smith asks Willis inane, and often profane, questions.  The pairing is odd, to say the least, and would have seemed a lot less like a joke if it had been Willis and Wiseman or Willis and Long or even Willis and Olyphant.   This disc also includes a downloadable version of the feature, which can be played on computers and in select portable devices.  The technology has been called \\"cutting edge\\" by studios and critics but at this time seems pretty pointless, as you can just pop the DVD into your computer if you want to watch it that way; there is no need to have it stored on your hard drive.    Also featured on this disc is a music video by Guyz Nite, an indie rock band from New York City, and a take-it-or-leave-it short behind-the-scenes package with them.  The Fox MovieChannel's \\"Making Of\\" featurette becomes redundant after viewing the feature-length, behind-the-scenes documentary entitled \\"An Analog Hero in a Digital World,\\" which is hands downs the best thing on this 2-disc set.  Any \\"How'd They Do That?\\" question you may have had gets answered, and in many ways it is more interesting than the film itself because of the insider knowledge it offers.  In fact, \\"An Analog Hero...\\" is worth the price of the DVD set alone, and it is encouraged to watch that before viewing the Unrated cut because it allows you to view the FX at work and perhaps for the first time notice the art behind them.    Live Free or Die Hard is the first of the franchise to deal with the issues of a post-9/11 society, and that alone makes it more than just your typical popcorn flick and therefore worth watching.
0785125965|4.0|After the tragic events of the spectacular Planet Hulk, Marvel's green goliath returns to Earth with revenge on his mind in World War Hulk.  Setting his sights on the ones that tricked him and shot him into space: Tony \\"Iron Man\\" Stark, Reed \\"Mr. Fantastic\\" Richards, Doctor Strange, and the Black Bolt, the Hulk takes on all those that stand in his way (including the New Avengers, the rest of the Fantastic Four, and more) as he and his Warbound turn New York City (and Madison Square Garden) into a total warzone.  While the overall story of World War Hulk is great fun, the story as a whole just feels short.  While there are a number of tie-in's to the event (but thankfully not as many as there were with Civil War), the main World War Hulk story just feels like there is a lot missing, especially the involvement of Hercules, who you will find plays a pretty big role in other featured tie-in's.  While it isn't the classic that Planet Hulk was, writer Greg Pak still continues to be the best Hulk writer since Peter David (and Bruce Jones to a lesser degree), and the artwork from the great John Romita Jr. and veteran inker Klaus Janson impresses, even in the cataclysmic final battle between the Hulk and the Sentry, which is the comic art equivalent of an exploding sun.  All in all, World War Hulk may be too short, but it is an enjoyable Marvel event, and ends up being more satisfying than Civil War ever ended up being.
B000VWYJ86|4.0|The summer of 2007 finally granted fans of the action genre a worthwhile reason to return to theaters with the release of The Bourne Ultimatum.  This final chapter in the trilogy picks up five years after the last installment left off, with an injured Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) being brought back into the CIA under the assumption that he is the mole who leaked information about the Black Briar upgrade.  The story is simple in plot and not unlike that of the first two films: an ordinary guy who has been thrown into extraordinary circumstances struggles to find out who he really is and what made him do the things he has done.  With Paul Greengrass returning to the Director's Chair, though, the emphasis is not on the proverbial quest to find one's true identity but on the literal chase, as Bourne races both time and the government to get his answers, and that is where this film takes the action genre to a whole new level.    Greengrass is notorious for using tight close-ups and jerky hand-held camera work to create a frenetic energy about his films, and The Bourne Ultimatum utilizes that style to its advantage in every frame.  The camera doesn't merely record each of the three vehicle chase scenes or hand-to-hand combat scenes; it is part of the choreography and a character in and of itself.  The camera draws the audience in actively, you are not merely watching something play out in front of you, but you are right there, experiencing everything with the same intensity.  Perhaps this is most notably evident when Bourne jumps across the rooftop, crashing through a closed window in Madrid, because the camera stays so closely over his shoulder that it feels like you're right there behind him taking those same leaps.    Greengrass also uses camera movement to enhance his tone of paranoia, confusion, and ambiguity of right and wrong, as well.  Bourne is a victim as someone who has had his past stolen from him, but he is not innocent, either, as he has succumbed to acts ofvengeance and killed many along the way.  When he sits staring at his bloody hands, the camera sways subtly, but when the image switches to the CIA chief at his desk, discussing acts of vengeance in the name of national security, the camera movement picks up, blurring the background-- in which is a well-placed American flag-- so focus is pulled to his face and the hypocrisy spewing from his mouth.  On the surface, The Bourne Ultimatum centers on frantic manhunt featuring tons of bullets, but if you take a closer look, you can actually find a deeper message behind all of the violence.    There are five \\"Making Of\\" featurettes on The Bourne Ultimatum DVD, all of which focus on the action sequences, rather than interviews with the actors discussing their respective characters' arcs throughout the trilogy.  For a film that relies on an extremely fast pace to keep the audience's adrenaline up, equally energetic Special Features only serve to enhance that tone.  One of said featurettes is solely dedicated to the aforementioned rooftop pursuit, creating a star out of Dan Bradley, the Bourne Stunt Coordinator.  Bradley is responsible for any and all sequences in which something flies through the air-- even if it's just an actor jumping-- and the seamless integration of his team with Greengrass' direction of the actors is what makes The Bourne Ultimatum such a successful film.  It's nice to finally give credit where it's due and honor at least one of the lesser-known players in the action genre.    \\"Man on the Move\\" looks at the complexity but also the beauty of shooting at various \\"real\\" (no studio soundstages here!) overseas locations, lingering on London, Madrid, and Tangier.  It is especially interesting to learn some of the more \\"guerilla\\" tactics these union crewmembers had to adopt just due to shooting around real patrons and city passersby.  Along the same lines, \\"New York Chase\\" showcases the long, expensive finale stunt sequence and how it was able to come about insuch a busy, working city.  Blips on the radar are \\"Planning The Punches,\\" a quick (five minute) look at the subtle dance of the fight scene between Bourne and Desh (Joey Ansah), and \\"Driving School,\\" which is pretty much just a couple of minutes of Damon having fun on a driving course.    There are five deleted scenes on the DVD, as well, some of which are really just extended scenes, but all of which further prove the smart choices Greengrass made when working with Editor Christopher Rouse in leaving these bits out of the actual final cut.  One includes a subplot about Pamela Landy (Joan Allen) losing her job that would have slowed the pacing of the film significantly.  At first glance, the audio commentary feels like an afterthought, as Greengrass is the only one appearing on the track, but he fills the gaps nicely, offering humorous anecdotes from production.      The HD version of the DVD release comes with additional extra features, including a picture-in-picture function (presumably to watch one of the behind-the-scenes featurettes while keeping the actual film itself on in the background), which is a ridiculous way to watch a film that deserves your complete attention.  There is also an interactive Spy Training Game that is a great way to occupy a child you think might not be old enough to watch the actual film.
B0001GMIOE|5.0|I have been professionally using my Canon 30D for over 1 1/2 years now, and the battery still works great!  I have no problems shooting an entire wedding with it. I just purchased a second BP-511A, simply because I know that it's getting older and I needed a backup.  It is really worth it to buy the Canon brand- its more than just a name when it comes to this battery.
B0015D3Z4O|1.0|Confessions was the beginning of Madonna's creative decline in regards to her music.  That being said, Confessions still contained enough merit to warrant repeated listening.  Hard Candy does not.  The desperation to stay on top, which was hinted at through out the Confessions sessions, is flat out obvious on this release.  Hard Candy marks the point in Madonna's career where her creativity actually slips behind the U.S. pop music scene. Her producers rehash stale \\"hip hop/r&b lite\\" ideas that have been previously utilized in superior form by other U.S. artists. For the first time Mariah Carey has actually managed to make a superior album in comparison to Madonna's. This is how sad and mundane Hard Candy is.  Her vocals strain in vain to sound hip but only succeed in emitting flat boring and lifeless sounds. All in a blatant attempt to appear cool and smooth with the teens. Ahhh... perhaps Madonna is saving all that bottled up direction and imagination for her new record label .....
0471267554|5.0|I read this book a few years ago and at the time, thought it was too extreme and unworkable.    Then, about 6 weeks ago, I read it again, tried this new way of eating and have lost 10 pounds so far.    It takes some getting used to, but you don't have to restrict calories, you just have to eat plenty of LEAN protein (unlike the Atkins diet), and plenty of fruits and veggies. No dairy, no grains, no legumes, no sugars. Yikes! For most Americans, used to eating bread, pasta, potatoes, milk, ice cream, cheese, etc., it will seem like blasphemy to give those things up.    Try it and you'll be surprised. I'm a cheese hound, love desserts, and have eaten my share of pasta, rice, bread and potatoes. I don't crave these things the way I used to, although don't get me wrong, I still like them. I just eat them occasionally and find that eating the paleo way is quite satisfying and my desire for the other foods has diminished greatly.
B000YENUI6|3.0|Can't get over all the people extolling the virtues of this mediocrity. I'll admit that it held my interest up through its climax in the baths, but delivered nothing thereafter. Reminiscent in some ways of The Godfather, in its portrayal of a crime family, it is also the story of a young midwife, who is drawn by circumstances into their web, and Viggo's character, who lives in the moral quagmire between them.<br /><br />As a crime drama, however, it ultimately suffers from having this dual focus, as much as from the incredulity surrounding both stories, their wedding, and more importantly their development. Several potentially interesting themes are introduced in the course of the film, but none of them are explored to any satisfaction (the screenwriter and/or director seems to prefer jumping from one to another and using them as props for a few stylish scenes rather than treating any of them with the respect of someone with anything interesting to say), and in the end its hard to say what the film is really about.<br /><br />The characters suffer from the same sketchy profiling, and while most of the performances are very good (given what the actors have to work with), compared to a film like The Godfather, the people being played are drawn too superficially to resonate afterward. The Russian mob boss is a wolf in sheep's clothing, and yet goes against his character and chooses to sacrifice his only competent soldier to protect an incompetent son who is clearly dangerous to his operation. The emotionally weak, yet vile son, meanwhile, is provided no consistent, believable persona (to use the Godfather again, he is one minute Jimmy Caan, the next John Cazale) and seems to function almost completely as a catalyst for others to play off of; a counterpoint conceived to give evidence of, or reveal something about Viggo and his father. Then, there is the midwife, who is introduced as an important character only to be dropped midway through (when Viggo takes over) until she reappears in the end with all of her problems resolved, and we are then supposed to feel her emotional journey. The entire confrontation involving the four of them down by the river struck me as lame- everybody rushing from the hospital to the dumping ground in various disturbed and damaged states to arrive at a big love-in around a baby that only midwife seems to want. What a waste of Naomi Watts. Even Viggo (who is brilliant as the film's centerpiece) has no real character to work with. Think about it: Who is this guy, really, besides a quasi-moral bad ass? Part one character from other movies, part another, is what Cronenberg's people are; insubstantial at the core.... and the same is true for his stories.<br /><br />Cronenberg's latest efforts (this and History Of Violence) are a weaker cross between early Lynch (Blue Velvet), and a later-day Scorcese (The Departed), and if you enjoy those kind of films, you may like Eastern Promises. Perhaps like the The Departed, it is more easily appreciated as a Hollywood style hybrid of cross-genre realism, and stylish entertainment. 3 out of 5 for the most overrated director out there. A posturing,\\" cool guy,\\" Cronenberg plays with and mixes Hollywood stereotypes and clich&eacute;s (a la Tarantino, even Jarmush), but he doesn't always do it very well, and often to the detriment of other aspects of the film, its story, and its characters.<br /><br />Your cinewest correspondentn the end with all of her problems resolved, and we are then supposed to feel her emotional journey.

B0015I2P0Y|3.0|I tired of this album very quickly. The song \\"Grounds for Divorce\\" is really  rocking, perhaps the best song on the album. \\"Friend of Ours\\" is very poignant and also very good. However, most of the other songs are lackluster. They just feel like they are more built than inspired (if that makes any sense). If you are looking for a great Elbow album then run (RUN!) out and buy \\"A Cast of Thousands\\" which is a masterpiece. If you're a seasoned Elbow fan then you'll find something to like here but maybe not as much as you hope for.

B000ZN802W|5.0|Even at 2½ hours, this film commands attention, thanks largely to the care and vision of director/screenwriter Sean Penn. Despite his checkered past in Hollywood (bad-boy image, married to Madonna, etc.), I've been a fan since his directorial debut, \\"The Indian Runner\\", introducing the world to Viggo Mortenson. Smart move; great film. There is little I can say that hasn't been said. The episodic nature of the narrative is a good thing; Mr. McCandless certainly found the adventure he was seeking, and his reflections and flashbacks fill in most of the holes. It's brilliantly acted, and the top-notch cast, most relegated to short screen time, fulfill the requirements. Most impressive of all is the focused, centered and determined performance of Emile Hirsch. There's not a glitch in the committment of his character. His resemblance to Leo di Caprio is profound. Certainly, everyone thinks, at one time, to get away from it all. Mr. McCandless certainly had that idea, and ran with it. Unfortunately, it wasn't well imagined for him,  and his dream was not fruitful.Some might think that re-imagining yourself would be productive, but there are too many factors involved that must be considered: love, memories, friends, accountability; it's presented well, and non-judgmental. A true adventure; alas, no heroes.

0743298039|4.0|It is so rare as to be a recorded event that I pick up a work of fiction- but perhaps it was the cover art that drew me - such lovely work that I was pulled to peruse the book. It was a marvelous excursion! It didn't really matter that the book is not fixed in a particular time frame. That left my mind to imagine and wander even more broadly afield. The atmosphere of Yorkshire, the dust of the bookshop where Margaret and her family lived, the rage of Adeline and supposed passivity of Emmeline - too much to detail here but I was sorry to have run out of pages by the end of it. It will be awhile, probably, before I pick up another work of fiction, but when I see another book by this author, it will definitely be worth the purchase!

I read the fly cover and had to buy this book.    Once I read the first chapter I started on an incredible journey that unfolds throughout this book. The story is an emotional roller coaster that grabs you and makes you hold on tight until the end. I finished the book in a couple of sittings over a day and a half and am recommending it to my family and friends to read.    This powerful book tells a gripping story from a dog's point of view.

Comparing the BD vs. the DVD in an up-sampling DVD player, there was no discernable difference.    The movie itself is fun -- like another poster said, the plot is something of a stretch, but it's got the awesome Simpson/Bruckheimer explosions, firefights, and camera angles/cinematography.

Albums that will always be on top of your list?<br /><br />This is one of those albums.<br /><br />This is Therapy?'s 2nd album and at the time they were riding pretty high on success within the hard rock community and outside also.<br /><br />At the time I personally was addicted to this album for a long time, i liked every song and as a whole it flowed and inter flowed in an inexplicable way.<br />It's emotional, from the heart, heavy, tough and delicate all at once.<br /><br />Therapy? always had an odd cross section of popularity. Between 1992-1996 at least they were pretty popular with the indie crowd as well, probably because they were championed by the NME at the time.<br />But don't let that put you off, listen to this and their 1st album Nurse and you'll get an idea of how different the NME was back then! And yes, this is a band with more than one good album in them (unlike The Strokes who I'm sure are the offspring off NME staff writers......)<br /><br />Anyway, ALL hard rock/metal/punk/alternative/indie fans would do well to have a listen to this album. I hope you enjoy it :D

B000GFLKF8|4.0|I've often found Spike Lee to be hit or miss as a director... This time around, it's a little in the middle.  \\"Inside Man\\" is a bank heist film, one of hundreds of films in a moribund corner of the crime film world. It's also a hostage-negotiation film, with Lee's four-time leading man, Denzel Washington, in the role of a police negotiator whose personal life is on the edge: at times he has the tactfulness of a falling anvil, and yet he is smart enough to match wits with the heist's mastermind, intensely played by Clive Owen.<br /><br />The mechanics and motivations of the heist itself are pretty compelling: this looks like a master plan that could work. Where the film fizzles in in the presentation of a plot beyond the clime, and the introduction of a rather ricketty set of circumstances involving municipal and corporate corruption (the bank's CEO is evil, and he leans on the mayor to obstruct the police in the middle of the hostage crisis -- not very likely) Jodie Foster plays a shadow-world heavy, hired by the CEO to make sure that his personal safety deposit box is not opened by the robbers (spoiler alert: it is their target) and, unbelievably, she is given access to the crime scene and spars briefly with Denzel, who despite his character's maverick nature, lets her meet with the bad guys.  This whole meta-plot is a dud -- it just rings false on every level, which is a shame, since the heist itself is kind of exciting.  If Lee had left well enough alone, and just made this an exciting genre film, it would have been fun.  The added-on political commentary seems grafted on and phony, it fails to resonate politically, and it an utter failure in dramatic terms.  That being said, the film is watchable and often engrossing, but it lacks the finesse and intensity of, say, Lee's far superior crime film, \\"25.\\"  It's an okay film, but it lurches to the ending.  (Joe Sixpack, Slipcue film reviews)
B00104QSOM|4.0|What I mean is that the special edition DVD was not particularly special in any way. The special feautures were short and not all that interesting. Just buy the one disc dvd.
B0013SJ44Q|5.0|Admittedly, quite a few of the Collector's Editions (from Rhino/Warners), Deluxe Editions (from Universal) and Legacy Editions (from Sony-BMG) we've seen released lately have added little to a classic album, as they've often just rehashed the same tracks.  That said, those rehashed tracks I mention are alternate takes, demos, live versions, often with a different feel from the final take you'll find on the official release, so it's often nice to see that the artist in question may not have done the same song twice the same way.  Such is definitely the case with the Collector's Edition of Otis Blue.<br /><br />First of all, you have the original album offered in both mono and stereo versions, and that alone can point up subtle difference in each track--frequently, the stereo mixes will have instruments or elements you may have missed in the mono mixes, and much the same can be said of the mono mixed vs. the stereo.  And this is certainly true with Otis Blue; for example, the mono LP version of \\"I've Been Loving You Too Long (to Stop Now)\\" sounds like a very different take from that of the stereo LP version.<br />Secondly, there are often non-LP single cuts included, and that is certainly the case here--\\"I'm Depending on You\\" fits that bill, a breezy bit of fun from Otis and his always-excellent backing band.  Thirdly, the alternate takes--the faster version of \\"Respect,\\" recorded in 1967 (even after Aretha Franklin's version had topped the charts), certainly gives the listener the idea that Otis felt the song was worth returning to, although no one's sure exactly when or why (evidently, the master tape boxes don't offer much in the way of details).<br /><br />Overall, it's a great package; indeed, the Otis Redding fan who already has all of Otis' classic recordings will not need this, as it won't add much to his collection.  But for someone like me, who doesn't have them all but wants to have some Otis Redding in his collection (and indeed, any serious music fan really ought to), this set makes a great addition.et makes a great addition.

0061537934|3.0|Another canine narrator!    Having just finished J.F. Englert's [[ASIN:0440243637 A Dog About Town]] and [[ASIN:0440243645 A Dog Among Diplomats]], my interest was piqued by the prospect of another canine narrator.    In The Art of Racing In The Rain, Enzo, a lab who never knew his father, has learned to understand speech (and form whole paragraphs in his mind) from watching TV. In this book as well as in Englert's novels, the lab narrators are fortunate to have owners who are constantly thinking out loud, recounting their lives, days and thoughts to their animals--which, admittedly, is probably necessary for the dog-as-narrator idea to work at all.    Personally, I prefer Randolph as a narrator and also the overall whimsicality, intelligence and fun of Englert's books, but there's room for Enzo in the world of dog narrators--especially for people who believe dogs have many insights for us non-dogs.
1423101464|5.0|The Battle of the Labyrinth is the fourth of the Percy Jackson and the Olympians series, following The Lightning Thief, The Sea of Monsters, and The Titan's Curse. Several new gods are introduced, and the book picks up an ominous pace as it draws closer to the finale, and the determining battle between gods and Titans.<br /><br />Percy Jackson has just been accepted to a new school. Again. And despite his every intention not to get kicked out of this one too, being a demigod with Poseidon as your father tends to attract trouble. And monsters, in the form of peppy-but-deadly cheerleaders. After accidentally starting a fire, Percy makes a break for it - along with a mortal girl, Rachel Elizabeth Dare, who has the unusual ability to see through the Mist, the substance that usually hides gods and monsters from mortal eyes.<br /><br />When he finally makes it back to Camp Half-Blood, Percy finds that all is not well there. His friend Grover is in danger of losing his lifelong dream, his friend Annabeth is treating him oddly, and - worst of all - Nico di Angelo, the half-blood son of Hades, is still at large, trying to bring back his dead sister in exchange for another, living soul.<br /><br />But all of these pale in comparison to the danger of Kronos, whose followers are growing and whose resurrection is now imminent. When Annabeth is assigned a quest through the perilous Labyrinth of Daedalus, she takes Percy along for the ride - as well as Grover and Percy's Cyclops half-brother, Tyson.<br /><br />This is the most exciting and action-packed book yet, as the darkness closes in. Real losses and horrors are experienced in this one, both private and large-scale. It is clear that the final battle is drawing near, the battle in which - according to the prophecy - either Percy, or Nico di Angelo, will have a pivotal role to play in either the victory or destruction of Olympus and the gods.<br /><br />Highly recommended.<br /><br />Rating: Very good

I have to say that this book is the most comprehensive and complete guide that I have read so far.  It includes valuable information on every major climate you could possibly encounter, as well as excellent information on various plants & wildlife, including illustrations.  The sections on food/water gathering, shelter, fire making and knots are outstanding.  If you are into survival, camping or hunting you will not only get enjoyment from reading this book, but you will also learn alot of realistic & useful techniques.  Truly the most complete and accurate manual for the money.
B000YABYLA|5.0|Juno MacGuff, is 16 and pregnant.  On her way to the Abortion clinic, one of her teenage high school friends catches her attention by letting her know that her 12 week old fetus has finger nails - this hits home with Juno that something human is growing inside of her - so she decides to put the baby up for adoption.  She finds her adoptive parents in the want-ads and the story grows from here.    Juno reminds me of the great French film Amelie - it's hard not to smile throughout this movie and the feel-good-finish tugs at your heart.  Ellen Page, who plans Juno MacGuff, is the star of the show - she's quirky and sarcastic with her one-liners yet you are drawn to her as she wrestles with one of life's toughest challenges.     The catchy contemporary folk songs round out this \\"must-see\\" movie.
B000SEIDR0|5.0|What a fascinating book.  I'm a consultant who travels and eats out a lot, and I considered myself to be a casual foodie.  Let's just say that ignorance may be bliss with regards to where the edibles come from, the definition of organic, the nasty details of slaughter houses, etc.  I also found the background information on farmer incentives and economics interesting (particularly in the wake of the current prices of wheat).  I feel I should have known much of this, but I didn't - and I found it to be great reading.  I liken this to \\"Kitchen Confidential\\" in some ways (in terms of value of content for foodies, not tone).  Eating is a part of all of our lives, yet we take the proverbial making the sausage part for granted.  As an aside, I got the Kindle edition and found that the price was better than what I found in local bookstores.

B00011RPB0|4.0|\\"Lost In Translation\\" written and directed by Sofia Coppola.<br /><br />Bob Harris (Bill Murray) an actor whose prime is behind him travels to Tokyo to endorse a whiskey for a sizable payday as well as to take a break from his home and married life. Bob struggles with what may be a mid life crisis and seems to mentally struggle with the emptiness and life questions that it brings on...<br /><br />Charlotte (Scarlett Johansson) a recent graduate from Yale with a philosophy major and a recent newlywed has traveled to Tokyo with her husband John (Giovanni Ribisi) who is a celebrity photographer. John's work consumes him and as he travels all over Japan he leaves Charlotte in Tokyo and a feeling of neglect begins to set in. Charlotte has achieved all of her early goals of finishing school and getting married but she still doesn't really know who she is or what she wants. A disconnect begins to form between the intellectual Charlotte and the work driven John and his banal, self centered celebrity friends. Charlotte isn't sure where life is taking her and can't seem to find direction ...<br /><br />Charlotte and Bob meet and find a kindred spirit in one another and an unlikely friendship is formed...<br /><br />This was a great movie but is not going to be for everyone. \\"Lost In Translation\\" is a character driven movie and is not driven by a typical A to B plot. It is about watching each of the characters deal with their own emotional ups and downs and as a viewer you will either find a connection with what's happening on screen or be left thinking it was pretentious and wondering what it was all about.<br /><br />The Good: It was great to see Bill Murray take on something that is a little outside of his norm and succeed at it and a great performance by Scarlett Johansson as well. Anna Farris also has a small part in \\"Lost\\" as an actress who has just filmed a Matrix like movie and she nails her part and gives an excellent performance.<br /><br />This was great writing and directing by Sofia Coopola. The scenes and the way they were shot were great at letting the audience know what was going on with the characters.<br /><br />The score was perfect and with the combination of great directing and acting the emotions of the characters and their internal struggles were excellently conveyed.<br /><br />The Bad: Nothing memorable.<br /><br />Overall: \\"Lost In Translation\\" is definitely not for everyone. Don't look for steamy love scenes or action packed fights and don't come looking for slap stick comedy. \\"Lost In Translation\\" is a character driven movie about people in a living purgatory looking for something or someone that will lead them out. If that sounds interesting then pick this up and give it a try.way they were shot were great at letting the audience know what was going on with the characters.

B00125WAXC|5.0|Just like the power of words used in this inpiring story and based on a true story, the film itself also carries strong words like \\"powerful\\" and \\"inspiring\\". For me, these are the movies that should be watched over and over again, and shown to everyone you know. If you love movies where the power of words and quotes are used to explain deeper meaning of things people fear knowing the truth of, this is the movie for you. This is a must see film if not for the inspiration then for the acting itself. Denzel Washington and the young and up and coming actors deserve just as much credit for their brilliant roles. Go buy this movie now!

0156421178|4.0|[[ASIN:0156421178 Homage to Catalonia]] This book is a great read for anyone out there who likes to read. I normally don't read nonfiction books but this one kept my interest throughout the entire book. Orwell describes things in a way that kept my attention the entire time. He even added some selected humour throughout which seemed to lighten the mood. Overall this is a great book that's worth every penny. I'd say go and read it right now if you're looking for a great read.
0307276902|4.0|Yeesh, doesn't everybody have more important things to do than get their feathers all ruffled up about some embellishments in this fantastic book? It's not like James Frey is the first/only author EVER to do this sort of thing to make for a better read! I myself spent time in a rehab center and this book brought a lot of memories to the surface, helped me to get over the trauma instead of repressing it! James Frey is a fantastic author, very descriptive but not too much to bore you. I found myself up in the wee hours of the morning many nights because I couldn't put the book down! I really felt connected to the character and his vulnerability. I felt like I was there! Now, isn't that what most of us read books for? To escape our mostly mundane little lives for a bit of entertainment? I really don't care that Mr. Frey \\"embellished\\" on his experiences, it made for a great read and that's what's important to me! I'm 48 years old and no longer want to sweat the small stuff. Read this book!!
B000AADYRQ|5.0|Had Transatlanticism never been released I think this album would have been rated four and a half stars. Transatlanticism was so stellar that it would have been impossible to top on the follow-up record. This is a lush and beautiful album. Nothing more really needs to be said.
B0014KD46W|3.0|Winwood returns after five years with \\"Nine Lives\\". How is it? It's like his days with Traffic, much like his last outing, 2003's \\"About Time\\" was. This is Winwood doing Winwood. At 60, Winwood knows his audience, he has his Wincraft label with a distribution deal from Sony/BMG for wider recognition than \\"About Time\\" received. Smart business, and Winwood has complete artistic control over his music, something that 1997's \\"Junction Seven\\" did not have.<br /><br />Yet, Winwood seems to be content with the wheel, and not reinventing it. As far as his solo work goes, when artistry meets popularity and sales, that is the definitive moment, and a rare moment in any artist's career. Winwood achieved that with 1980's \\"Arc Of A Diver\\", 1986's \\"Back In The High Life\\" and 1988's \\"Roll With It\\". Definitive solo Winwood albums all.<br /><br />\\"Nine Lives\\" is average Winwood. Not ghastly like \\"Junction Seven\\", but nowhere near the caliber of the aforementioned albums. The musicianship, songwriting and production are all pleasant and serviceable. All the right notes are in place, but it feels uninspired somehow. Mellow, rhythmic, well played jazz/latin/blues/r&b. Not very innovative or original when you consider what Winwood has been capable of. Has it been a nice re-visit to Winwood's earlier, organic days both on \\"Nine Lives\\" and \\"About Time\\"--the answer is yes. But, here's my challenge to Winwood: Mr. Winwood, do you still have the creative juices to make one more shining pop album that's not overburdened like \\"Refugees Of The Heart\\" or \\"Junction Seven\\", but something inspiring and classic like \\"High Life\\" or \\"Roll With It\\" or \\"Arc\\"? I'd like to see you try something more experimental like \\"Arc\\" now, or \\"High Life\\" now. I already know that you can do Traffic/Santana easily in your sleep.<br /><br />So, \\"Nine Lives\\". B-/C+, three stars, maybe three and a half. The tracks that stood out to me the most were \\"I'm Not Drowning\\", \\"Raging Sea\\", \\"Dirty City\\" and \\"Secrets\\". The album as a whole was good, but nothing overtly memorable or astonishing. I'd rather listen to earlier Winwood, in other words.<br /><br />So, Steve? Are you going to make that late career defining album? The one that all the critics, fans and non-fans sit up and take notice to? It's been 20 years now. Make us all glad next time.othing overtly memorable or astonishing. I'd rather listen to earlier Winwood, in other words.    So, Steve? Are you going to make that late career defining album?

B000Q6GUW0|5.0|I'm absolutely, positively thrilled with my purchase. I attempted to watch the \\"watered down\\" network TV version of this (not the version that aired on ShoTime originally) and am so glad I decided to buy the DVD. It's kind of tough to enjoy a serial killer show when most of the language and killing are censored out!    I can't wait for Season 2 to become available on DVD!

B0010YSD7M|2.0|The Ori plotline was pretty lame to begin with, but this 'conclusion' is even more so.  Thank goodness we're past the Ori and somebody more creative can write some new Stargate plots.<br /><br />The 'ark' as a (completely) magic pill was beyond absurd and what leads to my two star rating.  Very good (but not cinematic) production values, acting, special effects, etc - but basically, this was a two-part TV show that should have been at least a half hour longer in order to provide some believable story line for the ark itself.  The cost for a two-TV-episode-equivalent DVD seems pretty high, given my disappointment in the plot.  But considering that DVD sales are their only revenue to pay for the production, I suppose I shouldn't complain.  Still, I would recommend that most either rent this or wait for it to be shown on TV...
B000Q6GUW0|5.0|I think this is one of the most creative concepts in a long time. Dexter blends the clearly drawn lines of morality and this (by societys standards) criminal takes down worse criminals who truly don't deserve to die, but there is the problem that he is playing \\"god\\" or \\"judge jury and executioner.\\" Nevertheless it provokes great discussion, it uses weird music and great humor to contrast the darkness of dexters world, and I can't get enough of it.

B000002SE0|5.0|I don't think one will ever find a recording like this one.  The cast is perfect, and the conducting is so well balanced and paced.    Hard to believe the price for such a great sounding cd.     It clearly beats out the Pavarotti/Sutherland version-mainly because of the conducting.  Mehta is way too extreme and overdoes it in my opinion.

B00005JNJV|4.0|BATMAN BEGINS suceeds on almost all levels.  The acting is wonderfully perfect.  The special effects are seamless.  The scipt is pretty darn good.  Even better than the originals, BATMAN BEGINS revives the story of our beloved caped (or winged) crusader from the very beginning, when his parents are killed.  It goes from there to a wonderful semi cliff-hanger that leaves you eaglerly awaiting a sequel (due out in theaters July 18, 2008).    Great acting and script.  Seeing the marvelous Bale in the Batman suit is truly a thrill.  On a Batman scale alone, this would've been a 5.  But, to be honest, though it's great, it's not as good as Spider-man or Iron Man.  That's the reason for the deducted star.  Highly recommended.

B0000C9ZBW|4.0|I like this watch a lot.  It's very stylish.  Because of the titanium case it is so lightweight you hardly feel it.  That, and the fact that it's very thin.  Only four stars because of the lack of a date feature and the water resistance is questionable.  (I'm careful to take it off in the shower.)
0786838655|5.0|This book is great.  It would be good for any person to read above 10 years of age. The story line is hard to get at first but when you get through half of the book then you can really get a good meaning of the book.

Overall I would give this book a 6 star review but amazon only goes up to 5 so I hope that you can enjoy this book as much as I did.

B0012E6R3W|4.0|Testament seemed poised on the brink of mainstream success in the '80s alongside Metallica, Megadeth and Slayer, but for some reason their mixture of progressive musical elements, epic songwriting, and heavy riffing never caught on.... After Alex Skolnick left the band to follow his mucial muse into jazz, the group went through various lineups and iterations, but never landed the success they deserved, and haven't released a new album in nearly a decade.<br /><br />With \\"The Formation Of Damnation\\" the band returns with a nearly complete lineup (Paul Bostaph of ex-Slayer fame, sits in on the drums) and fires on all cylinders, putting out an intricate and heavy prog-tinged release that should hopefully gain them some new fans, and certainly please their old-school fan base. I have been spinning this disc since it's release, and I'm still very impressed. Testament manage to resurrect their signature \\"sound\\" on this disc, to great effect. Chuck Billy sounds absolutely fantastic...it's great to hear his unique vocal style again after all these years-and having Alex back playing snaky, unpredictable leads over Eric Peterson's chunky, hyper-speed rhythms is just as much fun as I remember. With Andy Sneap at the helm on production, the mastering is great, and doesn't suffer from the murkiness of some of Testanment's other releases. Very solid modern metal album with a lot of fan service...recommended!
B000046PVN|4.0|There have been other reviews on Amazon concerning the poor sound quality of this release and, while some claims have been exaggerated, they are sadly true. If this is the best remastering of the original sound source then it was obviously poorly recorded. Tape hiss is prominent right the way through, along with some low level hum/buzz on many tracks. Although the stereo separation is fine there is a marked lack of clarity and dynamic range, and loud passages are often distorted. This release actually sounds exactly like the cassette version of the original release: soft, muddy, and with prominent tape hiss (even with then-standard Dolby noise reduction). Apart from that the music is fantastic, and it's possible to overlook the murkiness and simply enjoy, but this is definitely not an audiophile recording.
B0012OQZWA|4.0|I had heard of Origin for years as a fan of progressive and death metal music, but haven't heard any of their back catalog...so this was my first exposure to Origin. I must say, I am extremely impressed, as well as baffled. How do these guys actually play music this intense, fast, and technical? You'd think they'd all have severe tendonitis by now...<br /><br />A very intense, super-agressive brand of technical death metal played at light speed is what to expect from Origin. These guys can play....the speed and complexity of this band borders on ludicrous at times. Very talented players, and oddly addictive and hypnotic despite it's speed. My theory is that they play so fast that it comes back around and slowly echoes in your eardrums after circling the globe, creating an eerily hypnotic somnambulance despite it's ferocity. (laughs-what?) This and the latest release from Beneath The Massacre have taken up permanent space on my iPod lately, despite the difference in their approaches. Fans of Suffocation would eat this up, everyone else be warned....you've got to appreciate hyper-fast, super-progressive playing bordering on the incomprehensible to enjoy this band.
B0010X73ZG|5.0|Frank Darabont's \\"The Mist\\" would have made Howard Phillips Lovecraft proud, even if he would have had to leave the house to watch it.<br /><br />Bank on it: when you see a Stephen King film that does NOT INVOLVE direction by Stephen King and the material is excellent in the first place, you're in for a terrifying ride: (\\"Salem's Lot\\", \\"Pet Cemetery\\", \\"The Shining\\" all attest to this) this film is a case in point.  Thomas Jane gives the same performance he always does but it works as the befuddled, terrified and courageous Everyman David Drayton<br />makes a simple decision with tremendous consequences: he goes to the grocery store.<br /><br />The sheer mystery and grotesque nature of what goes on is convincing by virtue of the relatively banal, provincial setting: relations between annoying townsfolk and the \\"artist\\" (Drayton) escalate when the fantastic is finally introduced into their own lives.  The scene in which the teenage boy makes an unwise decision to be a tough guy in front of the other locals lets you know what you're in for.  Andre Braugher is in this movie for about five seconds and I have no idea why: he's such a great actor and I would have been curious as to how his character would have dealt with the situation if he hadn't denied it was happening, or thought it was an \\"inside joke\\" being played by the locals.  Scarier than the things outside, though, is the religious fanatic played by Marcia Gay Harden, known as Mrs. Carmody to anyone who even skimmed the novella: the ultimate bad religious, the most irritating and horrifying phenomena in perhaps the entire tale, she takes full advantage of the situation to impose her blasphemous view of the Old Testament on the dumbstruck crowd, turning them into bloodthirsty monsters.  When the young marine is offered up to the looming horror outside as \\"Food for the Gods\\", one can barely watch.<br /><br />But the ending: this is key here.  You will never see it coming and it is absolutely perfect.  Great!
B00122M2QU|3.0|Aaah, the brothers Cavalera. No band except Metallica was more of an influence for me musically when I was young and playing guitar in bands than Sepultura, whose progressive, experimental album \\"Arise\\" introduced me to death metal as a style, and remains in my CD collection to this day. After a string of so-so albums following Max Cavalera's split from the band to form Soulfly, Sepultura returned with \\"Dante XXIII\\", an artistic and creative triumph which saw a return to the songcraft and experimentation of their early albums....when I heard that Max was reuniting with his brother for this project, I was excited at the prospect of a follow-up to \\"Dante\\", but after spinning this a few times, I'm a bit underwhelmed.<br /><br />Admittedly, I have never really enjoyed Soulfly. Max has a tendency towards repetition in his delivery which I find a bit annoying (singing far too many choruses exactly the same over and over for example) and Soulfly mostly lacked the prog tendencies I enjoyed so much in earlier Sep. Unfortunately, Max's Soulfly influence is all over this disc, and despite moments of ferocity, heaviness and complexity, this comes off, much like Soulfly in my opinion, as Sepultura-lite. It's decent metal with some very heavy riffing and occasional progressive flourishes, nothing more.
B000WC3AKI|5.0|This movie has never looked or sounded better or clear than this remastered edition. The new featurette is a nice added touch to the extra's.  This is a fun, entertaining movie. What cracks me up is on the dvd cover. Rated PG-13 Parents Strongly Cautioned, \\"Intense Depiction of Very Bad Weather\\". HA HA !  Yeah we all know how scary very bad weather can be to someone 13 or under lol. This \\"remastered\\" version looks and sounds excellent, much better than the previous dvd release. I watched this on a new Oppo upconverting dvd player and couldn't believe how good it looked. The sound is great, the picture is fabulous, I'd go so far as to say from the reviews I've seen this looks and sounds better than the blu-ray version. It's worth buying even if you own the previous version on dvd.
1586210661|4.0|I really enjoy listening to David Sedaris and consequently I really enjoy this book-on-CD, however, I find that the collection of stories -- while varied -- are not as uniformly funny as found in DRESS YOUR FAMILY IN CORDUROY AND DENIM, which I find much more uniformly funny. That said, there's quite a few gems on ME TALK PRETTY ONE DAY! A must for any Sedaris fan.

B000VAPZM2|5.0|It's summer vacation and the gang from East High is headed out to the local country club, either as members or as employees.  Sweethearts Troy (Zac Efron) and Gabriella (Vanessa Hudgens) are hard at work but still have plenty of time for near-smooches.  Sharpay (Ashley Tisdale), the club owners' daughter, has her eye on Troy, too, and is wooing him with a possible college scholarship.<br /><br />This is one fun musical.  All the high school stereotypes are here - the jocks, the brainiacs, the snobs, singing and dancing their way into our hearts.  There's a big musical number about every five minutes and the productions are energetic and fun.  Clearly aimed at the pre-teen audience, this movie is full of young, good-looking actors who make being seventeen look like the Most.  Fun.  Ever.  Efron and Hudgens are an adorable and wholesome couple while Tisdale is the teen witch you love to hate.<br /><br />The desert setting is beautiful and the movie oozes happiness while stressing the value of friendship.  Disney brings the old Judy Garland-Mickey Rooney-type teenage musical to the current generation in fine style.

B0015AARJI|5.0|This is a great controller and something that should have definitely come out with the Launch of the PS3. The Rumble function, just like the DS2 is great. It is capable of very subtle shakes all the way to a very forceful rumble. This controller is heavier than the Sixaxis, but the extra weight makes it feel more substantial and less flimsy. As for battery life, it is not bad, it might not be as good as the sixaxis but it still lasts plenty of time. I have been using it for many hours on GTA4 and the battery indicator has not dropped down yet.
B000MG1ZGA|5.0|The Doors, one of the best rock bands of all time, stayed together just long enough (they almost disbanded prior to this due to Jim's unpredictable personality) to release what is considered by lots to be their best album. I actually agree with those people, since music is a subjective matter, and when the masses agree that something is the best, it usually isn't. At least in this reviewers opinion. Actually, comparing this album to other \\"classics\\" I feel that this one is horribly underrated. It just may very well be my all time favorite album.     This album is a masterpiece in every sense of the word. It's about as perfect as album's get (remember, there's no such thing as a \\"perfect\\" album)The album has a great track sequence, which is crucial to an album's integrity. It closes itself off perfectly with the soft, eerie, great, \\"Riders on the Storm\\" Jim's voice is very harsh, raspy, and hoarse compared to the previous five albums, and I think it's better this way! Just imagine the soft-spoken Jim singing the song \\"L.A. Woman\\" It just wouldn't work. The music itself is pretty simple, and not trying to do anything too fancy. Which is why I love the Doors, they were a straight up rock band.     Just take my word for it, this album is great, and deserves to be admired by all. The song \\"L.A. Woman\\" is one of the best songs ever made, and is my favorite Doors track. Hell, maybe even my favorite song ever. Who doesn't love the line \\"Mr. Mojo Rising\\"?    This album cannot be any more recommended.
B000LE0THO|5.0|I have always been a late 70's rock fan.  When I first bought this as an record album I wore the vinyl down until the grooves were dull and flat.  Now with the CD version that same excellent sound is there.  This album shows more range of the group then any of ELO's other albums.  This album was the turning point of the group from Classic Rock with violins too Pop-rock and the high tech sound, like in their albums Discovery and Time. To know Electric Light Orchestra you need to own this album, Out of the Blue.
B00000DOZB|5.0|I don't really see the point bothering with any of the other recently released versions of Relayer.  This original 1990 version sounds quite phenomenal to me.  The price is reasonable, too.      As for the songs, \\"The Gates of Delirium\\" is a MAGNIFICENT song!  It goes through many different shifts and segments, and the variety of emotions that each musical idea brings to the table totally amazes me each time I hear it.  After 17 minutes or so, it all leads up to the very satisfying, heavenly vocal melody conclusion from Jon Anderson.  \\"Sound Chaser\\" initially sounds like just a bunch of messy scattered ideas that don't seem to fit together, however, with repeated listens you gradually begin to form something incredible out of those MANY musical ideas.    The final track is neat too.  The vocals are similar to the other Yes song called \\"Onward\\", but the amount of creative ideas are overwhelming.  A very dreamy and special song.  I love this album and probably consider it the best Yes album.
B0016HNOXQ|5.0|For those who've heard of the band Silver Apples, I would draw extremely strong parallels between that band's music from 40 years ago and Portishead's new album.  Beth Gibbon's voice is as unique as ever, but the repetitive drums and droning synths warrant a mention of Silver Apples' late '60s experimental sounds.  This album is light years away from Portishead's previous two offerings, but if you're a fan of the minimal sound served up by Silver Apples, Third may be just right for you.  If you can't listen before you buy Third, hopefully this comparison helps a bit...
B000ION79Y|1.0|Traditionally, reaction to Steven Seagal's DTV releases is a mixed bag. Movies largely deemed good (like [[ASIN:B000VECACQ Urban Justice]]) have obvious detractors and even ones generally considered crap have their fans (like [[ASIN:B00009ZPTZ Out for a Kill]], venerated in [[ASIN:1845769279 Seagalogy: A Study of the Ass-Kicking Films of Steven Seagal]]). Basically, each of Seagal's films has its fans and haters, no matter how bad or good it is. However, if there is a film of which the quality almost all Seagal devotees agree on, it's \\"Attack Force\\" - a sloppy, long-winded mess that highlights just about all of our hero's faults and inefficiencies.<br /><br />Trying to explain the plot is a chore within itself, so here's the barest rendition: Seagal is the leader of a military strike team that gets wiped out in Paris by a prostitute juiced up on CTX - a drug that turns anybody into a vicious, remorseless killing machine. Upon finding out that CTX is funded by the military, Seagal must evade assassination from the inside whilst leading another team to stop the drug from being released into the city water supply.<br /><br />Like I mentioned before, the film encompasses everything that critics like to sneer at Seagal for: in addition to the plot that quickly descends into something totally incomprehensible (did anybody besides me realize that the ending offers absolutely no resolution?), the film's production is dark and dreary, the fight choreography is lacklustre, and Seagal is out-of-shape, uninspired in his acting, and has large portions of his voice dubbed by another actor. That last aspect is what really breaks the movie: in the past, small segments of the aikido master's dialogue have been voiced over in post-production, but in \\"Attack Force\\", roughly half of the film sees Seagal's lines being dubbed by someone who sounds only vaguely like him. This is done so obviously - even when Seagal is in clear sight and his lips do not match the words heard by audiences - that casual viewers will begin to wonder what the heck is going on. (supposedly this is because the film's storyline was altered during post-production after Seagal's scenes were shot; the original plot featured Seagal battling aliens)<br /><br />So, with a storyline that few will be able to follow and a star who is not speaking for himself, we fall back on a handful of braindead action scenes, a supporting cast that never believes in the script in the first place and whose biggest star is Dwayne Dixon from [[ASIN:B00006JDVV Reign of Fire]], sets so consistently dark that viewers who keep watching will end up depressed, and Seagal feeding his ego by smooching Lisa \\"Tia\\" Lovnrand, who looks to be about thirty years younger than him. The issue of the fight scenes is particularly lamentable, since at one point we see Seagal donning wrist-mounted blades to fight his foes; capitalizing on something cool like this could have potentially saved the film from complete oblivion, but sadly, we're treated to short, quick-cut fights that are less frequent than the uninspired shootouts.<br /><br />Needless to say, this is probably the lowest that Seagal can afford to sink before even small-name studios stop putting him in their films. Watching a film like \\"Attack Force\\" can make you wonder if this is really the same man whose most successful film grossed over $156 million fifteen years ago and who has rubbed shoulders with the likes of Tommy Lee Jones and Kurt Russell. \\"Attack Force\\" is by no means a must-watch, even for Seagal fans, and it is sure to grace the collections of only the most die-hard of devotees.wers will begin to wonder what the heck is going on.

B00004THAY|5.0|This is a really easy, relaxing listen. Very enjoyable. The best of the best. Can't miss with this one.
B000050FEN|4.0|This film certainly does have tremendous impact. With it's intelligent dialoge, rapid pacing and shocking revelations, you can't help but be enthralled. A serial killer leaves a very gruesome trail of symbolic murders based on the Seven Deadly Sins that two detectives follow and try to piece together like a puzzle. After five of the murders are done, the killer turns himself in with two more murders to go that end up pointing to two of the least likely of victims.    This is not your typical serial killer slasher film. The killer (John Doe brilliantly played by Kevin Spacey) is not motivated by sexual gratification or hatred towards women or a mother obsession of any kind. He feels that he is a teacher of some sorts teaching society about it's own apathetic ways that we simply don't care what we do to ourselves and to each other. We don't see the murders take place, only the aftermath and the messages he leaves at each scene for our two detectives to decipher. He uses the Seven Deadly Sins as his weapons of choice \\"turning the sin against the sinner\\". Glutony is represented by an obese man forced to eat spagetti at gun-point until he bursts over a period of twelve hours. Greed is carried out by forcing an infamous defense lawyer to cut exactly one pound of his own flesh resulting in his bleeding to death. Sloth is done by keeping a known drug dealer and pedophile bed ridden with constant drug ingestions for exactly one year (the only victim who actually survives, but in a vegitated state). Lust is done with a prostitute who's client is forced to penetrate her with a strap-on artificial penis with a jagged blade on the end. Pride ends up with a wealthy fashion model disfigured (cut off her nose to spite her face) and given a choice to either call for help or committ suicide (which she does). The last two (Envy and Rath) result in the climatic twist of the plot that I won't reveal.    Detectives Somerset and Mills (equally played well by Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt respectively) are at opposite ends with each other. Somerset is a seasoned, wise but embittered veteran getting ready for retirement after 34 years on the force. He is worn down from all the years of witnessing society's degradation of itself and \\"embracing apathy as a virtue\\", to quote himself. His sense of duty has faded. Mills, on the other hand, is a young idealist and somewhat an optimist feeling that there is worth to his work and that he can make a difference. This can interpreted as to just what Somerset was in his early days on the force. Both take different approaches to their jobs where Somerset takes the slow, meticulus and methodical approach. Mills takes the more agressive and gungh-ho approach. But despite these differences, they end up complimenting each other. Gwyneth Paltrow has a small but key role as Mills young wife with an interesting sub-plot. She is saddened and somewhat losing hope with her husband's work environment but trying desperately to hold on to her fading optimism.    Great writing, acting and full of surprises make this a real thinking man's detective thriller. But despite of this, I can't help but gripe over David Fincher's over-the-top directing. This isn't film noir, it's film murkey! He takes grimness to such an extreme to where it just isn't very realistic. Why is it that at almost every crime scene, the detectives need flashlights? Seems that overhead lighting has become obsolete in this world. And does it always have to rain in buckets? I don't deny Fincher's talent as an upcoming director here (this was only his second feature), but sometimes a little restraint is needed.    All in all, this film certainly made a mark and even influenced later disturbing thrillers like the inferior Saw series (which is borderline rip-off!) But don't expect a happy ending here, this film will make you think and wince as well.
B000YAA68C|5.0|First, I am AMAZED at the fact that a 21 yr old woman who just graduated college is the source of this amazing film! Not only that, it is a product of her imagination and not a true story which is even more awe inspiring! I adored this movie. I rented this movie without really knowing anything about it- I typically skip through previews or just don't pay attention so I thought this was going to be one of those where I would watch it to the middle and just have to turn it off to do something else. HOW pleasantly surprised I was that not only was I laughing at the many funny situations but the crying- yes, lots of tears because of the despair Holly felt once the love of her life was gone. If you have not seen this film, do not read further b/c I might give away too much info for you. The whole story was amazing- from how they parted to the end when they first met. I guess it has just been too long since I was impressed by a romantic comedy. Holly was a 30 year old widow that was married to her other half for 11 years before he passed away suddenly. But because her husband knew her so well, he took her on an adventure after she thought he was totally gone. PS I LOVE YOU was present throughout the film with each letter he wrote telling her what he had planned for her or for her to just look for a sign. To feel the love of your significant other from beyond was a little creepy at first but then ended up to just have so much unpredictability to it- honestly the whole story was refreshing. I normally think it is silly to buy the book after you have seen the movie first but guess where I am headed next after this review?? That's right, friends! Gonna go make myself cry again! Love it!! If you have not seen this movie- buy it or rent it- you will not regret it!
1401300529|5.0|I'm a big fan of David Halberstam, having read The Reckoning, and The Fifties before.  This book is among his best, and I learned so much about the Korean War, the Chinese, and U.S. politics and the military of the 1950s.  I listened to much of it on CD while commuting, and read the rest of at home in between trips.<br /><br />The fact that Halberstam died last year makes it even more of a poignant \\"read.\\" He compelling wrote all his books in ways that make you feel like you are right there in those times and places. I will miss him greatly.<br /><br />Aneil
B0000E2FLC|5.0|Anyone who says this concert is \\"overdubbed\\" and \\"sounds like the studio recordings\\" is an idiot.  I dare you to listen to the actual studio recordings, and then say the same thing!  This is a fantastic concert video, and I have seen AC/DC in person many times.  Believe me, they sound better live than on their recordings.  This is a fantastic video, perfect for any library.
B0014I4KIK|5.0|I think a lot of the negative reviews must reflect people's displeasure with the obviously massive marketing effort being carried out on Duffy's behalf. Either that, those reviewers just don't like soulful pop music. In addition, they seem to be making a concerted effort to cast negative votes on any positive review.    All I can say is, I enjoyed Rockferry the whole way through, which is always a shock when I'm more used to being sucked in by hype, paying full price for a recording, and then only liking a couple of songs. On Rockferry, there were only one or two songs that I didn't love at first listen, but even then, they had excellent choruses that captured my attention, and I came around to appreciating the songs just a few listens later.     To those who say Duffy doesn't seem like she really FEELS the soul, I would say that sincerity of that sort is difficult to quantify, and whether a particular singer has it or not is debatable. There's also the youth angle... some seem to think that no one who is as young as Duffy can convincingly sing soul music. There is an argument to be made there, as well as an argument against. No doubt, the older a singer gets, the more life experience he or she has to put into the work, but I think life is sufficiently difficult and complicated that young people DO know what it's like to go through difficult experiences. Nor do I think you have to have grown up in a trailer or to have been abused by your parents from the age of two to experience depression, sadness, existential angst and the like. So give Duffy a break. She is the age she is.    Don't hate her because you hate her marketing campaign!    If you at all like soulful music, go out and buy this. Well, let me revise that... listen to a couple of the 30 second samples and make sure that this is your type of music, and if you like what you hear, believe me, the rest of the album won't let you down. It's sinfully cheap right now on Amazon, but it would easily be worth it atfull price.
0307346617|4.0|Despite reading positive reviews, I was half expecting a typical cheesy b-movie plot when I purchased this book.However, what I got was a gritty piece of sci-fi literature.     The \\"story\\" in this book is actually a series of short accounts from people who witnessed the plague years first hand. The characters range from a Chinese EMT to Russian soldiers to a Japanese teenage \\"otaku\\".     Despite being a \\"zombie\\" book. The (living) people are really the focus of the story. This book is an allegory of human nature, more specifically, our repressed animal instinct. When the securities of modern civilization are swept from under us, so are the restraints that keep us human. The things that the characters resort to in order to survive is what makes this book so scary.     All in all, this book was a great read. I recommend it to anyone who is looking for a more personal horror novel.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I just used the DVD today for the first time.  I did Workout 1 and my heart rate was up within the first 3 minutes.  I am not a beginner and I run about 15 miles a week.  I was a little shocked how quickly this workout got me out of breath.  Which is thrilling to me.  I bought it so I could have Jillian beat me into shape like she does on the Biggest Loser!!
B000KX0IOA|5.0|I've used this film regularly for discussing charismatic transformational leadership with my business school students.  The acting is incredible, the story monumental, and the dialogue and imagery unforgettable.  Despite its length, I've watched more than a dozen times, and will continue to learn from it each time I watch it.<br /><br />Aneil
B00005YU1O|5.0|This DVD is so great. I haven't watched the whole thing start to finish, but  instead chapter segments. It's refreshing to watch a movie that provokes thought.
B0015D3Z4O|2.0|I don't hate this album, but I definitely don't love it either. Not even close. The best song by far is \\"4 Minutes\\". There are glimmers of interest in other songs, but nothing else is memorable after listening to the entire CD four times. Let's just say that if \\"Hard Candy\\" was a debut release from an unknown artist, it would likely be their last. The title and cover photograph seem disconnected from all but the first track \\"Candy Shop\\". The inside photographs were very disappointing--all similar shots to the cover, from the same photo session, and not even a change of wardrobe. For fans who like to read the liner notes, good luck. The text is printed over a photo of candy corn, and is practically impossible to read. I gave up trying. Looks like maybe Madonna has too.
0793542049|5.0|This book and CD are an excellent guide on how to build walking bass lines.  The exercises start very simply (root, root and fifth, chromatic approach etc..) and build skills steadily.  Highly recommended if (like me) you don't find it easy to construct good bass lines.
B000UZPIAW|5.0|Okay, I have to be honest and apologize at the start:  I am not and have never been a fan of Motley Crue.  I have seen them perform live three times as opening act for Aerosmith, and disliked their stage act more each time.  Still, I find the band members somewhat intriguing.    I bought this book because of my utter fascination with the addictive personality.  I have always wanted to understand how it is that some people follow this path with knowledge aforethought.  And this book was a brazen, honest, frightening eye opener.   I know that the book was a somewhat sanitized \\"diary\\" of a year in the life of Nikki Sixx at his addled, drug-addicted worst.  Notwithstanding the clean-up, it appears to me that the content and even the tone of the diary was unchanged. I say this mostly because what is left IN the diary paints as demented and demonic a picture of drug addiiction as I have ever read (and let's face it some of the facts given are downright disgusting).   So I take it at face value, and what a value that is.    I think I read this book in one sitting.  Sixx's tale of degradation is one that is enlightening, maddening and pathetic all at the same time.  I found it utterly riveting in its tale of drug devouring, women devouring and soul devouring activities.  Sixx is not without a sense of humour even as he describes his drug-induced paranoia.  But without question there was a sadness in this telling that pervades the entire book.  Sadness for the loss of health, independence, trust, music (okay, I don't like it, but he clearly did).  Above all, it was an honest attempt to justify a lifestyle that really defines the term \\"decadent.\\"  I don't think it succeeded in this last, but the effort was worthwhile because of the humanity it exposes.    Everyone should read this book.  Yes Nikki Sixx survived; yes he returned to music and seems to have a family that matters to him.  That he published this diary and uses the profits to support efforts to help runaway teens is laudatory.  But there is so more to this tale than the redemption.  Under all the hair, makeup, leather, chains and tattoos, there beats the heart of a genuinely shattered human being who has tried to share the downward spiral that got him there.  And while he appears to place a lot of blame on his family and upbringing for his lack of control, he ultimately seems to accept the blame fully.      Still don't care for the music, but I almost like Nikki Sixx after reading this book.  I hope that people (kids I guess) who are considering his former lifestyle get the hint.
0618918248|5.0|Excellent read for those who are not science oriented but seek what is true. There is a lot of logical opinion, gleaned from years of experience with scientific methodology, in the book. It probably will not convert anyone dependent on superstition. It will explain much to the seeker of knowledge. For those who have some knowledge and a reasoning perspective of reality, it will provide answers and direction in answering queries from the superstitious.
B0018CWEYY|5.0|This seasons twists and turns have renewed my interest and respect for Lost. There were no fillers due to the (mostly planned) reduced episode count and even with the writer's strike it was a solid season. There were really only 2 hours lost to the writer's strike anyway, which ABC has stated they will \\"give back\\" by giving 1 extra hour to the next 2 seasons. The quality of the show this season more than made up for the reduced episode count.    It was interesting in the final show of the 3rd season to see Jack's focus change (seen in a flash forward) from getting off the island to getting back on it. This season was spent giving a set up to the reason why without really answering the question but creating enough suspense to make it worth finding out...next season I hope. This season is about who gets off the island (the Oceanic 6, as they're called) and how, and a bit about what they're going to do back in the real world. A few other people also get off the island but they aren't included in \\"the Oceanic 6\\" and you'll also get a partial reason why by the last episode, as well as finding out who was in the coffin in the final episode of the 3rd season that had Jack so upset (but not why or how.) Jack finally finds out who Claire is to him, but we still don't know what actually happened to her. Ben's character becomes more complex, as we start to see how he manages to go from outcast to leader and gets people to do what he wants (such as Locke, Sayid, and even Jack,) even if they are uneasy in their association with him. Clearly some other Oceanic refugees have escaped the island but we don't know how yet, and it doesn't seem like the \\"Oceanic 6\\" are necessarily even aware of them.     Another interesting addition this season is the newcomers, the \\"freighter folk,\\" who may as well be the new \\"others.\\" Some are decent people and some are evil, and one will be familiar face from previous seasons. Speaking of \\"the others,\\" who they are, where they came from, and what istheir nature became a new set of unanswered questions this season. I wasn't thrilled with Rosseau's or her daughter's storylines, but it seems what happened was done in order to develop Ben's character.    What is planned for extra features is below, it is subject to change since it wasn't released yet. If you want to see more info for yourself on planned extras, run a search for TV shows on DVD, you should be able to find the site I got my info from.    Features:    Lost Bloopers   Oceanic Airlines Safety Guide   The Lost Flashbacks   Audio Commentaries   Deleted Scenes   Lost on Location - Go on location with the cast and crew of Lost for a behind-the-scenes look at the making of some of Season Four's hottest episodes.   Freighter Folk (working title) - Where did the folks on the freighter come from? Get to know them and find out what the show runners looked for in new cast members.   Transforming Hawaii (working title) - From the deserted beach to urban Los Angeles, Hawaii serves as a global backdrop for the excitement and intrigue of Lost. Join the small army of technicians that transforms Hawaii to the Island as they go about their duties.   Gun Tracking (working title) - Lost features a formidable array of firearms Get real life gun profiles and find out what it's like working with so much firepower.   The Music of Lost (working title) - The Honolulu Symphony performs Michael Giacchino's award-winning score live for the first time ever. Witness the power of the show's many musical themes as well as its innovative use of instruments-and learn how music affects the production, from writing to directing.     I recommend this season for anyone who ever enjoyed this show. You won't feel the writer's strike when watching the DVDs.
0060531053|5.0|I like this book and it is a good guide to know what to purchase and how to brew.  I'd recommend it to any beginner.  The book also seems advanced enough for the experienced brewer.  It contains many recipes and advanced techniques such as lagering and double brewing.  I think this is a great book and acts as a handbook in almost any brewing situation.
B0015UXNIU|5.0|Loved this! Absolutely hilarious. My favorite story is the one about taking French classes in France and the Easter Bell. Not for the faint of heart - very irreverent!  (We have seen him live too, if you like his books, you should definitely go see him live!)

B00122M2QU|5.0|A lot of early Sepultura fans were put off by Soulfly's first few releases, and to a certain extent, this is understandable. Max took the hip-hop / nu-metal element he first started exploring on \\"Roots\\" even further, and while still a heavy band, Soulfly left old-school fans wanting more, especially once it became apparent (by the early 2000's) that \\"phase\\" of hard rock / metal had more than run its course.    Starting w/ Soulfly's 4th album (Prophecy), it became obvious that Max was starting to lean more towards an older \\"thrashier\\" style and this was pushed even further with \\"Dark Ages\\" (my favorite Soulfly album). Now he has reunited w/ Igor and \\"Inflikted\\" is the result...    I have not stopped listening to this cd since I got it; it rivals Disfear's \\"Live the Storm\\" for album of the year. Make no mistake, this is brutal, balls-to-the-wall thrash that doesn't let up for a moment over 11 songs. No tribal beats, no \\"jumpdaf*ckup\\", no guest cameos from Fred Durst (blechh); just walls of heavy guitars, lightning fast drumming from Igor and Max's trademark bark. 'Nuff?    PS - the import version comes with 2 bonus songs, \\"In Conspiracy\\" (a decent, non-album track) and a cover of Possessed's \\"The Exorcist\\" that scorches Cannibal Corpse's version (IMO).
0756404746|4.0|I've read some first novels before, some of them are not that great. I think Patrick Rothuss nailed it on the head with his first. No, The Name of the Wind isn't a war torn epic that everyone is expecting, but what a lot of naysayers neglect to realize is that the traditional trilogy builds up in the same way a traditional story would. Let me explain:<br /><br />The first book is the introduction. We get to know the characters and the world and so on. That's what The Name of the Wind is. We're being introduced to the character Kvothe to understand what he does later on and why. The first is the first 15 years (give or take a few years) of his life from eleven on (skipping all the dull, kid stuff.)<br /><br />The second book is the rising climax/climax of the story. This is where the trilogy starts picking up in action. The next book in the trilogy will probably be the next five years of Kvothe's life. I won't even begin to guess what this one is about.<br /><br />And then the third will be the resolution and conclusion.<br /><br />I think The Name of the Wind serves its purpose well. But enough about storytelling.<br /><br />Rothfuss has made a magic system I'm rather impressed with. It's quite possibly the most original aspect of the novel (though I can see how things were applied to it to make it what it was.) Rothfuss has a scientific approach to magic, mixing in the classic voodoo and so on, but even though you can see certain elements in the magic itself, it holds its own.<br /><br />I really like this novel and I can't wait to see where the rest of the trilogy takes us.
0399230033|5.0|This is my daughter's very favorite book. We are already on the 2nd copy at 15 months because she wore out the first copy! I highly recommend it. There are new things to discover (and label) each time you look through it with your child (which means it doesn't get as \\"old\\" as some other books for the adult!!!). Great vocabulary builder for toddlers!
0060752610|5.0|Since reading Graham, I keep running into his name everywhere -- and for good reason. Graham (and his disciple Warren Buffet) does not talk about -- or believe in -- get-rich-quick schemes (those are speculation), but in sound principles of looking for solid, well-run companies, and buying their stock when the price dips. (The market gets hysterical and goes up or down in ways that have nothing to do with the intrinsic value of the company.) If other people are foolish enough to sell off a good company at a bargain price, there's nothing wrong with being smart enough to go against the market and buy a bargain. If you want to invest but don't know how to do it intelligently, read Ben Graham for starters.
0143038419|5.0|Monteiro Lobato, a great Brazilian writer, once said: \\"To be yourself requires a lot of work and a constant vigilance because everything conspires   so that we can just be another sheep from many different flocks. The world hates exception and to be yourself is to be an exception.\\"    Liz is selfish and guess what: she should be proud of it! The altruists, many helping others in a selfishly act to feel good about themselves and impress friends, will not agree of course, but finding happiness is not just a surviving act, it is a moral obligation. As the book explains very nicely in the end: be happy then you are helping making this world a better place. Be unhappy and you are helping destroy this world. To blame someone for my unhappiness is just plain stupid. It is non-sense. It is dependency showing its ugliest face. It is society most favorite game.    Anyways, the book is very good, is very sincere, is funny, informative and made the author a lot of money so people will naturally get very jealous about it (some positively and some destructively). Although I don't agree with certain aspects of Liz's personality, I admire her courage to be herself and write about it. Not everybody is ready for or want to read this book.    What made Liz very happy at the end was not her pizza, her meditation, her medicine man or her new possessive relationship. What made her happy was to be free from society, religion, God, parents, family, husband, herself and be able to taste the blue freedom.    Praise for Eat, Pray and Love!
0440243661|5.0|I took this book with me to see the doctor, who asked to look at it. He said, \\"Hey, isn't this about the big guy who travels around and doesn't live anywhere?\\" Yes, I said. He said, \\"I heard somewhere that this character appeals only to men, but since 9/11 women are reading about him.\\" Why is that, I asked. \\"Because women want to feel someone strong is in charge and can take care of things.\\"<br /><br />Someone strong in charge, who can take care of things. Yep, that just about sums up Jack Reacher, former leader of a special investigations unit in the army, now retired and drifting. But this is special drifting. Writers have all kinds of ways of telling their truths. Lee Child uses Jack Reacher to bring back the individual heroism of Robin Hood, James Bond, Aragorn, according to the interview on the product page. But I would like to suggest the existential hero, the one who finds meaning in a meaningless world, fraught with danger and death and mayhem, not unlike 9/11. As a free agent with no ties any where, Jack Reacher is available to confront \\"bad luck and trouble,\\" a euphemistic phrase for \\"a world of mess and hurt.\\"<br /><br />The mess and hurt this time involves team members of his old army unit of eight mighty handy, highly trained and intelligent people. One is dead, three are missing. Jack and the other three meet syncronously to ferret out this tangle of deceit involving the four. They had a motto back in the day: You do not mess with the special investigations. And so it goes.<br /><br />At the bottom of the trouble is a super secret military attack system that would cause extreme chaos in the flight world. The bad guys are Americans who have sold out the military to the highest bidder in an underhanded dirty maneuver for profit and gain. The buyer, of course, is an Islamic fundamentalist with death and misery in his heart.<br /><br />But the story is not about the Muslim or the inside weapons guys: The story is about Reacher and his \\"guys.\\" Remember, you do not mess with special investigations. In a crazy world two things are consistent about Reacher: his loyalty and his retribution.<br /><br />Lee Child's novels are not one action-filled moment after the other. Instead, they are realistic. There is much waiting and investigating before action is inevitable. I find the Reacher series to be a thinking person's action thriller. Reacher may carry a travel toothbrush in his pocket, however his travels are the author's means to reaching a new end...and the next book in a very enjoyable series. And my doctor is right--it's good to know someone strong can take charge, even if it is in fiction.vestigations.

B000UZNSWM|5.0|This book is an amazingly thorough analysis of  a war which we do often have the chance to read about.  Some wars, like the American Civil War, have been the subject of thousands of books; others are not nearly so well studied.  The Korean War is in the latter category, but, after reading Halberstam's extraordinarily thoughtful, well-researched treatment of this subject, I, for one, feel at last that I have a far better understanding of what went on over there, starting in the year of my birth.    I have read a lot of reviews of this book and   recall that Halberstam spent perhaps a decade writing it and regarded it as among his best works. Having read many of his books, I believe this one to be the finest book of his that I have read and it is truly sad that he is not around to see, hear and enjoy the well-earned praises of so many.    Each of the major personalities involved in this war is described, biographed, and analyzed thoroughly.  The reader can understand far more about their disputes and conflicts in the context of their times when they arise in this superb biography of this war, if a war can have a biography like the life of a human being.  The Korean War as described in this book has so many, often eerie, parallels with the later Vietnam and Iraq wars. MacArthur and Truman are well drawn and the basis for their inevitable, looming conflict is well explained with no attempts to candy-coat the failings of the legendary general.    The detail of the battles and the troop movements, plans and mistakes can only be the result of years of painstaking research and interviews with so many who survived and their often tragic stories about so many who did not.  For military strategy buffs, this book should not disappoint.    All in all, this is one of the best books I have ever read to explain where we find ourselves today in the still early days of the 21st century.  After reading it, and I have read a LOT of 20th Century history by any measure, I have a much better appreciation for the follies of ego, the condemnation of those ignorant of history to repeat it, and the clashes of titans and their ideologies which the Cold War produced and which go on in other forms long after the Cold War has been consigned to the history books.    I have some 350 books on my Kindle now and have my reading planned out for a long time to come (so you will be hard pressed to find a bigger Kindle-booster), but, the format on Kindle for the maps and charts in this book leaves something to be desired and I hope that succeeding generations of Kindles will cure this fuzzed out presentation of graphics which sometimes snags us early adopters. I actually also own the hard copy of this book, which pre-dates my Kindle ownership, and a comparison of the maps and charts indicates the shortcomings on the Kindle.    I would say 'run, don't walk,'to buy and read this book, but, all you have to do is hit that button, get a glass of water, and you will have it on your Kindle.  Enjoy the many hours you will invest, as this book is well worth your time.

B000PFUA9G|5.0|Just when I think Brad can't possibly do it again, he does. This is a great CD full of funny, emotion moving music. There is just enough of everything. You hae the oh so humorous side of side that is always a pleasure and the heartfelt that just mkaes you feel warm inside. The whole CD is awesome. My favorites are \\"Ticks\\", \\"Online\\", \\"Mr Policeman\\", and \\"i'm Still A Guy\\", At the end are the Kung Pau Buckaroo bits and I laugh every time I hear them.
0143038419|1.0|From the first words of this book I was repelled. My first repulsion was the author's propensity to ramble on and on and on about an experience/feeling/opinion of hers that she seemed to be overly impressed by. Her ego was the next problem. It made reading about her experiences akin to being poked over and over again by a prickly thorn. As for her sense of humor, I can at least say that I knew when she was trying to evoke laughter. The problem was that even her self-deprecating humor was filled more with vanity than with wit or charm or anything that would elicit a smile or chuckle. I felt that the author truly believed that she traveled to the edge of reason and sanity and returned with adventurous and colorful tales. But for me, her book read like the whimpering meanderings of a very average life that could have been recorded into a journal bought from Borders and tucked into a corner. I'm unclear how a meaningful spiritual journey could be based on pride rather than humility, but to each their own path. A lot of women have experienced more in a minute than she did in her 30 plus years, which makes reading her whining tales a very uninspiring experience. This book probably would impress the minds of the many people who live sugar-coated lives and would be enthralled by the author feeling Ghandi-like b/c she was willing to give her husband everything in their divorce (not due to altruism but to release her own guilt). This in the author's mind acquainted her life with that of true Martyrs. I think that alone speaks for itself and should be enough for anyone to decide if this book would be of interest to them.
0452289963|5.0|This book is for the spiritual awakening occuring worldwide. If you are seeking enlightenment this book will be a powerful tool for you. There are many references from Christ and Buddha that will add to the understanding of their words. It will teach you how to create heaven on earth and awaken the awareness of our connection with all humanity as well as our planet.   Oprah recently ran a 10 week live webcast with Eckhart Tolle and this is the book we studied.

I printed out the four agreements and keep them in my wallet - and  try really hard to own it. I'm also reading a New Earth which I feel has some similarities so I feel like I'm on my way to a better me! :)
B000X1Z0BU|5.0|If you have a passion for music, this movie will strum your heartstrings. I felt so moved by the pure, deep, complicated friendship between the two main characters, Glen and Mar--a friendship born of musical passion, but restrained by integrity and virtue. And the music! I bought both the CD and the DVD, and even wrote my own song, prompted by the movie! Don't miss this movie, fine for all ages.
0143113100|5.0|I was surprised by how interesting I found this book about neuroplasticity. It grabbed my interest right away with a desciption of the work by Paul Bach-y-Rita, a great pioneer in the field of the neuroplasticity. He has demonstrated many times the process of SENSORY SUBSTITUTION: when one of our senses is damaged, another one can sometimes take it over for it. Bach-y-Rita claims that any part of the cortex should be able to process whatever electrical signals that were sent to it and that our brain modules are not as specialized as we have long thought at all. There are different types of application of the principle of sensory subsitution. For instance, Bach-y-Rita has provided people with devices that deliver sensory information to the brain so that they regained there senses (for instance sight). Another example is, when a certain part of the brain is damaged, to lead sensory information to another part of the brain and let that part process that information (for instance to led visual sensory input be processed by the auditory cortex).<br />Chapter 2, Building herself a better brain, is perhaps the most inspiring chapter of the book. It is the story of Barbara Arrowsmith Young. As a child she suffered from a brain dysfunction. The part of the brain that helps us understand relationships between symbols did not work well. The chapter tells about how she struggled to perform normally and how she eventually invented a treatment that helped her overcome her cognitive difficulties. After that, she has developed many specific exercises for each of the 19 brain areas that under-perform in people with learning disabilities.<br />Then the book moves on to another pioneer of the field, Michael Merzenich, who has made many important contributions. Through a series of experiments he proved the pasticity of the brain. It was interesting to read how his research was not taken very seriously at the time but is now, a few decades later, considered the norm. One of the important points made by Merzenich is that paying close attention is a prerequisite to long-term plastic change. The findings by Merzenich and his colleagues have many pratical implications. One is that we may improve and maintain memory at old age by actively staying in a learning mode (for instance by learning a new language) so that our control system for plasticity stays in good shape (read the chapter for the details).<br />The rest of the book also contains some very interesting material but the first three chapters were the best according to me. The least convincing and interesting part I found the part about Freud, but maybe that says more about me than about the book?<br />All in all, I highly recommend this book. More and more, a hopeful perspective on human development is emerging. Our characteristics are less carved in stone than we tend to think. Dysfunctions are often less definitive than we have long thought. We can consciously keep on developing our brain and our functioning in general. And we do. Everything we do and think shapes how we further develop. Everytime we consciously focus our attention, we change structurally.

B00005I44H|5.0|I will just repeat all the praise from the other reviewers, it's a great, great set. HOWEVER, it doesn't have ALL Mozart's piano concertos---almost no sets do. Mozart \\"wrote\\" 3 concertos for harpsichord, collectively known as K. 107, which are actually arrangements of other composers' music. Perahia recorded these with piano and English Chamber Orchestra on CBS (probably Sony now) MK 39222. Also, Mozart's Piano Concerto #7 for 3 pianos K. 242, and Piano Concerto #10 for 2 pianos K. 365 are not included, but you can get Perahia playing them with Radu Lupu and the English Chamber Orchestra on Sony SK 44915. [They play the 3 piano concerto in Mozart's own arrangement for 2 pianos.] So any Mozart completist who wants the remaining concertos performed by these same forces will have to supplement with these two extra discs.     But back to the set in question: No doubt about it, I like Perahia the best. Brendel is a little finicky and Marriner who accompanies him is a little too business like for me. Ashkenazy is beautiful, sensitive, and has a wonderful orchestra, but I sometimes question his cadenzas. I don't like Uchida, too Dresden china sounding, and don't like any versions played with fortepianos and original instruments.     Speaking of cadenzas, Perahia plays Mozart's, except as follows: He plays his own cadenzas in Concertos 1, 2, 4, 5, 20 (third movement), 21 (first movement), 24, 25, 26, and Rondos K. 382 and K. 386. He plays Beethoven's cadenza in 20 (first movement). He plays Artur Balsam's cadenza in 6. He plays Rudolf Serkin's cadenza in 21 (third movement). He plays Hummel's cadenzas in 22. Mozart did not write down cadenzas for all his piano concertos, so in some cases they have to be supplied by the pianist.
0938045695|5.0|I agree with the other posters...there is definitely a lot of fluff in the book. But, frankly, that's Pavel's style. \\"Russian Kettlebell Challenge\\" was the same way but definitely unorganized. Enough about that.    \\"Enter the Kettlebell\\" is the perfect primer to get into Kettlebell lifting. Once you get past the saleman fluff and to the core, you will not be dissapointed. The \\"RKC Rite of Passage\\" Workout is spectacular and it does give you results. How often do you hear that I know but it definitely works!    I have been on this program since September 2007 and I have already progressed from a 35 lb (16kg) kettlebell to what I am currently nearing the ability to make the 70 lb (32kg) kettlebell my standard kettlebell.    Pavel's method of taking each of the crucial exercises in steps is a smart idea. The RKC Workout itself is very progressive unlike the mainstream philosophy of training of doing a million reps a day to get results. With \\"Enter the Kettlebell\\" the most reps you will do for an exercise is 75 (5 ladders of 1+2+3+4+5) with rest periods in between ladders. That is until you reach the point where you can perform the \\"Man amongst men\\" workout.    Bottom line, this is definitely worth the money and worth your attention at the bare minimum.    This is the new Russian revolution...Gireviks (That's Russian for someone who uses kettlebells, you learn that in the book, too)of the World Unite!

B000VBJEEG|5.0|Great movie! The story line is very good and hold the attention of all. My 5-year old loved it and now he likes to be in the kitchen learning to cook. He's started mixing grapefruit juice and cranberry juice in the morning as a new \\"recipe\\".  My 15-year old was also entertained and said, \\"That wasn't so bad\\" which in 15 year old language means it was \\"I liked it\\", even though he had to watch with the entire family. I'll admit, I actually watched it one night by myself because I love to cook and it was quite entertaining. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because there are some scenes with guns and violence and we don't do guns in our home. If that's not a problem for you...you'll give it 5 stars.
B000MRAAJW|5.0|Bought the HD version because I recently acquired a close-out Toshiba HD DVD player.  Quality of DVD is superb.
0452289963|5.0|I loved this book...it really validated everything I believe. Living in the now is the route to happiness. Mr. Tolle does a wonderful job of embracing Buddhist concepts and writing in an easy-to-read fashion. This book is an enlightening experience and should be read by all. As I tried to design my book- it is an awakening.
1594489505|5.0|I approached this novel with some trepidation as I was one of the few people who was not that crazy about \\"The Kite Runner\\". However, I was looking around for something new to read and decided to give this book a try. I borrowed my sister's book club edition and dove in for what turned out to be one of the best novels I have read this year. I will state here it's not a GREAT novel, BUT it's an excellent read and well worth your time. In fact, I liked the book so much, I ordered my own copy from Amazon.
0143038419|5.0|Yes, this is probably one of my favorites. Elizabeth Gilbert is a very talented writer who knows how to keep her readers interest. I so could relate to her search and journey to find herself. It will make you laugh and tug at your heart strings as you follow her around the world. I give it an A+++. Read it and see for yourself. Congratulations Elizabeth.
B000005S6B|5.0|Blasing off with the spirited title track, this is without a doubt The Pogues' most ambitious album. Full of vim, vigour & tight as a dime bouncing off a well made bed. But where their previous releases were filled with gritty, reckless abandon, a sense of self-conscious \\"professionalism\\" starts to creep in here. All of which would be fodder to invite accusations of \\"sell out\\", if the songs weren't so outstanding.<br /><br />\\"Fairytale Of New York\\" is a classic for the ages. It just can't be denied as one of their most moving & effecting songs. MAcGowan & company are at the top of their game throughout. \\"Bottle Of Smoke\\" & \\"Sit Down By The Fire\\" go to show their raucous past had yet to abandon them. In \\"Turkish Song Of The Damned\\", you have another in a long line of Shane classics.<br /><br />In terms of ballads, \\"Lullaby Of London\\" ranks up there with \\"Fairy Tale\\" as one of MacGowan's finest. \\"Broad Majestic Shannon\\" more than lives up to its title, hitting home like \\"a rusty tin can & old hurley ball\\".<br /><br />As far as the bonus tracks, I suppose an arguement could be made for  over staying one's welcome, but if you're a Pogues fan, what's to complain about?<br /><br />After this, it seems The Pogues did indeed manage to fall from grace. What came after was the artistic brawl known as Peace & Love, leaving them to shoot eachother down in Hell's Ditch. Though they reunite on occasion, one wonders if this could ever be topped.

0142405809|5.0|This is one of those books that I could read every night and not get sick of.  In fact, over the past three years I HAVE read it every night for weeks at a time and still love the flow of the text.<br /><br />My favorite lines include, \\"And she gazed at the sky, the sea, the land, The waves and the caves and the golden sand.  She gazed and gazed, amazed by it all, And she said to the whale, 'I feel so small.'\\"  The word \\"small\\" is in a smaller font than the rest of the text and is so appropriate for the two page spread that includes the tiny snail (barely visible) amidst a scene of snowy mountains, forests, bears, bald eagles, the sea.<br /><br />Perfect for teaching the concept that it doesn't matter how big or small you are, you ARE important and CAN be successful.  As the snail sets off on his mission (I won't spoil it), the text reads \\"'I must not fail,' said the tiny snail.\\"  GREAT lesson!<br /><br />Can you tell that we love this book?!?!?
B000RJO578|5.0|A Hilarious movie with the most unlikeliest villians ever. When the best cop on the force is sent to work in the \\"quietest\\" town because he makes other cops look bad, all heck breaks loose. Filled with some of the sickest/funniest death scenes ever put on film, it's a great whodunnit.
0143143492|4.0|I am very glad that I purchased this book, then the audio book because it is so different than anything I've ever heard about spirituality.  I am a Christian, so I had to have an open mind to listen and/or read it because it focuses on life and living in a very different way.  I would recommend it to anyone, even if you find you don't agree with Eckhart Tolle's way of thinking, because it is still enlightening.
B000EWBNMS|5.0|Great drama, crime solving, and family issues wrapped up in one great package. Every actor, actress and child actor is great. Based on the true life medium/psychic Allison Dubois, this tv series grabs you and keeps you interested to the last episode. Allison must learn to keep her family together, help put ghosts to rest, work diligently with the D.A.'s office and keep her sanity 24/7 in one of the best shows on TV. Filled with great bonus material on how the tv series started, interviews with real life Allison Dubois and deleted scenes for many episodes, don't pass this series up.

B000R7HY0K|1.0|The elements were there they just didn't come together very well. Babes, booze, a tough looking guy with a neat scar and some hot cars. There is no way you can miss with this combo, is there?. Things going downhill when the director appears as a bemused bartender which should prepare us for what follows. Several not very talented female leads and a terrible script cannot be saved by the road rage bashing and crashing. Kurt Russell doesn't seem very into his part as a psyco and I think he knows he shouldn't have taken this gig. Tarantino has done some great work as in Pulp Fiction and Kill Bill but he didn't get it together on this one. Give it a pass, thumbs down.
B000R7I3LY|5.0|Like most everyone else, I bought this CD because of \\"Love Song\\"...the catchy pop tune that once you hear it, you can't get it out of your head.  I was pleasantly suprsised at the rest of the CD and listen to it from beginning to end EVERY time I put it in.  It has a sultry, bluesy, feel that is perfect at the end of a long day. My favorite tracks are \\"Vegas\\", \\"Love on the Rocks\\", and \\"Gravity\\".  Give it a listen.  You won't be disappointed!

B00005JKC3|4.0|The FX in this film are far beyond anything in its days and still holds up agianst current films. The story is a love story instead of your classic comic-book theme. Bruce banner fights with his inner anger after a accident at his ground breaking research center and wakes up 110% He soon relizes when he reaches an infuriated level he morphs into a giant pissed-off Hulk. The one thing that can calm him down is his Ex Girlfriend and current love intrest Betty Ross, daughter of General Ross who is bent on stopping the hulk from following his twisted fathers footsteps. The Fight scenes in the film are as Jaw-Dropping as they come with Stunning CGI and amazing Live-Action Capture semlesly put together to create a creature of amazing detail. However if you are a fan of the TV series than wait till the release of its Sequal to quinch your thirst but anyone loving giant things destroying countless amounts of valuables. Highly reccomended to any CGI or Action fan.
B0016HNOXQ|5.0|Unexpectedly, Portishead are back and their album exceeds all expectations. Do not forget that this is a group that defined almost itself the whole era of trip-hop with just their debut album. The follow-up was not up to that quality as was of course not the live album (which had its good sides). This however is very surprising because the band has been away for quite some time and has managed something incredible: to stay ahead of the times. the slow depressingmoody music actually represents a veryinspired continuation of thier previous work while still at the same tiemsounding new. I has actually decided not to buy the record when a friend who had bought it twice asked me if I could buy it off him. As I wrote what a surprise! not a weak track! probably one of the records of the year.
B000YABYLA|5.0|Great movie. It absolutely substantiates the idea that you don't have to give up your life if you get knocked up as a young teenager. A lot of societies, including where I grew up, insist that you need to take up responsibility for your \\"mistakes\\" and bind innocent children to resentful parents. The movie is very well written and the actors are great and funny. I'd recommend this to anyone.

B0015XASFS|5.0|It's all about the fans.  This DVD is just stunning, can't say enough about it.  This is a guy that is just simply having a \\"love affair\\" with his fans right now...it was amazing to watch this DVD.  If you look closely at the cover, inserts, and just about all he does and says, you can tell they are trying to capture the fans and the moments. At the end of the concert he seemed a little sad, that is what makes his performance of \\"Awake\\" just sweeter than sweet..... like he is already feeling empty till he hits the road again...whenever that may be. I came away feeling like he is constantly reaching out, (literally and figuratively) building that bond and awareness...desparately trying to NOT have everything be about HIM.....we shall see.  He is becoming quite an unique piece of work! ENJOY!!
1591841992|5.0|Most business books fall into a few broad categories, and though this one might be lumped in the category of how to do presentations, it is really much cooler than that.  I guess I find it so cool because I can't really draw a straight line with a ruler.  My kids are pretty good artists, but that comes from my wife's side.  I am a musician.  This book shows you how to use simple drawings and sketches to communicate much more effectively.<br /><br />If you are like me, when you have to draw an org chart or some other image associated with business, you will follow the traditional, easy to follow model closest at hand.  Dan Roam says no.  He wants you to think about what it is you are really trying to say and let your mind communicate that with a fresh image that shows what it is you want to say simply and clearly.<br /><br />He divides the book into four parts.  In Part 1 he introduces the basic ideas of thinking in terms of compelling images, which problems are best handled with pictures and how to use images.  Roam also uses four steps to teach you visual thinking: Look, See, Imagine, and Show.<br /><br />Part II teaches you how to think visually and implement the rules.  Part II takes you through a series of standard business issues and questions and then shows you how to tell your story in a more compelling way with images.  Remember, these images are simple drawings rather than great works of art or anything that requires high powered graphics software.<br /><br />Part IV draws conclusions for you.  I love the chapter entitled, \\"Everything I Know About Business I Learned in Show-And-Tell.\\"  How compelling you find it, I don't know, but he sure makes a good point.  Remember, this isn't impressionism or impulse drawings.  You must think clearly about what you are trying to say and wrestle awhile to find the right image or images to tell that story.  But you must find simple and clear images to show your audience so they can absorb it quickly no matter how long it took you to come up with it.<br /><br />Great book with lots of good drawings to spark your imagination and very well done text.<br /><br />A fresh and interesting book.<br /><br />Reviewed by Craig Matteson, Ann Arbor, MIit.

B0013FNC38|3.0|Well, let me begin by saying that I - like most Mraz fans - think that this guy is absolutely amazing.  To see him live will truly change your life and musical outlook, having seen him 3 times and pining for the next time that he comes back out to Australia.    Having seen the songs of \\"We Sing...\\" played live approx 2 months ago, I was more than looking forward to this release - I was DESPERATE for it!     Now that it is out... I feel that it suffers from production.  There is too much horn, too much everything.  I struggle to hear the quality in the produced versions that I heard in the acoustic originals from the individual ep's.  \\"I'm Yours\\" & \\"Live High\\" are perfect examples of this.    There is no doubt that the amazing talent that is Mr A-Z deserves to be heard by a wider audience and will be given that quality of this disc.  My problem is that it just doesn't capture the same quality that he manages to bring to his acoustic performances.     If you are new to his world, do yourself a favour and check out his back-catologue, especially the acoustic sets.... You will not be dissapointed!    Happy Listening!    ******** EDIT (August 11) *********  Although I still maintain that this album doesn't have the same emotional pull due to it's over-production, this has grown on me considerably.  Songs such as A Beautiful Mess and Details in the Fabric raise the hairs on the back of my neck due to their haunting feel, If It Kills Me & Make It Mine just make me smile....   After seeing them performed live, you really begin to appreciate the 'bigger' sound that he has gone for.    Saying that....     If this is the direction that Jason is heading in, while it is by no means terrible, I am truly thankful that I have been able to see him live and acoustic, playing original versions of songs like You and I Both, 0% Interest, Rand McNally, etc....     In 3 years time, this guy is going to be massive!  Get on board people!

1400095204|5.0|A great fictional retelling of the agonies of Biafra in the late 60's.<br />Great cast of characters, excellent prose
0790729725|5.0|This is definately one to add to the collection. Its a classic that ranks up with the Godfather Trilogy
B0000028W9|5.0|The song \\"Anthem\\" on this disk is incredibly powerful, deep, beautiful.  Goose bumps.  The rest of the album is pretty good, but Anthem is the song I want played at my funeral.  Its that good.
0307383415|5.0|I loved this audio version of \\"Dreams from My Father: A Story of Race and Inheritance\\"- so well written, poetic and he did an excellent job reading it!  I think the word that comes to mind regarding Barack Obama, author and now presidential candidate, is that he is 'very reflective'. I find this trait particularly appealing.  I can understand why he is seeking the story and ancestry from his father, since his father is the one that left him.  We tend to question the mysteries and secrets in our lives.  This childhood obstacle  obviously made him stronger and he did a lovely job describing the people that were still there for him - his mother and his grandparents.  I hated to have this book end.  It touched me in many ways- surprised, amused and sad..  It is most insightful appreciating  what it is like to be an African American.  The book does a wonderful job, in my opinion, on giving an influential  perspective to anyone who searches or is  searching for answers when given up by a parent or parents and yearns to have a better understanding of  their heritage. ...definitely would recommend this book
B00008DDRX|5.0|So many have already praised this movie and rightfully so. It is a remarkable film. Dedicated to the reality of racing, stripped of vehicles like standard plot lines, or contrived love affairs, this is a movie just about racing. It is a cinematographic masterpiece.     Rather than continue to gush praise for this film, I'll try to add a little background that may help other appreciate the lesser known aspects of the movie. This film attempts to capture reality in a pure unadulterated way. While a few sections and crashes were staged. The majority of the film was shot during the 1970 Le Mans 24hrs itself. The movie features the actual cars running the race itself.    The camera car used to film the 1970 Le Mans 24hrs was a Porsche 908 ( a beautiful race vehicle if ever there was one). It ran the race as an unofficial entry, and it was loaded with heavy cameras. Driven by Porsche's Herbert Linge and Jonathan Williams, it travelled 282 laps (3,798 km) and finished the race on 9th position. That's pretty great for a camera car! It would have done better, but it did not cover the required minimum distance due to long stops to change film reels. Your average race car at Le Mans tries to minimize pit stops. The camera car was burdened by cameras, controls, and mounts, AND it had to stop for lengthy changes of film. 9th place. A Porsche 908 running with Porsche 917s and Ferrari 512s. I give those drivers and that car some real credit.  The footage shot by the camera car is remarkable. The sequences during the early dawn hours that capture a Ferrari 512 passing the camera car are chillingly beautiful.      The stand-in cars used for the crash sequences were real race cars, Lola T70's,  modified to look like Porsche 917s and Ferrari 512s.  The Lolas were used because they were less expensive to wreck than would have been  the cost of sacrificing a real 917.     If you have an appreciation of racing and history's most beautiful race cars, this movie will not disappoint you. True to the famous quote from the film - racing is life, everything before and after is just waiting. This film is like that - there is the race, and then the scenes in between - which really are about waiting. They may seem slow to american audiences, but this is not really an american film. It is much more a european film, and it possesses a unique pace that is not for everyone, and is not even understood by everyone, but is valid and artistically correct for the existential meditation that this movie truly is.
B000XCZGVI|4.0|I was a bit trashed when I first saw this in theaters and while I liked the film, I really wasn't in the frame of mind to enjoy a nearly three hour procedural focusing on the search for the Zodiac, San Fran's most notorious serial killer. After rewatching the film at home (while sober this time), I came to realize that this film is actually pretty damn good. It drags a bit at times but the acting delivered by Jake Gyllenhall, Mark Ruffalo and Robert Downey Jr. makes this film completely engrossing. David Fincher's obsessive attention to detail also adds another layer to this film and gives the film that spark that it needs in convincing the viewer that what they're watching is really taking place in the late 60's/early 70's. A must-see, especially for fans of 70's cinema!<br /><br />PICTURE: Fantastic! HD quality, David Fincher behind the lens (so of course you know this film is going to at least look great), top notch transfer! Extras in HD as well!<br /><br />AUDIO: Great mix but not too active in all honesty. I mean, it sounds as good as it's going to, just don't expect bullets flying from all speakers 'cause this just isn't that kind of movie.<br /><br />EXTRAS: Really interesting behind the scenes featurettes, especially on the Zodiac killer. There are also some great pieces on the special effects techniques used in the film. You may be surprised to discover just how much SFX there are in this movie and how the San Francisco of the era was recreated using these tools. Extras are also in HD as mentioned before. Several hours worth of goodies in total here, including insightful commentary.<br /><br />Recommended! (Even though.... R.I.P. HD-DVD)
B0013J30XG|2.0|The colors are breathtaking and Christina Ricci has the look (those eyes) for this kind of movie, but the weak dialogue and long running time ruin what could have been highly enjoyable. John Goodman is the only real standout other than Ricci and he does the most with his role. That can't be said about Speed Racer's little brother who is one of the most annoying child actors in years. Everything he did seemed to be aimed at the very young and it took my older mind out of the movie everytime. I was going to wait and catch Speed Racer on DVD due to the vast majority of bad reviews. It's a sad day when I have to admit the critics were right.
0446402389|4.0|\\"Child 44\\" is a darkly menacing detective story with a compelling sense of place.  It is set in the Soviet Union during the 1950s and it transports you into that grim, oppressive Stalinist era.  Leo Demidov is a decorated war hero who is now a state security officer in the MGB (the precusor to the KGB) and a strong supporter of communism.  He stumbles across evidence of a serial child murderer, but because the Soviet Union is officially \\"crime free\\", the State wants to silence him rather than to help him uncover the perpetrator.  Leo is demoted and his wife and family come under threat, but his obsession with the murders keeps him investigating.<br /><br />This is a top notch thriller that twists and turns and keeps you hooked late into the night.  The characters are finely portrayed and Demidov makes for a compelling lead character.  It's not a straightforward crime novel - the relationship between him and his wife is a large part of the story.  The only thing that I really didn't like about this book is the nature of the crimes (child murders), which are graphically described and make grim reading.  As other reviewers have commented, the ending seems a little out of place with the rest of the book, but I didn't have any major problem with it.<br /><br />This is a very dark novel - depressing crimes in a depressing place - which was hard to read at times, and for that reason I give it 4 stars rather than 5.  However it is very well written and I do recommend it.
B000KKPN5C|4.0|Small and still powerful.Saves camara's battery power and with rechargeable batteries i can take more photos
B0018QCXGY|1.0|I do not know how this film got on DVD! No less a blu-ray disc! The camereras probably had no stabulization controls which gave me a terrible headache because all the seens did was shake and shake some more. If this is creativity, then we are in very big trouble. Can you imagine if \\"War of The Worlds\\" was made in this meduim? I think that the commentator and director Orson Wells would not only be shaking in his grave but he would come out of it in order to stop production! Knowing what Mr. Wells was like he would have lit one of his cigas and watched it burn!
006088732X|5.0|this book is amazing. my friends were going insane about this book and they only read the summery on the inside. so i went to the library and got it. i hate reading. i never liked it and i was like ugh im not gonna like this book. so i started reading this book in the car and i got car sick and thought the book was bad. so i put it down and returned it. and then i got it again for some reason, and i acutally read it. i was so addicted to it. i finished it in 2 days! thats amazing. it takes me like a month to finish a book but it only took me 2 days. i was like ah. then i ran out and got the next 2 books. i got them from amazon. and this book is amazing. it has a bit of a scare but is so juicy. i cant wait for the next book to come out, Unbelievable . and im soo siked. i really want my parents to get me that book. hahah my friends are so gonna make fun of me.        best book, not gonna lie<3
B0013BNY2Q|5.0|I love this CD  The lyrics are unique, the meanings clear. What else would you expect from Micheal? Yes, they have done it again!
B0011KQSZ4|4.0|My family elsewhere and drawn a brilliant British cast, I took myself to the cineplex one hot afternoon last summer to see Death at a Funeral.  I'm a bit of a fuddy-duddy when it comes to the 'frat boys' bathroom humor that pervades so many comedies (and this one does have one scene I could have done without) but I found myself laughing out loud throughout the movie, as was everyone else in the theater. I'm a big fan of Matthew Macfadyen and his real-life wife, gorgeous Keeley Hawes, both of whom played against type as the dull and diffident hero and his dowdy wife. This film is perfectly cast--a true ensemble piece--but American actor Alan Tudyk (with perfect Brit accent) steals the show. Still smiling at the memory of the outrageous but hilarious plot and many of the beautifully played scenes, I purchased the DVD so friends who missed it in the theater can see it.
B0014CQNTK|5.0|This is one of the best movies I've seen in awhile. Although it is a tough story, of a 16 year old getting pregnant, this movie will make you laugh throughout. The dialog the characters use is so great and bizarre at the same time.  It definitely deserved the Oscar for best screenplay. This is a movie I can watch over and over. Ellen Page is a new comer to watch out for she was amazing. Michael Cera does a great job again of making us all feel a little uncomfortable with his awkwardness. I absolutely loved this movie!!!  And I recommend it because it is a movie everyone can enjoy.
B0001HAISG|1.0|It was lame. It was stupid. Jeremy Sumpter was terrible. The child nudity was unnecessary. The only time I enjoyed myself was when Jason Isaacs was on screen. He was the best thing about the movie. And there were plenty of awesome one liners that were ruined by the next of dialogue like, \\"That was no thimble.\\" Terrible movie all around. That's all I can say.
0385338724|5.0|I loved it.  I absolutely loved it.  It kind of reminded me a bit of The Nanny Diaries, but SOOOO much better!  Sophie is a fantastic writer, and she has a way to make me laugh out loud!  I recommend this book!!
0743496736|5.0|[[ASIN:0743496736 Nineteen Minutes]]    Wow...There is only one true way to describe this book, EXCEPTIONAL!  Jodi Picoult's writing style and technique are unmatched and unbeatable!  What I love about Jodi's books is that she isn't afraid to tackle subjects that are real.  She doesn't just tell a story from one side, she tells a story from ALL sides.  This makes her books thought provoking, emotionally stirring and it makes it impossible for the reader to read her books without doing some serious soul searching.    In \\"Nineteen Minutes\\", the subject is frightening and horror filled. This book points out that, not only does it take a community to raise a child, it takes a community to raise a \\"monster\\".  Who is truly to blame when a child, who has been pushed to the wall by bullies from the moment he steps on the school bus that first day of kindergarten and NO ONE steps up to defend him, finally reaches the point of breaking or striking back?  When the parents turn a blind eye and say \\"You just have to turn the other cheek\\" and the school says \\"If you hit back, you get in trouble\\", what are we truly teaching our children?    When the bullies get away with the bullying because they're on the school team that is going to the championships, and Heaven forbid if they aren't allowed to play, what does this teach them?  It teaches them that they are untouchable.  It teaches them that it's okay to pick on and bully the child who is \\"different\\".  It teaches them HATE!    Jodi Picoult points out in this book that when the community, the parents and the school turn a blind eye to the bullying, EVERYONE loses.  Because you can only push a person so far.  And when that person is up against the wall and finally reached the point of no return, they either break, or they strike out at everyone who has ever hurt them before.  So, who is truly to blame here?  I think that finger can be pointed at everyone.
B00127RAJY|4.0|I love this DVD, I just finished my 20th workout with the DVD, 22 days since I started, skipped two days due to calf tightness issues (discussed below).  My endurance and strength have gone way up as a result of this program.  And I am down an average of 5 lbs. since I started (currently 185lbs., 6 ft., male).    Jillian's energy is great and the program is challenging and she challenges you to \\"fight for it\\" as you are going through the exercises.    It is \\"20 minutes of intensity\\" which is true.  Before that is a little warm up.  And after that is a little stretching.  About 27 minutes in all.    The first day I bailed out after five minutes of the 20 minutes of intensity @ Level 1 (the beginning Level); I just didn't have any more in me.  But each day I tried to do more and more.  And I fought for it.  My goal is to be able to do the complete unmodified Level 1 by day 30.  I am there except for a few pushups and a few static lunges with bicep curls.    My strategy is to do what I can and if I can't, rest and continue as soon as I can.  Maybe 5 seconds later, maybe more.  And then get back to it.    Calf issues:  My calves got very tight as a result of doing this program.  Level 1 consists of two 30 second sets of jumping jacks (during the warm up), then three more 30 second sets of jumping jacks, plus three 30 second sets of imaginary jump roping, plus three sets of running in place butt kicks.  That is five and a half minutes of pounding on the calves, which is okay if your calves don't tighten up too much.  But mine did.  I feared pulling a muscle they got so tight, so I took two days off.  I did some research and found out how to give myself a calf massage and also worked on stretching my calves.  That did the trick and the tightness is pretty much gone and certainly not an issue any more.  Another idea about the calf issue is that without enough water in the body this is more likely to happen.    Recommendations for when you get it:    1. If you are someone who needs to know how much work is ahead of them when you are doing this program, count the number of repetitions for the exercises that you will have to do to match what the models are doing and you will be able to mentally prepare yourself for what is ahead of you if that is an issue.  Since I like to know how close I am to being done with a tough exercise, this helps me a lot.    2. Start this program and stay with it.  If you seem like if you keep doing something you will injure yourself on a particular day, don't do it.  You want to maximize what you accomplish and risking injuring yourself won't help.  But keep coming back and do what you can do every day.  And set goals for accomplishing more.    3. I sometimes chug a swallow from a water bottle in between some of the sets, but very quickly so as not to lose any of the repetitions.  This may be a security blanket for me until I am completely on top of it.  She allows no breaks.     Issues with the DVD/Production:    1. There is continual music with a beat but the beat doesn't seem to match the beat of the exercises.  Which means that if you are to stay at the same pace as the models you have to pay attention to them visually and cannot rely on just hearing the beat of the music to get the pace.    2. When you put the DVD in, it takes at least a couple of minutes before it allows you to start your exercise.  \\"Disc operation not allowed\\" is the message I get when I try to get to the menu to start.  I don't want to kill two minutes.    This is a fabulous program to increase physical and mental toughness and I rate the benefit at 5 stars for sure.  I would pay $100 for this if that was the cheapest I could get it, because it is easily that valuable to me.  But still, there is room for improvement.    Fight for it!
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|My daughter loves this movie, its quite different from the old version but still.. the music in it is amazing! she's currently learning how to play them on the piano and she's made me watch it over and over again! Great Movie!!
B000000OAL|5.0|Looking back at the 1970s, sometimes many forget how big the band Queen was.   Even as Queen moved into the 1980s, while their popularity did slightly decline in the United States, it continued to be very high in Europe.   Their performance at Live Aid is widely considered one of the greatest of all-time and their subsequent \\"Magic\\" tour is considered one of the all-time greatest concert tours.    If it weren't for Freddie Mercury's death in 1992, we might still be talking about Queen being as big a band as the Beatles.   Going back to the beginning, it is always interesting to see how a legendary band got started.   Queen's 1973 self-titled debut - \\"Queen\\", shows all of the signs of greatness.  It shows the individual talent of all of the members.  It also shows how the band embraced a \\"theatrical\\" feel to their music (which was something seen by other bands such as the Kinks) as well as embrace a sound which would evolve into what would become Heavy Metal.  In a lot of ways, these songs have gotten forgotten about because of the incredible music portfolio the band would build up.    Queen is an example of the sum of the parts actually being greater than the whole.  However, if you take each of the four members of Queen, they easily stand on their own as a top musician in their profession.   Freddie Mercury is easily known to be the emotional and flamboyant lead vocalist of Queen who indeed has a legendary voice.   Brian May is the legendary lead guitarist and probably the second most popular member of the band.   Roger Taylor and John Deacon go extremely underrated.   Listen to Taylor's thundering drumming in the studio or live and one can easily understand why he was asked to participate in an All Star Drum Jam (The S.O.S. All-Stars) at the Live Earth concert.   As for John Deacon, he might be one of music's all-time underrated bass players.  Many of his bass lines have proven to be the foundation for Queen's musical sound.   In addition to being top musicians, all four members play integral roles in the songwriting.  The greatness of each of these members is clearly demonstrated on every track.    Here is a track by track synopsis of the collection:    \\"Keep Yourself Alive\\": When you listen to the first track on the first album by a band and it blows you away, it tells you a lot.  This is clearly the case with me.   All four members shine on this anthemic track, but obviously May (who wrote this track and has some great guitar riffs) and Taylor (who has an incredible drum solo).  Great foundation bass work by Deacon as well.    \\"Doing All Right\\": This is another stellar track.  The one thing overlooked is some of the country-western sounding guitar work that is sprinkled throughout this track.  I also like the way the track \\"switches gears\\" - first from the piano, then to an acoustic guitar, then to a heavy guitar jam, then back to the piano, then back to the heavy jam, and finally back to the piano.   Surprisingly, it's May who plays the piano on this track.       \\"Great King Rat\\": \\"Doing All Right\\" has a nice segue into this song.  This song is the first of the theatrical sounding songs on this collection.  The theatrical songs have a \\"medieval\\" feel to it.  Once again Taylor and May true rise to the occasion on this song.    \\"My Fairy King\\": The song opens with a Rockabilly sounding piano that has a nice segue into what would be the next theatrical sounding track on this collection - once again with a \\"medieval\\" feel.  This song does a great job with making use of changing tempos.    \\"Liar\\": This song also has a theatrical feel to it, but it also as an anthemic feel much like \\"Keep Yourself Alive\\".   It also makes use of changing tempos.  On this song we really get to hear some of the heavy guitar work - something that would play a great role in the second half of the album.    \\"The Night Comes Down\\":  Although Mercury and May may seem like the standouts on this track, it really is John Deacon's opening bass that sets the tone for this track.  Some of the acoustic guitars almost have a Spanish feel to it.    \\"Modern Times Rock and Roll\\": \\"The Night Comes Down\\" has a nice segue into this song.  This song begins to showcase the heavy metal influences of the band.  This also demonstrates Roger Taylor the vocalist.  Taylor would prove to be an effective vocalist throughout the band's history.  Many don't realize he can hit the high notes.    \\"Son and Daughter\\":  This song brings a theatrical element with a heavy metal element.  In fact to some extent, this track almost has a feel like an Ozzy Osbourne track.   The interesting thing is how the song \\"mellows\\" a bit toward the ending.    \\"Jesus\\":  As the title mentions, this track basically tells the story of Jesus.   This is a great track. Mercury's vocals are incredible on this track.  Once again, this track has a theatrical feel to it.  There is a terrific guitar jam midway through this track as it also \\"switches gears\\".    \\"Seven Seas of Rhye\\":  This is an instrumental that was would evolve into a more full song.  That more full song would turn up on the band's follow-up album.  Even incomplete - this is just a great instrumental.    These would be the original ten tracks on the album.  Re-releases of this album would include alternate versions of \\"Keep Yourself Alive\\" and \\"Liar\\" as well as the bonus track \\"Mad the Swine\\".  However, even without these bonus tracks - this is one outstanding album.  It shows that this band would have all of the signs of greatness.  Plus it might expose you to some Queen music you might not have heard before.   Highly recommended.
B0007Y08IS|2.0|I give this two stars on the basis that there were two really funny bits. The puppet sex segment was a total riot, and Kim Jong's songs (\\"I'm Ronery\\" and \\"Alec Baldwin\\") were first rate satire. But the rest of \\"Team America\\"? Well, it sure wasn't [[ASIN:B000022TSW South Park - Bigger, Longer & Uncut]]. More like the regrettable [[ASIN:0783230338 BASEketball]]. In fact, take all the worst, most juvenile SP misfires, crude them up even more and make sure they repeat a few dozen times, and you get the mess that is \\"Team America.\\"<br /><br />Where's the satire? Where's the bite? Oh wait, making fun of Matt Damon is really cutting, right? Or how about constant gay jokes? Or that Team America, while trying to save the world, just keeps blowing the wrong stuff up? (Actually, the opening sequence in the puppets in Paris is funny...but the rest of the film starts storming downhill pretty fast after). Oooo...Michael Moore with hot dogs in both hands, because he's y'know, fat! Hardy har har! A puppet hero that goes through an extended - and i do mean waaayyyy extended - vomiting sequence! Snicker, giggle!<br /><br />Really, the bulk of \\"Team America\\" is that lame. I think even Cartman would agree.
B0015AARJI|4.0|This is a must for your PS3, however, it is not exactly the same as the PS3 DualShock2.  It does feel heavier than the SIX-AXIS, and the rumble feature does suck up the battery life (not TOOO bad, but still).<br /><br />I like it, specially with GT5 Prologue, couldn't image playing a racing or fighting game without the force feedback function...
B000VXLC3K|4.0|Tapestry is, of course, one of the ten most important singer/songwriter albums ever released, no matter how you cut it.  If you don't own it, you should, and this is a good package to buy.      But if you're one of the umpteen million of us with at least one copy somewhere in your collection, the question is whether the newly-released material on the Tapestry Live bonus CD makes it worth repurchasing.     Even before CD sales began their stunning decline, record labels were eager to sell us beloved albums over and over again, adding snippets of rare, unreleased or live material seemingly every few years in a new iteration.  If the added material were significant in quality and/or amount, it was worth it; more often, not.  Some of Carole's reissues have been well worthwhile (The Ode Collection box set, the rare The City album); others less so (the '95 Tapestry re-release with 2 added tracks).      Long-time Carole King fans know of remarkable and interesting performances that, while preserved, have emerged from her vault only slowly and sporadically.  One of her remarkable '71 duets at Carnegie Hall with James Taylor emerged on the Ode Collection in '93, but the full show didn't see the light of day until '98 - and remains the single finest Carole release to date.  By contrast, none the other brass-laden '73 Fantasy tour tracks have emerged since \\"Believe in Humanity\\" on the Ode Collection in `93.    \\"Tapestry Live\\" opts to use only solo piano versions of the album's songs.  Some of these are excellent, especially \\"Way Over Yonder,\\" and the title track.  And the absence of other musicians preserves the intimate, personal quality of the original album.  It does at times resemble an unblemished, superb songwriter's demo tape.  Carole is in great voice, and characteristic command of her piano.  This alone makes Tapestry Live a worthwhile CD for true fans.    But if I set out to compile Carole's best live Tapestry recordings, most would come from other sources.  It is hard to imagine a better Tapestry-era performance than the previously-released 1971 Carnegie Hall show.  Perhaps one or two other performances from her '71 BBC-TV concert that is occasionally re-aired (\\"Way Over Yonder\\" with Abigail Hanness).  Though Tapestry Live features a fine version of \\"Beautiful,\\" both the violin-laden one from Carnegie Hall '71 and the slow, jazzy version from her '94 live CD are even better.       Another complaint is simply that the disc could have easily included more unreleased material.  Tapestry live clocks in at only 38 minutes.  It uses only performances of the 11 (out of 12) original album songs, recorded in the years following Tapestry's release.  It might have included other solo performances of Tapestry-era songs and concert mainstays (e.g., Song of Long Ago, After All This Time, Child of Mine).  Carole's '76 tour (used here in part) also featured some great performances of Tapestry-like Thoroughbred material like \\"So Many Ways\\" and \\"Only Love is Real,\\" not to mention a great \\"Up on the Roof\\" with Waddy Wachtel on acoustic guitar.   For that matter, the disc might even have allowed Carole to finish the song she is plainly segueing into after the CD abruptly cuts her off at the end of \\"Will You Still Love Me Tomorrow.\\"      The only Tapestry song that Tapestry Live omits is \\"Where You Lead.\\"  Producer Lou Adler explains the omission by noting that Carole did not perform the song live at the time. Carole herself noted (during her wonderful '05-'06 Living Room Tour shows) that she stopped performing the song soon after recording it because she grew uncomfortable with the notion of women following their men around.  She didn't perform it for 30 years, and resumed only after tweaking the lyric in the late 90's to serve as a TV show's theme song.     Fair enough.  But if you had told me that the tone of a Tapestry song bothered its author enough to embargo it for 30 years, I would have guessed a different title.  How about Smackwater Jack?  A lighthearted rocker about a frustrated guy who \\"shot down the congregation,\\" only to be hanged on the spot by local law enforcement (with whom the song seems to take even greater issue than with Jack himself).  I admire Carole a lot, but Smackwater Jack's theme bothers me more than yet another song about someone wishing to follow their true love to the ends of the earth.    The disc's liner notes are sparse, and don't even indicate which performance came from which show and venue.  And the \\"new essay\\" is nice, but considerably less informative than even this review (ahem).      Fan can cite bigger gaps in Carole's catalog than the one that Tapestry Live addresses.  We still await the release of the vaunted (and vaulted) audio and video from Carole's '73 Central Park show before 250,000 people.  And nothing did more to peak interest in Tapestry-era material that Carole's shows last November with James Taylor and the original Tapestry studio band to celebrate the L.A. Troubador club's 50th anniversary, all which were recorded as well.  Hopefully her next archival release will delight fans even more by addressing these omissions.     Happy listening! - Ken
B0010358EE|4.0|This is the sequel to Appleseed, but not an exact sequel.  Graphics are gorgeous.  I bought this because it was dual (DVD/HD-DVD) so when HD died, I still have a viable format.  I would recommend waiting for Blu-Ray, unless you are happy with your upconverter.
0756404746|5.0|From the first sentence of the story, no before that, from just the dedication, I was completely blown away by \\"The Name of the Wind\\".  It is quite possibly the most wonderfully written book I have ever read.  Depending on how the sequels play out, the series has the potential to be my favorite of all time.      The book has every element one could hope for.  And Kvothe is absolutely captivating; clever but foolish, courageous though insecure, and, most importantly, relatable.  The end result is the most adorable, endearing, and amazingly strong character I've had the privilege of getting to know through literature.  Since I originally got hooked on fantasy series thanks to Philip Pullman and Robin Hobb, I have been reading constantly for nearly ten years searching for a quality I was beginning to believe no longer existed.  I undoubtedly found what I was looking for.  Patrick Rothfuss has restored my faith in the fantasy genre and in fiction as a whole.      \\"The Name of the Wind\\" was an unforgetable experience that I never wanted to end.  I'm sad there will only be two more books!  I eagerly await the day that Rothfuss' welcome words will ensorcel me once again and send me hurtling back into Kvothe's life!
0756404746|5.0|The primary character of the story is Kvothe, an epic hero, a powerful fighter and wizard. But Rothfuss, rather than simply relating his tale in the traditional third person omniscient, has instead decided to relate the story as a history (a memoir if you will) of Kvothe himself.    Rothfuss novel is exceptionally written. The prose is never dull, pedantic, or obvious. The story flows naturally from Rothfuss' pen, and its large size seems almost too short by its end. The Name of the Wind is the first book in what appears to be a trilogy, or perhaps a quartet of books, and readers should know that its ending leaves more questions than answers.    I highly recommend this book. I've already mentally added The Name of the Wind to my best reads of the year list, and it will take a truly exceptional work to supersede it. None of this novel really disappoints. It is full of adventure, intrigue, a complex love story, and a powerful magic. Its supervillians are truly evil, and although they appear but rarely in the story, Rothfuss has intertwined so many other plots filled with rivalry and jealousy that Kvothe never lacks for an evil to fight. The book has so many subplots and containers for the narrative that the reader never lacks for an exciting event. And Rothfuss writes so smoothly that your mind glides over the words like a swan through water.
B000ZOXDFA|5.0|Needless to say the performaces, the set designs and script are maginficent...but it was not Walter Raleigh but Sir Francis Drake (who is not even mentioned) who was the main hero in the defeat of the Spanish Armada...However the film is totally enjoyable and the historical shots are awe inspiring....
0452289963|1.0|it's called the Bible.  Tolle's book is New Age mysticism mixed with amateur Buddhism and a dash of Gnosticism.  There is one God, one Savior, and One Way.  People will always be looking for the \\"Next Big Thing\\" (like this book) when the Real Thing has been there all along.<br /><br />Come to an understanding that there is absolute right and wrong.  The wrong is called \\"sin\\".  Know that you sin, and that you therefor are a sinner.  Know that you need forgiveness and that only God is in the position of authority to grant your pardon as He is the arbiter of all and the author of everything.  Know that Jesus, God's only son, was God in human flesh (so that God might be identified with and through His creation) and that Jesus came to teach the way to salvation through himself.  Know that Jesus died to pay for your sins, so that you would not pay for them in Hell (which was created for Satan and his angels, by the way, NOT as a punishment for us-  it is only by refusing God's easy way to salvation that we condemn ourselves *yes, WE do it* to Hell).  Know that by simply accepting Jesus' sacrifice and believing in the power of atonement through the blood he shed on the cross, and His subsequent rising from the dead (which exemplified his victory over sin *The wages of sin is death*) that you also may partake in an eternity in Heaven and meet the Creator of the universe and live in His presence forever.<br /><br />Repent, believe, be Saved.  It's so much easier than buying books and spending years or decades searching aimlessly.<br /><br />As for the scoffers- Whether or not you believe is irrelevant.  Oxygen can not be seen and yet we die without it.  God simply IS.  It's up to you to choose.  Please do so wisely.<br /><br />PS  They wouldn't let me give this book zero stars, otherwise...
B00177Y9ZC|4.0|People seem to want Hayden to fail bc/they're not happy with the recent Star Wars movies, but that's not very fair to this movie. The movie, while not Oscar material, is an entertaining flick. The acting is not bad, despite the complaints of other reviewers.<br /><br />I went to see this one with my girlfriend, and we both enjoyed it. I'm not even a sci-fi nut; I think Blade Runner is boring and pointless. So, I'm not predisposed to like every sci-fi flick that comes out.<br /><br />The movie revolves around a misfit kid with an abusive father and absent mother who learns he can teleport. It seems that his life will become a dream as a result of his abilities, but he soon finds himself hunted by merciless killers who are set out to destroy all jumpers. The conflict with a buddy makes for interesting plot twists, and the love interest is played by a uniquely intriguing actress.<br /><br />I did think that the very ending could have been slightly better, but I would certainly go see the sequel.<br /><br />MUCH BETTER THAN PEOPLE ARE REVIEWING IT!!!
0446402389|5.0|There are plenty of reasons to dislike Tom Rob Smith.  He is a 28 year- old screenwriter who has been reportedly been paid a million plus advance for his first book.  The film rights to this novel have been optioned by superstar director Ridley Scott.  This book has been relentlessly hyped for the past six months, so much so that the Wall Street Journal published a business article about this book's far-flung publicity campaign.<br /><br />Like a lot of readers, I figured that there was no way that Smith's novel could meet the hype.  Turns out I was wrong.  CHILD 44 is a genuinely thrilling novel, one of the best debuts I've ever read.<br /><br />The genius of CHILD 44 is Smith's decision to set in the Soviet Union during the Stalin era.  All the characters are forced to deal with a dysfunctional, paranoid police state that makes George Orwell's 1984 seem like a paradise.  This novel contains a compelling murder mystery, but the setting is what makes this novel a reading experience both memororable and unique.<br /><br />It helps that Smith does everything well.  He is highly skilled at characterization, setting, dialogue, and fast-paced storytelling.  Every single page of this book is interesting.  With the exception of one final plot twist and an overly neat ending, all the events in CHILD 44 unfold in a realistic and believable fashion.  I cared about the figures in this book and found myself swept away by the sheer power of Smith's storytelling.  One of the great things about reading fiction is how you can immerse yourself in a completely different world, and that's what Smith supplies the reader here.<br /><br />So CHILD 44 meets all the hype, and I think this is the best debut novel I've read since John Hart's KING OF LIES.  This novel is a winner, and I hope you give it a try.

B00003CX9Q|5.0|I remember when Steven Speilberg's \\"E.T. The Extra Terrestrial\\" was first released, being touched and awed by such a beautiful and unique film.  Everyone I knew was talking about this film; it struck an emotional cord in young and old alike.  It, along with \\"Close Encounters of the Third Kind\\", was one of the first films with aliens where the aliens were NOT portrayed as invading monsters, and we, the people of Earth, didn't immediately shoot first and ask questions later.  Even in the classic \\"The Day the Earth Stood Still\\", a soldier shoots at Klatu in one of the earliest scenes.<br /><br />This story of a boy named Elliot who develops a deep and lasting friendship with a young space alien accidentally left behind on Earth teaches lessons of friendship, devotion, and love. Elliot and his new friend ET show us the power of wonder, innocence, acceptance, curiosity, and communication.  The scene where Elliot begins to attempt to teach ET to talk via a stream of consciousness naming of everything in sight is wonderful, so typically childlike and real. It always brings a huge smile to my face.<br /><br />I watched ET again last night with my newly 3-year old daughter.  I was amazed.  It immediately captured her attention; she watched it with huge, wide, interested eyes.  As she sat in my lap, she whispered various questions - \\"What's happening, Mommy?\\" or \\"Why are the kids screaming?\\"  I explained that a young ET had been accidentally left on Earth by his mommy and daddy, that Elliot was searching for ET to bring him back to his house, that the little girl and ET were scared of each other at first, etc.  She took it all in, absorbed it, and clearly thought about it.  When Elliot brought food for ET, and when Drew Barrymore started smiling at ET, my daughter exclaimed, \\"Oh look, Mama, now they are friends!\\" with a happy, satisfied smile on her face.  Near the end she said, \\"He misses his mommy.  ET phoned home.\\" Her sweet, insightful, innocent comments once again brought tears to my eyes.<br /><br />This film continues to be pure magic.  \\"E.T.\\" has earned itself a place in movie history, and deserves the highest praise and more.  Introducing it to a young child improves even the best experience, bringing to mind memories of that first time and surpassing them.  It truly is a film for the ages, for all generations, and will be for years to come.es.

B0013FFMOK|4.0|I enjoyed this movie despite a few flaws. Smiths acting was credible, as was the supporting cast. A cure for cancer has been found. Unfortunately, it is in the form of a virus and apparently the virus mutates and rips apart the world as we know it.  Vincent Price and Charleton Heston both dealt with similar problems. I liked Anthony Zerbe's (THE OMEGA MAN) 'crazy' a tad better than the one here in I AM LEGEND, but this is still a decent movie.<br /><br />POSSIBLE SPOILER ALERT: (A gentleman elsewhere was upset when I mentioned someone's death scene in KNOCKAROUND GUYS, and maybe he was right. So from now on I'm trying to give fair warning.)  When the girl and her son decided to meet him at the dock, didn't she have any plans on where she was spending the night with the 'crazies' running loose? And for someone new to the big city, she certainly found her way around town beautifully. What did the female 'crazy' he had strapped down to the table in the lab eat?  When did she eat?  How is it someone so over-the-top insane managed to figure out how to set up a trap for Smith's character?  How did he still manage to have gasoline after three years?  You would think he could have found tons of dry dog food right after the disaster, so why not store it in the basement or something instead of feeding that poor dog...whatever he was feeding her.<br /><br />SPOILER ALERT:  This film is worth watching and buying, for some. With I AM LEGEND, the ending is sad enough that I really have no desire to see it, or the dogs death, again.
B000PY52EU|3.0|Christina Ricci has to be one of my favourite actresses. She's one of the few child stars that has managed to make a name for herself in adult films unlike some unmentionables, and not be known as Wednesday Addams anymore.<br /><br />Black Snake Moan was a very strange film. Some of it didn't make sense, and Rae and Lazarus's relationship can be quite difficult to watch at times. For the guys, Christina appears topless (only her second topless scene since Prozac Nation), and wears very little. Tiny shorts, and a top cut in half was her wardrobe. Oh, and cowboy boots. The scene that sticks out was her walking along the road, and this giant truck behind her, hooting at her to get out the way, and she sticks her middle finger up.<br /><br />Black Snake Moan's reviews/trailers do not do it justice. I watched it expecting something entirely different to what I've read about it. Samuel L Jackson was amazing, and can actually sing and play the guitar (which he learned while filming Snakes On A Plane.) Personally, I don't like his singing voice. The whole blues/jazz stuff really isn't what I would listen to on a day-to-day basis. What I did love was of course the song that is NOT on the soundtrack, and I am now desperate to get my hands on this song. If it is her, Christina has a really nice voice, singing \\"This Little Light Of Mine\\", although the song got stuck in my head and I couldn't get to sleep.<br /><br />The story goes that Rae's boyfriend, Ronnie (played by the shockingly wooden Justin Timberlake) goes off to fight a war and leaves her behind. Sleep with her and leave her. While he goes, she goes off the rail, and sleeps with every man who comes near her. An addiction possibly? She also drinks and then one night takes something she shouldn't and gets beaten up by Ronnie's so called best friend. Lazarus finds her by the side of the road, and decides he needs to take care of her. Which includes chaining her skinny little self with a 40lb chain to the radiator. They shout, they scream, they gradually begin to understand and help the other.<br /><br />The film does get a little waylaid towards the end. I wasn't sure about the ending. I was kinda hoping Ronnie's character wouldn't come back but he did with a (wooden) vengence. The film could have been so much better without him. Still strange, but better.<br /><br />Christina plays the character of Rae brilliantly. After watching it I couldn't imagine any other actress who could have played this role. Yes, she was shockingly too skinny, but it was part of the character. (Although recent photos I've seen of her have made her look like a lollipop head.) The dirty blonde hair, the bags under the eyes, and the clothes just fit the character to a T.<br /><br />While I wouldn't recommend Black Snake Moan to everybody (I think you have to be in the right frame of mind to watch a young girl being chained by an older man, and not think there's something snapped in his brain to make him do that), it is one of those strange movies that you have to pick up if it's not too expensive. It is worthwhile seeing, although it won't leave a lasting impression afterwards. Just that Christina is too skinny, and I NEED that song!gradually begin to understand and help the other.

B000UJ48VI|3.0|Considering how brilliant 2001: A Space Odyssey and Barry Lyndon were, it's kind of hard to imagine Stanley Kubrick making a bad film. Unfortunately, throughout his prolific career, he did make a couple of clunkers, and Lolita is definitely one of them.<br /><br />The comedy was misplaced and unfunny, the creepiness was corny and uncreepy, and the overall mood was as dry as sandpaper. The deepest, and the most artistic, scene in the entire film was the introduction. Aside from that, barely anything was impressive or accessible enough to draw me in. For most of the 2 1/2 hours, I watched each scene lumber by, and barely cared for what I was seeing.<br /><br />Why was Clare Quilty such a front and center character? Was it because Peter Sellers agreed to play the part, and they wanted to see as much of him as possible? Is that why they chose to over-develop his character, give him more lines than anyone, have him play two characters, and stray completely from the poetic chords that made the book so moving? And why was Humbert Humbert's background so under-explained? If you had never read the book, the deeper reasons behind his sickness, and everything else, would be mostly unknown.<br /><br />The story and the character development jump about with hardly any subtly. For example: Humbert, out of the clear blue, begins to rant about his controlling wife, and a few moments later, he contemplates on ways to kill her with a gun. There were no hints about him having murderous tendencies within the story's chronology, but all of a sudden he does?<br /><br />And there is no sexual tension or chemistry between Humbert and Lolita; you can barely tell that they have a relationship at all. Maybe the 1960s censors are to blame for this. Nevertheless, the relationship still feels very shallow, unbelievable, and unjustified. Why would a beautiful young girl want to have sex with a man who was as old and as ugly as Humbert was in this film? This is never explained.<br /><br />As a longtime Kubrick fan, I'm not afraid to say that this film downright sucked. I only give it a 3 out of 5 because it wasn't entirely awful. There were moments when Kubrick's trademark directing and cinematography sparkled through, but, overall, I was extremely disappointed.y that this film downright sucked.

0312983867|4.0|Normally, every book in the series is about equal.  This is the first book that really stands out.<br /><br />Plum is of course as good in this one as normal.  It is nice to see Ranger having a bigger part in this book that earlier ones.  He doesn't just show up to save the day, but works with Stephanie quite a bit.  The addition of Kloughn to the regular cast of characters is welcomed.  He definitely falls on the hapless side of her friends.<br /><br />The bad guys are more entertaining in this book that previous as well.  The guy in the rabbit suit is, well, interesting.  He seems as dangerous as any of the people who have tried to kill her in the past, but more interesting.<br /><br />The story is about what we've come to expect from the series.  Through a series of luck breaks and coincidences, Plum stumbles her way through to success.  Hapless but effective.<br /><br />This book is as funny as any of its' predecessors, and  a little more interesting.  For fans of the series, I would definitely recommend it.

B00154GEFU|3.0|What Phoenix desperately needs is Mike Stone (R.I.P.). I know the lads produced the album themselves, but the ASIA [wall of sound] is largely missing in the mixing of the tracks. Where is the dramatic keyboard work coupled with the lead guitar as in \\"Sole Survivor\\", \\"Cutting it Fine\\", or even \\"Go\\" though that \\"Astra\\" album didn't have Howe on guitar. And except for \\"Extraordinary Life\\" there isn't any energetic choir like chorus in the songs that reminds one of \\"Heat of the Moment\\". The rundown: Good songs; Never Again, Nothing's Forever, Wish I'd Known All Along, Over and Over, Extraordinary Life. Forgetful songs; Alibis, I Will Remember You, Shadow of a Doubt, Orchard of Mines. Heroine has that \\"Smile has left your Eyes\\" feel to it. One other thing, splice the \\"Sleeping Giant\\" intro that sounds like it should be on a Downes 'New Dance Orchestra' album to \\"Parallel Worlds\\". It works much better than the awful \\"No Way Back\\" piece.
B0014KD46W|5.0|Simply brilliant. I am not a fan. Liked Winwood's 1980's music. But totally taken by Nine Lives. All nine songs have their own little stories.

B0016HMYEQ|5.0|After reading some of the griefer reviews which indicate people have a big problem with the hand-held camera work, I realized people must have somehow missed the huge marketing and significant coverage Cloverfield received. If it isn't apparent, this is a mega-monster film from the perspective of regular folks with a video camera. That's part of what makes the movie work because giant monsters tearing up Tokyo and New York have been appearing as  special effects extravaganzas for almost a century.     The other part which makes this film work is the mystery surrounding events taking place that, to the studio and creative teams credit, happen in the film, in an online game, and through easter eggs hidden in the DVD. Instead of just spending two hours as a couch potato, there is an opportunity to watch the movie and then get caught up in all the unresolved issues that will make for a great sequel but also provide a significant amount of fun along the way.     Key points:  + Special effects and compositing don't steal the show, seamlessly integrating well done CGI makes the creatures part of the movie instead of the movie itself.  + Ground-up perspective gives a claustrophobic sense to Manhattan, leaving viewers trapped in a grid while the monster smashes through whatever is in the way.  + The monster comes across as a bear cub discovering a bee hive, almost innocent, which is a difficult task considering how little screen time it is given.  + Every character, whether they are on screen most of the film or just running by, appear equally helpless and in character with the exception of Hud and Rob.     - The two main characters, Hud and Rob are flawed due to the plot requiring they both focus outside the situation (Rob on finding a girl, Hud on filming).   - The protagonist of the film, the monster, took a backseat to the lead characters saccharine sweet quest to save someone.   - It's clear that the studio need for a teen-viewable rating significantly impacted the writing and direction of the film.

B000OHZL1C|5.0|Meet Joe Black is an outstanding movie.  At first it promises to be a spectral thriller, but quickly counters as a dramatic romance.  It is a poignant look at what a life well lived is, and should remind us all to live with no regrets.  Starring Brad Pitt, Anthony Hopkins, and Claire Forlani, Meet Joe Black is a must see movie, even if you don't keep it in your DVD collection.<br /> I do not have the life Bill (Anthony Hopkins) portrays.  However, he lives Everyman's dream.  We all want to be surrounded by those we love.  We crave power.  We desire fortune and comfort and struggle to attain it at every venture.  Hopkins however gives a wisdom to the role of this dream.  Bill is the benefactor we all need, the father most of us wish to be and the oracle for a life well lived.  Bill is confronted by death.<br /> Death is selfish, smooth, and at times very cruel.  Heartless and cold, Death's one desire is to \\"live\\" like Hopkins' character does.  Joe (Brad Pitt) is gallant, charming, and perfectly suited to the role.  When we first meet him, Joe is an ordinary man with extraordinary dreams.  He soon however becomes Death's puppet, and is inhabited by the entity of the dark spectre.  As Death, he disrupts everything he can about the harmony surrounding Bill's life.  He even steals Susan's heart.  Bill cannot stand the thought of his daughter loving Death.<br /> Susan (Claire Forlani) is beautiful, smart, and dreamy.  She aspires to be her father's daughter and shuffles after his number one assistant in a loveless pursuit of marriage.  Bill sees this and warns his daughter to settle for nothing less than \\"floating, dancing a dervish, swept away by desire and passion, with a little time to remember me.\\"  Soon after he render's this advice, lightening strikes and Susan meets Joe.  Joe echoes Bill's words sending Susan into a dizzying head over heels infatuation with him, just before Death takes his body.<br /> In the end, the three primaries create a paradoxical balance which leads to an inevitable ending, which can only be described as magical.  Though I love Anthony Hopkins and Brad Pitt, I will always adore Claire Forlani's performance.  She is at the center of impossible circumstances and inspires every girl to dream of that one love which surprises you.  Hopkins completely compliments her as a devoted father. Just about any young handsome leading man could have played Brad Pitt's role, but it was done well enough by Pitt.  All in all, this movie was remarkable.to an inevitable ending, which can only be described as magical.  Though I love Anthony Hopkins and Brad Pitt, I will always adore Claire Forlani's performance.

B000E33VWW|1.0|Ok, I know this movie has received tons of kudos, but I myself can't really for the life of me see why. I read \\"In Cold Blood\\", and have enjoyed all of Truman Capote's works, but this movie literally put me to sleep. I'm a huge fan of Philip Seymour Hoffman, but egads! I felt a need to get up and slap the TV set from having to listen to his indecipherable verbalizations! I could scarcely understand a word he said, frankly! The whole thing was just a plodding, sluggish, boring, lackluster movie for me. I only stuck it out because I'd paid for the rental!

B000I5Y8ZU|5.0|Their best album.  It is a mixture of like a rock opera, punk, and metal.  All the songs, even if you don't see the music videos you can see the darkness in each song or vision what the music video looks like or should look like.  The began starts you off great and the end is great ending.  The lyrics in each song can speak to a lot of people.  They are all serious and somewhat funny.  The MCR way.  I saw them at the HOB and they were even great live.  All songs but maybe two fit in like a story.  The whole entire album is like a vocal rollercoaster and it is a great one at that.  It flies by fast, it will make a long trip seem short when you listen to this.  You would want to repeat all the songs and get back on The Black Parade float.
B00005K3O4|4.0|When I first saw this film at 13, I really enjoyed it, very cheesy but still enjoyable. The special f/x were simpler than they looked.  I'm 27 now, still like it.  At 13, most of my friends missed the point, not realizing there wasn't one. My friends now, some get it and some don't, I don't expect everyone to like it, but I'm impressed that so many here did. I too found the music video pretty funny but it's not on the DVD, oh well.  I heard the commentary, a sequel is being considered, but to me this film should be left alone, Lost Boys doesn't need one either-but it's getting one! If Joel Schumacher has a hand in it, I'll consider it, otherwise I'm skipping it.  My question is, what else can they do with Killer Klowns, unless they're gonna modernize it, which could work.
B000YAA68C|5.0|I started to watch this movie, not really expecting to like it that much. I was hooked immediately and couldn't stop until it was over. I laughed, I cried, I hoped for a different outcome but all the while, I loved all of it. Hilary Swank was excellent as was Gerard Butler, Lisa Kudrow, Kathy Bates, Harry Connick Jr., and Gina Gershon. I wished Jeffrey Dean Morgan and James Marsters had larger parts but I just loved this movie. I want a love like this that transcends death. The author of the book, who is much too young to know this kind of love, must be an amazing storyteller. She is to be commended.<br /><br />See this film, ladies, for a good cry and a heart full of hope.<br /><br />See this film, gentlemen, to get an idea of what true romance is.
B00139W3NE|3.0|It was a great movie for what there was of it.  As stated it just kind of ...ends... As in \\"There's a sequel you're missing just now\\".    Its always fun to see Nicole Kidman playing a role in period costumes.  She carries off the role of the villainess very well.  All the actors were very well chosen for their parts too.  The effects were good, but a little too dark to see anything sometimes.  Most of the fights in the tundra were that way.  If there wasn't snow on the ground it would have been totally pitch black.    Overall a good movie, that with some tweaking could have been a great movie.
B0012E6R3W|5.0|Testament's back with a bang. This Cd isn't as strong as the first 3 and the gathering, but it's still pretty Impressive considering how long these guys have been around.  I think TFOD is a mixture of all the styles they have done over the years,  I hear some vintage testament sounds from the 80's and also a touch of the gathering.  Even the ritual makes a return On this release, but of course this is all done with a modern feel.  The drumming is great, but I do admit I miss Mr. Lombardo.  His work on the gathering was amazing. All in all, a great release from this underated band.
B0000047CW|5.0|Want to know what the world was like in 1963, in San Francisco, on sunny afternoons, when all the windows were open on a garden from a small apartment high on the Ashbury Street Hill where Anne and Stan Rice lived and wrote? ---  Before the Flower Children came. ----  Then listen to this classic album, the album that defined \\"jazz\\" for me more than bossa nova.  It was an album that made me want to flee the foggy streets of San Francisco, put on khaki clothes and drift south. It took me well over twenty years to get to Brazil, and the tunes were no longer in my head.  Don't know who Stan and Anne are? No surprise. --- They were young writers, dreamers and students. ----  Just wanted to make this review a little reflective of what those moments were like, what this soft sweet, gentle, and sophisticated music brings to mind as I play it on a sunny Sunday in the desert, just wanted to convey the beauty, the pleasure.....and who knows, maybe the innocence?  It's making me want to dance.--- Here's to missing you, Stan.  Here's looking at you, kid.  --- A love is still a love....as time goes by.
B000Y7U98C|5.0|Sunshine is one of those movies where you sit down not really knowing what to expect. Is it going to be like 2001 or Solaris or more like Jason X or Event Horizon? It is a little of all these. The pacing begins with a 2001 feel and then moves into making you think the way Solaris does but adds the tension of films like Jason X and Event Horizon without the confusion and disorganized plots. The over all look of the film is akin to The Fountain.<br /><br />However Sunshine stands on it's own. Directed by Danny Boyle of Trainspoting and 28 Days Later fame, it is a prime example of what Sci-Fi should be, an intense look at humanity, what we can accomplish and questioning if we should do so. In this case our dying sun brings to light the question: If God has chosen us to die should we or do we have the right to defy God's will, if we have the knowledge and ability to save ourselves, is it right to do so?<br /><br />Humanity chooses to survive and sends a mission to reignite the sun. They call it Icarus after the man who had wings and flew into the sun. He died and so did the first mission. Mankind sends a second mission, one last hope. Icarus II reaches the sun... they discover the question and what happened to Icarus I. The intensity is revved up, will they succeed or will mankind freeze to death without the Sun.
0307387178|4.0|It's been a while since I read this book and I haven't yet seen the movie (maybe I'll watch it this weekend?), but the story of Chris McCandless's fatal excursion into the Alaskan wilderness is still vivid in my mind. Perhaps it's because when I was a high school student I also had dreams of going somewhere and \\"living off the land\\" for a while. (My dreams focused on the West - Colorado, Wyoming, Utah...) Perhaps it's because I spent many adolescent evenings arguing with my father about the value of a college degree, living a so-called middle-class life, waiting for retirement to do the things I want.   I'm not sure exactly why, but I found myself both thrilled and terrified by the story of Chris McCandless as told by Jon Krakauer. I could relate to Chris's headstrong sureness and self-confidence at the same time that I could shake my head and think \\"if only he could see that simply throwing everything away is not more reasonable than simply accepting everything.\\"   Jon Krakauer does an excellent job of presenting this story. With a clear narrative style and a reporter's eye for what parts of a story are interesting and how to develop the human element of what's happening, Krakauer almost seems to disappear from the narrative, making it feel as if you are watching the actual events themselves unfold as they happened. There is little editorializing, and a pretty good balance of empathy and skepticism regarding Chris's quest.  I think Krakauer's \\"Into Thin Air\\" is a better story than this one, but this one is also very readable and easily worth your time.   Now, I only hope that the movie lives up to the book.
0375423877|3.0|Take one heaping cup of African history, culture & lifestyle, add in a half a cup of basic wisdom, philosophy & elementary dialog , then mix it up with a scant eight cup of a little bit of mystery, and you have this novel.  I finished it because it was interesting & fairly entertaining., but in no way was it a mystery. Doubt if i'll buy any more of the series.
B000053VAZ|3.0|Benny (Aidan Quinn) is a mechanic who, since the death of their parents, has been the caretaker for his schizophrenic sister Joon (Mary Stewart Masterson), a job that has become increasingly difficult.  They are obliged to take in the quirky Sam (Johnny Depp), and love blossoms between the two soulful oddballs.    For this movie to work, you have to love these relentlessly eccentric characters, and, unfortunately, I couldn't love them enough.  The horrendous pitfalls that go along with mental illness are shown just enough to provide some complications in the narrative, but the filmmakers clearly had their sights set on a happy ending right from the beginning, and they were going to let nothing get in the way.  There are some egregious lapses in logic that are required to make this story go in the direction the filmmakers want.  For example, there is serious debate about whether Joon would be better off living in a group home (where she would have constant supervision) or in her own apartment (where she would be mostly unsupervised, even though there would be a friend living in the same building).  These choices are opposite ends of a spectrum, not roughly equivalent alternatives that a responsible mental health professional would present to a harried caretaker.    There are pleasures to be found here, mostly notably Johnny Depp's extraordinary performance, but you have to be charmed into forgetting the real world first.
B0014Z4OQG|2.0|As everyone has said, the camera shaking makes this film barely tolerable. There were a couple of times I actually thought that if Hud would quit shaking the camera so much, this might not be a bad movie. The special effects are great, and the acting is not too bad, but I wanted some CLOSURE and gave a low rating because I did not get it. Someone please tell me...    What finally happened to the monster?     Where did the monster come from...space???    What happens to the \\"bite victims\\"??    Aside from these main questions I also wondered...    Why are those girls continuing to run in high heels?    How did the Army get to Manhatten so fast, were they pulled from Iraq???    I could go on and on and many of my issues have been addressed in earlier reviews. Let me conclude by warning that if you like movies with well-rounded endings that answer all of your questions, you will be disappointed.
0452289963|1.0|The only reason I read this was because it was on my bookclub reading list. I thought it was a waste of time.
B00005O3VC|5.0|This movie will leave you crying from laughter, from scene one to the very end.  Pay attention especilly to the part where King Arthur explains how he bacame king.  IT is so FUNNY!!!  Great movie for the family, a bit nonsense violence for children, but just a great movie all around.
B000OYC7A8|5.0|When the CD was first released I was curious to hear what else Gilmour might do to make a meaningful contribution to his and Floyd's impressive list of achievements. I loved the CD, some great song writing and some great playing. The DVD takes the enjoyment to a whole new level. The tracks from On An Island compliment and compare very well to the floyd classics. The professionalism and competence of the artists shine through to provide hours of mesmerising entertainment. If you are a floyd fan you will enjoy this DVD. For me it was simply superb and I could not fault anything about it. Five stars!!
0307277887|5.0|I first started watching the series on Showtime and was hooked.  I bought the first season DVD and all the books.  I am going to buy the second season DVD as well.  The show is VERY GOOD!!  It keeps you on the edge of your seat.  The character Dexter is likeable yet scarey. All the characters are very interesting.  I think Showtime did an awesome job in the cast.
B0010WB6IM|5.0|I was in high school when Donovan first appeared on the scene.  I hadn't seen anything new from him for many years until stumbling across \\"Beat Cafe\\" while browsing Amazon about a year ago.  What an unexpected pleasure this CD has been!  I found the set an oasis of originality and sensitivity.  The \\"Beat\\" theme of the CD is effectively and cleverly executed.  There is great dimension throughout the set despite a relatively minimalistic musical presentation.  The cut \\"Two Lovers\\" is not just another love song as it inspires fresh and provocative musical images.   Listening leaves you yearning for more.

B00005JPTK|4.0|Will Smith is very good in this interesting movie. It's not perfect (the second half of the movie is not as good as the the first one), but i appreciate much more the \\"controversial\\" ending than the other one.

B00003CXCT|5.0|I remember these movies as much as I remember Indiana Jones and I feel that these two will always be the greatest works from George Lucas that I grew up with.  I know it sounds hypocritical of me after my review of Indiana Jones but I feel that the new cgi effects Lucas added to these three movies was not all that bad.  I say my main reason is that these were science fiction films and to that affect you wanted to see great star fighter battles and incredible technological effects and to that the new Cgi effects did a spectacular job true to some real hard-core fans that maybe a form of taboo to change some of the film but as a few other reviewers are saying as well the movies are owned by Lucas and it is his right to change it how he sees fit.  I also agree with some reviewers<br />that the new trilogy that came after are not as great but most of the<br />time people can never make a copy or a remake of something that was as good as the first.  I say now if you haven't got this box set yet the price is good at this time so buy it today
B000YIGNKE|5.0|I have seen many Austen book adaptations and the Root-Hinds Persuasion was good.      However, part of what makes a story work is the ability to convey the character's feelings to the audience in a palpable way.  This is missing in the Root-Hinds movie.      In this newest version of Persuasion, you can sense the intensity of longing and attraction immediately between Anne and the Captain.  It chokes the air throughout the movie.  You are completely torn and frustrated as much as they are.  Frankly I found them a far more believable couple than the former.  Additionally, the rest of the movie incorporates lush sets and costuming that take us to a bygone time.    This new adaptation is well done, well acted and worth seeing as a comparison.
B00005JMJG|5.0|I have never seen a movie that brings out so much emotion in me. Ever, Jim Carrey is a totally different person in this movie, and Kate Winslett is amazing. As usual. It's about a man who is erasing his ex girlfriend from his memory. We start out seeing how it ended, but as the movie goes on we get to witness all of Joel's wonderful memories with Clementine. As they go through the memories, they try to prevent her from being erased. This is a fantastic movie that should be in EVERY person's dvd library. If I could give it just one more half star then I totally would.
0380730405|5.0|This is a great classic. It is the love story of a young woman who thinks she doesn't measure up to her husband's first wife, as she didn't come from \\"society.\\"  It takes many interesting turns and keeps the reader's attention.
B000UNYK76|5.0|In a word, this DVD is \\"perfect\\"... the song list is simply awesome and the performances are top notch!  Video quality is superb on HD tv's... you could swear it's from an HD source... even coming from a standard DVD.  Short video sequences of Italy are breathtaking, even romantic.  DVD packaging is definitely what you'd come to expect from PJ.<br /><br />If you were to choose from one of the several PJ DVD's out there, this would be your best choice.  I loved it... probably PJ's best DVD out there... to date.
B000W7JWUA|5.0|I played this game for the first time this past weekend, and I was a little hesitant to start at first because it seemed like there were so many rules and details that would be hard to pick up on.  However, I ended up having SO much fun playing that I just bought it for my family!  There is great interaction between the players, and I loved hearing about each person's strategies at the end of the game.  We played with 4 people, and it ended up lasting like 2.5-3 hours, but we were all first time players, and it was totally worth it!
B000002KIK|4.0|Ok, so this isn't the best sabbath album ever, but it is so incredibly different from all the others that it is fascinating. Some very good songs on there, including 'Dancing Queen', one of my favorite Sabbath songs. If you're curious, you gotta try it. I'd love to know the story though behind the last song of the album which is NOT sung by Ozzy.
B000V6BE6C|4.0|I bought this for my 2nd nephew who'd been wanting it since Christmas (along with his brother). The only reason I did not buy it at Christmas was because I forgot the name and logo of the album. I also hesitated because of the explicit lyric warning but he's almost an adult and I can't worry about that forever. The important thing is that I gave him something he really wanted so I know he'll enjoy it.
B0014Z4OQG|1.0|I know it's become an annoying Hollywood cliché to wait until act three to show the monster, but in this one you see ONE shot of it's face as it's looking down at the guy with the camera and that's about it. Everything else is a quick glimpse.    Was this someone's first film ever?
B000X5SPBI|5.0|Supernatural is what Buffy the vampire slayer should have beem. Normal people thrusted into abnormal situations. I am allready jonezing for more supernatural (have to wait to season 4) and I cannot wait for the 3rd season on DVD!
B00000JAXT|5.0|I cant BELIEVE i never heard of this album before. Then again, why would an american who grew up under the New Wave scene, know about a band that only made two albums, and was barely heard outside of England? WHY? Well, maybe because Brian ENO plays on a large part of the album. Or, maybe because Robert Fripp produced the album. (and I'm SURE he plays a guitar piece on one song, down in the mix. It's his guitar, his sound, his melodies, etc.) ANYWAY, if you like the first three SOFT MACHINE albums, then you know the star of this band, ROBERT WYATT. (He was the drummer.) After this album, Robert Wyatt had an accident, and ended up paralysed from the waist down. THat ended this band, but started his solo career, which is also quite fantastic music. But MATCHING MOLE is an animal all its own. You have some of the psychedelic jazz sounds that are on the THIRD SOFT MACHINE album. You also have some shorter, focused, druggy  folk songs, which became perfected in WYATT's solo work. Most importantly, this is a core album in that late 60s early 70s CANTERBURY SOUND, that included Caravan, Gentle Giant, Gong, Hatfield and Rotters Club, Egg, and Soft Machine. Its PROG/ART ROCK/FUSION JAZZ/mixed with lighthearted British humour. ( Not humor, but \\"HUMOUR\\"...try to dig it, mate.)  So, just ask yourself: DO you LIKE ENO, when he was still in his early phase, during THIRD UNCLE or SOMBRE REPTILES? Do you like Robert Fripp and that KING CRIMSON sound?  (From around the LARKS TONGUE Period.) Its just such an incredible mix of genius UK musicians at the very  top of their game. I admit, that I've not been listening to albums all the way thru recently. Well, after listening to the best cuts off this album, I turned right around, and played the whole CD. So yes, DO buy this if you like that Canterbury sound, or even if you just love PROG ROCK, either from the Genesis/King Crimson/Yes- first wave of that sound, or the new PROG like Porcupine Tree, PHISH, Black Mountain, or even fusion like Medeski Martin and Wood, or the 70s jazz fusion.  I'm very impressed with this album, people.ke Medeski Martin and Wood, or the 70s jazz fusion.  I'm very impressed with this album, people.
0446402389|4.0|This is an impressive first novel.  It's a good portrayal of the Soviet paranoia and the Orwellian \\"Some are created more equal than others\\" Soviet society.  Smith gets a lot of the feel of the time and place exactly right--but he also gets a few things wrong. Leo Demidov of the MGB is a hero of the war--he was part of an elite group that often worked behind enemy lines engaging in assassination and sabotage.  This sounds suitably heroic for western readers.  But as you read the book, as you see the suspicion and paranoia directed toward even those deep inside Russia, people with no Western contacts, you need to know that much greater suspicion and paranoia was directed at those who had been outside direct supervision--the partisans, returned prisoners of war, veterans of the Spanish Civil War, etc.  To say, for example, that the veterans of the Spanish Civil War had been decimated would be absurd: decimation means 10%--here, try perhaps 90% or more sent to the cellars or the death camps.  I would have been much happier if Demidov had served valiantly at Stalingrad, say.  The turnover rate in the MGB, and its predecessors and successors was very high, and turnover was fatal.    Demidov is a dedicated Communist--he accepts totally and without reservation the actions of the State, and he accepts without reservation the need for cruelty: \\"Better to let 10 innocent men suffer than one spy escape\\".  He also knows that under Stalin, to be suspected of anti-Soviet activity (such as telling a joke about Stalin) is in itself a crime.  Demidov has a subordinate, Vasili, who is also an enemy and who seeks (for reasons never made clear) Demidov's downfall.  Early in the novel, Vasili conducts an impromptu field execution of two suspects in custody.  This certainly helps to establish Vasili's villainy.  But executing two suspects in custody who are not trying to flee doesn't feel right at all.  In the MGB this act alone would have earned Vasili a one-way trip to the cellars, since the dead suspects were no longer available for interrogation, and their contacts and fellow spies in their network are lost (\\"You obviously killed these two to protect their spy network!!!\\").    Demidov is exiled to the Urals region, and stumbles across some child murders, similar, in fact, to one he heard of back in Moscow.  As in the real case that this was based on, there is no collaboration/cooperation with other police agencies--everything is localized, undesirables are convenient scapegoats.  The novel notes that the idea of a serial killer is totally alien to the authorities--they cannot imagine someone doing this without a good reason--such as rape or theft.  Up to this point, the novel was doing an excellent job about portraying the paranoia and Soviet mindset.  But now Demidov seems to abandon all the things he's believed in--the need for cruelty, the need to protect the State at all costs.  He now seems to have more of a Western mindset--more of an interest in innocence and justice for the individual.  The transition is rather jarring.  Things develop quickly, and lead to a climax that doesn't feel right, and which seems hurried and contrived.  The new appetite for justice for the individual may be satisfying for western readers--but it seems an unlikely epiphany--rather like the prospect of Pat Robertson, say, converting to Islam.  (update): I ordered Robert Cullens's Killer Department from Amazon about the Chikatilo case.  This non-fiction book provides a fascinating contrast to Child 44 and is well worth reading, either before or after you read Child 44. So--an excellent and compelling first half, followed by a less compelling second half--but the first half alone makes the novel worthwhile.
0385486804|1.0|I don't understand why so many people are celebrating the stupidity of Christopher McCandless. While I understand his goal, to live an untethered life, the idiotic way he went about it is mindboggling and what is even more confusing then that is people are making him out to be some kind of great man. Chris is not a great man or even avid explorer, Chris was just another unprepared, undereducated person whose ignorance lead to his demise.
B0013FXWU6|3.0|I don't need to summarize this movie as other reviewers have already done a good job at it. I was a bit disappointed with the movie because of all the hype I had heard from critics and from peers. I found the story to be not all that compelling and even the characters are not that captivating. The only character with any depth is the main character and his story his pretty simple - he's alone and poor, he's ambitious, he's successful, he's miserable, he goes crazy. Citizen Kane anyone?    All in all, after speaking with friends about this movie, I have found that many people like the message \\"greed + ambition = evil\\" more than the movie itself. However, this message is only part of the movie because it would be just as easy to view the opposite message that all the honest people eventually end up getting the raw end of the deal \\"honesty = foolishness\\"?. Everyone appears to be miserable in this movie with no consistent message as everyone seems to be just as miserable before industrialization than after.    In the end, after the movie was over, I wasn't moved, intrigued, or impressed. My first thoughts were \\"great acting by Daniel Day-Lewis, cool soundtrack, nice landscapes and dark imagery, and interesting vignettes of the zeitgeist of the early 20th century oil craze (hopefully it is somewhat accurate)\\".    In summary, I can find intellectual reasons why this movie is good. However, it didn't stir up any intense feelings nor did it send me on a long thinking binge. Consequently, I can say that this movie is \\"good\\" and \\"worth seeing\\", but I can't say that it is \\"great\\" and a \\"must see\\".

0553296981|1.0|i'm just commenting on the person who claims that anyone who says this diary is fake...Is totally disrespecting all people who suffered in the holocaust bla bla...<br /><br />That's unbelievable, I must say i have to question the authenticity of this \\"diary\\"...Does that make me a nazi, an anti-semite? to most people it would which is totally stupid in my mind.<br /><br />Anyways, the textbook view of a concentration camp...Prisoners were sent from trains to the camp where they'd go through several rooms and then have to shower because there was an outbreak inside the camp...Mainly the men who looked suitable to work were selected to labour until they couldn't keep themselves up while the rest (mainly women and children) were sent to the showers which was actually a large gas chamber...3000 people would be crammed into a room of about 240 square metres and then 30 minutes after the gas was released...SS guards would walk in the chamber while eating and smoking to get the bodies cremated.<br /><br />Now maybe something is wrong here, Wouldn't Anne Frank be in that mass group sent straight to the gas chamber?<br /><br />so maybe this is an authentic piece, but in my eyes it most likely is not.

B0014127BO|1.0|I'm not going to take up an entire page to carry on and on and on about how bad this cd is or rip Bryan to shreds as most of the critics have done, but it really is bad!! :( Give Mr. Adams SOME credit. Look back at all of the great music he has done, and look at the situation from that angle. Maybe this cd is the one that catches the listeners ear from a younger generation, who knows? I will stick to his old stuff. To me, this would be a good cd to add to your collection, just because you have the rest of them. :) Not some of his better work, but still it's better than some of the music  out there today. Thanks for all of your classics though Bryan, they keep your flame burning.
B00127RAJY|5.0|Since July 2007, I've lost 18 lbs., went down from size 14 to size 8 BUT won't go down anymore. I've been stuck in this situation for more than a month now and hoping that Jillian's 30 Day Shred will break the plateau [I truly think it will!]. I eat whatever I want but I watch my portions-sensible eating as I call it!    Well, I've done this 10x now and finally did Level 3 right after finishing Level 2. It's a Sunday so I have time compared to workdays. I exercise daily except Saturday, my recovery day. Normally, I'd alternate Levels 1 & 2 but Level 3 will also be part of the rotation now. At Circuit 2 Level 3, I thought I wouldn't last 'til it's over but as she said, there's no shame on switching to Anita's [beginner's] level instead of \\"phoning it in.\\" Honestly, when there are hi-impact moves and they're doable on my rebounder [yes, I have it next to me] then I don't modify the moves but if it's hi-impact on a plank position, I'd follow Anita's moves. I'm 43 years old and I just want to take care of my knees. Plyometrics on a hard surface aren't for me. Initially, I did this on alternate days thinking I can't do weights everyday. However, I've read it from Q&A in collagevideo that it's OK to do aerotone DAILY as long as I'm not lifting too heavy and it's not for a long period of time. So I just use 3s and I still feel and see the difference. I personally believe that I don't need to heavy up on weights especially on Level 3 because I have my body weight on all those planks---Level 3 has punches and jacks with weights on the cardio portion. It was really hard but I felt so good when I finished....I may increase the weights if I don't feel challenged anymore but that will take awhile....    I'll give an update after I finish doing this 30x. Thanks Jillian....The needle on the scale may not be moving and I'm not down to size 4 yet but I FEEL ENERGIZED AND MUCH STRONGER.....
B0013FDM7E|3.0|I am Legend is an interesting sci-fi conceit - a vaccine to cure cancer goes horrifically wrong - a viral strain leads to the formation of human mutant grotesques who have attacked and eaten all the other humans on earth. Will Smith is the only survivor (this is all conveyed at face value in the first moments of the film, for viewers of truncated IQ, don't worry, you don't have to think too hard to work it out).<br /><br />Will Smith (aka Robert Neville, a scientist with military connections) is the only man left on a post human manhattan - overgrown with weeds, buildings falling into decay and blasted bridges (the Brooklyn Bridge, despite being a suspension bridge, only seems to have lost its middle span). Leaping deer and barking dogs roam around the island by day, more sinister creatures prevail at night (the post human mutants) so Neville has to sleep cradling a gun in his bath in his heavily fortified apartment with only Sam, his faithful German shepherd for company).<br /><br />Neville, despite being the only human around, still manages to pick up electricity and fresh water. (He also works out fanatically to keep his abs sharp, and doesn't let his hair grow long or grow a scruffy beard, despite that fact that there are no women left to justify all that grooming). He goes slightly nuts devoid of human company, talking to his dog, and broadcasting on the airwaves to see if anyone is around.<br /><br />The first moments of the film have some interesting scenes in the lab as Neville experiments on gollumesque GCI creatures to see if he can establish why the cancer cure went wrong, and how he can reverse the strain and keep human life going in the most unpromising of circumstances. Dangers and madness assail Neville each day. He befriends two mannequins in a DVD store, and is disturbed to discover they have moved outside the store one morning. He loses his beloved dog, Sam, after he is bitten by mutant dogs who are released after a snare trap disables Neville and has to put him down. His experiments to cure the mutant grotesques and restore human life constantly founder. He is constantly threatened by the grotesque creatures who have done for everyone else who attack him in all manner of ghoulish CGI ways. Through flashbacks it is revealed that his attempts to airlift his family out of Manhattan in the US exodus from Saigon type scenes failed, and his family have all perished, along with he presumes every other human on earth.<br /><br />Being Hollywood, light comes in (sadly around the same moment as the budget clearly runs out and the director realised the movie needs to wrap up in a swift conclusion having blown a cool $15 million on a Brooklyn Bridge scene).  Neville encounters other people who save him after an attack - a woman and her son who survived the disaster after being on an Brazilian Red Cross ship. Together, they work on an experiment to cure a mutant woman. This time it works, but Neville tragically perishes as the compound is attacked by CGIs). However he justifies his legend status by saving their lives to recreate humanity in the image of a Ronald Reagan wet dream - a beautiful clapboard village in tree dappled Vermont.has to put him down.

B0010VD7EO|4.0|With Dave Fridmann as their producer, it was perhaps inevitable that MGMT's debut album would share a sound with Fridmann's previous efforts for The Flaming Lips. Fortunately for the band, his wall-of-sound approach suits their songs, and he reins himself in from the excesses of his most recent work with Coyne and company.    But the Lips are not the only band with which MGMT merits comparison. Imagine a straight Scissor Sisters, raised on '80s radio pop rather than '70s soft rock and disco, and you'll have a better sense of the combination of fun, silliness, astute observation, and sonic exploration to be found on Oracular Spectacular.    Highlights include \\"Time to Pretend,\\" \\"The Youth,\\" \\"Electric Feel,\\" and \\"Kids,\\" the sum of which add up to a remarkable debut all on their own. The rest of the album is uniformly strong, but these four songs show the kind of promise that makes me think this is an album you'll not only enjoy today, but look back on in a decade and say, \\"That's the first time they tried that thing that they ended up doing so well on X, their big hit on their fourth record.\\"    Definitely worth checking out.
B000053VAZ|5.0|For most of my life I've believed if it's not an old black and white movie, it's not worth watching. But I discovered this movie a couple years ago and it's by far my favorite. For someone that has always felt strange and left out, this movie for some reason means a lot to me. When I met the man of my dreams, I gave him this movie to show him how much he means to me.
1572814136|4.0|The Rider Waite deck is still the easiest deck to read for both the novice and the expert tarot reader. Undoubtably the Crowley Thoth deck is the better in-depth deck available and more spiritual in nature but this deck lends itself for fast 'question' based readings.<br />My only complaint, which is minor, and is the reason for only 4 stars, is the cost of this widely available and popular deck which should now have easily been printed and sold at much lower cost than it is at present.
B0011NVC9I|1.0|This was made for a 15 year old boy into video games. The CGI was shoddy and I don't remember Grendel looking like Angelina Jolie. All in all. I'd rather read the original in old English before having to sit through this again....it'd be better
B0000041Q3|5.0|I bought the recording in the tape form years ago. I could not listen to it any more because of the wear after I played it too many times. Fortunately, technology came to the resue, CD!!!     The tenderness, emotion, range, and capacity, from a delicate note to a full blown key, Luciano Pavarotti's voice is from Heaven. No tenor recordings came close to the quality of singing of this one.     Joan Sutherland is the sweetest Liu that I have ever heard. Better still, the voices of the two, Joan Sutherland and Luciano Pvarotti, were the best combination ever. Add to this, we get Montserrat Caballe as the princess.     What more can one ask for?
B000NDJOO2|5.0|As a history major, I chose to write my senior thesis on the film Flags of Our Fathers. After conducting weeks of research, I found the film to be extremely consistent with the historical sources. However, the way Clint Eastwood has presented the events of Iwo Jima and the The Mighty Seventh Bond Tour go much further than simply visualizing source material. Eastwood presents an interesting perspective on World War II that breaks away from Brokaw's Greatest Genereation and almost completely avoids \\"Spielbergization.\\" Instead, he has created a masterpiece that argues for a new paradigm of World War II. Through the eyes of the three surviving flag raisers in Joe Rosenthal's famous photo atop Mount Suribachi, Eastwood throws the viewer into the psychological torrent of Iwo Jima and its after-effects. While much of World War II has been propagandized as the Good War, Eastwood shows us that, like any war, they are horrific, traumatic, excessively violent, and life-consuming.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I got this video a few days ago since my mom has been raving about it.  After watching the first workout, I thought this looked easy - especially because I am in pretty good space and work out 4 to 6 times a week.  And individually, the exercises aren't hard, but together, they offer a great workout!    I would definitely recommend this video to anyone wanting to improve their health and fitness levels.
B000002KAT|5.0|A friend recommended this to me, knowing I was Irish, a Dylan fan, and contemptuous of contemporary popular music.  So I bought it, half expecting the radio Van Morrison of \\"Brown Eyed Girl\\",  \\"Moondance\\", \\"And It Stoned Me\\", \\"Crazy Love\\", \\"Domino\\", \\"Wild Night\\".      And at first I hated it.      I hated jazz and I hated hippies too. I was much more in tune with Shane McGowan's punk rock sensibilities than Van's bittersweet reveries.  There were moments of the title track I could get  and I thought \\"Sweet Thing\\" was a nice song.  But that was it.  The repititions were driving me crazy.  After the eighth or ninth \\"dry your eye for Madame George\\"  I said, \\"to hell with you, Van\\" and took the CD out of the player.      The CD gathered dust on my shelf for a while.  I don't remember why or when I started listening again.  I just know that I was listening at a dark period in my life.  I was homesick, there was a failed romance that had me heartbroken, there was the death of a friend at a young age by his own hand.   There was too much of the drink and the drink was actually making me feel worse instead of the way it used to make me feel.  In short, I wasn't ready for adulthood but adulthood was at the door, whether I was ready or not.      There's a part in the song \\"Astral Weeks\\"   \\"Could you find me,  would you kiss my eyes  and lay me down  in silence easy  to be born again\\"  that reminded me of the way I'd been with the girl I was still pining over, my first real love.  And that part of the song to this day still gets me near to weeping.  Well, misty eyed at least.  In black and white it doesn't quite get it all, Van's voice, that lovely bass playing, the vibes, the strings, the quiet, gentle guitar.  At the time I thought I was torturing myself with it, listening to it over and over again and when he'd say those words I'd think of lying with her and holding and kissing her and remembering that that was over now.  I thought I was torturing myself with the song, butin a way I was healing myself as well.  I needed to feel that pain.  I needed somebody to put that into words and music and Van had done that.      I started \\"really listening\\" to the rest of the album as well.  Van's voice of course, and as a guitarist myself I'm always interested in good guitar playing.  But I think it was when I finally began to listen for the bass lines that I really began to appreciate just how beautiful the music on this CD is.  I almost never listen to the bass in bands . The only other bassist I can think of who is that important to a band's sound is John Entwhistle of the Who, and this bass player is the exact opposite of Entwhistle.  Entwhistle sounds like a jet engine roaring past your ear. Richard Davis on the other hand is playing accoustic the entire CD.  But there is just something so delicate, fluid and expressive about his bass lines. Richard Davis is the unsung hero of this album.   People forget him because Van is up there front and center with his voice, guitar and words, but without Richard Davis, \\"Astral Weeks\\" isn't \\"Astral Weeks.\\"    Somewhere along the line I began to \\"get\\" Madame George as well.  I finally figured out that the song was about a lonely old drag queen, who likes to play dominoes, get high, and listen to music with a bunch of young boys, and they're willing to hang out with him as long as he sends them to the shops for cigarettes with a little of his money and lets them listen to his records and get high on whatever the hell it is he drops out the window.  I'm not sure if the cops really are coming through the door for him or if it's just paranoia, but the cops are mentioned. One can imagine what Lou Reed or Nick Cave might have done with the setup.  But Van's song is about a glance.  When the narrator, another school kid,  glances into the eyes of \\"Madame George\\" and suddenly realizes that this is a person, a human being not a monster, not a freak.  And he has to leave and never come back.  In black print on awhite page, it sounds sordid and depressing, I realize, but on the CD you have Van's haunting voice and the music and it's beautiful somehow.  Transcendant somehow.  Transcendant enough to make an avowed hippy-hater use the word transcendant and mean it.  I can't really explain it, you'll have to feel it yourself to understand.     I think what this CD is about is leaving home, and leaving childhood.      And looking back at it ALL --- the beauty, the love, the pain, the joy, the sadness, the ugliness,  the horror.  And loving it all.  And missing it all.  And saying goodbye to it all and not getting trapped there, but still remembering, even though it hurts so much sometimes.    Then again, maybe the CD isn't about any of that at all, but that's what it's about to me.    Highly recommended to those of you out there who \\"ain't nothing but a stranger in this world.\\"    Peace be with you.
B0015D3Z4O|3.0|This a fun little dance-pop album that any female could have released but because it's Madonna, it gets a LOT more attention.    On first listen, most of the songs all sound about the same which is not a good sign but after a couple listens, you'll see some subtle differences.    To me, it hearkened back to the BEDTIME STORIES / EROTICA phase and I liked it but because it's all dance music--versus pop songs--it's really just a fun, play it and forget it CD.    No classic tunes like from her TRUE BLUE or LIKE A PRAYER days, and that's fine.    And yes, one of the song refrains does say, \\"Oh, oh, beep beep!\\" so the whole thing IS a bit of a goof!
0763630640|3.0|This story is a classic that has shown a long and healthy life.

The tale warned the descendants of this ancient family never to venture o the Moor in the dark hours when the powers of evil are exalted and free to attack.<br /><br />Now after recent death of Sir Charles Baskervilles the Doctor is really worried because there is only one Baskervilles left and that is Sir Henry.<br />The Doctor is worried for Sir Henry he wouldn't like him to meet the same death and Sherlock Holmes and his faithful friend Watson are faced with their most terrifying case of masterful detection and bone chilling suspense. This is a book anybody could read.
B000O178BY|2.0|This is a phenomenal occurrence... where the viral advertising is actually better than the actual product.<br /><br />The viral advertising for this set up the stage for a phenomenally well-thought out post-apocalyptic futuristic 1984-ish scenario, where the past is a mystery and always being re-written, people are constantly being drugged with drugs like \\"Parepin\\", and the appearance of ghostly hand-like figures called The Presence which bring very anti-government messages to people they appear to.  The viral websites included a highly visually complex site acting like a secretive expose' on the truth behind Parepin, another being a hidden forum with people posting about their everyday lives, and even the activity within the forum, like \\"Those pictures (of The Presence) are hoaxed!  Lay off the Parepin, dude\\" and such.<br /><br />The websites are IAmTryingToBelieve.com, BeTheHammer.net, AnotherVersionOfTheTruth.com, and potentially more.<br /><br />But that's just the story... the concept...  the music falls flat on its face compared to the excellent concept.<br /><br />The songs are almost all just electronic noise replacing much of what would've been guitars, bass, drums, and other instruments.  And as with some of the songs in \\"With Teeth\\", they really have little substance to them other than a mildly catchy beat.  Some of the only standouts have been \\"The Good Soldier\\" and \\"Capital G\\".  The rest are much the same, lacking a lot in both substance and beautiful instrumentation that I so loved about Nine Inch Nails from \\"The Fragile\\" and \\"The Downward Spiral\\" etcetera.<br /><br />Over a year after first buying the album, I almost never listen to it anymore, save for a few of the songs, especially The Good Soldier and Capital G.

0312379293|3.0|Jeffrey Archer has been a favorite author.  He has written great books, but his recent books have disappointed me.  \\"A Prisoner of Birth\\" was lukewarm, and it took me a while to finish it, whereas in the past, I could not put them down...
B00005JPNZ|5.0|Like one of the recent \\"Star Wars\\" films, \\"Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull\\" features fantastic sets, good actors (Karen Allen is terrific), imaginative chases and a convoluted, confusing mess of a plot. I'm rating it five stars because there is a five star film in here, one that's engaging, exciting and funny. I'm glad I saw it. However, to experience it you have to also sit through a 50s-style space-alien plot that is every bit as bad as that phrase sounds.<br /><br />Apparently, this is what happens when men get too powerful. No one says, \\"George, you need an editor!\\"<br /><br />At least Jar Jar doesn't show up.<br /><br />But on to the fun stuff. Indy and long-lost love Marion Ravenwood are old, just like they should be. Karen Allen steals every scene she's in, nailing her Marion character perfectly with that radiant smile and spunky attitude. Watching her in this is like seeing an old friend at a high school reunion. Shia LaBeouf plays Mutt Williams, Indy's young rebellious sidekick. Cate Blanchett channels Natasha from [[ASIN:B00009PJT0 Rocky & Bullwinkle]] as she camps it up as a Soviet villain. John Williams' music is right on key. With many scenes in a Peruvian jungle, Indy deals with quicksand, amphibious vehicles, Ugha warriors, giant ants and -- you knew it would be here -- one giant snake.<br /><br />Basically a sequel to [[ASIN:B0014Z4OMU Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark (Special Edition)]] the film is filled with allusions to that classic. In fact, one sequence is a frame-for-frame homage. To best enjoy Crystal Skull, watch Raiders at home before you go. That's what I did, and it really paid off.<br /><br />Those last two paragraphs make it sound like a great movie, don't they? And it is -- as long as you run out for more popcorn whenever one of the characters start to drone on about the dense-as-dirt plot. Set in 1957, the storyline pits Indy against the Soviets in a race to find an ancient crystal cranium that might be from a space alien. You won't care.<br /><br />Parents should know there are a couple of profanities.Parents should know there are a couple of profanities.
0786838655|5.0|\\"The Lightning Thief\\" was a great book.  I got so absorbed in it, that I found myself awake in the middle of the night reading it.  The story involves Percy Jackson (main character/Son of Poseidon), and his two best friends, Grover, the satyr, and Annabeth, Daughter of Athena.  The three of them are sent on a quest to go retrieve Zeus's \\"Master Bolt\\", by the Summer Solstice. If they don't return it by then, Zeus will go to war with Poseidon, which would be really, REALLY bad.
B000NVI1IO|5.0|No way to explain...is just AC/DC!When you heard this album for the first time, you already realize that is ,no dout:they never changed and never will!Enjoy!
0446402389|4.0|This is truly a great book. I had pretty much given up on fiction years ago since it all started to sound the same to me, but I still enjoy a good thriller once in a while. I had seen the very positive advance press on this book, so I picked up a copy. I was not disappointed. I blasted through the second half of the book in a day. It sounds hackneyed, but I could not put it down. Great story, engaging charecters, and the choice of time and locale are ingenious. I hope to meet all these charecters in another book someday. My only complaint, and what keeps me from giving five stars, is the use of italics instead of quotation marks for dialogue. It was distracting, especially for long passages. I can't believe any editor let that fly. But, if you can get through that, you will be very pleased with this book, plus tired, as I am today, from staying up late to finish it.
B000XTLUW0|5.0|Ok...I have to admit that I discovered Muse by playing Guitar Hero III, and I feel a little ashamed that I didn't discover this band a long time ago. Muse is amazing. I'm always comparing this band to other bands that I like and I try to find similarities and I always hear new stuff that amazes me. So I came to the conclusion that if you are a fan of Queen, Radiohead and Pink Floyd then Muse is for you!<br /><br />Now, this live album just shows me how powerful this band is live and how similar they sound to the actual CD. The recording is great except for the crowd noise. You can hear too much yelling from the girls in the crowd. But the DVD...oh the DVD. It's all you can ask for. Everything is great, the sound, the look, the camera shots, the editing...oh man I could go on.<br /><br />Anyway, Muse is great, period.
B000E6EH1S|5.0|\\"Symphonie Fantasique\\" can be a truly haunting,engaging experience or it can be rambling and tedious. It takes the listener to so many emotional peaks and valleys only a skilled, sympathetic conductor with a multifaceted orchestra can succeed.<br /><br />Colin Davis is the master to be sure. This performance is lush and beautiful, moody and magnficient. Despite being from the analog era, the overall sound quality is magnficent. The recording provides a transparent window to a wonderful orchestral experience.<br /><br />This album, Colin Davis conducting this Berlioz classic,  is one of those dozen classical CD's I'd never want to be caught without.<br /><br />Listeners unfamiliar with this work, try this CD. It's moderately priced, a good value, and a great disc you'll enjoy for the ages.<br /><br />Those who love the symphony, compare this to your preferred version. You'll probably love this one.<br /><br />For those who once loved this work on vinyl but had doubts how it would survive the digital conversion process, chin up! This performance will KO all those DDD alternatives. If you sacrifice a little technology, it will be compensated by performance quality.<br /><br />A MUST HAVE!!!! PERIOD.
B000N3T0DW|4.0|I finally got around to watching this movie after years of procrastinating and choosing something else on a visit to the rental store or when shuffling through previewed movies somewhere. I read the many reviews and clearly am not a student of the films of Almod&oacute;var, his influences and tendencies, Spanish cinema, or even much of Pen&eacute;lope Cruz. I don't know if that disqualifies me to discuss my thoughts on this movie, but I thought it was good and am glad I picked it up.<br />The dvd back cover describes the movie as \\"hilarious\\" and \\"comedic\\" and I am truly clueless as to how anyone could use those adjectives to describe a movie that deals with incest, murder, abuse, and cancer just for openers. Talk about misleading...<br />Still, I enjoyed the movie and found the mysterious and at times disturbing story to keep my interest. The actors did a wonderful job and I was impressed with Cruz who I'd only seen in the horrid Vanilla Sky and in the disappointing Blow. She has to carry the movie and through the conclusion of the movie when all things are explained, I came to understand her brusque demeanor. Additionally, the scenery between Madrid and La Mancha was picaresque and a nice introduction to a country I have longed to visit.<br />The extras on my copy had interviews with Cruz, Almod&oacute;var, and Carmen Maura. I noted one reviewer complained about the subtitles being choppy but my copy was smooth and without interruptions.<br />As with most movie reviews on Amazon, the plot has been explained repeatedly and furthermore there seems no shortage of guys willing to confess their fascination with the female lead. In addition, there is a healthy discussion of the director and his work. Then again, perhaps it is simply a need to vomit up the wealth of knowledge gleaned from a life spent studying movies and trying to out-trivialize one another with their endless fact dropping. I am not sure where some of these reviewers fit.<br />When I read the kind of reviews here, I wonder if this is a movie meant for pedestrian viewers like me. I wonder that my lack of knowledge regarding Almod&oacute;var et al detract from what I should gain from watching this movie. Yet, I enjoyed it and I don't know why others wouldn't as well even without joining the debate about strong female characters, how Sophia Loren fits into the picture, the director's female role model issues, European movies versus those from the states, gay themes, the back story of La Mancha, or any of the myriad other issues reviewers felt were necessary to point out in their opinions.<br />I don't know about all of the women issues or the subtleties of the director and frankly don't care. I don't understand why the delineation has to come and be an issue. Who cares that there is only one man in the movie? Honestly, I didn't think to do a head count of gender as I was watching it. Also, there is some opinion that Almod&oacute;var is trying to lump all men into negative categories (unfaithful, sexually depraved, predatory, et al). I didn't make that stretch. The two men who are a part of the plot are representative of the cyclical nature of abuse rather than a broad categorization of all men. I realized at the end that Cruz' ex-boyfriend was evidence of the cycle of abuse that often happens rather than an indictment of all men. There was a brief moment with Cruz and her daughter towards the end that hinted at a final end to this disastrous cycle as it seemed to indicate that the daughter has made peace with what happened to her and the man who did it. I certainly hope so since the members of this fictional family have certainly been through enough drama and tragedy for one life.<br />Volver is a well made and welcome break from the over abundance of predictable fare and I recommend it to anyone who likes good stories and good acting.e meant for pedestrian viewers like me.

B000001G7C|4.0|5 stars plus for performance!!!!  3 stars for a very average remastering!    Familiar classic material, Tchaikovsky's most well-known ballet suites, one of the world's most recognized conductor, and the Berlin Philharmonic provide lush, beautiful, lively performances of works that are an essential part of a serious classical music collection.    This is a fine recording to represent those much honored lovely ballets. Is this the ultimate performance, maybe not. Simply for the extra realism of a modern digital recording, I might go with [[ASIN:B000001GJ1 Tchaikovsky: Ballet Suites]] For some reason, the Karajan performance is a little pricey for an older performance that should have been part of DG's wonderful \\"Originals\\" series.     The Karajan performance is the one that introduced me to these works on LP 35 years ago. They're just as lovely today, but comparing this side-by-side to Levine I hear a good not great remastering job of a fine analog source compared to a state-of-the-art digital recording. I'd hope perhaps DG will go back to the masters and try again with newer, better technology. This timeless performance deserves the TLC of the best engineering can do with it.
B000HT3P7E|2.0|I bought this show because I love Alyson Hannigan, and because it has such great viewer reviews, presently 5.5 stars on average. I am just confused. This show just did not impress me in any way. I love sitcoms, I have like four shelf-meters of DVDs with just those. But this one not even Alyson could salvage. The actors did what they could, but the stories were run-of-the-mill, the writing uninspired, and it simply was not very funny.     Also the basic setup, where a guy is talking to his future kids about \\"how he met their mom\\", but it quickly becomes clear that we'll probably never find out who their mom is... not a good idea.     I hate to be a wet blanket, but maybe other out there feel like I do, and just didn't say anything because they're as confused as me.

B000WGD180|4.0|It is an old musical, do not apply the standards of contemporary productions to it. I like it very much, it is high energy and great for those learning the language. Garou is outstanding in the role of Quazimodo!, Pelletier is also great. Hélène Segara is not my favorite,I find her annoying for no particular reason. Some of the music is beautiful (Les Temps des Cathédrales; Bohémienne; Danse, mon Esmeralda), and some is a bit repetitive. I'm glad I made the purchase.

0060763280|5.0|My husband and I were given the book as a gift.  We both read it and then took advantage of his free seminar offer.  Hands down the BEST seminar we have ever attended.  We really are changing our \\"money blueprints\\".  I would highly recommend this to anyone who has messed up ideas about money!

1590171993|5.0|William Stoner is the only child of Midwestern farmers struggling to eke out an existence.  One of the local elders mentions that the University of Missouri is offering a college degree in Agriculture and he suggests that the son consider it.  Never having traveled outside of his farming community, William decides to attend college in 1910.  He lives with relatives and pays for his room and board by feeding the animals and slopping pigs in the morning, going to school during the day, back to  back-breaking farm work when he returns from school...and then staying up late at night to do his studies.  He takes a mandatory literature course in his second year of studies which opens his mind and heart to learning, higher education and life's possibilities - and Stoner both finds himself and loses himself in books, literature and eventually teaching.    Stoner's storytelling is crisp and visual:    \\"He buried her (his Mother) beside his husband.  After the services were over and the few mourners had gone, he stood alone in a cold November wind and looked at the two graves, one open to its burden and the other mound covered by a thin fuzz of grass. He turned on the bare, treeless little plot that held others like his mother and father and looked across the flat land in the direction of the farm where he had been born, where his mother and father had spent their years.  He thought of the cost exacted, year after year, by the soil; and it remained as it had been - a little more barren, perhaps, a little more frugal of increase. Nothing had changed.  Their lives had been expended in cheerless labor, their wills broken, their intelligences numbed.  Now they were in the earth to which they had given their lives; and slowly, year by year, the earth would take them.\\"    The death of his parents - a failed marriage  - a mentally unstable wife who takes it out on William and their Daughter Grace - a vindictive Department Head of Literature who makes Stoners' professional life miserable  - - and on and on as captured beautifully by Jefferson in this phrase:     \\"The years of the war blurred together, and Stoner went through them as he might have gone through a driving and nearly unendurable storm, his head down, his jaw locked, his mind fixed upon the next step and the next and the next.\\"    This story of an ordinary man who finds his passion in his professional life and yet is still beset with challenges within that life and in living.    John Williams wrote this novel in 1965 - it still merits the \\"perfect novel\\" acclaim attributed to it by many reviewers.  This novel is deeply moving.
0738702994|4.0|I am enthralled by the quality of the cards and the stories behind the major arcana.  Even those who have been reading cards for some time will find useful information there.  The minor arcana comments are a good starting point for those just getting into Tarot.
B00004XQP4|2.0|I was going back and filling in the blanks of my music collection.  I heard Minority on the radio and thought this album might not be too bad.  I was mistaken.  Only the last 3 tracks sound like Green Day songs.  Overall, the lyrics are OK, but the songs sound too poppy.  \\"Warning/ Live without warning\\" isn't very creative for a chorus.  Saxophone rock-out solo?  This is Green Day, right? (see Jackass)  Just get the Minority single and leave the rest of the album for someone else's library.
B000VUFJ4Q|5.0|I first fell in love with Taylor Swift, when I heard \\"Our Song,\\" which was when it premiered on her Official Site,[...].  For Christmas, I was happy to get TAYLOR SWIFT: DELUXE EDITION, and I have never bought a Country album before, even though I liked the music.  But, once I put this album in, I listened to all the song...and to be completely honest, I loved nearly every song, except \\"I'm Only Me When I'm With You.\\"  But as far as Taylor, the Album, the music, goes...I give it 5 STARS!!!!
B000E1MTYU|5.0|Being a big fan of the second film, I must say that I was surprised to find that I enjoyed this film even more. Sure, there are people that complain that the story is not as good as the first two movies. But if you like non stop action and big special effects, you won't be disappointed. Definitely no boring moments.
B00000ICN5|5.0|I remember reading about this smoking guitar player out of Austin Texas in early 1983. Couple months later I was in the record store and I looking for a new guitar album to buy. I look down and see this guy with a strat and a gun slinger look. Then I remembered what I read. So of course I bought it. Put it in my cassette player in my car and was totally blown away. That tone, those smoking licks and solo's. That was really the last time I was really blown out of the water by a guitarist. I mean, who can live up to this guy. He was the whole package. Great songs, good vocals, great rhythm section. I think SRV is the best blues rock guitarist to walk on this planet. I miss him....
0061537934|1.0|I purchased this book at Starbucks with no clue from the cover reviews and story synopsis that the story would be so depressing.  This story is not about a dog--it's about a man (the author) who speaks through a dog to tell a very depressing story about the highly anticipated death of a woman and the custody fight over her child.  The side story regarding the husband/father's car racing provides an interesting perspective, but it does not overcome the main story.  The reader can see the wife's brain cancer coming long before the wife is finally forced to see a doctor.  Considering how long the story characters wait before seeing a doctor, despite the symptoms of extremely painful headaches accompanied by dizziness and vomiting, it's no wonder the wife/mother did not have a chance of surviving.  Regarding the child, who in their right mind would allow a small child to live in her grandparents' household that is set up to care for the child's dying mother, when the loving, healthy husband/father who lives near by and visits his dying wife on a regular basis would prefer that his child stay with him.  What environment would be healthier for the child!?!  In addition, the dog man narrator is prone to gratuitous sexual observations that are just gross.  NOT A BOOK FOR DOG LOVERS!  NOT A BOOK FOR CHILDREN OR YOUNG ADULTS!  Advertising for this book should have been clearer!
B0017U7PT6|2.0|This movie was boring as hell. The movie took a long time to develop and the characters were uninteresting. The story was awful. And the movie is long. Not sure how else to explain it. But it gets 2 stars because it at least the pyramids looked good.
0425220931|5.0|Great book. If you're looking for a music instructional book with tabs and other things this is NOT the book for you. But, if you're looking for a way to mature musically this is the book for you. Victor Wooten has really captured the essence of song in this book. A must read for the serious musician. It does not matter if you play bass, guitar, piano, cello... (you get the picture) this book will be an eye-opening experiance.
B0000UJDLM|5.0|This film is definatly up there along side with critters, cheasy effects, but enjoyable movie, my son loves it....
B0000DD7LB|5.0|I love Britney and everything she has done.  This CD is my favorite!  This and her new one Blackout.  She has an excellent voice and both this CD, Blackout and her Greatest hits albums have so much variety in the music.  They are all on my mp3 player for school and workouts.  They are very upbeat compared to her earlier work.  Every song makes you want to dance... or if you cant dance (like me), it makes me work out harder... LOVE IT!!!
B00005MP58|5.0|This is one of the best shows I've ever watched.  Even my husband likes it, just because it is so well done.  But be warned - you'll end up watching late into the night because you don't want to turn it off!
B0015XASFS|5.0|I really appreciate this excellent DVD documentation of Josh's Salt Lake City concert on his AWAKE tour.  I was blessed to see him in Sacramento during the first leg of this tour last March. When he added the second leg of the tour for late summer, I flew to Seattle in August to enjoy the magic of this concert once again. No matter where he performs he is fabulous and his energy and interaction with the audience is gorgeous. This DVD captures the energy and devotion of Josh's audiences. Even little kids were groovin'. It is rare to go to concerts where audiences are uniformly respectful and classy. Josh draws these kinds of fans and the feeling of being in a total \\"lovefest\\" with such a spectacular and flawless performer whose voice has no equal is beyond description. Not even a heavy duty downpour that we confronted after the concert could dampen the enthusiasm of people exiting The Key Arena into a traffic jam that boggled the mind. So I am going to close this brief review with a heartfelt thank you for a treasure that I will revisit often.  Rain or Shine.
B00008OLYN|3.0|I like Opeth. These guys consistently release quality material and Damnation is no different. My only beef with this album are the first three songs. The vocals are too, well, girly. They just dont do it for me. The remaining songs are wonderful and morosely beautiful. With a release like this I wonder why there are not more singles playing on like Mtv (my-bad they dont play music anymore) or adult contempo radio stations. Opeth does not suck and over 95% what is played on Adult contempo radio do suck. Still a large portion of American listeners are just too juvenile to like or understand quality music. (If you like bands like Opeth your not included).<br />If It would of gottne four stars if it werent for the first few songs.
B000YABYLA|1.0|I know everyone in the universe loves this movie but I found it absolutely unbearable. The dialogue was so painfully fake and unfunny, it seems like it was lifted out of a bad TV sitcom. Every single line from every single character was some witty obnoxious quip. The whole script reeks of a clueless, outdated older person trying to write like what they think hip young kids must sound like. Juno means well and the actors did their job, but it baffles me how people can sit through this movie without puking at 95% of the lines.
B0010VD7EO|4.0|ORACULAR SPECTACULAR is a difficult album to classify.  It's influenced by synthpop, but I'd hesitate to place it fully or exclusively into that genre.  Its sound is often reminiscent of the psychedelic-rock of the late 1960s, but the feel is more modern than that.  Musically, I was reminded of some of the stuff David Bowie and Lou Reed were coming up with in the 1970s combined with the Britpop sound of the mid-1990s.  Lyrically, I kept recalling Brett Anderson's work with Suede (particularly the [[ASIN:B00005G40P Coming Up]] album).    Of course, MGMT aren't any of those artists and have a distinct, unique sound of their own.  To sum up the album without reference to genre would be to use a word like \\"fun\\".  There's a lot of energy in this debut album.  They sounds very fresh and the music is extremely lively.  There's a not a lot of introspection, but there's a lot to jump around to.  Getting an experienced producer -- Dave Fridmann -- was likely a great way to give this young band a polished sound while still retaining their enthusiasm.    I really enjoyed this glam-inspired sound and definitely plan to keep my eye on this duo.  Hopefully this is only the first of many albums to come in the future.
B0011ZNAIC|4.0|I love animated movies and Bee Movie really doesn't disappoint. It's a solid film with a lot of \\"in\\" jokes and beautiful animation. The cast is great, the story is solid, the animation is excellent, so why not an A? The film does seem longer than it's 89 minute running lenth considering 9 of those minutes are credits! The animation while \\"BEE\\"utiful is really plain by today's standards and the film seems to run out of steam halfway though. It's still well worth seeing and the single disc version has enough extras to keep me happy and it won't \\"sting\\" you pocket book like the two disc one.
B0015AARJI|4.0|Its been a week since I ordered the \\"Dualshock 3\\" from Amazon and trust me, I have enjoyed every bit of gaming since then. I have GT 5 Prologue on my PS3 and one of the best things that Dualshock 3 offers is intelligent rumble i.e the controller rumbles different parts of it with different degrees/intensities according to the action in the game. I got this one just in 2 days with Amazon Prime free shipping and its amazing. The extra 50gms or so compared to the Sixaxis and its little bit high price is just worth it.
0061537934|5.0|I stopped at Starbucks on my way to jury duty, for coffee and something sweet to get me through.  I saw this book and, being a dog lover, the cover caught my eye.  I read the flyleaf and had to have it.  This is as close to a perfect story as I've read in a long time.  Yes, the narrator is a dog who is wiser than most of us; yes, Denny is a zen-type race car driver (and I'm bored silly by the entire \\"sport\\" of car racing); yes, all sorts of bad luck is heaped upon Denny.  With all that I was caught up in the story and believed every word as true and in the very realest sense it is.  I've recommended it to all my friends and I recommend it to you too.
B00003CXCT|4.0|I love Star Wars - especially the original saga. The characterization and the story are \\"out of this world\\". George Lucas did a great job - and the story of the Skywalkers and the Force have any person on their seat with Sci-Fi action and swordplay. The only problem with this item is the digital effects of the Remake.. Certain scenes felt completely out of place to the original quality of the movie. Although it gives an added detail to the story, some of it could have been avoided. But all in all a very enjoyable movie box set - and a must for all the Star Wars fanatics
B000YABIQ6|5.0|\\"Mad Men\\" is completely brilliant and addicting. So well made, you could start watching from any episode, but then you'd miss the mesmerizing character and plot development. It's the most accurate portrait of marriage ever set to film, and also one of the most wrenching love stories. It captures the social strata of the times in chilling detail -- conveying not just overt discrimination but the way people actually thought. You'll realize how far we've come as a culture and also what themes are eternally relevant.
B00154GEFU|4.0|I have to tell you that it has been great fun to read the reviews of PHOENIX here on amazon.     In one corner, we have the Asia purists who have been waiting years for the original lineup to return. These are the folks who like the franchise, put up with Payne because the logo was still attached to his albums, and are now silly with excitement at the thought of hearing the original lineup reunited once again. I'm sorry, but this album could have been a collection of rap songs, and that crowd would still be singing its praises.     In the next corner, you have the Asia fans who are carryover fans of Yes, King Crimson, and ELP. Maybe it's been too long for these folks, but I think they were expecting a more \\"progressive\\" and \\"musically inspired\\" album. So, rightfully, this crowd is disappointed. But, I think these folks forgot what Asia really was in the first place: A group of great musicians from progressive rock bands that were trying their hand at writing pop songs. Did we forget that Asia had 14 charted singles in the 80's and very early 90's? You don't usually chart many singles unless you're writing fairly simple music for the masses.    In yet another corner, we have fans of the Payne-era Asia (yes, they do exist). To these folks, Wetton's style may be a little syrupy, although they probably still can't help but like the classic synthy-pop sounds of Geoff Downes that continues to dominate this band's sound.    Finally, in the last corner (yes, there are, in fact, four corners in this story) we have the realistic fans who have always liked Asia on the fringes, have always known that they write solid, but simple, pop songs with some (but not much) progressive influence, and tend to enjoy the over-synthesized world of Geoff Downes that, I'm sorry, has always existed from the days of the Buggles. For those folks, they'll see this album for what it is - yet another, altogether different version of the Asia sound that really has no relation to any of the previous lineups, including the original one. \\"But wait a minute,\\" you say, \\"This IS the original lineup you idiot!\\" Yes, I know that. But it has nothing to do with the original BAND. Know why? Because that was over 20 years ago. The members have grown, they've gone through different experiences, they're using different instruments, and they've been influenced by different things. Yes, this album is more Icon than Asia. But that's because Icon represents how the two main members (Downes and Wetton) have evolved. So it makes sense.    So, then, what can you expect from this album? Well, choose your corner and see above. Any way you slice it, you shouldn't expect great lyrics, overextended musicianship, or really anything other than pretty simple, but enjoyable pop music. It's not groundbreaking, it's not really even that clever. But you'll probably like it the same way you like a good cup of coffee - you're not really sure why you drink it because, if you really analyze it, it really doesn't taste that good. But, for some reason, you keep going back for more.    For those fans who have been around a while, think back to the 'Then & Now' album that they put out in 1990. The \\"almost original lineup\\" tacked four new songs onto that album. They were poppy, simple, a bit uninspired, but still pretty enjoyable to Asia fans simply because they hadn't really released anything new in a while (or at least it seemed that way at the time). PHEONIX is sort of along those lines. Personally, I enjoyed it. But, then again, I'm in corner #4. So I guess I would.    So, before you buy this album, ask yourself, \\"Which corner am I in?\\" And then, think it through, and read all the reviews here on amazon, and then just press the button and buy the darn thing because, after all, it's only $7.99! And, let me tell you, for that price, it certainly will not disappoint, no matter what type of fan you are.
0425223523|4.0|This novel is Amanda Grange's attempt to fill in some of the blanks left for the reader of the Jane Austen novel Persuasion.  It gives us the perspective of the happenings in that novel from Captain Frederick Wentworth's point of view.<br /><br />I enjoyed reading this book.  I did not realize that the first 117 pages would all be this authors imaginings of the meeting and then gentle courtship between Anne Elliot and Frederick Wentworth.  We are given much detail of the meetings between these two characters and are allowed to see how their admiration for each other turns to love.  Commander Wentworth (his rank at that point in the story) was understandably stunned when Anne Elliot told him that she could not accept his offer of marriage after all.  He reacted in a completely normal way, he was hurt, surprised, and very angry.  So angry that he immediately left the area determined never to think about her again.<br /><br />The story picks up eight years later.  I am glad that the author did not give us any details of what happened to Wentworth (now having the rank of Captain) during the time of his battling the French in the war with Napoleon.  Instead, we see what he was doing during these years through reminiscences with Harville and Benwick.  When Frederick goes back into Somersetshire he feels Anne has lost her youth, her beauty and her bloom.  Yet after only a short time of being around her he finds himself wondering if he has actually managed to erase all tender feelings for her after all.<br /><br />I have now read three of these 'interpretations' of Jane Austen novels as written by Amanda Grange.  Of Mr. Darcy's Diary, Mr. Knightley's Diary, and Captain Wentworth's Diary, I can definitely say that I enjoyed Mr. Darcy's Diary the most.  After that would have to come Captain Wentworth's Diary.  I thought Ms Grange managed to write about the time when Anne and Frederick were meeting and falling in love very well.  She made me see Frederick as a caring, concerned, loving suitor for Anne.  As always, Ms Grange followed the original novel very closely except in places where there was no information given in the original.  I enjoyed this book and can say that I think Jane Austen fans who are not quite so determined in having an author follow the exact example set down by Miss Austen will be able to enjoy this book.  Anyone expecting to read an exact extension in wording and thoughts of the Austen works will not be quite so satisfied.d, loving suitor for Anne.

1582701709|1.0|The Secret of this book is positive thinking, no big secret to everyone out there. I have seen where the author said she got the idea for this book while reading the book, THE SCIENCE OF GETTING RICH by Wallace Delois Wattles. This book is just another positive thinking book remade again. Buy the book THE Power of Positive Thinking by Norman Vincent Peale or one of Dale Carnegie books instead of this one.
B0013J30XG|5.0|I am normally not a fan of excessive CGI, but Speed Racer is so gorgeous and the effects are integrated so seamlessly that I think it's one of the most visually innovative and brilliant films I have ever seen.  However, the sheer overwhelmingness of some of the scenes may be a bit much for some older viewers, especially those who've never played video games.    The plot makes excellent use of surprisingly realistic business practices like intentionally devaluing one's own company's stock.  Some of this may go over the heads of smaller children, but it makes the movie much more intellectually interesting for a viewer like me.  Many reviews will dismiss this as a simple Good vs. Evil story or as having a unidimensional anti-capitalist message, but there was actually a good bit more to the plot than that.
B000A88EV4|5.0|this is definitely my favorite mike leigh movie of all. david thewlis is brilliant as the misanthropic main character and his wanderings through the city at night and myriad quotable diatribes are engaging and really draw you into the story. the people he meets along the way are engaging and unique. it's definitely not for those who want to watch the typical hollywood fare with happy endings and blindly optimistic main characters.  it is a very thought provoking movie with interesting characters and i would recommend seeing it even if you are not familiar with the other films of leigh.
B000I2J2W2|5.0|Picture never looked so good! See why Star Trek & Star Wars tip their collective hats to this stellar film.
B00127RAJY|4.0|Overall the workout is pretty good.  Actual workout time is about 25 minutes, not 20.  Plus if pressed for time, you'll want to load the DVD to get through her 2 minute spiel that you won't be able to fast forward.  I've done levels one and two.  I would classify myself as somewhere between a beginner and intermediate as I've been doing balance ball workouts and running for a month before starting this.  I do feel some knee strain in level one, particularly after a lunge segment.  I've paid attention to my form, but must alter the aerobic segment after the lunges.  She follows lunges with butt kicks, so I usually do the jump rope segment instead, and that helps. (I don't have bad knees by the way) There's not much stretching with this workout, which is reason to pay good attention to your form so you don't get injured.  I'll continue using this workout when I am short on time, but prefer my balance ball workout which includes more stretching. I prefer running to get in my aerobic activity.
B000WT7R6O|5.0|It's the chemistry between the characters that makes this series work. The two stars work so well together that you forgot they are acting and actually believe they are brothers fighting demons. Fantastic dialogue, plots and characters. Great series, happy it's getting another season!
B0014Z4OQG|1.0|Despite this being the first new monster film in a while, I found it flat an uninspiring. I could barely stop myself from skipping through the chapters. Save your money.
0694526088|4.0|I bought this because I have to read this for a class and wanted to listen to it in the car while on the road. This is definitely a \\"must read\\" for anyone that has aspirations of becoming a top level manager. It is very inspirational. The difficult part is trying to make the changes necessary to become great. Very thought provoking.
B000KRNCYY|5.0|The series of Celtic Woman CDs is producing a priceless series of wonderful music. This album contributes to the prior successes. I can play this CD for hours and hours and still enjoy every song. Beautifully done...  Celtic music is sensitive and delicate and these women do wonders in bringing this music to life. I would give 10 stars, but Amazon only allows me to do 5...  :)
B00005JPTK|4.0|The third adaptation of Richard Matheson's apocalyptic novel (behind [[ASIN:B000WC3A0I The Last Man on Earth]] and [[ASIN:B000P0J0BU The Omega Man]]), \\"I Am Legend\\" is a a fine film that features great chills, thrilling action sequences, and fine-but-uneven storytelling. Will Smith gives a terrific performance as Robert Neville, and does a good job of carrying this movie on his own for more than half its length. While the end might seem disjointed from the rest of the film, it is still very fascinating, leaving one to ponder the possibilities.<br />The DVD comes with terrific picture and sound, and some good extras. The alternate theatrical cut of the film is basically the same except for the ending, which is weaker than the other one. Overall, this is a fine film that fans of action/horror films will enjoy.<br />Movie/DVD Grade: B+
0743529030|5.0|This excellent book on audio could be helpful to everybody who wants something more out of life.  It's great listening in the car while commuting - I've listened to each of the 4 CDs about 5 times now, and will listen to it regularly for as long as I have it.  If you REALLY want to improve yourself, you should buy it and listen to it.  If you just want to be an average person, then don't buy it.
074325144X|5.0|I learned about this book while chatting with a clerk at a local bookstore as I was buying another book on running.  My first impression when she said the book described an approach to running  grounded in Tai  chi might be that it it would be some sort of philosophical approach to running  rather than anything practical.<br /><br />I was wrong!<br /><br />The book (and the very good video) really lays out an easy-to-learn (though perhaps difficult to perfect) approach to running that basically reduces the energy and body stresses that the usual approach to running has.  It is a beautifully simple concept where you basically lean into a run while coming down on one foot, letting gravity move you forward, while you with little effort then  move the other foot from behind you in sequence.  I read the book and practiced with someone who knew the technique and when things came together, it really clicked and running seemed a whole lot easier in terms of effort.<br /><br />My interest in chi running came in part because I have been bothered by shin splints on and off, in part because  I am not that regular runner.  I started with this book about a month ago, have done a couple of short runs (2-3 miles) and today ran my first half marathon.  The amazing thing (for me) is that my time was good (little more than my 10 mile pace) and I had NO feeling of pain in the shins during or after the race (or blisters for that matter).  This is when month ago, even a short run could lead to thobbing shins.<br /><br />I am definitely a huge fan of the chi approach and am going to keep working on it.  It may seem complex, but  just getting the basics down will go a ways to making your running easier on the body (and maybe speed it up to - my pace on some stretches of today's race included some of my best one-mile times).
B0015D3Z4O|5.0|I had first thoughts about this album and they were how come this 50 yr old is coming out with this music? and cover?? but surprisingly after I got the physical cd these thoughts changed, I was shocked myself to actually like the cd, its true its full with the kinda same infamous beats by timbaland and pharrell, but honestly its a good album, not thrash, and certainly better than 2003's 'American Life'. The cover I guess its alright now I like the album and here's my song-by-song rating:    Candy Shop: 5/5 pretty much the same as the demo that leaked a while ago, though with a heavier bass line, deff like it more since I watched her perform in life in new york. I listened to it a couple times and now the lyrics sound cool too     4 Minutes: 5/5 first single huh, pretty good choice and nice move by featuring justin in it. The beats are certainly what would you expect by timbaland, its a well put together track, and I started to like it more when the video came out. Deff good production, lyrics just alright...    Give it 2 Me: 5/5 Second confirmed single, its a fun song definitely, not that dancey, but its alright, a standout certainly since it is extremely different to what madonna has done before and totally opposite to what we are used to get from her, it is a slick pop song with infectious beats with a cool breakdown.    Heartbeat: 5/5 Another great track in the album, in my opinion is very reminiscent of Nelly Furtado's #1 single 'Promiscuous' for some reason, the lyrics are alright but the beats just make it a bright well thrown out there song.    Miles Away:3/5 This song is okay but it just doesn't flow...reminds me of her stuff for 'ray of light' and one of her songs in American life, 'love profusion'. Its a good thing she got sort of a pure pop acoustic song in the album which fits in it and keeps it down to what madonna has done before.    She's not me: 5/5 When I listen to this one just makes me want to sing along, its a cool track and has beats that make me think of her 'Holiday' era. The ending is absolutely brilliant.    Incredible: 2.5/5 Too monotonous, not so 'incredible' but okay...just the \\"boom's\\" from the back-up singers are fun to listen to, the song is kinda good but just at the end.    Beat Goes On: 5/5 this is so cool it still has the 'beep beep' thing going on, another good move by featuring kanye west.     Dance 2Night: 10000000000000000000/5 The best song in the album, not so dancey but is definitely a very cohesive track, the lyrics are okay but the beats are what make it outstand as well as the chorus feat timberlake. When I listen to it it makes me think of a steady disco night.    Spanish lesson: 3/5 Just the ending is good when she says 'work' and the guitar strings in the beginning but other than that...nothing more..well one thing more I guess...it reminds me of pharrel's song 'she wants to move'    Devil wouldn't recognize you: 4/5 Nice track, but very reminiscent of what justin did with 'what goes around...comes around'    Voices: 3/5 Reminds me of an old song of hers but I just can't fogure which one, it is a good way to close the album though, sounds pretty okay and sort of personal too. Not my favorite..    Overall its a solid album, pretty well done but I guess it is way too in line with what pharrell williams, justin timberlake and timbaland have done for their own albums, but it stills okay because madonna knows how to work it in her own way. Surprisingly I like it now, my fav is still track 9 cause it is just a very laid back song, and it isn't that similar to what pharrel timbaland or justin have out there. At least, a track does the difference.     Carlos JP
B0013FNC38|5.0|... Mr. Mraz just gets better and better with each passing year and each new album.    Despite this being only his 3rd studio release thus far, he continues to improve in leaps and bounds by experimenting with new styles, yet staying true to his own distinctive sound ( an eclectic mix of reggae, pop, rock and jazz -- even some soul / R&B in his latest offering ).    I've been a fan since 2003 when a friend introduced me to his music, and rank his 'live' 2-man show in Singapore ( 2006 ) as probably the best I've ever seen. We Sing, We Dance, We Steal Things is a long-awaited album, and it greatly exceeds all expectations.    Early favourites for me include Butterfly ( a hot funky number with lyrics reminiscent of O. Lover from Mr. A-Z ), A Beautiful Mess ( slow and acoustic, one of Jason's biggest strengths thanks to his flawless vocals ), and Love For A Child ( poignant with a soaring melody guaranteed to melt hearts ).     Of course, the other tracks are no less praiseworthy ( I'm just highlighting the ones I like most ). Details In The Fabric and Lucky are beautiful duets, and I'm Yours should garner good airplay if the radio DJs don't decide to overlook it.    As a fellow reviewer has rightly pointed out, JM is sorely underrated by an industry that bestows accolades and adulation upon many others who're much less deserving. This 30-year-old musical genius possesses more talent in his little finger than many others do in their entire bodies. He writes the most amazing songs, composes unbelievably gorgeous tunes, and delivers them with heartfelt sincerity.    And let's not forget his many other works from his 'live' albums, which aren't included in the studio recordings ( buy them if you haven't already! ).     Fans would've snapped this latest CD up by now, but I'd highly recommend it to anyone who'd like to know what truly GREAT musicianship is.
B000MRAAJW|1.0|Show is great if you get to watch it. Well I purchased this as a gift knowing that Amazon takes care of its customers. The first set was defective so we sent it back. They sent a new one and it is missing disc 3 but we have two disc 2's, great so i call amazon and they say we will send you out a new. Then I get an e-mail saying we can't send out a new one, so I call and they say since I took husbands name off the shipping they can't send a replacement. Keep in mind the address is the same but instead of both names on address label it only is mine, should not make a difference. Then I ask if I purchase a new one and it is defective then what, she tells me just go to a local store and buy it there then. Great customer service DON'T buy from us just go to the store.

1591841984|5.0|I love this book.  It seems to be a fair representation of Apple and Steve Jobs. If you are a fan of Apple, or are at least a little curious about the company and its co-founder, then give this book a read.
B00005JPNZ|4.0|(SPOILERS?: Some set-pieces are described in the second-from-last full paragraph; otherwise, nothing major.)<br /><br />The fourth \\"Indiana Jones\\" movie is as much fun as you'd hope it would be. But when you think about the movie later, it holds up like one of those bridges that Indy and his gang manage to cross just before it collapses. So let's cover the flaws first.<br /><br />* \\"Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull\\" - Whew, that title is almost as long as the movie! What's more, since said kingdom isn't really the movie's main point, this might be the film to have its MacGuffin in the title.<br /><br />* Some of the more heralded actors come off as lightweight. As a Russian villainess, acclaimed Cate Blanchett seems to be working out her Natasha Fatale impression. And while Shia LaBeouf is likable enough, he proves it takes more than a pompadour, a cap, and a sneer to emulate Marlon Brando in \\"The Wild One.\\"<br /><br />* Even my 11-year-old son noted that the movie's major set-piece is at least partially lifted from the recent \\"National Treasure 2.\\" And the movie's climactic fireworks - like the similar ending of \\"Raiders of the Lost Ark\\" - practically show us the scriptwriter (\\"Jurassic Park's\\" David Koepp) shrugging his shoulders once he reaches the end.<br /><br />All of that said, the movie rates as one of Indy's best adventures. The movie brings Indy (Harrison Ford, aging quite well) under the scrutiny of both the FBI and Russia's KGB when he inadvertently aids an old pal in the pursuit of the titular and powerful Crystal Skull. Despite his best effort to stick his neck out for no one, Indy gets caught up in the hunt for the famed orb.<br /><br />(Oh, and Indy's love interest from \\"Raiders,\\" Marion [Karen Allen], makes a welcome return. But far be it from me to disclose how she gets woven into the plot.)<br /><br />The movie is set in 1957 and makes vague nods to that era's interests in McCarthyism, UFO's, and psychic power. But all the \\"Happy Days\\" blather is eventually ditched in favor of heart-pounding stunts, and in that department, the movie is well up to the level of its predecessors.<br /><br />The thrills include:  an entire fake city that almost gets Indy nuked (the movie's least plausible set-piece); car chases and swordfights that seem homages to exec-producer George Lucas' \\"Star Wars\\" series; and the biggest bleepin' colony of killer ants you'll ever see.<br /><br />Like the famed dancing bear, the truth that a new Indy adventure is no longer novel, is less impressive than the fact that Ford, Lucas, and director Steven Spielberg pulled it off at all. Like its three-quel prequel, \\"Crystal Skull\\" is adrenaline-packed fun.<br /><br />\\"Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull\\" is rated PG-13 for adult language, violence, and some intense imagery.ounding stunts, and in that department, the movie is well up to the level of its predecessors.

B00005JPNY|5.0|Just loved this movie. I could see though that if someone hadn't read the book that it might not have made as much sense, but all in all it was very entertaining. The acting and special effects are wonderful. I highly recommend this movie to anyone who loves fantasy.
B000002BSG|5.0|I don't know how I missed this when it was first released but boy am I glad I stumbled into it. This album is looooooaded with groove from start to finish. The bass/drum teamwork is dirty, funky, pocket-syncopated heaven. The use of disco strings, latin accessory percussion, Rhodes pianos, etc works very well together without being kitschy or tacky. It sounds old and new at the same time. And, at the end of the day, who really cares 'when' it sounds like. To me it just sounds GOOD.     So groovy.
B0016HNOXQ|5.0|That's it, quickly and succinctly - this album is fascinating. I haven't gotten all the way through it yet... but I'm entranced. I've always liked Portishead, but perhaps I wasn't as attached to their trip-hoppiness as others were, because I'm having no difficulty accepting this new offering. I'm not going to challenge all who have given thrashing reviews - to each their own. But I think Portishead is, with THIRD, challenging what we expect from music. Must music always be comfortable? Must it always, even when full of despair, be soothing? Must it have distinct expositions, bodies, rising action, climaxes, falling action, conclusions? I think not. And I think Portishead has done a fantastic job of not only answering those questions with a resounding NO, but showing us what else is possible. If you wish only to be comfortable and find closure... then stick to the old. However, if you wish to explore new universes of sound... check this out!
B000000OAN|5.0|1975 and NO ONE was doing anything like Queen! This disc had been hinted at with Queen II, implied on Sheer Heart Attack and, finally, fully realized. I never knew I was listening to hard rock, never could figure out why my parents found this disc blasting from the basement night and day so damned annoying! A Night At The Opera is, arguably, Queen's crowning acheivement. While Bohemian Rhapsody-the most unlikely single to ever top the charts-plays with themes and musical styles, The Prophet's Song takes them all very seriously. Freddie was the showman and the heart of the band, but Brian May was the brains. Yet, Freddie showed his chops with the opener, Death on Two Legs and made us cry with Love of My Life. John  scored a top ten with You're My Best Friend-still standing up years later as the close to Will & Grace! And then there was Rodger, who's I'm in Love With My Car was a power ballad to his wheels. Not a bad song here-even God Save The Queen is moving! Any Queen fan worth his or her salt should get the Hollywood Records 2005 Deluxe Edition. In any case, give this one a listen, it still holds up nearly 40 years later-Oh God, how did we get so old?
B0018QCXGY|1.0|I'd give this movie 0 stars if I could. This movie is horrible and made no sense. Shaky camera aside, what was the plot. There is a monster, where did it come from. I watched the extras and all I learned is that the monster is a baby, which you don't get from the movie. You don't know what it is, where it came from, why it is here or why the movie is called Cloverfield when it takes place in NY. There were too many unanswered questions. Also, really who would hold on to a stupid camera that long and go back for it when it is dropped. Movie is pathetic, stupid and boring, also has a stupid ending. Waste of time, money and film.
B000Y7ZHCU|5.0|Both the disc's in this set were fantastic.  I especially liked the fact that the cameras were not skipping from shot to shot so as to give you a headache from jumping about at a dizzying pace.
B0019NG78Q|5.0|The nights are cloudy, the alleys are dark, the men are dangerous, bars are smoky and femmes are fatale. \\"Sin City\\" is a thing of dark, bloody beauty.<br /><br />It certainly says something if a graphic novel author helps out with a movie... especially if that creator swore he'd never let it be adapted. That is only one of the things that makes \\"Sin City,\\" the adaptation of Frank Miller's comic, such a fascinating film.<br /><br />\\"Sin City\\" is actually made up of three stories: In the depths of Basin (Sin) City, scarred hulk Marv (Mickey Rourke) sleeps with a beautiful prostitute, Goldie (Jaime King), only to find her dead beside him the next morning. Enraged, he goes on a killing spree to find her murderer, and learns that sinister cannibal Kevin (Elijah Wood) is responsible. But there's a powerful figure behind Kevin, who calls the shots.<br /><br />Elsewhere in Sin City, Dwight (Clive Owen) does his best to defend Gail (Rosario Dawson) and the other Old Town prostitutes. But when Dwight kills a crooked cop, he has to somehow cover up the crime. And Hartigan (Bruce Willis), a cop with a failing heart, goes out of his job with a bang: He rescues little Nancy Callahan from a child molester who happens to be a senator's son. Hartigan is jailed, and when he gets out, he finds that Nancy (Jessica Alba) has grown into a lasso-twirling stripper. But the senator's son -- nicknamed Yellow Bastard -- is still after her.<br /><br />\\"Sin City\\" is one of those few comic book adaptations that doesn't seem... well, cartoonish. Sure, it's the very image of noir, but the grim tone and grey characters are very real. It's not a movie for the fainthearted, but whoever enjoys the films of Quentin Tarantino (who directed one scene here) will surely be blown away.<br /><br />Like \\"Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow,\\" this film is done almost entirely digitally. But unlike \\"Sky Captain,\\" it has substance as well as style. All the sets and props are done with computers, and nearly everything is in black and white. Here and there we get a splash of colour -- red lipstick and matching dress, Yellow Bastard's face, green eyes.<br /><br />The contents of three \\"Sin City\\" comic books are interwoven here, and Rodriguez is constantly faithful: A lot of these shots could have been lifted straight from the comic's pages. He also preserves the stark, black-and-white style that the graphic novels are known for. You can't get much more faithful than that.<br /><br />\\"Sin City\\" is not quite a \\"Kill Bill\\" bloodfest, though -- surprisingly, this brutal movie has a dark sense of chivalry. Each story is about an outcast man defending a woman's honor, safety, or memory, even if he sacrifices himself in the process. \\"Sin City\\" wears its heart on its sleeve, even if that sleeve is bloodstained and torn.<br /><br />Most of the actors do wonderful jobs -- Owen's dark photographer, Rourke's scarred strongman, Stahl's revolting Yellow Bastard, and Alba's surprisingly sweet stripper. Only a few, like Brittany Murphy, have lackluster performances. But perhaps the most memorable performances come from Bruce Willis and Elijah Wood. Willis plays his aging cop role with unusual grace, even when shooting the genitals off Yellow Bastard. And Wood plays Kevin with both creepy evil and spiritual ecstacy... all without saying a word.<br /><br />\\"Sin City\\" is a remarkable, bleak, intense movie -- a halfway point between Tarantino and Raymond Chandler. An outstanding piece of work.there we get a splash of colour -- red lipstick and matching dress, Yellow Bastard's face, green eyes.

B00005N83M|3.0|I used to listen to Jennifer Lopez's debut album, \\"On the 6\\" all of the time.  As soon as I popped in \\"J. Lo\\", I immediately noticed a slight improvement in her singing voice.  I do not know if she was taking lots of vocal lessons or just matured a lot as a woman during that time, but it is easy to tell that she sounds better when she sings.  This album is similar to her debut because there is a huge Latin aura surrounding this album; that is something that I always enjoyed with her albums because since I like R&B, I don't get a chance to hear much Latin music.  Of course there is plenty of the pop/R&B sound on this album, but the Latin sound definitely gives her album distinction to other pop artists.<br /><br /> Many of the songs from this album were released to radio.  I can remember hearing \\"I'm Real\\", I'm Real Remix\\", \\"Love Don't Cost a Thing\\", \\"Play\\" and \\"I'm Gonna Be Alright.\\"  All of these numbers help to make this album a decent offering by the triple threat named Jennifer Lynn Lopez.  \\"Love Don't Cost a Thing\\" and \\"I'm Gonna Be Alright\\" both sound a tad like Lopez's first ever song, \\"If You Had My Love.\\"  Why?  Because they are all mid-tempo and contain much guitar.  Lyrically, this album never gets too profound, but \\"I'm Real\\", \\"Love Don't Cost a Thing\\" and the beautiful \\"Secretly\\" have lyrics that are a little deep.  As far as the production is concerned, it is good; there is lots of guitar and some neat drum arrangements found here.  \\"Dame\\" and \\"Corino\\" are definitely highlights.<br /><br /> Add this album to your collection because it can and will set many different atmospheres.  You will find yourself dancing, relaxing and/or setting a sexy mood with your object of affection all while \\"J. Lo\\" plays.<br /><br />Mikeisha's Top 5<br /><br />1. \\"Secretly\\"<br />2. \\"Love Don't Cost a Thing<br />3. \\"Carino\\"<br />4. I'm Real\\"<br />5. \\"Dame\\"
032147404X|5.0|The author does have a quirky sense of humor, which I found funny, personally. However, this book does offer clear and direct ways to improve the pictures you take, without going into pages of detail on photography science and theory. Although this won't be the last book I ever get on the subject, it is an excellent choice as one of the first.
B0000C5RQF|5.0|Like all works of art, opera is the sum of its parts.  Opera joins music, both sung and played, acting, both physical and verbal, costumes, settings, and lighting.  A video disk of an opera adds camera work and editing.  What I found remarkable about this disk is that the total is greater than the sum of its parts.  Yes, there is fine singing and playing.  The acting is expressive and appropriate.  There are quirky and specific costumes, often funny.  Glorious sets (the Masonic set and the sun both stand out).  Miraculously the lighting looks fine in the video.  I can only assume that the light was stunning to the live audience.  Having the light work both recorded and live is not so simple because the human eye and the camera see differently. Everyone who watched this disk with me walked around for a couple of hours happily dazed by our experience, whistling and singing excerpts.
B000I2IT44|5.0|Just terrific all around.  Great performance, great music and a great DVD.  The concert DVD trifecta.  I would have liked a little different approach to the video presentation; less artistic, more realistic, but what do I know except that I love this DVD.

B00154GEFU|3.0|In my opinion, the only things really wrong with \\"Phoenix\\" are: the production and sound of the songs are a bit flat -- what we're really missing is the large, \\"widescreen\\" wall-of-sound of the Mike Stone era. In other words: we need more pomposity!! Also, some of the songs are a bit long. Those ones with catchy hooks have those hooks and melodies watered down by too much repetition.
B000YDOOU0|5.0|I have listened to this over and over, I can't get enough. One of Metheny's most mature and enjoyable releases. What a pleasure to hear these three great musicians together. Pop this CD into your car stereo and I guarantee you won't be so aggressive behind the wheel. Enjoy.
B000ZN802W|4.0|*SPOILERS*<br /><br />Who among us hasn't, at one time or another, dreamed of one day chucking the whole \\"corporate rat race/adult responsibility\\" thing and moving to an isolated cabin in the woods where we would be free to get in touch with our inner selves and become one with nature?  Yet, even though many of us have fantasized about doing such a thing, few of us have had the intestinal fortitude or psychological wherewithal to actually go out and do it.  Well, Christopher McCandless actually DID go out and do it - though with sadly tragic results for both the young man and those dearest to him.<br /><br />At the age of 22, McCandless could have had the life of privilege, comfort and financial success natural to someone who had just graduated with honors from a prestigious institution like Emory University (especially one with wealthy parents).  Instead, he chose a different path for himself, one that would reject the materialistic values of the world around him and send him on a journey of self-discovery which, despite the best of intentions, would prove fatal to him in the long run.  Over a two-year period, from 1990 to 1992, Chris traveled all across North America - on foot, by kayak, by bumming rides off strangers - finally ending up in the wilderness of Alaska where he was to meet his tragic fate.  Along the way, he encountered numerous colorful characters who made a mark on his heart.  This adventure was popularized in the best-selling book \\"Into the Wild\\" by Jon Krakauer, who reconstructed McCandless' experiences largely from notes and journal entries left behind by the young man and through interviews with certain key players in the drama.<br /><br />For the movie version, writer/director Sean Penn has made Chris' devoted sister, Carine, the narrator and chief commentator on the action.  It is through her reflections that we come to understand some of the reasoning behind Chris' remarkable willingness to forego all the creature comforts of the modern world that the rest of us seem to cling to so tenaciously.  As with any tale of a picaresque nature, \\"Into the Wild\\" is more a series of vignettes than a fully fleshed-out drama, and, thus, it has an occasional tendency to ramble and wander aimlessly.  Yet, its narrative looseness is clearly a large part of the story's charm.  Moreover, Penn keeps it tightly knit together through the narration, the use of flashbacks, the scenes involving Chris' parents, and the mesmerizing fluidity of the camerawork.  And, naturally, the evocative, richly variegated landscapes against which the story unfolds play a crucial role in the overall richness of the film.<br /><br />Some have charged the movie with romanticizing and glorifying an individual who was arguably sociopathic and whose actions and decisions ultimately led to his own death.  Yet, while Penn clearly wants us to identify with Chris' sense of idealism and carpe diem spirit, the filmmaker also acknowledges that there are some serious psychological issues at play here, mostly brought on by the young man's being raised by two obviously dysfunctional parents.  Yet, the movie is also about how important it is for us to forgive those who have wronged us and to not allow bitterness to determine the course of our lives.<br /><br />With his boyish looks and unprepossessing manner, Emile Hirsch embodies the devil-may-care spirit of what is, essentially, a 20th Century version of Henry David Thoreau.  In relatively small but crucial roles, William Hurt and Marcia Gay Harden leave an indelible mark as Chris's parents.  The many individuals he meets along the way are embodied by Brian H. Dierker, Catherine Keener, Vince Vaughn, and, most memorably, Hal Holbrook, heartbreaking in his Oscar-nominated performance as an old desert-dweller who offers to adopt Chris as his son.<br /><br />In the end, \\"Into the Wild\\" can be read as much as a cautionary tale as one championing the cause of unbridled individuality.  Like \\"Grizzly Man,\\" it showshow an obsession with nature and an unrealistic disdain for civilization can lead to disastrous consequences for individuals unequipped to deal with the harsh realities of the natural world.  If anything, both films serve as a call for reasonableness and balance in determining mankind's proper place in the overall scheme of things.alistic disdain for civilization can lead to disastrous consequences for individuals unequipped to deal with the harsh realities of the natural world.  If anything, both films serve as a call for reasonableness and balance in determining mankind's proper place in the overall scheme of things.

B000ZFI1GK|4.0|I bought this CD set on the Eagles website after I saw them in concert this past week.  After listening to it all the way through twice, I think my first impression was right--this is a very introspective, thoughtful collection of songs.  Some of the songs are answers to earlier songs (e.g. \\"Last Good Time in Town\\" vs. \\"Life's Been Good\\").  Don Henley said that this may well be the Eagles' last record, so they wrote down all the stuff that was important to them.  \\"Long Road out of Eden\\" is a great song, as is \\"Frail Grasp of the Big Picture.\\"  This is a mature Eagles who have been through a lot and seen dramatic changes in their lives and in the world, and the songwriting reflects that.  I love this collection.  It's just what I would have expected from a grown-up Eagles.  Like fine wine, they get better and better.

B0016HMYEQ|5.0|After reading through most of the \\"bad reviews\\" I decided to post my own. I'm sure that most people simply dislike this movie because of the camera shakiness and, well, I agree... it really gets you and can make you feel dizzy at times but I think it adds to the movie, to the plot and to the whole experience.    Now, if you have never seen it you probably know by now that is about a monster -- that is unfortunate; Amazon should control comments that contain spoilers because a huge part of being able to enjoy the movie is to know absolutely nothing about it. Next, make sure you have a nice TV and a VERY good sound system; that will definitely help you enjoy the movie. Remember, the idea is to watch a movie the way the director intended it to be watched and Cloverfield really demands some powerful sub-woofer ;)    This movie will capture you and will take you into a journey right next to the main characters. The \\"apparent\\" single shot effect throughout the whole movie is amazing, the special effects are the best I've ever seen (watch the DVD behind the scenes to understand my statement and you will find that most of what you saw wasn't real) and the acting is not bad at all.    Give it a shot because, under the right conditions, this is probably one of the top 20 movies ever made. (Let the flaming begin).
B000002UAO|5.0|Whenever Sid is driving in his car on a crisp autumn day the first thing he thinks about listening to is some Beatles. And, Rubber Soul just might be the best album the Fab Four ever made. \\"Drive My Car,\\" the first track is good, a solid single for the lads. But, Sid tends to dislike many of the guys' \\"hits.\\" It's the second track, \\"Norwegian Wood,\\" that really kicks off the brilliance in the effort. This is one of the best song the group has ever done, and it is never mentioned in a listing of their better tunes. The  whole album is excellent with the exception of \\"What Goes On,\\" sung by the one and only Richard Starkey of course. The highlight, though, is the incomparable \\"Michelle.\\" Sid defies you to find a sweeter ballad. If you can't groove with the mellow licks at the end of the song, Sid doesn't know what to tell you.
B0010YSD7M|5.0|A \\"must-see\\" for any die-hard \\"Gater\\" who's been there for the full 10 year run.

Looking forward to the sequel, I'd like to see Gen O'Neill make an appearance in one, sure miss Jack and his antics.  Well Done Stage-5 crew!!
B00005AQF7|5.0|1993 was a magical year. It included two of the most influential pieces of art on the life of this young elf, Doggystyle, and [[ASIN:B00069QD74 Death Ring]]. It's amazing to think that Snoop was only 19 while making this classic on the heels of his watershed appearance in \\"Nuthin But a G Thing.\\" There are really no definite weak spots in the album. And how many rap albums can you say that about? Usually, you're looking at two or three quality track, and the rest is complete filler. Obviously, there are the hits, but the album also includes quality songs that never got radio play. This includes \\"That Shiznit.\\" Doggystyle is the very essence of what West Coast rap was all about in its day.

B0015D3Z4O|1.0|Saying Madonna has 'sold out' is a bit ironic since she's spent 25 years cannily positioning herself in the ever-changing musical landscape. Yet despite that marketing savvy, Madonna would have faded away long ago but for her habit of consistently taking chances in content and sound.     For a pop star, Madonna has taken huge risks over her career. From brazenly embracing the pop slut image on Like A Virgin to the moral commentary of 'Papa Don't Preach' to the confessional content of Like a Prayer to the overt sexuality of Erotica to the techno/spirituality of Ray of Light to the darker sound and statements of American Life, Madonna has always challenged what pop can be and say. No matter what window dressing she's wrapped in, Madonna always came through in her music.     This is why Hard Candy is such a complete failure. You won't find Madonna making any statements - or saying anything much really - on Hard Candy, and she certainly doesn't push the envelop in sound or content. In fact, if you've bought anything the producers on Hard Candy have made in the last year, you have already heard this CD. But don't blame them; they regurgitated their 'sound' exactly as they were paid to do. Bottom line: Hard Candy could have come from any brainless pop tart with the cash to pay the prostitutes (ahem, sorry, producers) who work on this CD.     There's little point in discussing individual songs, since they all have the same generic sound. The title track has a wicked bump to it, but the lame lyrics render it strictly PG in terms of actual heat generated. 'Give It 2 Me' is admittedly a solid, and very catchy, dance song. However, 'Dance 2night' - with its pop groove and message of self-empowerment - is the only song that sounds like Madonna actually showed up. And this is ultimately the reason Hard Candy is vapid, dead between the ears, and frankly dull: for the first time in her career Madonna doesn't bring anything to the table.     Hard Candy's lack of personality and theway it blends into the miasma of the current music scene forces me to theorize about why it was made at all. It sounds like a marketing move by Madonna to fill the void left by Britney Spears being out of commission. Just a guess, but I honestly can't imagine any other reason the most compelling pop artist in history would tarnish her catalog with this embarrassing, unmitigated failure.
B000T9W5MI|5.0|Nick Cage did well in this one.  Good action, shows how guns get around.
B0010YSD7M|4.0|Se esperaba más en cuanto a la parte final de la confrontasión con los ORI, el uso de los replicadores de nueva cuenta le reduce puntos a la historia, es una película que la clasificaría como buena, tiene sus detalles.
B000002UDB|5.0|I forget sometimes how amazing this album is. It's not usually mentioned along with the Beatles' greatest albums (\\"Sgt. Pepper's\\", \\"Revolver\\", \\"Abbey Road\\" and the White Album), but if you look at the number of masterpieces on \\"Magical Mystery Tour\\", I think it has to be in the conversation. (Maybe it's the ghastly cover that keeps it from getting its due?).<br /><br />Aside from a few lesser songs (\\"Flying\\", \\"Blue Jay Way\\" and \\"Baby You're A Rich Man\\"), every song is a timeless classic, with both John and Paul contributing some of their finest work. Eight out of eleven is a pretty hard to beat. Even by the Beatles.
B000TGJ8CQ|4.0|I must admit, I love time travel movies, but in the end, most fall short in the subject they're dealing with. They just can't get into their head that if you change one little thing, everything changes. \\"Next\\" avoids this problem altogether, by shrinking the margin of travel to two-minutes, for the most part. But I'm getting a little ahead of myself.<br /><br />Story: Nicolas Cage's character apparently can see into the future, which is both a blessing and a curse. He can see a bank robbery and a murder before it happens, and prevent it, saving innocent lives. But since the police can't see the future, they take offence at this mysterious magician seemingly punching people for no apparent reason. But he can also avoid them with this ability, which is how he chooses to live his life. But wait... then the darn government agents have to interfere, asking his to stop a nuclear bomb from going off. However, since his ability seemingly can only go two-minutes, he isn't much help. Until he meets a woman that seemingly amplifies his powers to great lengths.<br /><br />Concept: Pretty darn interesting, and original. His powers also evolve over time, making them and character, and for that matter, the movie rather unpredictable. And while the concept is handled rather well, the movie makes it very confusing for viewers that totally aren't mentally into the movie. But think of his powers this way, he basically can go \\"Groundhog Day\\" for two-minutes. Rather original, I think.<br /><br />Good Guys: Nicolas Cage is again amazing in the role, and is really perfect for the role, giving the character added depth and emotion. The character therefore is likable, and you feel for him, even though his background information is left completely out of the picture unlike most 'superpower' movies. Jessica Biel does surprisingly well, sure she doesn't blow you out of the water, and the character is pretty cut and paste, she still does fine with it. And even though Peter Falk is listed as one of the main actors, he has all but a few lines, and is more of a cameo.<br /><br />Bad Guys: Julianne Moore shows off her mean side in this film, and while she was never a bundle of joy, she isn't exactly a caring government agent in this film. Exact opposite, while she's doing her job, the character plays good cop sometimes, her only use for Chris Johnson (Nicolas Cage) is too stop the bad guys, which isn't bad, they just bring up some torture questions in the movie, which I personally could have done without. Definitely not the best of roles for Moore.<br /><br />Her partner however could be even worse, not because he's mean or anything, but thank god he only says a few lines, because he's just a downright pathetic and horrible actor to the nth degree. You cringe everytime you hear him speak. Soap-Opera bad doesn't describe it, it's Sci-Fi channel bad. Pathetic, and a real oversight on the director, and Producer Cage. The terrorist on the other hand are pretty bland, and cardboard. But with the main terrorist's name being \\"Mr. Smith,\\" did you expect anything else?<br /><br />Effects and Action: There's a bunch of \\"oh snap!\\" moments in terms of action in this film. Particularly the jumping over the tracks, and totally awesome hill sequence. That was just amazing, until the part at the bottom, where I noticed a couple of effects that looked about ten years old. But other than that, they rarely fail to disappoint. While they aren't exactly blockbuster, they're pretty good considering the rather low budget.<br /><br />The End: Here's the thing, up until this point, I've thoroughly enjoyed the movie, and was ready and willing for another half an hour, and it looked as if it was heading in that direction, because that's what happened in every other movie like this. They go through the scenario the first time, screw up, try it again, get it right, happy ending. However, with this movie, you're forced to make up the ending on your own. 'But wait, I'm seeing somebody else's story, so I don't have to make up my own.' Well, if you're that type of person, and most of us are, you won't like the ending at all. But apparently, they didn't have the production budget for it, so they cut the movie about 30 minutes short. Sure you'll feel cheated, sure you'll be angry.<br /><br />Overall, this movie is a rather enjoyable popcorn flick, and a great movie to see on TNT or something. It has a great concept, an interesting story, and good characters. However, all these element have their glaring flaws that mar a otherwise great movie. It's still a good movie, just not great. Also, you have to really pay attention to this movie, because you'll get confused very easily if you don't. Chris's power evolves, and sometimes you don't know what is the future, and what is the present, so sometimes you'll be shocked. But if you do pay attention, the movie is actually improved because of those otherwise confusing elements. And I actually would love a sequel to this movie.ou're that type of person, and most of us are, you won't like the ending at all.

6305313687|5.0|This movie rocked the nation when it came out. It's the film that put Edward Norton(Incredible Hulk, The 25th Hour, The Score) on the radar.<br /><br />The movie is a statement about racism, family and hate. Anyone that has seen this movie, can relate in one way or another. It makes you think about what you've done, what you've said and where that hate comes from. Everyone can take something away from this film, some lesson, some meaning.<br /><br />Ed Norton plays a racist, he goes to prison and when he gets out, his younger brother Edward Furlong (Terminator 2, Brainscan, Jimmy and Judy) is just like him. A racist full of unbridled hate for no good reason. Norton is healed, no longer a racist, matured and past that stage of his life, he tries to get his brother help and the movie escalates from there, twisting and turning, until the dramatic climax.<br /><br />A classic, everyone should see this movie!
1582701709|1.0|I have read most of the ctitical reviews for that book and I agree with most of them. It is not my intention to repeat it here.  I was trying to picture the kind of person that I would grow into if I lived by those principles.    1- I would turn into someone who is living in an illusionary world, a fantsy world created that has nothing to do with your reality and eventually I would spend my time day dreaming and getting nothing done.  2- Where does your modesty go if you think that the world is at your command? The book assumes you know what's right for you, what's good for you? what would make you happy? Do you? No one does. It is in the belief that god has the best for you where you would find happiness. Not in getting your 'orders' fullfilled. Sometimes a bad accident would turn out to be the best thing that ever happened to you. You never know what's best for you. Only god does.  3- What about work ethics? you don't need to work hard to earn more money??! Maybe you don't if you decide you want to become a thief for an example. Or sell books of that type, selling people fantasies. We are living in a world were it is very easy to pry on people's greed.
0312360266|2.0|When Zoey Redbird is chosen to be a Vampyre, she is scared and angry.  But she isn't the typical Vampyre fledgling at her new school, the House of Night.  Nyx, the goddess of the Vampyres, has chosen Zoey is an extraordinary Vampyre. With Nyx's help, Zoey finds solace and strength.     This book is highly addictive.  However, the characters and the writing style is extremely annoying.  Zoey's friends are the typical \\"outcasts\\" who only want to rag on the popular girls, who are way too nasty and all too \\"mean girl\\" stereotypical.  In fact, all of the characters are obnoxiously stereotypical.    But, if you're looking for a \\"curl up under your covers\\" sort of book, this book is the one to buy.  It isn't, however, one of the best vampire books I've ever read.
B0016K40KO|5.0|First of all, this is a fantastic movie about British POWs building a bridge in 1940s Burma for the Japanese. The dvd is an excellent anamorphic transfer of the movie in its original 2.55:1 format, and the picture is incredibly clear. The price now stands on Amazon $5.00 more expensive than when I bought it, but I would still recommend purchasing it if you are a fan of classic movies.
B0013D8LOK|4.0|My best friend and I differ on opinions on this one.  And I think it might have something to do with-she can't relate to anything dark or sinister.  Me on the other hand have no trouble going there.  True there is a lot of bloody scenes but it only enriches this sad story of a tormented barber who was so in love with revenge that he couldn't see what was in front of him.  Acting, direction, music score-everything was just perfect.  See this film.

1400063515|5.0|How does one describe this book??? It is a tour de force of philosophy, mathematics, psychology, finance, statistics and NNT, himself.  First, I absolutely love how Taleb thinks out loud.  I feel like I know him now--especially after reading the book twice--the second time very, very slowly with pencil in hand.  He is a very, very deep thinker and the fact that he chooses to let us be a part of his thoughts is a real gift--as he does not need to publish books.      Taleb's scope is both broad and detailed and he brings to life the great thinkers of past centuries.  Poincare, Mandelbrot, Plato, Sextus Empiricus, Algazel... The Black Swan is a history of philosophy to the nth degree--centered around unpredictibility and the unknown.  Taleb has an amazing brain, and amazing emotions that shows a passion for his topic unsurpassed by others.  From a coctail party in Europe with intellectuals to fractals and statistics... His conclusions make total sense.  I really like this gentleman.     One can't solve a problen unless you percieve the problem correctly. Taleb's numerous chapters on how we, how our brains and egos are programmed to misperception and are utterly invaluable. I feel I can much better assign -- or especially not assign causality to events.  Another life lesson that I think about almost every day, never run for a train.  And needless to say, I was compelled to tossed out all of my economics--which felt so good to do.    For all those reviewers who gave this book a negative review, I can only conclude that they read this book very fast and that they were looking to find a get rich quick solution -- which this book is not about.      And for those who have not read this because they think it's just another popular culture book on decision science--you could not be more wrong.    This book was a profound, unique experience, from the first word to the very last word. When I finished, I just wanted to start reading it over again.       It was a Black Swan that told me about this book. I will never be the same.     --Sara

B0000029GA|5.0|This is the best hip hop album of all time IMHO. Flawless from beginning to end. The only problem I have had with it in my dozens of listens is that I have started to take Nas' verses for granted, when just about each and every one is some of the sickest rapping that's ever been put on wax.     This is an album where I can totally feel any song as somebody's favorite, but for me it's either Life's a ***** or One Love.    Buy this album or your collection won't be complete, even if you're not into hip hop at all.
B00000AFWW|5.0|This album should be owned by anyone interested in modern rock.  It is absolutely stunning and withstands any number of listenings.  I don't care what the songs are about topically -- they're passionately performed and perfectly presented.  You won't be disappointed.  Just ripping, gripping rock that persist long after the first listening.  You'll never shrug it off.
B000VECAEO|5.0|This is the last season of Seinfeld and of course, it's very funny. To say that Seinfeld is funny is like saying a radio active dump is just a little toxic. What I love most about this season is Puddy. They must've realized how funny he and Mr. Peterman were and started using them more. I wish they had made more seasons if only to see more of these two. All the characters are great and keep you laughing. I give this season of Seinfeld a double thumbs up!

It is the best Chomsky book I have seen- to be sure he has written hundreds and I may have missed a better one years ago. Let's just say it's the best of the last 15 years. He covers many subjects, clears up misunderstandings, and explains his philosophy in depth. I cannot recommend this too highly.

0810993139|5.0|My 7 yr old loved the format,  great book to pick up for a few minutes before bed.  Strongly recommend.
0765342294|3.0|The storyline was engaging but overall predictable. I agree with a few other reviewers that the lack of description was annoying but I can live with that.    The brother and sister felt like a side story. I think it was supposed to show all three were gifted with the same skills and could use it, but it felt out of place and not at all parallel to what Ender was going through and very disconnected.    I can agree that Ender is a particularly gifted kid and smart kids will identify with him. However, I have a realism problem with the existence of the other kids in the school. Card had put an introduction to this book, and seemed disgusted at the guidance counselor who argued that kids \\"just don't talk like that\\". However, I have to agree with the counselor. Rather not about Ender, but the other kids in general, most of them didn't feel real to me. Others can blame this on lack of character development, but I felt that most of the other kids were not realistic in the way they acted or spoke. If this is a school for the best and brightest, these kids are not it. I could, conceivably, amount this to my lack of military background and understanding, but I don't think that teaching a 10 year old trigonometry is comparable to what this kid is producing in strategy and command and tactics.    The worst part of it is the lack of questioning, which again can be said to be military conditioned. Children want to know why. Especially the gifted ones. Conditioning them to not ask (or even not to think about it?) is restricting their ideas. And the point of using children is so that they create new things no adult had ever seen before. I find this illogical.    All in all, I took a powerful message after reading this book. I think many others will also. It is particularly philosophical that happens to be written in a sci-fi setting (that I don't necessarily agree with) in an era of politics and war. Nothing particularly new and exciting except for the message that I received, which I think is strong enough to be grateful for.

0060595183|5.0|Aldous Huxley was ahead of his time. And yet, he was right where he needed to be. In a time when modern society had not quite caught on to the mind-expanding powers of psycho-active drugs, psychology was still interested in how they might be used in a beneficial way.  Thus, Huxley, one of the most dedicated thinkers of a generation, was able to participate in and produce feedback for, a controlled psychological experiment in which he used mescalin to produce an altered state of consciousness.  That anyone could participate in such an experiment today and go on to write candidly about it seems unthinkable.<br /><br />Today our lust for political correctness has rendered such ideas as the ones expressed in \\"The Doors of Perception\\" and \\"Heaven and Hell\\" to be nearly unspeakable.  These two short books are combined in one book, and complement each other.  I believe it is only Huxley's reputation as a creative author, poet, philosopher and thinker that has allowed this work to be taken seriously at all, and to remain part of our collective past.<br /><br />Certainly, one cannot read his lucid chronicle of his mescalin experience in \\"The Doors of Perception\\" or his evaluation of it in the remainder of that book or in the book \\"Heaven and Hell\\" which follows it, and believe he saw no merit in the judicious use of psycho-active substances.  Huxley describes both psycho-active drugs and hypnosis as tools for accessing what he calls the \\"antipodes\\" of the mind.  And yet, society has such a social stigma about trying to do that by whatever means.<br /><br />As a certified hypnotherapist, I can say that society is still mostly in ignorance of the usefulness of hypnosis as a profound tool for accessing realms of the mind that are typically unaccessible. The use of a mind-altering drug for such a purpose has fallen into deep disfavor, with the anti-drug advocates lumping psychadelic drugs in the same category as narcotics and other dangerous drugs.  And yet, indigenous cultures have used them for attaining spiritual visions and experiences for as long as they have been available to use, and continue to use them to this day.<br /><br />The desire to transcend the human mind is as old as humanity.  It is the natural result of enlightenment, often achieved only after many years of meditation and intense spiritual practice. And yet, Huxley himself was able to achieve this, at least temporarily, through the use of mescalin.  In his own words: \\"For the moment that interfering neurotic who, in waking hours, tries to run the show, was blessedly out of the way.\\"<br /><br />I believe Huxley saw the use of psychadelic drugs as a useful tool for opening the normally very filtered awareness of the conscious mind to perceptions that are usually inaccessible.  While they have great power, they should also be respected.  Yes, there may have been excessive use and misuse of it in the 1960s and 70s, but that is also the period that produced some of the greatest social and creative breakthroughs we take for granted today: things like civil rights, women's liberation and music legends.  It is good to step back once in a while and take in the big picture.<br /><br />Huxley experienced the ability of a psycho-active drug to take its user to much more expanded and profound levels of consciousness, levels rich with possibility, long before the social activism of the 1960s.  And yet, his book most likely influenced the willingness of that generation to experiment with such substances, a generation that demanded change as a result of its shared vision and experience.<br /><br />I was surprised to note as I was preparing this review that this copy, which is at least 30 years old, was printed on 100% recycled paper. This was long before it became fashionable for the publishing industry to be \\"green\\" and \\"earth friendly\\".  Again, this book was ahead of its time.  The pages of my copy of this classic are thoroughly yellowed.  Unfortunately, at that time recycled paperwas not also available as acid-free, so the pages have weathered with time.s have weathered with time.

B00005JPS7|5.0|When the Comic inspired movies have been hit or miss lately,  Iron Man is a BIG hit.  After Daredevil,(awful) The Hulk bomb, Fantastic Four...eh, at least we got to see Jessica Alba, and even the last Spiderman came up really short, this was a very welcome surprise.  Robert Downey Jr. is excellent, as is Jeff Bridges, and Gwyneth Paltrow.  The story is very well executed. (Having never read Iron Man in my days of youth, I didn't have to waste 2 hours making sure the screenplay was exactly like the old comic.)  I imagine the film could have been longer in order to add more dimension and back story, but this delivered the goods, and I look forward to the sequel.  5 stars!

B000E1MTY0|4.0|No, I didn't buy the DVD but rented it from Netflix. The first Batman movie with Michael Keaton was good, the rest I did not like. But this one I liked--a lot. I was never a Batman fan, too dark and sinister for my taste. But this one, which \\"explained\\" how Batman came to be, was very good. I've always liked movies that attempted to explain how certain characters came to be, especially when the character as originally created sort of pops up out of nowhere and you are asked to accept they are what they are with little or no background. Such as Sherlock Holmes--great stories, seen many of the movies that have been made, but \\"Young Sherlock Holmes\\" provided some background that helped put a lot of the stories into perspective. I'm sure there were those who hated that movie because someone other than Conan-Doyle wrote the story.

As a matter of fact, I'm debating with myself whether I should put it in the trash whole, shred it first, or go to the zoo and throw it inside the monkeys' cage and watch them turn it to spaghetti.<br /><br />This book takes a few well-known phenomenon (mind-over-matter at times of emergency, among others), and uses them as proof of the validity of its theory. Sirens went off in my mind when I read most testimonies of the \\"enlightened souls\\" who provided their proof of success and gems of wisdom, when they said \\"I got ..... and was the ENVY of everybody\\", whether a wife-mansion-car, you name it. Just how people who boast of becoming the source of envy for whatever they acquired can be models of enlightment is beyond me. Using the \\"because you're worth it\\" pitch, and with contents that are just as worthless, the book joins many that feed on the discontent-sadness-frustration of the average human, but, unlike the few which offer something of value, this offers unmitigated crap. Not just is it a book that confirms \\"money-mansion-Ferrari-wife-the-envy-of-all-men\\" as signs of \\"being there\\" in the world of \\"light\\", but it also asserts that whatever fate befalls anyone is the result of the negative thoughts of their very own mind. What about children that are kidnapped-murdered? earthquakes? Tsunamis? Holocaust? The list of tragedies can be very long...If the premise of this book were true, wouldn't the logical conclusion be that we should not have prisons or punish \\"criminals\\", for, whatever they did was, in truth, the doing of the mind of the person they did it to? (And, by the way, why do these very enlightened souls go to doctors, and take whatever prescribed pills every day when the real source of all illness, according to this book, and the source of all cures, is their own mind? Why do they themselves say things like \\"oh, but this is something else\\"?) And, beside every \\"success story\\" of someone who wished himself an object that made him \\"the envy of others\\" and actually got it, how many others have wished just as strongly and got nothing? But I can guess the answer, \\"you did not wish it correctly/strongly enough\\", etc and, just like the \\"scratch and win\\" cards where you never win, there is always the thought, and the wish to believe that, yes, it does work, only it is on some other card, that some day you, too, might possess...lf an object that made him \\"the envy of others\\" and actually got it, how many others have wished just as strongly and got nothing? But I can guess the answer, \\"you did not wish it correctly/strongly enough\\", etc and, just like the \\"scratch and win\\" cards where you never win, there is always the thought, and the wish to believe that, yes, it does work, only it is on some other card, that some day you, too, might possess...
B000OVLBHG|4.0|I give the film four stars but i give the re-release of it 2 stars. Sure its got a real cool cover but other than that is empty other than the 1997 commentary. I would suggest buying the special edition or waiting for a re-re-release with the second disc provided by the special edition which containes some great making off features.

B00003CXCD|5.0|Roman Holiday is an incomparable romantic comedy; truly one of the most enjoyable films of all time.  It is also Audrey Hepburn's debut starring role, for which she won a Best Actress Oscar.  At just 24, Audrey was young, stunning, talented, charming, radiant, majestic, cute, elfin, and clearly at the top of her game.  Rumor has it that the credits originally were to have Gregory Peck's name first, then the title of the film, then the statement \\"and introducing Audrey Hepburn.\\"  After the first week of filming, Gregory Peck called the studio and the director, and told them something along the lines of  \\"Audrey Hepburn IS this movie; her name needs to appear above the title with mine.\\"  How noble and gallant.  Mr. Peck, himself, is top-notch in this role; I fall in love with him a little more each time I watch it.<br /><br />This movie was filmed on location in Rome, and the scenery is breathtaking, making this movie all the more romantic.  My husband and I have fun pointing out all of the places we have been.  The restoration is very impressive; the print looks fresh and clear; the details are vivid.  It is also interesting to notice the play of light and dark, of shadow and bright.  These techniques are used at their best in this film, and are lost (and perhaps unnecessary) in color films.<br /><br />We recently showed this film to our 11 year old daughter.  It was a lazy, rainy Sunday morning, and she \\"didn't have anything better to do.\\"  She started watch with some token protest, and then watched quite intently.  At the end, she said, \\"Hey, that was pretty good...and I didn't even really notice that it was in black and white!\\"  There is hope, yet, for younger generations!<br /><br />This film is romantic, playful, sweet, fun, delicious, beautiful, and charming.  I give it my highest recommendation for anyone.
B0006IUDXA|5.0|As a kid I loved MacGyver - the quick witted secret agent who, given a stick of gum and a hair comb, could get out of any situation.    As an adult I still love MacGyver but for very different reasons.     There are the clever scientific escapes that could give the Mythbusters a couple of seasons worth of material, but this is not the best part. The episodes are so badly written, the plot lines so thin and riddled with logical errors that they are the very height of entertainment. There is also the joy of looking back on fashions that have dated badly (big hair and shoulder pads anyone?) and high-tech gizmos that look clunky today.     For a show that just can't be taken seriously there are hours of hilarity to be had here. It's my favourite show all over again!    From a DVD production perspective, however, there is nothing here to note. There are no special features whatsoever which is a shame. So much value could have been added with just a couple of commentaries or interviews reminiscing.
1400049628|5.0|This book goes hand-in-had with World War Z.  It is clear Brooks wrote both of these books.  The ideas he began formulating for this title were all put into practice in World War Z.<br /><br />For anyone who loves zombie literature and fiction, this is the book for you.  It has definitely influence the way I enjoy zombie based entertainment.  I find myself looking at everything though the lens of this book.  The best thing about this book is it for the most part makes sense.  There are some places where critiques will say he missed this or that point, but I think everyone will agree that the overall quality of this book is high.<br /><br />A high point for me was the history of zombie outbreaks.  It was interesting to see how Brooks postulated one attack, even if squelched, would lead to another and how they connected.  Also his interpretation of how media outlets in todays instant news world would report on these incidents.<br /><br />This is a great book.  Both interesting to read and entertaining.  A must for the zombie lover.
0800141660|5.0|After having had my mind bewitched and my senses ensnared by Alan Rickman after watching him in the Harry Potter movies I started looking up Rickman clips on YouTube and then I decided that I needed my own collection of Alan Rickman movies. Sense and Sensibility is the first AR film I've purchased. It is glorious and beautiful and most likely the most perfect example of a Rickman movie, save for Harry Potter. The whole movie is wonderful and I've watched it several times already. Emma Thompson and Ang Lee did everything so perfectly that I cannot find fault with this movie. It is everything a romantic English drama should be and all of the actors were perfectly cast. Of course my favorite is Alan Rickman, but I loved the chemistry and dynamics between all of the principals. Hugh Grant is really sweet and gorgeous in this movie too and Emma Thompson is beyond reproach. Probably the best scene in this movie is at the end between Emma Thompson and Hugh Grant, but I won't describe it just in case you have not yet seen this movie. It was awesome and it made me cry.  Kate Winslet was great too, although her character is kind of a pain in the neck. This film is what a great romantic story is all about, unlike Titanic in which I thought the script and the dialogue were ridiculous and dreadful and there was a total lack of chemistry between Kate Winslet and Leo DiCaprio, which is too bad, because Winslet is a fabulous actor. Now for the question all us romantics have asked ourselves: Why would anyone choose Willoughby over Alan Rickman???  Here's another thought for all the Harry Potter fans. Wouldn't it be great to see a whole movie about Severus Snape in heaven with Lily, played by Kate Winslet?
0743435729|4.0|This second book in the series has a lot right going for it, and is a solid follow up to 'On Basilisk Station'.  While it falls a little short from its progenitor, it is still a solid read.<br /><br />Honor, who is a little one dimensional, is still the strong, hyper-capable commander that Weber seems to prefer.  It is a little tedious that she can do no wrong, so the fact that he allows her a small misstep is nice to see.  The side characters, especially the Graysons are also welcome additions.  It's nice to see so many supporting characters from the previous book make their way back here.<br /><br />Unfortunately, Weber mitigates this some by making an enemy even more intractable and stubborn then the previous book, this time in the form of the Massadens.  Their evil is a little to extreme for me, and I would much rather see some shade of gray in the actions and responses.  Also, Weber continues to have Honor face off against un-believable incompetent allies and superiors.  While this can be interesting, Weber tends to go to this well a bit to much.<br /><br />The story itself is good, well paced, with satisfying battle scenes.  The ground combat scenes are a bit week, as Weber is clearly more comfortable with the more strategic distant space combat.  There is thankfully less time spent with detailed and tedious explanations of tech, although there is still a significant amount of time spent with one character giving long winded explanations to another, explanations that would seem out of place anywhere but in a novel.<br /><br />Overall, this is an excellent read and one I recommend to fans of the series.
B0001I561E|5.0|This item was excellent. And I recieved it within 2 weeks, so I was very pleased with the standard shipping service.
B00005221M|5.0|This is one of my all time favorite movies.  There is practically nothing wrong with this movie.  Michale Mann is an expert at his craft, and this is one of the early examples of this expertise.<br /><br />The writing is superb. This is not that unexpected as it is based off of a quality book.  The dialog is believable, and the love story seems real, something many movies have trouble with.<br /><br />The acting is probably one of the high points.  Daniel Day-Lewis is an actors actor.  The man is a craftsman with very few equals.  He is exciting and believable in the action scenes and captivating in the dramatic ones.  Everyone else in the movie also perform to a demanding standard, and its hard to find any performances not to love.<br /><br />The thing that I think the movie has going for it the most is its' look.  This film is nothing short of beautiful.  Much of it is shot in the Smokey Mountains, and when they are in the background, they almost steal the show.  The night battles have a crisp feel to them, to the point you can almost feel the weather.  This is still one of the prettiest films I have seen.<br /><br />The only real complaint I would have about this movie is there are some pacing issues.  There are sections of the movie that drag a bit.  Not much, so this isn't a major issue.<br /><br />All in all, I would recommend any one to go see this movie.  It is a classic, and rightfully so.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I didn't even know this show existed until I heard buzz about it when Serenity came out.  After seeing the movie, I almost immediately bought the series on DVD.  It is, in my mind, one of the better relatively new sci-fi series that has been released.  Good writing, good acting, an in depth plot-line with each character adding context and sub-plot in every episode, and a wonderful world created with a strong push on reality.  An all around wonderful series.<br /><br />The DVD Box set is a good size with a well made box.  The DVD authoring isn't everything I would like it to be (no play all option!!?!?!), but there are extras that are worth it.<br /><br />\\"They have the advantages on us sir.\\"<br />\\"Everyone always does.  That's what makes us special.\\"
0812548094|4.0|The second book in the series, it holds up well and carries on what was good about Wizards' First Rule.<br /><br />Why they didn't just call this Wizards' Second Rule, I will never understand.  I do like the convention of each book learning a new rule and seeing it applied in the end game of the book.<br /><br />The story and themes this book touches on are both interesting and very touching.  The importance of love and the dangers of it is one of the great themes of this book, and done well with the Sisters of Light.  Also, the poor nature of prophesies to be understood in any way other then hindsight is something I definitely like.  In to many fantasy novels, prophecy is so spelled out that it hardly resembles the idea of it any more.  At some point, it just becomes direction.  This book continues to handle prophecy very well.<br /><br />As always Zed is a pleasure to follow, and Richards story line is also interesting.  I find Kahlan to be a bit tedious, but her story is not all together uninteresting.  The addition of Gratch is well done, and you find yourself like him very much.<br /><br />This book continues in the vain of the first, and does an admirable job.  If you enjoyed Wizards' First Rule, you will enjoy this book.
0465092756|3.0|I picked up \\"Not Even Wrong\\" after working my way through \\"The Trouble with Physics\\" by Lee Smolin.  Both books attack the problems of string theory from much the same direction - string theory shows none of the results necessary to be classified as anything more than a new type of math.  In other words, if you can't use it to predict any new results and it only confirms old results by presetting all your variables to already known values, it's not science.  And the opposite of science is religion, which is exactly how a lot of string theory adherents view this new math.  \\"The Trouble with Physics\\" is an easier read, with lots of background, history and characters.  \\"Not Even Wrong\\" assumes you are already up to speed on the theory, because Peter Wolfe spends very little time spoonfeeding the precepts and gets down to foundation level problems immediately.  I have no background past high school level math and physics but can usually hold my own with popular science texts.  I would not recommend \\"Not Even Wrong\\" as a beginning text or even intermediate - this is for people who understand the concepts already.
B00154GEFU|5.0|I've been a fan of the group since I was little.  My Mom bought the first album and Alpha on LP and we listened to them a lot.  I've followed Wetton over the years and was excited when he and Downes started recording albums together.  I was hopeful for a full-on reunion but wasn't holding my breath.  When I read that this album was coming out I knew I wouldn't be disappointed.<br /><br />Phoenix is a great CD that is as good as the originals.  I won't do a song by song review here, but the entire album is strong.  I would have to say that, \\"An Extraordinary Life,\\" is the best song on here.  I've already purchased this album four times; one for me, one for my best friend, one for my Dad, and of course one for my Mom.  Stuff like this doesn't happen all the time, so if you're a fan of the original group, savor this moment and enjoy the new album...you won't be disappointed!
0385338724|5.0|This is another gem of a book from Sophie Kinsella! Remember Me? focuses on Lexi Smart, a girl in her mid-20s who is having a really crummy turn of events. Her job didn't give her an annual bonus (although all of her coworkers got one), her boyfriend's nickname is 'Loser' Dave, her dad's funeral is impending and she can't catch a cab to save her life. Basically she feels hopeless and in need of a life makeover. The twist that makes this chick lit book different from others is that Lexi has a traumatic accident and wakes up with amnesia. She can't remember three years of her life and apparently all of her dreams came true during the three years she's forgotten. She has an executive level job, money and a handsome, successful husband. Reading Remember Me? and following Lexi as she tries to piece together what the heck happened that changed her life around (and whether it's all it's cracked up to be beyond the surface) is a real treat. I thoroughly enjoyed this book and the fact that it isn't totally predictable like other chick lit novels.

1582701709|2.0|The most important part in reading this book is to strip away all the faith, quantum physics, and magical stuff the book blabbers about.  Let's call this fluff.<br /><br />Separate the fluff from the core content and you can see the value in what they're saying.<br /><br />It's about thinking positive and taken action on those thoughts.  Wishful thinking will get nothing done.<br /><br />I'll give you two examples:<br /><br />1.) A friend of mine who went to the casino after reading this book tried to \\"visualize\\" the winning cards coming while playing blackjack.  Obviously, he didn't win a lot of money.  Things don't happen for a reason, we make reason out of things that happen to us.  So his interpretation was that he wasn't trying hard enough.<br /><br />2.) A recent movie, 21, based on a true story about a group of MIT students that believed they can make a ton of money by creating a system that would put the odds in their favor.  Like my friend they believed, but instead of just taking that positive thought into Vegas they used that energy to drive them into developing a system down to a science.<br /><br />That action eventually won them a lot of money, then a book deal, then a movie, and a sponsership for an online casino company.<br /><br />Think of positive thoughts as the flint, but action keeps the fire burning.<br /><br />BEWARE OF FOOLS GOLD.  You will hear people say they were thinking hard for an open parking space and one happened open as I was driving by.  This is coincidence.  We've all had them well before the secret came out.<br /><br />There is no need to pay for any of this.  You can watch the DVD for free online, read the book at the library or the bookstore, and listen to the podcast.<br /><br />The secret is not really a secret, but a clever repackaging of how positive thoughts attract.  The fluff is there to market and fill the book.
0807014265|5.0|I bought this book because I was searching for yet another book on workplace bullying and another book came up in my search based on Frankl's book.  I read the customer reviews on that book and one reviewer said something to the effect of, \\"If you want to read a book based on Viktor Frankl's opinion of how to get along at a bad work environment (like a Nazi death camp), why don't you just read Frankl's book?\\"  So, that's where I started.  I read it.  Twice.  Then I got out my computer and typed in passages that had meaning to me so I could re-read them during difficult times.  I compressed the entire book down to about 10 pages, single spaced.  I must admit that I consider myself a negative, often depressed sort of person, mostly because my work situation is so demoralizing.   I was amazed by Frankl's coping mechanisms on how to get along in a difficult situation; every day meant multiple incidents of having to choose the correct path to avoid death or worse, making the choice to give up on your own life (suicide).  He went through 5 years of that and lived to tell about it.  It is a must read for everyone, particularly when you are having the hardest time of your life. I could tell that if I had read it as a college student, it wouldn't have the same meaning as now, when I am 50 and have had many ups and downs.  I see everything at such a deeper level and appreciated this book so much more than I would have if I were younger.  Briefly, the lessons in the book written 50 years ago still apply today.  Here they are: Let luck be your guide. It's not what you know, it's who you know.  Network with the equivalent of a one-step-up lateral (not your own) middle manager and they will help you when they can.  Schmooze.  Be kind to others.  Don't complain, it doesn't help. You can't fix, deal with or appeal to a sadist, so don't try.  Avoid sadists at all costs.  Keep your mouth shut unless asked for your opinion and then be short and to the point.  Praise, even when praiseisn't deserved.  Keep criticisms to yourself. Be inconspicuous. Work hard for the sake of doing a good job. Fantasize for escape. Everything can be taken away from you except for your past, so relish in it. When something good happens to you, write it down (keep a gratitude journal). Don't do anything that compromises your own values so you won't have regrets. Be careful who you abuse today because tomorrow they may be your master.  You are not your job, your title or your position. You are a unique person loved by others.  The only thing in life that really matters is the people you love and the people who love and need you. Love shared is eternal. Treat everyone with respect. The meaning of life is not what life can do for you, but what life expects of you; how you make the world a better place with your presence. The purpose of life is not happiness.  The purpose of life is discovering what you can contribute to it. Save a slice of bread (or whatever is the only material thing that matters to you when there is nothing left) for later when you are really depressed and it's the only thing left that can get you through that difficult moment.  (For me it's chocolate and a dark beer at the same time.) Apathy is the signaling of the beginning of the end of one's life.  Everyone that you respect and look up to has human failings.  Even tough guys cry.  Suffering without purpose is meaningless.  The larger the suffering, the bigger the lesson.  There's lots more in the book for you to discover and it's an easy read.
B000LXH0AE|4.0|This film is a real delight.  A modern-day fairy tale that brings the best out in its cast.  Thompson, Hoffman and the Queen are all very, very good and I dare you to not fall in love with Maggie Gyllenhaal here.  Ferrell is quite good, but almost a little too restrained for me.  This one will keep you glued to your seat while cheering on the protaganists.

0143113100|5.0|This book really was revelatory for me. Facing mid-age (I'm now 54), it was inspiring to learn about new developments in neuroplasticity that change the way we look at the mind-brain-body connection and what's possible when hereditary or environmental forces affect the brain's neuronal system.     The author, Dr. Norman Doidge, has a lucid writing style and does an excellent job of making complex experiments and new therapeutic approaches accessible to the lay reader. These pioneering scientists are putting rehabilitative medicine on its tail. If you think you knew what's going on in this field, think again. The creative leap in Dr. Moseley's use of illusion and imagination, or the epic difference that even a slight change in a physical therapy exercise can make in rewiring the motor map of the brain are astounding. It also says volumes on how we approach education as well as emotional and personality disorders.    Everyone should read this book while they still have the capacity to understand and appreciate its import. In the increasingly likely event in an aging population that you or a family member may be the unfortunate victim of a stroke, degenerative brain disease, or sudden accident, it may well mean the difference between a near-full recovery and the assisted living door.
B000J0NIIW|5.0|All right, now let's be clear about something.  This is a SWEEPER.  It is not a VACUUM.  It is going to pick up surface debris really well and do that best on hard surfaces.  In fact, it is GREAT on hard surfaces.  It does a decent job on carpet; don't expect it to do a deep cleaning.  It is great for a quick clean on carpeted stairs.  Yes, it has a small collection cup but it takes about 5 seconds to empty, snap back in place and keep going.  As others have said, don't keep the battery in the charger; it will shorten the life.  This is not unique to this product, as my husband, who growls at me for leaving my laptop plugged in all the time, will tell you.  Run the sweeper until the battery runs down, charge the battery for no more than 8 hours and put the battery back in the sweeper.  This is pretty clearly spelled out in the instruction manual.  Anyway, I have been watching the infomercials for this thing for years and finally decided to buy one at Target.  We are in the process of converting most of our flooring from carpet to tile, PVC tile and laminate and this is virtually all we are going to need to maintain those flooring surfaces!  I'll keep the vacuum for occasional deeper cleaning of rugs and stair carpeting but I have a feeling it's going to be gathering a lot of dust!  If you don't expect this sweeper to behave like a vaccuum and are looking for something for quick daily maintenance, this is for you!
B000007VCO|2.0|Oneness is a minor effort by the great Carlos Santana. The songs seem to be cut off very quickly as the extended solos just come in. Knowing Santana is a perfectionist makes me think that this was probably for the best. The art work and surrounding message are very spiritual, a little cultish looking back from our perspective and perhaps a little baffleing if you're not very familiar with eastern religion. He has some good moments as he does in all of his work especially in Song for Devadip. However, if you're not a very devoted fan I would stick to Barboleta, a very good album. There's nothing on Oneness that Santana hasn't done much better elsewhwere.
0525950079|5.0|It takes quite a story to keep me for over 1,000 pages...fantastic book!  I hated to finish and leave behind the colorful characters of Kingsbridge.  Yes, there are some disgusting scenes in the book, but that was how it was in those days.  I suggest reading Pillars of the Earth first to have the beginning of the story and to understand all the references. Pillars of the Earth was a superb book, too!  Plan to stay up late at night...I ended up reading hundreds of pages at a sitting.

B000WGWQG8|5.0|This was probably one of the best mini-series I have ever seen on television.  It's authenticity is beyond compare.  I recently read that they used real horse manure on the streets - ugh - but effective.<br /><br />This film was beautifully done.  Paul Giamatti is absolutely brilliant, Stephen Dillane aka Jefferson is incredible and steals every scene, Tom Wilkinson aka Benjamin Franklin is superb, Laura Linney is fantastic, Danny Jones, David Morse, Rufus Sewell, and Sarah Polly etc. are equally as wonderful.<br /><br />The dialogue is spot on for the time period.  You can feel the hand of David McCollough in this movie.  You can also tell that Tom Hanks was involved.  Tom is known to do justice as a producer to period films (i.e. Band of Brothers and From Earth to the Moon)<br /><br />If there was ever a mini-series in which everyone and everything deserved an award this is it.<br /><br />Note - this is a mini-series for those of us who like historical and period film.  It's starts slow, revs up in the middle, and ends slow but once you start watching you can't stop.  You get really invested in this film.<br /><br />If you are not interested in period movies this is not the movie for you.  It's pretty long --but wonderful!
B000VAPZM2|5.0|Dear Amazon,I bought this movie specifically for my Grandaughters because they liked the first one so much they weren't disappointed at all and they love to sing and dance with the movie.Thank you C. Cornett
B0014I4KIK|3.0|Got this and enjoyed a listen, but the songs just don't grab me.  I saw all the comparisons to other singers and I'm sorry, she's no Dusty Springfield.  Their voices don't sound anything alike, but the artist I thought of when I listened was Jewel: both have good voices and both wrote cliché-filled songs (oh, and both have just one name).  Duffy's voice isn't quite as good as Jewel's though, and Duffy's songwriting isn't quite as bad as Jewel's. Three stars because it was enjoyable, but can't go higher because it's over-produced (too much echo and vibrate, etc.) and because the lyrics are predictable and dull.

Having said that, this video could have been great but is absolutely horrible in one key area; the picture editing. The video's picture jumps from view, to view, to view rarely spending more than two or three seconds on any one camera. I get dizzy watching it. Good grief, I want to watch these incredible musicians play their instruments. It's as though the editor was either overzealous or had a very short attention span.
0805079831|1.0|To conflate Chicago School economics with despotic governments, one must suspend objectivity and ignore contravening facts, as Ms. Klein has obviously done.  And to insult perhaps the greatest intellectual freedom fighter of the 20th Century with this intellectually dishonest, leftist screed, is unforgiveable.  I would very much like to see Ms. Klein debate the Peruvian economist Hernando DeSoto.      Read Capitalism and Freedom by Milton Friedman, Free to Choose by Milton and Rose Friedman, and The Mystery of Capital by Hernando DeSoto.  In them you will find sound economic analyses and logic, none of which you will find in The Shock Doctrine.
0375701427|3.0|This book opens with Skip, a very old man, coming back into touch with his childhood idol.  Swede was anything any boy could hope to be--smart, athletic, genuinely sweet and caring.  He was a star athlete in high school, joined the Marines, married Miss New Jersey, and dutifully took over his father's successful glovemaking factory.  His life should have been perfect.    But there was one imperfection in Swede's ideal situation--his adored and pampered daughter Merry as a teenager became a rabid anti-war activist and, at sixteen, allegedly blew up the local post office before disappearing from Swede and his wife's lives.    Swede's search for his daughter and his bafflement over what could have caused her behavior ends up destroying this noble man, damaging his marriage, his relationships with the rest of his family, and ultimately causing Swede to second-guess every aspect of his own personality.    The basic story in this novel was excellent--it was fascinating to read about Swede's life and the chain of events that brought him to adulthood as the kind of man he was.  I enjoyed the details of the glovemaking industry, and the insight into being Jewish and being married to a Catholic.  I also liked reading the story of Dawn, Swede's wife, and her experience in the Miss America pageant.    However, at the end of this story I was left with a pretty murky sense of reality.  Skip states close to the beginning that when he heard the basics of Swede's story from his brother, he began to imagine Swede's experiences.  Was this entire story out of Skip's imagination?  Does it bear any relationship to what actually happened with Swede and Merry?  The book ends so abruptly, too, that I didn't feel like I had any sort of resolution.  What happens between Swede and Dawn?  What happens between Swede and Merry, and does the rest of the family become involved?  And, most importantly, what DID cause Merry to go so crazy?  It seemed her childhood was so perfect, her parents so absolutely loving and devoted.  Was that an accurate picture, or was Swede's brother right when he said his niece was smothered by her perfect parents?  Was she mentally ill, and her breakdown had nothing to do with Swede and Dawn?  I would have liked to have had a bit more clarity when it came to the accuracy of this tale, and especially when it came to what Merry was actually feeling.

B000Z0OX9O|1.0|One track on this album has the absurd title \\"Unveiled Twinkling Space.\\"  It fits the album well because the album is all twinkling.  It's all wind chimes and cheesy wind effects and almost no music from the movie \\"Blade Runner.\\"<br /><br />I'm not a Vangelis fan.  I think he's pretentious, for one thing.  For another, I think he's got very little creative talent.  He tends to take about eight notes and repeat them endlessly, without even varying the tempo or the key.  He can't think of codas--all his pieces fade out or fade into one another.  There are exceptions to all these observations, of course, and they tend to be the strongest cues on this album.<br /><br />What I am is a \\"Blade Runner\\" fan, and a film music fan, and I'd really like to be able to listen to music from the movie without dialogue, sound effects, and dumb wind noises interfering with my enjoyment.<br /><br />What's the point of the dialogue that we hear over \\"Main Titles?\\"  If I wanted to listen to dialogue, I'd watch the movie again.  It's not even the best lines from the movie--just Harrison Ford listing a bunch of numbers (from the Esper sequence).  I love Rutger Hauer's closing soliloquy, but when I listen to music, I'd like it to be music, not a soliloquy.  Vangelis must have understood something of this, so he reprises \\"Tears In Rain\\" on the second CD, without the dialogue.  But unable to let the music stand by itself, he inserts a wind effect over the whole track.  Where's the wind in \\"Blade Runner?\\"  Rain I see, but wind?  If only there were rain and no wind, or wind and rain, but why wind and no rain?<br /><br />I also don't see much point in CD 3.  Music inspired by the film.  It doesn't really evoke the film, though--most of them some like John Barryesque lounge music cues from 1960s Bond movies.  The last track seems to be entirely composed of wind and a child asking a series of questions.<br /><br />?<br /><br />Six cues on CD 2 contain music actually used in the film.  Eight cues on CD 1 contain music actually used in the film.  In all, that's less than an hour of music.<br /><br />I can't really complain.  I knew what I was getting, and bought it anyway.  I don't feel like I was conned out of my money.  I bought with my eyes open.  I just wanted to hear the music from \\"Blade Runner.\\"  Like Deckard entering teh Bradbury building, or Baty dying without distracting dialogue or sound effects.  It's a humble wish, I think, and I don't think I'll ever get it.<br /><br />But I see, if no one else does, that the Emperor Vangelis isn't wearing any clothes.In all, that's less than an hour of music.

B00000FC5H|5.0|In their seventies heyday, Earth Wind and Fire were one of the hottest touring acts in the world and an unstoppable singles machine. Band leader Maurice White and main singer Phillip Bailey had a chemistry that was almost unbeatable, and top notch musicians brought the chops. White eventually hit a supple groove that was both funky and popular, and when the hits started coming, like \\"Shining Star\\" and \\"September,\\" they helped make disco into a bit less of a dirty word.<br /><br />They had another secret weapon in the EWF Horns. Punchy when they needed to be, smooth jazz when required, they often provided an 'x' factor in the band's best work. The band mixed these elements into a dynamite stage show that rivaled George Clinton's Mothership era for sheer audacity and showmanship. While there are no live tracks here, if you've ever seen the camp classic [[ASIN:B00009APB6 Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band]], you'll see a tiny fraction of the excitement when the band performs \\"Got To Get You Into My Life.\\"<br /><br />Listening to this CD several years after what EWF tunes had been trimmed from my library is a real trip down memory lane. From the opening Black Pride Themed \\"Shining Star\\" to the road-trip classic \\"Getaway,\\" these are all memorable hook-fests that livened up many an AM radio in the 70's. White often had a Utopian vision that he emphasized in his lyrics making these tunes both danceable and uplifting. Bailey's distinguished falsetto livened the ballads (like \\"After The Love Has Gone\\"), but EWF's real genius was making songs that were irresistible funky grooves. If you don't find yourself bopping to \\"Boogie Wonderland,\\" check and make sure your feet are still attached.<br /><br />Only frustration - missing \\"Love's Holiday,\\" \\"Magnetic,\\" \\"System of Survival\\" or anything post 1983. Could have been a double disc, easily. But really, even without them, this single disc EWF CD is indispensable if you're an oldies buff.

B00154GEFU|5.0|I loved Asia's lush sound back in the 80's and they bring it back now in spades. The album's title seems designed to reflect the rebirth of their classic sound. What is just as striking is the compellingly catchy flavor of the songs! They still know how to ride a hook on the melody with their uncanny ability to sound like a hard rock and soft rock group simultaneously. It's a real treat to hear them back in their prime 25 years later. I hope they do more of this in the years to come.

B000K7VHJQ|3.0|I was one of those who was surprised by the extensive critiques of the film as anti-Jewish....believing the film simply reported what was in the Gospels.    Many years later, my understanding of the critique has deepened. Christianity has for two millenia treated Jews as responsible for the crucifixion, and utterly rejected Jesus' commandments to Love Thy God with all thy heart, and Love Thy Neigbhour, as well as other important commandments to not embrace Mammon, and not Exalt themselves. The history of Christianity is a history of Hate Thy Neighbour especially the Jewish Ones, and follow Mammon at all costs including the colonization of other nations, the slavery, exploitation and even genocide of their people (eg. the millions of Natives killed in the Americas).    How does Gibson's film feed the anti-Jesus practices of Christianity? It focuses on the Church's teachings that Jesus' suffering 'paid' for humanity's sins, so that those who 'believe' in him are 'saved', whereas those who do not, especially the Jews, go to hell. Simply put, Jesus never said or encouraged such absurd notions. On the contrary, he specifically said 'I come NOT to save the world...'. and his parable of the Pharisee and the tax-collector specifically contradicts the arrogance of Christians who imagine they are already 'saved' because they believe in him as the 'universal' Saviour, when he himself contradicted these notions.    By focussing morbidly on the beatings, torture, and crucifixion of Jesus, carried out by sadistic Romans, not Jewish priests (who simply wanted him dead), Gibson encourages precisely the wrong teachings of the Church, which Jesus' own statements deny and contradict. No doubt it is based on a sincere effort by Gibson to portray what he has been taught, but those teachings are a distortion of what Jesus himself said. But then it is foolish to expect a Hollywood star - later exposed as an anti-Jew in his arrest in California in a drunken state making rabidly anti-Jewishravings - to understand, let alone convey, the true teachings of one of the great Masters...
B000VBJEEG|5.0|Ratatouille tells the most unlikely story of Remy, a rat who disdains garbage and wants nothing more than to cook and eat gourmet food. Ratatouille progresses at a good pace and it held my attention all the way! The animation is excellent and the voiceovers are very nicely done.<br /><br />When the action begins, we meet Remy (voiced by Patton Oswalt), a rat who must run for safety along with the other rats when they are discovered by the old woman whose attic they inhabit; and this is after poor Remy has already been \\"relegated\\" to food inspector to make sure that no food is poisoned. Remy's father only complains that his son Remy is way too picky about food; and Remy's brother Emile (voiced by Peter Sohn) \\"tolerates\\" Remy even though he doesn't understand Remy's desire for gourmet food.<br /><br />After a harrowing, close escape from the woman whose house they inhabited, Remy finds himself alone in the sewers of Paris. He has lost his way and he doesn't know where his fellow rats and his family are. However, he soon discovers that he is underneath the kitchen of his idol chef, Chef Gusteau (voiced by Brad Garrett) who has written a book entitled \\"Anyone Can Cook.\\" Eventually Remy wanders into the kitchen and risks his life to see what goes on there, although he is saddened when he earlier discovers that Chef Gusteau is now deceased.<br /><br />Things become even wilder! Remy saves the day for a young, newly hired garbage boy named Linguini (voiced by Lou Romano); Linguini cooks a terrible soup and Remy secretly adds a few things to make the soup even more then perfect. Pretty soon Remy and Linguini actually form a partnership with Remy hiding under Linguini's chef cap and tugging on Linguini's hair (either left or right with his rat paws) to tell Linguini what to put in the soup to make it wonderful. Linguini's subsequent success is extremely disturbing to the crude, bullying chef in charge Chef Skinner (voiced by Ian Holm). Chef Skinner tries to get Linguini to admit that a rat is behind his success; but Linguini never admits anything even when Skinner gets him drunk.<br /><br />Of course, from here the plot can go anywhere. Will Skinner be able to hide the secret that the restaurant belongs to Chef Gusteau's son--Linguini? What if Linguini and Colette (voiced by Janeane Garofalo), another cook in the kitchen, begin a romance--will this complicate things or help things along? What becomes of Remy--will he stay in the kitchen working with Linguini? Will Remy ever find his family? And what happens when the nasty restaurant critic Anton Ego (voiced by Peter O'Toole) wants to destroy Chef Gusteau's restaurant's reputation? No plot spoilers here, folks--just watch the movie and find out!<br /><br />The DVD has a plethora of extras. You get an interview with the writer and producer; and there are three deleted scenes. There's also a short animated film entitled Lifted.<br /><br />Ratatouille is a strong film from Disney and Pixar, although I do agree with other reviewers that the film could have been tightened up a bit to run a few minutes shorter. This is an excellent family movie but there is, of course, the possibility that some won't be enchanted by the images of rats running en masse through restaurant kitchens.

B00006IX0R|4.0|It is not hard to be a fan of the Cranberries.  Their Irish Pop/Rock sound is unique.  Most of the music on this CD is laid back.  If you want to really do some head banging, this is not the CD for you.  If you want to listen to some relaxing music that puts you in an introspective mood, then this is what you want.  The Cranberries music, like a lot of Irish music, spends a lot of time reminiscing about the past, how life has been going, and how it will be.  Some of the observations are melancholy, some are astute, some are humorous.  If you just want some background music to listen to as you relax and read a book or magazine, I'd find something else.  I would listen to this when you're feeling a little down and need a consoling shoulder or a pick-me-up.   I found that I'm not really thrilled with how the songs were lined up. The songs didn't seem to transition well in places.  See what you think.  Overall, I was glad I purchased the CD.  I love the Cranberries and look forward to any new music they bring out to us.
015626224X|5.0|Orwell's first published book established a literary name for him and brought him some moderate success, which must have helped to escape the conditions that the book describes. It is a 'non-fiction' book with a lot of fictional spicing.<br />Roughly, the book has two parts, as the title indicates: the Paris part is dominated by work as minimum salary helper in restaurant kitchens, then the London part is exclusively given to trampdom, caused by homelessness and joblessness.<br />The two parts are oddly different in tone. The Paris adventures are, despite misery, darkly comical; the comedy aspect is clearly intended. The descriptions of lodging, eating, resp. not eating, working, partying are interjected with darkly funny tales about the types that populate the urban slums of the Paris of 1930. Some of them are quite disgusting, like the tales of drunken Charlie, who considers raping sex slaves as the ultimate in true love, while pitying them is base emotion. Or friend Boris, the ex captain of the White Russian army who considers Jews so far below a Russian officer, that they are not even worth his spittle. Less obnoxious is the tale of the miser who gets talked into investing some of his matress money into a load of cocain for transportation to England, gets arrested for possession, but freed when the police finds out it is 'face powder', whatever that is. The man dies of a broken heart.<br />(The Orwell of the Paris half has a contemporary successor in Germany, an investigative journalist named Guenter Wallraff, who has made himself a name as undercover serf in the worst paid jobs in Germany, and is honestly dreaded by German employers.)<br />The conditions in the two restaurants where Orwell works are so abominable that one would rather not eat in France any more. Of course that was nearly a century ago, and today everything is different. Right?<br />Orwell then had enough and had hopes for a job in London, so he went back, but found his hopes frustrated. He runs out of cash fast and spends weeks with the homeless crowd, tramping from one asylum to the other and writing 'hotel reviews'. There are few jokes in this part. An intriguing quote from this part: a clergyman and his daughter came and stared silently at us for a while ('us' being a group of tramps waiting for the shelter to open).<br />Orwell includes some theoretical chapters, like suggestions how to improve the legal situation, a typology of beggars, and a glossary on street language. This part lives mostly from his portraits of fellow tramps. The most impressive character is a pavement painter, who turns out to be a veritable philosopher. (An embittered atheist. He did not disbelieve in God as much as he disliked him.)<br />The book is highly readable, despite its uneven character.

0812550706|5.0|First of all, my review of the book - Ender's Game (and the Ender saga as a whole) is a wonderfully written story that tells of an unusual boy in unusual circumstances and at an unusual time.   All in all, it is a relatively short (in the good way), easy-to-read and highly memorable book, and I wholeheartedly recommend it to both newcomers and veterans of this genre (this applies to the whole saga).     Now, on a more personal note, after reading through some of the less sympathetic reviews here, I think people have been way too harsh on this book.   One of my favourite aspects of Card's writing is that he leaves room (other reviewers have called it gaps) for your imagination to fill. He doesn't specifically and absolutely tells you everything that happens in this world, and this makes a lot of sense since each book in the saga is told from the perspective of one individual, or at the most a certain group of individuals with very similar circumstances and experiences. This creates, for me at least, suspense and encourages me to constantly speculate what is going on around the characters (this is also the case with the Farseer trilogy, which is also a very good read). It also makes the book much more realistic for me, since in real life we also don't have the whole picture at all times.  One opposing example for this is the Wheel of Time of saga, which started out as very interesting, but since you most always know what all parties are doing (bad guys too), all that's left to for you to look forward to is see how the protagonists will react, and not what they will also discover (as is the case in the Ender saga), which in turn led to the saga growing very dull as it progressed (to me at least).    And just one more quick thought - I think Card, in Ender, has created something new and amazing in the fantasy/sci-fi genre- a story that manages to intrigue its readers, make them think and imagine (which is what we read these books for), while being easy-to-read, and relatively light (both in length and in \\"heaviness\\", for lack of a better word). The only other saga that is as good as Ender, in my mind, is Song of Ice & Fire, and it is HEAVY.

0143034901|5.0|It is not to often that I say a book should be a classic, or enjoy reading something that was a gift from a family member, especially my wife. In this case both can be said. I recently read a list of the top 100 books that every man should read, and was surprised this under 500 page novel was not on the list. It is definitely one of the top 100 books you should read during your liftime.<br /><br />I admit that my reading is pretty focused on the popular authors such as Fleming, King, Bensen, Patterson, Grisham, Gardner, & Harrison, so I was a little suspect to read something new. What a surprise.<br /><br />This book is a true mystery that holds the readers attention through the actions and the characters involved. I found it to be sad, thrilling and hilariously funny.<br /><br />The setting is in Spain during the 1940s and 50s. The main character is a 10 year old boy named Daniel Sempere. Daniel does a lot of growing up during this novel and becomes a man. The history of Spain during this time period is very important. The novel does reveal some of Spain's history, but I found that my interest was so sparked that I had to do some research on my own to learn more about Spain and the Spainish people during this period of history. It helped me gain a better insight into the culture and the society of Spain.<br /><br />A friend of mine who read this novel after me said very plainly to me one day, \\"This is a book about a book.\\" It really is a novel about the mystery of the author of a book that Daniel has swore to protect. He also said that if you don't like this book, you probably don't like reading too much.<br /><br />One of the richest and funniest characters in the book is a man named Fermin Romero de Torres. Some of the quotes that this character speaks in the novel are worth highlighting and bending the corner of the page to refer back too. All the characters are interesting in their own respect, but Fermin is my favorite and if you decide to read this novel you will understand why.<br /><br />I look forward to the next novel by Carlos Ruiz Zafon, that is translated into english, and if there is no translation, it might be time for me to take a spainish class or two.rd to the next novel by Carlos Ruiz Zafon, that is translated into english, and if there is no translation, it might be time for me to take a spainish class or two.

Living with them is Toby, a young boy who's an alcoholic and doesn't know about their secrets...<br /><br />THOUGHTS: A STUNNING movie. Great music, amazing singing, and great gothic visuals that add to the gloomy and dark feel to it. As a Dark Comedy, it works as well- for such a tragic movie, this has lots of Dark Comedy!

B0000931QA|3.0|An alright metal album from the 80's.  The guitar riffs are nice most of the time, and the way the songs are put together in a way that feels very progressive rock-ish really amazes me.  That kind of music was supposed to be outdated by the time the 80's rolled around.    The entire tone of the album feels like mid 80's Iron Maiden.  Sometimes the lead singer rubs me the wrong way with his \\"sing along lazily because it's time to throw in a verse melody\\" style.  However, that doesn't annoy me very often.  It sounds awkward at first and then you get used to it.  Even then, I can just ignore his more unmemorable lines and prepare myself for the better ones.      Not as good as Iron Maiden or Metallica, and it's not a classic by any means because it really just sounds like generic 80's rock to the extreme (with power vocals!) but for what it is, it's decent enough.  The album does kind of fail at the big bombastic sound and epic atmosphere that it's obviously going for.    The lyrics are supposed to be important and hold up by todays standards, but that's hardly enough reason to make an album an instant classic.  It just means whenever you hear a line you can either relate to or remember from a news story you heard last night, you go \\"Oh wow, those words speak the truth man!\\"     I'd say 3 stars out of 5 is just about right for a metal album that's a bit inconsistent, but has some good moments.

B00003CXPD|5.0|Truly touching and mesmerizing, this film extends past boundaries.  Though it is very much an adult-oriented film due to language, it offers a very in-depth look at coming of age in a poor mining corner of England.  Performances are touching and magical and the script couldn't be better. This is a movie you don't want to miss.  I won't go into any more depth than that because you truly need to experience this film for yourself.

0375842209|5.0|I love GOOD books, well-written books, love the classics and the Pulitzers. And, I have to say, that THIS book is an undiscovered work of art. I cannot believe that after all this time it is not on the Best-Sellers List, not discovered by Oprah or something like that. This book is a MASTERPIECE, and I do not throw that work around lightly when it comes to books.   Do not let the summary on the book jacket scare you away - it is not as glum as the description suggests. I think some people read the jacket and think \\"Too sad, too heavy.\\" Yes, this book has sad parts to it, but if you skip it because of the implied sadness, you are missing an excellent book! Get through the first 30 pages and you will find yourself in a deep and meaningful page-turner. It is beautiful and heartbreaking, simple and complex all at the same time. I laughed and cried tears of happiness. It is really a story of triumph, not of loss. It is a story that is important, that stays with you and lives in your heart. I read it for the first time a year ago, and just reread it again. It was just as poetic, just as gripping. Don't pass this book up. Not since I read To Kill A Mockingbird, have I read a book so important, so beautiful.
B0015D3Z4O|1.0|She's obviously gone over the edge with this one. I can see why she was on the cover of some stupid magazine for their \\"green issue\\".  Very organic-looking!  A few fries short of a happy meal.

0385751532|4.0|This book wowed me. I lived to see this horrifying event through the eyes of a 10-year-old. Going into this book, I thought I knew what was going to happen, but by the end I was very surprised at the turn of events. I think that anyone of any age, even if it looks like it is a younger kids book with larger print, but if you like the history of the holocaust and even if you know nothing about it, I think that you would find it enjoyable.
B000I0RNV6|5.0|This is an excellent Italian film which can tug at the heartstrings of even the most tough person there is, because of the way in which the story engrosses and immerses the viewer into the plot.  A great example of how a filmmaker(director) can tell a story with enough gusto to make the viewer to ask questions as well as to be satisfied in having watched it.
B000BJS4OY|5.0|You can't miss this one, even if it is for the excellent 90 minutes documentary. The album itself we all know, but a remastered version is always useful.<br /><br />The show at the Hammersmith Odeon, 1975, is also obligatory, since it's the only official DVD release of the E-Street Band up to 2000! (line-up here was classic The Boss, Bittan, Clarence, Van Zandt, Federici, Tallent e Weinberg). Yes, it's dark and all, but it's still has satisfactory quality e sound is amazing.<br /><br />The booklet also is very good, a work of art.<br /><br />All in all, you can't skip this one.
B000LPS4BG|5.0|The only problem I have with this Blu Ray movie is the fact that every single one of the discs that are shipped are incorrectly created.  There is a skipping that happens and I contacted the studio but all they do is ask you to mail in your copy & they'll send you another (BUT they DO NOT tell you if the skipping problem will be fixed upon receiving the newer Blu Ray.  Too bad because I would like to get rid of the skipping issue on my Blu Ray
B00140PK6O|2.0|The novel \\"Cranford\\"by Mrs. Gaskell is my favorite novel of all time.  I was so excited to learn they were filming a mini-series.  However, I was so disappointed because it is nothing like the book.  It certainly is \\"based\\"on the novel, in that some of the same characters in the book appear in the movie, but most of the plot was made up, including most of the main characters.  The book was so funny.  If you liked the movie, you should try the book, but be warned, it is completely different!

B00008MJ8H|5.0|One of my favorite movies. The full length version of this movie is the only good version, and it is one of the best movies ever produced. The music is haunting, the acting is splenldiferous and the story is fascinating. Robert Deniro's greatest perfomance.
B00005QAPH|5.0|Excellent Film by Fellini.  A bit of a break from Italian Neo-Realism, but it works and it must be seen numerous times in order to get further into the meaning of what he is projecting or attempting to get across to the audience.
1595478728|5.0|It's a whirlwind of provocative thought. Clever beyond any religious writer I know. A defense of his faith that could almost convince the faithless, and if not, at least it will entertain them.<br />I agree with the previous reviewer that it isn't to be studied. Chesterton mouths off with a flurry of defenses that may not always hold up under scrutiny, but that's part of why he's so enjoyable. He argues his point so passionately and furiously that it becomes fascinating and funny, and sometimes his defenses hold up so well under scrutiny that they change your view - he's gifted at pointing out the emptiness of popular arguments against the strength of the old ones.<br />Read the chapter on THE PARADOXES OF CHRISTIANITY and decide yourself.

1604591617|5.0|There are so many reviews here. I'll be brief.<br />I've read this book many times (though not this edition, which someone said is poorly formatted) and it's a whirlwind of provocative thought. Clever beyond what most any other writer can achieve. A defense of his faith that could almost convince the faithless, and if not, at least it will entertain them.<br />At least read the chapter on THE PARADOXES OF CHRISTIANITY. It's a kick, and could get you hooked on Chesterton if not on Orthodoxy.
B000002KIK|2.0|Black Sabbath's eighth studio album, Never Say Die!, was their first less than average album. It would be the last album that Ozzy Osbourne would record with them though he was no longer a member of the group. Never Say Die! peaked at #69 & that is a higher chart position than it deserved. \\"Junior's Eyes\\" is the only song that rises above average. \\"Breakout\\" is an instrumental but, unlike previous Sabbath instrumentals, it wasn't soft & it included horns. Very un-Sab like. There's little evidence to recommend this album. Bill Ward, the drummer, once again takes a turn as lead vocalist, this time it's \\"Swinging the Chain\\". I think on this song Ward did the vocals because Ozzy had had enough; this was the first time Ward did the vocals that wasn't a ballad.    It's sad that the Ozzy era of Black Sabbath ended on this note but he would more than redeem himself when he launched his solo career. Black Sabbath is now a member of the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame, a position they deserved & earned. I remember when this album was released & I knew that the cover was indicative that someone had quit. The front cover has two people dressed in flight uniforms with faces completely hid, the back cover has another person in a cockpit dressed the same way. At the time I didn't know that Ozzy had quit but it was clear that someone was gone. With little exception, we didn't have the sources of information, Billboard magazine & Rolling Stone magazine were exceptions.     It's hard to give a recommendation to buy this album; I've got it because I'm a completist, I wanted all the Sabbath albums that featured Ozzy Osbourne.
B0013HA838|5.0|A David McVicar production practically guarantees creativity and excitement and this maverick director's 2006 Royal Opera Figaro magnificently fulfills the bill. While it's true this Figaro has several innovations - updating the time to 1830s France, some men in top hats, servants all around (like in his Manon, eavesdropping), a strong emphasis on sexuality and the Count's violent nature - what truly makes the Figaro memorable is the synergy, the chemistry McVicar has brought out in the acting and vocalizing, and in the pit from conductor Anthony Pappano. This is simply the best of the half dozen DVDs I have seen of this masterpiece.     McVicar has displayed how successful he is in this regard in his compelling Rigoletto and Manon (I haven't seen his Magic Flute and Giulio Casare and I had mixed feelings about his Carmen). Here too, the ensemble, the interrelationships between characters, the personalities of the protagonists are so strongly etched. This is the most theatrical, physical, earthy Figaro I have ever seen.    In his notes to the DVD, McVicar downplays performers' emphasis in Figaro on \\"rococo charm,\\" but if not rococo, this production has no lack of charm when called for. And a Figaro without charm is not a complete Figaro. Conversely, McVicar's ample toughness and darkness are also appropriate, since the opera has many moments of seriousness, duplicity, mistaken identity, confusion and hearts being broken.    There are many moments to savor in this production, and McVicar's rethink of certain events is largely treasurable. The sarcasm between Susannah and Marcellina in Act one doesn't drip it flies, it pours. Delicious! Their interaction at the end of Act 2 I've never seen more powerfully done. The servants overhearing a good deal of the opera's proceedings lends a most interesting and appealing aspect to this mad day, a sense that the Count's time, his control, his power, are coming to an end. So too do the very noticeable blemishes on the walls of the Count's chamber, a wonderful touch as to the decay, the crumbling of his world.     Erwin Schrott is a dark and sensual Figaro, powerful and more rebellious when called for (Beaumarchais' play was indeed revolutionary) than any other I have seen, and he sings beautifully. Miah Persson cuts a lovely swath and brings out all the charm and strength of Susanna. Gerald Finley is a nasty, dominating Count, his baritone richly resplendent (interestingly, he looks a lot like Schubert here). Rinat Shaham's Cherubino is utterly compelling with both a kittenish charm and a masculine presence. These four command the stage yet interact superbly with the others.     The strong voiced Countess of Dorothea Roschmann has many lovely moments although on occasion her voice can become stressed and turn hooty. Philip Langridge's wildly creative and funny Basillio practically steals the show in Act 4, if his aria can ever do that (as the Witch in the Metropolitan Opera's simulcast of Hansel and Gretel, he also brought a wonderful daring and fun wickedness to that role). Jonathan Veira's voice is fine and his wonderfully bulging eyes have to be seen in Bartolo's Act 1 \\"la vendetta.\\"    Pappano brings out ample does of vitality and warmth in the pit from his Royal Opera forces, bending generously to his singers wishes when needed and giving a masterful interpretation. He is an ideal match for McVicar's creativity, his full-of-life production.    Act 4 is notoriously difficult to bring off totally, with characters in a garden supposedly being hidden and overhearing others without being seen. Few productions totally convey this and McVicar's doesn't entirely either. A few leaves falling and some trees don't establish a garden when there are indoor items - tables, chairs, partitions, still present on stage. This takes away from plausibility. But Jonathan Haswell's cameras do a good deal to alleviate this problem and make the interactions fairly secretive and compelling. The Jean-Pierre Ponnell/Karl Bohm film, not actually a very good Figaro, nonetheless has the best Act 4 scenery wise, with a full garden and appropriate hiding areas.    When I want to watch a Figaro now, I will turn to this performance. My previous favorites (1994 Glyndebourne with Haitink, Finley (as Figaro), Fleming and Hagley, and 1994 Lyon with Paolo Olmi, Furlanetto, Szymtka and Watson) are excellent but this takes precedence, for its theatricality, vision and superb acting and ensemble.
B000002KDS|5.0|Arguably, the band Alice Cooper, their best album. This album peaked at #21 on the charts & it had two singles released from it, \\"Be My Lover\\" (#49) & \\"Under My Wheels\\" (#59). These chart positions are not indicative of the quality of this album. At 8 songs, let's remember this was on vinyl, it's on the short side but every song here is exceptional. The aforementioned songs are excellent as are \\"Under My Wheels\\", \\"You Drive Me Nervous\\" & \\"Yeah, Yeah, Yeah\\". There's absolutely nothing wrong with the rest of the songs.<br /><br />Below is a listing of the songs as they appeared on vinyl:<br />  Side 1<br />  \\"Under My Wheels\\"<br />  \\"Be My Lover\\"<br />  \\"Halo of Flies\\"<br />  \\"Desperado\\"<br /><br />Side 2<br />  \\"You Drive Me Nervous\\"<br />  \\"Yeah, Yeah, Yeah\\"<br />  \\"Dead Babies\\"<br />  \\"Killer\\"<br /><br />I've listed these songs this way for a reason, I don't know if anyone has noticed (I'm sure SOMEBODY has) but these songs correspond by titles. If you compare the first song (& so forth) of side 1 to the first song of side 2 they have a certain similarity. The second song of each side is the biggest stretch for similarity but I let you figure that out. I don't know if it was intentional but it's there for all to see.<br /><br />Bob Ezrin was the producer & he had the Midas touch at this point in his career. He managed to get the band Alice Cooper to become a top charting act, he did the same for Alice Cooper the solo act, he produced the best album Kiss ever did, Destroyer, & then he began producing Pink Floyd albums, most notably The Wall. It should be noted that Ezrin also writes songs & is a musician.<br /><br />Without a doubt, this is the band Alice Cooper's best album. It's about as close as one can get to an essential album without being one. If I were to rate these songs on an individual basis, none would receive less than a four star rating. There isn't any filler on this album! This was a very tight band that could do a lot of different things & styles.um! This was a very tight band that could do a lot of different things & styles.
B0014KD46W|4.0|Winwood has graced us with another heart felt musical effort. Not necessarily his most exhilarating work. But a well-seasoned collection of really strong songs played with deft purposefulness. Subtle in its overall feel.  There are bluesey moments, retro RB touches and emotional progressions that feature that wonderful soulful voice. Very cool to hear Clapton playing on Dirty City.
B00133KFGW|1.0|If you just open yourself to the music, you can pick up a guitar for the first time and within two minutes be an expert.  And within a few weeks, you will not only know the definition of the word rhapsody, you will be conducting an orchestra representing Julliard in Central Park to perform a rhapsody YOU wrote for thousands of awed listeners.  If you have a gift, it really requires absolutely no work.  You will just be good automatically.  You writing this down kids?  Make sure you tell this to your teachers when you tell them you havent done your homework.  You are GIFTED...you dont need to do any work.  And you know what else?  If you are talented, good looking, cool, and perhaps have a little tortured soul thrown in, you can sit on a rooftop, meet a gorgeous female, tell her your name along with some ridiculously cheesy lines, and immediately have \\"marital relations\\" with her...and everything will turn out great in the end.  Great fun for the entire family!!!  Hooray!    So many disbelievable occurances happened in this farce of a film, but I think I should name one more.  Lyla's father signed away the baby, forging her name, which in itself is nearly impossible.  A doctor would have to witness her signing the papers.  But beyond that, does anyone realize how long the line is to adopt an infant in this country?  It's staggering.  So why was Evan still a ward of the state at 11 years of age?  Baloney...he would have been in the arms of a caring mother and father from day 1. Asking us to suspend our belief is one thing, but this film asked us to be idiots.    Oh, I must admit one of my shortcomings here. When Even (aka August)was fleeing from Wizard in the subway and his buddy, Arthur, yelled to him \\"Run August Run\\", I did not stand and immediately throw rotten food at the screen.  I really should have.    And if Freddy Highmore's agent is reading this....you should be fired for letting your client star in this joke of a film.  This film has \\"career killer\\" writtenall over it.  Kerri Russell is old enough to know better.  What was she thinking?

006135323X|5.0|I must say that I was not overly impressed with \\"Predictably Irrational\\"  at first. But when I reached the sections in which the author explains the value of honesty, the book really became interesting! Read the last three chapters, it would be well worth your time. \\"Predictably Irrational\\", is an easy read. I gave it five stars because I have not read an argument like Ariely's before. You have probably heard that 'honesty is the best policy'. Dan Ariely makes a good case for being honest! Being honest not because it is the morally correct choice, but because it is cost effective!
B0015GDVY0|5.0|This movie touched my heart as well as my daughters. This is my Harry Met Sally new, favorite, romantic film! Tommorrow is never promised to any of us and the fact that anyone would take time to write passionate letters while coping with terminal illness in itself is selfless! I ENJOYED THIS FILM TREMENDOUSLY!! I do feel Hillary looked a bit harsh for the character....- keep seeing her casting in \\"BOYS D0N'T CRY\\" but the storyline was in tact and the male character was sooh sexy!
B00005N6KG|4.0|I have owned many pairs of these.  They are simply the best, most comfortable headphones for exercising.  My only complaint is that the metal on the headphone plug gets corroded over time, and so I have to replace these every year or so.  Thankfully, they are so inexpensive.
B000002AD0|2.0|Oye. Okay, here we go. The acid-happy meanderings of Santana before their Woodstock breakthrough. See, what had made Santana good in the early days was their ability to make a jam compact, but there's no sense of that here. None of these songs run at logical lengths, and in fact most are excruciating. The half-hour \\"Freeway\\" is particularly bad. It just goes. And goes. And goes. Thirty minutes, one chord, probably because the group was too stoned to play a second. And that's what the rest of the album's like. Plus it features Carlos experimenting with quasi-metal tones (\\"Jingo\\"; \\"Persuasion\\") that fit him like a Latin tone would fit Toni Iommi. \\"Chunk a Funk\\", one of the many otherwise unreleased tunes here, is funky, but also crappy. Too much of it is devoted to Greg Rollie, who plays a very familiar chord sequence. But not even that could be as bad as, say, \\"Fried Neckbones\\" - an insignificant vamp with inconsequential lyrics and insipid playing. Even \\"Soul Sacrifice\\" sounds bad - the organ is more Steppenwolf than Santana. Carlos sounds timid during his solo as well. Check out the Woodstock version instead. There's also a long, generic blues (\\"As the Years Go Passing By\\") that's notable for two reasons: it doesn't really suck, and it more or less is \\"Since I've Been Loving You\\". Same introducing solo, same melody (though, in interest of fairness to Jimmy Page, it also has the same melody as \\"Going Down Slow\\" and a thousand other blues songs), similar chord progression (though, once again...). All it lacks is the huge emotional release that made \\"Since I've Been Loving You\\" good as it is. However, Carlos' playing on it is inspired, with him making the absolute best of the generic blues riffs he's shooting out. I mean, yeah, you've heard them a dozen times before. But Carlos injects them with a certain emotional freshness, as if that progression means everything to him. And that, in my mind, is guitar soloing. It's not an entirely good song, because the vocal passages are interminable, but compared to \\"Freeway\\"? We're dealing with divine quality here. With that said, any given Allman Brothers or Jimi Hendrix blues jam smokes it. I mean, you think this can compare to \\"Hear My Train a-Comin'\\" or \\"Stormy Monday\\"? Ha. So the remaining good song is \\"Treat\\", equipped with a fine jazzy piano solo and the kind of high-quality playing Santana was capable of, even during his drugged-out hippie moments. Santana's first five studio albums rule, and so does the (mostly) live Moonflower. That, in my mind, is much better Santana.ges are interminable, but compared to \\"Freeway\\"?

B00140PK6O|5.0|A series worth watching. Great period drama with great performances and all without steaming sex scenes.    Finally a great play where we finally can enjoy a story about a \\"little village\\" with all their problems, difficulties, death - but also triumph and change.    At last there is a movie where mature actresses/actors, like Judi Dench,Eileen Atkins and Michael Gambon can shine !!!    Wonderful job, BBC ! My copy of the DVD is on it's way...
B00000254Q|4.0|This represents the final throes of Santana's creative streak before he all but ran out, and chronologically speaking it's also his last pure studio album that's any good. Obviously the best song is the classic guitar solo \\"Europa (Earth's Cry Heaven's Smile)\\", a melodic, gorgeous, tear-jerking guitar solo. It takes the ideas presented on \\"Samba Pa' Ti\\", waaaay back from Abraxas, and brings them to their logical extent. As usual, it's Santana's playing alone that saves a lot of these songs - his lengthy solo on \\"Dance Sister Dance\\" lifts it from a mediocre but harmless MOR tune to something almost spiritual. But please, forget about the crappy \\"song half\\", and focus instead on the guitar solo. I do prefer the live version on Moonflower, though, since it shortens the crappy \\"song half\\" and removes the synthesized gloss accompanying the solo. The remaining five songs are considerably harder to recommend, though. \\"Gitano\\" is enjoyable but overlong salsa in Santana's usual style. \\"Let Me\\" is funky, but thin from a compositional standpoint. \\"Take Me With You\\" is flashy, but unimpressive. And then there are the two really bad songs. \\"Tell Me You are Tired\\" is the kind of thing that Journey may have been doing around the same time, and \\"Shine it On\\" (chosen, for inexplicable reasons, as a single - thankfully, it wasn't too big of a hit, peaking out in the lower regions of the Top 100) is disco morass. But the two classics and maybe \\"Gitano\\" are enough to bump the rating up. It definitely foreshadows the bad directions Santana would later take his music in, but taken as itself it's pretty good.

B000GFLAI0|5.0|This CD, lauded by critics, but I'm late to discover it.  I think it is the best work of Dylan's and a perfect culmination of where he was coming from to where he is going.  I'm a little late in catching up with his western gear, but in the vein of Waylon and Willie, he surpasses them all.
B000006E4C|5.0|What can I add to so many insightful 5-star reviews?    Just that this work has an astonishing, subtle, hypnotic beauty that remains fresh & revelatory after countless listens. Its deceptive simplicity constantly reveals new touches, and carries the enraptured listener to some transcendant place ... except that the word \\"listener\\" falls woefully short. This music isn't simply listened to, it's experienced at a very deep & dreamlike level, like a nebula of pure white light shot through with golden mist. And when I stop to contemplate the virtuosity of the musicians, I'm astonished all over again.    This might not be for every taste, but for those who are open to a visionary mode of being, this music is both gateway & voyage. Highly recommended!

B00005JLKB|5.0|I found this series to be a very entertaining and enjoyable show of the early days of Clark Kent before becoming the famous Superman.  I do have to say that the way they did the character of Lana Lang was a little annoying. My personal view of the shows Lana is she is superficial almost to the seventh season and I was always rooting for the character of Chloe to become Clark's true love in the show even though that never happened.  I thought the actors they got for the characters of the show were well done especially for Lex Luthor,Clark Kent,Martha Kent,John Kent,Chloe Sullivan,Lois Lane,Lionel Luthor,Peter Ross,and Lana Lang.  The setting they got for Smallville is also incredible it seemed exactly like the comic version of the town.  So I say to all fans of Superman if you like<br />to see the early years of his life in Smallville this series does the job<br />amazingly...
B0007LXPBI|5.0|Great remake of the original - with a few extra twists thrown in.  Was happy to purchase it for my collection.  If you liked the original, you will love this one.
0736063684|4.0|This book gets excellent reviews.  I guess I felt a little bit like the book was going to be different so that's why 4 instead of 5 stars.  For example, while the squat is covered, it really doesn't detail which muscles perform which activities and various points in the lift.  The squat is clearly the basis for most serious lifting programs, and I really could have used 10 pages to cover the various aspects (perhaps more).  I realize this isn't a technique book, but thought to some extent it was about showing you the anatomy during proper technique.  This is more of an anatomy book than something in the lifting category.  There are a few good 'side bar' type notes on various injuries which did provide useful information.  Also, there is no index and the book's organization is perhaps not as good as it could be.  Now I have an anatomical reference book on my bookshelf.
B0013V33DG|5.0|When I saw the \\"Live from the Met in HD\\" broadcast of La Fille du Regiment, I just couldn't wait to get it in DVD so I could share it with friends.<br /><br />Was I disappointed, was it an inferior production?<br />Definitely not!<br /><br />This DVD features the same brilliant singing and acting from Dessay, Florez, and the other principals, and the same costumes and sets.  It is simply the best Daughter of the Regiment I can imagine.  You won't believe the amount of energy, talent, and \\"bounce\\" that Natalie Dessay displays.  Please, you won't be disappointed!  Get it to share the fun and great singing with your friends.
B000002UAR|5.0|THIS IS A TRULY REMARKABLE ALBUM, FOR IT IS THE FOLLOW-UP TO RUBBER SOUL.  IN RUBBER SOUL YOU STARTED TO HEAR THE NEW SOUNDS THE BEATLES WERE CREATING, LEAVING A THIRST FOR MORE.  WITH REVOLVER, THE GROWTH OF NEW SOUNDS AND INSTRUMENTS IS BREATHTAKING.  THIS ALBUM COMPLETELY LET'S THE LISTENER KNOW THAT 1, THE FABS WERE ADVANCING MUSICALLY, MENTALLY, AND ARTISTICALLY.  THE START OF THE ALBUM, TAXMAN, SHOWS GEORGE COMING UP TO PAR WITH JOHN AND PAUL. THIS IS A FANTASTIC ROCK TUNE. AND AS USUAL, PAUL ALWAYS PLAYS AN INCREDIBLE BASS PART TO RIVAL GEORGE'S SONGWRITING ENDEAVORS! ELEANOR RIGBY, SUPERB! AS GEORGE HARRISON'S START TO SIMULATE US WITH HIS INDIAN LACED SONGS,  SUCH AS, LOVE YOU TO. JOHN FOCUSES ON HIS MENTAL STATE, YELLOW SUBMARINE COMES AS A KID'S TUNE TO BE SUNG IN GRADE SCHOOL,  A SONG FOR RINGO THAT'S NOT BAD.  DOCTOR ROBERT ROCKS OUT!PAUL CONTINUES HIS SONGWRITING WITH ADDING DIFFERENT INSTRUMENTS, MAINLY BRASS, AND THAT COMES OFF VERY WELL DONE.  ALL IN ALL REVOLVER IS A MUST FOR ANYBODY WHO WANTS TO FURTHER THEIR MUSICAL TASTE. WITH REVOLVER YOU REALIZE THAT SOMETHING OF THE MAGNITUDE OF SGT. PEPPER WOULD BE NEXT.
0763627410|5.0|Our boys (ages 2 and 4) love Maisy books and shows so we checked out this book from the library when we saw it.  They loved it so much we bought our own copy.  It is a big, hard cover book with big, bright, colorful pictures.  It is a happy fun read for them with lots to look at.  Great for bed time or any time.
B0013FNC38|5.0|I thought of an obscure 80s band called Haircut One Hundred and their album (the only one?) Pelican West when I first listened to WE SING, WE DANCE, WE STEAL THINGS. Jason Mraz's new CD is just plain great. I've been a pop music fan for over fifty years and hear so many influences here - or maybe I just think I do, I don't know. There are hinted-at elements of Paul Simon, Bob Marley, Bob Dylan and so many others here, and not a single clinker on the whole CD. Every track shines with something different - the sounds of reggae, literate white-boy rap, folk, Muscle Shoals kinda horns, jazz, gospel choirs ... My gosh! What DOESN'T Jason Mraz listen to and then make his own? It's difficult to pick favorites here, but I'm partial to \\"I'm Yours\\", \\"Lucky\\" (a steamy yet somehow \\"old\\" duet w/ another young favorite of mine, Colby Caillat), \\"Love for a Child\\" (trying to figure it all out), and \\"A Beautiful Mess\\" (about trying to figure out the \\"whys\\" of loving someone). Judas Priest, Jason - how're you ever gonna top this amazing collection?! But please try; I'll look forward to your next efforts. In the meantime, there's plenty here to keep me happy for now. - Tim Bazzett, author of the ReedCityBoy trilogy
B00000K3CR|5.0|This is a very enjoyable movie.  Done very well and as alwyas Tom Hanks delivers!
B0010YSD7M|5.0|At the end of the series the viewers were kept left hanging about what is going to happen with the Ori. This movie is a great finish leaving you satisfied that all is well with the world:-)  It was also nice to see the guys again who had somewhat become like family over the last 8 years.
1596680296|5.0|I haven't even been knitting for more than half a year and have never followed a pattern.  I got this book and am almost done knitting my second sock.  I've never even knitted in the round before!  If I can knit a sock, anybody can (using this book)!!!
0452289963|1.0|Valuable information but NEW AGE MATERIAL in my opinion...so readers,  particularly Christians, if you are really searching for purpose from the Christian perspective, without the influences of other nonChristian faiths, try reading, THE PURPOSE DRIVEN LIFE by Rick Warren. [[ASIN:0310276993 The Purpose Driven® Life: What on Earth Am I Here For? (Purpose Driven® Life, The)]]That book along with the HOLY BIBLE did it for me.
B000784WMW|4.0|Was very pleased to see a most accurate portrayal of the novel Jane Eyre.  The BBC has been most honest in their dramatization of their best novels.  The only difficulty with this video was the chapter breaks... they distracted from the continuety of the film.  Otherwise it was very well portrayed and would recommend to anyone who; as I do, prefers a more accurate portral of books read.
B00000J2PH|5.0|I can't figure out why I hadn't bought the CD version of this album until now. I had it on vinyl for years and finally got the CD so I can listen to it in my car. Now I remember why it was one of the all-time best selling albums of all time. Every song is a hit - great music by a great singer/songwriter. One of the best albums every doe and as relevant today as it was back when it was written.
B000LPQ6DE|5.0|This adaptation of Jane Eyre was the best I have viewed.  It was preferable to the most accurate version (BBC) as it was a continuous viewing; not broken by chapter viewing.  The characters were quite good in their representation of each character portrayed.  Would recomend this vidio over any of the others I have seen performed as the most enjoyable. ML
0143143492|5.0|I bought the CD set after reading the book because it is the kind of book you need to listen to (or read) again & again. I find his voice very soothing and relaxing, though my daughter finds his German accent distracting. Very inexpensive considering what books on CD usually go for. I plan on buying one for several friends this coming Christmas.
B000002KKS|5.0|I just purchased this CD since I am trying to backfill my lost record collection of eons ago, and I read a lot of the reviews for it with interest after listening to it again and again (again and again, and again! - a little Neon Knights lingo there!) over the weekend.  I think everyone pretty much has covered the bases, but I have just been so surprised by my own reaction I wanted to write a little:    I think the other reviewers did a good job of breaking down individual tracks, but in general I would just like to say that the musicianship on this album is just stunning after listening to it 28 years later!  It still sounds as crisp and fresh as ever!  I remember being blown away when it was first released when I was still in High School, but looking back at it through the prism of time it was more than just a good album; it was an epochal shift for Black Sabbath. Geezer's bass playing is superb, Tony Iomni is masterful, Bill Ward's playing is great (I remember hearing an interview with Bill Ward where he claimed he was so out of it during the recording of Heaven and Hell that he didn't even remember it;  I find that hard to believe!), and of course what can you say about RJD?  He has a set of pipes that most Rock singers would kill for and he is a perfect frontman for Black Sabbath.  I hate to say it, but after listening to this again Ozzy almost seems buffoonish.  The level of professionalism is just light years beyond what Ozzy ever could deliver, and don't get me wrong because I have every single Black Sabbath release.  Dio just brings a dimension into this album that propels it to the top of the list of all time metal classics!  Ozzy was losing it over the last 2 albums and it was pretty apparent;  the addition of RJD breathed fresh life into Sabbath and the energy is infectious on this album.  Even though I don't believe Bill Ward when he says he \\"doesn't remember\\" the recording of Heaven and Hell, it was apparent that he had problems since this was the lastalbum he recorded with the new incarnation of Black Sabbath.   That's too bad because I think he was a great drummer, but his fill-in Vinnie Appice was a great choice, too.  I still think, though that this lineup (with Ward), if it could have worked, was possibly the best incarnation of Black Sabbath.       I can't believe I waited so long to revisit this metal classic!
B00003CXCT|5.0|This is only the 3 first movies, I mean, the IV, V and VI episodes, but it's a must have collection!
B000Q9IZ5C|5.0|If you like Sci-Fi, be sure to check out this movie. It is a must-have for all sci-fi lovers, and for many who maybe aren't into sci-fi. It has enjoyable elements for every crowd in it. If you have seen this movie and enjoyed it, be sure to see the fourteen episodes of Firefly, the tv show this was based on. If you have seen Firefly and liked it, then you will like this movie as well.
0446402389|5.0|\\"Child 44\\", first novel by Tom Rob Smith, had me so gripped that the 30 minutes on the stationary bike at the gym felt like only 5. What a fascinating thriller set in 1950s Stalin's USSR where just because you are paranoid doesn't mean that they AREN'T out to get you.  Neighbors denounce neighbors, friends denounce friends...husbands can have their wives execute with just a veiled accusation.  It's bleak.<br /><br />Stalin has dictated that crimes are only committed in Capitalistic societies, (he \\"reasons\\" that the equality of Communism precludes all theft, rape and murder). So when the naked, brutalized, and obviously murdered bodies of children start popping up, the authorities must hush it up because this kind of thing just isn't supposed to happen there.  No one can be warned because no one can know.<br /><br />Smith's portrait of the repressive and deadly culture of post-war Russia is thoroughly chilling...and yet you can't wait to get to the next page...the next chapter.  In this \\"guilty until proven guilty\\" world, cruelty is viewed as a valuable art form; torture is an effective and handy tool.  Smith vividly shows us the devastation of humanity that comes with a brutal dictatorship and the lie that is Communism. (In my opinion, this novel should be required reading by every young person sporting a \\"Che\\" t-shirt.)<br /><br />This novel is eye-opening, suspenseful and thoroughly satisfying.  I'll bet it's going to be a movie!
B000OVLBGC|5.0|What a wonderful film! Direction is so precise; the story takes surprise turns, and the ending makes you cry. I did not believe this movie would affect me this much. Moreover, art direction is superb. Characters are portrayed as REAL people, by gifted actors. I liked the language being German with subtitles. German movies with actors speaking English are totally phony. I'm glad Hollywood didn't make this film.
B000UNYJXQ|5.0|I know that this film will automatically turn a lot of potential viewers off because of the name Michael Moore. Well, I for one never really paid much attention to him or his films so I can say I watched Sicko with a reasonably objective mind.<br /><br />Needless to say there isn't anything that other reviewers haven't said already...the film is EXCELLENT, compelling, and it already reinforced my opinion on the concept of insurance companies in general....it is not in their best interest to pay out claims in order to show a profit so why should we be surprised at how our healthcare system had corroded to such an extend?<br /><br />Despite my well-developed sense of cynicism, I was till quite shocked, moved, and ultimately, ENRAGED at how the un-insured, and even the INSURED are treated here in America.<br /><br />Other developed countries have universal healthcare, but it comes with the price tag of having taxes up the yazoo (NOTHING is free). But people lives without the burden of fearing about the ramifications of being ill, somthing that you often can't control or anticipate. When you hear all this talk about Family Values and Pro-life in America....choosing money and profit over human life is anything BUT.<br /><br />I wouldn't say everything in the film is that accurate. For example the red carpet was rolled out in Cuba for Moore and company because of the presence of a film camera, and I doubt everything in France and Canada is as sweet and peachy (but definitely better. WAY better). But the evidence Moore piled up is so high that even if only 25% of what he says is true, we should be rioting in the streets.<br /><br />Anyone who would say that Moore's film is a piece of leftist propaganda needs to have their heads examined, or are one of these blood-sucking vampires making profts of the sick and dying.
B00005JOA0|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed and can highly recommend this film to anyone who likes BBC period films. Let me preface by saying that this is not Jane Austen but Anne Bronte so it does not contain the usual whimsical characters bantering back and forth with witty repartee. This film is dark and somber and very chilling, however, the stellar cast and the storyline will draw you in and keep you enthralled until the final conclusion. How can you pass up any film that stars Tara Fitzgerald, Rupert Graves (who as another reviewer notes: stole the show) and Toby Stephens. It is a story of love, betrayal, depravity, guilt and absolution.
B000Y1ZXUM|5.0|Great Blu-ray good sound, cristal clear image, and she looks great!!!!!!! lots of extras and a cd bonus with all the tracks from the concert.    Very good, great show.
B0015D3Z4O|3.0|I, for one, have always given applause to innovation. As a contemporary artist, Madonna had, up to \\"Music\\" ( 2000)  consistently delivered a product that moved beyond its predecessor, or to the side of it, or.... well, in  some different direction. She, to many, was the ultimate crass commercial artist, exploiting her audience, and, more importantly, herself. Not so. Madonna had always, respectably or not,  employed a calculated method to marketing her product... she has always known that  no matter the musical adventure, sex sells.<br /><br />At forty years young, Madonna proved she could reach out to the youth culture while giving more mature fans something to chew on with the aforementioned \\" Music\\". That ability has been in a downward spiral ever since.<br /><br />There are a few likeable tracks on this offering, \\" She's Not Me\\" and \\"Heartbeat\\" ( IMHO) being two of them. However, Madge has clearly become a victim of her advanced age, allowing younger \\" hot-shots\\" the opportunity to reinvent her in unattractive ways. The stalwart of Madonna's winding, interesting career has always had her instincts at the center. Obviously, she now doubts, or perhaps completely  distrusts, her instincts, instead handing over her creative license to those who can make her sound \\"fresh\\". The tragedy here is the former  Madonna set the course for what was trendy, with others following her. The newer version is turning herself over to image makers, completely betraying her original appeal.<br /><br />It might not matter anymore. Maybe she's fulfilling her obligation to the company store. She has more than enough money, that couldn't be her motive. In other words, she's no longer hungry, and it shows. This gets three stars because it is campy enough to warrant a spot on the 2008 summer bubblegum list, but the other two stars are ommited, due to the loss of \\"creative\\" Madonna, a spirit who probably lurks, if its owner cared to excavate it.
B000002GXX|5.0|Another great album from the Eagles. I strongly suggest that if you like the Eagles, this is one of their better Albums

B0010YSD7M|5.0|It's a good movie...  If you were left hanging after the last episode, then spend the $$$ and get this DVD...  Nothing bad about it at all...
B000RG1FMO|5.0|Kanye is perhaps the only person in music who matters. Why is that? On \\"Graduation\\" he not only has something to say but he also gets his point across lyrically, poetically, artistically and brilliantly. The man is a genius disguised as an artist. Kanye reminds me of a young Stevie Wonder because his songs have so much life and passion. I hope he never stops and I hope he only gets bigger and bigger because Kanye is just what we need. IMO he should run for president. But he's probably too smart for that job.
B00078XGRO|4.0|Another of my \\"retro-reviews\\",\\"Star Trek:First Contact\\" is by far and away the best of the new generation movies made.<br />The movie sets the mood and pace almost right from the get go.The Earth is being assaulted by a Borg cube ship but the Enterprise is told to stand down and is sent to a remote section of the quadrant to do some star mapping.This step has been apparently taken by the Earth governing hierarchy due to Picards' assimilation by the Borg years before.<br />The battle is listened to closely by the bridge crew and all is not going well.When Picard cannot take anymore he hurries back to Earth to help.They arrive in the nick of time and help to destroy the cube ship.But a Borg escape pod gets away and hurls earthward.The Enterprise pursues and goes through the same time portal the escape pod creates.They are taken back to the year 2063 and it seems the Borg are here to stop Zephram Cochran(inventor of warp drive)from taking his first flight(due to be the next day) and conquer Earth itself;to change the future for their own purposes.<br />The Enterprise closes in on the pod which is firing Earthward and destroys it.Unbeknownst to the crew though,a party of Borg transported aboard the ship,seconds before its' destruction.The Enterprise crew lands on Earth and meets the warp drive inventor and assists him in every way possible so he makes the all important flight.Besides the flight being a first test for warp drive it will also lead to a first contact situation with intelligent alien life which in turn will lead the Earth on its' path towards permanent space exploration.<br />During all this time with Cochran the crew slowly realizes and starts to come to grips with the Borg threat aboard the Enterprise.<br />Several crew members are taken hostage and assimilated including Data.Picard eventually gives himself to the Borg who are lead by a queen.<br />It's touch and go but Picard with Data's help,eventually defeats the queen and her coterie.The ship is saved from destruction and Cochrans' historic flight takes place as it should with the positive resultant effects.<br />The movie rarely stops for a moment as the pace is relentless and it keeps you focused all the time.All of the new gen crew are there who do a good job playing the characters to a tee from the TV show and even DS9 is given a nod as Worf comes aboard after having lead an almost fatal attack against the Borg on the Defiant.The queen Borg is played by Alice Krige who gives a great performance with just the right amount of omnipotence and menace coupled with a good measure of faux sincerity in her voice and body language.<br />There are some very minor drawbacks here and there in this film.The biggest one however is Zephram Cochran himself.Anyone in the least familiar with Star Trek,and the original series in particular,knows  about Cochran.Captain Kirk met Cochran on a far away planet in one of the better known eps.There are slight differences in detail from the Cochran of Picard and the one of Kirk.Not the least of which being their physical appearances and mannerisms.There is very little if anything one can match up between the two actors or their characters,only that we are supposed to believe that they are one and the same Cochran.The writers knew they were taking a chance with this aspect and while over-all plot wise it works,with me there's always that thing in my head that keeps saying:\\"No,these are just NOT the same people\\".And that always creates that \\"bump\\" in an otherwise smooth ride.<br />Technically the print is crisp and clear and the transfer was very good.The two disc set here has alot of features to offer and should satisfy all the Trek fans.<br />In conclusion this is overall a really good movie and a worthy entry in the Star Trek cannon.Its' plot is quick and well thought out and the acting is spot on throughout and Ms.Kriges' performance as a Borg queen is a standout.If your a Star Trek fan this movie deserves a spot on your shelf.It'sjust too bad the follow ups to this didn't come close in script and execution.'t come close in script and execution.
B000002L68|5.0|\\"Purple Rain\\" is my very favorite Prince CD. I still listen to it often because it doesn't sound dated or old or boring at all. I also like \\"Purple Rain\\" because it totally doesn't sound like a typical soundtrack, especially a soundtrack from the 80'. My favorite song is \\"When Doves Cry.\\" Such an illustrious song, and a great CD. Growing up I was a huge fan of Prince and Michael Jackson. The differences between Michael and Prince were very subtle; almost like the differences between \\"The Adams Family\\" and \\"The Munsters.\\" No one in the whole universe will ever compare.
0525950079|5.0|I wouldn't have imagined that Ken Follet could enthrall me any more than he did with \\"The Pillars of the Earth.\\" He certainly did just that with \\"World Without End.\\" It was a sad day for me when I turned the last page. Now I'm waiting impatiently for the next two hundred years of Kingsbridge history. I admit to being a history buff, but I'd never experienced such remarkable history lessons woven into stories like these.
B00139W3NE|2.0|\\"The Golden Compass\\" tries very, very hard to appeal to an adult audience with clumsy attempts at moralization and championing freedom of thought, but it can't seem to get over it's own childish nature and become a movie worth watching.  Considering the stink made by religious groups, one would think this was a blatantly anti-religion film.  It is not.  Anyone who says so likely has not seen it and therefore should have no opinion on it.  What the \\"The Golden Compass\\" IS is an anti-establishment rebellion against authoratative theocracy based on suppression of dissenting opinions.  This, naturally, would make the Catholic Church nervous since they have fostered more bad will on this planet than Bush/Cheney, Kim Jong-Il, and Bin Ladin put together.  I've also heard that the film's villains, an organization known as The Magisterium, represents Catholicism.  Funny, The Magisterium never does anything in this film as blatantly evil as The Inquisition so if what they say is true, I'd say organized religion got off lightly.<br /><br />I decided to set the record straight on this film after reading Roger Ebert's embarrassing gushings about it.  And I am myself a master of the gush so it takes a lot to embarrass me.  Let's just say he places it above [[ASIN:B000654ZK0 The Lord of the Rings]], [[ASIN:B000E8M0VA The Chronicles of Narnia]], AND [[ASIN:B000W4B8NC Harry Potter]]] on the fantasy genre.  The man has committed his share of film atrocites, but this ranks even above his razing of [[ASIN:B000UJ48T0 A Clockwork Orange]] on the \\"you-get-paid-for-this?!\\" scale of mainstream reviewer gaffes.<br /><br />But first, the good.  The film looks great, has at least one great and surprisingly violent moment, and at least attempts to delve into deep metaphors that most fantasy films wouldn't even touch.  The daemons (pronouced like \\"demons\\" but spelled in the old english way that meant \\"spirits\\" before the meaning and spelling were corrupted) are a great device.  Each human's spirit accompanies them in the form of an animal which can change shape (like a child's mind and personality) during a person's formative years before settling on one form later in life.  That is where the good ends because ,unfortunately, the animals talk.  At least the heroine's does, and good god is he annoying.  Thus the fantastic metaphor is reduced to a yammering ferret most of the time that reminds you every minute or so that you are watching a children's movie.<br /><br />Now the rest of the bad. The film's overall message is a good one, but the execution of the story is atrocious.  The dialogue is a constant irritation.  Original author Phillip Pullman obviously does not have the mastery of language that Tolkien, Lewis, and even Rowling displayed with such ease.  The fantasy masters create entire languages all their own that roll off the tongue and are fun to read and speak.  \\"The Golden Compass\\" throws words like \\"alethiometer\\", \\"gobblers\\", and \\"dust\\" around.  Why call the golden compass an alethiometer?  Obnoxious pseudo-intellectualism, the same type that forces a word like \\"daemon\\" -whose original meaning is dead, buried, and replaced- down our throats when any of a hundred others would have been wiser.  What is dust?  They don't really say and most of the characters don't know but apparently it connects worlds together and is talked about incessantly as if it is super-important. [snore] Are gobblers killer turkeys or something; I mean, we're supposed to be afraid of them, right?  No, they aren't turkeys and yes they are meant to sound menacing; but is \\"gobblers\\" really the scariest thing they could have called the Magisterium's child kidnapping squad?  Why not just call Gyptians gypsies?  Did Pullman just touch a globe and remove the first vowel in the name of the country he landed on to come up with that?  I could go on, but I'll stop now.  No, one more.  After hearing almost everbody talk in perfect king's english the whole movie I wasn't about to cheerfor a little girl shouting \\"he ain't nuthin'\\" to her polar bear (oh, I'm sorry, ICE bear) friend about to fight for their lives like she was 50 Cent.  And can somebody tell me why there's a COWBOY in this movie?<br /><br />Naturally, every character and group comes together suddenly with no premable for a big epic battle at the end.  Not really sure why most of the people were there, but I'll assume it was to fight evil.  And why is The Magisterium so evil?  Sure there's the power and all that, but Nicole Kidman's character seems to have no motive whatsoever.  She just scowls around the place trying to look evil with all her icy-hotness and then looks even more evil when she smiles.  Nice trick, but what's really in it for her?  The Compass scenes were cool the first few times, but then we're shown it again and again and again and I'm over it.  And what exactly is all this leading up to?  Tune in next time and hope it makes sense!<br /><br />Obviously, this is a shot at a big money franchise, but it falls way short.  I am not that guy that hated the first LOTR film, rushed to the midnight showing of the second, hated it, and waited in line overnight to catch the third and am still talking about how much those movies sucked.  You get one shot with me and if you miss, I'm out.  This movie cribs from the best of them but falls far short of any attempt at a cohesive story, a believable world, likeable characters, or even any outstanding action scenes.  It is beyond ridiculous and I was embarrassed when my wife (a Potter fantatic) walked in on me watching it.  Seriously. The religious protesters need to sit the hell down and stop behaving like over-the-top villains if they want to stop being compared to them and Roger Ebert needs to get a real job. This is one project that is not worthy of anybody's attention.  The kids may enjoy it, but anybody intelligent enough to comprehend the depth this film tries so hard to achieve will likely be put off from this series permanently by the clumsy and amateurish execution and childish language.  Anyone who says otherwise is likely doing so to spite the aforementioned religious nuts.  I say there are plenty of ways to do that without stooping to defending a third rate B-movie in bloated big-budget clothing.

0143038419|4.0|I thought it was an entertaining read and should be bought for that alone.  I thought Italy was hilarious, India was a struggle and a bore and Indonesia redeemed itself, though Italy was still the best section. I laught at all the haters out there who are just jealous of her travels and complain that she is self centered (I agree a bit) but if you hate that, then DO NOT read a memoir!!! If you too, are unhappy in your life, then do something drastic to change it and do not use your kids as an excuse!  Most will enjoy this book if they just would not take it so seriously and just read with no abandon. I also agree that her getting her \\"advance\\" by the publisher, which gave her the ability to travel abroad and write this book, makes it seem not so sincere and is kind of disconcerting but it is her job and you need to take it with a grain of salt. Overall, it was a fun book and whether good or bad, it still made you have a strong reaction and made Elizabeth rich in the process! Shame on those who were suckered by Oprah's Book Club and expected more than it was. Ha! Ha!
B000LE16VW|5.0|Great movie I purchased it to add it to my collection. Got it at a great price too.
B0019I6WDG|4.0|Juno - released through Fox Searchlight Pictures. Available now from all major media download sites and everywhere else on DVD. What else can I say about this film - another than it is extremely cute. OK, let us more clearly examine the definition of \\"cute\\". Cute is;<br /><br />Adjective<br />1. appealing or attractive<br />2. Informal clever or shrewd [from acute]<br /><br />For the movie Juno - all of the above (and more) apply! Starring the formidable Ellen Page (we shall monitor her career with interest) as the smart, brash - but still only 16, Juno.<br /><br />Juno is subtle in it's reflection of the perennial social issues, from abortion to the McDonald's style of legal services delivery. A cool detachment to the issues of the day, while simultaneously sending a message of freedom and liberation. Noticeably absent is any use of a cell phone, hearkening back to a time when the telephone prop was used sparingly and sometimes central to the telling of the story. Juno and her post pubescent friends are characterized as MySpace profiles figuratively (and literally) wallpapered on the bedroom walls. With only scant reference to current fashion or trends, this film takes on the aura of a simple country story, lay-ed out across an urban landscape - with emphasis on strong character development.<br /><br />The \\"right-wing\\" crowd may frown at apparent treatment of liberal causes as \\"oh natural\\" rather than the highly divisors and far from the end of formal debate issues that they are. For those who enjoy smart story telling, with a moderate dose of affection for the past - Juno will leave an endearing memory and warm your heart.[[ASIN:B0014GVCI8 Juno]]
