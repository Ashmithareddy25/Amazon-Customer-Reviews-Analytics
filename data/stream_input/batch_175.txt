B0095YY7RY|5|I had been swaddling my baby and she was sleeping in the Rock 'N Play. Around three months, she started to seem uncomfortable in the Rock 'N Play and I realized she needed to transition to the crib. However, I couldn't use the swaddle in the crib because she was beginning to roll over. This Sleepsuit saved the day! I literally transitioned her from the Rock 'N Play/swaddle combo to the crib and the Sleepsuit on the same night. She slept great with no problems. We live in a hot climate but I had no issues with her overheating.
B00009VE5O|5|This product is wonderful!!!!  My daughter was born Sept 2003, and I was using the bulky blakets and found them to be a hassle.  So I went looking through the 100's of car seat covers and found this one to be exactly what I was lookig for.  She says warm and cozy and loves being in it.  And I love not having to have her little body wrapped in layers and layers of clothing to were she cant even move.  I highly recommend this to everyone!
B002O06IHS|2|This item had missing accesories and came in dirty, with a big crayon mark. I returned it the second day.
B00CQAEIXW|5|Good for use in potty training boys who go slot at night and one pull up isn't enough.  These are a nice alternative.
B000056JH3|4|this product us a good divider, my babies are very small so don't really aknow about it
B000BPNAKQ|4|Very comfortable.  Takes up an awful lot of room, so for a couple, it would be tough with less than a queen or king size mattress.  Drawback:  the pillowcases are really expensive.
B00E3FUHUG|5|Great adaptive device for Special Needs people.
B002EIS58U|5|This is my 4.5 month's old favorite toy. The little beads in the ring and the additional attachments catch her eye on a daily basis. It's her favorite (as well as the Grouchy Ladybug plush) and she likes it so much, I'm thinking of re-decorating her room in an Eric Carle theme. :)
B007CTPWYQ|3|We got this stroller when my first child was born. It was great for the first 4 months. Then things started breaking on it-first it was the wheel button on the base, then the seat buckle broke, then the foot adjustment button broke, and a few other parts. Britax replaced the broken pieces each time, but after only having it a year, we are working on our 2nd base and our 3rd seat. I haven't used it since getting the third seat and I am almost afraid to use it. I just purchased a City Select and will be selling the Britax. Though I haven't paid anything for the replacements, it is really frustrating having to get replacements every couple of months.
B00WQNOKK0|5|I purchased the Nabance Travel Bag for Baby Strollers so that I can protect my stroller when I'm traveling by car or by plane.  The material is a sturdy fabric that doesn't feel like it is going to rip right through if it happens to be handled roughly by the airline.  I like that the bag it comes in is actually art of the stroller bag itself so there really isn't one that you could lose.  The bag folds down into a very compact pouch which is easy to bring along in your luggage, fold down to your carry on or store easily when not in use.  The top of the bag has a draw string for easy closure.  It also has a thick nylon handle for easy carrying.  I especially like that I can bring this along and if my stroller gets muddy and I don't want to get the mud in my car after a long day out, I can put the stroller inside the bag and the wheels will not get the back of my car all dirty.  I received this product for free in exchange for my honest, unbiased review.
B00175ROGU|5|My son, age 14, was chewing on pens and chewing off the eraser tops of pencils. This is an excellent, safer alternative.
B005X3MNV8|5|I ordered this for my baby gals first b'day. Not only my guests but my baby loved it.... It gave our room a stunning look and left an amazing feeling.<br />Peeled off easily without damaging the walls.Would definitely recommend.
B004AND668|5|This is a great stroller.  It is well constructed and designed and I have to admit that I love the fun green color!  I think that Aprica is definitely one of the lead producers of strollers and this product is in line with that reputation.  The main disadvantage of this stroller is that it can be a little confusing and challenging to open and close, but I really think that was by design.  There have been so many accidents related to strollers in recent years that this forces you to slow down...thereby reducing the risk of injury.  All in all, I really do not think that you can go wrong with this stroller...great product design and quality
B00171WXII|4|I truly love this product for the ease of cleaning it and to be able to see how much snot I'm getting out of my baby's nose. It does exactly what it shows on the box and the filter keeps everything sanitary. Unfortunately, my child screams and cries every time I use it. However, he doesn't like the aspirator either, so if he's going to cry either way, this is by far my preferred choice.
B002M77N22|5|I had never seen these before until it was given to me for baby shower and my newborn who is now 3 wks is practically sleeping through the night in it. He a absolutely loves it and highly recommend it!!!
B00KZTY8N6|4|Delivered on time!  Products are well made!  Very good size!
B0038JDAJ8|5|Love this teether.
B004CSOT1C|4|I love, love, love bumGenius diapers.  And the artist series diapers are super cute.  The only problem I've had with these is that if my daughter wears them at night, because she sleeps for quite a while before she will wake up wanting her diaper changed, that there can be some leaking from the back of the diaper where the \\"Chelsea Perry\\" tag is sewn on because the stitching goes through the plastic-y lining on the inside of the diaper.  I just use these during the day when I know that the diapers won't be getting too full and use my regular bumGenius diapers for nighttime.
B001EQ66WK|5|This bed cost less than half of the version we looked at from One Step Ahead!  It is great!  We probably didn't need to buy the &#34;protector&#34;, but it was nice to buy the sheet that went with it.  Our son kept calling it his &#34;bounce house bed&#34; and was more than happy to climb right in.  Great buy and super easy for travel and set up!
B006Y4H37O|3|there are only two adjustable heights which is a shame as it means that our baby wont get as much use out of it compared to some of the other walkers on the market
B00KWVCF2S|1|This net was a terrible purchase. It came with a hole in it and the hoop was broken and the material sticks to everything so you need to wear gloves when handling it or else it will snag easily. I was trying to get an inexpensive canopy to make a princess bed for my daughter but in this case, I most certainly got what I paid for-I am just going to save up for the high quality pottery barn kids one and not settle for a knock off version. Good luck.
B0038W0JJ4|5|I originally bought this seat only for use in our convertible, but now I plan to replace all our regular booster seats to the Britax Frontier!
B0033B9CZ2|5|These tubes work great and are a must because the tubes for the Pump in Style tend to end up full of old milk condensation...kinda gross and probably not terribly sanitary, so these are well worth the price.
B00FROCX7W|3|It has great organization but it didn't fit around the headrest as expected; the straps weren't long enough.
B003DQE7SE|5|It was a baby gift. They loved it
B00GWZURT6|5|I found these swaddles to be a great quality that hold up well with washings.  It is suggested to wash a few times right away because the more you wash, the softer they get.  I started with 2 immediate washing and then drying cycles.  There was definitely a noticeable difference.  I'm hoping they will continue to get even softer with additional washings.  Our son is now 19 months old so we use these to cover him at night because they are lightweight and breathable.  I feel safer using our Lambie & Me Swaddles to cover him as opposed to a heavier blanket that may get in his air way.  *I received a sample in exchange for an honest blog post.
B0002ZOI92|4|We bought this when our daughter was three months old and we were moving across the country.  It folds up flat and took up hardly any space in the car and she slept in it each night in the hotel.  I love that the baby is fully reclined - this would have been perfect for naps when she was a newborn!   <br /> <br />However, now that she's six months old she gets mad that she can't sit up in it so it's losing its appeal.  She loves pulling on the toys to make the music and lights go off.  The only thing I can truly complain about is that the batteries seem to wear out pretty quickly and they're expensive to keep replacing.  Other than that it's a wonderful swing.
B004K38FNM|5|I REALLY NEEDED A MATTRESS FOR MY DAUGHTERS PACK-N-PLAY BECAUSE WE WERE GOING ON A TRIP AND I WANTED HER TO BE COMFORTABLE.  I READ SEVERAL REVIEWS AND LOOKED AT SEVERAL MATTRESSES BUT DECIDED TO BUY THIS ONE DUE TO THE FACT THAT ACROSS THE BOARD IT HAD THE BEST REVIEWS.  I WAS NOT DISAPOINTED! I HAVE A INGENUITY PAK N PLAY AND WASN'T SURE IF IT WOULD FIT, BUT IT FIT LIKE A GLOVE.  IT WAS A LITTLE MORE EXPENSIVE BUT WELL WORTH THE EXTRA MONEY BECAUSE OF THE QUAILTY.  I WILL BE ABLE TO USE IT FOR THE NEXT BABY AS WELL.  THE BONUS WAS THAT IT FOLDED AND I COULD TRAVEL WITH IT ON A PLANE WHICH NO OTHER MATTRESS CAN DO.
B00857SS6S|4|These little membranes, which are so expensive from Medela, are a bit of a better deal here. These membranes need to be replaced at least every few months, if not more often. For moms that have multiple pump sets for work or exclusive pumping, buying membranes can get expensive! I save with these, and have not had any issues with quality or durability. If you can save a little on expensive pump parts, do it!
B0054Z0EPC|5|its a great product, i have a 60 inch tv and i have nieces and nephews so i didnt wanna risk them getting hurt when they come over so i got this! its awesome my tv doesnt move at all. very safe and came in quick!!! must buy:)
B001OC5UNA|4|This gate works great.  It was a little tricky when my husband and I installed the gate but we finally got it all figured out.
B0006Q561Q|5|I got these to set up multiple sets for pumping because I despise washing pump parts 24/7. These came in a package marked with Medela's info just like you would buy Babies R Us.
B005670SMC|1|our bathroom cabinets don't have a knob so we had to figure out how to babyproof our cabinets from our very curious toddler.  I thought this was a great idea but the adhesive lasted 3 months.  Also, it's difficult to re-latch or put on (and sometimes even take off) so half the time I don't even bother to lock it.  You have to put down hard and have to get it &#34;just right&#34; to latch it.<br /><br />The Safety 1st adjustable multi purpose latches work so much better and easier to latch/lock and unlock.  Our toddler can't open the Safety 1st ones either.  this is the one we use now:  http://www.amazon.com/Safety-1st-Adjustable-Multi-Purpose/dp/B00347GGJU/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1399489739&sr=8-1&keywords=safety+1st+multi-purpose+latch+-+2+pack<br />(which you can get at Target for $4.99 (2pk); here on Amazon it's $7.99 for 2pk).
B009M640VI|5|This is perfect. It is very easy to clean and fits my grandson perfect.
B00EBGSABA|5|Love this bag
B001W039YG|3|My daughter loves mickey mouse!  However, with normal handwashing the print on the fork has worn off.
B00389VFH2|4|They are refills, they work, I like them. Do they hold as much as they tout? Probably not, but I've never counted. They are slightly scented to help abate not so great smells that get put in them.
B00I9IFSIO|4|Great wash-clothes, they are not flimsy. I recommend for baby to adult. I also use them for myself; wonderful for facials.
B00AA6LQDY|3|It's really small, for the same price or cheaper you can get a regular size chopper.
B00ITHWC3Y|3|Great baby gift
B006BHSAB2|5|Love these!
B00G3SDMK8|5|good, solid bright
B00IOQDANQ|5|I am satisfied with these reusable, washable and waterproof cover diapers.
B001EPJ5GA|5|My niece loved it. Exactly as requested.
B004OR1DTC|5|Very nice dryer and the cuteness is even better
B00SJ7SLU2|5|I bought this for my niece and she absolutely loves it.  In fact she doesn't want to drink out of anything else.  The quality is good and the strap is super helpful.  Not sure what else to say.
B0058LCD1A|5|I purchased this item which was not on a friends baby shower registry, however she loved it!  It's an adorable idea for a gift, and everyone will 'awwww' when it's opened.
B009TO9VJY|1|they are really small unable to pin diapers closed
B00F2MQ0GO|5|I had concerns buying this based on some of the negative reviews, but I have been very happy with it.  It is sturdy and the front guard is well-positioned for a boy.  The top red-colored ring and white pan remove for easy dumping and cleaning.  The train noises come from a speaker underneath and can be turned on or off.  The first time that my son used it he was surprised by the train noises, so we turned them off and have yet to turn them back on, but they seem great.
B000E16658|5|Used this to take my stroller on a couple of trips. The bag works very good it is just not too east to take off and on so helps to have some else with you.
B003BNZRY2|5|This thing was awesome from about 2 to 3 months old to 5 or 6 months. Once my daughter could really flip over and move, you can forget about it! We would wake up with her face down, half way or all the way out of it. I will use it on my next child for sure and I will gift it to someone after I am done with it. The way it wrapped tight around her made her fall asleep sometimes. The Velcro is loud but necessary and never really bothered her.
B009CSNVAM|3|The seat was what I expected: reasonably heavy so it doesn't tip too easily and a nice semi-soft foam. It fits my smaller-than average three month old well with plenty of room to grow.<br /><br />However, I'm docking a star because the seatbelt fabric is not very high quality, so adjusting/tightening requires picking at the straps instead of just a strong smooth tug.<br /><br />Another star deducted because Amazon shipped the wrong item.  I ordered Lime Green but a turquoise colored seat arrived instead.  I wanted the seat promptly and the color isn't bad (just doesn't match my decor), so I'm not bothering with returns.
B001R1I44U|5|My daughter and I absolutely love these cups! I am perplexed by the bad reviews. I think some or all of the issues could be explained by user error. The straws are easy to remove for cleaning, can be taken apart, and have a flip out valve. I think the leaking other reviewers are complaining about may be because they are pushing the straws to far when reassembling after cleaning. This prevents the anti reflux valve from being able to close and may permanently damage the valve. Milk grows bacteria very fast so if you are leaving milk in a cup for long periods of time, bacteria will grow and cause excess gas which could explain the \\"volcano\\" effect some have described. I have had absolutely NO issues with this cup and LOVE it!
B0019RW36W|5|Every bouncer has its pros & cons:    pros:  * my 3 month old loves staring at the bubbles and seems mesmerized by the spinning starfish  * has a 10 minute self-timer so it acts as a good reminder to switch activities for your baby    cons:  * battery compartment is located underneath the seat making battery changes awkward  * toybar needs to be completely removed every time you put the child in & out of the seat -- if they could make the toybar swing out, it would make life more convenient!    ***update***  My baby is now 10 months old and although she is beyond the recommended age for this, she absolutely STILL loves this!! If she's fussy & I need 10 minutes to take a shower, I set this up on the bathroom floor, plop her in this with a teether, turn it on and [silence]... She just sits back & watch the bubbles while listening to the music. Now that she's learning to stand on her own, she even likes to hold onto the bubble panel and stare at the fish. This is the best toy I ever spent money on!!!
B00624DJR4|5|This is the absolute BEST carrier available! A friend loaned me one and I just fell in love and had to buy another. It is so simply and easy to use, no extra fabric or complicated ways to get the baby in the darn thing. Both of my girls loved this although I found I used it way more with my second baby. I run a cattle ranch and have fed cows, cleaned stalls, fixed fence, you name it with my baby in this. Perfect for the millions of things you need to get done and have your hands free for. I am getting this for every expecting mom I know I love it that much!  I cannot say enough good things about this. And it is easily washable too! I have used it from newborn to 7 months so far and still use it on a daily basis with my daughter facing forward now. Lots of different ways to wear your baby with this one, and they are easy and simple. This is a must have.
B000AV7O4O|2|Great concept, super cute but ours fell off the tile bathroom in about 2 months flat. I like the large storage capacity and the frog fingers but doesn't' matter if it doesn't stay up
B00U8B7UQS|5|I ordered this the other day because I am sick and tired of the wire type shoe holder which always ends up ruining my heels and wedges. I can never find the matches and it really gets annoying. I installed this in my bedroom closet and filled it up with my shoes and I love it. First off, I dont have to mount this on anything or hang it, it just velcro's around my closet clothing rod and that's it. Its very very sturdy and doesn't feel like it will fall at all. The material is very durable and lightweight. Its NOT made from cheap material that will rip the cloth with heels. There are 5 compartments that fit 2 pairs of shoes each. I will probably buy a few more so that way I can have them side by side and organize everything. My feels, wedges, sneakers and boots fit perfectly. I put boots in to their own compartment like my UGGs and also running sneakers. My flats and sandals I could fit into one easily. I am very happy with this product. I would highly recommend this to anyone. *I received a sample in exchange for my honest unbiased review.
B00N98RLKW|5|Great product. My baby does not like to be swaddled tight and this comforter offers enough room for him to wiggle and take his hands out. I washed it and dried it a few times already and it did not affect its quality. Great buy, highly recommended.
B00CSKMC4W|3|It's really cute (I have the matching crib set so it looks adorable together) but it constantly slides down
B000A1CLVA|2|I read somewhere that this seat used to be called the \\"Husky\\" and I can understand why.  The closest crotch strap placement still makes for a very roomy fit for my skinny 3-year-old.  He moves around so much within the straps even when they are pulled tight.  I spent LOTS of money getting 2 of these seats for our 2 cars and now I'm going to have to get new seats because my son really isn't safe and secure.  A disappointment to say the least.  I have the Britax Roundabouts as well and LOVE those.
B005UVR0NO|5|I love this travel system especially the stroller. It is so easy to fold up and unfold. Very lightweight. I am small, just 5'0&#34; and I have no trouble getting it in and out of our car.
B007A2ZSZ8|3|Got these to keep the dog out of the trash can. She ripped them off instantly. Used super glue to try and hold them better and she still managed to get them apart.
B000ZPJT5W|5|Had it for over a year....  Best feature is the strap that you can attach to cart or stroller.  Main reason why we bought it.
B004HM63DA|5|This ball makes bath time so much easier! The vents make it easy to grasp and the holes allow water to shower from the bottom, not to mention the jiggly ball inside... I could go on and on.
B00ECG0IFA|5|Well built, great way to excercise! Easy to push and steer. I love it! I much prefer getting out and about. The treadmill gets old.
B000ZQ4T5G|5|I loved it. I used it in China for two weeks with my daughter.She was 26 pound and 21 months old.  She was confortable and happy to be so close to her new mom. Loved it.<br />My husband pref. the to just hold her without it.
B00APSJOHW|5|Cute toy, my daughter loves it.
B00BLBLR1I|5|I absolutely love this pump! Comfortable and quiet, works great!
B001E01GBM|4|Highlights:<br /><br />*The seats can be positioned in 4 different positions. I LOVE this feature so much. 99% of the time I keep the boys facing each other. They chatter to each other, make faces at each other and entertain themselves (and me!). But anytime they get ornery and start picking on each other I flip one of them around so they can't look at each other. When they are facing each other their feet are all over each other as there isn't a lot of space for them to both be facing the same way, for some reason my boys don't mind this.<br />It also comes with an infant car seat bar that you can put on and then just put the car seat on top of.<br /><br />*There is lots of storage space! There are two deep cup holders and a key holder built into the handle bar. The key holder is quite spacious and can hold my keys and phone and cash. The basket underneath the stroller is as long as the stroller frame. It is easily assessable from the back (where the handle bar is) and from the front end, but it is a little more challenging to get anything that ends up in the middle of the stroller basket - which really isn't a big deal since it is a perfect spot for things like shopping bags or beach towels that aren't immediately needed.<br /><br />*It folds up easily and compactly - or at least I think so. We have an Aztec and it fits very easily in the back of our vehicle with plenty of room to spare. The seats need to be taken off each time you fold the stroller up, but they snap off and on quite easily that it really isn't a big deal.<br /><br />*Because it is long, and not wide, it easily fits anywhere. There have been a few situations where the length of it has required us to back it up in a tight situation rather than be able to turn it around, but it pushes quite easily and fits almost everywhere.<br /><br />*The seats recline for the kids to nap - not that my kids nap in public. But if my kids DID sleep in public the seats do recline quite nicely and it's a nice feature. And the shade covers cover up quite a bit - all but their toes get covered.<br /><br />The Not So Great:<br /><br />*It is a bit on the heavy side. I quickly checked out a few other double strollers and their weights ranged from 34-45lbs. This one is 53lbs! In the early days after I had given birth it was HARD to pick this up and put it in the back of our car. It's definitely not a lightweight stroller and takes some effort to move. But on the bright side, you can count it as an arm workout when you load/unload it - right?!!?<br /><br />*The wheels seem cheap. The wheels snap into place and while we haven't really had issues with them, they just seem cheap and like they could have been better constructed.<br /><br />*The seats are lined with a felt type fabric and it seems like a really hot/sweaty fabric to have on a stroller behind their heads and necks. There is a neck pillow that comes with it made of the same fabric and I removed it since they were just sweating with it in place.<br /><br />*There is a safety bar that snaps into place in front of them (the seats have a 5 point harness) - if you mindlessly snap the safety bar in place it is VERY EASY to pinch your finger. And it would be easy for little ones fingers to be pinched too.<br /><br />I have put off reviewing this stroller as I wanted to see how much I liked it after we'd had it for awhile - and after one year of use I can honestly say that I am very pleased with our choice and grateful for this gift!! I would highly recommend this stroller to anyone else looking for a double stroller.<br /><br />Re-posted from my blog.all but their toes get covered.

B000067EH7|5|The sling in this bathtub works perfectly, it submerges our baby from the waist down. The size length and weight are perfect.  We are really happy with this bathtub :-)
B00149PZV0|4|Cute, exactly what I was looking for. Small shelf and quality you would expect but very easy to put together.
B00NGN9SK6|5|Our baby likes them. We dont use them often but whenever we do he is comfortable.
B000WUYAZY|3|I bought this crib as my sons primary crib. I choose this because we knew that do to our house set up we would most likely have to move the crib around. Five minutes after putting it together one of the legs cracked at the bottom making one of the wheels fall off. We contacted the company and they had no interest in helping us. We used tape and fixed it the best we could. The other complaint as the safety stickers are all over the inside of the crib are very visible and not removable which is disappointing for decorating the crib. As a second crib or grand moms house it is probably okay.
B000YDDF6O|5|Our baby loves this toy
B000H1MRJO|5|Absolutely love this cot.  I should clarify.  Our 2 year old absolutely loves this cot.  Much smaller and lighter than a pak-n-play, and provides a great big-boy-bed when we are away from home.
B00HI8BKOC|4|Good price for this parts and very easy to clean. Perfect fit my pump in style medela breast pump !!
B006PB2GJ6|4|We bought this highchair for our 6-month old daughter and we have been very pleased so far.  A few highlights:<br /><br />1.  The look: the tangerine color is perfect - not too bright and the print is adorable.  We get lots of compliments on the highchair on how cool and modern it is.<br /><br />2.  The tray pulls right up to our daughter's little belly.  She's small for her age and it works great.  Also, I like the straps.  They stay nice and tight so she can't move around a lot.<br /><br />I do agree with other reviewers that the wheels are not the greatest, but if you are not planning to move the chair all over your house, you should be fine.<br /><br />Overall, it's a great chair.  Sleek and sharp.  Since you have to look at it, you might as well pick one that matches your decor.
B004044LD4|1|I received mine damaged and sent it back for a new one, well I never got it as the replacement one was sent damaged as well and the shipping party refused to send it to me that way. I couldn't tell you much about this mattress other than it is very firm and had it arrived undamaged I would have been pleased with my purchase. I ended up getting another brand and am super happy with that mattress :)
B000058DM5|5|My daughter and I would not have survived the first 4 months without this baby carrier!! She loved it! At times it was the only way she would sleep during the day and still allow me the mobility to get around - inside and out. The carrier is VERY easy to use and very durable - a quality product. I highly recommend buying this product.
B004IPLFNO|4|High quality
B002JP7USY|5|love it
B00KWR2BCQ|5|To tell the truth i use this pillow between my legs when um laying on my side in bed.  The size is perfect.
B00IOGIM9S|5|I was so excited when I got this in because it was delivered to my door as we were headed to dinner so I got to use it right away! I was a little nervous to try it at a restaurant for the first time but it was super easy and very sturdy, a lot more sturdy than your restaurant wooden highchair. When we're not using it out we have it on the bar in the kitchen so while we're doing dishes the little one is right there ☺ and she loves it too!
B006NZEC3C|3|it was a little long getting to me but it was as expected. no defects. and it was affordable enough
B00JRUQPOE|5|So adorable.  I bought this for my new grandson.  I had his name monogrammed on it and it is adorable.  Love, Love!
B001IWN5GK|5|This is a must buy for any newborn. I didn't think so before having one but getting one convinced me. It makes holding a baby so much easier. Your arms don't get tired and it's more comfortable for the baby too. My wife tells me it's fantastic for nursing and I don't know how I'd bottle feed without it. We also use it when our baby occasionally sleeps in our bed or in our recliner with us because it creates a more secure hold for the child.
B0043M57C2|5|Great activity book. Has lots of bright colors and different feels for your baby. I have been impressed with all the skip hop products we have gotten
B00F2MQ294|3|Used this a handful of times. Would not purchase again.
B000M432IG|5|My wife almost won't get out of bed anymore since she got this pillow, the only time she is comfortable!  A MUST have....
B008QYEQCK|5|These are my favorites for potty training! They run big for wearing over underwear; so consider that if you are purchasing for potty training. They will be puffy, but they are nice and thin. The main thing is that you want them to fit snug around the legs, but not too tight. I ordered a size down for a skinny legged toddler, and it works great for holding in accidents. These are thin and waterproof but are not intended to absorb anything at all. They merely contain the accident long enough for you to get your little one changed. Liquid will pool inside; so make sure you are ready for that when you take these off. Have towels ready to catch and clean up the mess. If you miss an accident, and your toddler is running around and bending etc, they will leak, but they are better than having instant messes during potty training. This is helpful for when your toddler needs to be in a carpeted room and when you are out. Otherwise I would keep them in regular clothes so they can instantly feel the full effect of what's happening as they have accidents. When these are on, you will need to pay attention to know when they have gone so potty training can move forward. But these are a huge help for those times you need messes contained. Be certain that the underwear are completely tucked in (otherwise liquid can wick out onto clothing)and make sure no clothes are tucked into them or they will get wet by wicking too. You can rinse them out and dry them and reuse, but if the outside gets wet, it takes time to dry completely. I wash mine and air dry. They are holding up well, and I like that they slip on over underwear. We use the Gerber training underwear that has thicker material and helps absorb a bit too.
B005RVYEMW|5|I use this cream as a lubricant for pumping, since my baby doesn't breast feed. It is fantastic - doesn't leave a residue on the plastic pumping gear, smells good, natural. highly recommend for anyone who wants lanolin free.<br />I can't rate how well it is as a healing ointment, as any time I've gotten abrasions I've used APNO.
B001FB567U|4|Camera would be more practical if it just had a heavy base rather than the magnetic base.  Table tops are not usually metal.
B00PX8PIC4|1|I purchased this as a baby gift for a friend. Upon opening the box she discovered that one of the straps ,to secure the car seat in the car, was missing. She contacted Graco and was promised a new seat would be sent. That was over 2wks ago. The car seat cannot be used with out the strap, therefore she cannot take her baby in the car! This is a safety issue that should of handled immediately!!<br />I am both embarrassed and angry that the company has not followed through on an issue that requires immediate action.<br />I would not recommend purchasing this product from Graco.
B003A73S4K|5|Love this hat. Used it at the beach on our 7.5 month old. He left it on and it kept his head neck and ears protected! The draw string makes it adjustable for head size in a second.
B00DWWVV56|5|As a disclosure - we did get this product to test and review.  ALL OPINIONS ARE MY OWN.  We love this product.  It is much more secure than other swaddlers because of the snaps on the top and the additional Velcro on the left side.  A huge plus is the zipper on the bottom for easy diaper changes!  The sizing is great.  He is 13 lbs so we were afraid that the small would be too restrictive - but he has plenty of room.  The fabric is perfect - not too thin or too thick.  The pattern (Hoot Owl) is ADORABLE.  I am going to be buying this product for baby shower gifts from here on out.
B00952P7PC|4|I bought to sets for my twins. It is easy to fill, use and clean. They like these cups.<br />The only draw back that I found is that in the keep a little bit of water trapped in the dishwasher... not a big deal just a little annoying to have to dry the cups after every wash.
B00HS3XBQ2|4|Awesome little cup, does the job keeping the mess to a minimum and my baby loves it!
B00AUIZG06|1|Leans too far back for babies not sitting on their own. The corner pieces on bottom of the frame needed foe balance on the floor would not stay screwed in. Used this twice and it went in the trash.
B00DYOQMF6|5|Quite possibly the world's most perfect paci!
B00C2U7HRU|2|I love this sheet and so does my 2.5 year old boy.  In fact, he loves it so much he doesn't even want me to remove it to wash it!  He lays in bed and traces the roads with his finger or drives his matchbox cars on it.  It fits his mattress (52x28x6) and isn't too tight-it fits perfectly where you don't have to struggle to get it on AND it hasn't shrunk after several washes!  I need to purchase a second one since no other sheet will do.<br /><br />I still love the sheet, but after only 3 washes a corner seam ripped and had to be sewn back together.
B004J34TF6|5|Dr. Brown's products are just great!
B00FZP3E8A|2|great price but comes with a huge safety concern. I purchased this stroller to bring to Dominica for the next 8 months. I did not get much of a chance to test ride it before coming to the island. Once here it became obvious that i will need to carry my baby wherever I go since the front wheel is extremely wobbly and the tires seem to not hold air in them long enough, so i would need to replace the inner tubes at a whopping total of $46 (sold by babytrend). I saw a you tube video on how to fix the wobbling front wheel but being in a place without my tools and the needed resources it makes that task a lot more challenging, add to that the lack of free time and it makes me wish i had paid double the price and gotten a more reliable product in which id feel safe placing my baby in. If you have the time and money to make the necessary repairs in case you end up with one of the defective products you will enjoy the project and stroller. If you are looking for piece of mind and reliability id recommend looking elsewhere.
B004TTPYMC|5|Perfect
B00UR2EUVQ|5|Love these clips... Hold pacifiers and teething toys perfectly. I also love the patterns and material - great quality
B000INYSIY|5|My son uses this and it is a life saver when we go out to public places. he is 2 and a half years old and i refuse to allow him to use a public stall. So we go in and take this out he finds it funny and he goes. Clean up is simple and fast and he is happy and so am i.<br /><br />Now we just need a turd tube xD!
B00G42IPTG|5|Great product!! Thank u!
B003LQQGE4|5|Very good quality; sturdy ~ although my grandson is still a bit young for it, he'll be able to use it soon.  Loved the gifting option, and it arrived exactly on the day promised.  Price was almost comparable to retail tho' which surprised me.  But the convenience was worth it.
B0050GD2AE|5|This stroller is lightweight, has a lay flat option for Newbies (I added a snuggler), Glides and turns very easily (one handed), folds up in 2 seconds (literally!!), and the sun cover is excellent and covers most of my baby. Bought this along with the Britax stroller organizer for cup holder and storage and also the rain shield. Love everything! Really a great stroller and I live in New York City.
B007A2ZSZ8|5|Loved these so much that I bought more.
B003VNKLHA|4|Wonderful. It extends even more than it says!! Very sturdy and looks very nice.
B000GB0NZK|2|When I first found these, I just knew I was going to LOVE them... but, disappointment soon followed.  The plastic \\"spirals\\" do not totally meet each other, so if this gets turned over in the diaper bag, car seat, etc. it can quickly make a big mess.  My son has also learned to just poke down one of the spiral/triangle pieces with one finger, then shakes it upside down so he and the surrounding area is showered with snacks.
B000SEVCPK|3|smaller than expected
B006D1P3GQ|1|I have been an Amazon customer forever - I literally buy everything on Amazon, but I have never written a review before.  I felt compelled to write one about this product.  While I love the sleep sack itself, with the zipper from the bottom to the neck (much easier with a squirming baby), the brown one sheds everywhere, to the point where I can't use it anymore.  The brown fuzzies are literally everywhere, and it seems to get worse the more I wash it.  The fuzzies sort of latched on to my son's PJs and ruined a few pairs. It's all over the carpet, his sheets, toys, everything.  I'm going to have to use one of those roller things to get it off his sheets and clothes because the fuzzies don't come off in the dryer. So incredibly disappointing and annoying.  Just thought other moms should know.  As an aside, we also have a gunapod in the non-fuzzy material (the one with the polka dots) and I love it.  It's not as warm as this one, which is why I bought it, but it at least doesn't shed everywhere.
B001W2JMZ4|5|We use this item as a laundry basket in my daughter's room.  Just what I expected.  Good quality, cute, large!
B000YDD5XC|4|I thought this walker was worth the money however it also came with things to put together on top of the walker. I like that it is adjustable and you just take it out the box and set it up the only thing I did not like was putting on top the toys and I did not know the lighted castle had to have batteries in it which was also very difficult to put in but otherthan that it very cute for a little girl. I would recommend it. as disney is a trusted name
B00AYZFGZA|5|I brought this book for my future granddaughter.  Most of the ones you buy at the store are just picture albums.  This one has room to record gift, birthdays, events, etc.
B000V3YFJI|5|The boosters are a great invention and work really well! I love the ease of use and the grips on the bottoms!<br />Shipping was very fast!
B000XS1WLU|4|my only complaint is the pillow is not useful, its way to thin. but thats not a big deal, or a reason not to buy it. its great for decoration, and my girlfriend actually liked it saying she wouldnt want a big fluffy pillow in fear for him smothering<br /><br />the colors are great, and the quality is great.<br /><br />the diaper stacker and the thing with 3 pouches are what gets used the most and are in general really useful. we hung them over the changing table so diapers are easily accessible and the pouch holds lotions and gels and whatever else u need most often so u dont have to bend over or run and find<br /><br />i dont know why this has so many bad reviews, perhaps the price? we wanted it and it was the nicest monkey set
B0092NNQ98|4|Our 5 month old baby loves this, but seems to constantly slouch over in it. It might be because she is small for her age at only 13 lbs. Also, I have started feeding her solids in this and it is now stained orange! I havent figured out how to get the stains out yet.
B0019QCGVK|3|Bought it for my son. He doesn't really put it in his mouth even though he is teething. He just plays with it for about 5 minutes and gets bored. Okay product but I wouldn't buy it again if I had another baby.
B001ECRQU0|5|Our main stroller is a Bob (for walking and running) but, I wanted a stroller to keep in the car.  I got the Trevi first, but it was just a little too big and heavy.  The C6 is a perfect size for my Rav4 and my husband's Prius.  Light, functional, great color (lime), and our boy (6 months old) seems to like it.  I am 5'3\\" so the handles are fine, but I could see how someone taller would have a problem with stooping and kicking the back wheels.  Great stroller for the price!
B002USE0Q0|5|These are my favorite baby blankets. We originally received them as a shower gift for our son, now 22 months, and we still use them everyday. They are incredibly soft and our son takes at least one with him everywhere we go. They work great for covering a stroller or car seat - especially on warmer days, since they provide shade but still allow plenty of air to flow through. These are now my go-to baby shower gift for all of my friends.
B00BUBNZ8W|3|Still falls down. I like the cover but it doesn't really do what it says. Sometimes, if I'm in the perfect position and if he doesn't move at all, it will work.
B00A2HUGYQ|5|We now have 3 of these in our minivan for my almost 4 yo and almost 2 yo twins. It is just as comfortable for all 3. It's rather large, but we did our due diligence and it's the safest. And Amazon had them priced lower than the local baby store when they had them on sale for 25% off their normal price.
B001PYQWXY|5|This gate is a great value.  It's durable and attractive.  I have another just like it that I have been using for at least two years.
B0049SP0AE|1|They had option elephant, monkey or three of them. I choose the option for three of them and recieved only one. I am missing something?
B002C30S96|4|I bought this bookbag for my nephew who was starting preschool at age 3, he is such a small little fellow, I didn't want to get a bigger bag to make him topple over, but his folder wouldn't fit in this one. So now it is a going to Grammies and Aunties bag.
B0033UVJOU|1|I didn't necessarily hate this product, but my son did.  Maybe if we started him out with it, he would have liked it.  Instead, he LOVES the next step swaddle - the Summer Infant Swaddle Me Stage 2.  Not looking forward to the day when he outgrows the Stage 2 swaddles!
B00139VOU2|4|I just received this mattress, after ordering the MC34 Naturepedic as well, both of them are too short in length to fit this crib. The mattresses I got were 51 1/2 in length, for this Ikea crib you need at least 52 1/2. I need to find another brand. If anyone has recommendation please let me know.<br /><br />BTW The MC34 is a lot firmer then this one.<br /><br />Thank you.
B005JN6304|2|We got this gate somewhere else. It was okay at first but wears out very fast!!! We did use this for our outside deck so maybe wears better inside. For a child I would not recommend this gate. The latches that adjust to lock the size are flimsy and if you don't latch them all after closed then its very easy for a little one to figure out! My son is 1 and I don't trust this. It is extremely inconvenient
B00D04R1QE|3|GOOD
B001I7PY1E|5|this is the perfect length for our tub. the curve goes right up to the drain. i took my time cleaning and than making sure i got a good suction to the tub. then i tried to slide it. it didnt budge. i stood and tried to move it with my feet  it didnt budge, PERFECT! !
B0044TAYE0|5|Unfortunately, I bought these to decorate cupcakes for a baby shower !  I am sue the baby will use them after.  They<br />are soft but sturdy.
B0052QYLUM|3|I will say this product feels cheap; the plastic, the corners, the antenna, everything about feels cheap. That being said, the picture and sound quality is surprisingly good. I do not like the \\"stand\\" the monitor has. All it is is the belt clip hanging loosely until it hits a hard surface then it acts like a stand. My BIG problem with this is WiFi interference. We hooked up the monitor, put our baby to sleep, and had the monitor sitting next to us. My wife and I got on our iPads/iPhones and we had SUPER slow internet. I did some research (using 3G) and found that the 2.4GHz frequency which is constantly changing channels to be secure, can interfere with wireless routers. I am sending this product back and probably getting a new Levana monitor because our old one did not mess with our WiFi.
B005KWL0OI|1|The clear tip is so tiny can barely fit anything in there
B0014J0W8G|4|Cabinet locks are not easy to purchase. There really isn't a perfect solution out there and my mommy brain will just not let me think of one to invent.  So we try everything out there until we find one that works well enough.  These worked well enough for us.  I don't like the ridges along the entire lock, but they aren't that sharp so it doesn't pose an issue.  But, the important rule here is that these keep our child out of the cabinets and still allow me in.  Our daughter has started pulling on them and so far they are holding up.  We have another similiar kind that we bought from babies-r-us (I think it was there brand) that look similiar to these but don't have the ridges. We don't like those. They are hard to use.  You have to line them up perfectly and make sure that the lock is facing the right way on the slide to get it to close. Plus, if you pull on it, it will loosen.  So, when comparing the two, these win hands down.  They don't get loose when pulled on and haven't broken as of yet (6 months of use)  For the price, they are worth it.  Some locks are really expensive and work just the same.  If I'm going to have to replace them eventually anyway, then stick with the cheaper ones that work...which are these.
B00008ODBG|3|This worked really well at keeping my wipes warm, but unlike the Munchkin warmer (which I also had) it requires the 'pillows' to keep moisture in the warmer.  The munchkin warmer does not and the wipes never dried out.  I ended up just using the Munchkin, since the pillows would dry out and harden, then the wipes dried out and who has time for stiff, dry wipes with a dirty diaper?
B002J4U8M0|1|This product boasts that it shows a &#34;true reflection&#34; but it is nothing close. The reflection is very distorted.
B004B762AK|4|At first, I was really pleased with this monitor.  I spent a lot of time researching and was confident enough in the reviews I had read to splurge on the product.  Unfortunately, after only 9 months, the touch screen began to malfunction and the bottom row of icons was no longer usable.  This was disappointing especially because we had just learned we were expecting again and fully planned to buy a second camera for nursery #2 (the bottom row of icons is necessary to access a second camera).<br /><br />Reading online that the company was willing to replace malfunctioning products, I called the customer service line (during business hours---I am a working mom, so this was NOT easy) and spent over 20 minutes holding before I could finally speak to a representative. They assured me I could mail the product back (at my own expense) and they would replace it.<br /><br />The replacement took six weeks to arrive.<br /><br />When it did finally arrived, I was furious to learn that the monitor would apparently not hold a charge OR hold enough power ON THE CHARGER to stay on for more than a few seconds.  It is basically useless.<br /><br />I have contacted Summer again (this time by email, because I am unwilling to spend 20 minutes of my workday on hold again, and am awaiting a response.  Needless to say, I am extremely disappointed in the entire experience and am shopping around for a different product.<br /><br />***UPDATE:  My second email received a response 3 days later and in another 3 days, a new power adapter arrived which allowed for full use of the monitor once more.  We are contemplating our decision to purchase a second camera to use in the second nursery when #2 arrives in August.  Much happier with my second interaction with Summer customer service.  ***
B008BKU61O|1|Was just wondering why these blue bottles are more expensive then pink ones??? Kind of annoys me there the exact same bottles but because of the color they are more expensive.
B001A37XJM|4|This product just like many other Fisher Price products is full value for money. Our Baby girl just loves to be rocked and you really cant do that all the time.. So one sleepless night I just ordered this one and wow it works.. The tunes are also good. Our Baby likes the rhymes tune when she is in a playful mood and the rainforest tune when she is sleepy or playing with the mobile. The animals are also cute and she loves the colors.The fact that it works on electricity is one of its best feature as no changing cell all the time. And the last thing you wanna do when Baby is crying is be looking for a Screw Driver.. I would have rated it 5 stars however the music sometimes plays on it own.. kinda creepy.. actually the volume button is too sensitive..So need to keep it off when Baby is sleeping.. But its good I definitely recommend it..
B0031KMAJK|1|The crib came with two left front posts. Delta does not have replacement parts for two months. Don't buy this crib. To much frustration during your happiest time.
B00K7J0VLM|5|Absolutely PERFECT for our teething daughter! She LOVES it. She can alleviate pain by biting down on the mesh filled food AND we can introduce her to solid food! It's convenient, cleans easily and is easy for her to hold.
B00F1CPBQ0|5|I searched and searched for a portable mobile and thankfully, Amazon (as always) had one! We use this on our pack-n-play downstairs and it is awesome! My son loves looking at it. I only wish it had a wider song variety as the limited playlist becomes repetitive very quickly.
B00IX3QKXW|5|This case is a very durable case and very nice. If I could do this again I would I got this for free so I cant complain at all I would buy these cases
B00FPA82FK|5|Warm and cozy. Baby loves it
B00GEF7CJW|5|It was a little hard to figure out at first because the instructions were missing.
B00005QBWY|3|Bottle warmers are items you can do without.  Using a cup of warm water works just as well.  For all the new parents out there just save your money for the diapers you will REALLY need!<br />This was adequate nothing to rave about.
B0031VLRYI|5|Wubbanub pacifiers are the only ones my daughter will use. They are soft and the colors are beautiful. We get compliments all the time on this one. So cute!!
B00ASI748K|5|Wonderful combo, Using this for nearly 4 months and east to connect and travel. Plus the color is also vibrant. Good purchase
B000GAYYCE|5|nice product，but good has not started to use
B001GQ2RVC|5|I don't often write reviews, but as I'm watching my almost 6-month old in his Fisher Price Precious Planet Snow Globe & Lights Bouncer, I feel it is worth sharing our experience.  I had picked out this bouncer, based on reviews online, and it was given to me as a baby shower gift.  My son has used the bouncer since we first came home from the hospital.  Initially just the bouncy seat was enough stimulation for him.  He would sit there quietly in it and often fall asleep.  At probably 6 or 8 weeks he developed an interest in the snow globe bar.  Eventually he learned how to move the little whale (which moves the fish above it) and that added a new element of fun for him.  I'm constantly amazed at how he is still interested in it after all these months.  He also enjoys looking at the chair when he's not in it - he likes the baby animals on it.  Wonderful toy we couldn't have lived without!
B004NONY8E|5|This is a great high chair system. The insert is perfect for little ones when first learning to eat soft foods.  The entire high chair is easy to clean.  The booster seat is nice for traveling to other peoples houses.
B00B4H098G|1|I decided to purchase this &#34;higher end&#34; sheet as I had thought the brand's reputation and quality would be worth it. It is pretty to the eye, but after two washes, it ripped at one of the seams. I have a six month old, so I know it isn't from wear and tear. I followed the care instructions as well. I am really dissapointed. I thought spending more $ up front for quality would save me money in the end. I was wrong.
B000T91XR6|5|Awesome stroller system, June 13, 2008   By  Jessica Pellien (Levittown, PA) - See all my reviews           I couldn't be more pleased with this purchase. We are on our third baby and with the two older children, we used much more expensive stroller systems that BOTH broke and were clunky and heavy. The Acella Sport system is light, easy to open and close (unlike other strollers, this really IS a one hand system). As other reviewers have noted, the stroller folds in such a way that none of the cloth parts touch the ground so everything stays very clean. It folds up small enough that I have no problem lifting it in and out of the minivan trunk.     The three wheel system is wonderful - the front wheel pivots easily and handling is very nice. The brakes are easy to engage and disengage and hold the stroller really still. I've taken it to the park and traveled over grass, sand, playground mulch - you name it, and the stroller exceeded my expectations for how smoothly it traveled.     The seat comes with built in cushions which we had to purchase separately with our earlier strollers.     Some caveats:   I think the seat's removable shade is a bit flimsy. I don't like the way the fabric hangs loosely off the back of the seat when it's folded down.   The under stroller storage is smaller than other systems. I can fit our diaper bag (a backpack style), but very little else.   Though there are three cupholders on the handle, only one is large enough to hold a water bottle or cup. We've been using the child's cupholder to hold a second drink.  The color really is blue as noted in other reviews. We have a baby girl and it's not a huge deal, but I would have been happier with a more gender neutral color.
B005IWM8PU|5|Got this for my baby registry. Used for guests kids and it's simple and easy to use. Great to clean and store
B0002VAF3Y|3|20 inches high sounds great, but its too tall (by about 4 inches) to fold flush against the bed - so either we leave it up, or trip on it.  You would need a very high box spring for this to work...<br /><br />As rails go, it's a rail. Sturdy enough, long enough to protect most new bed sleepers.<br /><br />But the design is tough...
B0069MDVDG|4|We liked this product so far. It has enough room for items I need and not feminine at all so my husband can use it too.
B00MHYMD6G|5|Awesome! Much bigger than expected my daughter will be beside herself on her 2nd bday when we give it to her at her party
B005IWM74C|2|i was disappointed by this product.  it seems flimsy and cheaply made- it doesnt rock on its on wo a child in it, i cant imagine it doing much with a child in there.  and it wasnt cheap... i expected much more.  i bought it as a shower gift and was actually al ittle embarressed when we took it out of the box to set it up with the expecting mom, but it was on her registry so....
B000067EH7|5|This is a great tub.  Fits perfectly in a kitchen sink.  Easy to use.  My daughter loves playing in it.  Very comfortable for her.  Definitely recommend.
B002VXXNLW|5|I think the baby balboa is a good sling, my baby loves hers. I would warn to wait until the baby is a bit bigger, I got mine when she was 2 months old, but had to wait a few weeks until I felt she was big enough not to get \\"swallowed\\" by the sling - about 9-10 lbs. She is 15 lbs, 5 months now and we still use it almost everyday. It is great to use while shopping, I took her to the Philadelphia museum of Art in it, she slept like a baby.  appreciate that it is adjustable - some slings with out rings did not fit me with the baby in them. When she is fussy  there is nothing better than to slide her in her sling and rock her. I bought this one for my friend who is pregnant.
B00HPZQ85E|5|Carefully read all the reviews on this item and chose this from the reviews.  Knowing what it was like using the old style thermometer with three children, this looks like a real winner to this grandma!
B002PUR7YU|5|this valance added just the right touch to finish off the baby's room.  bright and colorful over dark blue curtains.  With the matching clock on the wall it adds bightness and cheerfulness to the room.
B001PYQWXY|4|Bought 2 of these to use as puppy gates.  The gate that mainly stays in place all the time is fine, but the one that we remove and replace all the time has already started to warp.  My puppy doesn't really jump on t or put her weight on it much so it's not an effect of rough use.<br /><br />Over all, it does its job, and the price was very very reasonable.  I like the look of it, the bamboo is nice and smooth, no splinters.  I would say that warping on the gate started about 1-2 months in.  I've had it for 5 months now and the gate is still holding up, it's just not too square.<br /><br />Also something to note, we place the gate a little diagonal in the doorway so that the gate latch doesn't dig into the wood.  The gate latch applies enough pressure that it can easily scuff the wood of the doorway.
B00IR4F3OY|5|Cute for tiny hands to clutch and coo at the face.  Baby likes the sounds & colors when toy shakes
B002YGSXF2|5|My daughters favorite game forever was \\"throw the cup\\" or throw anything we gave her. This was perfect. It attached to her seatbelt in a high chair or stroller. Eventually she got tired of \\"throw the cup\\" and no longer threw it. Then she got tired of this and managed to remove it. By that point we realized she no longer really (for the most part) threw her cup. Also works perfect for snack cups and any toy it can get a grip on. It is grippy on the inside so it really grips on to whatever you put it on if you make it tight. But once they learn to remove velcro hopefully they are done with the throwing stage.
B00CKSU82K|5|Good product. I'm happy with it. Delivery at time
B00ALOT54C|3|product works like it's suppose too, keeping little ones out of areas or confined to areas.  I didn't really have the problem with the gate others mentioned, but the design in general makes it hard to bend the panels to the shape you want.  If you are not careful, you can break the plastic.  Seems this is the case with all the play yards I looked at.
B001UFSEH0|5|My son and his wife are in the military so they have an APO address. Some times they have a hard time getting packages.   They received this set very quickly and were very excited. They absolutely loved the set!
B004HKIB32|5|Saved major cleaning up of the floor.  Wish I'd invented it.  An easy usable product.
B004KV6UH2|3|I initially loved this cup.  When I was trying to transition my son from a sippy to a straw cup, nothing would work until he tried this one which he took to immediately.  I also love the concept and design which truly does allow my son to get every last sip of his milk which is important since we mix in vitamins and others things that he needs.  Most importantly, the straw provides natural flow of liquid which is very important to me unlike other straw cups.  Where this cup fails is the straw- it is very small and thin which perhaps is the reason why he took to it so quickly but on the flip side, it falls apart pretty quickly.  We've had several straws break off at the top which is a design/manufacturing problem (I don't take the straw out to clean it)and also the tip breaks off from my son chewing on it which obviously is his fault but there is a seam at the tip where it tears.  I did contact the company the first time the straw ripped off few months and they were fantastic.  They replaced the straw with a 2 pack with cleaning brush and because the shipment was delayed they sent me a new cup as well.    I wouldn't recommend using this cup full of liquid to travel- it's leaked in my diaper bag on more than one occasion. Also, you have to really fit it perfectly and make sure it twists a full revolution to make sure it's on properly or liquid will spill out.  When the tip rips off as I mentioned, liquid will burst up through the top when you put the cap on since the tip is where the leak resistant part is.  Even with these issues, I would recommend the cup if only the straws would last longer.
B0010SIJK4|5|In today's consumer market, the myriad choices in bottles and nipples were overwhelming to me as a new parent.  I bought one of most types of bottles or received them as gifts at my shower.  I probably have 10-15 brands and models.  Of them, she does the best with the bottles that actually came with the pump.  Once she outgrew requiring only 4 oz. ever feeding, we moved to the larger bottle and purchased these medium-flow nipples with them.  She does very well with them and unlike most of the bottles we have tried, she has very little to no milk spilling out of the corner of her mouth.  I'm in a mom group and have heard of similar preference with these bottles from the other new moms.  I will be sure to recommend it to other friends as they prepare to navigate the world of baby products with their new little ones.
B000LL1624|5|i was a little apprehensive to buy this because i though my LO wouldn't like it one bit..i was so wrong. he slept great in it! he even likes to play in it..can't wait to use it for fireworks on the 4th! opening and closing were easy, just make sure to have space when you open it, it tends to flip out very quickly. i'm very happy with this product..the size is wonderful..so much more convenient than lugging around a pack n play imo. and the air mattress that comes really doesn't even need the air pump...filled it in 12 full breaths and the pump and now become LO's new carry around toy.
B004G8QNAI|5|This a great way to keep my baby warm without having to turn the heat up in the house...a must have!!!
B00CFGSO3M|5|great baby tub! i use it with a foam piece inside to keep my 6 week old baby from sliding, it is very easy touse and clean and to store when not in use!!
B002J4U8M0|2|This won't stay standing up.
B00A7DVOO6|5|My son LOVES this toy!  He carries his monkey around the house and even insists on taking it places.  He got it for his first birthday and is still in love with it at almost 2 years old.  When he was younger, he would snuggle the tummy with his face to turn on the music.  Now he takes the musical part out and runs around the house with the music playing.  He sleeps with it every night.  I've run it through the washer with good results.  Probably going to need an backup Snugamonkey in case something tragic happens to this one.
B001WAJVZM|5|We were looking for a faucet cover since we give a bath to my daughter in the tub instead of her baby tub, she loves the water and lover touching everything, including the faucet. In addition she is standing up and falling down, so it was a matter of time until she hit her head against the faucet. I read all the reviews and I decided on buying this one since we have a shower converter and it seemed to have open surface that would decrease mold. so far it works great, very easy to put on the faucet. I just wish it was sold by amazon in order to get free shipping.
B000YDDF6O|5|good...........
B003JUL84U|1|I would not buy this booster seat again!  The bad part is we bought two of them for both of our cars because of its high ratings on the website: Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, Highway Loss Data Institute [...].  We've been using this booster seat for about a month now.  We use it in the center of the back seat because of the statistical safety of that position.  However, the base of the booster is so narrow, it tips whenever we take the slightest turn.  My son tells me multiple times while driving \\"don't turn dad\\" as whatever he has falls off his lap.    In the booster's defense it seems comfortable, the side head guards are quite substantial, and even when it tips while turning the seatbelt stays in position on my son's shoulder.    We really wish we had our money back to buy different boosters!
B0094JP0YE|5|We took this on our trip to Disney and everyone wanted to buy it from us.  If you live in a hot environment definitely get this for your kiddo!  The fan blades are soft foam so your baby or Toddler will not get hurt.
B0012LVZMI|5|Love them!! I recommend this product 100%
B00BKV0O68|5|My son loves this car seat. Very comfortable for him. My only complaint is that is is a bit bulky.
B008B50YJ8|5|Just received my clip in the mail and it is so cute andI can't wait to use it!The design is so pretty. I will definitely recommend this for other mom's.
B0049HAO5Q|5|Great product
B006GCAMG8|5|they work great, my child is 2 and once inwhile still wants a bottle with milk, and this nipple does the trick
B00CSAWJQ8|5|excelente producto. a mi bebe le encanta y se le hace de facil manejo
B000046S3T|4|This is pretty good as a cover but the bottom is not as big as I needed to allow my two thicker cords to pass through.  I actually had to take a blade and open it up more on the bottom to accommodate the wires I have.  The other issue I have with this is that it sits over the top of the outlets and attaches with a single screw in the middle like a cover plate.  Unfortunately it can turn around while on the wall meaning little ones could turn it if nothing is plugged in to the outlet and then they could still reach the outlet underneath.  As long as something is always plugged in the cord underneath would stop the turning before it exposed an outlet but this is a problem you should be aware of when buying especially if it will not always have something plugged into it.
B000XT30G4|4|Great quality and great function but these does take two hands to use which can be annoying
B00DTGGOO8|5|I was looking for a cushioned mat since we have mostly hardwood floors. I was hesitant to buy this for the price but it's worth it!  It gives my little one plenty of room to roll around and is pretty comfortable for me to join him on the floor. I also like that it can be rolled up easily and is super easy to clean. I noticed a slight rubber smell when I first opened it but after leaving it rolled out for a couple of days it was gone. This is a great buy!
B00KVHJGDO|5|Im CATBUG!! So cute, so fluffy and you can move around the wings. Perfect &#60;3
B0094ELFY8|5|I bought a green 7 ounce one a year and a half ago.  It had a lot of issues with leaking and the lid being very difficult to get on properly/straight.  We lost it at the mall so I bought a different brand of weighted-straw-sippy-cup (lollacup).  That one was bigger, but did not seem as sturdy, did not fit into cup holders, and the straw did not move as effortlessly and extensively as the Zoli Bot cup.  I finally bought the larger 9oz two cup when my son was old enough for a sippy cup as well (6 months).  The quality control must have improved significantly, as neither of these cups have such bad leaking issues (out of the straw and from the lid) as my previous one.  And with my previous one, I couldn't put the lid on straight for the life of me, even going REALLY slowly and carefully, and the liquid would spill all over the place.  I have had these for a couple months and have not once put the lid on improperly.  YAY!  Before, I simply preferred the Zoli Bot to other cups reluctantly, and now I LOVE these!
B002GP76L8|3|The hole purpose of this swing was to help me make my 6 month old baby boy fall asleep faster. As soon as it arrived I assembled it (30 minutes tops) and tried it out. My baby liked it at first, but after 20 min got annoyed and started to cry. I've tried it with the sounds on, the sounds off, even tried my ipod playlist but nothing, after 20 or 15 min all he wanted was to be pulled off the chair. I think it's because the speed isn't that fast, so the swing doesn't really feel like a \\"car ride\\" for example or like me swinging him in my arms. I guess he'll have to stick to the God given swing, my arms.
B007CKI99A|5|Love these swaddle sacks!! Our baby always pulled a blanket over his head if we put him in bed with one. He got too sweaty in a thick sleeper, but was too cold in a thin sleeper. I ordered one of these and it has been a lifesaver! I have since ordered more. He stays warm but not hot and there is no way he can get it over his face. No more need for a blanket!
B001GGVKHE|5|The best pacifier holder EVER! I bought this cute little thing one year ago, been using it this whole time and it is still doing it's job! Great quality product that I would highly recommend to anyone!
B00DPFJ5SK|5|This thing is awesome. I wasn't sure it would fit because we have a rectangular/square faucet but this item has lots of options. There is a round hole on top, and a wider opening in the back(which we used). The dark rubber material is surprisingly stretchy, so it was easy to get over and secured on my wider than normal faucet.<br /><br />A happy surprise is that our faucets always leaked a bunch of water back onto the basin, but this completely solved the problem. Everything goes down the drain now. I liked it so much I ordered a second one for my bathroom, even though the kids never use it.
B00AJFHG8A|3|I was hoping to save money on buying pouches, since my son loves them and we go through the pre-packaged ones very quickly.  This seemed like a good idea, but in reality, they weren't so great.  The pouches are hard to fill.  I had to try to hold them open with one hand while filling them with the other, which generally just ended up making a mess.  They're also hard to clean.  They're dishwasher safe, but there's no good way to hold them open in the dishwasher.  Food got stuck in the corners and seams that I couldn't get out even when scrubbing with the narrow end of a bottle brush.  When I tried washing them in the dishwasher, dirty water collected in the bottom creases (where the pouch expands).  All in all, I was not impressed.  I wish that I would have used that money to buy the pre-packaged ones.
B000069670|5|My son is only a month old, but he loved this toy from the moment we put it in this crib.  He loves looking in the mirror and the rolly ball.  This toy will grow with him as he exlores the additonal attachemnts.
B00009VE5J|4|I ordered the Floppy Seat online before it started selling at Babies 'R Us.  I had shopped around online and found this one to have the best reputation and design.  I admit I do feel a bit neurotic when I take this out for my daughter, but the benefits make it all worth it. It is so great to know that my daughter isn't putting her hands and mouth on shopping cart handles and restaurant seats that have been handled by countless others!  The comments I get from people are about what a great invention it is, so it looks like this device was long overdue!
B00E8KJYNC|5|arrived on time. loves the product.
B0002X7RYM|1|My husbands friend is selling this for $25 & I was reading reviews & was pretty pleased but it was short lived when I found out what I was hoping for was not the case.. Fabric is not washable, &#34;surface cleaning only&#34;.. 😣
B00012FGA6|5|Daughter loves it and easy to put up.  It is what you expect.  Fits all of the dolls like the picture.
B000IG6I2A|4|I was a little disappointed to see that it had white tie strings instead of the red, but other than that shipping was pretty good and the price was even better! My husband and I are doing the Atlanta Falcons theme so it's really hard trying to find things for his bedding in Red and Black, and after looking for months I finally came across this! Don't get me wrong the white strings aren't bad and don't look too cheap, but just not what I was expecting. Thank you for helping me finally find what I spent a long time looking for!
B001UFD2ZO|1|This product came defected. At first we thought it was the batteries, so we replaced them with new ones and still didn't work. Returning it!
B0010TODHG|5|When I was thinking about buying a crib for my first child, I was very concerned about safety, quality and durability. I ultimately put my trust in the people who had reviewed this product on Amazon. This product was one of the top best sellers in cribs on Amazon only after the Da Vinci Emily. I initially thought I should buy the Emily but something about the design, in particular the wooden bar on top was a clear safety concern that put my decision in favour of the Da Vinci Kalani.<br /><br />I am very happy with the product and would recommend it highly. The product is superb in quality and is amazing in looks. I love the color and it matched with the other furniture I had at home. Setting up was also very easy and I loved that whole experience.<br /><br />For anyone thinking about this product, I would say trust Amazon reviews, all the people like me who have reviewed this product so positively have a reason to be satisfied with this product. This is the first time I got compelled to review a product and that must tell you why this must be a great product.
B000XPB6UU|3|ok
B0033UWT8A|5|I've used these hooks on my stroller for quite a while now, and I love them.  They don't lose their \\"grippiness\\" at all.  The velcro stays firmly attached, and I've had substantial weight on them.  I'm very pleased, and the price is much better than similar ones I bought.  They do the same thing as the more expensive ones (about twice the price) and I think these look nicer.
B004EWGDDI|1|Cute as can be, but very difficult to attach to the faucet....correctly.  Water is suppose to come out of the lips of the blue whale, but only if you are able affix it on EXACTLY!  I also worry about the tight fit causing water to escape behind the tub / shower.
B007C5J1Z6|5|This is the only teether my toddler hasn't been able to destroy!
B00200LOSK|3|picture shows blue and green received pink and yellow :(  don't sanitize in the microwave like my other playtex pacifiers
B000GKWA66|5|Our two year old got one of these as an infant and the 'rain' noise has been a staple to help him fall asleep since.  His \\"Sheepie\\" is a close companion even when the noise is not playing.  We bought another one just last week to give as a baby gift, and found that they had upgraded a little.  Our sleep sheep only plays 23 minutes of noise, but the newer model give you the option of the noise lasting 23 minutes or 45 minutes.  That's a nice addition, as the 23 minutes sometimes is too short.  We have machine washed and dried this MANY times and it seems to be standing up to the beatings a washing machine can give a stuffed animal.
B003XT43MG|5|This mattress really does work. My 6 month old would not sleep on anything. Always wanted to be in my bed, but knew that was not safe. Attempted to try this mattress after reading the reviews. Two months later and he is still sleeping in his crib. This mattress really is magic!
B00LUJFGAY|5|Wonderful I love it!
B000CP2X9O|3|I am not very impressed with these bibs for keeping the baby dry from drool. They seem to work better than the regular cloth ones but still get saturated and will get the clothing wet.
B00AM5NTIS|4|I love the pouches. It saves money and its pretty secure so no big mess.<br />I am still trying to figure out the best way to fill it up because it doesn't stay up on its own.
B000HK6BCE|1|I am sorry to say that these were not as easy to put together or use once installed as I would have hoped. They do not hide away well without getting caught in the sheets. The levers that keep the rail up or down are very difficult to pull in or out. It takes a struggle to put these up or down. I will continue using them but get the plastic ones if you want to avoid some major frustration. Thanks !
B007REDRJI|5|I felt in love with this Baby Bid, it just not only looks soft, it is even softer!!! Beautiful!
B00208IO2G|5|Awesome product! Looks good and works great!
B002U3ZSBG|3|Got seat and base for wife's vehicle.<br />Needed another base for my vehicle to make swapping easier.<br />Base works, no complaints.
B002SZH45E|5|I purchased the BabyComfyNose while I was pregnant and after reading so many great reviews on it.  To be honest the thought of using it made me a little queasy, but I kept it in a box while secretly hoping I wouldn't have to use it.  One morning my baby boy wakes up congested.  I grab the bulb syringe that they gave me at the hospital, but it doesn't help at all.  I sit in the bathroom with the shower running, hoping the steam will loosen up some of the mucus.  It doesn't help either.  Then I remember the BabyComfyNose.  I gave it a try.  I gagged at first, but my baby boy instantly sounded so much better!  Can't believe how much snot was in that tiny little nose!  I use it almost every night now so that my baby can breathe better and sleep better.  This is going to become my go to baby shower gift.
B00OFMORTO|5|LOVE LOVE LOVE!! I recieved a coupon for this and I bought this for my new niece. I wanted to be able to see her face when I drive her around and this is great! I have an older child and the ones we had when she was young were so much smaller and poor quality. This one is big and bright and made with high quality materials. It was easy to install, if you can call it that, and I am very happy with it so far! Love looking at that face!!
B00D7NA4D0|5|amazing. so soft. snags easily however.
B001CFFX90|5|I bought this as a present for my wife.<br />She has bad knees and this foot rest is just the<br />help she needed in the shower to assist her in shaveing her legs.
B00913DY3W|5|We have this in both blue and orange. We bough the blue one for an Easter basket gift, and he loved it so much we ran out and got a second one. I like that the &#34;nubbies&#34; are short, so you don't have to worry as much about them getting it too far into their mouth. Easy to wash, easy to store, and has definitely became one of my &#34;mommy must haves&#34; for shower gifts!
B00AKFEK8S|5|My daughter wants this constantly.  Even if she wouldn't really like the contents if they were in a different container.  I am getting a bit worried she likes it too much, though. I feel like she's looking for a way to regress to her baby-days by having something to suck on like her baby sister...
B004REV5HW|5|I love the design of this bag and that it doesn't look like a diaper bag (I received so many compliments from women not realizing it's a diaper bag).  The bag is durable and can fit everything I need for a day of running around.
B0032FOOSO|5|We own two of these gates, and have used one for about 4 years, and when we needed a second for downstairs, bought it again.  It is fairly easy to put up, and has lasted well.  I would recommend it without hesitation.
B0012BS2O2|4|The customer service of itzbeen was just great.  Mine died after using it with one child and trying to use it for the next.  The company sent me another one, no problem.
B0049P39QY|1|I love the concept of this frame, but the quality is extremely poor. The wood is &#34;soft&#34;, the seams are not tight, and some of the corners are dented.  Again, great concept, poor quality.
B009WQ7FV0|5|My baby loves to chew on her new blanket buddy. I noticed she likes to hang onto burp clothes and tries to stick them in her mouth so I sought out something like that, only organic and cute. This little guy is a great answer. Other brands rate low because they fall apart or are rough to the touch. This is soft, brightly colored and well built.
B000ELIXXQ|5|I will use this product in about 3 moth now, but it looks ok, is my first kid.
B004L2JJC8|5|Simple and easy install. Nice black color and helps keep the grim off my seats.
B00829XUF8|5|This stroller, by far, is the best choice for both city and trail walks.  It is very smooth, light weight and easy fold down and set up.  It has lots of storage room underneath and is great to use for a light grocery shop.  It turns and pivots in small spaces. It fits into small trunks and has minimal assembly when received.  Well worth the money and I would recomend this stroller to all my friends!  Very satisfied!
B000P635T2|5|These locks are easy to use and work well. No pinched fingers here. Keeps those closet doors closed. Order by the pair for a bifold closet door. I made the mistake of ordering one and had to order a second.
B00JEV5UI8|5|Purchased this for vacation - it's very light weight and works amazing!
B00INGNYXS|5|I couldn't tell you who loves this mirror more .... My son or I ;)<br />He used to cry 5 minutes into the car ride, and you could sing and talk and NOTHING would calm him down. But now he sits there and we BOTH admire how extremely cute he is!!
B000HKVG9C|4|I bought this and I am very impressed. It keeps my daughter away from the plug and unplug in bar chords for RTV. The only issue with that is that it does not accommodate larger gauge cords and I had to alter it you seen a Dremel. Other than that it has been great!
B009Z4W140|5|It was due time to upgrade from my worn out analog scale. This sleek scale has nice looks as well as very accurate weighing. I did quite a bit of research, and being a kind of miser with money, I couldn't be happier with the quality for the price. Would buy again.
B000088KGZ|4|Very accurate and fast temperature result!
B00318CO6G|5|This is a great bottle for the little ones who know how to use a straw.  Doesn't make their hands cold and they can feel like their big siblings/parents who have larger versions.
B0050ZIJIU|5|Great product. Cheaper and easier to order than brand name.  I've order these a few times and they have always worked perfectly.
B002WGI5O8|5|I love these nursing pillows. They are a firm foam so they are extremely supportive. They are also highly recommended by lactation consultants. i just love that I don't have to support the baby's weight.
B00190JWW2|2|We decided that our last Evenflo car seat was too old for baby #2 (6 years) so we bought the Graco Snugride (Winnie the Pooh from Walmart). I checked carefully that it had the full canopy, not the mini-canopy that attaches to the back of the seat. However the handle is really hard to adjust -- it takes two hands to press the red lock releases -- if there is any pressure on the handle one or the other of the lock releases won't depress. I had forgotten how critical it is to be able to do this with one hand -- with milk, a diaper bag, or an older kids hand in the other. I wouldn't buy this again, and I'm trying to decide if we can stand it long enough for the baby to hit 22 pounds (she's 12 at the moment).    When the baby is sound asleep in the car seat (surely why you bought a snap-out car seat) the handle has a habit of sliding from an unlocked into locked position with a loud \\"WHACK!\\" that actually jars the seat -- waking the dead, let alone the sleeping baby.     The straps are also very hard to tighten -- you have to feed left and right separately through a metal fitting to adjust. Our last carseat (an Evenflo?) had a one handle release -- you pushed down, then it rotated, and there was enough stiffness in the handle that even in a non-locked position, it never adjusted itself when the baby was asleep.
B00E4BFXOY|5|Life saver. I don't have to wind the mobile every 30 seconds. Why didn't I buy a battery operated mobile earlier I have no idea. Easily replaced old windup mobile. Fit perfectly.
B005MQR794|2|This carseat is of great quality but if your looking to use for travel (airplane) I dont recommend. I was impressed with the foldup and backpack features. This looked as though it was so light if to be carried as a backpack. NOT!!! I was shocked to feel the weight of this thing!! At the end of your trip you may end up with back spasms!!! I just used the Cosco carseat I already owned, which seemed like a \\"jewel\\" after that Diono, which got sent back immediately!!!
B003ZYE7F2|4|I am late on writing this review but after owning the feeding set for about two years I feel like it's a pretty good time to write one. We use these daily for my son's snacks, drinks, and meals and they have held up exceptionally well through the years of washing and use. We have several friends that use the same feeding set with similar results.<br /><br />The plates are large enough that you can fit an entire meal on them but small enough for your young child to hold and to use. The bowls work perfect for pastas, hotdogs/sausage and the like, and snacks. The cups are getting a little small for our son and they don't have a spill guard so that is the only downside to this set. We have instead decided to go with tumblers for his drinks as they are less of a mess. The cups are great for water though and we still get use from them.<br /><br />I would definitely recommend this over any other set and would happily purchase again if ours weren't still in great condition.
B000056OV0|4|I like the tub a lot, my baby who's nine months old (and a big girl) can still use both sides of the tub. I like that it is so big.
B002GDF3T2|3|I have a Medela breast pump, so I had bought just the Medela bottles to go with it. But my daughter, at 2 months old, was choking and coughing when she drank from them. She was also a little colicky and gassy. So I read the reviews of the Dr. Brown bottles and bought a set of two to try out. Honestly, they didn't make a difference. She was still choking on these ones and was still colicky/gassy, and the Dr. Brown bottles were so much more of a pain to clean than the Medela ones. The one feature I did like was the little disc that you put in that keeps the milk from spilling up into the nipple when you transport the bottles.
B00UR1O5B2|5|Good quality.  Good adhesive!
B00U5YP3P8|5|This product works great in removing all types of stains on baby outfits! Delivery took a couple of weeks, otherwise everything was as expected!
B000ERPR2U|5|This nursing cover is wonderful! It has made such a huge difference in my ability to go out and about and not worry about having to go home to nurse her. I used this puppy everywhere-on airplanes, in museums, the park, restaurants, Barnes & Noble-it's cute and gives you complete coverage. The front wire stays propped up so I can watch her as she nurses, and it cleans up nicely in the wash. It's super light weight which is necessary because I live in SC and it gets Hot here. It folds up very small and fits in a little zipper pocket in my diaper bag. The neck strap is adjustable so it'll work for anyone. I almost bought one of the more expensive versions, but the only thing I could think you'd be paying for is foufou material...it's basically an apron with wire at the neck. I recommend this to all nursing moms!
B000056JEG|2|definately needs to have a self standing feature for the freezer. i couldn't believe the manufacturer actually states in the instructions that you should place the bag in a coffee cup in the fridge or freezer... can't they figure out that their product simply needs this added feature?
B001L2SA3A|4|I like the Avent paci's and the little handle on them.  These don't glow in the dark for very long.  Maybe a couple of hours.
B004G8QSXU|5|Our 4 month old son loves these, especially the light-up smiley face!
B00KX5VGDM|5|Keeps the sun from beaming now on my sun. He is much happier in the back seat of the car because he isnt as hot as he was.
B001HX4DNE|4|My baby loves sitting in his bouncer and playing with this wooden toy. He started playing with it at the age of 6 weeks (just looking and hitting at random) and I have observed his motor skills develop with this toy week by week. He loves the little face in the middle and loves spinning the flowers. He has played with this toy for 4 months, so I think the money is worth it.<br />My only wish is that the toys could be switched out individually (other objects to add to the bar), so that it would stay more interesting for him to play.
B006ZVV0R0|1|Our baby was 6lbs 10ozs and 20&#34; when we tried to take her home from the hospital in a Britax B-Safe child seat with this &#34;support pillow&#34;. All issues with the B-Safe car seat aside, this pillow will not allow a child any larger than 7 lbs or so to be put in the seat. We had to pack her in to this thing and she could not move at all (I have pictures).<br /><br />The design does not accommodate the different shoulder strap adjustment heights so you have to use an improper strap adjustment to keep from wrapping this thing all the way around the baby.<br /><br />Also, the seam that runs across the back of the neck sticks out and rubs on the baby's neck making it raw in short order.
B00140KS9I|4|eats batteries, but works fine.
B008G40AQ6|4|My children tend to be tall and most sleep sacks are too short. This one is longer than others I have purchased. Material isn't as fluffy as I would like but it keeps him warm.
B0000488VE|5|Exelent quality. I could buy again.   The only cons are pretty expesive and buy a extra magnetic in case you loose it.
B007QBEUA2|4|Dragon Baby has an average head (she measured at 50% head circumference at 6 months).  These glasses are a little large; they extend past her head about a quarter of an inch on either side.  They're for ages 0-3 though, so I know she'll grow into them.  The first thing she did when we put them on was to take them off and put them in her mouth - so I'm glad they're BPA free.  She then decided to bang them against the couch, on the floor, into her stacking cups...and they didn't break!  Because they're rubber frames (not plastic), they bent a little, but I easily bent them back.  Also, on the inside of the frame, it says &#34;I'm awesome&#34; - which I think is pretty cute.<br /><br />She doesn't like to keep them on her head, so I ended up buying Chums Kid's Universal Fit Rope Eyewear Retainer so that I could strap them to her head.  I didn't like the sunglasses that had straps instead of ear pieces because in order to get the straps tight enough, the lens part was smushed into her eye.  With the eyewear retainer, you get the best of both - the sun protection and the security.
B00MUDH7HY|5|Great product, the kids absolutely love it
B000VVIHPS|4|Works wonderfully. Only issue is that I have to reset it every time the power goes out. Toddler will actually wait till the animal on the clock face wakes up before leaving the room now.
B00076SKZY|4|This has been extremely useful during travel. Fits well on toilet seats on planes. Otherwise we would have had to resort to diapers for amy 3 year old who is getting potty trained.
B00QP8RAYU|5|Shipped really fast and the necklace is great! It is just what I wanted!
B00CMCPQEE|5|Excellent size for our toddler. We read the measurements carefully because several people were saying it was too small. Great stain resistance.  I did wash the cover but let it air dry.  Fit right back. Looked new still, no fading or smudging in color. Very vivid. We have the wooden framed set also 7n den but this is for his room. While the other set is a bit more cute because it looks like someone took real furniture and shrunk it, this foam couch has actually been used more and is more comfortable.  He goes to it more often. Its foam so stumbling onto it is no worry. If we had to do it again, we would gave purchased 2 sets of the foam furniture.  We are pleased. Toddler is 24 inches tall, 30 lbs and 12 months old. Just in case you need a reference point! He did have an accident onit overnight. It stayed on the surface and washed right out. Love this couch!
B00DJBU7FU|5|I like the bright colors and these are pretty much what you expect for baby bowls and spoons.
B007UOYUF0|5|Nice items, keep the baby's clothes clean since they can't &#34;soak&#34; through. have held up well. would buy again
B00Q871ETA|3|Flimsy and yet still works. I would like to see a tighter fit, but this does the job as long as you do not touch it or try to move it around. I would look for a different product instead of buying this one again. However, I do want to say that it is doing the job....right now. It just feels as it will break soon
B0051POK1E|5|Our daughter loves this and it is washable!
B0011E75RK|4|This pump has been very reliable for me for the past 9 months and going strong. You can pump one or 2 breasts at the same time. The first 2 minutes are short quick pumps trying to replicate the way a baby would suck when they first latch, then after 2 minutes it turns into slower pumps as if milk let down. A simple button fixes that if you let down sooner or don't like it. I always let down sooner so being that I pump both breasts at once and do not have the hands free bra thing, I am having to press the let down button by maneuvering to get one hand free, it can be difficult at times.<br />Before I complain about the back pack itself let me say the motor breast pump is totally fantastic and I don't regret it. I've learned to work out not having the space I need because the pump is excellent:<br />The backpack is pretty heavy when it's all packed up with my equipment. There isn't much space inside. The motor sits at the bottom of the bag and takes up half the bag in height. You only have room for your cooler pack with ice, 2 bottles (or a box of medela storage bags) and then squeeze in the pump shields and parts. If you need to pump 2x at work like I do then you need 4 bottles, which will only fit if you keep them in the cooler bag within the backpack, which makes them cold have dew droplets inside. Most days I have to carry the cooler separately to be able to fit the pump accessories/bottles/storage bags, so it defeats the purpose of having a back pack to carry it \\"all\\" in. If you need your car battery pack to pump you'll probably have to leave it in your car because there's no space. I stick nursing pads in one of the little Zipper pockets since they aren't too bulky. Quality materials and zippers on the backpack and cooler bag. Excellent gel pack that has stayed mostly frozen after my 8 hour work shift.<br />A word of advice, let the pump run an extra minute or two after you are done, it will dry out the moisture and you won't have any mildew in the tubes.<br />Fantastic pump, backpack needs to be bigger!antastic pump, backpack needs to be bigger!
B000P635T2|4|We have adventurous kitties who like to get into closets. We have five double-door closets in our house, and they love to get into all of them.    These items are easy to use. The only complaint I have is that the picture is very misleading. It shows a double-door closet needing only one (1) slide lock, which is not the way ours work. The spring mechanism for both sides on our closet doors are at the very end, so to lock both sides, we needed to purchase two (2) items for each closet door. You might want to change that very misleading photo.
B0042D69XS|5|This bouncer is comfortable and attractive.  At first, I wondered if you needed to get a bouncer, swing AND a rocker? The answer is YES!  The bouncer is good for when they are a newborn.  It really snuggles them up so cozy and makes a good sleeper because they are so tiny at first.  So we used this bouncer a lot in the first month.  Then, when he graduated to the rocker to sleep, we didn't really use the bouncer for the second month.  Now, at the third month, I find myself pulling out the bouncer again to use as a recliner for when I am cutting his nails, reading a book or just chatting with my baby.  I like to use the bouncer for supervised playing with my baby.  The rocker is good for naps and nighttime sleeping. The swing is good for unsupervised playing such as if you need to go to the bathroom or take care of something really quick. If you have dogs, it would be safer to put the baby in the swing rather than on the bouncer on the floor. As for all the complaints about these contraptions giving baby flathead.  YES, all of these devices will give your baby flathead if you leave them in there all day - even a crib!  There is no way to get around it since it is highly suggested that babies sleep on their backs and they sleep so many hours a day.  I was reading all these reviews before I gave birth and was terrified to put my baby in any of these things but I learned that you should carry or hold your baby as often as you can and not use these things as babysitters.  I have been carrying my baby and doing tummy time since birth and he still got a flathead at 2 months.  But now at 3 months, I see his head rounding out again.
B006SFUEF2|2|This was the most amazing projector for about 4 months. It worked perfectly for about 4 months and now doesn't project the scene anymore which was the main reason we got it. It's not money well spent.
B004AHMCKU|5|got this for my son when he was 2 months because he hated being in the carseat and this one is the lifesaver. i couldn't have driven with him without this. now he's 5months. he looks at it, pulls it and laughs with it. totally love it!
B0085CBA90|5|New to pumping. This flange looked weird at first but when I tried it, it actually felt more comfortable than the medela flanges. Plus you can flip the shield up or down which ever works best for you. Medela skips sizes (from 30 to 36) I don't know why and pumping pal's XL is a perfect in between size that medela didn't have.
B00HSR0BTI|1|Ok, I won't rant . . . but seriously!<br />1. First off, don't put anything carbonated in it . . . will cause an epic mess when you tilt it.  The stuff will actually squirt out all over the place.<br />2. Holds only a few ounces . . . epic stingy for even a 4 year old.<br />3.  Tried it with water first.  Tilted it and it leaked.  Reseated the cap . . . still dripped.  Opened and examined it, there was a little bump of plastic, I carved it off with a sharp knife.  Closed the lid and it didn't drip unless I turned it completely upside down.  I shook it . . . drips flew.  I laid it on the counter on its side.  The puddle was small . . but it did leak.<br />4.  Then I tried to drink.  Nothing, just drippy squirts.<br />5. So I read the directions and tried again.  I'm supposed to suck, mash with my upper lip, and drink.  Not only was there no improvement . . . it squirted out beside my lip.  It's really hard to drink out of this thing.<br />6.  I filled two of them with apple juice and tried them out on a 3 year old and a 5 year old.  Had to coach them a bit.  But they started sucking out the liquid.  Both kids figured out how to make the cup start to buzz, they though that was funny.
B002UXQRM0|5|This item is $6 at Walmart.  Not sure why price is so expensive here.  Great product.  Easy to clean, transport and my son (12 months) transitioned to it just fine.  Love the graphics.
B001RIY5UK|5|I have a flat door that I put this on..Its the door for the Nursery and this wall art peeled right off the paper and then I easily put it on the door.. no bubbles or anything..will be cute to write notes on such as sleeping prince do not disturb ;)
B0052QYLUM|3|The camera worked fine. Monitor pic was good. Easy to set up. Wish the monitor could be set to stay on if I want it to. But what I'm not happy with is that after 3 days of use the batter will not recharge. Can't find a replacement battery. Unfortunately the 3 days of use were spread out over 6 weeks so can't return item. [[ASIN:B0052QYLUM Infant Optics 2.4ghz Digital Video Baby Monitor. 2.4\\" display rechargeable portable monitor.

B002XIS6RG|4|Hoping the fabric was going to be more vibrant and maybe a little softer. Overall we're happy with the blanket.
B00AJSIW6C|5|I was a little concerned about putting together a car seat, would it be sturdy enough. It seems to be. My 3 year old granddaughter fit in it just fine. There seems to be plenty of room for growth. I also liked the cup holder with elastic, it will fit several sizes of drink bottles.
B008R2U0IK|1|the hope was to have soft sheets to lay my daughter down on instead of cool cotton one (think of how uncomfortable it would be to go from warm arms to a cold crib) but not with this product. it says that it's flannel but the sheet is so thin that it's translucent. maybe for the summer it would be okay but it should say that it's flannel
B00P7C8EVI|5|I absolutely love this! Will purchase another soon! My kids enjoy their stuffed animals and now are able to easily put them away in the storage hammock each night.
B00AM5NTIS|5|My daughter loves to eat out of the pouches, and these are a great alternative to the expensive disposable bags that are in the grocery store. We fix baby cereal and put it in the pouch for late night feedings. We have had one zipper pull off of the plastic, and I contacted the company. They answered quickly and are sending a replacement, which is great. I think it might have been partly my fault, though. I ran the bag under hot water and then pulled open the pouch. Now, I try to be more careful, and I try to make sure that my fingers hold on to each side of the plastic zipper as I pull the top open. I haven't had another pull off.<br />These were a great buy, and I would purchase them again. They are a bit pricey, but it's worth it to be able to reuse these.<br />Great product!
B0049E3PTG|5|My twin girls love their swaddles...very soft compared to the non fleece, true to size. Of course, it much easier to use then a traditional blanket and keeps calm for a longer period of time.
B006SFUDT4|5|Totally worth spending money on this :). it drains, sweeps up toys, and sticks well to the wall.  Keeps the shower clean!
B001LQCOIS|2|The Babycook was instantly one of my new favorite kitchen items when I first began pureeing for my daughter.  It works like it's supposed to.  You can \\"fix it and forget it\\" until you have time to go back and puree.  I've been making basic vegatable and meat purees for about 4 months now, and here is where the problems begin.  The pitcher (the clear thing in which you steam and puree the vegetables, etc.) is made of plastic.    There is also this disc like lid that you place inside the pitcher when you are pureeing.  Since the pitcher is NOT made of glass, like I would think it should be since the cost is so high (you can get cheaper baby food makers, I believe from Safety First and the magic bullet), the plastic bows and bends, so you can't always get a clean fit of the disc, and about 80% of the time, I can not get the pitcher to go on the stand the right way so that the machine will allow me to puree.  It is so annoying.    Also, there is this gasket piece which has already fallen off.  It has a replacement piece, but it's difficult to get it back in correctly so that the water used to steam does not leak out from the bottom of the pitcher.    I'd never pay the money for this again... so glad it was a gift!
B001DF67GC|1|This kick mat will not fit my car seat.  The velcro strap at the top is too lose around the headrest, so the top of the mat sags.  The bottom elastic strap is too tight to fit around my suburban's car seat.
B001IACJQ4|5|Great
B00FP1XKVK|5|Unusually hard to get the thing apart to install it, but due to that, no kid is ever gonna pull the plugs out. :-)
B001G4510I|5|I give 5 stars to this item just because of the final outcome. Baby Diego handles business in a very prompt and professional way. The original item shipped to me was in very bad condition. I wrote and email to Baby Diego and they called me promptly. Meri( the lady I spoke to) apologized right away and promised me a new item that they just got in stock. She sent me pictures and shipped it to me the next day before even waiting to receive the old item. I was really impressed by the way they handled the situation. I received the new Bathtub and Changer combo and it is amazing. We really enjoy it. It is different than the one ordered at the first time, but I can say it is very nice and practical.( much nicer than I was expecting)
B00006G963|5|This is by far the best mobile out there. My daughter is 7 months old and has loved this since she was 3 months. The colors are fabulous and there's so much to see as it goes around. At first, it may have been a little too stimulating, but now it works like a charm for naps. She smiles at them and &quot;talks&quot; to them/it then falls asleep when the music ends. It used to be one of the only things that would distract her and make her smile when crying or when I needed to get dressed etc. As w/all mobiles, I'll have to take it down when she can grab it. She loves to see it and grab it when we hold her up to it. The remote may not be too useful, but a couple of times it was helpful. No problems attaching it to the crib. I use the end rather than the side rails.<BR>We love it. Three of our friends have it too and love it.
B00BMJPEI6|5|We love the Sweet Peek Baby Monitor that we've been using for our older son, so we purchased an additional camera to put in our nursery for our baby due this month. This add-on camera works just like the first - and I am so happy we can see both boys in their rooms as they sleep!
B002NUWQUW|4|The size may have been a little too large for me, but it definitely allows for keeping your hands free.
B0090OM1F4|4|I received these in the mail today. I love the colors! The bows just needed a little bit of \\"fluffing\\". My only issue is with the sizes. Some will fit her head (she's 2 months), and some are clearly for a toddler. So I'm limited on which ones she can wear at this point. As of now, her head is 38.5cm (48% for 2 months), and the ones she can wear are just slightly loose. Though, she can indeed wear them. I also noticed that they do stretch out easily. So also keep that in mind.
B000P7WAII|4|i bought this chair thinking my baby would sit on it but i was soooo  wrong he doesen't like it at all maybe if it was cushioned or something ....anyways we don't use it it was easy for him to get out of the straps.
B008BFZA8I|5|We are very pleased with this product when we buy nor knew what was right, but surprised us ... Excellent quality product. Arrived very quick to Brazil. Thank you!
B006SFUEF2|5|Works great  my granddaughter loves it
B00GY8J8GO|5|Love it, now my grandson can travel with us.  He's able to operated the seat belt by himself (5 yrs old).
B009DHTBOW|5|Love this stroller especially after I modified it to work like the Plus (over twice the price when I purchased it).  Now that we just carry around the frame and attach the car seat to it, so much better and lighter!
B001UF8BL4|5|This is great for babies from 6 mo (suitable for younger), my daughter loves to grab onto this, it is easy for her to hold it, play with it, chew on it.  It rattles with the ball inside and is colorful and fun!  She has one for her cot and one that she takes with her for road trips!
B004GXA6J2|5|I bought the 2 pumps like this, and I love them. They plug into the wall or you can run them off of 3 aa batteries. (which really helps on vacations, or long periods of time in the car) batteries don't last weeks though, so I recommend using the outlet if you're around one.  My last pump with my other child was a medela and I love this one even more.  Other than batteries not lasting long, my only issue was after washing the bottles a few times, the wording came off of the bottles, even though I hand washed them. But this doesn't affect the products usage so I still gave 5 stars.  Great product for the price, especially considering i only plan on using them for a year, they will do the job.
B000E89BNU|2|I do like the stand up feature of the brush but the nipple brush is way too hard.  I have ripped through two nipples. Then I purchased the oxo brush which worked much better and also stands up.
B00FRPFJ5Y|3|I've been using this diaper bag for about 17 months and the benefits of having a backpack instead of a messenger bag have been proved over and over. The weight is better distributed, dads can use it and keep hands free, and this bag in particular has a decent layout of segregated pockets we liked.<br /><br />The Bag has a main pouch with two elastic inner pouches and one larger rear pouch. We used the elastic pouches for sunscreen, shades, baby tylenol, etc.-- anything we wouldn't want to get all over the rest of the bag or need occasional yet easy access to. Outside there are zippered pouches on either side of the main pouch that we used for formula/snacks/food pouches and spare bottles. The tiny top pocket was for spoons, pacifiers, A&D ointment etc. The front pouch, which had no fastener, was where diapers and changing pad went.<br /><br />Wipes went in the provided wipe pouch. This works great for disposable wipe packs, reusable containers didn't fit well at all.<br /><br />The major problem was where bottles are kept. The pocket has a foil lining which probably helped retain heat or something, but never seemed to make a difference. After a few months, the foil lining came out, and shortly after that, the pocket itself started to detach from the rest of the pack. We no longer need to open the pouch, we can just stuff the bottle into the ragged, frayed hole.<br /><br />The rest of the bag is in ok shape and has held up to minor cleanings here and there. The only other complaint I have would be that with our hurry up and go packing style (which is what I should have planned for from the beginning), the backpack takes on a teardrop shape that isn't terribly comfortable. The pack has no real structural integrity, just the shape of whatever's inside it. This means that it's like wearing a shopping bag on your back instead of a backpack -- fine for a while, but eventually annoying.
B00AWT8DIU|5|We tried several different pacis and my son loves this one. I really like the paci holders you can buy separately. I also like how the box it comes in is also used to sterilize them in the microwave. I would buy again. We used these to get my son to stop sucking his fingers. It worked.
B004NRP0X8|4|I wanted reusable nursing pads to use at night so that I wouldn't have to use so many disposable ones.  These are great - comfortable, breathable, and contains light leakage.  They're not as absorbent as disposable pads - but for use at home in the evenings, they're great.  These are way better than the Medela washable brand - don't get those, they don't absorb enough to stop any leakage.  The itzy ritzy ones are also great if you don't leak a lot and want to wear them during the day.  I wouldn't wear a tight t-shirt with these - but they don't show through if you're wearing a slightly loose t-shirt.
B00APDLBR8|5|These are perfect! Look good, peel off and re-stick easily
B001CFACMI|3|Won't stick to the tile in my shower, but holds OK on the glass door.  Handy for the handheld shower head.
B001V78WYW|3|This plate is a fun idea; it has a great orange color and when paired with the matching utensils can help encourage children to use utensils to eat.  Even though it's fun, keep in mind this also encourages playing with the food, and not always so much eating it.  It may be more fun pushing the food around the plate and the child might not actually be eating the food.  Regardless, it's cute and very durable- the plate can be dropped a bunch of times and not break, and it also sports rubber on the other side which helps it stay put on the table as opposed to sliding around when the child tries to use their fork.  However, the ridges in the plate mean that when you go to wash it in the sink water sprays all over unless you are very careful- it would be best for someone who has a dishwasher in my opinion.  I still use it and wash it, but I've been sprayed a few times and think I would use it more often if it weren't for having to be careful washing it and trying to get all of the food out of the creases.
B006Y3S838|1|A nightmare to re-assemble after taking it appart for cleaning.<br />Great idea but poor execution from Munchkin. I love their products but this one is by far their worse.<br />I found it very hard to pass the straw thru the hole back up to the top of the lid and then have it hook without bending out of the upper little part that allows it to &#34;pop&#34; out. It's not only time consuming but also frustrating trying to reassemble all the pieces after washing.
B002J4U8SO|4|I had been wanting to get my 4 month old daughter a toy car after I attended a meetup where there was a small toy car that really seemed to catch her attention during tummy time. I wanted something that made noise as it rolled. After researching online I found this car, but I was a little hesitant given some of the people in the reviews were disappointed that the car was really tiny. The reviews made it sound like the car was super tiny, I'm not sure how big their kids are but I think this car was the perfect size for our little girl, the noise it makes is great, not too loud, and the little colorful balls are just perfect!! She really enjoys watching the car during tummy time, also if you have wood floors, drive the car in reverse and it will roll forward on it's own, saddly it doesn't roll by itself on the carpet or on her play blanket well but that's fine it still drives fine if you move it with your hand. All in all it was a great buy, just what I was looking for, my daughter loves it!! Great for tummy time. :)
B0045Y1448|4|the first chair i got was not put together right. but it was easy to replace and new one is awsome
B000WUD83O|5|My baby loves this Jumperoo.  It's bulky so if you are tight on space that may be an issue, but other than that no complaints.
B0046EC004|4|Two complaints: the red screws tend to come out when the buggy is detached, at the risk of losing them. Keep it in mind if, as I do, sometimes you take the base off and carry it under the stroller (ej. If you leave a child somewhere and keep strolling the other). Second, my daughter tends to hit her head against the hand holds of the stroller when the pavement is a bit bumpy. Other than that, quite happy with product.
B0017T2RYU|5|We got this baby monitor for our first child and I didn't realize how fantastic it was until I started shopping for a dual monitor once we had our second child.  The absolute best feature about this monitor is the ability to choose voice activation mode.  This means that the receiver doesn't come on until the baby makes a noise.  This was absolutely essential for us because we use a white noise machine in the baby's room and without the voice activation, we'd hear the constant whooshing of the noise machine.  Now it only comes on once it picks up additional noise in the room.  Wonderful!    Now if only Sony would make a model that monitors two different rooms at the same time, I'd be happy.  We bought another brand for the second child, and that one doesn't have voice activation, so we're going crazy with the noise.
B00MV4JH98|5|I purchased this item. I am satisfied with this item, it just gets pressed on the window and it sticks well. The kids love it, as it stops the sun from shining directly on them. I was so surprised, the car doesn't get as hot now with this.
B00ESQ3310|3|I mean, it's a bucket of plastic bags. It's convenient, sure, but not sure the bags trap smell any better than a regular bag. It's not prohibitively expensive but if you have just a small garbage can you can out next to your diaper changing station that would be just as convenient.
B00MO099EW|5|I was having issues with the suction on my pump and figured that I may need to replace the tubes and flanges. After looking at the cost of replacing these through Medela, I decided to look to Amazon for a cheaper alternative. These are just as good as the Medela brand and the fact that I have an extra set of tubing and flanges is a good selling point. These definitely improved the suction of my pump. I am very satisfied with my purchase!
B00B91FOB4|5|This step stool is so adorable.  Top of the Step looks like home base with the Yankee logos in front.  Stirdy and too Cute.  My husband loved it.
B003Y3BH3O|5|We use one of these on our stroller and attach a toy.  No more worrying about toys being dropped on the ground!
B00QL7OB38|5|Love these bibs!  The colors and patterns are great, and I love that there are two snaps, so they will continue to fit as my boy grows.  The backing is super soft, too!  I also like the longer, narrower look as opposed to the short, wide ones. Just more fashionable I think. Great for babies of all ages!!
B000C3QG1C|1|this was supposed to be the one that was 32\\" wide and came 18\\" wide for the same price, we're returning both of them
B008RYQBQI|5|Aaa+
B008D1O8TM|5|I've been nursing my baby for 6 months now and these are my favorite nursing pads. The hold so much liquid it's shocking sometimes. I can go an entire day with one set of pads and don't have to worry about leakage. The other major brands didn't even hold up for a few hours.
B0092NNQ98|2|I got this for my  3m old son. Although it seem to fit his body fine, he wasn't able to sit up by himself without assistance. I thought by the 5th month when he should be, it probably won't fit his body so it's not very practical. Also because he is long in height, he seem like he will tip over easily even with the straps on. I didn't feel comfortable him using this without any supervises so I would not recommend this
B007UKIKYQ|5|Okay, if you looking for a high quality stroller that steers well with only one hand and pushes well with a good amount of storage...look no more. We live in Europe and there are many small roads with cobblestrone streets, narrow walkways, lack of sidewalks.  The small elevators and lack of ramps this stroller tackled both.  It also fold pretty flat and isn't too heavy to carry.<br /><br />I was worried about my 2.5 year old not fitting too well (we borrowed my friends city mini) and I think he has more room in this stroller (foot and head).  Also it seems like the actual seat (where his butt sits) and where his feet rest is a bit deeper than the mini. To be honest the strollers are almost identical, but I do think this is easier access to under storage (especially with the zippers).  I didn't think I'd use the front zipper so much, but I love it!  In fact, the storage on the bottom is so large my 2.5year old slide though the front access and into the bottom storage. So maybe the Britax is better. I also borrowed My other friend's sit and stand...that was okay, but the kids couldn't recline and it was a bit harder to steer.<br /><br />We tested it with our four month old (18lbs) and 2.5 year old(36lbs,37inches) over cobblestone streets and it handles SO well.  It didn't get stuck it made it all the turns.  It didn't pull too much in one direction over the other and the front access storage was handy.  There was also a good amount of storage in the back zippers. It did pull a little bit with my 36lbs son there all by his self.  I didn't go and try to shop aroung clothing racks because doing that with two kids is pretty crazy anyways, but it's about the width of a very large man.<br />Pros:<br />double everything (canopies, zippers, front seat access, reclining<br />Seperate seats ( almost full reclining, hoods,less pestering)<br />Easy smooth steering (can be done with one hand)<br />Fits in small space<br />thin folding<br />good quality everything (should last a long time)<br />When my 2.5 year old grows four more inches we'll see how well he fits the but he has some more time<br /><br />Cons:<br />No cup storage for anyone (must buy seperate)<br />Collapses fast and does slam to the ground<br />Two hand close
B00IOGIO5U|2|Does not snap securely on to the table chair, and my 11 month old son can reach the front of it and take it off, dumping food all over. Returned!
B004DFO57M|5|Both my sister and I have newborns and can say hands down that this is the best tool to trim their nails.
B006ZVV0R0|5|We put this is our Britax B-Agile Double (with the seat as far back as it goes) for our newborn.  She has been safe and comfy in there since she was just a few weeks old.  It has really helped since our car seat (Chicco) doesn't fit in the B-Agile Double.
B004GXA6ME|5|I was a little nervous about getting this booster seat because the color looks kinda light but when it arrived the color was just perfect and the assembly wasn't too hard. Overall it was great!
B00LLJIHT0|5|These are awesome. Boa free and dishwasher safe is a double win in my book. Plus they actually catch good because they are floppy cloth.
B00008E1OB|2|It seems as though we had all the same problems as everyone else with the product.  Appears cheap, manufacture defects, the diaper genie NOT fitting, mal fitting screws/cams, and a ripped changing pad.  But what we had that no one else has mentioned is the knob for the drawer was not drilled through (yeah, lots of fun to drill through MDF..) and the kicker is once it was all put together, the drawer did not close.  Not even close.  So, what do you do?? Send it back and pay all that S&amp;H? Take it apart (4 hours of our life we will never get back)?  We are still undecided.  Hind sight....I'd pay the extra money and get one already assembled or one we could buy in a store!
B0007VU4JY|2|I bought 2 of these for my Twins Grandchildren.  They are OK but the lining is not padded enough and the sides of the lining pop out.  There is a strip of elastic that holds it in place and it will not stay down.  I wish now I had spent a little more money and bought more expensive carseats.
B005QPE0W8|5|Great pacifier. Stays in my baby's mouth easier than the hospital ones because of the shape that conforms to the face.
B00Q7K6KZQ|5|Love these little bags. They are cute and perfect for on the go parent or kid. I bought several and use them not only for my kids snack but for crayons, little toys and my basic first aid kit. The bag washes with ease.
B00648KZ7K|5|I love this bib.  I received one as a shower gift and decided I needed another to carry in the diaper bag too.  Its great because you can just wipe it off or wash in the dishwasher.  You don't have to worry about it staining.  It also has a lip at the bottom to catch crumbs from baby
B00BWIPC6G|4|Well, he's sleeping in it a bit when we're away. It will take some getting used to yet. What I love: leaving the pack and play suitcase behind and throwing this in with our clothes instead. Less luggage = better. Plus, he really has fun playing in it when we get to our destination. Self-entertainment = awesome.
B0010SGZEG|5|I bought this a gift for my 2 nieces (at that time 9 months old). The designs are adorable and they enjoy playing with them anytime, bath time or not!
B00GJGAH6Q|5|Our baby has played more with the bunny than with the teething ring, but that's okay with us. She munches on the bunny and we can throw it in the washer to get clean again. Very convenient. The teething ring hasn't gone over that much I must say, but that's ok with us. She loves the bunny and we are getting great use out of this toy.
B001IXYOD2|5|These are truly great bottles for breastfeeding moms.  My son had no problems latching on to me to nurse and only 3 days later started taking Dr. Brown's bottles as well.  The only downside to the bottles is keeping the parts clean.  There are a LOT of parts to keep clean, but the upside is that they do reduce gas intake when feeding.  We also purchased the Dr. Browns microwave sterilizer and it works nicely.  The bottles also fit in our dishwasher and the smaller pieces fit in our munchkin dishwasher rack to be cleaned that way as well.  I just purchased more Dr. Browns bottles in anticipation of going back to work and sending bottles to daycare.  We opted for the plastic Dr. Browns bottles as we didn't see the need for the glass bottles.  I don't hesitate to brag about them!
B00B553D8A|4|Very cute. And well-made.
B005FWCEGG|5|Brilliant idea and well made. Wish it folded even smaller so I could keep it in the diaper bag.
B00734YC7I|5|These were the best buy ever!  My son wears them all of the time--and always gets comments from people about them!  Great value for the price too!  Great conversation piece!
B002SW4GDA|5|My baby who is 16 month old uses the services of physical therapy and occupational therapy. This playmat is very useful to us during her therapy. The space is big enough to fit in my baby and two adults. It is easy to clean and I also receive many compliments on this mat, it goes very well with the contemporary look of our house.
B004L2JJAA|5|I was looking fot his one since a long time ago and now i have it am am very happy
B004PBJNLW|5|I've researched a ridiculous amount trying to find a bento-style snack container for my daughter to take to preschool.  She is 2.5 and cannot easily open containers and I didn't want her to have to rely on a teacher being available to open something for her.  This container is great.  It's small and easy to open.  She can take the entire top off, or just open one side for a quick snack.  I pack her fruit, some chips or crackers, and cheese with plenty of room to spare.  It fits easily into her lunchbag with a juice box.
B009EDSWJA|3|This seems like a good product although I haven't used if yet. My disappointment is that when the package arrived, it didn't actually come with the strap to attach to furniture or the wood screw, as advertised. But I will just make the necessary adjustments myself to avoid returning it.
B001LK7EAM|5|MY DAUGHTER LOVES THIS BAG FOR HER BABY ITS ALSO WATER PROOF. I RECOMMEND THIS BAG FOR MOMS. IT HAS STORAGE COMPARTMENTS AND IS VERY LIGHT WEIGHT AND PRETTY.
B00KY3ESRO|3|In the Florida humidity it doesn't cool the air too much but that is to be expected. In a dryer climate it would be amazing! All in all it is a great hand held option which is safe for our daughter not to get her fingers caught in and worked well in this July heat. Customer service was fantastic as well with quick shipping and a callback to ensure satisfaction.
B002SRDQKE|5|Basicamente es genial, puede entrar todo lo que el bebe necesita y mantiene las temperaturas por buen tiempo, es super espaciosa.
B002ECE0P8|4|Simple, cute toy. Great colors, easy to just throw in your diaper bag and go. Too hard to use as a teether, my daughter sill enjoys putting them in her mouth though.
B002909R7G|5|Perfect size and went beautifully with the decor of our new bundle of joy room!
B007HO4U08|3|We bought this car seat, as a light-weight, travel seat.  Unfortunately, it doesn't fit either of our kids right. There are only two slot heights for the straps.  The top straps are already too low for my 3 year old.  However, he is two young/under 40 pounds, so he cannot use it as a booster seat yet.  Just to try it out, I tried my 20 month old (he normally rides rear facing, so this seat is not for him), and he was already too tall for the lower straps.  The top straps are above his shoulders, but probably too far above his shoulders (not that he should be riding in it under 2 years old anyways.)  With that said, this seat would probably work for a two year old and a four year old, but I wouldn't recommend it for tall three year old's that are too young and/or light for a booster.  It makes me thankful that for their regular car seats we invested in seats with high weight/height limits, with lots of flexibility.  If you are looking for a full-time car seat, it is worth it to spend more money on more options.
B00005JIVI|5|As a first time mom, I was very nervous about bath time. The safer bather is the best. The baby doesn't move around at all, and she is comfortable throughout the bath. It is easy to wash and drys very quickly. It is well worth the money. I would recommend it for all moms.
B00BPYXVO2|5|I have the lalaloopsy chair for my daughter and I needed to find one for my son so I chose this one.  Both of them love it.  It seems like a tough little chair, I hope it lasts as long as my daughters has, it seems like the same material and build
B00005BN7V|3|When we first tried our daughter on sippy cups with valves she didn't understand them and wouldn't suck on spout to drink. If we took the valve out of those cups, is was a free for all spill. These cups were suggested by our pediatrician and made a great transition cup. Because they were made to resist leaking without a valve, the spills were less. But because they didn't require her to suck on the spout, she started to understand what the cup was for. Once we weaned her off the bottle, we moved to the nicer sippy cups with valves. We still keep some of these on hand for emergencies.
B004EMCFJO|4|My mother-in-law bought this for us as a gift, and this was actually the first sippy cup my son could really use. He was about 8 months old, and it was easier for him initially to suck on the wide \\"nipple\\" of this trainer bottle than figure out the other styles of sippies. The downside (and why I'm giving it 4 stars) is that there's no type of flow valve. That's why he can drink from it so easily, but it also lets liquid flow pretty steadily out of the nipple if knocked over against anything or onto the floor.
B0078A8HH8|3|So-So.  Sank to the bottom of the toy basket despite having several grandchildren that are of the right age that had access to play with them.
B003EG90K8|5|My baby is already 10 months old and she is still enjoying this beautiful Mobile. She loves the little birds, the colors and the music; when she hears it she knows it´s time for a nap or to go to sleep at night. The music lasts long enough. I hung this mobile over her crib with a long nylon cord from the ceiling so it´s not too close for her to touch but close enough for her to admire. I would definitely purchase it again!
B000YDDF6O|5|My daughter loves this toy still, after 3 months. Cute colors. Cute songs.
B00856QSL6|5|works
B006RDQJL8|3|These decals are very cute, however, they do not stick to the wall very well.  I have had much better luck with other decals. I will not be able to place these anywhere near the crib because these could be a choking hazard if they fall into the crib.
B006OTD9WC|5|crystal and thats a great thing for me the old ones i had had a lot of static and with these i hear just what i need to hear and thats my kids
B00I0P7PXW|4|This is a great bag to use as a regular purse while keeping a few baby/child essentials handy. It's comfortable to carry as a messenger, and I get compliments frequently from people who think it's just a purse. It would be a bit bulky to use as a diaper bag only as it's not that big and would need to be packed pretty tightly.
B000XT30G4|2|My wife bought this - hence the lack of a Verified Purchase tag on this review. I was not impressed.<br /><br />The gate I received was warped to the point that I could only use three of the four adjustable stand-outs when placing it in the door frame Despite the door frame being generously wide (it's an open entry from the den to the foyer), this just barely fit with one extension added. The warping of the frame probably contributed to that.<br /><br />The gate opens by pressing back on a switch and lifting the gate to swing it. The lift and swing operation is dicey at best. It is not smooth, and requires some juggling to get it to work at all. I don't think this is a function of the warping. I think it is just poor design and a poor fit at the closure mechanism. Most of the closure mechanism is plastic, so it will certainly break in time ... meaning that I will have to jury-rig a new solution at that time.<br /><br />Additionally, the gate I received does NOT \\"auto-close\\". The door closure simply bangs against the latch assembly on the gate. I must forcibly press on the door at the latch, holding on to both the door and the gate, to get it to close.<br /><br />The whole thing is so cumbersome that I decided to live with it rather than try to pack it back up to ship back to Amazon, which is the ONLY reason why I'm sticking with this product ... and if I get too tired of the swinging operation inside of 30 days, I might even change my mind about that.<br /><br />Not recommended.
B000F1O8T8|1|I have the larger step stool version of this seat, that my son has been using for over a year now and it is wonderful so I thought I would give this a try and it does not fit very well on toilet seats, even pushed all the way back like the directions say.  The hole opening is very small, almost looks like it would work for an infant, not a potty training toddler.  The seat with the step made by this company is totally different, has a wider hole and a cushier seat and fits very well on the toilet.  But when you push this to the back it leaves a large gap in front and nothing supporting the front end of the seat.  I didn't even let my son try it, it did not look safe or sturdy.
B0053YP9EK|5|Gift for my daughters first baby, not used yet.  Baby due April 2nd.  Never used this brand but will soon see how they hold up.
B006NTY1HU|5|So happy I purchased this play yard for our 1st baby!!!! It helped me get things done while my baby was in eyes distance and I could get to her easily! It is a bit tough to maneuver and feels like it will break when you bend the walls but it won't and has held up now for the past 8 months since purchase!
B00QLGH6HC|5|I bought this little set for my 4 month niece. she looked absolutely adorable and yummy in them! i would def recommend! if you child has chubbier feet or a larger head just let the seller know so they can adjust the head and feet piece properly. XO
B005ERHKT8|5|was much larger than expected, will last for many years.
B00K5KVC52|4|I have read the reviews and so far I have not experienced any leaking. I read the directions and it said to squeeze the vent and it has been working just fine. The colors are great which is honestly what drew me to these bottles but the flow seems to be a little fast. I've been trying to find a true slow flow nipple and these are slower than most of the other bottles I tried but still on the fast side for a 7 week old.
B004JTTGOY|5|Bought this for my granddaughter, the original escape artist. She can get out of anything, except this. Really useful for keeping track of her in large crowds. Allows her to feel free without actually being free. She loves the penguin. Wish the \\"pocket\\" was a little larger so that she could put her bunny blanket in it, but overall a great product that doesn't make your child look like a dog on a leash.
B009UPUC36|5|Good night light. 2 year old son likes it. He can turn it on by himself. It stays on long enough for him to fall asleep most nights, but he is able to turn it back on when he needs it. Plastic does not get hot at all, and it seems pretty durable. Light weight and he has fun holding it and carrying it by the handle. I would definitely recommend.
B00AHVR4JW|4|A high quality stroller, smooth ride, attractive, and works without a hitch with the Click Connect carseat. Large basket for storing our junk. Good parent cupholders aren't too shallow to hold onto my vital coffee mug (which is sealed so it doesn't jump out onto my baby - I wouldn't recommend open cups of hot liquids in a stroller!). And its purple. I love purple. :)<br /><br />Notes:<br />*DOES NOT WORK WELL WITH OLD GRACO CAR SEATS<br />*I wish it had a handle or somewhere to lift it from the side when its folded, so I didn't pinch myself as I put it in the trunk. Its tricky and pretty heavy. However, I love everything else about it so I deal.
B003OBYTO0|5|I love this seat, it's very durable and it love the design , how you can fold away the seat so it is camouflage when not in use.
B000JIHP88|5|Our baby loves it. The different sounds it makes is wonderful. She doesn't get bored with just one sound. Delivery was great
B000F1MUKM|4|It works okay but the small gate does not latch at the top,only at bottom, something isn't adjusted right.
B00V0VQK1G|5|This was a great buy and is very well made! Love the colors too!
B00006IJRU|2|I bought this bottle and loved it my one week old seems to love the nipple the only thing is the bottles are all leaking out the bottom so they are useless I am writing the company to see why they are leaking.I have only been using them a week and they are already broke so dont waste your money.
B0001NE8OA|1|I had to hide my diaper genie away next to the trash can in the pantry - it stunk from diaper no. one plus its difficult to hold the baby in your arms and with a free hand push a dirty diaper into the thing, then twist the top to seal it off... ewe - not worth the money, not worth the effort - I save all my plastic grocery bags and grab one for each dirty diaper, knot it, and throw it in the trash can - easier &amp; cheaper!!
B009K8NFG4|5|Perfect soft seat for my toddler boy. The higher than average splash guard works well at preventing tinkles from going on the floor. Also the soft seat does not feel quite as cold in the mornings as the hard plastic seats. Fits my toilet perfectly and the contoured design helps keeps my tot from easily sliding off the seat. He feels comfortable while sitting on this potty seat.
B001DF4OPI|3|I bought this cover because it is really light weight and it is easy to put on the high chair even with a baby in my arms.  However, it slips and slides and doesn't stay put over the chair.  Most of the time, the velco doesn't work because the chairs have wood rails blocking it.  It works sometimes, but it isn't perfect.  I guess is is better than nothing, and better than lugging a huge high chair cover around with me.
B00II6QO8A|5|Just what I needed for a good price!
B004G8QT5C|5|I read many of the reviews on this seat and decided it was this one or move on to the really expensive Britax ones.  Well, I am very satisfied with this seat and have no real complaints just a few nitpicks.  I am in rear facing mode right now as this is our first upgrade from the infant seat.  I think another review mentioned that this seat isn't the most level rear facing, and that's true.  I started with a towel but I am going to move to a noodle soon since when she falls asleep my daughter's head is going forward.  This is minor nitpick though, since it could easily be positioned with a towel and every backseat is different in terms of how sloped it is.  This is in the back of an 07 Accord, and without support it would pitch forward quite a bit.  The good news is that when it is forward facing it will work flawlessly, but for now a small amount of effort is required to position it properly.      The belt tightening system is one of the major draws of this seat.  It is extremely fast and easy to put your child in and remove them at the end.  I can't imagine an easier way to tighten and release the shoulder straps and you can feel very confident that it is not too loose like parents are likely to do for fear of hurting their child.  When you can't crank it another click without resistance, you know it's good.    The other major draw for me is how padded the seat is.  It's got a lot of foam and then a pad that goes over the top (which should make cleaning easy also).  The side impact testing thing has got to be marketing, but it appears to be very comfortable.  I feel good about my child riding in this seat on extended trips.  She's not ready for the cup holder but that's probably a great addition as well, although the directions state you shouldn't put any kind of cup in there except styrofoam (?).    It was a little difficult to get the seat into the car using the latch system.  It is VERY secure but I wouldn't want to move it around very often.  So I wouldn't recommend this as swap back and forth seat.  When it is used for smaller/younger children you have to turn the straps around; the directions weren't the greatest but I was able to figure it out using the pictures.  The way the latch straps go behind the crotch strap didn't seem intuitive and I had to move them after the first attempt.  But the picture makes that part clear so that's how I set it up.  Removing the outer pad was pretty easy with its little plastic clips.  They didn't seem flimsy, but were pliable enough to make removing the seat pretty easy.    Overall, good quality and it was what I expected.
B007L7FKN2|5|My son loves this and 6 months later, we've only changed the batteries once after nightly usage.
B00SRK5FCI|5|This is the best toilet seat I've purchased. I am a grandma and have two young grandchildren who were slipping and sliding around on another seat I used in my upstairs bathroom. The Cozy Green Toilet Trainer stays securely in place even with wiggly young ones. The handy suction hook that comes with it keeps it out of sight and stored until my grandchildren visit again. I love it and will probably purchase a second one!
B0001X0DTO|3|It's cute a little smaller then I expected. But a good buy for the money.
B001JKTZOM|5|My daughter absolutely loves her butterfly crib bumper.  She points and touches the butterflies, and sometimes try to talk to them.  I like the soft soothing lavender and pink color combination.  The color doesn't fade after washing, which I am happy about.  I am truly pleased with this product.
B00AUIZG06|5|Very easy to use ..
B003AJHDQW|5|These are very thick and soft and they work well as burp cloths. They get softer with each wash and they are a perfect size to place on your shoulder. I buy them for my girlfriends to use as thicker more absorbent burp cloth.
B009WDYS22|5|I got this as a baby present for my bother and sis'n'laws' first baby. My brother wanted this one and not the new one at Walmart, we were so happy I could order it on Amazon and ship it for free. I also ordered the crib set and it was sold for the same as Walmart before they ran out of stock and not an expanded price like some sites. They loved it so much he wouldn't wait to put it on the portacrib they will keep in their room, instead he put it in the baby's crib. They are going with two different themes and that is the one he wanted since it is to be a boy, the other is a Jungle Theme from NoJo which I've ordered  the bumper as well.<br /><br />They were really pleased to get it so fast and as I am disabled but have prime, the free 2day shipping was a sweet bonus!
B0029UYVC2|3|I bought the entire set: crib bedding, lamp, hamper, mobile, blanket and a lamp. ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT! All this baby stuff is definitely overpriced, but it's such a joy to buy it. LOL>Looks very expensive.<br /><br />I only wish the mobile was an electronic one where you can turn it on to play lullaby instead of restarting it manually every 2 minutes..Well, at least that's enough for me to run into the kitchen and get some strong coffee :)))) I especially like that it's not pink since we got so much pink stuff for our girl. There's just enough for my other pink things to match.<br /><br />I actually bought all of these items at Kohls since I had that Kohls Cash to use and they were on sale. Site to Store shipping was free. The hamper was the only item I got though Amazon (baby registry). LOVE IT ALL!
B005C9ODQ6|2|This carrier is great - if you can manage to get it on and off.  The process of getting it all set up is such a pain, I wish a never would have purchased it.  Getting it set up is a two person job.  The straps are long, and will drag on the ground when tying it.  Must be good at tying knots blind or have an assistant for set up.<br /><br />Once the carrier is in place, the child will slide down frequently into a crumpled ball at the bottom tie.  This can be somewhat amended by tying the straps tighter, but I fear this may be uncomfortable for baby.  Taking the carrier off is again another two person job.<br /><br />For set up and take-down, I give it 1 star. For use after set up, I give it 3 stars.  Thus the 2 star score.  I have no idea why this product is so highly rated.  Try something else and save yourself the headache.
B00L74F7KG|4|Great pillow, high quality, and nice for travel
B002YQPDFK|5|After a \\"European\\" style bathtub revolt, we got this inflatable one. Our 8 month old loved it! I love that it hangs on the tub wall and stays clean and dry.  It's great for two babies, and we used it as a portable swimming pool for the heat wave in Virginia this summer. We popped our 9 month old and 16 month old cousin in there with cool water and they had a blast. Great purchase! Would highly recommend.  How we use it? We stick it in our adult tub and we sit at the end of the adult tub, with our legs extending over the sides of the inflatable tub. Actually, I usually just stick my feet in :-)
B00D9FRJXY|5|super soft
B003VNKLFW|4|My daughter loves her new &#34;big girl seat&#34;.  It is sturdy and the colors are nice.  The only thing I would like to see is more height adjustment options.  It only has two height settings.  Other than that, it's great!
B000096QDC|3|The suction cup is not that great. Keeps falling off the window.
B000NBQZ32|2|First off, yes, the presentation is quite striking; however, when one exposes the seedy underbelly of this gift basket, it reveals an entirely different story. I would approximate that 60% of this basket is what one would consider &#34;authentic&#34; (ie. the Ghirardelli chocolate). Contrarily, the other 40% leaves much to be desired. While the website does admit to the &#34;Sunkist Gems&#34; being an item in the basket, I felt somewhat betrayed by visually enticing packaging that conjures images of truffles and other &#34;decadent&#34; treats -- only to find plastic-wrapped Sunkist gummies that look like Halloween leftovers. Additionally, some of the other packaging appears to be from a bulk warehouse somewhere in China. My boyfriend and I created a game out of the gift basket, with the central premise of discovering whether each item was for canine or human consumption. Once you break free of the exterior packaging, the interior labelling is grotesque, at best, and the treats inside barely edible (here's looking at you, &#34;lemon zest cookies&#34;!). The only reason I did not give this basket a mere 1-star was that the website did disclose the contents of the package forthrightly. It was only as the receiving customer that my disappointment did creep forth.... $45 worth? Not hardly.
B002J4UAHS|5|I purchased 2 of these because i liked the stackable idea and also because these containers could be used for other things than just formula. My husband was a little hesitant that i spent $17 on each one, but i wanted to give it a try and now he recommends them to friends at work!  They are so useful because i can put measured formula, yogurt, cheerios, fruit, cheese, food you name it. I can make stacks of 2, 3 or 4 and they dont take that much space in my diaper bag. I prepare my baby's food, so these have also worked for freezing food for when we go out for the day, because i can pop them in the microwave, heat them and they stay warm for a while. I love the fact that i can move them (stack) around depending on what i am using first or what i have already used.   I have gotten so many compliments because they are a neat little thing. I got mine back in November 2009 when my baby started eating cereal and right now he is 14 months old and I still use them.     Great buy!!
B00IP89MNA|5|2 out of my 3 grand children love these things.  I have a few extra around the house just in case.
B000GB0NZK|5|These are so handy and worked well for all 3 of my kids!
B00H7CU5NQ|5|This bag was perfect! My daughter loves it! She can fit her basketball uniforms and basketball in the bag. My daughter loves hello kitty and being able to carry her basketball items in there put the icing on the cake!
B004IEBOZ4|5|This stroller was an exceptional value purchased for a needy person who had twins.  She is very happy and grateful for receiving this product.
B001AWEDCS|5|This tub is pretty solid even though it's also very light. It's well designed to be comfortable for the baby. The first 10 or so times my daughter got a bath she cried, but now she loves loves it! My wife usually puts her in and then pours water over her instead of dunking her in the water. That method works good because then you can rinse the baby off and there won't be too much water in the tub when you do that. 5 stars, I cant imagine giving my baby a bath without it!
B000F1QIZK|3|Not easy to move around as at that age babies done't have good coordination.
B00PNKAY30|5|I bought these as a substitute to wash cloths, for my own use, to conserve water (it takes less water to rinse them out, and to wash in the washing machine, than regular size wash cloths).  They are soft, just the right size, and have the additional, unforeseen benefit of using about half as much soap as regular wash cloths.  It took about a month for them to arrive from China, but I don't even use the far smaller and thinner ones I received in a couple days from a domestic source.
B000FFL58Q|5|Baby loves his Rainforest buddies, lights and music. Yanks on all toys and enjoys pulling on stuff on the bottom now that he is able to turn over on to his stomach. We really like the motion activated feature.
B0098YTBCW|2|Had a hole in netting and did not fit my car seat. I returned it as soon as I got it. And then I saw it in babies r us the next day so I suggest going to the store and buying it so you can return it if it doesn't fit.
B005EGXI1S|5|I purchased this crib sheet for the Dream On Me 3\\" Foam Graco Pack 'n Play Mattress.  It fits perfectly and is still soft for my 7 month old.
B00Q9VY20I|4|This bag is such a great size! I feel like I can endlessly stuff things into it!<br /><br />I wish there were more smaller compartments to better organize my small items for the kids but that's about it! Also that darn insulated water pouch! What is supposed to actually fit in it? I haven't successfully fit a water bottle in that thing even once!
B000056HNZ|5|it is silent, no pain, you will get a lot of milk, it is convinient <br />it is almost perfect
B006P05S42|2|The corner design works well in our bathtub, but the suction cups do not stay in place no matter how carefully you place them, and we have a regular tub and surround, no fancy or unusual materials.
B002DS8UFE|1|it wasn't what I expected I didn't like it they didn't meet my standards it wasn't what I orderd very upset
B00CISTACQ|5|We used this little feeder almost daily from about 6-8 months.  Now at 12 months I use it occasionally when I don't feel like chopping food up into tiny pieces.  From day one of using this feeder my baby was awesome at getting this to her mouth and sucking out the food.  Some of our favorite foods in the feeder were sweet potatoes, bananas, avocados, and other fruits and veggies with a squishy texture.  Apples and other hard foods did not work so well, it would just frustrate my baby that she couldn't get the food out.  This is cleaner than most methods of feeding, but it can still get messy if baby likes to bang the feeder to get the food to the top.  Food will splatter everywhere.  Also, the silicone does stain with certain foods.  This doesn't really change the integrity of the product, it just isn't as aesthetically pleasing.  The feeder part seems to be the perfect size.  It fits well in baby's mouth (not too big or small), but not very much food fits in it at once, so you will have to refill it a few times if you can finagle it away from your baby for long enough.
B00F2MQDQ6|2|My daughter likes this toy but it did not say suctioned to the high chair or any other item for more than a few seconds.
B00IBO5O6W|4|It's smaller than I expected.  Works good in the areas of the tub it actually covers.
B000O7YOUQ|5|Perfect! Color and fabric texture were spot on.
B000PAO3QW|4|They dont hold my 8 month old sons attention very well. They are cute though. Maybe in a few months he'll get the idea of stacking them.
B007BEIKGO|5|My baby slept through Jurrasic Park and a loud concert with these!
B00FZGLNVO|5|My newborn adapted to this pacifier very well. No complaints. Received blue & green colored ones with cute Dino & lion on them
B000OFT7OG|5|I am so pleased with these diapers.  I have been using them now for 3 months and they are great.  I have Fuzzi Bunz diapers also, but found that if you want your husband to change some diapers having the velcro ones assures that.<br />I ordered some Mother Eze diapers too (the number 1 rated diaper)  but think that BumGenius got robbed of that title.  Bum Genius is simple and one size fits all works like a charm.  Although a little big for my little ones bottom the first month (6lbs), they work great now. I did a lot of research and this diaper is the way to go!!
B006GCRX06|5|[[VIDEOID:a86428cd8e42dc89f350f75d17662b97]] Al is the cutest! The toy is bigger than I expected and while it's light in weight, it's too  big for my 3 month old baby to pick up. However, great as a 'Grow with me toy'! It's 2 different fabrics and it crinkles, Rattles, teether, and squeaks. The shapes, colors, and feel is great for sensory learning. Not to mention the price is great! Please watch the video for a more in depth review of 'Al' :)  *Sample provided in exchange for 100% honest review
B00KM60D3Q|4|Our original slim and secure model finally broke after two years and we purchased this through Summer's loyalty program for $125.  I love the 2 way talk and pan zoom feature.  Daylight video quality is very clear- night vision is not as clear as the slim and secure model.
B002SG5PSQ|5|I really like this wrap, and so does my son! I just got it last week, and have used it 3 times now. My husband helped me put it on the first time, as it looks a little intimidating, but had no problems putting it on by myself the other times! I took the recommendations of other reviewers and put it on before leaving the house, for ease of use and for sanitary reasons (you dont want this dragging on the ground and then wrapping baby up in it!). So far Ive taken baby to the mall, and to the movie theaters and he loves being close and snuggly to me. This has also been great to use around the house because my son like to be held a lot, and I am able to put him in the moby and get some things done. I am glad I got this wrap- almost didnt because of the fabric length, and it seemed a little bit intimidating- but it is easy to get the hang of, and there are online videos that can help and it comes with a booklet also. GREAT WRAP!!!
B000GAYYCE|1|It only took 2 weeks for the velcro adhesive to fail and the entire organizer fell to the ground.  I did not overload the organizer at all.  Do not buy this if you need to attach with the dresser top option.  I also agree with previous reviews regarding how the pockets sag.
B002TKM35Y|5|That's what this diaper bag is fine crafted with.  Not only does it have tons of storage, it has pockets that are the right size and in the right place.  You know what I mean - you've got a pack of wipes and 6 diapers, and none of the pockets fit right?  Not in this bag.  My number one favorite thing about this bag is the diaper dispenser.  Yes, dispenser.  No more will you have dirty, crunched up diapers.  I've got about 15 in the dispenser, no problem.  There is a pocket designed for wipes.  It comes with a plastic wipe dispenser, but I just buy the wipe pouches with pop open tops (not the tubs), and shove those in the dispenser.  I can open the wipes without removing the package.      Here is what I have crammed in this bag as we speak.  15 diapers, package of wipes, six assorted tubes of makes up (lipstick, mascara, etc), giant wallet, gum, long sleeve outfits for my 2 month old, two year old, and three year old, one each, lotion, pacifier wipes, 2 pacis, two coloring books, two packs of crayons, 2 board books, two story books, 2 drinking cups for the older ones (open top), sunglasses, 15 disposable bibs, small first aid kit, comb, hair accessories, hand sanitizer, bottle of lotion, travel bottle of 409, 10 disposable changing pads, big changing pad (came with bag), empty bag for dirty laundry, and my nook.  There is still some spare room in the top for a baby toy or stuffed animal.  It also holds up to six 8 ounce bottles.  Or, for me, four bottles with an ice pack.  I have to take the ice because it's breastmilk, otherwise I could probably just cram my Dr Pepper in there, too.  Best of all - this stuff is all organized, and I can put my hands on it without taking anything out of the bag.  I am prepared for an afternoon away, no matter what.    There are two small things I can nitpick, in case the designers read this.  It doesn't affect my 5 star rating, though.  There is some wasted space in the top of the bag.  I can set a stuffed animal on it, but it would fall out when I opened the bag to change the baby.  If there were some kind of stuffable pouch, this might solve it.  Second, the DVD front panel could be a bit more versatile.  It is pretty flat, only big enough for a dvd player, and not even big enough for my wallet.  However, I've got 2 small coloring books and 2 8-packs of crayons in there, so it is certainly not useless.      The bonus feature for me is the padded front pocket.  It is the perfect size for my nook in its neoprene slip cover thingie.  It's one of those things I don't always carry with me, because I don't feel it's protected in a diaper bag, but this pocket seems designed for something like this.  I also like the elastic mesh pocket on the straps - perfect for my van keys.  The outside elastic pockets are also tight enough that you can actually use them without something falling out.  The bag also looks super easy to clean - just wipe it down.    I can't recommend this bag enough, especially if you've got several small kids.  Mine are all 3 and under, so we need stuff.  Lots of stuff.  I definitely couldn't fill this for one child, but if you travel a lot, it would be great for the baby's stuff.
B003ITAUTG|5|We are very pleased with this car seat it makes us feel very secure with the baby in such a safe and comfortable carseat. This Recaro is the best carseat I have ever gotten and I have purchased 6 for my grandchildren.
B001U5LPJ4|3|I hung a small lap top bag using these hooks.  It worked well for the size bag that i had.  I wouldn't try anything larger.
B00068O22S|4|I can't imagine anything better... unless it was flame resistant and did not melt!  I just pay attention and close the cover before opening my oven.  Def does the job well
B0098LXROI|5|I bought these pacis for our third baby, who is now a week old. They are super cute designs and she seems to prefer these to another brand I also purchased for her.
B001UVJHY8|1|I have pumped for 32 months with the same tubing and thought it would be nice to get new tubing. I held off initially because I could not believe how expensive it was in the first place but now thought it would be worthwhile since I will be pumping for at least another year. I purchased this through Amazon prime so I thought I would be receiving this within two days. I did not receive it until almost a week later. When I finally received it, it arrived in a Ziploc baggie with a small bar code sticker as opposed to an official Medela box. It looked clean and new so I tried it. Immediately the thing that I noticed is that the tubing was much softer and thinner than the original that came with my pump. I then hooked the new tubing up to my pump and used it. Everything went well until I went to disconnect the tubing and the tube came apart from the connection piece. I now cannot get the tubing to stay attached to the connection piece. Overall I am very disappointed in my purchase.
B00EQCH8F8|5|I love it , it's will make my life  esya with my baby. .
B002WB2GB6|3|I usually never write reviews on products, but after all my research I ended up frustrated and disappointed by this purchase. I needed an extra stroller for air travel and to have one in each car. I wanted something smaller and lighter. I researched what seemed like forever and came down to two strollers, the Ignite and the Chicco 0.6. I ended up choosing the ignite because of the reviews, price, weight limit and price ( and the city chic black was great looking to me!). When the stroller came, it lwas easy to put together, looked great, smooth ride, easy to steer and loved the cup holder bag on top. But my 6 month old was so uncomfortable in this stroller. For one thing, the seat is very shallow. The seat doesn't cradle at all what so ever, the seat cut across the back of her legs in an awkward place. The straps are not padded at all, I purchased pads for the shoulder straps but the croch strap just dug deeply into her diaper made worse by the shallow seat. If there were no straps on the stroller she would slip out immediately! No cupping of this seat at all. Also wish the canopy was bigger, but I purchased a canopy extender. I put my friends two year old in the stroller one day and she fit perfectly! She must've weighed enough to push down that shallow seat. I went to babies r us and placed my baby in the Chicco 0.6 and she looked so comfortable. No crying and stayed in it the whole time I pushed her around. ( not the case with the Ignite). The seat cradled her nicely, PADDED 5 point harness and lighter in weight!  I'll still keep the Ignite for when she's older as an extra lightweight stroller, just not right for now.
B0052QYLUM|5|I received this super quick (less than 24 hours after ordering!) It is very easy to use. Just plug it in. Great image no matter what lighting. I also love that it stays on mute, unless the baby makes noise. I always have a radio on or air filter and it blocks it out. The range is great in our house, sound is clear. The image is good. I can see the baby clearly, even in a dark room. I can watch his breathing, smiling and see when he opens his eyes. The price is wonderful too!
B0081EQ2GS|5|This is what my 13 month-old daughter has choose for her lovey.<br />We couldn't be without it! It is soft and washable and we have 2 now<br />just in case we lose one.
B00GULB0UC|3|I wish that the top sleeper part would lift off and stand alone.
B0034Y2GUG|5|my son has acid reflux and he is almost three months old. I bought the other colors the primary circles and elephants for him along with the matching hat, swaddler, and blanket. well the hat is crap it doesnt stay on but this is amazingg.! with reflux they tend to spit up sooo much he will soak a whole outfit. it scared me so bad the first time is happened . it will create a huge puddle all over his changing table. and he usually looses about an ounce and half during these. for an infant without reflux or who doesnt spit up normally it will only be about a tsp.! so other burp cloths that are cheaper would be fine for those individuals in that situation but with an infant who spits up alot needs something to absorb all of that liquid and these have worked wonders for us! everyone of my other cloths wont absorb a thing.
B004G81T7A|5|My baby needed to be slightly inclined when laying and I needed something very portable. This works very well. It folds easily. Can move it around the house to whatever room I need to be in. She likes to lay in it because it is inclined. I bought the pink one. People compliment on it whenever I take it anywhere. Pleased with this purchase.
B00E4BFXOY|2|Baby seems to like the songs but for us it's a little loud. Be nice if it had a timer too.. it's just on or off. Changing the rate because it's already broken. That didn't last at all!
B00O1BHDG8|5|Feels a little cheaply made, but works perfectly.
B00JRKDBXW|1|Recieved ..the glass was broken ..and the frame was cracked !!
B00699WRBQ|5|good
B000IDSLOG|4|Sophie is great for the baby, my 4 month old can easily chew on her and loves to do so. Yes, there is a bit of gaging that goes on but like I have seen in other reviews it's no more than with his own fingers. My dislike for the item comes into play only because we have 2 dogs and Sophie looks and sounds like one of thier toys so they are relentlessly persuing the baby when he has the giraffe. It is really annoying and a little dangerous, if any of you have dogs and they go crazy for thier own toys they will do the same for Sophie so buy with the knowledge that you need to guard it with your life as well as your baby when they are using the toy.
B004ZLZG2M|3|These work OK.  The grippiness of the handles helps when clipping fingernails of a squirmy child, and the clipper blades cut nails effectively.  But I've had two of these break (same model from Safety 1st).  The first one lasted a couple of years.  The second one only lasted a few months.  That's poor durability.
B005GDW49Q|5|These &#34;big boy underwear&#34; have been quite the incentive to get potty trained as my grandson is anxious to wear them! They are expensive but I believe that they are worth the price! Very well made!
B00829U5EW|5|Love this!  So warm, soft and cozy!!!
B005PK1G76|5|I am using this stroller organizer with my City Select stroller. I have the second seat option along with the glider board. I like this stroller organizer because I am able to adjust the location of it depending on if my older toddler is using the glider board or the seat. Just the other day we went to an amusement park and it worked perfectly for our needs. I was able to put a pack of wipes in the center console along with antibacterial soap. My hubby and I each had a cup holder, which was a plus since the Baby Jogger version on a stroller organizer only had 1 cup holder. I am also able to fold the stroller without removing this unit. It is a great value and fits our needs.
B00AMVI1BW|5|It seems easier to wash and stays on well. No reason not to get these over the two part shields.
B003HS5JN0|5|So cute and just the right size for preschool or for a toddler transporting a few things from place to place.
B003I85VBO|1|I had been using the MAM pacifier clips, along with their pacifiers, since my granddaughter was a newborn baby. I still prefer their pacifiers over any other brand. BUT, the clips pose a definite choking hazard! Once a baby gets a little older (in my case my granddaughter was 13-months-old), they can very easily pull this off their clothing and snap them right in half! My granddaughter did this while sitting in her crib after waking up from a nap. I heard plastic hit the floor and assumed that she had again pulled the clip off her clothing and thrown it on the floor. When I walked into the room I was horrified to see half of the clip, which was just small enough to fit into her mouth, lying on the floor! I still shudder to think what may have happened if she had decided to put this in her mouth instead of just throwing it on the floor.<br /><br />If any parents/grandparents have very curious babies who examine and try to take apart everything, then I would recommend a different pacifier clip. I have been using the BoogenHead pacifier clips for nearly a month now, and my granddaughter can't get it off her clothing (not yet - she's 14-months-old). I make sure to keep it out of her reach when it's not clipped on her because she will put the clip in her mouth, which is not good for new teeth to chew on. But it's sewn on so securely that it's not going anywhere unless she can figure out a way to bite it into pieces (which I wouldn't put past her, lol).<br /><br />Update June 14, 2013: My granddaughter is now 28 months old and way too old for a pacifier, but I have to admit when she's cranky I still give her one (but only at home and not out in public, lol). I still have the same BoogenHead clips I mentioned above and they are in fine shape. I always wash them by hand and that has probably helped to make them last this long. She has never tried to yank it off her top. My daughter doesn't let her have one at all now, but I feel when a child that young is unhappy or feelingunder the weather, the pacifier seems to soothe.
B00H5OI9XO|5|Love this cooler! It's perfect to take to work to pump. Must have!! The ice pack it comes with stays cold all day.
B005537IFW|5|Exactly what I wanted. Was great for a baby gift.. The recipient was so pleased an adored it to the fullest
B008G4LKJ2|5|We liked it, very nice.
B002UD65X6|5|I own three of these since I'm constantly changing them out. They're very soft and fit my changing pad great. I wish that they had a better selection of colors though.
B0053YFO6I|1|I sent back this next day. My daughter was able to get out of this in less than 5 seconds. It was horrible!
B002UXQRLQ|4|Bought for a shower gift, the mom-to-be requested it.
B00GJVLWJC|2|Too tall. On the lowest setting my duaghter feet dangle quite a bit. The toys are cute and she'll sit in it briefly but then gets agitated when she cant move around. She's 7.5mo. We'll see if she grows into it but she has a ways to go! :/
B005VDX3ZK|5|I ordered this toy 2 days ago and received it yesterday. I can already tell it is one of the best baby purchases I have made. My 3 month old recently discovered her hands and is figuring out how to use them so I wanted something to make her reach out to it and keep her interested. I put her in the carseat to try it out and she played for at least 20 minutes! That is a long time for a 3 month old lol. She usually hates being in the carseat or stroller if they are not in motion so I know this toy will be a lifesaver in the mall or grocery store. I love that it can flex forward or backward as well as bend at the joints to make it easier to reach. Definitely a great buy!<br /><br />UPDATE: Daughter is now 9 months old and well out of her carrier but still loves this toy especially because she can fully operate the spinning flower solo lol. I'm now expecting a boy and have already added the blue one to my registry :)
B0077M9R76|4|These Gerber cloths may not be the thickest around, but they are more than adequate, and the absorbency is great.  These features, combined with a good price, the convenience of the four pack, and the speed with which Amazon ships to your doorstep make these cloths a great purchase.
B007MS1I5Y|5|We are only using the top and bottom, because experts say not to use bumpers because the baby might lean up against it and get smothered. However it is a great addition to the crib décor.
B0085KIF4K|5|It does the job.
B001TESJ7M|4|I ordered these lacing shapes for my 2 year old grandaughter.  On appearance, they were great; however, once one attempted to \\"string\\" the lace through the blocks, it was apparent that the insides of the shapes were rough, and the lacing caught on the rough edges.  We used a file to smooth the interior sides of the blocks, bur we were cautious because we did not want to break the paint finish. I ended up purchasing leather boot laces that would not catch on the imperfections.
B00083D754|5|Purchased this for my grandchild and he loves it.
B002GZ68UI|5|Very soft and comfortable.
B000056JJF|4|We use it all over our house. It actually makes our cords look very neat. But before you buy it, please beware of the dimensions of the product (see in product descriptions). It fits all our single-row surge protectors, and even a double-row extention cord with timer. it fits most of our plugs with transformer, EXCEPT some of the bigger ones. Unfortunately, the transformers for our router and DSL modem are too big to fit in, so we still have to find another solution for those...
B0032FOOQ6|5|It's a great baby gate ,you can take fold it and take it anywhere and be able to use it anywhere,and great part is no assembly needed and its strong
B00009YP2Q|5|We received this item as a shower gift; it was something I had put on our gift registry. I was able to put this together in about 15 minutes without tools or help from my husband, and it is very sturdy. It also rolls well on our hard wood floors which is great to move baby around the house. As someone else said, there is a pattern on the material which I was not expecting - the fabric on the display model is solid white but the fabric on the model Target is currently selling has a very light tan toile pattern. I did not find the pattern bothersome, especially considering this is an item you use for about 3 months and then store away, it's not like you are stuck looking at it forever. For the price, this is a nice bassinet. I have seen more expensive models at other stores but can't justify spending extra $$ on something that is used for such a brief time. I am pleased with it!
B004IYNIFS|4|I like it a lot the easy to turn light weight but the only part that's not design properly is the front of the seat cover keeps coming out when u put the legs down or up easy fix but it's a hassle to fix it everytime u open the chair
B002VBXY68|1|I do not approve nor reccomend this swing for ANYONE! My 7 week old daughter went head first out of this swing last week. She was strapped in EXACTLY as the instructions recommend. She was very upset for a brief moment but she was not injured. I was within just a few feet from her when it happened so I was able to untangle her quickly and remover her from the swing. I would give it 0 stars if it were an option.
B00009IMCK|5|good buy for my baby. thank
B00D73A9EO|5|Perfect gift for my grand-daughter. She slept like a baby (lol) I would suggest this to everyone. The price was high but well worth it including their fast delivery.
B0028IDXDS|5|I always thought these were weird until my friend gave me some a a gift for my 40 year old surprise baby boy. These things rock!! Seriously! You can rest them in tiny baby's chest and even if they spit it out it doesn't got anywhere and is right there when they want it. I seriously have gotten more sleep with this baby because of this product! Monkey is cute for girls or boys
B0064D73ZW|1|I bought 5 QBaby diapers to start my pocket diaper stash along with several other brands and these fit terribly and leaked even worse. When contacted , customer service was a joke, they promised to replace the diapers and never followed through. If you're looking for a inexpensive cloth diaper then I'd recommend checking the Dirty Diaper Laundry page and going through their reviews for diaper ratings and prices, or looking on Ebay for cheaper better quality diapers.
B00295MQLU|5|This is a must-have item for any mom who pumps. It's an extra step to the pumping process (so you may not use it every single time e.g. right before bed when you are in bed) but it's handy when you are behind the computer, getting ready to go out, or even playing with your baby. Fits well; no complaints. I'm glad it has the middle insert- don't know how the other brands without the insert fit.
B002WYJYT0|5|Practical, functional and useful. What more can I say!<br />Fits onto most pacifiers and clips easily onto clothes.<br />Good Product I may buy another.
B006Z6E8AG|4|Great for mashing everything, even slightly &#34;crisp&#34; veggies!  I like not having to prepare special meals for our LO.  I just mash what we are having.  He hasn't started on meats yet, but I'd imagine we won't have any issues for tender cuts and chicken.
B002SPN214|5|We ordered this little bunny because my son loved the one his sister received as a gift 2 years ago. He always holds his bunny right before going to sleep at night...so cute.<br />Delivery was prompt...will definitely order from this seller again. Thank you!
B000JWDIW6|4|I purchased this 4 piece outfit for my grandson for Christmas.  I loved the \\"Elmer Fudd\\" hat that it came with.  I wasn't sure how it would be, but when my daughter-in-law saw it, she immediately called me to tell how adorable it was and that the quality was surprising good.  I recent received pictures of him in it, and it looks so cute on him.  They live where the weather is cold, so its a great outfit for him to wear anytime.
B00GUN3Z1W|1|I am disappointed with this purchase. I purchased 2 of these and one of them snapped the moment I took it out of the box!!! The other is working and doing the job somewhat by keeping my 15 month old out of the kitchen (even though she shook it hard enough for it to become unbalanced and she got it), but feels flimsy and is uneven so it doesn't even sit right. Very, very, very disappointed.
B0051POK1E|4|Got this for my grandson.  He loves it.  The only thing I don't like about it is that the loops for the items that hang down are hard to open when you want to move things around or hang new ones up.  The loops are cloth and its hard to pop them open to slide the plastic holders in.  Other wise its colorful and entertaining for him.
B0083A6XUU|5|Needed to buy this to replace original adapter that came with baby monitor when purchased around 2 years ago. This model is a bit different than the original...for the better. It feels lighter and better designed. It appears a little slimmer and sturdier at the same time. Does the job!
B000JXUJ2M|1|The product we received is an old model. Must have been made pre-2011. Because of this, it did not fit the new graco car seat.  We've since returned this item and purchased a brand new Stokke adaptor, and it dies fur our new car seat.
B001I481LM|5|It's great product! I make formula once a day and keep it in the fridge - it's so much easier then make formula every time I need it. It's east to use and clean.<br />My child has no more problems with gases and spit-ups (but we also use Dr Brown's bottles).
B00TXQ8UCM|4|Great clips to turn any receiving or swaddling blanket into a nursing cover!
B0092YYDPS|2|For the same $ we bought a second soother that had motion and more options.  Plus ours broke (only plays the ocean noise) after 2 months of infrequent use.
B005IWM742|3|We got this Rock n' Play sleeper as a baby shower gift.  We love it as it helps to but our little one to sleep.  However, it creaks ever since we closed it and opened it once!  We tried to use WD-40 and tried to manipulate the pieces to no avail.  We still use it though.  The vibrating feature doesn't really seem to do much for our baby.  It is a low vibration, and it actually helps make the creaking less.
B004CJ0P1O|4|I love how I can pull up the cuffs and use them as long socks. They don't leave marks on my baby's legs.<br />I have been buying only these socks and always have received the colors as described.<br />But the size 2-3T I recently received has green and magenta colors. I like the new colors but not What I expected.
B0000DH5TU|1|We had major static problems with this unit -- even with it just in the next room from us.  Once we switched to a 900 MHz monitor (we chose the Sony babyCall) we had better luck.  We never heard anything through this monitor *other* than static.  Though this is cheaper than other 900 MHz models, if you have a lot of electronics around you may want to save yourself some time and aggravation and start off with a 900 MHz monitor (rather than trying this and risking having to return it).
B00HFFPTV8|5|This is the best stroller ever! I took it to Disney World with my 13 month old daughter, she took all of her naps in it and preferred it to her pack-n-play. The sun protection is great, since we were in Florida I did purchase an extension that worked our really well, but for just the normal day at the zoo I don't use it. It folds super quickly and the quality is outstanding. I would recommend this product to anyone. It is worth the price! My sister purchased a small $30 umbrella at Walmart and will be replacing it before her second child, yes this product is more expensive than that. But would easily take 3 children through the stroller days and be able to be sold at a garage sale for $75-100! Now that is a great deal. I also bought the Maclaren stroller bag and that was great for sippy cups and extra supplies since we we at Disney. Highly recommend this, I tried out several other strollers before purchasing this one and I am so glad that I ended up with the Maclaren. It's my favorite stroller by far!
B0052IERHM|2|We have a Britax convertible car seat which is huge but it fit perfectly. It's simply a bag that makes it easy to transport your car seat and keep it clean. The back pack straps are a cool feature and we liked that it had wheels, however; we are returning it. When we first used it, the zipper broke and the teeth pulled a part which added to the stress of flying with an infant for the first time.<br /><br />We're going to try to search for another brand that our car seat may fit in. If we can't find one, we'll just use the big plastic bags the airline can provide to put it in.
B000CSBP86|5|perfect for our family and little one
B007CRJHUI|4|I bought this crib for my newborn grandson at his parent's request. They have read the reviews on Amazon and decided to choose this crib. I was there when my son in law was putting it together and he was so pleased with how easy it was. My beef about it is that we assumed it was coming with the mattress. That is what is portrayed in the picture. We did not read that it didn't, until it was too late, so I think it is a little pricey with no mattress.
B008FZWCLW|4|Got it for a cosplay, had to edit it. If youre getting it for your kids the straps to keep it closed do not work. They are cheap magnets
B0074RDEY6|5|My son really likes to rub things between his fingers as he goes off to sleep.  This blankie combines the tags that kids seem to love with a soft velvety side, a smooth silky side and a doggie head.  I know this is expensive compared to other similar blankets but it is unique.  We have several and this is the favorite.  In fact we accidently left \\"taglie\\" behind when travelling and I went and bought another one online with express delivery!
B001O0DKF2|5|It is very true to the picture with pink, teal blue and chocolate stripes.  It seems to be well made and arrives in packaging.  Because of the loop attachment for the pacifier handle I would think it is suitable for any brand.
B00CWN8IK2|2|Worked ok for about a year.  One thing I don't like is you can't turn it down very low.  It puts out to much humidity for a small room.  We have had it for a year and it just started leaking around the base.  I'm going back to a Crane humidifier.
B0085K6416|5|Expensive but, a really nice lightweight, breathable fabric. The colors are vibrant and beautiful. I have washed these several times and they retain their color very well.
B0052QYLUM|1|Like a gambler who gets deeper and deeper in debt, I kept buying a new monitor after each one broke, thinking, this one will be better. Now, after the third monitor broke, the same way, I'm done. The major problem with these, and the reason you should look elsewhere for baby monitors, is the plastic antenna on top. With a simple drop or bump, it breaks. And if you have small kids, trust me, you or someone else in the family will drop or bump the monitor and the plastic piece that protects the antenna wire below will snap off. Why not super glue it back on, you ask? I tried that. All three times. But inevitably that breaks and what ultimately happens is the wire gets twisted or crumpled, which leads to so much static that it's unusable. These things are so cheaply made (both camera and monitor are super lightweight pieces of plastic) that it doesn't take much to damage them. They are also extremely basic in terms of functions. It's incredible they're asking close to a hundred dollars for something this cheaply made. We had the previous version of the Summer Infant video cam and monitor and it worked great. It was solidly built had a remote control rotating camera that really came in handy and was only about 50 or 60 bucks more than this piece of junk. Unfortunately, we lost it in the move to our new house.<br /><br />My humble advice, do not believe the four and five star reviews, invest a little extra money and get one that's more solidly built. Otherwise, you might end up ultimately paying more in replacement monitors once your original one breaks and you're too stubborn (or is it stupid?) to admit you should just cut your losses and buy one that's not so fragile.
B006P05S2Y|1|We've flown nine times in the past two years with our little one. The JL Childress ultimate car seat bag was our workhouse for eight of those flights. The only damage that bag sustained was a ripped off zipper.<br /><br />I had to purchase the Brica car seat bag after I'd discovered that we'd left the JL Childress bag at home - a 5.5 hour drive away from our relatives who were bringing us to the airport. I was searching for another JL Childress bag but they aren't readily available in any brick and mortar stores. I figured that maybe we'd have luck with the Brica bag despite so many complaints about it ripping.<br /><br />Well, the darn thing ripped! I think the problem lies within the design and quality of the fabric. The handle at the top of the bag makes you instincts want to drag it with the broad, flat area close to the ground. The problem is that the wheels are located on the other end, pointed towards the sky. And the area that's being dragged along the pavement? The fabric there is super thin and not reinforced in any way whatsoever. In juxtaposition, dragging it with the wheels oriented down feels awkward and cumbersome.<br /><br />The bottom of our Recaro ProRide car seat got scraped up. We've flown out of the same airports multiple times and we never had an issue with our car seat bag getting chewed up before. I'm so dismayed. Save yourself the headache and just get the JL Childress bag!
B006PB2BNC|1|This is just one of those totally crappy, overpriced products that you should avoid. We needed a new car seat, the next size up, and me hating the baby store, I get pretty impetuous about deciding on a seat and buying one. So I saw this one, which is pretty attractive decided on buying it within a few minutes. Thankfully my wife has a little more sense and suggested we try it out in our car before purchasing it. It kind of seems silly when you hear parents complaining about how car seats are impossible to install, but I have to say, after a few tries I gave up immediately, deciding not to lose my temper and have a melt down in the parking lot. Ironically, the car seat boasts that it is the easiest one to install. Last but not least there is actually styrofoam under the seat cushion as part of the underlying structure of the seat. Yes really! Styrofoam! It is one of the more expensive seats as well. Truly unbelievable.
B002T44LG4|5|I still use it.  My daughter is in a booster seat now and I still use it.  I love this so much in my cars, I buy this as my baby shower gift.  I gift practically and this is so practical.  My only complaint is it only comes with 1 mirror, so I always buy 2 mirrors to go along with this.  https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B004L2JJAA/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o01_s02?ie=UTF8&psc=1
B00389VFH2|1|I liked the refills that came with the dekor plus when  I first ordered it a few months ago. Once we ran out of refills I read the review online and thought that the people were comparing the bags they ordered to the new ones. This refill came and with one poo the room stunk! Very disappointed.
B000EICY8E|5|I didn't reallize we have purchased so much from Amazon...we use this gate between our living room and kitchen.  It is not for the baby but for our four legged babies, to keep them out of the kitchen and family room at night while we sleep.  It is very nice looking and very easy to install.
B00NFETDRY|5|4-5 month old likes it and will likely keep on liking it. Good quality toys attached. Fabric is easily removed and put back, and washable.
B00OU6MGWU|5|I love this kit: it has everything you need to feed & change your baby on the go.
B003JBHLCW|4|These are so cute... I was going back and forth between these and the monsters, but I'm glad I went with the robots (: I gave them four stars instead of five because they could be a little bigger. That being said, they wipe clean easily, can go in the wash or the dishwasher and are an adorable (while necessary) addition to any picture.
B000N83COK|5|I was a bit worried about buying this diapers at first since I've never heard of this brand before and it only had one review. I'm on a very tight budget right now so I need to save money and these diapers were just $26  in total with shipping included. I've been looking for diapers that would last the whole night for my daughter. I've used the night diapers from Huggies and Pampers but none of them seemed to work BUT these diapers are just great! Gonna buy these every time now.
B0064NA7Z0|5|Love them! The extra 300 balls helped fill the ball pit perfectly and my daughter (21-months-old) loves to dive into the pit.
B000AV5LZ8|5|Encourages independence in a big way! Folds up easy!
B00GEF7MOM|5|I LOVE this stroller! It's truly been the best one that I've used/owned. Light weight, easy to fold, compact fold fits many trunks. Best money I've put into a stroller.
B000058DQA|5|I had one of these for my first two children when they were babies. We fly at least once a year to visit relatives and have always been allowed to use it. It sure makes me feel better about holding my child in my lap during flights. Plus, it's easy to use and comfortable for the baby to wear.    I have misplaced our first one and am here now to replace it for our new daughter who will be using it for two trips in the coming months.
B00073HJG8|4|This is a really great product, works great, just not quite as big as I imagined jumbo to be. I'd recommend it still, just don't plan to put large stuffed animals in it.
B0071IEWD0|4|I love the Lifefactory 22 oz beverage bottle. Love the quality...and that it is long lasting even when dropped. I've decided to purchase the Lifefactory baby bottles due to my very positive experience with the beverage bottle. I have yet to use these baby bottles, but the colors and glass quality are fantastic! Will have to see about their function when baby starts using them.
B00BEVF1W6|5|I just received my seat today and I am more impressed with this seat than I thought I would be.  The material is very soft and very thick.  You can tell it will last and is high quality. The onyx looks nice and classy.  The padding on the seat portion is also exceptional.  Installation with the click tight is SIMPLE.  All you do is open the compartment, fasten the seat belt (no tricky holes or loops or threading required), and then close the compartment.  Fasten top feather.  The seat won't move.....not even a millimeter!  I was shocked at how tight the seat was held in. The seat is quite heavy, but I won't be moving it from my car very often so that isn't an issue for me.  We went from the Britax Regent to this and I am so glad we did.  Even my husband was super impressed!  The cup holders are molded into the seat so you don't have to worry about them breaking off.  Please spend the extra money on this seat!
B002CGRTFY|1|Piece of Junk don't bother. Go to Hardware store and buy some soft plastic chicken wire, attach to railing with zip pulls. Way safer and looks good.
B004VJSHSS|3|I was looking for a double folding stroller when we were planning our first vacation with 2 kids. After some researching, I decided on this one; it looked pretty comfortable and I liked the big shade on it (we were going to Florida and my kids have fair skin). For whatever reason, I didn't quite anticipate it being as large and bulky as it is, even when it's folded up. As a result, it's really taken a beating the few times we have traveled with it, from both the airline staff and from us when we've been in a rush, so it's gotten scratched, the plastic on the handle got cracked in one spot, etc. If you have a smaller car with limited trunk space, you'll have some trouble fitting it in and being able to put other stuff in as well. Still, I think it's pretty nice if you intend to use it for regular use...the seats are pretty tall so even a 5 year old can sit in it comfortably. Nice big basket underneath. Maneuvers pretty well.
B000I5UZ1Q|5|This is a general papasan swing, it is well made and functional.  The best part about this swing, however, is the tray across the front. Many papasan swings do not have this tray anymore, and for me as a mom, it is an added level of comfort about the safety. It's cute and the light show is great.
B00JK4L71S|5|Arrived early and nicely surprised at the results even after only 2 weeks. Thanks
B002E9C9PY|4|I was very satisfied with the mobile.  Very cute.  Works great!
B006T899QI|1|nothing great about this, baby was able to suck it down in a gulp there was no mimic of breast feeding. Tried twice and he gagged lost his breath and had to have the airway maneuver done from CPR class to get him to breath again. We will be sticking to Playtex drop ins not a single issue with gagging chocking or need for breathing intervention... there is a science to breast feeding and this missed the mark. i really wanted it to work because I love Medela brand.
B005VC5VQK|5|My daughter and grandson love the moby, so bought one for a friend!  A great product, good selection, and quality!
B00G5JLGXU|5|Very light & convenient. Easy to carry, very cute design
B001GBMDUW|5|Looked everywhere for these  goes great with baby room.It adds alot of details and colors to the baby room. Thanks
B00005BXKM|5|I love this bottle warmer.  It is very easy to use, which is great for those 3 am feedings. It is warms the bottles quickly,  it usually takes about 2-4 mins.   I have had no problems over heating or under heating my plastic bottles, however I did with the Playtex nursers.  (That was fine because my little girl didn't like those bottles anyways! they were too big for her face and covered up her nose.)One of the other things that I like about the bottle warmer is the size, it is perfect size and takes up very little space on the countertop. And I love the way the little water measuring cup attaches to the side, that way you won't lose it.  This is a definite must have for all moms.  I can't say enought good thing about it.
B00IVNEFAY|4|My 3.5 month old loves this. My only complaint is that the &#34;keys&#34; should work on the whole toy not just the bottom half. My son often kicks the top half which does nothing. We do still love it, though.
B000G82KRW|5|Very happy with this purchase. Bib very pretty, cross so appropriate to hang on my granddaughter's bedroom wall and the bible is very attractive with the cloth cover.
B006ZSYGOW|5|These blankets are perfect in every way!  They are nice and large for swaddling.  Light and thin to not overheat baby, and worked well when baby had a fever.  Our baby loves the feel of these blankets and is instantly calmed whenever an Aden blanket touches her hand or cheek.  They are worth every penny.
B006DNLNRM|4|I love the itzy ritzy reusable bags.  They are great for my girls' preschool snacks.  I usually put in things like grapes, graham crackers, animal crackers, string cheese.  They are water resistant but not water proof, so I still sometimes have to use sandwich bags, but we have decreased the number of sandwich bags we are using and that is a wonderful thing!  I would recommend them.  I get compliments and questions about them all the time.
B003XMWFB4|1|The part that latches the cup holder onto the cinch is very short and flimsy. Seller, please post information on the diameter of the clip. Does not fit BOB strollers.
B00H8O7NI8|3|This monitor gave us peace of mind for the first 6 months or so. First, we had it in a bassinet, and I'm not sure that it's designed for that but we did it and it seemed to work well. We put some cardboard underneath it and it did seem to detect the movement accurately. Then we had to move baby to a crib in her own room (earlier than I would have liked but she outgrew the bassinet) and we got a piece of wood to go underneath the sensor pad. Worked well, and we did have one alarm. I'm not sure if it was a false alarm or if she was having an apnea but she was ok. So it gave us peace of mind, and I recommend this monitor for that reason. I also recommend it over others because it doesn't emit radiation. However, once she got to be about 6 months or so and she was rolling all over the place, we got false alarms ALL the time, like every hour because she'd be too far from the sensor pad. So we had to stop using the movement monitoring feature and just use it as a sound monitor. By then, though, the risk of SIDS was pretty low, so it was ok.<br /><br />Now to my major complaints: if you turn off the sound on your parent unit, you can't even hear the alarm! So dumb! Just because I don't want to hear my baby's every squawk doesn't mean that I don't want to hear the alarm! I don't know if they've changed this on more recent models but if not, they should! It's totally idiotic. Second, the light on the nursery unit is way too bright! You want to put it close to baby's head or else you won't hear them, but then you have a super bright light shining on them and keeping them awake! The light does NOT need to be that bright. A nursery should be pitch black, especially if your baby has sleeping problems. I covered the light with two layers of silver duct tape and it's still too bright so I'm going to try black electrical tape. But it should not be that bright.
B0081ZOWC8|5|My daughter has loved these Soothies since birth and having colors other than the ubiquitous green is a godsend for daycare so she doesn't end up with another baby's pacifier. We probably have 20 of these stashed throughout our house and in our cars to be sure we're never caught without one nearby.
B003EUEOPK|5|I love these...now my shower feels like a fish tank
B0017RSXWM|5|These are so worth the money--they are well made and fit a wide range of body types.  Will buy again!
B0057L8UOU|5|I got this for my daughter's playpen. The set of music it has are nice and my daughter seems to enjoy staring at her little friends. We also attach it sometimes to her rocker and it holds perfectly (we have the fisher price newborn to toddler rocker) It was just what we were looking for.
B00068O22S|5|Love these. Great because my 2yo can reach knobs.
B0002Q2OOM|2|Not to entertaining put the blocks in the same shape and color and then you're supposed to press the ears down and they're supposed to slide out the trunk but you dont even push the ears down and they come out my daughter has more fun with the blocks alone then the whole toy itself
B00A6F2QJC|5|I'm not sure this product is necessary vs using regular milk but as a new mom it calms me down to think I am using a more gentle soap on bottles and my pump parts. Love the convenience of a pump top as well.
B004FN0Z44|4|My son is 2 and hates strollers. Up until this one I was still using the infant stroller system and he hated it. This folds up easily and compact, the wheels don't stick, the holder thing between the handles is perfect for the stuff you need easy access to. The only complaint I have is the sunshade, either I don't know how to attach it right or you can't fold the stroller with the sunshade in place. Love this stroller!
B00285945W|5|I  rally liked this Thanks
B00004TFLB|5|Bought as birthday present for a friend's one year old. He loves it and uses it daily! Simple and engaging toy.
B0006BAJIG|4|avent excellent product.<br /><br />the only thing that caused me problems was the box that was sent as it was very big and made ​​me spend more money for transportation to Venezuela
B004EW0TF6|2|I bought this potty for my grandchild but could not get the side compartments to open. I tried all types of gallon bags, zip and non zip not a one would fit! I dont think the plastic grocery bags are strong enough. I had planned to put a cheap diaper in to assorb the you know what. Will return it soon.
B0000789SZ|5|Love this toy.  I love that it has many diffent stages and can be used for many months!  My daughter loved this toy and when she out grew it I just couldn't throw it away.  I donated it to a local day care center and they just love it as much as I do.  There is nothing bad to say about this toy!
B002H9XHNO|4|I've been using the mini buggy board for about 8 months. My one-year old rides the stroller and my almost-four-year old rides the buggy board. I have a McClaren XT with extendable handles. I live in a city and do lots of walking on uneven surfaces. I recommend this product to anyone who wants to avoid a double stroller. My son loves it and it has been tremendously helpful. I would buy this product again. I would also ask the manufacturers to make some revisions to its design.<br /><br />PROS:<br />Super easy to install<br />Durable<br />Perfect size (small)<br />Easy to take on and off (for folding up the stroller)<br />Great latch to hold it up when not in use<br />Great \\"suspension\\": it goes on and off sidewalks as smoothly as can be and endures holes and uneven ground<br /><br />CONS:<br />Backing up the stroller is hard or nearly impossible<br />The distance between the parent and the stroller handles is diminished, so I'm often hunching over. It's not terribly uncomfortable and I often just walk on the side of the stroller, pushing on one handle.<br />One of the springs in the attachment kit is a bit messed up, so I need to help it along when I attach the board, but nothing major.
B003VRER58|5|We have Alva, Charlie banana, and some off brands. These work really well. Never leaks for us. Out of all the kinds we have tried this is on  .  the top of the list.
B004HFQOLI|5|really good
B008J0DEAG|5|What a great bag--lots of pockets and machine washable!  The quality is great and I love being organized,  thanks jujube
B001ACW7M6|5|I love this potty seat! its so easy to clean and easy for her use!! would recommend to anyone!
B009ZCFPUE|4|Loved it except I thought the name would be written just like the other writing and it isn't other than that it's great.
B002IID23Y|5|Great product!
B00MYRXSE2|5|This is a must have if you sterilize your baby bottles.  Reduces the work of drying out the bottles on your own.  Highly recommend.
B003XMWFBE|5|nice and handy for our car for our little grandson, we gave it to his parents when they travel to the grandparents.  It keeps things handy in the car.
B002AMVELU|5|Very easy fold and open, looks great, seat is more like an umbrella stroller but other features like a much more expensive stroller.  Purchased additional handle bar for toddler, she climbs and out easily (which she really likes!)
B009F1MK2Q|5|We have a preemie and the hospital recommend dr browns exclusively. It is nice to be able to pick the flow of the formula
B0067GKHQS|4|A simple weight to hold down the wipes as they pull apart.  This product works great.  I will note that I still have some wipes that come out in a pair but not as often with this tub.  I blame it on the wipes manufacturer - sometimes I wonder if they do this so you use more wipes.<br />I'm giving this 4 stars rather than 5 because of the following items:  (1) the cost is high in my opinion.  i'm still trying to find a comparable household item to serve the same purpose without the cost for another wipes container (2)  I've had to push the rubber ring around the seal up twice because it came off its track at the 'mouth snap' (3)  I've had to unjam if I closed down the lid and a wipe got caught in the 'mouth' mechanism.
B00J0BU0FA|5|Great quality, thick, nice colors and easy to fold up. Glad it has Velcro instead of a zipper, it will last a long time.
B00YU0S6DE|5|One of the main reasons why I was interested in this necklace was the natural healing properties, and the beautiful rich color of the resin.  I was extremely excited to have the opportunity to purchase this item with a promotion because I have tried other teething necklaces for my daughters in the past, and none of them even held a candle to what the QBebe necklace was offering.  In my honest opinion, you cannot go wrong in trying this item out for yourself.  I am always inclined to gravitate towards natural remedies for myself, and most importantly my family.  It is such a relief to have finally found a product that offers the natural approach to a milestone in a baby's life that can be most uncomfortable.  The quality of construction is phenomenal.  Previously I tried a teething necklace that claimed to have a safety screw connection that was merely a snap and hook closure.  The safety screw connector on the QBebe Amber teething necklace is sturdy, secure, and really offers piece of mind.  I am not at all worried about letting my baby use this necklace to soothe herself, and look forward to purchasing the QBebe Amber teething necklace for other expectant parents.  Plus, anything that claims to cut down on baby drool is a MUST try for this mama! =)
B008VWEDJI|4|I've been very happy with this diaper bag-it has held together very well and I have gotten a lot of compliments.  I like all the storage pockets and dividers on outside and inside.
B00LVUOUZE|5|Works exactly as advertised, and once it's cinched up even the small Lego pieces don't fall out.  The handle strap is really long and may or may not encourage your child to swing it around and around despite repeated warnings, but he'll stop once it's full of heavy dominoes and accidentally hits himself in the mouth and the blood starts gushing out.<br /><br />Also, excellent customer service from the seller.  I'd buy from them again!!
B004HIZ4PM|5|I have only used this once so far at the grocery store, but it served its purpose. I liked the idea of this instead of using thosr gross straps that are already on the carts.
B003KCP7QC|1|We spent an ungodly amount of money on these diapers, followed the instructions to the letter and all we got was a baby with a horrific diaper rash (funny, their website says babies won't get diaper rashes with these magic diapers!) and leaky worthless diapers.  We never used diaper rash ointment, never strayed from the washing instructions detailed on the website.  After less than a month of use the PUL was visibly coming apart on half the diapers, and all of them were leaking profusely.
B005IWM99K|3|For the price this works just fine. However, it is not as sturdy as I expected, and found out today that not all of the straps are removable for washing.  I paid a good deal more for my last high chair, and didn't think I needed to this time around. Now I'm wishing I had. With my last one I got a sturdier, better quality chair with an extra cover, all the straps could be removed and the tray had a liner that could be easily removed for washing.  You definitely get what you pay for (or don't pay for in this instance).
B005GU181Y|5|I LOVE THIS WALKER! I can't say it enough. The toys on it were pretty cheesy (a quacking duck) but it's definitely cute. I love the strawberries on the seat.. It's made very well. Easy to clean. The play tray comes off and I actually used it as a highchair until my daughter could not fit in it anymore. It has the carpet stoppers that you put on when the baby is not mobile - then you can take them off when you baby wants to walk. The baby can walk wherever - unlike some walkers that just walk forwards and backwards.. this one moves 360 degrees.  None of my other friends with babies had this same exact walker. My daughter loved it, I loved it, and it was worth every penny. BUY IT.
B00284AHRM|5|My 6 month old baby loves this toy!! It is cute and has a rattle inside of it and also a mirror I attached it to his car seat and he will sit and stare at it while I shop :o) would definitely recommend product and seller.
B002SG773W|5|This review is going to be short and sweet because these bibs are simply awesome! Great product, we use them everyday! I run them through the wash constantly and they haven't cracked or faded. You can just toss them in with your clothes and lay them out to dry afterwards, they dry in seconds! Amazing!!! Couldn't imagine life without these!
B003TRVFJG|5|Perfect for Disney, cheap, easy to close, easy to open. Fits my 2 and 4 year old perfect despite the older being over weight limit. It's obviously not going to hold up to much wear and tear for the price but we are only using it every few months for Disney trips.
B00IX6A058|4|A little smaller than I expected. But overall, it is good!
B00M0OKL30|2|Smaller size than indicated!
B000GK5XY2|2|Honestly don't get the point of the gadget
B00IP8AF18|5|Great boosters for the money. I ordered 3! I wish it had cup holders but for $14, I'm not complaining.
B002TITO94|5|I have been using my Boba for about 10 months with my now two year old. I did a lot of research on soft structured/ buckle carriers before deciding on the Boba. I have tried all different types of carriers with my two year old daughter, including wraps, pouch and ring slings, and mei tais. I like them all, but when you want something fast and easy to put on that is comfortable for quick trips in and out of the store or long walks in the park, you can't beat the Boba. I feel that I must disclose that I haven't used the front carry position much, we use it more for back carrying. I will also say that we haven't needed to use the footstraps yet as my daughter isn't quite big enough to need them yet.   Here are some of the things I love about the Boba:   - It will support children up to 40 lbs or so, probably even more.    - As with any buckle carrier, it may take you a minute to play with it and adjust it to your specifications, but once you get it right, it is amazing.   - The shoulder straps are padded and very comfy. I have read reviews where others had a problem with the straps causing some rubbing on the underarms from the padding not extending as far as some other carriers, but never experienced this problem myself.   - I love that I can roll up and hide the extra length of the sraps so there are no loose ends dangling around.    - The waist belt is very comfortable, even under my now 9 month pregnant belly. (When used in a back carry)  - I can get my daughter on my back by myself with no problem. I just buckle the carrier on my waist, then put her on my back piggy back style and bring the carrier up and around her, do a hop or two to get her down in the seat in a good position, then I put on the shoulder straps and fasten the chest clip.  - I love that I can get her good and high and close enough on my back and it is very comfortable. I've seen action pics of other similar carriers where the baby looks really low and saggy in the carrier, that is not the case with the Boba.  - We have the organic Pine Boba and the fabric is very soft and snuggly right out of the box.   - The sleep hood is great and serves it's purpose well. It snaps to the shoulder straps to keep baby's head properly and comfortably positioned should they fall asleep, (so their little heads don't droop and bob and roll around), and it either comes off or can be rolled up and hidden away when not in use.     The Boba is a great carrier, and I would recommend it to anyone. It is the only one of my much rotating stash of carriers that I have never even thought of selling. Just today I received my Sleepy Wrap (stretchy wrap), which is made by the same company, to use with my newborn. I can't wait to get to use it.
B0047NPN5I|5|My granddaughter was thrilled with this set to match her dishes. It is a size larger than her last ones that she outgrew. A good size prior to using our normal silverware. Seems like good quality.
B001QFYPM2|5|I bought this stroller for my daughter because we were going to a family reunion and her husband was unable to attend. She has a 7 month old and a 6 year old. It worked great and we were so glad to have it!  She flew and we drove so she was alone in the airport with both kids and it was a life saver!
B00SQXF120|5|This is such a great product for the price. I bought two (I Have twins) and I received so many compliments on how cute it looks. It also feels nice and soft just like silk and my daughters play very freely in this. I love it! Great buy. Please make some winter ones and I promise I will order!
B00IABHYV4|3|works good.  But, the music not as loud as I would have liked.  BJ
B003F78BUQ|5|Love this bib!!!  My daughters clothes are no longer stained with sweet potatoes and blueberries.  This bib is great because it covers her arms and the whole front of her shirt.  Plus you don't have to wash it every time you use it, you can just wipe it off and you are good to go.  When you do wash it, it does wash up nice and I like that it is NOT made out of vinyl and does NOT contain nasty pfalates or PVC.  This bib rocks.
B008X6RH0E|5|These are so much nicer than some of the cheap plastic-handled spoons that I got as hand-me-downs for my daughter.  At 20 months, these are a great size for her, and they are a good quality ... they don't seem like they'll fall apart or have plastic that will break when she throws them onto the floor.  She likes the dots, which she refers to as &#34;buttons&#34;.
B002UD65XQ|5|This item is very plushy, we bought to go along with the Sealy crib/toddler mattress, it is so plushy, my grandchild will feel like she is sleeping on a cloud. It is well made and the price was perfect, I saw flimsy ones for twice the price. Don't overlook this perfect pad guarntee to make you smile and know in your heart your little one is sleeping......because God knows you won't be LOL![[ASIN:B001IP8NTG Sealy Baby Ultra Rest Mattress]]
B00IB7DT1Q|5|Neat little toothbrush. She likes chewing on it and having us brush her teeth with it as it is soft and there is no danger of accidentally poking her with a hard plastic handle.  It's the same material as any silicon teething toy (like Nuby), so it's very bendy. Between the baby biting down on it and the parents wiggling it over her teeth, I have seen some food particles actually get moved around, so I guess it works. The contoured shape of the brush is nice too - it makes it easy to slide the brush around in her mouth because you just get it positioned over some of the teeth, and even when the baby bites down, you can slide it around over the other teeth.
B002NV0VLW|5|This is great if you are a busy Mom and need your hands free to do dishes, drive, work on the computer. I use it to pump while I pay bills online! It's great! I have even used it while driving. Of course you should cover up, but for someone on the go alot it's wonderful! Being able to pump both breasts at the same time is also a great time saver. Awesome product for us multitaskers!
B00009VE20|1|I am expecting my second child any day now and i bought the Kolcraft Universal 2 car seat carrier to go with my Graco Snug Ride Seat. I had a travel system with my 1st child hated the stroller because it was too bulky and heavy. So i deceided to buy the universal frame, needless to say... IT IS GOING BACK!!! I have been trying to SAFELY secure my seat into the carrier. Both items are BRAND NEW, (we had to get rid of the other system due to a mice infestation problem our neighborhood garages had a year ago)securing the seat ONLY with the strap felt unsecure to me. The seat wouldn't move from the front, but it still moved left to right and WAS NOT SECURE at all from the back, it tilted no matter how tight the strap was tightened by myself or my husband.  <br />I do not feel safe putting my newborn in this carrier whatsoever. I've read all these reviews and can't understand how some people with the Graco snugride say it's just fine with only the strap. There is a metal bar that interferes with the locking mechanisim so that seat doesn't hook to the rear bar. If the bar was removable then i don't see a problem with the seat staying securely in the stoller. But it is not my place to mess with how Kolcraft built their stroller. <br />There shouldn't be any \\"tricks\\" to get your seat to fit securely, otherwise the Graco seat would be \\"compatible\\". But to me, it is not compatible because of this safety issue. <br />Also, \\"removing the drink holder so their other child can stand in the basket\\"? I read that in a few of the reviews, that doesn't sound safe to me either, especially when i have a 2nd child who is three, and actually can lay in the basket (he was hiding from me.) SAFTEY is my FIRST priortiy when it comes to the well being of my kids. Sorry Kolcraft, but I'm returning this stroller and i have only owned it for litteraly 4 hours, it's going back to Babyuniverse.com and being exchanged for the Graco Brand Snap and go, there i should feel safe and secure as well as mychild. <br />Think twice about the safety of your newborn if you own a Graco Snug Ride car seat and are thinking about buying this product. If you read all the reviews like i did, only a handfull of people used this stroller with the Graco seat. As a Graco Snug Ride owner I wouldn't give this any stars, but I had to give it at least 1.
B000K53UEI|4|It's not fancy, but it does the job.  It holds the plastic bottles, nipples and collars with minimal issue. My only complaint is I wish it were a little bigger as we've added to our bottle collection and it can't hold it all without collars and nipples falling off the rack.
B004FKI8KA|2|As described, the bed folds up into a small, easily transported size. I could probably slip it into a larger suite case. What concerns me, however, it how soft the cushion (mattress) is. Infant sleep surfaces should be firm, but this is like a under-filled comforter. I fear that if my child rolled over, she might suffocate, so I am sending it back.
B001B1FHIC|5|very good at keeping the water off the eyes.
B003CUXV0Q|4|Good support mattress for what we needed for the pack & play. We only used it for a week for a visiting 18 month old but it did the trick.
B000HK6BCE|4|This bed rail is very nice in that it creates a barrier on both sides of the bed.  Furthermore, it does not clamp to the top of the mattress as many do, so does not reduce the useable bed area and allows the bed to be made much more easily.  The hideaway function is also a benefit when it is not in use, or when changing bed linens.    The only thing we do not like about it is the rail latch system.  The latch pins are hard to align when locking the bedrail in the up position, and can get in the way when sliding the rail in and out from under the mattress.  This could be improved with a locking keyhole slot to hold the pin out when moving the rail up and down.    Overall, it is the best bed rail we have used.  Previously we had two different Safety 1st models, both of which were disappointing to say the least.
B00005BSM3|5|I LOVE THIS ITEM,MY SON IS 2 YEARS OLD SO HE IS SOME WHAT ACTIVE IN THE BATHTUB SO THING GET WET SO THE ARM REST HELPES YOU FROM SLIPPING IN,THE KNEELER HELPES ALOT AND THE BEST THING IS THE POCKETS, JUST PUT THE BABY BATH AND SHAMPOO IN THERE AND YOU NEVER EVER NEED TO TURN YOUR HEAD AWAY FROM YOUR CHILD.I LOVE THIS,IT IS A MUST HAVE!!!
B000J2L1F2|2|I love my Avent breast pump, and since I'm away from my baby at school all day, I needed to be able to pump in my car. I bought the car charger and it worked beautifully for about 3 weeks, and then stopped working. The pump still functions fine, but only on the indoor charger. It is frustrating to have to buy a new car charger already, and in the mean time I have to hand pump, which is totally inefficient. So I recommend the pump, but the car charger is a little lame.
B003N3AS2G|5|This is a wonderful bib, but you can get it 20% cheaper at major retailers like Buy Buy Baby (and if you use BBB's 20% off coupon, then it's even cheaper still).
B00C0TBARQ|3|Good seat for the larger baby.  The reviews on the shoddy knob mechanism are spot on.  We purchased one for our home and then purchased another one for my parents, but the one my parents received was broken and the knob does not attached appropriately.  I would potentially purchase another one, but we aware of a faulty knob.
B00A336NPU|5|Perfect for todlers cereals in the morning around the kitchen!<br />Also good for snacking in the pram, pop corn or wathever dried items they like to pick by themselves
B006MXPJ82|5|I just purchased 4 Timi and Leslie diaper bags because I couldn't decide which one I would like. I will be taking advantage of Amazon Prime's free returns to send back all but one. Actually, I love them all, but here's how I chose my winner. (honestly, I could have used any of them and loved it, so don't be too turned off by my cons). Happy Mother's Day to me :)<br /><br />Dawn: Loved it.<br />  pros- neutral taupe color is great. love the slim shape and style, fits nicely on my shoulder. Just based on look and fit, I think this would be my favorite<br />  con- no outside pocket. (note- they all have a zipper pocket in the back, but this doesn't have a place for me to throw my  keys and phone on the outside where I can grab them easily. Not a huge deal probably, but important to me.<br /><br />Rachel- maybe my least favorite, but still a great bag<br />  pros- nice neutral taupe color, nice small outside pockets to get to things easily (though you do have to zip them. even the little pockets on the outside with the clasp thing could be used for a phone or something small). Maybe the most room without taking up a lot of space. (Jessica is roomy, but seems bulkier)<br />  cons- it's kind of tall so a little harder to get to the bottom of it, and the shoulder straps are pretty short so you almost  would have to use the messenger strap to wear it comfortably and be able to dig for things inside it. The way the main zipper zips around the edge seems a little cumbersome.<br /><br />Jessica- a nice big bag<br />  pros- lots s great outside pockets to stash things, they are pretty roomy actually. Nice neutral taupe color. Wears ok with shoulder straps, nicely with messenger strap. Pretty wide, so lots of storage<br />  cons- it's pretty wide, so it almost seemed like a suitcase. It's probably better in the messenger strap position, but then the other straps are hanging down all the time.  I might accumulate trash in all of the outside pockets, there is so much space there.<br /><br />Marilyn II- The winner.<br />  pros- a few outside pockets that are just under a flap, so still easy to get to, but less likely to lose stuff. There is an extra outside pocket under the flap I couldn't see in the picture- perfect for an ipad or small laptop. Wears nicely with the shoulder strap. The brown color is nice, I thought it might look too plasticy based on the picture, but not really.<br />  cons- Doesn't really work with the messenger strap (although I don't think I would want to use it anyway). I think I prefer the taupe color of the other bags, though this brown is nice, the taupe would be more versatile.<br /><br />My husband is nervous about me being able to return the extras, I will report back if there was a problem, but I don't expect there to be based on my experience with Amazon.<br /><br />**update- when my husband got home to give his opinion, he said the Brown Marilyn II bag was too \\"J. Lo\\" and plasticy looking, so I decided to go with the Jessica instead. Though I will miss the ipad/laptop pocket, I do prefer the neutral color and will be happy with all of the outside pockets and roomy inside.
B00K2NTJ8O|5|Perfect size and softness for any infant photo shoot. So wonderful and can be used again and again.
B003N9M6YI|5|I like this teether. My son hasn't used it yet (or needed it yet), but i like the quality and it seems like it will will easy for him to use without freezing his little hands. I like the combination of hard and soft and the nubs on keys.
B0092NNQ98|1|The straps on this thing are WAY too long.  At their shortest possible length, they snap in to make a circle that is larger than the actual chair itself (see attched photo of the shortest length of the straps), making them worthless.  There is no way you'd ever use these long straps.  All the videos I've seen, the picture on the Amazon page, and the picture on the box show straps that are small enough to fit around a baby's waist.  The actual straps just hang down loose on the baby's thighs.  I wrote Bumbo USA support an email with a picture of the straps and I got a generic replay that &#34;all seats meet required safety standards&#34;.  That's no help if there is a manufacturing mistake.  Terrible customer support.  Will be returning to Amazon.  I recommend not getting this potential death trap.
B002VAISOM|5|Quick Summary:<br />- babies love this teether<br />- great quality product with no rubber smell<br />- single piece with no discernable molding seams<br />- nice squeeking noise<br />- head and feed are appropriately sized and fit in baby mouths<br /><br />Detailed Review:<br />When I saw the price for these baby teethers, I thought it was outrageous.  You see the cheap teether toys available at dollar stores and convenience stores for so much less.  Why would I want to try this toy?<br /><br />But after hearing friends rave about the toy, we decided to give them a shot.  The 2 pack is slightly better priced and allows you to have a spare if you lose one.<br /><br />Right away, I was impressed, because I knew it was a rubber toy but it had no discernable odor at all.  It's all made with food paint grade that does not fade with teething.<br /><br />The overall look of the giraffe is cute, but thought must have been put into the head size/shape as well as the feet location/shape.  Each part is enjoyable to put in a babies' mouth and they don't seem to get tired of it.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
B008VUGAQE|1|They were way to expensive for the quantity.  Made a mistake and brought them , thinking was a bigger package .
B006BHSAB2|5|I love this WubbaNub it is exactly like described and my baby likes it too it is the only type she uses.  I would definately recommend.
B000YDI85W|5|This was the most adorable outfit!  We are so glad we found it.  Our Godson wore it as his \\"get comfortable\\" outfit at his christening reception.  EVERYONE LOVED IT!  He looked comfortable, cuddly and BLESSED!  Definitely a find and buy!! WAY TOO CUTE!
B000W4Q9JU|1|My husband and I laughed when we saw the 40-step instruction book that has zero written instructions and is all diagrams. Aside from the diagrams being very difficult to follow and understand, all the parts have #'s (like a flat head screw = #99 while round head screw that is almost identical = #100). We had to skip steps 11 and 12 until we could see how those pieces would be used in final construction because the directions were so unclear. In the end, we were missing 8 nails and had a surplus of plastic dowels. The hardware is sectioned into plastic bags without rhyme or reason. Aside from a difficult assembly, this is a CHEAP CHEAP CHEAP quality table/bureau. I'm a little nervous about using it with our newborn but since we spent the 4 hours assembling it I can't imagine trying to send it back to the company and starting over. We're going to make the best of it but I would definitely say it's better to spend a few more bucks on something more substantial or even check out Ikea. I think their product would have been a better choice over this one. Obviously, NOT recommended (especially if you aren't handy, which by the way, we are).
B003FBI4TK|5|When I first encountered this bedding online, I thought it looked great. Then I went to see it in person at a Babiesrus store to make sure I wanted it, and it looked even better in person. The fabric is soft and cushy, not stiff like some of the other bedding sets I've viewed. Also the colors are much softer and a little darker in person, which personally, I prefer. It is a whimsical option without being overly gaudy like other sets. If you want your baby's nursery to look tasteful and elegant, this is a great option. I only wish this item were more easily attainable, as it is only available at specific Babiesrus stores or online. Beautiful set, you won't regret the purchase.
B00B0ZMN0Y|5|Great quality and easy to &#34;install&#34; on the cart! Wouldn't leave home without it!
B000W7O7DM|5|i loved this product its awesoe... the butterflys dont open like the picture shows but im working on them its still amazing! and matches the crib bedding perfect!
B000J038HS|5|I think Treasured Designs is a wonderful seller. I had a problem with the insert ripping when I tried to take it out.  Then Treasured Designs sent a new one free of charge and the insert was in a nice card.  I would recommend them to family and friends!! ;)
B001NAATW0|5|I buy stuff all the time, and never ever write a review, but this time thought it was necessary. This is actually my 2nd monitor, I originally bought a Philips DECT technology one because I wanted no interference, and at the time video monitors received horrible reviews and didn't promise privacy. Now my kids are 15 months old and we felt the need to get a video monitor (still have the philips and love it too).  Finally they sell digital, no interference ones.  Cost a pretty penny but honestly completely worth the price.  This monitor is AWESOME!  Crystal clear sound and picture.  The panning and zoom feature are incredible.  Best of all its easy to use, no need to study the directions.     Buy it, you won't be disappointed.
B000056OUH|5|This is great for sterilizing the bottles. It's so nice to not have to boil water and hope that we're not melting the bottles.  You only need to microwave them for four minutes and then cool for two minutes before opening the lid.  I should let you know that it is extremely hot (and steamy) so you will need to be careful using it.
B002QYW8LW|3|This brush, is a great teething toy, but doesn't work too well as a brush for my daughter (she was 9 months when i got it, now she's 11), because she likes to chew the sides and the other end more for some reason. So the brush part gets into her mouth maybe 20% of the time. I think toddler brushes need to have the bristles all over :)<br /><br />But as a theething toy, it's great. Good quality, safe - the &#34;folded peel&#34; part doesn't let her stick it all the way into her throat.<br /><br />So if you can get your baby to use the brush part - it's a good. Otherwise you'll just have another toy.
B001UFCJ9O|5|Love love it! recently purchased this for my Britax Stroller prior to our trip to Disneyland and its sooo convenient and it fits perfectly!<br />really like the easiness to set up and accessibility. Actually considering buying another one for the other side. Came very handy and seems sturdy. This is a MUST BUY!
B002LZZ7IM|5|My 10 month old granddaughter loves this book! It has a nice crackling sound to it as well as stimulating colors and texture!
B000MRK5RE|5|Got 2 complete sets including sippy cups ! unbelievable!  Only problem is I got 2 blue for my baby girl. but its ok! still an amazing deal! Im gonna order 2 more since we have 6 bottles. hopefully this time we get pink :D
B000JVXZF2|4|I wanted to come back and update my original review. I ordered this seat back in June. After several months of regular use it is still working great and I am still quite happy with my purchase. I purchased it to use while on vacation & for visiting family members houses. I wanted something that I could safely and easily strap into a chair or put on the floor for those times there wasn't a chair available. Like in a hotel room. Someone asked if it was ok to use on the floor. I think it is perfect for that. I know one person said it wasn't tall enough. But really, if you need a safe place to strap your child in so they can eat. This is absolutely acceptable, it isn't meant to be tall like a regular high chair. If it is on the floor the &#34;legs&#34; do need to be folded out in order to make it sturdy enough. A family member accidentally forgot to pull the legs out when they stuck my daughter in it while the seat was on the floor and she nearly tipped it over. Obviously that is user error, but just a friendly reminder to not forget about those.<br /><br />Pros:<br />I love this seat for travel. It folds up compact enough that I don't mind keeping it in my trunk all the time.<br />It is nice and sturdy. I don't have to worry about my toddler toppling over when in it on the floor because the legs are pretty strudy.<br /><br />Cons:<br />The decorative cover on the back really does not attach well. That isn't a make or break deal for me. I actually preferred it not on there because it just meant less I had to clean. It is a regular fabric vs an easily wipeable fabric. I don't feel that it is practical for a child eating in it. I really prefer ones that have the plastic coating over.<br />I wish the tray attached to the seat when folded up for travel. I clip it on using the straps. But it would have been nice if it had a better way to keep them together. That is the only reason I am not giving it 5 stars. Sure it works great as is, but it would be absolutely perfect if the tray also attached for travel when folded up.<br /><br />I apologize for the not so great picture. My daughter was an average size 18 month old in this photo with the seat directly on the floor. She has plenty of space to grow still at 22 months old.e tray also attached for travel when folded up.<br /><br />I apologize for the not so great picture.

B000JWUP72|5|I don't know how I managed without this item for my first child! I would lift her out of her car seat and place in bugaboo each time!! This is great, I don't have to wake my baby up and battle with him while fastening and unfastening the straps each time...I love that I can simple click in place and go! it does take a little practice to be able to do first time, but I have finally got the hang of it and usually able to click into place first time.  I have no worries on safety side either, the seat is clicked firmly in place and very secure.
B001LWULD2|5|After searching for a plastic for my jogger stroller i finally came across this one, so glad with this purchase. Durable, Trendy and keeps my 3 month old very warm and dry. Would recommend to all my friends and family.
B0052QYLUM|4|Very happy with the product and the customer service.  It is exactly what I was looking for at a great price.  I had issues just recently with the monitor losing signal and I called customer service and although I was a couple weeks over my one year warranty they honored it and sent me a new one!  Great customer service and a great product at a great price!!!
B0081EQ2GS|5|This is a great quality product, my daughter loves the feel of it.  Highly recommended!
B00CCTOGPC|5|We have this in a different pattern and used it with our almost 4 yr old. She was able to use it for a long time. I used it with a second child and it's like the day we bought it. I'm a mom of 6, so I've used a ton of these systems and this is by far my favorite!  It's comfortable,  the seat is deep, gender neutral and although the car seat is heavier, it's extremely well made and I feel safer having my girls in it. We have used this system on plane trips all over and never had one single problem. From zoos, to walks and even airplaines, our has seen it all and performed perfectly every time. It's sincerely AMAZING! !
B00LT4U4YI|4|Work great so far at keeping my baby from opening drawers he shouldn't be opening.  Easy to attach/install.  Not sure yet how it will be when we remove them, whether or not they'll leave a residue.  But happy with their intended purpose now!
B002ZB82CU|3|Mixed reviews on this, works fairly well during the day time when our newborn is just napping and isn't as bundled up.  We can't use during the night when she is swaddled since it continuously false alarms even at highest sensitivity.  We utilize with a mini crib that we roll from nursery to our bedroom so sensor pads are pretty close together and she is able to lie directly on them - still not very good at night.  Gave it a 3 because it does give us a little piece of mind during the daytime.
B00HPD4V1Y|3|My kids love the squeeze applesauce packets, so I had high hopes of saving a fortune with these.  Filling them was a messy process.  If you fill more than halfway, it will squeeze out the top when you try to seal it - makes a huge mess.  I stored the all in the fridge, and a day later had to take the shelf out and scrub out leaked applesauce and juice.  It happened every time I used them, so I finally gave up.
B000RFCXIK|4|Very convenient to throw in the diaper bag and go. Sometimes twisting the lid takes a bit more oomph than it should but all in all great product.
B00VHD6BUM|4|I got this booster seat for my 2 year old son because we are in desperate need of a booster seat he was sitting on boxes. This booster seat is not bulky and is really light. This booster seat is great it is adjustable at the top as well as on the legs for height as well as height of the seat itself to accommodate ages 18 months to 5 years of age so you can use this seat for a few years, the height is adjusted by push pins that click into a hole which makes it very secure, it has a 5-point harness which I love because my son never can figure out how to get out of them, it comes in many different colors so it's very versatile which I like and I chose orange because that's my son's favorite color which makes it very secure, it has a 5. Harness which I love because my son never figure out how to get out of it. They come in many different colors so they are very versatile. The seat itself is made out of a very nice durable wood and has safety secure push button that clicks so you know when the seat is safely locked open as well as you can push and click them to collapse the seat to carry or put away. This seat does require a little bit of time to figure out the right height as well as pushing in the buttons to adjust the seat can be a little tricky. This seat comes with a handy bag store easy travel and easy Carry as well as handle on the back of the back rest for easy Carry as well. My son absolutely loved this booster seat and I had to pry him to get out of it and it makes it more fun for him to want to sit at our dinner table to eat. The way this seat is made as well as what it is made out of  makes it for an easy clean after eating . The booster seat is very secure when it is set up correctly and at the proper height, it does not move and is very snug. Although I like most features about this booster seat the strap to go underneath the chair for proper security was actually too short so I had to figure out a different way to secure the bottom strap but i think it maybe because our chairs are a little wider on the seat then most as you can see with the picture i posted with this review compared to the one in sellers description. I suggest maybe they should make the bottom straps to fit around the seat of a chair long enough to fit all chairs, but I was still able to figure out a way to securely connect the bottom straps also the booster seat only works with straight back chairs so does put a little limitation on what type of chair you can put this seat on. I think this booster seat is great and I wish I had it when my two older boys were younger, i would purchase again if i ever need to either for myself or as a gift and i would definitely recommend this booster seat to any one with a small child. I recieved this product at a discounted price for my honest and unbiased review which in no way, shape or form alters my review this is 100 % my own view.
B001OC5UNA|3|This gate is VERY tall which is a plus in our home. However, the opening is VERY narrow.
B00C44OMV8|5|We have been transitioning our baby into higher flow nipples for a while now. Happy with the advent bottles and the price on amazon. Baby seems happy too!
B0073JM8RE|4|Exactly what I needed! Worked great for my daughter!
B00367IMGI|5|This came rolled up so some of the &#34;stickies&#34; were unstuck (but they'll still work) but that caused some concern as we didn't plan to use them immediately. Otherwise, these are cute and well made.
B0045I6IAO|5|The only pasafier my baby will take to. Stops him from crying. Love the green color and it washes well in dishwasher
B00CLV7TMI|5|Fast delivery, best hook and loop system in cloth diapering.
B007ETJQP0|2|It's cute looking and I was excited for it but the volume is so low you can't hear it. I even changed the batteries. The one I got is defective
B0011URFRE|4|We got this car seat in 2011 and we like it so much we purchaised another one for other car. The only thing i wish this car seat would have another cup holder. Other wose its a grear seat, very easy to clean and good unisex colors.
B00D4XZO2E|5|Great for the $ you're paying. I recomend for anyone that needs a light stroller that is affordable and sturdy. We received it very quick and love all of the storage it brings for a cup, under stroller and for a small bag on the back of the hood. Will definitely be giving it great use for a long time. Really happy with the 3 recline and 5 point hardness very safe for babies that like to throw themselves forward. He loves it!
B006SFUEF2|4|When we first got this sound machine it was amazing. The sound activation feature worked so well. As soon as our daughter would cry the music would come on for the set time frame. After 2 months the voice activation stopped working and amazon sent us a new one. Again the voice activation stopped working after a couple months. We gave up on that feature and just kept the machine since amazon and munchin wouldnt replace it again. Years later all the other features still work and we use it twice a day. Being able to set a timer for the music and projector is so nice. Our daughter loved it. She turns it on herself for nap and bed time.
B001QNFRSA|1|My son loves rattles and like to shake them.  However, the first two times he played with this one, he wound up hitting himself in the head and crying.  Because the rattle ends are very hard plastic and have parts that jut out, it really hurts when it bumps him in the head.  I took it away and haven't let him play with it since.  There are lots of other rattles out there that won't leave you with a crying baby.  Look for a lightweight one with rounded edges, either made of wood or with rubberized ends.  Sassy and Manhattan Baby have some good selections.
B000W4KAZO|5|Very we'll made. My kids love it.
B002WB2G8Y|1|I bought this as a gift for a baby shower and unfortunatly it took them too long to open it up and look at it. When they finaly went to use it The connecting piece of plastic on the bottom was cracked in half. Not a vital part of the stroller but it still doesn't make you comfortable about the materials being used.
B000JOQL82|4|A friend of mine suggested buying this potty for travel. I like the fact that it uses zip lock bags. It's easy to put together and folds up quickly. The only down side to this potty is that I have a boy and there is no pee shield on it. Probably better for girls than boys.
B00TMXAPB0|1|I was not impressed by this carrier at all. I was looking for a carrier that would equal something like an Ergo in quality without spending the money like on an Ergo, but you get what you pay for and I learned my lesson. The minute I pulled it out of the package I was disappointed. It wasn't in an actual product package, just a plastic bag. It was dirty and had a stain on it (isn't this supposed to be new?). There were zero directions with the carrier. And the cherry on the cake for me was when I was looking at the information printed on the carrier (such as weight limits) one number was crossed out with a blue pen and the correct number was written above it....very unprofessional. I also remember reading somewhere that it came with an infant insert which I thought was a bonus...mine did not come with one.<br /><br />The hood is a nice feature and is cute I'll give it that. But I would not trust this carrier to hold my baby.<br /><br />I ended up returning this product and buying an Ergo which I know is a quality product.
B003KTLYMG|5|I felt like a fool buying this for my children. I never had a wind and rain shield when I was growing up right. But the. My parents didn't take me out in blowing snow and -20 to walk the dog. This gives us a lot of flexibility and seems to be holding up well after a couple months of almost daily use. A little steep in price but then you don't get nothin' for nothin'
B00IYCA600|5|I like it. It's easy to use and u can remove and re-use it.
B000BN63NE|5|These things aren't totally well made, and will sometimes develop rips along where the elastic is, but they are incredibly soft, and never stain despite major poop blowouts from my infant. That is not true of say, a cotton terry cloth one I got from BRU. Prefer these.
B002UD65S6|5|This sheet is so soft and very nice sage color. I did read reviews of it shrinking, so I washed mine on cold and let it dry on top of the washer vs drying in the dryer. Would definitely recommend.
B003LQVZQ8|5|I purchased this for my great grandaughter who is now 5-1/2 months old. She absolutely loves to play in this. She's not quite able to sit on her own, but we put a light blanket around to hold her more upright and she loves to bounce in this. I purchased this since the base looked very solid and secure. This is one of the best items we have purchased for her. She loves the activity toys and we would definitely recommend this item to anyone to enjoy watching their baby laugh and bounce. GREAT ITEM!
B000058DQJ|5|These are great. Although i had a couple spills. You have to be cautious not to move around and lift the cup. But i will say they relieve a lot of the pressure and i got 1 1/2 oz of milk in each cup.
B002LUPZCK|3|The umbrella is great. Love the size and it is good quality. The down size is that the attachment to the stroller is difficult to use because it is hard to move (sun changes direction).
B005N0RH0S|5|My kids live this cup!
B008J4FHZ2|1|Love it...except the nipple collapses every time she is eating. The little &#34;venting dimple&#34; doesn't work:(
B000U5LXU6|5|Love this!! We have pets that need to be kept out of our living room. This works great, we just open up the gate to block the entry way now they are allowed in by invitation only. This is very attractive and durable.
B00IABI87S|5|IT'S THE 2ND GIRAFFE I'VE ORDERED.  BOTH HAVE BEEN GIFTS. THE 1ST WAS WELL RECEIVED AS I EXPECT THIS ONE WILL BE.
B0009Y8JNW|4|Works great, but son figured out pretty quickly how to bump open the gate when it's not locked.  Will need to lock for most clever toddlers.
B00192LH3C|5|This stroller is wonderful.  After trying a side by side stroller, a double jogger, and trying to \\"get by\\" with a single stroller, I have finally found a stroller that works for all my needs. It can hold an infant seat, folds up quick and easy, is light weight, and is convenient for a busy toddler who doesn't always like to ride in a baby stroller.  I love the parent organizer and I think it is better than the hard type.  It has lots of room for everything. My infant is comfortable in her infant seat and my toddler loves to jump on and off and try sitting and standing.  She thinks it is a fun ride.  It is really quite short for a double stroller, especially without the infant seat attachment.  You won't feel silly pushing a huge stroller with only one kid in it like I always seem to end up doning. The one thing I was worried about was where to put the diaper bag?  Well, I have found the answer!  I purchased a skip hop double duo bag and it attaches great along the side of the stroller!  It frees up the bench area and is really easy to get at all the stuff.  Yes, they do say on their web site that it is only meant for a double side by side stroller, but I do not see any reason why.  The only thing is, depending on how stuffed your bag is, it does make the stroller a bit wider, but I am still able to get through all doorways.  I would reccomend this stroller to anyone with two kids.  It has made our life a little bit easier to manage.
B001OC5UNK|2|First of all, the metal is flimsy and the gate doesn't easily open and shut. Secondly, while it is designed to be able to span a large gap, keep in mind that you must use one or two of the attachments to make it that wide. Our opening was, I think, 44 inches wide, which made it difficult. If you used both attachments, it wouldn't fit. If you used just one, then it was a bit too small, even when expanding the screws on the side. But my main complaint is how small the opening that you walk through is. We have one of these at the bottom of our stairs. When walking down the stairs and trying to pass through the opening, you need to turn your body to avoid hitting the sides. We are not large people. Most people that have these gates have small kids and are often carrying them through the gate. Good luck with that!
B00EHOCZ30|5|My new grandson is going to love it. He's due in March
B001CW0XRU|4|I would give this 5 stars because of the quality but the price was a little high for this kind of toy. My kids are mildly interested in it- it's something you need to do with them or it'll get lost in the bottom of the toy box.
B005VDX3ZK|5|I barely have words for how much I love this thing. It attaches to strollers, carts, bassinets. It folds up easily for travel and I bring this everywhere and my daughters face lights up when she sees it. She loves smiling and grabbing at the butterfly, eating the danging bug, crinkling the flowers, spinning the pinwheel.  It's very, very well made and adorable, much, much cuter in person.  It has multiple adjusting pivot points so you can move it up or down, side to side, forward and back.  I started using it when she was 3 months and now, at 9 months, she still loves it.
B009ZU44AI|3|I have tried many many &#34;no spill, no drip&#34; cups and was hoping these would be the answer all at the same time allowing me to transition from bottle to cup.  These cups are designed in a way that is very very easy for my 15 month to empty the contents out everywhere including himself.
B00DYOQQDE|5|I rest easy knowing my sons travel in Recaro car seats. We have a pair of ProRide and a pair of Performance SPORT.
B007BEHSDU|5|Work great. My son 14 months and fits almost to the last notch. fit very well
B0039UULYS|4|Super cute frame - I have these for 2 of my kids baby prints/photos. The only issue I have with it, is they give you one inkless pad to do the prints and if you mess up, the mess ups are obvious to see. Also, because there is only one pad, if you do the hand print first, you are bound to see some of that same print when you do the foot print second. And if you mess up and try to do it again, forget it!  Its a good product, but would be better if they included more than one inkless pad.
B004Y3FW8Y|4|My grandson is crazy about the Reds and so I guess my greatgrandson will too.  The blanket is soft and the bear is cuddly.
B003G2YUTG|5|Best potty around! My daughter loves the music!
B003D3NW4M|3|These are incredibly thin wash cloths, but I am ok with it because i will be using them as cloth wipes. I wouldnt like these for actual baths for my baby because of how thin they are. I prefer a wash cloth that is thick and more towel like than these
B000CP2X9O|4|These bibs are great. They're soft, a good size (not too big or too small) and waterproof but completely terry covered (unlike cheaper bibs that have exposed vinyl on the back). I'd give them five stars, but I dislike that these are considered &#34;Boys&#34; even though they're all just basic colors and don't include pink or purple. I also think it's odd that two of them are almost the exact same color.
B00FOL7LDO|4|Came fast but I have problems wrapping it up to go, the instructions  suck on that part
B000WJLKQM|5|This thing is the best purchase ever for a baby! Your baby can gain leg strength bouncing. My daughter is 4 months old and loves getting in this and twirling around to look from room to room. It's also great to put a baby in (still within view) to give you time to get a few minutes to clean bottles, dishes, etc!
B00AJSIQCW|4|We have 3 grandsons under the age of 1/1/2 years old so this carseat is the perfect fit for each baby.  We have it in our car, so no need to transfer carseats when they come to visit.  Initial set up took some time to adjust, but, once we got it done, works well.
B00J0O74K6|5|We use these as water bottles for the whole family. Very useful and fun.
B002PU96BW|4|This is a very sturdy product that will definitely hold a toddler and 200-lb parent for bedtime reading. The color is nice and the quality good. However, assembly was difficult for an individual because the slats slide out easily while installing. The process took 45 minutes, but would have been a half hour or less for two people. Overall good investment.
B000HVA4YE|3|Although the animals on this crib set are very cute and I liked the look online, when it showed up it was MUCH darker than it showed online. I was looking for the paler colors, and it looked like it would be closer to a sage or mossy green, but it's quite dark, and the lion that looks kind of golden is actually orange. Not what we wanted, and I will be sending it back.
B003NL7TL6|4|Arrived in good condition and product is in original packaging. The membranes are easily damaged with frequent washing and sterilizing, important to have extra for replacement.
B004X0WC54|5|My 2 year old granddaughter loves the purse and things in it. She carries it all the time, so that makes me very happy
B00004TFLB|5|This toy is amazing for all children. I have given this music box to each of my grandchildren and they have all been overjoyed. I recommend this toy highly. It is fun, educational, musical and it is truly the gift that just keeps \\"playing.\\"
B00GUU9ZOG|5|We gave this as a gift to friends expecting their first child. We used one (a few actually) for our kid and it was great. She slept like, well, a baby! Easy to use and much better than traditional swaddling.
B000JOT2RO|1|My 1 year old can easily pull this up from tray. Doesn't have very good suction
B003TMTG1K|5|This is sooo great for keeping bugs and uninvited hands off of my baby!!  It's elastic on the front and the back so it should stretch over pretty much any carrier.  I had a larger Britax car seat and it fit fine.  The color is nice too...not exactly cotton candy pink...a little more saturated, but definitely still feminine.  This was also nice for me because my car seat was not very feminine.  Haven't tried machine washing it but I'm going to give it a shot soon...there's milk sneeze on the screen!  I definitely recommend this product.
B010RWGMOI|5|Great pads for baby changing tables, cribs and play pens. They are super soft very silky. Have a thick material on the back with lots of cushion. Edges are rounded sewing quality is superior no loose threads. Comes in a three pack white. They are very handy especially when you have those poop blow out days. Just toss in the wash and your done.
B00AHG8GUS|4|Wish it was a little bigger. But I still love it!
B000EIGJQ2|5|I love this gate! we have it on the steps between the wall and a railing. I bought the adapter to secure it on the railing better, but I wasted my money:( we don't need it. It holds fine with out it and holds tight it stands up to my 8 year old slamming it closed. (yes it does shut on its on not sure why he likes to slam it lol) and my 20 month old trying to break it down it hasn't budged!!!! lol
B0000DEW8N|5|Compared to other similar products, this by far is superior.  It is well built and easy to carry around.  Our 14 month old son loves sitting in this chair when we got out as compared to the standard restaurant high chair which he easily wiggles out of.
B00DNBA82S|5|Absolutely the best baby monitor on the market and I am the Grand Daddy who purchased for the kids after a lot of research and a couple of duds they tried out. Made one mistake did not buy the second receiver as we have seen the need already when mommy is worn out a dead to the world because he was a little early and they have her feeding him every hour on the hour and dad did not have the receiver outside. The remote panning of the camera is great. From ordering to shipping to using No problems and no issues. As I said the kids bought some sale priced ones and they had horrible pictures and the sound didn't work on either and they are well promoted and well know names. If you can try before you buy and then buy the best Foscam FBM3501 Wireless Digital Video Baby Monitor.
B004IYAVGM|5|Great item my baby lost it and had to buy a new one..
B00OZRTNMA|4|Excelent
B000JVVXM4|4|it a great stroller my only this likes is i have a 8 month old baby and i have to hold him when i'm trying to fold the stroller and it very hard to do!
B001GQ2P78|5|We had originally used a different brand infant sound machine with our daughter, and searched for something better because it had several issues, including all but one awful &#34;white noise&#34; sounds, volume control, no power outage backup, and no way to tell if the timer button had been pushed, either accidentally by us or on purpose by our daughter (meaning several nights of us having to sneak in and turn it back on after it had shut off). This sound machine completely solved all of those issues--awesome, true white noise sounds that seem soothing, quality controls, and battery backup. The blue light it emits isn't too bright for our daughter's room, although we choose to not use the night-light function for now. A couple of the white noises are more nature oriented, one with a whale sound and the other with crickets. Although an adult may find this soothing, we don't think they would be to our toddler, so we don't ever use those. The music option is nice, offering classical music we can listen to while winding down for bedtime after bath. The auxiliary jack is great, too, but we rarely use it because that would mean making sure the iPod is charged...not a priority for us at the time, but a nice option, nonetheless.
B0042RU2VY|3|My babies just didn't interact with it much as it didn't have rings to grab hold of. It is very soft and cute however.
B00PL1KVV6|1|Something is wrong with the front lip of ours making it impossible for it to suction to anything.
B0018MOHTO|1|If your child NEVER falls asleep in the car then by all means buy this seat. If they do, like most kids, then buyer beware. the sides aren't very deep so when your child falls asleep he will be suspended by the seat belt somewhere between his lap and the insufficent side wings.....hopefully staying in the middle (LOL)(because, as the two Evenflo Reps that I spoke with today, said) The seatbelt will yank them back in case of a crash.......which is better it be in the middle than to say be yanked back sideways (which is how my son winds up)into the plastic side wings.  They don't consider it a flaw that your kid won't stay back in the seat if asleep.....one Rep even told me that her kid leans forward and bobbles around too....great! I guess if you get the seat for free and don't mind ignoring the fact that in a crash your child will most likely be paralized from what ever part of his spine yanks back into the hard plastic seat then fine...good luck sleeping at night.  The must be oblivious to the fact that you could be hit IN THE SIDE....really how many crashed do you see that are head on crashes?  Save your money, there are better seats out there with REAL side wings that DO PROTECT you kid from side impact and ALSO allow them to fall asleep with out hanging themselves on the seat belt.
B00SBOPUW0|5|These blankets r worth the $! My daughter loves her new blanket! Fast shipping great quality totally worth every cent!
B0032FOOQ6|5|I have very wide steps.  Most of the very wide gates I looked at had swing doors that had to be permanently anchored, which I did not want to do.  They also had a bar across the bottom that I was afraid would cause someone to trip and fall down the steps.<br /><br />My granddaughter just started walking and the fabric gate was custom made for my needs.  The design is very similar to tension rods used for curtains.  It is simple to put up and take down. I store it vertically behind my armoire when not in use.  When the time comes that I will no longer require a safety gate, the gate is easy to take apart and very compact to store.<br /><br />Nice product.
B00511SG3Q|5|love it
B0000A1O7P|4|My husband and I were invited to a kids birthday party and they had registered at Toy's R Us, this item was on their list. I don't remember how much it was at the store, but I do know that I found a better deal here, reason why I bought it. The people we bought it for said it was very good they used it all of the time. They never experienced any problems with it I believe they still use it to this day.
B004HV73M6|5|It's perfect...exactly what we wanted! All the features are great! Almost don't even need the nursery :) My son loves it, my husband loves the look, and I love the functionality!
B000RRD7UG|5|Beat product to keep your car seats clean and make them visible.
B002WLGV08|5|We bought the Snuza Go! because my son had an Apparent Life Threatening Event. We were sent home from the hospital with an apnea monitor, but found it to be a nuisance and more nerve racking then helpful. We decided to try the Snuza Go! because it was portable, wireless, and can clip onto his diaper, any article of clothing, and carseat strap. It has been an amazing product to help ease my mommy paranoia after such a scary event.
B00DQL6HQG|5|I had no idea how hard it was to find a plain baby bathrobe, and not one that wasn't a ducky, or sparkly, or whatever. This fit the bill just right--I used it to dress my son up as the Dude from The Big Lebowski for Halloween (I was Walter).
B00E1CI2TO|5|excelent
B00G4C0HEW|5|This is a great product and a real improvement on other Tot training seats.  OXO is a great brand, noted for good design and good implementation.  This seat is easy to clean and the splatter shield really does the job.  The handles on the side make it more secure and tots feel secure hanging on to them for balance.  The handles are helpful for a child to being it back and forth to the toilet.  All in all this is a well thought out and carefully executed product that lives up to the OXO name.  Now if it just came in colors.....
B00WFBNYYQ|5|I ordered this product at an amazing discount and now that I've seen what it can do I would've paid full price to try it! It's amazing how much better it works than other products we've tried. This is a must have to keep in the medicine cabinet
B001NAAQN2|5|At first the price kind of scared me but after owning these bad boys for a couple months I am ready to say; Can you really put a price tag on not having to change your church clothes 5 minutes before you have to walk out the door to church?  These things are like the sham-wows of burp rags and big enough you quit wondering if you should break down and buy a water-proof poncho.  Well worth the money for my cute reflux baby!!
B000324Y7U|5|We have throughly loved the Ocean Wonders Bouncer.  Nathan loves the movement of the fish in the water, the music, and the vibrating.  I would highly recommend this product for anyone who has a small baby.
B00JE0FJEO|1|dont waste your money
B005NPTNDM|1|Save your money. This is so cheap and flimsy compared to the older model. Also, does not fit the 2011 Revo properly as the new Revo is wider than the older models.The weather shield is too tight and too short, it barely stays in place and rain/wind definately gets in. I have had 2 other bobs(so I am not a Bob newbie!), both with weather shields and this one is not worth it!
B0006OG6RQ|5|This is the only product that will work on my daughter- and I mean the ONLY-
B006YBHE6M|5|I bought this for a friend for her new baby. She told me the baby loves it. Great purchase, you won't be sorry.
B000EZW80Q|4|My toddler loves this seat and it's pretty easy to install back and forth into my different cars.  The price was pretty nice as well...not the cheapest but not the most expensive either.  The only issue I have with it is the cup holders....my 1 year old figured how to take those out within 2 seconds of his first time sitting in it.  Also, adjusting the strap tension is a little hard as well..but other than that, I really think it's a good seat!
B009S59PFE|3|It says it's a bean bad but it's not a bean bag. It has big foam pieces inside, like packaging noodles. Thankfully my 3 year old doesn't seem to mind it. The print on the noodle bag is very nice, as well as the fabric.<br /><br />Product shouldn't be marketed as a bean bag when it's not even close to being true. I would not buy again if I had to!
B00IRGX6HS|2|I really liked this clip until my baby pulled it off an started waving it around in the air. The metal clip hit her in the face and left a nasty red welt. Not safe. I never used it again and threw several of them away. I would never recommend these. We use the JJ cole with the plastic clip that has a rubberized coating. No problems.
B000GCE5C6|5|Exactly what we needed
B009FRKXKG|1|didn't last very long
B003Y3BGZ8|5|Well, has proved very useful, since the use of, the baby toys do not fall to the ground, and I do not always help her pick up toys, good, if longer cheaper better
B000EBCFZ8|2|I received a set of bibs with a trim made of a different fabric than the rose satin pictured--it's a pink and white flowered print in a non-satiny fabric.  I also have this set in sage green, which came with the pictured satin fabric. The green satin trim completely frayed in the wash and pulled away from the terry cloth as other reviews have described. Oddly, the white satin bibs are just fine. While I'm happy with the way the rose set has held up over the past 3 months, I wouldn't order this product again because the quality has been so inconsistent.  If I received another set with satin trim, I would send it back immediately.
B001C51TIE|5|Perfect
B000LP3VAK|5|I absolutely LOVE this stroller!!  I have a 6 week old and a 23 month old and we use this almost daily.  It's great at the library, the mall, walking in the park or walking trail and we even take it in for grocery shopping so we have the cart for food.  Turning radius is great, the handles are very comfortable and we have gotten a few compliments on the looks.  My older daughter loves the snack cup for her Gerber Puffs or for raisins.  Our one and only complaint is that it's kinda heavy to lift in the back of our minivan, but it IS a double so it's not a big deal.  Besides, maybe it'll build up my arm muscles.
B00568MOOG|5|Fantastic product. I have 5 of these around my house. They are large - this is important because if you want to keep using this as your baby grows taller, some other cheaper products just won't do. They wash and dry easily. Totally worth the $10.
B007QQFN58|4|I didn't get to see it, but my great-granddaughter, the new baby's mommy, loved it.  Their new baby is a girl, but they like country and cowboy themes.  Go figure.
B00PTL13LA|4|This is a much more comfortable setup for my little guy than our last high chair.  It gives him the extra support to sit up and I like the storage underneath.  My cat uses the under part as a hammock.  :-/  My only complaint is that the straps are not easy to clean at all.  I feel like they are never fully clean.  It's frustrating but overall I like this product.
B0009OLSZ8|5|This is the best potty chair!  My son used it for the first time at 15 months and will still use it now at 2.  It is the perfect size and he always looks very comfortable on it.  It's easy to empty, easy to clean, and we almost never have a problem concerning the height of the splash guard.  This is one of the best purchases I've made for him!
B00GHAGRUE|5|My husband hates diaper bags because they are not &#34;manly&#34;.  This is perfect for a man and his baby.
B0065JVATK|5|My daughter is in kindergarten and this is perfect to put her snacks.  It's a good size for a young child.
B006SFUEN4|3|These are okay, good enough.  My child uses them occasionally, ended up giving the rest away.  We like the Vital Baby Toddler Straw cup much better.
B00F2MQ0K0|5|Great product
B00XSZVFH6|3|It's just ok I'm not satisfied because its very tight even my daughter does not have bigger legs she's normal in weight not very healthy. & pads on it are also slippery. So she's not comfortable wearing this even I tried to make her wear inside pants But still now I'm thinking to return will buy different one.
B000RHYPS4|5|My shipment came quickly. I am very happy with the quality of my product. I like it a lot better than the boppy pillows!
B00II064CC|5|Such a beautiful sheet -- colors are vibrant, looks great in the nursery. And I love that it's made in the USA. Couldn't find anything else like it; worth the small splurge!
B00F2MQ2BW|4|This jumperoo has a lot of activities to entertain baby and allow them to jump at the same time.  It's nice that they can spin all the way around  so it's good to let them look in a variety of directions.<br /><br />I like the seat is machine washable but all the same I try to make sure the child is changed right before to try to avoid any diaper leaks.<br /><br />My issue with this is my home is small so it takes up most of the room.  It's definitely something you need to consider when deciding where to put it.<br /><br />Overall, it is a nice activity center to let your child play and learn for a few minutes when you need your hands free to do something.
B00LUJFBCW|2|Not as thick as some sheets, probably wouldn't buy it again.
B00BEVF1W6|5|The Britax Frontier 90 Booster Car Seat, Onyx is amazing.<br />My grand son is autistic and he would always figure out how to get out of his<br />car seat. With this Britax Frontier 90 Car Seat he can not do that and he is happy<br />to be in it. It's roomy and not binding in any way. I would recommend this car seat<br />for any child.
B000058DPL|1|I used this with my medela Pisa from 2005 and it burned up the motor! Had to buy a whole new pump
B00KDKKD1I|5|These pillows are the perfect size for little heads.  I got them for my niece and nephew for their birthdays and made pillow cases for them.  Customer service is really great, too.
B0052PM09M|5|I bring this little cooler to work and stick it in the freezer... then by the time i'm ready to pump its nice and cold to store in the fridge until i get off. My commute is 30 minutes that may or may not have traffic... so I know that this will keep my milk that i pumped from going bad.
B00I39194Q|5|We decorated my kid's room with this alphabet stickers and he loves it. The size of the stickers of alphabet and objects are just perfect. Peeling and sticking them on the wall is very easy and we loved decorating my kids' room's wall.
B00F6TZ8FM|5|Great flavor.  I love the variety packs to give my child a daily choice, so toothbrushing is never an argument.
B001A67AE2|5|This toy is scented/flavored and my baby is kind of obsessed with food right now and just like the other reviewer said, he spends up to 30 minutes chewing on this and smacking his lips. he loves it. it also rolls (kinda) and bounces. I wish they had more flavors.
B000GYBVNU|5|These are the best bibs I have ever used!  They work really well - they absorb really well and they don't stain.  You can wash and dry them in the machine and they look like new every time!
B0042D69V0|3|My 27\\" tall son is about 4 inches to short to be able to touch his toes to the floor and the seat is on the lowest level.  He'll be crawling before he can jump in it, or be tall enough to be able to turn the chair on his own; which is stupid in my opinion.  But he seems to really enjoy the two moveable toys.  There are some stationary toys that are pointless, everything should do something on these jumpers but I couldn't find one that was modeled after that idea. The two hanging toys frustrate the heck out of him, his arms just aren't long enough to reach them and they just hang there, taunting him, he gets upset and he's done with the jumper after about 10 minutes.
B003CUXV0Q|5|Fit perfectly!
B001OC5UMQ|5|Gate construction is excellent but didn't fit in my doorway! Extension made it too wide but needed a little more on gate?
B000XW65SG|5|Really nice tub.  I love the color.  It was a hit at the baby shower.
B00OHW2QMM|3|Cubes worked great for the party.  The next day my kids wanted to use them and I noticed a rusty colored film in their drink.  These are only good for a few hours.  Also, these are pretty small.  We bought glow cubes before from Sureglow.com and they were much bigger.
B002GPVER0|5|I needed something to get the snot my newborn couldn't get rid of himself. It did the job much easier and more effectively than a bulb syringe;)
B004FN0Z44|4|This is lightweight and fairly small but has 0 space for any diaper bag underneath, almost 0 space actually. Also, I am 6'1 and 230lbs, I was car shopping and did not see the stroller, stepped on the wheel and bent it, it is not broken.<br /><br />I only paid 39.99. For what it is, it is worth it (other than wheel bending) the ride is harsh and by no means is it a great stroller. I bought it because I needed space and compared to the huge one that I had that fit the car seat, its a joke BUT for what I need/used it for, I was satisfied.<br /><br />HOWEVER, at this price of 50+ that I now see, I will not be buying a replacment and I would not spend that kind of money on this.
B004L2JJ78|4|I bought this for my son to use in the car.  It's fine except the front needs some kind of closure or else the sides just open up and down goes the head.  I sewed on a ring and a hook to keep it closed.
B00CWN8IK2|1|I purchased 2 of these. Both have leaked so badly out of the bottom. The quality is very poor
B000CP2X9O|5|Our 10wk old spits up half his meal every time he nurses.  We went through outfits constantly until we found these bibs. They are super absorbent and cover him well (we use 3-6mo sizes). Would definitely buy again.
B000LZFZVS|5|Great quality ande the case helps keep all in their places
B007VBYVVA|1|These are one ply and very thin! Unusable as diapers and you can blow through two of them during one feeding and still have spit up leak through to your clothes. Buy the 3 ply or 6 ply instead.
B002U1G3NK|4|Wish it was a bit larger. Otherwise it's very stylish & I've received many compliments.
B001NJC5QY|1|I very rarely take the time to write a review on a product but I felt compelled to do it immediately because this seat SHOULD BE RECALLED!!! My 4 month old just received this as a Christmas gift from his grandparents and it is very cheaply made. The plastic ring that goes around the seat is thin, brittle and sharp. The safety belt buckle is so crappy I could hardly compress the plastic enough on one side to get it unbuckled to get my son out. Here's my major concern... The foam insert does not even fit flush against the booster seat and that creates little hand sized gaps around the front... Where my son can and does reach. I could definitely see my son exploring with his little fingers and getting pinched or even stuck just from his body weight pushing against the foam.  This seat is so not worth injury or even losing a finger. MAJOR FAIL for Summer Infant, a company that usually makes good baby products. Will be returning today for a Bumbo seat with a table.
B008Z76L2Q|2|This plug worked, but didn't give as much power as needed to properly run the device.  Not worth the money.  Just buy the real medela replacement plug.
B004HM63DA|5|My 7 month old and 3 year old love this bath toy.
B005VM62QS|1|Our daughter is only two months old and this car seat has already failed.  The release mechanism jammed and we could not get the car seat removed from the base.  I took the car seat and the base out of my wife's car and using a crowbar, a hammer and a pair of vice grips I still was not able to get the seat and the base apart.  Do not purchase this item!!!!
B003U6HCGQ|5|I needed a mobile for a pack and play and this works great!  It is very cute and keeps the baby entertained!
B00EYN5Z4A|5|The product is good quality and installs nice and easy. It is well thought out with a number of different types and sizes of pockets. It has really helped me eliminate the mess in the back of my car. I find the umbrella holder, key holder, and bottle holder to be nice touches that differentiate it from a number of other organizers I looked at and come handy for many of those awkward shaped things. Even the kids love it, what else can I ask for?<br />Only minor improvement I would like to see is the string to tie it up on the bottom be an elastic and use the pressure clips that winter jackets often use on their hoods. That would make it even easier to install and fit a variety of seats.
B0002OT00U|5|Love these!! Always my shower gifts!
B00AHVR5U0|5|I love the versatility! We keep the pack n play on our main floor & use it frequently for diaper changes. The bassinets is great for keeping baby in your room the first few weeks. We also carry it all over the house to hold baby in (for example, she lays in it in the bathroom while I shower). It was a great purchase!
B00K5MS0T6|5|Great get up and go bag. I use it on the weekends when I don't need  whole bunch of stuff. It is light weight and durable. The Tokidoki design makes it so fun. Just an fyi, not just for mom's.
B00CMOL0XI|5|Wash easily on the top shelf in the dishwasher and the divided sections are nice and deep. Worth paying a little extra for a better quality plate unlike the cheap ones you usually see in stores. Using them for our second child too!
B00094NPOU|5|This cover rocks if you use it right.<br /><br />Sizing: Newborn fits until about 3-4 months, then size small from there on out. Medium seems like it might fit a 7-year-old, so I don't know which babies those are meant for.<br /><br />Use: Excellent over fitted diapers or well-secured Kissaluvs hybrid contours. Not good for prefolds.<br /><br />These are my favorite covers, and I own them all. This cover is economical, holds in wetness, comfy for baby (no red lines!), and very trim under clothes.
B005XJ2VGE|5|I just received this 4-in-1 highchair at my baby shower and so far (having put it together, but not used it since my baby is not here yet), it is everything I hoped it would be and more.<br /><br />It was really easy to put together (okay, the footrest was pretty difficult, but we got it with a little elbow grease.) and it seems VERY easy to adjust.  The one I had for my last baby had plenty of similar bells and whistles, but in order to move it up and down, I had to push in tiny pegs and lift, etc.  This one adjusts with really simple levers, instead of buttons that can pinch your fingers.<br /><br />The only \\"nice to know\\" comment I have is that it's really a 4-in-2, meaning that one of the 4 functions is a totally separate booster seat (like the kind you could bring to a restaurant-fairly compact and very simple design).  But it is not incorporated into the highchair at all, so if you're tight on storage space, you would have to find somewhere to store this part.  That was not a big deal or a reason to lower my rating, just thought people might want to know that.
B000G82J3M|5|These are one of the best little gifts I have ever bought my daughter - that's why I ordered a second set from Amazon for my niece. From the day we bought them she has carried them around in their little case and played with them. They go to bed with her - in the tub with her - Everywhere!!! <br /> <br />I also ordered the 8 coloured duckies from 'Elegant Baby' because she loved these so much. <br /> <br />If you have a child that loves bathtime like mine - these animal & duckie squirties are a wonderful toy.
B00FA4WL4O|5|I bought these cute cards for a baby shower that I was hosting a few months ago. The shower was for a baby boy, but the cards are so gender-neutral I think they'd work for a boy or a girl. They were a huge hit with the guests, and helped spark conversations among people who really didn't know one another very well. I think everyone had fun filling out the cards and sharing baby stories! The cards are also a great, personalized keepsake for mom and dad. When the baby was born a couple weeks ago, the parents had a lot of fun reading through everyone's predictions!
B00KFOWKWC|5|I love my Nuby Freezer Tray. It works great. I love making my own food and just pooping one square out to thaw at a time.
B00GEF7I8W|5|Great quality. Does not leak. Came as pictured.
B00AU30GDS|5|New mother loved this diaper clutch because of all the great compartments and ease of opening.  Happy that it was a hit at the baby shower!
B00005BX52|1|I bought these because our stove top knobs are very easy to accidentally turn. This issue has caused numerous scary gas leaks. Although there were many negative reviews about this product, I decided to purchase it anyways. BIG mistake. This product arrived in packaging that looks like it is from the 1980's, and perhaps it is. In addition, this product looks like junk. Furthermore, it does absolutely NOTHING! DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT! Although cheap, it is a waste of money. I do not know the solution to our problem, but I do know that this is not it and I STRONGLY advise anyone not to waste their time and money on this product.
B003EUEUVS|5|Great customer service! Decal look amazing on my sons playroom wall. Had a small issue due to defect but this company went above and beyond! Wish more companies treated their customers this way - plus the decal looks super cute! Very satisfied with my purchase.
B00OV5ODEE|1|Car seat fit perfectly in the bag. Used on one trip (two flights). I picked up the bag at the carousel and it already had a rip/tear in it. Disappointed after all the glowing reviews. The rip is on the bottom panel where the car seat bottom edge was sitting.<br /><br />Update: I've attempted to contact the company regarding the rip after one use of this product. I completed their online contact form requesting to be contacted back and have heard no response after multiple weeks. I tried to call them using the number posted on their website and you hear fax-like sounds and then the line disconnects. I would not recommend using this company as it appears they have no customer service. Decreased from 2-stars to 1-star as a result.
B00HY0OIYI|5|Got this as a gift and I'm really happy with the quality for the price of it. There's a lot of different pieces and the design of it is perfect.
B00MS9VO88|5|Bought this for my daughter's family, they are expecting their second child.  She loves it!
B001QFDHC6|4|It had the adapter piece I needed, and now I have extra parts just in case. Was what it said
B00073HJG8|5|This thing is great to reduce the stuffed animal / doll clutter! It holds a lot and is durable.  Its a great way to get the kids to put the 'animals to bed' too.
B0002ZOI9W|5|I had this rocker for my first daughter, although it didn't have the fancy bar at the time.  I never had a bouncy seat - just this and loved it.  We had this until she was about 5 years old and I gave it to a neighbor with a newborn.  Now I am expecting my 2nd child and this is the first thing I put on my registry.  The product is well worth the money - it grows with the child.  I never had issues with the chair coming forward over my child because I did not use the rocker feature with her unless I was assisting her and until she became old enough to put her feet on the floor.  I would put a basket of books next to her rocker and she loved to sit and \\"read\\" the books.  I would highly recommend this product.
B000LPZTQY|5|I would recomend this pump. It had been working very nicely.
B003Q6CU12|1|The product works great, at first, but the second you force the USB connector in it will fall out from the board inside.  You will not be able to recharge it, and it will no longer be usable as there is no other way to get it power.<br /><br />The first one we had, when the connector broke, I opened it up to fix and found that the piece you stick the USB recharging cable into was only barely connected to the board to begin with, with no bracket holding it in at all.  I 'fixed' it a bit, but the connectors where broken off so it wasn't very reliable, and since we already had a few cameras for it, I foolishly purchased another monitor, with another camera since you can not purchase the monitor separately, and simply tried to be more careful this time around.  Well, that lasted about 30 days, since the new one is now not working too, due to the same manufacturing flaw.<br /><br />It is a shame, because it is otherwise a very good product, and this flaw could be fixed very inexpensively with a simple bracket holding that one piece to the board more firmly, but it isn't.<br /><br />So, do not waste your time as I have mine, and look elsewhere.
B0007PHO3O|5|This is the third one I am buying for my almost two year old son. I bought two before but we lost one and I afraid if we loose this one he would be so mad.  I recommend this toy to new mothers who are seeking for a comforting stuffed animal.
B00EIMW0G8|5|Love this swim diaper! The buttons on the sides are a huge time saver and so much easier when you have a wet baby to remove the diaper.
B00PAUF0PK|4|This Bright Stars Sunny Safari Baby's Play Place is best described as a set or collection of toys with a floor mat.  It's ideal for monitored tummy time and also for laying the baby on its back.  There's a variety of toys so the baby won't get bored and will have lots of sensory stimulation from the textures, sounds and colors.<br /><br />I like how all the toys are detachable so you could add them to a car seat with the rings, stuff them into a diaper bag when you're on the run, etc.<br /><br />The 10 Toys include:<br />(1) a crocodile and (2) lion pictures with crinkly paper inside that will give sound feedback to the baby when they play with it<br />(3) a large hard plastic elephant with ears that can light up<br />(4) hard plastic monkey teething ring with three flat beads (a bead chaser toy)<br />(5) a cloud-shaped toy with a clear tube with beads inside (rattling noise)<br />(6) and (7) two leaf-shaped teethers, one yellow and one green<br />(8) a flexible non-glass, baby-safe mirror<br />(9) small tummy-support pillow<br />(10) soft giraffe (has a muffled soft rattle inside)<br /><br />The mat is on the thin side, so it would be best to put a yoga mat or sleeping mat (like for camping) underneath it for more support.  The mat is covered with cute and colorful fabric, but the area is not huge.  The baby will still need close monitoring while playing in/with this, especially if she or he is old enough to crawl.  The sides can be folded up to make an enclosure with the four-way arch where the baby can see them lying on its back, or all the whole mat can be laid flat for a bigger surface area when they start crawling.<br /><br />I like the lights, but the music (like most toys with music) will get old quickly, but it's easy to leave that feature off.<br /><br />The set is shipped in a sturdy reuseable tote for storage or transport, which is a nice touch.  The set is om the expensive side compared to similar products, but I like the variety of toys that come with the play place.
B00HUCVNGQ|5|The minky side is grey, which is not shown in the photo. Wish it were longer on the sides (I have a Chicco Keyfit 30), but overall happy with the product.
B00P7OM2EQ|5|Very good
B000YFY5U2|5|Our dining room is a high traffic, low space room so we chose a table mounted seat for our second child instead of a full sized high chair. It works well, very sturdy (I was a little nervous about this type of seat at first) and easy to clean. We also are able to take it with us when we travel so that's a HUGE plus!
B001H3KR5C|5|very easy to use and makes it easy when I go out to shop with my baby!!!<br />It looks small though, anxious to see how it will fit as baby gets bigger
B003TRVFJG|1|what possible use could these visors be at 3 feet above the children's heads? Also the wheel got stuck. Sent it back.
B004C053AG|5|My daughter refused a bottle. Tried everything even the Adiri. I would dread going to work (the very few hrs I do work) because I knew she was going to not eat until I got home. I do not have to worry any longer with the Comotomo...feels very natural....skin like,and the nipple is just the right size. Also, the milk *sprays out* like a breast. Not just 1 hole like all other bottles. Finaly I can relax about leaving her with daddy:) try this one if you breast feed!
B00003TL7P|4|My wife and I looked at the size of the Diaper Genie and realized that it was much smaller then the Champ.  In addition we didn't want the extra cost of purchsing specially made diaper pail liners.  With the champ we can purchase the bulk garbage bag liners at Costco for th  Champ refills.  The only slight Negative is the lid release.  It is at times difficult to open.  But other then this  we are quite satisfied.
B00B7M7CMO|5|its cute
B00HXDVPFQ|1|I really wanted to love this cup- it looks great and I decided to give it a try despite only a few reviews. It leaks terribly, doesn't insulate (the outer layer just covers, doesn't keep things cold), and so the gazillion parts are more frustrating. Amazon refunded my money but let me keep the cup, and I may just stick it in the recycling bin because it's annoying to have a leaky sippy cup.
B004GIFIMW|5|Used these cute sugar bowls as prizes and favors during my sister's baby shower. Everyone is happy, including me. Kate Aspen is really your go to if you don;t have time making your own party favors. All their ideas and products are super nice and quirky!
B00F2MQ0K0|5|Well made potty ring fits well on my standard toilet seat.  I also have an elongated seat, and it fits even better on that.  I like the fact that there are side grips and a back rest.  When finished, simply hang it up on the side of the toilet.  I haven't quite figured out if the shield in the front will work for little boys.  That is to be determined.  Definitely recommend this item over similar ones.
B00005QXPE|4|Our baby is little for his age.  Although he is nearly 8 months, the regular high chair is still enormous--even with towels folded up under and behind him, he still swims in it.  This chair is just right for his small build though.  He is comfortable and well supported, so he is able to enjoy his meals without sliding around and getting all frustrated.  I think it will also be convenient for visiting at relatives' houses, although we haven't used it that way yet--it does fold up into a fairly convenient package.  We would highly recommend this chair for smaller babies.
B004AHMCKA|5|Baby loves it!!!
B006NTY1HU|5|The perfect size, the perfect height. It has joyful colors with the ability to see through it!
B00AB795DA|5|I was a skeptic for sure. I thought a necklace couldn't help with teething but I was totally wrong. It has helped with my sons fussiness. Now any time he gets fussy from teething we put it on him and it helps. We love our necklace.
B000U5FOT2|4|We have a large opening in between our kitchen and living room measuring 8 1/2 feet.  After extensive research and web browsing we finally settled on this gate.  It was one of the few that was large enough for the opening and judging by reviews was the sturdiest we would find.    It arrived today and my adventure began with my cordless drill going dead on the first screw.  Not a problem caused by the gate but aggravating enough to mention here.  As I struggled screwing them in by hand and waiting for the drill to charge I decided to take the gate itself out of its packaging and see what I was in for.  As soon as I pulled the first piece of plastic away I noticed that one of the plastic pieces that joins the \\"gate\\" with the rest of the barrier was broken off and laying there in about 4 pieces.    I had to eliminate several minutes of ranting and curse words there.  I typed them all out but then deleted them when my wife said Amazon probably frowns on that kind of thing.  But I digress....    After I calmed down I started inspecting the whole assembly to see if I could salvage what I had and avoid the whole return process and waiting for another gate to arrive.  It took some thought but I finally figured it out.  Fortunately for me I only needed a gate to span 8 1/2 feet and not the full 12 feet the gate can expand, which meant I had an extra 2 foot section that I did not need.  So I then proceeded to rob Peter to pay Paul so to speak and was able to assemble the gate with the 4 remaining sections and 1 gate.    Once I figured out what I had to do to make it work, assembling it was fairly straight forward and easy.  Outside of this one problem I am happy with the product so far.  It seems to be fairly sturdy and our 10 month old linebacker put his brute force on it a couple times and it is still standing tall.  It is not ugly, the light beige color is neutral and blends well with the rest of the house as well as a baby gate can.    I would recommend this to someone but I would also appreciate any partial refund or store credit Amazon would like to bestow upon me for my troubles..... Hint, hint, wink, wink, nudge, nudge....... OK, prolly not.
B00BWIPD42|4|I gave this a 4 star rating bc of the price. It's a little too pricey for my taste. Although after reading other reviews I decided to purchase it anyway. The quality and size is good. The padding is ok.. I placed it on top of a carpeted floor for my daughter to sleep and that seemed to do the trick! I went with the larger size bc I want it to work for my daughter for a few years. My husband who is 6ft 2in can fit (squished of course) with my 17 month old inside with the tent zipped shut! So it seems to be large enough to grow with her. I was concerned that it wouldn't fit inside my suitcase, but was happy to see it did! Although in the picture of the suitcase shown on the site- i'd just have to say that their suitcase must be a giant size! Mine is normal size and it took up 3/4 the length of it. I had to push it in to fit. I thought it might brake, but it seemed to be pretty sturdy! In one suitcase I was able to pack; 1 peapod plus travel bed, 5 days worth of 18month clothes, 5 days worth of diapers/wipes, burp clothes, 16 food pouches, 1 stuffed animal, 1 blanket, and 3 raincoats!! All in all I was happy to have it all fit, and not have to pay for an oversized item such as a pack-n-play! My daughter now likes to take naps in the tent, and we will be using it again on our next trip.
B00GXGODNA|3|Love these diapers but for some reason this particular diaper insert portion would never lay flat. It was always crinkled and I never could get it to lay flat. I tried pulling the fabric to make the insert portion lay flat when it was wet, but it never worked. I have 5 other diapers of this brand and they don't have this problem.
B000YDDF6O|5|My little one 7 months old.I bought this when he was 4 months old and he loves it ,just stares at it.when he gives hard time while feeding i just play this toy and he easily distracts and now he holds it.This is his favourite toy.the lights on the toy blinks in rhythm to music and thats what catches the attention of babies...
B00HR8UE54|4|it was for a babyshower, everyone loved it
B000N0SNHY|4|this is a great bottle brush and I love that the end cleans nipples (a HUGE lifesaver when you are bottle feeding breast milk). I have to replace this brush once every two months because the sponge does seem to break down/discolor over time. But for the price, I don't really mind.
B00008439C|5|Our 3 month old daughter has not slept a wink unless someone was holding her since birth!  I bought this today and she has slept in her cribe for an hour.  And she is still sleeping!!!!  I would pay a bazillion dollars for this thing!
B00GD0YFWU|5|Love this sippy. No liquid touches any plastic, just glass and silicone. The glass does make this a little heavy for the child to lift up, but my son is only 8 months old so I don't mind holding it for him. Maybe that will change haha The liquid comes out easily and as long as you make sure you screw it on correctly, no leaks. It even comes with a straw attachment for older children and the handles can be removed.
B00007DWBH|5|gotta have an extra
B003KN27C8|5|love it
B005DL5970|4|Smells good.
B004EPYQH0|5|I bought this as a gift for my daughter and gave it to her at her shower....She loves it, says it is the nicest infant car seat she has ever seen, and this is her 3rd child. It is a great quality item and very stylish.
B000XT30G4|5|Very sturdy well made gate. Very pleased with product.
B000ZEXKJE|1|Buyer beware. These are NOT the soft gumdrop pacifiers, which this seller used to sell. These are inferior &#34;Jollypops&#34; which are much stiffer. My baby hates them and immediately spits them out.
B005IFTD8W|5|Perfect for what the State requires for Daycare! And, it's really a great price! Best one I found anywhere and for the best price!
B00I5X3QQO|4|I absolutely love this tie and it was adorable for pictures.  However a con, I have a very chunky baby (85th percentile) and the neck hole was awfully large.  I wonder if this is in part because they don't want someone choking their baby by accident but it's good to know before buying.  Also, be very careful when washing it, I accidentally forgot to put it in a mesh washing bag and it became untied the night before his party.  Yeah, that sucked.  I'm decently crafty and I couldn't get it back perfectly but good enough.  Overall I would suggest it, especially with the little bloomers.
B00B5OBV4E|5|These are as advertised and they do the job they are intended to do. What more can be asked of a little sponge?
B00MI0ZJCO|5|My granddaughter loves it!
B00OZJ6MQI|4|Only stroller you will need from birth to 2+ years.  Forget getting a bulky stroller this one is awesome!<br /><br />Pros:<br />Light<br />Easy to collapse<br />Faces out and inward<br />Easy to assemble<br />Comfortable for my 4 month old<br />Large Canopy<br />Doesn't take up a lot of space in the trunk<br />Handles are tall enough for both my husband and I (no hunching over)<br /><br />Cons:<br />Can not fit a regular size diaper bag<br />A little tricky to unfold<br /><br />Buy it!  Great price for features!
B00CLXSKKQ|4|My son loved it! Easy to put together and with in 45 min and a little help from the kiddos...he was ready for bed
B00S1I04NQ|3|Too cheap simple not  recommend I was very disappointed when I saw this :-(
B00IYTTO2Y|5|These trays are the best I have seen. I make most of my baby food and I was using regular plastic trays, but it was always difficult to get the food out. These trays just pop right out and are so much easier. I recommend these to anyone who makes their own baby food.
B000U5FOT2|5|Sturdy and versatile.  This gate has been great for keeping my puppy out of trouble and keeping things safe from visiting dogs.  I like the door, when I used the gate as a pen for my dog.  It folds up compactly, now that my dog is a bit older and I don't need it all the time.
B004GWZM9M|3|pros:<br />Like the idea of being a scooter and stroller board.<br />Easy to push stroller without kicking it since it is set to the side.<br />I like that the handle can stay on when on the stroller so it is easy for my child to hold on.<br /><br />Cons:<br />CHEAP quality. SUPER flimsy! Especially for the money! Come on Mt. Buggy! You can do better then this!<br />Wobbly to ride<br />Cannot turn front wheels so it is impossible to steer when using as a scooter.<br /><br />I am still debating if I am going to keep this or not... I like the idea and you can't find a stroller board like this for my stroller, but it is so flimsy I am nervous it is going to be broken in no time.<br /><br />update:<br />I have had this for less then a week and the black handle grips are already broken and coming off. I am VERY disappointed.
B0009JOSNM|5|I was happy to receive this as a gift off my registry. My daughter is only 3 months old, so I tend to prefer using my stroller, but there are times when the bjorn is the only way to go. There are times when your baby won't want to be in the stroller, but you don't have the option of picking baby up. With the carrier, your baby gets the comfort of being held close to you and you still have your hands free. If you worry how a squirmy baby will handle it, I can tell you that my daughter is not a fan of having her movements limited, (swaddling didn't last long). But she is fine in the carrier... very calm. <br />If I had to find a down side it would be that my daughter is like a radiator and having her strapped to me can get sweat rolling down my back. So if you are going somewhere where it is important to not have a wet shirt, you may want to bring something to change into when you reach your destination.
B00014PLAY|2|Hi, We purchased this in November of '08 to keep our 2 year old daughter from climbing out of her crib.  I found it easy to assemble and it certainly did the job of keeping our daughter inside.  However, after a week of use the zipper was continuously stuck and hard to maneuver.  I returned the product and received another one at the end of January '09.  Here we are at the end of May '09, 4 months later, and the zipper is broken again!  I called to return this one too, but alas! the warranty is ONLY GOOD FOR 60 DAYS!  There are other reviews on here about the faulty zipper- please be forewarned!  This product needs an overhaul and their limited 60 day warranty should have been a red flag.
B001H0GGNM|5|My daughter LOVES her booster seat! Very easy to setup and use, and I love hot the cupholders don't poke out and take a lot of space! I reported this Amazon price drop on Cuckoo for Coupon Deals and got it, glad I did!
B00CUWCPJK|5|Love it
B002H37HMM|1|Did not get the Zoe purple dog from littlest pet shoppe like shown in pictures but got the panda. We needed it for a trip and my daughter chose to keep it.
B00G34TIDW|5|Great but! Would purchase again from this seller. The item arrived just as described. Excellent buy for the price and it was a good investment! I love this car seat!
B0000SWDH0|5|I have had this stroller for a year now.  It's very durable, folds together so it fits in any trunk without a problem.  It reclines almost completely flat, so I was able to put my baby in when she was just over a month old.  To answer ALOVINGMOM's question, NO the foot rests are not adjustable.  <br /> <br />The only thing I'm not crazy about is folding it and unfolding it. It's not that quick and easy, but it gets better with practice.  <br /> <br />I have recommended this to a few friends. I think this is the way to go if you have two kids and especially if you travel with them. IT's much easier to take this on a plane than those bulky front-back ones. I got rid of my Duoglider because of the size and weight.
B005G3QSF2|5|Works exactly as you would want it to, and works very well. I would strongly encourage anyone using the Kiinde system to pick up one of these -- after you do you'll feel silly about all the time you wasted trying to warm up milk in some ad-hoc way.
B007UK1CF0|5|Works like a champ for our new little guy!
B00G2G2W3Y|5|I keep one in my nursery, and one in the diaper bag! Size medium is large enough for 5 or 6 cloth diapers.  The bags contain all smells and liquids, and so far clean great in the wash!
B000YHA7O8|5|Love these!  Super easy to install!  Doesn't leave sticky recidue on my wood furniture!
B001C3MHEQ|2|I bought this a year ago.  I don't think it is hard to use but my parents and babysitter don't really get it.  I hate that it doesn't vent out all the steam/water so you have to dump it out each time you use it to avoid mold.  We also bought a $20 munchkin one and it not only uses up all the water each time, but also heats it up faster.  I am not crazy about this product but it does heat up bottles.
B0043C5XYY|5|These have been the best nursing pads for nipple coverage!  I used the thicker ones for the first five months of nursing because my breasts hadn't yet regulated and I leaked during letdowns if I wasn't nursing, but since then, I've mostly just needed a comfortable way to line my nursing bras and hide nipple show-through on t-shirts.  The ultra-thin Bamboobies are perfect!  They're so soft, adorable, and DON'T SHOW THROUGH AT ALL.  I previously tried both Medela and Avent nursing pads, and hated them because you could see the outline of the pad through my shirt.  The heart shape on the Bamboobies isn't just a cute gimmick, they really do form breast better.  Thanks, Bamboobies!
B001PLA36O|5|this pump is the best i was loan this pump at my wic office and its the best. i previously have tried medela harmoney and evenflow double electric but nothing compare to this hospital grade ameda breast pump. the sucktion is awsome my nipples dont even hurt. not heavy, easy to set up and use and the noise what noise it so quiet nothing compare to other pumps i have previously used. and most important im done pumping within  10-15 minutes real fast. 5 start for this pump more then great. i would buy this one, happy statisfied its a MUST HAVE pump.
B005SAZ5XE|5|I love this rug. It is lightweight and colorful. It is a great addition to any kids room. It is just as described.
B0038JDTW6|4|I can't get my son to drink from a bottle, so I really have no luck with sippy cups either.  Although I cannot get my son to drink from this, this is still a very nice sippy cup.  It is solid, dishwasher safe, and easy to hold.  He is 7 months old and can hold it just fine, he just refuses to drink from it.  He is exclusively breastfed and just prefers what he prefers.<br /><br />I can't knock the cup because it is well made.  I just wish my son would drink from it.
B002UN4G0U|5|My daughter loves her ergo baby carrier<br />Everywhere we go she want to take her baby<br />Thanks Amazon for such great products
B0036WSX2Q|2|Once in the car for a few weeks plastic got very hard, almost to cracking point.
B00313JBC6|5|I research car seats extensively. I have four kids and only want the safest stuff for them, not the most expensive, but the car seats that will protect them the most. This one was highly rated by Consumer reports, whom I trust, with their testing and the price is reasonable. In fact, it was the only one with an EXCELLENT rating for protection. That made it a no-brainer for me. It is very nice easthetically too and will look great in your car installed.
B008HPP672|3|The pillow is actually approximately 14.5&#34; x 19.5&#34;, which is a rather odd size and next to impossible to buy additional pillowcases for.
B000GB3FDW|5|this is the best diaper bag i have ever had.  makes a great gift, cleans easily.  love it
B002B55AC0|5|I love that you can fold this mat up to fit in a diaper bag. The design is great! Having a tray that catches food that falls really helps with cleanup. There's nothing worse than leaving a restaurant looking like a pack of hogs just finished eating. I really enjoy this mat.
B003KN27EG|4|I really like this cozy blanket. It is super easy to clean and I know it keeps my son extra warm. We live in the city so we are in the stroller daily.  My only objection is that the bottom part doesn't stay perfectly snug on the stroller and often needs to be pulled up and adjusted around the the stroller straps.
B004X0WBHS|5|my son loves it
B000067EH7|1|For my first child, I used a Safety 1st tub (which has its issues, too, but was for the most part pretty good).  We had to purchase a new one for our second child and this was the only brand available at the store where we did our baby shopping. <br /> <br />I found the sling to be difficult to adjust, and it didn't seem to allow our baby to be in the water while being bathed - he was sort of suspended above it. Once he became too big for the sling, I moved him to the tub itself and found the shape of it to be completely useless.  I don't understand how the manufacturer could expect so many different sizes of babies to fit in that shape - he pushed up on the end of the tub with his feet, and it was difficult to keep a good grip on him while bathing him because the tub did nothing to help hold him up.  After a few attempts at using the tub, I threw it out and went straight to the store to get the Safety 1st tub.  Now I remember why I like it so much.
B009TO9VJY|5|nice to have them in m y drawer.  It brings back memories
B00LGZQUHK|5|Love it
B004EBUX94|5|We liked the first one so much we bought a second one. This was cheaper than the other brand we had but our child seemed so much more comfortable in this one!
B003VNKLIY|5|Stands up well, fairly sturdy, really happy with the purchase
B005PK1G76|5|Works great with our UppaBaby Vista.
B0031ES8UG|5|This is really an adorable little lovey toy for a baby.  It's quite small, but that makes it perfect for tiny baby hands.  My little guy hasn't developed a special attachment to it yet, but he does love to hold it and try to chew on the bunny's face.  It's beautifully made with lots of cute details.  I love the pink blush to the cheeks and insides of the ears!  The outside, colored part of the blanket is super soft plush material, while the inside (and edges) are soft satin.  My baby loves to feel both sides.  I haven't washed it, so I can't say how well it will wash, but the bunny fur is such a great, soft texture I am a bit afraid machine washing might ruin it.
B0097C3UUE|3|it's ok
B002UXQSVU|5|I was looking for a bag for less and this bag has provided me with exceptional quality. When I first received it, I was like, Wow this is small, Im going to need a new one soon. My baby is four months now and I LOVE LOVE LOVE IT. It is very spacious, I am able to fit(on the inside)  3 outfits  five bottles or more,  twenty diapers  a wipe container  blanket  toys.  The side pockets are great for my cell phone and 3 ready to go bottles, and keys.  the back pocket for my wallet and paperwork I pick up on the go. I am beyond pleased with this bag and I am Glad I pick it.  It is very cute. I highly recomend this bag for all personnal that want a Great bag and on a budget. I love it.  And you will not need another bag, unless you just want to change it up once in a while. but I have two Diaper Bags and only used the other one once. I love this bag. ~YOU ARE IN GOOD HANDS WITH THIS QUALITY~
B001XR06RQ|5|I purchased five of these, for our dipe bags, one in the car, and for around the house. I have a jumbo pack of wipes to refill these. They work perfectly and are so much cheaper than buying special wipe cases.
B0038JE650|5|The drain stopper was a perfect solution to our dripping bathtub drain. Thanks!!
B00HG1WZMW|5|Nice item
B000JOOGK2|4|This works really well, although several of the locks I bought in the past that get high traffic the glue will not hold over time and I needed to screw it in to the cabinet. I would say 30% needed to be fastened with more then the glue pad.
B001LNNR2S|5|These are so incredibly cute!  I have removed and replaced them MANY times and they would re-stick over and over with no problem.  Love the variety of sizes.  The colors are beautiful!  Looks great on my daughter's purple walls.
B00AWJHCDW|5|I have been using these pouches daily and they work great! I fill them up with the Little Green Monster (recipe comes with the pouches) that I make in large batches and freeze them. I also fill them with Greek yogurt or apple sauce. They are portable and convenient and a great way to save money since you can use them over and over. It's also reassuring that you know exactly what ingredients are going into them. They are dishwasher safe, but I recommend hand washing them because dishwashers can cause the zipper/zip-lock to wear and not keep a tight seal. They clean very easily with a bottle brush. It is also helpful to know that store-bought pouch caps fit these perfectly in case you lose any. I should also add that I bought the 8-pack G.O. pattern after I bought these because the price seemed better and I needed more of them and I think these hold more and are worth the price.
B002SG7JSU|5|Good product for safety
B004EBUX9O|5|I have actually boughten three of these one for each car!! It is oversized but I love it because my grand-babies are very safe in this. Not one recall on this product! They give you a lot of choices of colors too!
B0000634QM|4|We wanted to be able to display all the stuffed animals we had given one another while we were dating in our bedroom. This hammock was perfect for that. It was also big enough to hold the stuff animals we got when our two boys were born. Highly recommended to anyone looking for something to last and large enough for many stuff animals.
B000JVXUPM|5|Very good for babys
B00028XJNA|3|These storage bags have tore, leaking milk everywhere. So heartbreaking when pumped milk is wasted.
B007MCQA9O|1|First the video in color was ok, but the night vision was not worth having. Second I bought it 10 months ago and it's been broken for the last 6. I thought it was a battery thing so I got a replacement, not cheap, and it still didn't work.<br />While it worked I liked it because I could carry it around with me during the day. At night I really only needed the sound so I wasn't too concerned with the night vision.<br />Not impressed moterola.
B00PF844JK|5|I trust Avent with their BPA free products. I love the handlebars on the side that help train baby to hold his or her bottle.
B000PRUAFI|5|It installed super easily in any of the doorways in our home. It is secure and easy to work, but my two year old still hasn't figured it out so that's a good thing! Very happy with the purchase and it looks good as well.
B00B52801S|5|One of my favorite cloth diaper brands. This color is very vibrant as well!
B0043D28B4|5|My toddlers at school love this book
B000056OVJ|5|This product was the best baby gift I received.  Having a baby born in November this saved me from every having to put a snowsuit or heavy coat on my baby.  People were always asking me where I got it so they could buy them.  I'm not sure why so many other reviewers are complaining that the hole is too high.  The product has extra room at the top and bottom so you can pull it up or down on the carrier so the hole will be just right for your baby.  And no, you cannot use this product with a canopy.  But since this covers your baby completely, I never felt the need for it.  Your baby's face does not actually stick up out of the hole so they are completely protected from the elements.  This is an awesome product and a must have for any winter babies!
B005IV7BGW|3|okay product but not for mommy who has screaming baby when hungry. Lot of work refilling it
B00BBKXHXA|5|The cotton is of a nice quality. It is a little \\"crisp\\", but will soften up with washings. As with all cotton, it is absorbent, which will be wonderful as the nights are getting warmer and more humid. The ties mean the coverage isn't perfect, but on the up-side, it's easy-on and easy-off.
B001WAJVZM|4|The one we have has a tendency to grow mold inside it, but it does offer great protection. Our toddler has slipped and bounced her head off of it several times without visible injury.
B00BGAMK60|5|Love them! Bought the cheaper knock offs first and regretted it. Definitely worth the couple extra dollars!
B003EGJT18|2|This is the most adorable, excellent little lunch sack- except for the mold that has appeared between the lamination and fabric. Similar reviews indicate this is a common problem for this item. BUMMER! I will hate throwing it out. I will also hate having to buy a new one...and needless to say, it will be a different brand.
B00HE66UO8|5|Beautiful crib very classy
B00GEF7CJW|4|the only negative reviews I saw was that, this product was hard to install. I was not hard to install if you read the instructions. I can see where someone would have a hard time if they did not look at the instructions. I was impressed with how sturdy the reclining mechanism is compared to the more expensive Graco and Chicco brands. This has thick reinforced plastic notches where the metal bar sits for each position. The graco, and Chicco brands have a very small piece of plastic holding their bars in place.<br /><br />Also, in regards to other's comments on this seat being hard to install, I would think that if this seat is hard to take in and out of a vehicle, that would be a good thing. In an accident you know that this seat will be secure. As well as the fact that with the stage two car seats and the conversion car seats are meant to stay put.
B008CCQPZC|5|This is what i ordered. I thought medium was going to be to small for me, so I ordered this ones. They are excellent but now I can see medium were just right for me. Unfortunately the best advice is to buy then once u are breastfeeding not before.
B0001IU5HY|1|We received this swing from my nephew after he outgrew it (originally purchased in 2005).  Yesterday we noticed a burning smell coming from it.  After disassembly, my husband discovered that there was burning at the switch in the off position.  After reading some reviews, we found that others experienced the same issue.  I am so glad that my son was not in this swing when this happened.  I called Fisher Price this morning regarding this and was offered a replacement of the entire motor housing (only parts that would be old would be the seat itself and the frame for the swing to stand on.  I just hope that the replacement doesn't have the same issue!
B005XRV32O|5|Bought this for my niece along with matching bedding. She loved it. The shade is really cute and well made. The price was extra awesome. Could not find anything like it in the stores. Thanks Amazon! Your a life saver!
B00MJW4PFS|5|Just the right size for two bottles.
B00O3JG1GQ|5|Great product! We were having trouble finding something that was easy to use and compact for changing our daughter's diapers on the go. We love using it so much we actually hardly use her changing table, and just opt to throw this on the bed/floor. Any messes that she makes are easy to clean off and the quality/build from what we can tell is superb.
B006DXXPK0|1|Like other reviews, this crib arrived with cracked slats even though the packaging was not compromised.  I'm very disappointed in this product.
B00CPC2A2M|5|Dr Brown's bottles are all I used with my son and he's never had colic ... Highly recommended!
B00B3NMTNE|5|This item is super cute and makes an excellent Easter gift basket item!  Any kid would look great it this!
B000BKTEYC|4|Great product!  Fairly easy to assemble and seems to be a good quality for the price.  Baby loves it!  I was disappointed that battery for musical toy cannot be replaced though.
B00U4L0D66|5|Love this cover. Not only does it allow for privacy when nursing in public it can also be used as a car seat cover and blanket. Multi purpose is a must with a baby so only having to grab one item for many uses is helpful when trying to get out the door.  Love that I can also look at my baby while nursing and interact with her. All in all a great product and must have for any mom. Fast shipping as well
B003LQSNTA|5|The binky stays put on this binky bear and my daughter loves it.  It makes it so much easier to find the pacifire since it is attached to the bear! And its cute :)
B00188XW26|5|Ok
B00ESL3TSW|5|my baby loves to chew on this. I attached it with a ribbon and she loves to take it everywhere with her
B002RIII48|1|If you  mix it loose enough to suck through the nipple then it leaks out the bottom of the container because there is not a good seal on the feeders.  The spoon attachment is really hard unlike other infant spoons. We are very disappointed in our purchase.
B00E4BFXOY|3|Its OK.. Each song is about 15 seconds long and just keeps cycling through.. Wish the songs were longer and could lock onto one. Kinda cheep...
B004N2IEVS|5|I love how soft this is, Little Giraffe has great products & I will definitely order more in the future.
B00H4RF6X8|5|I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS!!!!!! AND WORTH THE $$$
B000S9RF4M|5|I love this.  I am not fond of the little fan with pull cord, it seems loud, and dangerous if baby gets her finger in the fan, but it is plastic and doesn't turn too fast, but it is loud and fast enough to hurt if a finger is in the way.  It is great otherwise, mounts well and is very cute.
B00II6QO8A|5|These nets were perfect for holding all my son's stuffed animals. They are great quality and easy to hang up.
B00ECKPV5S|5|Ultra-soft and very cute! The changing pad cover fits our Summer Infant changing pad perfectly. It is easy to get on and off the pad for cleaning. The cover has a buttery smooth velvet type cover, which will feel oh-so-good on babies skin.<br />The animal design is actually cuter that it looks online. The animals are big and eye-catching.
B005O8ILTU|5|It was delivered quickly and packaged well.  Wonderful quality.  The only problem is that this great-grandma has many great-grand children and I was hoping the frame would be just a little smaller so that other pictures wouldn't have to compete with this one.
B00D7C7FWE|5|Very pretty
B001QGMDHA|5|My two year old love this!
B009ZU3XYQ|5|Best swaddle blankets!! They are really big and breathable. Great for babies who can easily escape a swaddle. They also work wonderfully as nursing covers!
B00IIUM6QU|5|Cute little favor for baby shower and reasonable price
B004YN9RL2|5|This is the ultimate diaper bag for guys! It has everything you could need! I have yet to run out of storage.
B00457X7E0|4|I really only ordered this for the smaller sized boppy for my newborn. The item is as described, the boppy is the perfect size for babies under 3-4 months and the mat washes up nicely in the washer.
B009S4NNZI|5|Softest crib sheet I bought, and I bought just about every brand available for our first baby.  This one is soft and durable, and looks adorable.  I love the Aden & Anais brand of baby items and this one does not disappoint!  Also, it's easy on baby's soft skin and he has no skin issues when sleeping on it.
B002GD4H6M|5|Super practical, easy to use, clean and you can take it anywhere if needed to have your baby sitted at the table. Love it!
B0083QAPJ4|5|I received this book I love it.. i filled in what I could for now and can't wait till the baby is born to fill out more.. great gift :)
B002OOWADK|5|this by all means as been the best purchase yet for our grandchild........Keeps him happy and active at this 6 month point.....
B000ODV9PI|3|Unlike a lot of other reviews, our spots almost completely disappear when exposed to any type of warmth, even little hands. (I thought that was so cool!)<br /><br />I saw these at Bed, Bath, & Beyond for $10 just before Christmas and ended up going back a few days later and getting them. My son loves dogs and he loves baths, so I thought they'd be great. My son seems to really like them but he never plays with them in the tub. He chews on the legs and the head. He throws them. He lines them up along the table and then flings them all off.<br /><br />So while they aren't played with as intended, he still likes them. They have held up really well and seem pretty durable for a toy (I actually drove over one of them and it popped back to normal like nothing ever happened.)
B00ISS2JV4|5|Wonderful! Thank you so much!
B000K4YSVI|4|I purchased this because I wanted a dedicated place to store my storage bags. For those who use Medela bags, they fit in this as well.
B009153840|4|I love them! Thought they would be thicker but they are adorable and NOT cheap feeling. And my man loves the designs! Far better than boring store bought receiving blankets.
B00G3XR8OE|5|I highly recommend this stroller to any twin parent.  We started out with a Maclaren double, but it got way too hard to push once my twins each hit 15 lbs.  This stroller is easy to fold (SO much easier than the Maclaren!), easy to push, and fits easily in the back of my Honda Civic.  We use a BOB Dualie for around the neighborhood, jogs, and trips to the park, but this stroller stays in my trunk for errands and traveling.  If you're not terribly active, this would be a great primary stroller.  My only complaint is that it doesn't come with a built-in parent tray.
B00508MVAO|4|Good
B000I2Q0F4|5|4 month old loves this toy, very colorful and lots of fun. If your looking for a great toy this is it
B002870J8G|5|I was overwhelmed with the amount of clothes I received for my newborn daughter.  This helped me sort a lot.  The brown isn't quite as dark as it looks in the photo and in hindsight I should have purchase pink or cream.  It doesn't bother me though so I didn't return it.
B001C3I1AA|5|Love it!
B004LWZZ76|5|Bought these bath toys for our granddaughter. She loves playing with them but so does our four year grandson!!  Happiness all the way around!
B000U5LXU6|4|We bought this for when my son started crawling a year later and it is still in good condition.  There was a couple of dents in the wood when we got it, but nothing that worried us.  I mean we were buying it for a child's play area so a couple of dents isn't anything.  It has been about a year and it has held up well.  We did buy the 2 panel extension set, after this arrived because in the hexagon shape it just didn't seem like enough room for our son.  With the extra panels there is plenty of room.  Now that my son is 17 months though we may have to mount it to the wall, he has no problem pushing it around our floor.
B003D3NVUW|5|I purchased these not for baby but for Mom. I use these to soaplessly cleanse my face in the shower. One side is extremely soft and gentle, the other side having just enough &#34;rough&#34; to slough off any dry skin present, and to thoroughly remove my makeup. I wash them with my whites, and although bleached often they've stayed just as colorful as when I bought them. love them! They were far cheaper than anything I could have purchased being marketed for what I use them for, and I wouldn't change a thing about them. They're perfect!
B000HZEQSU|3|I had high expectations for this product, but it did not work for me. After a cesarean section, I found this product to push very hard on my abdomen, aggravating incision pain.  I had to go back to the boppy which was softer.  I liked the large patform for the baby to rest on and she felt secure on there.  I also liked the little pocket in the lining to hold a cell phone/binkie or chapstick.  The back support was heavenly.
B001GQ2SA2|4|My 8 month old loves this mobile, but I can't put the projection on because it gets him too overstimulated!  He gets all riled up and can't fall asleep.  But the music and animals are very cute.
B004GY8A58|5|Even though my baby was extremely disinterested in these pacifiers you can see that they are good quality and quite cute for some reason. I really like the colours too!
B00451ACTO|5|I have no complaints. We have used for over 6 months and everything is fine. So grateful that there is nice looking and durable furniture at a decent price. Also glad I didn't spend $400 on a crib at the Baby's R Us. I ended up with an entire collection for my daughter's room for less than $700 - I purchased the South Shore crib, changing table and drawer chest and they are all great quality and had no issues putting together. Very good decision.
B004AHKUHW|5|We bought it 8 month ago and it is still working perfectly ,this is perfect when we are on the terasse and baby in his bedroom
B003I5X2YU|1|Leaks! and easy to see your wearing them if your not wearing very loose fitting tops warning don't wear grey with this or any color that darkens when wet! go with Lansinoh disposable nursing pads they are thin and don't leak
B001F8KJT8|5|One can read about the Diego reels I reviewed as they pertained to this product.  Our granddaughter loves this who set up. She laughs so much when she uses her View Master. Will have to purchase several others as they are no longer making this product.
B007ZBJ9GS|5|I had bought these for my older son and they were no longer available when I went to purchase for my younger son in the grocery store.  I love these because they are closer to a &#34;sippy&#34; cup but have a softer spout.  Great for transitioning off of the bottle.
B000HDJVGY|5|These are going to be so cute for the party I placed a mustache on each one for the kiddos!
B0089T0QHG|4|This is my second elephant. The first one got really nasty. My two year-old daughter loves this toy. She sticks her fingers into the ribbons, and falls asleep. Love it!  Edit: My daughter is almost 4 and still carries her Ellie around everywhere! Sadly, I bought a replacement and I have had to sew it up 4 times. The tags are ripping off. I am going to need to either get a replacement or buy a new one.
B00EVQ6T4A|5|Tanks
B0050P2P3A|5|A great product, functional, practical and beautiful. designed for use by children and for your convenience. It is very practical front pocket to put his lunch, fruit and drinks. A very good product for children and practical, convenient and practical, the best in kids backpacks
B003IUFV08|5|This product was just what I was looking for!  It is so helpful to organize baby clothes (by day of the week, size, etc.).  I would highly recommend this product!
B00KBGTRAC|4|It is great.  Wish there was a better way to clean the bottom.
B00AIVNBN4|4|Nice a comfy she enjoyed it but out grew it pretty fast.
B00629GWWS|4|good infant wrap
B002BSGWU6|5|de exelente calidad ya mi beba tiene 7 meses y estan como nuevas, hermosas y de muy buena utilidad en toda ocacion.
B00KD82A1G|1|My shipment arrived damaged.
B00K75MW40|5|A grest gift!
B000PKVCEI|1|I recently purchased this item on Amazon.com in boy colors, after doing so I went to Target and looked through the pacifiers and found this exact set for HALF the price. I have already opened these or they would be going RIGHT back. Please also take note, that although it says for 0-24months, the nipple is very large. This may be suitable for a 12month or older baby.
B002LSI0BA|2|I ordered this very early as a Christmas present for my 14 month old Granddaugher.  It would not crawl and everyone was very dissappointed and I really wanted to return it but didn't have the heart to take it from her and she does not live nearby. I really think I should receive a refund from Amazon on this gift. I really am very sad that it didn't work.<br /><br />C. Kump
B008ESOI9E|5|We use this all the time. It's nice because it's more versatile than the other ones we have that have a plastic toothed fastener at one end and snaps at the other. Where we can't use those this one saves the day. It's not always for a sippy cup either. Sometimes it's to make sure we don't lose my daughters stuffed animal. And it's Much more hygienic for the toy or sippy cup to swing outside the stroller than to fall on the floor or ground all the time!
B00920Y2LM|4|The wall vinyl sticker was a bit small but i can put it some where else in the house instead of the living room... The reason I gave the sticker a 4 start is the seller rolled it up tight and now the sticker are bent :(
B002NUWQUM|5|This bustier has changed my experience with pumping.  I have been exclusively pumping for my daughter for 2.5 months now so am using the pump at least six times a day.  I am now able to make the time spent pumping productive (or at least more enjoyable).  My hands are totally free so I can read, write, type, etc.  In fact, I am pumping as I type this review!    I am wearing a 36B or C nursing bra and I bought the bustier in medium and it fits well. Well worth the investment.
B00IF9NI1Q|5|I would recommend this Mickey balloon it's really cute!
B00A65YO7O|5|Holds up well to washing and lots of use.
B004A15YSI|3|The crib is sturdy and seems to be made well. The finish was not smooth on the crib.The wooden slats were rough in many places. There were several small dents in the top rail, probably damaged in shipping.I sanded the rough spots myself. I am keeping the crib.It is too much trouble to take apart and return. Main concern was safety.
B000WHM1Q2|5|I love angel dear blankies as they as so soft even after washing. The brown puppy blankie is adorable! I also have the blue monkey, which is also super soft but just not as cute. These are perfect for baby to cuddle with and make perfect gifts.
B004B6Y0LE|5|We keep this in the diaper bag for emergency nursing sessions.  It changes any blanket into a nursing cover.  It works particularly well with receiving blankets. Although, I have used a T-Shirt or a sweatshirt in a pinch.  I do have a regular [[ASIN:B003F6Z3TO Udder Covers Nursing Covers - Carson]] that I rely on extensively.  But this is good for emergencies - like when my nursing cover is dirty and needs to be washed.  Or, when we forgot to put it back in the diaper cover.  This is worth the price.
B0007D698W|4|Very useful on a sunny day.
B00AA6LQKM|4|I like this product. I wish it was made a little better. We broke our first one.
B00N35R4EY|5|love this wallet, matches my cruise bag
B0010754P8|2|While it is one of the least expensive bounce/swing items - there's a reason.  The \\"swinging\\" part is done by YOU - not even with a wind up crank like the old days. It does say \\"manual side to side motion\\" in the product description - must have missed that.  It is not particularly sturdy - it does seem safe though.  Our baby seems to tilt one way or the the other just laying in it if she happens to move just  a bit.  The music very low on the highest setting. The only sell is that it is one of the few truly \\"hammock\\" style set ups out there - I think that's better for a baby's back than a seated swing, etc.  Not really worth the $ though.
B001OC5UMQ|5|Bought this gate about a month ago and it has been perfect.  Right out of the box the instructions are easy to follow and took about 10 minutes to get it put up.  What I really liked about it were the rubber wall grippers so no holes had to be drilled, but wall mounts were included if you so desired.  Overall glad I bought this product as it was fairly cheap and my fiance and I use it every day.
B00J36ZXOU|1|I like the product but I'm giving it 1 star because the one I was sent was used. It had fingerprints all over it. The tray table had two suction cup marks. One of the &#34;legs&#34; has a chocolate like stain... That I'm scared to know what it really is. But, thank God the fabric seemed untouched.
B0040GJ0VU|5|It works perfectly to keep my son off of areas that are hard to clean.
B005MQR794|5|We love this seat, both forward-facing for our preschooler and rear-facing for our toddler.  Both girls find it way more comfortable than the seat we have in our other vehicle.  It's also way easier to install than the other brands that I have experience with.
B001B5H5Q0|5|I bought 2, 1 for top to protect her mouth and 1 for bottom to protect her head because she insists on crawling under the crib. Love it!
B00LP25ZD4|5|Love these hangers!  Just the right size for baby's clothes and streamlined so you can fit more into a smaller closet.  Highly recommend.
B009YKA3Y0|3|The pillow had a very off putting smell. It says that you can't machine wash it on the tag but I did anyways and it was fine. THe pillow flattens quickly so there really isn't much fluff/support to it but my daughter (2yrs old) seems to enjoy the fact that she has a pillow. Also, I believe you dont want a pillow that is very fluffy for them b/c it may injure their neck. Personally, I would not like the pillow for myself but again...my daughter seems to enjoy it.
B00C3CXB5E|5|We absolutely love these bottles. They are so cute - all the other moms ask where I get my bottles. Plus feeding my baby out of stainless steel is so much better than feeding him out of a plastic bottle. I love that it helps protect the essential nutrients in my breast milk. Another awesome thing is how cold or warm the bottle stays. It's so great. We're still using it as a bottle right now since my kiddo is still only 6 months old but I am really excited to also be able to use it as a sippy cup when the time comes.
B003H4QFQE|4|This has been such a fabulous pram for carting two kids around in. I always get comments from people saying what an awesome pram, where did you get it?  Have been using it for almost two years, on an almost daily basis. The design is great. The green does show up a bit of dirt, but I'm not too worried about that. Removable hood is great, I often leave it off if I know I'm just going to be inside at a shopping centre. Good size basket underneath, great drink holders on parent console. Only negative would be steering. Work up a few arm muscles pushing it around!
B000FSJUO4|4|I received this just before my son was born.  I really enjoy it.  I have a photo of me holding him as a newborn on one side and his hand and foot print on the other side (will fit both with a newborn).  It has been the perfect spot to store keepsakes.....his first newborn hat, his coming home outfit, the candle from his baptism, etc.  My only complaint was that I found the mold a little tricky to work with at first.  Definitely need two people - one to hold the baby and one to hold the mold.
B00FX5E50I|3|They are OK foods does slip out sometimes so I had to carry them in a zip block bag for safety that it could spill in the diaper bag.
B00BIFXL7K|1|Horrible disappointment. These things are tiny. The entire set of stickers would fit on one cupboard door, they rip when you peel them and quite frankly, aren't even worth my time to return them. SMH.....
B00AHVR7YE|5|good .
B0064CTIC4|5|Not only is this thing handy (blue too cold, green good to go, red too hot), but it's my baby's favorite bath toy!
B001VEJ2GC|5|We have a boy, so changing accidents are common. I'd recommend getting 3. Very soft and fits the changing pad well.
B0034L00UC|1|I like that this product is organic and how quickly UppaBaby shipped my spare sheet to me....but when I washed the one that came with the bassinet according to the care directions, it shrunk significantly. I emailed UppaBaby and their customer care person quickly sent me a replacement free of charge and let me know that it should be washed in cold water anne air dried flat after stretching it out as much as possible. Fine....so now I've just had to wash both covers again, and I followed those directions.....and both have shrunk again, beyond use. From other reviews it looks like other people have had this issue as well...it's not what I expect from UppaBaby - I want something that's easy to use and launder.
B005I54OKY|5|You WILL need extras! Great for traveling with milk so it doesn't spill
B000LH62OK|5|We were vacationing out of town and staying at a relatives house. They had limited space and we needed a safe place for our 1 year old to sleep. The pod was perfect! It's light and compact for travelling purposes and our 1 year old was unable to get out of it and slept in it without a fuss. I would highly recommend it to anyone. And... now that we're back home my 4 year old likes to sleep in it instead of his bed. It's like camping out in his own room :)  Great quality product!
B0000936M4|5|I have a three week old who is primarily breast feeding, I have started to give her one bottle with breast milk a day since she was five days old, for ease/convinience.  I first started using the Avent bottles, with this product, my baby would frequently spit up, and more milk would end up ON her than IN her.  As well she had problems latching onto the breast with her next feeding.  I then tried the Dr. Brown's wide neck bottles, which are excellent, she has no problems using these bottles, no spiting up/overspill etc....  and most importantly no problems latching onto the breast, I have been able to give her both the bottle and breast in one feeding without any problems.  Cleaning has a few extra steps, but it is definitely worth it!
B009S59T00|2|was to small or my child  need to put measurements of chair  other than (kids)  picture makes it look bigger than it is. I will be sending it back.
B00E3RKC72|4|To those saying it doesn't sit evenly - you don't have it pushed down all the way. I made the same mistake. However the sit clicks up higher to allow easy slip off of the cover.<br /><br />Overall I really love this swing. Comfortably padded, and sturdy base my now four month old loves it. ALthough she only will stay in it for about 20 minutes at a time. That's just her personality. The music is nice, the speaker is wonderful with volume control, and it even features water and nature noises. The swing automatically turns off after so long, as does the music. Another nice feature.<br /><br />I love the fact that you can make this either plug in or battery operated. We typically dont move ours, but when we had to we didn't have to worry about an outlet.<br /><br />My biggest and probably only complaint is the harness. I don't feel like it adequately extends. After struggling with it for sometime, we gave up on using the top two straps. Even with just using the bottom straps our kiddo is still perfectly secure in there.<br /><br />I do say this overall is a great buy for the money.
B00KCNIOJ4|5|These are great for older babies and good for teething. My son loves them!
B00ECHYTBI|5|Great product. Highly recommended!  I've broken down points to make it easy.<br /><br />Picture Quality:  great. I can visualize rise and fall of chest/breathing so that's really the best you can get. Night vision is as good as any. I don't use the zoom much, it does decrease quality of picture but again I find I don't need this function.<br /><br />SOUND:  So with the volume at lowest I can hear the noise maker and any movement my son makes (he is 2), but if you place the unit flat on its back it pretty much silences this but I could still hear if he cried/talked. I don't find this a problem. I'd rather it be sensitive to sound than miss a cry.<br /><br />RANGE:  awesome!  I can be at the complete opposite end of my property in the backyard and have full bars.  If my cell phone is too close to the parent unit sometimes it interferes but if I place it 6&#34; away it's fine.<br /><br />TEMPERATURE:  this is an ideal function. We had this function on a previous AngelCare audio monitor and we swear by it. I believe it has helped us keep our son's room at a comfortable Temp for sleeping and that way he doesn't wake up cold.<br /><br />OVERALL QUALITY:  great. I've dropped the parent unit twice on hardwood floor and it has survived. I'm sure this unit could break though so I'm careful. Also the mounting on the child unit is SUPER EASY!<br /><br />FYI: we previously used a Foscam that used wifi and the range was terrible and we also had some pervert hack into that system (SUPER CREEPY) so I highly recommend this closed system.  Also it makes much easier to bring along for traveling!<br /><br />Hope this helps.
B001OC5UMQ|5|We use this for the dogs. It is great. Unlike the other ones their claws cant scratch at it, And it opens up great.
B0084DS9EE|5|So cute and very soft and huggable.  Seems to be made well but hasn't been through the toddler crash course yet.
B001OC5UNA|5|Perfect to keep my daughter's dog in her room. He can't climb it or jump over it. Very easy to install and use with one hand so I can imagine it working well with a baby ot toddler in your arms.
B00AJSIVWW|5|My 6 year old so loves this seat. He says it's comfy and loves the colors. It fits him well and he can get in and out of it easily.
B004QXZEKI|5|I have the Baby Jogger City Select Double Stroller.  After reading horrible reviews on the baby jogger bag, I did some research and came across this travel bag.  The City Select fits perfectly in this bag!  I was able to fit the stroller without removing the wheels, the second seat and the car seat attachment with plenty of room to spare!  The material is very durable and with definitely withstand air travel and protect my investment.
B0006FHFYS|5|<br />This swing is wonderful!  My daughter just LOVES it!  When she is not in it, she is often looking at it and babbling!  I recommend it to everyone!!  She loves the bright colors of the fish and the globe with the alternating colored lights is wonderful for soothing her at night when we have the lights low and she can still see it! <br /> <br />I did have a problem with it when I first bought it.  We were borrowing a regular Graco swing from a friend at the time.  Our daughter was not thrilled with it, but it did soothe her, so I was somewhat reluctant to spend the money on a cradle swing.  When we got it home it didn't work at all. I was so disappointed and frustrated! Even with 2 new sets of batteries.  So, I called Fisher Price.  They sent me a complete new one The Next Day!!(except legs & seat) No Questions asked except the problem, purchase date & place of purchase!  I thought it was going to be a hassle, then they told me I did not have to return or ship back the original!  Talk about Service!! <br /> <br />The only con: the size. However, it does take up about the same amount of space as the Graco swing! <br /> <br />One suggestion, buy 2 sets of rechargable D batteries, one in the swing ond one set on stand buy!  We change ours about every 5 days, and it is worth it! <br />
B000U5FOT2|5|Gate exceeded my expectations.  Configuration took more time than anticipated.  Best quality baby gate I've found & worth every penny.
B00GXGPAH8|4|I like how it's so light and so easily thrown into the wash. The pattern is super cute too!
B00KZBZKJK|5|This is amazing. I bought it to slowly wean my little one off swaddling, as he is looking like he will be rolling over soon. It is a bit loser than a swaddle, as it is stretchy. This means my guy can move his arms some, but he will not swaddle awake. He also cannot get his arms to his face. This is great, as he wakes himself up. I plan on using this for a few more weeks (or until he does roll), and then moving over to a zippy.
B00KDKKD1I|4|The pillow is great and perfect for preschool/daycare settings! Also, the communication from the creator is very heart-warming and personal. It makes you feel really happy that you are supporting a family-run business!
B003HS5JQM|4|Love the contrast of the item and the rattle/crinkle features. Only reason the product didn't get 5 stars is the lack of a hook for hanging and the loop on top is pretty small (ok if you have small hooks/links).
B00D4LFC3W|5|Great quality. Holds up great to washing too. I just toss it in with the cloth diapers to wash then hang dry. Love this product.
B002ZB81O4|1|When i first opened the package I was very pleased with the sheet's thickness and softness. I prewashed the sheet before putting it on my daughter's mattress and the sheet completely tore away from the elastic band. I am VERY DISAPPOINTED in the quality of the sheet's sewing. I will be returning it.
B004BDNJRI|5|Bought these to casually potty train our two year old.  He is tiny and barely 22lbs.  Other pants were huge on him. The smalls fit him perfectly.  They are super soft, wash and wear well, and are absorbent enough to hold small accidents but still feel wet.  He loves the designs and wearing them.  I wish they weren't so expensive but we just washed and wore as needed.
B00AGMBOXY|5|I was needing a spoon that would travel without disappearing into the bottom of the diaper bag and getting overed in crumbs and sand. The reason I bought it with a case was to be able to use it and take it home to wash when the option to clean it wasn't present, without getting baby food all over the diaper bag.  My biggest concern was the shape of the spoon. There is a deep part on the spoon and I worried about food getting stuck. The first time I used it I fell in love! It was easy and my 6month old took it very well. I wish I had this for my older two.
B002FPYMD4|3|I'm going to go ahead and second the recommendations of the previous reviewer to research extended rear facing and the Kyle David Miller Foundation. We got this seat as a secondary car seat to be used in the grandparents cars. Our primary is a Britax Boulevard.     I have installed this seat probably 8 separate times now, in two different Ford Focuses and one Honda Ridgeline. My son is almost 23 pounds and almost 32 inches at 15 months old. We are continuing to rear face because it is five times safer than forward facing at this point. Now on to the car seat!     I installed it first in the Honda Ridgeline, and it took me about a half an hour to get a good install. To correct the previous reviewer, it doesn't have to have less than one inch of movement at the head of the car seat, but at the belt path. That means you should NOT be able to move it more than one inch in any direction where the seat belt or the LATCH belt is connected. I have to stick a knee into the seat and put a lot of weight into it and simultaneously pull the LATCH strap to get less than an inch of movement, but it's a small price to pay for safety.     I also have the same problem with the difficulty in tightening the shoulder harness, and have heard that complaint from many other people with the My Ride. I finally got it tight enough, but have no idea how I did it and am afraid to loosen it at all or I won't get it back.     I had the same issue with the cover as well where it pops off of the cup holders and also the top. I called Graco, and they sent me a replacement cover right away. I got it within three days. I haven't had a chance to put it on yet, but we haven't used the seat in awhile either.  All in all, it is a good seat for the money. If you have a tight budget and are looking for a high weight limit rear facing seat, this is a good one.     I personally like the deepness of the seat, he actually has more leg room in this than he does in his Britax Boulevard.     Again, after installing a seat, find a certified car seat technician in your area to go over your install, they can help you learn how to do it correctly. You can find one in your area by going to this website: [...]       Remember, the American Academy of Pediatrics have recently changed their recommendations regarding car seats, and now recommend rear facing until at least age 2 and 30 pounds, NOT age 1 and 20 pounds.
B000KD1O34|4|Good and inexpensive natural blanket for a child. It's not synthetic as the other review said. The label on mine says \\"100% alpaca wool\\". I wish it was a little thicker and wider, though. Now when my child is older, I have to order queen size and fold it in half. That's what I had to do in the first place, but didn't want to pay $90 for the big blanket.
B009EDSWJA|5|good
B00NLOVH68|5|LOVE these spoons!
B00913DY3W|5|Love it so much!It's really a cute thing in hand, and the price's reasonable! Also it's really safe for child to bite it when teeth grow.
B002MGGZDG|5|The new parents loved the gift, they added as part of the new baby's room decor.  They were very appreciative!!!!!LOVED IT!
B001C51TIE|5|This is a great product.  Very durable and good quality.  It is been a life saver.
B007LXMPLG|5|Adorable mobile -goes great with the rest of the Animal Parade collection.
B000L9JNK8|5|My daughter got this last Easter and LOVES it!  She has to have it to fall asleep.  We recently bought a backup bunny because she is so attached to this one.  I also just purchased one for my nephew.    The bunny is beautiful and high quality.  My daughter lost hers while we were jogging. It took us 2 weeks to find it.  After several rainstorms and living outside for 2 weeks, we washed the bunny and it was fine.  Although the tag said surface wash, we wash it in the washing machine often and it holds up great!      Bring home this bunny....you won't regret it!
B00BPEKKQ4|4|This is really cute and functional.  My two year old loves Minnie so this was a big hit. It's not really the best quality but I wasn't expecting that.  The biggest issue I have is that since its just a plate that snaps on, the light is very bright. The bulb is basically completely exposed. I would have preferred a fully covered bulb.  But this will do for now!
B00R4PXGQ4|5|Bought this bag as a transition from a large baby bag to a bag for my toddler and it is awesome and has held up well so far!
B002JH7NXO|3|It seems like after using a few times, it no longer kept the water out of my sons eyes. I gave it 3 stars because at first, it worked like a charm. I'm not sure if I did something wrong or if the product just doesn't last that long.
