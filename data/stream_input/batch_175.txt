B005CO9FDW|5|It's a vacuum pump and it works. Had no problem pulling the AC on my car down to 28 within three minutes. Let it run for 45 minutes to evacuate the system after changing the pump and condenser, then recharged it. My only gripe is that it includes the adapter for your AC manifold set, but that is not stated in the product description, so I wasted a few bucks on that.
B001EMAOFY|5|Had my mechanic install the exhaust but according to him it fit perfectly. Worst part of the job was removing the original exhaust. It sounds great on my SS. The only problem is now I can't sneak up on the wife when I come home from work. I guess that's a small price to pay for wanting my truck to sound cool. ;)
B004FFHJ14|5|I was hesitant to purchase since so many reviews said it was so large and hard to handle. I have not found that to be the case. It will bend and fold and I have never once had to get out of my Prius to install or remove it. It is a good quality item that I have never regretted purchasing.
B00B2YE4B4|1|Lights are bright. BUT! i was installing interior under glows in my truck and happened to look up and the lights and they were smoking. They would stay on even if my truck was turned off. NOT WORTH THE MONEY!
B004VR06UW|4|Nice step surface and great eye appeal
B000C427KU|5|Not much to say, a quality K&N filter for a decent price delivered to my door in a very reasonable time frame.
B00C8YXH9C|3|A little more thought in the design of this would have made it much better. Each time you hit the button - it changes to the next more... light, flash, etc. That's fine. Click 10 times - 10 different modes. That is very good. It is &#34;supposed&#34; to shut off on click 11. The set I received does not. In fact - it doesn't shut off no matter what you do/how many times you cycle through the modes. The only way to turn it off is to pull the battery. I put the little tab back in that comes when they ship it, to keep the battery from working during shipment. The trouble with that is - in order to access the battery - you have to pull 2 screws - then breach the seal (this they did very well) by lifting the top off. Read the instructions on how to do this (or another review explained it as well) and it's really no problem. Except now - in what would likely be an emergency situation - I will have to get the screwdriver out - remove two screws - pull it apart - remove the tab - reassemble - then use it. Not exactly what you have in mind when you buy items that you will need during an emergency. I bought the three light set - so it'll have to happen 3 times. I can't say they are not good - as they did a good job designing the seal and put thought into making it multi-functional (different modes for the lights) so thumbs up in that regard. If it would turn off when you cycle through the modes - I would have given it 4 stars... but as I have to disassemble it to get it to work now - it kind of defeats the purpose... so 3 is all I could do on this.
B00T7DR7FW|4|A wiring diagram would be very beneficial. I would bet 99% of the &#34;this switch burned out first try&#34; etc reviews are from the user wiring it improperly.
B00CZBQCR2|5|nice product
B000CIMDI2|4|I love the sound and the performance gains, but it didn't match up to the factory catalytic converter as expected. Had to buy a new cat, and subsequently a small section of 304 tubing to make up the difference in length. Small potatoes, but I expected it to be bolt-on as described.
B006X6OJ6Q|5|This grill fit perfect and made my truck look great
B00XB27K0W|5|love it
B002N5W8Q4|5|I'm not one to write reviews but I felt I needed to on this product. We live in a RV full time and needed to keep the temperature down in our fridge. I came across this fan while searching the internet. The reviews on it we both positive and negative. We have had fantastic results from the fan so far. Yes it's cheap Chinese but everything i made there. I did see some comments that the batteries didn't last more then 3 days. My batteries were brand new so my fan is still going just about a month now. The circulating air from this fan has helped keep the cold air moving and the temp down. I hope this will help someone who is looking at this product. So far we are very happy.
B009KN07N8|5|I like how my first aid supplies are in a nice leather looking zip-pouch. The Nissan logo makes this look fancy. It definitely comes in hand with me because I'm accident prone.
B001C6Q8CK|5|Just as good as the factory original.
B000E2CVI8|5|This filter fits my 2003 Honda Black Bird... reccommended
B00XR482NS|4|Working  well
B00MBWEOIO|5|fit was great very fast delivery ! will be placing another order soon.<br />Thank You Mike Savage
B0009IBJAS|4|aa
B001KSCQOE|5|No problems
B0068C24HG|5|good
B004K299JW|5|Works!
B00AVZSWOK|5|LOVE LOVE LOVE this addition to my Rogue!  I was getting concerned that my part would not arrive on time but it came in and my husband installed it.  Adds something very nice to the car!
B004GCW2MW|5|works fine
B007O5GX14|4|I bought this for my 2006 F150 and it works better than expected, but the supplied wiring harness does not fit as advertised as it has the wrong plug, at least for the 2005 to 2008 F150. Luckily I ordered the the harness separately from Tekonsha ( #3035P) and with that it's truly a plug and play affair. Install took 10min.
B000WKB1RE|5|stock caps
B000HPWIGC|5|Ordered for my 1999 Pontiac Grand Am with aluminum control arms. Perfect fit. Looks like typical Moog quality. Installed with basic hand tools. The only specialty tool that would be helpful is a ball joint separator (aka pickle fork). The included grease zerk will help ensure this part lasting the rest of this car's life.
B003YCMQNA|4|LIKE
B00G61CQ54|5|Awesome
B005G50QEY|3|Looks great good price but now I can't put my saddle bags back on correctly any answers?
B00I0H27EW|3|Just okay. Kind of cheap. The color is quite nice. I gave up trying to install the back seat cover. Too frustrating. I was able to tuck the front seat covers in enough so I did not have to use the clips and contort myself enough to get under the seat.
B00K6DN9E0|5|Fast shipping, Great quality as expected from Lund.  You have to drill a hole on the passenger side middle brace but aside from that was very easy and solid.
B0049Z2WMQ|5|no problem with sealing
B00KO3P74M|5|These belts were awesome. I just wanted something different though. I do recommend.
B0043027LI|2|$20 for 1 sponge applicator?... Very deceiving image. I am a huge fan of chemical guys but this was a major letdown. Sorry will be very careful from this point on.
B000AS1XYE|5|iI had about 12 oz.Lucas  in a 4 cylinder Honda. My daughter was away and out in the summer  desert with the car and ran it for 10-15 minutes&#34;very very  hot&#34;-on her way to the next town  with smoke coming off big time(-the dumb things kids do! ) I told her take it to a mechanic the next week if would even start! She drove to a shop who told her the radiator hose had busted big time . The mechanic checked the car out after the hose repair and said the spark plugs were also almost entirely burned up.&#60; and he d never seen that in a car w/o a destroyed engine. He replaced the plugs and off she went.Ilater  drove the car 500 miles and it ran fine! I told my local  5 star mechanic ,and commented I had some Lucas in the engine. This very capable old timer nodded his head and said yeah! it may just have kept the engine from seizing up! I know there are those knowledgeable people who say nay when it comes to additives ,but I am a believer!
B006YBDQ3M|1|Im upset because I loved these, but 3 months it not along time and already in the driver side mats all tore apart.
B00I6VTUWY|5|Was so happy with the quality.  I purchased one for my daughter also.
B00F21M1D6|5|Wear it with pride.  I dare them make me remove it from my work uniform.  I earned it, I'm wearing it, and thats that. The note seller sent in package was a nice touch.  Semper Fi
B000P17NXQ|5|very easy install...
B0015UA2LG|4|These pads are much better than original one. Less dust only problem didn't come with clips for rear pads
B000CFOJ96|5|I've bought 2 of these because they are one of the few brands that sell the 14&#34; blades that my car needs, and both times I've been happy. They are easy to install and uninstall.  The first one lasted about a year (during a rainy summer and a cold, icy winter)  and I'm hoping the second lasts just as long.
B000C53RCG|5|Easy install on my 2003 Pathfinder.  Ride quality is much improved.  As always, great pricing on Amazon!
B00DWVN08I|3|I didn't notice, if it was posted, the description was not for my 2005 4 Runner, however, I made it fit.  Looks dull/used.  However, it looks better than not having a cover.  I am still looking for the cap model and I don't want to pay Toyota price on it.:)
B002LEEX88|5|My car looks GATOR awesome !
B00M78820I|5|“ So far I really enjoy the sunshade and it has helped to keep my car cooler. ”
B0037DD3RO|5|Lightweight, compact, easy to use, water boils quickly. I love the lid its great for sipping coffee/tea on cold mornings! Its minimalist design is perfect for those looking to cut weight and space for backpacking! I didn't care for the spork that it came with and opt not to use it! A small fuel canister fits perfectly inside. I have had no issues to date and expect to continue to use this for a long time!
B00EVY2LKI|5|great for cleaning very large mirror I have, makes it so much easier.
B000C9ULJ4|5|It was a good price, and arrived quickly. Normally I would go with a Mopar filter or something more expensive, but one oil change is going to kill me.
B003ZS21VK|5|The hardest part about this product was running the positive wire from the battery to the back of the car but it was simply a plug and play project. it took approximately an hour and a half to complete an works great. It loos a little overwhelming just looking at the harness but I found it to be a simple project once it was installed.
B001VILJ8C|4|KENSUN gets ``an A+ for customer service. I do not yet have enough experience but for this one comment.<br /><br />IMPORTANT<br />My Isuzu Rodeo has a rubber boot that protects the inside of the headlight from dirt. I destroyed it trying to enlarge to one inch for the Kensun HID bulb. Learn from my experience.by using the following procedure.<br /><br />Using a one inch hole punch, place the rubber boot on a wood board. Carefully center the punch around the boot hole. Firmly holding the punch, begin hammering the punch (I recommend a dead blow hammer or a rubber mallet).. A better solution would be to use a hole punch and a hydraulic press. Or best, pay a MACHINE SHOP to make the hole for you.<br /><br />Do not try to cut through in one whack or give two dozen &#34;love taps&#34; either. The rubber boot distorts when impacted. Examine your cut after each &#34;whack.&#34; Replace the punch exactly where your cut is and repeat until you have the required one inch hole.<br /><br />Trying to drill the rubber causes the boot to be voilently ripped from your grasp, resulting in tearing the boot apart. A rotary file may work if you are willing to commit a month or so of your time.<br /><br />I do not know anything about the various types of boots, so if you have a solid boot like plastic, ignore this. You won't have my problem.<br /><br />The 4 stars is an attempt to balance their excellent service with their totally inadequate instructions. I have a mess that costs me time and considerable expense.
B005CLMWYO|5|Got it and painted and all I gotta do know is put it on. I'm glad I bought it.
B00SFKMRT4|5|I had a free foam gap from a car show we went to, but wanted something a little nicer than the foam between my seats. It is so nice to have something filling that gap, the first time you drop something there and it lands on this instead of disappearing, you will realize how much you like it! I ordered the gray, but I it's much lighter than I thought it would be, it seems almost like a putty color to me. I have an Acura MDX (just in case you have the same), and my gray interior is much darker. My suggestion would be to just buy the black and don't try to match your car. It's going in a space that would normally look black anyway. I do wish I would have ordered black, but still love the fact that something is there to catch what falls  :) And this one is well made and fits nicely.
B003E2WQE4|4|Solid rack, bike fits perfect, the anti wobble part works pretty well to.
B000WJC7Y6|4|These are great jugs and jug caps!  Golly, did I break some &#34;PC law&#34; in saying that?!
B00MZUT3GK|5|Love it fixed my problem with having no spark in my dirtbike and it runs like a raped ape now highly recommended this cdi box
B00860S8K0|4|Item as described. Thank you!
B000OUW7XE|5|Haven't use the tool yet but soon I will use it. Thank you.
B00429NKWK|5|made the badly sun damaged headlights look new in under an hour
B001C92WQS|3|I installed and followed ALL instructions, yet after a month I am still very unhappy with these brake pads and just replaced them today with a set of OEM pads. The 2 biggest problems - noisy and a lot of brake dust. I have a 2010 Honda Ridgeline w/ drill and slotted rotors and the truck just didn't care for these pads. Neither did I.
B0024NSR4C|5|Car looks new!
B00AJZFI44|5|This is the correct filter (OEM, in fact) for a 2009 Mercedes C300 4Matic Luxury. It will take about 15 to 20 minutes to do the job yourself and will save you at least $60.
B00K05B6S0|5|I don't write reviews ever. This product deserves a review. I've been using seafoam for years adding it to all engines small and large. Religiously. Always running the tanks dry for off season storage. Using fresh nonoxy fuel in small engines.<br />Well I still have the occasional carb problem.<br /><br />Used this product in two engines that needed carbs to be cleaned. One was a '89 200hp mercury Blackmax. The other was a Honda gold engine 5hp on a 12 year old lawnboy. That took 12 pulls to start. Now three pulls just like when it was new. One treatment and both run like a champ.<br />Helix 5-1 is very expensive but less expensive than a mechanic.
B00B8LC0HG|5|Worked and fit perfect.
B00480BWCI|5|Work great makes leveling my RV easy.
B000C5C9DY|1|I couldn't get it to fit. I ended up just using my old lid with a new seal.
B00HRHWHNW|5|This met my needs. It is great quality. I would not hesitate to purchase one again. I would recommend it to any one looking for it.
B005TY29FG|5|These were simple and easy to install.  Yhe quality is excellent.  They are workig very well and I wish I had gotten them sooner!
B00JH2GMMC|5|Latch works great and service was excellent.
B00HJ6O4A0|3|Better hope it's not windy because this thing is light as a feather.
B003XYOHIQ|5|Exactly what I wanted
B010AD0DDA|4|Bought this on a Wednesday, arrived at my door Saturday afternoon. That was with regular shipping. Priority overnight was an extra $95. So if you have time, just wait it out.<br /><br />Went in without any problem. Happy it came with a solid flywheel and not a DMF. I'm hoping this one last longer than the original 76k on the old one. But time will tell.<br /><br />Only complaint I have that gives it 4 stars is that when I leave it parked in gear (normally 1st) I get in thinking its in neutral. The entire shifter, well, shifted down towards the cup holders. Shifting from 1st to 2nd is super quick and I'm still getting used to the faster transition. I'm not sure if it will re-set itself to where it was as time goes on and the components align themselves, but if it doesn't I think I can get used to it the way it is.
B0002ILK4K|5|Bought to modify the power wheel and it works great as a 6V battery. Slightly bigger (taller too) than the OEM battery but much much cheaper!
B000C7NLF2|1|THESE RINGS DO NOT FIT A STOCK 4.3L V-6 IN A 1998 CHEVROLET S-10, HAD TO RETURN
B005K8E9FY|4|works well for valves facing outward, however I purchased this to change the stem on my motorcycle tire which faces into the center of the wheel...there was not enough clearance to fit the tool in and the removal tool was too wide to get through the stem hole on the bike. Worked flawlessly on replacing the stems on my car though.
B00BYH6C1E|5|Great product. Cars should come with these preinstalled
B00B36CGTS|5|Excellent item!....Received as described!....Would buy from again!.....A++++  :-)
B001G8AIMU|3|Tested it on a 6v 4.5Ah battery. Doesn't get as hot as some other chargers I've used. It doesn't have an indicator light to tell if it's on, charging or finished charging. Also the alligator clips are hard to use because the plastic covers are so slippery the clips flip sideways inside the covers when you squeeze the clip to open it.
B00CJ5E1GS|5|Bleeding brakes is always something I dreaded. It's awful. If you are reading this, you know what I am talking about. Once I bought this tool, all those problems went away. This thing not only makes it easy, it does an amazing job. I'm dead serious. Bolt up the adapter, test for leaks, fill with fluid, pump the canister up and bleed your brakes. No pumping the pedal, no waiting for air, no BS. Buy it now and save yourself HOURS of misery.
B001C6Q83E|5|Not used these yet but they look good.
B005T6VA86|5|It works as expected, truly plug-n-play
B00V3XFFE4|5|Nice accent to my ride
B000C9S0DI|3|Only complaint about this is that I had to tap the greese inserts myself and it didnt come with any greese inserts either.  Other than that part installed very easy
B000GKB0FI|3|Did not fit. I had to return it. Good thing they refunded me the money and I don't have to return the item.
B002SIS3SI|5|Sold my vehicle before I could install it, but looks cool!
B007XZK2YY|4|Got a 95 civic dx hatch and some fitment issues but after a few adjustments got it to fit haha....
B005I4DOGK|4|Absolutely love it! And it looks great on my 91 suburban! Only problem im having is that the control box has started to not work all the time. And in order to use the alleys or takedowns, i have to first turn off the full flash.
B000O5EW9G|3|Got this to take on a backpacking trip and it is light enough and compact enough for that. I only gave 3 stars because while it held water ok, it tended to sag and want to collapse when sitting by itself. If it it's suspended by the handle it works just fine.
B0062IJOJ2|5|I am about 300 lbs, and these things sure hold me up! :D
B00029J4FQ|5|I leaned out my 61 to a perfect idol in 3 minutes
B00FLOOAUQ|4|Not the highest quality but price was great.
B00CC4LX2G|5|Really cool!
B00MWNZ1LG|1|I waited a couple weeks to replace my old blades. Checked before buying to see if they were the right size for my VW. My model was listed.They did not fit. Ended up just going to dealer.
B00VVJM7M8|5|Can't see from the picture but the silver reflective color this visor has, goes GREATTT with a bike that has chrome. The visor makes the chrome stand out and the visor isn't see through.<br /><br />Is silver even though it looks brown in pic.<br /><br />Oh yea and it fits a is-17 hjc perfectly. Highly recommend it.
B00F9RNIPI|5|Luckily enough I haven't had to use the product but it came exactly as described.  looks well made / good quality.  Only minor issue seemed to be a delay by a few days in shipping the product, even though it was in stock.
B001CF3NSS|1|The cover started to disintegrate after just 4 weeks.  Pieces of the cover were all over the car like snowflakes that cling to anything including my clothing.  I had to vacuum the entire outside of the car to get read of them.<br />This is the worst car cover I have ever owned!
B00EKHFCJI|1|These things don't last very longer! if you contact them, they suggest you buy the one with a five year warranty. I just purchased a Battery Saver with a lifetime warranty. I have had 4 Deltran Battery Chargers crash.
B00B26JDY0|5|Easy to install. I have custom exhaust on my 2014 Toyota Tundra so the sounds it great but I didn't have  the tip. This looks very nice
B000YC9FTQ|4|Seems well made
B000EQR5YE|5|02 Tahoe easy replacement after dash panel lights stopped working ..after roller dimmer pot was hot for many years and finally gave out. No modification needed. Highly recommend.
B00RD982MO|4|Works well.
B0021KZFCA|5|great kit , works very good pads hold up well .
B00K7H1HSA|5|quality product well made perfect fit
B00JI5SKDW|3|god
B002BI7RHS|5|Very good quality plastic card holder that tends to last longer than the competition
B005UQKPWC|3|Since Empire Covers apparently bought or took over Road Wrap distribution, I've noticed a significant price increase for the product on Amazon.  The  6&#34; roll I just bought was packaged in a 12&#34; Road Wrap box, and was clearly 1/2 of a 12&#34; roll, cut in half by hand.  I don't know if Empire Covers is actually manufacturing Road Wrap or just selling off old inventory, but I plan to look for a more affordable brand.  Road Wrap does do a fine job of protecting the front of the car from bug stains and stone dings while on the highway.  I use it as intended, for temporary protection on longer road trips.
B00CS9CO6Y|5|Just got back from our 1,200 mile trip, and had no issues.  I would recommend getting early, and letting warm up in the sun a day before.  This will help the bag &#34;stretch&#34; out a bit more.  I fit on large and 2 small bags, and had room for 2 beach chairs on top.  I thought the straps running through the cabin of the car would be a huge inconvenience, but I barely noticed them at all.<br /><br />Overall, very impressed for the money paid  Strong zippers, durable bag.
B005OUK08I|5|Grandson loves them and they relieve my mind (just a bit).
B003BZ9LP6|4|Put two of these on a 98 bravada, I customized a  true dule exhaust and put these on, much better than stock but at times almost sounds a little bit like a rice burner, was looking more for the deep aggressive muscle exhaust, but much better than stock or straight pipes.
B00KN1AD12|1|It didn't fit. I'll tell you what though..... they returned my nmoney right sway!!! That made me much happier!!
B00G1XB8RO|4|This was my first purchase of a satellite TV system. The setup process was menu driven and very easy. The picture quality was much better than cable TV; which was pretty surprising. The only drawback was the setup process takes a long time to aquire the satellites (15 minutes). Othere than that, the system works well.
B000IYLZDO|5|Perfectly fit to my 1999 Explorer XL 4WD 4.0L. Installed in 5 minutes replacing my OEM cruise control deactivation switch (brake pressure switch) that was included in ford recall issue.
B0023VDC90|5|Fit as OEM
B00IOLCDJ8|5|I used one for underglow and ran threw a puddle and they still worked . Fragile though . Short wire but there bright
B0033WNNR4|5|Easiest install. 10 min total time. Very clean. No visible wires
B002VIAE6E|5|Great brake pad.  No noise and the ash (brake dust) is not black.  Keeps the wheels looking clean.  The integrated shim into the puck is an added bonus and a complete hardware kit makes for a more complete pad replacement.  I did not recondition the rotors.  Very little break in time required.  I will buy them again.
B004ZF39T0|5|I bought this based on a favorable online review: product was everything they said it would be! Ballast is durable and very well-made!!!
B00FH8P1DG|5|My husband is very happy with this purchase, good price!
B000JFHMVQ|4|A little expensive for molded plastic. But works great.
B0036G3I18|5|Awesome product. Not only does it swing forward it swings up and down to &#34;breakaway&#34; instead of bending or breaking leaving you stranded after a crash. Tons of adjustability for any rider.
B000C19DL4|5|Very good
B000PLV8TG|4|Fits great
B00DGPEID6|5|Perfect
B00RUESFRE|5|Getting the original mirror off was the challenge.  This mirror installed with no problem at all, and I can't tell the difference between it and the original.  Proper prep is the key to getting it to work right.  I would suggest to do a test fit before removing the back side of the 2-faced tape
B00B3P26N0|5|Worked perfectly as needed.  Would buy again without hesitation.
B004AGHNSW|5|best
B000SL0R9K|5|Great price for the amount of product you get.
B0034NKDKC|3|Great price, the front straps catch the air a certain way making tons of noise. Sounds like your in a wind tunnel the entire time riding. Would not purchase again.
B0012WW4D6|4|These are for the FE1 suspension only.
B00PQX5KII|4|My son loves it
B000EQATEC|5|2003 Sierra Z71, my truck rides as good as our brand new minivan!  Very nice, don't know how old the removed shocks were, but the difference is like a sherman tank to a porsche!
B00MMUAI44|5|This light bar was inexpensive and is bad ass ! I love it. Bright as hell and easy to mount. Great product
B00MC6H0AI|5|Easy to install 2012 Jeep liberty. Fit perfectly.  They are extremely bright. I was able to see through the tinted windows at night!!
B00FEZM99Q|4|Great fit. After a year of use in Canada these have not completely rusted out yet. Great buy for the price.
B00LMIED3Y|5|Blanks were cut and work great!  Saved me a bunch.  Thanks.
B0031ZCQG2|2|The good news is that it worked.<br />The bad news is that it failed after 9 months.<br /><br />Fortunately, it was in one of the accessible cylinders.<br /><br />If your cylinder is accessible (and it's not the wife or kid's car), it may be worth the gamble.<br />If it is one of the harder cylinders to reach (or it will be driven by somebody that will freak out when half the dash lights up), then spend the extra money for a name brand
B000C9QF9Y|5|Great product.  Perfect match and works great.  No problems whatsoever.
B006QLLO52|4|Just as described and fit my car.
B003FBV8ZW|5|Great set! I just had cataracts removed and HAD to have dark glasses to ride with. Then my wife and I trade between the yellow and clear  for late evening/night. The yellows should work pretty good for shooting glasses too! Love the foam surrounds to prevent &#34;high&#34; wind around my eye while the molded in groves in the foam prevents fogging very well. Great buy!
B00FBKUCH0|5|Work's good  thanks
B007IOOGPQ|5|great product. replaced intake gasket about 3 months ago now and working great still. will update if anything changes.
B00K9G1MS4|5|My son loves it!
B000EQET7U|2|weak
B0082365AQ|3|A month later, the tires still smell, but it is outdoors so not a real problem.  It could use a better strap and cinch, but that can be improvised at any hardware store.
B00158SFNK|4|Does the job
B00C5194KY|4|Overall, I am happy with this radiator. Not 'thrilled', but happy. I would have given 5 stars except the &#34;machined&#34; filler neck looks like it was machined by a chainsaw. I have had a tough time installing and removing the radiator cap(s).  Performance-wise... no complaints. Switching to this aluminum radiator, alone dropped my big block's operation temp. 40 degrees... almost too much!  'That' is something I can work with. Nice.
B0085Y8X3Y|3|Buttons are hard to push
B00K53DSZ6|5|Great bang for the buck, Literally! My moped was having a difficult time turning over. I replaced the battery with the Mighty Max and I was quite surprised. The moped started right up on the first crank. I would definitely buy it again if needed!
B0041CG7HS|5|I had Oakley before these that I though I loved. However, I didn't have the money to spend on Oakley's this time around, so got the Scott per a friends recommendation. In short. So far as good as my Oakley's, but time will tell on how they last in comparison. The Oaks lasted me for many years, and I hope these Scott's do the same. Have 2 pair now. One from Amazon and one from my local shop (I like to support our local economy when I can)
B00S4CQ9JM|5|Great little light!
B003BNHKBK|5|Mirror has 2 large cracks from normal trail riding of only 43 hrs.
B005JDQ552|5|Perfect fit, good quality and great price..
B00AGKW72I|1|Didn't fit right. Disappointed. Wasted $41 including shipping
B00HY4EFP6|5|Sign is perfect!  Went on easy and is very classy looking.  We placed it on our glass door and we have a white front door behind it.  You can clearly read it from the street. 5 stars for the sign for sure!  As far as keeping solicitors away:  We've had the sign up for a month now and have only had 1 solicitor. This is a big improvement since we live in town and usually have someone at least daily wanting us to buy something/go to their church/vote for whoever etc. Don't expect this sign to work miracles, some people are rude and don't care, but it can definitely help reduce the amount of solicitors you receive!
B006EKHR9W|5|Slipped right in
B00CLMBE5A|5|Product is made very well, solid, sturdy materials. If you consider yourself handy and have a friend to assist you, this can be installed in 2-3 hours. I highly recommend watching (and re-watching) these helpful videos:<br /><br />&#60;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCw68Pjt0C&#62;<br /><br /> &#60;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3gki0arQpo&#62;<br /><br />FYI:<br />a.) Buy yourself some good, high quality drill bits designed for steel/metal, you'll need them if you plan on using the hardware provided in this kit.<br />b.) I used a jack/jack stands to give myself more room to work with.<br />c.) I did re-install my heat shield (after cutting it to fit with aviation shears and drilling new holes) and I have had no rattling since. Save yourself time by marking the heat shield with permanent marker while it's in place, comparing it against the hitch for spacing/holes, then remove and modify it. When I re-installed the heat shield I used copious amounts of Loctite to avoid the potential for future loosening/rattling issues. (Subaru put money into providing you with a muffler heat shield. If it wasn't necessary, they wouldn't have wasted their time and/or $ installing the aluminum. So keep it there as it obviously serves SOME purpose!)<br /><br />Good luck and be safe, to all my fellow DIY weekend warriors!
B00N8BCHCW|5|Simple install, so far so good very nice color it did match my kawasaki green Incase you were wondering if it's a good match.
B0045H0LDU|5|Worked very well for a Tiguan.  Braking is improved over OEM and dust is lower.
B005KDO8U0|5|I love these lights
B00GSAUHB8|5|I drive a 2011 Prius and the sun shade fit perfectly. It's durable and worms very well. Very happy with this product and service!
B00PYD23DU|1|The fit was off on all the seats. Head rest cover, fine. The color was darker than it looks. Unable to use.
B001DKO336|4|Good quality part at a great price and shipped, Prime, equals Fast.  Golly, what is not to like?!
B003NV7WXG|5|Worked perfectly to give my husbands motorcycle some extra visibility. They were easy to install and are bright! He couldnt be any happier with them.
B002XLHUQG|5|Fine with all!
B0038ACVEC|5|great buy
B003TVGUK6|4|Does exactly what a door handle should do. Easy to install, about five minutes total. Only down side, doesn't come in blue to match my car interior.
B00IITR6I4|1|Came in a package of two. After cleaning glass on two different cars and applying as firmly as possible these both fell off! This happened on both cars within a day or two! Total waste of money and time. I have the 3&#34; solid badge on now that I have used before for several years. Don't waste your time trying to use the flexible ones.
B00DUBP35S|5|Fit Dodge 3500 5.9L perfectly
B00N2K6M2A|1|Bought it to use with my android tablet.  BT connects, but won't read the ECU.  I missed the window to return, so I am stuck with this item.
B000KEB65E|5|Exactly what it claims to be
B008OWZ6LO|5|Prompt delivery from Century Dodge Chrysler Jeep in Mount Airy, MD.  Adjustment lock bolt was included with grommets and linkage rod.  Took 20 minutes to install from drive up on portable ramps to drive off portable ramps. Small amount of petroleum jelly on profiled end of grommets helped.  Grommet on transfer case lever installed with finger pressure but grommet on shift lever took some help from small screwdriver.  Hope this linkage goes 178,000 miles like the first one did.
B00QJ5GTAA|5|Very good cover, poor instructions. The video on line helped a lot. Fits well.
B000C5FSLO|4|I rated this four stars,though I didn't use it. It was of good quality but this repair became more difficult than I wanted. I paid to have it done and returned this piece.
B00KTG4YDY|5|This product is exactly as advertised! It matched up perfectly with my OEM PCV valve, and it has threadlocker on it already!
B005MYKDF6|2|Install was slightly difficult trying to figure out the correct wires, but the main reason for this rating was after a week of use the flashing light on the end died, didn't bother me horribly, now a few months later the entire unit is dead. Does absolutely nothing now. Cheap but it should last a minimum of a year.
B00QMWQSAG|5|Great looking mats.  Changes the appearance of car interior much to the better.  Will repurchase from this company.
B000EDQR50|5|Worked perfect
B00OBTKKMY|5|HHNN
B00DOP54ZO|5|excellent product, excellent price
B00D0E6XHC|1|Seat covers are the same you can order straight from the factory and they do not fit snug at all. They are bulky on the sides and below the headrest. Don't be fooled by the picture, the sides on the seat cushion do not go all the way over the side. There are no holes for the knobs and levers, just a big rectangle cut out on that side. There are armrest cut outs with flaps to cover the whole if they seat does not have them. They are not custom fit at ALL.
B000KAZXHU|5|Great product!
B00YOK9NGE|5|Worked as advertised
B00JN2N5C6|5|Great little antena, works great and fit right on. Gets reception spot on, even the HD Channels worked great. Not to mention that the mini looks a bit better. Installed on a 2013 mini
B007G67JCS|5|Had to replace the lights in me '92 Civic cluster. The light's light up beautifully and bright. Although they make the cluster light up white instead of the original green color. A quick fix it to Sharpie over the LEDs to give a tint of whatever color you like,
B0009H519Y|5|Fantastic product from a fantastic company.  Rims have that clean gleam!
B000CODGZU|1|If your toy rubber duck was secured to this latch when a light  breeze came up, all would  be lost!  Pathetic.
B00WOY33EA|5|Works great.
B001LHVOVK|1|This was a fake/imitation not made by Autel.  I sent it back immediately.
B00IWHHISU|5|Excellent vest. Only issue is that it runs large. Love the vest.
B00CHDHJUC|3|I bought this for my 97 Honda Accord LX and if you're thinking about buying one for your 94-97 Honda Accord, let me tell you, it's not an exact fit. By that, I mean that some of the holes (like 4 of them) where you would put those plastic/nylon clips into the inner fender wall to hold it in place don't actually line up AT ALL. The holes on the fender liner is in different spots and the holes in the inner fender wall are also in different spots. Whoever created this fender liner did not look at Honda's design schematics and just created a generic one that fits some of the holes but not all of the holes. That's the bad news. The good news is that the &#34;outer holes&#34; of the fender liner (the holes closest to you) DO, in fact, line up with the holes in the inner fender wall. And the holes that you would use the three screws that hold up the splash guard and where you would have to remove and put into place the fender liner will &#34;sort of&#34; fit. I say, &#34;sort of&#34; because the holes are just a tad bit off that if you still had the washers for the screws, it'll hold the fender liner and the splash guard in place. Now, the difficult part is that front portion of the fender liner that's supposed to be attached to the engine splash guard. The hole there does not quite line either and I would strongly recommend a zip tie to be used to tie the engine splash guard with the front portion of the fender liner to keep it from dangling. There's also another two holes on that front portion that does not line up AT ALL with the front portion of the &#34;underside&#34; bumper. It's just way, way off. I don't understand how they could design such a shoddy piece of plastic covering (but it is just $20, so I guess you get what you pay for). And the plastic fender liner is thinner, A LOT THINNER, than the original. I can't imagine it standing up to the test of time but I guess we'll see. So if you just need something to cover the inner fender wall on the driver side and tokeep the wires from dangling, this is it. It's good enough for what it is but again, I don't know how long it will last, realistically speaking. So far though, it has rained recently in California, and it's still holding up for now. I have driven my car in loose gravel and the tiny rocks haven't really dinged the exterior just yet. So far so good but it's only been 3 weeks in. If I wasn't feeling so cheap, I'd have gone for the Honda OEM fender liner instead for $40 plus the 8mm plastic/nylon clips (don't get the 10mm clips; IT WON'T FIT those holes) I bought off of Amazon as a &#34;suggested item&#34; to buy with the fender liner. All in all, if you need something cheap and that will &#34;sort of&#34; fit and serve as a shield to the fender wall of the driver side, this is it. Just don't expect Honda OEM quality. I recommend removing the tire before you go about putting the fender liner into your car.
B00EP3PUV2|5|great stuff, very easy to install a baby can do it!
B00062YUY4|5|muy buenas
B00075OSC4|5|great Battery! it has never left me on the side of the road...
B0095CY11S|5|Installed the rears seem to work fine also quiet can't beat the price.
B005HE2J80|5|excelente
B00YDKTVB2|4|Work great
B0002NYBC8|5|Sealed a stubborn evap core leak. 3 months so far so good. Good stuff!
B003SSQO2Y|1|Hoo boy these are terrible! The instructions are incomplete and hard to follow, the covers don't fit snugly no matter how much you tighten the complicated under-seat straps, and the piece that fits over the head rest looks like a diaper. I'm not even willing to say &#34;you get what you pay for,&#34; since my last pair of seat covers cost about the same, were made of more durable material, and fit much better.<br />One positive: I now know much more about the area under my car seat, and it has never been cleaner!
B00NNM882Y|2|Cheep plastic, did not fit, had to modify:-/
B000EBICHI|1|Difficult to get fastened on seat --  not as much support as i hoped for or wanted.
B009EA9Q6Q|5|Perfect replacement for our 2014 yukon xl.  Nice quality that is unreal at this price!  The electronic connection routes thru your door panel and connects to the power window and door lock button control panel.
B00317DNLM|4|Very nice vibrate colors quality decals
B00KTJ6D26|5|As long as you have the chip from broken remote it works great. Opening and closing the case were a bit difficult and cumbersome but once I was able to click it in it worked great.  I also bought the programmable ones do that didn't work at all
B00T7GYAWW|5|seemed a little heavy to me at first ,but after I saw how easy it was to install,and how well it performed on my sand rail geting beat to death.I was glad it was so heavy duty. I just ordered a 32&#34; and 3-4&#34; to replace the rest of my old out dated lights....They also look so much awsome and up 2 date.Would highly recommend this product.Very good price also.
B004I0FHM4|4|This part fits my 2005 Volkswagen Beetle! But the small panel for screw is hard to be installed.
B00JGFV8EM|3|Faded
B000BQYA7W|5|It works very well, does nothing to the paint... Go around the decal edges with a Q-Tip, after a few minutes the decal will lift off, then spray on paper towel and wipe off the area. I did 2 cars a 2014 Chevrolet Sonic and 2008 Honda Element, no problems...
B001GN6YU0|5|I have a Curt system on my car. I love it. This system is personal hobby. Will upgrade home made leaf vacuum. This one connects to tractor, etc..
B0042H6BA0|4|The bag was good for what we needed but cumbersome to zip - required two people or extraordinary effort for one.  Stap tie downs were difficult to get tight enough to prevent wind disturbance and noise.  Also, the heat in Phoenix made it very HOT to the touch,
B000CM3I9G|5|Why wouldn't you, your housing isn't broke and the mirror cell out? For under ten bucks this thing was a steal, and in in minutes, I've been thru the car wash only to withstand the brushes, and shine!
B001FLZ1YI|5|Looks great and was easy to install!
B00TF7BVWK|5|I know this is for car trunks but I'm using it under the bunk in our camper for clothing and toiletries. The outside pockets make great additional storage for small things.
B005KDOA3K|1|Once I put them in  my right headlight seemed to be off. I did some testing and realized that for some reason the headlight does not focus the light properly where it should be. When parked my car close to a wall and turned the headlights on, the light was everywhere on the wall without any beam pattern. I was not sure if there was some issue with the light bulb or with the headlight itself. However, once a put my old PIAA bulb back the pattern was fine again. There is no visible damage as far as I can see on the bulb.
B0058V9CF0|1|Had for 2 years in my Equinox and the literally fell apart.
B00J5SMQ96|4|I ordered this radiator from another supplier that was more expensive but I got it same-day. This radiator was to be installed on a 2002 SAAB 9-5 Arc (V6). When attempting to install, it wouldn't fit due to the fact there were 2 brackets sticking out (forward) on the right-hand tank which greatly interfered with the inter-cooler.  No way would it work. So I took a multi-function cutting tool and removed the brackets. They cut very easily. After this modification, the APDI radiator mounted up perfectly. Made in Korea but seems to be of good quality. If you are going to install it on a car like I own, unless they've make a change to the design, you will have to saw off the 2 brackets to make it fit. I can be done without harm if you are careful.
B00Y1HUJYK|5|These work great. I took them to the local hardware for cutting. They did not charge but warned that if they did not work, the hardware was not liable. They work perfectly!
B007RVQVBC|5|Easy to install by 2 non-mechanical folks.
B00RGQ1OJW|5|Great product! Looks great on my bike and I look forward to using it when I ride to work.
B005GK23SQ|4|Took about three hours to assemble.  Faster if done again as mistakes were made causing do-overs.  Fairly easy to assemble. You should know that the nuts are metric.  Also there are two different size washers, of which the larger could be used instead of the smaller, causing a shortage of the larger, so note that when assembling. Finally, and obviously, the dolly won't glide easily if your garage floor is pitted due to salt erosion.  Mine is, but I still manage to roll it around and am glad I purchased it.
B00029KC2K|4|It is great for what it is. The ability to cut for custom fitting was a big plus.
B00K802W08|5|Looks sick!!!
B0016H0O6G|5|The kit came exactly as described and packaged very well.  It was obvious that the lights had never been opened before due to the packaging.  I have never put lights on a trailer before so someone familiar with wiring gave me some assistance.  Had they not, I think I could have accomplished the job but you'll likely want to use YouTube as a resource rather than the instructions that these come with.  For the price paid, I'm very happy with the quality and feel that it is better quality than Harbor Freight.  The wiring was extra long for my 8 foot bed so I didn't have to worry about getting it exactly right.  The lights lit up properly and came working as they should right out of the packaging.  The hardware (nuts/bolts) were a little small in my opinion and I had to substitute for larger hardware to fit the trailer that already had pre-existing holes in it.  The person connecting the wires preferred butt connectors over the ones that the kit came with.  Overall, a good product.
B0010G4CBG|5|Excellent product never seen one like it never knew I could charge my ipad in the car but now I never ran out of battery any longer with these great product more grease
B001EE1RNU|5|Great product.  Works great.
B000C57YIO|5|thanks
B004J9JLUS|5|Tight fit on my 2008 Cadillac STS; overall happy and Satisfied.
B00VM4OQBM|5|I installed this light bar in the bumper of a Subaru Impreza WRX.  It does extend the brightness of the lights PAST the 'brights' of this vehicle.<br /><br />It seems like it is made solidly.  As long as you have a decent wire harness you'll be just fine.  I made a 5 minute video of the installation steps.  You can search youtube for ''Subaru Impreza WRX LED 13 inch lightbar install video&#34;
B000CSD66U|5|Worked on my BMW R1150GS (single spark).
B00BWTW40W|5|Nice fit
B00TLG3ZCE|3|Did not receive all that is in the picture only received the head gasket itself...so it was useless
B008EEYTRE|5|Great kit, great price, with almost everything you need to replace when doing a timing belt.  Does not come with the accessory belt, but thats not a big deal.  As noted, the water pump can have some sharp edges left over from manufacturing.  I don't really recall any on mine, but it was in the back of my mind as I did the work on my car.<br /><br />Everything else was great, came with everything as described.  I did run into a little issue pulling the pin on the hydraulic tensioner.  I ended up having to use a metal saw to cut the pin, as it bent while I was pulling it out.<br /><br />Quality parts, and car is running great.
B00HFLAFUM|5|Direct replacement for 2013+ Taurus w/ 13.8&#34; Brakes.  Also works to retrofit 13+ brakes on 2010-2012 Taurus/Flex.
B005KOZ25Y|5|Bought for 02 Tahoe err. Found loose random chrome screw rattling around inside. I risked removing instead of returning hassle. All working great. Small, cheap fits in glove for easy access.
B002XGEPY6|5|Use it for oil pressure light on my motorcycle.  I can see it now! Bright!
B004A0RDQ0|5|This is the same Fram filter that you can buy just about anywhere. But it's cheaper to buy it on Amazon. Just make sure you get the correct one that fits your car.<br />No complaints.
B00JRU9PXM|5|I was skeptical at first with it being offbrand, but it has really held up. Along with style, it's convenient to have two ports and the touch sensor.
B007TY232S|5|Better than the original.
B004A6PLSG|1|The 'WILL THIS FIT MY CAR' did not work for me!  While it actually would have fit inside where the old one came out it was appox. an inch smaller on all sides would not have done much good.as a filter.  Info that came with filter made it look and sound a lot simpler than it was to replace. I WAS NOT HAPPY  that I will be charged almost  $7.00 to return it  Next time I will go to a brick and mortar as I ended up having to do with the glove box apart and the old filter still in place.
B000BODW0U|5|Love this stuff!  Can't brag enough about it!  If you have a blemish on your vehicle, it's worth the price of the product to see if you can reduce the damage.  My car had a huge scuff from getting hit on the interstate by another car.  The black mark went from the wheel well to the back of the car.  The photo shows what Scratch Out got the horrible scrape down to.
B00873J0YY|5|What a pain to assemble! The pieces fit pretty snug, so I'd recommend a tad bit of grease to slid the large metal pieces together. Allow a good amount of time to get these set up. Otherwise, I have no complaints! Two pairs of J racks for 60 bucks is a great deal. If you are looking for something that is cheap, but gets the job done, I strongly recommend these J racks. I drove a total of 5-7 hours over the course of a few days with a pair of kayaks on them (including 70mph driving) and these didn't move at all. If you are looking for top notch quality, don't buy these, but like I said, they get the job done and look great! Very satisfied.
B006B25HJA|5|direct HD replacement for a lens
B001A1PPBM|2|2 stars because there breath good but mine street to tear around the cuff first time I put hem on and the have only got worse I will not buy again
B001O0D6RE|5|Needed this to go fishing at night ,it installed perfect and does its job.
B0001EX1W4|5|easy to install.  I no long worry about quick rain storms and getting my seats wet.
B00BLAFZP8|3|This bar has great LED units on it and good flash patterns, as well as being very easy to install. The only issue I had with mine is the pier cable doesn't get you very far, and the board on mine went bad only after two weeks of light use. I'm not pleased about it so I'm ordering a smaller and cheaper version to pull the board out of there and link them together.
B004ME11FS|5|It worked just as I had hoped. Product was intact and in good working order. Thank You!
B0001EX1SS|5|Easier installation
B00SA40FBW|1|Nope.. This part will not fit your bugeye WRX..<br />1. There is a critical offset needed to clear the intake manifold.  This part doesn't have it.<br />2. The large diameter hose is nice but useless because it doesn't clear the power steering line or allow room for the wiring harness.<br />3. I didn't get far enough to find 3. But after I discovered the stock after MAP pipe won't fit, it requires a silicon MAP pipe.<br /><br />I will say the hose fitting for the BOV is a nice aluminum piece.  The PCV ports are good too, the MAP pipe connection however is flimsy.
B00NVV8D3G|1|Picture shows smoothly on a helmet but it will not stick on without wrinckles because of the curviture of the helmet..Waste of money for helmet sticker
B004GCGLQ0|4|Perfect fit.
B005BZJZAA|5|Vary happy they work better than I haf expected, truly plug-n-play, and I'm happy to say they defiantly get me noticed on the road 😊
B0065TA56O|4|looks good.
B007EFGSZ0|5|Arrived just on time small box sinister logo on the side item fit just right<br /><br />Instructions were ok but not very helpful had to improvise a bit but overall a great buy
B004NTGN8C|5|Works on 2011 Hyundai Elantra Limited.  Fits/ works as it should, easy install.
B000XBBISO|5|Perfect fit, took me five minutes to replace it, and no more leaks.
B00HA1MTYC|5|This shade fits my 2014 Corolla S perfectly. I cannot find a sunshade other than this custom one that fits. It is worth the money to me to have a shade that fits perfectly.
B00B3ZDNF0|5|great stuff however they are a bit loud and cause a bit of drone when accelerating, first starting up, or cruising around 40 to 70mph. great look though and people have mistaken my v6 for a GT a couple of times.
B000CQ6MO0|4|Met expectations. Not hard to install but follow directions.
B007XE8C74|1|I have a 2013 Chevy Cruze that is showing a check engine light.  First off, I tried to &#34;update&#34; the firmware and codes definition as per the instructions in the manual.... did not work.... on two separate computers..... So I tried it anyway.  GOT CODES..... but nothing that helps.....some random hexadecimal code that no-one understands.  Luckily this did not cost much, but it was still money wasted..... Spend a little more and buy a real unit.
B00BTL6YHW|4|Good quality bumper. Already primered saves a ton of prep work.
B00A9WH0K2|5|Lost the key to my four wheeler. Local Polaris dealer wanted $70 for this. This came quick, plugged right in and I'm back in business. Thanks
B00915JI08|5|Fast and efficient shipping - installation instructions included. Very happy
B000E2D6PK|5|Working great so far in my bike.
B0028AYDSK|5|Very nice addition to my Jeep.  Well built.
B00F8U3YZ0|5|Just what I was looking for. Gift recipient loved it!
B008BVZPVY|5|Work as expected. Delivery was quick.
B000CNHD6E|5|Replaced my entire exhaust system on a '97 4X4 ext cab 1500 Dodge along with the flowmaster 2030004 catalytic converter. It fit, it did not take long, it sounds good, I'm happy. Ordered on a Sunday and it arrived on my doorstep the following Wed. I live in Ak. (not Arkansas :)
B000C7TU4S|3|Ditto on the washer reservoir. Just shorten the upper tabs 1/2 inch on top and cut the width 1/2 inch up at the bottom of the tabs so you can slide it in. I reused my old bushings because they tightened up without squeezing the plastic mount so the radiator is free to expand. The new bushings did not allow that expansion.  Radiator seems to be a solid unit overall. My unit came with a broken mount which holds the rubber bushing right by the filler neck. Styrofoam blocks were cracked there indicating the box was dropped on it's corner although the cardboard box showed no evidence of crushed corner. It did show that the box was laid on it's side and other items stacked on top. Thankfully the fins were not crushed. It's a wonder anything makes it through UPS in one piece. There doesn't seem to be any logic to Amazon packaging either. My indestructible radiator hoses were packed all around with tons of bubble wrap yet a hard drive is placed on the bottom of the box with not even enough bubble wrap to prevent it rattling around. Go figure.
B0067ECPS8|5|Product arrived undamaged and promptly. Fits my 2006 Kia Spectra 5 like a champ! Reccommended !
B00O7DLOOM|5|Clips that come with mats for a Sonic don't hold. Fix this by using clips that can be easily removed from stock mats. otherwise awesome product
B0006303LW|5|working so well,<br />really holding the shine
B000LOLWZW|4|The 7/16&#34; size is very large and would not work with my trailer safety chain. One of the two I ordered was bent from manufacturing.
B00WDSVEE8|5|An excellent product. These happen to fit my glasses perfectly, and the clamps, hinges, and optical quality of the lenses couldn't be better. Well worth the purchase.
B005HV3STW|4|Can't wait to put it on my car.
B004QEM78Y|5|good
B007ETLLJ4|5|A+++  As advertised.  Works well
B008DNC7KW|4|Plate is a very sturdy metal, but the lettering is just a sticker.  Get what you pay for I guess...  I just hope the sticker lasts for a few months.
B00SZK212M|5|Great.  Works well.  Easy to install.  A slight blue hue to them, but bright as expected.
B00IITUPCS|4|I just used Torque RT700 for the first time for a track weekend at Mid Ohio.  I had no problems whatsoever with Torque RT700 in both my brake and clutch systems.  Brake pedal stayed firm all weekend, meaning no bubbles formed from overheated brake fluid.  The fluid in the brake reservoir looks as clean as it did starting the weekend.  I won't hesitate to use Torque RT700 again.  The price, at $33 per 500ml, is a drawback compared to other brands, but being able to use a US-made brake fluid product whose performance numbers match or exceed Castrol SRF is a strong plus for me.  Only reason I didn't give 5 stars is I've also had fine results with Motul 600 in my track-driven street car, at about 1/2 the price.
B004JBX0HQ|5|easy to install and prevents small puddles from winding up on the truck!
B000C2W84C|5|Quality water pump at a great price. Perfect for my jeep yj
B00829I2VU|5|Fit and Works perfectly on 3zr engine.
B00MWXCLTG|4|Quick shipping since it came from Hong Kong 10 days. Fit my application China dirt bike however cable was a little too long but made it work seems good quality would buy again if I need one.
B007CVSBL0|5|These are great.  The fit was tight because of my spray-in liner, but they went in with a little effort and work well.
B000Y844EG|3|good object.
B0002NUNKW|4|Unlike most detailing sprays, this can be applied without a thorough washing or having to use it only in small patches. It may not provide a shine sufficient to satisfy the most fastidious of car detailers, but the ease of use makes it good choice for the rest of us.
B00802H5QW|5|Awesome customer service<br />I received a set of headlights that were the wrong color tone (they were pink) and kensun had a replacement set to me in three days. The kit is a simple plug and play system. It took me about 15 min per head light.
B005KBLVP2|5|Looks great, fits perfectly!
B00669TYKQ|5|Very heavy/well made tube. Used on a Cub Cadet 982.
B00MI4WTYQ|4|just what I needed and fitted without forcing
B000E2APZO|5|great product..fast shipping..as described....flawless purchase,cant complain..
B000W0RQ8C|5|gangster lock.
B00CS7ET9Q|5|Have had on my truck a few months. No fade or peeling.
B002H0RK22|2|The face shield i received was NOT pin lock ready, lt completely lacked the plastic tabs for attaching a pin lock anti-fog insert.
B0017TTPE0|5|pricey but did a great job on my 2005 BMW Z4  buy the sm arnold pro interior  exterior brush and save a few buck vs buying theirs however the brush and the cleaner brought my 10 year old top back to a very clean state teh protector works great this is pricey but if you have a Haartz fabric top then this is for you there is also a youtube vidoe one how to use this watch it I alos had to ues a lint roller before and afte cleaning to get up some stuff that stuck
B00Q71CBX0|5|I just received my package and sooner than expected!!! I love my cute frame on the back of my new Benz! It's just what I wanted! It says cute,fun,and chic with a pop of bling, BLING!!!
B00DSVMCUE|5|I love this vest! Very well made and comfortable! great fit and looks!
B000CG91FM|4|Good quality part at a great price and shipped, Prime, equals Fast.  Golly, what is not to like?!
B00MDLAT82|5|Higher quality and better artwork than I had expected!
B006EGAIJ2|1|They dont work in hot weather,  backed onto them and the sides bowed out,  Junk
B006X27RF0|5|perfect fit
B00BSGN5L6|2|We ordered a dozen to replace a some of the incandescent light bulbs in our RV.  These LED lights are natural white and bright, exactly what we were looking for.  They are noticeably cooler and use less amp according to our meter.  We like them so much that we have ordered additional two dozens to replace all the lights both internal and external.  UPDATE: June, 2017 - these LED bulbs burn out very quickly.  I purchased 24 for our RV and they are almost all gone.  We only use our RV about 2 - 3 months a year.  Don't waste your money and look elsewhere.
B005HFYE1O|5|I thought my order was for Bosch Relays, but these are ok. Having the wire kit that comes with them is cool. We'll see how long they last.
B00T0U033A|5|Love it!! Exactly what I wanted.
B003ZC185G|4|As Expected
B00EIFYU8G|5|Is a filter - it works
B0058O1WFU|1|Did not fit.
B00FPL0LV2|4|After the second month of using it. It started to not go up all the way.... and it doesn't have a reset button.
B004FSEJZA|5|Love this product.  Company very generous with the shipment as well.  Thank you!
B0002JMLQU|5|I use it in all my transmissions.  Great preventive maintenance!  I put one tube in each transmission.
B00PT18QAQ|5|Easy to read and accurate. Like that the reading stays until you release the pressure
B000AL8VD2|5|It  works
B002UCYRYQ|5|Very good product. Works exceptionally well on helmet face shields.
B00K15HEP8|2|Not the quality I was hoping for
B00CFR2EXC|5|Perfect for my Nissan Rogue.
B007J6MUBA|5|Fits perfectly of course in the original clips and the color matches the interior.
B000E28C6S|5|Great product
B000FIXQXK|5|handy to have around the house
B002IM110G|5|i do love my soldier proud army girlfriend
B000BQYA7W|3|Very strong smell, be careful.  I did feel a bit light headed when I used it to remove the window film from my living room window, even with as much ventilation as possible.  You have to wipe it off pretty quickly for it to work well.  It did work, but the fumes were a bit much for me and the ease of use for such a big project wasn't so easy.  For small areas I believe it would be good.
B00937YVXI|5|Ignition sw a-ok and fast delivery
B00167TYHQ|3|Hopefully it battery will hold its charge over time.
B000YE582C|5|Bought one from Napa for 40.00 and had to replace it two weeks later. This one off Amazon cost 10.00 and works very well
B00KTIQAZW|5|This product works great. I am very appreciative of the customer service and quality of the product.
B00VVC3ML0|5|The item was exactly what I needed and was exactly as the picture displayed. It also arrived earlier than the delivery time said and I was very impressed.
B00E5OUOCQ|2|I received the product on time but it did not fit my 2012 VW CC. This is waste of $15.
B000E28C7M|5|Best filter for a Harley, easy to get on and off with little to no mess unlike the factory filters.
B00EZZVI7U|5|Worked as described
B00DW954UC|3|Did not work as good as expected for my RV...travel trailer.  CAMCO makes great products, but this model is probably better suited for a motor home, not a towed trailer.
B00MJ46Y6Y|1|Quite problemsome for us.  Bought this for my son's black Mazda RX8.  The fit was reasonably good, and it was very effective at keeping the water out...........saw no leaks.  But the issue comes from the soft inside liner. It may would be adequate for a vehicle that is driven every day so the cover is constantly removed.  But in our case, the next week after getting this the car was not driven for 5 days so it sat covered as would be expected. When we did remove the cover, the condensation from the car sitting in the sun had caused the soft white inner liner to shed onto the BLACK paint and left a whitish film on everything.............  To tell you how it was, it took 2 HOURS to get all the residue off the windows.........we washed them, cleaned them with Windex and a couple other glass cleaners and finally had to clean them with rubbing alcohol and STILL had to use excessive effort (elbow grease) to rub the film off then.  The rest of the car took several washings and finally a wax job so the rubbing compound action from the wax finally removed MOST of it.  The seller (when contacted) authorized a return.......BUT at my return cost for a product that did not perform as would be expected. This would require my returning the product from Georgia to California with the return shipping cost to be almost equal to the purchase price.........so obviously I did not return it.  A good seller would allow the return shipping charges to be credited but not these folks. Now if I had ordered the wrong size, etc. I could understand. But not when the product did this to my vehicle..........guess I will just keep it and throw it over the riding mowers or something...........DEFINITELY will NOT go back on a car.<br /><br />I have bought THOUSANDS of items from Amazon over the last dozen years and I think this is the FIRST seller I have encountered that charged to return a mis-performing item. Obviously many charge if you order the wrong item, etc. but not when the product does notperform up to expectations and as advertised.
B0073G1TN6|1|The bulbs do not have a Anti Glare Shield (Casper Shield).  This causes the light to bounce off the bottom of the headlight reflector housing and blinding other drivers. The only way you would want this product is if you have a projector headlight. I returned mine.
B00KZJQ2L2|5|Very nice sunshade for the price.  Good fit and does a good job keeping truck much cooler.
B00E5OUOCQ|3|It does what it is made for. but the size is a little bigger for my VW Passat. Would recommend others though.
B009BGP4NM|5|Very good product and super fast shipping! !
B00YNLYMLA|5|Fit our car exactly and look very nice as it protects our car seat backs.  I would definitely buy this product again
B000QUZ572|5|I would buy this again good shipping good product.
B00FJFD6K2|5|Great product and service, exactly as described.
B00WMK6Z46|5|These look excellent in my jeep! They are very thick, sturdy and durable. Excellent quality for the price. I would recommend these to anyone and everyone!
B007FTV9Q8|5|Fits perfect on my 2012 Nissan Maxima
B001COAL20|5|Fantastic deal.  Replaced all 6 ignition coils on a 2002 BMW M3 Convertible Coupe.  Perfect fit and function.
B007Y87WM0|5|The part arrived before expected. Brand new, not rebuilt. Easy install.  No complaints. And it was a great price.
B0006Z9SQQ|4|Convenient and effective, just as it should be.
B004I0IC58|5|Very happy with this purchase. Gave my ride a brand new look, without the high price from the dealer. It fit perfectly in both sides. Highly recommended.
B008HZKM26|5|Great price and fit.  Includes everything you need to replace the pads on front brakes.
B008CE06ZA|5|Love it
B00GR9NENS|4|Good one but small size
B004YJTMDE|5|Great product and easy to install
B000NCS7GE|5|Great product!
B00GZRZTQ2|5|Perfect fit.
B00UXG7F7W|4|Not quite exact fit for my Dodge 2002 Sport Ram 1500 (missing Window lock button) but all the buttons work and it's nice not having to worry about a window getting stuck partially closed.
B002K64OSG|1|Junk, burned out two months later, got a ticket.
B007BKFQI8|5|It works
B00YCNJZHA|5|they work and are cheap
B005LFPKAO|5|Great price. Super fast shipping. Will buy from again. Thank you!
B00WDSVEE8|5|Wow..fits perfectly and is 21 dollars less expensive than ones found at Dicks and of the same quality. Would purchase again!
B004J10QIW|1|Received it very fast but had to buy extra parts because it had damage to it that caused it to leak from first being installed.
B007BKQ1FU|5|Top notch lenses.<br />Great in the woods, and even better in the sun
B0009H51DU|5|M. CM, FFBBM
B00BD4YIJQ|5|for some cheap seat covers, these are wonderful.  Had them for months now and they have made my old cracked and beat up seats look new again
B000C57WB8|5|Way better than factory replacements, easy to install, come with all the right supplies.  Buy these!
B005HX6V4O|4|very good quality a little expensive but really does look like carbon fiber also, very easy to work with
B0012TWTBG|5|stock caps
B00CZECRAU|4|Good bell, great packaging! The note, inside the the packaging, was nice as well. I definitely will be returning for future needs!
B00GZ20JG2|5|My fog lights are amazing they brightness that they bring to my Jeep is ridiculous. After getting them installed and taking them out in the nighttime it turned my jeep into something better.
B00PHW93YU|4|Easy 10 minute install. Does what it says it will do. Adhesive is surprisingly strong. I've had for several weeks, washed the car in touchless carwashes several times with no issues at all.
B00CPGQ1GO|3|Is plastic, not rubber, and has no weight to it.  Moves easily and unintentionally.  Is fine if you put your bike down on it, but quality less than what is portrayed in photos.
B00CFBVAMY|4|Works and took away the rattle from my old one.
B006J78SU2|5|Great materil right fit
B00T9H5V1S|4|This is a very bright and durable off-road lightbar.  We installed it on our SUV for off-road and back road use.  Although there were no instructions the lightbar was easy to install. It is a 32\\" lightbar which has 18,000 lumens at 180 watts. Since there were no instructions, we converted 180 watts to amps which came out to be 15 amps for our fuse rating.  We installed an after market switch to control the lights off and on as needed.<br /><br />The reason I am giving it a 4-star review is because it does not come with any instructions, and the threads for the mounting brackets were painted with the lightbar which made it hard to install mounting bolts.  Would recommend using a thread chaser if possible before installing.<br /><br />[Free sample provided for unbiased review]
B0082JPI9O|1|Neither one worked when plugged in. Tried several different ballast as well. Ballest had power coming from it to the light but did not light up.
B000SL0R9K|5|Good product...works as advertised!  I would recommend this to others.
B009S2Y65Q|5|Super fast delivery and excellent product!
B00YE5Q132|5|This is a multi function rechargeable car battery jump starter and booster and portable power bank made by DBPOWER. WOW this is a truly amazing product, so many features and such a huge capacity, as a tech enthusiast this is one of the most useful and convenient gadgets which i have, it just has so many uses from jump starting my car, charging my USB gadgets, charging any laptop, acts as a power bank and also has a high powered torch.<br /><br />Inside of the products box there is a very nice high quality carry case which has stored all of the leads cables and accessories all neatly held in by there own elastic straps. When this very nice carry case is unzipped there is the power bank to the right side, i would recommend that you read the small detailed instruction manual included in the box, this is quite a complex product as it has so many features so i felt it was appropriate to read the manual before i started to mess with the interface.<br />Included with the power bank are both chargers for a UK wall outlet and a 12 V car charger, this is extremely useful because you care able to charge this product whilst in the car which makes it so much more convenient.<br /><br />Here is a list of all the items included with this product:<br /><br />1*DBPOWER Car Jump Starter Mobile Power Bank<br />1*Car charger<br />8*Notebook adapter connector<br />1*Pair of Battery clamps<br />1*Four-in-one mobile phone adapter<br />1*Power adapter<br />1*case bag<br /><br />Charging the power pack does take a long time, i tend to just leave this portable power bank on charge over night because it takes around 10 hours, this is a very big capacity product so don't be put off by the long charging times because this power bank needs it.<br /><br />The capacity of this power bank is so large that i was able to charge my iPad air twice, this is incredible considering that the iPad air has such a large battery itself, this is really one of those products which is fantastic to be left in yourcar, there has been a few times before where my car has not started after work, if only i had this charger then because it would of really been useful.<br /><br />Some positives which i like with this power bank are:<br /><br />- Has a fast 2.1 A USB output which is perfect for charging both mobiles and tablets<br />- Has a huge 16000 mAh capacity which is plenty to fully charge a laptop or charge a phone several times<br />- Has the ability to jump start a car<br />- Includes most laptop connectors so that you can charge your laptop on the go<br />- Can charge the power bank from inside your car or AC outlet<br />- Powerful torch on the front of the power bank which has strobe and SOS features<br />- Very high quality carry case for all of the included accessories<br /><br />I truly could not recommend this product any more, it is so useful, i would consider this as a must have because it has so many features. One day you will find that your car won’t start and that is the time when you wish you would of had this product, or if you already own it then this is the time when you realise that it is truly with the £60 price.<br /><br />Such a useful product - 5/5
B00PF0HIG4|3|Seems like a solid product! Didnt work for me because of fitment.
B00CHT8MHA|5|Thanks to everyone for taking the time to answer my question. Yes, it does fit a 2008 Fleetwood Discovery, a perfect fit. The original cover lasted about 6 years before starting to fade, then finally crumbled this year. Hopefully, I can get the same life from this new one. Very simple to install, just line up the tabs and snap it into place.
B004Z2N9UC|4|Almost as cute as my little dog is.
B0012WW3LY|5|nice aftermarket product. Fit perfectly and looks great
B00074Q29W|1|Pain in the butt
B00J4QFK38|2|Hello kitty is so cute on this figure but I am disappointed of the tape they use. It won't stick on my dashboard.
B0073MG1QU|4|Seems to be good quality and it's a direct fit. But the Jeep does not run a single degrees cooler then my original radiator with 133k packed with leaves and dirt...
B000IY8OLU|5|Definitely noticed a difference in acceleration after installation.
B000C543MO|3|Local parts houses can get this very same part number kit for 11.99 and that is all 4 bushings and washers
B000WK47BQ|5|10-10
B0064DIZXG|5|Great
B000182E5K|5|nice finish product!!!!
B00DQUA21I|3|Long and wide enough to fit easily vehicle  it was purchased for.<br />But...the cinching section is only at one end of the cover. There are gromets and almost, enough extra cord to do the same thing at the other end but this easily could have been provided!<br />Since this cover fits a range of car lengths they could do a better job of providing for a better fit, but we don't  have high wind problems to deal with so not as important a feature for us. Hopefully small animals wont see it as a refuge or nesting option either....something a tighter fit would have addressed satisfactorily.<br />Just got this cover so reserving judgment on its protective capabilities till  the next torrential summer downpour.<br />We also had a lot of sticky tree debris collecting in every knook and cranny which was a pain to remove before the cover went on. This will definitely  address this problem, so at least 50% good so far.<br />Also waiting to see how the cover stands up to sun and of course its water repelent & mould growing properties.
B004E5B7YA|4|I needed more storage space in my 2015 RZR 90 Trail and this fits the bill well. The only reason it didn’t get 5 stars was because the plastic clips that are used to attach the bag to the cab of the side by side seem to be a bit weak. I ended up bending one of the clips. I didn’t think I was putting too much force behind it but I guess I did. So take your time when you tighten up the straps. The bags seem to be of good quality, the zippers work even when dusty and the main pocket is big enough for a hoodie or light jacket. I think it will work out well. Let’s see how it holds up long term.
B009SAQ28C|5|just what I needed. if you have an SRT8 you will need the brake ducking to go with this piece.
B000R3SNJU|4|I like this unit for GM use but it doesn't support a lot of the not so popular cars like the Mitsubishi line (esp my Eclipse).
B00K5MKAJE|5|I mounted these lights onto the roll bar, on my tractor this past winter when daylight was shortlived each day. It was nice knowing that no matter the length of power wire I needed to install, these lights have very little draw.  They are extremely bright. Almost too much so. As I drive, they are above, and slightly behind my head. The amount of light they throw out in front of the tractor is amazing.
B00UG52P7U|5|the product is exactly as it is described...fits great on the back of the car where my 5 and a half year old can reach things easily.  Highly recommend!
B00E0IK116|5|Great product as always, and fast delivery.
B00EJFH6YA|1|as soon as I connected it ,2 lights were out  (dead  whatever etc) I was really disappointed  .Sending it back.
B001BK073S|5|Easy Installation.
B00QRANHI4|5|I got one simple reason to love it. after using it my daughter said &#34;now the car is fresher than before&#34;. Thanks to EXTRA-O
B001Y938UU|5|Fits my 2011 Caprice Very well.
B00JW0FNQU|4|My wife's CRV has nearly 100k miles.  By adding this, I am not sure that it helped with performance but it does seem to run more silent.
B00V6X2YEU|5|Ordered for my Honda Valkyrie - well constructed Gel Cell Battery, fits perfectly and was fully charged upon arrival - the only con is it was shipped in the original bulk packaging and that is pretty sparse for a heavy item - amazed it wasn't broken but arrived in one piece even with the cover shredded and obvious rough handling in transit.
B00FH580CI|5|Perfect fit.
B00B2Q5GDW|1|Poorly made. Very cheap. The seat covers do not stay on. I ended up only using the steering wheel cover and seatbelt pad. I threw the rest away after a week of frustration. Do not waste your money!!
B000BUU5Z4|4|It's a toothbrush holder, what can I say.
B001397JF6|5|Looks great on my 1965 Ford Mustang Coupe.  I get lots of complements!
B008FYKUBC|5|Excellent blade, easy install.
B0041G3DIU|5|Perfect! Didn't want to drill in to my brand new truck.
B00EEGADTY|1|Didn't fit my 280 as it advertised
B00EC6XSHK|4|So far it works good.
B00JIEX722|5|Way brighter than stock. I hate stock, yellow lights, so a very huge improvement.
B000WJX6IM|5|This cleaner is awesome
B008PPN93W|3|Love eTrack, but I specifically bought the black painted stuff to match my brand new trailer. The eTrack wasn't outside for even 24 hours before the gloss of the paint was lost, and the black turned into more of a dark gray. Cheap paint is used, and chips off easily.
B000EDOSKG|1|Comes off the faucet when turned on
B00IN6XCB2|5|Love it. Took 5 minutes to install, then another 5 to adjust properly. Rode around then decided I wanted it one setting longer. Might weld a flat plate on the bottom of that god-awful goofy peg at the bottom. My kickstand safety switch (not bypassed) was sticky after I switched the stock stand out, so I just removed the peg and let it sit retracted in its housing, rather than lube it and unstick it because I'm lazy.
B00X0G30MQ|5|It's a sticker
B0043AV4NK|5|well I recommend article.
B00Q8VS5WK|5|Worked out great on my 2003 400ex, took my nerf bars off threw these on worked great.
B001HQWK36|5|Exactly what we were looking for.
B00N84IL9W|5|I have changed my mower's plugs several times, all with the OEM brand. each and every time the mower has still had rough idle and skipped. I have now installed these plugs and there is no skipping or rough idle so far. I will be looking to replace the OEM plugs inboth of my Arctic Cat ATVs when time comes. Great Plug so far....
B007R5XMCO|5|Love it! Would order again
B005CWSBT8|5|Excellent, and great price
B00755JMYS|2|Great bulbs at first..... After only a couple weeks, three or four of them flicker.
B00CFBTC9W|5|Perfect fit for my 06 Elantra manual transmission
B000C9I8PS|5|I replaced the vapor canister vent valve and the purge valve at the same time because I didn't know which one caused the check engine light to come on and they were inexpensive enough that it wasn't an issue. I had already replaced my gas cap also. Anyway, it only took minutes to change out both parts and the check engine light went out within a minute or so of starting the engine. This was an easy inexpensive repair that saved lots of $$$ had I gone to a repair shop.
B00KTHXO2U|4|Got these, and they worked well. The set up is a bit complicated, but that's because of Toyota, not the remote makers.  Luckily the instructions were fairly clear.  The only 2 issues we've had with them are: a) after 5 months of usage, the ink labels are wearing off a bit, and b) the panic button is a bit more close to the surface than the original, so we've had it go off just from jostling in my pocket against coins or the like.  But other than that, we were greatly appreciative to get good replacement remotes quickly and cheaply.
B007KCXOE0|5|perfect match
B00GD6T4UW|5|Very cool sticker,, (if you are a skier)
B00EZUL6ZY|2|cheap. did not fit my van very well - a little too small.
B000AS1XYE|5|354,000 on 2002 Silverado 2500hd used it since it was brand new, never been into the engine. Still runs strong !!
B00I6SZLFC|2|S.all
B009ZXCT7U|4|With having two boys my furniture can get quite beat up. I thought I was gonna have to toss my leather couch because it just looked so gross.<br /><br />So I tested a small spot and it worked ok. It did look better than before, so I decided to give it a try on the whole couch.  Again it did not make it look brand new but it did make it look a little better than the kiddy mess that was on it before.<br /><br />My only problem is that it is very TACKY, it makes it uncomfortable to sit on, I tried to buff it but it just seemed even after sitting overnight that it was still tacky. I am on the fence if it is better than before. I have moved the couch out to my garage so it can have time to dry out I will update on how long it takes to make the tackiness to go away.<br /><br />I would suggest that when you use this product that you have enough time (maybe a couple of weeks hopefully) to let it fully dry. This might be a great product for people who resell.<br /><br />So I am giving it 4 stars because although it does work it can be a pain in the butt and can take some time.<br /><br />I did get this product for free t in exchange for my honest review. I am not compensated in any way for this review.
B00X4NCLTS|1|Definitely get what you pay for, thought this would be cool because of the &#34;ninja 300&#34; on it but it's extremely low quality in my opinion, parts don't stick, the clear coat is sorta bubbly, and the clear coat actually has came off a little, I cleaned the bike properly prior to application also.
B007M9AAM0|3|I received the sticker and it wasn't quite what I had expected. Looks warped compared to the sticker in the picture above. And was quite hard to put on. But it finally worked and looks okay.
B00EXKVYTY|4|Great product that works well and has my couch looking pristine in no time! But I found the product scent (leathery) to be strong. It will linger on the cloth and on the material for a bit so if you typically use something unscented due to sensitivity, I would use this sparingly. I am a little sensitive so I definitely kep the cloth sealed in the plastic bag it came in, and then another one on top of it.
B00KTJ0K1Q|4|One of the controllers works great,  the buttons on the second controller work sometimes.  Easy to change out the case.  Would order again.
B002SAGJP0|4|not to good quality
B00KJ4W3AC|2|They are after market.  One fell off the day after installation and plastic broke.  They are not  what I expected.
B00HVHN0D4|5|Fits perfectly!
B000OZS9Y0|5|Simple to install in my SxS and sure beats paying 2-3 Xs the money for other brands!
B000CI8XTK|5|I like it, It worked very good, no problems for replacement
B004BT6N8Y|1|Does NOT fit 2014 Acura RDX. The RDX arm is a u-hook design that takes a much larger diameter pin than the one on the Si-Tech wiper arms. Don't waste your time like I did.
B00HFX1Z8G|3|The tire sensor light is still on in my car don't know how to get it off
B00R2SF8O6|5|Very Happy with this product !
B001O045D8|5|Fast shipping  and no damage  works great  installed easy on 8-1-2015
B00D1CQVIY|5|Worked great and made installing my 30&#34; light bar on my SxS a simple process!
B00JREJ9WU|5|Dry, streak free vinyl and leather protectant! No greasy feel! I'm off Armor All for good!
B0015S7F2M|1|They didn't even fit my car.  I just threw them away and went to Auto Zone
B003LITBYY|4|Came super fast exactly what I expected and it's going to look so sweet on my Baja project.
B0009LPJ0Q|5|Great deal for rust treatment
B000CNAUI2|3|How is it possible that Edelbrock intake bolts, are too short to install an Edelbrock intake manifold? Not all, but half a dozen of them anyhow. Had to reinstall the old bolts, and 'that' $^!**(÷ me off!  Now I have a bunch of expensive, shiny unusable fasteners floating amongst the box of other orphaned fasteners from years gone by.
B004RCX770|3|Have to be very carful when pull with your truck
B0009JB7GI|5|honestly it is exactly what it says i have a charger a set of under dash lights and an fm transmitter and works great thanks
B001UC9GF2|5|Factory fit
B004J2MCAG|3|These strut kit seen fine although my springs were not seated properly.  Plus the struts are for the FE1 suspension only. The LS and LT1 have the FE1 turning suspension. The LT2 has the FE3 sport suspension. The SS/TC has the FE5 lowered stance suspension.
B00D3298A0|1|&#34;Ridged&#34; and &#34;Heavy duty&#34; are not terms I would use to describe these as. I have had these for exactly 6 months now, and they have already started to rip and separate at the ridges.<br /><br />I would spend the extra money to buy something that will last.
B0085IJIPC|5|This is a small cheap plastic fan. Kinda one of those things where if it doesn't fit then glue it on. It is exactly what it looks like. I bought it and it worked for me. Nothing else really to say. Haha.
B000CIR0AS|3|Look good, thread is fine but they come loose in a bag with the box label cut to be able to ship by a jiffy envelope.
B00VBK7GEG|5|Great prices on light bars !!!
B00JGP8I1S|1|i bought this thinking it was the one you see on TV, it isn't! not only that, but it doesn't fit on the visor properly. you can't lower the lens correctly as it doesn't fold back all the way, it locks in place at a certain point. also, after only a few uses, it cracked! I just threw it away, feeling like I really wasted my money. don't make the same mistake I did, don't bother buying this. it's junk.
B00JVHLS3G|5|Just what we needed -- perfect!
B006WQ7WQ6|5|This was a great product. I used it on my two door Chevy cobalt during a 1000 mile move. Of course it poured most of the way and when I got where I was going, but everything stayed dry and secure.
B00S6JMC1C|5|Got this for my buddy Mangina. Hilarious!
B005HMHVSA|4|Can really see how bright they are when looking through 20% tinted windows. Had trouble putting them on, but I mostly blame the car for that
B00TRCPUG6|5|Great lil cups &#34;For the price&#34; They will pull about 5-10 lbs and the rubber is fairly soft. Works well with &#34;Bumps&#34; not &#34;DENTS&#34;.<br />Apply suction and pulling power while lightly tapping on the surrounding edge area with a rubber mallet.
B00JMCCGF4|5|This is the only synthetic oil I use after extensive research.
B00SAAW8Y8|2|The wiring is sooo short that if you put lights anywhere but right next to your battery, you have to add more wire into the harness. I did lights on my rear bumper and I had to add about 20 feet of extra wire!!
B00068PSVW|1|DID NOT fit my 2003 Explorer like it said it would! NOT EVEN CLOSE!
B00OLP5KXM|5|very good value
B0072UPCFE|5|Outstanding set of steps!! Got these for my 2015 RAM 2500 4X4 with 6' 4&#34; bed. Bolted right up in the factory holes! The bed access step has been invaluable!!!!
B00167Y3ZO|5|After trying three off brands on my 325, these were a perfect fit.  No more streaks.  Nothing like the real thing.
B009IPE57W|1|will not connect to any air chuck I have or any I have ever seen pretty much useless
B000C36BHG|5|02 Tahoe main belt. Easy install with 15mm socket. Remove air intake (flat screwdriver or 5/16&#34; socket). Make sure all on pulleys and aligned, then done. Only 3rd belt after 250K, I don't expect to ever change again, but if I do, will most likely buy this one again. Nice quiet design.
B000CMHVG2|5|Works exactly as advertised, at a price cheaper than the local retailers. Perfect no-frills solution for a simple problem. Added &#34;nite-glow&#34; proved useful whilst hooking up your trailer in the dark, in addition to making sure that they wiring was in fact connecting properly after some encountering some sketchy Uhaul trailer wiring harnesses.
B002092DWC|5|Had one for 15 years and finaly wore out.
B00YDPBJNK|5|It was a very nice product. And delivered on time
B00IOU1BPQ|5|2015 silverado 5.3 with 4 inch lift and 35 inch tires. Got me 3 mpg better so far and sounds good!!! Takes less than 30 minutes to install
B001PVUJJU|5|Fits nice ... fairly easy to install.  Arrived on time!
B0058I3C40|4|On the fly it's great.. garage or basement heaters only.
B001G9B98G|5|great bags
B00SI9Q1QW|2|Did not fit my 2008 Buick Lacrosse at all. Was way too small and the back seat fitted seat cover wasn't even the right model type even though it said it was. And the covers for the front seat i ripped to make them fit. Didn't want to deal with the hassle to send them back.
B003LS2PW4|5|I received within a few days and fit my 2013 Sienna as advertised. I am always a bit skeptical on claims of increased power and fuel milage, but, after comparing this to the OEM filter I can see a lot less restrictive air flow so to me there will be less load on the engine. so far this seems to be a very good product.
B003BKVM8U|4|The light I like But, you have to put it to high up under the tail gate because the spare tire crank hole is there. And can not see the lights very good.
B00062YBIY|3|Not tight enough
B000JFN9WW|5|very nice
B0021YZER2|5|Used this on my badly stained glass shower doors. I had tried nearly everything, most with minimal success. An accumulation of hard water stains, soap , and, maybe lime looked pretty crummy.<br />I applied the DRIVEN cleaner with 0000 steel wool and applied some pressure, but nothing serious. Then, let it sit for a few minutes, washed it off with warm water, and dried the glass. there are still a few &#34;marks&#34;, but, no one is going to see them unless they use a microscope.<br /><br />BTW...wear gloves, wear goggles, when you rinse, try not to let the rinse water hit any surface that may be vulnerable. This is strong stuff...follow the directions exactly.
B00TYMQ8T2|5|Excellent
B00LPYYF56|5|I bought these towels after I decided that my family was creating too much waste by constantly using paper towels. Not to mention I was spending a small fortune on paper towels every month. I had read reviews about these towels being highly absorbent and good replacements for paper towels and I have to agree with that. It's been almost a year since we started using these towels and I'm still very pleased with them. We are a family of four with two children under the age of six and 50 of these towels work just fine. The only thing that I could see being an issue for some would be the fact that after a couple of washes some of the towels lost a lot of color. If different shades of blue don't bother you (it's not a big deal for me) then there really isn't anything wrong with these guys. I would totally get them again.
B00NMOYPVG|5|Excellent recovery machine.  Used it for the first time and had no problems quickly pulling the refrigerant from the system.
B00DP5L76S|5|We used these for our registration number on our new pontoon boat - the color matches perfectly and they look great - much nicer than most of the ones we see!  Each number and letter are separate, not on uniform rectangles, so it takes a little more work to line them up, but it was very worth the extra time.
B00B1VBQRS|5|This stuff works and you can tell by the seat of your pants and by the sound of the engine. Used in a 2001 Silverado 2500 with 150000 miles and made a huge difference also used in a 1983 john Deere 316 with an onan engine and the motor smoothed so much that I almost made it feel like a new tractor!!!
B0027Z6F3W|5|This thing is freaking amazing if you don't have one... It sux 2 B U!
B000BZ4ZZU|5|Well worth the additional money for my 94 jeep cherokee.
B004JNJPHI|5|I couldn't believe how much better your price was than local auto parts store...Terrific.  The only issue was the rubber grommet that holds one of the track arms in place.  It came loose and I had an unbelievable time trying to get it back together.  All in all, it went in and the part works great.<br />Would buy from Amazon again.<br />Thanks.
B001ECWMPY|3|The quick strut is nice because it includes a new spring, along with the strut, so you can update/upgrade both in one shot.  I think they ride well, but am disappointed at how much noise they make in cool/cold weather.  They squeak, which is incredibly annoying for a brand new strut.  I googled the cause and how to mitigate it, but haven't had any luck making the noise go away.
B00IZNZOYQ|5|Reviews with conflicting reports had me wondering if this would work on a 2014 Camry 2.5 motor. So, I took a chance and ordered one. I tried it and it WORKS. The slots on the wrench DO line up with the raised areas on the plastic canister. They only engage each other about 1/8 inch, but it is enough to give the added bite to loosen the canister (make sure you have the wrench up on the canister the whole way). Also, I read reviews about the wrench breaking in half, if they would have used a socket wrench with a 27mm or 1 1/16&#34; socket (like the directions say) I doubt that the wrench would have broken. DO NOT use the end of a 3/8 extension in the wrench as this will cause outward pressure from the hole and possibly break the aluminum cast wrench in half. I know its hard men, but in this case, follow the directions!!!
B00THR39SC|5|The price was awesome, so I expected mediocre quality at best.  I was wrong!  These flares fit perfect, very nice quality plastic material that can withstand minor impact, easy installation, couldn't ask for more!  Our rear fenders were significantly rusted with 3-4&#34; of rust going up and they still fit great!  The package even included extra attachment pieces to replace the ones that I broke during install!  I did drill a few additional holes through the flares in different spots to ensure they stayed on because of the rust on the top of my wheel wells.  Probably not needed because they seem to hold fine, but better safe then sorry for our upcoming Minnesota winter.  Wouldn't definitely recommend these and would buy again if needed for future vehicles, but made the truck look ALOT better!

B00CJUYIRU|4|I like the bumper and it looks very sturdy.  I bought this bumper to relocate my winch to a more serviceable location.  This should be a 5 star bumper, but I ran into two snags both involving the bolts.  First, when i received the bumper there were no bolts in the box.  I contacted Wild Boar through Amazon and they sent the bolts the next day.  Not a big deal, just a little quality control issue.  Second the square cutouts for the carriage bolts are sloppy at best.  I had one that was a pita but used a pry bar and a socket to hold it in place while tightening.  Next time this thing comes off I'm welding carriage bolt washers to it.  I've read that you need to modify the coolant hoses to get it to fit, my 2013 rzr 570 did not need modifying.  I also found that removing the headlights helped a lot.  I could see and reach bolts easier.  There is also a picture of two bolt heads already on the rzr frame that gave me a headache.  I had to loosen the u-bolts and nudge the back brace up a little to get over these bolt heads to get the back brace to seat fully.  My advise is to put everything together on the rzr with the bolts loose, it helps a lot.
B00SBZRELY|5|This is a good product.  My order was prompt and efficiently handled.  It arrived in a timely manner with no problems on my end.  It works great.  It is a good value for the reasonable price I paid.  Works great to use on my 5 gallon gas can when filling my pontoon. The gas tank cap is on the back of the pontoon.  I can easily set the 5 gal can on the deck of the pontoon, insert this pump and fill my pontoon tank. No mess to standing holding the can while the gas pumps. LOVE IT.  I would highly recommend this product.
B002NAQJQ4|5|Made the car look a lot better.
B000GTXZ5C|5|Battery fit perfectly.  Shipping was earlier than expected, and the box was sufficiently packaged.
B00335JT6U|1|They need a better  way to stick on there not good at all.....  an now  one of mine fell off.... Now I purchased  a second pair had that 1 on since Friday night  an now it's Monday an it fell off somewhere  I don't where...  I have spent  60$ can you guys make this right for me who do I need to talk too someone please  email  me back with  a solution ....
B001DZONCW|5|works great. fun to watch it do it's thing.
B005DIQGRU|5|Great price.  Much cheaper than dealer replacement and easy to install on my 2003 Dakota.
B003NDK7YK|5|One of the best looking recovery tanks on the market. Its all about looks. I ran all of the overflow lines in AN fittings and black braided hose to really dress up the system.  I could tell that the tank had been tested before shipping because of the antifreeze solution moisture. Just plain loved it.
B0016C3STQ|4|Little shaky the hole is back I think to far and seems not secure. Was thinking of drilling another hole closer to have receiver in more to hitch.
B0084AA2LK|3|I had a crack in my exhaust manifold of my 2001 Honda Civic. Didn't have money at the time for brand new manifold so I found this product.<br /><br />Long story short: within 2 weeks I bought 2 containers and kept having to reapply it. It was cracking, getting brittle, and then falling off. I'll admit my work was a little rushed but I always waited the initial 4 hours. I've read some reviews on here that say it's worked for other people for months, and others that say it didn't last, fell off, became brittle, just like what I experienced. I figured I must be doing something wrong, and decided to buy a 3rd container.<br /><br />Here's what I learned the third time that is IMPORTANT. Make sure you have a good batch!!! My first 2 containers had a huge difference in texture from my 3rd container. Must've been stored at some time in their life at a bad temperature. First 2 barely filled the container halfway, the liquid was not completely submerging the solid and to the side a little bit (must've evaporated or something), and the solid part was quite hard, even though I did get it to mix. When I opened the 3rd container it was filled all the way to the top, the solid was less hard, the liquid was completely covering the solid, and when I applied it I immediately noticed a difference. I left a picture of what it SHOULD look like after mixing. If it doesn't look like this, you have a bad batch. You could tell that it dried a lot faster and got harder faster too. I had more time to properly cure it for 24 hours and then let the engine idle for 15 minutes to finish it off. The stuff is rock solid now lasting me a long time. The instructions that came with it were a little unclear. I suggest to Google &#34;quiksteel instructions&#34; from the manufacturer and use those instead. A lot more clear.<br /><br />3 stars because it worked EVENTUALLY, but only after I went through 2 bad batches. The company should be able to transport it at all times to the store at a proper temperature and ensure the auto stores store it properly as well.
B0081KOQ7Y|5|I've been detailing cars for over ten years and used everything from Klasse, P21S, Menzerna, Wolfang, etc. etc etc. You name it, I've used it. This HD polish has become one of my favorites. I had never heard of 3D car care until a friend mentioned this stuff and now its my GO TO polish. I use a Flex 3401 and Lake County orange pad and it cleans, polishes, and shines the paint better than anything out there. The best part of this polish is that is leaves zero swirl marks no matter what pad you're using or how much pressure you are applying. No residue, no dust and it comes off easier than any polish out there. The removal is what sets this apart from the high end polishes.  Make multiple passes if your using an orbital or rotary and you'll be amazed. Can't say enough about all 3D products. I use them all. HD Poxy, HD Speed, HD Cut, and HD polish. Buy some, you wont' be disappointed.
B0009H51Y4|4|It's a filter!
B003Z9WMWC|3|Decent for the price.(comparing to my old Extang Trifecta).......On my 07 tundra crewmax with short bed, Tonno-Pro at the corners would not seal up; as others have mentioned.<br />-<br />An easy fix for that is to loosen the single screw at the cross support (with the latches, front and rear) that holds them to the side pieces/structure, and slide them forward (on front support) and back (on rear support), until latching seals the corners. Just a few inches made the difference on mine. Then simply put the self-tapping screw back into the side supports.(it easily taps right back in with a battery powered screwdriver, nothing fancy needed)<br />-<br />Second complaint is this top slaps VERY noisily on the support bows; when driving on the highway. I attribute this to the glossy finish in the underside of the vinyl top (Extang Trifecta is a softer, non-glossy finish--no slapping noise) this slapping noise on the Tonno-Pro can be minimized by applying some felt strips (or something similar) on top of the cross support bows, but under the vinyl. Buffering the slapping of the glossy underside of the vinyl top, and the smooth, shiny support bow tops.<br />-<br />The latches at the rear could only be adjusted minimally; as they are a composite plastic; that slide into the metal cross supports. Tightening the quick release latches on the rear too much, cause the composite pieces to actually try and pull away/out from the cross support. Not sure how long this design will holdup, as it's very concerning. And something I could not remedy. But it's fine after a few weeks of highway driving.<br />-<br />I will say; it appears Tonno-Pro copied the Extang Trifecta, and cut some corners. Most of the cut corners are acceptable; but these flaws I stated above could be easily corrected by Tonno-Pro at minimal cost, and this would be an excellent top; for the price! (My recommendation to Tonno-Pro is remedy the above issues and save the low-rent 'promotional' giveaways -cheap cotton gloves, cheap battery powered light, some spray cleaner)ves, cheap battery powered light, some spray cleaner)
B00ZLPABGC|4|Just what I needed ! Good value! Works good for my UTV and my Truck
B001UHQXQ2|5|Very good &#34;luber&#34; no more buying at local parts stores. This stuff really provides excellent lubrication. New favorite
B000EDSSDO|5|It worked just as I had hoped. Product was intact and in good working order. Thank You!
B00H18GPS0|4|Extremely bright and very straight forward installation. Very well priced. Works well on my 2006 Toyota Avalon<br /><br />Taking off a star because I ordered a pair of 5000k kit and one of the bulb seems to be closer to 6000k, but the customer service was awesome and quickly sent a replacement bulb. Takes about 10 to 15 seconds to heat up.
B00R666DTS|2|The decal I ordered was for an R1, not R6. I got an R6 decal. I installed it without the R6 decal.  I should have sent it back, but shipping is a s much as theis decal I guess
B00FFJCIV0|4|Shipment was received promptly. Product materials are quite sturdy upon inspection. Installation is straight forward. As soon as I received this cover, I trailered my Polaris RZR XP1000 at interstate speeds for over 1000 miles behind my motorhome. The cover stayed in place perfectly and never needed any adjustment enroute. Toward the end of the travel, a hole appeared in the back roll bar area where an aftermarket item had rubbed through the cover material. That's not a fault of the cover necessarily.  I was a little concerned when purchasing this cover that it might not fit with some of the aftermarket item I had installed. It would be reassuring if there were some comments from the manufacturer regarding fitment with aftermarket accessories. I also would like to suggest that the manufacturer add a zippered access point along the side areas so that the passenger compartment could be accessed once the cover is in place. Overall, very pleased with the product.
B00C3D013S|4|It's not a slim helmet, still has a slight mushroom look to it. Good fit. Visor is nice at higher speeds. Haven't tried to change out tinted/clear visit yet. Great product.
B00IQVY506|5|Excellent Seller.…Super Fast Fast Fast Shipping….Exactly As Advertised! 5 STARS!
B00FWOKKGI|3|Very affordable price, in good shape, very bright, arived quickly but when its on it makes a high pitched whining sound
B00COTOF1K|5|Great product!  Had a little issue with it when it arrived but customer service is tremendous!
B00UST2ZSI|2|The bow in the corner covered my tags. So I couldn't use it.
B00AR334B2|3|You'd better have small hands because these are somewhat small.  But if you can get them on, then it's fun to reenact.
B00NQVFM9O|5|Work well.
B009EZ77J4|5|the part fit right in and i got it fast thank you
B002NAQPEK|5|Great deal
B00XCLLHCY|5|I repurpose items to create new pieces and have a lot of dismantling to do.  This tool works well for me. I have been looking for tools to make the job easier and prevent destruction of the older item while taking it apart. This tool helps, works well. Fits well in my hand, is strong enough to ply things apart. I was happy when asked to give my opinion in exchange for this product since it makes my job better. It works well.
B003YLIHT8|5|Great price.  Worked like a charm to fix blower motor.
B0006IX87S|1|Junk! It lets water thought for a short time then clogs and you can't get pressure through the filter. I tried it twice on two different water systems and it wouldn't work.
B00NTU18KY|5|I got this to check USB powered things I use with my solar panels while camping. I drove myself nuts checking things with it. It is a pretty impressive tool. It made managing power in an off grid situation very easy.
B00BMRZN66|5|This is our second pump. It makes fueling ATV's easy with no spillage. Just be aware that the pump cannot take a lot of bouncing and abuse. Our first one shorted out after several trips in the ATV Wagon and the closed assembly housing would not allow us to repair it. I have recommended this product to many of my friend and several have purchased one. It makes our women only ATV trip each year more enjoyable because we don't have to lift up those heavy 5-gallon fuel cans. Also, fueling the jeep in the back country is just like pulling up to a gas pump in town.
B00BZCB8UI|1|This is dangerous.<br /><br />These come without any special instructions whatsoever, so I installed them like I would any other front reservoirs.<br /><br />Big mistake. Apparently these units require a more thermaly stable brake fluid than my OEM DOT4. The thermal expansion of the brake fluid caused my front brake to lock up on the road and nearly caused an accident. (The expansion was actually enough to break the circlip and shoot the reservoir onto the sidewalk 10ft away, marring the finish).<br /><br />Without proper instructions and given the stated &#34;direct fitment, no modification required&#34;, the use of this product is hazardous, making the rider a danger to themself, as well as others on the road.
B0016I3RNM|5|Difficult to put in with bed rails already installed in a 2013 Tundra. Must cut to fit. I would recommend it though. Very pleased with it!
B00O65ET1Q|5|Used in my 6.0 powerstroke and was amazed at the change. I put it directly in my fuel bowl after I changed my filter. Straight shot to the injectors and my truck seems to run better in my opinion.
B00C5TRSSG|5|Very cute giraffe sticker! I love the way it looks and it was very easy to apply even without directions. :) I will update this when it starts to peel-- I think it will last a fairly long amount of time... but if it is supposed to remove easily when I want it to, it probably will start to peel even when I don't want it to.
B000C919EU|3|Didn't need it, but I was not sure.
B006TMKKMG|5|Fits very well
B00DOS0LH2|5|I can't even begin to describe how much easier this is than a traditional clay bar. It's exactly the same as when you wash your car, only your washing your car with a giant clay bar! It only took me about 10 minutes to restore smoothness to my cars paint, rather than 2 hours. I have used this product 3 times since i bought it a year ago, and it is still holding up very well! I would highly recommend this to the beginner, or advanced detailer!
B000W0OFXG|5|Exactly what I wanted.  Very easy to use (I threw away the instructions...cuz I'm a guy!).  Very fluid, accurate number dial.<br /><br />When I have my package hooked up, it is difficult to access the number dial...I don't see any way around that so I give it 5 stars anyway!!!
B001TYGLXQ|4|look ok but is not real durable.  A hole on edge of driver seat after one year
B007RVQZUY|5|Worked like a charm- got our van door back in workin order. Easy to install.
B0063MHY9Y|3|Lenses keep cracking but good fit
B0059XCVVO|1|Very loose adhesive. Came off and rolled up, ends up everywhere except the vinyl! Installed anyway, it looked good after install but has since bubbled up and wrinkled. Looks awful AND removal is an adhesive mess. Only goo gone works. There is far better quality out there at this price point.
B00MIDVUNI|4|Looks and fits perfectly, I gave it four stars because the box stated &#34;Made In China&#34;.
B00HL1X288|5|I liked this set of mini screw driver's so much I ordered two of them.
B0031BU53W|1|It did not fit.
B00VDM3XNU|5|Okay.  It's a bumper/window sticker.  It adheres well and I love the message.  What's not to like?
B00KTJ7IGQ|5|It works great.
B008HZKHIA|1|Item arrived in box, brand new,BUT, found this item is for 2006 Accent 4 door, not 2 door hatchback. So was off to the auto parts store for proper part after Accent was aleady completely taken apart....grrrrrrrr.<br />When ordering, the system did not allow selection for one to the other. This needs to be addressed.<br />I now have to try to sell this item on Craigslist.
B00EE259BA|5|Great item! the key worked on my 2005 Dodge Magnum with no problem. You just take the insides of your old key, put it in the new one, take both your keys to Lowe's and have it cut. I think Dodge wants about $120 per key!
B0045L8YN0|5|20,500 miles later, chain is doing great and sprockets pretty good. Cleanest way to go, will never go back to the thin liquid types
B00480GY0S|4|very good sturdy light bulb
B00N38FIDA|5|I am extremely satisfied with these vinyls. Very easy to install if you take your time. Total install time was approximately 3 hours on my 2009 Dodge Charger. Many mixed comments from people that range from cool to dumb to I thought it was a cop car! Nice addition to any vehicle. Delivered in a timely fashion as well
B00JJ66B9A|5|delivered on time at a great price, looks great on the new black wheels on the Jeep!
B001CF3N9M|4|I already have a set of excellent seat covers by Covercraft on my Jeep. If I'd bought the Smittybilt G.E.A.R. covers for use as a seat cover only I'd be very disappointed. They don't make great seat covers. They do cover up the middle portion of the seats but don't fit tightly. I bought them because I liked the way they look and for the additional storage.<br /><br />I've had stuff scattered about my 2005 Jeep Wrangler's interior and was looking to organize things better. Now I have a place to put my assorted stuff ranging from my reading and sunglasses, flashlight, tools, towels, my extra hat and suntan lotion, etc, etc. Plus it all looks cool in the bags on the rear of the seat. I'm just hoping no one steals them but I guess that's the risk you run with anything when you own a Jeep and why I have a low deductible on my insurance policy.<br /><br />These seats are supposedly designated for a Jeep. They say JEEP G.E.A.R. seats so I woudn't call them &#34;universal&#34; but I don't know specifically WHAT Jeep it's made for. It's not specifically for a 2003-06 TJ though. I got it to fit and look good in spite of the fact that it's a bit &#34;off&#34; in spots.<br /><br />For example, they have this velco strap that goes over the headrest. Good idea but why didn't they make it longer? Just another 6&#34; of material would've made it useable. They even say that for higher backed seats you can &#34;tuck it in&#34; but it won't fit nearly as well. Fortunately I had a strap of nylon with velcro ends and was able to put one end around the loop and attach it to the back end of the headrest so it almost looks as if it's made for it.<br /><br />The strap underneath has the cover is supposed to loop through the seat and back and attach to a velcro patch on the back of the cover. I wouldn't have been able to use this because I put this G.E.A.R cover over my Covercraft seat cover and wasn't willing to cut into my cover to slot the strap under the seatback.. but even so, the strap was way too far forward and too short to do what it was supposed to do, so I don't know what Jeep seat this was made for. Smaller ones I guess.<br /><br />As far as installation went, it wasn't that bad. The trick is to get the cover lined up on the seatback first. The straps can be adjusted both in front and back so you can position the loop where you want it and tighten both ends. It actually worked quite well. I made it so the cover was tight. It doesn't contour to the seat back so if you are looking for a custom fit, forget it. It just sort of hangs there.<br /><br />Once I got the seatback cover adjusted I was able to tie down the lower seat cover easily enough. The trick is to figure out where the bungees go. The bungees are pretty poor quality. One of the hooks broke off immediately but fortunately I have a series of small bungee straps that I was able to attach to the piece of the hook that was still attached and managed to connect everything tightly. Everything seems to work and fit pretty well, I'm just how well those bungee hooks will hold up. I figure if I have to replace with my own bungee hooks I will.<br /><br />The seat material and bags are nice quality though. They match the black parts of my Jeep perfectly. The bags attach easily enough to the back as well as to the front and sides of the seats. There are 7 different sized bags. One bag is a bit bizarre in that it opens to the side..why didn't they just have it open on top? I just stuffed my towels in that one. The others are pretty functional. I have yet to fill them all.<br /><br />All in all, I'm pretty pleased with it. I don't know how well it will hold up over time. The cover is a bit looser than I'd like on the lower seat and I'm wondering how long those bungee hooks will last. $100 is a bit steep for one seat cover. I think for the price and quality of this cover you should at least get 2 covers.<br /><br />If you are looking for a seat cover that fits like a glove and for protection I'd look elsewhere. If you want something that will provide extra storage and add a bit of style to your Jeep then I'd recommend the Smittybilt G.E.A.R. seat cover.ook elsewhere. If you want something that will provide extra storage and add a bit of style to your Jeep then I'd recommend the Smittybilt G.E.A.R. seat cover.
B00J0EBZUQ|3|Had to return my first set due to bad inspection by inspector 11. Second set was on the money. Great fit and looks good.
B000KIP53O|3|The cover fits well and seems to be well made but it does not have the CR-V logo on it. It is blank as pictured, not with a logo as described in other reviews.
B00SVSD6TK|4|My third hitch cover and the first one that wont fall off. So good that it is actually difficult to remove.
B0012Q4IPY|4|It's the first time to replace spark plugs by myself.  After watching youtube videos, it was easy to install the new spark plugs in my 08' Toyota Camry Hybrid, which had 125,000 miles on it. I tested starting the engine right away without problems after the install.  Haven't noticed any changes in MPG. took one star off because one of the spark plug tip looked not well aligned by visual inspection, and I didn't know how significant this was so I went ahead with the installation.  didn't measure the gaps.
B000HTAH70|5|Perfect well manufactured, precision machining and MADE IN USA
B00A83R0AM|5|Answering for my husband - just what was needed.
B00F0VMMSW|5|great set, great price.
B00AYKR8V0|5|It match  wonderful to my 04 civic color and fit great . No one believe me the bumper already painted but after they see it wow that it awesome. am look forward to the seller.
B000EB42ZY|5|Came with everything needed to install including a good wiring diagram that is easy to follow.
B00027GZ3C|5|Nice water pump kit, I use Sierra parts quite often
B001KQD7YE|5|Worked as expected
B004RH7YGU|5|Works great on my Car.best product,best quality.
B000CPCBEQ|5|if you have a sticky syncro in your FJ Cruiser this may fix it.It did for me worth a shot.
B000IYNVLI|4|This part worked fine when my husband installed it, it's inexpensive and meets all the specs for the Toyota. If I have any problems with it, I'll come back and change my review.
B00KTIR3DU|3|unlike the ones I bought for my explorer that came with instructions and I programed myself these I had to take to G M and pay 20.00. it was still worth it to have working kwy bobs
B0049DYVVS|5|02 Tahoe windshield wiper tubing. My California wipers are finally moist and working again after 10 years. I installed a year ago, so I can't remember if I had to modify one of the tubes, or re-use one of the rubber connectors, but it all worked out perfect ..enough.
B009GOAIDU|5|SECOND SET OF THESE AND LOST THE EMBLEMS ON BOTH PAIRS. DO NOT BUY YOU HAVEW BEEN WARNED!
B0027HYW12|5|Worked perfectly as needed.  Would buy again without hesitation.
B001DAEF02|5|Great hubs.  A buddy helped me put both fronts on in about an hour (GM mechanic).  Good quality.  Solved my noisy front end.
B000QS2XQK|5|This is well worth the money.  Simple to use, directions are on the inside of the case lid, and they give you a Duracell battery!<br />You can literally oped it up, install the battery and use it! Its that simple.  Very well made.
B001EAQTRI|5|Alternator noise eliminated!  Used some double-sided tape to hide this away in my center console, near the car's AUX port.<br />Prior to this, I found that plugging my music player into an AC USB charger connected to a AC inverter also got rid of the DC noise, but that was kind of silly.  Works great with the SoundBot SB360 Bluetooth 4.0 Car Kit.
B00NAK8R52|5|Excellent. .
B00LDR9L22|1|I purchased these headlights and since day one I have had trouble with then I would not recommend these to anyone
B000KYXD46|5|It works well and we are so happy with pir new key.
B0049WNGLU|5|Lots cheaper than factory well built , stops good no noise
B000GJC2J2|5|well made quality product
B006NOFN2W|4|Arrived on time and met all expectations.
B0066SU27Q|5|god
B0052FRMYK|5|Quick delivery - got a friend to install them. Didn't even take long - auto shops wanted to charge me $150/handle for parts & labor. Need to replace all 8 handles - would've cost me $1,200 - instead bought these and a set of inside handles & got a friend to do the labor. I saved $1,150
B006ACYXTQ|4|Good fit and just what I needed
B00D4522AY|3|This battery was different than the one that was in my 01 BMW 325CI key. I was able to get it to work, but only after tearing up the original battery to use it's connector pieces. Ended up not being my problem either, but stuck with it since I tore my other up.
B00B51AXZ0|2|Very fast delivery, although it is not the same plum-ish color, in the picture, in real life. I'm disappointed.
B00NB7TCLW|5|Super neat
B00EBQRKIY|5|Looks great, material quality is pretty good. I have owned this for about 6 months and paint has not peeled or faded.
B000FQBWCY|5|Great product.
B00QTESRCY|5|They installed easily and fit perfectly
B000C9SRD6|5|This is the twist on type not the push in and turn one turn deal. works great.
B000CM2VDA|5|Fit my Pontiac and I can now see what's behind me. In short it works!
B00XAX4B9A|5|I absolutely loved my windshield sunshades! I use it all the time esp now that's it's summer. It's very effective in keeping the sun heat out and protecting my interior esp since my car has a lot of electronics. I definitely recommend this product. It's worth the price and excellent quality!
B00E9IEUTG|5|Great price, fast shipping excellent in every way
B000FPXS0Y|5|Recent truck purchase had train horns installed but the pump was inoperable. This pump is a direct replacement for the old one. Works like a charm, am very impressed.
B0045XRK06|4|Best, brightest, energy saving USB light out there! They are easy to plug on to your laptop and they come on immediately. I have a laptop without backlit for the keyboard and it is definitely an issue if I have to work in the dark. These lights are easy to carry along in your bag when traveling and serve multiple purposes. I have used them in dark areas with my portable battery pack (for my phone) with a usb connector and they have worked just fine! As the consume very less power they hardly drained my battery pack! Absolutely worth the purchase!  Please comment with any questions you may have that I can help with.
B00A8MZ2ZS|5|Use 1 towel for my truck.
B00A5UEOLG|5|Thought was a little exspensive...but now that I have it its worth every penny
B0086TAWQY|4|was what i needed and fast shipping
B009P9DHGQ|1|Blah
B0009IQXJ0|5|Great smell, easy to apply, stays on tire for weeks.
B00TEA5PZC|4|Great item, just as described. Thin frame, screws and screw covers are included. Don't worry about rust because it is stainless! 4 stars because the screw covers did not fit properly, they are only half way on.
B004R35M8Q|5|installed in about half an hr  everything lined up as it was supposed to . I was trying to decide on a brand and knew draw-tite was a good one .. very happy with product .. I was a mechanic for a while so i have decent knowledge of vehicles but it was so easy anyone can do it themselves . cheapest place i found to install on my 2014 equinox was 420 dollars ( parts and labor ) but for 140 dollars and half hr work i completed it myself . would recomend having anouther set of hands if you are installing it on the ground as most of us have to .
B007V2BEO6|5|Amazing fit my 2008 Passat like a glove.
B001OZS9I0|4|very good reliable shock absorbers
B00NGOS5MW|4|Fits perfectly!
B00KTJ4RUG|1|Would not program remote.  Followed directions exactly and remote would not program.  It my sons car so I don't have access to it all the time to call customer service and for the amount paid its not worth shipping it back.
B00801RJPK|5|Just like the other one...it fit!
B0018F1DNE|5|I put a set of these on my FXDC<br />Great fit & sound plus they look good!
B00IUWLZMW|5|This batterry fit perfectly into my 2003 Honda Blackbird. The LCD display is new to me, looks good. The battery arrived promptly and in perfect condition. It was charged 100% and ready to use !  Thank You
B000F10QCQ|5|It fits fine, all the holes line up.
B0027XEKQ8|5|This item has met my expectations. I do believe a good solid base preparation is the secret to a successful installation. The lid has held up good so far, and no issues have presented them selves. By the way if you do lose the handle screw it's an 8mm/42 threads(?) and 1/2 inch long screw.
B000OQ3Y62|5|He met and exceeded my expectations!
B00VNBDOV2|5|I have both the Hi-Beam and Lo-Beam for my 99 S10 and words can not describe the difference in night road driving.  I'm lighting hanging highway signs up from a 1/4 mile away with low beams where before I could barely see a speed limit sign from across a big intersection.  I used to have my lights 'overtaken' by every single car that passed me, since I've installed these I haven't seen a light brighter yet.  The color tint is just barely blue, its not the typical HID blue, it's definitely not an obnoxious light except for simply how bright the beams are.<br /><br />I even had a small accident after installing and the bulbs survived a destroyed headlamp assembly, I'm not saying their indestructible, I'm simply saying they aren't flimsy in the slightest.<br /><br />The only downfall is I did have to reverse the polarity to my headlights due to chevy wiring my lights backwards but I read this was the case with my truck and the 1500 series from GM before I bought the bulbs.  With a little cut and solder I put them in no problem.<br /><br />EDIT: I've finally remembered to post pictures.  The first is a view of the old Silverstar bulbs, the 2nd is after 1 lo beam installed, and the 3rd is after both lo beams installed.<br /><br />A few weeks after purchasing the lo beams for my truck (s10) I bought the hi beams and did a modification to have both lo and hi beams on at once with the hi beams activated.  It is simply daylight in front of my truck at night, words cannot describe how far i can see or how clear the road is in front of me.  I honestly feel bad for anyone when i forget to turn off my hi-beams while driving.  I also installed a euro style crystal clear assembly to replace the OEM assembly for my truck this made a big difference, and was done prior to purchasing and installing the lo beams. I have not come across a single vehicle that has brighter lights than mine without the use of multiple light bars.
B00D0X1MUQ|5|Just as good as the 200.00 name brands
B001EP0GOK|3|mounted to a traverse.  rubs and rattles on muffler which is really anoying.  mounting is not easy but holes all lined up and fit fine. said it was to fit my traverse but there is no clearance by the muffler.  still trying to figure out how to reposition so it will not wear a hole in the muffler.  other than that seems to be good quality.
B00TF2BZBW|5|The label on the back of the battery has, as part of its warnings, a suggestion that the battery pack only be used on engines with less than a 2.5 liter capacity.  Since I was testing this as a typical American consumer, I completely ignored the warning label and attached the battery to a 4.6 liter, gasoline powered V8 engine with the positive battery cable disconnected from the battery.  Prior to doing so, I test started the engine, and the engine used was well tuned and normally starts and performs very well.  The Brightech battery backup had a little difficulty at first, but eventually turned over and started the engine.  Overall, it only took a few seconds longer to start the engine with the Brightech battery backup than it took the battery actually powering the vehicle.  Now, remember, this was an engine that was nearly twice as large as the recommended maximum engine size for this battery.  So, if it can handily start a vehicle way out of its pay grade, it should have no problem starting any four cylinder engine, and nearly all six cylinder engines.<br /> The device itself is incredibly compact, very light, and would easily store in even a small glove compartment.  The battery pack has a car charger to recharge the battery, but does not come with a 110V alternate charger.  The battery pack does have one incredible plus, which is you can keep the battery on a charger indefinitely without risking overcharging the battery.<br /> If you have a vehicle with less than a V8 engine, this would be a good backup charger for you.  Don’t worry about the small size–I could get into the technical reasons why a battery this small can start a very large engine, but I would probably bore you to death.  Because it uses a high capacity discharge with very small jumper cables, you need to have a very, very solid electrical connection for the battery pack to work.  The upside is that it is possible and this device does it and does it well.<br /><br />I was provided a sample product in exchange for an honest review.  My husband wrote this one, and he was quite happy to test this one and keep it in the car.oduct in exchange for an honest review.  My husband wrote this one, and he was quite happy to test this one and keep it in the car.
B00KS1KVW8|5|Nice ! stays on at highway speeds protects against bugs-etc.
B0078UBMZM|5|Fast shipping of a great product. Installation is a breeze, and you can't get better traction than having a locker. This unit corners well without being too noisy. I would recommend this to anyone looking to improve on and off road traction!
B0013M05O0|5|Bigger and heavier than I thought it would be. It's perfect for my house.
B00E9HWPMG|5|Easy to cut to size.you need good scissors though.
B008N2JIRS|5|is OEM part, same as came from factory
B0006H938M|5|Nice toilet for thee price. I use it in my house for a low flow toilet
B00WEVB8F4|5|Worked Great!
B000GROI2I|5|Great for storage on my 2015 Spyder F3.  Easily fits on passenger seat.
B00H3TMIT2|5|As advertised.  You just need to be careful in installation
B001KNS8ZA|4|a bit larger than the original but works great
B000IYPQXO|4|My girlfriend's radiator has a small crack in it and was spraying coolant all over. We ordered this and had it out in at a local shop and it fit perfect! DEFINITELY recommend this!
B00D9C2CDO|4|Bought this for our vacation and it worked great. It rained on our way home, yet everything stayed dry. Key is to make sure those flaps are down and secure! It didn't shift at all, and once we understood that we have to tuck the ends of the straps under the bag, made little noise! Easy to pack up and store too!
B007TG7HGI|5|Literally a snap.
B00480GYSA|1|Not impressed,  would not buy again & would not recommend.
B002RNFP3A|1|I do not understand the positive reviews for this product. After using it several times to buff out very light scratches only to have them reappear, I gave up. The 3M Rubbing Compound does do a reasonable job of mostly eliminating slight imperfection or damage to your car's finish
B00D46P06G|5|Couldnt do without this
B0000AXQPA|5|This stereo mount will work well for you, it worked just as I wanted it to
B00OGS3RGG|3|Did not fit
B00UVYS1B0|2|I purchased 2 of these for a 2006 Mazda 5. I took them to a locksmith that specializes in automotive. He cut both keys and programmed both keys to start the car. Unfortunately, after several hours and several attempts, we could not get either remote to lock or unlock the vehicle.
B00Q3MFQXA|3|I bought this thinking it would give scratch-resistance to an acrylic ball. It didn't. It wasn't made for acrylic.
B004AQVH8E|5|Works great every time I need it and I would recommend it
B00YJL8DDW|5|Struts were as advertised and shipping was quick.
B00CLMBE5A|5|It fit perfectly on the 2015 Forester. I bought a step drill as recommended by other reviews. After removing the heat shield, I noticed factory dimples for drilling that matched the hitch mount holes, so I used the step on those and put the shield right back in. I left one heat shield screw out and sandwiched it between the hitch and the frame. Used it with a bike rack so far, worked perfectly. It looks good, does not hang to low, and is recessed so you won't hit your shins on it unloading items from the back.
B00CXAGCC0|5|It's black and it's made of plastic, and it was a perfect fit to replace the one that broke off.  Just line up the tabs and insert it.  Ta-da!
B001GRSOK4|5|the best
B0006GF5SK|1|I bought these to put in my RV toilet tank, and they smell HORRIBLE.  You know that nasty chemical stench that hits you as soon as you walk into a porta-potty on a hot day?  That's what your RV will smell like.  Even with the bathroom door closed and the fan on, I can still smell them on the other side of our 30-foot RV.  To make matters worse, when I went to flush the tank after a couple days, the Porta-Pak hadn't done anything to break down the solids.  Even though we use special RV/Marine toilet paper, we had an awful time draining the tank.  The next day, (after adding another stench ridden Porta-Pak) the toilet completely backed up and we ended up having to use a stick to clear the clog.<br /><br />-Horrible, Useless, SMELLY, Awful.
B00DT8D3TK|5|Nice bars, be sure to order the right size as they are too expense to pay for shipping if needing to send them back (I ordered the wrong size).
B00QMVKIEO|5|Lot of material to over lap the surface  Found that cutting away the top first allows you to remove and realign before cutting the opposite side.  Good coverage. I had precut decals  This much better.
B001PNCNRE|5|This sensor replaced the primary O2 sensor on a 1999 Honda Prelude (Base model).  No more CEL.  The sensor comes with an appropriate amount of anti-seize on the threads.  Apply some PB Blaster to the old sensor to make removal easier.  The sensor also comes with two new mounting clips; however, I found it easier to leave the old clips in the body and reuse them rather than mounting the new clips.
B000IM0E6K|5|Bought it for my 2008 Ford Crown Victoria. Works awesome, looks great. Plenty of storage, and the lock, although flimsy, is a good deterrent (which is all a lock really is in the first place).
B00F8LEB9W|1|Both quit working within 90 days. Tried reprogramming, then new batteries....no luck.  Buy something else...
B001P2BNNU|5|Looked Great on my Mustang. I was hesitant because my car is all black but the chrome plate frames meshed too well with the car. And the frames are heavy. No plastic sh**.
B0081ZZXTY|5|Perfect size! Use for my mixed fuel
B0059QMF6C|5|High quality charm.  It is better than I expected.
B000JZZA2Y|5|sounds great and perfect fit
B00FF1K7BQ|4|Buy one or the other as the &#34;New Car Scent&#34; really has a lot of the leather scent in it already.  I bought the combo pack thinking I would use them to get the new car smell back in my vehicles.  However, after using the New Car scent first, I realized that the leather scent already came through with that scent.<br /><br />The leather scent does smell like leather and definitely has more of a leather smell than the new car.<br /><br />The scents appear to last for about a week or so before they start to wane.  I only use a quick spray on the floor of each seat since they have a very strong smell and that works best for me.<br /><br />I would recommend just getting the new car smell if that's what you want or just getting the leather smell, if that's the scent you're after.  Using both scents at the same time, IMO, is just too strong of a scent to have in an enclosed space, such as a vehicle.<br /><br />BTW, the photo shows that a sprayer comes with each bottle with the combo pack.  That is not the case... I only received one sprayer.  I did reach out to Amazon customer service and they promptly sent me a replacement order, but alas, that order also came with only one sprayer.  Just a minor issue but I thought it was worth mentioning.
B000O0I10W|5|Replaced the one that was missing, works as expected.
B002MQDY4O|5|Got the parts quickly,they fit perfectly and were reasonable, was able to get the car repaired. Love Amazon
B00BCRMBSO|5|Bought for the wife's car and it was easy to install.
B005CKFYEU|5|Yup fits perfectly on my new FIat 500e. During the day it protects from car getting heated up and at night time it protects me while charging late at night as the orange indicators is asking for trouble when charging.
B00GNBHO4U|5|Fit perfectly, easy to install, work great
B00UEZGREY|5|purchased for my daughter. she loves it!
B006QJG3AA|5|Works great on the class on my fireplace door.
B000BYB5A4|5|Great addition to my combustion<br /> chamber during tune-up phase of operations,<br /> will go with Volvo brand next time.
B00BITK1CY|3|Got for a friends car dit perfectly
B001P2HWC6|5|it can be a bit rickity when extended out far but so far so good. I use several bungies and it works great.
B008KM81E2|5|This wax works the best in holding up to the Florida heat. Better coverage wax in less time.
B007HRJNIE|5|Reduces noise significantly.
B000E4VGSC|4|It s a good one, I do appreciate this very product.
B00802GIW4|5|Easy install and works great
B0064SGRPE|1|Does not fit 2015 at all.....
B00AQG7WW2|5|Nice a bright! installed on the rear of my VStar 6550 (front and rear) - got 'em all working and my son sold it and left me with a Honda VT1100 Shadow Spirit - Now I've got to start over again on the lights. All kidding aside, these are great lights.
B00VB2OKG6|1|I bought this and ordered the size the description said to for a tahoe and it does not fit..
B00PND236S|1|Find a better light bar after three months mine started getting water in it. Now most of the lights don't work. I would highly not recommend paying for this light bar
B00FPFICIW|4|So far, so good. Had to return 2 of 14 I purchased due to flickering. New technology, to be expected. No problem at all on the exchange.
B0009IQZH0|5|Using these is a great and simple way to bring the shine back to your car. From experience, drying/buffing your car with these results in a shine that competes with some waxes on the market. Very absorbent for their size. The only downside I've found is that they are difficult to wash, so if you use these to do anything other than buff out the body of the car (for example: polish rims). you might not be able to get the grime off them very easily. This isn't a fault of this product in particular obviously, but just a forewarning. Great product, will definitely buy again.
B008A5GRHM|5|This product works great
B002UC15UU|5|Just what I needed for my second battery.
B002GJQ1ZG|5|Nice patches
B0082OYG3I|4|Perfect hanger for my luck gremlin on my Harley Davidson Sportster XL883L.
B00496MBFS|5|It's an oil filter ... and it filtered oil.
B00F7NEREU|2|What I received doesn't look like the picture posted here. One side is smaller than the other and is has broken the beading. I will need to buy another but a different brand than this.
B00BD4SKY0|4|honestly i was kinda upset when the blue was not as bright as shown but for the price i can complain
B003S5TBP4|1|I installed this part, It worked for two months and the gear inside the motor broke causing the window not to work. I returned it. Buy something better quality. I am taking my truck to a professional glass place and get a regulator with better quality.
B00GSAUHB8|5|A great value! It is true quality and is extremely easy to put up and take down. I recommend this to anyone who is in the market for a window sunshade.
B00BPGGSCW|5|This stuff is amazing. Eats through brake dust on wheels and also worked wonders on a greasy bike chain. Easy on skin and changes purple when it's working. Foams up nicely when agitated with brush as well. I'm reordering the gallon size soon.
B005P9YYO4|4|Very nice and doesn't call attention to itself.
B00BTLII9O|4|Be sure to watch the YouTube videos before you begin, they're really helpful! Took me forever to install... But I LOVE THEM!!! My backseat head rest do not come off so the backrest part of the bench cover is not as tightly secure as I'd like it to be, but it still looks good:) be sure to read the labels on the two separate pieces for bench, one notes that it is for the back rest and one is for the seat. I didn't realize it until I got it completely on... Also it comes with metal clips, those are in a small baggy attached to one of the bucket seat covers, you'll need to locate those to begin...
B00U0NSI6A|2|Almost lasted  29 days it died after performing perfectly
B0079R89Z0|1|It was not the correct part.  So had to return it.  And I lost 17.00 dollars on shipping charges. Very disappointed.  Will not order ever again
B001AIZ5HY|5|Works great, no more fogged up headlights!
B001F7CFPU|4|Installed this on my 2006 Subaru Forester as a best guess to try and fix OBD code P0420 and it worked!  Since the original O2 sensor made it to 180,000 miles, I can't complain.  This sensor did not have anti-seize installed or with a packet and the packaging was pretty beat up, but it went in without a hitch and the connector matched exactly.  Been 500 miles and no code yet so all is well.  Had a hell of a time getting the old one off until I bought this:  [[ASIN:B00QL3QJA0 ABN 3 Piece 3/8&#34; Drive Oxygen Sensor Wrench Socket Set]]
B00L32LWJM|4|Fits great. Easy to install, but there is a little space for water to make it through in a down pour and while on the highway you can see it flap in the front of the bed a little. However the little rain I've had hasnt made me not like this product. Definetly will order again for my next truck.
B0020K0DJG|5|quality backing plate.
B004AQS7GE|5|Very good
B001BK062K|5|Great value
B00SFYVDMW|2|e price was affordable and much cheaper than Autozone or Advance Auto . I ordered from the comfort of my cell phone sitting in parking lot waiting for my wife to shop on a sunday and recieved it surprisingly  on Tuesday. Installed and has been producing power running my electrical system in Vehicle exceedingly .
B000GTMIYG|5|Great tool
B004OI7H7S|3|Seems like a quality product, just be aware the pot life is very short. I mixed it in half batches and rolled/brushed it on and really wish I went in 3rds. Wasted a lot of product, and I was really hustling to get it rolled on.<br /><br />Bottom line, spray it or roll it and move FAST.
B000A3I7IY|4|This has made a big difference with my &#34;getting older/bony backside&#34;, and has extended the comfort level for longer paddles. I should have gotten one years ago.
B001GRTIKE|5|Fits like a glove,amazing!!one thing though wish that the product was a little thicker other than that it is worth the money.
B003LNJWTI|1|They suck, my 1998 mustang factory headlight bulb is way brighter then this. I recommend buying different ones,  probably if there $30 &' above they might be better but this light bulbs suck ass!
B00B7WYIIK|2|Bad fit bad quality.  Pitman arm went out within 3 months. Idler arm was the wrong style for my truck even though it was listed and said to fit.
B00G620ZVU|3|Not nearly as bright as I was expecting. I have them in place of fog lights in my F150 and they look good but don't throw much light. The hardware has started to rust as well after about 6 months on the truck. You get what you pay for.
B000XJRYQ6|3|It's ok.
B00P0EJV0G|3|The seatcovers dont quite fit. Plus the strings are so cheap and flimsy they break easily. For the money i paid i expected more. Overall good HK design
B00W919GLM|4|We have a large tent trailer that made my old Tahoe bounce and sway, this hitch completely stopped that and made it<br />much nicer to pull at highway speeds.  The set up was pretty straight foreword but you need some big tools.
B00IVKYOE4|5|I laughed so hard seeing this I had to have it on my truck. Very high quality comes with the applicator sheet so all you do is press it on an peel away the top sheet. Couldn't be easier... looks fantastic on the rear window of my truck.
B00D3298A0|5|High quality car mats. Look great and fit great in my car too. Recommend buying these!
B000OF42NC|5|Works good perfect for dialing in bell housing.
B00F5MUB66|4|Perfect for my needs.  I am using it inside my toy hauler camping trailer.
B004QJP9JI|1|Tried TWICE with this product. TWICE I only got one filter in a box of two. Had to go to different brand.
B00KZJQ2L2|5|Finally found a shade that covers the entire windshield for my 2015 Dodge Grand Caravan, its light weight, folds into a small bundle that is easy to store in its sleeve that comes with the shade.
B0019I4KAS|5|MUCH better that oem - quiet, dust free and a perfect fit!
B00JRXKOKW|5|Excellent
B004T39YX8|5|It works great don't need it every time buts it's nice to know you can use it when needed every plane seems different with the seat belts so you never know!
B00HX2M7BS|5|Looks great,  I will buy this brand again,  price is very good
B00KBLFIP0|3|For the price they are good gloves. They don't holdup very long and start to fray quickly. There is also no padding in the palm area of the glove, so for riding a sport bike its not the greatest.
B0016HY24G|5|Received the part on time, The part fit exactly with absolutely no problem what so ever.The part woks awesome .
B000CF6S2W|5|Easy instructions and fits my wife's 2007 Nissan Frontier perfectly.  Would buy from this seller again.
B0014DGZ88|2|ladder rack was affordable but is cheaply made. The bolts that came with the clamps and the clamps are cheaply made. One bolt snapped, the other stripped along the welded nut. Wouldn't recommend to anyone.
B000O868JA|5|Very bright and easy to use
B001DSWB46|5|Made brakes feel much more responsive with less pedal effort and they look good to!!!!
B00GJMXTD8|4|Have used this product before, does the job. Could not find this locally, so shopping online works for me!
B008B5VT9M|5|Direct replacement for 2013+ Taurus w/ 13.8&#34; Brakes.  Also works to retrofit 13+ brakes on 2010-2012 Taurus/Flex.
B0006SU3QW|4|Easy application for the most part..
B0050NGB6O|5|Good quality and works well.
B00LFM3XPG|1|I've had this particular set for a year now and today the handle broke (specifically the arm that presses down to open the gate when you lift the handle).  I remember the first time I got the piece that I thought it was a fairly weak handle but figured they must have done some testing on it, apparently not enough.
B00T6IZAUM|5|The graphics look great. They came in a timely fashion and were an awesome price
B0068ETCEM|5|Seems to perform as well as OEM pads - quick and easy replacement for any DIY'er
B000HA9O5A|5|Didn't need it this time around .. But I am certain it will work well on another job.
B00CHDFUW6|5|Fit great, everything was in perfect place really needed this so I can install my pop charger without fear of driving in a puddle,
B001O0XMSC|2|Needed new front brake pads. Ordered these about 8am July 29. Order confirmation stated they would be here by Friday July 31 as a prime member I get free 2nd day delivery. Friday came and went. I was away all day Saturday but upon return found box in mail box Saturday night. OEM box showed signs of being wet, and was stuck together from being wet. I examined contents to find brake pads that while new appeared to be old stock, has rust growing on the metal. Disappointed with late delivery and diminished value of new pads by somehow previously wet from some source.
B00JFGPA0U|1|Does not fit 2003 Dodge Dakota.
B00E1VV2GK|4|There pretty good
B006NYIL44|5|This is a direct replacement for the electronic rear engine mount in my 2000 Maxima SE. I did not notice much of a difference in vibration at all.  Do yourself a favor and replace both the front and rear engine mounts at the same time, it is the same amount of work to replace one as it is to do both.
B00PZ6W4LC|5|I like it, It worked very good, no problems for replacement.
B00TS7YN5E|5|This stuff is amazing! I originally planned to clay my car after an application of Fallout Cleaner, but the Fallout Cleaner did a good enough job at removing the contaminants from the paint.
B00NQ198LC|5|Outstanding.  They do the job.  And great savings over the Thule locks which are very similar.
B001EB9WPI|2|I've been waiting to write this review after testing for many months trying to work out the bugs!  I've had installed almost 8 months now!<br />It works great in that it deflects the wind and bugs!  I also don't have the ringing in my ears after I get off my scooter anymore!<br /><br />-1 star for not such great fit.  Installed on a 2013 Tao Tao Power Max 150cc.  It leaves about a 5-6&#34; gap between dash and windshield where air still gets through so it's not a perfect wind deflector.  It might be more like a sail, but the scooter has more than enough power to compensate for that!<br /><br />-2 star because I can't figure out a way to tighten 2 screws!  They keep coming loose!  The thumb screws broke/stripped so I had to reinstall the allen screws.  Even using lock tight, the windshield bars still slide around.  It slides around so much that it has cut into my mirrors making them look like crap now!  It wobbles around excessively in the high wind speeds.  By making this kit to mount on the mirror mounts, I really think that maybe this kit was intended possible for &#62;40mph.  I don't think it's holding up very well at 65mph!<br /><br />I'm just about to make my own mounting system that will mount to the side screws below the instrument cluster on the left and right side.  This will lower the windshield further to the dash level eliminating the huge gap, hopefully make it more stable, and not have a problem of loosing screws, bouncing around, or damaging anything else further from its excessive movement!  I still don't have a clue how to do this, but I'm hoping soon to figure it out as now that I've had this windscreen, I don't think I can live without one!
B002801OT6|1|This rating is only for use on 2014 Camaro. I'm sure these work great, although they don't look as good as stock lug nuts and they don't match enough to just buy one for each wheel. But I'm very particular so I will be looking for a shorter lug that has more of a polished acorn look to match factory lugs.
B000AMZJW2|5|This is a good fuel filter, my car is running a whole lot better since I replaced it.  The installation was a bit trick due to the tight proximity of the location, but that is no fault of the fuel filter manufacturer, just how it is with compact cars.  I will continue to use FRAM for nearly all of my vehicle filter needs.  They have never given me a reason to be disappointed with their function or quality, and that is what important to me.  I want to know that when I buy something, that I don't have to worry about poor quality or design, and with FRAM, I never have to worry about that.
B00B2M44XO|5|Pretty good product. I used it for my Kawasaki 650r. Also they have a pretty good customer service.<br /><br />Thanks
B003AVPV78|5|It's awesome I love it😀
B00KL3ALGO|5|it  sticks really well
B004HE1YK0|5|Perfect, thanks
B00BLBAVGA|5|Looked exactly like it does in the picture
B000C5HJ3O|5|I bought this for my 2001 Mustang GT. I also bought a new grommet to go with the PCV valve. It fit perfectly. If you don't want to use the F connector you can pull the elbow off of the original PCV and put it on the new one. It don't take but a few minutes to do the swap. My car idles a whole lot better now. The shipping was pretty fast, too.
B00JALA8EI|5|This kit comes with everything you need and more! It is a slim ballast which is easy to hide. No buzzing from ballast. Shipping was packaged great and with an actual product box with detailed instructions. Took about 30 min to install and fires right up.
B004VQNM9A|5|It's the real deal. I priced all the usual mustang on line stores and suddenly there was a huge price drop at Amazon. This is the Ford Racing part. I didn't expect much difference once installed but pleasantly surprised in the change. If you have an 05-09 GT, it's just a matter of time before the ball joint gives out.  This is a great upgrade.
B004I0HPU6|5|I arrived on time.<br />The part was identical to the original.<br />Could not have asked for a better out come..<br />Will order again.
B006TMKHVU|5|Installed in two minutes. Even came with new bulb. Great price & sevice.
B00C10R226|5|Nice product
B00G620ZVU|5|Extra bright.  Work great.  Easy to install
B00KN0UOEE|5|cleans nice and dries to a flat non shiny finish. works great on the inside of the car where you don't want things to reflect the sun into your face.
B0057H2POA|2|Cheap vinyl.
B000C2G7VM|5|worked well
B008AGKTB6|3|100 km / h starts to vibrate, it is unstable at high velocidaddes.
B0045XRK06|5|This works great!  The lights are very bright.  Seems like it will last a while.  Very durable.
B000GU7LK6|5|Will order again.
B00CMX20H4|3|It's ok. Wasn't near as loud as I was hoping. And kind of high pitched.
B00KYJTPPS|5|Great product perfect fit keeps car cool ion hot sunny days love it
B0081NQ4ZS|5|Tnx
B004SRM9O6|5|These plugs worked well in my 2006 Kia Spectra 5.  Never use Bosch plugs in this model... they burn up  SO far, so good with the Autolites
B000OCKIHE|5|Worked great
B003CKFRXK|4|Be patient! Don't poke holes in the bottom to fill those AGM's quicker! lol. It takes a while to soak into the mats in the cells.
B001V3959M|4|Great clear view
B001A1RLC8|2|Overpriced for the quality it has. Look is good the function is not. Leather ( if it is a leather) is too thin - left glove developed a hole on the palm just under the thumb. Only used 3 days.
B0016KH1XM|5|These work well.
B00D44TH8U|1|Although it says that it fits Dodge Viper Gen 1 (92-96) it does not!  It is very different from what is on the car and it does not fit.
B001GS9GVY|5|Excellent  seat  and delivery  was on time thanks
B00BD4YIJQ|4|Pretty good seat covers
B000C59V80|4|Fits right......good price.
B000QGOPO0|5|02 Tahoe orignal speaker. Great clarity, quality, easy install with no modification needed. Highly recommend.
B000C39CL8|5|Added this and an external filter to my 2002 Volvo V70 to improve fluid life and shifting. Easy to install.
B006NYI9T6|5|GOOD BRAND FOR REPLACEMENT.
B003D4O9JS|4|When I put this muffler on my 2008 Toyota Yaris I was blown away. It was far too loud in the cabin even at cruising speed. I took it off and requested a return to Amazon, no problem! I then ordered and tried a Welded Trush muffler which did not fit properly and was louder than the DC Sports muffler. So, I put the DC Sport back on the car but I put a 6 to 8 inch extension tube on it which placed the opening of the muffler about 2 inches past the rear bumper... that did the trick! cabin noise greatly reduced and tolerable.
B0078UABBI|5|Good quality bearing,  excellent seller
B00BAOH3V4|5|Its a great quality product, the bulb sockets are cheap but the whole product is a cheap price.  its an exact replica of a HD light for a fraction of the price!  Its made of aluminum and a decent chrome plating just an fyi.  I used mine for a custom product and welded them after cutting them in half..
B009LLUYPU|5|Durable sticker with nice color to it. I stuck it on my boat earlier this summer and it hasn't faded a bit.
B000CNNG5Q|5|Super simple install, do a dry fit before removing the tape.  Use the alcohol swabs that come with it, and clean the surface first.  Finally I can crack my window when its raining, and I dont feel the rain splattering me in the face or running down into my power window controls.  Also they look pretty nice with my tinted windows.
B00ATPCXVA|4|Very well made.  Stood up well to the sun.  I just wish I could have transferred it when I changed vehicles.
B00B2PQ63C|3|Arrived quickly, Poor packaging. It was in a clear zip bag that was completely ripped. These were also very time consuming to put on. There are two pieces for the back seats and three for the front seats (this includes the head rest cover). The pink color in the picture does not match the actual color that they are. To me the picture shows a hot pink these are more of a bubble gum pink.  I do think they look cute, but would not purchase again due to all the other issues.
B0078UBM7U|5|Arrived on time.  The gears work great -- I've almost completed my 500 mile break-in.  I am now thinking about changing the use of the 1996 E150 van w/4.9L engine.  May tow trailer & go to a 3.55 ratio.  I will also look to Yukon for the new gear set.
B00GSAUHB8|5|I have a Kia Optima. It works great!! It's noticeably a few degrees cooler.
B000BYD750|1|Product did not fit my car even though it said it was a match. They made me pay to return it, even though they are in the wrong.
B00SRFXKV6|4|Nice looking product and good illumination for the light.  Star fits well and is easy to install, however If you have a closed electrical system and sealed LED lights you may need professional help.  Only a professional will be able to tap into the lighting to make this product work correctly on newer technologically advanced models..
B00EARN358|5|ok.
B0090UN116|5|Good
B0017LUZII|5|Perfect fit
B005AOPBZK|5|Fits 6-10 year old well!
B000CRBR8U|3|I'm still getting shocked when leaving my car, just not as bad. I may have to get back under it and check to make sure it's got a decent connection to the frame.
B00DJ5KEF4|5|I just tried it for the first time on a motorcycle with the quick connect pigtail on on my battery.  It worked great, charged my Samsung Galaxy quickly.  I also have Battery Tender pigtails on my Craftsman riding lawnmower and Polaris Ranger, so if there is ever a need, I could also charge while using those vehicles.
B00AXRRF26|2|Item did not snap in completely and was scratched when received as if it were used. Item was also not received in a timely manner as expected. This item definitely looks good from a distance and is for sure better than no emblem at all.
B004A2YTGK|5|Perfect fit for my brothers 1986 ford econoline 350 rv
B003SWNVI0|1|Bought for our trip from Alabama to California. It got a huge rip(almost the entire length of carrier) in it just a few hours into the trip. Luckily we didn't loos anything. But very displeased with this product!!!
B00E5OUOCQ|5|Love it!
B00EXGEBQG|5|Couldn't believe the price you guys are the best thanks
B00336XFK0|5|Great!!!!
B007TY4QAK|5|Delivery was on time ! The item fit my 99 Camry great. I bought both left and right rear regulator with motor. The left passenger window motor is not set up correct. The up button makes it go down and down button makes it Go up . U can cut the wires and correct that little issue its not a big deal. Overall it's a perfect fit and works as it described. I had called auto part stores around my neighborhood only to get prices of 135 for the left side regulator and motor and 99 for the right. I don't understand the price difference but anyways. To have $40 each from here is amazing !  They work great guys trust me . Any one with a bad experience must have not known how to install them! It's easy , u can YouTube the instructions on how to do, it a novice can do it ! I'm very satisfied with the seller and the product ! I'm a happy camper ! I will be buying again from this seller ! Packaging was professional and shipped on time!
B00KHUQ9NK|5|Very pleased with the appearance and feel of this product.  Shipment very timely. Would repurchase again from this company.
B00EAJHQKE|5|Great product and service, exactly as described.
B004QEKGA0|5|Works perfectly on our 2005 Equinox. was a lifesaver for our trip to OBX
B000JFKIAI|5|I ordered this for my husband who is a sandblaster. If all the different hoods I have purchased in the past. This is by far my favorite. I feel  confident that he is safe.
B007CEIZKO|1|Very Disappointed ! returned the first one and the second one has the same problem the top receiver bumper mount is not welded flush to the receiver there's a 1/4in difference side to side. returning the second one as well.
B00DZ34R4Y|5|Works great so far, perfect fit for the bike.
B0066CP6I2|5|Perfect for restoration of grandmas pastry board and other cutting boards<br />Rich product worth the money good value<br />Must have for maintenance of wood boards
B004J0PPBG|3|Radiator came bent sideways. Had to bend back to square.......... also the mount holes for stock fan system wasn't very accurate. Had to modify holes to line everything up. Other then those two things. Everything else was fine. Good price, fast shipping. Now Fed_X was another thing. That was the biggest problem for delivering. They didn't ring the door bell, assumed no one was home, even though there was four of us sitting waiting. So that we didn't have to wait another three days for redelivery we drove about 60 miles round trip to pickup that parts that evening...........I griped at Fed-X they didn't care much.............
B0009H51M6|3|If I don't put in the car it wont get dirty and I'll never have to buy another.
B005T44AIU|3|I ordered the splash guards soon after I purchased my 2012 Sonata because the front drivers side was broken. The technician who serviced my car the first time put them on for me. They look GREAT, but in 2 days the drivers side was broken again. Is this common? I wish I could only purchase one to replace the broken one again.
B0081KM5EK|1|Bought these to make my vehicle more obvious on Search and Rescue missions. They're not terrible during the night, but at daytime they can't be seen.
B0007O8S58|4|good lites not great but they are definitely better than stock hi beams
B00B51V1UG|5|good quality.  charged me only $95 to install at body shop
B00VY75KYO|2|the 40 inches is without the bracket so therefore it did not fit
B00696Y74O|4|I have not used it yet, and I hope I don't need to. I have it in the car for that emergency. If I need diesel fuel and the only pump is a truck stop with large nozzles, it will not fit the smaller restricted fuel filler neck on my VW TDI. The car has a mis-fuel guard which only allows a 1&#34; filler in, too small or too large it will not fit. The adapter has the proper 1&#34; dia. but will allow use of larger trucker fuel pump handle. There are plenty of places to buy diesel for cars and small trucks, but this is just in case. The AMAZON vendor Fowler Volkswagen I bought from had great price and good shipping.  I recommend them.
B00C3VTUOG|5|Awesome value, I just wish the red line lit up
B00MEHBIF8|4|I'm a beginner at installing things like this, and I decided to purchase socket wrenches and a torque wrench to install this myself. My Honda dealer didn't want to install it because if you haul more than the allowed weight of 850 lbs you can burn out your transmission and the repair will not be covered by the warranty (but I'm just using this for a bike rack).<br /><br />If you have the right tools and you know what you're doing, then it's a very quick install (30 min). If you don't have the right tools and you're completely new at this, it will take a bit longer (1-2 hours). Here are some things I learned that were not very obvious:<br /><br />*Use soapy water (or just straight up soap) to loosen the rubber holders for the muffler. If you don't use soap or lubricant, it will be very hard to get them off. Be prepared to use a pry bar or a long screwdriver or something else. The instructions mention all this, but it's a side comment and not included in the list of necessary tools. Once you know how to do it, it's not that hard at all.<br /><br />*You need a DEEP 9/16&#34; socket for the 3/8&#34; bolts. This is not mentioned in the instructions. The U-bolt sticks out extra long, and the standard socket size is not deep enough to apply enough torque. I started stripping the ends of the nuts since I didn't have a deep socket at first. I had to go back to the hardware store to get one.<br /><br />*The instructions are not easy to follow because some things are written in multiple places and some things aren't. I was following the step-by-step instructions with photos, but these didn't give the extra information about the muffler holders or fishwire. Later I saw that those tips were on the other page where the instructions are listed again but without pictures. But those tips aren't even written along with the instructions. They're completely off to the side like advertisements in a newspaper (not the place I would expect to look). Also, there are two different exploded diagrams which are similar but one gives more information than the other. It looks like two different people wrote instructions, and they couldn't decide which set to include, so they included both. Make sure you read everything thoroughly before you start so you don't accidentally miss something. Once you know what you're doing, it's quite easy.<br /><br />Overall, it's a very good hitch. Curt is a trusted brand. It would be nice if the instructions were more straightforward. They should especially mention that the 9/16&#34; socket needs to be a deep socket.diagrams which are similar but one gives more information than the other.

B000C2SCF6|1|Buy the OEM hose! This is restrictive and the  wire inside is the only thing that stops it collapsing, but it already collapses when routing round small corners. It always wants to be straight not like the picture, and is perilously close to the fan belt and pulley on my Corvette C4. I need to go and buy the correct one, I dare not leave this on my car I do not trust it.
B005ZWM0R4|4|This works ok, I did have some trouble installing it on my computer, but it did finally install and it seems to work ok.  I also have a basic scan tool, but this has much more info that comes out and it can graph the results of what it finds.  A lot more info.  Appears that there's some stuff that you have to pay extra for to unlock though.
B001DCIVD2|4|Good quality part at a great price and shipped, Prime, equals Fast.  Golly, what is not to like?!
B00FHK1EHG|5|Size seems to be slightly smaller than what is listed on the size chart, if in doubt buy a size bigger. Overall great helmet.
B00M9M0JPS|1|Didnt match well.
B000CF8W1W|5|Exselent luxury exact fit the you
B0002Q7BYU|5|Works great
B00F8TM8F8|5|Great product thank you
B0096W5CQU|5|god
B00U45YO9O|5|nothing works easier or better - and you can buy a tube from them for your own oil
B002JC7MFI|5|Headlight does not come with the bulbs, but go to O'reilly Auto Parts and you can get the cheapest good looking bulbs ($9.99)  that will make your headlight look brand new! Recommended to everyone needing the cheapest headlights that will fit your civic without hesitation or problems!
B004EK72TE|4|After trying to find a decent Thin Blue Line sticker for both of our cars, I took a chance and ordered this set of two.<br /><br />The reviews are confusing on this and other items, but this one looked good, great price and some good reviews.<br /><br />They are now on my cars and I couldn't be happier with the size, quality and look. I am attaching a picture because I think it gives you a better idea of how it actually looks on a car as far as size, quality, etc.<br /><br />The only reason I didn't give this product 5 stars is because I really don't know how long it will last....but for the price I would recommend it!
B00E9D86XC|5|Sold my vehicle before I could install it, but looks cool!
B0087NB23Q|5|Wish we made this purchase sooner!<br />Work way better than expected. Once you get the speakers in the right place in the helmet the sound is very good.<br />My wife and I ride together all the time, now she is super happy that I can tell her when we are turning, passing, hazards, etc...She has her music on and I have mine, but with a click of a button either of us can speak to the other perfectly clearly...even with ear plugs in.<br /><br />Thought we were going to be disappointed that we did not buy the 10, but for the two of us, the 5 is perfect.<br />Built a handy little charging shelf in the garage and all is good.
B000CSQB0I|5|These were a direct, drop-in replacement on a 1995 Mercedes E320 (M104 engine).<br /><br />PERFECT FIT.  Factory bolts threaded into mounts just like OEM  Excellent value!
B00ONDM07G|5|Got this to provide a place to hold my Nuvi 66 GPS, hold my iPhone and mount my Go Pro.  It's super easy to install and seems pretty rugged.  I had to take my dash panel off to put a nut under the tray but that's because I swapped out the stock stereo and lost the threaded hole.  Otherwise the tray can be installed without removing the dash.  The mount is solid and I've attached my GPS, Phone, Nikon AW100 and small camcorder (though it nearly touches the windshield).  I can even use the phone holder and my iPhone to shoot video or pictures out the windshield so I can use my other cameras for other stuff.<br /><br />Great purchase if you want to mount your phone, camera or GPS without an ugly aftermarket-looking solution.  Glad I got it.
B005BZKICY|5|Vary happy they work better than I haf expected, truly plug-n-play, and I'm happy to say they defiantly get me noticed on the road 😊
B00E1ETM50|5|Perfect LED plan to order more for my truck
B0002MSY90|5|Great for wet sanding of anything
B000C2NWOW|2|Ok, so not good set. we were expectin these breaks to last at least 6 months and they did not, bought may 11 and the squeak clips to warn that breaks need replaced already screesh alot and I took them off to look, they are shot, already need new breaks, bad set of breaks May 11-july 30ish.
B008VR5XKQ|4|Quality seems to be good, provides support for a second rider. I hope it holds up to the elements.
B0038KVOZE|5|Great product for the price
B00340FBUC|3|They are really cheap plastic, and the tops are oversized, and they are too short to cover the whole stem (as someone else noted).  They look ok.  But for the same price you can get real metal ones that actually cover the whole stem.
B007LIB6AW|5|Nice addition to my used vehicle. No problem with smell as others have had
B000C9JQVS|5|finally working i love it<br /><br />many thanks
B001OBHACK|5|Excellent product for the money!  I received these and was surprised at how good they looked for reman/rebuilt..  Going on a couple of weeks now on my 94 jeep cherokee and no issues.
B00461RB88|5|Looked for awhile for a nice heavy duty cover for my truck bench seat that would be suitable when my dog rides alongs, this was easy to attach and cut out seat belt spots( also cut out for headrests on mine) fit my '98 ford fine.
B0012GTVVA|5|A must have for RV doors when you have kids.
B0040YL4RK|4|Headlights arrived early and fit perfectly on my 2008 CR-V. The only negative is that the headlights came without light bulbs. Maybe I incorrectly assumed that a complete headlight assembly would include three light bulbs per light, but others should be aware when they're purchasing this item. I would definitely recommend buying the set, just be aware that you'll also need to purchase light bulbs.
B003330G6Y|4|Good product.
B00HEPBLXE|5|doesn't everybody have to have a little carbon fibre in their life, of course they do, the first of many, thanks amazon.
B0009IQZH0|5|Great towell
B0083CJAOO|1|Day one and 3 little leds are out I'm a triple A road side assistance driver and due to 3 leds failing I'm worried if this light will be reliable, however it is very bright and looks great on my van.
B00K53BM0E|5|Put it in a few months back, haven't had any problems so far. Will def buy again if I need to.
B001AWJ5ZS|4|If you like to push the limits of your bike this is for you. It acts as a scoop redirecting air into your intake. The basics of a stage 1 upgrade is to increase fuel, air, and spark. This helps on the increase of air flow. Obviously you won't notice a big gain with this alone, but with a new exhaust, fuel map device, upgrade in plugs and wires, better air filter flow, it is a do-it-yourself increase in power.
B00JFWKM2K|5|Works great love it.
B005VUZ7TI|5|This GM part #20809948 is the correct mirror for a 2011 Silverado, yet the Amazon site said this part would not fit my truck.
B00CMWJO0G|5|The mirror on our 2010 Nissan Sentra got knocked off parked on the street on Brooklyn. Got a quote for $150 from local garage before finding this part (from this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-lYqPvv_4g). Really easy replacement, took about ~10 min and saved ourselves $100!
B004Q3OEV8|3|They looked cute, but were completely stretched out after a couple of weeks.
B000HM9H0K|5|Nice shammy thank you
B000UHD74E|1|Not what I expected. Bottle looked bigger in the picture. It came almost empty. Overall not worth it. did not fix the smell
B011Q18D14|5|I had a engine code that was intermittent and was driving me crazy. I kept going back to O'Reilly's to use their scanner in order to clear the code until I could afford the sensors that needed to be replaced. Unfortunately inspection time was upon me and the nearest car parts place was too far from the inspection place. I could clear the code and roll into the station and pass. Saved me a bunch of money I couldn't afford to spend right then.
B00TKPKNQW|4|Fast shipping and as described. Priced right.Thank you.
B000BLMJMU|5|thanks
B00EC2CKW8|5|These are about twice as long as normal bungees. I use em on the back of my motorcycle and can double them up through my side-racks. Sometimes it's annoying with too much slack. Overall great quality, fair price and above average tie down ability with the flat cord style.
B0051TJ6JQ|5|Very pleased with the quality of this strap.  Love the loops at each end.  I use it with my tractor to drag logs to the burn pile.  I don't care where it was made (world economy, etc.) or that there was no lettering.  Great strap.
B004SEVSCS|5|Quick fix to an annoying problem.
B009HSP3K8|3|horrible horrible directions, product works post install though
B0031HEIDY|1|Said it was for my 280 Benz.. Wrong.
B00FALVU8A|5|Love the smell, and compared to my past wax experience, this one is a dream. Easy on, easy off, deep shine. The only thing I didn't wax was the tires. I'm no expert the only other wax I've tried was Zymol I got from Costco years ago and before that some sort of paste wax. This wax does not leave a white residue on plastic and is way easier to remove. I used one of their microfiber sponges to apply and a microfiber cloth to buff off. Even the next day when I saw a spot I missed it buffed off no problem.
B00EAJYINW|5|Perfect fit for my 82 gl110&#34;
B00JR4D70K|5|Excellent product!!
B00VBIL0P4|5|Again was very surprised on the price and the quality of the light .
B000BZXQPA|5|nice quality rotors for a good price. Cheaper than going to the parts warehouses and better quality. Fit perfectly on 02 Accord SE sedan.
B004C443S0|4|These are nice gloves, the are well made, the leather is a little dry, and they have a strong odor at first, it does go away, but your hands will smell like the gloves for the first several uses.  I am happy with the gloves, I have big hands and they fit just right.  I have a hard time finding gloves that say XL and my finger tips fit comfortably in, but these fit well.
B00B4Q09B4|1|Does not stick long!!!!!!!!! Attractive product but will definitely fall off after very brief use!!!!!!!!!!
B00MD0TGTQ|5|Fit my 95 civic dx hatch perfect! No instructions but included everything i needed for the install! Would purchase it again if i had another civic or integ lol!
B00O2XJ0PW|4|Nothing special. Good quality.
B00A0BAYR8|5|perfect for the strobe light hook up I used it for
B0084TQNBE|5|As advertised
B00V6QM320|5|Good Buy
B005XRPHDU|5|I LOVE THESE<br />Very good quality aftermarket lenses/lights. Very bright, they fit very well also. You may have to loosen one screw slide a bracket over and then reinstall it during install.
B00JA3BMDW|5|you cant go wrong for the price!!!
B002JT0UPA|1|Do not recommend. Poor product. Ordered 3. 3 defective.
B0096F1C0M|3|replica
B00I53W494|3|The kit was fine,except the tube the outside diameter was too small for my 1971 Mercury 9.8hp unit. just used the old one otherwise it was fine
B00139YLI4|5|I wish. Could have it back I need one for me again pls tell me w u have available thank ui
B00XV7PXHO|4|I've used this Leather Honey Conditioner on some sandals and boots.<br />It was a little thick & sticky to apply, hence the name Leather Honey, I guess.<br />It certainly revived my shoes, gave them a deepened rich color and made them look like new.<br />I would say that my shoes are now protected for many years to come, as the conditioner seems to have put a protective barrier on the outside of them, it appears to have made them resistant to water, as the droplets just bead & run off now.<br />Since this leather conditioner is different to any others that I've used, I will see how this product holds up over time & may be back to give it an extra star.<br />I purchased this product as a promotional sample in return that I leave my honest and objective response about it.
B0069R1C5K|4|Works good, never had a problem.
B004A6JA2O|4|Easy to install on a 2012 Subaru Outback,fit perfectly. Dealer wanted 60.00 to due the same job takes 5 minutes.
B009XA8BDG|5|Every thing was fine, thanks.
B000WJ3LMS|5|GOOD BUT FOR SMALL WIRE .GOOD FOR 0.25MM OR SMALLER WIRE.<br />It about 6&#34; wire twister.
B00OGUANL6|5|Just what I needed!
B00H1ES6S6|4|Great product for the price. The light output is dimmer than the replacement bulb, more like a 4w night light. Even so, these LED bulbs use 1/3 the watts and are made well so that you can insert them into the fixture w/o breakage. The price online is a small fraction of local automotive stores. If more light is desired, buy the units with more rows of LEDs. I have some &#34;4 row&#34; versions compared to these 2 row ones that are used for RV porch lights and produce lots of light but are more expensive. Unfortunately, I did not see much in the way of lumen output ratings, and am very happy with this brand and purchase. Would be 5 stars with more equivalent light output info.
B00EYK87QG|5|These are working just as I'd hoped, giving my south facing porch a beautiful glow all night long!
B00NAK956M|4|Had zero issues with these parts.
B00ZVJ35XE|3|I purchased this product at a discount in lieu of my opinion of this product.<br /><br />I would like to start out by saying the company is a 5 star company. I had issues with my product and my money was refunded literally less than 8 hours after contacting the company. They have good communication and were professionals.<br /><br />I would start by saying that this product doesnt work well for my car (2013 Dodge Charger). They didnt fit my seats well and the back seat portion did not work for me. The product does have good ideas for seat covers but it really did not work well for my car.
B0001MQ7DQ|5|I have one of these that's over 15 years old. I have used it in the RV, in the car for long trips, and am now using it with the 110v converter as a &#34;minifridge&#34; in the basement for opened wet cat food where we are keeping a kitty with incontinence problems. It works very well, although if you stuff it full of &#34;room temperature&#34; stuff it will take a long time to cool down (hours!). Better to put already refrigerated things in, but not crucial. It keeps things about 30 degrees below room temperature; no adjustable thermostat (although I use a timer to switch it on and off every half hour). After 15 years the fan is a little noisy (same room as the TV and not objectionable, but audible if you listen for it) but it has given great service. There have been times I wished I'd gotten a larger one, but sometimes, when the car is full I'm glad to have the smaller one, so you choose.
B000BH1M36|4|Just what I needed.  Works great.
B0012TWXJE|5|I bought this for a 2-month cross-country trip and it worked perfectly!!  I kept all of my items that I wanted easy access to and I always kept a map in the clear plastic on the top.  This bag holds a lot of stuff and the magnets hold strong even at 80mph (and with no windscreen on my bike).  This bag proved to be invaluable on my trip and I still use it regularly at home.  I would highly recommend this bag.
B004GCZ4FY|5|I bought one of these for both sides, as my car was missing both.  They look and perform just like the stock covers. The installation was simple, and they look great.  I received them quickly and exactly as described.
B00B2AEMA6|5|good price for a great product
B000BOAEV0|5|great cleaner removes brake dust build up from rims and tire just spray on let sit about 3 mins hose off
B0002JMIEK|5|easy to use
B00IBMPKZO|5|These work great.  I unbolted the stock lift supports, bolted these on, and I was good to go.  It only took me a few minutes, and having a working hatch back again is great. Having to hold it up, or prop it up whenever getting something in or out of it was such a pain, that these make life so much easier.  One of the supports is more than enough to lift the hatch, but using both will help to prolong the life of them.
B00KWQRC4O|5|I love this organizer.  I can fit a full box of tissues in without crushing the box.
B000E2CVDI|5|Perfect fit!
B00GRISB78|1|EXTREMELY FRUSTRATED WITH WHAT I RECEIVED. As others have mentioned there is a big difference between the Kawell branded product and the generic. I ordered two of these in the same order and received one generic and one Kawell part. Differences in mounting hardware as well as the light output. Kawell unit is very bright with white light. The generic is noticeably less bright and has a more blue tint. Since I used them in the same application as a pair, it looks ridiculous and I'm very unhappy with this. Am I supposed to undo all my wiring and repackage one and send it back and redo all my work? Not happy that this happened since I purchased both in the same order!
B00ELHT1H6|4|Good pricing.
B000OV9M04|5|Exactly what I expected!
B00KTJ9I46|5|Buy it
B00EOB6K1Y|5|A+A+A+
B001F79AFI|5|great works good
B00SA88MY0|5|Good
B00NMWAH6A|4|Fits my fat head pretty well. Love the modular design, and it stays pretty cool on the inside with the good air flow. easy to disassemble and clean. Removed the front chin pad. Only downside is after 2 months the tinted interior shield control button broke off. Haven't emailed HJC about a replacement yet. Still... great helmet!
B00LSTPN7M|4|It definitely does the job it was designed for! Mine lays mostly flat, but there is one portion of the tire cover that always looks a little rumpled. If you're looking for an inexpensive option though, this one is perfect!
B00SGFZCTA|5|Nice quality product, relatively classy looking, and just what I needed. I was concerned this keyring would be bulky, but it's not. I don't like carrying a bulky bunch of keys, so I keep the keys to my husband's  car on a separate ring. Now, I just clip them on when I drive his car. I'm very happy with my purchase. Thank you!
B000C7G726|5|Mechanic says it's just what he wanted for my beamer - happy with the purchase except no free shipping.
B0076M8TVM|5|I used this product to make my black plasti dipped wheels look glossier, and it worked great! If you really want to make your wheels look glossy, i recommend two cans of this for all four wheels.
B00NMQOFS2|5|Great decal.  went on fine and looks good.  Just be sure to follow the directions.
B00SHZ7P94|5|Great quality, great price
B000JFL8SO|5|Great tool
B00JP52GC6|5|good piece for the money. a little on the big side but overall good.
B002US3ZE8|5|Looked for awhile for a nice heavy duty cover for my truck bench seat that would be suitable when my dog rides alongs, this was easy to attach and cut out seat belt spots( also cut out for headrests on mine) fit my '98 ford fine.
B00LNOTM0G|5|Just installed these today into my 2015 Subaru WRX STI and they are, as the other reviews state, very bright and white (not bluish). They went in easily into the stock reflectors and look great! My concern comes in at how long will they last? The alternative was to purchase some from a Subaru WRX specific site at $89 per pair. Those had a built in heat sink/fan in the back of the bulb. So my question becomes, will this bulb at $25 per pair burn out quickly or will they last several years? I am a believer of &#34;you get what you pay for&#34; so I have my doubts but at $25 vs. $89 I figured I would try rolling the dice. Will report back if I have any issues.
B00D7U97RW|5|Excellent product.  Accurate and reasonably durable.  I was most impressed by the customer service and communication from the seller.<br />It comes with the sensor and is easy to install.
B009GU37SM|4|They look good on the wall above my vinyl tree.  There a lot of them in the package. I only used a few. When you first look at them on the paper, the shape appears to be weird, but once you get them up they look fine.
B00FZGGUJ4|5|Original Ford replacement part. Fast shipping.
B000CIV70W|5|Makes me feel good my car is protected.
B00O0NSVKE|5|Great product!
B004RZU3Q0|1|Light says they are submersible...well they are not. I ordered both sides (driver and passenger) and both leak badly. Very unhappy with these and will be returned...going to purchase new set right now.
B005BTBI4W|4|Good product and amazingly fast shipping and priced extremely fair
B000NJ4QCQ|5|Great quality fits perfectly. 2014 GSXR 750
B00OM978DC|1|The connecting piece on this one is much larger than on the actual stock Lexus part.  It did not fit my 2002 as they claimed it did.  Unfortunately I bent the darn thing so I couldn't return it.  However, do yourself a favor and buy the Lexus Stock Trunk lift.. not this knock-off part
B00G6KGPFM|5|Good product
B010N7RW2S|4|When I heard that there is such things as &#34;compact jump starters&#34; , I didn't believe it at first but after more than one person confirmed it, I started to believe and I went directly to my trusted external power batteries brand website: ANKER…. And there it was!  After receiving it, my belief started to weaken again!! because it was just too compact to be true!.  I had a solid belief in the product after it started my dead ford EDGE and my brother's dead Toyota Land cruiser.  I'm giving it 4 stars because both the mini manual that came with it or the one on Anker website, both don't explain what the light on the jumper cable small box means, it could be flashing red, solid red or Solid green. I kind of understood what they meant from experience. Also, it does not say how long should we wait between each jump start.
B0050NOLSY|3|i thought the whole top was kinda flimsy, wish I would of spent a little more and got the backflip
B004A30MGA|4|This coating was fairly easy to apply as I used a brush to do the edges and around any opening and a roller to cover the open areas. I used two coats to give a uniform coverage look. The hard part was cleaning the surface prior to application as quite a bit of scrubbing was needed to clean the surface properly. This coating to not cover any silicone areas. So far, Heng's has held up after about three weeks of exposure to sun, wind and rain.<br />I will know more about the durability of this material over the next year or so.
B0077S1BBU|5|Perfect OEM replacement!
B00198IKHC|5|looks like a new car again!
B007RHX0GU|5|Work great
B004ZF4MW8|4|Outstanding!!! Love them.
B00PBBX6ZO|1|The left rear installed without issue, the right rear was assembled with the top mount twisted just enough to make it take twice as long to install as I had to pull it back out to twist the top mount into the correct position. Also the coil wraps fell off during the first 50 miles of travel.  I heard some funky sounds like something was loose in back on test drive that quit after about 50 miles, inspected the struts, noticed those wraps were no longer on the springs, unsure if they were supposed to fall off or stay on, I would hope they weren't made to fall off as I didn't wish to pollute the roads or toss plastic at cars behind me... Their fronts for my car fit nice and improved my ride, used the 97-03 GP front loaded struts on my '05 GP since I had moved the sway bar to the control arm like all but the '04 and '05 between '97 and '08, the rears, with the progressive design, put all the load on a few coils. I might pull them back out use my factory rear springs as it is a tad harsher on rough roads than before.  Update, after the sub-zero temps hit our area, these struts fail to correctly dampen and the car slams on bumps it floated over in warmer temps.  I do not recommend these struts if you live in below 40F temps, at 40F they started riding rough, at below zero F they ride like there is no oil in them, it must be a clearance issue in the cold, likely lost any charge they had as well..
B005OUREY6|5|Good product
B000CB35M2|5|Nice. Just as described.
B000C42RKU|5|thanks
B0007LEG2K|5|Perfect,just what i needed.
B00COYNTNK|5|Excellent product thanks.
B009L97FPY|5|These capture a lot of dirt and debris, keeping the carpet clean. Good for rainy season and the beach.
B00ANWV6C6|1|This hubcaps don't adjust well in to the rim. They feel lose and I did not even installed. Very disappointed!
B000CKN76M|4|Did not come with zerk fitting or clips otherwise great.
B009Q76TY4|5|Great product and great price! Used on a '62 c10 project and worked perfectly
B002T07J12|5|Great price,  easy to install in the garage,  good quality ride.
B0010GG7YG|5|Exactly OEM part. No issues, great price.
B003CKLSH4|3|I have a 2003 Honda Blackbird . This filter is an approximate fit.. it was a bit small so i split the difference when installing it and have had no problem
B004A2YEUQ|1|The bearing and hub assembly feels good and solid, as it should. However, the abs sensor included was not good at all. It worked good thru 3 stops and 7 tenths of a mile, then caused my abs unit to kick on and essentially disable my brakes. Thanks to this, i now need a new bumper, core support, headlight assembly and grille. Thanks.
B00IVKYOE4|1|I ordered this sticker and this was not even close to what came in the mail.
B004GC7DJO|4|Fit perfect. Edges very sharp be carefull.
B00HRMSX6W|5|Just installed them in my 2016 CX5. It makes a huge difference, it looks 100x better. I couldn't tell when I first put them in, but as soon as the sun went down I noticed the difference.
B00FYWGVN4|2|Yet another company based out of Shenzhen or Guangzhou China making hard to use products...... Gheez.<br />I keep having to learn the hard way. Sometimes it's best to buy name brand. Because cheaper is not always better.<br />I purchased these lights but had to return them. There was absolutely NO WAY the brackets would mount in my vehicle short of drilling holes through the roof. I honestly don't see how people use these without destroying their interior. Unless they're paid reviewers.<br />Perhaps these were designed based off a vehicle made in a country no one ever heard of, or something cheap or old.<br />The lights themselves are bright and made fairly well................ compared to the Voltex ones I purchased on Ebay.<br />But after I fiddled around with these for 16 hours straight. Afterwards I had to give up and contact the seller for a refund.<br />Only received a 50% refund. Normally I would have complained but it was half my fault for not doing the proper research, so I bit the bullet.<br />These light brackets have such a poor design, even as an engineer, I couldn't mount or design a way to make these fit without mutilating my 2014.<br />Was trying to go cheap instead of paying $800 for Whelens in the front, but the headache wasn't worth it.<br />Now, not to leave out details, but the Whelen brackets didn't fit my vehicle either. Lol. Think they were specifically designed for a Caprice.<br />But for some reason, the ones from my Ebay Voltex lights did fit the Whelens..<br />The company from China copied the Whelen hole placement and the lights matched perfectly. Lol.<br />But the Hunter Vision brackets didn't line up with anything. Also the lights are too thick and too long.
B000C9OZ46|5|This fit my blazer 2000
B00TO7MXGO|5|Look awesome and stay put
B0053ZX05E|5|as advertised !
B008HZO2DQ|5|best
B00KJ17Y2C|5|Perfect, especially for price. Wiring harness is a must and really great quality light bar as well as harness. Very bright, only complaint is the whistle but that's pretty much to be expected with a light bar.
B00JVHLS3G|1|Turned yellow within on month of install. Old broken one looked better.
B000BTPX6G|5|Fits perfect and easy to install.
B00DJ2D45O|5|I've programmed numerous Toyota keys with this key maker and it works perfectly every time. For the price you can't go wrong. Buy it!
B00407NK6A|5|Nice finish
B00ZRLLY6Q|5|These tools work for me. I repurpose furniture to create new items and that means a lot of dismantling. It is difficutly, especially with vintage items, not to mark, break, or destroy an item in the process.  These tools work great for me and give me lots of options for each particular job. I have used them in repairing upholstery and they make the job easier for sure.  I was happy to try these tools in exchange for my opinion and since they were what I was looking for it was a win-win. fast shipping and good customer service.
B007KPWK1U|5|great fit
B005JKEREQ|5|He love it. Thank you so much!
B0041TOQ06|4|Fits in the 2012 A4 well.  easy enough to replace yourself.
B00RZPIT4C|1|They are cheap...do not feel or smell like leather. Don't bye....
B00WEVBDDG|5|These worked great for what I needed and were half the cost of other wheel.spacer kits! I did receive 1 of the 4 with a slight manufactures defect, but Auto Express sent me a replacement (without having to return the bad one) the very next day with hesitation! Extremely pleased.
B006ZSIGOI|5|This item is perfect! Previously, I had bought rear cargo bags and containers but gravel dust always ruined the zippers within days and I would have to buy a new one. This time I decided to go with a front mounted bag since all the gravel dust and dirt gets thrown on the rear of the ATV and it works perfect. Being a prior US Marine, I especially like the OD Green. Lots of space in this bag. Room enough to carry a tire repair kit and small air compressor, a jacket, rain gear, camera, extra glasses, binoculars, map, granola bars, a small soft sided cooler with drinks, sandwich and cold pacs. Straps across the top allow me to strap down my Garrett metal detector. Padded shoulder straps on the bottom might come in handy some day if my ATV breaks down on a trail, and I can just take the bag off the machine and it turns into a backpack. All of the compartments are set up perfect and you can adjust them to fit your needs. I will never put another bag on the rear of my ATV again.
B00B2A2JMO|5|Fast delivery and great product
B00N2CAY6S|1|Very cheaply made and unstable. The single strap that goes around the head rest is not sufficient for keeping the table in place securely; it bounces around when you go over bumps.
B004L0ABNG|4|Seem to work just fine.
B00IGIN0UA|5|Installed on my cousin's '10 RX 350.  Performed at 58k miles.  OEM pads still had 25% left.<br />Although it comes with is own metal backing plate, used the factory originals.  Remember to lube all the bolts with high heat anti-seize grease.  Applied anti-squeal paste on the each pad's back.  There are metal clip at each end of the factory pads.  These will not fit the KFE.  No worries as these clips are only used to help the pads stay in place while the caliper is being put back on.  Had a helper hold the pads instead and that did the trick!!!<br />Everything works like original with no squealing.  Satisfied with the result as well as the excellent quality/price/shipping from Amazon.
B003RF8VEC|5|They really help on the long rides, ended up helping so much, bought a second one for my wife. Don't blow it up to much, and it helps to adjust the amount of air every once in a while (when stopped) to prevent &#34;Bike Butt&#34; on the long rides.
B006JS1JG6|5|East to install, and it works as expected.
B0006SH4LY|5|This is a professional product all the way.  it is the top gun, when extreme cleaning is needed.  use as directed, and it is effective and safe.
B003IREJUY|3|Nice keychain. My only complaint is that you can tell it was just an image printed off of Google and put on the actual tear drop.
B00DX88K2G|5|This product shipped faster than expected and was true to the description.  It was well packaged. They look great on my Harley.  I would recommend purchasing these. The price was also great for the quality.
B00IKPGZAQ|5|Super fast delivery and excellent product!
B001INOG12|5|Great!
B000C9NP1U|5|I replaced the vapor canister vent valve and the purge valve at the same time because I didn't know which one caused the check engine light to come on and they were inexpensive enough that it wasn't an issue. I had already replaced my gas cap also. Anyway, it only took minutes to change out both parts and the check engine light went out within a minute or so of starting the engine. This was an easy inexpensive repair that saved lots of $$$ had I gone to a repair shop.
B007OW62V8|5|Fit and works great.
B00GRHSPBQ|3|It's a disappointment but it's still better than having no trash can or rear storage. The cup holders are so small that they can't even hold a 16 ounce gatorade bottle. I guess that's why RR gives you a coffee mug for free. Ha The fit was lose so I added duct tape to the bottom of the  unit for a better friction fit.
B00KVO4RZY|5|Great product!
B004AIHJ84|5|Fit great, install was super easy, I just wish it came with new screws, my current one's were close to being stripped.
B00NN2R74E|5|Fit perfect and fast delivery
B000PWFJDG|5|I have a 2006 525i.  I bought this a year ago and have used it for 2 summers now.  The shade is well made, very durable and fits perfectly.  It's easy to operate, the shade simply folds into a neat pack which then can be put away into a storage pack that comes with it.
B00OX5GSRW|5|Fit perfectly even delivery was faster than expected
B0097X6730|5|Slept so good on this mattress.
B00A02C9H0|3|line material as advertised . wall thickness correct for application . formablity good . an order was placed for 25 feet of line . however , this was provided in two twelve foot lengths . twenty five foot CONTINUOUS is the order - - do not take it upon yourself to manipulate order with out notification . do not want to fiddle with cut offs and splicing lines . will manage - but not happy.
B004RKCCB4|5|Finally someone fixed the metal tab issue. The metal ones tend to fall off or not have enough force to keep the lights on. I've had the stock ones, aftermarket, and JDM's (bought at a Nissan dealership in Japan) fall off.<br /><br />The tint on these lights make them perfect for black cars. Blends in so well.
B001NZQIFM|5|made the install really easy
B00NAI594Q|5|Love these car mats, the black and red together look really snazzy. The air freshener included was a nice addition as well. I'd also like to note I have had these car mats for almost 3 months and they still look nice.
B00Q374HY4|5|I bought this seat belt extender because the seat belts in the back of my car are very short and I've encountered a few adults who tried to ride back there but didn't fit in the seat belt.  I plan to keep this in my car for such incidents.<br /><br />This is a very nice quality seat belt extender and works perfectly with the seat belts in my car.  I would recommend this to anyone who needs a seat belt extender!<br /><br />I received a discount on this product in exchange for an honest review.  All of my opinions are my own.
B003HPM01M|5|Great Buy
B00HRSTRAW|3|While all replacement LEDs were made to fit and function eventually, some work is required for the map lights on a 2013 mustang.  The socket base on the replacements is so large significant force is required to seat the LEDs.  Once seated, the housing aperture needs enlargement to allow the replacement LEDs to seat properly.  I'm hoping the map light never require replacement.<br /><br />The license plate lights and trunk light were straightforward swaps and required only a few minutes.<br /><br />As with most of these LED replacements, addition of a positive indication of polarity would eliminate any need to perform reversals while installing
