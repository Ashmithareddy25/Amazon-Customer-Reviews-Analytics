B0007IN318|3.0|After visiting Pompeii, on a recent trip to Rome, I was eager to read something about that fateful day in August,79 AD, when Mt. Vesuvius erupted suffocating an entire city with ash and rocks.  If you've been to Pompeii, you've probably left there with an eerie feeling and a desire to learn more.  This was the impetus in my searching out some historical fiction surrounding this event and Robert Harris' book looked like it might be the right one for me.<br /><br />Based on all the other reviews here, I think I'm in the minority in saying that I really wasn't that drawn to this book.  When I'm reading a good book, I can't wait to get back to it.  I found myself putting off picking this one up again and again and ended up taking more time to read it than I usually do with a book this size.<br /><br />I will say, however, that the second half was much better than the first half.  While I found it interesting how the eventual catastrophe was foreshadowed by blockages in the water system, I just found the beginning descriptions so tedious.<br /><br />After seeing what still remains of the town, I was able to clearly picture the streets and the stores and the homes of the Roman inhabitants having walked around this same town myself.  I guess when you're reading a book where you know the eventual outcome, it takes some of the bite out of it for me and I'm probably being too critical of a book that I just thought could have been better.  One thing I will say with some certainty is that I'm glad I didn't live during this time of overall decadence.  Some of it really sickened me.
B000MTPAHW|1.0|My first copy would stop at a particular location and refuse to go beyond that spot.  Amazon quickly replaced it but the second would not even play.  I was told that it was a widespread problem and the Disc would not be replaced.  My account was credited for the DVD.  I am happy with Amazon but I would still like to have the HD copy sometime.

B00133KDM8|4.0|I'll be up front & say that I'm not not a huge operatic metal/rock fan, but I am pleasantly surprised by this CD. Back when I first listened to Nightwish years ago, I didn't get into them as much at that time, but years later after hearing Tarja Turunen was going solo I was actually curious to see what direction she would go into musically. Well here we are & it seems that she went a little more into the operatic side of rock but I surprisingly really dig this sound. Normally I would want more metallic sounding songs & less operatic vocals, but here Tarja actually delivers less metallic songs but her vocals aren't as intense like when she was in Nightwish so I think the music is more pleasing to the ear. This is definitely one of those CDs to listen to if you just want to float away from the craziness in your mind & let the music sooth you. Give it a listen, you might actually like it.

0452289963|2.0|I find Mr. Tolle to be brilliant and yet extremely difficult to follow without rereading passages or pages several times.  He is extremely cerebral or intellectual in his discussions at times and I understand why Oprah is attempting to assist his with getting his message out as what he has to say definitely has merit.  However, I found that SHIFT: 12 Keys to Shift Your Life [[ASIN:1434362825 SHIFT: 12 Keys to Shift Your Life]] was much more accessible and practical for me to use.  It was easier to understand the concepts and gave me incredible tools that I could use in the moment to make a profound difference in my life... and continue to on a daily basis.  I don't understand why this book is as prominent as it is and that SHIFT is a sleeper.

1582701709|2.0|The Secret gives readers the power of what CAN be created when you can focus your intentions in solely a positive manner; however, it fails to address the underlying, subconscious thoughts and feelings that we all create with every day.  Once you understand how powerful each of us really are, you must understand how we create incredibly powerfully from both our shadow thoughts/feelings AND our positive, enlightened, loving thoughts and feelings.  I found that SHIFT:12 Keys to Shift Your Life [[ASIN:1434362825 SHIFT: 12 Keys to Shift Your Life]] was powerful in assisting me to transform my shadow thoughts and negative feelings of anger, guilt, fear, shame and unworthiness so that I COULD actually create my life anew as they talk about in the Secret!  These two books together are AMAZING and I would highly recommend the combination in everyone's library!

B000Y8GFY8|5.0|I confess, I'm still getting used to the glitzy, glammy sound Goldfrapp had in its last album. Now it has gone to the other extreme -- floaty, instrumental pop.<br /><br />Fortunately it doesn't take long to get used to this new style, because it fits Goldfrapp like a fine silk glove.The dancy electrobeats are translated into shimmering downtempo, the hard edges softened into acoustics -- it's a floaty, dreamlike, bittersweetly beautiful little album, full of swirlingly addictive instrumentation and wistful vocals.<br /><br />It opens with the mellow rippling guitar, overlaid with an ethereal fog of sorrowful violins, a touch of synth, clips of birds singing happily. \\"Only clowns would play with dull balloons,\\" Alison Goldfrapp sings in a girlish slur. It's pretty hard to hear what's she singing (\\"Roasting, roasting, roast indeed, mahogany\\"), but the exquisite quality of the music makes up for it.<br /><br />This is where you know it's all going to work.<br /><br />And she doesn't disappoint in the songs after, startling with the quivering synth and satiny vocals of \\"Little Bird\\" (\\"We dance by the sea/the land of blue and gold/is where we were free/do you lie, lie lie?\\") and catchy, sunny \\"Happiness.\\" And it sets the tone for some of the songs that follow -- exquisitely sensuous pop melodies, odd chorale ballads, dramatic electronica, and the sprightly dancy chamberpop of \\"Caravan Girl.\\"<br /><br />The highlight has to be \\"A&E,\\" a warm fragile little melody spun that ripples with piano and soft keyboard. And as the melody picks up into a swirling instrumental speckled with electronic blips, the tone turns a bit darker. \\"I was trying to phone you when I'm crawling out the door.... I was feeling lonely, feeling blue/Feeling like I needed you/Like I've woken up surrounded by me/A&E...\\"<br /><br />Most bands can't pull off a total change of sound -- they're going to disappoint a lot of, and often the quality of their music suffers because they're simply not used to this style. Fortunately Goldfrapp is not one of those bands -- it's hard to imagine anyone being turned off by the lush, bittersweet sound of this album.<br /><br />The songs are spun out of a lot of acoustic instruments -- waves of elegant strings and a low-key piano, with some acoustic guitar and jazzy drums to keep the melodies grounded. But they haven't totally abandoned electronica -- there's a trip-hoppy downtempo flavour to these songs, mostly expressed in warm, misty synth that gently wraps around the chamberpop and folky melodies. But you do get some kooky catchy organ again toward the end.<br /><br />And Alison Goldfrapp sounds like she's having fun. Her flexible, silky voice can become whatever the melody requires of her -- girly slurring, terrifying perkiness (\\"We're here to welcome you!\\"), an otherworldly balladeer -- but most of the time she sounds lovelorn and wistful.<br /><br />And while the music may be more accessible, the songs she sings are flavoured with depression, moments stolen with a lover you'll never really have, and even drug overdoses (\\"It's a blue, bright blue Saturday, hey hey/And the pain has started to slip away/I'm in a backless dress on a pastel ward that's shining/Think I want you still/But it may be pills at work\\").<br /><br />Goldfrapp have really outdone themselves in the shimmering, exquisite \\"Seventh Tree,\\" a sharp deviation from their previous music.

1594489505|5.0|An interesting Book. Certainly held your interest and gave an eye opening view of how difficult life for women has been in the far east.  It also makes you aware of how fortunate we as US citizen are for our freedom to be anything we want to be.  It was not enjoyable reading but heart wrenching and more appreciative of what I have.

0375842209|4.0|The Book Thief by Markus Zusak is a very intriguing and extraordinary novel for young adults. This novel takes place in Nazi Germany and it is the story of Liesel Meminger's childhood. Liesel is very curious about the world and after she steals her first book she is determined to learn how to read and write. Liesel and her best friend Rudy begin to steal books from the Mayor's house. Stealing gives them a sense of freedom and thrill in a time when their world was so controlled. Through reading and writing, Liesel finds her passion and finds a way to stay sane in such a scary time. Liesel forms a deep relationship with Max Vandenburg, the Jew her foster family is hiding in their basement. Through the power of words and friendship Liesel manages to escape haunting memories and overcome many obstacles.     As a young Jewish girl, this book really meant a lot to me. It may be fictional, but it gives me hope that in a time of such hatred and dysfunction, there were people that truly wanted to help. The story has a sad, spooky, and refreshing tone with Death as the narrator. Death first meets Liesel when he comes to pick up her brother, and then many others throughout the story. Death provides descriptions of the evil in the world and the fear of dying so many people have. Liesel's story provides a sense of luck and hope that we can survive trying times. Liesel lives in a town where so many horrible things are taking places. However, Zusak still manages to craft an adventurous story full of finding love and hope.

B000008M1P|5.0|For me this Cd is one of the best 80s rock albums, you have the three excellent singles \\"Edge of a Broken Heart\\", \\"Cryín\\" and \\"Love Made Me\\", but there are other great songs like \\"Desperate\\" and two of my preferred Vixen songs \\"American Dream\\" and \\"I Want you To Rock Me\\", in fact all the songs are great.  All the Band plays really good, Vixen have a excellent powerful glam rock music style. I remember that I love this band since the first time I listened, and I was very happy when in 2004 they edited again the first two albums. For me the original line up of Vixen first two album is the best Girl Rock band ever!

032147404X|5.0|I bought this book a year ago when I switched to a digital SLR.  Wow, it's incredible.  Scott's method of presenting the information clearly and concisely makes the book awesome.  He throws in a bit of humor-which made me laugh out loud-but the content is what really makes it a stand-out book.    I based the purchase of my tripod and several other \\"critical\\" gadgets on this book and I have been very happy with the huge jump from \\"okay\\" photos to pretty nice photos that non-photographers sometimes claim could \\"be on a post card\\" or say I should enter them in a contest.  I've got a long way to go, but realizing that things like a polarizing filter, a good tripod (with a ball head), a bubble level for the hot shoe, a shutter release, etc have helped my photos so much.     I definitely recommend this book to the person who currently uses a SLR camera but doesn't often shoot with a tripod, wonders why their photos are not as sharp as the pros, and just wants some great tips for shooting.

B000O75F7C|4.0|The last new Porcupine Tree album that I picked up was In Absentia (2002); at the time, I thought the album was pretty heavy, but not noticeably so.  This 2007 release presents more of the same, but the edgy heaviness has now become what sounds a lot like heavy metal (or whatever it is called nowadays).  I also noticed that they had finally signed to a major label (Atlantic).  While I do not feel betrayed in any way, I have to admit that the bone crunching metal caught me a little off guard.<br /><br />The lineup includes bandleader Steve Wilson (lead vocals, acoustic and electric guitars, piano, keyboards), former Japan keyboardist Richard Barbieri (electric piano, organ, mellotron (samples?) and synthesizers), Colin Edwin (bass guitar), and Gavin Harrison (drums).  Joining the band on backing vocals is John Wesley and much to my surprise (and delight), King Crimson founder Robert Fripp provides soundscapes on Way Out of Here and Rush guitarist Alex Lifeson cranks out an electric guitar solo on Anesthetize.  I really like the synth textures that Richard uses - they are mainly used to simulate strings and are used as a sustained backdrop rather than a melody line.  Steve's guitar textures/timbres include delicate acoustic sections, clean tones on an electric, and a thunderous, \\"crunchy\\" tone on the electric.<br /><br />The six tracks on the album range in length from 5:07 to the large, near epic Anesthetize (17:42), with three of the tracks in the 7-8 minute range. Musically, the band is still very tight and the trademark Porcupine Tree blend of haunting and sad minor chords, atmospheric synthesizer parts and heaviness still works pretty well.  I was also excited by the fact that the arrangements seem a bit more involved on at least a few of the tunes.  The harder aspects of the music have been turned up a bit though; come to think of it, there were moments where I was expecting Steve to launch into the \\"cookie monster\\" vocal style characteristic of certain types of modern heavy metal.  Of course, this never happens, which makes the contrast between the heavy and the light so pronounced (and yes, cool) - along these lines, I should note that although I have been throwing the term \\"metal\\" around a lot, Fear of a Blank Planet is very far removed from a full blown metal album and the acoustic passages and especially the spacey synthesizer parts leaven the heavier moments nicely.  Alex Lifeson turns in a nice solo that is loaded with eastern modes; admittedly, the solo is worlds away from his live performances of Broon's Bane, but it is still nice to hear Alex anyway.<br /><br />The album's concept revolves around the alienation of youth in the information age - overall, this is not the cheeriest of albums and the brooding, gothic-tinged music reflects this.  To drive the point home, there are some gloomy images of kids cast in the pale, luminous glow of a television set scattered throughout the liner notes (with lyrics).  Based on what I have read, the album's concept is taken directly from the novel Lunar Park (by Brett Easton Ellis).  However, the greatest distinction between the two is that the novel unfolds from the perspective of the protagonist (a father), while the album's story is told from the perspective of the father's son (a \\"terminally bored\\" and medicated 10-15 year old kid).  As one of the \\"elders\\" referred to in the product description notes and a father, I can't say that I necessarily share the world view of a 10-15 year old child who has lost touch with those around him, but certainly worry about my own children and the ways that they will interact with and respond to technology.<br /><br />The sound quality is superb on this album, although the drums are a bit far up in the mix; sometimes at the expense of the more delicate instruments.<br /><br />My editorial comments aside, this is a good album by an interesting band whose music has evolved from atmospheric washes of ambient rock to a tight ensemble with a fairly hard edge.  For those folks interested in the bands earlier, more ambient works, excellent examples include The Sky Moves Sideways (1995) and Signify (1996).ested in the bands earlier, more ambient works, excellent examples include The Sky Moves Sideways (1995) and Signify (1996).
B0013FBS20|5.0|...This movie was incredibly good. Some of the Negative reviews said that the movie was boring; they're probably very simple people... The movie is not an \\"action flick\\", this is not \\"Die Hard\\", its a drama. It follows \\"the last man on earth\\" and shows how he gets himself through life with no one around. It tries to answer questions like; How does he feed himself? What does he do with his time? Why is he the last one left? Will Smith delivers one of the best performances he has given, putting him on par with the likes of Denzel Washington (thats right).<br /><br />This movie is not for the person who's favorite movie is \\"The Fast And The Furious\\"(I do like that movie though). But it is for someone looking for a movie that will draw you in and tug on your emotions. For me, this movie was intense, emotional, exciting, and dramatic. Last time I checked that was what a movie was suppose to be. Just pick it up, it'll be worth it.
B000009RC2|5.0|I first heard the Mahavishnu Orchestra back in college. An old roommate of mine flipped me a copy of Birds of Fire, telling me he hated it but thought it was something I might like (as you can guess, we didn't get along very well). This was not my first experience with McLaughlin. I had heard his work with Miles Davis, and I thought I knew how good he was. But this album showed us a completely different side of this artist. Juxtaposing his work on A Tribute to Jack Johnson, On the Corner, and In A Silent Way, with the music contained on this disc and the rest of his Mahavishnu Orchestra recordings, only serves to underscore just how many styles this man could handle. I obviously backtracked, picking up any and every McLaughlin disc I could find, including his Shakti discs, his solo jazz outings, his work on Lifetime, his work with Paco DeLucia and Al DiMeola, etc. etc.). And I can say with some certainty that this disc is probably the best of them all.<br />The music is a mixture of blues, jazz, heavy metal, and indian classical music. If this sounds like a crazy mishmash, you are right. But these guys make it work, and do it brilliantly. You have to understand, we're talking about an all-star band here: Jan Hammer (keyboards); Jerry Goodman (electric violin); Billy Cobham (drums); Rick Laird (bass) and of course McLaughlin, wielding an axe that is one part Hendrix, one part Django and one part Ravi Shankar. All were absolute musical masters, truly musicians' musicians. And they drive this point home repeatedly, with unison 32nd note runs, intertwining solos that progress towards points of singularity, stops and time-changes and interlocking - at times disparate - themes woven together effortlessly.<br />The sheer energy and power of this album is difficult to put into words. Keep in mind that most of the musical arguments here are very short, repeated statements used as vamps for ensemble improvisations...but this sounds too simplistic. The music actually is far more complex. Suffice to say that you won't hear much of anything that sounds like this elsewhere, with the exception of some King Crimson (I'm thinking specifically of the album \\"Red\\", and that came out a few years after this). Highlights are \\"Dance of Maya\\", \\"Noonward Race\\", \\"Meeting of the Spirits\\", \\"Vital Transformation\\"...but do yourself a favor and listen to the entire album. The slow pieces (I'm thinking of \\"Lotus\\") are beautiful and melodic and provide breathing room for the listener. It isn't in here by accident, it provides a break from the ordeal! And it is just that. This album presents a challenge. But if you are up to the challenge, you will find that this album takes you to pinnacles as few other pieces of music can.<br />An absolute favorite of this fusion nut. And I've heard a lot of fusion. Recommended along with Birds of Fire (1972), Between Nothingness and Eternity (1973), Apocalypse (1974), Visions of the Emerald Beyond (1975) and Lost Trident Sessions (from 1973, released in 1999).plex.

B000UBMWG4|4.0|Riddly Scott is one of the best director of all time. He has made Some of the best films to grace movie screens. His attention to quality and detail is unsurpassed. Blade Runner is no different. This movie is an incredible glimpse into what would be our future. This updated version of the movie adds to what was already a visually magnificent movie. The story however is lacking, but thats okay because this is a flick not a drama. The acting and dialog  are both pretty good, but not amazing. Over all, it is easy to see why this film has earned suck a cult following, and is much diserving of it. The best part of this movie is its tremendous and extraordinary view of the future, as well as its is exploration into what makes us human.<br /><br />The 5-disk set includes every version of the film that was released. Ever. It is also packed with extra feature that are a must have for any Blade Runner fan. This is a VERY good deal and if you are even remotely interested in this movie I would recommend picking it up.
B0000046X0|5.0|Hymn of the Seventh Galaxy (1973), gave us the first incarnation of the band to feature its most famous instrumental configuration...i.e., no female vocals, no saxophone, no flute. No lyrics at all, pure music. We get the more conventional rock instrumentation for which the band would become famous; guitar, keyboards, bass, drums. There would be additional lineup changes to follow, but the basic formula was in place and set the stage for a run of excellent studio efforts from the group.  This probably is not Return to Forever's best album, but it is my personal favorite. There is a heavy vibe here, with a very distinct proto-metal sound. However there is also a significant emphasis on latin themes, and you can hear it, especially in the percussion and in some of Chick Corea's more rhythmic playing. Compositions are well laid-out, and while there is ample space provided for extended jamming, the jams are well-structured, particularly the work of Stanley Clarke on bass and Corea on keys. Bill Connors is the guitarist here, and while he is clearly not the equal of Al DiMeola, he is no slouch. A lot of times I appreciate his expressive style more than DiMeola's mathematical precision. Lenny White's importance here on percussion cannot be understated either, as he keeps the other band members from careening off the planet with this propulsive drumming.  This album features several great tracks: After the Cosmic Rain, Captain Senor Mouse, and Theme to the Mothership are all monstrous compositions, featuring solos at breakneck speed, on-a-dime time changes, and key shifts to keep even the most seasoned listeners on their toes. The title track is a tight little number that has more in common with progressive rock than it does fusion.   The mastering is not great, it is from 1990 and is fairly flat unfortunately. The packaging doesn't include much beyond a track listing. This has never been remastered...then again none of the RTF catalog has. It seems to me this band shouldbe next in line to get the proper remastering treatment, the way Mahavshnu Orchestra, Weather Report, et al, have (ahem!)  Overall, a great place to start for most RTF newbies. The discs that followed this, however, are considered by most to be superior efforts and if you enjoy this disc, they shouldn't be missed: Where Have I Known You Before (1974), No Mystery (1975), and Romantic Warrior (1976).
B000NA2BEU|5.0|Kristen Bell continues to shine in the third and final season of Veronica Mars.  This season does not have the same level of depth as the previous two seasons, as there is no season long mystery for Veronica to solve.  There are multiple mini-mysteries that Veronica does solve, and she figures them out well.  Plus, Kristen Bell's acting is reason enough to watch the show.  She's sassy, smart, creative, and has that no fail attitude seldom seen in a young actress.  Any fan of the first two seasons will love this season, as many of the cast returns, along with some new characters.  If you have not watched Veronica Mars, start now!
0743486285|5.0|This book had me at page one, this sordid tale of heroin use and the rock star life that goes with it will keep you reading until you finish every last entry. Reading daily entries of his downward spiral is horrifying yet opens your eyes about drug addiction, never have read such a true account of being a addict.
0765350386|5.0|Just loved this book.  The story line is intriguing, the characters/relationships well developed and - best of all - not predictable!   New twists to the plot have me hooked - have read the second volume & now can't wait for the third.

B000U0F7RG|5.0|I really enjoyed the Gilmore Girl's collection. Not only do you get all 42 discs with special features, but you get a book with summaries of each episode and a book with all the words and sayings that the characters use in the shows with explanations, especially for the young viewers that never lived through some of the eras they mention. At my age I tend to understand the majority of the references made by the characters, especially Lorelai and Rory. I have enjoyed many gilmore girl marathon weekends since my purchase. I don't have to get home at 5pm to watch it on TV. I can watch it at any hour on any day.
B000G2AHUA|1.0|We recieved two right shoes in a brown shipping box.  The original shoe box was not included.
0765318741|4.0|I bought the book because of the movie. I thought it might have extra detail into the depth of the character Robert Neville, a character I really I liked. However, while the book is quite good as literature, it is quite different from the movie; a fact I knew but I just did not know how different. In the book, our Robert is not a scientist or in the Army and the true origin of the vampire-creating disease is not given. He does however try to figure out as best he can what has happened. He also grapples with his loneliness and the human side of being alone, more so than in the movie. In the book he is not accompanied by a his trusting dog Sam. Robert Neville is essentially not the same as in the movie; which is fine because that was the way the movie makers wanted it. So even though the movie is based on the book, you have to look at each work different, and don't judge one by the other. With the version of the book I received there were also some short stories by the author which I did not expect. I liked the book and it was/is good but I preferred the movie. After you read and see you might think different.
B0011NVC9I|5.0|BEOWULF is a definitive instant classic in every sens of the word.    The Imax 3-D experience was toally incredible and by far the best Imax experience I've ever had in a theater.    This HD DVD is good, although not the greatest experience as the Imax 3-D, but still the action/adventure is awesome, the storyline is way better than 300. Both were great movies, but 300 lacked dragons and demons that were solid to look at - especially Angelina Jolie!! Vava-voom!    Best action/adventure movie of the year...?    Epic fantasy at its best!
B0011NVC98|5.0|Although I would not say that \\"Beowolf\\" is an extremely original idea, I thought that the animated adaption (almost real looking) was very entertaining! Imagine King Authur meets Lord of the Rings, that's Beowolf, and there was much more which made this adaptation extremely enjoyable.     The plot...there was a King (played by Anthony Hopkins)who gives into the seductive powers of a beautiful enchantress/succubus/Bad Girl (Angelina Jolie)and is cursed for his misdeeds by having a monster (really his son), Grendal, attacks his castle and kill his people. He sends out messages far and wide that \\"anyone who can kill the beast will be greatly rewarded\\". Enters, Beowolf (a man of vision, and a man of great strength with great tales of killing some of the most heinous creatures ever imagined)who says that he is up to the challenge and will kill the creature. Lusting after the King's wife, he sets out to kill the beast and confront it's mother. Unfortunately, it would appear that Beowolf is also easily seduced and we see him reaping the sins of his past. Filled with betrayal, lust, treachery, fight scenes and wonderful characters, we find a story unfolding and ending (not surprisingly with another fool being seduced by Jolie). Apparently, no Great King learns from previous mistakes. I enjoyed this movie, and would highly recommend it.
B000OY8NII|4.0|The series DVD is great. But the eco-friendly packaging is pretty terrible. The DVD molded-disc-holder is made of crumbly blue foam material that breaks off easily and static-clings to the DVD playing surface, quickly degrading enough that it no longer even holds the discs in place.
B0013FDM7E|4.0|I for one love the apocalyptic movies. Meaning it's the end of the world, and either there is one survivor or a few, but the results are the same...people really discovering how to survive during the end of days. Ex-Military researcher, Nevell is apparently immune to the very real vampire-like virus that has completely devastated New York City (in the future). Alone with no one but his dog (his wife and daughter were killed), and a variety of strategically placed mannequins, Nevell appears to be handling solitude, as anyone would (with a touch of madness). In a city filled with deer, wild animals (they obviously got out of the Zoo), Nevell spends his days hunting those that are ill, and his nights hiding out in his well fortified home. Unfortunately, things change as we see other survivors and the very beings that Nevell thought were so unintelligent (and without meaningful brain activity) being more intelligent (well at least the leader) than first believed.     I enjoyed this story, although I wasn't particularly fond of the ending. I think that in a time of great despair and hopelessness, we see a man that was able to survive, with his sanity (well not exactly) and his sense of purpose. And I really think that it takes a great actor, to be able to portray loneliness so well. Will Smith did a wonderful job!

B000X1Z0BU|5.0|Once is an unusual love story that avoids all the clichés and conventions of the genre. This is a tiny movie (made with a budget of $100,000) that follows two struggling musicians who manage to connect in Ireland and who inspire each other. The music is amazing, as is the acting, which is particularly impressive considering this is the first movie job for the couple in the lead roles. Just beautiful.
B000005J56|5.0|For lovers of Latin or Cuban music, this is a must have! You will not be disappointed.
B000Z27HLS|5.0|While I also liked the previous BBC adaptation of Northanger, this one is equally good.  The script, the casting, the acting, the music all combine to a lovely movie worthy of Austen.  Particularly fetching is the actress playing Catherine Morland.  She looks like a young Kate Beckinsdale (shades of her great adaptation of Emma -- much superior to the insipid one with Paltrow) and I hope to see her again and again. The actress playing Mrs Allen is no other than the one who played Fanny Price in the previous BBC adaptation of Mansfield Park - which I also thought was very good.  I also liked the girl who played Isabella, though I think she was a little too likeable and less of a flirt than she was in the novel and in the previous BBC adaptation.
0800141849|5.0|The Mirror Has Two Faces    When our local cable company started running this film a month ago, I had almost forgotten that I had seen it in the theatre when it first came out.  I was reminded of how much I had missed the film and started watching it again.  I was surprised and pleased to find that I still enjoy it and I've watched it faithfully every time that it's shown.    Jeff Bridges plays a Columbia University mathematics professor, Gregory Larkin.  He is   good looking but a boring, lonely man, whose relationships with beautiful women never work out. He wants one that is platonic, which is founded on respect, intelligence and a passion for ideas. Inspired by a television ad, he takes out his own personal ad and finds several applicants, which includes another Columbia University literature professor Rose Morgan through her sister, Claire, who answers the ad     Gregory calls her one night after visiting her class and asks her to dinner where the two of them hit it off.   Three months later, Gregory proposes and explains the arrangement, although, he tells her that if she wants sex, given enough of a warning, he'll be able to provide that.  Rose accepts, even though she wants more. She gets her chance after she helps Greg with his teaching and he asks her if he can return the favor.  And that's when things go horribly wrong.     While I'm not a big fan of Barbra Streisand, I find this romantic comedy to be witty and intelligent.  The acting is sensational on all fronts, especially from Barbra Streisand, Jeff Bridges and Lauren Bacall who are its standouts.  The chemistry between Ms. Streisand and Mr. Bridges is perfect and their romantic scenes are wonderful to watch, especially the final scene.
0321344758|5.0|One of the must have books on my reference shelf is \\"Don't Make Me Think, A Common Sense Approach to Web Usability\\" by Steve Krug. I've recommended this book to many people, so I thought it was about time to give it a proper review.    One of the things that first drew me to this book when it first appeared was the subtitle. I've said it again and again, but it bears repeating...much of the \\"science\\" of good UI design is just common sense. This begs the question as to why some people find it so hard, and I think the answer lies in the idea of common sense in our society. We are so busy being busy that oftentimes we don't slow down enough to really *think* about a problem and thus the common sense solution eludes us. A book like \\"Don't Make Me Think\\" is a great way to make you put on the brakes a little and examine the fundamental principles of usability. For those of you that aren't web developers, don't be scared off. Although the focus of Mr. Krug's book is web design, most of the concepts are equally extensible to other software design work    If you've not read any books on interface design or usability before, this book provides the perfect intro into that world. As he mentions in the forward, this book is for those people or companies that don't have a usability professional on board or can't hire one for some reason or another. By taking the ideas introduced in \\"Don't Make Me Think\\" you can be on your way to doing this work yourself very quickly.    The author's writing style is both casual and witty and he follows the advice of his title when explaining new concepts, breaking it down so you can understand the underlying psychology without getting bogged down in terminology or theory. Chapter 1 begins with an introduction to what the author calls \\"Krug's First Law of Usability\\": \\"Don't Make Me Think\\". Simply put, this means that your ultimate goal is to design your interface so that when you look at it, it is immediately evident what you can do and how you goabout doing it. In this chapter, Krug explores some of the elements of design that put more cognitive load on us than is necessary and then demonstrates ways to reduce this load. This is done through both the narrative as well as excellent graphics which simply but elegantly display his point.    Chapters 2 through 5 begin the exploration of how we really go about using an interface and set forth the guiding principles we need to be thinking about when designing. First, Krug talks about the difference in what we design for (reading, more reading and even more reading in a set pattern) vs. the reality of how people scan through an interface in a seemingly chaotic way. He then extends on the lessons learned here by helping you understand the techniques you can use to design interfaces for scanning rather than reading. He addresses five important things you can do to achieve the goal of capturing user eyeballs as much as possible: creating a clear visual hierarchy, breaking pages into clearly defined areas, minimizing ui noise, making clickable elements obviously clickable and taking advantage of established UI conventions. This first section wraps up with a discussion of why we like \\"mindless\\" choices and the importance of good copywriting and how you need to omit all but the essential words in your design.    Chapters 6 and 7 focus on the elements that Krug believes you must get right in your design. Chapter 6 is concerned with laying out the fundamentals behind good navigation. Since this is an area I call a lot of bad designs out on, it's one that I really enjoyed. Krug discusses some of the basic concepts of navigation and why navigation is so important to a user. He deconstructs various navigation conventions and explains why they work or don't work effectively. He also addresses the good use of search, page names, breadcrumbs, and the tab metaphor. Chapter 6 ends with a number of great graphics which show several sites as they were designed and the author's analysis of what was wrong. He then shows a revised version based on what he would do and in some cases also shows the company's own effort at making some improvements. As they say, a picture is worth a thousand words, so it would be good for the reader to spend some time pouring over these excellent examples. Chapter 7 is devoted to the design of the homepage and how to best design that important first impression. As in Chapter 6, there are a lot of great \\"before and after\\" examples to round out the theory.    The next two chapters of \\"Don't Make Me Think\\" are concerned with how you make sure you did the right things in your design. That is, they focus on one of my favorite topics, the idea of usability testing. In particular, Krug wants the user to walk away after reading these chapters realizing that usability testing is within reach of every single developer out there. Sure, in the ideal world we'd all have a department of usability experts that are there to critique our designs and help us craft the most user-friendly interfaces possible, but we all know that our day to day jobs are far from the ideal world. Still, Krug argues, you can find value in any amount of testing you can do. Krug espouses some common sense thoughts about usability testing, such as the idea that it is an iterative process, that you should test early and often and that testing even one user is better than testing none. Once he convinces you of the importance of usability testing, he presents some simple to follow instructions on how you can carry out your own tests. As he points out, it doesn't have to be expensive or fancy. You really can do this stuff on a shoestring budget. Chapter 9 ends with a sample excerpt from a test session, which in my opinion is probably worth the cost of the book right there.    Krug wraps up the final chapters of the book with a focus on the larger concerns of interface design, such as why usability should be considered a common courtesy, where accessibility comes into the picture and how to deal with a boss that \\"doesn't get it\\". If you just want to cut to the chase and start improving your designs right away you can skip these chapters, but they do a nice job of summarizing at a high level many of the salient points of the book.    All in all, \\"Don't Make Me Think\\" is a thoroughly enjoyable read and a very practical book for those that aspire to create better interfaces for their users. Coming in at just under 200 pages with lots of clear illustrations, you can probably read this book in a couple of evenings, which is great for those of us intimidated by the 1000 page tomes that populate the computer section in most bookstores. Probably the best part of \\"Don't Make Me Think\\" is that it applicable to the work you are doing today. You can read a chapter or two and immediately start putting the concepts into practice and the value you'll get as you do so far exceeds the book's cover price. \\"Don't Make Me Think\\" is highly recommended and I hope you make the decision to add it to your reading list today. You don't even have to think about it! :-)
B000OVLBGC|5.0|this film is absorbing and the acting is thrilling. it deserved all the awards it could get
B00102FELM|4.0|Well, after months of hearing about it, my most anticipated DVD of 2008 finally arrived and I have mixed feelings. From a performance standpoint, this is an AWESOME show featuring guest appearances by ex-Scorps Michael Schenker, Uli Jon Roth, and Herman Rarebell. The addition of these great musicians for a one-night reunion is a blessing for those of us who listened to the Scorpions long before Rock You Like a Hurricane took the mainstream rock world by storm in the early 80s. All musicians are at the top of their game, and enjoying themselves on this special night.<br /><br />Unfortunately, as is often the case with DVDS these days, this suffers from the dreaded MTV-video style editing throughout, causing even non-epileptics to go into seizures after awhile. Special guest guitarists Roth and Schenker deserve more camera time during their brief appearances, but their amazing solos were caught only momentarily in the unyeilding flashing of images.<br /><br />Camera shots changing every second is fine for a 4 minute video, but it gets really annoying on a concert that stretches over two hours. Someone needs to string these video editors up by the gonads and let them hang for a week on CNN Updates to get the point across. It virtually ruins my ability to just sit and watch the concert all the way through (unless I'm really drunk or multi-tasking).<br /><br />I also have some issues with the audio. On my 5.1 computer system speakers, the volume is very low and I have to max out all  controls to get it to sound anywhere near a rock concert. Also, the bass end is lost in the mix and I had to really boost up both my EQ and subwoofer to get some PUNCH out of this show. When I did that, the bass guitar was just a rumbly drone.<br /><br />In contrast, on my television's old-school tower speakers with a modern subwoofer, the over-all volume level is fine (probably because of the amplifier), but again the bass guitar is distorted when I tune the subwoofer to kick me with the drums. A legendary concert of this magnitude deserves a better mix in my opinion.<br /><br />I do have to give the audio engineers credit on the 5.1 surround mix though, it is a fantastic use of the technology. Really cool stereo/front-rear effects, and they are featured throughout. Hearing it on my tv's stereo system just doesn't do it justice compared to the surround.<br /><br />With the video/audio flaws setting this DVD at 3 stars, the nearly perfect musical performance brings it up to a solid 4 STARS and is still worthy of purchase for any long-time Scorpions fan. My recommendation: BUY IT!<br /><br />It's probably the best Scorpions concert you'll ever get to see in your living room.

B000XCZGV8|4.0|A great movie with plenty of suspence and drama. The attention to detail and the brilliant indvidual acting performances make this a joy to watch. The special features too are excellent with extensive interviews from the real police and detectives as well as survivors make this special edition a must-have item for anyone who loves movies. At such a lengthy running time it zips by without you even noticing and this reviewer has watched it a number of times already since its release last year. Overall David Fincher has created a gem, easily his best work to date.
1932907009|5.0|I'm a published author who has also done some professional screenwriting. The biggest problem in fiction writing today is the lack of structure. A whole lot of writers know jack about how to create conflict and keep the story moving forward -- that is, while they write pretty prose and can meander like nobody's business, they can't write a plot to save their lives. Or if they have a forward-moving story, their characters are simply dragged along. It's no wonder that the best modern fiction book I've ever read -- The List of 7 -- is by Mark Frost, the screenwriter who gave us Twin Peaks.     Although ostensibly about how to write Hollywood blockbusters, Blake's book is one of the best I've ever read about how to create structure in stories. His section on the types of stories is genius. It's true that there are a limited number of story types that we tell, but I'd never seen them broken down this way. I compared my published stories, as well as scripts that I either optioned or that had place highly in competitions. with Blake's story types. I also compared them to his approach to story breakdown. I was totally blown away to see that they all fit. I'm now looking at my work in progress to see if it measures up and finding that Blake's insights are priceless.    The only bone I had to pick with Blake was his section about Double Mumbo Jumbo. I write a lot of horror and dark fantasy, genres that typically ask a lot of readers in terms of suspension of disbelief. I think Spider-Man is a bad example of what he's talking about, which is the inherent danger of blending genres. It's extremely hard to do well, which is why you don't see it often on screen. So, while I disagree with the example, what he's saying is absolutely true.     And while he at times conflates commercial success with critical acclaim, his intent it seems is to get the reader focussed on what's worked for the industry -- something that screenwriters really need to understand. Because unless you're writing for yourself and making your own movies, it's all part of learning about how to engage the industry. And, from what I've learned in my experience, that's critical.
B000Y7U98W|4.0|I got to agree with the earlier reviewer that stated this \\"bad science\\", which almost turned me off. Once you get over it then it is an excellent movie.  The acting was superb and intense.  Honestly, I avoid movies that feel marooned.  Fresh from the \\"Aliens\\" series genre and is a lot better then \\"Doom\\".  The constant setbacks the crews received is what kept me watching.  It is funny that this lead to another flaw in this movie as in many other movies.  Either the captain is an actor leading a mission, or makes extremely emotional decision, without looking the risk factors of his own mission.  I got to believe most military top security missions are undeviating.  A couple of crew members persuade the caption to deviate from the mission for a search and rescue mission of a lost ship of seven years, right?  The parity about science and God in the movie, is somewhat interesting.<br /><br />I have been giving blu-ray movie reviews an extra star for the great graphic and image.  Personality, high definition movies have really enhanced the watching experience.  This is one of the best looking movies I have seen on Blu-ray or HD-DVD and I have both.  Granted there are some grainy scenes, but it looked amazing on an LCD.  If I watched it on DVD, I might of rated it as a three stars movie.<br /><br />The two major flaws that I had a hard time to swallow.<br />1. The sun will outlive any human life form from my high school education. 5-6 billions more years the sun will become a red giant, which human life are either gone from the earth or found a new home elsewhere.  The sun dying in 50 years was the plot of this movie.  This could have been as embarrassing like Independent Day \\"bad science\\".  I think a scientist hacked the alien computer to let the force field down, so civilian's pilots can shot down the alien's mothership.  IBM compatible laptop can read alien programming, but pc and apple have a hard time reading each other code.<br />2. Questionable or inexperience decisions making by the captain and team members is appalling for a selective group of experts to save the earth.  It did keep the movie going.<br /><br />Overall I enjoyed this movie, even with some major flaws.  I compare it to \\"Contact\\" on term of sci-fi realism, believability.  It is easier to write about the flaws then the great aspects of the movie.  Visually comparable to \\"The Fountain\\".aptain and team members is appalling for a selective group of experts to save the earth.  It did keep the movie going.

B000FQJAIW|1.0|I'm nostalgic fan of the movies, my VHS re-issues were getting old, and needed something for \\"posterity\\". While the quality is subpar, it was great to watch it again. It was the first time I have seen the movie in 5 or 6 years. Here are the quick and dirty impressions:<br /><br />1) Bad video encode. I can't believe this is the same copy that went to laser disc. Blocky lines for fine details (like ceilings and the front of robots), and persistent \\"noise\\" over the video over all reducing crispness. I won't get all \\"black helicopters\\" here, but I've seen the laser disc copies and they wen't this bad.<br /><br />2) Missing dialog. While there are lots of scenes ethat bring back memories for me, I've always loved C3-PO telling R2-D2 to \\"switch off\\". Oddly, this was edited out in the \\"1977\\" version DVD.<br /><br />3) The re-release is now a great looking coaster.<br /><br />4) Lastly, I remember being in Virgin Megastore in the 90's and seeing the CAD versions. I had to do some digging in WikiPedia but found this:<br /><br />\\"In 1993, the Star Wars Trilogy: The Definitive Collection box set was released. This version featured the original trilogy on 9 CAV discs, widescreen transfers, THX remastering, audio commentary tracks, assorted bonus features, a copy of the hardcover book George Lucas: The Creative Impulse, and for Star Wars IV: A New Hope, a new surround sound audio mix created from elements of the 70 mm 6 track magnetic, 35 mm Dolby Stereo optical and 35 mm optical mono mixes.\\"<br /><br />These looked fantastic and looked nothing like what is on this DVD. Sigh...

B000ICL3KG|5.0|Al Gore does a terrific job at highlighting the problems and consequences that we are facing and will face if we do not turn some things around regarding the environment and global warming.  This documentary is a must see for everyone!!!  If we do not change how we are living our lives now, we are going to destroy what is left of the world and our children and granchildren won't have anywhere to live.  This movie/documentary highlights where many of the problems are in why we are not making more progress. (Politics is one example). I think everyone who watches this documentary will have their eyes opened to something they can individually do to correct this problem.

While \\"Kite Runner\\" is more about the male's role in Iraqi society, this book is about a woman's role told through two women whose lives are drawn together by circumstances far beyond their control.

From the two old grumpy guys from the balcony to Rizzo the Rat; there are classic and well-beloved characters that bring you back to your childhood and share the wonderful classic of The Christmas Carol.  The opening menu is quite funny, and several of my friends and I spent quite a bit of time just watching Kermits antics there.  The children of Miss Piggy and Kermit are cute, humorous and everything they ought to have been.  We follow Gonzo and Rizzo as they take us through the classic tale and show us the meaning of MERRY CHRISTMAS!  With hilarious scenes from Kermit ice-skating to Miss Piggy taking on Scrooge in a battle of words, this timeless tale is a must-buy and a wonderful keepsake for the generations to come.  A grand example of a G-rated movie with cleverness and excellent production value!

B000002UB3|1.0|The Technicians [& I use that term very loosely] that created the CD version should have been fired & sent back to working as shelf stackers at the local supermarket. This album has been Ruined by Technology. What more can I say,....well..Here we go...... The jewel in the crown has been desiccated by some bozo who has never listened to the original album on record or tape. Most of the songs on this album MUST run together, WITHOUT A BREAK in between, or it ruins the whole effect. It's like cutting the Mona Lisa into 5x3inch glossies to fit into your mum's Brag Book photo album. YOU JUST WOULDN'T DO IT!. Why???? Well for one thing it would be extremely foolish, & secondly you can't appreciate the whole picture when looking at tiny pieces of it. Shame on the morons who were in control & chopped this magnificent album into bits. Thank heavens I still have the original record & tape so I can hear it as it was meant to be, albeit without good sound quality. It is sad that in this day & age, we do not have the intelligence or ability to faithfully replicate a piece of music. They could do it in the sixties & the seventies with their technology, but since the eighties to the present day, humans have become incapable of such a simple task.   To anyone who has heard this album in its original form, you will be hugely disappointed by the CD version.  For those who are listening to it for the first time, you don't know how much you're missing out!   It's clear that big business really couldn't give a damn about any of us, & it's clear to see they don't consider themselves professionals when it comes to producing a CD. Maybe they should let some kid hack it back together for them - should take no more than ten minutes.  Message to Paul McCartney & Ringo Starr - How could you let this happen? Are you so embarrassed by this album, or so obscenely rich, you don't care how it sounds??????  [[ASIN:B000002UB3 Abbey Road]]
B00005JCAA|2.0|With two wonderful actors, I didn't think the movie could go wrong. Well, it did. First off, the movie was unnecessarily long. It truly didn't need to be as long as it is, it clearly drags in parts. I think if the length was shortened and some mundane pointless scenes thrown out, it would have been a pretty decent film actually. Now, the movie isn't horrible, its more of a snooze fest. Both Brad and Anthony give wonderful performances, as usual, but I just didn't feel anything. The movie is not really emotional, or dramatic, though I think it may be technically labeled a drama. It was hard to pay attention sometimes since parts of it were quite boring and felt unimportant to the story. This is one of those films that you wish was better than it really is. It has it's moments, but ultimately, its pretty bland.
0553293397|5.0|A thousand years earlier, mankind had split into two groups who now hated one another with a visceral prejudice born out of fear and a complete lack of cultural understanding of one another. Spacers, those who had seen their destiny in the stars, left earth with the assistance of positronic robot technology and colonized fifty worlds scattered throughout the galaxy. One world in particular, Solaria, was so thinly populated that the inhabitants had simply evolved away from the habit of personal contact. Birth was strictly controlled as a means of population replacement  and achieved only through artificial insemination; child rearing was managed with the assistance of robots; communication, when it was deemed necessary at all, was via 3D holographic imagery; and personal contact of any kind, let alone sexual, was considered abhorrent. The taboo was so deep-seated it was capable of provoking nausea if the topic was frivolously mentioned.<br /><br />So when a leading scientist was bludgeoned to death, the citizens of Solaria were quite incapable of even imagining that anyone other than the scientist's spouse was guilty. But since it had also been determined that she had no weapon, the only possibility that remained was that he had been killed by his own robots, a possibility that, of course, was absolutely impossible because of the three laws of robotics that governed all human-robot interaction. Solaria had no choice but to ask for Earth's assistance in solving the problem. Only an Earth detective would have the intuitive understanding of interpersonal relationships and what would prompt someone (or perhaps a robot?) to violence and murder. And it was well known from his recent performance solving the murder in \\"The Caves of Steel\\" that Detective Elijah Baley was the only detective who could stomach prolonged contact with Spacers and Robots. So Elijah Baley was on his way to the scene of the crime on Solaria.<br /><br />What an incredible novel!<br /><br />Asimov outdoes Agatha Christie herself in concocting a compelling futuristic version of the impossible \\"locked room\\" mystery whose solution is based on an understanding of the profound differences of three imagined but superbly developed cultures - two human and one robot - all of which respond in profoundly different ways to the same stimulus. He takes a page from Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's brief and has his detective quote the famous aphorism about the solution, however improbable, being all that is left after one has eliminated the impossible. Asimov takes his obvious admiration of Doyle's work one step further allowing Baley to emulate Sherlock Holmes' personal vision of justice by indulging in a debate over the distinction between legal guilt and moral guilt and how the consequences for the two ought to be quite different. And, of course, in the tried and true fashion of cozy mystery detectives ever since the first cozy mystery was written, all is revealed in a showdown drawing room setting with the master confronting all of the possible culprits as he reveals his subtle chain of logic and the now obvious solution.<br /><br />But only a master of the sci-fi genre of the caliber of Isaac Asimov could turn what might have been a mere 200 page murder mystery into a deeply moving philosophical essay on his imaginings for the future and survival of humankind and even what it means to be human.<br /><br />Highly recommended indeed for all lovers of science fiction, classic or contemporary.<br /><br />Paul Weisself in concocting a compelling futuristic version of the impossible \\"locked room\\" mystery whose solution is based on an understanding of the profound differences of three imagined but superbly developed cultures - two human and one robot - all of which respond in profoundly different ways to the same stimulus.

0375424474|5.0|Chapter I - We can make predictions and find versions of our ancesters in ancient rocks.  Fossils are easier to find if you know where to find rocks the right age and rocks of the right type.  Shubin takes us on a trip to the Canadian Arctic, looking for a specific type fossil - a transitional species between fish and amphibians that his team predicted should be found in rocks made from sediment 375 million years old.   It took them six summers of searching, but they found Tiktaalik in 2004, named with the help of local Inuit Indians.    Chapter II - We can trace similar bones all the way from fish to humans.  Be it tyrannosaurus, bat, bird, seal, or human, despite radical changes in what limbs do or look like, an underlying blueprint is in place - one bone in the upper part, two bones in the lower part, a bunch of little bones, then a series of rods.   Fish fins don't have any obvious similarities until subjected to a closer examination.  That examination shows that our basic skeleton emerged over hundreds of millions of years - first in fish, later in amphibians and reptiles, then in mammals.     Chapter III - The genetic recipe that builds organs can be followed in very different creatures.  The fertilized egg does not contain a tiny hand.  The hand is built from information contained in the DNA from that single cell.  The DNA has sets of \\"toolkit\\" genes that are remarkably similar whether you are a human, a fly, or a fish.  DNA sequences close to these toolkit genes used to be included in what was called \\"junk DNA.\\"  Now they are known to contain switches, specific to a species, that turn the toolkit genes on and off in a magnificent orchestration during embryonic development, to make the life form dictated by the DNA.  The toolkit genes are so similar among species, one lab used work in flies to find a gene in chickens that tells us about human birth defects.    Chapter IV - The biological processes that make teeth, breasts, scales, or feathers are different versions of the same process.  Thanks to their hardness, teeth are often the best preserved animal part we find in the fossil record for many time periods.  Mammal teeth are distinctly different from reptilian teeth and reveal a lot about its owner.  An excavation in this chapter uncovers another exciting fossil.    Chapter V - Skulls may not look like it but they are segmental.  The cranial nerves well known to medical students have notoriously circuitous and unlikely pathways from their origins to their end organs.  It's easy to compare them to the very ancient but more straightforward cranial nerve arrangement of sharks.   Our cranial nerve pathways are circuitous and unlikely because as functions changed and structures were modified, the nerve pathways followed suit.   Just as teeth, genes, and limbs have been repurposed over the ages, so, too, has the basic structure of our head.    Chapter VI - More about toolkit genes, body plans, and body symmetry.  Powerful evidence for a common genetic recipe for animal bodies is found when we swap genes between vastly unlike species.  Take the \\"Noggin\\" toolkit gene from a sea anemone and inject it into a frog embryo.  Result: a frog with extra back structures, the same as if the frog were injected with its own Noggin gene.    Chapter VII - Take the entire 4.5 billion-year history of the earth and scale it down to a single year with Jan 1 being the origin of the earth and midnight on December 31st being the present.  Until June, the only organisms were single-celled microbes, such as algae, bacteria, and amoebae.  The first animal with a head did not appear until October.  The first human appears on December 31.  We are recent party-crashers on earth.    Chapter VIII - Hundreds of useless olfactory genes in our DNA are left over from ancestors who used them.  They become more and more dissimilar  as we compare them with the olfactory genes of more and more primitive creatures.  That baggage is a silent witness to our past.Chapter IX - Our camera-like eye is common to every creature with a skull.  Insects, humans, clams, and scallops all use the same light-capturing molecule.  We have good evidence these molecules came directly from bacteria that used them for another purpose.  The toolkit gene Pax 6 controls the development of eyes in every creature that has eyes.  The mouse equivalent of the Pax 6 gene has been activated in various spots on a fly, for example, on the fly's leg.  The mouse gene produces a new eye at that spot - and not just any eye - a fly eye.      Chapter X - The ear is a remarkable Rube Goldberg apparatus.  There is a beautiful transitional series from reptiles to mammals showing that the malleus and the incus of mammals' middle ears evolved from bones set in the back of the jaws of reptiles.  But it doesn't stop there.  Genes responsible for our ears can be traced back to jellyfish.    Chapter XI - Our fish to human framework is so strongly supported scientists no longer try to marshall evidence for it.  The exercise is like peeling an onion, exposing layer after layer of history.  The pattern of descent with modification is deeply etched inside our bodies, and is matched by the geological record.  The jerry-rigging from being forced to use remanufactured parts has resulted in a less than perfect product - hiccups, hernias, back pain, joints that don't last long enough, and sleep apnea - to name a few.      Shubin's writing is uncomplicated and clear - perfect for anyone regardless of their state of literacy in the sciences, and refreshingly unblemished by any suggestions of controversy.   I recommend it highly.

B00008973A|3.0|I've never seen this on stage so I can't compare the film to the original production.  I can imagine that it must have been dazzling at the time.  The concept of introducing the dancers as real people is great and enables us to care about them over and beyond their ability to dance.  The whole Broadway mystique is evoked and one is amazed at the sacrifices these people make for the love of dance and the theater.    Most of the cast was good.  I can understand that the choices were for excellent dancers, first, then some singing ability and some looks and personality, plus a diversity of sexes, ethnic groups etc.  They managed to come up with a pretty good group although I did find some of them forgettable.  I thought Michael Douglas was actually quite good as the hyper-talented but bastardly choreographer.     The weak spot in the film was the character of Cassie, who plays a central part in the story.  She is a great dancer and can sing well enough but has no charisma and is generally painful to watch (especially in the flashback scenes in which she has really horrible hair!)  One has a hard time imagining Michael Douglas in love with her.  If a more sympathetic or attractive woman had filled that role, the whole film would have had more sparkle.     I think that a major attraction for the musical was its novelty--a style that was breakthrough at the time but it which has been imitated so frequently that by now, unless it's done really well, it's a bit lackluster.  I think diehard dance fans will enjoy it more than the general public.
0345440900|5.0|This book was sent to me by a friend who had used the technique for getting your baby to sleep on her own successfully.  Although I found the tone of the book written to be rather annoying, there were three things in it which I cannot be thankful enough for having read:    -How to read your baby's signs and understand him or her as an individual and not just a big crying blob.  -How to get your baby to be laid down awake in the crib and have him/her fall asleep on their own, without having to resort to the \\"cry it out\\" method.  So that they feel safe and secure in their crib, with no phobias, so that you don't have to be pacing around with them to get them to fall asleep, or feed her every time she wakes up because it is the only way they know how to sleep.  -How to avoid setting your baby up for bad habits which you will regret down the line, and how to change ones you have inadvertedly created in a manner that will ease your baby into it, so they don't withdraw or feel shocked by the change.    Absolutely indispensable for me those first few months of life.
0307388840|5.0|Atonement is without a doubt one of the best books I've ever read.  It's right up there with Jane Eyre, Farewell to Arms, To Kill a Mockingbird. McEwan's masterpiece is divided into 3 main parts: the manor house and crime, the war in Belgium/France, and finally London. An epilogue covers modern time.  Atonement is a story of unbelievable betrayals- the rape of a child, war, backstabbing relatives, all offset by the only thing that can overcome such horrors- love.  The writing is achingly vivid and there are many memorable scenes. McEwan is so descriptive of simple things- the multi-colored IV drip bags in the hospital are suspended like \\"exotic fruits.\\" But there are also clever twists, especially surrounding the imaginative young writer, Briony. In the final pages, even the reader feels betrayed by the so-called atonement of Briony. But upon examining the facts, you realize you already knew the truth, just like the characters aware of the original crime at the manor house. The entire affect is complex and mesmerizing! McEwan is truly a genius!
B00006I53S|3.0|I have been using this lens for five years, and have probably taken over 1000 photographs with it, film and full-frame digital, with sky filters, colored filters for black & white film, and polarizing filters as appropriate. As time has passed, I find that I use it less and less, because I can almost always get better results with something else.<br /><br />I have often found a kind of harsh contrast to the photographs I take with this lens. When using it, I have to be particularly diligent about lighting as a result. Zoom is convenient for composing but the camera is not optimal for controlling distracting backgrounds; this lens is certainly not appropriate for portraits.<br /><br />Only once did I get pictures with this lens that were much better than I expected, when handheld photos at maximum zoom on slow film in a dark temple came out perfectly. That's entirely a credit to the image stabilizer.<br /><br />Nowadays, I regard this as a snapshot lens; as such, it's often superseded by a point-and-shoot camera which takes pictures almost as well and is a lot easier to carry around.

B0013FXWU6|5.0|I watched this movie after reading that Daniel Day Lewis won a Best Actor Oscar for his performance as ruthless oilman Daniel Plainview. It is not often that I get mesmerised by a single actor's performance, but Daniel Day Lewis' performance in There Will Be Blood truly had me riveted from start to finish, not an easy feat given the movie's 2.5 hours length. It was an amazing performance filled with depth and emotion.<br /><br />There Will Be Blood traces the rise of Daniel Plainview, a miner who soon discovers more lucrative prospects in oil. He also finds himself adopting an orphaned infant boy whom he raises as his own. The boy, H.W. [played as a kid by Dillon Freasier] is 'used' to promote Plainview's own interests by picturing him as a wholesome, family-oriented man, despite the lack of a wife by his side. Plainview zealously goes about securing mineral lease rights and his fortunes take a turn for the better when a young man named Paul Sunday [Paul Dano] shows up in his office one day claiming to know the whereabouts of an oil-rich territory in exchange for a sum of money.<br /><br />So Daniel and his son go to Little Boston, CA and not only do they strike gold in the discovery of oil but it sets the stage for an enduring conflict between Plainview and Eli Sunday [Paul Dano again], an evangelist who tries to rival Plainview for the leadership of the community, but of course Plainview is having none of that - he doesn't like sharing anything.<br /><br />Paul Dano's performance as the overly-religious Eli Sunday is filled with a simmering fervour that releases itself into loud exhortations to God and yes, Plainview and I would say that these two actors, Day Lewis and Dano are the real reasons to watch this movie. Their conflict and animosity towards each other is apparent from the first time they meet and it only gets worse as time progresses.<br /><br />The story of There Will Be Blood is multi-faceted and complex and we see how Daniel's character evolves from a simple, hardworking miner and loving dad into a ruthless businessman who acts out in violence when he is crossed and spirals into self-destruction, losing him truly precious things along the way, such as friendship and most importantly his close bond with his adopted son.<br /><br />Powerful performances, a well-plotted storyline and masterful direction by Paul Thomas Anderson - a must-watch!loving dad into a ruthless businessman who acts out in violence when he is crossed and spirals into self-destruction, losing him truly precious things along the way, such as friendship and most importantly his close bond with his adopted son.

B000R6PKP2|5.0|After seeing this box set announced a while back, I thought it would be an awesome set to get ahold of. I expected it to be priced out of my reach, so on seeing it at this surprisingly affordable pricepoint I had to jump.  When I received the package, it didn't take me long to realise that I should probably have bought the [[ASIN:B000UBMWG4 Blade Runner (Five-Disc Complete Collector's Edition) [Blu-ray]]] instead.  Why's that?  Unless you a HUGE fan of BladeRunner, you are unlikely to get much real value out of the other items included in this package.  The complete collectors edition contains the same 5 discs of content, the only difference is the briefcase and the accessories within it.    Do I regret buying this? only insofar as I spent money that I didn't need to. I'm a fan of BladeRunner, and having these 5 discs of content is great for me. But I am not so much of a fan that I feel that the extra expense was justified.    The video is amazing, but you can get that in the complete collection set.  The extra items included in this set will be justified by some people, but for me it's probably just gonna sit on a shelf.

B0011HOEY4|5.0|[[ASIN:B0011HOEY4 American Gangster 2-Disc Unrated Extended Edition]]<br /><br />In American Gangster Ridley Scott has created the perfect storm of an American movie masterpiece.  An amazing group of actors, headlined by Denzel Washington and Russel Crowe, produces a very convincing period piece of 1970s New Jersey and New York and the crime culture that existed there.  It's hard to feel anything but shame watchig this movie.  This movie is both believable and tragic, and it startles me that neither Crowe nor Washington received nominations for two incredible performances.<br /><br />The Story and the Script<br /><br />The story is supposed to be based on the real life exploits of Frank Lucas.  Movies like this usually exaggerate.  The fact that this movie is so believable makes it all the more tragic.  There are no black and white characters and we are left to choose between murdering drug pushers and crooked cops.<br /><br />The writing and the story structure are both excellent.  The plot is developed slowly and masterfully.  While there is less shooting and action than one would expect from such a tale, the movie is filled with drama and suspense.<br /><br />Cinematography<br /><br />They have managed to create a period piece here that is beautiful, gritty, real and romanticized.  The framing of the actors and the skylines are beautiful.  Much of the scenery and shots are darkly lit.  This is most often used in the scenes with the police in their shadowy research rooms, clearly to juxtapose them against the Lucas empire, almost always shown in the light.<br /><br />The first disk in the unrated edition is in a beautiful widescreen.  Don't know why they list this as full-screen, perhaps because there is a full screen version available on the other side.  The<br /><br />Acting and Direction<br /><br />I don't know whether it's award winning acting or directing that makes the end result so good, but I would be willing to guess that it's both. Denzel is steady and appears to be taking on a similar persona in his recent films.  Crowe is more fantastic than even his normal performance, portraying the troubled police investigator caught between a crime ridden New York / New Jersey and the even more criminal Special Investigative Unit.<br /><br />All the acting is great, and this movie could easily have won for best ensemble cast.  Josh Brolin is solid in a limited though well executed part.  The directing is textbook mastery.<br /><br />Bottom line, this movie should have gotten nominated for best actor, best supporting actor, best direction and best picture.  It probably should have one a few of those categories.  Michael Clayton, Eastern Promises?

I just wish the soundtrack was available for this new version.  The music was so beautiful.  I enjoyed the music as much as I enjoyed the soundtrack to the Keira Knightly version of Pride and Prejudice.      Does anyone know if a soundtrack is in the works?  As I know the Colin Firth version of Pride and Prejudice has a soundtrack so I know sometimes they do make them for made for TV films.
B000Y7U98C|3.0|The fate of the universe rests on the shoulders of a small crew of surprisingly young and good looking scientists. They must deliver their payload - a giant nuclear weapon - directly to the center of the sun. Theirs is the second such mission and there is neither time nor resources available to send a third; without the success of their mission, the fading sun will die. They try to make their way to the sun without burning up to drop off the bomb, but things start to go wrong.     This story was pretty creative. I liked it from the major premise down to the details of the ship that was taking them to the sun. It had been a long time since I had seen a sci-fi thriller like this, and I think it is safe to admit that it is a genre of film I enjoy. The only concern I would have is originality.     While I feel there was a lot of originality in Sunshine, this movie was eerily similar to [[ASIN:B000E1NXAY Event Horizon]]. I think they are different enough to enjoy separately, but alike enough that you won't be able to watch them back-to-back.     I thought the makers did a great job casting this film. They took some names and faces which are just beyond the reach of mainstream. Desipite any possible similarities to other sci-fi movies that take place in a futuristic outer space, I liked Sunshine.
B0010358EE|4.0|The visuals are nothing short of stunning, especially in HD. It's worth the download just to check out how beautifully the cg animation is rendered. The action scenes are tight, with Matrix-esque slow motion shots, crazy camera angles and an emphasis on heavy gun play, indicative of producer John Woo's style. One drawback on the cg animation though is that when characters interact with each other physically it seems awkward. They don't feel like they are touching. I imagine that when you make something with animation like that you'd run into clipping issues when the characters intereact heavily. In fact, it reminded me of cut scenes from Eternal Sonata, a video game using similar animation techniques but on a bigger scale obviously.    The story is an upgrade from the first movie, although the main antagonist borrows heavily from classic Star Trek villain, the Borg. There's even a Borg like cube of sorts that serves as it's foundation. The subplot consists of a triangle between Deunan, Briareos (the main protagonists from the first movie) and Tereus, a biroid created mostly from Briareos's DNA who becomes Deunan's new partner after her lover falls in battle.    If I were to make a criticism I'd say that the main antagonist was revealed a tad too late, making the final resolution a little anti-climactic. At a runtime of about an hour and 40 minutes I felt like another 20 minutes would have been justified. When it was over, I couldn't quite believe it at first. Also, and this may be a good thing, events from the first movie go almost completely without mention. This means that you won't have to have seen the first one to appreciate this, but at the same time there is a lack of continuity for those that did.    All in all though, it's a good film and worth a watch.

All he says is really right in front of our noses, many of us have just forgotten and need this refresher course. Tolle is truly gifted at bringing it to us in a very simple easily digested fashion.<br /><br />For me it is a creative compilation of all that I have studied over the years (a few: Jesus, Buddha, Lao-tzu and the 81 vs if the Tao Te Ching, Caroline Myss, etc. so many over the years) as I have searched for Life's meaning. It will teach you practical ways to just \\"Be\\". Awe, the rat race is over for me! I think this book should be required reading for our youths. If you are a parent, buy and read this book and learn how to \\"live\\", \\"be\\". By living you will teach your precious children. Our children are not being taught how to just \\"be\\" and our medical profession is drugging them to numb them. It's ok to feel, to be. Don't sell your soul or your children's soul to medication.<br /><br />My favorite quote is this:<br /><br />One thing we do know: Life will give you whatever experience is most helpful for the evolution of your consciousness.
0743298039|3.0|The Thirteenth Tale provided exactly what I was looking for in a novel -  easy, entertaining and enjoyable.  Not great literature, but a good read.
B000BB1MI2|5.0|This is an insane movie, and I mean that in a good way.  First, it was crazy to even think about remaking one of the most wonderful screen adaptations ever.  Second, it was crazy to think about using Johnny Depp for the role defined by Gene Wilder--sort of like having Prince fill in for Syd Barrett.  Third, it was crazy to combine an increased literalism (betokened by the reversion to Dahl's title) with the addition of a new plot and a totally different ending.<br /><br />Insanity works.  Not only Depp's wonderful performance, but the crazy additional subplot.  Instead of Dahl's rather flat quirky mad/cute scientist, or Wilder's razor-edge kind lunacy, we see a Wonka who is attempting to transcend the oppositions of his childhood while remaining a child.  Without the egregious sappiness of Peter Pan, C&TC shows the tortured relations between child and parent.<br /><br />And of course, brushing teeth, like other forms of personal hygiene, is in fact often the center of conflict.  This is banal but it can represent the most fundamental oppositions to the child:  duty vs. pleasure, child vs. adult, toothpaste vs. candy.  C&TC took this and milked it for all it was worth.  In a Dahlian fashion, they spun it out of control without going for any emotional distance, and it throws you for a loop.  You think the movie is winding up as expected and it takes a sharp turn.  It's like a second mini-movie.<br /><br />Because it is a serious question:  if you are a grown up kid in a candy factory, do you have any teeth left?  Should you?  Or does the true confectioner sacrifice his own teeth for the art?  OK, maybe not, but who is going to make you brush?  The Oompah Loompahs?  Does someone have to make you brush?  And if not, should your successor be a brusher?  There are only two ways to go...or so it seems.<br /><br />Finally, there is less here than the original about industrial espionage.  That does seem to work, but I thought that this theme gave the first movie a bit more \\"go.\\"  And, in a weird way, a bit more realism. [31]a bit more realism. [31]
0895260131|5.0|Zahra Maladan is an educated woman who edits a women's magazine in Lebanon. She is also a mother, who undoubtedly loves her son. She has ambitions for him, but they are different from those of most mothers in the West. She wants her son to become a suicide bomber.<br /><br />At the recent funeral for the assassinated Hezbollah terrorist Imad Moughnaya -- the mass murderer responsible for killing 241 marines in 1983 and more than 100 women, children and men in Buenos Aires in 1992 and 1994 -- Ms. Maladan was quoted in the New York Times giving the following warning to her son: \\"if you're not going to follow the steps of the Islamic resistance martyrs, then I don't want you.\\"<br />[Worshippers of Death]<br /><br />Zahra Maladan represents a dramatic shift in the way we must fight to protect our citizens against enemies who are sworn to kill them by killing themselves. The traditional paradigm was that mothers who love their children want them to live in peace, marry and produce grandchildren. Women in general, and mothers in particular, were seen as a counterweight to male belligerence. The picture of the mother weeping as her son is led off to battle -- even a just battle -- has been a constant and powerful image.<br /><br />Now there is a new image of mothers urging their children to die, and then celebrating the martyrdom of their suicidal sons and daughters by distributing sweets and singing wedding songs. More and more young women -- some married with infant children -- are strapping bombs to their (sometimes pregnant) bellies, because they have been taught to love death rather than life. Look at what is being preached by some influential Islamic leaders:<br /><br />\\"We are going to win, because they love life and we love death,\\" said Hassan Nasrallah, the leader of Hezbollah. He has also said: \\"[E]ach of us lives his days and nights hoping more than anything to be killed for the sake of Allah.\\" Shortly after 9/11, Osama bin Laden told a reporter: \\"We love death.The U.S. loves life. That is the big difference between us.\\"<br /><br />\\"The Americans love Pepsi-Cola, we love death,\\" explained Afghani al Qaeda operative Maulana Inyadullah. Sheik Feiz Mohammed, leader of the Global Islamic Youth Center in Sydney, Australia, preached: \\"We want to have children and offer them as soldiers defending Islam. Teach them this: There is nothing more beloved to me than wanting to die as a mujahid.\\" Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said in a speech: \\"It is the zenith of honor for a man, a young person, boy or girl, to be prepared to sacrifice his life in order to serve the interests of his nation and his religion.\\"<br /><br />How should Western democracies fight against an enemy whose leaders preach a preference for death?<br /><br />The two basic premises of conventional warfare have long been that soldiers and civilians prefer living to dying and can thus be deterred from killing by the fear of being killed; and that combatants (soldiers) can easily be distinguished from noncombatants (women, children, the elderly, the infirm and other ordinary citizens). These premises are being challenged by women like Zahra Maladan. Neither she nor her son -- if he listens to his mother -- can be deterred from killing by the fear of being killed. They must be prevented from succeeding in their ghoulish quest for martyrdom. Prevention, however, carries a high risk of error. The woman walking toward the group of soldiers or civilians might well be an innocent civilian. A moment's hesitation may cost innocent lives. But a failure to hesitate may also have a price.<br /><br />Late last month, a young female bomber was shot as she approached some shops in central Baghdad. The Iraqi soldier who drew his gun hesitated as the bomber, hands raised, insisted that she wasn't armed. The soldier and a shop owner finally opened fire as she dashed for the stores; she was knocked to the ground but still managed to detonate the bomb, killing three and wounding eight. Had the soldier and other bystanders not called out a warning to others -- and had they not shot her before she could enter the shops -- the death toll certainly would have been higher. Had he not hesitated, it might have been lower.<br /><br />As more women and children are recruited by their mothers and their religious leaders to become suicide bombers, more women and children will be shot at -- some mistakenly. That too is part of the grand plan of our enemies. They want us to kill their civilians, who they also consider martyrs, because when we accidentally kill a civilian, they win in the court of public opinion. One Western diplomat called this the \\"harsh arithmetic of pain,\\" whereby civilian casualties on both sides \\"play in their favor.\\" Democracies lose, both politically and emotionally, when they kill civilians, even inadvertently. As Golda Meir once put it: \\"We can perhaps someday forgive you for killing our children, but we cannot forgive you for making us kill your children.\\"<br /><br />Civilian casualties also increase when terrorists operate from within civilian enclaves and hide behind human shields. This relatively new phenomenon undercuts the second basic premise of conventional warfare: Combatants can easily be distinguished from noncombatants. Has Zahra Maladan become a combatant by urging her son to blow himself up? Have the religious leaders who preach a culture of death lost their status as noncombatants? What about \\"civilians\\" who willingly allow themselves to be used as human shields? Or their homes as launching pads for terrorist rockets?<br /><br />The traditional sharp distinction between soldiers in uniform and civilians in nonmilitary garb has given way to a continuum. At the more civilian end are babies and true noncombatants; at the more military end are the religious leaders who incite mass murder; in the middle are ordinary citizens who facilitate, finance or encourage terrorism. There are no hard and fast lines of demarcation, and mistakesare inevitable -- as the terrorists well understand.<br /><br />We need new rules, strategies and tactics to deal effectively and fairly with these dangerous new realities. We cannot simply wait until the son of Zahra Maladan -- and the sons and daughters of hundreds of others like her -- decide to follow his mother's demand. We must stop them before they export their sick and dangerous culture of death to our shores...the battle rages on...lets hope for the Arab spring?
B000RJO578|5.0|Officer Nicholas Angel (Simon Pegg) is London's top police officer.  He's the best at everything he does and in just a few years on the force has achieved more than the rest of the department put together.  He's an excellent officer, but is so good that he's making everyone around him look bad.  He's given a promotion that virtually exiles him to the sleepy, dreamy village of Sandford.  He's assigned Danny Butterman (Nick Frost) as his partner, a junior officer and son of the local police chief, Frank Butterman (Jim Broadbent).  Everything appears to be quiet in the small village until a couple of local actors are found decapitated.  Their deaths are ruled an accident, but Angel thinks there's something more going and soon discovers that the residents of the sleepy little village are hiding a dark secret.<br /><br />HOT FUZZ begins like a typical comical mystery movie.  There are some elements that are purposely overdone for comic effect, but the film still retains an aura of mystery and suspense.  That is until the last twenty-minutes of the movie. That's when the action-factor of the film kicks into high gear as well as humor meter.  When I saw HOT FUZZ for the first time, I was laughing so hard during the last part of the movie that there were a few times I had a hard time breathing.  In my opinion, the movie is the funniest film released in 2007.<br /><br />Recommended for anyone who liked SHAUN OF THE DEAD, people who like action movies, and anyone with a decent sense of humor.

B0013D8LOU|5.0|After serving time abroad for a crime he didn't commit, barber Benjamin Barker (Johnny Depp) returns to London under the new name of Sweeney Todd to find out what has happened to his wife and child.  He's told that his wife died and his daughter has been placed under the guardianship of the man who set him up and sent him away, Judge Turpin (Alan Rickman).  Todd swears revenge. He makes the acquaintance of Mrs. Lovett (Helena Bonham Carter), a woman who makes \\"the worst pies in London\\" and who has taken up residence in the building that Todd's family once lived and worked.  He sets out seeking his revenge on the judge, but along the way is distracted by a showman barber, Signor Adolfo Pirelli (Sacha Baron Cohen).  Todd challenges Pirelli to a barber's duel and after he loses, Pirelli threatens to reveal Todd's true identity.  With the assistance of Mrs. Lovett, the final exchange between Pirelli and Todd sets Todd on a bloody course of destruction that ultimately leads to a tragic end.<br /><br />SWEENEY TODD isn't your usual musical.  Blood freely gushing as Mr. Todd takes his revenge upon his various victims.  Mrs. Lovett's place becomes a booming business and her pies become the tastiest in town after she begins butchering Sweeney's victims and using them as meat.  There are some who will be taken back by the violence and there are others who may find that such a brutal subject is not worthy of a musical.<br /><br />Before watching the film, I wasn't sure if I was going to like SWEENEY TODD or not. I really enjoy Tim Burton's films and even though I knew the basic plot of the story, I was unfamiliar with Sondheim's music and didn't know how well it would stand up on screen.  Despite the subject matter, I thought SWEENEY TODD was an excellent musical.  I didn't mind the violence and enjoyed the dark humor scattered throughout.  Johnny Depp is wonderful as ever as Sweeney Todd; he's an extremely talented actor, but this is the first film I've seen where he sings and he sings well.  I also enjoyed the performances of Alan Rickman as Judge Turpin and Timothy Spall as Beadle Bamford.  The costumes and settings are superb and provide a general mood full of gloom and doom, only sporadically broken with brilliant colors of life either from dripping blood or by the love story between Todd's daughter, Johanna (Jayne Wisener) and Todd's young friend Anthony Hope (Jamie Campbell Bower).<br /><br />Overall, SWEENEY TODD is a tragic musical that fans of the genre will probably enjoy watching and if you're squeamish just close your eyes when you see those silver blades unleashed.I also enjoyed the performances of Alan Rickman as Judge Turpin and Timothy Spall as Beadle Bamford.

B000ZN8036|4.0|This film based on the book was done somewhat well. It was not all it could have been. This film should have been made years ago. While this was very faithful to the book it somehow lacks some of the emotional soul this story needs. The book lets you know on the cover that he died. Knowing this is what makes the book excellent. This is not some thriller that needs a gotcha ending. Knowing he dies from jump gives more weight and gravity to everything he does while you read the book. The film should have been told the same way.<br /><br />Penn employed too many nifty tricks to bring points across that could have been implied or inferred more subtly far better by a more skilled filmmaker. The MTV style film making was not needed. Simple ground level hand held up close and personal camera work would have been the best way to go. In this film you experience the wild like a bird, far too often. Supertramp himself never saw what we see in this film.<br /><br />Penn also could not resist putting his liberal stink all over this film. It's too bad too. The book never read like parts of the film do. The book never had an agenda, nor did Chris, beyond his simple soul searching. penn, I know and can tell, hopes to change the world into a Robin Hood free for all. Chris may have made choices such as burning money, abandoning his car, and such. They were personal statements and his ego had nothing to do with it. He was making the statements to himself, not like Penn loves to do, showing off to the world.<br /><br />I do not remember so much animosity towards the parents in the book. I do not know that that was the best way to show his drive to do what he did. Everyone has nutty parents. They don't get us kids with handbooks. The whole, \\"my parents fought and yelled so i have problems\\" is wearing a bit thin in our society. This irked me a bit. Even if it was true, that he did have resentment for his folks, it was still unnecessary for so much of it to be peppered throughout the story as if it was the very impetus for him to run. He was not running from anything, he was running TO something. I am not sure Penn understands that. In the book it was clear.<br /><br />The best film of this type, and also one of the best films ever is \\"Never Cry Wolf\\". It shows, without too much conflict, death, or preachy talking, exactly what the wild can be like.<br /><br />Into The Wild is a few notches  below Never Cry Wolf and also extremely sad. Sad is not a bad thing but I could not just pop this in every so often. Never Cry Wolf  I can watch over and over and over. Anyone who enjoyed this film will love Never Cry Wolf .<br /><br />Despite all of the above, this film was far more thoughtful and important than 98% of the junk that gets made. It was overlooked and needed to be considered a more important film this year. I hope more films like this get made in the future. This film falling a bit short of perfect, is to me, still way better than most films.y impetus for him to run. He was not running from anything, he was running TO something.

B00005OAA6|5.0|Victoria Beckham/Posh Spice was always my favorite member of the Spice Girls.  I also thought she was the most attractive out of all of them too!  Well it just so happens that her solo debut album is the best solo debut out of all the Spice Girls!  I like every song, especially \\"Not Such An Innocent Girl\\" and \\"A Mind of It's Own\\", both hits in England.  The songs on this album are well written and she sounds great! I don't know why a lot of people say she can't sing, I think she has a good voice.  I think she deserved more solos when she was with the Spice Girls.  So anyway if you're a Spice Girls fan or like Posh you'll like this album like I did. It's definately worth the price!

B0012K1ILW|5.0|It only took one listen to \\"Me\\" and I was hooked.  I like this new direction and sound from Erykah, which demonstrates her unique and independent thoughts and sounds in an artful manner.  This album definitely strays away from the Erykah releases of the past.  I haven't had a chance to listen to every track on the album and that may take awhile since I haven't stopped listening and enjoying \\"Me\\", which has a jazzy mezmerizing beat accompanied by jazz trumpeter Roy Hargrove.  I have listened to \\"Telephone\\", which also has a really nice, rich bass sound underscored by Erykah's soft and inspirational lyrics dedicated to Dilla (see CD jacket information for more details).  This CD so far is great to me; however, it may not be for everyone, and especially those seeking the same old or not very accepting of an artist exploring new ground.  It is definitely not for listeners with narrow musical interest or those that tend to lean toward one musical genre.  I am prepared and ready for Part Two and hope it also contains jazz, rock, funk and R&B elements.
B000RJO578|1.0|I am perplexed as to why Hot Fuzz is earning such praise when it is only mildly amusing at best. Some of the funniest jokes in the movie play dead on funny, but the same tired joke being played again and again for more yuks just gets on people's nerves (\\"so what is it that makes you think this is a murder??!\\")The movie reeks of unoriginality from the getgo save for the city supercop transferred to the idyllic countryside, yet even that premise gets weak if it is the only avenue for jokes, as is mostly the case in Hot Fuzz. It's as if the writers had an idea for a short film of 30 minutes and stretched it out another additional hour. I'm sorry for being a naysayer, but even if a movie's main premise is slightly different than the norm, a good film still needs to deliver a whole lot more, and Hot Fuzz simply doesn't. After the near perfect Shaun of the Dead, I am quite disappointed. 1.5 stars
B000YXMMAE|3.0|I'm a pretty big Radiohead fan so writing this review took serious consideration.  I remember when my NYC friend called me about the album downloading concept the night it happened.  I tried logging on but as everyone knows their server crashed that first night.  Anyways I got the album the following week (I paid $1 because I planned to buy it in its physical form).      Right after the first listen I knew it wasn't their best, but still not their worst (Amnesiac).  'The Bends,' 'Kid A,' and 'OK Computer' are albums that you know are great after just one listen.  Those are the albums that gave Radiohead the reputation they have today, which is why they could release anything, no matter how terrible (Amnesiac), and it will still receive positive reviews.      In Rainbows is a good listen for an old fan but not for anyone looking to get into Radiohead.  I'm very interested in seeing whether or not they continue as a band because I personally think they've reached their limit and anything after this could degrade their prestige.  But maybe that's what they need since every living hipster seems to think Radiohead are The Beatles times infinity.
B0012K1ILW|1.0|If you purchase this CD, you are purchasing it for the great artwork on the covers only!  The Badu crew should have spent much more time on the music, rather than on the artwork. Can't wait to give this CD away!
1582701709|1.0|1. The concept (Law of attraction) is not new. Among many others, Yogananda expounds it in his \\"Autobiography of a Yogi\\" written in 1946.  2. There are contradictions by the self-professed \\"experts.\\" One says the best way to make your wishes come true is to write them down. Another says the \\"secret\\" cannot be expressed in words. Another contradiction is that the film claims the \\"secret\\" was kept from the masses by those in the know. It then quotes Henry Ford's famous saying, \\"Think you can, think you can't. Either way, you're right.\\" So much for keeping \\"it\\" secret.    3. Except for Jack Kornfield, most of the \\"experts\\" are simply huge egos. Imagine billing yourself as a \\"Visionary\\" on your resume!    4. The book is MUCH more materialistic than spiritual.    5. Deeply flawed. NOT RECOMMENDED.
0439813786|5.0|My 6 year old thoroughly enjoyed this book (I enjoyed reading it to him too!).  The pictures interspersed with the text kept him engaged and we finished the book in 2 days. My son wanted to keep reading during every possible free moment until we finished.  If you know how active my son is, you would understand how incredible it was that he would want to spend his free time reading.  Highly recommended!
B0000028P8|5.0|This album is of course Mariah letting the world know her voice was not manufactured and that it was really her voice. While I do think it is a tiny bit overrated it is still essential for any Mariah fan. Her voclas were especially amazing on I'LL BE THERE. VISION OF LOVE  and CANT LET GO are others she sang extremely well. Highly recommended!
B000J5XS3C|5.0|I bought this used for $30 + shipping. I couldn't be happier! It came in and worked wonders! For the price of a couple dvds, you get a mixer that owns up to the behringer name and performs as well as the bigger guys. Its pretty small (a little less than a foot long, and probably 8 inches wide) but you can plug 2 xlr microphones into it, and if you have microphones with a 1/4\\" adapter, you can plug more in. The phantom power is a big plus as well.     If you're on a small budget but want a powerful mixer, this is for you!

Somehow even though the subject matter is a familiar and heartbreaking one, this book is fresh and offers an interesting perspective.  So well written, it hooks you right away.  Get it for yourself and your (mature) teen.  (and your dad)
1400077915|5.0|I would relate Munro's writing to the gothic chant of the literary world, no embellishments, no extraneous similes or metaphors, just simple, profoundly moving storytelling. I've read the first story in the collection (for which the collection is named), approximately ten times, and each time it affects me differently.     I think all authors, both short story writers and novelists, should study Munro, and learn from her. She's truly the Faulkner of our times...
B000Y179KO|3.0|This a good CD from The Eagles, there isn't anything that outstanding that clamors for a higher rating.<br /><br />Using the CD with the iPod mix for The Eagles seems to work better than just listening to the CD on its own merits.<br /><br />I would have likes to have an all-time classic on the CD but I am not disappointed.

B0014D6PCO|5.0|ABSOLUTELY!   I am not a fan of the Dark Knight. While I have read some of the comics and seen the earlier movies the overall storyline never snagged an interest in me UNTIL BATMAN BEGINS!   This film is so impressive that I am simply dumbstruck. The director deserves a medal for one of the most telling storylines of the entire saga, comic book or other media, ever. Within the narrow window of the   movie's timeline the evolution of the character is very well presented and provides an excellent introduction to the inherent attitude that drives Batman, a man possessed.   It is the nature of that possession and its power which enables and emboldens the character and which is so well defined within this movie.  I can only summarized this film as a Tim Burton meets Rambo extravaganza!  Definitely watch it several times!
0671027344|5.0|High school is a milestone in everyone's life. In Stephen Chbosky's The Perks Of Being A Wallflower, many of the dynamics people face throughout their high school career surface, as the life of a teenage boy is unfolded. Charlie guides you through his teen years through the unusual method of using letters addressed to an unknown person. Through these letters the reader is introduced to the thoughts going through Charlie's head and what is going on in his life. A friend who highly recommended it turned me onto this book. It's a fairly quick read and hard to put down.   Charlie is the reason this book is so enjoyable. At first he seems to be an average high school student who isn't popular or perfect by any means. He's shy and somewhat introverted, while trying to cope with the suicide of his friend, growing apart from people he used to know and family turmoil. However, after getting to know him more, his personality is enjoyable, comical and sometimes witty making the letters fun to read.  One of the major aspects of the book is growing and maintaining relationships. Charlie meets brother and sister seniors, and soon to be his best friends, Patrick and Sam at a football game. Through spending time with them they forge a solid friendship and Charlie is introduced to friends of Patrick and Sam, making mutual friends. As the letters go on Charlie tells of inter-friendship crushes and arguments, and dealing with trying to hold things together.   Charlie also has to deal with his siblings, an older brother away at college and a melodramatic sister, who is also a senior in high school. He watches his sister go through relationships, break-ups, apologies, and regrets, all while trying to figure out all these components in his own life.   The way Chbosky describes so well dealing with first crushes, second chances, questioning yourself, fitting in, and the time period of being on the brink of adulthood and at the same time brings a sense of belonging through his writing is admirable and well worth the time taken to read this novel.
B0011NVC98|2.0|When I heard that a full-length motion picture with an all-star cast was going to be created based on the epic poem Beowulf, I was very excited. I was hoping that a large budget and superb actors would be able to bring to life this classic of Old English literature. The poem Beowulf was truly a classic story portraying life in the heroic age, showing all that was good and all that was flawed in us humans in a time of change, when the old pagan ways were changing but still breathing. When the cult of the warrior was a way of life and death. I was hoping that the movie Beowulf would be able to bring this story to light and be able to bring it to modern viewers so that they could understand the heroic and also tragic worldview of the times. I was sorely mistaken.    The writers of the screenplay only very loosely based their movie on the actual poem. In fact, it seemed like after the first 30 minutes or so, the writers stopped bothering to attempt to keep true to the original, and finished the poem by reading the Cliffs Notes version of the story and couldn't be bothered with finishing reading the actual work. What a shame.    In their attempts to make the movie more 'Hollywood', they botched the story so much that the true sense and feeling of the original was totally lost.    The original was a masterpiece, and if they had stuck to the original storyline, this would have been a MUCH better movie. Instead, they made the characters mere shells of their former selves. I should have known in the first few minutes when I saw how they turned King Hrothgar (a wise and honorable king in the original) into a whoremongering Viagra-induced fool. The Queen became an weak woman with adultery on her mind. And of course Beowulf himself, who was made much less a hero and more a liar who told half-truths in order to win fame and eventually become king.    The creators of this movie must have thought that by introducing a love interest between Beowulf and King Hrothgar's Queen (something not in the original), it would be more interesting to females, but all it did was make the movie dull, quaint, something FAR SHORT OF HEROIC.     Then, Hollywood did the unimaginable. Instead of having Beowulf defeat Grendel's mother after defeating the son, they concocted a storyline where Beowulf has sexual relations with Grendel's mother after killing her son, only to hide it from the Danes and become king with everyone thinking she was dead, only to have the son of Beowulf and Grendel's mother come back many years later to once again terrorize Denmark in the form of a dragon. While there was a dragon in the original, it was not Beowulf's son, and Grendel's mother certainly was not around.    I guess they thought that a computer-animated version of Angelina Jolie (Grendel's mother) in full nude would be enough to attract viewers and make it exciting. This leads me to another key flaw in the movie. The animation.    If you are looking for good CGI effects and action, I suggest you watch another movie. The effects looked no better than those in the animated movie Final Fantasy, created a decade earlier. In some ways, Final Fantasy was much better. In this day and age, you would think they could have done a better job, but I guess they were too busy paying Angelina to drop her drawers than to afford truly spectacular effects. Neither her poorly animated breasts nor the other effects did anything for me. The same goes for the other great actors in the movie, who lost a lot in translation to this sub-par CGI attempt.    I short, if you are interested in TRULY finding out about Beowulf, I suggest you read the original (in translation of course, as Old English is closer to German than modern English) or watch some of the other animated movies based on the work. At least they kept true to the spirit of the original, and while the animation may not be that great, knowing how much money was pumped into THIS movie, you'll feel you got your money's worth.    I still holdout hope that one day someone in Hollywood will decide they can make a movie that holds true to the original story and ALSO has dynamic special effects, but for the time being, this movie has NEITHER!!!    Don't even bother with this one.
1594489505|4.0|I liked this book.  It wasn't one of those where I couldn't wait to climb into bed to continue reading, but I must say that there certainly were times when it was late at night and I would promise myself one more chapter and keep reading until the wee hours.  I got choked up at times, so it moved me.
B000069KGM|5.0|Chicago Transit Authority (1969) has always been the epitome of \\"hip\\". The band's debut had credibility on every front. Songwriting, musicianship, production, authenticity, and political relevance. Incorporating a jazz horn section with acid rock and pop music was not only innovative in 1969, but a symbol of the societal changes that they aspired America to embrace at that tumultuous time.<br /><br />Does Anybody really Know What Time It Is?, Beginnings, and Questions 67 And 68 were the hit singles, and are still three of Chicago's most famous and popular songs. Real classics. It's just not everyday you find lines like these:<br /><br />Only the beginning, only just the start<br />Only the beginning of what I want to feel forever<br /><br />Or:<br /><br />Does anybody really know what time it is?<br />Does anybody really care?<br /><br />Their rocking take on the Spencer Davis Group's I'm A Man is a classic rock radio staple, and is still my favorite version of the song. Free Form Guitar, Terry Kath's seven minute guitar feedback experiment is an acid rock electric symphony, and South California Purples features trippy blues-rock-jazz with a killer guitar solo and a Beatles quote, \\"I am he, as you are me, and we are all together\\". Prologue, August 29, 1968 includes an actual recording from the controversial Democratic National Convention in Chicago in 1968. Liberation is a heavy jazz-acid rock fusion piece that closes the album, and jams for over fourteen minutes. This stuff is great!<br /><br />The Chicago Transit Authority album was a landmark in rock music, and the bold beginning of a great career in music for a great band. The music here is energetic, passionate, intelligent, and exciting. This isn't the Chicago (even though it's the same band) of the 1970s, 80s, and 90s who produced dozens of great soft rock Top 40 hits. This is Chicago Transit Authority!
0743298039|2.0|This book has gotten a lot of undeserved hype.  I managed to finish reading it but with some difficulty.  Parts were quite compelling but much of it seemed contrived.  I found I did not like any of the characters, which is not to say you have to like the characters to enjoy a book, but they all seemed shallow, self absorbed and soulless.    The end of the book dragged on much longer than needed with unnecessary information as if the author attempted to tie it up with a bow for presentation, not content.     I had high hopes for this book but it did not meet my expectations.

B0007G89G4|5.0|This a classic movie about growing up and the friends you had. I can relate to a few of the things in this movie. I had a friend who died not to long ago and we were just like Chris and Gordie almost. Sad thing is the kids real last name was LaChance. I highly recommend this movie to anyone growing up or wanting to look back on there youth. The whole movie is perfect- from the scenery to the music. Not one bit needs to be changed. I loved the Summer of Stand By Me documentary, it was a very well done extra. I hated Richard Dreyfuss in it because he acted like it was just anther paycheck to him, while the rest of the cast said how much they loved making the movie.     It was also a rare case. Usually a King book made into a movie sucks but not this film. The book ended badly. He killed off everyone expect Gordie and then he writes it like Gordie is proud everyone but him is dead. A very sick and sad way to end a book. Im glad they did not use it in the film.     In closing, if you have not seen this movie-go out of your way to check it out and you wont be mad that you did.
0385338724|5.0|I absolutely adore Kinsella's books, but I especially look forward to her stand alone novels. I wasn't dissapointed by this book. While it isn't the deepest or most complex book I've read, I easily found myself getting into the storyline of Lexi & her amnesia. I also found it easy to believe her confusion & her alienation from everything. If I'd allowed myself to, I think I could have read this all in one sitting.
B000ZN8036|4.0|Into The Wild is a Sean Penn film. He is the same guy who acted in the film, Fast Times at Ridgemont High as the indulgent youth with standout hair. Like you, I haven't watched half of the films I've been meaning to watch in 2007, so the fact that i watched this film was a big deal. It was Eddie Vedder's Society that piqued my interest. I watched this film five days back but it's one of those rare philandering seaking films, the relevance of which substantiates in days from first viewing.<br /><br />Into The Wild is not for all audiences but just like the man in the film, a 23 year old like me found it quite appealing in ways not quite comprehensible. To say the film is beautiful and profound would be apt. There are many scenes and locations which make me wonder how reading the book might have been. I like reading books but due to lack of an attention span and patience with one's self, I will never get around to reading this book.<br /><br />The film had flaws but it's only because this cynic won't let go that easily. I thought his reasons for being the way he is were showcased in a way not quite parallel than might have been true. I don't think it was the circumstances in his family that led him to be the way he was  but moreover, it was the unquestionable zeal for life in comradery one finds with nature that would egg him on.<br /><br />To all my fellow 23 year olds, watch this film.<br />To all Eddie Vedder fans, check the soundtrack out.<br /><br />I'm now left wondering how I should update my boring sense of adventure. Into The Wild stays.

B0001L3LUE|4.0|This is an interesting, enlightening video. However, I was disappointed to learn that neither Mr. McNamara nor his \\"whiz kids\\" took any responsibility for the initial failure of the early version of the M-16 assault rifle. In earlier versions, this rifle fouled easily in the tropical climate of Viet Nam. Stories of American soldiers dying with cleaning rods in their hands,trying to clean their weapons because they would no longer fire were very distressing. Suggestions were made by soldiers to have the chamber chrome-plated fell on deaf ears; McNamara and the \\"whiz kids\\" thought if the manufacturer felt it needed a chrome-plated chamber, they would have made the rifle that way. This attitude is nothing short of arrogant. It is reminicent of the early failures of the Mark 14 torpedo during WWII.     In a responsible position such as Secretary of Defense, one would think that such a person could realize that improvements can be made to military hardware, especially when the suggestions come from the soldiers who have to rely on the weapon they are required to carry to defend their lives.
B00005NWM3|3.0|Nickelback is one of those bands that critics and \\"real music\\" fans hate, while their fans lap it up in droves. To me, they are the typical saga of a hard-working road-warrior band that finally grabbed the brass ring. Listening to \\"Silver Side Up\\" drives the 'bar band makes good' tag home, with a caveat inserted...I pretty much like this album.<br /><br />Granted, Nickelback distills their favorite bands into an easily digestible sound. Soundgarden and Alice In Chains seem likely contributors, but in my heart, this reaches back to all the travelling bands of the 80's like Reo Speedwagon, Head East or BTO from the 70's. Singer Chad Kroeger has a distinctive if not very distinguished voice, the songs are generic grunge-lite, and the band throws in \\"issues\\" to make themselves relevant. When the lead song on your album is a chord bashing revenge song about an abused spouse who fights back, well, it ain't your typical party anthem stuff.<br /><br />However, that happens to be the best thing here (and when you remind yourself that the followup [[ASIN:B00008ADPF The Long Road's]] \\"Figured You Out\\" is a song about debasing someone sexually, it seems off-kilter), and the album soon begins to sound like the same song 9 different ways. That's not to say that Nickelback is bad, they stand out from most of the early century grungettes (Staind, Puddle Of Mudd, Incubus, etc) that seem to think sounding heavy substitutes for good songwriting. And if there's one thing this band has a knack for, it is laying down a hook, over and over. Both \\"How You Remind Me\\" and \\"Too Bad\\" deal in sour topics (a cynical break-up and growing up without a father) while sticking to the roof of your brain.<br /><br />So critical and snobs be dammed. \\"Silver Side Up\\" matters most to the folks that buy CD's. In a time when hardly anyone, even the heavy hitters, can sell past gold, Nickelback (along with [[ASIN:B000IY04RC Daughtry]]) was one of the very few rock acts to go multi-platinum in 2007. From the POV of the jury of purchasing peers, their workmanlike chops and rock-cum-pop sense gets the last laugh.chasing peers, their workmanlike chops and rock-cum-pop sense gets the last laugh.

B0012QE4QC|2.0|Perched stupidly between an austere prestige picture and a tempestuous bodice ripper, \\"The Other Boleyn Girl\\" is little more than a posturing goof ball that happens to feature a semi-decent turn from Natalie Portman. Why this movie was made, and the purpose of its tone, is beyond me. It almost makes \\"Marie Antoinette\\" look restrained.     Based on Phillppa Gregory's novel, which pads the story of Henry VIII and his marriage to Anne Boleyn - as if the split from the Catholic Church and Boleyn's eventual beheading needed it - \\"The Other Boleyn Girl\\" introduces us to Anne's moon-faced, guileless sister, Mary (Scarlett Johansson).  It's she, not Anne, who's the first pawn in Sir Thomas Boleyn's plan to ensnare Henry (Eric Bana) and cement the family's royal bloodlines. It's Mary who goes to court, bringing Anne in tow. Mary, who drops her sap of a husband to crawl into the king's bed.  Mary, who bears the son that Henry's first wife, Catherine of Aragon, couldn't provide.    But Anne only trails until halftime, so to speak, returning from a short exile in France to pour all kinds of sugar on the grim, sad-faced Henry while Mary's bed-ridden, awaiting her child. Anne taunts Mary with this knowledge as payback for Mary's betrayal during Anne's first, \\"secret\\" marriage. According to Peter Morgan's screenplay, Anne's hard-to-get routine is more or less the source of the great schism between Henry's England and the Catholic Church. When the king finally \\"has\\" Anne, it's in a fit of petulant  rage after a scolding from wife Catherine. The movie's final act concerns Anne's rule as queen and her eventual execution.    How accurate is any of this? Who knows. History generally tells us that Mary got around quite a bit more than Anne did in the French courts; a sweet simpleton she was not. Gregory's book  acknowledges this; the movie does not. The bigger problem lies in Justin Chadwick's oppressive direction, which throws an odd, dark tint on the visuals and the portentous music over too many scenes. That's a holdover from the movie's Oscar hopes - dashed once it became clear \\"The Other Boleyn Girl\\" has all kinds of lapses and absurdities, not the least of which features Mary riding alone on horseback, presumably for days, to save her sister's life, and walking out of the castle with Anne's daughter Elizabeth to ride that same horse back home.    Gregory's novel doesn't exactly have a healthy scorn of Henry's intelligence, but, as Bana plays him, Henry's a chiseled stud with a Dom DeLuise beard and a pea brain. The man was indeed an oaf, but history's shown him to be a brilliant one: A musician, a poet and an accomplished thinker. Henry enjoyed as much power, if not more, than any royal before or since. The movie doesn't reflect it. Bana, a dark-eyed brooder, is the wrong fit for the role.     Portman, however, makes an intriguing Anne. Her looks fit the paintings of the queen to some extent, and the actor manages to suppress that giant, unflattering grin of hers. Portman's  never going to be a particularly great actor - charmed lives such as hers rarely produce the needed range - but she's endearing in her own way, and the role of Anne lets her try on manipulation. It suits her, as does the trappings of the time period: Wardrobe, accents, etc. Better than Kirsten Dunst, anyhow.      And, frankly, Johansson, who glides through her scenes with her trademark opacity. We don't find out what makes Mary tick so much we hear the wind blowing through her ears. Although Mary smartens up by the end of the picture, she always seems a little slow on the uptake, and Johansson's bewildered, open-mouthed persona transforms virtue into the addled gaze of a milquetoast. It worked five years ago in \\"Girl With A Pearl Earring;\\" it's growing a little old now.

B000RZIGVS|5.0|Good to see this as one whole package. Sure is a bummer to me, I bought the seasons as they were first released on DVD (2002). They were $100 a season, so I forked over $700 but now you get this all for less than half. Just dont seem fair that the real fans who bought it when it first came out paid up the A for it and now you get it very cheap.<br />I must say about this series.....Season 1 was soooooooo bad.....I mean it was so bad, it almost got cancelled. It had such a liberal Green attitude, wasnt very trekkie like. One Episode Riker made the comment \\"we no longer enslave animals for our consumption\\" I thot, man this is just horrible. Or \\"naked now\\" where even data was affected by the virus?? I mean come on!!!!!!  He's a walking set of curuits and posatronics, what a stupid episode that was, then the cure didnt work from McCoy's logbook and they had to make a new one. Or what about the episode where they find those dead people on a satellite from the 1980's and Data has them brought abaord and Picard said he should have just kept them dead....LOL.<br /> Then a new writing staff came in, they brought on Dr Palaski for season 2 (and only season 2) and canned Tasha, or she quit on her own, then the chemistry got strong, the writing was 100% better and the show took off! I didnt even watch season 1 after a few episodes after it first aired. I got back into it about season 3 or 4 and thought, wow, what a come back.<br />The show was awesome and when it endeed after season 7, I wanted it to stay on another 7 years....then they made that super lame movie \\"Generations\\" but thats for another review.

B0000046KM|5.0|No complaints and no regrets  I still believe in chasing dreams and placing bets  But I have learned that all you give is all you get  So give it all you got.    Thus begins this disc full of magic: Here's to life and every joy it brings.  So true. This disc is Shirley Horn's toast to life, to you as a listener.  I have to admit I'm a fan. I played this the moment I heard of my father's death, thinking of all the lost chances in his life. I decided then that mine would be different. And it is.  Miles once said of Shirley: You're so damn slow! Nevertheless he loved her magical interpretations.  Whatever she decides to do, standards everybody knows by heart, lesser knowns or her own songs(of which there are none on this album), I'm sure you will be amazed at what Shirley is able to do with them.   Not only does she make them her own, she turns them into Booker Prize winning novels with stories that make you cry or smile, sometimes even both.  Apart from her great voice, Shirley Horn is also an extremely gifted pianist.  Although I'm usually not a great fan of \\"with strings\\" albums, this one is  so different I loved it the first time I listened to it.   Johnny Mandel's arrangements leave Shirley all the space she needs for both her piano and her vocals. Yet they are more than just supportive. More like a highway's second lane with you changing constantly on your way to the stars.   As so often Shirley is accompanied by her rhythm section: Charles Ables Bass and Steve Williams Drums. Guest musicians include Wynton Marsalis with two great trumpet solos, Alan Broadbent Piano, Harvey Mason Drums and many others.  A beautiful work of art to enjoy for life.
0143038419|1.0|I was interested in reading this book because someone told me it changed her life. It changed my life too, because now I have resolved not to ever read this author again. She is a talented writer, but the level of self-involvement and navel-gazing in this book is not to be believed. No matter how the author dresses it up, my take on her novel is that she dumped her husband, was dumped by her subsequent boyfriend, then embarked on a world trek to find another man. Once that mission was accomplished, her \\"spiritual journey\\" ended and she came right home. The longer I read the novel, the less I liked it, and my sentiment as I closed the book was, who cares?

B000ZOXDFA|2.0|I was going to give this three stars, but I am sometimes too nice! The only bright spot in this one was the absolutely adorable Abbie Cornish as \\"Bess\\". And I thought I could only love Charlize Theron, one of the most beautiful women to ever appear on a movie screen!!! Of course I do have somewhat of a crush on Scarlett Johannson, but don't tell Charlize that. But I digress. Throughout \\"Lizzie Two\\" most of the cast seemed to be sleepwalking. Clive Owen's portrayal was particularly boring. Errol Flynn would've certainly been much better in the role, but alas and alack, he is no longer with us! The battle scene with the Spanish Armada was really dull and pretty much anti-climactic. And oh, those seemingly endless \\"big lighting\\" effects with Elizabeth. Maybe this should have been titled \\"Elizabeth, The Savior Queen\\". I think Kapur should've reviewed some of the period pieces from the 30's and 40's. They usually had the required dash and panache that this one lacks. And what was with all those real high shots? Were they supposed to impress us little people? Some directors just fall in love with themselves after a dash of success. George Lucas' Star War series comes to mind. I gave this two stars only because it is still a cut above Mel Gibson's \\"Braveheart\\", the epitomy of a bad \\"historical\\" movie. Was Mel already on the \\"sauce\\" when he made that one? (By the way, I really like Mel's \\"We Were Soldiers\\", just so you don't think I'm anti-Mel.) Some of these folks in the movie business must have a very low opinion of our intelligence. (Do \\"Titanic\\" and \\"Pearl Harbor\\" come to mind?) My other pet peeve about this movie and some others concerns the dialogue. Whatever happened to recording the characters dialogue in a clear, distinct manner. Actors should never be speaking whilst turned away from the camera. And I do have a good sound system in my home. About $4,000.00 worth. I get tired of going back over the same line two or three times trying to understand what is being said!!! Kapur's first Elizabeth was much better, especially Cate Blanchett's performance. In this one she just seemed to be there to pickup a nice paycheck. Oh, well, \\"let the buyer beware\\".
B0010X745K|4.0|This was an actual quote from one of our local movie critics who really lambasted this latest Stephen King adaptation. Okay, so this movie is definitely not for everyone.  But if you ever read the novella, which King featured in his book \\"Skeleton Crew\\" then you can really appreciate the translation of this to the big screen by Frank Darabont.   Some \\"gloom and doom\\" zealots feel that this is exactly how our world will end:  not by humans doing each other in, but by mysterious creatures that will come to devour us all, the manifestation of God's wrath.
0143038583|4.0|The information in this book did not surprise me considering I was born a farmer on a dairy farm in Ohio.   My family was driven off our small family farm by regulations intended to do just that.       I see most people eating what they bought; having bent their arm they buy the next handful.  Everyone should ask, \\"How far am I from my food\\"? You should also ask yourself, \\"How far am I from my fuel source\\"... how about water?       Michael Pollan has just exposed the tip of the iceberg with regard to problems facing the highly populated modern world.  Many people with vision say we are living on a knife's edge; perhaps living balanced on the edge of a blade of grass would be a more intelligent representation of our predicament.       Michael uses many unusual references (known to only the most intelligent people in the world), many words I may know but would never use, some I did not bother to look up, and profuse verbiage filling pages when a paragraph would do; therefore only four stars...  in other words he would be considered a good writer, but do not let that stop you from reading this book!

If it is not to be a Utopia, then why believe at all?

067144901X|5.0|I love this book!  We have several Boynton board books, but this one still is at the top of my list and is a must-have for any toddler's bookshelf (with Barnyard Dance running a close second).  We have video of our daughter doing the animal sounds to this, and then eventually reading it all herself, because the rhythms make it an easy one for them to memorize.<br /><br />While all of this is cute and makes for nice photos and video, etc., the more important factor is how this book fosters a love of reading.  It's fun, it's energetic, and it makes both parents and kids look forward to reading together.  One warning -- be prepared to read it over and over and over (and over!).  When they memorize and \\"read\\" it to others (my daughter wanted to do it for anyone who came over and would be willing, they feel such pride and joy.  To this day, my daughter still feels this way about reading.<br /><br />Great book for your own child, and perfect gift from birth until about 18 months.  If you are even considering buying this...do it.  You'll be delighted!
0345404475|4.0|With very few exceptions, literary visions of the future are bleak and dystopian. Science fiction literature it seems wants to instill fear into the minds of its readers, or at least make the reader extremely cautious to the dangers of \\"technology run amok.\\" It is difficult to say what motivates the authors to present the future in this fashion. But from the standpoint the marketplace it certainly is a formula that works, as is readily apparent by its wide readership. And the authors, these provocateurs of the amygdala, continue to put more of this anti-technological diatribe on paper.<br /><br />This book, first published in 1968, represents one of such works, but in spite of this it turns out to be very insightful into the current technological morass called the twenty-first century. All of the characters in the book, human and otherwise, represent many of the moods and concerns of the twenty-first century citizen. The devastating third world war of this book did not happen but the anxieties that some feel about technology are reflected in this book in the killing of the androids (the \\"andys\\") and the fear that the \\"empathy box\\" may change one's identity permanently. Indeed, the events in this book have their analogs today in the purposeful destruction of genetically engineered crops by some fanatical groups and the research labs that produce them, and also in the misguided legislation that has attempted to thwart developments in genetics and molecular biology. Those who carry out these activities evidently do not foresee their consequences to human health, and have no empathy it seems for those who may starve or die because of the lack of food or medicines brought about by genetic engineering (perhaps they need an empathy box of the sort described in this book to assist them in gaining insight into their actions).<br /><br />This story can still be enjoyed however by those readers who strongly advocate technological advance and are proud of human accomplishments in this regard. This is so because it is a kind of adventure story, and will make such readers salivate at the mouth when it discusses robotic (\\"electric\\") animals, human colonies on Mars, videophones, and hover cars. In addition, the author it seems had a rudimentary knowledge of cognitive neuroscience, at least at the level of what was available at the time of publication. And without conscious awareness perhaps, the reader can feel empathy for the androids, which must constantly face the prospect of execution or an irreversible four-year lifespan. Perhaps an update of this story is in order, but perhaps not. After all, this is the twenty-first century, and one need only pick up a technical journal or newspaper to read about technological developments that are much more exciting than what is contained in this story. And thankfully there is more ahead, much, much more.rd.

0385512104|5.0|This book was recommended to me by a friend because I have a 6 year old son with Aspergers. I began to read it on Saturday evening and by lunchtime on Sunday I was done.  I couldn't put it down.  My son even seemed interested in reading it after I told him it was written by someone else with Aspergers who was trying to find out what happened to a dog that had died.  I loved how Christopher (ironically same name as my son) provided his insight, feelings and thoughts about what he saw and experienced throughout the book.  It was so interesting and helped me to understand some of the struggles that someone with Aspergers experiences and why they respond the way they do sometimes.  I would definitely recommend it to anyone who wants to learn more about Aspergers, especially if you have someone close to you with it.

Eastwood comes to the farm seeking directions to a covered bridge that he has been assigned to photograph  and Meryl Streep gets in the pick-up truck with him to give him directions.  One thing leads to another and pretty soon Eastwood is diddling the wife.  The movie is told as if the wife's children are reading her diary after her death.

0452289963|4.0|Reading, A New Earth, is like getting a spiritual check-up. I have read other books with the same or similar message and it's always the same: I read, I feel enlightened and I remember who I really am - it's like getting high on life.  However, time goes by, then I forget, or slip, or loose that glimpse and go back to my ego's favorite old ways.  A New Earth, has given me a spiritual shot in the arm, which for me, is more like a required booster.<br /><br />If you have an undying attachment to any religion, belief or non-belief system, do not hesitate to read this book. The author says in the first chapter that this book's purpose is not to add new information or beliefs to your mind or to try to convince you of any-thing, but to bring a shift in consciousness.  Although this book was very useful, I gave it four stars because there were many passages that I read, and re-read, yet that voice in my head still said...\\"What?\\"  I guess that is the purpose of Oprah's ten-week on-line class. This paragraph found on page 71 is an example of that.<br /><br />\\"There is only one absolute Truth, and all other truths emanate from it.  When you find that Truth, your actions will be in alignment with it.  Human action can reflect the Truth, or it can reflect illusion.  Can the Truth be put into words? Yes, but the words are, of course, not it. They only point to it.\\"<br /><br />A much greater portion of the book was full of wisdom that was crisp and clear. Below are a few of my favorite quotes from the first few chapters, you will see there is nothing ominous or evil in their meaning, in fact - quite the opposite.<br /><br />\\"If the history of humanity were the clinical case history of a single human being, the diagnosis would have to be:  chronic paranoid delusions, a pathological propensity to commit murder and acts of extreme violence and cruelty against his perceived `enemies' - his own unconsciousness projected outward.  Criminally insane, with a few brief lucid intervals.\\"<br /><br />\\"Fear, greed, and the desire for power are the psychological motivating forces not only behind warfare and violence between nations, tribes, religions, and ideologies, but also the cause of incessant conflict in personal relationships.\\"<br /><br />\\"If the structure of the human mind remains unchanged, we will always end up re-creating fundamentally the same world, the same evils, the same dysfunction.\\"<br /><br />\\"There are many people who are always waiting for the next thing to react against, to feel annoyed or disturbed about - and it never takes long before they find it.\\"<br /><br /> \\"For you to be right, of course, you need someone else to be wrong, and so the ego loves to make wrong in order to be right.\\"<br /><br />\\"Ego takes everything personally.\\"<br /><br />\\"Every ego is a master of selective perception and distorted interpretation.\\"<br /><br />\\"The history of Christianity is, of course, a prime example of how the belief that you are in sole possession of the truth, that is to say, right, can corrupt your actions and behavior to the point of insanity.\\"<br /><br /> \\"There is only one perpetrator of evil on the planet: human unconsciousness.\\"<br /><br />I'm looking forward to the on-line web-event.

B0012K1ILW|4.0|New Amerykah - 4th World War is the album that will assuage your fears that the lighter, fluffier Worldwide Underground was to be her new direction. This album proves Worldwide was just a ho-hum side trip with a couple tunes that worked really well in concert. And yes, real horns are back! None of the fake, sterile, synth-brass of Worldwide.<br /><br />This is an album Marvin Gaye would be proud of, and I'd not say that about most hip-hop of the past 5 years... the worst years so far. It doesn't sound like any Marvin but it has that level of heart, yearning, hope and fine crafting of songs. You can dream and even have hope with these lyrics and melodies, rather than just bob your drunken head in the club. This album is like a bag of creeper. Amerykahn Promise and the cryptic, beautiful metaphor of The Healer sucked me right in but the rest took a bit of time. I know the deal, though. Great music isn't a trip to McDonald's for a Happy Meal. Great music isn't guzzling a pint of whiskey in 30 minutes for the quick buzz.<br /><br />4th World War is like Mama's Gun and [[ASIN:B00005NG4X Vespertine]] in that those first couple tuesday 2/26/08 listens didn't have me thinking it was at the level of previous works, yet I kept wanting to hear it again. 4 days and 10 listens later I was thinking this is a great album. Now I know it's a great album. This is an ocean or river when too many hip-hop \\"artists\\" and fans are scared to leave the kiddie pool.<br /><br /> Twinkle, Soldier, That Hump and Telephone are going to melt hearts in concert. Amerikahn Promise can be a power-funk bookend, slinking in and out of Parliament, NWA, Marley or whatever else she and the band feel on that night. Honey can go either way, from major dance tune to slowed down, southern drawl soul.<br /><br />Still... Erykah needs at least one album where she is surrounded by totally organic masters of high improvisation rather than continuing to record with people who are going to sit at a computer for a while, only to call her after they \\"have a beat\\".

No one will ever know the truth behind what happend to this young man, but Sean Penn does a brilliant job bringing his interpretation to the big screen.
006135323X|3.0|Self-help books are among the hottest sales items in your favorite book store, right after Gothic novels and cookbooks. Many people are dissatisfied with their lives and don't quite know why. Self-help interpretations claim they offer helpful psychological insight, but do they? Freud gave us the quite valuable notions of id, ego, and superego, but also the quack notions of penis envy and oedipal complex. Later generations of self-help pop psychologists turned Freud into a cash cow of dangeriously overused but highly fashionable slogans, such as psychosomatic illness, inferiority complex, repressed memory, childhood trauma, and hysterical conversion syndrome.<br /><br />Freudian psychology is just about dead in the self-help arena, but now we have a new contender for leader of the pop psychology: behavioral economics. Ariely's is one of several new books that take the experimental results of the past quarter century and turn them into self-help. The main message is that we are irrational, but if we understand and correct for this, we can overcome our irrationality and improve our lives. \\"We are pawns in a game whose forces we largely fail to comprehend,\\" says Ariely. \\"Although irrationality is commonplace,\\" he continues, \\"it does not necessarily mean that we are helpless. Once we understand when and where we may make erroneous decisions, we can try to be vigilant.\\" (p. 243)<br /><br />Like Freudian psychology, behavioral economics gives us a few critically important insights, including hyperbolic discounting, excessive pattern-finding, loss aversion, status quo bias, and innate altruistic cooperation and punishment. However, just as Freud was mostly wrong (and therapeutically a high-maintenance disaster), so is behavioral economics, although I doubt that people will be paying $200 per hour to sit on a couch with a behavioral economics therapist.<br /><br />Now, Ariely in no way distorts the writings of the behavioral economists in this book. Ariely is a jolly guy who is hard not to like, and he uses his charm to push a popular version of the beliefs expressed in the technical journals and books all the time: the rational actor of economic theory is all wrong, and irrationality is pervasive. \\"People are not logical---they are psychological,\\" as the saying goes.<br /><br />Despite the extreme value of their experiments, the behavioral economists are mostly a theoretically ignorant and indolent lot, who content themselves with showing that a highly stripped-down version of the rational actor model is wrong, and conclude, sloppily and without warrant, that \\"people are irrational.\\" Of course, the greatest behavioral economists have developed better models of human behavior that explain the experimental evidence, but these models are simply sophisticated versions of the rational actor model, not their antithesis. For instance, Kahneman and Tversky's `prospect theory,' for which Kahneman was awarded the Nobel prize in Economics, replaces the standard economic utility function with one with a kink at the individual's current position. Similarly, the various models of altruistic behavior are based on expanded utility functions that included caring, positively or negatively, about the welfare of others. There is absolutely nothing \\"irrational\\" about altruism.<br /><br />Another set of behavioral findings is that people do not always make choices that are in their own interest. Some of these result from people having incorrect theories about the world. For instance, there are various \\"pop probability theories\\" that are incorrect and will lead people who follow them to lose lots of money. However, ignorance is not irrationality, and given their incorrect beliefs, these individuals perform exactly as predicted by the rational actor model. Other welfare-reducing choices stem from hyperbolic discounting. However, if we replace the standard exponential discounting model with a hyperbolic discounting model, we remain within the fold of the rational actor model, just with a more plausible preference ordering (see my Behavioral and Brain Sciences article or the draft of my game theory text, The Bounds of Reason, on my web site, for details).<br /><br />Ariely is a creative experimenter with zero capacity to deal with economic theory. By accepting the behavioral paradigm (\\"people are not logical, they are psychological\\"), he makes it in principle impossible to explain his experimental results. Take, for instance, the wonderful experiment he carried out in a tavern in university town in the USA. Disguised as waiters, and with the permission of the establishment, Ariely and his assistants offered 2 oz. of complimentary beer to clients. There were four types of beer with names that indicated nothing about their taste or quality, and clients at each table were asked to state publically which beer they wanted. He found that clients were averse to making the same choice as others at their table, so for instance, at a table with four clients, each would ask for a different type of beer. This is because, he said, Americans value individuality. He performed the same experiment in Hong Kong, finding that clients tended to choose the same type of beer, confirming that the local culture valued conformity.<br /><br />This is a great experiment, but where is the irrationality? Is it irrational to value conformity or diversity? I think not. Moreover Ariely stacked the deck in his favor by ensuring that the real qualities of the beer were unknown, so clients should be indifferent among them. This self-serving experimental design (behavioral economics often use self-serving designs without acknowledging this fact in any way---why they get away with it I cannot imagine) was bound to make \\"culture\\" trump \\"preferences,\\"  Why not do the experiment with known beer types? Or better yet, vary the delay in delivering the beer in the four choices, so you can get one type after a 20 second delay, a second type after a 40 second delay, etc. Why not use consumer choice theory to judge the strength of the desire for conformity or diversity, rather than just saying \\"people are irrational\\" and attempting no plausible explanation of behavior?<br /><br />Ariely is certainly correct that behavioral economics has some important things to tell people about living their lives. Seeing patterns where there are none can lead to disastrous, and wholly avoidable, financial decisions. The savings rate in America can be increased by employers making 401k contributions the default condition. But, most of the behavior illuminated by behavioral experiments is not irrational and there is no reason for people to change it. Understanding why we behave as we do is valuable in its own right, without having to contribute to solving our life problems. More important from my view as a modeler of human behavior, we must stop using the i-word to keep us from developing cogent analytical models of human behavior. I am virtually certain that all such models will be extensions of the rational actor model of economics that reduce to the traditional model when appropriate assumptions holdsuch as correct beliefs and perfect knowledge of preferences.ible preference ordering (see my Behavioral and Brain Sciences article or the draft of my game theory text, The Bounds of Reason, on my web site, for details).

0743496736|5.0|Once more, Jodie Picoult is able to lure us into the twisting plot that became her new book, titled Nineteen Minutes.  Picoult takes us deep into the mind of the main character, Peter, who is the victim of bullying all his life.  As pressure builds up inside Peter, he deals with it in the only way he sees possible: school violence.  This book really makes you think and provokes many questions.  Like, do we really have the right to judge someone and why is bullying happening?      Jodie Picoult wrote this book to make her readers think about the points she feels they should come across and get in touch with.  Some of these questions address bullying.  Why does it happen?  What pushes people to the breaking point?  Why is bullying allowed to happen?  Many teens have to deal with bullying and, sadly, many schools and teachers look the other way when it happens.  Picoult wants bullying to be addressed directly, she wants it to be stopped completely in its tracks.  If bullying can be ended, school violence can start to go down.    Another question this book raises is about judgment.  Does a person really have the right to judge another person solely by their actions?  This book shows us what Peter's mom feels when she finds out what Peter has done.  She blames herself for Peter's actions and continually combs through her memories of Peter, trying to find what she has done wrong.  Often, in situations like this one, we will forget how family members feel.  Usually they will have no idea what the person was really feeling and did not show any outward signs of what was to come.  Peter's actions (and others like his) can just as easily tear his family to shreds as anyone else's.  After all, \\"in nineteen minutes, you can stop the world, or you can just jump off it\\"(5).

B00012L786|3.0|SPOILERS: As a noir, the movie is a little disappointing. It has an agenda to satisfy a McCarthyite anti-communist litmus test above the demands of narrative. The main communist character, for example, is too nervous cowardly to meet with Widmark in the first reel and then shifts into homicidal mania to kill the sick, older lady in her bed. It looks good, though, and Widmark is great the role. Great dialog, too.

B0010YSD7M|4.0|I bought the DVD today from my retailer a week before the release date, and watched it once I got home.    The film is set between series 3 and 4 of Atlantis as a few changes occur in series 4 of Atlantis which aren't in this movie.    I would recommend anyone to watch the prologue as a refresher of the ori story (fan or not). The film was a great continuation of \\"unending\\" it's as if it wasn't cancelled.  The final ori story did seem a little rushed as questions which were left unanswered in series 10 were answered quite quickly. The overall story was a typically great SG1 episode but could have easily been pushed into an entire series, plus the resurrection of the replicators was a good and surprising touch.  Although they go to the ori galaxy not a lot is shown and doesn't seem different from the other two know galaxies in the Stargate universe.    Overall it was a great movie with just a few minor issues, but nothing to worry about and for fans a great return to one of the best sci-fi shows ever, can't wait for the next movie with the return of Jack O'Neil.

0790729644|3.0|Technically, and acting-wise this is a great movie. The performances, especially by Gene Hackman, Richard Harris and Eastwood, are superlative. Hackman's \\"Little Bill\\" is easily his most memorable character since Popeye Doyle in \\"French Connection\\" (Too bad he had to do a caricature of it a couple years later in \\"The Quick and the Dead\\"). Cinematography, editing and most of the dialogue are also excellent.  My problem is with the plot. So Eastwood's Bill Munny, after arriving in Big Whiskey, has a dark epiphany of sorts in which he sees the harsh reality of death and the terrible consequnces of his murderous past. Yet he then almost casually goes through with the contract killings, even though he now knows that the account of the mutilation of the prostitute that he is supposedly exacting revenge for was exaggerated. To me, this makes all his dark visions and revelations meaningless; they had no effect. Despite all the pretensions of the script, in the end this becomes just another conventional western, with the \\"good guy\\" shooting all the bad guys. Despite all his character falws and all the nuances, in the end Eastwood is presented as just another avenging hero like his mid-seventies characters.

630460291X|4.0|Robin Hood - Prince of Thieves was a film I loved as a child. I just loved Kevin Costner back then, Morgan Freeman and Christian Slater also star and pull off flawless performances. Watching this film now, well it isn't as special as I thought but it's still a good movie. I never cared for the story of Robin Hood but this one feels current even though the dialogue is authentic to the time period. And you can't help but think of that Bryan Adams song, fits great with this film. I recommend checking this '90s classic out.

I can't relate to her at all and wonder if anyone who has a somewhat normal life with responsibilities such as a husband, kids, career, housework, bills, aging parents, etc. relates?  I got so tired of her trials with meditation, prayer, and travels...she doesn't know what REAL problems are.
0060920084|5.0|I am a big fan of Bill Bryson and have read nearly all of his books but I didn't realize that this was his first until I read some of the reviews here.  Still, I knew this book was different from his other books.  As enjoyable as they were, this was the one that really had me laughing and oftentimes wiping away tears of laughter.  While Bryson is always funny, he is viciously so in this book and I could see how that would not appeal to some people.    While a good number of Bryson's books are travelogues of a sort, I don't think categorizing them as such really does his works justice.  They are not only a man's descriptions of his travels but also windows into his very psyche.  He has always poked fun at the people of various cultures he encounters during his travels but he is sometimes downright mean in this book.  While I certainly don't advocate being mean to others, the fact of the matter is that Bryson strikes me as a man who is really mild-mannered and rather awkward.  What we're reading in his books, and in this one in particular, is what goes on inside his head and what I really admire about this is his candor.  There are often things that run through my head that I would never want anyone else to know about and so I frankly can't help but be a bit in awe of someone who actually exposes those thoughts to the light of day.  I think if we're all honest with ourselves, we will have to admit that we all share the same pettiness that Bryson sometimes exhibits.    As for his comments about the places to which he travels, it is true that they aren't always kind.  I'm a native of Michigan and so I eagerly devoured the section of his book that had to do with Michigan and, frankly, I was surprised that it was as positive as it was.  While I do love my home state, I was rather shocked that Bryson didn't comment on the tackiness of the downtown area of Mackinac Island and that he was so mild in his descriptions of the tourist trap that is Mackinaw City.  Bear in mind that the island is one of my most favorite places in the world.  Even so, I do acknowledge that parts of it are more than deserving of criticism.  It can be very painful to hear someone criticize a place that we love but it is also worth listening because there may just be some value to their criticisms.  And, if not, it's always possible to laugh with friends later over what a jerk the person doing the criticizing is.    Bryson, though, is a native of the U.S.  The fact that he lived in England for so long is relevant only because the changes to his native country are so shocking to him upon his return.  Yes, he is critical but he is critical of every country that he visits, including England.  This is proven by his book \\"Notes from a Small Island\\".  Bryson is good at picking out the things about which people are most sensitive and poking at them.  This will naturally not endear him to everyone but I don't think that this book singles the U.S. out in any way.  Instead, I think he has a very valid point about how sad it is that the U.S. is becoming more and more generic every day--and this book was written long before you could find a Starbucks on every corner.  His points bear consideration.  What have we sacrificed in our quest for convenience and 24-hour service?
0452289963|5.0|I ordered this book with great anticipation, and was not disappointed. Eckhart Tolle has made a deep, life changing subject an easy read. I found this book to be thought provoking and just wonderful. I am getting several copies for my family and friends. This book should be required reading in school, and if our world leaders would read it, there would be no more war. I can't say enough positive things about it. Read it. Give it a chance. It changed my life.
1595141715|5.0|A quite unexpected but compelling first novel by the wonderful author that is Jay Asher. Asher, whose idea for character perspective was in my opinion genius, was able to make the thoughts and words of his characters stick with me and able to get across his messages in a very unique way, through the combined hints and thoughts of both main characters.         Clay Jenson comes home one day and finds a package waiting for him from his crush who had committed suicide two weeks earlier. Clay spends that night journeying through the town led by the voice of his crush who had sent him tapes as an odd sort of suicide note. This girl, Hannah Baker had recorded thirteen tapes, each one a reason for why she committed suicide, and had sent them off to the first person on her list of reasons.  That person had to continue passing on the tapes until each person had heard what she had to say and if anyone decided not to pass on the tapes, she had a backup set of tapes that would go public. Each of the people did something that had affected Hannah in such a way that it had added to her pain, though most of the things may have seemed insignificant to the people who had done them. But, what startled Clay most of receiving the package was that he never knew he did anything. Since he never tried to hurt Hannah, he was shocked that he was included on the list.          What i enjoyed most and disliked most about the book was the same thing, the writing style of Jay Asher. It is interesting and new to me and very captivating however, it can get a bit tricky to read at some parts while bouncing back and forth from the thoughts of one character to the next line after line and changing subjects with each character. It is somewhat difficult at times to keep up with the contradicting and clashing thoughts of the two main characters but if you can keep up with that well, it makes an incredibly interesting read. It is also important to keep in mind who and what the characters are talkingto and about, so when reading this book it was a lot more enjoyable when i read it without distractions to let me focus completely on the book.         I recommend this book to anyone who wants suspense, a bit of mystery, and slight unexpected twists. This book isn't for people looking for just a happy-go-lucky book with a picture perfect ending. But either way, this book was extremely entertaining and was able to stick with me and inform me at the same time.
0618918248|4.0|As an American who believes religion causes more harm than good and should be taxed to pay off debt, I loved the book. Everyone says that religion is so accepting, but the main point this book points out is that if you're atheist the church isn't very accepting of you. The scientific comparisons could have been cut down more because Dawkins logic was good enough. Ironically, so many people in this world who participated activities many would consider amoral were people who have helped the world so much. Another point of irony is that America was started as a protest against religion and now it is a country based on religion with almost 50% of the people go to church on Sunday. In contrast, the country of Great Britain now has an attitude in which a politician even mentions God, he will be laughed at by many. If religion thoroughly examined itself through the lens of logic more, it would be more viable.
B00005JLT5|5.0|Polanski had to make a film about the tragic past of the country whose name he carries. He had to concentrate on the primal historical \\"crime\\" committed by cosmic time and the war in 1939-1945, the extermination of the Jews by the Germans with the vast complicity of the Poles. The film is brilliant in its dense darkness because Polanski does not concentrate his tale so much on the community but on one particular Jew and his family he will be the only survivor of (it is a true story). He does not choose a Jew that would represent money or work, but a pianist, an artist representing cultural, universal and human talent that has no ethnic color whatsoever. And yet he moves further. After showing the ghettoization of the Jews in Warsaw, then their enslavement and extermination, then the escape of this pianist and his clandestine survival in the hands of non-Jews, some honest resistant fighters who put themselves in danger because of their political action, some (at least one) making a personal profit out of their help, the pianist also sees the meaningful and significant upheaval of the Jews when the ghetto is nearly empty. Pathetic but too late. He sees the doomed upheaval of the liberal resistant fighters and this time too early so that the Germans can exterminate them. Note here the film never really concentrate on the SS as the evil doers and the others as submissive followers. All Germans are concerned. The sacrifice of these resistant fighters leads to nothing since it clears the way for the communists to be the only ones to profit from the arrival of the Russians. Polanski even pushes one step further and there the film becomes a gospel about the shiny side of humanity. That pianist will survive the last few weeks thanks to a Wehrmacht officer who will accept to hide his presence and to feed him through to the end , and even give him a coat - that could have been tragic when the Russians arrived - before leaving. The officer had been convinced to provide this help by some music played on a piano by the Jew in the middle of ruins and on the eve to the final defeat. Music as the universal humanistic language beyond barbarity. Beautiful. Inspiring. A real salvation and epiphany for us all. That is exactly where pathos is discarded and love comes into the picture. A love that can transcend hatred and reach cosmic time in the smallness of human historical if not purely existential time. And If the pianist survive up to 2000, the German officer died in captivity in the USSR in 1952. Irony of irony, it is nothing but irony.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne & University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelinesp by some music played on a piano by the Jew in the middle of ruins and on the eve to the final defeat.

0061547832|4.0|Donald Trump has one of the most recognizable names in business. He has a successful track record in the real estate and development business segments and in this book, Trump seems anxious to offer his advice and some general ideas that he feels will lead to great success.<br />Many of the ideas presented in this book are obvious and many other people have stated the same things. Staying positive, maintaining focus, keeping a step ahead of the competition, aiming for the top, etc., are all pretty common pieces of advice that most business people and self- help/motivational authors would agree are important ingredients to success. Trump has his own unique way of saying things, but the basics of most of this advice are pretty clear, and pretty ordinary.<br /><br />When the book gets interesting is when Trump offers some more unique words of wisdom. This takes place in the chapters that cover fear and distrust, seeking revenge, and demanding a prenuptial agreement. The chapter on trust isn't too far out of the ordinary, but it is still a little different and some of what it says took me by surprise. Trump feels that you can never completely trust anyone, and that includes people you have known for a long time. His bottom line when it comes to employees is \\"Get the Best People, and Don't Trust Them\\". Trump has witnessed too many backstabbers and too many shenanigans to put his trust in people again.<br /><br />The chapter about seeking revenge is probably the most controversial of all. Here, the book recommends something that many would find reprehensible: Getting even with those who have insulted you or damaged you in any way. When someone does you wrong or in any way proves themselves disloyal, you should fight back directly and with such great force that the person will never mess with you again. Trump offers many examples of feuds he has had with other people and former friends who are no longer on his buddy list. In each instance, he has fought back tooth and nail. He feels that revenge is sweet and that anyone who avoids getting even is a schmuck who deserves any bad treatment he/she receives. This chapter is certain to cause controversy among readers and many will likely dismiss it outright, even though I cannot really say that Trump is completely wrong in his assessments.<br /><br />The other chapter that is controversial is the one on prenuptial agreements. Trump agrees that a prenup is about as unromantic as anything could possibly be, but he feels very strongly about getting one because he feels there is too much at risk if you do not. It is interesting to note that the book doesn't recommend prenups only for the highly successful who own a business and don't want to lose it. It seems to aim this advice at all men and women, even though, in the absence of any wealth, a prenup doesn't seem that important.<br /><br />Bill Zanker is the co- writer of this book and Zanker offers his own writing segment at the end of each chapter. Zanker's claim to fame is The Learning Annex and he considers Donald Trump to be one of his mentors. His contributions to this book are not very useful, because in every instance, all he does is reaffirm what Trump said earlier in the chapter. He plays the role of the supportive cheerleader, chanting out Trump's name and pointing out how correct Trump is in his pronouncements on business and life. It gets a little boring after a while because you already know what you are going to read before you get there.<br /><br />Overall, this is a good book from Mr. Donald Trump and his sidekick/head cheerleader, Bill Zanker. This book has been referred to by some as a self- help guide but it is really an empowerment book and I like it better than Trump's recent efforts, like \\"How to Get Rich\\" and \\"Think Like a Billionaire\\". I like the \\"Sum it Up\\" and the Key Points sections at the end of each chapter, because they help to keep the book organized and they make for a good reference tool. I could have done without the input from Zanker, but this is still a good motivational book written by one of the most recognizable names in business. Trump has been there and done that, and he wants you, the reader, to enjoy the great taste of success, just like he has been doing for nearly three decades.out the input from Zanker, but this is still a good motivational book written by one of the most recognizable names in business.

B000NA2776|5.0|Mika should get more radio play in the US so that everyone can enjoy his unique voice and fabulous vocal range. Nominated for a Grammy for Love Today, the big hit worldwide was 'Grace Kelly', actually a far superior song, soaring through three octaves and coveying Mika's frustration at trying to get a recording deal. The American's don't seem to understand the true meaning of the song. He doesn't want to be like Grace Kelly, he is saying, what else can I try to make you (the music executive)like what I do?   ie: he's run out of ideas! Never mind, because this album has sold almost six million copies wordwide and Mika sells out concert halls everywhere he goes and the audience all seem to be able to sing along to the wonderful Grace Kelly, and leave the concert in a very happy mood indeed. The US version of this cd has the sublime track 'Erase', a perfect radio track if ever there was one! It is not on the UK version, so American's are blessed to be able to purchase a trully wonderful and diverse cd.  With talent and exceptional good looks Mika should be a much bigger hit Stateside!

B00007KWHN|5.0|Although my favorite Yes record will always be 'Close to the Edge,' 'The Yes Album' is definitely a close favorite. This record demonstrates the group at their finest. Released in 1971, this is the last record keyboardist Tony Kaye would make with the group until 1983. It was also guitarist Steve Howe's first record with the group.    Kaye would be replaced by former Strawbs keyboardist Rick Wakeman. Wakeman would be featured on the reworking of Simon & Garfunkel's 'America,' which would be recorded for a special record called 'The Golden Age Of Atlantic.'    This record, though, does feature some amazing keyboards by Kaye. 'Yours Is No Disgrace' is one of my all-time favorite Yes songs. This is an enjoyable track featuring heavy organ by Kaye.    'The Clap' features great guitar work from Howe. This was recorded live at the Lyceum Theatre in London in 1970. This would become a concert favorite for years to come.     After 'The Clap,' the record rolls right into 'Starship Trooper,' which would become yet another concert classic. Chris Squire's bass is great, Jon Anderson's vocals are amazing, and this is, in my opinion, drummer Bill Bruford's best song behind the kit with the group.    'I've Seen All Good People' is played on classic rock radio stations all the time. And it's easy to see why. This song features great vocals from Anderson, and Kaye plays some mighty fine keyboards on this one.    'A Venture' is a nice deep cut that you never hear on the radio. In fact, you never hear it anywhere. It's a shorty, clocking in at 3:21, but it's an amazing song. It fits perfectly on this record.    'Perpetual Change' closes out the record. This song is 9 minutes of excellent music. The saying 'We saved the best for last' really goes in this case. What a way to close a Yes record!    The bonus tracks are great. You get single versions of 'Your Move' and 'Life Seeker' and the studio version of 'The Clap,' which features a part of 'Mood For A Day.' This is highly recommendedfor any progressive rock, classic rock or Yes fan. ENJOY!!!
B00005MP58|5.0|Pride and Prejudice: The Special Edition is a 2-DVD set of the Arts & Entertainment movie adaptation of Jane Austen's classic romantic comedy - a novel that has never gone out of print. Directed by Simon Langton, also known for his work in \\"Upstairs, Downstairs\\", Pride and Prejudice follows the passionate and strong-willed Elizabeth Bennet, one of five unmarried daughters living in the countryside of 19th century England. In an era when a securing a wealthy or powerful marriage is the primary task of a young woman, Elizabeth's headstrong independence threatens her family's stability; her romantic sparring with Darcy forms the heart of this sweeping tale. Now digitally remastered for improved picture and sound quality, presented in anamorphic widescreen (2.35:1) for the first time in the U.S., and including extras such as a behind-the-scenes featurette and a collectible 8-page booklet, Pride and Prejudice: The Special Edition is the definitive media representation of a romance that transcends its setting.
B000QXDEDG|3.0|Visually impressive, this film captures the comic book elements of its source brilliantly. But as a tale of the Spartan stand against the Persians it is woefully unhistoric and overwrought. The Spartans are nearly all ferocious superheroes, not men at all in the ordinary sense, and they are all lovers of \\"freedom.\\" They are \\"drawn\\" (perhaps visually enhanced is a better way of putting it) with muscles on top of muscles and they are courageous and dauntless to a man. Against them are ranged the inhuman monsters of the evil Persian king Xerxes, a man who stands twice the height of an ordinary man, is shaved from head to toe, prances about nearly naked, is covered with facial and body rings in the most decadent fashion imaginable and speaks with a deep, echoing resonance suggesting he is the devil himself.<br /><br />He appears on a giant throne, drawn by slaves who are, themselves, little more than inhuman monsters, and approaches the front line to parley with good King Leonidas, the noble Spartan. Never mind that there would have been little likelihood the Persian King of Kings would have driven to the battle's front lines on a giant mobile throne, or any other contraption, to face the Spartan king and thereby risk being killed by a Spartan surprise. Xerxes was, famously, the less than successful son of his predecessor, Darius, and typically traveled surrounded by his army. There is certainly no record that he was the sort to get out in front and, centuries later, when Alexander crushed the Persians, their king stayed well back from the front and only fled when Alexander broke through. The whole picture here of Xerxes is fantasy.<br /><br />No less unrealistic than Xerxes himself, his army, seems to have been imported from another planet. At one point a soldier atop a charging rhinoceros (what human has ever been able to harness and ride a rhino?) comes plowing into the Spartan phalanxe but not to worry, for the huge beast is downed by a single well thrown Spartan spear. Ah, those Spartans!<br /><br />Xerxes' Immortals (his personal guard) and his other minions are portrayed throughout as distorted, corrupted beings, disfigured creatures we can easily imagine slaughtering in battle without pity since they aren't really human like our heroic Spartans, who live and die and eat and breathe and laugh and grieve -- just like us (or as we imagine ourselves doing). Indeed, we are given little of the Spartans' own cruel culture here or, in their constant talk of \\"freedom,\\" any revelation concerning the Helots -- Greek slaves who lived under their cruel thumb, did their bidding and were routinely sacrificed on the altar of Spartan brutality (a highly practiced strategy intended to strike fear into the Helots and make them permanently submissive to their Spartan masters).<br /><br />This film is all \\"glory\\" and bloody battle, killing and getting killed. And, while the Spartans are noble and heroic, the villains are utterly bad, including the Spartan elders or ephors, portrayed here as vile, barely human monsters living apart from other Spartans in a mystical sanctuary atop a mountain where they sexually enslave beautiful young Spartan females! Or King Leonidas' rival who rapes the good king's wife while Leonidas is off at war saving Greece from the monstrous Persians. No mention here, either, of the Spartan practice of dual kingship. Leonidas, of course, is only one of two Spartan kings but you don't get any sense of that from this film, either.<br /><br />I suppose \\"300\\" accurately portrays the comic book or \\"graphic novel\\" it was based on (at least it seems to do this visually) and that is an accomplishment of sorts. But I'd rather have seen Pressfield's [[ASIN:055338368X Gates of Fire: An Epic Novel of the Battle of Thermopylae]], itself a somewhat unseemly glorification of the Spartans, in film form than this cartoon-like rendering of these famous events. And for a more realistic view of the Spartans, themselves, one would be even better off going to Nicholas Nicastro's [[ASIN:0451217128 The Isle of Stone: A Novel of Ancient Sparta]], about the Spartan defeat by the Athenians in the famous battle of Sphacteria in the Pelopennesian War which followed the Greek defeat of Xerxes at Plataea, after the Hot Gates. (The Spartans actually ended up winning the Pelopennesian War, of course, and imposed a brief tyranny on the Athenians who ultimately managed to break free and, in alliance with other Greek City states, finally defeated the Spartans and broke their grip on the land mass of Greece. Sparta's great weakness was its elitism which kept the conquered Helots down as slaves rather than absorbing them into the nation and growing stronger from the addition of other peoples.)<br /><br />Xerxes, himself, by the way, was only a man and not an especially terrifying one at that, if the historical record is to be believed. He certainly wasn't the dread, devil incarnate this film hands us. For another view of the mighty Xerxes, you can read L. Sprague de Camp's [[ASIN:0898651964 The Dragon of the Ishtar Gate]], a really enjoyable adventure tale set in Xerxes' time which is probably truer to its era and characters -- though it is somewhat tongue-in-cheek (but more fun, for that).<br /><br />Now that would make a hell of a movie.<br /><br />SWM<br />author of [[ASIN:0738801526 The King of Vinland's Saga]][ASIN:0451217128 The Isle of Stone: A Novel of Ancient Sparta]], about the Spartan defeat by the Athenians in the famous battle of Sphacteria in the Pelopennesian War which followed the Greek defeat of Xerxes at Plataea, after the Hot Gates.

B000ZN8036|4.0|I'm sure you're wondering why I gave this 4 stars if I consider the movie to be perfect?  The thing is, this is the most inspiring movie of all time (in my opinion) and the acting is flawless, but there could have been more special features on the second disc.  I think what they have is great, but it left me wanting more instead of being fully satisfied. Perhaps adding a commentary to the film with Emile Hirsch and Sean Penn and Jon Krakauer, and on the second disc have interviews with the real people that Chris came across. The second disc contains an inside look to the characters and making of the film.  Other than lacking special features to the film, I highly suggest picking up the movie, book, and soundtrack.  All are fantastic!
B0000C23DO|5.0|The 2003 Rhino collection 'The Very Best of the Grateful Dead' is the set to own if you're a casual fan. You get 17 classic Dead songs, and for a relatively low price as well.    This set is very enjoyable. You get all of the songs a casual Deadhead will need. 'Sugar Magnolia,' 'Casey Jones,' 'Truckin,' 'Touch Of Grey,' and a great live version of 'One More Saturday Night.' This is classic rock at it's finest.    But, there are some key songs missing. 'China Doll' and the underrated classic 'And We Bid You Goodnight' should be on this set. Rhino probably should have made this a two CD set. But this is still a great set for anybody that wants a nice, single-disc collection.    And, the sound quality is amazing. Rhino did an excellent job remastering the songs. It's worth buying just for the amazing sound quality.    Highly recommended for the casual Deadhead. ENJOY!!!

Strange, given that all parents went through this phase in their life at one point, also.    \\"Into the Wild\\" provides extraordinary insight and thus is a great companion to Sean Penn's movie. Krakauer did an excellent job researching the background of Alexander Supertramp, aka Chris McCandless, and by contrasting his youth to those of his siblings and Krakauer's own experience as a young mountain climber.      As my own sons grow into adolescence, I'm scared which turn they will take. What can parents do to prevent them from taking drugs or wandering off into unknown places, trying to find or prove themselfs? What could or should parents do, helping their teenagers find a constructive and productive path into adulthood? Krakauer's book is an inspiration in this regard, but it also makes clear that there is no silver bullet, no single answer. Chris got lost in the attempt to find something, while his sister didn't. It saddens me that Chris could talk to so many people along the way, but not to his own parents. If there is one thing to learn, it is to communicate without prejudice.    The book is both inspirational and educational, in an entertaining way, and if you watch and like the movie, I highly recommend to read the book, too.
B0012QE4QC|2.0|Natalie Portman, Scarlett Johansson, Eric Bana, a bestselling novel, and an Oscar-nominated screenwriter--all these elements should form a brilliant, talented collaboration, but unfortunately the novel is hacked into an incongruent muddle of scenes which are further ruined by the atrocious editing.      It is based on Philippa Gregory's bestselling novel The Other Boleyn Girl, and tells the story of two sisters, Mary (played by Scarlett Johansson) and Anne Boleyn (played by Natalie Portman), who bother vie for King Henry VIII's (played by Eric Bana) affection (if only they knew he was not the one-girl-type). It is a time in England when girls were as their mother lady Elizabeth Boleyn (played by Kirstin Scott Thomas) put it \\"...Traded like cattle for the advancement and pleasure of men.\\" The girl's father (played by Mark Rylance) wants to catch the eye of the King to secure wealth and status by \\"pimping\\" his daughter Anne to be the King's mistress. King Henry passes over Anne in favor of the quiet submitting daughter Mary, but once she is pregnant with his illegitimate child, he quickly turns back to Anne who has returned to the court scene with a newfound sensual, seductive confidence. As Henry falls hard for Anne, Mary is quickly swept aside so the stage is set for the inevitable conclusion.      I did read the book and loved it. However I generally enjoy film adaptations no matter how far they stray from the book. Film and book are two completely different types of storytelling, so with that said the reason I did not like this film was not its major detractions from the book, but the incredible dull, emotionless production.      The acting from Natalie Portman, Eric Bana, and Kirstin Scott-Thomas was top-notch, especially Portman's (I am convinced had this been a better production and release date she would probably be garnering nominations). The rest of the cast could not hold up. Scarlet Johansson's acting was cringe-worthy as she never removed the same complacent, angelic expression from her face (she didn't even cry when her sister's head was chopped off!) and spoke in the same tone the entire film.      The production itself was not bad, the sets, costumes, etc. were all quite exquisite. The problem with this film was it had so many good aspects it could not make use of them. The editing, I must point out, was the downfall of this great story. All the scenes were so disjointed and quick that you never had time to get pulled into the story. Helping it along was the frustrating script which had lines spoken so impassively and for the sole purpose to inform the audience what was going on that it was devoid of any eloquence or originality. I felt there were whole sections left out that I knew because I had read the book, but someone new to it would be thoroughly lost.      This is such an unfortunate botching of an intriguing tale, and once again feels like the producers did not know what to do with all the talent they had. It not only is a horrible adaptation, but a very poorly done film that moved through its' material so quickly it lost its' emotional depth on the way. At the end you are left still waiting for it to start, and are so detached you do not even care about the characters whose lives were so horribly ruined. The only reason I would recommend anyone to see this film is to see Natalie Portman's performance which is utterly fascinating to watch as she plays this illustrious historical figure.

As someone who grew up in a country that called parentheses \\"brakets\\" I have reason to feel slightly more at home with some of the British usage.<br /><br />For the most part the book is strangely entertaining. Is it funny? To be honest I laughed three times by page ten and then didn't again until page 63 and 92. So it is humorous in places. I must also say that I'm siding with anyone who hates the Oxford comma.<br /><br />Lynne Truss spends a lot of time explaining its and it's. One third of the book is dedicated to the apostrophe. Which I must say had many good examples. The rest of the book is dedicated to colons, semicolons, question marks, exclamation marks, commas, hyphens, parentheses and quotation marks.<br /><br />\\"The basic rule is straightforward and logical: when the punctuation relates to the quoted words it goes inside the inverted commas; when it relates to the sentence, it goes outside. Unless, of course, you are in America.\\" ~ pg. 155<br /><br />My only real complaint is that the publisher did not adapt the entire book for an American audience. Comments are made about the difference in usage, but otherwise you are left to fend for yourself.<br /><br />~ The Rebecca Review

0385341067|5.0|Lloyd Jones's Mr. Pip imparts a hopeful message about the power that literature and storytelling have in constructing both a society's and an individual's identity.  The true heart of Jones's novel resides neither in the turmoil of the Papua New Guinean Civil War or in the ethnic differences between the two main characters, Matilda and \\"Pop Eye.\\"  Where Mr. Pip succeeds to capture the imagination of its audience most successfully is in its paralleled realization of the role a reader participates in when finding the relevance of a fictional story in order to craft a new consciousness.  The paralleled realization that takes place involves both Matilda as a newly enchanted reader and Mr. Pip's audience as the novel urges its participants to revisit the birthplace of their love for literature and storytelling.  Matilda's enthusiasm is partnered with an understanding of the world that becomes filtered through a desire to experience her chaotic world vicariously.  The literature she reads, and the stories that the villagers tell, give Matilda the strength to survive events that would be better left to a fictional world, but are all too much a veritable presence in the small, remote island of Bougainville.<br /><br />The Civil War, the fate of the characters in Mr. Pip, and the central difference of ethnicity between Matilda and \\"Pop Eye\\" are important, but what sets this novel apart from similar attempts to portray the violence and instability of these kinds of areas is its insistence on the necessity of literature and storytelling to provide the means for a community to persevere.  Mr. Pip does not fail to shock or to horrify with the severity of the events Matilda and the villagers face, but the tense and ominous atmosphere that Jones creates only serves as a backdrop to highlight the role a reader takes in not only understanding the narrative of his or her life, but in also becoming the author of his or her experience in the world.  This cannot be done alone, as the villagers stories prove, but it can be accomplished from the most unlikely sources.  Whether the author is Dickens or Jones, Matilda or the villagers, Mr. Pip serves as a reminder that the formation of a society's or individual's identity cannot be separated from each other, and it can only be enhanced through the reading of enthralling pieces of literature like this that continue to encourage our participation in the construction of our shared world.stories prove, but it can be accomplished from the most unlikely sources.

B000SVZIGC|1.0|I rented this recently thinking it would be a non violent movie for my children to watch.  I was SO wrong.  This is a terrifying movie for young viewers.  It is also very hard for children to comprehend the story line.  I think I'm done with Disney animated movies from now on.  Yuck.
B000OCXFCO|5.0|It's a statement from Dave Mustaine to Metallica and the rest of the metal world saying \\"This is how it's done kids.\\"    The style is like a cross between \\"Peace Sells...But Who's Buying?\\", \\"Rust in Peace\\", and \\"Countdown to Extinction\\" (their 3 best albums from their golden years). The new band spear-headed by the Drover brothers is incredible. Once upon a time, the Abbott brothers (Dimebag and Vinnie Paul) almost joined Megadeth. Circumstances kept that from happening that time, but not this time (too bad Glen Drover has since left the band). Glen Drover is completely awesome and his smooth flowing style complements Mustaine's rough and tough style perfectly. Shawn Drover is the best drummer since the original drummer, the great Gar Samuelson. Come to think of it, they sound a lot like Dimebag and Vinnie.    And it's true what the Amazon reviewer says...the fact that a band, 25 years after its formation, can release an album like this is incredible. Make no mistake, this IS one of Megadeth's BEST albums. It really shows what an absolute genius Mustaine is. The man is just dripping with awesome riffs and solos. He is the best and most prolific metal riff creator of all time. Let's hope this is the start of a new golden era of Megadeth.

0385341067|4.0|Mister Pip by Lloyd Jones is a novel about the power of perspectives. Its protagonist, Mr. Watts, is the only white man on the island, and steps up to become the only teacher for the children. (Of course as we read on, we see Mr. Watts invites different members of the community to come to the school and give their own lesson on whatever it is they know.) Mr. Watt's only material to teach with is a copy of Mr. Charles Dickens Great Expectations. The students, including a young native Matilda, learn to escape their own reality by becoming a part of Pip's world.   At this point of the novel I was very excited of Lloyd Jones' ideas. My own personal philosophy for teaching is to open the minds and perspectives of students using literature--and that's what Mr. Watts does. But it is not much later in the novel when readers see that's not what it's all about.   The horrific events that occur on the island makes readers realize this book is about much more. It's about Matilda's suffering and survival. It's about her ability to absorb all she's learned from Mr. Watts and her mother, and become a stronger person. Mr. Watt's initial lesson, teaching the children of the island how to view life through Pip's eyes, turned into a life lesson for Matilda: the ability to view life through anyone's eyes.
B00005JMJG|5.0|Relationships can end terribly and if they do, most of the people involved want to forget that it ever happened. Well, what if that was an option for separated couples? What if people could actually erase their memory of a failed relationship and partner? And most importantly, would it be worth it? \\"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\\" asks these questions as the film wonderfully and cleverly unfolds. Never have I seen a film that I and others can easily relate to. This film is wonderfully acted, sports amazing direction, and is extremely touching when it comes to its characters and subject matter.     Joel Barish (Jim Carrey) learns that his girlfriend, Clementine (Kate Winslet) has had their relationship erased from her memory by Lacuna Inc, run by Dr. Mierzwiak (Tom Wilkinson). Not knowing what to do, he decides to have the process done as well, wanting Clementine out of his mind for good. Once Mierzwiak and his fellow workers, Stan (Mark Ruffalo), Patrick (Elijah Wood), and Mary (Kirsten Dunst) have begun to delete Joel's memory of the relationship one frame at a time, Joel discovers that that there are aspects of the relationship that he wants to keep. Thus, he journeys through his mind as he tries to preserve as much memory of Clementine as he can, hoping she won't be erased forever.     \\"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\\" is a film that is rare in Hollywood these days. It's engaging, touching, funny, realistic, and most of all, original. Expertly written by Charlie Kaufman and Michel Gondry, it's a film that expresses how important relationships are regardless of how much they may hurt at times.     Jim Carrey (best known for his roles in \\"Dumb and Dumber\\" and \\"Ace Ventura\\" films) truly shines here as Joel. From desperate to getting rid of Clementine to desperate trying to keep her, he handles it perfectly. The chemistry Carrey has with Kate Winslet is genuine and real. Speaking of Winslet, her quirky Clementine is the ying to awkward Joel's yang. Again, perfect. All the other performances are great as well and really help round out the film.     This is a Michel Gondry meaning one can expect something visually unique and original, and he doesn't disappoint in this department. The story moves at a brisk pace and never in linear fashion. It's quite complex and should be watched more than once to truly appreciate what is happening. Gondry utilizes subtle, but amazing special effects to portray Joel's crumbling mind and his use of color is outstanding. Without his direction, the film wouldn't be as great as it is.     Michel Gondry's, \\"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind,\\" is a film that needs to be seen by everyone. A complex, original story filled with lively characters and a relatable situation. Most importantly though, it's moved me in ways that films rarely can. And that's saying something.
B000ZLFALI|5.0|The most enjoyable and creative movie that I have seen in a very long time.
6305128952|1.0|I am embarrassed to say that I actually watched this movie in its entirety. I usually like a romantic movie just not when it involves adultury.     A married woman finds new love on a ranch with a horse trainer but decides in the end to get back with her husband. There you go. Don't waist your time on this seemingly endless movie.
0143038419|1.0|The metaphors are tired and obvious, and the author is painfully shallow--even the premise shows her lack of depth and understanding:  she's wants to combine spirituality and materialism; clearly, she just doesn't get it.  And she admits that the whole point of her travels was her desire to write a book; it's not like she traveled and THEN decided to write it.  I can't believe (some) people like this book.  I had to force myself to finish it, and I hated the author during the entire experience.  Don't waste your time.
0385338724|3.0|This is a very light, fun book that does not require a lot of thought or analyzing.  It won't change your life or make you look at things differently.  But sometimes that is what you need!  It's a very quick and entertaining read that makes you laugh out loud.  Sometimes I think because the plot is so airy and light one overlooks the quality of the writing.  The writing is actually quite good-the author manages to keep your interest and speeds the story right along.  Recommended as a good beach or airplane read, or when you just need to relax and forget about life for a couple of hours.
0689878451|5.0|In response to comments about homosexuality being \\"unnatural,\\" the authors present the true story of a couple of male penguins who are given an egg, hatch it and raise it, making one big happy family.  An excellent book to read to children just noticing that someone might have two moms or two dads and great for parents wanting to present positive images of both straight and gay families.  This book absolutly does not mention sex in any way-these are two guy penguins who like each other alot and really want to raise a baby penguin like they see other penguin couples doing.<br />Adorable artwork, simple enough writing-good for read aloud or early readers, up through about 2nd grade (if kids know lots of gay people) or older (if the kids aren't ever introduced to gay people or couples).<br /><br />This book is worth defending in libraries.
B0001D0FTW|5.0|The first song I ever heard from Edguy was \\"Mysteria\\" - I heard the opener \\"Ladies and Gentlemen, welcome to the freakshow!\\" and then that heavy riff came in. I was like \\"alright, this sounds sweet\\" but then when I hear that high pitch vibrato yell from Tobias Sammett with the blasting drums and muscular guitar riffs, I fell in love with the song already. It definitely had me demanding for more from these guys - so I gave the entire album a listen. These guys are just so unique to other power metal bands in the genre with a great variety of influences from Helloween, to Iron Maiden (Sammett sounds just like Dickinson!) and even 80s rock (listen to Lavatory Love Machine). You've got some intense and heavy riffs with songs too like the beginning of \\"Mysteria\\" and \\"Under The Moon\\" and songs are definitely catchy you just have to sing along with them! Melodic, heavy, diverse - it's what makes a super metal album. Edguy delivers a style of metal that is worth hearing.
0765348276|3.0|After reading \\"Ghost Brigades,\\" I reread Scalzi's first novel for comparison. It still seems to me to have the same strengths and weaknesses that I saw in it two years ago. I have read a big chunk of the Heinlein canon, and have both loved and hated him with equal fervor at different times (engaging old misogynist!). To say that Scalzi is influenced by Heinlein is a gross understatement: this book reads as if Scalzi was at a seance and Heinlein showed up for a little psychography. It's not eerie, it's disturbing. That said, it's a good story and an interesting environment, and given that his next books don't suffer from Heinlein ventriloquism, I'm glad Tor Publishing took a chance on him and continued to back him. Fortunately, this is not Scalzi's best work.
B0006L89N8|5.0|This book is EXCELLENT!  As a Clinical Psychologist I avoided this 'pop psychology' book for a few years, but finally succumbed when many clients mentioned how helpful they had found it.  I read it, and now recommend it frequently to those struggling with the typical relationship difficulties, along with Aaron Beck's Love is Never Enough..  On a personal level, I too found this a very enlightening book, which deals with what can become difficult issues, with terrific humour - which lightens the whole situation.  Cannot recommend it highly enough...  Thankyou John Gray..

0790729725|5.0|This is a film that Scorsese should have won the Oscar for, not \\"The Departed.\\"      Goodfellas follows the life of Henry Hill through his life with the Mafia.  The story is based on the real-life Henry Hill.    This film really established Joe Pesci and Ray Liotta as solid actors.  With Robert De Niro and Lorraine Bracco, the cast was just perfect.  The acting was great all around and the plot was very entertaining.    Unlike what is seen in \\"The Godfather,\\" Goodfellas probably more accurately portrays what real life is like in the Mafia, atleast from what I've read.  Not that \\"The Godfather\\" isn't any good, it's great but it almost glorifies that lifestyle to an extent.    Anyway,  as I said, the plot is entertaining and this is a film you could watch more than once.  The characters are interesting and the humor is appropriate.  There is some graphic violence as to be expected but it is not over the top.  There's plenty of foul language but again, it's not over the top.    Overall, this is a film that you must see, if for nothing else to see Joe Pesci's famous \\"am I a clown\\" scene.
B000W8OM2C|3.0|Anyone looking to buy this film because it has Ziyi Zhang's name attached to it, beware; she shows up in the last couple minutes of the film and doesn't even fight. Don't let the cover fool you. But having said that, can't blame the manufacturer for trying to play up her name-the film is actually fun, although not very accurate. The same actress plays the role of \\"The Boss\\" as in the first film and I've gotten to like her; she's a good actress. But that acting doesn't include martial arts-she can't do 'em so a stunt-double that I am pretty suspicious is actually a man does all the stunt work and martial arts. But boy, can the stunt double perform! You will see some really amazing moves. The other problem with this film is continuity from the first. In the first film, the Boss gets married because her long-lost dying sister wants her to. The second film finds the Boss with a bad case of amnesia and working in a restaurant. When she inevitably remembers who she is and is reunited with her gang, there is no sign or mention of a husband or sister. I guess the actors had other projects to do. But if you can forget all that, it's still a fun movie to watch, especially for the martial arts.
0765348276|4.0|Old Man's War pleasantly surprised me. Being a fervent follower of sci-fi since I read Starship Trooper at a very early age, I cut my teeth on Heinlein, Clarke, and Asimov. Joe Haldeman soon followed as another favored author of hard sci-fi. John Scalzi's writing (especially in this book) reminds me of those stalwarts of the genre that I so enjoy. You quickly find yourself wrapped up in the story as it moves along at a comfortable pace. The story is well thought out and as believable as any of these tales can be. The main character is likeable as is the supporting \\"cast\\".  Overall, a very good start to a series.  I hope The Ghost Brigades and The Last Colony do it justice.
0312323867|4.0|First of all, Darcy can be an incredibly despicable person.  This is true.  However, I loved reading about her and the way she thinks.  I also enjoyed the character of Ethan.  I found him to be quite challenging to Darcy.  He also was interesting and incredibly intelligent.    Darcy is superficial and living high on the mountain in her glam PR job in New York city.  However, this all ends when she ends up pregnant by the best friend of her fiancee'.  So, its a sticky situation.  It gets even stickier when her best friend Rachel, whom Darcy always thought of as mousy, steals the heart of her fiancee'.      Now, Darcy leaves and begins anew in England.  I like the way Darcy explores who she is and becomes a much better person.  However, I must confess, I would REALLY HAVE PREFERRED a much more realistic approach to this self journey to positivity.  I would have like to read about more obstacles, more challenges, etc. etc.  I think if this was a book to be viewed in a more real-world context, I think her path should have been rockier.  She moves to England and her old friend just magically supports her for several months...not very believable.  NOT believable.    In any case, this is an enjoyable read.  It is not fiction on a thought-provoking level, but it is a great deal of fun!

The tools and beliefs that served for well for my first 32 years of being me were no longer effective; they were not bad or wrong; they just no longer served. The other books and trainings were great and informative, but with the 4-Step NVC model I was able to realize results from day one.<br /><br />The book is a quick read in an easy to understand format. There is no \\"nu-nu, na-na\\" terms or phrases that tend to turn off or alienate the spiritual initiate or layman. The 4-step model is easy to understand both in terms of everyday use and in underlying logic of why and how it works. One is able to put the process into use from day one; indeed from page one. Nonviolent Communication: A Language of Life  is not the thickest book in my personal library (248 pages) but it is definitely the most effective when it comes to interpersonal communications, bar none.
B00000IQC8|4.0|An interesting look in the lifes of a handful of people working at and hanging around a small grocery store and video store. This microcosm is filmed in black and white either for economy or perception. The story is not dull and a fair amount of wit is layed upon us. Overall a decent work if you enjoy character developed stories like \\"Crash\\". Although this may not have the cast or budget of that magnitude, it stands up well against such comparison. At first I thought this was just going to be a comedy about shopkeepers, but it goes well beyond any superficial farce. I recommend it at least as a rental and there is a good chance you may want to add it to your collection. Good quality DVD, lots of extras, and good replayability.

0385341067|3.0|Mister Pip by Lloyd Jones convinced me to give Dickens one more try. I had decided long ago that Dickens was unsuitable for ninth-graders, was unsuitable for light reading, and was generally irrelevant to the modern world. The knowledge that there were perfectly sane people my own age who found humor in Dickens surprised me. The idea that a book by Dickens would be suitable to a number of young children in a coastal village of Papua New Guinea (or so I'm told that's where the story takes place) did not seem in keeping with my conception of the world. Exactly why don't the students have their own narratives, but must be given one by Mr. Watts, the only white man available? The novel's allure could be partly explained by the narrator's desire to break free from the traditionalism (made more embarrassing to the daughter by a mixture of Christian evangelism) of her mother, but it is odd that she resorts to simply a third form of imposed traditionalism. In the end, I was convinced that \\"Great Expectations\\" could amuse me, but I am still uncertain how suitable it was to the narrator Matilda. But then, she says herself that matters of taste are highly mysterious, and perhaps I should accept that.  I will say that I admire Lloyd Jones attempt to create a narrative in the voice of Matilda, a character with a different gender, status, age and ethnicity from the author. His observations on social difference are simple and honest. The children say that to be black is to be normal, but later everyone acknowledges that you only feel like a certain race when you are around another race.  The novel progresses as an ideal example of reader response. Matilda and the other children take a book which scarcely applies to them and focus and expand on the basic elements of coming-of age they share in common. The novel, well aware of the latest understanding of post-traumatic stress disorder and coping strategies, shows how Matilda uses the class as an escape from the civil war on her island. Yet the reader is often aware of how unprotected everyone is, and how little the book helps them. The book functions much more effectively as a way for Mr. Watts to lay his ghosts to rest, but one feels that Mr. Watts is hardly the character most in need of comfort. Thus, Mister Pip always seems to run the risk of embarrassing itself. Partly to circumvent this, even in the process of disenchantment about Mr. Watts past, the extent to which he is to blame for his suffering is left vague.  While it is almost forbidden in a review to say that enjoying this book is merely a matter of taste, that remains the most honest assessment I can give in light of my own reservations.
B00000JSJC|2.0|Back in the mid 1990s there was talk about how Katherine Bigelow (ex of James Cameroon and director of popular shows like Near Dark and Point Break) was doing a new movie with state of the art POV (point of view) content that used new camera techniques to put the viewer inside someone's head. The reason for this was to film James Cameron's vision of a world where people are able to record others people's lives via a neural net interface for playback... a sort of hippy drug for the turn of the Millennium. There was a lot of hype about this film.<br /><br />Unfortunately Strange Days never lived up to its expectations. The film contained a lot of music sequences (such as bands playing) with lyrics that are frankly, bad. Just listening to the rap video makes you ask why they didn't even attempt to rhyme? It was dreadful then... and it's horrible today.<br /><br />Ralph Fiennes' American accent was as inept as the script's one-liners with a delivery that didn't pay off.  Jennifer Lewis did lots of nudity for what seems like the sake of nudity and quite frankly most of us would prefer her with her clothes back on. Talented actors, such as Vincent D'Onofrio cop running around chasing people, are completely wasted.<br /><br />While there is an interesting twist involving the sudden appearance of a serial killer the film gets boring and overlong with action sequences and back stories that never once stir our imagination or make a hair stand on end. To top it off the coolness expected of Bigelow's production is lost somewhere between bad hairdos and bad karma. Given that James Cameron is supposed to be a major part of it, Strange Days is a horrible let down. In the end the bad guy even reveals everything. The editing during this sequence is some of the worst ever committed. Strange Days had a lot of potential with big names and a considerable budget. The end result is an incoherent mess and defines the word disappointment.
B000LXH0AE|5.0|Stranger Than Fiction is a perfect film with one tiny flaw: it doesn't actually make sense. But such flagrant disregard for narrative logic is inseparable from the film's charm, and whether directly inspired by Charlie Kaufman's cinema of self-analysis, it's probably safe to say that the film wouldn't exist without Kaufman's precedent for non-linear, anti-logic meta-narratives. Stranger Than Fiction is less lacerating in its wit and less dark and scabrous in its insights than Kaufman, but considerably more affecting. It's also closer to perfection as a post-millennial, pre-apocalypse schizophrenic romantic comedy, and confirms that the schizo comedy more or less invented by Kaufman (after some early flirtations by Woody Allen) is the natural evolution of the rom-com genre. Current times are far too precarious for a simple \\"boy-meets-girl\\" scenario to adequately distract us from our collective anxieties anymore.<br /><br />Reflecting what amounts to a global identity crisis, the film is populated by semi-functional lost souls doing what they can to keep their heads above the waters of despair. An OCD IRS worker (Will Ferrell) falls in love with a tattooed Harvard drop-out and failed revolutionary, resigned to baking cookies for a better world (the ever-enrapturing Maggie Gyllenhaal); an acclaimed author and suicide manqu&eacute; suffers from guilt and uncertainty over her literary gift and her wont for killing off characters (a deglamorized Emma Thompson is the tortured soul of the film); a literature professor for whom books are more real than people (another terrific turn by Dustin Hoffman, well on his way to career resurrection in offbeat supporting comedy roles). All characters in search of something if only they knew what, who have taken refuge in their routines in order to survive. Such eccentric characters are perfectly at home in what amounts to a self-reflective, self-referential, meta-comedy, in which fictional beings grasp to be real.<br /><br />Stranger Than Fiction concerns a character in a novel who realizes that he is part of a fictional narrative and attempts to break out of the story (the inevitability of his own death) and meet his maker. The moment he does, he becomes a character in her life, which thereby becomes fiction--the movie we are seeing. It was impossible for me not to try and figure out if Stranger Than Fiction made sense, even while I was engaged in the blissful act of watching it. Fortunately, it was equally impossible to decide with any certainty, and in the end I realized it didn't really matter much. Since we don't have the opportunity to read the novel that Katherine Eiffel is writing, we can't know how much of the protagonist's life (i.e., the movie) is already captured by her fiction. Logically, however, the movie cannot really cohere, since Harold Crick (named after one of the inventors of DNA?), by finding out that a novel is being written about his life, would surely change the fiction's trajectory entirely. He hears the author narrating his life, for example, but he doesn't hear a narration about his hearing the narration, as would presumably be the case, within the (apparent) logic of the movie. Such an idea would force the story to replicate ad infinitum, spinning worlds within worlds, fictions within fictions, mirrors inside mirrors--a reflective universe in which there would be, finally, no object to be reflected.<br /><br />Stranger Than Fiction shies away from the giddier and more psychedelic implications; wisely but also perhaps timidly, it does not venture where shamans and schizophrenics are compelled to tread, staying instead on the safer (and sweeter) ground of life-affirming (and death-defeating) romantic comedy. It flirts with tragedy, but never dares to consummate. It dips its toes into the dark waters of madness, but never plunges in. What makes Stranger Than Fiction different from other feel-good movies is that it actually earns our good feelings. It doesn't sell itselfshort to please us. It's eccentric and unique enough to create a sense of uncertainty as to where it's going, and the resulting tension--the sense of the unexpected and the feeling that anything can happen--creates a fair imitation both our own lives and of Crick's particular terror of losing control. As with Kaufman, almost every line in the film comes as a surprise; the scenes keep us guessing and the film seems fresh, uncalculated, uncontrived, effortless. The energy and lightness of Marc Forster's direction, and the playful ingenuity of Zach Helm's script, give the impression that the filmmakers are surprising even themselves. The film crackles with laughter and pathos, the laughs are easy and grateful, the tears sweet and unsullied by sentimentality. The beautiful irony of Stranger Than Fiction is that, by making Crick semi-fictional within his own life, he comes to seem far more real than most movie protagonists ever do. I think it's the best film of 2006.<br /><br />The film is so breezily anarchic that there is even some doubt whether it will wind up as a tragedy (the IRS man might have to die for his sins). One of the touching quirks of the movie (and of Will Ferrell's pitch-perfect performance) is that the \\"soulless\\" civil servant is the most innocent and endearing character in the film, while it is the tormented artist-writer whose soul is in jeopardy. When Eiffel discovers her character is a living, breathing person--not merely the concatenation of her genius--she is forced to face up to a new and disturbing sense of responsibility. The question arises: as a \\"creator,\\" is being true to her tale necessarily \\"right\\" for the character in it? This is not exactly a moral question; it goes deeper than mere morality, which after all entails ordinary human relations within an ordinary social context. Stranger Than Fiction raises the question of a God who lacks compassion for its creations, forced to face up to her own conscience by those same creations. Perhaps s/he even became a creator in the first place in order to learn such compassion? By her decision to abandon the necessary ruthlessness of tragedy and let Harold live, Eiffel may become a \\"lesser\\" (i.e. less-obsessed) writer, but she becomes a better person. She has learned that there is more to real fiction than taking lives, that there is a time for mercy as well as sacrifice. As any creator worth her salt knows, there is no tragedy without comedy, no laughter without tears.entric and unique enough to create a sense of uncertainty as to where it's going, and the resulting tension--the sense of the unexpected and the feeling that anything can happen--creates a fair imitation both our own lives and of Crick's particular terror of losing control.

B000W7JWUA|5.0|I was first introduced to the Settlers of Catan at a friend's house, and I fell in love with it from day one. The game itself is not too simple, not too hard, and contains a good mix of strategy and luck. It is simple enough for the beginner (though I would imagine the game is above the abilities of really young children), provides enough change (the board is different each game) for the average player, and provides ample places for strategy for the expert. All in all, it covers the spectrum of players well, and it is very addicting!<br /><br />As for the durability of the game, the board pieces are a very sturdy cardboard, the playing pieces are made of painted wood, and the cards are printed on high quality cardstock. With a lot of playing (like playing a couple times a week for a year or so) the cards can get worn out but it is simple to buy a replacement set of cards for a reasonable amount of money, and if you have gotten that much play time out of the game, it is worth it!<br /><br />One thing to note: there are lots of small (easily lost) pieces to this game, so if you tend to lose things, this could be a problem.

B000EHRVP6|1.0|I am not one to take moral stances, much less on movies. But in this case I am sorely tempted. Tarantino should have his head examined for supporting something as grotesque as this. That said, it does have some powerful imagery, once the barbarism begins (the first hour was just crap), and obviously it evoked a strong emotional response in me. But how hard is it to get an emotional response from scenes of graphic torture? (I felt the same about Tarantino's ear-slicing scene in Dogs, which was just exploitation cinema done up in new, postmodern rags). The film was disturbing, sure, but at a visceral rather than psychological level. Footage of animal experimentation would also be disturbing. Big deal.<br /><br />What I admire about movies like Blue Velvet and Casualties of War (also M), and even Texas Chainsaw Massacre, is the way they get to the psychological roots of sadism, (by) creating empathy not just for the victims (easy enough, obviously), but for the perpetrators also. Tarantino seems devoid of empathy as a filmmaker. It's hard to imagine a greater defect (I think Kubrick suffered from it too, however, so I guess there are ways around it!). He delights in depicting scenes of pain and dismemberment with all the sadistic relish of a Goebbels.<br /><br />They say a society gets the heroes it deserves. Tarantino's success strikes me as (like everything) symptomatic of just how \\"depraved\\" (removed from basic human qualities like compassion, introspection, kindness) audiences have become, that they would take pleasure in what amount to sadistic orgies of violence with no leavening \\"moral\\" (i.e. artistic) intent behind them.<br /><br />In the end, there can be no credible argument made for censorship of any kind. But if there was, Hostel would be exhibit A.

B000MNP2KI|4.0|I was not expecting a great deal from this and I was pleasantly impressed. Amazed even. Easily (easily) the best Bond movie since From Russia with Love; frankly, it is the best Bond movie ever. The reason is that it is the first of the films that manages to be even faintly realistic, that is character as much as plot driven. The plot in fact is nothing special, but the handling of the scenes is refreshingly raw and gritty (not quite Bourne Identity, but close enough); for the first time ever, James Bond seems like a real personality and not just a fantasy figure, capable of suffering and other human emotions. Special praises go to Craig, who is a revelation. Eva Green doesn't do badly either: tho she weirdly fluctuates between divinely pretty and almost mannish (she looks way better without make-up), Green is extremely affecting as the first flesh and blood Bond girl. What really distinguishes this movie from other Bonds, however, is the touch of a real writer - Paul Haggis, whose hand is evident throughout the proceedings. There is actually something going on beneath the scenes now, psychological undercurrents, character dynamics, tensions; at least half the time, this is not just a good Bond movie: it's a good movie. I didn't even notice that the Bond theme wasn't being used until moments before the end when it finally appears - I had almost forgotten I was watching a Bond movie at all (yes, that's a compliment). These last few moments, after all that has gone before, made me very nearly euphoric. Never mind the fact that they celebrate Bond's acceptance of his fundamental soullessness and embracing his dubious destiny as a cold-blooded killer fantasy hero! This is cracking entertainment and final, unexpected proof that there is life in the old dodo yet.
B000ZN8036|4.0|Very good movie. Period. Won't bore you w/ the characters, plot, etc. I'm quite sure you are already familiar. I wanted to respond to a review by a Dr. Coulardeau, who's take on the film is insightful, as well as very practical. But the practicality of the drive behind McCandless' quest is non-existant. From what I perceived both from the book and the movie, is that, yes, McCandless did, towards the end, get extremely frustrated with himself for not being more prepared, and then even more enraged for being careless with the poisonous plant. But I think that he died happy. I think had he taken the more practical approach and accept the confines of what modern life offers, he would've ended up leading a miserable life. Sometimes, one has to look through the eyes of the person seeking their quest to fully understand and appreciate what they would consider a success, and not simply to look at it through the eyes of practicality. I applaud McCandless for having the courage to attempt to find what he considered freedom. Sometimes being practical doesn't enter into such a grand quest.
B000ZN8036|4.0|Based on Jon Krakauer's book about the true story of Chris McCandless, Sean Penn's Into the Wild is a powerful movie. As a writer-director, Penn has a way of cutting to the bone of his subject--he has an eye and ear that is almost unique in American movies, and he manages to be soulful without a trace of sentimentality (he gets away with lines that would turn to mush in anyone else's hands). There's a core of pathos to his film which I'm not sure I've ever seen before.<br /><br />This may be personal prejudice: the story of a young post-graduate student who gives up his inheritance and abandons a cozy life to wander across the US without a word to his family, and who ends up dying alone in the wilderness of Alaska, has special resonance for me because I did something similar, at almost the same age as McCandless. I didn't go to the wilds of Alaska and live in a bus--I went to Morocco and lived hand-to-mouth on the streets of Tangier--but the intent was the same: to get free from the suffocating context (and comforts) of a life that had defined me, and see what remained.<br /><br />Chris McCandless is played by Emile Hirsch, last seen as the despicable Johnny Truelove in Alpha Dog, and it's hard to imagine two more different roles. Hirsch has just the right qualities of strength and guilelessness here, the innocence and stubbornness that characterized McCandless. Chris is only interested in getting to the truth, whatever the cost in suffering (starting with his own: since his heart was broken, he has no qualms about breaking anyone else's). By the end of his journey (we know this because he kept a journal), he realizes that whatever truth or happiness he finds in the wild is meaningless without someone to share it with. His desire to connect to Nature and so come to know his own truth is incomplete without a connection to others. This may be the final truth that McCandless realized; in a way, it's the truth that killed him--or rather, that he had to die to discover.<br /><br />It's tempting to call Into the Wild a tragedy. It's devastatingly painful to watch and the tendency is to seek a word to encompass that pain. But I don't think it's true; Chris made a choice to live on his terms; if someone had asked him if he was willing to die for them, I have no doubt he would have said yes. He died doing exactly what he wanted to do, and where's the tragedy in that? If anything, Chris was an old-fashioned hero on a traditional quest for truth, but he was not a tragic hero. His \\"flaw\\" was in his naivet&eacute;, but this was inseparable from his integrity and vision: he knew he might die in Alaska but went anyway. He was prepared; it's just that his preparations weren't enough.<br /><br />It's been years since I read the book, but so far as I know (and by most accounts), the film sticks close to Krakauer's account, which was itself close to being an accurate report of Chris' journey. Yet Into the Wild has the strength and simplicity--the moral force--of a fable, and with any luck that's what audiences will respond to (those who don't reject Chris outright as \\"selfish\\" or arrogant and dismiss his death as meaningless). What Chris chose--to leave it all behind and return to the wilderness to find out what he was made of--is surely something any sensitive person in today's world can relate to. But it was more than a London-esque test of manhood or rite of passage (though it was certainly that), it was the searching of a poetic soul for meaning, of a highly sensitive and intelligent kid determined to strip away the layers that came between him and the truth, to remove all the masks and see what was behind them. In a way, Chris' death was testimony not to his own folly, his obsession, but to the world's failure to provide any meanings for Chris to believe in. The tragedy, then, is the tragedy of the world, a world represented by Chris' parents, who pay the ultimate price for their failure, which is their incapacity to love their son in a waythat is truthful.<br /><br />If Chris unconsciously chose to die rather than to live in a world in which he found nothing--no values--worth living for, who can blame him? His death had more meaning than the life his parents wished for him ever could: it was at least his own meaning, his choice. As a writer and director, Sean Penn doesn't belabor any of this. He doesn't make the mistake of bringing the parable-like qualities of his tale to the surface. He focuses on the story and on bringing his characters to life, and lets the rest take care of itself; the metaphor is all the more powerful for being \\"found\\" rather than imposed. This is a true story, and what Penn has in common with his protagonist is an absolute commitment to--and an almost prodigious gift for--honesty. Scene for scene, I don't think there is a single false note in the movie, and though the film is long, there's nothing here that feels superfluous. All the characters bring something unique to the story; their presence serves to develop Chris as a character, giving him a context he would otherwise lack--their affection deepens him in our eyes. William Hurt and Marcia Gay Harden as Chris's parents, Jena Malone as his sister, Vince Vaughn as his friend and employer Wayne, Catherine Keener and Brian Dierker as an aging hippie couple he rides with, Hal Holbrook as Ron Franz, Kristen Stewart, as the achingly beautiful teenage girl who takes Chris to Salvation mountain, all provide bittersweet memories--snapshots of the heart--that Chris takes with him into the wild.<br /><br />Penn occasionally overdoes his effects, most particularly his use of slow motion, and at times the film veers dangerously close to narcissism with imagery fit for aftershave commercials. And there are a couple of times when he borders on self-consciousness (such as when the old man Ron talks of God's light and the sun breaks through the clouds); but these are just glitches in an otherwise flawless tapestry. Into the Wild is a tour-de-force, and yet (besides these moments) it never seems to be working on getting an emotional reaction. Penn doesn't mess around; he gets his effects and moves on, his style is clean and confident--both poetic and prosaic at the same time. He lets the power of the images--and the emotional punch of the tale itself--carry the movie along. The film builds gradually, lyrically, with all the grace and tempo of an epic poem, into a devastating crescendo of imagery and a heartbreaking climax.<br /><br />The empathy Penn shows for his characters (inseparable from the actors), his affinity for everyday Middle America (the film is shot entirely on location, often in Chris' exact \\"footprint,\\" according to Penn), and the honesty and pathos of the film would be remarkable in any artist, but for someone once married to Madonna who has spent the past twenty-five years as a world famous movie star (Penn's breakthrough role was in Taps, at 21 years old), it's testimony to Penn's integrity as an artist that the film is almost entirely devoid of inauthentic touches or condescension. It seems to come directly from his heart to us.<br /><br />Into the Wild is an X-ray of the heart, showing all its intricacies and flaws, its longings and wounds. It draws a delicate yet raw portrait of the human condition honestly and compassionately, and it reveals the tragedy, not in Chris' death, but in the possibility that his death was the only honest response to a life he refused to take part in. What Penn has done--besides the formidable task of presenting this sorrowful tale in a straightforward and truthful fashion--is what the greatest poets have always strived to do: to reveal the soul's longings, and reflect our own souls back at us.<br /><br />As Pauline Kael once wrote (of Francis Coppola's Godfather Part Two): that's the voice of the authentic hero.sciously chose to die rather than to live in a world in which he found nothing--no values--worth living for, who can blame him?

B000MZHW40|3.0|Blood Diamond is a terrific bit of genre entertainment from Edward Zwick, the director of Glory, The Siege, and the somewhat laughable Tom Cruise vehicle The Last Samurai. However, if you are looking for a serious treatment of controversial subject matter--illegal slave labor diamond mining in South Africa--this may not be the movie for you. Blood Diamond isn't so much a political drama with action sequences (even if Zwick believes that's what he's making) as an action thriller with a convenient political backdrop to lend it some urgency and gravitas. It's a movie, after all, and if Syriana is anything to go by--which was so utterly incomprehensible critics had no choice but to praise it--then politics and cinema simply don't mix. Blood Diamond is considerably more poignant and moving than your average action thriller, however, and this is mostly due to Leonardo DeCaprio giving his first grown-up performance, as the embittered, hardened, and resourceful diamond smuggler Danny Archer.<br /><br />In his earliest roles--the young retard in What's Eating Gilbert Grape, Robert DeNiro's battered son in This Boy's Life, The Basketball Diaries, The Quick and the Dead, and as the young Rimbaud in Total Eclipse--DeCaprio was shaping up to be one of the most exciting actors since the young Robert DeNiro. But then something went wrong. He became a megastar with Titanic and got all buffed up for The Beach, and with his thick neck and his small round head, his Dr. Spock eyebrows and pallid skin, he began to look like he'd got stuck somewhere between adolescence and adulthood. As a result, he seemed miscast in the adult roles he was given (most of all as Howard Hughes), as if the qualities that made him such a mesmerizing actor as an adolescent made him almost uncastable as an adult. In his work for Scorsese especially (Gangs of New York, The Aviator, The Departed), he seemed to lack any substance or weight as an a actor, and he was a negligible presence. (The exception was Spielberg's Catch Me If You Can, in which DeCaprio's guilelessness and elfin features--his apparent immaturity--fitted well enough with the Walter Mitty-ish role.)<br /><br />For Blood Diamond, DeCaprio assumes a thick, rather endearing South African accent and gives an impressive performance of contained intensity and depth. For the first time since those early roles, he seems to be tapping the reserves of his talent. If in his last few performances he seemed to be coasting, here he has apparently come to full attention. All of a sudden his acting is full of surprises--of small, almost throwaway touches, the kind of moments that create a fully formed, deeply affecting character. With this role, DeCaprio has rediscovered his instinct for acting--so formidable in those early roles--and with it his passion. Without him, Blood Diamond would be a so-so political thriller; with him, it's something more poignant and memorable.<br /><br />Jennifer Connelly doesn't fare quite so well, alas, in an underwritten part as the conscience-driven journalist. In her early scenes, Connelly is poorly directed and too heavily made up (beauty like this doesn't need make up); she appears to be overplaying to compensate for the lack of a character, and for some unfathomable reason she is practically salivating over DeCaprio. Later, she is more contained, and has some affecting moments. She does the best she can with this earnest, two-dimensional role, that of the dedicated journalist/free spirit torn between conscience and ambition.<br /><br />The main role really belongs to Djimon Hounsou as the noble black man trying to find his family, and Hounsou's Solomon is a powerful presence, the heart of the film. As an actor, he's the ideal complementary presence for DeCaprio's edgy, ruthless egotism, and together they make the most unlikely (and touching) of friendships. This is all familiar stuff, of course, and besides the performances and the political back story, there's nothing really new aboutBlood Diamond--just another blood thriller dressed up as a tale of government corruption and personal redemption. But it's an exemplary model--a muscular action movie with heart (if not brains) as well as brawn.d thriller dressed up as a tale of government corruption and personal redemption.

It was funny in many parts, although I wouldn't claim that it was as thorough as some other books deal with this subject.  It was sort of banal in many ways, but definitely worth reading.  What I mean by some of my previous statements is that in many literary journals writers try to tackle the banal but it comes of as boring.  This book never does, it maintains a dramatic touch, and a bit of suspense to go along with the banal.

B000E41MS6|5.0|Now to start off I must admit something, I was never a fan of the old series as I simply saw them as too silly and a bit too pompous. Also before I address the actual show I would like to address a reviewer who gave this 1 star by saying the Dr. calls the Tardis a spaceship and it never leaves Earth. This displays that you obviously haven't been paying attention as in the second or third episode the Dr. takes Rose 5 Billion years into the future to the end of the Earth. This episode is primarily featured in space and from Earth.<br /><br />When I first discovered that Russell T. Davies was bringing back the show, I became very excited as I was very curious as to what Russell would bring to the table. At the beginning when the cast was announced, I became sceptical for the first time, Christopher Eccleston as the Doc and Billie Piper of all people as his companion Rose Tyler. These two are a prime example of never judge before you see it for yourself as they both gave excellent acting performances throughout the series. I said earlier that the old series were quite pompous, this was due to the fact that the characters who played the doctor in the past were people with very middle class voices and attitudes and simply it wouldn't fit with todays young audience. This, to some may be a bad thing but to me it's an even better way to re-invent the whole character of Dr Who and show a new side to him that we have never seen before.<br /><br />The relationship between the Dr. & Rose developes into an unrequited love relationship, Rose grows to care for the Dr. more and more through the series to a point where you believe she starts to love him and the Dr. grows into the father figure that Rose never had and gains a responsibility for her to the point where he would risk his life for her. Throughout the series we are introduced to individual characters and taught to appreciate them in the same way as we appreciate the Dr. & Rose. Mickey & Captain Jack are the two more complex side characters in the series, Mickey fighting for the heart of Rose once again as the is drawn ever closer to the Dr. and Captain Jack the feisty heroic American who is featured in only a few episodes and was first introduced to us when the Dr. and Rose took a trip to War Time Britain.<br /><br />A very good reinvention to the series and something that will be a benchmark in history as something that not only changed the Dr. Who image, but something that changed the entire face of Sci-Fi Drama.s in the series, Mickey fighting for the heart of Rose once again as the is drawn ever closer to the Dr. and Captain Jack the feisty heroic American who is featured in only a few episodes and was first introduced to us when the Dr. and Rose took a trip to War Time Britain.

Also, it is not organized in a way that brings its point home as hard as it might.  The editor seems to have let a lot slip by.<br /><br />Worth reading nonetheless.

B00111L0MY|5.0|I had only seen isolated snippets of this film's previews, but was intrigued. I love Morgan Freeman, and was glad to see him in a solid role to showcase the subtleties in his acting capabilities. Casey Affleck plays a real guy, who is not afraid to get his hands dirty, very refreshing in comparison to the \\"souped up\\", and glitzy characters we usually see in action flicks of similar themes. Loved it start to finish-atmospheric, tense and gritty!
B000LC55F2|5.0|This movie was captivating and enthralling.  One of the best movies I have watched in a very long time.  Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale both have stellar performances throughout this movie...with a twist at the end that will leave everyone stunned!
0452287588|4.0|Oprah sure knows how to pick them!  With \\"A New Earth\\", the Princess of Popularity has alerted the public to a thoroughly fascinating book about the coming enlightenment of humanity.  Despite its flaws, Tolle's book is a great read that deserves the attention it's getting.  The result is an thoughtful intertwining of Buddhism and Christianity in the hopes of spurring on this enlightenment, which promises to unite the species and make everything very flowery.<br /><br />Aside from minor flaws like Tolle's imprecision with regard to physics (gravity isn't \\"non-existent\\" in water, it's just countered by other buoyant forces) and his stretched connections (Jesus' poor in spirit that will inherit the Earth are those who don't identify with their mind?), the author presents some real gems.  He shows how all ancient religions were pointing to the same thing: enlightenment and that \\"the truth, in any case, needs no defense\\".  He also shows how seeking happiness will never result in it and how most strife and turmoil in society today results from the core problem with identity.<br /><br />That, in fact, is the core subject of \\"A New Earth\\": how we identify ourselves based on material things as well as our thought and how we should alter that conception to be based on being.  This Buddhism lite is interesting, but certainly leaves room for more discussion.  Tolle's explanation of how to attain peace of mind may appear to some to be reminiscent of a rich man telling a poor man that money isn't everything, but his lessons are valid if the reader can open their mind to unique concepts.  Once we achieve that, perhaps we can start picking books like Oprah!
B0012QE4QC|3.0|For a soap opera, THE OTHER BOLEYN GIRL is reasonably diverting.  I enjoyed myself while watching it and it even made me go to the internet when I got home to look up the \\"real\\" story behind Anne Boleyn, Catherine of Aragon and many of the other historical characters presented in the fictionalized world of the film.    The movie succeeds primarily due to three nice performances. Erin Bana, as Henry VIII, is a different Henry than I've seen before.  He's younger and certainly handsome enough.  He's a more modern king...not just some fat, turkey-leg munching pig.  He's plenty manly, and seems to primarily be a reasonable guy...except when it comes to his roving eye.  Scarlett Johannsen is the shy sister Mary, who doesn't seek the limelight, but catches Henry's attention and falls in love with him.    Natalie Portman, in one of her livelier performances, is Anne Boleyn, the sister who dreams of climbing the social ladder, and seduces the king by sheer force of will and psychological manipulation.  Her role is certainly the juiciest one in the film and she handles it quite well.  We see her ambition and we see her at the height of success and at the absolute lowest of states.  We grow for a time to loathe her and then to embrace her again.    The movie basically tells a story of how these two sisters manipulate and are manipulated as they jockey for position in the king's court...or try to stay out of it altogether.  We see each of them achieve a grand height and a remarkable low.  Because it's set in a historical time period, it has that sheen of respectability that all period pieces seem to achieve.  Yet at its heart, it is a soap opera...one that is actually fairly predictable.  Most of the minor characters in the film are merely caricatures, and most are not very likeable.  Kirsten Scott Thomas shows some strength as the Boleyn mother...but mostly I yearned for someone to give this gifted actress a great, big part again.  It's been too long.    The script is also abit scattershot.  It assumes we understand just a bit too much about the real history.  (For example, when Henry's first wife, Catherine, is put on trial, it would certainly have helped to know the historical circumstances that led her to be Henry's wife in the first place.)  Yet it is also trite all to frequently.  When Henry first seduces Mary, their dialogue is merely generic flattery.  Mary is supposed to fall for Henry during this scene...but the movie fails to make us \\"fall\\" for Henry at that time.  It's tough to make a person like Henry VIII likeable, because we've all got pretty hard and fast ideas about the kind of person he was.  If the movie had made his likeability easier to see and then made his torment a bit more approachable...the movie would have gone from generic to something truly special.    I don't want to take away from Portman's performance in particular.  The movie is entertaining enough and Portman good enough to make it worth seeing.  But it seldom rises to the level it aspires too.
B000AP04FG|5.0|This is a great premise, explored with humor and action.  Anyone who is married has gone through ups and downs in their relationship - and everyone knows marriage can be dull at times.  Angelina and Brad get far more spice than they bargain for when it's revealed that they're both assassins hired to kill each other.<br /><br />The dialogue is reminiscent of the old school detective movies, quick and layered with double meanings.  Both leads are sleek, with sexiness oozing from their pores (as if anyone doesn't know this).  Their house (the primary set) is full of \\"Jetson\\" type gadgets and enough weapons to wage a war, yet remained comfortable and tasteful (a humorous combination).<br /><br />I was impressed with the stunts and car chases; however the shoot outs got to be a bit much at times.  The knock down, drag out fight between the leads is comic brilliance - they really don't hold back and the result is well, as you can imagine, better than make up sex.<br /><br />Vince Vaughn is memorable as an assassin living with his mother.  He delivers his one liners with comic ease and leaves the rest of the cast members in his wake.<br /><br />I'm sure if I wanted to probe, I'd find a few plot holes, but who would want to go and ruin such a perfect cheese.  Not me, I'll take mine with a glass of wine - this movie is a keeper.  I'll be watching it on many anniversaries to come.
0307237702|2.0|I am not a Republican. I am not a Democrat. I am in the middle -- not the \\"middle\\" commonly known as centrist, walking the line between Democrat and Replubican on the continuum of the political spectrum; rather, I am between both ideologies, seeing the strengths and weaknesses of both.    I bought the audio CD of Senator Obama's book, The Audacity of Hope, because I figure he's going to be our next President (I mean, McCain? Who are we kidding?) so I might as well see what he has to say.    Listening to books on CD is my favorite thing to do while driving. Each year, I listen to dozens of books this way. I approach each one with eagerness, a desire to learn, and the assurance that I'll be entertained for miles on the road.    I approached Senator Obama's audio book this same way: eagerly, with an open mind.    The introduction was compelling. I thought, \\"This guy is obviously intelligent. And he's remarkably eloquent.\\" I was beginning to think he offered something fresh to the political arena.    By the time I got to chapter one, however, I knew my hope had been a false one. Barack Obama, for all his eloquence, charisma, and intelligence, offers nothing new politically. It's the same old polarizing stuff I've heard for years.     For example:    1. Obama spoke of wanting to forge a new political path to help bring people together. Yet, it wasn't more than a few minutes into chapter one when he resorted to Bush-hating, anti-Republican, anti-Conservative rhetoric for which Democrats have become known. How does that bring anyone together?     His slams were often subtle, sometimes blatant. But they were obvious. Conservative Republicans = big business, cold hearts, a stifling, anti-liberty machine that crushes all opposition.    Democrats, on the other hand, = the downtrodden, the party for the people, the pro-personal liberty, pro-tolerance, pro-common sense party the country needs but hasn't had because of the Big Bad Republicans.      He occasionally tossed in an aside comment like, \\"I know I'm ignoring some important threads in the issues, but...\\" and then he'd continue painting with his broad-stroke brush.    2. Obama spoke of eschewing the \\"victim\\" mentality inherent in most of modern-day liberal Democrat rhetoric. Yet, he quickly succumbed to the very thinking he denounced as early as chapter one when he explained that Democrats were angry, frustrated, and becoming increasingly nasty in political realms because of the Republicans. Does anyone see the hypocrisy in that? He denounces the victim mentality on one hand, while using it to explain the behavior of Democrats on the other.    3. Obama never failed to read from the Democrat playbook when he spoke of the big money behind the Republicans -- as if Republicans are funded by ruthless, but deep-pocketed corporation owners bent on destroying America...while Democrats walk around with hat in hand begging for money to continue their campaign to save America. It's all rubbish. If Obama truly desired to be a unifying force in modern-day politics, why does he keep using false, inflammatory, polarizing words? The truth is, there are just as many multi-millionare Democrats as there are Republicans. John Edwards, for instance. How big is his home -- nearly 30,000 square feet? Ditto for Al Gore? And John Kerry. How many thousands of dollars do they spend each month for electricity and gas to heat their mansions? And what about ultra, ultra, ULTRA left-wing billionaire George Soros who makes it a point to fund liberal Democrats as often as possible? His pockets are endlessly deep. Yet, Democrats are wont to fault Republicans as feeding off the corporate teat. Why? To divide. To inflame. To polarize. All the very things Obama says he wants to avoid.    4. Obama spoke of Democrats having to constantly reach across the aisle to compromise with Republicans who have held absolute power, thereby watering down the Democrat message little by little over the years. Yet, when Republicans do the same thing -- as McCain, for example, constantly prides himself on doing -- why isn't that considered a bad thing for Republicans? In other words, why does Democrat compromise with Republicans equal watered-down Democrat legislation and ideology...but Republican compromise with Democrats equals a good thing for America? How is that possible? Only if Democrats do what they accuse Republicans of doing -- thinking their way is best for America.    5. Obama spoke of Democrats in Congress living in the shadow of Republicans, getting nothing done legislatively because they lacked the power -- because of Bush-controlled Republican ideology -- to make things happen. Yet, what have Democrats -- who now control Congress -- done since they assumed control? Nothing. Every campaign promise -- including the Biggie: Withdrawing from Iraq -- has been broken. Congress in the last year or so has earned its lowest public approval ratings of all time. And yet   Democrats are in power. How is that possible? Following Obama's line of reasoning, America should now be a utopia: prosperous, unified, and la-la-la-ing all the way to the bank. Why hasn't that happened?    6. Obama spoke of Ronald Reagan in terms that can only be described as critical, yet he praised Bill Clinton for bringing the country together, getting things done. Say what? Clinton was one of the most corrupt and ineffective politicians to come down the pike in many decades. The only thing he managed to do was Monica Lewinsky. And a great example of his effectiveness as a leader was passing on the chance to take out Osama Bin Laden long before 9/11. Add, correct me if I'm wrong, wasn't he the only sitting President to be impeached? I'd never in a million years hold up Bill Clinton as a shining example of anything, political or moral.    I could go on and on. The bottom line is this: If you buy this book (or audio book) looking for a different kind of Democrat, one who doesn't polarize, resort to clever -- but damaging --double-speak, and who truly seeks to unite rather than divide, you'll have to look elsewhere. Barack Obama is, above all else, a Democrat who dislikes, distrusts, and disdains conservative Republicans and their ideologies. Worse, he's the kind of Democrat who myopically points the finger of blame at others while resorting to the same behavior himself. That means he's either a hypocrite, a shrewd manipulator, or stupid. And he's obviously not stupid.
B0013D8LOU|5.0|I saw the original production of Sweeney Todd - well the first national company (the production that was filmed at the end the LA run at the Dorothy Chandler Pavillion with Angela Lansbury and George Hearn) and fell in love with the grissly show.  It had style and flair and could not wait until the right director came along and filmed it.    Ten years ago when I heard that Tim Burton was interested in doing a movie of it, I knew he was the only director that could pull it off.  When Johnny Depp was announced as the lead, I first thought he was too young but then realized he was probably the correct age for the role.  Then I heard about the trimming of the show.  But I decided to wait and see the results.    The final verdict is this film was one of the best films of 2007.  Tim Burton did a masterful job of directing this difficult film.  While I did not agree with all the cuts, the only real complaint I had is the cut of the Prologue - The Ballad of Sweeney Todd.  This could have been put over the opening credits.  But this is a minor quibble. (By the way Burton should have won the Oscar for Direction)    Johnny Depp proved that he was up to the role of the Demon Barber.  He took the role and ran with it.  He created a three dimensional character who you sympathize with even though he does terrible things.  (Depp also should have won the Oscar for this performance.)    The only problem in casting was Helena Bonham Carter, she either hit musical sequences perfectly (A Little Priest) or totally missed it (The Worst Pies in London).  She is a great actress but just did not have the musical background for the role.  Mrs. Lovett is one of the most difficult roles in musical theatre.  She is a real monster.  She doesn't have the sympathetic backstory that Benjamin Barker has and it takes a very skilled actress (like Tony winner Angela Lansbury) to pull it off and Carter just came up short.    In the supporting roles, Timothy Spall was perfectly sleazy as Beedle Bamford, Alan Rickman was incredibly slimey as Judge Turpin and newcomer Ed Sanders was beautifly naive as the innocent helper Toby.  Sasha Baron Cohen has a too brief but crucial appearance as Signor Perelli, a former protoge of Barker and Todd's first vicitim.  Laura Michelle Kelly portrays the Beggar woman - in a role drastically cut down from the stage version.  Jamie Campbell Bower and Jayne Wisener portray the star crossed lovers Anthony and Joanna.    And for those that want to better understand film making technique, this is a film that is technically flawless.  This is a film in which the most important element is the lack of color, from the production design and costumes to the cinematography.  The choice of the exclusion of color created the bleak period that it takes place.    While I would have liked a more complete version, this is a great bare bones production. For those that want a more complete production, the Angela Lansbury - George Hearn TV production filmed at the Dorothy Chandler Pavillion is available.    Once again, if you want to see a great musical, a grizzly comedy or have a bloody good time, this is the film!!!!

B000O75F7C|5.0|Fear of a Blank Planet is an well balanced album, containing a little bit of everything from PT's arsenal. The title track is a great combination of progressive rock and Wilson vocals, and contains powerful lyrics concerning this generations dependence on computers, video games, and drugs to substitue a social lifestyle. \\"My Ashes\\" is another great song, consisting of an acoustic feel, and a great string arangment. \\"Anesthetize\\" is my favorite PT song of all time, mainly because the 17 minutes of the track contains everything great about PT, eerie guitar, progressive metal, amazing vocals, and a mellow ending. \\"Sentimental\\" is very well done but is hard to understand unless you pick up \\"normal\\" from the sister ep Nil. \\"Way out of Here\\" is intense and melodic. \\"Sleep Together\\" is very eerie and concludes the album with a crazy awesome sting jam.

B0000640VO|3.0|It is not that I don't like 'Amelie' and don't appreciate its charm and whimsy - I am yet to see the streets of Montmartre, Paris as magic as in the movie, and I've been to Paris and found it the most beautiful place in the world. It is that I don't find it fabulous, amazing, and original enough to grant its status of one of the greatest movies ever made according the multiple top lists. One of the IMDB reviewers described \\"Amelie\\" the best: \\"sweet, sweet, sweet\\" - and that triple sweetness was a bit too much for my taste, I guess. I found it amusing and very good looking but the story of a naive shy young girl who found her destiny in making people around her happy by helping them find love and while doing so, finding her own love, as sweet as it sounds, left me indifferent. To sum up, for me, \\"Amelie\\" is a pleasant little movie but not a timeless masterpiece which would stay in my memory for long time.

B00139XZF4|1.0|The movie abruptly ends and completely ignores the final and most important chapter from the original book. The last chapter is what makes you read the next book.

B0010X8NF0|3.0|`The Darjeeling Limited,' should be evaluated by how much mirth and wisdom it provides.  The film comes across like a train wreck, giving us a fresh take on the familiar culture clash between East and West.  While watching this film, I kept thinking of The Beatles and their films.  One reason is that the three brothers presented run (madcap) through the titled Indian train; the other is that they journey through the heart of India searching for wisdom.      At the start of the movie Jack (Jason Schwartzman) is in France.  He is a successful novelist renting a Paris hotel room for weeks on end.  His lover calls, saying she has found him and asks him if she can arrive within a half hour.  He says alright, but when she does arrive, it is established that he is there to get away from her.  Even so, they feel so passionate about each other, they find it hard to part ways.  He had to flee to Paris, but he doesn't resist her advances.    In the next frame of the movie, Jack catches up to his brothers, Francis (Owen Wilson) and Peter (Adrien Brody).  All agree to an enlightening adventure to get away from it all, while their parents have been in India for some time.  It is quickly established that their father passed away there, and their mother has entered a convent and become a nun.  Francis is the eldest, and although he is the most vocal about letting go and absorbing the lessons they can gain from the East, he is also the most grasping and controlling of the other two.      He sets their purpose with three agreements:  A.) Seek the unknown B.) with an open mind..., and C.) even if it`s shocking and painful.  Funny, but without knowing it, we learn without preaching that all of them have brought plenty of baggage (literally as well as figuratively) along their journey.      In one telling scene, they are running for the Darjeeling Limited, and they all make it aboard while another man (Bill Murray) is left behind.  Later on, because of mishaps that shouldn't be mentioned, they catch up to another train, and we find this character is on the same train.  Just be still and don't run for trains, I can hear Wes Anderson, showing us in many frames.  You'll catch another one.  The journey within is supreme.  \\"Arrive without traveling,\\" as George Harrison wrote and sang for The Beatles' \\"The Inner Light\\".  There is a more substantial development that occurs, but I'll leave you to unearth that for yourselves.    `The Darjeeling Limited' is more than a travel adventure.  While I don't think mirth and wisdom were necessarily brought in aces, they certainly were highly present.  Being a person who loves a visual feast, I couldn't help but be partial to Anderson's shifting 90-degree angle camera changes and how he captures the color and light.  Besides the yellow lettering framing a vivid blue train, we have nearly neon colors contrasting with bright saris and white turbans.  All in all, the film is not entirely a substantial journey, but an arresting one at that.
B00005JKC3|2.0|It is unfortunate, but Hulk is so far my least favorite of all the comic book movies that have been created.  One would think the Hulk could easily make the list as one of the better comic films, being the popular and dominating comic book creation he is, but director Ang Lee and a lackluster story keep this movie from being incredible, though effects still keep it somewhat enjoyable.<br /><br />I'll be honest, it took a few seperated viewings for me to get through this film, as it is so slow and boring throughout.  There is too much dialouge (and uninteresting speeches) to occupy a film featuring such a massive creature as the Hulk.  Eric Bana, though a wonderful actor, does little with his character of Bruce Banner, making it difficult to understand the true emotions within this man.  When he turns into the Hulk, its really the only part that becomes exciting (and very well should), but at that point we have a CGI creature that doesn't talk, just runs around and wrecks everything (which admittadly, is fun to watch as the visuals effects let loose and show off).  Betty Ross is handled fairly well by Jennifer Connely, but the relation between Bruce and Betty isn't nearly as emotional or exciting as it could be.  Again, most of the interaction was slow and boring, and though I could feel there were some emotional struggles between the two characters, I felt like I had to think about it too much to realise it.  The rest of the cast wasn't anything special either, and overall, acting on everyone's part was below par as far as comic book movies go.<br /><br />The directing is my next issue.  I give credit to Ang Lee for his comic book style of split-screens, picture in picture and so forth.  But the truth is the multiple angles for many of these scenes grow tiresome and distracting from the real action.  Fortunately during the Hulk action scenes in the film, little of this style is used, or esle it would have been impossible to enjoy.<br /><br />So where is the excitment in this film?  It is when Bruce becomes the Hulk.  The creature is massive and an impressive CGI, but to be picky, the closeups of Hulk make him look too smooth and not as rugged and detailed as he could be.  He destroys practically everything he comes incontact with, and can toss military tanks with ease - a truly enjoyable sight to watch.  Also enjoyable are the scenes when Hulk is jumping among the mountains throughout canyons, but at some point you stop and ask yourself \\"is he jumping or flying\\".  It becomes a little overdone, but nevertheless, if you have a big screen television it is a sight to enjoy.<br /><br />Overall, this movie is just bad.  I find it very hard to sit through the entire 2 hour 18 minute run.  The 15-20 minutes of non-stop action about 1:30 in the film is all that will keep you awake.  Hulk could have been an impressive film, but so much went wrong as mentioned above.  Thankfully, this summer of '08, a new Hulk film will be released and chances are the same mistakes will not be repeated, thanks to an entirely new crew and cast.  Watch this first Hulk film while you can (if you dare) because chances are it is about to become forgotten for good.<br /><br />Acting - 2.5<br />Action - 4<br />Characters - 1.5<br />Story - 1.5<br />Overall - 2hen Bruce becomes the Hulk.

B0011FXLCC|5.0|Like many of the other reviewers here, I have been a devoted fan of Goldfrapp for several years now.  I can still recall the day I was browsing through a local Borders store and was fortunate enough to be there when one of the salesmen decided to play their infectious song \\"Train\\" over the loudspeakers.  I was hooked immediately upon first listen, and just had to find out who was the creator of such fabulous music.  The year was 2003, when their fantastic second album \\"Black Cherry\\" had just been released.  The ironic thing was, I had previously heard of the duo via an article I had come across in an indie magazine; even reading the description of their work then, I had been intrigued.  Long story short: I wound up exiting Borders with a copy of that album, and loved it so much that I knew I would have to possess everything that they had ever (or WILL ever) record.  It wasn't long before I snatched up \\"Felt Mountain\\" soon afterwards, and anxiously awaited \\"Supernature\\" many months before its arrival.  So, imagine my enthusiasm when I discovered just by sheer dumb luck a few weeks ago that \\"Seventh Tree\\",  the newest masterpiece by this amazingly talented British pair would be out soon to grace my rather large music collection!!  I had also read a short time ago that \\"Tree\\" would be a departure of sorts, more of a foray into softer, dreamier, 60's psychedelic-infused pop: this news didn't faze me in the slightest, as I have been a fan of that genre for many years (and knew that if anyone could breathe colorful life/inventiveness from such influences, Goldfrapp would do just that).  I know we are technically 3 months into 2008, but let me just say that thus far, this is the BEST new release I have heard by this band or any other this year!!  While I do love the deluxe edition of the album (with very cool postcards, a big foldout poster, artsy little lyric booklet, and DVD), the real thrill for me was putting the CD into my player, donning headphones, pushing \\"play\\"....and oh, was I off on glorious musical journey!!  The opening track \\"Clowns\\" pulled me into it right away, followed by one of my personal favorite songs, Little Bird\\".  Swirly, hypnotic, euphoric-it's a tune I could play over and over and just never get tired of listening to.  Other standout greats are the sensual \\"Road To Somewhere\\", the somewhat melancholy but lovely \\"Some People\\", breathily seductive \\"Cologne, Cerrone, Houdini\\"; \\"Caravan Girl\\" is vibrant, colorful, joyously uptempo and  rocks out so much so that it makes me want to just bounce all over the place. \\"Monster Love\\" is hazy, trippy, atmospheric~ almost reminiscent of the sound the Beatles had in their \\"Sgt. Pepper\\"/\\"Magic Mystery Tour\\" days. I for one am glad that Alison and Will are always evolving as artists; in a world of so many generic \\"cookie cutter\\" bands (as I so fondly like to refer to them), I truly admire any musicians who aren't afraid to experiment with a variety of sounds/styles/influences in order to keep their craft fresh, exciting. Goldfrapp has shown that they are capable of huge diversity in how they want to present themselves, rather than be pigeon-holed in any particular genre.  Alison has such a beautiful voice that is the embodiment of candid sexuality, passion, emotion, and thoughtful insight: she definitely has a gift for conveying many feelings/states of mind, and atmospheres through her impressive vocal range. Will is the perfect partner in crime, adding lush and all encompassing electronic soundscapes to their shared compositions.  \\"Seventh Tree\\" is a stunning, gorgeous,and emotionally theatrical collection of music by two incredible musicians who constantly outdo themselves....and as much as I LOVE it, it boggles the mind to think what they may come up with next time around.  Knowing Goldfrapp and their incredible track record, it's bound to be nothing short of absolutely, positively brilliant!!  :-).and oh, was I off on glorious musical journey!!

B000002ADT|5.0|I promised the man I sent this to as a gift that I would change his life. He kind of laughed it off because \\"...I don't know if Amazon has anything that can change my life.\\"    I asked him to listen to track three, at night, with a  glass of really good wine (An Argentine Malbec)- and drift.    He did. Life is changed.    Thank you.
B000PFU7OO|5.0|This movie was recommended by one of my closest friends as a \\"must see.\\"  I watched it and immediately came down to my computer and purchased the soundtrack.  Amazing, moving, raw, real, heartfelt, romantic.  Many more words could be used to describe this movie and soundtrack but for timesake, we'll just say, outstanding.  Couldn't be more pleased!
B00009R86L|5.0|I have several of these and use them on all my bags. They are easy to attach to any shoulder strap and the weight distribution and comfort is beyond anything I've experienced from other bags. The image shown here isn't accurate - this shoulder pad has a thick foam padding under that is angled so it rests comfortably on your shoulder whether you have the bag on your shoulder or across your body (messenger bag style) - it's easy to remove to use on other bags and is seriously comfortable! I use this on the Domke F2 but also on Crumpler bags which I find very uncomfortable with the pad that comes with the bag. I also have one for my Freitag messenger bag that I use for school. I bought my Domke shoulder pads from bhphoto - they have a more accurate description and photo, but the price is the same.
0066620996|5.0|What a great book! Although I own a small recording studio and graphic design business, there was so much in this book that I can apply to these endeavors, just like the big corporations that \\"made the cut.\\" The first chapter may be a tough go but everything discussed is later covered in detail. In retrospect, I recommend starting on the last page of chapter 1 and then going to the end of the book. After that, read chapter one and it will all come together. \\"Good to Great\\" is yet another step up towards the success of our businesses!
B000PFU7OO|5.0|I saw the movie Once and before it was half finished I was already downloading the soundtrack. This music is really different than what I usually listen to (various mixes but mostly middle eastern, north african and mali music) but I adore this CD! I am also in love with the track \\"Gold\\" from Interference. If you see the movie the soundtrack is just that much better because you can relate to the songs and lyrics but it's not a prerequisite! My friends love the soundtrack and they have yet to see the movie. Definitely worth the price (on my playlist I moved Broken Hearted Hoover Fixer Sucker Guy to the end of the list as I find it breaks up the mood having it as #3)
B000059QYB|1.0|Very dissapointed as I have not received my shipment. Nor am I able to track it on this website as it does not tell me with which company the CD was shipped.    So the fact that I have not recieved this shipment means I can's comment on teh product
B000X418UE|5.0|This is a great HD Disc.  I just love the audio on this disc.  It really makes my Home Theater System shine.
006135323X|5.0|This was an insightful fun read. I bought it one day, started reading it, and ended up finishing it the same day. I usually don't finish books that fast, especially not when the weather is nice (and it was that day) but this was just too hard to put down. This is like reading a fact based adventure based on human behavior. For me, it was also a great example of how to write about academic work in a way that will grab and keep the attention of any audience.<br /><br />A truly outstanding book!<br /><br />Bravo Dan!
B00104W8T6|5.0|the mix of new folk and classic standards is great.  and the way the songs are in order as they appear in the film rocks!
B000OVLBIU|5.0|This movie looked absolutely amazing on my 60\\" Sony DLP tv!  You gotta have this one in blu-ray, the colors are great.  Yeah, I like the story as well, not gonna win any oscars, but a good story just the same.  In contrast, I would say the plot of Ghost Rider is very superior to the coincedence-laden plot of Spiderman III.  But the cinematoghraphy is superb, and you can really see it on blu ray.  Hope this helps!
B000VWE5OY|5.0|Generally I'm disappointed when I receive a DVD set because they may have 7 minutes of deleted scenes or commentaries by people I could care less about and that's it for extras.  Not so with Torchwood!  There are a TON of extras, some of which I haven't even gotten to watch yet.  There are deleted scenes, some commentaries with the actors and actresses, all of the Torchwood Declassified episodes that the US viewers miss out on as well as the uncut UK versions of each episode.  Part of the fun of watching these DVDs for me are the \\"hey, that wasn't on the BBC America version!\\" moments I have with every episode.  I HIGHLY recommend this DVD set if you love Torchwood!
B000PFU7OO|5.0|I am in love with the movie \\"Once\\" and with the soundtrack. I already owned the DVD, and was finding it impractical to have to play the DVD in order to hear the music.  My transaction with Amazon went perfectly, as always.
B000AOJ9X0|5.0|I've listened to quite a few blues players and Buddy Guy is the most energetic and uptempo player I've ever had the pleasure of listening to.  This cd ROCKS! Plain and simple.  In particular: Cut You Loose, What Kind of Woman, Now You're Gone, Cheaper To Keep Her, and Somebody's Sleeping In My Bed are all above average tracks and will have you playing this album for years to come.  A must own for any Blues/Rock fan.  Kudos to Buddy Guy for cutting such a rocking album!
B000V7B90C|5.0|As a huge Bon Scott fan I just love this DVD!!!<br />Put together extremely well it shows live footage, interviews and a scrapbook! Sadly at the end of the scrapbook you see the anouncement of<br />Bon's Death! Bon was it when I was growing up in the seventies!<br />The ultimate Frontman in my book! The DVD continues with Brian whom I have a lot of Respect for. This DVD is a must have for any AC/DC Fan!!!
B0000VCZK2|5.0|I love the box set.  With all the options such as deleted seanes it is like watching a whole new show.
B0012K1ILW|5.0|I love this album; there'e everything on it; soul, funk, R&B; I love every single track, and Erykah Badu does her best here; it may require some listening to be appreciated, but it's wonderful, and surely worth buying.
1881273156|4.0|This book helps understand the love language of your spouse.  It helps each spouse to identify the things he/she can do to better their marriage, by speaking the love language most desired by their spouse.  Very hepful book.
B0010X73ZG|5.0|For those Stephen King fans, especially those who read the short story \\"The Mist,\\" will find the screen adaption accurate, all the way up to the end-Frank Durabont the director decided this story needed an end-this story is another Roller-Coaster Ride into Hell and Back, but the ending------I give it 99% excellent-1% Mist (Missed)Up!
B000002GQH|5.0|I will not be wordy.  I listened to the original vinyl album dozens of times one afternoon just to capture the lyrics.  Our entire wedding service was taken from the lyrics of various Moody Blues songs from this album .......... to this day, # 1 my Mom is still looking for the passage in the Bible, and #2 our friends who know \\" MB \\" are amazed that we could pull it off ......... and #3 we are still looking for opportunities to see Moody Blues 36+ yrs after the ceremony !  The CD is my mental 'walk back' to those days of the '69-71 years when everything was possible.   Jan. 2015:  This is just a post script to my 2008 review:  Christmas '13 my husband got us tickets to the Moody Blues concert in Richmond, VA in spring '14.  I'm convinced that the others in the room that morning were totally confused when I just started crying.  To say that the music of that group fills my heart is an understatement.  And they were awesome in person.
B000ASDFJU|1.0|Great series but the packaging is sub-standard and many of the DVDs are scratched and scuffed, even when the product is bought new.  The DVDs are housed in cardboard sleeves and it is very apparent that this is causing the scuffing and damage.  Just as many others have complain, my entire season 3 is damaged to the point that it won't play on any DVD player.  HBO should be ashamed of themselves and should provide replacements for the damaged discs.  However, I have not had any success in getting a replacement.    I would highly recommend avoiding this product, especially when you can purchase the seasons individually at a lower overall price.  If you do buy it, remove all discs as soon as you receive them and place them in a \\"real\\" CD case with padded sleeves to prevent further damage.
B000022TSH|5.0|I saw Chinatown when it first came out in theaters and liked it a lot.  But I have to say that I enjoyed it even more now.  There is so much to see and appreciate.  First of all, the script is amazing--so much better than the usual gumshoe flicks.  Then there is the perfect cast:  Nicholson is at the top of his game as the crass but great hearted P.I. Dunaway is beautiful and appropriately mysterious, strange,  and vulnerable, John Houston will give you the heebie geebies for a week with his charming presence that hides dreadful secrets.  The direction is masterful.  LA looks beautiful in the sun drenched light.     So many films that were lauded at the time don't hold up over the years, but this one really does.  I highly recommend it.
B000K4WLXA|5.0|This collector's edition is well worth the money.  I played Final Fantasy VII and this movie presents a interesting story about what happened several years after the game. The plot is interesting and the computer generated details are exquisite.  The extras are nice as well.  There are 10 postcards , the script in English, and a short novel.  The novel acts as a bridge between the game and the movie; it has short stories about Barret, Denzel, Tifa, and Cloud.  These short stories are OK, but they only really cover the people I mentioned.  The extras on the DVD are nice, they include scenes from Final Fantasy VII, interviews with the people who created Advent Children, and the anime Last Order.  I would recommend this set if you really enjoyed Final Fantasy VII.
0596007124|4.0|This is great book very easy to understand, besides, it's only suitable for starters because it just have a small collection of the most common patterns.  Once you had read it, you'll have to research other sources of information, for deep knowledge and for more patterns.
1881273156|5.0|This book gets to the source of how to make your marriage work. It's about how each of us have differences on feeling loved; our love language. It's a fast read and has a common sense approach to it which is very refreshing. How one person feels or gives love is not how another does it. If one is giving the wrong love language to one's spouse, that spouse won't feel loved. To connect with each other we need to learn how to speak your spouse's love language. A very eye opening read that every married & engaged couple should read. If you want to keep the spark alive or rekindle it, this is the book to read!
B000WC3A0S|4.0|I don't usually watch movies that have even a little bit to do with sports of any kind...but these movies have far more to offer than just one senseless fight after another.  I will admit, however, that the 5th movie could easily be left out without diminishing the overall story at all.  If you are interested in special features you will be, as another reviewer mentioned, disappointed.  If, however, you are only interested in the movies, this set should satisfy.
B00005JLT5|5.0|This movie is moving, inspiring, educational and truly amazing!! I have recommended it to all my friends and family!
B000YABYLA|3.0|What an explosion this little film has made at the box office; pulling in a staggering 100+ million bucks! Before it spread to its wide release and wide popularity, I saw 'Juno' at an indie theater during its limited run. From the moment the end credits began to roll, I knew that this film would be successful.  Though there is a tremendous amount of hype to this film, it truely meets if not exceeds all your expectations. I know many people are quick to judge Miss Page and her preformance (I mean is it really a stretch that she plays a smart mouthed tween?- probably not). Yet, she does give enough likable charm to sustain the running time of the film. Micheal Cera also has a charming role though, again, not much of a stretch from his George Michael character from 'Arrested Development', or even his Evan character from 'Superbad'. The rest of the cast is good, nothing extrodinary. The music is perfect; quirky, poppy, and cool. The writing is witty and smart. What could have easily turned out to be a lifetime original movie, is a surprising, heat warming, and funny little film that's really good.
B00007KWHP|5.0|If The Yes Album didn't turn them into progressive rock gods, then Fragile certainly did. Released in the U.K. at the end of 1971, this is one of prog rock's great statements of purpose, a collection of labyrinthine, otherworldly tunes, full of gut-wrenching dynamics, impressionistic lyrics, and virtuoso musicianship. And I mean virtu-freaking-oso: All five of these Yes-men are very, very good at what they do. On guitar, Steve Howe is an absolute sorcerer, capable of combining every single thing that's ever been done to a stringed instrument, yanking pages from the books of rock, classical, and jazz with gleeful (but technically impeccable, of course) abandon. Chris Squire, meanwhile, is that rarest of things: A bassist with a unique, recognizable, and mind-bogglingly great playing style. He doesn't play second fiddle (or first bass) to the rest of the band, shooting strings of pulverizing rhythmic ferocity right through the center of the band's wall of sound. Same goes for drummer Bill Bruford, who simply refuses to let the energy of these songs let up (unless they're going into hypnotic mode, at which point energy is a bad thing). Jon Anderson sings like it's nobody's business, lending an epic, poetic feel to the lyrics, even when their meaning is cloudy at best. And then, of course, there's newcomer Rick Wakeman, who can construct entire universes of sound using his endless supply of keyboards. Together, they would rule the world. Or the charts. Whatever.    Anyway, Fragile is something of a unique entry in the Yes discography, in that five of its tracks are actually solo pieces, one from each member of the band. The others are group compositions. Cute, 'eh? Let's talk about the group cuts first. Specifically, let's talk about \\"Roundabout.\\" Now, I know (if I may digress for a second) that some people out there see prog as being boring, dated, overblown, indulgent, and pretentious. These people are wrong. Well, they're wrong about half of the time, anyway. But they're certainly wrong about Yes, and they're especially wrong about \\"Roundabout,\\" because for all its technical grace and structural complexity, this is an absolute beast of a rock song- it's a cataclysmic whirlwind of rampaging, funky rhythms (listen to that bass line! My goodness!), churning guitar chords, spitfire melodies, sonic hairpin turns, deranged harmonies, and Rick Wakeman. It's amazing, absolutely amazing. Never has ponytailed nerd (it's okay, I'm a huge nerd. No ponytail, though) sounded so incredibly cool! Your move, Fripp. And there's also \\"South Side Of The Sky,\\" which is an apocalyptic thunderstorm of guitar flurries and spooked vocals. \\"Long Distance Runaround,\\" the shortest of the group numbers, is a delectable slice of prog pop, and \\"Heart Of The Sunrise\\" is a hypnotic epic among hypnotic epics.     And the five solo pieces? Well, they're not really as good as the four group numbers, but they're still fun. I personally love Chris' \\"The Fish (Shindleria Praematurus),\\" which churns and groans and builds with hypnotic, funky power. There's also Jon's bewitching multitracked vocal excursion, \\"We Have Heaven,\\" and Steve's way cool Spanish guitar workout, \\"Mood For A Day.\\"     So, yeah, awesome stuff. Classic prog.
B00003CXCW|5.0|I'm really not sure why I'm writing a review of a true classic that thousands of others have taken on.I first saw this film circa 1961 (13 years old) and was totally fascinated by it (and probably always will be). However, there is definitely a disconnect point- no young teenager would be drawn towards it today; certainly none would be reading this review. So, I'm really just wasting time, unless one notices the effectiveness of the first person dialogue that really helps buoy the film. Or, perhaps, it's the here today, gone tomorrow ethic of the world, not only Hollywood, that really stands out, almost in biblical  proportions; something that Swanson was never  able to acknowledge. Holden, in my opinion gets a bad rap. He's trying to eke out a living using Swanson,just as Swanson  is trying to use DeMille, just as Max is using Swanson, albeit in polite ways. Recognizing his errors, Holden is on his way back to Dayton,just a couple of minutes too late to take the plunge. Anyway, no matter how good it is, it's only a movie. Right!?
B000ICL3KG|4.0|I would recommend this to anyone who doesn't know much or anything about Global Warming or someone who is interested in it (like myself). I recently bought this DVD pre-viewed at my local video store and would like to say this is a great movie (4 stars just because it gets boring after watching it about twice). I would just like to say that Al Gore is excellent, I think he's doing a really good thing for the world and this video must be viewed by anybody I listed in the first sentence. Rub this in the face of all those people that don't believe in Global Warming.  Overall: Worth the money, BUY THIS TODAY!!!... and Global Warming's real!!!!!!!!!!!    Post-script: I did not really review the movie in-depth because many people have already thoroughly broken down this film. It's about Global Warming and it's dangers, and is backed by much scientific evidence and research, and Al Gore thoroughly goes over pictures of depleted glaciers to prove the catastrophe is real. (in short)
0452289963|1.0|I had high hopes for this book. I had read great reviews. I made a special trip to buy the book and took it home to read it -- and was very disappointed that I couldn't understand much of it.    There is good stuff in there. The pages are sprinkled with references to Buddha, Jung, Sartre, Krishnamurti, et al, but here and there I had to go around sentences like \\"Any life-form in any realm--mineral, vegetable, animal or human--can be said to undergo 'enlightenment'\\". and just leave them behind like rock outcroppings in a plowed field.    Part of my trouble, I think, is that Mr. Tolle makes up his own meanings for words. I get stubborn and refuse to change my original understanding of a word.  Part of my problem may be that my expectation is that if I find \\"THE TRUTH\\" that it will be presented in a simple format, with a synopsis at the end of every chapter and an index and glossary at the end.
B000W0DE7O|5.0|If you are a fan of this band, you will be ecstatic, if you were not a fan, you will be after viewing this concert.  Worth watching over and over again.  The band is excellent, the vocals are right on, a truly enjoyable experience.
B000YIGNKE|2.0|I read this book prior to watching any adaptations.  This version gets it wrong in so many ways.  Pivitol scenes are split up or omitted completely.  Things made up.  The ending - rubish.  There is no way that Captain Wentworth could have given her what he did in the last scene.  He did a great job at being steamy and intent... but the whole production was disappointing.  If you want a better adaptation see the 1995 with Amanda Root and Ciarán Hinds.  It is much more faithful to the book and does not miss or mess about with the pivitol scenes.
0060899220|4.0|As a fan of the show and someone that worked the \\"front of the house\\" during my youth, I was interested in reading this for various reasons.<br />I enjoy the \\"No Reservations\\" but I can't say I love Anthony Bourdain. I like him enough and he is an enjoyable enough host, but sometimes I have to think; How did this guy get his own show? Anyway, the book is good and paints a very realistic picture of what it's like working in the restaurant business. As I said, I worked the front, waiting tables, room service etc. and had my run in with many cooks. Anthony gets it right; Cooks are an odd bunch and this a fascinating read. Try \\"Dishwasher\\" by Dishwasher Pete for a similar look from the dishpit.<br />Enjoy!
0385338724|5.0|I have read every Sophie Kinsella book thus far, and though I have at times been dissapointed (the latter Shopoholic books) I still can't help but purchase her new books. I didn't hesitate to buy this one as one of my first \\"pre release\\" books ever purchased, and I read it in one sitting while I was waiting for movers to come pack me up. So many times while I was reading it I had wished there was another one that I could pick up right after I was done. No, the ending isn't a surprise by any stretch of the imagination, but the ending is SOOOO worth getting to. This is I think my favorite book of Sophie Kinsella's. I wish Sophie were a robot who could pop out a book every week! They are junk food for your brain! Love it!
0307387178|4.0|Thankfully Chris left behind his journal and postcards, letters etc.  so that Krakauer was able to put this book together.  It really does feel that the author was able to paint a pretty good picture of what Chris was feeling.  Loved the book, but felt it could have been shorter.  I could have done without Krakauer's own stories, although I did enjoy the stories about other free spirits that disappeared or died \\"in the wild\\".  Definitely worth the read before seeing the movie.<br />Enjoy!
0634022296|4.0|Excellent accurate book for all songs Beatles ! Intro chords never before found and all in one book.    Single biggest complaint is the size of the book. It is difficult to keep it open to any particular page while trying to play and read.    Otherwise a great find. I haven't stopped learning the songs from it since I purchased it.
015603283X|3.0|After watching \\"The Ninth Gate,\\" I wanted to read the book it was based on, possibly to answer some questions about what went on in the movie.    While the book does explain away some of the mysteries, it still left me feeling the story was left unfinished.  The general plot is very well written, it is just the conclusion that left me in bewilderment.      I do recommend reading this book, it just isn't one of my favorites from this author.
B000MGUZKM|5.0|CD arrived quick and just as the seller described. I would definitely purchase from this seller again.
B000ZN8036|5.0|I loved this movie. I think everyone can relate in one way or another to Christopher Mccandless. \\"Into the Wild\\" is one of my favorite films of the year. The story is uplifting and heartwrenching at the same time, it will move you.<br /><br />If you buy the 2 disc DVD, watch the special features. I highly recommend also reading the book, to fully understand the movie.
0441013597|5.0|because each reader must experience it for themselves and no review can convey the sheer impact of the whole.<br />Dune is unlike any other book you have read or will read - in addition to containing accurate information on a wide range of subjects than are NOT common knowledge.<br />If you only read one new book every five years - read this one.
0143039601|5.0|First, let me say that I have read Dharma Bums several times and, of course, found something new and wonderful in each reading. It is, quite simply, a classic American novel, and I feel that the previous two reviews (five stars, naturally) sum up the book's contents, its spiritual impulse, and finally, its dramatic impact on American letters better than I could here.     What I would like to add, then, is that THIS SPECIFIC EDITION (the Penguin Classics Deluxe) is, by far and away, the best out there. In my mind, it is a collector's item, a kind of retro masterwork, and featuring the outstanding if not enigmatic illustrations by the artist known simply as Jason. To be sure: the drawing of Jack Kerouac and Gary Snyder (Japhy Ryder) sitting by the fire high in the mountains, immersed in the moment, is simply a gem.    Finally, if you find this book to your liking, I think you should march right out (metaphorically speaking, I guess, since we are all on-line) and purchase John Suiter's stunning Poets on the Peaks, which is a large, well-designed photo and bio work about Snyder, Kerouac, Philip Whalen and their time spent as fire look outs on Desolation Peak - trust me, the photos in this coffee table book are utterly fascinating.
B000TGJ8CQ|4.0|Nicholas Cage produced and took the lead in this clever, action-packed film inspired by \\"The Golden Man\\", a short story by Science Fiction author Philip K Dick.<br /><br />Quite a few of Philip K Dick's stories have been made into films -\\"Minority Report\\" and \\"Paycheck\\" spring to mind. In my opinion this is one of the best and more imaginative, though certainly not the closest to the original. The hero of \\"Next\\" takes his name and his special abilty from \\"The Golden Man\\" and some of the action scenes brilliantly bring to life equivalent passages from the short story, although the setting and plot are completely different. Where Philip K Dick's original was set in a time after a war where the government hunts down and euthanises all mutants including those with special abilities, \\"Next\\" is set in a time like our own, in which a government faced by a serious terrorist threat is looking for any angle, no matter how strange, to help defeat it.<br /><br />Cage plays Cris Johnson, who has the psychic ability to see into the future - but usually only two minutes into the future, and then only if it is something which affects him. Then he sees a beautiful woman (Liz, played by Jessica Biel) visit a restaurant at a specific time of day at some uncertain point in the future, so he waits there for a few minutes each day at that time until she appears.<br /><br />Cage has been earning a living on the stage using his talent to do \\"magic tricks\\" and supplementing it with a little gambling. But unknown to him, FBI special agent Callie Ferris, played by Julianne Moore, has become aware of his abilities and is convinced his talent is real. She is desperate to apprehend a group of terrorists who have stolen a nuclear warhead and is trying to recruit Cris in the hope that he can help to find the nuke before the bad guys set it off.<br /><br />Unfortunately for both Cris and Liz, the terrorists discover that the same Federal agency which is hunting them is also very interested in Cris.(This isn't stated in the film at any stage but I assumed while I was watching the film that the terrorists are supposed to have either a mole or some kind of highly effective bug inside the FBI.) So the terrorists decide to kill Cris as a potential threat or use someone close to him as a hostage or as bait to flush him out ...<br /><br />The action is pretty much non-stop, usually highly dramatic, and has some original twists, the acting is mostly pretty good, and although there is the odd hole in the plot it is not too difficult to suspend disbelief. The twist at the end is very clever.<br /><br />No, it is never quite explained who the terrorists are or what their objective is, other than that they are a group of ruthless, highly trained and well equipped french-speaking caucasians who want to nuke Southern California. Sadly, in the world we are living in today, the presence of a group of terrorists supported by considerable resources who are prepared to go to great lengths, including the loss of their own lives, to blow up innocent people, is hardly the most implausible part of the film.<br /><br />I'm surprised this wasn't more successful at the box office, I thought it was a very good film, especially if you like Sci-Fi thrillers. If you enjoyed either Paycheck or Minority Report, you will very probably like Next.
B0009K7RES|5.0|This and Ragpicker's Dream are my two favorite Knopfler albums.  A lot of roots-based, memorable, well written songs.  Down-home themes, character pieces, more electric guitar than Ragpicker.
B000F9RB8A|3.0|Pretty disappointed.  I love the movie but I also love to hear the original actors voice instead of the poor English voice over.  I'm a purist in this since and I like to enjoy the movie like I did the first time saw it at the theater with subtitles.  The English voice overs ruin parts of the movie which actually have parts of English in them.  So when I tried to watch the movie in 5.1 surround in Cantanese it wasn't available.  Yet they have it in the DVD version of the movie!  I thought Blu-ray had more capacity than DVDs.  Oh well I guess I gotta watch the movie in simulated surround sound.
0679745653|4.0|Those who know Truman Capote's alternately poignant and comic 1958 novella only through the memorable 1961 Audrey Hepburn [[ASIN:B000BTGY1O film]] directed by Blake Edwards may be surprised to find that Holly Golightly, in her original incarnation, is recalled in a flashback as a nineteen-year old Manhattan \\"party girl\\" during WWII. The still provocative story is really a memory piece fifteen years later by the narrator, a struggling writer with no name except the one given to him by Holly - \\"Fred\\" - after her beloved brother. The rest of the elements will be familiar to anyone who has seen the movie, though Capote is more forthright in describing Holly's hedonistic behavior than film censors could allow in the early sixties. Revealed gradually is her background as Lulumae Barnes, a hillbilly child-bride to Doc Golightly, written with more comedy than pathos here, as well as her erratic, amoral journey to Hollywood as a starlet and then as a \\"companion\\" to wealthy men in New York who give her cash for the powder room.<br /><br />Eccentric characters fill in the corners like Mr. Yunioshi, the Japanese fashion photographer who lives upstairs, and Sally Tomato, the gangster who passes messages to Holly while serving time in Sing Sing. Capote has less affinity for the romantic conventions found in the movie as he more comfortably explores the tale of two emotionally stunted people who find momentary support from one another. The melancholy ending is testament to that, and as such, the book is well worth reading for Capote's gift for illustrative prose. Three very brief stories from Capote are also included with the book, all with their charms - \\"The House of Flowers\\", the fanciful tale of two warring bordellos in the West Indies; \\"A Diamond Guitar\\", a tender story of a prison inmate who attempts to use his glass-diamonded guitar as a means to escape; and \\"A Christmas Memory\\", a childhood remembrance of his distant cousin embodied by the elderly Sook.
0385338724|2.0|I've read Kinsella's other books and enjoyed the stand-alones (Can You Keep a Secret and The Undomestic Goddess) more than the Shopaholic series (liked the characters, got SO bored by the pages and pages of shopping).  Kinsella's voice remains largely the same and her writing is light and enjoyable.      BUT (spoilers ahead) I thought it was disappointing that the premise of the romance in Remember Me? was Lexi's extra-marital affair.  Kinsella sells Lexi as this really decent character who generally does the right thing, but how is cheating on your husband for EIGHT MONTHS the decent thing to do -- even if you are married to the wrong man and he is a total prat?

Tony is being driven by Christoper and they have a 'moment' together. One of the best tracks on the soundtrack to The Departed is Comfortably Numb which features Pink Floyd and Van Morrison.
B00005JNBQ|1.0|This is quite possibly one of the worst movies I have seen, I can not understand how so many people liked this movie. This movie just fell flat in so many ways and was so slow paced, the character were unlikable, the humor was dry as the Mohave desert. Don't get me wrong I do like some dry humor like The Monty Python movies but Napoleon Dynamite was beyond dry. There were maybe 2 funny parts I can count in the whole movie. But don't take my word for it, give a chance and go ahead and rent it. You might like it but for me it was a waste of time and a rental fee.
0385338724|3.0|I am a huge fan of Sophie Kinsella. I really enjoyed her Shopaholic series and recommended them to many of my friends. However, I thought her last one (Can You Keep a Secret?) and this one were just okay. They are definitely light reading but that's fine; anyone who reads Kinsella's books know that going in. However, while most of us remember Becky from the Shopaholic books as a character that just appeals right away, the main character from this book just isn't memorable. The story line is basic and I just didn't find it as humorous as I was hoping for.<br /><br />I still love this author but for me personally, I am glad this was a library book and not a hardcover purchase I had made.

0525948023|1.0|If you are a religious and spiritual person, please don't waste your time reading this.    I was so very disappointed.  I heard the Oprah hype and since I am mid-life and looking to change to a more meaningful career, I thought that I could get some positive insights.  The author continually expressed his 'spiritual superiority' over the 'controlling religions' of the world, and even quoted anti-Christian writer Nietszsche as being a philosopher of deep insight.     The author believes that there is a big difference between being religious and being spiritual.  Of course, he is not religious, but only spiritual.  Basically, that means that he can make up his own rules, and do whatever his insightful brain tells him to, and it feels good.  When you are not part of a religion, you don't have any obligations to take care of others so it is a lot easier to be just spiritual and not religious.    This book can only be appealing to those who have absolutely no religious upbringing, but are yearning for a spiritual calling within their lives.  This book might be fun to read - but then when you are done, it's over.  Instead, please, contact your local church, join up, and help others.  It's so much more rewarding, meaningful and spiritual!

B000IJ7MCC|5.0|Beirut is the Indie-genre band headed by Zach Condon, a twenty-two-year-old native of Albuquerque who dropped out of high school at age sixteen to travel Europe. While there, Condon was irreversibly influenced by Balkan gypsy styles that are manifest in the group's music. Another style characteristic is the prominence of untraditional rock instruments--none of their songs feature the guitar but instead the ukulele, owing to a prior injury of Condon's that rendered him unable to wrap his wrist entirely around the neck of a guitar. Beirut's members are numerous, but among the most notable individuals are Jeremy Barnes and Heather Trost, previous members of Indie accordion band A Hawk and a Handsaw. Beirut's 2006 debut album, Gulag Orkestar, consists of eleven tracks that alternate between melancholic gypsy-inspired songs including titular track \\"Gulag Orkestar\\" and \\"Prenzlauerberg,\\" bubbly pseudo-pop beats \\"Postcards from Italy\\" and \\"Scenic World,\\" and points in-between, most enjoyably \\"Rhineland\\" and \\"The Canals of Our City.\\"    Gulag Orkestar is split between Beirut's two distinct styles--its patently Balkan east European folk style and its own unique effervescent ukulele pop. While Condon's low crooning voice is excellent in the latter milieu, it is difficult to appreciate in the former. Especially in \\"Bratislava,\\" Condon's voice fades to the background as a distant repetitive mournful wail or echo, while cymbals and quavering musette-like trumpets occupying the musical foreground. The lyrics for these songs are inexistent--they are unintelligible as sung; moreover, they can be found neither in the album insert nor online. For this reason, they seem largely irrelevant. They are present only for the sake of there being words set to these songs, some semblance of verses. These gypsy songs are out of place in this album. I would expect to hear them as part of an interesting movie soundtrack or in some Turkish restaurant. In this different light, in fact, I would enjoy them very much. Beirut has previous band members of A Hawk and a Handsaw, which in turn drew influences from Colorado band DeVotchKa, a contributing group to the Little Miss Sunshine soundtrack along with Sufjan Stevens. This style of music thus lends itself excellently to film albums, but not so well to a standard release, unless your quarry happens to be something ethnic and atmospheric.   Despite the seemingly out-of-place interludes, when Condon sings a Western-style song, everything comes together. Emotional, intelligible lyrics roll sweetly off Condon's soothing, low croon. In \\"Postcards from Italy,\\" Condon's slow, contemplative, soothing voice inspires a personal analysis of the past. When he muses, \\"There were always golden rocks to throw / At those who... admit defeat too late,\\" he induces his listeners to contemplate lessons learned from important but flawed people in their own lives. In \\"Mount Wroclai,\\" Condon laments the emotionally unengaged life he might lead in the future. At the opening of the song he ventures, \\"And I know when time / Will pass by slow / Without my heart.\\" As the song ends, he tells of a love so old that it has fizzled out, singing, \\"We grow fat / on the charms of our idle dreary days / Seen the shadows grow.\\" Midway through the album, Condon addresses a midlife-crisis sort of question at an earlier age; he feels trapped, as if he were flowing down a one-way river. In \\"Rhineland,\\" he sings in a subdued wail, \\"Life is all right / But I know / I would have nowhere to go.\\" Finally, \\"Scenic World,\\" the shortest but most notable song on the album, perfectly captures the relaxed introspective mood via imagery and simile. \\"When things don't feel right / I lie down like a tired dog / Licking his wounds in the shade,\\" he sings to a quiet bubbling beat. \\"I try to imagine a careless life / A scenic world where the sunsets are all / Breathtaking,\\" Condon ponders a bad day and consciously decides to improve it. Condon's lyrics, when significant, are introspective gold.   A great appeal of Beirut is its prominent use of unusual instruments including the accordion, cello, euphonium, glockenspiel, mandolin, organ, trumpet, ukulele, and violin. Only the final track, \\"After the Curtain,\\" features vibrant electric guitar riffs, and even then they are overlaid by jubilant cascading marimba arpeggios. In every song, no particular instrument reigns dominant over any other. Each song features several different instruments prominently, but each has its own separate movement in which it is the main player. \\"Gulag Orkestar,\\" \\"Postcards from Italy,\\" and \\"The Canals of Our City\\" are showcases for the vibrato trumpets the likes of which I have never heard before. In \\"Mount Wroclai\\" and \\"The Bunker,\\" the accordion holds the harmony with slurred alternating six-eighths march time; in \\"The Bunker\\" as well as \\"Bratislava,\\" the accordion takes the forefront with its earthy, wonderfully-aged clarinet treble reeds, adding in beautiful embellishment. All songs save for \\"After the Curtain\\" feature Condon's light airy ukulele strumming. The synthesis of these unconventional and quirkily seductive sounds with Condon's low voice is truly a pleasure.   Aside from the glaring incongruity of the Balkan-style songs and its own alt-pop style, Gulag Orkestar was, for me, the musical experience of 2007. Condon's sincere lyrics are poetic dynamite and the band's compositing of numerous distinct instruments contribute to a wide range of effects that everybody can enjoy.

0061148512|5.0|the first few pages of Bell Jar were deceptively banal. though it still made for a relatively interesting read, I initially really didn't feel engaged with the story of Esther. but then the pace picks up as Plath unfolds the subtle but swift undoing that encroaches on the protagonist's consciousness. in no time at all, i found haunting affinity with some of what Esther went through--those times when everything seems to be on a standstill and yet knowing that the world is passing swiftly by without you; times when you feel like almost everything around you is falling apart or is against you, and then feel at turns frustrated, frightened, and furious that the people you hope empathized with you instead misunderstand you.<br /><br />the winning touch on this novel is that the author did not attempt to make Esther's condition clinical or overly dramatic--what transpired rather is an inherently human experience that centered solely on the young woman's perspective that made it more felt to the reader, with touches of merciless lucidity and benevolent numbness.<br /><br />the seemingly harmless events that led to Esther's \\"breakdown\\" may be the very same things that have occured to countless people. now whether the question is if these events triggered her cognitive distortion or if Esther's genes were just waiting on the awning for the right time to manifest themselves is probably eclipsed by the more salient issue of how different humans respond and interpret their world around them. and this is where the central themes of Plath's novel emerge: the societal pressures that pervade in the 1950's, the psychological belief that a female seeks security and material wealth from a male while the latter aims to propagate his genes, the expectations on women regarding virginity, employment, overall savoir-faire, and so on. for Esther to find herself at first sensible and even comfortably adept in her surroundings, but on the next breath fumbling, insecure, and inevitably perplexed with the words, images, and people around her makes it understandable to the reader as to why Esther was driven to her breaking point.<br /><br />this is a very insightful novel in many levels. slyly pulls you in and makes you aware of forces that you take for granted and you let dictate your life. its not just about the searing disappointments and hurts that fester one's soul, it's also about letting go and allowing oneself to simply become human, with all its imperfections.s, images, and people around her makes it understandable to the reader as to why Esther was driven to her breaking point.    this is a very insightful novel in many levels. slyly pulls you in and makes you aware of forces that you take for granted and you let dictate your life. its not just about the searing disappointments and hurts that fester one's soul, it's also about letting go and allowing oneself to simply become human, with all its imperfections.

1596061855|1.0|Author tries to drag traditional detective story plot line 500 years into the future and ends up with a product that is disappointing from a SF or detective story fan perspective.  Story is set in a future scenario that includes such fantastic technology as intergalactic space travel, chip based personality transference, etc and yet we're still shooting bullets?  Main character is inconsistent and dull.  Gratuitous sexual references are clumsy and do little to develop character or plot.  Bought the Kindle version of the book based upon favorable reviews of others and will have to be more discriminating in future to avoid such disappointment.

B000YIGNKE|2.0|I am an avid fan of Jane Austen's works. As such, I am very forgiving of any version of her work that will gain her a greater audience. However, this screenplay so totally changes the character of Anne Elliot that she is hardly recognizable to those who have read the book. Anne was perhaps Jane's ideal woman, yet this screenplay makes her a pathetic silly woman and it's quite hard to believe her capable of attracting anyone's interest, or maintaining it over a span of many years. Too bad we can't hear Jane's critique of this adaptation. I'm sure it would be quite caustic.

0143038419|1.0|It seems to me that she is a self-indulgent person who uses book advance money to romp through a simulation of a fantasy journey of what she would imagine would be healing.  It does not seem to heal her physically, mentally or spiritually from the tone or val-gal prose in her book.  She would do well to read Alice Steinbach's WITHOUT RESERVATIONS not only to get an idea about how the English language itself can be more soothing to a reader, but also to understand how a woman can actually accomplish a more internally healing journey without actually being the archetypical american tourist that can't sit still in an Ashram.  She should quit complaining and put together a gratitude list.  All of her problems are what I tell my suburban children are \\"luxury problems\\".  It does not mean they are not real, but one does not whine about them to the world population that has real problems, like housing, nutrition, health care, children getting shot at in front of their home etc.  She needs a kick in the pants.  If she can not do her mantra and needs to do another one, so what?  Do that.  If she gave just a little of herself, she would find it would make herself feel 10,000 times better.  If she was afraid that all of the U.S. would follow her to her secret place in India, I have news for her, I know many people who have no interest in going anywhere that would tolerate her behavior.  They should have put her on a street corner with no food and let her experience life on life terms for a few months.  She would have come and sat for days without complaining.

0525948023|4.0|To a skeptic,  This is what i get from the idea of \\"A New Earth\\"    (In reference to an email received by a friend who read the review By Kate Smart \\"burnabyheights\\")  I am sad that out of all the reviews, this is the one that resonated with you. What is the point of survival if not to live with a valued purpose (ie happiness). Just in the excerpt i drew from this alone, the last part may have proven true in some cultures or religions (hamas), with regard to 'enemies', but it is not something i will ever identify with... not b/c of naivete, but b/c of (com)passion and humanity i live for.     \\"\\"The author encourages \\"present day living\\" which is antithetical to survival. To survive, you must be looking ahead, at the next step, the next crop, tomorrow's weather, the enemies' next move, etc.\\"\\"    Enemies? We would not have Enemies if we accept how people Are (Trusting they are striving for a common good of a Peace that is Not powered by Ego). Of course people should change, or what i call Evolve... but Accepting yourself, and others, everystep of the way is Essential.     I have heard philosophies that are overrated, such as \\"The Secret\\"... everything in there was a certain common sense (to me), but since it was not initially common to others, i could see how it was embraced as a new way of thinking. I don't know enough about Eckert Tolle, and his candid perspectives here,,, and i don't even know if i need to read the book to Embrace the idea of freeing from Ego since i simply find it coincidental i've been living this way even more since the new year, and that i am (consistently) happier than ever in a lot of ways. But it does resonate with something i came across almost 10 years ago and refer to often (especially since i've been experiencing a lot of it lately)--this is the idea of \\"Healthy Functioning\\". I read once on the back of a book, which i never even bought or read completely... It parallels with A New Earth from what i can tell-- in the sense of \\"Your thoughts are not Real\\" though you have real thoughts, they do Not equate Reality. We have to live free from the Ego of thinking and rationalizing in a lot of ways, and 'accept' more. Not accept and disregard, but accept and Value. Funny enough, it would seem i thrive on the 'thinking' aspect, being as Analytical as i am, But GET THIS: THIS is why i Think Out Loud and Express myself. I REFUSE to LIVE IN My THOUGHTS alone, the way many do... because THOUGHTS ARE NOT REALITY! This is also why i've always been concerned with your level of Internal THinking and keeping to Yourself. THIS is what i understand Eckert Tolle to be talking about, and this is what parallels that concept of THINKING versus HEALTHY FUNCITONING> I try to work things out WITH People as much as possible. To Live in today and Live in FORM OVER THOUGHT, Actually BE and not just Dwell on what \\"might\\" be. In this respect, there is very little to Reason. I respect you as a follower of science, but while science seeks answers, much science is also insistent on energy and sometimes energy 'just is' sometimes it gets 'carried away' or 'mixed up' with resistant energy, sometimes with good energy. I tend to go by \\"vibes\\", good or bad, feeling in my core and not my thoughts ; )    I hope you continue to open your mind. I hope you find as much positivity as possible to defeat skepticism, with a better way of living and sharing whatever time you have in this life     ________________________________  > Not sure I'm a fan. Here is a review that I find makes some excellent points -  >   > By Kate Smart \\"burnabyheights\\"    >I just think a lot of these ideas are unrealistic - they work best if we live in the garden of eden where all our >needs are taken care of for us, and we have no desire to explore with curiosity and learn about the world >and how we can affect it.

B000YXMMAE|4.0|\\"..How come I end up where I started...won't take my eyes off the ball again...\\" These lines say it all. \\"Pablo Honey\\" introduced us to these European lads as sort of an English answer to grunge. Following that was \\"The Bends\\" which may have made them more popular in the UK, but it wasn't until OK Computer that America really fell in love, and it's easy to compare that album to \\"In Rainbows\\" (besides their 8-letter titles). \\"Kid A\\" and \\"Amnesiac\\" allowed them to explore somber atmospheric orchestral ambience and experimental electronics. Then on \\"Hail to the Thief\\" they began to bring back their more rocking side with consistent presence of drums and guitar, though still making much use of electronics and an orchestra. However, what many critics are overlooking is the inclusion of singer Thom Yorke's solo album in this timeline. Because basically In Rainbows and \\"The Eraser\\" split Hail to the Thief in two, with the electronics going mostly to The Eraser and the acoustic guitar and live drums going mostly to In Rainbows. This is a perfect continuation from the mood of their previous output, and the only really new idea is the somewhat calypso accent to some of the moods and beats. Also, these songs should require far less adaptation for the stage than the songs on their previous three albums. Other than that its business as usual.
0452289963|5.0|A New Earth is truly wonderful and enlightening. I love the way Eckhart Tolle takes us into a luxurious world of non-judgment, clarity, and insight.  Like standing on a balcony overlooking a marvelous garden, he has the capability of making a simple observation into a higher-consciousness revelation--without ever shaking a finger.<br /><br />Instead of feeling burdened by ideas, methodologies, or strict principles, Eckhart shows us that we really can have a first class existence if we notice that we are already having one.  He consistently reminds us that nothing needs to be done or implemented; we only to need to consciously realize what the outcomes of our choices are.  He gives us examples of forgiveness, compassion and divine purpose (similar to my book, [[ASIN:1601451326 Forgiveness: The Divine Connection]]).<br /><br />Peace, beauty, and love already exist, all the time, on this earth plane.  We have the ability to anchor this reality permanently and purposefully while still retaining our uniqueness.  Thank you Eckhart for so eloquently pointing this out and making us realize our innate greatness.

B0000640VO|5.0|Who could possibly resist the charm and good feelings that this movie brings? It is a visually stunning and emotionally wonderful film that ranks as one of my favorite films of all time. Audrey Tautou's performace is enchanting and you can't help but root for her throughout the film. Filled with humor, romance and mystery, there isn't much about this film that isn't perfect.
0385341067|5.0|Mr.Pip turned out to be an interesting book after all.The story is set in a lonely island with only one white person whose uniqueness and love for English Literature leads him to be the teacher of a class of kids when all other teachers have fled the island in search for safety.  Mr.Pip introduces Dickens' to class by reading and discussing the book Great Expectations.  The students are as away from the British pattern of living as can be. Their only source of seeing this fascinating country is through the eyes of Pip, the protagonist of Great Expectations.  The students develop an immediate liking to the character as they identify with some of his struggles and also his age.  The unique classroom situations with little else to help them but the great Mr.Pip sometimes fascinates them and other times confuses them.    The confusion pointed out is the great pedagogical question of Making Meaning of the text. The Narrator, a young girl called Matilda seems to think that they had been given another piece of the world where they could enter anytime and do anything. But at other points she feels a disconnect as there is only so much she can learn about Pip or his life after which there seems to be a huge blank space full of questions.  This is precisely what the teachers face in class when they do texts which involve ordinary and extraordinary situations.  What a student makes out of them and gains from them is his calling.   This is what makes the book VERY TEACHABLE as it brings out the dilemmas that young readers face while they encounter new texts.  Explaining the book in terms of their own reading experience and identifying with Matilda's mind is what would make the students look insightfully and introsepctively at the book and all books that would follow.  Thumbs Up TO MISTER PIP.  The book has a tempting array of teachbale moments.  An enjoyable read for all who venture into reading it.

B0013D8LOU|5.0|Without a doubt, Tim Burton's Sweeney Todd is one of his best films and one of the best films of 2007/08. Much better then \\"No Country for Old Men\\" and \\"There will be Blood\\". I also believe this is the best version of the story to. The visionary and music was perfect.     Cant wait to get this on blu-ray.
B00003CY6M|4.0|**** 2001. Directed by Peter Chelsom. A few years after their only encounter in NYC, a man and a woman who believe in signs and in Destiny are in search of each other on the eve of their respective marriage. Great feel-good romantic comedy for the whole family.
B000PKG7I4|5.0|Received very quickly.  Good CD but does not beat Back to Black.  She is a terrific singer and hope she will be around for a while.
B0000W6SYK|4.0|This is a really interesting read, and a must have if you have any interest in the space race at all. This is a book with a lot of detail about each mission that Gene Kranz was involved in, and is interspersed with some neat personal information about his family. Buy it and enjoy it!!
7119005901|5.0|The tactics of The Art of War is pretty much used throughout the book by many of the warlords.    The multiple layers of military deception and feints gets so deep that it creates the oddest strategy of all:  Predicting that your enemy will anticipate a trap or deception, and go the obvious route instead.    Basically to sum it up.  1) China splits up into a dozen warring states and warlords.  2) The \\"Mandate of Heaven\\" seems to motivate the warlords to continue fighting, thinking it's heaven's wish to eventually reunite China (which probably keeps China from becoming like Europe, with a dozen states coexisting).  3) The Art of War is known by nearly all the warlords, all the battles are very tactical.  4) If you're interested in Game theory, there are many complicated alliances, breaking of alliances and betrayals between warlords.
B0007Q6PBK|5.0|I purchased this DVD for my parents, avid opera fans. If you love a classic love story with the most melodic music and are new to opera this is the DVD to buy. As you probably are aware the movie \\"Rent\\" was loosely based on this opera. Although that can't hold a candle to the origianl. Pavarotti and Scotto are perfect together and production and set were top notch. If you've never seen or heard an opera before I highly recommend this as your first. It's timeless and worth seeing.
B00008BRDX|5.0|This was the first Police album I ever owned, and in my opinion, the best album they ever recorded.  All their albums are good, but this one really stands out to me.  There was a great deal of musical growth between this album and the band's debut, Outlandos d'Amour.  Andy Summer's guitar playing really developed, becoming more intricate without losing its distinctive edge.  All of the songs are strong and well constructed.  My favorite Police song is \\"Bring on the Night\\", which is worth the purchase of the album alone.  The deserved classics \\"Message in a Bottle\\" and \\"Walking on the Moon\\"  are both incredible songs as well.  Other standouts are \\"Deathwish\\" and \\"Contact\\", but in truth there's not really a bad song here.  Even the goofy Stewart Copeland song \\"On Any Other Day\\" has its charms, one of the best Police songs Sting didn't write.  A first rater and a true classic that has withstood the test of time.
B000WZAE1I|5.0|I saw this at the theatre and loved it so bought the DVD. Claire Danes, Michelle Pfeiffer and Rober De Niro do a wonderful job of making the characters fun and entertaining. It has all of the ingredients of a fantasy fairy tale that moves with a flow. Excitement, drama, laughter.  My kind of movie. And one that the whole family can watch.
B0000025T6|5.0|In my opinion, this is Springsteen's best record.  It's a no frills recording, made on a portable Tascam unit, with only acoustic guitar, vocals, and harmonica.  This bare bones setting allows the storytelling nature of these songs to shine through.  And the stories they tell are hypnotic, hard luck narratives of the American Dream gone wrong.  Springsteen's album is full of murderers, criminals, and honest men unable to make a go of it, all with the odds stacked against them.  \\"Atlantic City\\" is probably the best known song from this album and one of its strongest cuts.  My favorite has always been the pulsing \\"State Trooper\\" with its undercurrent of implied violence.  \\"Please don't stop me,\\" the narrator begs, while the \\"radio is jammed up with talk show stations\\".  The album is so rich in detail you can almost see the dusty highways, backwater towns, and gambling dens unfold before you.  Nebraska belongs in the pantheon of American Folk music.
B0000029DD|1.0|Like many others, I had heard Mr. Buckley's rendition of Leonard Cohen's Hallelujah and was somewhat impressed.  Thankfully, I didn't buy this CD but was able to sample a friend's copy and found the remaining tracks downright awful.  Obviously, this young man has a large and devoted following, but I would not recommend this CD to any of my musical friends.
B00004Y6NV|4.0|The highest complement any band can hear is that it never really made a bad album.  Dire Straits wins in this regard.  All of this classic band's six studio albums had their own strengths, and rarely more than minor weaknesses.  Such is the case of \\"On Every Street\\" - minor weaknesses might be described as the band getting a bit too focused on the low-key AC style, or veering a bit too far into bluegrass;  but in the end, the music is, as usual, diverse and strong.  \\"Calling Elvis\\" and \\"Heavy Fuel\\" are clever, made-for-FMrock-station tracks; \\"The Bug\\" is a fun rockabilly turn that was made into a country hit by Mary Chapin Carpenter; and the title track is, to me, the fitting epitaph to Dire Straits:  a tale of a police detective, tirelessly tracking down a Jane Doe hit and run victim.  Knopfler is, in a way, that tireless detective, and the average listener is the passive, unconcerned truck driver more concerned about his style than the fate of his victim.  And the victim is like a musical holy grail, that elusive lost chord a guitarist searches for...the perfection in music that he feels he never could quite pin down.  My own message to the band that is no more...rest well, my friends.  It may never have been perfect, but it was always a pleasure to listen to you try to make it that way.  And precious few have ever been closer.

B00004Y6NU|3.0|After the amazing \\"Making Movies\\", the band returned a year and a half later with \\"Love Over Gold\\", an album that had their fewest tracks yet (only 5), featuring the ambitious 14-minute \\"Telegraph Road\\".  The storytelling of the big number is a bit over the top, and even the usually precise Knopfler's solo is muddy and the production seems out of control as the song seems to build like a tornado towards a dramatic ending that never appears.  \\"Private Investigations\\" is a 4 minute song that adds an extra 3 minutes comprised of little more than a plucked bass line.  The remainder of the album is better;  \\"Industrial Disease\\" reveals a playful side of Knopfler set to a catchy danceable number; and the album's concluding track, \\"It Never Rains\\", is a strong number reminiscent of \\"Making Movies\\".  All in all...it's not a bad effort, but considering it's sandwiched in time between Dire Straits' two masterpieces, it's tough to rate it highly.  Knopfler's lofty ambitions would have to wait three more years...
B000FA57N0|2.0|HD-DVD only has DD+ sound. :(    Why is it that Amazon doesn't provide a *large/detailed* pic of the backside of every HD (Blu-ray included) movie?    Fortunately they (or a user?) did.    The regular DVD has DTS 5.1 sound. :)
B00004Y6NP|5.0|After moderate success only with the three albums since their eponymous 1978 debut, nobody expected the Straits to pull a career-making album out of their bag of tricks.  But then, Mr. Knopfler is always full of surprises!  Much like 1980's \\"Making Movies\\", this album is a track-by-track triumph; the classic \\"Money For Nothing\\" is the most memorable and famous track, all eight and a half minutes of it; the title track is a long-standing concert favorite; and the infectious \\"Walk Of Life\\" and smooth \\"So Far Away\\" still live today on adult contemporary playlists.  But there's even more here - \\"Why Worry\\" is a low-key plea for letting go of pain, and the smooth jazz of \\"Your Latest Trick\\" is a sensational highlight.  \\"The Man's Too Strong\\" is a worthy number with sudden, jarring power chords making sure you're listening to what the boss has to say!  You can see, however, the first strains of the demise of Dire Straits in this album.  Knopfler's experimentation was growing too big for the band, and he would start playing with movie scoring (\\"Local Hero\\" and \\"The Princess Bride\\") and bluegrass (check out the wonderful \\"Neck and Neck\\" with Chet Atkins) before Dire Straits would produce its swan song in 1991's \\"On Every Street\\".  The band would only produce a total of six studio albums in a career spanning 13 years...but the musical legacy is timeless.

B00011F5DK|5.0|I am usually the one suggesting we play this game though the kids enjoy it too, excepting my daughter who, at seven, dislikes games she cannot win.  Technically, I think  the kids could beat the grown-ups; the basic tactics are quite simple -- after that it's more about visualizing the spaces.  Overall, a very satisfying (and peaceful) family game.

0307387178|5.0|I hadn't heard of this book, or the main character Chris until the hype from the upcoming movie brought it to me.  I decided that it looked to be a good movie, and that I should read the book first.  Let me first say wow, what an eye opener.  I found the story really intriguing, and loved the way the author JK shoved us into the story without the narration getting in the way.  The extreme measures that Chris undertook to find meaning in his life is jaw dropping.  This book really gave me a new look on life.  The things he endured, and the goals he set for him self were second to none.  When Chris said he was going to do something, he did it.  All though to many this book might not be uplifting, I indeed found this story very inspiring.  Happy Reading!

B0011FDVKE|5.0|So the story is that Tift Merritt found her \\"life in a disarray\\", and went to Paris to write songs and figure things out.  The result is Another Country, and the songs represent her search for love, hope, truth, grace.  The songs throughout seem very intimate and personal.  There are no big vocal flourishes but just her beautiful solid voice.  But she can express more in songs like \\"Another Country\\" or \\"Keep You Happy\\" with her straightforward approach than others try with all their histrionics.  Also notable are the upbeat single \\"Broken\\", the seductive \\"Morning Is My Destination\\", and \\"My Heart Is Free\\" about a soldier dying in battle. Ultimately Another Country is hopeful and uplifting, and a wonderful gift from this talented woman.
B000053ZS6|4.0|I got this CD in 1999 but had to go to a shop that ordered imports in order to get it ! Worth the wait though ! It has alot of songs from alot of different genre's. I liked \\"Are You Gonna Go My Way\\" better when Tom did it on the Jerky Boys Soundtrack rather than the duet he does on this one. \\"Sometimes We Cry\\" with Van Morrison is great pairing two great voices together. \\"Burning Down The House\\" is good but one of my favorites was \\"Mama Told Me Not To Come\\" with the Stereophonics. Overall it's great seeing Tom put a different twist on older classics !! I recommend it to everyone out there who's a TJ fan !

None of these songs really represent the time frame for which \\"Carrie\\" takes place but those are the song choices they went with.
0375424474|5.0|Neil Shubin has a remarkable split career.  He is a professor of anatomy at the University of Chicago, and teaches medical students there.  But he is also a paleontologist, spending time in the field gathering and classifying fossils.  What's the connection?  That's the real subject matter of _Your Inner Fish: A Journey into the 3.5-Billion-Year History of the Human Body_ (Pantheon).  This remarkable book combines anatomy and paleontology into an extraordinarily readable and instructive examination at many levels of just how we are walking assemblies of our fishy, then tetrapod, then mammalian ancestors, and how closely related we are to all other creatures.  It doesn't just go back to fish: \\"One discovery after another in the past century has revealed the history we share with jellyfish, worms, even flies.\\"  Shubin writes with enthusiasm, using a jocular tone that packs in a huge amount of scientific information, as well as descriptions of fieldwork and anecdotes.<br /><br />Shubin had been drafted to teach human anatomy (yes, the cadaver lab) to med students because of faculty departures, and found that his knowledge of the bodies of animal predecessors was a wonderful guide to understanding human anatomy.  The earlier bodies are distinctly different, of course, but they are often simpler variations of our own bodies, and in one chapter after another here he shows how the similarities and differences tell an important evolutionary story.  At about the same time he got tapped to teach anatomy, he and his colleagues had unearthed a new fossil, the 375-million-year-old amphibious creature they named _Tiktaalik_, a link between fish and four-legged, coming-to-dry-land tetrapods.  It had fins like a fish, but within the fins were bones, bones that show beautiful similarities with those in our own arms: a fish with a wrist.  It isn't all anatomy; Shubin has skillfully described current research in molecular genetics to show how we have borrowed genes from our predecessors.  Some of the genes that determine our fundamental body plan (left/right, belly/back, head/tail) are present even back so far as the sea anemone.  Genes which now play a role in controlling our eyes and ears are present even in blind, deaf jellyfish.  Appendages like fins, wings, and arms are all built by similar genes, and when fins started turning into feet and arms, the old genes were used in new ways to make the new limbs.<br /><br />Shubin is a sure guide to both sides of his material.  His book reflects his split interests.  He entered graduate school to study fossil mammals, but embryos and limb buds became the focus of his dissertation.  His very lab, he explains, is split into two: \\"half is devoted to fossils, the other half to embryos and DNA.\\"  Examples from both sides as genially and clearly explained here demonstrate \\"that we were not designed rationally but as products of a convoluted history.\\"  That there are inefficiencies in the way our organ systems work should surprise anyone who thinks a rational designer planned them out, but won't surprise any reader of this delightful book: \\"Looking back through billions of years of change, everything innovative or apparently unique in the history of life is really just old stuff that has been recycled, recombined, repurposed, or otherwise modified for new uses.\\"  We may not have wound up as perfectly efficient organisms, but this is a dramatic and beautiful story of evolution's power, as well as a reminder of how we and all living things share deep and universal roots.ome of the genes that determine our fundamental body plan (left/right, belly/back, head/tail) are present even back so far as the sea anemone.

0061122416|5.0|This is my 12 year old sons favorite book. He borrowed the book from the library in his Latin class and fell in love with it immediately. He finished the book I think in about 3 nights. I highly recommend for those inquisitive tweens/teens in your life.
0920236251|5.0|I bought the 3.5 x 3.2 sized edition.  It's a good quality color book and very cute.  The cover is not hardcover but a pretty sturdy softcover.  Perfect size for purses, diaper bags, and pockets.  Also might interest a collector of miniature books.  The story is about a princess who rescues a prince from a dragon.  It's a nice break from the majority of helpless princess books that most little girls want and read.
B00000064F|5.0|I never held emotion in the palm of my hand - until I bought this album. It's full of life - in that typically Drakesque, somber but lush, sound. Wake up, get a cup of coffee, maybe light a cigarette and listen to this album...
B00008YJHC|3.0|The glaring omission from the Pixies \\"Best of\\" compilation is \\"The happening\\" [okay, \\"River Euphrates\\" too, from \\"Surfer Rosa...why the hell is that song NOT on the compilation either?]. \\"The Happening\\" is a song, like \\"Monkey gone to Heaven\\" on \\"Doolittle\\", which gradually revealed it's charms to me. I suppose my main criticism of the song is that the first half is so uninspiring. You get a hint of the beauty and prettiness to come in the song and after a few listens, that is what makes this song one of Pixies' best. The last minute is just gorgeous-delicate and light vocals meld wonderfully with the music. It's lush in sound and poetic in quality. If you can find your way into the beauty of the latter part of this song, you won't mind so much the incongruous first part of this song. Not sure what the song is about...something about aliens?      If you like Pixies' more hardcore stuff, like Surfer Rosa, and, to an extent, parts of Doolittle, I don't think this album with have that much attraction for you.  It's more commercial in sound, mellow and laid-back. And, once again, Kim Deal is underutilised in the backing vocal department, though, as usual, her bass playing isn't as buried as her vocals are/can be.       Apart from The Happening, which is one of their best songs, here are some other songs I liked or which reminded me of other songs:    Is she weird? : bassy, nice lead guitar on the 1st string, I think. The BBC version of this song is probably superior [i.e. the collection of Pixies songs recorded at/by the BBC].     Down to the well: should be the second best track on this album BUT the arrangement is just poor. Mind you, I had been spoiled by listening to the BBC compilation before I heard this album, and the BBC version does have a MUCH greater arrangement...with Kim Deal's backing vocals significantly enhanced from the foggy sounding backing going on here as well as the rejigged intro which just works better, I think. In other words, I think the band has achieved the definitive version of this song in the BBC studios.    Hang wire: sort of catchy song.    Blown away: poppy song.    Ana: mellow song, with a nice lead guitar melody and breathy vocals.    Cecilia Ann: I jotted down \\"Swamp rock\\" when I was making notes on this album. I don't think I have ever heard the genre of \\"swamp rock\\" before [Australian indie band The Scientists are often called this kind of band] but this song sounds what like what I would imagine Swamp Rock to be!  It's an instrumental, with a vaguely The Shadows type feel to it, mixed with some Billy Idol type music. It's also a cover version of a track, I think, so, not original Pixies.    Rock music: has a conventional rock sound with some hardcore vocals. Some words reminded me of Michael Jackson...e.g. Francis may be quoting a Jackson line when he says something like \\"shamon\\" [sp?].     Velouria: has more normal type singing and Kim does harmonies. Has some weird sci-fi type noises.      I should point out an EPIC song on this cd [by Pixies standards!]-\\"All over the world\\", which runs some five and a half minutes. It's not unusual for Pixies song to barely make it past the minute and a half mark. Two minute songs are pretty much par for the course.    Lastly, \\"Stormy weather\\" - has repetitive lyrics-something the Pixies do now and again. Not sure if that is due to laziness, or just keeping it simple with good results.      Overall, since this album has \\"The happening\\" and that does not appear anywhere else [well, their \\"B Sides\\" compilation has a variant on this, which is good, but not as pretty, i.e. \\"The thing\\"] this album is buyable.  It's just not as hardcore or up to the mark set by their earlier classics like Surfer Rosa and Doolittle.
B00000K31V|5.0|I'm a big fan of Jude Law, so I might just be saying this because he is in the movie, but eXistenZ is worth watching over and over. There are things I  notice every time I watch it. If you love gaming, and you want something that is a little more edgy, and will keep you thinking about it long after the movie is over, this film is for you. If you like psychological thrillers, cute guys, and games, you can't go wrong with eXistenZ
B000FGGE68|2.0|Okay, basically, this was a bad movie. A prime example of how special effects don't make up for plot and/or presentation.    The best part of the entire film was the 12 second scene where she prints out a disposable cell-phone. That was the coolest thing I've ever seen.    If you consider buying this movie, you'll be much better off renting it. Once is all you'll want to watch it, if that.
B00005JLCI|5.0|hello, all your Shakespeare fans! This version of Hamlet is perfect for the 21st century. The acting is phenomenal, the sets are gorgeous, and faithful to the time period. The clothing may be a little modern, but at least  Hamlet isn't running around with a hand gun.    Also, I think this is the most nuanced performance of Hamlet you will see on film. Unlike the 1945 version, Hamlet actually displays more range of emotion, rather than just degrees of melancholy. Also, the delivery of lines is unsurpassed. The pacing, emotion, and tone are perfect.  It leaves you feeling as if you have actually experienced his story
B0002Z0EYK|5.0|I believe Troy to be one of the greatest epic films ever made.  Except for a few sexual scenes the movie is clean - they could have left those scenes  out.  Effects were a knockout - very real battle scenes - awe spiring when the Greek army approached Troy to do battle.  Well written and never a dull moment.  I especially liked how they portrayed Hector as a man of honor, valor, and brave to the end.  Hector became my hero of the movie and one of my all time favorite characters.      This movie has made my top five favorite movies due to the cinematography, plot, actors, battle scenes, and effects.  I felt I went back in time when I watched the movie.    The special features were very interesting and gave good insight on the immensity of making such a movie.    Men - if you like battles, brave soldiers, and great special effects this movie is for you.    Enjoy!!!!
0393312836|5.0|Wow, this book goes after some truly weighty subjects in a short time frame.  Burgess tells the story of his narrator, Alex, who is a clearly intelligent young man who has focused his youthful talents on setting out each night to terrorize the innocent citizens of a futuristic London.      The book is famous for Burgess' heavy use of a made-up slang that a committed reader will pick up quickly using context clues.  It actually serves to focus your attention on the book rather than as a distraction.  Further, Burgess uses the slang to differentiate groups of characters within the book and, in some of the book's most interesting moments, one side of a character from another side within himself.  The dichotomies created are very clear without being ham-fisted.  Very well done.    Burgess really creates a gritty, enveloping sense of place and mood as Alex and his pals meander through the city.  As the reader, you simultaneously feel their sense of power (empty though it may be) and the victim's sense of fear and helplessness.  Another great exploration of the duality of character within each of us, and yet this is still just a warm up for the main event!    The story hits its peak once Alex is sold out by his pals and captured by the police (who aren't really good guys).  Alex volunteers/is chosen for a new procedure which will \\"cure\\" him of his evil tendencies.  The scenes of brainwashing that follow are wonderfully crafted and this whole segment of the book artfully asks whether it is better to have a choice between good and evil when only a portion of us will choose good, or whether it is better for all of us to be good even at the cost of our free will.  It's a tremendous look at freedom vs. authoritarianism in all its forms.    As Alex is released back into the world, we see the flip side of his original self, someone incapable of any form of evil.  The string of events that follows brings up as many penetrating questions for the reader as any other portion of thebook.  Alex finishes (if you get a book with the 21st chapter - make sure you do) slightly older, with more perspective on his situation.    A book about the two sides (at least) we all have within us and the freedom some of us have and some of us lack to let the two sides out.  Highly recommended, you can see why this one has stood the test of time.
0131103628|3.0|Everyone goes on about K&R ... God's of C etc. etc. Yes, they may have invented the language but you would think otherwise from reading this book.    I programmed C for an embedded system for years and often sought answers about the very lowest level, nitty-gritty details of C. For a while I turned to this book, but soon learnt from experience that I could ALWAYS find the answer, or a better answer, in \\"C: A Reference Manual\\".    This book was published in 1988 and is showing its age. It has not been updated with the latest ANSI/ISO standardizations. It is also very dated in it's layout, typography, approach etc.    Summary: If you want the definitive C reference book, buy \\"C: A Reference Manual\\". It's not 1988 anymore - move on people!! Skip this book.
0375507256|5.0|This is a challenging but addictive book. Basically, it consists of six interrelated short stories, each told in a different narrative style, and each exploring, in varying contexts and on varying scales, the methods by which one individual or group preys upon another, the oppressor's flawed justifications for so doing, and the power of individuals to triumph over oppression and change the course of history. Sometimes the triumph is personal, sometimes it's far reaching, but it's always meaningful. Overall this was probably one of the most impressive works of contemporary fiction I've read in a while; took some effort to get into it, but I'm glad I stuck it out. Highly recommended.
B000DN5W4I|5.0|I enjoy hearing great live music,and really enjoy seeing it performed live.  This video displays the true talents and joy of performing live at a small venue. My only criticism is that the camera setups always leave you wondering why the crowd scenes take precedent over closeups of the performer displaying his talents?
B00005NKKZ|5.0|There are those who will tell you that Simon And Garfunkel's Bridge Over Troubled Water (1970) is \\"overrated\\", but I don't see it that way at all. The album contains two undeniable masterpieces, Bridge Over Troubled Water and The Boxer. Both songs are songwriting monuments, beautiful and significant, and the vocal performance and production on both is flawless. Bridge Over Troubled Water could quite possibly be the greatest song ever written. With an impressively gorgeous melody and inspiring lyrics that describe the most decent of all of human behavior, it rises to the highest level of greatness while simply and gently touching even the most helpless and vulnerable.<br /><br />When you're weary, feeling small<br />When tears are in your eyes, I will dry them all<br />I'm on your side when times get rough<br />And friends just can't be found<br />Like a bridge over troubled water<br />I will lay me down<br /><br />Cecelia is another great song, and while not as sweeping as the title song or painfully sad as The Boxer, it's infectious melody, Latin rhythms and intelligent lyrics make it a classic and an all-time favorite of many. The simple folk song El Condor Pasa (If I Could) and the fragile The Only Living Boy In New York are both remarkable songs in their own right, but a little overshadowed by the three hit singles on the album. The big band jazzy Keep The Customer Satisfied is another winner here (I always think of Arthur Miller's Death Of A Salesman when I hear it). I also like the fun rocker Baby Driver and the live version of The Everly Brothers' Bye Bye Love. So Long, Frank Lloyd Wright is a unique tribute to the famous American architect, and Paul Simon and his acoustic guitar close the album quietly and thoughtfully with A Song For The Asking.<br /><br />Bridge Over Troubled Water was Simon And Garfunkel's last studio album, and possibly their best. It won five Grammy Awards including Album Of The Year, went to number one on the Billboard Music Charts, is ranked #51 on Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Albums Of All Time list, and has sold over 25 million copies. This album isn't overrated, it's a wonderful classic!Albums Of All Time list, and has sold over 25 million copies. This album isn't overrated, it's a wonderful classic!
B000BW7QWW|5.0|Sad but maybe true. Josh is reported to have said that there will be no Serenity II.    The closing scenes made me wish we could continue to follow the exploits of the captain and crew. You know they just had to have a lot more interesting adventures ahead of them. I'm sorry we won't get to go along.    So we'll just keep re-running our Firefly and Serenity DVDs till the pits wear out.    Jim
B000ZK4466|4.0|This album is the most inovative album of the year probably  it is a Mars Volta classical.  In this ouija based album the band has focused more on metal and punk ryhthms. And although most of the songs are relatively shorter than the ones on past albums, the music sounds nothing like before.  this new album has definitely introduced a new, and even sicker Mars Volta .

Great choice of songs here that any one would love to hear over and over again.<br /><br />The \\"RED & \\"BLUE\\" albums are examples of stuff the record label was putting out. With no other reason except to offset the sales of Paul McCartney & John Lennon solo lp's. In their pitiful effort to force The Beatles back into reforming.  (Along with lp's called, Rock and Roll Music & Love Songs) Notice they would always release them at the same time John or Paul had a new solo lp coming out.?

0375424474|5.0|In Your Inner Fish, Neil Shubin well explains how much of our anatomy is derived from ancient animal forms going back to our fish ancestors and beyond. I enjoyed his appearance on the Cobert Report with Stephen Cobert and his discussion with Carl Zimmer on bloggingheads.tv. It is fun to read and listen to someone who is excited about what he does.    In this book, Shubin describes how the bones in our middle ear originated from the gill arches of fish. Before we acquired them, those same gill arches were used by reptiles to form bones in the jaw. We, in turn, took those jaw bones and moved them into our ears and use them for hearing. This is just one example of the transitions that Shubin describes. Others involve our senses of smell and sight and how we have modified them from what we received from our pre-mammalian ancestors. Much of this information we continue to carry in our genes.    This is a well written book and should be easily understood and enjoyed by those who do not have a science background. I would especially recommend it for those who are confused by the creationists who preach the fallacies of evolution and the lack of transitional forms.

B000RJO578|3.0|After the critical and commercial success of Shaun of the Dead, it looks as if Edgar Wright and Simon Pegg were given the freedom to do anything they wanted.    Too much freedom, it seems. I often found myself wondering what kind of movie Hot Fuzz wanted to be and I am not sure Wright and Pegg knew themselves. Even the most talented writers and directors need some critical feedback while practicing their craft. It just appears they didn't get it.    Hot Fuzz throws in nearly plot and storyline imaginable in a two hour film that could have easily been cut by 30 minutes. The Scream-like killer becomes a very odd detour that drains comedy out of the movie and the predictable plot twists never transform into the genre bending genius of Shaun of the Dead.    They just remain predictable plot twists in a rather lukewarm effort.

B00139W3NE|2.0|This move is basically trying to be Harry Potter, but just can't pull it off. The plot is pretty ridiculously convoluted, none of the characters are really developed all that deeply, and its basically just a bunch of cheesy CGI. (Complete with the bear from the Coke Christmas commercials) I didn't like this movie essentially for the same reason people didn't like the new star wars movies, its just all action and cheesy CGI, no real heart to it. Just a mush of wannabe Harry Potter with toned down versions of Lord of the Rings scenary, and maybe a hint or two of Magic the Gathering or World of Warcraft (Hey, the bears armor was soulbound!) I gave it two stars because I found it mildly entertaining, despite the fact I found myself still laughing more at the movie than with it.
B0013D8LOU|2.0|I waited for years to see this on the big screen, but have to say it wasn't worth the wait.  I found the leads, without exception incapable of delivering the emotion necessary for the music due to inexperience.  I very quickly grew tired of Helena Bonham-Carter's endless deadpan, even in moments when something more should have seemed appropriate.  Also annoying was the derivative look of the film, based largely on the Universal Horror pics of the Thirties-even Johnny Depps \\"Bride of Frankenstein\\" hair, and a bit of German Expressionism for good measure.  The gore did seem gratuitous in the manner in which it was presented although necessary in context of the film.  I wish I could have liked it more.
0385341067|3.0|MR. PIP is a novel set on an island finding itself plunged deeper and deeper into civil strife and it is a fact that one could almost overlook for the first third of the book. Instead, Lloyd Jones asks the reader to focus on the power of narrative to offer insights and escape from a world crashing down around us. Additionally his characters our so well developed and interesting that it causes the reader to get lost in them.   MR. PIP is not a book that I would expect to find myself not wanting to put down, and yet it managed to draw me in. The most interesting aspect of the novel was not its plot but its characters and finding out how they develop, as well as why they became who they are. First and foremost is the protagonist of the novel, a thirteen year old girl, Matilda. She is intelligent, responsive and more insightful of the events that make up the world around her than many would expect. Her strained relationship with her mother, and its impact on her and the events of the novel really come to light in a surprising way over the course of the narrative.   The other character that piques curiosity in not only the reader, but the people of the novel is Mr. Watts, the only white-man in the town of about sixty people.  Initially he is treated as something of an outcast, as he has this strange ritual of dragging his black wife on a cart through town while wearing a clowns nose. However, when he steps up and decides to begin teaching the children of the town he is transformed into a respectable source of knowledge and wisdom, at least in the eyes of the children. Yet, throughout the course of the novel one is left to wonder what landed this man on an island where he feels \\"like the last mammoth\\", married to a woman who appears to be crazy.   The desire, the need, to know more about these characters drove me to read on and caused me to become engrossed in the novel. Whatever other shortcomings the novel may have can be forgiven because of the interesting nature of its characters. I would offer however that the novels shortcomings are not great and that it really provides the reader with some interesting insights into the power of storytelling.
B000F7OPCC|5.0|Each of the Indiana Jones movies is strong enough to stand on its own merits, but this one is my personal favorite. Why? Well, there are many reasons. First off, we're adventuring with not one but TWO Joneses, as Indy is joined by his father played by Sean Connery (who else?). John Williams is again in top form here, with pieces ranging from frantic ( the castle escape and cycle chase) to medieval and mythic.    One of the things I like is that this is the warmest of Indy's adventures, but luckily it's not in a gooey E.T. kind of way. That wouldn't work for Indy. Rather, the warmth is displayed through the film's humor (it's arguably the funniest of the three.), and the strained father-son dynamic works to the audiences advantage, getting in some good laughs in some of the hairiest situations. Sallah and Marcus Brody return from the first film with expanded roles, both providing some fun comic relief.    The quest is of course, the most important part of any Indy film, and as with Raiders, Indiana is going head to head with the Nazis on a quest for an artifact of incredible power- the Holy Grail. The stakes are impossibly high, and as Jones, Sr. puts it, \\"There's no silver medal for second place.\\"    The stunts are another big part of the series, and as with the other two films, Indy doesn't disappoint, finding new ways to make us sit on the edge of our seats and bite our nails. There's a fair share of action, including fistfights, gunfights, chases, and of course knocking a German Colonel out the window of a Zeppelin.    Well, you've read enough...Don't stand there, watch it!

0060763892|4.0|I've been reading James Rollins since Excavation came out and he is one of my favorite authors. But ever since The DaVinci code came out he has tried to write to that style of popularity. I would love for him to go back to writing original stories with new characters and leave Sigma behind. They are enjoyable reads but I can only read about church conspiracies and such for so long. I never really got into a groove with this book and it took me a while to read. With that said I gave the book 4 stars partially because of the content and also because I love the author and have been with him since the beginning.

B000T9OP7G|5.0|The first season of TERMINATOR: THE SARAH CONNOR CHRONICLES was a good one.  Though fans are now brooding over whether the series will be picked up for a second season -- this is, after all, FOX, killer of shows -- the ratings overall were good, especially in the 18-49 demographic.  While I would be the first to acknowledge that you should never underestimate FOX's ability to kill a good show, even FOX will hesitate to cancel a show doing this well in the most desired demographic.  If the series is cancelled, it would definitely rank as the most dim-witted cancellation in FOX's history.  At least some of the other very good shows that it cancelled were struggling with ratings.  My guess is that they will bring it back in the fall and pair it with 24 on Monday nights.<br /><br />A lot of fans of the original two TERMINATOR films (we can all pretty much ignore the third TERMINATOR film, which even the makers of the forthcoming Christian Bale-as-John Connor film is not going to treat as canonical) were bugged to no end with minor or (in their minds) major chronology issues.  My response is:  who cares?  First, we are talking about two very good SF films, but they are not the cinematic equivalent of WAR AND PEACE.  Second, fans of the TERMINATOR films need to learn the same sensibility that fans of comic superheroes have learned:  change is good.  I mean, what is canonical in Batman?  What cannot be allowed in Iron Man?  There have been so many variants in comics that if it weren't allowed, there would be no comics.  Besides, in the history of story telling there have been an almost uncountable versions of various stories throughout history.  If TERMINATOR: THE SARAH CONNOR CHRONICLES plays around with thee films' chronology, this is the biggest \\"no big deal\\" of all time.  The question is whether the adjustments lead to some great storytelling.  I believe it does.<br /><br />Casting is incredibly important in a series like this.  Although by the end of the season more characters are introduced than one might have initially imagined, this is mainly a three-person show.  Lena Headley, who is best known to mainstream American TV viewers from the film 300 (though she has been in a very large number of other films and TV series), does a great job in the title role, with one exception.  She looks the role, acts the role, comes across as tough in the role.  I completely buy her.  But I really hope in Season Two that they decide to dispense with the opening narrations.  Though she is a good actress, she doesn't sell the narration.  Kristen Bell on VERONICA MARS and now on GOSSIP GIRL makes it seem so effortless, as does Jim Dale on PUSHING DAISIES.  But it is an easy to underestimate skill.  No doubt the writing hinders Headley in her narration.  It comes across as too self-conscious, too aware of itself, too unnatural.<br /><br />Thomas Dexter, who most know from a controversial character from early Season One HEROES (his character was initially Claire the cheerleader's gay best friend -- but when Christian groups started complaining about a gay character, they suddenly un-gayyed him -- I wonder if people who are so obsessed about saving America from gays and the dangers gays represent to marriage [though I've never quite grasped the connection between keeping two dudes getting married and how that is going to make heterosexual marriages healthier] spent more time working on their own marriages if the Bible Belt, which currently has the highest divorce rate in America, would have more successful marriages, heterosexual or otherwise), does a very creditable job as John Connor, the sixteen-year-old version.  The challenge of playing John is that it has to be made creditable that this kid would sometime become the kind of leader who could lead a resistance.  My major complaint with T2 is that this wasn't done.  I think Dekker by the end of the season started doing that.  Early in the season he seemed more rebellious, headstrong teenager.  But by the end of the season he had started maturing.<br /><br />The producers of the show say that they created the role of Cameron with Summer Glau in mind.  To show how crucial she was in their conception of what they wanted to do, she was offered the role outright, instead of auditioning people for it.  And it is obvious that they knew why they wanted her:  they'd obviously seen FIREFLY and SERENITY and saw how she played the on-the-edge insane River Tam, who is simultaneously a genius, a psychic, a highly honed killing machine, and a crazy person.  There is some legitimate complaint about her performance in the Pilot, but it is the fault of the writing and directing and not Glau.  In the Pilot when we first see her, she is a super friendly, socially smooth, chipper, giggly high school girl in the first episode.  But the rest of the season she seems to have the same social skills that Arnold did in his turn as your friendly neighborhood terminator.  Once they got past the pilot, however, Cameron became one of the best things in the show.  Most robots on TV are clearly persons, even if they are not human.  Data, for instance, was clearly, for all his lack of emotion, a person.  Sharon on BATTLESTAR GALACTICA clearly is, as is Caprica Six.  Even the Doctor on STAR TREK: VOYAGER is clearly a person.  There is a famous thought experiment known as The Turing Test, from a thought experiment proposed the famous Cambridge mathematician and super genius John Turing.  He imagined a test in which a human being and a computer were separated from a questioner by a wall.  A series of questions would then ensue.  If the questioner couldn't, by the answers that were given, tell which respondent was the computer, then, Turing reasoned, that computer could be considered a person.  Cameron is the first important TV cyborg, robot, or android since Robot on LOST IN SPACE who probably couldn't pass the Turing test.<br /><br />Let me expand a bit on this.  Although Cameron can attend school, hang out with people, and basically pass for human, she constantly exposes the gap between her and humans.  This is incredibly unusual for television.  As a result, this could end up being one of the most important cyborg characters in the history of TV, at the very least the one that could inspire some interesting reflection.  She is the first cyborg character on TV who truly seems to be completely devoid of compassion.  Early in the season, when a girl she has \\"befriended\\" is about to jump off a roof in a public act of suicide, Cameron refuses John's entreaties that they do something to help her.  Later in the season she promises a ballet instructor, from whom she seems genuinely interested in learning some ballet (it helps that Summer Glau is a real life prima ballerina -- her first acting job was on an episode of ANGEL as a ballerina and she and ANGEL creator Joss Whedon are reportedly working together on a ballet film), that she will save both her and her brother from the people seeking to kill them if they will give her information that she is seeking.  They give her the information, but instead of helping them, she coldly (not cruelly -- Cameron does not seem capable of cruelty, just as she is incapable of compassion) exits the building.  When asked later why she didn't help them, she replies that it wasn't part of the mission.  When John asks her if she lies, she admits that she does, even to him.  And the season is filled with some wonderful Cameron moments, such as when she one minute complains about their looking for the remains of a dead girl, because she a dead human is merely \\"meat and bones,\\" and a few minutes later is found sitting beside John, talking with him, as she applies pink polish to her nails.  Her character is filled with incongruities.  Oh yeah, she is blown up at the end of Season Two, but no one really believes that she won't be back, do they?<br /><br />I liked the patience of the show in Season One.  They very gradually broughtalong three supporting characters.  Dean Winters in the Pilot played Sarah's fianc&eacute; Charly and I fully expected the guy I think of as The Beeper King (from his role as Liz Lemon's boyfriend on 30 ROCK) to immediately disappear from the show.  Instead he has reappeared in several episodes.  My guess is either that he will be killed off or he will end up as part of Sarah and John's little army of supporters.  I'm guessing the same will be true of Richard T. Jones's Agent Ellison, who started off as someone after Sarah because he considered her a mere murdered, but as the season has gone alone has come to believe that she was not lying when she claimed to be chased by robots from the future.  The finale saw Ellison and a substantial group of FBI agents attack and get mauled by the terminator after John.  I would lay money on Charly in the first episode of Season 2 taking Ellison to meet Sarah and having him become another member of her cadre.  The third character to emerge was Brian Austin Green as Derek Reese, the brother of Kyle Reese from the first TERMINATOR movie and therefore the uncle of John.  I didn't much care for his character by the end of Season One, but that is mainly because he was so gruffly written.  I also got tired of his endless suggestions that something needed to be done about Cameron, that she was a killing machine that couldn't be trusted, bladdy blah blah.  I hope they either kill him off or deepen his character in Season Two.  I suspect they will take the latter route.<br /><br />My last comment is that this show managed to do what any good show need to:  it got better as it went along.  I enjoyed the first episode, but with each successive episode I liked the show more and more.  I am very much looking forward to Season Two.  And completely confidant that there will be one.

B000WZAE1I|5.0|This has to be one of the best films ever made. It is a great fantasy story with awesome effects, good humor, and great acting. I definitly recomend this movie for everyone to see.
6305971935|5.0|I'm a sucker for time travel movies. Even bad ones will garner a little interest from me. One of the best ever made was THE PHILADELPHIA EXPERIMENT.    During an experiment in which the government is experimenting with ways to cloak a naval ship from radar, two guys are accidentally transported 41 years into the future - where the exact same experiment is still taking place.    What happened to those who remained back with the ship is even more disturbing and are images that I'll never forget.    I don't want to give up any more information, as I don't think it is necessary to give away any more plot points. It's an incredible story that I believe appeals to both men and women.    What is even more bizarre is that the experiment itself actually happened - and what is said to have really taken place may be equally hard to believe.    Of course, years later, THE PHILADELPHIA EXPERIMENT 2 was released losing all of the originality of its predecessor.
B00000IFP6|4.0|Some have criticized this set as being \\"light-weight\\" Beethoven.  I am inclined to disagree.  There is a certain lightness to these recordings, but it is more a general feeling of the orchestra being \\"light on it's feet,\\" as opposed to simply being light-weight.  I am reminded of Ali's famous saying \\"float like a butterfly and sting like a bee.\\"  That is exactly what these recordings do, they may have a lighter feeling that normal for these works, but the power does not fail to come through when needed.    As most people have said in their reviews, the tempos used by Zinman and his band are ultra-quick.  In most cases, the quick tempos work quite well, and are not a distraction in any way.  Of course, there are exceptions.  I have heard a few people complain that the second movement of the fifth is taken too quickly.  I do not agree, the fifth here is one of the best I have heard, slow movement, included.      However, the sixth and ninth symphonies seem to fare worst in fast tempos.  The sixth is notoriously difficult to pull off convincingly, with most conductor's playing it too quickly, Zinman's quick tempos here just re-enforce the idea that this symphony should be played more slowly.  However, it is worth noting that Zinman's rendition is no worse than other quick versions such as Karajan's.    The Ninth, my favorite, comes off slightly worse.  The first movement seems good, as does the second, until the trio begins.  Although I like the second movement played quickly, but the speed required to adequately contrast the trio in this rendition is just too much.  The third movement, an \\"Adagio\\" is the worst though.  It is played here as an Andante, and although this really emphasizes the lyrical beauty of the piece, it robs it of it's power which is much more important in this piece.  The finale is too is quick, but for the most part it does work here.  The tenor solo after the march is certainly too fast though.    The rest of the symphonies (1,2,3,4,5,7,8) all come accross very well though, with numbers 1, 2, and 4 perhaps being my favorite versions.  The third might be my favorite, but for the famous slow funeral march being taken too quickly.  Its speed is nowhere near as bad as in the ninth, but enough to prevent it from being a favorite.      The movement's where this cycle really shines is in the scherzos and finales.  This is especially true of the third, fifth and seventh symphonies.  I especially love that Zinman decided to take the repeat in the fifth's Scherzo.  The Cello/Bass section solos in that piece send tingles down my spine and it is great to hear it twice.    Despite its shortcomings, this is still a four star set.  There are certain parts that are not good, but the good parts are great.  This is certainly a good place to start exploring Beethoven's symphonies, or a good way to expand your understanding of them.    **Also check out Zinman's renditions of the Beethoven Concerti.  The quick tempos seem to work universally well in the concerti as opposed to the symphonies.  It also seems that having another \\"equal\\" collaborator in the soloist may have eliminated some of Zinman's excesses in tempo.
1416523359|2.0|I 1st began reading Stephen King when Carrie was 1st released over 30 years ago. He has been a favorite author of mine for all that time, and I've anticipated every new book and usually read them in a day or so.     Lisey's Story is a change of that tradition. Yes I looked forward to it. However it was the 1st book of King's that I had trouble getting into. There are several reasons for this.    1: The start of the book was very slow. It took my over a 1/3 of the book before it got interesting.    2: The writing style with all the internal dialog was smucking torturous to slog through.    3: The skipping around in time created a lot of confusion. Up until the last 3rd I thought that Scott had died when he was shot by Cole, not when he really did.    4: The story was predictable. Not something I expected from a SK book.    I bought the hardcover and by the time I finished it the paperback was out. that is hte 1st time that has ever happened with a Stephen King book for me.    Hopefully this is a one time occurance.
0385338724|4.0|There is a book by Agatha Christie titled Why Didn't They Ask Evans?  My main thought as I finished this book was why didn't Lexi confide in Fi, her best friend since childhood.  If she had, things would undoubtedly have been better for her.  Or at least her other old friends might have understood. . .    I have to agree with Cordelia that I was disappointed in Lexi for having an affair.  She seemed a much more decent type than that.  I don't get any sense of characters being churchgoers at all, but surely they've heard of the commandment Thou Shalt Not Commit Adultery.  Falling in love with Jon is understandable, given her total incompatability with Eric.  Having an affair is not.    ChicBookFiend made a good point when she said that this book is similar to 13 Going on 30.  Both heroines have discovered that they have become beautiful and successful, but they seem to have turned into bitches and try to learn how it happened.  I think it's nicely done in this book.  And, as it turns out, the reason is a totally logical one.      This was a nice enjoyable read, and I look forward to sharing it with my friends.  However, I'm looking forward to the Shopaholic movie (and I think Isla Fisher will make a great Becky, although I'd have loved to see Christian Bale as Luke) and hopefully another Shopaholic book (Shopaholic & Daughter perhaps?) soon.
B000002AGE|5.0|I have had this album/cassette/CD since it came out.  That was way back in 1977, God, does that make me feel old!  I remember when this album was new like it was yesterday.  This is the first album that features Jaco Pastorius exclusively on bass (Black Market featured him as well as Alphonso Johnson).  While most people consider this to be Weather Report's \\"best\\" album I tend to disagree.  Black Market and Mysterious Traveler are better.  But this is by far their most commerically successful album (the song Birdland has become a jazz standard-even The Manhaatan Transfer did a cover of this song, for cryin' out loud!). Nevertheless, it is a great album and fans of Westher Report will not be disappointed.

B0001ARCFA|5.0|Like the title of my review says, they're quite comfortable.  If you intend to wear headphones for long periods of time, these are pretty much the way to go.  the one downside though, is that the ear pads are made of a leather-type material.  this means that they tend to get a little warm if you wear them for a while.  what you should really look into is a pair of headphones with a soft fabric on them.  they won't get nearly as hot (not to say that these are unbarable), but you'll be comfortable AND cool.  Oh, and I also feel compelled to mention that Dave Chapell sports these puppies in a couple acts on his show (where he's rapper)
B000000OTJ|5.0|First off, let me say I have ALL GnR Cd's, released, not released, legal, illegal, hahaha.  Anyway, I am a huge fan so I picked this up about 15 years ago when it came out.  I think it's fantastic.  It's compiled of covers of some great rock songs.  It's rare for me to be able to say this, but these covers (IMO) are BETTER than the originals.  If you're a die hard fan you'd like it a lot. If you're a radio release only fan, don't bother you couldn't possibly appreciate this, or anything else for that matter.
B000VT6FAO|4.0|I really enjoyed this second solo album by Dave Gahan. I think it is a mistake to compare this album w/ anything done by DM. It would be like comparing Martin's solo works (last I recall, were all covers) w/ DM. I can't speak to production/over-production as I am not in that business to understand it but I know what sounds good to my ears and this album sounds fantastic. I do not own Paper Monsters but am more interested in acquiring the album after Hourglass. Also, I think Dave's voice sounds some of the best he has sounded on this album; hearing his voice makes my soul smile.
032147404X|5.0|The tips Scott provides in the first few chapters alone make this book worth it.  I can't wait to read Volume 2.
B000TKW3E2|5.0|\\"Atonement\\" is hands-down the best original film score of 2007. Dario Marianelli composed intense, dramatic, passionate music to enhance this amazing movie. This CD is an incredible collection of edgy classical music. All of the tracks blend together seamlessly, and there isn't a single bad song on this album. My personal favorites include \\"Briony,\\" \\"With My Own Eyes,\\" and \\"Come Back,\\" which incorporate clicking typewriter keys into the music for an amazing effect. Other noteworthy tracks include \\"Love Letters,\\" a sweeping romantic piano melody, and \\"The Half Killed,\\" which is chilling and dramatic. This is a fantastic score, and if you are a fan of the film \\"Atonement\\" or are just looking for some great music to enjoy, you should definitely purchase this CD.
B0012EM5D8|4.0|I loved this movie. I saw it at the theaters and I knew I had to buy it when it comes out on DVD! I can't wait. ONE more week to go!
B0011FXLCC|5.0|Goldfrapp never ceases to amaze me. Every album they release is drastically different from the last, and yet every effort from this band is superb. \\"Seventh Tree\\" is no exception. I think this CD marks the most dramatic shift in tempo and style for Goldfrapp, at least since \\"Felt Mountain.\\" Gone are the days of crazy electronic synthesizers and intense dance beats. \\"Seventh Tree\\" is comprised of ten warm and mellow tracks that are perfect if you're in the mood to listen to something soothing and relaxing.<br /><br />All of the tracks on the CD flow very well together. I especially like \\"Little Bird\\" (which, oddly enough, sounds like a John Lennon cover); \\"Happiness,\\" a slightly more upbeat song with a hint of electronica; \\"Road to Somewhere,\\" a fabulous driving song; \\"A&E,\\" an upbeat yet mellow track; \\"Cologne Cerrone Houdini,\\" one of the band's trademark breathy and seductive numbers; and \\"Caravan Girl,\\" the most energetic tune on the album. Truly, though, there are no bad songs on this CD. Goldfrapp is fabulous and flawless, as always.<br /><br />Also, be sure to shell out the extra couple of dollars for the deluxe version of this CD. It comes packaged in a textured cardboard box and includes a separate DVD with a short documentary film and music video, a poster, several postcards, and a tiny lyric book with awesome illustrations. Very cool indeed.
B000KRN67C|5.0|The return of whom I hold as the most underrated band inside the metal landscape. Rotting Christ exhibit the originality in composition that I crave...making black metal more than just demonic vocals and cascading background keyboards. Frontman/songwriter Sakis continues to draw upon the blood-drenched catacombs of Perdition's flaming pit, but does so with an evil elegance missing from most metal of the genre. The choral introductions and spoken incantations are there of course, but so are the unpredictable arrangements and head-banging riff guitars that inspire a fist-pumping plunge into momentary psychosis. Don't be fooled by the band's name, what you'll find inside is a melodic expanse of forceful, guitar driven malady overlaid with soulful drumming and tons of ancillary enhancement. There is not a weak song on this album...it bleeds with intensity and for that reason is a constant companion while I dredge through many a work day with the rest of the drones. 10 out of 10 Best Cut: He, The Aethyr
0618680004|3.0|Take it for what it is: Dawkins is a scientist, committed wholly to material reductionism, not a philosopher. Taking nothing away from his power as a scientist, he is a popularizer who in the past had refused to debate academic Christians on the issue of God.  In fact, a debate offer was issued to him recently, in which he would be debating a top Christian academic at Oxford. He roundly refused, stating unless the person be a \\"bishop\\" he wasn't interested in padding anyone's resume...obviously statements like this show how little he understands the issues or knows the players actively writing the history he claims to be a part of.      So when Dawkins, making scientific observations, decides to weigh in on the question of God, we must ask ourselves what qualifies him to do so. Clearly stated, naturalism says \\"we CAN explain processes in the world without positing God as their cause.\\" However, it does NOT follow that God cannot be a necessary cause, but somehow Dawkins concludes time and again that because naturalism explains natural processes, God must not exist.     It's equivalent to saying because I see a car with it's front fender smashed on the side of the road and I recognize that the roads are icy and unsafe that this is the most probable cause. It could very well be driver error or an animal that ran out in the car's path that caused the driver to swerve and lose control. The former bears no greater sense of probability than the two latter explanations (it's what philosopher's might term \\"background probability\\"). But because the immediate evidence points to icy roads, we draw upon the reservoir of evidence before us. Once we consider we're in a wooded area, or the driver was drinking a hot coffee, then all bets our off. But Dawkins likes his roads icy.     It's clear he's not familar with the literature. He is completely unaware of Alvin Plantinga who is a tour de force in the ontological argument for the existence of God, who also wrote a powerful critiqueof Dawkin's arguments. Instead, he continually devolves into sardonic mockery. The question of God's existence is so pointless to Dawkins that it begs serious consideration. But this is only an affront for Dawkin's own ignorance of other prominent thinkers who do indeed read all the literature (even those they oppose) and understand that the question of God is a philosophical one.     Science, if called to question on the grounds of its own premises that naturalism need not posit God as an explanation, must also learn that naturalism CANNOT conclude that God does not exist, for it's wholly outside the scope and its ability to reach such a conclusion.
0452289963|5.0|Deeply thoughtful, difficult to read at times, circular thought writing style sometimes, confusing.  Very good when studied.   Invocative & creative in its ability to create thoughtful interpersonal change!
B0000DJZ8R|3.0|This is a very moving, touching movie that ages very well.  The issues covered here like perseverence against great odds, family values, corrupt police and government officials and social divide are still so relevant today.  I've not read the book but this movie has made me want to go to the library and borrow it.  The movie is more than 2 hours long and yet it's so good that you don't feel it as the Joad family makes its long journey cross country from Oklahoma to California looking for a way to survive from day to day.  The acting was superb and so was the directing but the only thing I didn't like was this DVD version.  The sound quality was average and despite the visual restoration, there were still many imperfections.  Perhaps a Blu-Ray version with better sound and visual quality will be soon released.  I enjoyed the special features on the flip side of the disc which had reel-life (pun intended) news clips from the actual reports of the great drought of the 1930s and especially the Biography of Darryl F. Zannuck which was very good.<br /><br />Contentwise, this is an excellent movie but this DVD version can be improved soundwise and picturewise.
1881273156|1.0|If I'd known this book would be so strewn with bible passages I definitely wouldn't have purchased it. I think it could have been written secularly, to reach out to a wider audience, but Chapman wanted to make certain that we know, without a doubt, what his religious beliefs are. Is his Christianity relevant to anything he has to say in the book? Nope. But he wants you to be aware, just in case, you know... one of his thoughtful bible passages causes you to lose all ability to think clearly and you decide to hand your life over to Jebus.    I really don't like Jesus sprinkled in with my self-help. Maybe loads of other people do, as is made clear by the glowing reviews, but referencing Jesus in a (pseudo) psychology book makes about as much sense as referencing a magical talking stump. Keep your talking stumps to yourself, Chapman. Otherwise people like me will pick up your book, and instead of being converted to Christianity (like I'm certain you're sincerely praying we'll all be), we'll sigh deeply and feel like the money spent on this book would have been better used for an adult magazine.    That all being said, even without the Old Man in the Sky and the Bloody Prophet, this book wouldn't have been much better. There's little useful psychology or anthropology in this volume and even fewer original ideas. The idea of the \\"love tank\\" is cliche and comical. People like it when you're kind to them in a way that makes sense to them? If you feel good about yourself you'll be a kinder person? Truly clever and inspiring!    Sir, I would NOT like a side of Jesus with my platter of triteness.     This book = Excellent for Christians with willfully undeveloped critical thinking skills. Not so hot for anyone else, my friends.    UPDATE: After several months of consideration, I wish I could give this book an even more negative review. Seriously. I found it in my closet the other day and realized that I dislike it too much to even donate it.
B000ZLFALS|5.0|The unrelenting emotional tone of the somewhat nonsensical plot makes this treasured movie imminently re-watchable.    The astounding singing of the Beatle's tunes, often done without instrumental accompaniment, by a fantastic cast of multi-cultural singers is pure perfection.    What makes this movie best of all are the wonderful choices of color palettes by an inspired set decorator and cinematographer, which should blow you away on your blu-ray and HD.    Banal or sixties themed and down to earth, this is a renaissance master's painting set to song and film.
B000YY67FO|5.0|FOR THOSE OF YOU THAT HAVE THE 96 REMASTER OR THE MFSL. HAVE BOTH YOU NOTICE THE DIFFERENCE IN SOUND. THE MFSL BRINGS OUT THE DEEP CLEAR VERSION OF THE ALBUM AND THE 96 REMASTER BRINGS OUT THE CLEAR CRISP VERSION OF THE ALBUM. THE ONE ON REVIEW IS THE SHM VERSION ON PLASTIC DISC. EVEN THOUGH I DO NOT HAVE THIS CD. IM SURE THERE IS NOT MUCH DETAIL MISSING AS THE OTHER 2 VERSIONS OUT THERE. SO I THINK THIS WOULD BE A WAISTE OF MONEY TO GET THIS ONE. THATS MY OPINION.
1593082479|4.0|Originally written for Stevenson's young American stepson, TREASURE ISLAND is a lighter read and less mature than his other works.  Still, it is a highly entertaining, fast-paced novel that certainly deserves its status as a classic in English literature.  Being perhaps the most influential book on the pirate mythos, this is one that you'll find familiar even if you've never read it before.  From the one-legged Long John Silver and his motley band of scoundrels to treasure maps where 'X' marks the spot, this is the book that helped shape 'gentlemen of fortune' in many books and stories since then.<br /><br />Jim Hawkins, the young hero of the story, is the principle narrator, telling the story of his adventure in a rather breathless manner.  Sometimes obscure details are described while traumatic scenes are sort of glossed over.  In this way, the story really takes on a realistic feel, as Jim tells his story the way he remembers it.  Unquestionably brave, Jim doesn't gloat on his accomplishments and victories, but relates the story in a modest way, hardly hesitating to describe his fear and admit his weaknesses.<br /><br />The other characters really drive the story.  Long John Silver and all the pirates are some of the most colorful characters you'll ever find.  Rough, deceitful, and hard, their motivations are never difficult to discern.  Their sometimes hilarious manner of speaking displays their character and brings them to life like no amount of purely descriptive writing could.  Jim Hawkins' friends are much less interesting as characters, but are nonetheless important.  The squire, the doctor, and their men play key parts in the tale but are never really the focus of readers' attention.  To be honest, compared to the other characters, they are rather dull.<br /><br />Robert Louis Stevenson's first published work is highly entertaining, but somewhat less mature than his other work.
B000092ZYX|5.0|I know this isnt one of their most popular albums but I think its their best especially after putting the songs in a different sequence. Try listening to this album in the following order:    Sit down stand up  There there  Go to sleep  2+2=5  Scatterbrain  Where I end and you begin  Sail to the moon  The gloaming  Myxamatosis  A punch up at a wedding  I will  We suck young blood  A wolf at the door  Backdrifts    I think with the songs in this order, this becomes the best radiohead album
B00004RF97|3.0|This movie is entertaining and is miles better than say \\"His Girl Friday\\" but it's not all that great.  I found that it was a tad too long and I had to catch myself from yawning at times although I thought the screenplay was very good as well as the acting.  The jokes don't age very well and so I chose to focus on the side of the story about Tracy's eventual acceptance that her perfectionist ways are what's turning people away from her and how her character changes throughout the movie to climax in her final choice of husband.  I thought Hepburn's acting was the best and most convincing of all while the chemistry among she, Stewart and Grant was very good.  Overall a nice feelgood movie with an interesting storyline but certainly not a good comedy with today's audience.<br /><br />This DVD though is a bit of a disappointment as the sound quality is Digital Mono although with a Dolby Pro Logic system you can simulate surround sound to a certain extent and the picture quality isn't very good.  Perhaps it would be a good idea to wait for a properly restored version perhaps Blu-Ray to surface and to give this version a miss.
B00003E43Q|4.0|This is a soundtrack to the documentary \\"Elvis That's the Way It Is.\\" The album was a modest hit when it was released in 1970 peaking at 21 on the US album chart (number 8 on the US Country chart) and 12 in the UK. It would be certified GOLD by the RIAA. The documentary covered Elvis' concerts in Las Vegas. It includes both live recordings from the show and \\"studio rehearsal\\" recordings. It includes the US hit single \\"You Don't Have to Say You Love Me\\" and the UK hit single \\"I Just Can't Help Believin'\\". While it is a little lite on the number of songs included (it is just a reissue of the LP) it is still an excellent collection and a must for Elvis fans. Elvis is in top form for these recordings.
B000HWZ5W4|5.0|I am not a fan of Led Zeppelin. I am a fan of most of Robert Plant's solo catalog. PRINCIPLE OF MOMENTS, FATE OF NATIONS, DREAMLAND and NOW & ZEN are my favorites, in that order. I also like PICTURES AT ELEVEN, SHAKIN N' STIRRED and MIGHTY REARRANGER (I detest MANIC NIRVANA.)    I harbored tremendous hope for the remastered versions of his extensive collection - so I coughed up 80 dollars for the box set.    The sound quality of my favorite album is significantly improved (the original CD actually had very good sound quality to begin with) but the bonus tracks left a bit to be desired.     BIG LOG, THRU WITH THE TWO STEP, STRANGER HERE THAN OVER THERE, OTHER AMRS, IN THE MOOD and MESSING WITH THE MEKON, all are remarkable songs with their esoteric lyrics, layered instrumentation and astoundingly passionate vocals. When Robert Plant sings with his enchanting lower ranges, his screaming high notes punctuate and accentuate the evocation of the tunes. When he just screams out with his Led Zepellin rebellion, his songs sound silly and immature. PRINCIPLE OF MOMENTS exemplifies the fore and never delves into the aft. This is truly a brilliant work of art.    The studio track is very nice. The live tracks range from deplorable to acceptable. The first sounds like an audience member recorded it with a portable cassette player while standing moving through the crowd.     Basically, the short of it is, in my opinion this album is a very nice upgrade over the original masterpiece... but can a masterpiece truly be improved upon?
B000MV8ABS|5.0|I like so much the atmosphere of this movie. It is not a movie for everybody because it is movie weird movie. But if you are open, you will enjoy this movie I tell you!!
0385341067|4.0|Upon first glance, this novel wasn't something that caught my attention.  However, after I began to read it, I realized that there was much to learn from this book.  The story is concerned with the tale of a young teenage girl name Matilda, who was living in Papua New Guinea.  Now this in itself isn't entirely interesting, but throw in a bloody civil war between the islanders and the government, and you've got yourself a decent setting for a story.      While the novel does center around this civil war, it focuses greater detail on events that have occurred as a result of the war, such as the closing of Matilda's school.  So, not only do these children have to live in a country going through a war, they're also denied their education. Whatever will they do? Enter Mr. Watts.  Sure, he goes by \\"Pop Eye\\" and wears a red clown nose, but we won't get into that.  What is more important is that Pop Eye decides to take on these students' education himself, through the use of the novel \\"Great Expectations.\\"  By reading a chapter each day to these students, he works to continue helping them learn, despite the closure of their school.  What is surprising as well as intriguing about this is that the students are actually interested, and want to hear this book read to them.  In a world that is becoming more focused on technology and less concerned with reading or literature, it is promising to see that these students have found solace in a book.  Through all of the events that are happening in their lives, it is inspirational to see literature being in this method.

B00003E43P|5.0|After years of recording mediocre soundtracks, this was Elvis' long-overdue return to making real music. And what a return it was! In a rare smart move, Elvis' management loosened their reigns on him setting him up to work with Chips Moman at Memphis' American Sound Studios to produce this album. The new environment and material seemed to refresh Elvis' creative spirit and he delivered some of the best performances of his career! The majority of the album has a strong R&B flavor, with some country thrown in for good measure and includes the hit \\"In The Ghetto\\". The album reached number 13 on the US Billboard album chart and was certified GOLD by the RIAA, however it was a bigger hit internationally reaching number 1 in the UK.  While this is a solid release, I would recommend you buy the US release instead.  It has 6 bonus tracks not included on this release.<br /><br />Inexplicably, after the success of these recordings Elvis would never work with Chips Moman again nor be given this amount of creative freedom and quality material.
B000P12LWY|5.0|I recently caught the show OnDemand from my cable company as a free preview of the Showtime channel.  I had heard about the show and wasn't expecting much.  So I watched the entire first season in two days and have to say I much approved.  It was no where near historically accurate.     Inconsistencies - the timeline is way off, Henry VIII had two sisters and neither of them married the King of Portugal (however his younger sister married the King of France and his older sister married the King of Scots) and as far as history is concerned neither of them committed murder.  The makeup and hair in the show are also not very accurate.  However the costumes and jewels seem to be with historical portraits.    The cast is wonderful and give fantastic portrayals of the characters though.  And I applaud Showtime for choosing women more accurate to the period.  All in all I understand this show is for entertainment and if separated from the actual history then I can do nothing but give it 5 stars.

0790734850|5.0|This latter-day descendant of film noir may be the most perfect movie to come out of Hollywood in my lifetime. Great story, excellent cast, show-stealing performance by a then little known Russell Crowe, classy soundtrack, violence that still manages to shock jaded modern sensibilities, and above all enough twists and turns in the masterful plot to surprise the innocent and smug alike. A fabulous achievement in filmmaking, and a rare example of a movie that is every bit as downright good as it is monumentally great. I could see LA Confidential fifty more times and never grow tired of it.

B000B9J4EI|5.0|My husband is a Richard Matheson fanatic and when I said I wanted to see the Will Smith movie of the same title, he told me to read the book instead. So I read his tattered 40-cent Bantam paperback and now I won't see the movie. They can't do it justice (besides Will Smith is not a blonde of German descent). Richard Matheson is a master storyteller, I could not put this book down. With his words I could feel the suffocation that Robert Neville felt being alone all the time, fighting for his life. He drank a lot but still managed to be very productive and never feel sorry for himself. He was a hunter, doctor, scientist, judge, jury and executioner. He somehow avoided the infection that killed or mutated everyone else, but then that became his downfall because the others saw him as the danger. The ending is incredible, Robert Neville becomes legend. This book is a must-have for any sci-fi or suspense fan.
0307387178|1.0|I had to read this book for Freshmen orientation... and I was so bored with the book. And I never got bored of books hell I'd read the same books over and over and never gotten bored. The book to me was clinical and lacked personality. If I'm having to read a book that's biographical I have to feel more for the character than boredom and annoyance. I think the only time I've touched that book since 1999 was each time I've had to pack up and move. For all of you who have read it and loved it good for you... maybe I'm just one of the few who didn't like it.
B0011FDVKE|5.0|Tift Merritt's newest release, \\"Another Country,\\" is a truly beautiful work of art. Lyrics, vocals, and overall thematic content come together in a way that makes this the finest and most moving of her three wonderful solo efforts. Of particular note are the title track, \\"Another Country,\\" \\"Hopes Too High,\\" and the complicated and delicate \\"Keep You Happy.\\" I saw Ms. Merritt perform at Housing Works, NYC, in November, and, remarkably, this album captures and conveys the intimacy, strength, charm, humor, and poignancy of her live performance. Buy it!
032147404X|1.0|This book and its companion (vol. 2) are terrific and have given me great ideas, however, the quality of this book is pretty poor. I am not sure if it is just my copy or others are similarly affected. Mine has pages falling out and sections coming apart from the binding.   It is just over my 30 day return limit for Amazon, so I am screwed I guess.   If you buy this book MAKE SURE your pages are intact and don't start falling out.   Steve
0792163710|5.0|Shane is for me the greatest western film of all time. It has much emotional depth, and stands as a great work of art. Alan Ladd, in my opinion, is perfect in the role (regardless of his size). Shane's nobility of character in spite of hard circumstances is a marvel, making him one of the most memorable characters ever on film. The music (which is always an important part of any movie) is also very good, capturing the whole feel of the movie from the more wistful scenes to the more violent scenes. The movie also has some very interesting realistic moments for a movie made in its time such as the little girl's behaviour during the funeral of the one sod buster that was killed by Jack Palance.    The movie has a quiet yet stirring quality rarely found in other movies both in the western or other genres. Not only is the central character very well played, but the direction is also superb. Every detail of the movie was carefully thought out. Compare this movie with a couple of the other highest acclaimed westerns. High Noon had a great start in the movie, but by two-third's of the way through, the central plot had become somewhat overdone, and even the inevitable climactic gunfight didn't offer any real surprise in its action sequences to the modern viewer. The Searchers had an interesting central character in John Wayne's Ethan, who is the real highlight of the film, but the story meanders somewhat between the subplots, and the quick reversal of Natalie Wood's attitude towards the two Searchers at the end is clearly underdeveloped. But Shane is in a different league, being brilliantly thought-out and executed from beginning to end with no filler. It is an absolute masterpiece.
B000I5XOW8|1.0|First, Night scenes, the video is bleeding and spots are everywhere almost like VHS tape.  Day scenes are pretty good but not sharp enough to say wow it's blu-ray!  Most of all worst then previously released normal DVDs.    Sound. Also is the worst. Don't say that because this movie is old. Think about the movie 'Blade runner'.    This doesn't has true HD Sound or PCM uncompressed Dolby Digital 5.1.    I don't know why I bought this after reading other peoples' comments in this website.    Trust me, just don't waste your money.
B000002OX7|5.0|Why is it, after thirty years of listening to this album I'm still moved by its power and structure. Granted it isn't Baba O' Riley or Won't Get Fooled Again that touch me as much anymore; I'm now more likely to find meaning in My Wife or Behind Blue eyes, but this speaks to the depth and breadth of the albums thematic elements. Who's Next is an invitation to look closely at the world and your place in it, and it does so within the strict confines of the rock genre. The fact that it reaches so high and hits the mark it is aiming for makes Who's Next a major work of art.     Who's Next moves from anthems for revolution to odes of exhaustion effortlessly, which is likely why it still has an appeal for me. When I was younger I didn't understand why Who's Next was peppered with introspection, after all revolution is about the physical manifestation of an idea, not the creation of the idea itself. Only now, years later, do I see that Peter Townsend was talking about revolution of a different sort. Now when the rousing cords of the power anthems end and the acoustic mid-tempo pieces begin instead of skipping forward, I listen and I'm stirred into a different kind of consideration of who I am and what purpose I have in the world, as middling as that purpose might be. Thanks Pete. Won't Get Fooled Again indeed.
B00004TS0E|5.0|I felt this remake of \\"Miracle\\" brought it into the modern world.  While I loved Natalie Wood in the original version, this little girl has a personality all her own that fits the movie well.     I also thought the adults in the film were actually better than in the original -- except for maybe the guy who played Santa!
B0012GMVDK|5.0|The songs on 1992's The Future fall into two broad categories: The Politico-prophetic (The Future, Democracy, Anthem) & the personal, covering a wide spectrum of emotion from love to disillusionment, that resonate with the first category in certain respects. The concluding instrumental Tacoma Trailer recapitulates and unifies both themes.<br /><br />The apocalyptic title track contains oblique references to psychological disintegration and overt ones to the unraveling of long-standing alliances and to global wars. The underlying idea is one of bewilderment: \\"They said repent\\" but exactly what was meant? The marching beat signals the irony of the title Democracy, a tour de force with a lovely undulating rhythm and gripping lyrics that mention the [[ASIN:0060628626 The Sermon on the Mount]]. Jennifer Warnes is amongst the backing vocalists; this song has been covered by [[ASIN:B0002M5TE8 Judy Collins]] on her tribute album of the same name.<br /><br />The solemn Anthem with its graceful rhythmic motion and choral vocals contains the comforting lines: \\"There is a crack in everything/That's how the light gets in,\\" a concept which is extensively examined in the Zohar and Kabbalistic literature in general. The following words have the ring of prophecy: \\"I can run no more with that lawless crowd/while the killers in high places/say their prayers out loud\\". Chilling. The Future and Anthem are covered on the soundtrack tribute [[ASIN:B000G73UEU Leonard Cohen: I'm Your Man]].<br /><br />Co-written with Sharon Robinson, Waiting for the Miracle is an understated, slow song with backing vocals by [[ASIN:B00005K8SO Anjani Thomas]] whilst Steve Lindsay produced & arranged the soulful cover of [[ASIN:B00005TNQ8 Frederick Knight's]]  Be For Real with its lovely organ touches.

Billy Joel does a surprisingly sensitive rendition on the tribute album [[ASIN:B000001EZK Tower of Song]]. The penultimate track Always is in the R&B tradition with soulful, even funky female vocals & snatches of conversation in the background.<br /><br />The album closes with the atmospheric Tacoma Trailer, an instrumental where bass and synclavier recreate the interaction of Cohen's and the female vocals, creating a forlorn landscape of loss and melancholia to devastating effect. As Cohen's sole album of new material in the 1990s, The Future was a worthy follow-up to 1988's [[ASIN:B0002L30C2 I'm Your Man]], continues some of the themes on 1984's [[ASIN:B0012GMW7A Various Positions]] and remains a masterpiece of poetry in song.WY Jennifer Warnes]] arranged and performed backing vocals on Light As The Breeze which must rate as one of Cohen's most sublime love songs, superbly integrating spiritual and romantic imagery.

0307276902|2.0|[...] it's just not a quality read. The protagonist was not admirable at all to me, but seems to have been created to be sympathized with. However, his stubbornness and hostility towards well-meaning people made him as unlikeable as could be in my eyes. The style of the novel also seems to be pretentious, as if James Frey were attempting to be avant-garde in ignoring conventional punctuation and paragraph structure. His over usage of the letter \\"I\\" not only added to the selfishness of his narrator, but it also degraded the style of the novel. Though there are good points in the story and some noteworthy things that he does with the rehab experience that most people wouldn't otherwise witness, I wouldn't say this is a classic by any means. Frey has a way to go before he hits anything near that mark.    But if you're all plot, then maybe this is a good read for you.

B000YIGNKE|1.0|Where to start? First, the case arrived cracked (damaged in shipping) so I opened the plastic to survey the damage and found a big crack down the inside of it. Well, I decided to give it one more shot and go with a three strikes your out basis and it struck out! This movie sucked! I could barely stay awake through the boring and uneventful dialouge, the way it dragged through each scene like a snail and whoever complained about her running through the streets at the end being the only bad part was crazy. This whole movie was slow, poorly casted and all-in-all a complete flop. Have you not seen Pride and Prejudice? Becoming Jane? The Inheritance? Anything but this...!
B000FP2OPY|5.0|Supernatural is a show that has even the biggest skeptics sitting on the edge of their seats in suspense.<br />As a skeptic myself at first i only expected a half-decent 2 star season only watched to kill time. Especially with all the cheesy sci-fi shows out there, needless to say i was hesitant to buy...... boy was i wrong.<br /><br />Whoever decided upon two brothers partaking in the long road trip that is their life is a smart man. I must also give Eric Kripke props for his immaculate work over the years. He doesn't just film whatever makes him the most money. Although the people love this show, its NOT because he makes it fit their interests. He takes urban legends ands only presents the truth so to speak. He doesn't change them up and make it a \\"hollywood\\" version.<br />He simply portrays the supernatural as best as possible and leaves further interpretation up to the individual. This is why so many lives are touched by this show.<br /><br />It helps you make up your mind what you believe- or Dont believe. Alot of the stuff is so close to christianity's beliefs it leaves one speechless.<br />At first one says \\"Well its only sci-fi\\" but it doesn't take a genius to figure out some of the stuff goes on today.<br />I can't say enough about the plot in this series exept to say that it is incredible and only gets better and better. Great job writers!<br />The acting is so real we forget everything and feel as if we are right there. It portrays family values and how far they will go to protect their family AND everybody else.<br />Don't get me wrong- morality is not lost in this series.<br />It will leave your mind thinking and your heart touched.<br /><br />I promise once you watch it- you'll be coming back for more and more!<br />I recommend buying season 1 and season 2 of SUPERNATURAL.

B00136NX68|5.0|I loved Memoirs of a Geisha the book, and loved Memoirs of a Geisha the movie just as much. I am happy to say that the soundtrack has lived up to my expectations. At this point I cannot even choose a favorite, between the moving elegance of Sayuri's theme and Sayuri's Theme/End Credits and the carefully poignant Chairman's Waltz. I don't normally buy movie soundtracks, let alone the entire album - but this one I *had* to have. Love it!

B0011HOEY4|5.0|While there is a real grit to this film, it is never sensationalistic and does not glorify crime.  This is the story of two real life people, Frank Lucas and Richie Roberts.  Frank Lucas grew up in North Carolina and fled to New York to avoid trouble with the law.  On the streets of Harlem he became the right hand man of a gangster who ruled Harlem under the Italian mafia, Bumpy Johnson.  After Bumpy died, Frank rethought his position in life and what he wanted to do about it.<br /><br />What he decided to do was become the main supplier of Heroin in New York and New Jersey.  He hatched a scheme to go to Vietnam and Thailand and from there into the mountain jungles to buy uncut heroin direct and cut out all the middlemen in the drug trade.  How he got it back to the states is one of the interesting plot points of the movie and if you were alive during those years you probably remember the news stories after he got busted.<br /><br />Along the way, he brings his family up from North Carolina and they build their own drug business that is so effective (the Blue Magic brand heroin they sell is twice as potent at half the price) that the Mafia works out a deal to buy wholesale from him!  Yes, he is ruthless.  Yes, we see the squalor of what his drugs do to people.  Yes, we see the degradation of the women who work to cut and package his dope and have to work naked so they can't steal anything.  We briefly see the brothels, but the way they are shown nothing could be less sexy.  It is all just so sad and filthy.  Unlike the Godfather films, this movie doesn't try to pretend there is nobility and doesn't separate us from where Frank's millions come from.  However, Frank separates himself.  We see scenes of him at Church with his mother, of them holding hands and praying around their Thanksgiving Day meal, and so on.  Frank views himself as just another business man moving a commodity that people want and are going to buy with or without him.  So, he rationalizes, why not cash in.<br /><br />Pursuing Frank is Detective Richie Roberts.  Remember, this was the time of the movie \\"Prince of the City\\" and the police force was notoriously corrupt.  This was especially true of the drug squads.  Richie will not take.  He just wants to be an honest cop and this confuses and enrages the crooked cops, but gets him on a team trying to actually go after the big drug dealers.  The death of his former partner who got into heroin gives him a lead to the Blue Magic brand.  You see, the junkies weren't used to the stuff being so potent and there were many deaths from it.  The movie's main plot is how Richie learns about Frank and finally brings him down.  A nice twist in the film that was also a part of real life is that Richie was also going to law school and passed the bar.  So, when it came time to prosecute Frank, Richie did it.<br /><br />The extras disk has a feature that shows the real Richie and Frank and how they are still friends today.  Richie eventually became a defense attorney and worked to defend Frank and get him out of jail after serving 15 years instead of the 70 he was sentenced to.<br /><br />An interesting and honest film that I found quite compelling.  Frank is played by Denzel Washington and Richie is played by Russell Crowe.  They both do superb work.rsuing Frank is Detective Richie Roberts.

B000UR9QIK|5.0|One of the greatest horror films of all time, director George A. Romero's masterpiece gets the high def treatment.  Anchor bay has given the film every other kind of treatment as well, maybe not as much as the Evil dead series though.  For a film like this I really don't mind double dipping.  If your looking for extra features I'd go with the Ultimate edition which contains the U.S theatrical version, extended version, European version, and a ton of extras.  If you want the most pristine transfer go with this blu ray version.  I'd suggest both, and this blu ray title is reasonably priced when compared to other titles.  Another thing I've found with blu ray titles is to buy them online via Amazon or other sites, the prices in the store are even more ridiculous.    Most are familiar with the story's plot, zombies are taking over and we follow four survivors in there helicopter to the mall where they try to adapt and make a life for themselves.  Besides being a freaky horror film with real scares and gore it's writer/director George A. Romero using satire to make a statement in 1978 about American consumerism, people die , turn into zombies and are drawn to the mall to subconsciously walk with there zombie strut with their blank facial expressions, ready to \\"consume\\".
6304698682|5.0|Hull Barret (Michael Morairty) is the defacto leader of a group of pan miners dreaming of finding their big nuggets of gold on their tiny stakes.  But the powerful Coy LaHood (Richard Dysart) wants to run them off their claims so he can seize them and use his powerful hydraulic mining techniques to get at the gold he is sure is there.  His son, Josh (Christopher Penn), runs the day to day operations and uses some of his workers to harass and injure the pan miners so they will give up and move away.<br /><br />When Hull takes a risky trip into town to get supplies, some of the LaHood thugs beat him and start to set fire to his wagon, but in comes a stranger that we come to know only as the Preacher (Clint Eastwood) he shows the thugs how to really use a good piece of hickory (an ax handle).  The Preacher seems to be interested in helping the pan miners to pull together, find the strength they don't even know they have and stand up for themselves.  Yet, he also negotiates a good deal for the pan miners to sell their claims.  They reject the offer, in part because they believe the Preacher will fight with (for) them.  However, the Preacher disappears.  Their courage fails them.<br /><br />How all this works out isn't hard to guess, but I will let you watch the film for yourself.  There is also a rather uncomfortable love complication with the widow, Sarah Wheeler (Carrie Snodgrass) who is supposedly Hull's woman (they are just living together).  She is obviously taken with the strong Preacher over the merely normal Hull.  Sarah's daughter Megan (Sydney Penny) has also fallen head over heels for the Preacher and throws herself at him in an acutely painful scene.  Again, you can see for yourself how this works out.<br /><br />There are some memorably funny scenes.  For example, The 7' 2\\" Richard Kiel plays a LaHood henchman named Club who is sent to intimidate the miners.  He approaches the Preacher and Hull who are hammering hard on a boulder that Hull believes is hiding a big nugget of gold.  Each blow removes a handful or rock and it will be slow going, but Club takes one of the sledgehammers and splits the boulder with one blow.  After the Preacher dispatches with him (to Club's profound respect) attention returns to the boulder.  The Preacher adds to his mystic nature (one thread of the story says he is dead) by also splitting the boulder with one blow.<br /><br />This is a good movie and very much worth seeing.  The performances are all good and the story, for all its Western conventions, has some fresh takes and an interesting story.  I particularly liked its positive themes rather than the usual post-Western-Western bleakness.  Yes, some of the special effects and props are a bit weak, but who cares.  The movie is about the story rather than the visuals.<br /><br />Reviewed by Craig Matteson, Ann Arbor, MI.

B00005KB9X|4.0|Not having heard any of Marley's other albums in their original sequence, I can't comment on how this stands up to \\"Uprising\\" or \\"Burnin,\\" but none of the songs which haven't made it to a greatest hits compilation is especially remarkable.  The studio version of \\"No Woman, No Cry\\" is jarring at first, but that's only because the live version is so good.  The cut here is no less satisfying after one begins to anticipate the quicker tempo.  All in all, there are no duds, but there also is never much of a crescendo of emotion or a very dramatic change of groove.  In any case, it's a satisfying collection of pop-oriented reggae singles.
B000ZLFALI|5.0|When I saw \\"Across the Universe\\" on the big screen, I said to the friend I saw it with \\"It's perfect.\\" After six more viewings in theaters and about twenty on DVD, my opinion has not changed. First, I love the Beatles' music, and Taymor lets the music tell the story. Second, the performers are recorded on set, not lipsync'd; the difference is subtle but important -- emotions are experienced directly. Third, the young actors are terrific, especially Evan Rachel Wood, whose expressions are so transparent I feel I am seeing directly into Lucy's soul -- especially the final shot, which gives new meaning to \\"Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds.\\" I also appreciate Taymor's use of Joe Cocker, Bono, and Eddie Izzard in cameos; they are also perfect. I am disappointed thet the film was not recognized with more nominations or awards, but I certainly hope Taymor will keep up the good work.

B000VBJEEG|5.0|I love films about the bliss of life, and food films fall in that category. But the film has to explore the reason why of it all as well. Ratatouille gave me everything I enjoy about food films and a bit more. Bliss is hard to find in a life time ~it just is. And if you find it, it usually comes wrapped in a package marked ~ Do it with all your heart! The characters in this animation reach with all their hearts ~ Even when they aren't completely sure what they're reaching for, they reach all the same. I place Ratatouille right up there with Babette's Feast. When you are born to cook, you are born to cook!
B000VI70X6|3.0|I think Shakira could learn from Celine Dion and Madonna as far as choreography and presentation. I was disappointed in the show for those reasons. I also hoped she would put closed captioning to all her songs because honestly sometimes her style of singing its hard to decipher what she said. Don't get me wrong I love her talent but I expect more pizazz from a concert especially with the prices today. That being said I think Shakira's live & off the record and Shakira MTV unplugged are both much better! And yes her hips still steal the show!
0307346617|4.0|World War Z is an \\"oral history\\" in the manner of a Studs Terkel book, interviewing survivors of a zombie plague that threatened to wreck civilization.  It's haunting, compelling, humorous, and elegiac in turn.  Most of all, it's an ultimately hopeful look at how people survive when the world is literally going to hell, and how civilization turns away from the brink of destruction and not only survives, but in the long run, improves itself.    The faux-journalistic nature of the book gives it a feeling of reality that's rare in fiction, let alone tales of zombie apocalypse!  The author cannily incorporates real-world political situations and extrapolates - sometimes chillingly, sometimes humorously - how various governments react to the spreading disaster.  The zombies themselves and the carnage they cause are kept largely in the background, as befits the past-tense, \\"as told to\\" narrative style.      Indeed, the world presented in this book is so well-imagined (and so many incidents alluded to only in passing)  that a sequel would be most welcome.  One thing I would like more of is examination of the zombies and the virus that causes them.  Surely the creatures were and are the subject of much research.  And what DID go on at China Lake?  Enquiring minds want to know, Mr. Brooks!
B00005JPAO|4.0|Really enjoyed this movie.  Thought the acting was superb, particularly the portrayal of the Queen.  I haven't the slightest idea what the Queen is like in reality, but Mirren portrays her about how I would imagine her to be.<br /><br />I remember clearly the day the news came across about Diana's death.  The follow-up global media coverage was impossible to ignore, thus I also followed that, though I don't remember much about the controversy surrounding the lack of a public position or statement from Buckingham Palace.  It was interesting to watch in this movie what was conceivably the private position taken by the British Royal Family regarding Diana's death, and, indeed, her life.  It all seemed very plausible.

0780631684|3.0|For a seven year old movie with TV-quality special effects, a fairly straight-forward plot, and skin-deep characters, I should have disliked this movie, but I didn't. It just works.<br /><br />The premise is that a bunch of friends escape their date with Death when one of them has a premonition the plane they are boarding for a class trip is going to explode after takeoff. Death is not so easily avoided though and commences a person-by-person manhunt, taking out each friend in the order they would have died on the plane. Simple idea, but compelling, as you wonder every time one of the characters plugs in a hairdryer, gets in a car, or shaves if Death will manipulate the situation to finally kill him/her. In fact, the true genius of this film is that ambiguity blended with very creative \\"accidental death\\" scenarios when the Grim Reaper does finally strike.<br /><br />Normally, I would have given this film 2 stars for all its flaws, but the ingenuity of the way it is executed pushed me to three. Worth renting. Not sure I'd buy though.
B0011NVC9I|2.0|This movie was visually awesome. Even in 2-D it was beautiful. The only drawback was the story, the voice acting, the story, Ray Winstone talking like William Shatner, and did I mention the story?     If you really want to see it, highjack an IMAX so you can see it in it's intended 3-D, smoke a bunch of pot or other hallucinogenic drug so you don't really focus on anything but the visual stimuli, or download it for free. Don't waste your money.
B000QUCNOU|5.0|This film is based on actual facts. A young couple park where it quiet. Some shots ring out, but they remain parked. A car parks near by, and more shots are fired. Someone calls the police to report it. A letter from the killer arrives at the 'San Francisco Chronicle'. [Those other newspapers are extinct.] The cartoonist studies the cipher. The Zodiac killer strikes in daylight. [Never let yourself be tied up.] Then a cabdriver is shot in San Francisco. Another letter arrives at the newspaper with an insane threat. [The film reminds us of the old technology in use then.] Books tell about ciphers and codes. Why would anyone trust a stranger on a dark road? Reporter Paul Avery uncovers an old murder in Riverside California. Then a tip names a suspect. The police look at him, but have a problem. The Zodiac killer strikes again.<br /><br />Robert Graysmith researches the libraries to learn who borrowed books on codes. He is allowed the privilege of reviewing police files, and finds a clue. An anonymous phone call brings a new clue. After years have passed a new Zodiac letter appears. Why does Robert need to do this? He follows another clue about a poster. Robert is obsessed about this case. He finds some facts that point to a cleared suspect - only \\"circumstantial evidence\\". Then a long sought witness is found and identifies a photo. But the passage of time prevents any further action.<br /><br />The film recreates the Bay Area of California in the early 1970s. It seems slightly over-long, but seems to cover this unsolved case dramatically. They had four different actors portray the Zodiac killer, as if they hedged their bet about a single killer. Note the different MOs, and the false claims for murders that were untrue. Copycat killings are possible.
B000F8O35U|4.0|Like many I enjoyed this movie as a kid and I still think of it as a good movie. However as an advisory to those who have kids I pass along this advice. This is one of the big animated disney films based on a literary classic that takes liberty with the ending. Disney knows that its primary audience loves the happy ending. It is my feeling that had disney told the actual story of the little mermaid then this film would not have been as popular.  When the mermaid becomes human it is a literally painful experience every step that she takes hurst and feels as if she is walking on needles. The mermaid also dies at the end of the book because the one she loves falls for someone else.      Now before any of you get on to me and think I'm bursting peoples enjoyment, I'm not. I enjoy this movie for what it is. Even though the ending is not the correct one I will say that disney does do a good job at keeping the overall story intact. The one thing that disney is going to take into consideration is that if it is going to do more animated movies on literary classics then they need to make sure that the ending is a happy one because that is what its audience on a regular basis expects the studio to deliver.
0618918248|1.0|Dawkins' writing on evolution is top notch.  In \\"The Selfish Gene\\" he does what other scientists are too impatient to do.  Most scientists see Evolution as so obvious while the theory itself is so mammoth and intricate in its evidence that they tend to abruptly dismiss skeptics.  But Dawkins takes the skeptic on a careful and readable defense of the theory.  Well done.    As for his recent attempt at amateur philosophy, as a Mathematician I can only compare his abysmal farce to some of the books I've read by journalists (without scientific background) writing about chaos theory or relativity.    When he is out of his element, Dawkins writes with a sloppy, uncareful voice.  If you are familiar with the style and approach of philosophy writers, you can find all the same topics here without the scrutiny or attention to rigor.  He also draws cavalierly on any speculations in theoretical physics (another subject in which he clearly has no background) that might help him out.    How this book received an average of 4 stars is beyond me (but then again, I can easily picture the majority of students in my undergraduate philosophy classes buying into his loose arguments).
B0009W5K0Y|5.0|From beginning to end the album is great.  Hayley's voice is fantastic and although the drumming and the guitar notes are very simple on this album they are still great and it works out for the best.    I personally liked this album much more than Riot.  I think they should have stayed a little more punk and a lot less pop...but that's just my opinion.  This is still pop-punk, but it still had a little edge to it.
B000002GQJ|3.0|Fair Work, but Somewhat Uninspiring, Compared to the Other 7 Original Moodies Albums.<br /><br />No really big hits, and quite a few misses...<br /><br />Believe it or not, my third favorite song from this album (after Question, and The Balance) is The Tortoise And The Hare.<br /><br />Great Album Cover, however :)<br /><br />My ranking of the Original Seven Moodies Albums is:<br />1) ISOTLC<br />2) SS<br />3) DOFP<br />4) TOCCC<br />5) OTTOAD<br />6) EGBDF<br />7) QOB<br /><br />with Octave ranking near QOB, and Long Distance Voyager ranking near TOCCC.
B000PTYPAC|4.0|First off let me just say that I've liked Paramore before they became mainstream and before MTV(the channel that never plays music)damaged them..some what.      Paramore's first album is much better than Riot, but this isn't a bad album at all.  Songs like: That's What You Get, When It Rains, Miracle, We Are Broken, and Born For This keep this album from being a bore.      Paramore still has a great sound, they just need to go back to their roots and tone down on the Pop.
0385493622|5.0|To start with a very brief summary: This is a great book! I do agree that a book on how a mathematical problem was solved sounds extremey boring, but this could not be further from the truth. The book is packed with fascinating stories from ancient time until today. (Did you know that Pythagoras killed a student who calimed that the square root of 2 could not be written as a fraction?).    I highly recommend this book, and the same goes for the other books by Simon Singh (Big Bang and The Code Book).
B000WMEAKC|3.0|The First four tracks on this album are great.  They are very touching and it leaves you expecting so much more than what is offered.  The production on the first four tracks are great from the guitar to the vocals to the bridges all the way down to the drums and even the base.  You're left wondering what happened to the rest of the album?  this CD starts off with deep songs and somewhere in the middle it starts sounding like a different band and towards the end you're left with songs that sound like they would have been on someone's first demo or some additional tracks that shouldn't have made the cut.      I'd say just for the first four tracks the album is worth it, but don't expect anything great after those tracks.
B0013V8OFI|1.0|I downloaded this because of rave reviews on this site. My wife and I did not laugh once. We watched about thirty minutes and then had to stop. It was painful to watch. We fast forwarded to the end to see the predictable outcome. It's too late for us, but save yourselves!!!!
B000R5N1MC|5.0|The good: Special features not seen in the DVD or Blu-Ray versions. Top quality of material. One of the best Sci-Fi movies of all time. Price for what you get.  The bad: HD DVD lost the war, so unless you take care of your HD DVD player or get combo players, eventually you will lose the ability to play it.

B000I2MRHE|1.0|I bought the Lamaze Spin & Explore for my daughtet, when it got to my home I opened it and set it up which was really easy. When it was all put together it didn't look like something I wanted to put my daughter on. I was afraid it was going to tip over. It didn't look like it would suppport her. If she wasn't on it just right it looked like it would tip over. I returned it.
0385338724|2.0|I've read all Kinsella's other books (started with Shopaholic series) and this one just didn't seem all THAT original.  The whole time I kept thinking 13 Going On 30 (except obviously amnesia not wishing dust).  I also feel like she used the F word a lot just to use it, not really necessary.  I still did read it in three days so I guess it wasn't awful, just not really great and very predictable.
B000A0GP4K|5.0|I loved this movie! So much information, put together in such an interesting way.  Martin Scorsese really gathered, and made, the perfect footage to tell about Bob Dylan's amazing life. And Dylan is a great interviewee. I was so entertained, I am just glad that it had two parts.
0143038419|5.0|When I received this book as a birthday present, I wasn't really sure what to expect from it.  Since I was in the middle of midterms and had a lot of studying to do, I had only planned on skimming over the first few pages to get a general idea of what the book was about.  However, once I started, I just couldn't put the book down.    The story is about a young woman in her mid-thirties, who seems to have everything this society deems so valuable and appropriate for a woman, a husband, a big house, a career, and a family-to-be, but who is utterly depressed despite all this.  During another night spent crying on the floor of her bathroom, she awakens to the fact that this life, this marriage, and a prospective pregnancy are not for her, and in the spur of the moment, she asks God for help.  The answer she gets is simple (\\"Go to bed, Liz\\"), but it also is the beginning of a long journey.  Liz decides to take the plunge and file for divorce.  What follows is an addictive relationship with Mr. Wrong, and the deep longing to find a connection to God while still enjoying life.  This longing sends her on a year-long journey, where she explores pure pleasure in Italy, spirituality and her deep connection to God in an ashram in India, and womanhood and love in Indonesia.    I think what I liked most about the book was the utter honesty with which Elizabeth Gilbert describes her journey with all her mishaps, bloopers, addictions, epiphanies and successes.  She neither tries to be politically correct, nor does she go into self-pity or cultural cliches.  She writes what she feels and how she perceives things without much sensoring, but in a very engaging, open and humorous style.   I am sure that many women can relate quite well to her description of her relationship to David, in which she continues to lose herself despite her obvious awareness of its toxicity.  I for sure can say that I've been there, and I found myself laughing out loud at the honesty with which she expressedher own foolishness.    Unlike many self-help books and spiritual books which promise that \\"their way\\" is the way to find yourself, and which very often also define the \\"yourself\\" for you,  Gilbert's book is a beautiful exploration of one person's journey without claiming to have found the answers to blissful living.  By writing about her journey almost in journal style, she gives you a glimpse into her personal path to a connected life.  By being blunt and honest in her descriptions, she enables the reader to connect to her, and this connection, at least for me, helped me gain some insights into my own life processes.      A good book to me is a book that takes me on an emotional journey, and Eat, Pray, Love surely did that:  I laughed, I cried, I fumed, and I questioned.  And now I'm waiting for the continuance of Gilbert's journey.
0743496736|5.0|Jodi Picoult is a damn good author. The way she puts together the allusions is outstanding. Quite simply, this is one of Picoult's best pieces. The storyline was engrossing. I couldn't stop reading and can definitely recommend this novel.
B000OYC3J8|2.0|I was a huge fan of \\"Elephant\\" and \\"Get Behind Me Satan.\\"  I have constantly defended these albums against those who criticize the White Stripes.  But this album left me feeling icky.  The first three songs were really good (especially \\"You Don't Know What Love Is...\\").  But after hearing those three songs, I was expecting even better songs to come.  Unfortunately, they did not.  Jack's signature guitar licks are great and his voice is awesome and Meg's constant drum pounding is...well, it is what it is.  However, the songs were mostly just odd with lyrics that felt freestyled and unimaginative.  The music is very, very bluesy but it doesn't really go anywhere.  This is nowhere near The Stripes best material.  If they made a best of album, only about 2 songs on here should be included.  Tracks six through nine were just terrible and needed to push the \\"next\\" button on.  I am so disappointed, but will not give up on the Stripes.  There is always next time.
B000PFUAO6|5.0|I am a huge DT fan. In fact, since I discovered them 3 years ago they're pretty much all I listen to. In my opinion, their albums are getting progressively better. I don't actually dislike any of their albums, but I much prefer the newer ones. Train of Thought was very heavy, very good. Octavarium had a broad range of rockin' songs. And now, I think Systematic Chaos is my favorite so far. I have a hard time describing the details of the music and why I like it so much. But to anyone that is a Dream Theater fan, or a fan of metal or prog rock, this is a must have!

0684857219|5.0|I found this book a very comprehensive insight into body building and to the various different methodologies, techniques and ideas involved in building mussel. It ranges through all the fundamentals both mental and physical to body building including nutrition and explains proper technique and benefits from a wide range of excises from the chest training and to training the calves.     The book does have a competition focus but is written in such a way that an amateur recreational person who wishes to change their physique in the gym can get plenty out of it. The read has personally benefited my progress in the gym and has helped me create more intense time efficient and goal driven programs in the gym.    The book is not just centred on Arnold Schwarzenegger but has influences from a wide range of body builders. There are some attempt made to connect these body building practices to body mechanics and biological workings, but this book is really about what you should be feeling and proper exercise technique.      I would recommend this book to any one wishing to further there knowledge in the gym or looking for new ideas in which to increase intensity in their gym workouts or desires to make alterations within there gym routines.

B00006G8K0|5.0|Hammer's groundbreaking 1958 version of Dracula (aka Horror of Dracula) is still one of the very best despite the many liberties Jimmy Sangster's concise and highly effective script takes with Bram Stoker's novel to whittle it down to an hour-and-a-half. It's not just the names that have been changed around and the cast of characters greatly reduced to Hammer's budget levels (admirably disguised here by Bernard Robinson's excellent production design). John Van Eyssen's Jonathan Harker is no longer a lawyer, but here is posing as a librarian to get into Dracula's castle with an ulterior motive - presumably on the grounds that the audience knows going in just what Dracula is so there's no point putting the hero through all that mystery when there's staking to be done. The budget doesn't stretch to the voyage and arrival of the ghost ship Demeter or even a Renfield for that matter, and this Dracula has no social interaction with his intended victims in Whitby or London - in fact, he never even leaves the continent. Nor is the vampire fascinated with Harker's intended - here he simply seeks her out as revenge. Yet the changes work surprisingly well, and even throws in a few good twists like the location of Dracula's hiding place.    Although he doesn't have much screen time, Christopher Lee is inspired casting, a feral, vicious creature rather than a Eurotrash smoothie while a very agile Peter Cushing makes a surprisingly physical Van Helsing, the final fight between the good doctor and the evil count surprisingly energetic and violent before the best of the studio's ashes to ashes, dust-to-dust finales. Although rather sedate by today's standards, this film still has a surprising degree of energy and it's easy to see why it made had such a profound impact on the horror genre for decades to come. The first colour version of the tale, it made a big selling point of being able to see the blood in all its vivid hues of red, although it also makes much play on the vampire'sfemale victims being absolutely gagging for it (perhaps not so surprising with Peter Cushing and Michael Gough as the male leads), setting the groundwork for the tits'n'fangs formula that would become the studio's bread and butter over the next couple of decades. A surprisingly cheap picture, thanks to Bernard Robinson's elegant production design and fine direction from Terence Fisher before the drink got to him, it never looks cheap: if anything, it's rather seductively good looking. Unfortunately this is slightly compromised by Warners' widescreen DVD, which feels overcropped at 1.85:1 (the film was intended to be shown in 1.66:1) and there's also a slight wobble at the end of the closing credits.

B000059TPN|5.0|ROcky, Rocky Horror, The ROCK?  Not sure why there are different movie reviews here for different movies, but \\"THE ROCK\\" is an action packed, comedic, fast paced flick.  Right in the midst of Jerry Bruckheimer's peak.  Let's see when, and if, Amazon figures out the differences.

0452289963|5.0|I have read all of Eckhart Tolle's books over the years and found them most beneficial. But \\"A NEW EARTH\\" is his most enlightening book yet to come forth and will no doubt benefit many people. His chapter on the \\"Pain Body\\" is a true eye opener and a MUST READ!!! Even though I've studied and practiced most of these spiritual/metaphysical subjects for the last 24 years, reading the \\"Pain Body\\" chapter was like a bolt of 'truth lightening' strike me. It finally made me more fully understand the cause of all individual and global collective suffering. He gives simple steps to reduce and eliminate suffering through self awareness. If you want to better understand your self and your life, enjoy more peace, joy and happiness...read \\"A NEW EARTH.\\" It is truly a gift to us all!
B0000AUHPG|5.0|One thing I like about Sergio Leone's Westerns is that they start out slowly -- they don't erupt into violence but simmer and let the tension build until it reaches a boiling point and, only then, all hell breaks loose.<br /><br />The opening of this film is probably the best example.  Three men ride into a train station.  It is obvious they are trouble, and aren't going anywhere.  They stow the station master in a closet, and send away his helper, and wait.  The creaking of the windmill, the dripping of water from the cistern overhead, the buzzing of a fly all contribute to the atmosphere of waiting and the growing wonder over what will happen when the train arrives.  Their faces, hardened and scarred, are impassive yet betray a combination of boredom and anticipation.  One collects drops of water in his hat, one captures a fly in the barrel of his pistol.  When the train finally arrives, it seems as if they had waited in vain.  No one gets off.  Then the train pulls away and a harmonica sounds from the other side of the track.  The interchange between the three men and the lone arrival is both hilarious and unsettling and sets the stage for the action that will follow.<br /><br />Leone knows that violence, here in the form of gunplay, has its greatest impact in the anticipation, not when it is incessant.  He lets it build slowly out of conversations, out of atmosphere.  I won't repeat here all of the excellent things that can be said about this film, but it really is an indispensable film -- to my mind the best of Leone's films, and among the most exemplary of Westerns, that showed again what is possible in the genre, when it seemed to have exhausted its themes.  Not to be missed.
0143038419|5.0|Elizabeth, it was great reading Eat, Pray, and Love. My daughter gave it to me as a Christmas present and I found it so fun and inspiring. I passed it on to my yoga instructor. I also decided to learn Italian and since I already speak Spanish, it has not been too difficult. I am heading to Italy this summer to expand my horizons and immerse myself in history and art. I will probably visit the Vatican too while there and do a little praying myself. I am not quite ready for the Ashram or even Bali, but a summer in Italy sounds like a wonderful diversion from my every day life. I think I will come back a new woman ready to tackle the every day challenges life brings my way.<br /><br />Thank you for such an enjoyable read and for inspiring me to take a step towards my own evolvement through your growth and experience.<br /><br />Olga
0760316414|4.0|If you are looking for a book about car drawing, skip this one. As the name says, its about design. There are many insights on what designers search when sketching a car, but very few tips on how to actually draw it by yourself (as it was already commented, you can find the tutorials in the internet - for free). That said, this is a very good book. It depicts the creative process behind the design, it teaches you how to see a car, and shows how some of the greatests (read Patrick Le Quement) do it themselves. It is nicely organized, with enough pictures so you won´t need your imagination to understand what they are talking about. Not perfect, but surely very good. Strongly recommended.  If you want to get the whole pack, design+drawing, I recommend buying this book together with \\"How to draw cars like a pro\\", like I did. Ýou won´t regret doing so.

B000ZOXDFA|3.0|The Good Things:<br />-Looks historically/culturally accurate.<br />-Pretty good filming style with lots of good-looking shots.<br />-Excellent portrayal of Queen Elizabeth (would be comparable to Helen Mirren's performance in \\"Elizabeth I\\").  Very deep, complex, and moving.<br />-Clive Owen is in it, and does okay for himself.<br />-Strong symbolism...I think...<br /><br />The Bad Things:<br />-Action scenes are brief.<br />-Some parts are confusing unless you pay close enough attention.<br />-Some parts were shot through glass or veils, creating some wierd images (although this could also be a good thing, because it is visually mesmerizing).<br />-Action scenes are very brief; particuarly dissapointing for seeing the Spanish armada being wiped out.<br /><br />As a historical drama, this one works quite well.  It has a good style with lots of strong, memorable visuals.  Queen Elizabeth's character stands out tremendously well, and the other characters are not bad either.  However, this is not like watching \\"Braveheart\\" or anything; there are very few action scenes, and they are brief.  This is a film to see more for the artistic value, history, characters, and emotions, not for battles.<br /><br />This is the sequel to the 1998 film \\"Elizabeth,\\" which also had Cate Blanchett, but one could watch this one on its own (the previous one dealt with the earlier stage of her life).
0374105235|2.0|I was very moved by Mr. Beah's life story when he appeared on Jon Stewart. I bought the book and I couldn't put down. However, journalists have now cast serious doubt on whether it really happened. (A very fair article over the controversy \\"The Fog of Memoir\\" appeared in Slate on March 6, 2008.) Despite international acclaim of the book, no former child soldier has thus far come forward to corroborate Beah's account. Re-read the story in this context and certain details start to sound too fantastical to be true.     Some will say that accuracy doesn't matter because of a 'greater truth' -- the plight of Africa's child soldiers. I don't buy it. According to The Australian publication that broke the story, Mr. Beah has earned around $1 million from this bestseller. I take no pleasure in criticizing it because the real child soldiers deserve the world's attention. But lies do not further their cause -- in fact, they only hurt it.

B000P0J02E|5.0|This soundtrack is absolutely incredible!     I was sceptible about the turn-out of this film, especially this score. I could care less about Dead Man's Chest, leaving the score flying solo as the only thing great about that film in my opinion. But, then they finish with flying colors! Visually and musically!     Some of my absolute favorite tracks are 'Down is Up' (A fun,zany, Jack Sparrowish Celtic tune that I never get tired of!), 'Parlay' (I love the western approach to this, Zimmer knew what the director was up to)and 'I Don't Think Now is the Best Time' ( A bit lengthy, but every second is worth it!)     This score is definitely one of Zimmer's best and the film itself is fantastic.

B000FMGTTE|5.0|With all honesty, I had never been a real fan of Ottman's works. His work always seemed to be centered around one major theme and then just a lot of noise. The only score I really liked by Ottman was Hide and Seek.    Needless to say, when I heard that Ottman was signed on to do Superman Returns I was freaked out. There was no way they were going to kill off Mr. Williams' theme (if they did, there went all hope for the score and the movie) and could he really adapt from it?    Quite simply..John Ottman blew me off my feet. Captured the heart and soul of the film and Superman himself. The choral work Ottman brought out was just simply incredible! The best thing about it, is Ottman didn't get nervous about pleasing the crowd by using the theme constantly, for tradition's sake or whatever, Ottman not only mustered up the guts to write for this film but also followed his musical instincts....and bravo! So many re-done films or sequels overdo the themes.     This is most definitely his finest film score and one of my absolute favorites. Full of excitement, sorrow, inspiration and heroism...all of the attributes a score needs to represent the Man of Steel.
B000YABYLA|5.0|I loved it. It was very funny and well written.  I laughed from beginning to end.
B000YABYLA|5.0|I'm the type of person who normally doesn't succumb to hype over anything easily, as I prefer to use my own brain to decide what is worthy of my time or a total waste of it.  But, I know I will likely NOT be alone in saying that this brilliant, hilarious, heartwarming film was certainly worth all the praise/adulation it's been receiving, and then some.  \\"Juno\\" is the epitome of the brave little indie film that could, and practically made its writer Diablo Cody a household name.  Ellen Page sparkles as Juno: an intelligent, sarcastic teenage girl who discovers that she has become pregnant after her first sexual encounter with her best friend Bleeker (the adorably nerdy Michael Cera).  Like any other confused adolescent in her situation, she is faced with the decision of what to do before her baby arrives.  Her best female friend, parents, and Bleeker are all accepting of her condition, which is refreshing to see in a storyline that could have become all too formulatic.  They support her choice to give her child up for adoption and are for the most part nonjudgemental of her actions.  Jason Bateman and Jennifer Garner are a sweet but childless couple whom Juno decides will be wonderful adoptive parents.  As with life in general, things don't exactly go as planned, but to give much more of the plot away would ruin this incredible movie for anyone who hasn't already seen it. For such serious subject matter that is tackled in this movie, I laughed out loud more than a few times at the razor sharp, witty dialogue!!  I was absolutely thrilled when Diablo Cody won an Oscar for her original screenplay, and I'm anxious to see what she will be working on next.  The musical soundtrack is also a cool, diverse collection of songs that fit the feel of the film wonderfully (Mott the Hoople's \\"All The Young Dudes\\" is a particular standout, considering how long the tune itself has been around); I loved the duet between Bleeker and Juno right before the end credits started rolling, too.  I see a lot of movies over the course of a year both in the theater and on DVD rentals, and \\"Juno\\" is definitely near the top of my list for one of the best flicks I've seen in quite a while.  I love this film; it left me with a great, positive feeling of wanting more. The whole cast was impeccable in their performances presenting flawed yet very realistic characters that you can't help but genuinely care about. \\"Juno\\" will be joining my DVD collection upon its release, and I know that it's one disc I will watch over again and again.  I only wish all of the indie films I've seen in the past could be half as fantastic as this one was for me!!o.

0375842381|2.0|Mr. Pullman weaves a great story, and it is clear he is a brilliant writer.      But the only way you could read these books and not find offense is that you don't believe in god.  He specifically writes that the Christian/Jewish god is evil, and that is a bit of a disturbing message to be putting into a children's book.  He intentionally frames himself as the anti-C.S. Lewis, who he considers \\"evil.\\"    The problem with this book is not that he criticizes the church, its that he specifically and directly criticizes god.  I don' think that has any redeeming qualities, and isn't a healthy outlook no matter who you are or what you believe.      Frankly, if you read these books carefully, its impossible to miss.  So if you are an atheist, go for it, you'll probably really enjoy his tremendous skill.  But if you believe in god, or your children do, find a book that has a more adjusted criticism of the church or one that is more friendly.

But<br />if you like the Director's Cut or the Final Cut, that's okay...because<br />you get them all!  Don't get me started again.  If you're a Blade Runner<br />fan, just go ahead and buy this set.  Remember - the light that shines<br />twice as bright only lasts half as long...so get it while it's still available!

B0011NVC9I|5.0|mere words aren't really sufficient enough to do this film justice.  every aspect of the film is spot on & It holds up to multiple viewings. excellent special features are plentiful on this dvd. the animation ranges from great to excellent (as in, i'd have a hard time telling the difference between live action in some scenes).  the story is powerful and riddled with depth and metaphors. it is a cautionary tale of sorts...sprinkled with themes of temptation and redemption. the final battle with the dragon is absolutely epic.
B000000Y59|5.0|Most of Bill Evans' work is great and timeless. Much of it, like this record, transcends jazz or any other stylistic category. It is simply gorgeous, intelligent music. As some writers have said, he seemed to distill beauty and nostalgia out of thin air.
B000R5N1MC|3.0|...even though I am a fan of this particular film, as well as some of Ridley Scott's other fine achievements, I was somewhat dissapointed with this \\"box set\\". True, there was a description on the back of what was inside (buyer beware), I felt somewhat cheated that the car replica was very \\"mass produced\\" looking and felt \\"cheap and plastic-like\\", same with the origami unicorn. You would think that it could have been done in die cast metal, or even better...SCRAP THE TINKER TOYS!...and put in some cool literature or a hardcover art book....that would have been much better. Also the discs were not packaged very well...right off the bat, disc 1 was scuffed slightly, but thank goodness it plays ok. On the whole though, the 5 disc edition is superb in it's content, I just felt cheated by this \\"briefcase\\" stunt...
B0010X8NF0|2.0|I liked The Royal Tenenbaums quite a bit, but The Darjeeling Limited wasn't that good. I didn't really laugh once and I could care less about the characters. Thank goodness the movie was less than 90 minutes long!
0385337388|2.0|As a second-year medical student, this book read more like a horror story than like a \\"classic novel of life and death in an American hospital.\\"  Filled with the cynicism and free thinking that was supposed to embody the 70's, the author's mainstay over-the-top-shocker style of writing immediately becomes dry and lifeless before the reader ever notices how poorly the characters are developed.  The book could better be interpreted as an emotional outlet for someone who became disenchanted with medical training, lost their way and exercised defense mechanisms that harmed both colleagues and patients.<br /><br />However, the author does bring to light important issues such as how medicine is taught/learned, the sometimes grim realities behind that training and the importance of outside support vs. internal defense mechanisms in maintaining perspective on a challenging course.
B0000041WV|4.0|Excellent performances of wonderful music.  Disk creation leaves a little to be desired - it's awkward to start a favorite symphony on track 3 of one disk and then have it end on track two of the next.  Shades of the LP era!
B000056VJ7|5.0|I bought this album in 1977 when I was eleven years old and it blew me away; I loved the Beatles at the time, but this was the first individual album that I went nuts over.  I bought the original CD when it was released and then the remastered version recently.  There's not much I can say about the content of the CD that hasn't yet been said here other than its having aged extremely well.
B00005QDW5|3.0|Yeah I bought this CD, but only because I would call myself a pretty big fan and wanted a \\"complete\\" collection.  Here's my biggest problems: they butchered Shine On and Echoes.    That being said, if you are new to PF, this is a pretty good place to start.  If you're not a huge fan but already have some PF CDs then do your self a favor and skip this one because you already have 90% of the songs, instead, go out and buy \\"less common\\" albums like Piper at the Gates of Dawn or Relics.
B000002IM7|3.0|As much as I LOVE King's-X, this album is certainly not worthy of all of the gushing praise lavished upon it.<br /><br />For sure the listener can hear the beginnings of the great music that Gretchen, FHL, and later efforts represent. But I really think that people are reflecting on Silent Planet with a bit too much nostalgia.

B00005JPTK|5.0|Originally I went to this movie simply because it was a Will Smith flick.I knew very little of what I was about to see...so I sat there and was glued to the movie screen.This amazing story of a man living on his own,trying to survive a life of solitude,trying to stay alive from the \\"infected\\". When the movie was over I was curious as to what all he had done over the previous 3 years...what kind of thoughts went through his head?Did he ever just want to give up on life? How did he cope with being alone all the time,with no social interaction with other human beings.I mean sure he talked to mannequins,but that was obviously out of desperation to talk to someone.... I enjoyed this movie so much I went and watched it again.That wasn't enough so I bought the book,which is fairly different in areas,but the main idea of a man being alone for so long is still there.What a incredible story.What a great movie. I cannot wait for this to come out on DVD.
055357342X|5.0|I thought that with so many pages and being the third book it was going to decrease in interest and action.... Surprisingly, I found again that Martin is able to surprise me with every single chapter.... It´s a really good work.... Congratulations to the author. Highly recommended.

0307387151|5.0|It took a while for me to plunge through this book. Most of that time was spent on the first 100 pages. I never thought I'd be giving it five stars, but I encourage you to keep reading. The author uses a lot of words and it seemed to me at first that he spent way too much time describing the simplest of things. Soon I got used to his style and found it captivating. I haven't seen the movie and find myself wondering just how it could be made into a movie and be nearly as good as the book. This would be a good book for a study group or literature class.

0312379293|5.0|Wow! I read THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO as a teen, and it's always been a favorite of mine, so I was delighted to learn that Jeffrey Archer's new novel was a modern version of that well-loved tale. But A PRISONER OF BIRTH is a good deal more than a new spin on Alexandre Dumas--it's a fascinating, edge-of-your-seat thriller that actually makes a few valid points about the world today. From courtroom to prison to freedom with a glamorous new identity and a burning desire for revenge, the young hero of Archer's book is a worthy contemporary counterpart of Edmond Dantes, the \\"Count\\" of Monte Cristo. But you don't have to be familiar with the Dumas original to enjoy this terrific story. It's a good, old-fashioned page-turner that succeeds on its own merits. Highly recommended.
0385341067|4.0|In this novel by Lloyd Jones, a tale is crafted around a young girl whose village is slowly being destroyed by the ravages of a rebellion on their small south pacific island.  Cut off from the outside world, they endure with only what the land and sea provide.  The local children find some solace when the only remaining white man creates a school where the village and a lone copy of Dickens 'Great Expectations' become the teachers.    The beauty of this story is in the subtlety of the presentation of its themes.  Issues of war, identity, change, the unknown, are all interwoven together within this tale, but no one ever seems to leap down the readers  neck.  Instead, each idea is presented within stories that are themselves  stories.  Pealing ones way through this novel is a rewarding endeavor, whose poignancy may not be felt by the unpretentious characters and their isolated world view.      Just as the village elders teach their children about life, preserving what they know by instilling it in the next generation, the reader learns as well.  To dream and to live, to explore and discover, when the outside is collapsing around you, retreat to that place inside, where imagination comes alive, and a reality that you create, that is no one else's, becomes your own.    Another important point this book makes is that of ownership.  As the children learn about Pip's world they make it their own, creating it as their own. Having no sense of 19th century London, they create Pip's reality.  An excellent exercise for readers of all ages.
B0010ZR160|4.0|I had to write a review because I had no warning this movie would be such an emotional trigger for those of us who got left behind in less than happy homes.  Its a wonderfully told story of the choices we have to make between whats legal and whats moral and honestly whats primal.  Its a question I thought I new the answer too but after seriously weeping thru the last half hour of this movie and for another half hour after that I realized I would do pratically anything to defend a child without regard for consequense.

We both came to Alaska from<br />the area around Washington, D.C. We were both about the same age and had a similar<br />idea in mind; to live a free life in the Alaska wild. Fourteen years later Chris McCandless<br />is dead and I am living the dream I set out to win for myself. What made the difference<br />in these two outcomes?<br /><br />There was nothing heroic or even mysterious about what Chris McCandless did in April<br />1992. Like many Alaskans, I read Jon Krakauer's book &#34;Into the Wild&#34; when it first<br />came out and finished it thinking, &#34;why does this guy rate an entire book?&#34; The fact that<br />Krakauer is a great outdoor writer and philosopher is the bright spot and it makes a great<br />read, but McCandless was not something special.<br /><br />As a park ranger both at Denali National Park, very near where McCandless died, and<br />now at Gates of the Arctic National Park, even more remote and wild than Denali, I am<br />exposed continually to what I will call the &#34;McCandless Phenomenon.&#34; People, nearly<br />always young men, come to Alaska to challenge themselves against an unforgiving<br />wilderness landscape where convenience of access and possibility of rescue are<br />practically nonexistent. I know the personality type because I was one of those young<br />men.<br /><br />In fact, Alaska is populated with people who are either running away from something or<br />seeking themselves in America's last frontier. It is a place very much like the frontier of<br />the Old West where you can come to and reinvent yourself. In reality, most people who<br />make it as far as Alaska never get past the cities of Fairbanks and Anchorage because<br />access is so difficult and expensive (usually by airplane), travel is so hard, the terrain is<br />challenging, the bears are real, and so on.<br /><br />A very few competent and skillful people make a successful go at living a free life in the<br />wild, build a home in the mountains, raise their children there and eventually come back<br />with good stories and happy endings. A greater number give it a try, realize it is neither<br />easy nor romantic, just damn hard work, and quickly give up and return to town with<br />their tails between their legs, but alive and the wiser for it.<br /><br />Some like McCandless, show up in Alaska, unprepared, unskilled and unwilling to take<br />the time to learn the skills they need to be successful. These quickly get in trouble and<br />either die by bears, by drowning, by freezing or they are rescued by park rangers or other<br />rescue personnel-but often, not before risking their lives and/or spending a lot of<br />government money on helicopters and overtime.<br /><br />When you consider McCandless from my perspective, you quickly see that what he did<br />wasn't even particularly daring, just stupid, tragic and inconsiderate. First off, he spent<br />very little time learning how to actually live in the wild. He arrived at the Stampede Trail<br />without even a map of the area. If he had a good map he could have walked out of his<br />predicament using one of several routes that could have been successful. Consider where<br />he died. An abandoned bus. How did it get there? On a trail. If the bus could get into<br />the place where it died, why couldn't McCandless get out of the place where he died?<br />The fact that he had to live in an old bus in the first place tells you a lot. Why didn't he<br />have an adequate shelter from the beginning? What would he have done if he hadn't<br />found the bus? Abag of rice and a sleeping bag do not constitute adequate gear and<br />provisions for a long stay in the wilderness.<br /><br />No experienced backcountry person would travel during the month of April. It is a time<br />of transition from winter's frozen rivers and hard packed snow with good traveling<br />conditions into spring's quagmire of mud and raging waters where even small creeks<br />become impassible. Hungry bears come out of their dens with just one thing in mind--<br />eating.<br /><br />Furthermore, Chris McCandless poached a moose and then wasted it. He killed a<br />magnificent animal superbly conditioned to survive the rigors of the Alaskan wild then,<br />inexperienced in how to preserve meat without refrigeration (the Eskimos and Indians do<br />it to this day), he watched 1500 pounds of meat rot away in front of him. He's lucky the<br />stench didn't bring a grizzly bear to end his suffering earlier. And in the end, the moose<br />died for nothing.<br /><br />So what made the difference between McCandless and I fourteen years ago? Why am I<br />alive and he is dead? Essentially, Chris McCandless committed suicide while I<br />apprenticed myself to a career and a life that I wanted more badly than I can possibly<br />describe in so short an essay. In the end I believe that the difference between us was that<br />I wanted to live and Chris McCandless wanted to die (whether he realized it or not). The<br />fact that he died in a compelling way doesn't change that outcome. He might have made<br />it work if he had respected the wilderness he was purported to have loved. But it is my<br />belief that surviving in the wilderness is not what he had in mind.<br /><br />I did not start this essay to trash poor Chris McCandless. Not intentionally. It is sad that<br />the boy had to die. The tragedy is that McCandless more than likely was suffering from<br />mental illness and didn't have to end his life the way he did. The fact that he chose<br />Alaska's wildlands to do it in speaks more to the fact that it makes a good story than to<br />the fact that McCandless was heroic or somehow extraordinary. In the end, he was sadly<br />ordinary in his disrespect for the land, the animals, the history, and the self-sufficiency<br />ethos of Alaska, the Last Frontier.<br /><br />6.13.08: Comment by Catherine Todd on the comments:<br /><br />I just now saw all these comments from where I had originally posted this in the &#34;review&#34; section. I had no idea posting an actual letter from an Alaskan Park Ranger would elicit such a overwhelming response. I agree wholeheartedly with the ranger, having had some wilderness experience but not enough to ever attempt to &#34;go it alone&#34; in Alaska or elsewhere.<br /><br />Being a Girl Scout and in the Boy Scouts too (when they would let me!) showed me how much I &#34;didn't know.&#34; Living up in the mountains in Colorado for a winter's season when I was 18 years old, and being lucky enough to hike out in the snow by myself - when I ran out of food & firewood - and find my way to town - showed me how much experience is really required. I could have died up there and wouldn't have been found until the Spring thaw. Just like in the old-time books and Western movies.<br /><br />There is nothing &#34;romantic&#34; about the &#34;Jeremiah Johnson&#34; life, no matter how good it looks on film. This film showed that, to me. I'm going to post the Ranger's letter in a discussion area here on Amazon, where it probably belonged in the first place. Thanks for all the comments. Boy, am I surprised! But I absolutely LOVED reading the Alaskan Ranger's Letter (written by Ranger Peter Christian). He knows what he is talking about, &#34;North South East & West, forward backwards over & under.&#34; I hope I never have to &#34;get rescued,&#34; but if I do, let it be by him!<br /><br />Update April 14, 2010 Two years later: more comments on the comments:<br /><br />Reading all the comments about this review makes me wish, in part, that I hadn't posted the ranger's letter, no matter how on target it is. I am amazed that anyone could find fault with someone who is writing from EXPERIENCE. Here's my final comment I posted today, at the bottom of 6 pages of comments. I hope that Ranger Peter Christian knows how much I admire the work that he and countless others are doing to protect both our last remaining wildernesses, and our lives when we do go out there.<br /><br />People who seem to like criticizing the ranger who wrote the commentary, written from EXPERIENCE, might change their tune if they get trapped in the wilderness and have to be bailed out by guys like him. I for one am grateful that people like this are prepared, and do their job; what would we do without them?<br /><br />The ranger is saying that people need to BE PREPARED before they go out into the wilderness, as they endanger other people's lives when rescue teams have to go in to save them. It's no different than people who start forest fires inadvertently or through inattention; look at the damage they cause. These kind of people are dangerous, whether they mean to or not. TRAINING COUNTS.

B000059TEQ|4.0|A good movie, not great, that garnered tremendous support at the pinnacle of the Vietnam War, as a type of returning to reality, American style. A large segment of the population was fed up with war movies, \\"Easy Riders\\", \\"Midnight Cowboys\\" et al and naturally radiated to Erich Segal's simple novel transformed into a simple film. They got their money's worth. Crowds openly hissed and booed Milland's every move, a sure sign of his commendable performance as the bossy, conceited establishment figure. O'Neal's hatred of him could be felt right through the screen.Macgraw gives an uneven performance; one is often at a loss as to whether her attempts at one-upsmanship over O'Neal are reality or teasing. Whatever, the couple is apparently truly in love as the bedroom scenes (tastefully done) seem to indicate. The ending seems to convey the couple's atheism; a truly loving God would allow this to happen? In summation, this is a timeless movie, well worth your attention.

The fact that he died in a compelling way doesn't change that outcome. He might have made it work if he had respected the wilderness he was purported to have loved. But it is my belief that surviving in the wilderness is not what he had in mind. I did not start this essay to trash poor Chris McCandless. Not intentionally. It is sad that the boy had to die. The tragedy is that McCandless more than likely was suffering from mental illness and didn't have to end his life the way he did. The fact that he chose Alaska's wildlands to do it in speaks more to the fact that it makes a good story than to the fact that McCandless was heroic or somehow extraordinary.<br /><br />In the end, he was sadly ordinary in his disrespect for the land, the animals, the history, and the self-sufficiency ethos of Alaska, the Last Frontier.
B000ZOXDFA|3.0|There is something stubbornly old-fashioned about Shekhar Kapur's 2007 sequel to his 1998 art-house triumph, [[ASIN:B000RF7XYO Elizabeth]]. I don't mean the newer movie is a stodgy historical pageant. Far from it, all the production values are first-rate, including a relatively seamless use of CGI in the Spanish Armada sequence, but beyond all the pomp and circumstance, the mindset of the story is pure 1940's-era studio melodrama. Set in 1585, the film picks up the Queen's life a quarter century after the first film, and what follows in the strangely cautious screenplay by Michael Hirst and William Nicholson is a simplistic portrait of an aging, superstitious woman aware of her power but ironically at a loss to define her own fate. This period of her life is familiar from a number of previous films and miniseries, but this time, the psychological complexity behind such a fascinating historical figure has been downgraded in favor of romance novel plot turns and paper-thin character development.<br /><br />The set-up is rich with possibilities only partially realized onscreen. Protestant England is on its knees, as Roman Catholic Spain has become Europe's most powerful country. Now in her early fifties, Elizabeth is vulnerable since Phillip II of Spain is intent on conquering England and especially because she has not married and produced an heir. Next in line is her cousin, Mary, Queen of Scots, a devout Roman Catholic imprisoned in a castle in Northamptonshire. Elizabeth has proven to be a tolerant ruler as she allows her country's Roman Catholics to maintain their religious beliefs, even though they see Mary as the only rightful Queen. In the meantime, Sir Walter Raleigh has just returned from the New World and stimulated Elizabeth's passion for adventure and her long-dormant desire for romance. Complicating matters is Elizabeth's devoted lady-in-waiting, Bess, a comely beauty who attracts Raleigh's attention. Just as this standard triangle is established, there is a threat on Elizabeth's life known historically as the Babington Plot. Mary is beheaded for her connection to the plot, which gives Philip free rein to gain the Pope's approval to attack England. Elizabeth inspires her troops to face off with the much larger Spanish Armada, and the rest, as they say, is history.<br /><br />It's no surprise that Cate Blanchett commands the screen in the title role and does her best to fill in the blanks left by the routine script. She manages to imbue the Queen with a hidden vulnerability at which comparatively imperious predecessors like Bette Davis and Glenda Jackson merely hint. The one drawback is that she is too young for the role, a point emphasized by the periodic and somewhat conceited use of flashbacks from the previous film in which her appearance has not changed significantly despite the make-up. Geoffrey Rush returns from the first film as Elizabeth's advisor, Sir Francis Walsingham, but he has less to do this time. As Raleigh, Clive Owen has no problem playing a dashing figure, but he seems more like a romantic's fabrication of what a bodice-ripping swashbuckler should be. Speaking with a strange burr, Samantha Morton has precious few scenes as the fanatical but forgiving Mary, and her pouty face and petulant manner seem at odds with previous characterizations. As Philip, Jordi Moll&agrave; is forced to play the king as a religious zealot, while Abbie Cornish's Bess strikes me as far too contemporary in manner to be credible as a lady-in-waiting, especially with the ongoing hints of lesbianism and a soft porn-like lovemaking scene with Raleigh.<br /><br />Guy Dyas' production design, Alexandra Byrne's costumes and Remi Adefarasin's cinematography are all impressive in their splendor and meticulous detail, though I found the music by Craig Armstrong and A.R. Rahman far too intrusive. There are several extras with the 2008 DVD release starting with Kapur's commentary track, often insightful but excessively verbose. An eleven-minute making-of featurette is included, of course, but it is pretty standard with plenty of now-and-then comparisons with the 1998 film. Three other shorts are included - one on Dyas' intensive work on the production design, one on the recreation of the climactic battle with a mix of ship replicas and CGI, and one on the actual locations used for the filming. There are nine minutes of deleted and extended scenes including one that too-realistically shows Mary's decapitated head. None of these extras helps make the experience of watching this film any more involving.te is included, of course, but it is pretty standard with plenty of now-and-then comparisons with the 1998 film.

B0002ZDVEU|4.0|****1/2<br /><br />I am late getting on the \\"Bourne\\" bandwagon. I just watched the first two films in the series for the first time last weekend after years of avoiding them. My impression? That so far, the \\"Bourne\\" films deserve all of the praise and success that they've received.<br /><br />What we have here is an intelligent, engrossing, well-written, well-acted and well-directed action film that can be enjoyed by families and mainstream audiences, but that doesn't insult the viewer's intelligence. I have to give props ... pulling that off is not easy to do.<br /><br />In the second film of the series, \\"The Bourne Supremacy\\", Jason Bourne finds that, despite the fact that he still can't recall most of it, he cannot escape his past. Although managing for two years to live in seclusion with his girlfriend, he is drawn back into the violent world he tried to escape when he is hunted down by another \\"Treadstone\\" agent, who fails to murder Bourne but kills his girlfriend. (The underwater scene where Jason watches Marie's lifeless body float away is tender and beautifully sad). Bourne is then framed by the same corrupt CIA agent (Brian Cox) who used to run the \\"Treadstone\\" program that created Bourne, and Jason is forced to prove his innocence while still trying to figure out his past.<br /><br />Matt Damon is the thinking man's action hero, and a complete departure from the stereotypically cocky, wisecracking American hero type. In action, Bourne is precise, powerful and unstoppable, but when he's not, Damon plays him with the stoic vulnerability of a man who wants desperately to escape the violent past he can barely remember. When Bourne tracks down the offspring of a politician he assassinated in his former life, the scene is heartbreakingly restrained. Bravo.
0143038419|1.0|I'd seen this book everywhere and when my book club chose it, I purchased it with enthusiasm.  That was my first and last bit of pleasure with this book!    First off, I question whether the author's husband was so angry at her because she just left him, or whether she had, in actuality, already begun an affair with David, her \\"boyfriend.\\"  I use this term loosely, because even if she had made the physical break from her husband, she was still legally married to him, even as she shacked up with David.  What an endearing character, right from the start.    Secondly, I began reading the book while I was on a trip to Rome.  She talks about her friend Giovanni passing her the name of a pizza joint in Naples as if he is giving her top secret info from the CIA.  I flipped to Naples in our guidebook and the same pizza place was one of the two pizza restaurants listed for that city.  Big secret!      There were many other passages in this book that I just plain thought had been made up.  Also, does anyone but me think that the way Richard from Texas speaks is very similar to the guy from \\"Lost\\" who dubs the Kate character \\"Freckles?\\"  Only here, Richard calls Gilbert \\"Groceries.\\"  Ah, very original.      Of course, Gilbert had been given an advance for this book and I can imagine her mind racing to squeeze in details and make something of her adventure.  Perhaps that is why it felt so fabricated to me.  Memoirs are my very favorite genre, but something about this book rang untrue.

By film critics, film buffs, the other user posters on IMDb and every other person who saw this one?<br /><br />But you know what? I'm not here to really promote this movie, or analyze it... I'm here to write my love letter for it. We're all here to share our movie-going experiences, aren't we? Well, [...], here's mine.<br /><br />I still remember being a little prepubescent boy sitting in the theater watching this movie, totally amazed and astounded by what I saw. Seeing this wacky cartoons going through a routine Tom-and-Jerry-type episode... and then... it was amazing how these movie actually tricked you, convinced you to believe that human and cartoons can exist in the same universe and dimension of reality.<br /><br />There are many a great pleasures and moments in this movie, one of them is the duet at a \\"toon\\" night club called \\"The Ink & Paint Club\\" where Eddie goes to get information about Roger's wife, and the opening act is a dueling duet on the piano featuring two great legends, Daffy Duck and Donald Duck (I doubt there's any biological relation there) together at last. Why did it take so long for these two to get together? Well, they are rival entertainers for rival studios, so...<br /><br />But of course, the dueling duet ends in an all-out war. Come on, we both know the hatchet wasn't going to stay buried very long.<br /><br />The whole movie is worth renting just to see the two great legends, Daffy and Donald, put their differences aside for one memorable dueling piano duet ALONE.<br /><br />\\"Roger Rabbit\\" pioneered not only animation and film-making style, but acting, writing, directing and a meshing together of different genres.<br /><br />Imagination, luck, brilliance, skill... it's all been blended so perfectly here... just like the animation and live-action.<br /><br />Funny, sharp, satirical, smart, thrilling, skillful, bright, bold, hard-boiled, colorful... at even at times, a little scary.<br /><br />It one three Oscars, not to mention an Honorary Award for it's Technical Advancements.<br /><br />Hell, it deserved every single Oscar it got!

Everyone should see it, pure and simple. It's a movie... for pretty much everybody. A masterpiece in more ways than one.<br /><br />So help me God, I cannot think of a better actor for the role of the classic, hard-boiled, rock-bottom, not-too-smooth P.I. than Bob Hoskins. I don't think he's ever played a better role in his whole life. He seems to be a strange collision of Sam Spade and W.C. Fields, in some strange way.<br /><br />Christopher Lloyd proves yet again (as he does in all his roles) that he's one of the most underrated actors in the business. He's known for playing the bizarre, the crazy, the wired. But his ability to play villains, particularly more sedate and low-key ones, is overlooked so much, it's grounds for a discrimination lawsuit.<br /><br />Kathleen Turner is damn perfect as Roger's Mrs; especially considering that all she does here is a voice.<br /><br />Roger Rabbit\\" pioneered not only animation and film-making style, but acting, writing, directing and a meshing together of different genres.

B0000AQS0F|5.0|If you're a big fan of wild-west style sci-fi shows you're in for a real treat.  I never saw the show's brief run while it was on cable but I'm glad I looked into it after seeing the movie (Serenity).  It's a shame the show was cancelled.    About the show itself, not only are the FX good - especially for a cable TV production - more importantly the characters are engaging and 'real'.  If you found yourself upset when Han Solo was encased in carbonite, you may have similar reactions when these characters encounter adversity.    BTW - some episodes are not for younger children!

B0000041Z5|5.0|One generally tends to think of Georg Solti as a sensationalistic conductor--going for spectacular orchestral effects even at the expense of line, structure and mood.  Whether this generalization is in any sense apt is an open question, but it certainly doesn't apply to Solti's remarkably cogent Brahms cycle.<br /><br />Surprisingly, the performances in this box are closer in style to Klemperer than to Stokowski or Bernstein.  That means slow and steady rather than febrile or opulent.  The First begins grandly with a hugely powerful and perfectly paced introduction, and thereafter tends to sobriety.  Even in the finale Solti favors structural cohesion over dramatic incident, though the big moments (such as the return of the chorale in the coda) are undeniably effective.  The Second is more upbeat, as it should be, but the emphasis once again falls on majesty rather than visceral excitement.  The finale brims with energy, yet everything is under control.  The Third is quite magnificent, with an evocative ramble through the slow movement and a particularly haunting (and daringly slow) treatment of the third movement.  I have heard more effective balancing of the triumphal and the troubling in the finale, but otherwise Solti does well in holding this difficult movement together.  The Fourth is monumental, at times even marmoreal, with the tragic impulses held in check by a certain stoicism.  The two overtures evince similar virtues: neither the rambustiousness of the *Academic Festival* nor the *Sturm und Drang* of the *Tragic* is overdone, though there is plenty of warmth in the CSO's playing of both pieces.  Indeed, the CSO acquits itself splendidly throughout Solti's Brahms cycle; the winds in particular convey the long line with just the right amount of expressive pointing.  The recording is rich and full, though somewhat bass-heavy as others have noted.<br /><br />Altogether, this is one of the finest Brahms cycles I have auditioned, though as regards interpretation I wouldn't put these performances ahead of those by such great historical figures as Furtw&auml;ngler, Walter, Klemperer--or even by the sadly neglected (and currently unavailable) Steinberg.  At least as far as Brahms is concerned, Solti emphasizes majesty over sonic thrills, and that speaks well of this sometimes maligned conductor.  The one disadvantage is that Decca/Universal didn't see fit to include the *Haydn Variations* which could have been easily accommodated given the skimpy playing time on a couple of these discs.on I wouldn't put these performances ahead of those by such great historical figures as Furtw&auml;ngler, Walter, Klemperer--or even by the sadly neglected (and currently unavailable) Steinberg.

0385340559|5.0|...and you sure as hell don't step on Reacher's toothbrush.<br /><br />This is Lee Child's 11th Reacher thriller.  I've read them all, and I believe it is fair to say, that no other writer has captivated this reader like Mr. Child.  What is it about Reacher?  In a class by himself?  Of course.  There're are lots of  hard-as-nails protagonists out there, from Mike Hammer to Travis McGee to Harry Bosch, but for me, Jack Reacher is not only the toughest, but also my favorite.<br /><br />The New York Times claims that Lee Child is \\"The best thriller writer of the moment.\\"  I think this is true, but an understatement.  Who is a better thriller writer than Child?<br /><br />As for Bad Luck and Trouble, I particularly liked knowing a bit more about his old elite MP military unit.  Instead of utilizing a prequel, the time frame is the present.  Someone has been killing off members of his old unit.  After the army, they all had gone on to new careers.<br /><br />As a writer myself, I wondered if the men and women of his elite unit had been created in the past, or came phoenix-like out of the ashes of Lee Child's imagination as he wrote the book?  Doesn't really matter though, does it?  Child certainly makes it seem like the eight members of the unit already existed long before Killing Floor, which was Child's first Reacher novel, and where this reader feels the new Reacher reader should start.  See my review of Killing Floor on Amazon.<br /><br />His book \\"The Enemy,\\" although chronologically the first, was about when he was a major in the army.  It brought in his brother and his mother, but was maybe my least favorite.  Why is it my least favorite?  It wasn't the Reacher we now know and love, but did offer insight into how he got that way.<br /><br />In \\"Bad Luck\\" he had left behind the army years ago, had transitioned from Major Jack Reacher to the man we now know, but the guys and girls in his unit got to see the man not as he used to be, their commander, a major in the army, but the man whose possessions now amounted to a folding toothbrush, a passport, the clothes on his back, and a ATM card.  While the rest of the gang had gone on to various degrees of fame, fortune and failure, Reacher had remained the same.  A loner, a drifter, truly leaving do trail.  I don't know why I'm always surprised when he puts the 9mm up to the guy's head and pulls the trigger, or how he hears the unmistakable sound of a magazine clicking home.  This one was high on mystery, high on thrills and suspense.  Highly recommended.ounted to a folding toothbrush, a passport, the clothes on his back, and a ATM card.

I finally saw it last night on DVD.<br /><br />As a scientist, I found the film both disappointing and encouraging.<br /><br />*** SPOILERS AHEAD ***<br /><br />The movie is disappointing because the science of the film is flimsy at best.<br /><br />1)Sometimes when you're in a space suit and solar radiation hits you, you're incinerated but, later in the movie, a character can shoot between two separated spacecraft sections with the sun shining on him and survive.<br />2) The whole surviving space exposure without a space suit, perhaps best (and most realistically) done in \\"2001: A Space Odyssey\\" when Dave Bowman has a suit but no helmet and has to blow himself into the Discovery.  Pressure differentials and extreme temperature deltas should be considered.  I honestly don't know what would happen in such a case, only that the exploding miner in the leaky suit from \\"Outland\\" seems to be a lot more physically accurate of what would occur.<br />3) The marooned and wacky human astronaut going crazy and turning into a solar demon is a complete farce.  No explanation is given (and trust me, one is needed) for how the transformation occurs.<br />4) Why not just fire a colossal missile through space?  The fission reaction could be activated based on temperature or proximity to the sun.<br />5) No explanation for why the sun has burned out.<br />6) There's constant discussion in the movie about who's more important to the mission.  Frankly, I think most everyone on board would be cross-trained, especially when it came to activating the solar nuke.  Besides, at the end of the movie, the guy punches a few buttons and plugs in a connector or two.  Gee, that's hard.  I'm just a pilot, not a nuclear munitions expert.

B00020PO8Q|4.0|The \\"Hullabaloo Soundtrack\\" is a mixed bag. Aside \\"[[ASIN:B0001LJC2K Absolution]],\\" \\"[[ASIN:B000FVQYYK Black Holes and Revelations]]\\" and \\"[[ASIN:B000AMPZF8 Origin of Symmetry]],\\" the studio Hullabaloo disc offers little comparison. This disc is what it is . . . a collection of leftovers that weren't good enough to be released on a regular LP. I suppose that we should be grateful that the material has been released since there are some highlights. The instrumentals stand out as both compelling and especially unusual in the Muse pantheon. If you're a Muse fanatic like me, you'll find these tunes interesting, but the material will never resonate like the songs on their more contemporary releases. The selling point for \\"Hullabaloo Soundtrack\\" is the live disc. It's a great snap shot at what can now be regarded as an earlier time period for Muse. The recording and performance quality is fantastic. I'd describe it as having a harder edge than other Muse shows that I've experienced. 'Citizen Erased' and 'Space Dementia' are highlights. While interesting, the show falls short of [[ASIN:B000XTLUW0 Haarp]], the ultimate live Muse release. While the first CD is only for the faithful, the second disc can be appreciated by the casual listener with an interest in the band's live show. After acquiring all of the band's 'A' list albums, \\"Hullabaloo Soundtrack\\" will nicely fill out any Muse collection.
0385341067|3.0|\\"Mister Pip\\" by Lloyd Jones is the sad tale of a young woman's struggle with her very adult world. The tale illuminates on how literature can affect our daily lives and it is through Dicken's \\"Great Expectations\\" that the young woman, Matilda, learns to cope with her war-wraught world. The novel teaches her how to survive but, most importantly, how to make her voice heard in a place where individuals are lost to the vastness of the world and society. Although this theme emerges late in the novel, Matilda's moments of ephiphany evoke powerful and emotional responses.       For most of the novel the connection between Dicken's masterpiece and Matilda's life is difficult to recognize. However, one of the most important lines in the book is when the young protagonist realizes just how small and insignificant are her struggles. \\"This time the whole village listened in wonder, sitting by a small fire on an island all but forgotten, where the most unspeakable things happened without once raising the ire of the outside world\\" (166). She struggles to find her own significance and even loses a desire to live. However, the novel strongly connects with literature lovers when Matilda realizes that works are written because of the human experience. It is here where the slow beginning and unclear themes are redeemed. The reader is reminded of the time where they, too, realized that literature reflects the stories of our lives.

Nikki is really merciless to himself and effectively portays just about the ugliest picture of addiction and depression that the mind can comprehend.  As I read these memoires and their respective commentaries, I felt a mixture of pain, humour, sorrow, joy and inspiration, encouragement and redemption.

0525476881|4.0|Since I've always been a fan of Young Adult and Juvenile books--love to read them, love to write them--I just had to see what all the fuss was about with author John Green's coming-of-age novel.  What sets it apart from others in the genre?<br /><br />I started reading and quickly found out: it's an original concept, a laugh-out-loud funny story, complete with satire and an American road trip that's unlike any road trip I ever took. I'm enamored with this book and Green's main character, Colin Singleton, a loner with a quirky fascination for anagrams, math and odd facts. His main problem is that he has a hard time making friends, but NO problem with finding girlfriends.<br /><br />But keeping them is another story!<br /><br />At the end of his senior year of high school, \\"Katherine the Nineteenth\\" dumps him ... only the latest in a chain of rejections. As a result, he becomes indecisive about his future and begins to question his identity, his future.<br /><br />What is Colin's problem? Why can't he keep his friends? When his friend Hassan suggests a road trip, what happens when the boys take off?  What does a cemetery in the middle of rural Tennessee have to do with him? And who's Archduke Franz Ferdinand? Will Colin and Hassan fulfill Colin's quest to understand why he is always being dumped by his girlfriends?<br /><br />Since Colin is a fading prodigy whose hobbies include making anagrams, memorizing odd historical facts, mathematical equations, and dating girls named Katherine, what mathematical equation does he formulate to explain why so many dump him? And just how many Katherines make an \\"abundance?\\"<br /><br />You're invited on Colin's journey to find the answers to all those questions, but I can tell you one thing without spoiling the plot: you're in for one hilarious road trip!<br /><br />[[ASIN:B000RK3JOC An Abundance of Katherines]] has a little bit of everything:  adventure, humor, math, verbal games, little-known historical facts, and humorous tales of boy/girl relationships as the boys begin to learn more about the opposite sex.<br /><br />Green is such a masterful storyteller with a talent for creating believable characters, I couldn't put this book down. I hope he writes a sequel because I'd like to have some more fun adventures with Colin and Hassan.<br /><br />This hardcover version was published by Dutton Juvenile in 2006, but the paperback is due for release in August 2008. Since it's to be listed at $3.99, I suggest waiting until then to read it.  What a bargain!<br /><br />A final note: This is one of those YA books geared for adults too. I'm not the only one who enjoyed it; many of the rave reviews are from adults. I would have given it five stars, but in a few places it was not as smooth as it could have been.<br /><br />Film rights to John Green's Printz-award-winning first book, [[ASIN:B000BPG2ME Looking For Alaska]], were acquired by Paramount Pictures, with production in its early stages.<br /><br />Reviewed by: Betty Dravis, 2008<br />author of: [[ASIN:1932586296 The Toonies Invade Silicon Valley]]f boy/girl relationships as the boys begin to learn more about the opposite sex.<br /><br />Green is such a masterful storyteller with a talent for creating believable characters, I couldn't put this book down.

B00000E4OJ|4.0|The earlier Schubert symphonies are New wine in Old Bottles, and pose a challenge for even the greatest conductors. Since they are (mostly) constructed on a Haydn/Mozart time-scale, it is tempting to 'classicize' these works by playing them as if they WERE Haydn or Mozart - ignoring the new, more rustic, more expansive nature of their melodic and harmonic content. On the other hand, one can fall into the trap of savoring some of those movements too romantically, thereby pulling them out of shape. That being said, I happen to disagree MORE with the 'classicizing' approach to Schubert's 1st through 6th. That is to say, if I must choose between an imbalance favoring the Bottles or the Wine, I'll take the wine, thank you. Eric Fenby put it this way : &#34;The formative works of an original mind are always interesting when played in the spirit of that mind's increase.&#34; (FENBY ON DELIUS, 1996 ed., pp. 144-45)<br /><br />The authenticist Bruno Weil takes the 'classicizing' approach to its outer limit :  he plays even the UNFINISHED as if it were by Stamitz,  Quantz - or, at any rate, some Rococco work.  But the fine line between classical poise and romantic expansiveness runs almost (but not exactly) evenly through these six Symphonies, fluctuating nearly imperceptably from work to work. For this reason, each of these works (no less than the UNFINISHED and GREAT) must be approached as its own sound-world, in terms of structure, harmony and melodic content. Otherwise, you get something sounding like either second-drawer Mozart or weak Beethoven.<br /><br />Sir Thomas Beecham was a master of these earlier works (except for the 4th, which he never recorded, although an air-check of his live 1954 RPO performance - the only one of his career - may yet turn up, as his live 1954 'GREAT' indeed has). In addition to his inner identification with Schubert's poetic moods and shadings, what enabled him to successfully advocate these Symphonies, perhaps more than anyone else in his time, was<br />1) his consummate mastery of the polished Mozartean turn-of-phrase<br />2) his vast experience with Delius (the ULTIMATE Nature Poet of music), which rendered him &#34;in sync&#34; with the rustic, nature-poetry of Schubert. But occasionally, even Sir Tommy could fall down in this territory.<br /><br />In terms of commercial recordings, Beecham's chief contemporary rival, in half the early Schubert Symphonies was Eduard van Beinum who, with the Concertgebouworkest, recorded the Third through Sixth (but, sadly, NOT the First & Second). If Beecham was  &#34;beauty, charm and poetry,&#34; then perhaps Van Beinum was &#34;unassuming purity, beauty and poetry.&#34;  This works especially well in the 3rd Symphony (more on that, later).<br /><br />In going through each performance in this set, my subjective standard has been this:  whether or not it possesses enough energy, focus, beauty of playing, and feeling for that Symphony's unique DNA (for lack of a bettter term) - such that it can make me forget my other favorite versions. Overall, Kertesz's 1st, 2nd and 3rd fall short of this: they strike me as Boxed Set Performances. (That is, &#34;The Company wants to put out a complete boxed set, and we have X number of allotted sessions, so let's get through them shall we.&#34;) In any case, Kertesz seems to get better with each successive symphony - that is, in order of composition, not of recording.  (The 1st through 3rd and the 6th were recorded in October 1971; the 4th and 5th in April 1970; and the Overtures, the UNFINISHED and the GREAT are from November 1963.)<br /><br />SYMPHONY NO. 1: This dates from 1813, when Schubert was only 16, and one year away from composing his first songs of genius. And yet, this Symphony's second movement is generally regarded as Schubert's first, truly characteristic lyrical outpouring. Kertesz takes it at a disappointingly brisk tempo, which is partially alleviated by the Vienna Philharmonic's magnificent tone. But overall,this version cannot hold a candle to the 1953 Beecham / RPO, where the innate personality of this early work is magisterially coaxed forth, via Beecham's rapport with his players and his painstaking turns of phrase.  Still, Beecham makes no attempt to gloss over, but rather brings out, sonorities and several moments of color which clearly descend from the Mozart 40th.  Schubert's compositional personality is indeed there, but aside from the length and breadth of the first movement, he has hardly begun to grapple with the challenge of being &#34;symphonic&#34; in the time of Beethoven.<br /><br />SYMPHONY NO. 2: Johannes Brahms compared this symphony to a stretch of grass, dotted with so many flowers that you could not avoid crushing a few underfoot as you walked by. It is intensely melodic, reeks of Spring, and in spots anticipates the fleet, gossamer textures of Mendelssohn. Kertesz's interpretation is a bit more vital than with the 1st symphony. And because Kertesz takes the rarely played first-movement repeat, we get to hear its brief-but-deft first-ending transition (we get to hear several of these, in this cycle). Still, this movement works better without the repeat. Kertesz does not quite equal the heady atmosphere and style of either the 1949 Munch / Boston (on an old RCA EP set) or the 1954 Beecham / RPO.<br /><br />SYMPHONY NO. 3 : This is smaller in time-scale and more polished than the 1st and 2nd. Throughout the early symphonies, Kertesz tends to take the Menuettos so briskly that, in order to offer contrast in the Trio section of these movements, he is compelled to make gear shifts into slower tempi which sometimes work, sometimes do not. (In this symphony, they DO work.) The Finale is rather Rossinian, and invites felicious playing from the Vienna Philharmonic.<br /><br />Beecham's RPO 5th and 6th are, deservedly, well-loved classics.  But to my ears, his 3rd is somewhat heavy-footed and very nearly smacks of taffy-pulling, i.e., romantically making more of this small-scale work than Schubert may have intended. Overall, the tempi in Eduard van Beinum's 1955 Concertgebouw recording may come a bit of a shock, after the more leisurely Beecham.  But this enables him to cover the first movement WITH the expositional repeat, in just slightly more recording time than Beecham takes it WITHOUT the repeat.  And unlike parts of Kertesz's 3rd, it all comes off as NATURAL - that is, with no air of special pleading.  In any case, van Beinum's 3rd, which to my ears is even more exquisitely played, has become my favorite.  To dredge up an overworked Schubertian metaphor, van Beinum's 3rd may be to Beecham's, what the fleeting-but-powerful scent of a REAL clump of lilacs is to long-longering lilac perfume.<br /><br />SYMPHONY NO. 4 : Kertesz broadens his overall approach to turn in a beautifully paced first movement, and he does nicely with the Finale and what William McKnaught described as the 'country walk' of the second movement. (Its melody recalls the Andante of Mozart's 39th and, reoccuringly, the phrase-ending-tag of &#34;...morte mi da&#34; from DON GIOVANNI !) But Kertesz nearly falls off his horse in the Menuetto, which is taken at a Tally-Ho-The-Fox kind of clip - necessitating one of those Trio-section gear shifts into a slower tempo. To my ears this jars a bit, but some may like it. My favorite Schubert 4th remains the 1961 Maazel / Berlin.  There, the 'country walk' really is just that; the Menuetto is a MENUETTO (not a Tarantella); and the outer movements, while kept reasonably taut, are given enough time to beguile the listener with their lyricism.  Eduard van Beinum's 1952 Concertgebouw version, my runner-up favorite, just misses first place due to its uncharacteristically stodgy, meat-and-potatoes Menuetto.  Still, EvB's way with this movement has an undeniable, peasant charm (think &#34;wooden clogs, clunking about on a pine floor&#34;).<br /><br />SYMPHONY NO. 5 : This is generally the most technically polished and popular of the early Schubert  Symphonies, and described as &#34;ineffibly Mozartean&#34;. True enough, but passages such as the Minuet's Trio are more Rustic than Salon - and, in fact, most performances of the Schubert 5th tend to short-change the Rustic. (This is even the case in Beecham's 1937 LPO and 1958-59 RPO performances - wonderful though they are.)  My preferred 5th is Fritz Busch's  1949 Winterthur performance (now available on GUILD); without sacrificing ensemble discipline in any way, it still captures the Rustic side of this symphony better than any other.  Kertesz comes in a close second, striking a near-perfect balance between the Salon and the Rustic - thus out-performing both of Bohm's DG performances (Berlin & Vienna), with even better playing and sound. Eduard van Beinum's 1946 Concertgebouw set has a scintillating first movement; a beautiful, but strangely slow-paced second movement (strange, because even in Bruckner's Adagios,  EvB was not one to dawdle like this); a GEMUTLICH Scherzo & Trio (the Decca master of which was apparently damaged, leaving some 'dropouts' - only partially restored, at least on the Dutton transfer); and a deft Finale.<br /><br />SYMPHONY NO. 6 : One of music's Received Opinions is that not until the UNFINISHED does the 'mature symphonic Schubert' show himself. AU CONTRAIRE: as I see it, the 'mature symphonic Schubert' first raises his head in the outer movements of the 6th (and perhaps as early as the first movements of the 1st and 2nd  Symphonies). That is to say : the challenge of following (or being contemporary with) Beethoven is being faced; things are expanding, and this sexy, buxom Fraulein of an early Romantic Symphony cannot quite fit into her old Mozartean 'corset'. Still, this has not prevented even some great conductors from trying to squeeze Fraulein Sechste (Miss Sixth) into such a corset. If you prefer this kind of approach, then van Beinum's 1957 Concertgebouw (on Philips) may be the most successful 6th on record.  (While not granting our Fraulein a new, Romantic party dress, at least EvB allows her a larger corset, i.e., in which she can BREATHE.)  Bohm makes a noble effort in the same direction, but it does not quite come off.<br /><br />Beecham's 1955 RPO Sixth makes as strong a case for this work as anyone has. (In pacing the Finale, he is even more successful in his 1944 LPO version, where, sadly, even Sir Tommy's masterful conducting must fight its way through sound quality which - reagardless of WHO has done the transfers - is sub-par, even for 1944.)  But Kertesz has probably given us the most successful hi-fi/stereo realization of the Sixth since Beecham.  The music never sags, and yet throughout, Fraulein Sechste is given enough leisure to shake out her tresses and radiate her rustic,  slightly naughty charm.  And there IS more leisure, here: unlike Beecham,  Kertesz takes the first & final movement repeats - which can be a mixed blessing, given the occasional awkward patches in these movements.<br /><br />The three overtures, scattered throughout this box, are also must-haves. In the early Overture to DES TEUFELS LUFTSCHLOSS (which falls merely two catalogue numbers ahead of SYMPHONY NO. 1), Kertesz massages the weak middle section such that it can at least bear the company of the stronger outer sections, and so we can enjoy the whole thing without reservation. Kertesz and the Viennese are astounding in the ITALIAN and FIERABRAS Overtures; the FIERBRAS, in particular, exudes a Furtwanglerian sense of awe and spaciousness.<br /><br />Sadly, Kertesz appears not to have recorded the ROSAMUNDE Overture and Incidental Music.  Fritz Lehmann's 1953 DG-Berlin set is a winner, if you want it all.  And of course, Furtwangler's live 1953 Overture is stupendous and spacious. But for REAL enchantment (and no fooling), leave no stone unturned to locate Van Beinum's 1952 Overture, Intermezzo No. 3 and Ballet Music No. 2.  The Overture can be found in the &#34;Volume 1&#34; Universal box of EVB's Deccas; the remaining two items are only available (with the Overture) on a Japanese Decca CD.  But do whatever you have to do, this side of the law, to get it...The famous keening woodwinds and exquisite strings of EVB's Concertgebouworkest were at their post-war peak, and you could almost smell the forest.<br /><br />The opening of the UNFINISHED is so softly played that it is nearly inaudible. But the INTENSITY is there, and from this point onward, we encounter perhaps the greatest stereo UNFINISHED ever recorded. Certainly this is the only UNFINISHED that made me (temporarily !) forget van Beinum on the one hand, and Furtwangler on the other. The Vienna Philharmonic, in 1963, still retained that legendary burnished tone which one can hear in the Solti RING. (Beginning in the mid-1960s, many of the older players who dated back to the pre-war days, began to retire, and their unique sound was soon gone forever.) Only Furtwangler, in his live 1952 Berlin UNFINISHED, breathes more naturally and deeply.<br /><br />Finally, the GREAT : I am tempted to let this one-word caption stand for and by itself. (Why try to describe the ineffible?) Still, I will say that this ain't no &#34;cooly-chiselled, classical&#34; approach to the GREAT (as Philip Hart described Fritz Reiner's live GREAT). It is BIG, full-bodied and leisurely, but it never lacks underpinning rhythmic tension. This is all-important in the GREAT which, unlike Schubert's other Symphonies, has no real points of repose. Still, the sheer tonal beauty of the Viennese, especially in the second movement, conjures an illusiuon of such repose, while remaining IN TEMPO : amazing ! In fact, Furtwangler has almost met his match.  (Still, to this writer, there remains no greater GREAT than Furtwangler's 1942 Berlin performance - on disc, vinyl, tape, or cylindrical foil for that matter.) Eduard van Beinum's live 1950 Concertgebouw is closer to the 'classicizing' approach, while still remaining true to the spirit of this Symphony. Szell took an even more 'classical' take on the GREAT with his magnificent Cleveland Orchestra - adding an exciting, if rather nasty, edge to the proceedings. (One of Szell's fascinating theories was that Schumann, not Schubert, really invented the Romantic Symphony. Did this perhaps compel him to 'classicize' the Schubert GREAT, after the fact?  And would this render the UNFINISHED &#34;un-Romantic&#34; - or at least &#34;pre-Romantic&#34;?)<br /><br />It would be a musical grace if Universal put out a 2-CD &#34;Originals&#34; set of Kertesz's Schubert, with the following (the timings WOULD fit):<br /><br />DISC 1: the 5th & 6th, the FIERABRAS & ITALIAN Overtures<br />DISC 2: the UNFINISHED & GREAT.<br /><br />These performances alone make this set indispensible.but passages such as the Minuet's Trio are more Rustic than Salon - and, in fact, most performances of the Schubert 5th tend to short-change the Rustic.

055358894X|5.0|There are a number of things that make this an excellent fantasy book.  The characters are interesting and fun, but they still have flaws; after all, they are thieves.  There is humor and tragedy, and the sheer pleasure of seeing how Locke's various schemes play out.  This book contains both a main story arc and numerous flashbacks, and I was surprised to find that I enjoyed both sections; normally when a book has split storylines, I'm always skipping to get back to the narrative that I find more interesting.    The story deals with the ingenious Locke Lamora and his small band of followers who has been trained since childhood to rob the rich through elaborate confidence schemes.  The first half of the book details Locke's childhood and latest plan, and is quite entertaining.  About halfway through a strange figure arrives into the underworld of this city, and things in general start to go very sharply downhill.  There is also some magic involved here, although I thought that was one of the weaker aspects of the book, as it was not very well explained.    Although I would recommend this book to anyone who likes fantasy and good writing, you should be aware that this book contains a significant amount of profanity.  Although I personally didn't enjoy that aspect of the book, I understand the purpose it served, and it didn't detract significantly from the book.  Overall, a great mix of exuberant fantasy and realistic elements.

0066620996|4.0|Jim Collins has done everyone a favor by writing this book. That's right. Everyone. This is not just a book about business, although it is of course true that the research done for this book was conducted in the corporate world. Nevertheless, Collins points out very early in the book (p. 15) that the book is not strictly about business but rather timeless principles of good to great.    One cannot help but be impressed with the thoroughness of the research itself. There are about 40 pages in the appendices explaining the research project (I'm still wondering where appendices 3-4 and 6-7 went, however). The goal was to find out what differentiated companies that became \\"great\\" from companies that were merely \\"good.\\" In other words, this is not a book about how to succeed in business; this is a book about how to excel in business (and in anything else for that matter).    The principles of greatness begin with \\"Level 5 Leadership.\\" Collins' identification of great leaders is very helpful. It's not that good or mediocre companies do not have very good and talented leaders. But the jump from level 4 to level 5 leadership is truly a great from good to great. The second principle is \\"First Who . . . Then What\\" where Collins shows that the great companies concerned themselves first with getting the right people \\"on the bus\\" before deciding on the direction the company should go. Third, great companies must be able to \\"Confront the Brutal Facts (Yet Never Lose Faith).\\" Such companies always believe that they will become the best, but they do not hold this faith in spite of the evidence. They do not ignore reality; they engage it with tenacity and optimism, even when the news around them is not all that encouraging. Fourth is what Collins calls \\"The Hedgehog Concept.\\" Great companies learn to identify what they are passionate about, what they can be the best in, and what drives your resource engine. The ability to maintain simplicity within these \\"three circles\\" and to resist the temptation to chase every possible opportunity around them is a key factor in helping companies go from good to great. Fifth, great companies maintain \\"A Culture of Discipline\\" and sixth they make use of \\"Technology Accelerators\\" (leveraging technology to accelerate momentum and not to initiate momentum. All of these principles work together to create the seventh principle, \\"The Flywheel Effect,\\" in which the business gains momentum on their way to greatness.    Collins points out that there is a moment of breakthrough that every good-to-great company achieves. \\"Ultimately, to reach breakthrough means having the discipline to make a series of good decisions consistent with your Hedgehog Concept--disciplined action, following from disciplined people who exercise disciplined thought. That's it. That's the essence of the breakthrough process\\" (p. 184). And he argues that this moment of breakthrough is attainable for all companies.    As an aside, I must say a few words that anyone wishing to read Good to Great needs to also avail themselves of Collins' work [[ASIN:0977326403 Good to Great and the Social Sectors: A Monograph to Accompany Good to Great]] (NP: 2005). Collins states that at least one third of the readers of Good to Great did not come from the business world. Many of them were involved with the social sector, and Collins is eager to show in this short work the many similarities (and a few differences) that exist in seeking greatness both inside and outside of business.    For anyone eager to explore some objective ways that they can become better in their work, I would highly recommend these two works by Jim Collins. They are enjoyable to read even for those of us who are not involved in business. I'm confident that anyone who picks up these works will find some very useful information. Perhaps that's one factor that makes a book go from good to great. I give this book 4 ½ stars.
B000X1Z0BU|5.0|There are many movies that have been made that portrayed the delicate yet simple blend of love and music. Some movies exaggerate it, and some are just bland. Once is movie that portrays that blend to excellence, if not perfection!!! The story, the dialogue, and most of all the music, all go together in harmony, thus making Once a truly remarkable film!!! A film like this comes along very rarely...Then again, one could say this kind of film comes along, only ONCE...

B000063DI8|4.0|\\"No Prayer For The Dying\\" is just one of many great albums by this band. It's no different than any other classic IM record. I'm giving it 4 & 1/2 stars. To compare, and break down every detail of it to the albums that came before or after, is trivial. The bottom line is the end result: did it rock? Does it have songs that I consider to be some of their best material? Do I continue to enjoy listening to it, over a long period of time? Does it sound like classic Iron Maiden? A big YES to all these simple questions.<br />  If you look at most of the some 200 Listmania reviews where  fans rank the band's catalogue, you'll see \\"No Prayer For The Dying\\" at the bottom of almost every list. Most fans made too big of a deal out of guitarist Adrian Smith leaving, and Jannick Gers replacing him...who cares? You still have Dave Murray in the band, letting loose with some killer solos, and Janick does just fine. Truth is, as famous as they are, I don't listen to this band for the guitar solos, it's all about the songs. Mr. Gers is good enough to get by, and that's \\"close enough for rock and roll\\". Another thing, fans make a big deal of Dickinson's vocals on this album, to my ears, he sounds great, and not any different from  their other albums...but hey-that's just me. Again, this album rocks. Also, who could argue with Martin Birch as the producer? While being a little more raw, a familiar, yet classic Iron Maiden sound is evident on this album. Good riffs, tight, concise arrangements, and there's an economy of song craft here, nothing is epic, overblown, or drawn out. The style is a little different than the 2 or 3 previous Maiden records, being not as progressive, rather it's more of a return to \\"classic\\", early days Iron Maiden, consise and more direct,  and that's why this album is effective. Favorite songs are, \\"The Assassin\\", \\"Public Enema #1\\", \\"Tailgunner\\", \\"Run Silent, Run Deep\\", and the brilliant title track. \\"Holy Smoke\\" is a great rocker with awesome lyrics. Oddly enough, the only \\"least favorite\\" for me, is the single \\"Bring Your Daughter...\\", which is the most well known track on this record. So in closing, I'll say this- before you discard this underrated gem from 1990, give it a good, loud listen. Rock out, and forget about how it compares to any other Iron Maiden cd. Keep it simple.Oddly enough, the only \\"least favorite\\" for me, is the single \\"Bring Your Daughter...\\", which is the most well known track on this record.

B00102F5WK|4.0|This well acted drama is a wakeup call to the horrors of the alleged practice of \\"extraordinary rendition\\", where persons suspected of being involved in terrorist activities are apprehended and sent to another country to be interrogated (translate: tortured)<br /><br />Based upon one cell phone record and an Islamic name, chemical engineer Anwar El-Ibrahimi (Omar Metwally) is removed from a flight from South Africa to Washington D.C. and sent to an interrogation centre, where he is questioned, beaten and abused for proclaiming his innocence.<br /><br />The movie uses flashbacks and lots of switching between characters to illustrate the chain reaction that results, and how it affects not only El-Ibrahimi, but also his wife (Reese Witherspoon), his family, an observing CIA analyst (Jake Gyllenhaal), and even his torturer, Abasi Fawal.<br /><br />In a gripping sub-plot, Fawal's daughter secretly becomes romantically involved with a young man, not knowing that his brother had perished at the hands of her father.<br /><br />Chilling at times, and maddening at others, especially when Meryl Streep's character gets involved, this movie is about the suffering of the innocent as a result of the sins of a minority.

0451213092|2.0|Follett's descriptions of people in his other books--Code, St. Petersburg, Needle--differ in many ways from the descriptions given in his name here.  An example is the (second) introduction of Glenn Jackson, a computer programmer and operator, on pg. 226 of the 1983 paperback edition.  The speaker talks about the man as if he's familiar, referring to him by his nickname \\"Rocket Man\\", without quotes.  Adulation by the narrator for this person isn't necessary for the story.  But the narrator isn't introduced as a participant in the story.  Given that this familiarity and this adulation is frequent, and annoying, in descriptions of people who worked with Ross Perot, it must be Perot dictated parts of the book to Follett.  Perot wanted to praise the people who worked for him, and it's his praise we see in the text.      So, just staying with this typical passage, the person is described as \\"a combination of a first-class mathematical brain and the ability to stay calm under stress\\".  This is the business vernacular of Ross Perot.  Follett would never independently add the articles, which is typical Texan and western U.S. talk.  His narrator would never subjectively classify someone as \\"first-class\\", which is crude and strictly businessman talk, nor refer to a character by his \\"brain\\", which is immature or adolescent jive.  Nor does Follett ever get wrong \\"duress\\" for \\"stress\\", which the narrator does here--staying calm necessarily precludes being stressed, nor can one be \\"under\\" stress.    This late passage is selected, not because the narrator gave way later to Perot's influence, but because the narrator has never seemed to let up, despite reader hopes, in his subjection to that influence.  The narrative is just brimming in many other ways with irrelevant accounting. It keeps accounting for circumstances that have little bearing on the central story, whereas in Follett's own books, elements revolve around the central plot or he excludes them as purposeless.      One ofthe least interesting passages is the several pages (100-103) in which the narrator slowly introduces each one of the ten men who form the first rescue group.  We are not interested in them until they do something.  They are just a bunch of guys sitting around discussing a rescue that is far in the future.  For instance, the narrator says that the second man in his list, Boulware, is a full five inches taller than Poche, the first man he has described.  It isn't as though Boulware is using his height in the room or will be definitely using it in a rescue--or that we could possibly remember this trivia hundreds of pages later when an actual rescue takes place.  And this section is just chock full of trivia like this.      I lost interest in the rescue of these men from a Tehran jail.  I wanted to know, instead, how Ken Follett felt when he was liberated to write his own books after this one.
B000LPQ6DE|5.0|As with virtually every movie based upon a book, Jane Eyre does not follow exactly the plot of the book but it still ends up in the same place. Even knowing how it is supposed to end, the movie is full of suspense. The acing is excellent and the actors well cast. The makers did a superb job and produced a most enjoyable movie. I watch it again and again and love it every time!
B0011HOEY4|5.0|I have worked on squads similar to what Crowe was assigned to.  They are great fun (thank god I've never had to deal with police corruption like that!!).  The movie gives a sense of the tedium involved in the investigation part. Most of the movie is about character... and there are no sterling characters in this flick!  Pretty realistic depictions actually - I'll let you draw your own conclusions... My only comment really is that its a good way to spend a couple of hours - Cinematography is great, period vehicles, clothing, etc... are dead on.  Of course the acting is top notch... I definitely recommend!    All the best,    Jay
B000YIGNKE|5.0|This is my favorite of all the versions of Persuasion. The acing is superb and the actors are well suited to their roles. The DVD contains additional scenes not shown on television - important scenes, too. I can't imagine why they were omitted from the television version. This is a movie to be watched over and over again. I think Jane would be pleased with the result.
B000N6TX1I|2.0|I had heard good things about this movie so I had high hopes for it.  However, after watching it I was very disappointed.<br /><br />In the 2020's, humanity loses fertility and no one has had a baby in 18 years.  (However, this mysterious malady does not seem to have affected any other life form such as dogs, cats, livestock, etc. since they are abundantly present.)  The main character gets corralled by an old girlfriend (who evidently belongs to some underground terrorist organization) into escorting a young woman to some unspecified location to meet up with some unknown group called \\"the Human Project.\\"  We don't know why the pregnant woman has to go anywhere, what she will do when she gets there, or why such a miracle can't be revealed to the public, other than that \\"the government\\" would \\"take the baby and claim that it was born from a white woman\\" (as though they're worried about who gets \\"credit\\" for having the baby - and since the pregnant woman is black, there's a good chance the baby will be black).  (Wouldn't any woman who is able to have a child in such a situation be of great interest to all of society in her own right?)  The main character needs to procure some crucial \\"travel papers\\" for the pregnant woman's exodus, but after the travel papers are obtained, they are never used or referred to again during the movie.  The remainder of the movie is mostly just a series of running gun battles as the main character and the pregnant woman run from one ambush to another (during some unspecified \\"uprising\\"), and they can't trust anyone, everyone is trying to \\"get\\" them (even people in their own group).  Occasionally, however, complete strangers spontaneously help them just from the goodness of their own hearts, including a large group of soldiers who just \\"stop the battle\\" for a moment to let them walk peacefully through and go on their way like nothing happened, and then resume their battle.  Finally, the main character and the pregnant woman get a boat and sneak off to sea, to meet up with a ship from the \\"Human Project.\\"  Just as the ship arrives, the main character reveals that he has been shot (somewhere along the way, we don't know when - he has been strenously rowing a boat for miles and miles at sea, but only suddenly starts bleeding all over the floor of the boat) and drops over dead.  Here, the movie ends.<br /><br />As the end credits started, I thought \\"is that all there is?  What kind of stupid story is that?  I'm glad I didn't waste money on it at the theater.\\"<br /><br />This movie is a waste of time.  My impression is that a group of nihilists wanted to make a movie about old hippies with British accents shooting guns and swearing alot, thinking it was something \\"profound.\\"  They needed a few less philosophers involved, and a few more screenwriters who can tell a coherent story.to sea, to meet up with a ship from the \\"Human Project.\\"  Just as the ship arrives, the main character reveals that he has been shot (somewhere along the way, we don't know when - he has been strenously rowing a boat for miles and miles at sea, but only suddenly starts bleeding all over the floor of the boat) and drops over dead.

0679746323|2.0|One shouldn't doubt that Jung Chang has reason to despise Mao, having lived through the effects of his reign. Mao himself certainly left plenty of evidence of his tyranny. The problem is that the vendetta is so obvious that it reaches self-parody after a couple hundred pages. The authors purport to know Mao's actual thoughts at specific times, suggest that he deserves the blame (if that's the proper word) for Stalin's death, and take an obvious relish in describing Mao's incompetence regarding such as language acquisition and management. Don't base all of your knowledge of the subject on this single source.
0143038583|5.0|Like An Inconvenient Truth, The Omnivore's Dilemma is a wake up call to the realities of the present day and a warning that our current lifestyles are unsustainable.<br /><br />The Omnivore's Dilemma brought to mind another book--the classic, [[ASIN:0142000663 The Grapes of Wrath (Centennial Edition)]]by John Steinbeck. Published in 1939, The Grapes of Wrath took place during The Great Depression. I recently re-read the book and was struck by how connected to the earth most Americans used to be.<br /><br />In the past two hundred years, America has gone from a mostly rural population to a country where the majority of the nation lives in cities, suburbs or exurbs. In \\"the olden days,\\"people farmed, hunted and fished; they made their own clothing, food and shelter. People were attached to the land and to nature. In The Grapes of Wrath we see how many farming families in the Midwest were forced out of their homes. Through one character's experience, we are shown how the pain of leaving his beloved land and home was so devastating that it literally killed him.<br /><br />Contrast that to how disconnected so many of us are to the food we eat, the environment and the welfare of animals today. We actually need a book to tell us where our food comes from!<br /><br />I finished this book with a renewed commitment to growing my own vegetables and for purchasing as much food as I can from local farmers.<br /><br />Author of the award winning book,[[ASIN:0977963306 Harmonious Environment: Beautify, Detoxify and Energize Your Life, Your Home and Your Planet]]

Eckhart Tolle presents difficult to comprehend subjects in simple to understand language. However, do not expect that this \\"easy read\\" will result in instant enlightenment. He sets the basics down, it is up to the reader to absorb and act upon the lessons.<br /><br />I always leave a weekend workshop at my spiritual teacher's ashram on a natural high. This book gave me that same feeling. It is a wonderful book to help guide you on your spiritual journey.<br /><br />A New Earth guides the reader further along the path with excellent commentary.

B00000612P|5.0|Considered Rod Stewart's masterpiece today, Every Picture Tells a Story truly shines from beginning to end.  While it's completely UNTRUE this is the best album he ever made, we can't deny how good the quality of the material is.    Everyone knows the title song with its fast rocking pace and rough-around-the-edges vocals.  \\"Maggie May\\" is an overplayed classic, but still, a classic.  Everyone likes to memorize the lyrics because the song is considered one of the greatest songs of all-time.  \\"Mandolin Wind\\" may be tagged as a forgotten beautiful favorite.  The delicate and meaningful vocals in \\"Reason to Believe\\" is enough to make grown men cry.  \\"(I Know) I'm Losing You\\" is similar to the title song with the vocals and heaviness and dirtiness in the guitar work, and \\"Seems Like a Long Time\\" reminds me of Carole King with the piano playing.  \\"That's All Right\\" takes us back to the Faces with the bluesy delivery in the vocals and guitar work.      Overall, great album, but Never a Dull Moment is slightly better.
B000N6TYLW|1.0|I have never been so disappointed.  All throughout Season 7, I cursed myself for watching what had become a watered down, slow and painful version of this previously outstanding series.  But how could I not find out what happened to the most beloved characters of modern television?  Season 7 had the patina of all of the limp \\"WB\\"/\\"CW\\" shows - colorless, with unfortunate story lines and bad dialogue that left a bad taste after the rich seasons of Stars Hollow's past.  Buy Seasons 1-5, watch them again and again.  But be warned - Season 6 starts to show wear around the edges, and Season 7 is like Frodo's return from his adventures.

B000026OW3|5.0|As mentioned by other reviewers - Rubinstein was the best interpreter of Chopin. Period. Even for the non-trained, amateur ear - other performers just do not sound as the grand maestro. Chopin obviously needs a professional in order to be fully enjoyed.  I find it amusing and even ironic that the best Chopin interpreter - Rubinstein - was a Jew, while the composer was known to have some anti-semitic tendencies...  The only problem with this collection is that it contains several less than perfect recordings. But then the performance is so good that one may forgive this minor inconvenience. And to be honest the majority of the CDs are excellent.  Very melodic, extremly romantic, perfectly performed and almost an excellent recording. GREAT BUY !
B0001KU93C|5.0|django is another example of the bizzare fact that the italians can make better westerns than the americans. django is one of the best westerns ive ever seen. while its not nearly as good as the good, the bad and the ugly(a film wich i personally think is flawless)its stil loads of fun. django is a traveling stranger who drags a coffin containing a western style minigun. he ends up in a small town run by a corrupt racist and his band of red masked henchmen. as you may have guessed django ends up battling these baddys and saves the day so to speak. theres also a mexican revolutionary(or something like that)who django helps battle the red hoods and steal a fortune in gold from. while the plot isnt incredibly original, the film is still interesting and you never find yourself confused or bored with the story. the film never really slows down. sure it takes a bit of a break in the middle but its never boring. the film if fueled by some pretty cool action scenes including a large gunfight with the red hoods where django kills nearly all of them with his machine gun. this being a western from the 60's dont expect bullet holes or realistic death acting when someone is shot, but thats okay because this film doesnt have to be realistically violent to entertain. django is a true western masterpeice that should not be missed. it isnt a masterpeice by serious film critic standards(not that there opinion matters, nor mine)but it is certainly a classic film that will have you singing along to its extremely catchy theme song. very, very fun movie, definately dont miss django.
B0010V4TZU|4.0|The debut LP from Vampire Weekend is an album that will likely be stuck in your stereo, iPod, head, or music-vehicle of choice for a minimum of 3 weeks. The songs are immediate, catchy, and have a sense of familiarity to them that grabs your ear upon initial listen and does not let go. The first few tracks of \\"Masnard Roof,\\" \\"Oxford Comma,\\" and \\"A-Punk\\" are by easily the most solid cuts on the record (not to say that the rest of the tracks are bad, but just simply not as superior as the first few).    I am a bit of an audiophile and enjoy all kinds of music, but am typically hesitant about sharing some tunes I am diggin' on with less enthusiastic/open people in my life. However, this is an album I feel like I could give my friends (or even, *gasp* my parents) and they would be able experience some enjoyment from it.    While I think this an excellent record, I am somewhat skeptical of Vampire Weekend's shelf life. I do not really see where they will go from here as far as growth is concerned and the songs, while catchy, are not emotional enough to bear repeated listens beyond the introductory periods. I feel as though other \\"hot\\" bands like Clap Your Hands Say Yeah were a few years ago have a bit more diversity and creativity to their sound. This album may be a flash in the pan, but I would happy if Vampire Weekend gave me another 3 weeks of bop-a-long tunes to drive to work to down the road.
0312360266|4.0|It's a typical school day for Zoey.  Her boyfriend got drunk during a game, again, and her best friend tells her to \\"go easy on him.\\"  Then the unexpected happens.  A vampyre appears and marks Zoey.  Vampyres have a crescent moon marked on their foreheads, and the moment someone is marked, he or she has to join the House of Night -- a boarding school for vampires -- if he or she has a chance to survive.  Zoey's mark is different; it's colored in.  What does it mean?  Is she a freak among the freaks?  The House of Night is not unlike your typical school, really.  You get classes, you learn things, you make friends -- only that it is much, much darker and sinister than any other boarding school.  Zoey Redbird, who has inherited her strong Cherokee features from her cool grandmother, has to put up with a sexy and hateful girl suitably named Aphrodite, leader of the Dark Daughters, and come to terms with her reluctant attraction for tall, dark and gorgeous Erik, whom she meets during a, uh, very compromising position.  As if being marked and joining a dark boarding school weren't traumatic enough, Zoey is experiencing bloodlust and powers that someone so recently marked shouldn't experience.  Does her colored-in mark have anything to do with that?  There are some twists throughout the novel.<br /><br />This is a great startup for an entertaining YA paranormal series.  I've missed Stephenie Meyer's Twilight books and was craving something similar.  Both serials involve vampires, but the similarities end there.  This one has its own unique voice.  P.C. and Kristin Cast (mother/daughter team) have created quite a dark, unique and erotic world in the House of Night.  Aphrodite is a great opponent and I look forward to reading more about her.  Zoey is a great heroine: intelligent, intuitive and mature beyond her teen years.  Erik and her other friends are somewhat underdeveloped and I hope to read more about them in future installments.  I'd also like more input on Neferet (the High Priestess) and Zoey's grandmother.

That said:   I've always loved 'Roll Over Lay Down', the beginning track on this album.  It starts with a thumping bass line and excellent blues guitar licks dancing all over on top it.  The chorus:  very infectious, hitting a hard boogie groove.  What follows are some mesmerizing guitar solos that add a lot of texture to the song before it goes back to the beginning hook.  This song is a Quo staple!      Unfortunately, after this song, the album catapults itself into lethargy.  The songs aren't as catchy or interesting.  While there's still a boogie element to the playing, the hard edginess is gone in place of hippy-flavored fluff that just seems to drag.       'Forty Five Hundred Times', the album's closer,  does come close to   the greatness of 'Roll Over Lay Down' but it takes a while before it builds momentum.       For those looking for good heavy Quo albums, I recommend 'Dog of Two Head' and 'Ma Kelly's Greasy Spoon' - these are definitely more raw and energetic servings of the band's signature hard 'boogie' rock style. After that, you might also want to give the album 'Quo' a try - which is probably their heaviest but not their best in terms of songwriting.
B00004TBWR|4.0|For some reason, this has a place in this crazy world of our as being the ultimate American rock `n' roll album, because it's a concept album (albeit a veeeery loose one), the lyrics are about the American South, and... well, you lost me there. In a way, I can understand why this is treated with such reverence: correct me if I'm wrong, but I believe that in 1969 the only other American who had ever put out concept albums was Frank Zappa, and most of his were harshly critical of the blue-collar U.S. o' A. I guess the crazy Yanks just needed a Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band of their own. The record really has its moments, but there's also a lot of pointlessness. Exhibits A and B are the instrumentals. Creedence has no place doing instrumentals. There ain't a single virtuoso in the group, and they don't even have good atmosphere, something extended workouts like \\"I Heard it Through the Grapevine\\" or \\"Graveyard Train\\" were packed with. I suppose the instrumentals in question (\\"Poor Boy Shuffle\\" and \\"Side o' the Road\\", if you were interested) are listenable, but they're also rather boring. Also uninvolving is the group's cover of Leadbelly's \\"Cotton Fields\\", and \\"Feelin' Blue\\" is \\"Keep on Chooglin'\\" all over again - a failed attempt to stretch one catchphrase out to a whole song. Okay, so now that I undoubtedly have everyone from every American rock magazine coming at me with torches, pitchforks, and other weapons, let me attempt to make amends. The remaining six songs rule. \\"Fortunate Son\\" really is one of the great protest songs, a powerful statement with an equally powerful riff, while \\"Down on the Corner\\" is a fun rocker that makes the best of its non-traditional percussion and jazzy guitar solo. Those two turned out to be two of the biggest hits of the group's career. But that's not all! Another protest, this one more creepy than angry (\\"Effigy\\") is also one of the group's most successful extended \\"nightmare mood pieces\\". \\"It Came from the Sky\\" is crisp, punchy, and funny. \\"Don't Look Now (It Ain't You Or Me)\\" is an excellent blues-rocker with tinges of regret. Lastly, their version of \\"The Midnight Special\\" is quite successful, mainly due to Fogerty's stirring vocals. So while it's not the great American masterpiece many think it is, it's still an efficient, emotional album.hy, and funny. \\"Don't Look Now (It Ain't You Or Me)\\" is an excellent blues-rocker with tinges of regret.

B000ZLFALI|5.0|This is a review for those who don't mind a glimpse inside. Wow! I occasionally have had fantasies play out in my mind about a song that comes to life. People, or some sort of characters, sing and dance in a perfect manifestation of the feeling of the music. Yeah, like a musical or a music video . . .  but they never seem to play out as well as they do in my head. Until Across the Universe! The (mainly) old Beatles tunes (meaning of the songs intact) are brought to life in a touching drama, where the actors lines are the lyrics to the songs. But again, not like a musical. Much more earthy and real. You are totally moved, and want more. It's reminiscent of Cop Rock, the short lived Steven Bochco police drama where the cops broke into song and dance after a tense moment of drama. UTTERLY REFRESHING. This is out-of-the-box film making at its best.<br /><br />Just for those who HAVE seen it: Wouldn't it have been cool if when the girl came in through the bathroom window they would have continued the Joe Cocker theme with the song of the same name. How did they miss that cue!? And, at the end, when Jude saw Lucy on the rooftop, I would have loved to see him make a matrix style leap (in full-on bullet time) to her balcony. Yes, it would have been outside the confines of the movie's motif, but it would have worked, just as Tarantino got away with it in Pulp Fiction when Uma Therman painted the animated square with her fingers in the convertibel with John Travolta.
B000T9OP7G|5.0|I think this show is one of the best and original Fox has come up with in quite some time.  I love seeing strong female leads and Summer Glau is obviously a break out star who plays that role almost as well as Sarah Michelle Gallar did during the Buffy years. Sure, there are some continuity issues with T3, but if you can over look that and enjoy this show for the original, fun ride that it is you should definitely buy this DVD. That way you'll be ready for season 2 next year.
B000H5U832|5.0|I just saw this tonite.  Great movie! Especially for kids.  Like the message that winning isn't everything.  Love the CG animation and sound.
B00011F5DK|5.0|it's a great family party game.  our family loves games from grandparents to grandchildren.  For the Christmas gift this year we all had to buy a board game for our families gift exchange.  My brother Billy bought Blokus.  A few of us sat down to play ages between 7 and 67 and it was fun, easy to play and no one got upset because they couldn't keep up and those who needed a challenge got one. Now it's March and at least 3 of us own it.  We can play whose ever house we are at.

0143038419|2.0|With all the hype and a long wait at the library, I expected more. I loved the author's style and her ability to laugh at herself. I love words too, as she obviously does--in many language--and I loved when she gave the history of their origins. That said, she was so self-absorbed, and I wasn't much interested in all the navel-gazing. Skip section two.
1594489505|5.0|I absolutely loved this story, the author is such a gifted writer.  Everyone should read this!
B0000VCZK2|5.0|Who hasn't seen these? The Alien Quadrilogy (Alien/ Aliens /Alien 3 /Alien Resurrection) digitally remastered and looking clean and as nice as an Alien film can be. The sound is well done too. Amazon is a pleasure to deal with.
0060298812|5.0|This was an absolutely great book!  I first saw the movie, then later heard from friend that there was a book.  And who knows what you can find in a book.    I loved the author Dianne Wynne Jones, from just this novel, I want to read her other many novels, particularly Castle in the Sky (Sequel to Howl's Moving Castle).  The venacular she uses is a tad confusing for those who are not familiar with briticism, but nonetheless, it was interesting!    As most movies based on books, things normally get left out.  And boy, was it worth reading this.  The movie's story is different from the book, as there are more characters that contribute to the very broad story in the novel.  By reading the book, you learn more about the world of Ingary and the characters that make up that world .      I found that seeing Howl mature from a spoiled and self-centered child to a man who really cares about everyone and their well-beings. And then comes Sophie.  Her character was rather perplexing at times and I would sometimes not understand her decisions, but as the story later goes on, she becomes able to express herself better. Overall, I think the novel's character development was great and I found each and every character special in their own ways.    I would definitely recommend those who have seen the movie to take a gander at what the novel has to offer.  That means alot.  So go read it!
076792603X|4.0|Unless you are a student of art history, the omnipresent imagery of the DaVinci Code can be overwhelming. I can envision the Mona Lisa, but who can visualize all the locations and artwork described in the book?<br /><br />This is a very well done illustrated edition of the book. Many hundreds of illustrations, often more than one per page. Highly recommended if you want to read the DaVinci Code.
B00003CX8Y|4.0|Beauty and the Beast is a most own classic in my humble opinion.  As someone who watched the oringal movie tons of times I must say I was disappointed with the DVD.  First of all, when you place the DVD and hit \\"play\\" it automatically plays the \\"Special Edition\\" which is an extended version with a new musical number (and cheesy animation).  It's not a huge deal because you can change the DVD setting to play the original feature film but I feel the original should have been the default option.  Second thing that bothered me about the DVD is that some of the AUDIO WAS CUT OUT from the opening song!  Maybe it's just my DVD but I noticed two gaps in audio (since I know all the words).  The first gap is after the two old ladies say \\"that girl is strange, no question\\" and the second break in audio is after she goes to the bookstore.  The lyric \\"Look there she goes that girl is so peculiar, I wonder if she's feeling well\\" is cut out.    Aside from that, the movie is great for all ages.  The cut out audio makes me wish I hadn't gotten rid of my VHS version.
B000BDLJBU|3.0|From the picture I was assuming that your microphone jack plugged into the other end, and that this was an extension of sorts.  Nope.  This jack is a replacement for whatever jack you currently have on your microphone.  You must cut off the old one, strip the wires, and SOLDER them to this jack.  The stripped wires are very, very small and unless you do this regularly, it is actually quite challenging.  It took me three tries before I got it working, mainly because the instructions included were extremely brief and inadequate.  It was a process of trial and error to discover which wire had to be soldered where.  I finally found a short pdf from the manufacturer explaining how the wires needed to be connected.      Other the the difficulty I had in attaching it, it's a good little jack.  The one I received is not black like in the picture though.  The one I received is silver and made of metal.
1881273989|5.0|The title of the book is a little misleading.  When the group I am in started studying this book, I thought it was going to be a waste of time for me because I am not in a relationship.  Well, was I ever wrong!!!  If you have a parent, family member, co-worker, friend, or just even know anyone---then you have a relationship.  This book gives wonderful insight into understanding those around you and building better relationships.  It also helps you understand yourself better and explains why we react the way we do to seemingly innocent gestures.  Highly recommend this book, in fact I ordered it for a friend. It was so helpful, I also ordered the Love Languages for Children and for Teens.
078322933X|5.0|I knew guys like David (Mark Wahlberg) in highschool. They were always in fights, constantly breaking the law, and kept most of the student body in mortal terror. Ah, memories! These guys weren't just bullies, they were stone-cold criminals. FEAR presents an excellent view of one such super-thug in Wahlberg's character. He is a cruel, explosive keg of rage and fury. At first, when trying to woo young Nicole (Reese Witherspoon from American Psycho), David appears sweet, sensitive, and understanding. Well, it's all just a a means to an end. David only wants to have Nicole, to possess her. His sugary words in the beginning are meant only as bait. Nicole's dad (William Peterson) is suspicious of David from the start. He goes out of his way to keep him away from his daughter, which draws them closer together. Ultimately, Nicole must (and boy, does she!) see David for what he truly is for herself. Her fantasies must be shattered before it's too late. Unfortunately, David is very persistant, and will not give up so easily. He is crazy, which enables him to do as he pleases without rules, limits, or much thought. He's a scary guy! I thoroughly enjoyed FEAR and recommend it as a great thriller. Yep, I often wonder what happened to the Davids I went to school with. Prison? Dead? Or worse, are they out there now, destroying more lives as adults? Brrrr...
B00009NHC5|5.0|Wait Until Dark is hands down one of my very favorite thrillers of all time, while not a horror movie the final act plays out in horror movie fashion and it's quite obvious many horror filmmakers were inspired by it. If I were to rate my favorite horror movies Wait Until Dark would appear even if not a true horror movie. This is one of those movies that once the suspense and tension kicks in it never let's up. Wait Until Dark has this great eerie and dreadful feeling and the fact almost the whole movie is set in a house it can possibly get boring due to that. One primary setting is very tough, and the makers of Wait Until Dark pull it off to near perfection.<br /><br />The screenplay written by Robert & Jane-Howard Carrington was excellent one of the finest screenplays for any suspense/thriller. They take their time and develop the character of Susy Hendrix played by Audrey Hepburn. The rest of the characters are excellent as well. All the characters are develop well you get a feel of what they are like, but a little more could have been done with a couple. The one complaint I normally hear is why the villains didn't just rip the place a part for the doll. Granted that would possibly make more sense since Susy is blind not much she could do.<br /><br />But where would the fun be in that? Either they find the doll or they don't find the doll. When dealing with movies like this you must suspend your disbelief some what. Actually that goes for almost any movie. If everyone did what they are supposed to it wouldn't nearly be as much fun. Bottom line is certain things happen and while they might lack some logic or happen to easy it doesn't hurt the movie one bit. When dealing with this type of flick you have to overlook certain things.<br /><br />The only other complaint is why Roat played brilliantly by Alan Arkin always come back to the house in a disguise; since Susy is blind she wouldn't be able to tell what he looked like. Well common sense; he does that so nobody in the neighborhood would recognize him. I always thought it was fairly obvious why he would do that. The mental torture Susy is put through was well done and you can really feel for her. Wait Until Dark does move slightly slow, but not in a bad way. The writers take their time and develop the characters mostly Susy, so by the time the plot starts to go full force we have come to know Susy and that makes everything the more traumatic.<br /><br />Director Terence Young does an amazing job; his scenes are all well paced and always moves the movie forward either in plot or character and once the suspense really starts to kick in it's actually one of the best I have ever seen. Several times while watching the movie I was on the edge of my seat. Even on multiple viewings it still holds up well. The final act is quite scary and horrific, which I'll touch upon later. This is very Hitchcock like, but dare I say better? The suspense is some of the best you'll find and Terence Young delivers big time. He had a clear vision and it works brilliantly.<br /><br />Audrey Hepburn is one of my very favorite actresses; while I have seen a whole lot of her work I have seen enough to like her. Even before I saw any of her movies I was a fan. She was so beautiful and this charisma and charm that she has draws you to her and that's what makes what Susy goes through even worse. Seeing poor Audrey Hepburn terrorized makes it even more suspenseful. Audrey Hepburn was actually nominated for an Oscar for this movie. How she didn't win is beyond me. Her performance rates as one of my all time favorites.<br /><br />The cast was top notch; Jack Weston as Sgt. Carlino and Richard Crenna as Mike Talman both provide excellent performances. I'm a big fan of both actors and they were a joy to watch. Hepburn may be the star, but Alan Arkin is simply amazing. He's calm and cool, but a total psychopath and plays 3 roles and it's quite clear he was having a blast doing it. Some people complain about Sam Hendrix played by Efrem Zimbalist, Jr. saying that he was too cold. I totally disagree; after an accident left her blind, all Sam is doing is trying to teach her how to be dependent. Instead of doing everything for her he wants her to learn. And by him doing that in the end that is what saved Susy's life by not depending on other people to take care of her despite being blind.<br /><br />What I love so much about this movie is Susy who hasn't been blind very long and has to adjust to a new life. The villains think it's gonna be an easy task, but what she lacks in sight she makes up for in hearing and she's able to realize something isn't right. My only slight complaint is she's too trusting of Mike. Some people are very trusting and at first she has no reason to suspect him, but when she realizes something isn't quite right with Roat and Carlino she really should have suspected Mike, but it's an easy flaw to overlook.<br /><br />The final act to this movie is actually quite terrifying, like I said this isn't a horror movie, but does have horror movie elements or what would later be horror movie elements. It comes down to Roat and Susy and the showdown is quite chilling. By this time we have come too really like Susy and the fact it's Audrey Hepburn I suppose even if she wasn't developed we would still feel for her. What I love is how she takes out all the lights and its total darkness. Roat is now in a sense blind as are we the viewer. The final act Susy is pretty much the final girl, which horror movie fans should know that term.<br /><br />The showdown is downright chilling even though I already knew the outcome I was still on the edge of my seat. I kept moving around I couldn't sit still due to the suspense. Wait Until Dark also features one of the greatest jump scenes ever. I don't care how many horror movies or thrillers you have seen; even the most hardcore of fans are bound to jump. I won't give it away, but when it happens you'll know it. Even having seen the movie before I always jump at that, the first time I saw it I nearly had a heart attack. You know it's coming, but it still gets you.<br /><br />In all the reviews I have read I very rarely hear anyone mention the score by Henry Mancini; the score is one of my favorites actually and really adds to the suspense and tension and in many ways helps elevate the movie to an even higher rate of suspense. The score is very chilling.<br /><br />Wait Until Dark is one of the all time great chillers and still holds up well. Sure there might be a silly moment or two, but this movie is downright creepy and very suspenseful. It starts off a bit slow, but never boring as the characters are developed and once Wait Until Dark forges ahead the suspense never lacks and builds to a very chilling finale. This is a must see for fans of suspense/thrillers and horror flicks. Wait Until Dark truly is one of a kind. This movie has everything going for it, an excellent score, script and directing and some truly great actors.<br /><br />Trivia time; Julie Herrod who played Gloria also portrayed the character in the stage play prior to the film.t he was too cold. I totally disagree; after an accident left her blind, all Sam is doing is trying to teach her how to be dependent. Instead of doing everything for her he wants her to learn.

B00004Y87O|5.0|Oh yeah, the entirety of Manhatten island, surrounded by a 50-foot concrete wall! Just drop the convicts in and leave. Oopsy daisy! The president's plane has crashed within said mega-penitentiary! Now, it's up to total bada$$, Snake Plissken (Kurt Russell from The Thing) to rescue the prez along with the secret tape he carries. Can Snake slither his way through the roving gangs of nocturnal nutcases? ESCAPE FROM NEW YORK was to me, John Carpenter's last fully satisfying movie. Though I did love THEY LIVE, I've found his other movies after EFNY to be hit and miss. EFNY ended Carpenter's string of perfection that included DARK STAR, ASSAULT ON PRECINCT 13, HALLOWEEN, THE FOG, and THE THING. ESCAPE is also pleasing in that it's a cavalcade of Carpenter regulars like Donald Pleasence (Halloween), Charles Cyphers (Assault On Precinct 13, Halloween, The Fog), Tom Atkins (The Fog), and the ever-delectible, Adrienne Barbeau (The Fog)! It's always cool to see any of these folks together. Plus, we get Harry Dean Stanton (Alien, Repo Man) as Brain, Ernest Borgnine (from the original Willard, The Devil's Rain) as Cabbie, Lee Van Cleef (The Good, The Bad, And The Ugly), and Isaac Hayes himself as the Duke of New York! My favorite scenes include the death-match between Snake and that bearded behemoth, and any scene with Ms. Barbeau running at me! Buy this immediately, it's a bloody masterpiece...
B000001OAA|5.0|Wow!  I can't believe that it's been over a decade since I bought this CD.  Listening to this CD now brings back all the memories of the times when I listened to it almost non-stop, which is what good music is supposed to do.  This style of music was new at the time of this release and at first I remember not really liking it all that much.  Of course the first two singles (Only Happy When it Rains and Stupid Girl) were all I had to go on, and they're not the best songs on the album.  After I heard Supervixen and Vow I was sold and decided to buy the CD.  It was a great purcahse becase all the songs really grew on me and I played this CD over and over again for months!
B0014BC3C2|5.0|I cannot recommend Jericho highly enough to anybody who reads this review.  We don't have much of a choice when it comes to GREAT TV anymore and Jericho is by far high quality TV.  The writers are brilliant.  You will sit on the edge of your seat; especially for Season 2.  If you have not seen -- BUY IT.  It's a great story of what it is to be an American and how communities come together and prevail.  The characters are awesome and you will not be dissappointed.
B0000029DD|5.0|I first heard of Jeff Buckley via the ancient and defunct MuchMusic channel on Primestar satellite before it was Direct TV.  The special being broadcast was Jeff Buckley in Chicago (available on DVD at Amazon as \\"Jeff Buckley-Live in Chicago\\", highly recommended!).  When I saw that performance, I was completely blown away and decided that I must have a CD by this guy.  I went out and found the Grace album, which has been in my disc changer ever since.  This album has so many textures and redefines everything pertaining to the singer/songwriter genre.  This is a must have for not only every Buckley fan, but anyone who loves great music and a unique, inimitable voice.  High points are the songs So Real, Lover, You Should Have Come Over, and of course the grooving Last Goodbye.  The beauty lies within his cover of Hallelujah, as well as Lilac Wine and the original and haunting Mojo Pin.  Whether you buy this CD used or new doesn't really matter as long as you get it.  This is a must have, so please buy.
B000XGDO04|4.0|Singer & songwriter Adele's debut album is an accomplished piece of work. I've hinted at it one of my other reviews but I'll be clearer here: I'm particularly impressed that a singer so young (she's only 19, hence the album's title) would decide to look back to the great singers of yesteryears for inspiration as opposed to slavishly following the made-for-radio trends of her contemporaries. I know not everyone will agree with me but as of right now, the past is where the best music ever made is to be found.<br /><br />It's my kind of music in many respects, with lots of real live instruments and lots of strings. Adele shows her confidence in the quality and strength of her voice with sparse instrumentation on a number of tracks. On the album opener \\"Daydreamer\\" for instance, the only instrument is the guitar she plays as she sings. On the next track along, \\"Best For Last\\", she does something really fresh and different, singing while she plays solo bass for the most part. There are twelve songs in total, nine of these are very ably produced by Jim Abbiss, with two, including brilliant lead single \\"Chasing Pavements\\", produced by Eg White and one produced by man of the moment Mark Ronson, (with mixed results, in my opinion).<br /><br />It's all very well put together and well-intended but something's missing. It took me a while to figure out what it is and it's that old intellectual vs emotional response thing again. Intellectually, I totally appreciate, respect and even like the authenticity and artistry of what Ms Atkins has achieved here. I think she could have a stellar career ahead of her and I particularly admire the way she's (so far) refusing to conform to the stereotypes of what a female music artiste is supposed to look like. She says she's her own individual and I believe her.<br /><br />Emotionally however, she just doesn't touch me. Or more accurately, her voice doesn't. Perhaps it's a cruel or unfair comparison, but while Amy Winehouse has the ability to either make me beam from ear to ear or reduce me to floods of tears - depending on the song of course - with this particular lady, I feel nothing. I hear good music; very interesting music actually, but I feel absolutely nothing and can't honestly claim to enjoy listening to it. \\"Chasing Pavements\\" and the album closer, the piano-led, spiritual sounding \\"Hometown Glory\\" (my two favourite tracks on here) both came pretty close but not quite close enough. 3.5 stars.her make me beam from ear to ear or reduce me to floods of tears - depending on the song of course - with this particular lady, I feel nothing.

B000MRAAJM|5.0|I simply don't have words to express the magnificent achievement of doco making this series achieves. I was simply taken aback by the large number of global locations visited in each episode. You'll visit at least 4 or more different global locations in each episode, it's unheard of in doco making simply due to budget constraints. The picture quality is nuts, if your going to get this series, get it on blu ray. The pack even comes with a little pamphlet saying this series was shot using the highest possible photography available so make sure your blu ray player is upto date. A gorgeous exploration of our God given planet!
0452289963|3.0|I was so disappointed when I began reading this book. The \\"wordiness\\" of the first two chapters nearly bored me to death. I felt as though Tolle was being repetitive in his message. As I slowly approached Chapter 3, although I didn't completely change my mind or opinion, I did get more \\"into\\" what he was saying. That's when it started to sound like more than a bunch of words. I'm not sure I'll get the awakening that Tolle talks about but I will keep an open mind.
B000UJ48O0|5.0|I received my pack yesterday and I have to say the pack exudes beauty, it looks better than it does in the pictures. Just love the front cover! The pack contains all the discs, really nice pictures of the cast and episode descriptions all packed together in what seems to be like a photo album. Amazon's carrier, I think it's DHL, were horrible in their delivery. I live in Sydney, and the package arrived almost 2 weeks after the expected arrival date, just shocking, anyway I'm reviewing the box set and not DHL. A definite 5 stars from me and a must have for OC lovers!

I've also read the book and can just say read the comments because the book is worth your time. I'd still suggest you read the book also.

0790731509|5.0|Cool Hand Luke  DVD<br /><br />Paul Newman plays Luke.  A perennial loser who seems to have no purpose in Life since winning several medals in World War II.  In the beginning of the movie Luke wanders aimlessly down a street cutting the \\"heads\\" off of parking meters and keeping some of the \\"heads\\" for the few coins in them.<br /><br />Why he was cutting the heads off parking meters]<br />Luke: Small town, not much to do in the evenin'.<br /><br /> (This very same thing happened in Atlanta, Georgia last summer and nobody would tell the police who was doing it.  Obviously someone had watched the movie.)<br /><br />George Kennedy won Best-Supporting Actor Oscar as \\"Dragline\\", bull of the herd of prisoners. Dragline leads the group, running gambling and the small barracks \\"bank\\", and all the other prisoners follow his example and look to him as the source of what little self-respect they have.<br /><br />My favorite line in this movie is when Luke has tried to escape and has been beaten senseless  the warden stands over his bruised body and says<br /><br />\\"What we have here, is a failure to communicate.\\"<br /><br />Highly recommended for fans of Paul Newman and George Kennedy.<br /><br />Gunner  March, 2008
0765318741|4.0|Wow, I didn't realize how long ago this book was written!  I cannot wait to see the movie!  I have to say, I am a vampire book hater.  I just don't get into them.  I wanted to read this before the movie (because the movie caught my eye!)  I picked this up and THEN realized it was about vampires...I was skeptical to even try reading it.  However, the book was actually pretty interesting!  It is mainly a man's struggle with vampires, when he fears he's the only man left!  How crazy difficult would that be?  We find out, his daily lifes struggles in \\"vampire dealings\\"  and what is going through his mind as he tackles these unfavorable problems.  I actually enjoyed this short story and look forward to see where the movie takes this.  I can't say that I read ALL the other short stories in the book, but I AM LEGEND was worth it!
B00006GO9Q|5.0|In A Silent Way is not only one of my favorite Miles Davis albums, but it also is one of my favorite albums of all-time. This was the first Miles Davis CD that I bought and this album is a masterpiece and the music is very calm & relaxing. There are 2 songs on this album, both nearing 20 minutes bringing up to 40 minutes of music. Also, his trumpet is great on this album. I think that this album should present in the Definitive 200 list. I think for every true music fan this album should present in the collection.

B000AQJPQE|3.0|I purchased this for my 3 year old son's new Space-Themed room...He Loves it...It's Very cool looking...However...the construction is pretty flimsy, and It absolutely GOBBLES C batteries...so it will light up, but often will not turn...unless you're willing to change the batteries about every 3 days! Also, prepare to put pretty large holes in the ceiling for this product! For the price, it's OK for a three year old at bedtime...the \\"Moon in My Room\\", by Uncle Milton works much better...
B000WZAE1I|4.0|I'm not going to go into great depth with this review.  This is the type of movie (for me) that does not get old.  It has a very standard plot line that works and flows from start to finish.    It's the type of movie I will put on to make me feel better when I'm in somewhat of a down mood.
B000N6TYLW|3.0|This Gilmore Girls - The Complete Seventh Season, DVD Box set was sold at a great price. The only problems were it came in a Cardboard Box, not a Plastic Hard Case, and when you play it on Australian TV's, it had a small light, feignt diagonal lines, streaming across the screen. I think this was someing to do with PAL and NTFC TV Standards from Australia and the US.    Anyway, It made my wife happy, because she does not notice those things, and my wallet was happy too. Generally the series is quite funny and entertaining.    Amazon Customer.
0316174483|5.0|As a homeschooling mom of a preschooler and first grader, I am always looking for things that are appropriate for a wide variety of age levels. The Complete Funprint Drawing Book is perfect for homeschool art! The directions are simple enough for my just-turned-four year old to follow, but the endless variety of things to make is interesting enough for my six (and a half) year old. I am looking into more Ed Emberly books to add to our homeschool art resource collection.
B000EPFPVU|5.0|I picked this up due to another reviewer claiming the Import sounding better, well, he's wrong.  I compared it bit by bit to the US version and they're identical.  Not that there's anything wrong with the US version, it's my favorite from Tool so far and believe it's already well mastered.  But, it's always nice to have something better, especially with the amount of work and $ I put into my rig.      At least the CD cover is unique.

B000MRAAJM|4.0|We just got through the 4 disc set last weekend. Overall i was very pleased with the photography, video and audio, but i think some of the low light video work can get a little grainy at times.  The well lit time lapse and macro content is very sharp and closest to 1080p you can get.  I recommend this series if you're looking for some very unique video and photo work shot in unbelievable places from around the world.
B000MTPANQ|5.0|If one were to look at Neil Young and what he accomplished during the years that Dylan retreated into obscurity, the result would be a peek at what may arguably be the most prolific singer-songwriter in history.  While the sixties saw Dylan produce a remarkable string of landmark albums starting with  \\"The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan\\" all the way up to \\"Blonde on Blonde,\\" the late sixties to early seventies saw Neil Young take Dylan's place, opening with a remarkable self-titled solo debut album, and following it up with the stunning \\"Everybody Knows This is Nowhere\\", \\"After the Gold Rush,\\" \\"Harvest\\" and \\"On The Beach\\", the latter being arguably his greatest, and perhaps one of music's most personal and remarkable achievements.  As well, there were probably a host of songs made during that period that to this day he has not released. The speed at which Neil Young's creative fury was moving is purely witnessed on this live cd.  As he announces that he \\"will be singing mostly new songs tonight,' Neil ventures into many raw cuts of the tracks that would come to comprise these subsequent albums.  However, the main, and probably the most pivotal difference between Dylan and Young is in the ability of the listener to enter the song.  Where Dylan is without a doubt the songwriting genius of our time, and simply one of the greatest writers of the twentieth century in any form, his songs are art, to be placed on a wall and admired, pondered and looked upon from afar.  Neil, on the other hand, allows the fan to enter into every song, almost allowing the fan to swear that the song was written about them.  Neil Young has been quoted as saying something of this sort: \\"Of course, the songs are about me, but why should I exclude everyone else from them?\\"  Indeed, when Neil shares his music, he is true to his word.  In this intimate concert with Neil Young, one feels as if they are sitting right there on the stage with him; while listening to the experiences of his journey, he always allows the possibility that you have experienced them with him.

B0011NVC9I|2.0|The story begins as per the epic. It's been around for a while but this may spoil things a bit if you never read it. (In which case you may wish to skip the movie and just read it.)      A king's feast hall is repeatedly visited by a neigh invincible monster that kills and maims his people whenever they hold a celebration (enraged by the sound of the festivities). The, already well known, warrior Beowulf arrives from across the sea to do battle with the beast and is victorious ..... only to find that the beast's mother has become enraged and the real battle has only just begun........        Enter the wildly diverging plotline.       All epics are tweaked to a degree. This one suddenly sails right off the edge of the world.        Had the producers called this film something other than Beowulf, I would have classified this film as moderately good, despite the \\"Shreck\\" animation. (Hence, it gets 2 stars not one.)        However..... as it IS titled Beowulf, I was not so pleased at all.        Not satisfied with the story of the Hero of legend, hollywood pursues (yet again) the \\"complex\\" hero that they are so much in love with. Butchering an ages old saga in the pursuit of \\"complexity\\", apparently, is simply more grist for the mill.      To segregate it from the many, many other hollywood rewrites of epics, historical tales, or sundry regurgitations of works by other writers (that actually had talent), they decided not to make him a drug addict or drunkard.     A hero who overcomes drunkenness and addiction. Hmmmm......been done......alot. So, in an incredibly imaginative stroke they came up with the (new for the millenia) heroic virtues of liar and betrayer, tossing in a substantial dose of boastful fool (just in case you started to like the character).      Great role model for the kids. Start saving for the therapist while you can.      Kudos on finding an \\"origional\\" series of mandatory flaws to tack on. It made all the difference.         Can't imaginehow this epic lasted a thousand years without the rewrite.
B000P46QTA|4.0|the subtitles are very easy to read in this blu-ray format; very clear.I think it was worth the extra cost as I will watch it many times...
B000ZLFALI|2.0|Well, I like showtunes and the beetles. This movie does have some tripped out scenes that are cool and memorable parts. Unfortunately the music begins slow down and the film becomes incredibly boaring at the end, minus the last two songs at the end. It gets back to its lively self once max returns from the war but from his departure up untill then, its dull dull DULL!!!  I to thought I was judging this film to harshly so I watched it all the way through. Nope, dull and to make it go faster I skipped to the ending as I should of done from the very begining. Other then it slowing down as a herd of turtles stampeedeing through peanut butter, the pros to this film is great effects and *some* memorable songs. All this is killed by the slow ending. I was somewhat disappointed but all I have to do is skip half the ending to the final few scenes to avoid the tedious parts.
0930289234|5.0|Buy this book.  Seriously, you must.  If you've never read a graphic novel before then, believe me, Watchmen will convince you that the form has merit.  And even if you never read another graphic novel you'll still be able to say \\"I've read Watchmen\\" if the topic ever pops up, and people will respect you for it.<br />If you are a fan of graphic novels and you still haven't read Watchmen then WHAT IS THE MATTER WITH YOU?  It is an absolute masterpiece!  Everything in this book is wonderful: the characters are so perfectly realized, the world they live is so utterly convincing, and the story that unfolds is without a doubt one of the most riveting and poignant tales ever told.  Oh, and it's about superheroes.<br />Basically, this is a must-read book.  It's brilliant and I'm sure you will enjoy it.  And, trust me, you really want to be able to say that you've read it.
0452289963|5.0|\\"A New Earth\\" is a truely spiritual awakening for those looking to bring that to their lives. I felt it was very easy to read and its message of awareness hit home.

0375842381|5.0|I read the Golden Compass in 4th or 5th grade, and I have come to love the entire series. The writing is amazing and the characters and story completely come to life. I have re-read the trilogy several times and I don't feel like I have wasted any of my time. Note the 5 Star rating.<br /><br />I was slightly annoyed that every book in this set came with a sticker about the movie on it. Then even more annoyed when I found out that the Golden Compass did, in fact, have this \\"Major Motion Picture in 2007!\\" or whatever it says, printed directly on the cover....very annoying for someone who wanted the original covers, but probably unavoidable at this point, unless you buy used.<br /><br />**Now the Spoiler/Warning (no Theological disputes included - I promise)**<br />  I will be telling you what happens at the end of the Golden Compass...<br /><br />I do have a concern, however. Such as in a few other reviews, I have to say that the movie does not do the Golden Compass any justice. What I worry about is how that movie is/was being marketed. It is clearly marketed and made towards an audience of children. The books, however, are more young adult. I was a mature 5th grader, and I still found myself disturbed by the content, at times.<br /><br />Pullman is very able to pull his readers into the story and get them to care deeply for the characters. Imagine the scene in the movie where the Gyptian boy, Billy Costa, is found after being separated from his Daemon. Well, now imagine that scene with lots of character development and with explicit implications that this boy has lost his soul. He is a ghost, he can't get it back, he is no longer a person. Think of the intensity of that if it was really made clear that he did in fact, LOSE HIS SOUL! I<br /><br />The movie ends just short of pretty much the most traumatic event in the trilogy, and it cannot be avoided in either the next movie or the first book. The story would crumble. If you are a parent, and you have seen the movie and are now thinking of getting your kid(s) the books, please read them first. If you don't have time to read the whole series, at least read the last few chapters of Golden Compass - the part that was cut short in the movie - the murder of Roger by Lord Asrael for scientific and personal gain. Then decide if your child can handle the the series yet, or if maybe they should wait a little while.<br /><br />Also consider this before taking them to the second movie. The movies will have to become more intense, even if they are glossed over versions of the book like the last one was. I just remember seeing the movie and being worried that a bunch of parents were going to bring their 5-9 year olds and they would be completely scared and traumatized. If your kid is mature enough, then the books are amazing and there is a lot to learn from both the good things and the bad things that happen. If they aren't ready yet, it will just be a bad reading experience.g of getting your kid(s) the books, please read them first.

B000YPUF9W|3.0|I liked it well enough, but it absolutely felt like a link between RE: Apocalypse and the final film in the series.  The action sequences were fun.  The writing and direction leave a lot to be desired, especially in regards to characterization.<br /><br />It's a fun flick to pick up and watch for the action.  Don't expect much else.
0920668372|1.0|I was given this book as a baby gift when my son was born.  My friend said it is her daughters favorite story.  When my son was about three years old I read it to him.  BIG MISTAKE!  He became obsessed with my mortality.  He wasnt really sure what was happening at the end but he said it was really really bad.  I should have followed my first instinct when I read it and thrown it away,  I would'nt have been kept up with so many nightmares.  He just saw the cover picture as I was typing this and said \\" Never read that again!\\"
0440238609|3.0|I enjoyed the movie so I bought the book. Movie mostly true to the book. Enjoyed the added detail of the book. However, I was a bit disappointed in the trilogy as a whole. The characters are great!! Ideas for the compass and knife are great. But the plot doesn't quite fit in total. The actions of Lyra's parents are inconsistent especially at the end. Have no idea why the back cover says its a story about growing up.
0071359168|5.0|This book is a must-read for anyone trying to understand strategy, marketing and also how to write compelling books.  It is dense, intelligent and very well written.  The 20th anniversary edition has the bonus fact that the authors comment and evaluate their own thesis made 20 years ago.  Very few books and thesis would survive this test as this one did.
B000001FS6|3.0|This is a very strange album. It was released between two mega-classics: THE JOSHUA TREE and ACHTUNG BABY and seems lost with no real direction except for being a sort of documentary on the USA as evidenced by U2. Tributes to Billie Holiday, The Beatles, Gospel, Bob Dylan, Martin Luther King abound but they are not convincing in any way.  I always feel that U2 were caught between releasing a studio album but did not have enough songs or releasing a live album. And basically the album falls between two stools.  The plus side:  the studio songs are very good and it is a shame that they could not have added some B-sides along with the studio songs here to record a great album. DESIRE, ALL I WANT IS YOU, HAWKMOON 269 and WHEN LOVE COMES TO TOWN (with B.B.King) are are U2 stretching their limits. HEARTLAND is slightly bland in its chorus but the verses are very strong. VAN DIEMEN'S LAND is a rare song by The Edge with only electric guitar. Not sure why it fades out during the last verse. ANGEL OF HARLEM does not really work as a tribute to Billie Holiday but it is a very good song on its own terms  The minuses: It is unusual for U2 that they are a very exciting live act to see but on this album, the live tracks are awful and way over the top.  The live tracks suffer from ridiculous statements from Bono.  Here is a sample:  &#34;This is a song Charles Manson stole from the Beatles. We're stealing it back&#34; &#34;Pounding the women and children who run (spoken with plenty of anguish)...who run (with even more anguish) into the arms of America&#34; &#34;O.K Edge, play the blues&#34; &#34;All I have is a red guitar; three chords and the truth&#34; &#34;For The Reverend Martin Luther King, SING!&#34; &#34;Suth Efrica&#34; (from SILVER AND GOLD)  The live versions of PRIDE and BULLET THE BLUE SKY are not as good as the studio versions. The live version of I STILL HAVEN&#34;T FOUND WHAT I'M LOOKING FOR has a great gospel arrangement but goes way off the rails at the end withthe gospel soloists trying to outdo each other in vocal acrobatics and it ultimately ruins the song.  HELTER SKELTER by The Beatles is one of those songs that cannot be improved upon. The original is a true classic and U2's cover is very feeble. This is the opening track of the album and at three minutes in length, it cannot compete with the mad-cap, wild zaniness of the original. How could you even duplicate McCartney's screaming vocal and Ringo's classic line:&#34; I've got blisters on my fingers&#34;. The other cover is Dylan's &#34;ALL ALONG THE WATCHTOWER.&#34; After Hendrix, why even bother? A monotonous base line by Adam Clayton and extra self-centered verse by Bono. In the movie of the same name, Bono even spray paints graffiti in a San Francisco park during this performance which makes the song more ugly.  The one live track that could have been amazing is SILVER AND GOLD. Again it is ruined by Bono's spoken outro at the very end.  But the worst song on the album goes to GOD PART 2 which would have been a great song if it had another title and if it was only a set of criticisms by Bono. Why he decided to compare himself to John Lennon, I do not know but the title makes the song completely hollow. It was symptomatic of U2 at this time to compare themselves to the Giants Of Rock. This song has nothing to do with John Lennon's original, which was an extremely confessional and emotional song. Bono does not bare himself in any way in this song so the notion that this song is a sequel is truly absurd.  Lennon confessed 14 times what he did not believe in, culminating in THE BEATLES; it was shocking to hear this on an LP back in 1970 and the lines: &#34;I don't believe in BEATLES!&#34; and &#34;The Dream Is Over&#34; traumatised Bealtes fans everywhere. Bono does not reveal anything about himself in his ridiculous &#34;sequel&#34;.  This is one of U2'songs songs I dislike intensely, because of its title.  After the drubbing heaped on this album by music critics, U2 definitely took notice as they abandoned their fixation of the USA and headed to Germany to &#34; cut down The Joshua Tree with an axe&#34;, emerging with a very different, more grunge-like, spare  musical style on ACHTUNG BABY.
B000HWZ61Y|5.0|The best Hard Rock Album of the 80´s Remastered as it MUST Be. (Several Artists should do the same and get the same support from their record company). Is a really gift  for Def Leps Fans and music collectors.    If the original sound and vibe of this record is great, now remastered is awesome!, songs such as: Animal, Gods of War, Hysteria and also the songs that weren't singles: Run Riot, Don't shoot shotgun Sounds Amazing! You can enjoy and remember the good times on the 80's and high energy that was delivered by Def Leppard.    This CD is a MUST to be on your CD collection, the bonus tracks are very cool, all songs from Hysteria' s Studio recording  sessions are added and some cool live performance.    PD: I hope Def Lep release a 2-cd pack and remastered: merging Adrenalize(all songs)+Retroactive(all songs)+Acoustic Set (the EP -CD added on Slang: \\"Animal\\", Hysteria\\", \\"Pour some sugar on me\\")+ the songs unreleased such as the ones added on Japaneses DL versions (as\\"Into the flame\\"), 160 minutes of remastered music and hard to find songs for DL's fans.  Please, anybody knows how to send this idea to the record company or Def Leppard's  management?  Thanks!
0316010669|5.0|Blink is one of those books that has a profound effect on how you view the world. It involves a paradigm shift. Gladwell starts with three main tasks- to that snap judgments can be as good as well thought-out judgments, show when our instincts fail us and teach us that these snap judgments can be controlled.     The stories that Gladwell uses to illustrate his points are fascinating and extremely well researched. You feel like you being lead along in a gripping novel instead of reading psychological paper.     The most profound lesson that too much information can be overwhelming and severely disrupt our instinctive judgments is profound in a world where we have e-mail, cell phones, blackberries, 24-hour news, online forums - hundreds of sources of information on every conceivable topic. The most effective methods for controlling our instinctive reactions have profound and insightful ideas on how to effectively deal with the subconscious racism that lingers in our society and expresses itself in everything from criminal convictions to choosing chief executives.

0385338724|2.0|I bought this book with high expectations. Although I've never read a book by Sophie Kinsella before, I am aware of the high buzz surrounding the \\"Shopaholic\\" series. I was excited to finally get my hands in one of this funny and witty books.<br />Well, I finished the book just now and I'm disappointed. The characters are all a collage of strange individuals scattered around in a non-believable scenario. I wished there was more depth into their stories. The story itself is far fetched, Lexi smart comes across as annoying, clumsy (I can't ever imagine how she was supposed to be \\"The Cobra\\") and I can't find any sympathy for her.<br />To me, the book is 200 pages too long.<br />The only reason I gave 2 stars to the book is because it somehow entertained  me for a couple of days while I'm sick as a dog with the flu.<br />Unfortunately, Remember Me? is not so memorable.
B000PC1N54|4.0|This was a brave attempt by Franco Zeffirelli and LaScala to mount a new traditional production of Verdi's AIDA to rival the classic Emmy-and-Peabody-award-winning setting still on view by the Metropolitan Opera.  Violeta Urmana is a vocally gorgeous, well-acted Aida, and she uses her voice to stunning effect.  Roberto Alagna was seriously maligned by the LaScala \\"claque\\" - he sings a fine Radames - a little rough in the Celeste Aida, due to the timing or how new it is in his repertoire, but the rest of the opera is a revelation!  His Radames is handsome, earnest, forthright, and believable (and in great physical shape  - he even goes shirtless in the Act 1 Scene 2 prayer scene!).  Contrary to the Spanish reviewer, I thought he and Urmana had good chemistry together, but they were in a new production which was very busy, with lots of little steps and other stuff to physically negotiate. The tomb scene in particular displayed tenderness and palpable regret.  The mezzo was quite excellent, reminiscent of Giulietta Simionato in her heyday, or Dolora Zajick, still on view in the aforementioned Met production.      Three problems:  the editing, which veers from close-ups, to medium shots, with many dreamy, annoying visuals of floating, wafting fabric, to what effect I know not.  It got very tiresome after the first three or four dissolves.  Ultimately, it was unnecessary and just dumb.  The edits needed to be clear and concise, or at least somewhat coherent. The conducting by Riccardo Chailly was perfunctory; he seemed to be attempting a Muti-like visual suggestion, with the hair and the gestures, etc., but the sounds were of someone conducting from a score he had just read.  It sounded clumsy and lacked grace and subtlety.  The costume, fright wig, and makeup for Amonasro looked like a refugee from a 70's era Carol Burnett tv sketch.      Despite these criticisms, I would recommend this performance, because the singers - and Verdi's timeless work - survived with their integrity intact, and put forth an emotional, vivid story of love and regret, which made the items that didn't work small in comparison.  I just think these videos need to be reviewed before they come out for sale, because sometimes (not with this one) the releases are not worth the discs they are printed on, especially at the increasingly exorbitant prices for which they sell.
B000YIGNKE|1.0|A new adopter of Jane Austen fiction, I recently went on a campaign to watch every adaptation of my favorite novels. After watching the 1995 version of Persuasion, I must say that I am very disappointed in this recent take. Although I wish the 1995 actors were as handsome as those portrayed in the 2007 version, the 1995 adaptation is much more fluid and romantic. The actors portray the characters very well and look natural.     Although the cinematography is better in the 2007 version, it seemed very stilted and focused more on the facial expressions of each actor rather than the actual storyline. I feel it is rushed and disjointed. The music is a bit dramatic and the acting is overdone.    If you are interested in purchasing this film and have not seen it yet, I highly suggest you rent it first (along with the 1995 version) and come to your own conclusion. I am glad I did not purchase it in haste.

B000MGBRHC|5.0|Volbeat create catchy, energetic songs with plenty of metal riffery. It's as if someone replaced your bowl of Captain Crunch with lugnuts. The songs run the gamut from testosterone-fueled rock to corrosive blues to mournful ballads. An abundance of melodic rhythms makes up for a relative absence of guitar solos, and purist head-bangers will be happy to know that there isn't a single keyboard note to be found on the CD. The unique singer resembles a cross between James Hetfield and Elvis Presley. He has a twangy, resonant voice that sounds filtered through a skein of chocolate pudding. Or maybe his vocal chords are capable of vibrating like a tuning fork. All I know is I relish his voice and find myself laughing when he belts out rapid-fire vocals, such as in \\"Sad Man's Tongue.\\" The songs are pretty simplistic, without much experimentation, but they are also delightfully concise and accomplish precisely what you want in a metal album: get your foot stomping and your head a'wagging. I definitely wouldn't classify this as progressive rock, but it is an album full of straightforward rock classics with some nice acoustic guitar thrown in for variety.
0679721037|5.0|In Hiroshima, John Hersey elucidates the entirety of his journalistic work in the introductory paragraph of the piece.    It starts by situating the reader in the context: \\"At exactly fifteen minutes past eight in the morning on August 6, 1945, Japanese time [...]\\" (1).  The use of the word `exact' is significant - it foreshadows the immense precision with which Hersey reports his factual account of the events that ensue.  Additionally, the inclusion of the phrase `Japanese time' emphasizes the fact that the information is presented from a Japanese perspective; Japanese cultural mores and beliefs are integrated into the text and Hersey acclimates us to this environment by employing it in the first line of the novel.      He then depicts what each of six characters is in the act of doing at the moment the atomic bomb was detonated on the city of Hiroshima.  This introduces what he writes from page 2 to 16 of the novel, in which he creates scenes to illuminate the lives of Mr. Tanimoto, Mrs. Nakamura, Dr. Fujii, Father Kleinsorge, Dr. Sasaki, and Miss Sasaki, respectively, at that specific moment, 8:15 a.m., August 6th, 1945.       This is a cocoon of the structure of his book - these characters demarcate the transitions in the text.  In the opening paragraph, the persona momentarily shifts the point of view of the narrative to each character.  Throughout the novel, the persona repeats this technique to advance the plot.     On page 2, there is a conscious shift from the simultaneous snapshot of each of the six characters to a broadened point of view to the hundred thousand people that were killed during the event.  The final sentence of the first paragraph is integral to the book: \\"At the time, none of them knew anything.\\"  The grammatical construction of this sentence is significant: `none,' an indefinite pronoun, does not refer to a specific person.  It can be either singular or plural, which furthers its obscurity. `Anything' is another indefinite pronoun.  Thus,this statement is imbued with tremendous ambiguity.     Furthermore, the antecedent to the objective personal pronoun `them' is not explicitly stated, and it can refer to the six survivors or it can allude to the one hundred thousand dead that Hersey mentions four sentences previously.  This renders the sentence virtually meaningless, yet it is this lack of meaning that Hersey deliberately crafts to encapsulate the utter incomprehensibility that these people, and the population as a whole, feels regarding the issue of this event and its implications for humanity.      In the course of Hiroshima, Hersey echoes this statement when he depicts a scene in which Father Kleinsorge visits Miss Sasaki in the hospital and she questions his faith.  The persona states, \\"And he went on to explain all the reasons for everything\\" (83).  `All' and `everything' are indefinite pronouns that ultimately engender a vague sentence.  He is referring to abstract ideas that are beyond comprehension.  By repeating his structural paradigm of ending a passage with a void statement, he ostensibly creates an analogy to the epigraphical \\"At the time, none of them knew anything.\\"
B000E1ZBGS|2.0|Just to be up front and clear...this is not a review of the movie. The movie gets 5 stars, hands down. It's one of my favorites.  Instead, I wanted to comment only on the quality of the Blu ray. This is one of the worst upgrades to Blu ray that I have ever seen. I have both the standard definition DVD and the Blu ray versions and I can't see much difference. I don't know what they did (or didn't do), but this is pretty atrocious. I can see pixels when I expect to see clarity. I hope there is a better quality version in the future.
B00102F5WK|2.0|The United States is an unfortunate, unwilling actor in the dramatic play that is Mohammadism's civil war.  We just don't have the heart to participate in it like they do, with one faction blowing the other one up, while the second faction captures, maims and tortures members of the first.  The Americans, at the first sign of trouble, go running off to blab to the Washington Post.  Lame.<br /><br />The plot: a Hitchcockian case of mistaken identity* occurs when Anwar El-Ibrahimi (Omar Metwally), a mild-mannered chemical engineer receives phone calls from a terrorist.  Anwar is quickly whisked away to Morocco to be waterboarded and electrocuted to get him to talk.  CIA kidstuff Douglas Freeman (Jake \\"Brokeback Mountain\\" Gyllenhaal),  under the direction of Corrine Whitman (Meryl Streep) observes the interrogations and his liberal sensibilities are shocked to the core, so he plots to free the man.  Meanwhile, the Moroccan interrogator Abasi Fawal (Yigal Naor) has his daughter falling for a brooding jihadi, giving us a new twist on Romeo and Juliet as well as a whole new meaning for the term \\"banging your girlfriend.\\"<br /><br />Joking aside, the movie was slow, predictable, preachy, one-sided, and frankly didn't make too much sense when the rendition part and the Romeo and Juliet part came together.  Abasi interrogates Anwar about the person accused of a bomb blast actually occurring in the future?  It gets very confusing.  There was some nice cinematography though, and the movie at least gives us the general truth that terrorism nowadays is primarily a Mohammedan-on-Mohammedan affair, a point that is frequently lost to both Hollywood and the American public.  So, it's not at the bottom of the agitprop barrel.<br /><br />*  Maybe.  We never do learn just why it was that Rashid the Terrorist was phoning our renditioned hero.  Maybe another waterboarding session would've broken him; you never know.<br /><br />2009 UPDATE TO MY 2008 REVIEW<br /><br />Headline from the L.A. Times, Feb. 1, 2009: \\"Obama Preserves Renditions As Counter-Terrorism Tool.\\"  So all you Obamaniacs out there are now officially pro-torture.

B000LPQ6DE|5.0|This is the most sensual Jane Eyre I have ever scene.  The English countryside is gorgeous and the acting flawless.
B0011HOEY4|5.0|American Gangster is a great movie that was directed and acted very well.  Frank Lucas is a drug kingpin in Harlem who has followed in the footsteps of his predecessor, Bumpy Johnson.  Richie Roberts, played by Russel Crowe, is a detective from New Jersey who heads up a narcotics squad of specially selected officers that are not on the take.  What follows is the impact that is created by these two heavily driven and motivated individuals who collide with one another.  This is a good example of how two completely different people who are pursuing completely different paths in life can actually be a lot alike.  Great crime drama that also gives a history lesson on the importation of our current heroin epidemic.

B00003JRCQ|4.0|This version is by far the best adaptation of the novel. Although the actors seem a bit older than their characters, they do a fantastic job. The film is put together beautifully and flows into a great romance.    I rated this version very highly compared to the 2007 BBC version. I would recommend this movie to any Jane Austen fan.
0823016714|2.0|This book was just what it stated, however, I was looking for a book of instruction for the photos included.  The book was returned.
B0013FDM7E|3.0|The first half of the movie is excellent. It's gripping, intense and emotional. It shows that nobody can live by himself/herself. Human beings need each other to survive.<br />It also showcases Will Smith's talented acting. It's heart-wrenching to watch Will kill his beloved dog after it was infected with the disease.<br /><br />The specical effects are spectacular in the scenes showing lions roaming New York. However, the \\"zombies\\" look fake. They don't look realistic like the creatures in Lord of the Ring.<br /><br />The last half of the movie is exactly like other movies of this genre, i.e. 28 days later. So, I was able to predict it.<br />It's definitely worth renting.

0767020308|3.0|I was pleased when I purchased this adaptation of Jane Austen's novel. A long-time fan of Clueless, I was overjoyed to find a good translation in video form.    I rated this higher than the 1996 version (starring Gwyneth Paltrow). I think it is a better version overall, and Kate Beckinsale does a great job portraying Emma.
B000WMFZMY|5.0|I saw this movie when I was a kid and I was very impressed with it and have wanted to own if for decades! One of the best movies ever made and makes you feel good and desire to be as good as the CID!
0743298039|4.0|I had heard great things about this book, but I still went into it not knowing what to expect.  I was pleasantly surprised and sufficiently engrossed in the story that I managed to read it during my commute, finishing in a few days.  The story within a story was very interesting and intriguing - I did not know what to expect or where it was going.  That said, some aspects, such as the author's subplot seemed contrived and unbelievable and the ending dragged on a tad bit longer than necessary.  Nonetheless, definitely worth reading.
B000V6BE6C|5.0|Maybe it wasn't as good as STST or Waking the Fallen, but in this girl's honest opinion I much prefer the self-titled album to City of Evil. Don't get me wrong, I loved City of Evil, heck I love all of their CDs. I just can't seem to get enough of some of the songs on this album. Like \\"Afterlife,\\" \\"Unbound,\\" \\"Lost.\\" I do agree that they really should have touched the country aspect as they did, it's just not them. Or at least it's not how I always thought of them. In all the whole CD is tight in the music, and Shadow's voice. It was also great to hear the other guys taking some more vocal power. So I think this CD is great, more so that they produced it themselves and did it their way.
0800141660|4.0|This is a wonderful adaptation of the novel. The actors are well known and do a superb of portraying the characters. Ang Lee is brilliant at directing romances.
0446401307|4.0|This is my first Harry Bosch book and it won't be my last. What a pleasure to read a novel that isn't 50% padding! When I was a kid, most thrillers/mysteries were about this length and they focused on plot and twists and turns. This is very similiar to the kind of novel that turned me onto reading as a child. While I have enjoyed many, many longer books I have found that over the past 10 years, authors seem to think that the bigger the book, the more important it will be perceived. They shouldn't be afraid to tell a trim story with a beginning, middle and very neatly tied up end.  The only chapter I didn't get was the Viet Nam interlude. Wasn't that puzzling, out of nowhere?    I recommend this book for readers looking for a well-constructed, minimilist thriller with a really nice turn of plot in the 3rd act.
B000MRAAJM|5.0|No blu-ray collection should be without this set. The imagery is simply amazing, and the educational experience is enriching. With over 9 hours to watch - it's quite a bargain too.

B00000G3AZ|2.0|I recently purchased this film in addition to the 1997 version (starring Kate Beckinsale), not having seen either before. Hoping to recreate the  elation I experienced when purchasing both the 2006 and the A&E Pride and Prejudice versions (both wonderful adapatations), I was rather disappointed. Overall, I would rate this version 2 stars instead of the 3 I give to the 1997 release.    Although I identify with the actors in the 1996 adaptation (they are well known in the US), this film overall is lack luster. The main elements of the novel are portrayed and the individual acting is fine, but this version is just not as good as the 1997 production. The costumes lack authenticity and the era is not well represented. It was almost like watching a hybrid version of the 1997 release and Clueless.    If you are interested in purchasing this film and you haven't seen it yet, I would highly recommend you rent it (along with the 1997 version) and come to your own conclusion. I will be \\"regifting\\" this one...
B0011U8NZ2|5.0|Live In Pittsburgh 1970, the newest release from Bright Midnight Archives is yet another masterful recording. Although somewhat shorter than the Doors' other 1970 concert releases, this show does not cease to entertain. With a 22+ minute version of \\"When the Music's Over\\", including snippets from \\"The Soft Parade\\" and a completely unreleased track \\"Push Push\\" that was ONLY ever recorded live here and never made it onto that album. This release is well worth the money. If you are even a casual Doors fan, for the price you definatly need to check this out.
B00000DC7J|5.0|I bought this CD for two reasons: I like tango and the reviews made it sound like it was the second coming of Gardel.  The CD is amazing.  I love it.     It is instrumental which is not something I was expecting.   I am no connoisseur but it's a great piece to listen to when you need background music that is far more provocative and interesting than you'd expect.
B00005AG7K|5.0|Actually I have this DVD not from Amazon but from other source, so I graded just the quality of the movie, not the quality of the DVD... For those who really love the Beatles, I think you have to get this movie, for it's very interesting to watch the band during Mystery Tour period... probably it's not good at all as a usual movie, but because of that fact that Lennon, McCartney, Harrison and Starr are there makes it interesting. My favorite moment is when they are playing I am the Walrus... which is probably the only time they played this song in front of the cameras... It's a very good piece of history about the Beatles. If you like the album Magical Mystery Tour itself, you will surely enjoy this DVD, without any doubt.

B000ICL3KG|5.0|[[ASIN:B000PY52IG A Crude Awakening - The Oil Crash]]    I finally got a chance to rent Al's DVD, & it was way more than I was expecting.    I have been aware of environmental issues for years now.    I was recycling before most of my city was.    I was definitely educated despite my knowledge, & I encourage you to watch the movie not because it's a movie, but because it affects our entire earth, that's humans, animals, water, earth, all facets of nature.    Ignoring the problem won't make it go away, it's just you living in denial.    Once again, I admire Al Gore to no end, I had no idea he's been studying this & speaking about it since he learned about it in College.    Thanks      Michelle  P.S. I even watched the director & producer's comments & I usually NEVER spend time doing that unless the movie is that good.
B000X5KSWM|2.0|Tarja has gone from being the Goddess of Heavy Metal to the Mary Poppins of the Opera.  After all those years with Nightwish I would have thought that she would have known what her forte is and how to exploit it, My Winter Storm is quite disappointing. There are some tracks on the album that show promise - Lost Northern Star, My Little Phoenix, Die Alive and Ciaran's Well, but the music is pushed way into the background. Tarja's voice dominates all and seems to result in the loss of fire and passion that characterized her performances with Nightwish. I love Tarja when she is competing on equal footing with the heavy metal music and not totally dominating, this is when she is at her best.     Most of the other tracks on the album are unobtrusive and almost somnambulistic at times, so much so that the album is only good for background music at dinner with friends. A complete remix by a heavy metal producer with free reign would work wonders with most of the tracks. I hope that this is something Tarja felt she had to do once or else the advice she is getting is way wrong.    Unfortunately, this album will probably be best remembered for the most appalling cover of Poison I have ever heard. I think that Alice Cooper fans the world over, myself included, cringe every time they hear this travesty. What was she thinking? I can only hope that her next album will have more of \\"The Rock\\" that she alludes to in the acknowledgements section. If you were thinking of buying this CD save your money and hope that the next album will be better.

A nun can ride into France in the middle of a war and come out without a scratch, just not believable. I just don't know what all the fuss is about.

So after you read the book she hammers her ideas home to you again and again. Repetition is a must.

006054094X|3.0|Hi!    For all of the reviewers who say this is ALL bunk, unsubstantiated stories and fabrications: You are wrong.    I heard about this book, when it was being published, and the information that was coming out about this subject, at the same time that I happened to go to Acapulco for vacation.    I am a History Major, so I'm always interested in the history of the areas I visit. I was reading several different publications I found in Acapulco about the history of Acapulco, and, low and behold, they started explaining things that matched perfectly with the 1421 information.    Researchers have found a number of Asian/Chinese-type artifacts that are dated well BEFORE the Europeans made it into the Acapulco area. They also talked about some Asian-looking people living in the Acapulco area before and during the arrival of the Spanish to the area.    These publications said NOTHING about the 1421 book whatsoever. The authors of these publications had no knowledge of th 1421 book. The evidence they presented matched the ideas in the 1421 book that the Chinese has made it to N. America, before the Spanish arrived.    Having said that, I would not be surprised if SOME of the claims in the book are exaggerated and turn out to be false.    I would recommend reading the book and doing some research on the subject. I think that history will show that some/much of the information in this book turns out to be correct.    Thinking logically about the European's 1400-1500 explorations of the Americas. Technologically, it was not that difficult. It WAS expensive, and the people who have money, aren't going to throw it away.    WHY did Columbus arrive in 1492? Why not 1440, or 1390? Because, the people with the money did not want to risk it. When they had the evidence (maps out of China) that there WAS land between Europe and Asia, they felt that spending the money on an expidition, had a logical chance of return on their investment.    China's discovery of the Americas, and the maps they made, were the catalyst that Europe needed to commit the large resources required on an expedition West across the ocean.    Why do we not have a moon base now? It is NOT the technology. We could've had a base on the moon for years, with current technology. The people who have the money have not yet decided it is worth the risk to try and establish a colony on the moon. When the risk factors go down enough, we will be on the moon and Mars.    cliff  KGRB
B000E1ZK50|5.0|I have to admit I enjoyed this film probably more than should be legal.  It still delights me.  I love action movies, horror movies, and have a soft spot in my heart for all of Universal's monsters, as well as just about any movie ever done of Dracula.  Yes, Peter Cushing is pitch perfect as Van Helsing, and Anthony Hopkins makes him an educated and entertaining psycho, but Hugh Jackman turns him into a dashing and lethal killing machine.  Oddly enough they all work.  The cast is great.  Hugh Jackman, David Wenham, and Kate Beckinsale do a terrific job as the heroes. Richard Roxburgh delivers a Dracula that is charming, dangerous, and ridiculously self-absorbed, and Shuler Hensley comes very close to Mary Shelley's misunderstood monster.  The pacing in this movie is on fast forward all the time, but is pretty much flawless.  Everything is explained, even with several things happening at once and it all converges at the right moment.    The atmosphere was suitably spooky (especially the stagecoach ride through the forests at night), and the sets and costume design were gorgeous.  I have to give credit to Stephen Sommers too for managing to include all the monsters in a story that actually worked.  It has been tried before, but usually the story seems contrived or the characterization just doesn't work.  Not only did he manage a good story, but he created an interesting universe with the church employing its own hitmen and scientists to take care of supernatural evil when it pops up.    And yes, being female, two hours of Hugh Jackman and David Wenham are an absolute pleasure, and Richard Roxburgh is no slouch either.  The female characters were fun to watch too - Anna Valerious was a take-no-prisoners tough girl, and the brides were catty drama queens with some fabulous lines.
B0012K1ILW|5.0|Don't be afraid of what you don't understand.  Sister Erykah is just trying to tell you what's going on and how she sees it.  I know a lot of folks don't have the patience to sit through this album and actually listen to the words, but there are a lot of true Badu fans, and kids, all of her music so far has been leading to this.  I feel blessed that there is a mainstream artist, with more than her foot in the door, spreading this message around the world.  This is not a compilation of music to be taken lightly, the words express her feelings, and you can feel everything through the steady, meditative beat.  Don't go digging for the radio hits, you won't find them.  Just appreciate what we've been given, and enjoy the ride.

0385338724|4.0|Sophie Kinsella is the gold standard by which all other chick lit writers fall short.  As I began this book, it was like coming home, a \\"Now this is what I'm talking about\\" moment.  I have read all her books, Undomestic Goddess probably being my favorite.  The opening chapters in Remember Me? had me riveted with anticipation and delight.  However, as the book progress, it seemed to lack the \\"tangled web\\" of plot I have enjoyed in her other books.  The storyline was a more of a straight line, and I hoped for a more complex resolution (for example) to the business conflict in the end - more development as to how her former company missed the boat, and more detail in how her new venture succeeded.  The ending with Jon was probably more in line with reality, but when have we been concerned with reality?  That is what is so amazing about her stories, so unbelievable in reality, yet we fall helplessly hooked and convinced it could be no other way.  The hallmark of her writing is how these characters get themselves into unbelievable, no way out messes that resolve wonderfully -it is just a joy to see.  This one fell a bit short of that usual magic for me.
B000NA2776|5.0|Mika is, perhaps, the most original and dynamic musician in the pop industry today. His work sounds for all the world as though Elton John and George Michael collaborated and wrote a musical together, but his voice is purely his own - it is reminiscent of Freddie Mercury, reminiscent of George Michael, but definitely his own. I am looking forward to seeing what he does on his next album!
0684847817|5.0|I absolutely LOVE this book, as I have his other two, \\"Lady Cottinigton's Pressed Fairie Book\\" and \\"Good Fairies, Bad Fairies.\\" Froud's fairies seem more real to me than the cutsey fairies you see elsewhere, and I love his stories and descriptions. Had me giggling for hours.
B000009PNY|3.0|This compilation is really odd, 3 stars only because I really like the Meat Beat Manifesto cover.    Have been a huge fan of DM since the 80's, own all their stuff with the exception of a few early singles, and I would consider them and Radiohead to be my favorite bands.    All in all, good choices for songs to cover, but... Gonna break it down by track:    1) Smashing Pumpkins - Never Let Me Down Again, is a decent acoustic version of the song, though this song has so much rock potential I would have like to have seen Billy take it another direction.    2) God Lives Underwater - Fly on the Windscreen, is tolerable, but other than the vocals this doesn't really sound like GLU, nor like DM. I would have thought GLU (an above average NIN wannabe band) would have put a little more oomph into this cover given what I own of theirs.    3) Failure - Enjoy the Silence, tolerable, though very weak vocals, ok guitars and some interesting noises. DM did a rock version of this that is much better.    4) The Cure - World in My Eyes, wish they had covered any other DM really, I am fairly alone in the opinion the World in My Eyes is in my least 5 favorite DM song list (allthough the World in my Eyes single had two of the best B sides in history). I found this to be a run of the mill redo, was hoping Mr. Smith would have done something different with this one.    5) Dishwalla - Policy of Truth, weak vocals, boring guitars, find myself wanting to hit the skip button.    6) Veruca Salt - Somebody, average alt rock band looks silly trying to do a fan favorite with half the talent.    7) Meat Beat Manifesto - Everything Counts, Finally, a good cover! The vocals are a little weaker than DM's, but the noises Jack constructed for this cover are complex and interesting, he does a good job of paying tribute to this song. This track alone was worth the purchase price of this album!    8) Hooverphonic - Shake the Disease, I like Hooverphonic, but this song falls short for me, nowhere near asgood as the DM version (which I like a lot) and not a very good Hooverphonic song either.    9) Locust - Master and Servant, Way boring, almost any band could have done better with this song, would have liked to have seen Lords of Acid take this one on.    10) Self - Shame, this is one of my all time favorite DM songs, because it was so odd. Self tried to keep the odd, but the vocals are bland, and the beat ruins the oddity for me.    11) Monster Magnet - Black Celebration, is a servicable cover, not a fan of MM, but they do ok here. Maybe a little too much funk and not enough of the heaviness I expected from MM.    12) Rabbit in the Moon - Waiting for the Night, is ok, but sort of boring, I usually skip this after a minute or so, although I really like the DM version of this song.    13) Apollo 440 - I Feel You, these guys can turn out some pretty rockin mainstream techno, while they aren't my favorite techno act, I thought they would do something like they did with the Lost in Space song, but this one falls short of that by a lot, Oh well, it's a tolerable listen anyway.    14) Gus Gus - Monument, this is a decent version of Monument, kind of a weird choice for a cover given the age and obscurity of the song.    15) Deftones - To Have and to Hold, I love the DM version of this song, I don't care for Deftones, boy was I surprised when I found that I like this cover! Too bad most of the other bands didn't put the effort the Deftones did into their work.    16) Rammstein - Stripped, this one is tough, I dont mind Rammstein, being a fan of Industrial and Industro-metal, so I like this cover, but I could see where fans would be wretching over this track. I just wish he would finish the chorus and sing the words '...down to the bone' instead of just stopping after singing 'Let me see you stripped', the empty space where the words should be makes the song sound incomplete.    Would have liked to have seen NIN, Front 242, Aphex Twin and many other bands no doubt influenced by DM on this compilation, or at least less alt rock and more effort.    Only buy it if you're a big fan of DM and want a small handful of decent covers, otherwise buy the MBM cover by itself from wherever and pass this one up!
0061547832|1.0|What a disappointment. Reading about this guys and his little sidekick bragging about their companies is not at all inspiring to me. I got to the chapter about getting even with your enemies and it's truly disgusting. I just had to get the book out of my house, so i went right out to the trash bin and dumped it. I have never done that with a book in my entire life.     If this guy is considered a role model and an icon, i feel sorry for humanity.

1576754227|4.0|In this book, Brian Tracy takes valuable time management skills from several well-known sources and condenses into a short and easy read.  Tasks are easy to work through, and if you follow the plan, you can get yourself on the road to organization and more stream-lined productivity in no time.  This was so easy to follow that my whole family is now working through the book together, and it's making a big difference for all of us.  Identifying what's most important, setting goals, etc. takes time, so don't get discouraged -- stick to it!  This is an easy and fun way to better time management!  Thanks Brian!
B000LPS3B2|5.0|\\"Shutter\\" is a very clever horror film from Thailand.  In my opinion, it's the scariest film that I've seen since the American remake of \\"The Grudge,\\" which gets my vote for scariest movie ever made.  While for the most part an original piece of work, \\"Shutter\\" does seem to take elements from past horror films: \\"Ghost Story,\\" \\"I Know What You Did Last Summer,\\" and \\"The Grudge,\\" to name a few.  But overall, the plot was surprisingly good, with an interesting explanation at the end of the film that I thought amazing!  Asian horror movies seem capable of creating a suspenseful and truly frightening story, unlike most of the cookie cutter movies of Hollywood (I can't even remember the last domestic horror film that was 1) not a remake and 2) was actually scary.)<br /><br />Without giving away any of the main details, the plot revolves around restless spirits - one in particular.  The story has revenge as its main theme.  The special effects are absolutely brilliant - as in the Japanese version of \\"The Ring\\" and the American remake of \\"The Grudge\\" - two other great horror horror films.  The film's title comes from the use of cameras by some of the main characters, which capture some images of one of the spirits.<br /><br />There are some slow parts at times, but it is fill with enough scares to keep you on the edge of your seat.  If you like horror films, you'll love this one. Ghosts, revenge, and a suspenseful story all in one film.
0553213105|5.0|I have read this novel 6 times and I never get bored of this novel!  It seems every time I read this novel that I realize something new about the characters that Jane Austen so cleverly created and what's more is that I enjoy the novel each time as much as I did the first time I read it!!  I would definitely recommend this novel to anyone who enjoys a great classic with whitty characters and an excellent love story.
0316236535|5.0|This book has easy to remember text and is perfect for reading aloud.  Children can \\"read\\" along and feel proud that they have power over the monster.  My co-workers and I have used this book in preschool, PreK, and even younger classrooms.<br /><br />Reading this book aloud is beneficial because it helps children learn the connections between pictures and words.  It also shows them that reading is fun, and can be a starting point for a lifetime of reading.<br /><br />My daughter received it for Xmas when she was 1 year old, and she's loved it ever since.  I think she has always understood that it was pretend, and she enjoyed being in charge of the monster.
020530902X|5.0|[[ASIN:020530902X The Elements of Style, Fourth Edition]]<br /><br />I have lived with the original edition for around 50 years. The fourth edition is an expanded but still concise guide containing practically everything that writers must know to write good English. There are other excellent and bigger books on the subject, but this beats them for sheer quality and brevity.

1591840562|5.0|I really enjoyed the candor and wit of the author, Guy Kawasaki. The stories from his past and a peek into the venture capital world was all very insightful. What was most interesting was how he separated the fluff from what was actually important. I believe the lessons from this book will definitely help me in the future.
0743486285|5.0|This book is a great testimonial about what its like to be under the control of a drug addiction.  Through Nikki's diary entries, you see first hand how twisted a person get when they have an addiction.  The entries are often shocking and keep you waiting to read more and to see what happens on the next day.
B00005JPTK|5.0|Will Smith was excellent in I Am Legend, and the story was awesome. He really makes you feel like he is alone in the world. I must say that it is hardly anything like the book I Am Legend by Richard Matheson but it was a great movie anyway. I have looked forward to the dvd release ever since leaving the theatre. I will definately add it to my dvd collection of great movies.
0156711427|4.0|First of all, I should say that as I grow older I'm learning that everything I read more than five years should probably not be included in the list of books I've read. I first read A Passage to India in 1994. I know this because in my quasi obsession, through most of the nineties, to catch up on reading the important books years I had never read, I wrote the dates at which I started and finished each book on the inside cover. When I picked A Passage to India up again this summer, I was stunned to find that, except for a few hazy vaguenesses, I had forgotten the book completely. I certainly had no memory of its beauty. At the heart of A Passage to India are the issues of race, friendship, decency, and the clash of cultures in British India at the turn of the 20th century. Forster's story is polyphonic, which is to say it is told from a number of voices. His prose is beautiful enough to stop you, and the novel's larger questions are ones that continue to resonate with the world's denizens even at the turn of this century.
B000R7I3LY|3.0|I bought this album because I liked her single \\"Love Song\\" that I heard on the radio. None of the other songs are quite as good, in my opinion, but it's still nice to listen to.

B00003CX5P|4.0|[[ASIN:B00003CX5P Star Wars - Episode I, The Phantom Menace (Widescreen Edition)]]<br />Good movie.I am glad I bought it.
B000E5KJEI|5.0|I've have had this film in standard DVD, and now have the HD-DVD version of it, and it's even better.  I totally agree with the rave reviews of this film and it marked Eastwood as an important director to watch (witness his 2 great war films, and another Oscar winner-\\"Million Dollar Baby\\"). If you have either of the Hi-Def formats, I would seriously recommend you purchase this classic asap. By the way, when I first saw this classic in a suburban theatre, many people in the theatre clapped after it was over which goes to show you how strong a reaction this film has made on the general public!!  There are no winners when it comes to the violence within mankind!!
B000GUJZ4G|5.0|Whoa - where can you get several good-looking men, a beach front, and a  true discovery of your heart in one movie.  This one teaches where the  heart lies, with right, wrong, or yourself, and the agony of having to  choose, and know the difference.
B000003TSP|5.0|Portishead has yet to put out a bad CD and in my opinion this is their best.
0143038419|2.0|I'm glad I borrowed this book from the library.  I decided to give it a try because I'd heard so many good reviews, because I'm an avid reader and I love to travel, too.  I only made it through the first several chapters of the book before I had to return it to the library for another patron, and I won't bother requesting it again.  It's not worth the wait.<br /><br />The author's writing style, I will admit, is engaging.  However, her whiny tone, self-absorbed outlook on life and overall interpretation of her experiences is vain and unbecoming.  I read her words and think, \\"If I met her in person, she'd probably be someone I'd try to stay away from!\\"  She seems to have a \\"poor me\\" attitude that, although it likely improves over the course of the book, was far too heavy at the beginning for me to consider pursuing the end.
B000MRAAJW|5.0|There are two nature documentaries that stand head and shoulders above the rest: Blue Planet and Planet Earth.  These two documentaries are so well made, you will constantly be wondering throughout the documentary how it's possible to get such great shots.  BBC was given unprecedented access to areas of our planet I never thought existed and I was in constant awe of the masterpiece this documentary is.  If you own an HD DVD player, this set of DVD's is a requirement for any collection.
0740748475|5.0|Sure there are minor flaws that others have noticed, not being able to take the books out of the case easily, and my wish that they use more matte paper so the light doesn't glare on it so much, however, this is a FANTASTIC set and a good purchase!I'm a big fan of Calvin and Hobbes, and of good-quality books, and this set brings both together nicely. It is great to have all the strips together in one set, along with a lengthy introduction by Bill Watterson himself. This set certainly pays fitting tribute to a great comic strip!
B000ZK4466|5.0|After listening to this CD for the first week that it has been in my possession, I can truly say that every time I've popped it in that I have discovered something new that I like about it.     It's not possible to divide this album into sections.. the tracks seem to flow into one another. Most of the album is composed of heavy hard-hitters like the opening track \\"Aberinkula\\" and \\"Goliath\\", but there are also deviations on this formula that make the album all the more interesting.    The song \\"Tourniquet Man\\" will take listeners by surprise after listening to louder tracks 1-5, and the track \\"Soothsayer\\" represents the album cover art the best in that it adds a Middle Eastern flavor to The Mars Volta's already unique style of music.     I truly love this album and I look forward to the next opportunity that I'll have to listen to it again.
0143038419|5.0|Thankfully, there are sometimes books that come into your life at just the right moments.  This is the case with \\"Eat, Pray, Love\\" for me. Having just gone through my own divorce -- and re-entered the dating world for the first time in over a decade -- I was very much looking for a book that delved into some of these very same issues that I am. While I would love to spend a year of my life \\"finding myself\\" in exotic places, I do not have the time or the means to do so. I was able to live vicariously through Elizabeth Gilbert's journey and see and do the things that I will likely never do myself. I really enjoyed her writing style. I found her to be likable and authentic, and I envied her ability to put herself out there as she did. It is not an easy thing, I know. I definitely recommend this book to anyone who loves to travel, who is experiencing a crisis-of-sorts, or who just wants to gain a better understanding of where she fits in the world. Probably not a book for men, but who knows?
0060775858|5.0|We received this book for a gift when my daughter turned 4.  She has loved this book so much that even though she is 13, when we go through all our books to donate to others, she always insist that we keep this one.

0374105235|4.0|I was listening to Ishmael Beah's book on my car tape. In fact the voice on the tape is of Ishmael Beah that his childhood took a turn at the age 12 when the war came to his village in Eastern Sierra Leone near the diamond mines. Since then it is a story of survival against nature and human. As he quote his father, \\"If you loose your hope then you have no life\\", he kept going from one adventure to another find true friendship, hardship, and happy ending. On the way he lost his family, friends, but kept going with hope in his heart.  Great (true) story

1582701709|1.0|Napoleon Hill wrote those words in the various books he authored (such as Think and Grow Rich and The Law of Success.) They are the unadulterated truth about the \\"Secret\\".    I  read him, and then read the Secret in order to give it a chance. But apart from clever marketing and packaging, there is nothing innovative about the information.     If anything it is impractical watered-down misinformation and new age philosophy. They leave out that in order to achieve what all the great ones such as Edison, Disney, Carnegie, Ford and others did, it takes more than just dreaming or visualization or whatever. They put in long hours and worked harder than even their employees, persevering when everything seemed hopeless.     If they had followed the advice in The Secret, they would have stopped when things had gotten hard because they would \\"feel\\" bad, and we wouldn't have most of the great things they made.    If you want to \\"feel good\\", read The Secret. If you want to change your life and achieve real success, check out Napoleon Hill. Seriously.
038541627X|3.0|A Complete Stories of Isaac Asimov book in one volume would have to electronic to be liftable, or have paper and print of the rice and really, really tiny variety.

B00111YM5G|5.0|The director made a great job  to assemble the history with the special effects and the performance of the actors, in spite of having a low production budget.<br /><br />I liked very much the performance of Andy Whitfield, although, his performance denotes inexperience in many areas, I believe that he is an actor with a promising future. He has an special presence and he looks well in this movie.<br />The performance of Dwaine Stevenson (Sammael) is also very remarkable. I could see influences of other films, like Matrix, Underworld and Hellboy.<br /><br />I think this movie needed depth a little more in the characters: the angels and the demons. A good detail was to use the Biblical names of many angels, like Raphael and Michael, and of demons like Lilith.<br /><br />I have been pleasingly surprised, and I believe that this film has been a good creative effort.
B0001GOH6Q|1.0|I like Burton's stop animation work, creative.  This story is just a lot of rambling non-sense that's disjointed and boring.  Oh yeh, the stories might be true in the end?  Revelationary.  Nothing interesting happens in this story, and the yarns aren't touching or comical.  It's all a silly dance that doesn't work on any level.  I'm sorry, but don't waste your time!
B000002J0B|5.0|Just buy this remastered copy of some outstanding rock n' roll.  In my opinion there is no bad Led Zepplin album.  Nevertheless the sound quality is great with the remastering of Jimmy Page at the board.  The Ocean sounds excellent.
0061120081|5.0|This is a powerful exploration of race, law, and growing up in the South. Some have taken issue with certain aspects of this novel (like the saintliness of Atticus Finch and innocent nature of Tom Robinson), but it accomplishes exactly what it sets out to do: illuminate the nature of race and childhood at a dangerous and interesting intersection of American history
B000MV90IU|5.0|If you want the best car chase ever, and the one that started it all, then look no further.  Amazon has a great price on this movie, plus you get all of the extras.  Now, as a car guy or gearhead I'm am a little biased.  However, McQueen is at his top, the Ford sounds great and the 5.1 Dolby is done right.  Also, it looks great on video with the high definition Blu-Ray format.  Trust Amazon with the price, and enjoy the Fastback gearing through the twisties.  It is really that great.

0743486285|5.0|I loved the book - it was very disturbing look into the senseless behavior of a drug addict. I am surprised by some of the negative comments that people have posted about the book. I want to counter some of them since the negative comments may sway someone from buying or reading the books.    I have been a huge Motley fan since 1983. I have seen the Crue in concert many times including the Girls x3 show in Tacoma, WA in October 1987 - which he described in the Book. I looked forward to the Tacoma/Portland entries because of his local ties to Seattle and I was told by a fan that went to the show in Portland that he passed out on stage there.    Several people have made the same criticism of the book - they say:    \\"I doubt he kept a diary during this time, it seems too contrived\\" - Since I have been a fan for a long time, I know that Nikki has kept web diaries while on tour, and he would write daily and extensively. I also know that the entries are very short at times, very repetitive, and not very flattering to him. So why would you write that intentionally. If he wanted to write something today about his addiction in the 80's he could have written much more glamorous and self-serving behavior. The Tacoma entry did not mention that they sold out a large venue near the city that he went to his first concert at (Seattle) it was all about his mother visiting.    \\"Sixx claims that by publishing these diaries he hopes at least one person can be helped - but Sixx actually tries to glamorize his lifestyle\\". I find that comment the most ridiculous. Nothing that Sixx has written is glamorous; it would be embarrassing as hell. The fact that he repeatedly tells people that he OD'd and died twice is not taken as glamorizing it - he knows he is luck to be alive and thankful for his extra days to live.    \\"How can Sixx keep complaining about a bad childhood, and whining about not knowing his dad or Mommy issues - that does not excuse the drug use, because many people have these issues and deal with them just fine\\". In the book Sixx does frequently mention abandonment issues to explain his despair. I can somewhat empathize - why does he constantly mention it? It is a diary - so it is what it is I guess. Also I assume that he is just writing about the issues in general and not going into very personal childhood experiences. One longtime friend added in the book that Nikki has told him some very detailed stories of his childhood that absolutely shocked him.    Regardless - every person responds to there upbringing differently. Why does a little girl in Harlem grow up with a prostitute and crack addict for a mother and end up with a full ride scholarship to Harvard? Why does a kid that seems to have great parents and all the advantages in life commit suicide or become a worthless contributor to society? Nikki seemed to be a very sensitive kid that whatever he went through growing up was a catalyst to what he became.     I could not put down the book - it was funny as hell some times, pathetic and shocking at other times. I cannot see how any of it was flattering to Nikki.

He is 9 months old and loves this book!  He loves playing Peek a Boo with Paul and feeling Daddy's scratchy face.  He even pulls the book up to his face to smell the flowers and puts his finger through Mummy's Ring.  And yes of course he loves to Pat the Bunny too!  This book is a classic, but even the newest ones still like this book!
B000QQFKYE|5.0|As you can see on the splendid amazon.com interview, it really is the beginning of a new era of entertainment. David Lynch no is longer harassed by studios who are angry they agreed to work with DL in the first place, not worried about theatrical distribution (sadly I believe theaters are going to go out for good and will become as common as drive-ins, which may give rise to better films in theaters maybe) and doesn't have to fear freeloaders like Roger Ebert deciding for the mass public that his films aren't worth your time. With the internet and digital film (cutting the cost dramatically) artists are more free and can easily get their goods out to the fans and those who are curious can read many many informed opinions on all types of websites, messageboards, blogs, or a simple email, not having to rely on whats printed in JUST ONE review in a paper. David Lynch having a brutal career within the studio system is finally free to do whatever he wants and Inland Empire is an excessive 3 hour jam session on modest equipment and like any other jam session, it can be taken in bits or you can let it rush over you at once. It doesn't seem to make much of a difference in this case.<br /><br />  I'm not wasting any time saying OH DUDE ITS SO WEIRD, I personally don't find any movies or music made by human beings \\"weird\\" anymore. Finding films weird is something you must have gotten over by now in this day and age unless you truly are fresh off Transformers The Movie being your best day at the cinema. Like most Lynch movies this is like a long lucid dream where one central object continuously morphs, ideas fade in and out, sometimes its senseless, funny, boring, unnerving or even moving. Possibly the most cerebral & thorough Lynch film since Eraserhead. Its great to see Harry Dean Stanton still has much to offer, Laura Dern is an amazing actress, keeps you drawn in with some of the best acting you'll ever experience. The rebirth and newfound freedom of David Lynch and anyone else looking to make movies is something to get excited about and this is an all guns blazing celebration of I CAN DO WHATEVER THE HECK I PLEASE goodness. There's plenty to watch on both these discs, so I can't say its not worth it.oking to make movies is something to get excited about and this is an all guns blazing celebration of I CAN DO WHATEVER THE HECK I PLEASE goodness.

B000NVIXDW|4.0|Buble's latest satisfies his fans and makes a great gift. While not a BIG fan I enjoyed listening to this CD, all tracks. Nice selections and typically well done. Fits his vocal range and voice.
B000KRNCYY|3.0|PURCHASED TWO OF THESE.  RETURNED ONE.  THE PRICE WAS SO COMPETITIVE.  WHY LOOK ANYWHERE ELSE.
B000MRA6AK|5.0|I very much appreciate Amazon.com's \\"heroic efforts\\" at obtaining this recording. I had tried so many places subsequent to ordering this CD, attempting to find it for immediate purchase, and come away empty-handed, that I was convinced the thing actually didn't exist, and Amazon would eventually inform me that they just couldn't get it.    Then, lo and behold, I got an email right about the time of my despair, saying it had shipped.    I have to say that the version of \\"All The Things You Are\\" on this record is absolutely superb!    Regarding the sound quality, although it is billed as a \\"remaster,\\" it is obvious that they had such poor mono masters to work with in the first place that there was only so much that could be done. A previous reviewer mentioned the presence of \\"high frequency hiss.\\" He was NOT overstating things at all!    Of course, you can imagine what the situation must have been like, setting up to record at a Jazz club with relatively inferior (by today's standards) monaural equipment. It isn't surprising that it would turn out as it did. Nevertheless, it's good enough to see the brilliance of Ahmad Jamal even fifty years ago!

B000002JBG|5.0|It's hard to believe Space Jam was made back over 11 years ago in 2008. The soundtrack is a must if you like the movie \\"Space Jam\\" \\"I Believe I Can Fly\\" \\"For You I Will\\" and \\"The Winner\\" are just a few of the classics on this album. I used to listen to this a lot in middle school and somewhat in high school. It's one of my favorite soundtracks.
B000PFU7OO|5.0|I saw the movie, and I loved the movie and the soundtrack.It is awesome, and it won best song at the oscars. You will not be disappointed with this Cd. I love it!!!
B00005ASHM|5.0|This album was made at the same time as Sgt. Pepper and was a unique because it has mono or stereo versions of the songs on the album with different types of songs. Pet Sounds is like Sgt. Pepper except that the Beatles had more unique albums and on most of the songs, the Beach Boys sound like themselves instead of Beatles albums where the Beatles sound different on different songs. Classic Beach Boys songs on here include \\"God Only Knows\\" \\"Wouldn't It Be Nice\\" \\"Sloop John B\\" \\"Caroline No.\\" to name a few. Another bonus track \\"Hang on to your Ego\\" is great as well. This is a must for any Beach Boys fan.

B000M4RG42|2.0|After watching \\"letters from Iwo Jima\\" I expected this movie to be the American version of the battle at Iwo Jima.  I expected the movie to tell the story to be told in chronological order of the battle followed by the story of the bond drive made possible by the famous photo of the flag raising.  After about 25 minutes Eastwood stopped telling about the battle & started telling about the bond drive by 3 men who raised the flag.  After this the battle scenes were basically flashbacks about how the men who raised the flag were killed at Iwo. If I didn't know the history before watching this movie I would not have known who won the battle after watching this movie.  Pete
B000WPD2B2|4.0|I had the US version & got this one because I collect Duran Duran. It is not to bad a album, saw them play lots of it \\"Live\\" a few months ago and this one is like the US special edition except you get one bonus track as well. Falling Down gets lots of airplay but the rest of the album is underrated in my opinion. Wish they would have put the Falling Down remixes (there are 7 radio promo mixes) on this release as a more attractive offering but as it goes, the album with the bonus DVD is worth it for the collector and interesting to the fan getting into the new version of Duran Duran.<br />Search Judemac Forever on msn,Yahoo or Google.
B00008BRB5|5.0|This album is not only an important artistic step ahead for The Police but also for the time period in general.In the early 80's many pop stars of the time such as Peter Gabrial were beginning to experiment with adding elements of world music,such as African and latin styles into their own sound.The Police had begun doing the same thing with reggae but here Sting,who wrote or co-wrote ten out of the eleven songs presented here,has begun to reach for new artistic heights.The title track is presented in two seperate parts comes of well as very stratospheric rock and showcases another important element of this recording;'Syncronicity' is The Police's most polished,glossy and slick album,a sound they began moving towards as far back as [[ASIN:B00008BRDV Zenyatta Mondatta [Digipak]]].In \\"Walking In Your Footsteps\\" a strong,stripped down afro-raggae influnece makes it's presence known,especially fitting with Sting's deeply poetic lyric about the evolution of life itself. For their biggest hit recording it's ironic that the first songs presented here are generally their more artsy and ambitious,especially showcasing what an incredible drummer Stewart Copeland is. \\"Oh God\\" and \\"Miss Gradenko\\" (a song co-written with Copeland) showcase very catchy pop melodies with funky grooves,something The Police did so well and the reason why there's such a thing as album tracks!The oddest song on this album has to be Andy Summers \\"Mother\\",a deeply avante garde rocker with Andy ranting in psychopath style about a very twisted Fruedian \\"mother\\" fetish involving his lady love.It is generally people's least favorite song on the album but in the context it's in it makes sense in a bizzare way. The Police in very untraditional style chose to link the albums three huge hits \\"Every Breath You Take\\" (that such a creepy stalker song got to be a hit is a testement to the bands clout at the time),\\"King Of Pain\\" and \\"Wrapped Around You Finger\\" one after the other;these are songs fans,80's and pop music lovers in general all know almost by heart. Sting returns to the almost ambient,poetic style of earlier in the album on the haunting \\"Tea In The Sahara\\". The final track (added to the CD edition only) is the most pointed;the bluesy \\"Murder By Numbers\\" points very strongly to the jazz based sound Sting would showcase to a fuller extent on his solo debut [[ASIN:B000002GFA The Dream of the Blue Turtles]],an album I highly recommend either right after or...just pick it up along with this;you'll find they play GREAT back to back!. Sadly this album was the swansong for The Police (in my opinion they should've continued throughout the 80s) but Sting's strong musical ego had begun to grow beyond the group at this point and the resulting in fighting resulted in the bands breakup shortly after 'Syncronicity' came out. But outside of Peter Gabrial this is perhaps one of the best examples of advanced,superbly polished 80's pop-rock one could find and I highly recommend this to.....anyone who really enjoys great music!s and pop music lovers in general all know almost by heart.

B0011U8NZ2|4.0|Like the other releases in this series, it is as it was recorded, with the show pretty much exactly as it was presented, hopefully this will keep up or until they run out of concert material. I highly recommend this one for the collector more so then the average fan. It is a golden time for hardcore Doors fans to bask in all these previous un-released recordings. So take a chance & get it and the other \\"Live\\" Doors in this series. Search our site Judemac Forever on msn, Yahoo or Google it.

B000R7HY0K|4.0|The Good Things:<br />*Kurt Russel makes a good campy bad guy (but he's not necessarily scary).<br />*Dialogue is good, realistic in some parts, and memorable in others.<br />*Car chase in the last twenty minutes is awesome.<br />*Car crash scene in the middle of the movie is intense (a few good gory effects as well).<br />*Very unique style, very reminiscent of the 70s.<br />*Good soundtrack.<br />*Cool cars.<br />*Some homages to other QT films (look out for the \\"Kill Bill\\" ringtone, or the car with \\"Kill Bill\\" colors, or the record from \\"Pulp Fiction\\"...).<br />*Some homages to other 70s films (like the car in the end, which is the same as from \\"Vanishing Point\\").<br /><br />The Bad Things:<br />*Slow-moving story (and it's a pretty wierd story too).  Some parts seemed like they could have been cut out (lots of dialogue that doesn't fit with the story).<br />*This was supposed to be a horror slasher film, but it hardly feels like one.<br />*Half of the movie is made to look old on purpose (which I think is good, because it's additional homage to 70s films (and older \\"Grindhouse\\" films)).  Some might find this gaudy.<br /><br />Much like \\"Pulp Fiction,\\" this is a strange, mesmerizing trip through 70s style filming with cool characters, strong dialogue, and an incredibly unique style.  This film is a little better, because it has excellent action scenes at the end.  It's a little worse, because it's all one story told around two groups of women, and thus gets a little long.  But with patience, you will find this to be interesting and entertaining homage to films of the 70s.  Highly reccomended for people who are transfixed with that era, people who like QT or \\"Pulp Fiction\\", and people who like car chases.<br /><br />This feature was released alongside with \\"Planet Terror,\\" which is sold separately (but I think $20.00 is still good enough for one good movie).
B0000VCZK2|5.0|I have been wanting to purchase all of these movies for a long time but it would have cost me a fortune to get them separately from a store. I was very glad to find the whole set, in mint condition, for such a reasonable price. I was having trouble finding them all to begin with so that was a big bonus as well.
0316010669|5.0|Blink is a \\" must read \\" about the power and accuracy of our first impressions and intuitions about people and events. Malcolm Gladwell skillfully presents several case studies that inspire me to recognize my own intuitive talent and also to notice my tendencies to dismiss my intuitive knowing in favor of analysis and self-doubt.  He cleverly examines stereotyping and predjudice, and demonstrates how this influences and distorts our intuition.   As a result of this book, I feel more confident and freer to express myself spontaneously! Tuning in to my first impressions is fun and actually gives me a greater sense of well-being and living in the moment, wow!  Another great source of well-being and Instantaneous Transformation is [[ASIN:1888043180 Being Here: Modern Day Tales of Enlightenment]] by Ariel and Shya Kane. This lovely anthology gives me a window into living with ease and transforms everyday circumstances into life giving opportunities. I can experience enlightenment now! Without any complicated discipline, Guru, or hoops to jump through. Thanks to the Kanes and Gladwell for giving us modern day access to a truly satisfying life.
B0000VCZK2|5.0|I remember reading a review of the Quadrilogy when it first came out.  It said that this was one of the best box sets the reviewer had seen.  I must say I am inclined to agree!

0375424474|5.0|Inner Fish is a fantastic book for those interested in studying biology, zoology, genetics, or paleontology.  Shubin weaves together each of the fields throughout the adventurous read.  Literally, there really isn't a dull moment.  I read the book in two days, and it took that long only because I read it at work.  This text is also a great review for those of us who studied life sciences in college more than a few years ago, but haven't had a lot of scientific involvement since.  However, for those currently in these fields, this book may be a bit simplistic.  Shubin (purposefully, I am sure) keeps the use of scientific terms to a minimum when describing genetics, anatomy, and embryology.  Highly recommended.
8799701650|3.0|My mother gave me this book when I expressed interest in learning Latin. She also gave me a Latin-English dictionary and a copy of Wheelocks.  She found this book did not stand alone to learn Latin, although the author claims it should.  I thought I was getting some type of grasp when another package arrived, including the Student Manual and the Vocabulary list.  Now I am getting somewhere.<br /><br />I am moving slowly, but also utilizing Wheelock's Readings CD which has a pronunciation guide.  This has been very helpful for me considering Lingua Latina recommends one read the chapters out loud. Prior to the Wheelock's CD I was butchering the Latin words in Lingua Latina.  I have since ordered the CD for this text, but it only includes the first 10 of the 30 chapters.  There is no audio CD for the other 20 chapters.  I have also ordered the College Manual.<br /><br />Clearly, for me this book does not stand alone to learn Latin as it says it will.  However, once I had the tools I am learning the language at a decent pace.  The lack of any English can make it an uphill curve at first, but once I was able to climb the mountain of the first few chapters I seem to be doing fine.<br /><br />I am giving this three stars because I had to purchase or receive as gifts so many other products in the series just to start out. I know several foreign languages including ASL, so I know it is not that I have a problem learning languages. I think this book should come with the Student Manual and English-Latin Vocabulary as a set.
B000TDFLFM|3.0|The more Tull reviews I read the more I'm convinced of how futile the whole enterprise is. The one thing that is undoubtedly true is that music appreciation is a subjective matter and the stupidest thing to do is hold our fellow listeners in suspicion or contempt simply because certain sounds cause vastly different reactions in them than they do in us. In this spirit I approach Crest of a Knave, and in particular this re-mastered edition. To echo what someone else mentioned in reference to these Tull re-vampings, simply raising lows and highs doesn't make for a better sound. Through most of these tracks the kick drum is over-bearing and thumping, and the cymbals are hissy. It's been a long time since I heard my vinyl copy of this - which went missing several years ago - and I never owned it on CD, but I don't remember having such impressions before. Enough about that, on to the music.<br /><br />I'm often surprised, even baffled, by the disparate opinions of my fellow Tull fans, but I have to remind myself that my opinions are probably stranger than most. For instance, while I like Budapest well enough, I don't think it stands head and shoulders above the average Tull song. I find it sparse and far too lengthy, and never mind who it sounds like. There are better songs on this album. One of the songs not included on the original LP, but which did appear on the CD version, which strikes me as something very fine is The Waking Edge. This is a country song. Not folk mind you, but country, as in American-style country and western.  If you don't agree, go back and have another listen, particularly to the chorus. You'll have to skip the lengthy intro which runs to a minute and a half, and which, quite frankly, is an example of the kind of superfluous musical foreplay which makes a lot of progressive rock music intolerable to me. At 3:42 there's a beautiful solo, on bass guitar of all things. Not because it's a country song, and therefore highly unusual for Tull, but because it's a good song plain and simple, I think it's one of the highlights of the album.<br /><br />Steel Monkey is a solid rock song, full of energy and muscular keyboards with Martin's false harmonics, reminiscent of ZZ Top's Billy Gibbons, sprinkled all through-out. Jump Start and Farm on the Freeway are both strong tracks, particularly for the flute and guitar breaks which fill out both songs and in which Ian and Martin display the musical chemistry that makes them one of the most entertaining duos in rock music. Said She Was a Dancer is simlar to The Waking Edge in that it's country-fied, wistful, and laid-back. It includes some of Martin's best guitar work and shows that he is equally adept at both a heavy, distorted sound as well as one which is perfectly clean.<br /><br />One of the regretable things about CDs is that you have to judge the whole album as a single unit from beginning to end. With records you had the album split into two sides and the artist was compelled by necessity to make each side function as a thing-unto-itself, and subsequently you had some sort of symmetry, or asymmetry, between the two, some sort of co-dependence or relation. The first side of Crest, on vinyl, ending with Said She Was a Dancer, constitutes a very solid Tull side. On the other hand, side two was not nearly as satisfying or coherent. You had the soft and sprawling Budapest followed by the decent but not terribly strong Mountain Men, and concluding with Raising Steam, perhaps the weakest track of the bunch. Not much of a consummation or climax, artistically speaking. The earlier CD version offered two more songs than the LP - Dogs in the Midwinter, The Waking Edge - and these tracks, although the former is not bad and the latter is excellent, even if they had been part of the LP's second side wouldn't have made side two as strong as side one. This was the last Tull album I ever owned on vinyl and maybe that's why I'm ruminating on this two-side issue.<br /><br />At any ratethere has always been something off kilter with Crest for me, and because of this I don't think it's absolutely top-shelf Tull, nor do I think it could have been. It's a new Ian Anderson vocal style for one thing. He doesn't sing on Crest as much as he speaks in tune, and he sounds like somebody else so often that it's actually a bit embarassing. One has to realize that he was about forty when Crest was recorded and one must face the fact that aging takes its toll on a person's voice, and particularly on a person who sings professionally. Getting down on a forty year-old man for not being able to belt it out like he did when he was twenty is like getting down on him for having a few gray hairs. For this reason I don't blame Ian for his more subdued style: I'm simply being honest when I say that it makes for a product which will inevitably be less magnificent than vintage Tull.<br /><br />I also have to say that I like Part of the Machine more than any of the songs on Crest. The guitar and flute breaks are nothing short of brilliant. It's quintessential Tull, but unfortunately it can't be judged as an integral part of Crest of a Knave since it was never included on it. Had it been, it would have made Crest a better album.n something off kilter with Crest for me, and because of this I don't think it's absolutely top-shelf Tull, nor do I think it could have been.

B00000K31Q|4.0|This movie is a comedy romance. It is fun for the whole family. It has a lot of great sarcasism, and also in the end, you still get the little warm fuzzy feeling you get in romances. I recommend this movie to any who appreciate sarcasism for humor.

I couldn't help but watch episode after episode because I wanted to find out what was happening and who was committing the crimes! Well worth the money.  I would recommend it to everyone.  If you liked the first 2 seasons, you'll love this one.  Great sneak peak into the 4th season as well, am looking forward to seeing it!
0618918248|1.0|This book was so boring.  I almost never stop reading a book, but I just could not go on with this one.  I even sat on the plane for an hour with nothing to do rather than continue reading this book.    Maybe there is a god and he didn't want me to read this book.
B00005JJX8|2.0|Probably one of my least favorite Hitchcock films; a movie one would have expected someone like the late George Cukor to direct. There's very little action or suspense;anyone voting this film anywhere near \\"Vertigo\\" or \\" North by Northwest\\" will be immediately interrogated by Peter Sellers' Inspector Clousseau. Oh sure, we get 3 screaming women right at the start followed by a high speed chase along the Riviera. Then what? Miles of \\"filler\\" with only a non suspenseful speedboat evasion and another high speed chase, this time commandeered by the beautiful Kelly. The rooftop climax just isn't very suspenseful to me,simply because there's no one left to suspect save a stranger, Kelly's mother, or the insurance agent. Really, it's almost as though Hitchcock didn't have enough material to work with. This production could easily have been compressed to 60 minutes, locked away in a vault, and used years later on \\"Alfred Hitchcock Presents\\". But, that's just meaningless hindsight. What is meaningful is that a beautifully photographed film, with a good backup score, was ruined by an inferior script, loaded with drivel, short on substance.
B000001FS3|4.0|I'm not really much of a U2 fan. I do enjoy some of their music, all of the music I like by the band comes from the 1980s. THE JOSHUA TREE is my favorite U2 cd from that era. The band may be Christians and express their beliefs through their music on this album but what I like is that the songs on this album is more spiritual than religious. The themes on every song can be easily relatable to anyone of any faith (or no faith), like on \\"I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For\\" and \\"Where the Streets Have No Name\\". After all these years I still cannot get tired of listening to some of U2's biggest hits like the aforementioned tracks, and \\"With or Without You\\". My personal favorite song on the entire album is the gorgeous lush ballad \\"Running to Stand Still\\". The song still sends chill down my spine. \\"With or Without You\\" is a another great ballad that I still love after all these years. It is never cliched or condescending. Bono's lyrics on the album are like poetry in my opinion. The rest of the band compliments Bono's lyrics and functions very well as one cohesive unit. Bono may be horrified or embarassed of this era but frankly he has nothing to be ashamed of, it is current work that he should be embarassed for. THE JOSHUA TREE remains an eternal classic unlike the band's last studio album.

0446691437|5.0|After having read the book with an open mind and the hope of gaining an insight into a perspective that is unlike mine I find myself moved to action, poised to leap at the possibilities ahead. I never anticipated being inspired by an artist. It¡¯s not that I have anything against artists but to this point in my life and career I have not expressed the artist side of me very often. I have come to realize that in order to properly maximize my gifts I must tap into all aspects of who I am, those I am not aware of, as well as those of which I might even be a little afraid.  Steven Pressfield is clearly qualified to write about releasing the artist within. He has experienced the highs and most definitely the lows of being an artist. Although he speaks mostly of the art of writing, his writing style and stories he shares made it easy to relate his lessons to the artist I can be. Being a man who is rarely at a loss for words, I find it frustrating that words don¡¯t seem to express the excitement I feel about the journey ahead, and the drive for which has been invigorated by Pressfield¡¯s writing.  Pressfield, through his writing, pushes the aspiring artist to force their way through the thicket, what he calls resistance, into the clearing. He explains that he too experienced the difficulties of creating, but that persistence will win the day. Any endeavor has its obstacles, the key is to actually sit and do the work, metaphorically speaking. He explains that the hardest part of any creation is the getting started, the first moments of creation, the moment of overcoming resistance.   Of the lessons I took from the reading there are a few highlights that must be mentioned. Not the least of the lessons I discovered on page 34, where the statement is made that one must attain a certain level of affluence (not necessarily monetary) and comfort before a person is capable of true self-examination. I took this to mean that the individual must be substantially free of excessive pressure and have gotten to a level of experience and ¡°knowledge¡± to be able to look at themselves with a critically healthy eye. Premature self-appraisal is dangerous, but with a properly seasoned and positioned individual, self-appraisal can be cathartic and enlightening. Maslow¡¯s concept of self-actualization leads to several questions of when and how to attain such a level, but I am confident that because of the nature of individual learning the journey to self-actualization endures as long as the heart beat of the individual. The level necessary to self-examine is not so demanding but is considerable none the less. This concept struck home with me because during my journey to receive my Masters Degree I completed a 360¢ª evaluation of myself which required me to self-examine using the responses from others. This experience tested my humility and made me look inward at the part I play in the events of my life.  Another substantial excerpt from the text was found on page 39 where Pressfield speaks of the counterfeit innovator who is inappropriately self-confident and that the real innovator is ¡°scared to death¡±. I can think of several individuals I have met who are over the top with confidence and in the end were merely projecting a false image to avoid having to prove themselves. This lesson is yet another example to the reader to remain humble and within their real capabilities.  The next lesson from the reading is particularly vexing because I am not only happy in my career but also very secure. The statement ¡°The more scared we are of a work or calling, the more sure we can be that we have to do it.¡± rocks me to the foundation because I am filled with fear embarking on my diversity quest but I am over filled with the desire and drive to do it. I fear that the drive is irresistible and that threatens the security I hold so dear.   In the further reading I found a statement on page 68 that spoke directly to my current profession as a law enforcement officer. The statement ¡°He will be dining for the duration on a diet of isolation, rejection, self-doubt, despair, ridicule, contempt, and humiliation¡± can be directly applied to my industry because there is an unexplainable insistence on sustaining the ¡°macho¡± image and gracefully allowing diversity concepts to consume them is not in the cards. As I bring the messages and lessons of diversity to the law enforcement community I know I will face opposition, most certainly ridicule, and I¡¯m sure at times humiliation. As for the non-law enforcement audience I hope to address and educate I will likely find some who would treat me to the same reception but hopefully less straight forward tactics.    On the very next page I found an interesting position Pressfield takes on being a professional at what we do. He claims that a ¡°pro¡±, as he puts it, does not over-identify with their job. I find that a little hard to agree with because some professions are not just jobs. In order to be very good at some jobs you must live them at all times. I would even challenge that ¡°artists¡± identify greatly with being artists in that they live a certain life style, in certain geographic areas of cities and the country, and even base some of their moral positions on being ¡°artists¡±. More closely to my realm of experience as a policeman, the vigilance required of a police officer cannot be put into the officer¡¯s locker at the station and left there until the next shift. A police officer somewhere along the line becomes aware of the potential for danger every situation presents through their experiences. This is somewhat sad but a fact none the less and does not mean the individual is not a professional.    Where this also speaks to me is in the indication that the amateur is fearful of action. I am afraid to commit and take those first steps in the transition.    On page 88 Pressfield tells of the composer who even while creating one pieceof music is at the very same moment composing the next. When thinking about my hopes for my diversity quest I find so many thoughts rushing through my head that I can barely contain them. I become assaulted by such a flurry of inspirations that I cannot quickly enough put them to paper; I have been force to record some digitally.   ¡°It is better to be in the arena being stomped by the bull than in the stands or out in the parking lot.¡± Pressfield says it well here that there is no victory for those who never join the battle. I am by nature a cautious man who takes very few uncalculated risks. This statement urges me to push myself forward into the unknown and let whatever will happen, in fact, happen.   There is a sentence on page 92 that, in summary, says that we are only upset by the things we allow ourselves to be upset by. I once read about the technique of making ¡°I¡± statements when having an argument or telling someone else how you feel. These two statements seem to mesh well in that during an argument we are usually angered by those things another person says or does, when in fact we are really allowing ourselves to become upset at the rudeness, or insensitivity of others. If we did not take the behaviors of others to heart we would not become upset.      Before beginning this book I first thought the title was more literal. I expected to read a book about artist and their struggle to gain respect among some group that seem to discount them. After reading the book I now understand the title to more pointedly mean the war within the self to create and perform the art in its many forms.    As I first started the text I felt as though I was reading something that I would never be able to apply to myself and my goals and hopes for the future. I could not have been much more off base. The messages within can be applied to nearly any profession or calling one receives. The struggles Pressfield details are the struggles of every one who has ever chased adream, took the leap, or dove in head first, to make their future happen.   When I first started the sections where resistance is introduced I struggled to shape my mind around what he was trying to say and the way in which he was saying it. The concept somehow eluded me but as I read further he used the term repeatedly and with varying examples. Eventually, the idea became clear and I began to be able to identify resistance in my own life.    After learning the lessons of this book I have resigned myself to the fact that I have to stop waiting for things to happen. I want good things and not only for my own sake but for the betterment of the world around and I have to stop thinking opportunity will come to me. I have to start flooding my life with knowledge and experience in the things I find empowering and take action to make my dreams come to life.    I have already provided the title of this text to several friends, one of my superiors, and others on a similar quest. I would recommend it to every aspiring entrepreneur, anyone with a dream for their life, and anyone whom I would like to see succeed in life.
B000K15VSA|5.0|Top quality item, the 'toys' ie; the police car and the Unicorn are lotsa fun. I have watched the directors cut and enjoyed it a lot more than the old VHS version, as the film quality is superb and the new scenes don't ruin the running order of the story.The Deckard case is plastic but that does not take away any of the thought gone into this package,you also get a 3D perspex scene featuring Deckard with his gun and some lobby cards / storyboard cards.  All in all, well worth the price I paid.
B0006L89N8|5.0|\\"Men Are from Mars, Women Are from Venus\\" is a \\"must read\\" book for everyone, I believe. I am in my fifties now, and I wish I had access to this information as a young man. Over the years, it would have saved me quite a bit of confusion and misunderstanding, a lot of hurt feelings, and a great deal of time and money. As a result, I have given the book as a gift to several young men in their teens and twenties.     I've owned the book for several years, and upon my first reading, I made notes and highlighted quite a few sections of the book.  I've referred back to it several times and have profited emotionally with each consultation. In my opinion, it will make you a better man and will enhance the relationships in your life.
B000OV170W|3.0|I apologize for my last review as someone commented I gave away the ending. I guess I will just say in general, the ending was all wrong for this book and felt too forced. I knew it wouldn't be a happily ever after ending, but the ending showed poor writing I thought. I just felt like the reader got cheated out of what was a really great story until the final 20 pages.
B000ZN802W|5.0|Remember that \\"2001: A Space Odyssey\\" was not even nominated for an Oscar? Same thing with \\"Into the Wild\\". This film will stand the test of time. I was reluctant to feel that anyone could do justice to a film version of \\"Into the Wild\\" but this movie was superb. The book is difficult, especially as you already know what happens to the main character in the first chapter, but the story mesmorizes you. The film has a wonderful lead actor (again, Emile Hirsch not even nominated for an Oscar) and all the actors bring their characters to life--you deeply care what happens to them. Hal Holbrook is great, but he's always been a solid actor who delivers. Sean Penn must've poured his heart and soul into making this film. You won't forget this story. You won't forget this film.
B000YIGNKE|4.0|When I first saw this version I was a bit disappointed. It seemed just fair nothing special. However, when I saw it again I was pleasantly surprised at how much I like it.  The two principle actors did a very convincing job in conveying the emotions behind the characters.  While this version is not exactly faithful to every detail of the book, it is faithful to it's spirit.  The score is wonderful and helps to elevate this Persuasion to a 4 star rating.  Please see it again!
B0011FXLCC|4.0|Anyone expecting another glam rock electronica dance party like Supernature are sure to be disappointed in this latest release.<br />In my opinion, that's a GOOD thing. Oh there's still plenty of synth action here, just more low key and alot less heavy beats.<br />First listen makes you think of Felt Mountain, but that notion soon fades. The album starts out with the almost folksy \\"Clowns\\", then goes right into 2 really good Beatles inspired tunes with \\"Little Bird\\" and \\"Happiness\\", the latter being my favorite. \\"A&E\\", the first single, is low key at first listen, but sticks in your brain as does Happiness.<br />\\"Cologne Cerrone Houdini\\" reminds me of 60's era Shirley Bassey. I expect Goldfrapp could do a cover of \\"Goldfinger\\" quite well. Maybe they should try for the title tune to the next James Bond film! Anyway, this album definately is channeling nostalgia, particularly the 60's. I really dig at least half the songs, and the other half I'm sure will grow on me as well. It's worth it to pay an extra dollar or 2 for the special edition with the extra goodies. I recommend this album.
B0009RCPY8|5.0|I purchased these DVDs for my 4 year old granddaughter.  My son, who is now 23 watched these movies (especially the first one) at least a million times and had all the accompanying toys.  Now my granddaughter, Chloe watches them over and over again.  The first one is her favorite and if Dan Akroyd ever reads these she says she \\"loves Ray\\".  So, Ray, if you are ever in Vincennes, Indiana (between Evansville and Terre Haute on State Highway 41 - home of Vincennes University, the first Indiana College, and founded by William Henry Harrison who later became President of the United States) there is a little 4 year old girl who thinks you are just the greatest.  Who ever thought there would be second generation Ghostbuster lovers. She loves it when Peter gets slimed.  If you make a mistake on the details of the movie, she will correct you.  Thank you Amazon for having the DVD available; you made one little girl very, very happy.
B00003CXBH|5.0|This movie was compelling & full of breathtaking scenery in Columbia which was based upon the Indian tribes in the upper regions high above cascading waterfalls, to be converted by Christianity. Robert De Niro & Jeremy Irons were the leading characters of this beautiful movie which encapsulated the heart in a spellbound though dramatic conclusion. I found that these actors put more emphasis on the culture of the tribes people and their way of life which was combined to give the audience a sense of warm embrace towards the suffering and cruelty acts which occurred between the late 1700's to the early 1800 year period. A MUST HAVE for any serious Movie Buff who wishes to transcend back in time to a civilization rich & full of culture. 5 Star rating applicable.*****
0192838679|3.0|I used the Lowell Blair translation.    A lesson in morality----the moralists against the hedonists.  Dangerous liaisons, or acquaintances, is a novel against an immoral, powerful and envied class----the aristocrats; it sent a shock-wave through France.  The book is in the form of letters, which average two pages each.  One man, with his Aunt as an accomplice, sets out to conquer and seduce woman, and split a young couple through deceit and manipulation; it ends in tragedy.                    De Laclos wrote for the French army in the late eighteenth century; this was his only novel.  He does a remarkable job conveying to the reader the demeanor and uniqueness of each character, from a fifteen to a ninety year old (although the fifteen year old girl does come of as a bit too mature for her age); he is able to leave much to the imagination.  I think the use of English names would have made it easier to follow.     In the introduction by Blair, it is debated whether these people actually existed, and discretion is recommended when reading this novel.  If ones mind is prepared, I don't see where discretion is of concern.  If anything it should strengthen us in recognizing our own wrongdoing and show that that kind of life does not bring happiness----only emptiness.    Wish you well  Scott
B000E1ZBGS|1.0|After seeing the BBC version I was very disappointed.  Mostly I was disappointed in Keira's performance.  It was more or less reciting out of a book than actually becoming Elizabeth and truly acting.  She holds no candle to Jennifer Ehle.
B000BB1MIC|5.0|I love Gilmore Girls and so it was only a matter of time that I bought all the seasons.  This is one of my favorite seasons.  The DVDs are in extremely great condition and I watched this entire season in one day.  The story of the Gilmore Girls is one of my favorite and I only hope that one day my daughter and I will have their kind of relationship.
B00005JNJV|5.0|Great product (bought as a gift for my daughter) and wonderful customer service. I rarely buy stuff over the internet, but this purchase was a very good experience.

B00104QSOM|1.0|The word \\"BRILLIANT\\" appears a lot in reviews of \\"There Will Be Blood.\\" The only brilliant element to this film is Day-Lewis, otherwise the viewer is enclosed in PT Andersons ego for three audience punishing hours. \\"There Will Be Blood\\" has nearly no connection to \\"Oil!\\" by Upton Sinclair and the film actually contains only three scenes from the book. The character names are changed and most of the film stems from Anderson desire to have his audience leave the theater slack jawed at his brilliance. Which everyone seems to be doing, marching off lock step calling this film brilliant. \\"Boogie Nights,\\" was a waste of time and \\"Magnolia?\\" Well that is best left alone.     \\"There Will Be Blood\\" contains long plot and sub-plot gaps making dramatic tension imposable. That tension is made up for by the inappropriate music pounding away shouting at the viewer, \\"Bow down before me uncultured American filth for I am Paul Tomas Anderson!\\" I did see the film because I'm game and have liked films from people whose work I have otherwise disliked. But to call \\"There Will Be Blood\\" an adaptation of \\"OIL!\\" is cutting it thin. So thin in fact I think Anderson is trying to claim that he too is an American master like Sinclair. Moreover, saying this is American history or is in anyway an extension of Sinclair's beliefs is like putting a silk hat on any number of pigs ignorant of American history.    If you would like to see a film about greed, and the evils of capitalism, and has actual history involved in the story, I suggest one sees \\"Matewan,\\" by John Sales and infinitely better film about a coal strike in 1920.    And come on, do you all really think \\"There Will Be Blood\\" was so great? Or are we all just falling into line to sound smart?
B0012K1ILW|5.0|I can't believe the amount of people who don't like this cd...well yes I can b/c the lost just won't get it! This CD is wonderful a lot like worldwide but with stronger lyrics! Big ups to Miss BADU for being able to step out of the box! I love it and have not taken it out of the Car, Computer and in steady rotation on the IPOD she is in a league of her own! I love this CD best songs include: The Healer, ME, Soldier, The Cell, Twinkle, That Hump, Telephone...I guess that is most of them..LOL! Go get it if only if you are ready for a strong message to our people!
B000PFU7OO|5.0|I must say, this is an amazing movie, and CD.  It pretty much brings me to tears whenever I listen to it, and as a writer it inspires me.  I love Indie movies and music, so this was especially great. Gotta love the Lo-Fi sound of the music.  It makes it sound so natural and passionate!    It won the Academy award for the best original song, and I couldn't agree more.  Its an amazing movie and CD, and I would reccomend it to anyone.
B00000IL1K|5.0|This is my second copy of this cd.  The first was discovered by my then 16 year old daughter and after being passed repeatedly back and forth and between both cars.....well, you know how it was--it just wouldn't play anymore--she is now 20.  Now that I have the new one, my now 16year old son heard me playing it in the car and he said \\"wow\\" this is good.  He steals it from me every night and plays it when he goes to bed. Did I mention he listens to that really heavy screaming metal?  Sarah Brightman appeals to everyone--all ages and her music is timeless.  I have all of her cd's but this is by far my favorite with Harem close behind.  Buy it!
B00005JKDQ|5.0|Excellent Video.  Highly recommend this show for any families with kids.    Even as an adult this show had me laughing and wanting to see more.    The voices of the characters are fantastic.
B000WMFZMY|4.0|The production is first class.  We have waited a long time for this DVD and it is well worth it.
0060730552|5.0|I read this book and could hardly believe what I was reading.  It only took me one night to read this because I was so captured by the adventure.    Great quick read about making choices and having good luck on ones side.
B000ZN802W|5.0|Well I can't resist an adventure story and having read the excellent book couldn't wait to see this DVD. First, I have to say it is quite different from the book in not a good way. I do remember his trying to walk out of the woods in the book though I didn't catch that here. There is one part when he has all his gear and goes from the bus into the woods but it is never clear if he is trying to walk out of the woods or go deeper in. He then  eats bad berries and starts to die. Lots of matages follow.  It could have been beter in this respect. That was a tension filled part of the book, at least for me, and it was skipped here. There are also various Hollywood elements (gratuitous nudity that has nothing to do with the book - just Sean Penns adolescent fantasies) one would expect, and yes, it does feel like an acting student film at times. All that being said, it is an ambitious and freewheeling attempt at depicting an interesting and tragic story in a beautiful place and it works on a certain level. I would recommend this to anyone.  Oh, and whoever the older man was who drives Chris to his entry into the wilderness was - he stole the movie. His acting alone is worth the price of the DVD.
0316113506|5.0|While this review is as enthusiastically positive as the previous ones, it comes from a different perspective. My view is based on years of consulting with top leaders of major organizations about their own performance and that of their company. Too bad that SPARK wasn't available sooner. Now we realize that a physical fitness program, especially with the kinds of experiences that Dr. Ratey describes, is an essential part of the career development  plan of any would be top manager. Further, Dr.Ratey's suggestions for dealing with high pressure situations are especially helpful for those who already are in positions of heavy responsibility. And the scientific and clinical content are fascinating to any one.
0307387178|4.0|What can I say that hasn't already been said?  The only part of the book I didn't care for was Krakauer's interjections of his own experiences.  I appreciate what he was trying to do but it didn't fit in with what he was trying to accomplish in this book.  That being said the other 95% was excellent and very much worth reading.  A part of me marvels at Chris's strength and determination but at the same time a part of me just wants to shake some sense into him.  I guess there's nothing left to say except, \\"tragic\\".<br /><br />Coming in at a little over 200 pages it was a quick read.  Very gripping.

0743482883|5.0|I took a break from my historical romance novels and read this.  Boy am I glad I did.  It was a page turner, reading it in 2 days.  I loved how Jaine and Sam said and did what they felt, too many H/H don't act on their true feelings- they just meshed together after the initial idea of trying to exist as neighbors.  The chemistry between them was great and the book made me laugh over and over again.  I truly enjoyed this book and you will too!
0452289963|3.0|Back in 2000 I read Tolle's \\"The Power of Now\\" (TPON), and thought so highly of it that I included it in the \\"Must Read\\" list at the end of my own book. As such, I figured \\"A New Earth\\" just might be as valuable to me as TPON was at that time.<br /><br />I read this book over a weekend and my first impression was that it was a solid effort, and that it was essentially a hybrid of TPON, with the primary difference being that it's written in a prose as opposed to a Q&A format. The fact that it's similar to TPON isn't necessarily a negative, for that book had some very valuable content in it that's clearly worth hearing again.<br /><br />Is it a life changing work? Well, the truth is it all depends on YOU. If you're considering buying it because Oprah recommends it, but you haven't read a single book in the spiritual growth/personal growth category in the past, then my sense is that you might become a bit frustrated with its esoteric nature. A better choice as a first book might be \\"The Four Agreements\\" by Don Miguel Ruiz, as he likewise addresses the power of the mind to overtake us if we don't learn to cultivate the ability to step back from its ramblings. A book I read recently that would also be a wonderful first title to read in the category is called \\"The Belief Formula\\" by Pete Koerner, as it talks in detail about thoughts and provides practical ways to get more in control of them. This book would be of particular benefit to anyone who would like a bridge from traditional religious training to the more mystical teachings of authors like Eckhart Tolle.<br /><br />If, on the other hand, you are a person who has read a few to several books in this category, then \\"A New Earth\\" is another quality title to read as you continue to walk your path of self-discovery. If you've already read TPON by Tolle, as noted above you'll notice some obvious similarity between the two books, but this book does have some new content that is certainly worth reading.<br /><br />One thing I didn't like is that the book's subheading, (i.e., Awakening to Your Life's Purpose) suggests that this topic is a major point of discussion throughout the book, but actually it's not. The whole idea of \\"life purpose\\" isn't addressed in any significant way until chapter nine of a 10 chapter book. And, when it is talked about, it's not by any means a primer on how to identify your purpose in this life from a worldly point of view (what you are to do while you are here). Note that Tolle's discussion about purpose is on a much deeper, mystical level.<br /><br />As a final point, before buying this book I took the time to read a broad cross-section of reviews about it on Amazon.com (from 1 star to 5 stars).  One thing I did find troubling in some of the negative reviews was the Oprah bashing that some chose to do. People who think that her sole motivation for getting behind this book so aggressively was to create yet another financial windfall, or to establish some sort of new religion  are, in my view, sorely mistaken. Anyone can see that she really does care about the world, and is committed to doing something to raise global consciousness. What's so wrong with that?

B00102F5WK|3.0|Back in the 1960's, people used to protest the Vietnam war by either staging rallies, demonstrations and the likes or, if you could play an instrument, sing a song. Nowadays, the in-thing to do apparently is singing songs and making movies. And ultimately, that's what these films come across as: excuses to rant and make speeches against the evils of whatever the film's subject is about. \\"Rendition\\", a story centering around a controversial government policy, is that kind of film that doesn't really mind whether you like the film; just as long as it tells you awful and terrible certain things are.    Egyptian-born Anwar El-Abrahimi is on his way back to the United States after a trip to see his pregnant wife Isabella and son. But information comes to light that he may have had a conversation with terrorist Rashid Salimi so the US deports him to be \\"interrogated\\" for information, with brutal questioning methods. Anaylist Douglas Freeman is hired to watch the questioning while the leader, Abasi Fawal, has been the target of assassination attempts with his daughter Fatima perhaps involved somehow. That's not even scratching the surface as we see Isabella asking an old friend/flame Alan Smith for help who has connections to a senator as well as Corinne Whitman, the woman who initially requested the interrogation.    Thanks to Paul Haggis (who directed the similarily heavyhanded \\"In the Valley of Elah\\" and the abysmal \\"Crash), I grouped characters in films like this a \\"plot puppet\\", characters whose sole existence is to stand on whatever side of a subject yet have no real emotional connection to the audience. Sure the actors, namely Meryl Streep and Jake Gyllenhaal, do solid work but they never feel like fully formed characters and just do variations of their central political stance: Streep wants information no matter how, Witherspoon cries and wants her husband back and Gyllenhaal is conflicted about what he's doing. You can praise the acting sure but can't really praise the character itself.    The film however does argue a strong point although anyone with common sense will tell you the message before the film even says it. Practices like \\"extraordinary rendition\\" are inhumane and brutal and has far-reaching consequences for those it touches is kind of obvious. It's like a war movie saying \\"war is hell because we kill people\\" or an ad saying \\"smoking causes cancer\\". However, the film did at least bring the attention of the policy in the open and some, like myself who never even heard of it, are now aware of it and can offer opinions to it.    If you can get past the rather implausible character connections (watch this: daughter of official is dating guy who wants to kill official who is interrogating a possible terrorist with US employee who is in talks with US senator who started interrogation who meets possible terrorist's husband), it's an alright film but as to what the film wants to be, well it's not here. It's more like a protest speech morphed into a movie.

0307277887|4.0|Having been introduced to the show before even knowing there was a literary basis for it, I had high hopes for this book. I was not disappointed. Lindsay does a superb job of engaging us with his now iconic anti-hero, making Dexter a fully realized human being who is charming and repulsive in almost equal measure. Though some reviewers have expressed a preference for the televised version, I think this book makes a solid companion piece that will fit nicely on the shelf of any fan of the series.  I'd also urge anyone who enjoys the deliriously twisted world of Dexter to check out Crimson Orgy, a new novel by Austin Williams that blends dark humor and jolting suspense/horror to great effect.
B00008OWZC|5.0|This is an excellent album. If you have not heard this, you have missed a big part of what Led Zeppelin is about. What I especially liked about it is that shows sides of Led Zeppelin which you do not hear if you buy greatest hit compilations. I personally like Led Zeppelin best up to this stage. What came later is not as good - in my view.
0812580346|3.0|I agree with many of the reviewers who liked the idea but found the execution of the story wanting. Also, I found a big flaw in the whole \\"is the future immutable or not\\" question.    SPOILERS FOLLOW    One of the big questions in the story is whether the future envisioned can be changed. It takes a hugely coincidental event (Theo's brother's suicide) to demonstrate that it can be. BUT, millions of people were killed during the two minutes when everyone went unconscious. Certainly most of those people would still have been alive 20 years in the future if the event had not occurred and many would have appeared in others' visions. That alone should easily have answered the \\"can the future be changed\\" question.

0143038419|2.0|I waited for this book from the library for a few weeks and finally got it!  I started to read it with the excitement which wore off after a couple of pages, when I found myself thinking about something else while reading... The author is trying to be funny and philosophical, but is simply annoying and shallow, and self-absorbed!  I gave this book 2 stars for the idea and because I learned about the meaning of beads in Eastern meditation.  I may try to read it further, hoping to find some more educational facts about the places the author visited. But it is definitely not going to touch my soul!  Too much crying on the floor over nothing!  If you want a good memoir read: \\"Three dog life\\" - simple, deep, very engaging, and \\"The glass castle\\"...

Any tricks or tips from other owners of this boxed set would be most welcome as I'm getting frustrated to the point of sending it back for a replacement.
B000ZIYIVO|5.0|I dislike the French language and I don't care much for the country either, and despite all of this, I loved this movie.  The subtitle translations were sub par, but everything from acting to cinematography was top notch.  Paris in black and white is a revelation.  Made me want to go there.  Jamel whathisface was brilliant, adorable, touching and goofy.  I wish I could find someone like that character to love.  Rie whatsherface was also brilliant.  The movie dances on simple spiritual principles.  Non judgment.   Neverending acceptance, continuous comprehension and alas finding the voice of ones own truth.  Beautiful.
B00003CX5P|5.0|While I think TPM was the second weakest of the 6 films it's still Star Wars and that put it well above most movies in my book.  The pacing of the action is good and it had some very memorable lightsaber battles.  Some people find Jar Jar Binks to be incredibly annoying, but I really did not feel this way.  It doesn't have the flavor of the original trilogy, but that might have something to do with being made 16 years later.  As for the DVD itself, the picture and sound quality are superb as with all the Lucasfilm releases on dvd.  This is a must for any Star Wars fan.

This results in talented managers being alienated by talented staff, leading to failure for the entire organization. This book provides the insight, analysis and guidance to effectively lead diverse teams and waste less time struggling against them.
B000WS4QJG|5.0|Thriller 25 is still Thriller not Thriller remix so it will always get my five stars and for the 7 bonus tracks I won't rate them, but what makes you wanna buy this album again?! Well if you want special remixes you will find plenty since the past 25 years but Thriller 25 comes with 7 bonus tracks not remixes, they are reworked singles from the originals DEFIANTLY they don't compare to the originals, what do you expect! Nobody Can Mess with \\"Thriller\\"! In 2001 Thriller was released in a special edition of four mega albums on Epic and each disc included demos, outtakes, and insightful interviews with key collaborators. It was an ideal release for the 19th anniversary, and in 2008 I am glad that Thriller 25 went the other way and included bonus tracks. It is great to listen to the new generation signing Michael's songs and that's why Thriller 25 is worth your money.
B000K7VHLY|5.0|Romeo & Juliet is a great take on Shakespeare's classic play. The dialogue stays true to the original but the movie is set in modern time which makes this film modern, edgy, and fresh. Leonardo DiCaprio and Claire Danes make the perfect star-crossed lovers, their chemistry is very intense and breathtaking. This film is so colorful, imaginative, and makes your head spin (in a good way), and the music is just outstanding, you have to pick up the soundtrack as well. I highly recommend this spacey but delicious rendition of the ultimate love story.
0307383415|5.0|This is a fascinating memoir. Barack Obama is an extremely skillful, perceptive and intelligent writer. I found the story especially gripping when he writes about family members and their relation to him. His grandparents, his mother's family are one center here. But his Kenyan father and his half- brothers and half- sister are also complex characters whose story  he tells well. In general he writes with sympathy and understanding of the characters, show himself to be a compassionate observer. The question of his own identity especially in terms of the black- white racial divide in America is an important theme of the work. Much of the book will have to do with his sense of the oppression and exclusion African- Americans know in American society.<br />I found the career part of the book in which Obama tells about his work as community- organizer slightly less interesting but also revealing of his character and interests. I have read his subsequent more politically programmatic later work (The Audacity of Hope)  and find this present book on the human level far more interesting.<br />I would highly recommend this book as a work of literature even were Obama not to be the important political figure, that he is. However I must say I was a bit troubled at the thought that someone so troubled about what America is, so aware of its failings and problems- so seeming to share resentments at what it has done to so many of its citizens- would become the President of the United States. It is possible of course to think in opposite terms, that precisely his familiarity with the problems at the most difficult social level will help make a new kind of President. As others have said he seems fundamentally a compromiser and conciliator. His way of dealing in this book with its problematic characters, most notably his own father, reflect this very well. But in the kinds of conflicts and struggle America faces in this world it may well need someone who believes in its rightness more strongly- and will be able to advance its interests more powerfully.<br />I do not know for certain about this.I am simply reporting my feeling.<br />I do know however that responsible American citizens who want to understand the man who at the moment seems most likely to be the Democratic Presidential nominee ( March 2008) would do well to read this outstanding book.ly- and will be able to advance its interests more powerfully.

B00005QDW1|3.0|Rock Steady by No Doubt is their last studio album before Gwen went solo, and boy that was biggest mistake she ever made. Gwen can't sing but the band rock! Gwen is all about image and looking good (which she rarely achieves) she knows her voice is lacklaster and that's why the only thing she can focus on is the materalistic BS! Rock Steady has too many producers and not a clear and simplistic sound. Songs I do like include: Platinum Blonde Life, Don't Let Me Down, In My Head, Hella Good, and Running. The rest of the tracks are over-played and filler. Hopefully the band will reunite in years to come but the talent and success doesn't go to Gwen, it goes to the hard-working and under-appreciated guys.
0060575816|4.0|Spoiler-Free: Sabriel is a great fantasy novel, with great emphasis on character development, which is always important.  This was my first fantasy novel with tales of necromancy and I was quite impressed on where Nix went with the topic.  Sabriel is an absolutely lovable heroine and the other characters are good fun too.  I haven't read the other novels but Lirael is next on my list and I am excited.  Nix has a great writing method, because he concentrates on the moment and feeling. He doesn't spend so much time creating a backdrop or background, because these things can easily be explained along the way. Garth Nix really appeals to his audience and creates fun stories that aren't made to provoke anyone.  I am a devoted Christian and its hard for me to find a great fantasy novel that doesn't steer me away from my faith, and Garth Nix is quite friendly when it comes to speaking of religion.  I had a difficult time reading Pullman's novels, even though they were fantastically written, because of the religious turbelence in His Dark Materials.  If you are a Christian, then I do reccomend you to read this for the thrill of adventure.  It does dive into some elements about death and afterlife, but it is all just great fantasy to me. So if you are a parent thinking of picking this up for your child, just be aware that it does have some afterlife elements.  Beside all that, Nix has to be my favorite or one of my favorite authors. Even though the book doesn't induce a lot of thrill, it was still a blast to read, for the whole interesting universe it involves.<br /><br />Bottom line: Great start to the series.  Not Garth Nix's best novel, but still lives up to his name as a great writer of Fantasy.
B000XUUQQK|4.0|I am not sure what to make of the so called sequel to the more supernatural based original. On a first viewing, there is some scope for seeing the film as having a degree  of the supernatural.However, the producers still go with the reductionist view, even to the point of linking the sequel with the character in the first film, as having been treated by Tobin Bell's character.  The treatment of the story line has been extended with some great FX shots done on the cheap. This is a so-called low budget film, and yet it manages to make some high end production values. Ghost House Production   has once again made a film work well on a low budget, just as it makes film work on higher budgets.  The DVD  is very well done, with great sound, and some good commentary on the Producer/writer track; Its a pity that the Supernatural element was lost.
B00005JKNC|5.0|We've always loved the Majestic, but it's especially poignant watching it now, as America is at war. The small town that rescues Jim Carey's character is what we all want; the sincere sharing of joys and sorrows with others that have been where we've been.<br /><br />I don't know why The Majestic ended up being a relative sleeper. (For that matter, I don't know why Saving Grace, Pure Luck, and other brilliant movies with brilliant acting ended up that way, either.) Except for in the Majestic, the lead was played by a man who everyone expects to see playing someone wacky or stupid, no exceptions. It's a shame. Carey was brilliant in this thought-provoking, heart-warming film.
B000P12LWY|5.0|This series is very seductive, grapping you in very quickly.  Great casting and lovely scenery (all shot in Ireland).  While taking some historical liberities it's still a 5 in my book.  Sam Neill alone makes it a knockout though the casting throughout is superb.  Cheers

B0006Q1UL6|5.0|What a great story.  The illustrations perfectly match the simple words.  Any book that Mommy can memorize and then recite in the car while the toddler turns the pages is OK with me.<br /><br />Actually, I'm not the only Mommy I know who has this one memorized -- a friend got stuck in an elevator with little ones and passed the 25 minutes until they were rescued by reciting this story.<br /><br />It's a great one -- little children understand the determination, the perplexity, the fear, and the contentment of the little bird as he goes on his quest.  The drawings are just right.  And then the wonderful ending.  Ah!  How sweet is childhood.<br /><br />This is a lovely story.
B000VNMMR0|3.0|I will never forget the experience of sitting in the movies and seeing \\"DIE HARD\\" , the original, for the first time. It was unlike anything I had seen before as far as non-stop action, great characters and an explosive story. The hero, Bruce Willis, was a wise-cracking, NYPD officer with more guts then brains and the villain, Alan Rickman, was the greatest villain since Jesse James. Well, the years passed on, other films took on the non-stop action sequences rarely as exciting or as well-done as DIE HARD. All the heroes took on the wise-cracking, lovable, tough guy hero. But rarely did any of them approach the fun or intent of DIE HARD. So I took a passing interest in the DIE HARD sequels and recently watched LIVE FREE OR DIE HARD. Well, the beginning was very promising, a story that pulled me in and kept me on the edge of my seat but somewhere about 2/3rds of way through the film it started to lose me. I know it's a DIE HARD film franchise and a DIE HARD film must<br />always try to outdo itself with the explosions and killing and making Bruce Willis look invincible but c'mon they had a really good film going here and it just peters out. The action became too unbelievable, the explosions too unnecessary and the whole story line seemed to fall apart so as we can have one more chase or one more explosion. Hey, you know what you're getting when you watch anything in the DIE HARD series but since when does making a good film take a back seat to entertainment, I though a good film would be more entertaining then mindless action. Also John McClain has gone from regular Joe to some kind of superhero. Maybe, it's just been too long and my tastes have changed.

0743455967|5.0|I bought this book never reading a stephen king book in my life. But I am a writer, and I figured that if he is the number one novel seller of all time, there must be a reason.<br /><br />In the beggining of the book he talks mostly about his early life. About how he started writing and how his mother thought he should have a \\"backup proffession\\", about his drinking and drugs (yes! can you believe it?) and then it leads into the on writing part, which explains in great perfection what it takes to be a writer. I thought this book was PERFECT. In the end he even tells you a list of books to read that he liked, and he talks about his accident and writing and afjkl;as;fjkl it's just wonderful. If your reading this review your either one of two people.<br /><br />TO THE FANS: If your a fan of his work, I definitely think you should read this book. Knowing about how he grew up and his background, about his drinking and wife, about how he didn't give up, is an awesome story, and you'll feel like you really met the real stephen king behind the books.<br /><br />TO THE WRITERS: DEFINITE definite definite must buy. I have two or three pages with quotes from the book on the walls of my room, and every day I read these and remember to keep writing. Before I read this I was an idealist, I always wanted to be a writer and would write here and there, I had a book I had been working on for three years going nowhere, and I remember reading a part where he says he tries to get 2000 words a day, and that he suggests to new readers to write at least 1000 words a day. At the time I thought this was impossible, but over reading it and following his directions, and reading it over and over, I am now on a new fantastic novel and I write about 2-3000 words a day and feel incomplete if I don't do so. My writing has never been better. This book is like the writing bible, I refer to it frequently and when I feel down about my writing or start to stray, I read two or three highlighted passages and I'm already back, reading and writing again.<br /><br />I've now read three of his fiction books, and plan to read all of his works. I think there is no other book that can help a writer, and no other book to help you (if your a fan) to know the REAL stephen king. :) 10 out of five. I know you don't know me or where I live, or what I look like, that all I represent to you is a review on the internet on amazon, but I'm telling you this, BUY IT. You won't regret it. Especially if your a writer...ading and writing again.    I've now read three of his fiction books, and plan to read all of his works.

0312360266|5.0|When i ordered this book i was just looking for a space filler; i got bored while waiting for Breaking Dawn. Honestly, i didn't really think i'd like it that much. Well, obviously i was blown away. And now i find myself waiting for the third book in the House of Night series. This goes right under the Twilight series on my list of favorites; which is number one of course.
B000TERFGO|5.0|This is my favorite Coltrane album, even over the excellent Giant Steps. Actually, I'd have to say that it's my favorite jazz album overall...ever-so-slightly nudging aside Miles Davis' Kind of Blue, which is phenomenal in its own right. It's just that good. There's not much I could say that hasn't already been said better by other reviewers here. The bottom line for me is that this album is a masterpiece that never gets stale - my copy of this version is ten years old and still spins frequently (though it has moved over to the iPod). Do your ears a favor and give this one a listen.
B00005JPNY|1.0|At best, its a knock off of some CGI filled fantasy films that came out long ahead of it.  At worst, its a disjointed attempt to take pot shots at organized religion.  This might have been a good story if it hadn't already been written by CS Lewis.  For those reviewers who seem to think there isn't an anti-religious theme, they simply haven't done their homework.  Pullman makes no bones about his atheist views and his opposition to organized religion.  For the most part, big bucks Hollywood seems to have reigned him in for the sake of profits.  So what is left is a convoluted, hard to follow collection of scenes that depend on special effects to make up for the utter absence of a cohesive plot.  Atheists won't like it because it doesn't score any points against the church.  Christians will hate it because Pullman is quite outspoken in his intentions to use whatever money he can make to launch further attacks on organized religion.  Fans of the genre will either be taken in by the effects and ignore the lack of a story, or they'll see it for what it is.  My advice, catch this one on free TV when it comes around.  It didn't seem to play that well at the theater and I wouldn't expect DVD sales to keep it off of CBS for long.  Save your money.  You'll be glad you did.

B000002UA0|5.0|Piper at the Gates of Dawn is Pink Floyd's first album and in combination with Relics is probably the best way for a listener to introduce him or herself to pre-Dark Side of the Moon Pink Floyd.<br /><br />If you are one of these people, it is important to note that Piper at the Gates of Dawn represents the pre-David Gilmour and Roger Waters led Pink Floyd.  This is the Pink Floyd of Syd Barrett, and can seem quite a bit different from the later Pink Floyd releases that Roger Waters led.<br /><br />Piper at the Gates of Dawn is probably the definitive psychedelic rock album of the 1960's.  The song writing is excellent and the musicianship is fantastic.  The songs Astronomy Domine and Interstellar Overdrive are probably two of Pink Floyd's best ever. Astronomy Domine has even made appearances in some of the most recent Pink Floyd and David Gilmour concerts (and David Gilmour wasn't even in Pink Floyd when the album came out).  On the whole, the album really holds up well and shows that with Syd Barrett, Pink Floyd would probably still have had a fantastic, albeit different career. Of course, with psychedelic music, one has to wonder about consistency, and this is probably the most consistent of the early Pink Floyd.  That and perhaps [[ASIN:B000002U0D Relics]] (which is a compilation package) really make these the logical entry point into the world of Pre-Dark Side of the Moon Pink Floyd.

B00001U0GQ|4.0|James Fenimore Cooper's \\"The Last of the Mohicans\\" was written about a time when the frontier was in upstate New York.  Director Michael Mann transforms Cooper's tale into an action movie, if only loosely based on the original story.<br /><br />Daniel Day-Lewis is superbly authentic as Hawkeye, a white man and adopted Mohican, who travels the upper Hudson River Valley with Indian companions Chingachgook (Russell Means) and Uncas (Eric Schweig).  The opening sequence, in which the party hunts a deer and then must deal with a hostile Indian raiding party, sets the tone of the movie.  The American frontier is dark, dangerous, and caught in the middle of a war between the French and the British.<br /><br />Hawkeye and his friends end up escorting the daughters of British Colonel Munro to Fort William Henry, under siege by the French, and their Indian allies under the evil Huron warrior Magua (in a menacing performance by Wes Studi). Hawkeye will fall in love with Cora Munro (Madeleine Stowe), and the dramatic thread of the movie will be their efforts to stay alive long enough to be together.<br /><br />When the fort must be surrendered, the British are granted safe passage by the French to leave the area, a promise not honored by the vengeful Indians under Magua.  The resulting massacre is portrayed as an extended and vicious fighting sequence.  Hawkeye and his friends will pursue the kidnapped Cora and bloodthirty Magua, triggering a last violent confrontation that not all will survive.<br /><br />As noted, this movie is only loosely based on the original tale, which was more about the Mohicans and less about Hawkeye. However, Mann makes up for it with lush imagery of the Colonial American frontier and some gritty action sequences, producing a suspenseful reimagining of the story that should keep viewers hooked to the end.
B00000C28M|4.0|This recording of Brahms's first Piano Concerto is not so unorthodox as Leonard Bernstein says in his famouns speech. The tempi are slow, but there are recordings even slower (like Zimmermann's with Bernstein, DG). But the Glenn Gould's Brahms sounds like Bach, as everything he played!  It must be said that is a live recording, and you can hear people coughing, speaking etc. But it is a enjoyable performance of this concerto.    Nelson Camargo from São Paulo, Brazil

While waiting for more yarn to come in for a never-ending sweater,I picked up this book and some yarn and knitted my first pair of socks, ever. I did it to kill time. Now I am hooked. This book is extremely logical and I just did what it said, step-by-step, and voila! All I want to do is socks now - fast, easy, fun, you can make them more complicated, inexpensive, give them away...and who doesn't need socks? Hurray for Ann Budd!!!
B000N3STBQ|5.0|\\"Black Celebration\\" was the album thousands of dyed hair and make-up kids in the late 80's poured their alienated hearts out over. \\"Black Celebration\\" is almost unmatched in its relentless gloom-mongering and only on the closing \\"But Not Tonight\\" does the tone turn even vaguely optimistic. (Interestingly, the lyrics are reinstated on this booklet after being omitted from the original CD.) Not that the music wasn't outstanding. That was the main attraction about the richer sounding \\"Black Celebration.\\" The state of the synthesizer had risen considerably since \\"Some Great Reward,\\" and the breakthrough of Compact Discs had just begun. It brought a fuller sound out of Depeche Mode and gave them more room to deepen -- or maybe darken -- their sound. They had also stumbled into areas when less meant more, as the haunting \\"Stripped\\" exemplifies.<br /><br />Just because the mood was dark also did not mean \\"Black Celebration\\" stayed mired in dirges. The frantic tempo of \\"A Question of Time\\" continued DM's ongoing string of modern rock dance singles, keeping them astride the likes of New Order and positioning them as the anti-Duran Duran. (Even though all three of these bands were at their creative peaks in this period.) The DM videos were getting better and it was just one more year or so before all three bands were world wide massive stars at the same time!!! (Duran Duran with \\"[[ASIN:B000024KBZ Big Thing]],\\" New Order with \\"[[ASIN:B000002LCK Substance]]\\" and DM with \\"[[ASIN:B000ESSTL0 Violator]].\\") It was certainly heady times for lovers of synth-rock, and \\"Black Celebration\\" remains one of my favorite CDs from that period.<br /><br />The remaster is superb, filling the room with sound WITHOUT just making the CD louder. The nearly hour-long historical film is interesting, watching the band work out issues and seeing mid-twenties DM dealing with the earnestness of being young and creative.

B000UJ48XG|5.0|I absolutely fell in love with THE GULAG ORKESTAR when I was first introduced to it a little over a year ago. The beautiful Balkan melodies, the sad, nostalgic sense the songs gave you (especially the first half of the album).    When I listened to the LON GISLAND EP next, I was somewhat disappointed. It didn't have anywhere near the same power, the same emotional effect Condon's former album did. I fell out of touch. Finally, I was reintroduced a month or so ago by a friend, who gave me a copy of THE FLYING CLUB CUP. I'm hooked. This is one hell of an album. In many ways, it is even better than GULAG; it is sonorous and melodious and full of those same complex emotions that made the first album so enchanting.    Condon has really done something great here. This blend of European and American sounds is truly fresh and beautiful!
B00008DDSC|5.0|James Spader and Maggie Gyllenhaal definitely ignite the screen with the bizaar tale of a twisted, weaving S & M relationship. Two people who are made for each other, by chance, encounter one another when James (Mr Grey) hires Maggie as a secretary. Both feeding off of each others weaknesses Maggie suffers from cutting and unable to cure it in a mental hospital and James (Mr. Grey) who gets off on sadomasochism but doesn't want to be that way.  Both personalities compliment (or satisfy)  the others perverse desires and lead you through an original storyline that keeps you intrigued to the ending. A movie not for everyone but definitely entertaining and highly recommended.
0671042858|4.0|To be 100% honest, Stephen King isn't really my kind of writer. However, I needed to pick a book to read for school, and I was trying to reach out of my comfort zone. And there was a Stephen King book, and it was fairly short and most likely easier to understand than any other King book, so I decided to read it.<br /><br />If I were to rate this book on how much I liked it, I would have given it three stars. However, as it is... it wasn't a bad book. It's just, like I said, not my thing. It was good and interesting, but at parts it seemed slightly repetitive. I also didn't like the way the whole book (plus or minus a few small parts) was written all about Trisha in the woods. It would have been interesting to have an outsider's perspective, either at the beginning or the end, at least. But still, it was pretty well written. I liked it.
1582701709|4.0|Rhonda Byrne has achieved something wonderful in The Secret. She has managed to take a very simple and important concept and has used clever marketing to propel it to worldwide success. The principle that Rhonda refers to is the law of attraction, the theory that that which we focus on is gravitated towards us, or us to it. The Secret simply dresses up this very simple idea and provides references and quotes from a variety of different noted theorists in the area as to how this principle works and how you can best apply it in your life.<br /><br />People who are interested in this book are likely to have two questions; does the law of attraction actually work and, if so, is this the best book to read on the subject.<br /><br />1) Does the law of attraction work? The short answer is yes, that which we focus on and expect is more likely to happen in your life. If you think about anything that you have ever achieved, it will have involved a process of focusing on the outcome, imagining that you have already achieved it and appreciating it. It's basically like reverse-worrying about the future. When we worry about the future we focus emotionally on something that has not yet happened but we find ourselves feeling as if it already has. These strong feeling do tend to make that which we are focusing on much more likely to happen - this is known in psychology as a self-fulfilling prophecy. It happens because we expect it to happen.<br /><br />2) Is this book the best place to learn about the law of attraction? If you are not too familiar with the law of attraction then yes, this is a great place to start. It is a very deep subject and is connected to many other principles of how the mind works. The Secret is quite narrow in its approach, only detailing how to focus your mind on what you want. This it does very well, but there are other important psychological principles that are not covered in this book such as our perspective, values and present moment emotional satisfaction. Anyone who is serious about personal development will find an awareness of these areas essential to true success. Rather than it being a criticism that The Secret does not cover these other areas, this in fact is what makes the book so powerful - it clearly focuses on one important area and does it well.<br /><br />In summary, if you aren't familiar with the law of attraction but want to improve the quality of your life then this is well worth a read. Be warned it is not just an intellectual book; to get results you are going to need to apply its content to your life. If you are already familiar with the law of attraction then you will find little else in this book other than some nice examples and you may be better off reading some of the books written by the key contributors to The Secret instead for further depth of understanding.us about personal development will find an awareness of these areas essential to true success.

B0012K1ILW|4.0|Erykah Badu is easily one of the most incognito R&B artist of our day.  Her last offering was 2003's Worldwide Underground EP (it was actually a few minutes longer than the standard 45 minute threshold that are accustom to EP's) and before that was 2000's classic offering Mama's Gun.  Now ready to capture the attention of the masses once again, Erykah Badu stays in left field with New Amerykah, Pt 1.  This album takes on much of the same unique qualities that set her apart from the pack, and it's easily one of those albums you enjoy more and more each time you listen to it.  \\"Amerykahn Promise\\" is a funked-out, Parliament Funkadelic type track that features no real lyrics but is entertaining nonetheless.  \\"The Healer (Hip-Hop),\\" produced by the underappreciated Madlib, is a subdued, abstract song where Erykah uses a more prosaic delivery of her thoughts.  \\"Me\\" is a more structured, mellowed-out, soulful cut produced by Sa-Ra that is more traditional to what Erykah Badu fans are more accustom to.  \\"My People\\" is another avant-garde performance that is heavier on instrumentation, while \\"Soldier\\" is a reference to the different 'soldiers' of the worlds, namely the hustlers, the troops overseas, the ones struggling to get by, etc.  \\"The Cell\\" is another track produced by Sa-Ra that might come off to some as unusual, but Erykah is basically talking about drugs and the horrible lifestyle that can result from drug use.  \\"Twinkle\\" speaks to the ills of the nation but with a more psychedelic style, \\"Master Teacher\\" is as eccentric as it gets, and the spacey song \\"That Hump\\" reverts right back to the subject of being hooked on drugs. Her touching tribute to J Dilla on \\"Telephone\\" is probably her most impassioned cut of her life.  And she closes the album with the 'bonus' cut \\"Honey,\\" the lead-off single that is probably placed last to not distract the listener from the main flow of the album considering it is more structured than the rest. Erykah Badu's non-conventional approach to creating music is what makes New Amerykah, Pt. 1 a must have for any true Badu fan.  There's no cookie-cutter formula or category that you can place this album, and that speaks volumes to Miss Badu's creativity and uniqueness.  Let's hope we don't have to wait an eternity for the next installment.ach to creating music is what makes New Amerykah, Pt. 1 a must have for any true Badu fan.

B0013FBS20|1.0|I thought it was a great movie until the infected started acting like superhumans. I find it hard to believe that a virus can enable a human to scale the side of a building unaided and to crawl across the ceiling of a room like some supernatural creature. Give me a George Romero zombie flick any day. They are at least believable. The dog in the flick was the best part of it.
B000005B0U|5.0|With 18 tracks that clock in at a little over one hour, the affinity that Dan Aykroyd has for the blues delivers an outstanding soundtrack.<br /><br />With a venerable who's who of legends - B.B. King, Eric Clapton, Junior Wells, Aretha Franklin, Bo Diddley, Steve Winwood - this is a collection of the sounds and voices from those who shaped the music industry in the latter half of the 20th century.<br /><br />The Paul Butterfield Blues Band kick things off by raising the roof with Born in Chicago, but it's the pair of cuts by the all-star band - Louisiana Gator Boys - How Blue Can You Get? and New Orleans (with the Blues Brothers) which clearly demonstrate the premium that was placed on the music.<br /><br />A great example of a soundtrack that stands on its own merits, Aykroyd opens up the briefcase one last time and lets the music do the talking.
B0010X745K|5.0|Simply fantastic. All I'm gonna say without giving anything away is that when I saw this at the theaters everyone in the audiance including myself clapped and cheered when \\"she\\" got it!!!!  Fantastic errie flick! One of the best Stephen King movie adaptations!  Very shocking ending! It will stick with you for a while after seeing the flick!
0449227545|1.0|When a writer is out of ideas, he writes about characters. And when he has no characters, he writes the Hammer of Eden. A briefly intriguing idea is lost through lackluster plotting, flat characters and painfully inadequate dialogue. The idea of a terror group actually causing an earthquake with a seismic measuring truck is just so preposterous that no suspension of belief is possible. Throw in a hippie commune, a female FBI agent and a bunch of forgettable characters, and you actually feel sorry for the trees that were sacrificed for this production. I don't mean to be cruel to KF, but it's very frustrating reading page after page expecting something different to happen, only to be disappointed.
B000GRTQSE|5.0|I love this record.  I think Dylan's writing on it is fascinating, his voice (while an acquired taste for some to be sure)is emotive and his band sounds great.  They can really groove.  I highly recommend Modern Times!
B00000IBVC|5.0|This was AWESOME!  Granted after seeing the freak show the Met put on with James Levine Conducting I was \\"easy to please.\\"  However, I think I overcame my bias, objectively rated the piece and logically concluded that it was SUPER AMAZING!!  lol  Get this and have fun!
B00008WT5E|5.0|I was there. Mid 70's through early 80's, listening to them in high school, the Marine Corps and college. Good Lord, am I dating myself.     But folks, this is the definitive AC/DC studio album. Not as raw as the live performances, which are astounding - but there is no better array of songs that represent the full spectrum of their shocking ability. To simply call this hard rock is a disservice, as \\"Gone Shootin'\\" will clue you in - their roots were strictly in the blues. And if you listen closely to Angus Young's guitar, you'll detect a feral dose of classical and hard core punk tossed in for good measure - no ego in his playing, just a dedication to blazing execution. This one is as good as it gets.     Yes, \\"Back In Black\\" is a great comeback album, perhaps the best in rock history. But this is the one that seemed to catch them in perfect synchronicity, right between the rougher hewn sound of \\"Let There Be Rock\\" and the more polished \\"Highway To Hell.\\"  This one never, ever gets old.    As an aside, I attended a live AC/DC show in Oakland seven years back, and sitting in front of me were two sixteen year old neophytes. One of them turned to me and casually introduced himself. \\"Hey man, we've never heard these guys, but someone told me they're all right, kind of like Nirvana.\\" I smiled, and pushed in my earplugs. They scoffed and turned away.     Halfway through a blistering Angus solo, I looked over at them - they were doubled over, holding their ears in agony.     At the end of the show, they arose, glassy eyed and unsteady. One of them turned to me and yelled: \\"DUDE, THAT WAS AWESOME! WHO ARE THOSE GUYS?!\\"      One convert at a time.

B0011HOEY4|3.0|*** 2007. Directed by Ridley Scott. Two nominations for the Oscars and two other for the Golden Globes. The film tells the story of the black NYC mobster who brought, during the Vietnam war, Asian heroin into the U.S.A.. Ridley Scott is no Francis Ford Coppola and no Sergio Leone and AMERICAN GANGSTER is just an average and long movie, without any epic dimension, about the life of a criminal. Already forgotten.
B000094HMU|1.0|This was a terrible production of a wonderful opera.  I was horrified to see what a mess the Met had made of it and poor Placido Domingo!  Despite his magnificence, the production was nauseating.  Don't waste your time.  The production conducted by Zubin Mehta and directed by Zhang Yimou was wonderful.  Granted, Sergej Larin is no Domingo, but he does a fine job (despite the fact that he's shorter than Giovanna Casolla, the Princess Turandot lol).  What can I say, the Met production was a freak show and the one filmed at the Forbidden City of Beijing was beautiful.  I felt cleansed after sitting through that Met trash!
B0001WTVUW|5.0|This scary but so important film was shown once in USSR. The close match in Soviet cinema was the movie \\"Letters of a dead man\\" describing the life after the fallout, in the shelters, and again the downfall of almost everything in 'the days after'. But even more scaring were 'nuclear' trainings, teaching films and posters in school. Every new block building was scheduled to have its fallout shelter, and the view of shelter entrances was to remind us every day: this day is possible.     We still live keeping that in mind. May be, inhabitants of all big cities may become blast targets, and maybe, others may be spared. But even more important are the main consequences of the nuclear war: the end of civilization, end of all comfort and peace provided by human society. You may survive in the blast, prepare yourself and your family to live under the ground or somewhere in 'the days after', as in 'Blast from the past' comedy, but the others, less happy survivors will later do the deadly job for the blast. That impressions, and not the 'mushrooms' dominate in 'The day after'.

0452289963|5.0|\\"A New Earth\\" by Eckhart Tolle is not just a book ... it is an experience with lasting effects.  It should be studied and contemplated on.  Its not necessarily an easy read but together with Oprah's WEBINAR broadcast on the Internet every Monday night (and available for free download on iTunes the next day) each Chapter can be readressed with the author. I also purchased the audio version of the book.  I listen to it after reading each chapter.  I feel it helps me focus and find things I missed during the first read through.
B00005O3VC|5.0|Sweet! Review number 777!    If you haven't seen this movie, and can understand sometimes complicated British humor, then get it! It has to be one of the funniest movies ever made. If you have no knowledge of British humor though you may get a bit confused, so I wouldn't recommend it if you're gonna expect nothing but toilet humor. Plus, this movie must have the most halting ending ever for a movie, and it's extremely unpredictable!    I also recommend Life of Brian, which in my opinion is just as funny as this movie.     Just be prepared for the unexpected whilst watching this movie, it's very strange. Great though!
0553260111|5.0|For some long-forgotten reason, I picked up this book while in graduate school, and was immediately hooked on the spy genre (especially after reading Ken Follett's equally good 'Triple').  Since I was working my way through school with a night job, my hours were precious and I already had an ample supply of reading material, yet I found myself unable to put down this book.  The pacing, style (only Chricton ranks as high as a page-turner in my mind), and overall story line make this a classic.  Be careful, you'll need to find the time to finish the trilogy.    The only sad part of this is viewers of the movie series will pick this up and be disappointed in how different the storyline ends.  The literary antagonist (the infamous Jackal) is a much more compelling villain, but I understand the need to keep things up to date in a movie.  I managed to finish school, but he sure made it a bigger challenge.  Overall, well worth the investment of time.  Is anyone else doing it as well these days?  I haven't found him/her yet.

B00004XPPC|5.0|I have to confess, this is not my first review of THE BRIDGE ON THE RIVER KWAI.  Way back (and I mean waaaay back) in college, my freshman English Composition teacher informed her students for extra credit she would welcome a critique of this movie, which was showing over the weekend on one of the local TV channels.  I had heard of the film (which had been theatrically released some twenty years before), but had never seen it.  \\"You will be pleasantly surprised,\\" my instructor advised.<br /><br />And I was.  After viewing this David Lean epic, I eagerly wrote a two-page critique (which I still have, somewhere).  I don't remember what kind of a grade I got. . .I only remember how impressed I was with this sweeping, grand tale of honor, duty, grit, and madness.  And having just seen this movie again, I continue to be impressed.  This Oscar winner is as timeless in its entertainment value today as it was three decades ago, or five decades ago.  Like the bridge itself, Lean patiently builds this story to a remarkable climax, an absolute showstopper.<br /><br />No need to summarize the plot; it's been thoroughly and impressively presented on the product page.  What bears repeating is this is a hauntingly beautiful film where antagonists suddenly find themselves completely and irrevocably interdependent:  the Japanese need the British POWs to build a railroad bridge over the River Kwai; the Brits need this project, this bridge to aid their enemy, to stay busy, focused, and boost their morale.  And yet, so ironically, a special forces team has been dispatched to destroy this interdependency; all these components explode (pardon the pun) when brought together, when hard decisions have to be made in the blink of an eye.<br /><br />Alec Guinness is absolutely sensational as the stubborn, by-the-book leader of the POWs; I've seen this great actor in several movies, yet this will forever remain his signature role.  Jack Hawkins, William Holden, and Sessue Hayakawa are exceptional, too.  David Lean (who, curiously enough, was not even the studio's first, second, or even third choice for director) has achieved cinematic immortality with THE BRIDGE ON THE RIVER KWAI, a masterpiece that fluidly transcends the generations.<br />--D.

B000002KGT|5.0|though not currently trendy, fleetwood mac was one of the great pop-rock bands of all time in its buckingham-nicks version. all their albums are worthwhile, but this is my favorite. song after song the emotional intensity, tight playing and infectious melodies never let up. it didn't hurt that the romantic relationships between several band member were in limbo -- if anything it added to the edge behind the lyrics. matching c. mckvie, buckingham and nicks songwriting prowess with the peerless pop rhythm section of mcvie and fleetwood, fleetwood mac was unstoppable in its heyday.

B000IFQLSW|5.0|This product--the DVD in particular--is almost like a blues primer, an ideal introduction to what makes the blues not only the most authentic and original of American music, but the best category of music out there.  For anyone who has found real blues (as in, say, anything mroe raw than the Allman Bros.) a little bit inaccessible, this is your answer.  And for real blues fans, you owe it to KWS to support this very admirable effort.  Great on every level.
B000BP5OXW|5.0|WOW!!! I saw the movie and was intrigued to read the original novel and i'm glad I did. The authot does an amazing job of putting you inside the mind of a man who has literally been alone for months. As cheesey and over-done as the whole vampire genre is, for a book that was written in 1954, Matheson added a new perspective to the classic myth by scientifically explaining what and how vampires come to be. The book is action-packed like the movie yet is very different in events that take place; for example, in the movie Robert had the dog from the beginning of the movie whereas in the book he finds the dog walking around the neighborhood one day. The ending is also amazing! Very surprising and totally different from the movie. In the movie he's called a legend because he discovers the vaccine for vampirism........in the book he's called a legend for a completely different reason!
0060763892|4.0|I've read all of James Rollin's books. This one was good, and had his usual science and history well blended but I felt his characters were still a bit shallow.  The plot with his parents was good and motivating for the character, Gray, but a bit distracting toward the end.  One thing was the science/bacteria/liver flukes info dumps at the most crucial moments in the final scenes.  There were too many tie ups of science going on when the action was taking center stage.  I found myself skipping and wanting to get to the final point that made this all matter.  Kowalski and Monk are by far the best characters. They have distinct personalities on the page, where as the rest, just talk.  Siechin is intriguing and I actually liked her the best.
B000078DOI|5.0|This is what you have to do to make this a cohesive, listenable CD. First you have to edit out the sampling nonsense on \\"Good Time Boys\\". I first input the song into Sonic Stage Mastering, cut out the 11-second piece of annoying crap, burnt it onto a CD, then back into Windows Media Player.    After patching up \\"Good Time Boys\\" I found a clever method of ordering the songs. If you notice how RHCPs \\"Californication\\" is arranged, similarities between songs and their order can be derived. For example, order the first 8 songs this way:   1)6th (best)  /1.

Nobody Wierd Like Me(OK, there's nothing like this one!)  7)11nth(best) /11.Punk Rock Classic   (like \\"Right On Time\\")  8)12th(best)  /3. Subway To Venus     (By default)     The next transition theme (9-13) is \\"cover songs and Hendrix\\".  9)2nd  (best) /2. Higher Ground  10)3rd (best) /9.

Pretty Little Ditty (like \\"Road Trippin\\", a song to unwind to as we come to the virtual end to this now GREAT cd!)    Plop these last ones here just in case you don't have the \\"Californication\\" CD handy!  15)14th (best) /Salute to Kareem [#][*][Demo Version]  16)15th (best) /4. Magic Johnson (This song sssooooo disrupts the rest of the CD unless you put it off on its own!)  17)16th (best) /Song That Made Us What We Are Today [#][*][Demo Version]    This wasn't so much a \\"review\\" as it was a \\"Public Service Announcement\\"!

B0013J559S|4.0|Sporting complex consequences for a relatively straightforward plot, The Bank Job remains intriguing throughout as each set-up leads to ever more suspenseful twists for the likeable group of ragtag antiheroes. Over-thorough character introductions cause a slower build in the early stages of the heist, but such complications likely arise from fewer liberties taken with the \\"based on a true story\\" events, and the result is a fascinating look at criminals, the corrupt, and those least guilty.<br /><br />It is 1971 in East London and a fateful bank robbery begins to take shape. In order to remove the threat of radical gangster Michael X, government officials devise a plan to rob a bank on Baker Street and retrieve damning photographs from his possession. To keep the heist untraceable back to them, an independent group of thieves, led by car dealer Terry (Jason Statham) and the cunning Martine (Saffron Burrows) are unwittingly thrown into a deadly battle against corrupt officials and London's criminal underworld.<br /><br />Jason Statham isn't your typical leading man, yet ever since Guy Ritchie's early films he has managed to keep coming back with bigger and better roles and is now thought of as an action film star. However it's here, in darker thrillers, that he finds a more sincere presence, especially as thief and scoundrel Terry. Each moral flaw creates a more dimensional character, and one worth rooting for.<br /><br />The language of the film is genuinely intriguing, as it captures wonderfully wry British slang. Cheeky sod, 12-inch mutton dagger, a bit of bother, usual skullduggery and things turning a-custard are but a few of the verbal jousts that occur between the main characters. Devoid of euphuisms, these apparently authentic words make the dialogue a particularly potent piece of the puzzle.<br /><br />The entire subplot about Michael X and his blackmailing of the British government is useful in its supposed tie to facts, but as filmed scenes in the movie, they are hardly necessary. Photographs of a princess caught in the act of promiscuity are at the root of the blackmail plot, which then goes on to include further damaging materials from Sonia Bern's brothel, also of factual importance, but equally unnecessary in the film. Michael X's involvement could have been entailed in a briefing by the 506 crew, who spill out the usual generic explanations of villains, and even Bern's entanglement could have been narrated through the details of the photos. While most of these moments have their entertainment value, essentially they serve to drag out the film's running time.<br /><br />They say truth is stranger than fiction, and The Bank Job definitely falls into that category. Pimps, thieves, spies, and government officials all collide in a robbery gone right and then terribly wrong, lending the inquisitive to ponder over how much (or little) is fabricated in this thriller. The robbery itself is merely the setup to an intricate conclusion, even though the film takes time to create plenty of suspense throughout the not-so-carefully planned heist. Though the people making demands continually change, our attention is always seated with Jason Statham's unusually intense performance. When the credits roll and the explanation that \\"the names have been changed to protect the guilty\\" flashes onscreen, we realize what a delightfully flourished yet entertaining tale of \\"doing the wrong thing\\" The Bank Job really is.<br /><br />- The Massie Twinsgraphs of a princess caught in the act of promiscuity are at the root of the blackmail plot, which then goes on to include further damaging materials from Sonia Bern's brothel, also of factual importance, but equally unnecessary in the film.

B000FVNX2Q|4.0|This calculator is a great update to the old HP 12C.  After reading the other reviews, I was concerned that the buttons might not have a good feel to them.  However, they definitely do give you positive tactile feedback so you'll know when you've actually entered your keystroke.  In my opinion, that makes up for the lack of the \\"screen flash\\" of the old HP 12C.  One thing I haven't seen mentioned on the screen flash issue is that, if you are entering a number, let's say for example 125, and have the number of decimal places set for more than one place [ie. you set the calculator to show X.XX], the screen flash may not make that much of a difference.  That's because after entering \\"125\\" and hitting ENTER, the display will add the two zeroes past the decimal place.  In other words, you'll still get a visual cue that the calculator has \\"registered\\" the number you have input, so the screen flash isn't that necessary.    I've owned three HP12C's and two 17B2's and I have to say, this ranks equal or better to those older models.  The processor is definitely faster, which could make a difference if you're pressed for time in taking one of the CFA exams, etc.  Ten extra seconds for each calculation can add up over a six hour test.    As for the red font for the \\"f\\" functions, it's easily legible and not significantly different in terms of legibility vs. the orange on the old HP12C.  It's not that big of a deal to me.  Construction-wise, the calculator feels identical to my old HP12C in quality except for the fact that the keys don't \\"rattle\\" like the old model, which wasn't a big deal to me anyway.    The only reason why I didn't rate the calculator 5 stars instead of 4 stars is because I did like the old screen flash feature.  But it's really splitting hairs.
B0015HS5TA|2.0|An engaging yet desperately generic feel-good dramedy, Miss Pettigrew Lives for a Day doesn't demonstrate any drastically unique ideas. At least, however, it also doesn't do anything overwhelmingly faulty. Probably accruing few harsh objurgations, the film will also likely encounter few words of enormous praise. Attempting to be old-fashioned and with impossibly ridiculous socialite drama, Miss Pettigrew Lives for a Day is not so much dissonant as it is simply without a unique tune.<br /><br />Promptly finding herself jobless, homeless and with only a single outfit to her name, Miss Guinevere Pettigrew (Frances McDormand) cunningly snags a business card that leads her to the home of Delysia Lafosse (Amy Adams). Posing as a social secretary, she begins to patch together the relationships of the promiscuous Delysia, while discovering a bit of romance herself. Set in London right before the start of World War II, Miss Pettigrew takes a chance and has a chaotic day as she is thrust into the dizzying world of high society milieu.<br /><br />The flirtatious Delysia is caught in a love polygon with the poor \\"Mr. Right\\", Michael (Lee Pace), the demanding and stern Nick (Mark Strong) and the Tom Jones party animal Phil (Tom Payne). \\"Men are so untrusting. I can't think why,\\" she casually mentions. Delysia is a whimsical and weak social climber who doesn't know what she wants, but craftily uses her innocent eyes and curvaceous figure to always stay in the high-class circle. Amy Adams is always delightful to watch in a role that mirrors the playful ignorance of her character in Disney's Enchanted, but her static immaturity only soaks up laughs at the beginning.<br /><br />Frances McDormand excellently portrays the relationship-doctor Pettigrew, a strong lead that we feel constantly makes the right decisions, even when they initially go astray. She's down-and-out and on the wrong side of luck, even though at the outset it appears that her inability to cope with her clients' quirks is purely her fault. First appearing disheveled and as \\"Oliver Twist's mom\\" as described by the fashionable Delysia, Guinevere undergoes quite a flattering transformation that allows her to momentarily fit in with her wealthy employer. But her good-natured and humble soul is not as easily disguised, drawing attention by the insincere conflict Edythe (Shirley Henderson) who is out to blackmail her, and the reasonable Joe (Ciaran Hinds from There Will Be Blood) who is attracted to her uncommon real-woman genuineness. \\"Love is not a game\\", she cries. Unfortunately in this film, it is.<br /><br />All of the characters in Miss Pettigrew Lives for a Day are about as unrealistic as the whimsical Giselle, the cheery role Amy Adams played in last year's Enchanted. It may be set during uncertain times, but each of the light-hearted characters dances about as if this were a gay musical. Miss Pettigrew herself is only partially grounded in reality, and even her offbeat success with romance is more than the average adult could bear. During the fluttery conclusion, everyone's true emotions come pouring out during a sad song, and this unlikely rehash of Amelie drops most of its charm. Even with the old-fashioned \\"The End\\" splashed onto the screen, Miss Pettigrew is anything but unpredictable.<br /><br />- Mike Massie.

1592402690|5.0|This book is great for a number of reasons. One: it gives a good insight into the inner workings of the Beatles in the studio, although that isn't new.  The second thing, and most remarkable, is that this is a first hand account of the man who produced the sounds that the Beatles wanted. He is in fact partly responsible for the Beatles' groundbreaking 'Tomorrow Never Knows' and other sound effects.  I became even more amazed by the Beatles as recording artists through this book.

Basically, no one should like such a film, yet it's still hard not to enjoy the sight of a herd of stampeding mammoths causing death and destruction.<br /><br />The year is 10,000 B.C., and a remote mountain tribe of mammoth-hunters is attacked by a marauding group of slavers who capture Evolet (Camilla Belle), the promised wife to unwilling leader D'Leh (Steven Strait). Desperate to retrieve his beloved Eve, D'Leh embarks on a perilous mission across treacherous mountains, predator-infested jungles, and burning deserts, that will find him uniting several warrior tribes to overthrow the tyrannical leader of a lost civilization.<br /><br />It's as clear as white rain that 10,000 B.C. isn't striving for any manner of authenticity in its portrayal of ancient anything. At best mimicking an Apocalypto in Egypt and at worst an inferior retelling of One Million Years B.C., Emmerich's film attempts to shadow what could have been in \\"300: The Bedtime Story,\\" but sacrifices any true power and intensity with sappiness and stereotypes. The decision to have the protagonist's tribe speak English may seem logical to entice the average moviegoer, but a careful examination isn't required to find several contradictory and unnecessary narrations. In an attempt to feign authenticity, much of the dialogue feels contrived and pointless. Lines like \\"just try it\\" as a contemptuous retort just don't belong in a pre-history epic.<br /><br />Another area that betrays the film's setting is the casting. Faces that are far too pretty and teeth that are way too white scream Hollywood, though this film isn't exactly meant to be a history lesson. All of the primary cast do the best with the dialogue they're given and Camilla Belle certainly looks like a prize worth chasing after, but don't expect the energy or thrills of something like Apocalypto.<br /><br />10,000 B.C. thrives on its CGI effects, and while not all it portrays is flawless or very realistic (as realistic as giant dodos and wooly mammoths can be anyway), what it attempts is still satisfyingly grand. Stampeding furry elephants, velociraptor-esque dodos and a not-so-mean saber-toothed tiger round out the brunt of the prehistoric creatures and much of their resulting action sequences do entertain. The most impressive special effects, however, belong to the long shots of gargantuan pyramids being constructed by thousands of scurrying people. When these massive monuments inevitably come crashing down, that's pretty thrilling too. Quite a bit of creativity (though probably not much authenticity) went into the unique and varied costumes that adorn each tribe of warriors, as well as the enslaving tyrants who recall their majestic and garishly dressed counterparts in the earlier ancient tale, 300.<br /><br />If you were excited by the trailer for 10,000 B.C., you'll probably go see it regardless of how many ill words we can throw at it, and maybe you shouldn't let a lack of story, character development, and realism stop you from enjoying a little mindless, guilty-pleasure, action-adventure fun. Well, maybe it should.<br /><br />- The Massie Twinsh chasing after, but don't expect the energy or thrills of something like Apocalypto.     10,000 B.C. thrives on its CGI effects, and while not all it portrays is flawless or very realistic (as realistic as giant dodos and wooly mammoths can be anyway), what it attempts is still satisfyingly grand.

0321544080|5.0|My honest opinion of JM's new book is fantastic reading with touches of techniques he uses.  I have read half the book and throughout my busy schedule I can't wait to get back to it and read more.   Understand that I am not saying that because there is some all new technique that Joe is teaching but the stories are interesting.  The tips are probably tips that experienced photographers have known for years.  You will not find apertures, shutter speeds and ISOs on every photo nor should you because images are dynamic( I say every because there were a couple I have seen where Joe does mention this type of informationas merely a guage).  This is not a how-to book and frankly there are enough of those out there anyway if we take the time to investigate and read them.  This is a fun read with some \\"how I approached this shot\\" theory and some really cool stories from a phenomenal commercial photographer.  The images are typical stunning Joe McNally photography with credits given to many that he has learned from in his years of work.  One story still makes me laugh when he talks about going from Spiderman to Wiley Coyote.  For a nice twist from your typical photography book with some extremely useful information this is a must buy for any photographer.  Maybe I should re-phrase that in saying that any photographer who has their own ideas to produce will find this book of great worth.  If you are just looking for step by step how to recreate the exact photo this book probably is not for you.  There are many other books out there that will give you that.  I really feel that JM was probably trying to put out a book that points you to the right doors in a room full of doors.  It is simply your job to take that direction and go through and create your own phenomenal work.  In that sense, I think Joe has far exceeded that mission.  In world of \\"I want my stuff to look like Dave Hill, Vincent Versace, Ansel Adams etc (obviously no offense to the amazing creativity by any of theseartists ... they are just artists that have such a profound look that you see the photo and you say ... that is a 'fill in the blank') Joe McNally has come out with a book that says create your own style but here's a little helping hand.  He gives you a glass of water without filling it up and says 'ok ... now you go fill it up with your imagination, creativity and style'.  Isn't that what we want to do with our photography?  I would love for someone to look at my work and recognize it as mine without seeing the name on the photo.  At that point, you truly have your own style and have arrived with your work.  Joe McNally, Vincent Versace, Ansel Adams, Jay Maisel, Henri Cartier-Bresson and many others all have that style.  Joe does help lead you to that style with this book.
0060899220|5.0|Kitchen Confidential was recommended to me by my son, who has worked in kitchens and now manages a restaurant and bar.  I work in a hotel that has a fine dining restaurant and a bar.  I began laughing at the beginning and, with a few breaks when Mr. Bourdain's serious side showed, didn't stop till the end.  The book is well written and, at the same time, totally nutsoid.  I loved it.  I highly recommend it.  I have read one of Mr. Bourdain's novels and plan to seek out other things he's written.  Bon Appetit!
B00111YM5G|4.0|I watched this last night and was very pleasantly surprised - especially given that I'd never heard of any of the actors before and that the entire movie was made on a $150,000 budget.    It was very [appropriately] dark in ways that reminded me of all that was best about The Crow, Underworld, Sin City, 300, Matrix, etc... and I loved the notion that when the Arcs took on human form, they had to contend with all the emotions and morality issues thereof.    The scene where Gabriel battles Asmodeus was especially riveting. I really liked how Gabriel appears to be borderline consumed rage and hate for this Fallen (note his eyes changing from angelic blue to the more demonic red / amber) but the appearance of the child and Gabriel's subsequent healing of the near comatose prostitute help bring him back to himself.    Very well done. Will definitely watch again and again.
0452289963|5.0|This is a fantastic book, beyond self-help, and upon the second read I find it has even more to offer. If you are searching for some peace in your life, but can't find it in your mind, work, and life, this is highly recommended. If you are grounded and have glimpsed moments of true joy and serenity in love, yoga, religion, or watching the sun set, you are ready. If you are struggling with any aspect of your life, you may find some new approaches here to deal with the repetition of your issues in your mind that cause strife and make you think your unhappy. Life is a process, but would you rather be the one on the freeway with road rage or the smiling Buddha? It is all about your perceptions. And who are you anyway? Do you really know? Tolle is today's philosopher, and I don't think this book will ever go away. I would put it a leap beyond \\"The power of positive thinking\\" because it defies time and does not define itself as centered from one set of religious beliefs, but instead shows us similarities. Go ahead. It's your turn to bloom.
B000JK8OYU|5.0|the Mirage was my primary motivation for visiting Vegas. There are always several Beatles tribute bands in Las Vegas at any given time but this is so much more. It is actually the Beatles. In a class by itself. Of course I made this cd my own as soon as it came out. But the performance absolutely explodes on you. Starting with a slower (it seemed) mix of Because. Then Ringo intros Get Back. No home systems can do it justice as dozens of performers descend on to the stage from the rafters high above. We had seats in the balcony & I think they were better than near the stage as trapeze artists flew within scant feet of us. The music seque wayed to that famous rooftop we all know. Strangly enough, it was being bombed in the blitz of World War II & Eleanor Rigby. Many bizarre happenings. But it's always about the music. The cd is fascinating with remixes & alternate takes. It is crisp & clean under George Martin's expert production. He above all seems to know them.      I was emotionally caught up (again) in my two personal favorites: George Harrison's Here Comes the Sun & John & Paul's masterwork Day in the Life. The music is not chronological nor are the versions the same as you may be use to. More the thrill. I know most can't go to Vegas to see the live performance but I can't recommend this cd enough. It is fab.

Well, this is the part.  The first time a Father /Son had ever won an Academy Award for the same film.<br /><br />John Huston wrote the screenplay based on[[ASIN:0837604362 The Treasure of the Sierra Madre]]  and directed his father, Walter Huston along with Humphrey Bogart, Tim Holt, and Bruce Bennett in this classic). Walter Huston won an academy award as Best Supporting Actor in 1948 and John Huston garnered Oscars for his direction and his screenplay.  I can't believe that Bogart won nothing, he did a great job, however.<br /><br />The film is best remembered for the lines:<br /><br />Badges, we ain't got no badges.  We don't need to show you no stinkin basdges.<br /><br />The movie had an earlier line that was key to the story.<br /><br />Gold doesn't have to be a curse.

B000U618C8|5.0|Swedish-born Latino Jos&eacute; Gonz&aacute;lez's 2007 album is not much of a departure from 2003's [[ASIN:B000ETRB9K Veneer]], which I reviewed a while back. I dare say there might be a few folks who bought \\"Veneer\\" and liked it enough but were hoping for something different this time round. They will be very disappointed.<br /><br />Personally, I'm totally loving this. To give him his due credit, he HAS tried something slightly different by bringing in Y. Nagano to do backing vocals, E. Boudin to play percussion and H. Wirenstrand to play synthesizer, when \\"Veneer\\" was pretty much a one-man show. I'm not sure it makes much difference to the overall sound though. All the songs are written by Gonz&aacute;lez except for his interpretation of \\"Teardrop\\", the Massive Attack classic, \\"Time to send someone away\\", which was co-written by Gonzalez and M. Bergqvist and \\"The nest\\", co-written by Gonzalez and Y. Nagano.<br /><br />This is what Gonz&aacute;lez does - clear, clean, Latin-influenced folk songs with just him and his solo classical guitar (for the most part) - and I think he does it well. But it might not be everyone's cup of tea, especially on two albums in a row (not to mention one EP). For me however, this kind of stuff hits the spot. Every time.
0740748475|5.0|Since I started reading Calvin & Hobbes over 10 years ago I've been longing to lay my hands on something like this. If I ever had any fear on getting disappointed it's completely vanished: this edition is by far the best I could have expected. The quality of the print is great, the colours are neat and there are no stains or badly printed areas. The format of the stripes is kept as they were originally published, there's even a foreword by the author. The design of the books is very good, despite the fact they are quite heavy and it's hard to find an appropriate shelf for them due to their size, when you open and you realise they're the right size to fit the stripes and full-page comics. In overall you can see the editors made an effort to give us a great quality product.   Regarding the contents, if you've ever read any Calvin & Hobbes you don't need me to describe them, and if you haven't I strongly recommend you to do so, they're a piece of art, simply the best comic you can find around.  The shipping and handling from Amazon were perfect, I received the package 5 days earlier than I expected, despite the fact that I ordered it from Europe and xhose the regular delivery it was quite fast. The packing was very good, I received the books in perfect condition.
B000002GYW|5.0|I have not read every review on this album, however the ones I have missed the fact that the Eagles are using the outlaw/western theme as a metaphor for being a rock musician.

0618918248|4.0|Laplace responded to Napolean's querry about positing God as an explanation for celestial mechanics by allegedly stating, \\"\\"Je n'avais pas besoin de cette hypoth&egrave;se-l&agrave;.\\" (Sire, I had no need of that hypothesis). Dawkins does much the same, except he has much more amunition than did Laplace.<br />For Dawkins the idea that God and evolution are compatible is riddiculous. Evolution by Natural Selection is the only force we know of which is capable of creating complexity from simplicity, by making slow, non-random steps.<br />The reason these steps are 'non-random' is not because they are guided by any intelligent being. It is, rather, because each step is mercilessly tested by nature itself. If any mutation confers a slight (very slight) adavantage on its possessor than that mutation will spread in the gene pool untill it has saturated the population. After millions of years and millions of mutations, we arrive at life forms that look like they were specifically designed for doing specific things. However, as Dawkins is at pains to show, this is an illusion.<br />On the way to complexity, most life forms are destroyed. They end in the trash heap. Or, if you will, on the cutting room floor. As J.B.S. Haldane quipped when asked about God, \\"he has an inordinate fondness for beatles.\\"<br /><br />Dawkins' point is one which needs to be absorbed by all: once we have knowledge of natural selection, postulating a God or Gods is redundant. We don't need them.<br /><br />It may be deflating and depressing to think that there is no inherent meaning in the universe, that we are alone, that life is but a blade of grass sandwiched within infinity; but this does not mean there is a God. I often wish Shakira loved me, but she doesn't. And that is just too bad. Unfortunately, when it comes to God, people often think that because they desire a God, there must be a God. Sheer rubbish.<br /><br />Dawkins uses many more arguments and has much more to say on this issue. All of it is written with his usual elegance, rhetorical fiery, and biting wit. He doesn't apologize for his beliefs, nor does he attempt to soften his blows with pillow gloves. This book is unlike many of the recent evolutionary attempts to explain religion in its bluntness and partisan nature.<br /><br />For those who wish to know why humans everywhere believe in ghosts, magic, witches, and gods, I would suggest Religon Explained by Pascal Boyer or In Gods We Trust by Scott Atran. For those who are sick and tired of the vapid logic and vacuous bloviating that spills from the mouth of the religious, Dawkins book is more appropriate.<br /><br />As an atheist of nine years, I doubt this book will change anybody's mind. This is too bad. Do not even open the cover of Dawkin's book unless you come in with an open mind and an honest desire to engage with science!cal fiery, and biting wit.

B000EGCITG|4.0|So with all that known, I'm gonna let you in on a few scores (at least two) including but not limited to:<br /><br />*those who have this version<br />*those who have the version I have (platinum)<br />and<br />*comments on where you should stand, and which to get if you don't have either<br /><br />Most of these songs are pretty good. Sadly, there is a few tracks (2-4) that are filler. And one of them is actually not bad.<br /><br />Long Way To Happy almost makes it. It's a song about being torn but being strong and continuing on. If you listen to it, it's not what the song says per se, it's what it doesn't.<br /><br />It seems like it was unfinished. So it's decent but not great. Dear Mr. President is heartfelt but for some reason I'm just not connecting with some of it. I don't know. It's sincere but it partially doesn't feel so.<br /><br />It's weird. I'm kinda torn about this album as a whole but it's mostly gold. Trust me. But I wanna get the filler out of the way!<br /><br />I'm Not Dead (the track) is cool production-wise but otherwise it doesn't go anywhere. I think it is there just to make the number of tracks bigger. It, like Long Way To Happy could have been left off the project completely.<br /><br />Fingers or Heartbreaker (2 Platinum and import editions exclusive-tracks) could have fit on instead of those both. Sure, Fingers is \\"explicit\\" even for an explicit album but it's nothing we've never heard of. What year are we in again??<br /><br />Lastly, I Have Seen The Rain is kinda cool. But not. Let's break it down:<br /><br />It's essentially another decent song. But for this studio album (or any of them) it just doesn't fit well at all. Bringing in her daddy was very, very sweet and surely, she enjoyed it like she said. But really, it doesn't fit with the album whatsoever. It sounds like it should be on some older rock album. None of Pink's. Trust me.<br /><br />Moving on. My favorite songs in order are:<br /><br />Nobody Knows - a relate-able ballad about loneliness and not being able to fix it alone. But not actually going on to tell others. Just keeping it to yourself until it tears you apart. Watch the video again! Sure, Pink looks too glamorous and it seems unbelieve-able but believe when I say this girl writes from the heart.<br /><br />Prettiness aside, you'll get the picture once you watch it (again).<br /><br />#1<br /><br />People say that this album is hypocritical. None of them lied. Pink bashes the president (Dear Mr. President) for not being true to us Americans, and calls out the attention-seeking celebs as well as \\"stupid, blond-acting girls\\" in Stupid Girls and then brags about how nice and big her rims are and how much money she has in Cuz I Can. Trust me when I say I wasn't the biggest fan of this song when I heard it but some of it made me not hate it. It was decent.<br /><br />Now, nearly a week later, after hearing it 4x or more, I love it. Yes, it's hypocritical but it's also very truthful. Take a gander!<br /><br />\\"So I'll cash my checks and place my bets/And hope I'll always win\\"<br /><br />\\"Even if I don't I'm F*&@ed because I live a life of sin\\"<br /><br />\\"But it's alright I don't give a damn/I don't play your rules I make my own\\"<br /><br />\\"Tonight...\\"<br /><br />OK. So she brags. And that's not the half of it! I just like the:<br /><br />\\"But it's alright I don't give a damn\\" line. The rest is showing off, but hey. She even admits that she's a very confusing and conflicting being, and it just shows in her music. Hypocrite you may spout, but real you can't say she isn't. This song is good, and a highlight, but not in my top 4 favorites. However, it was Pink's seventh single, released as a download in Australia-only.<br /><br />Moving on. Cuz I Can was pure-show, but I Got Money, even though she acts like she doesn't care about the situation she's in, she doesn't hide it easy. The tone of her voice and the repeated \\"or so it seems's\\" are a dead giveaway. She constantly says,<br /><br />\\"You don't have to like me I don't care/I got money now.\\"<br /><br />Call me a mind-reader or what have you, but she's not happy. She's being hella-sarcastic. People who don't see this are the ones that I worry for. Listen to the song. It's called I GOT MONEY NOW and you can tell. Her vocal delivery isn't pleasant and upbeat nor show-offy (if you listen to the tone) but rather kinda sad. When she tries to convince you otherwise towards the end where her voice gets stronger saying,<br /><br />\\"I don't need no love ... I have got enough!\\"<br /><br />Don't believe her.<br /><br />Just give it a listen. And another. Then it may make you sad. That's what happened to me!<br /><br />#2<br /><br />This song was very close to being number 4. It's a great song. I couldn't see that in 2006 because it just came off as kinda standard; boring. But now, I HEAR the actual lyrics more. And the ending is very emotional and I can see myself crying to it if I actually had a love, and then he went away. For good. There are the tears, rolling...<br /><br />The song is called Who Knew, and Pink looks kinda cool in it. I didn't see the beauty in this mid-tempo before. Kinda ignored it. But now I see. hahahaha<br /><br />#3<br /><br />The last song, which is easy to pick out of the 15 tracks that this album contains is...<br /><br />*<br /><br />*<br /><br />You guessed it! U + Ur Hand! I LOVE this song! I'm a huge pop fan anyway, and I consider Pinks music pop-rock ATM. It was pop-laced R&B initially, and then it went into pop-rockish territory, with some other (good) stuff thrown in, to make the eclectic M!ssunderztood.<br /><br />Try This, which I've heard only about 5 tracks from, is supposed to be her hardest album, rock-wise. I still call that pop-rock. Just like this one.<br /><br />But back to the song! It's what revived this album from being \\"underrated\\", \\"unseen\\" and \\"undiscovered\\". It didn't really hit me until winter 2008. I mean I saw it once before that and kind of ignored it. What a big mistake! Just like Who Knew but less personal I guess but 5x as catchy, it sizzled it's way up the charts and put Pink back in the limelight for a bit. It's lyrics are very women-empowering and it takes the more subtle approach.<br /><br />Especially when Pink says,<br /><br />\\"You can say what you want to your boy-friends\\"<br /><br />It's classic!<br /><br />#4<br /><br />------------------------<br />------------------------<br /><br />#1 Nobody Knows 11/10<br />#2 I Got Money Now 10.25/10<br />#3 Who Knew 10/10<br />#4 U + Ur Hand 10/10<br /><br />The album on a whole isn't a 5 but it's higher than a 4. Probably a tad higher. Filler brings it down.<br /><br />Cover Art: B-<br />Inside Art: A- (counting the back cover, this is pretty. There are 6 pictures of her and most of them are cool. My favorites are the black-winged devil picture, the one where sun rays are beaming on her from a window and the last picture that seems almost drawn into the booklet.)<br />Songwriting: B- (good topics, a bit of showing off, reflecting and some contradicting words only make it that more real for me.)<br />Vocals: B- (smoky vocal work with just a tinge of soul. hasn't really changed over the years and Pink smokes!)<br />Production: B<br />Length: A+<br /><br />Overall: 4.2 stars.<br /><br />End note: First owned Pink album, but not first heard. That was Can't Take Me Home which was nice but doesn't compare to this one.<br /><br />P.S. If you have this album, cool. But do you want the videos? I think it's worth selling this version of the album in order to get the Platinum edition like I have, instead.<br />Do you have the platinum edition? If yes, good for you!<br />If you want this album but now knowing that there's a platinum edition with a few more (excellent) songs, then you should go platinum. Otherwise, you must download or miss out on all the bonus tracks like U + Ur Hand (Bimbo Jones Remix), which is surprisingly better than the original, Fingers which isa seductive mid-tempo about Pink and the things she does when horny and up alone, ex-hubby sleeping, and Heartbreaker, another mid-tempo about her man loving her, but possibly not being sincere. Maybe he wasn't?<br />Lastly, Centerfold is on there, which isn't excellent but it's more than just decent and better than the filler that was mentioned.it. What a big mistake!

0810993139|5.0|I wanted to let everyone know that my 7yr old 2nd grader who loves the Captain Underpants series just LOVES this book! I checked it out from the Library just to see if he would even be interested. He loves to read comics and funny books and I thought why not try this and plus this would be his first novel. Well, I'm in the process of purchasing this book and the 2nd one for him. He read the whole thing in 1 day and wants a copy for himself to read over and over! He couldn't put it down and would run in and tell me all of the funny things that he read. I highly recommend this book. Thanks Jeff Kinney for an AWESOME book for kids. :0)
B000002I8D|5.0|This debut solo album of Phil Collins is definitely his best. The albums that would follow would not reach the skill of this one. Lots of great songs and just an all-around good album. Definitely recommended for Phil Collins' fans as well as Genesis fans.
B00004YX39|3.0|[[ASIN:B00003002C Aja]] was Steely Dan's most popular album but it marked a departure from their previous methods of working with a full-time studio band in favour of working exclusively with session musicians. Unfortunately, the move did not turn out perfectly because much of the music on [[ASIN:B00003002C Aja]] turned out too relaxed, overly \\"layered\\" and lighthearted, lacking the intensity that had marked such albums as [[ASIN:B00000DI0J Countdown To Ecstasy]] or [[ASIN:B00003002D The Royal Scam]].<br /><br />Three years and seven studios' work later, Becker and Fagen emerged at the tail end of 1980 with \\"Gaucho\\", which was their last album before drugs and depression caused them to disband for twenty years. With the music press of the day generally indifferent to pre-\\"punk revolution\\" stars, it is unsurprising \\"Gaucho\\" was coolly received even by those who previously adored Steely Dan. Many writers thought the band had lost the distinctiveness and power it had on its early albums and was moving far too close to bland pop music. Such songs as \\"Gaucho\\" itself, which tries far too hard to be humorous and \\"Third World Man\\" are quite emotionless and much too light for a band that once put out pieces like \\"Bodhissatva\\", \\"Do It Again\\", \\"Change of the Guard\\" or \\"The Royal Scam\\". The \\"Bodhissatva\\" sequel, \\"Time Out of Mind\\", with Dire Straits' Mark Knopfler guesting on guitar, has lyrics that impress in spite of being almost overtly religious (I admit I never saw that when I first listened) but the music, in spite of a clear, dense vocal from Fagen, could have sounded much better were the production crisper and more intense. The opener \\"Babylon Sisters\\", whose chorus should have rocked quite hard, suffers from the same problem and the song becomes less than exciting after years of listening.<br /><br />Nonetheless, \\"Gaucho\\" does contain two absolutely classic Steely Dan tracks that save it from being a waste of time. \\"Hey Nineteen\\" is pure funk with a wonderful lyric about the dreams of youth back in the late 1960s - and it has the same crispness and power the Dan produced time and time again on their first five albums. \\"Glamour Profession\\", a brilliantly-weaved tale of the underground criminal life of a professional basketballer, on the other hand uses the light production to create a psychedelic atmosphere that is truly hypnotic yet catchy. It is a pity the Dan were unable to replicate this sense of atmosphere more often on their last two albums before the breakup. When they try on the chorus of \\"My Rival\\", however, it shows how difficult creating one song like \\"Glamour Profession\\" actually is.<br /><br />All in all, despite two excellent songs, \\"Gaucho\\" is a rather disappointing farewell considering what the Dan did on their first five albums. Certainly buy these before checking out \\"Gaucho.\\"youth back in the late 1960s - and it has the same crispness and power the Dan produced time and time again on their first five albums. \\"Glamour Profession\\", a brilliantly-weaved tale of the underground criminal life of a professional basketballer, on the other hand uses the light production to create a psychedelic atmosphere that is truly hypnotic yet catchy.

B000GIXEIG|5.0|This movie was remade in the new CGI green screen technique just recently.But despite that this version is the best of them all, in my opinion.<br />Gerard Butler, famed for his roles in \\"300\\", \\"Dracula 2000\\", \\"The Phantom of the Opera\\"(where it's really him singing the lead role), \\"P.S. I love you\\" , to name just a few of the projects to his credit, brings the character of Beowulf to life.<br /><br />A poignant message film on so many levels it's worth every penny to add to your personal DVD collection. The scenery is magnificent, the actors very real in their portrayals, it's a superb film that you can watch again and again while seeing new things not only in the film but in the timeless message it contains; no matter how it looks we shall always suffer as people,  if we take our prejudices as a right to relate to one another just at face value.
6301955609|5.0|I saw Sante Sangre back in the early 90s in Tucson Arizona and walked out of the theater with my jaw dragging on the ground. The visuals of this film rival Fellini and the best visual artists. The depth of the material rivals the work of the worlds greatest symbolic psychologists, ala C. G. Jung. What this film is about is essentially the mental experiences of its main character, an insane circus performer who is traumatized by violence in his youth. He becomes a quietly obsesses serial killer who is possessed by his mother. Or so it seems. As with anything that is examining the unconscious impulses of a disturbed individual, nothing is clear or definite. Is he older now when the action takes place? Is he committed to an institution or free and wandering the world, killing his mother's enemies? Is he digging in a graveyard or just hallucinating it?<br /><br />The beauty of this film is in the not knowing but the wondering. Even though nothing is clear, the visuals are beautiful and it is clear how such powerful images are inspiring this character to take strong action.<br /><br />Most of my favorite films deal with archetypal images and universal symbols, so you might love this film if you like the work of Terry Gilliam, Thomas Harris (the Hannibal Lector series), Fellini, Salvidore Dali, and Carl Jung. You will enjoy this film. It is deep and wide and pushes you to expand your scope of mind.

B000I5X81K|5.0|Incredible. A word so often over used in todays society and yet that singular description speaks of Josh Groban's music. This album is perfect for long road trips. Ensconced in that new car, the world outside muted so that not even pot holes in the road interrupt the peace inside, this album is all one needs to while away the miles.<br /><br />What a blessing it is to find Josh Groban on CD.

B00104QSOM|5.0|[[ASIN:B00104QSOM There Will Be Blood (Two-Disc Special Collector's Edition)]]  Paul Thomas Andersen has created, or rather refurbished, an American classic. It revels in the dark side of business and spits the ugly sid of humanity in your face.

B00102FELM|1.0|I listened to all the reviews I read and let me tell you they are written by fanatics.  I love the Scorps.  The Scorps used to rock.

B000AARKW6|3.0|The thing that saves this film is the acting:  Pacino is a totally convincing criminal who wants to start over, yet faces seemingly insurmountable obstacles to his dream; Penn is amazing as a sleazy coke-head lawyer, who wants to be a \\"player\\".  Both of these fine actors act with their whole bodies, exuding their life trajectory with every gesture and expression.  Indeed, it may be one of Pacino's best performances. Nonetheless, like Scarface (which I thought was a ridiculous caricature, almost cartoon brutality), Carlito seems to walk into violent situations as easily as ordering a latte at Starbuck's.  Either the guy has a run of really bad luck, or it is a marvel that there are any punks left in NYC.  Then there is the beautiful true love, who returns to him in spite of his spate in prison, pregnant and about to leave with him, until...well, you can guess the formula.<br /><br />This is not a bad film, but with some more imagination it could have been far far better, in my opinion.

B000HEVZ6W|5.0|This is one of my favorite films...EVER.  The plot and premise are artistically crafted, the acting is superb - Ethan Hawke, Uma Thurman, Jude Law, Xander Berkley, Alan Arkin, Ernest Borgnine, Tony Shalhoub (it also has a rare and brilliant appearance by Gore Vidal in a significant role) and it is not overwhelmed with gratuitous special effects.  It is a piece of art, even the title and name of the facility is crafted to reflect the topic of the film, the letters in Gattaca comprise the letters of the proteins in DNA.  The messages in the film are nothing short of tremendous about the human will, turning our weaknesses into strengths, achieving our goals and the darker tendencies of society to categorize and box in our potential.  It is an emotional roller coaster you will never forget.  I can't recommend it highly enough.  If you liked the Shawshank Redemption, I thought this was a far better film.

0143038419|4.0|When I saw the number of reviews on this book, I went 'Holy Molly...', but decided to write a review anyway: P<br />First of all, to write a book like that, does take a huge amount of courage. So, for that above all, in my eyes, the author commands respect. I also liked her style, very intimate and definitely a friendly and humorous style which stays true to what she describes as her personality.<br />Aside from that, to me, the first and second parts of the book were the most gripping. I was in a state where I wanted to read fast and know, but at the same time, read slow and take her experiences in. So, I was hooked and for a bit, it made me do a bit of soul searching myself. So to that end, the book is fantastic.<br />However, by the time we get to the later section of her time in Indonesia, I felt it meandered a bit to my tastes. That she finds balance was clear even when she gets to Indonesia - the way she deals with the uncertainties with equanimity - so it did not add much value to the book  in my humble opinion. However, if you like rounded endings and care for a dash of romance, then of course it's great!<br />For anyone who values a sincere effort at soul searching, and find easy to empathize with others and have a never failing sense of humor, this book would be a great read.

B0000AUHPG|5.0|I'd never even heard of it before seeing it offered as a rental on Itunes movie selections a couple weeks ago. Came to Amazon to read the reviews first, and decided to buy it here when I read what everyone had to say. Count me among those who think it's the greatest western ever made, heck it's one of the greatest movies ever made. Previously I would have said either Unforgiven, or Silverado, or maybe Tombstone were the best westerns. They are great movies, but this one is in another class, all by itself. I'm in awe.
B0011FXLCC|5.0|When I first listened to this album, I was disappointed because I loved the last album so much and it's nothing like it. However, after about two listens, I was totally hooked. It takes a little bit of time to grow on you, but it's well worth it. This is such a beautiful, complex collection of music. Highly recommended.
B000OCXMAE|5.0|I have to confess that Hybrid Theory and Meteora are two albums I have worn out to the point that I can recite every lyric. Though I admit Linkin Park may not be the most original band to come around, I find that for well crafted, ear catching music, few modern bands do it better than LP. \\"Minutes To Midnight\\" came four years after \\"Meteora\\", and with it came several changes to the hit proven formula of \\"Hybrid Theory\\" and \\"Meteora\\", leaving a trail of mostly disappointed fans complaining about the \\"new\\" Linkin Park. However, looking beyond the deeper subject matter, and the lack of Mike Shinoda raps, \\"Minutes\\" is still very much a Linkin Park album.     As I mentioned, the main alteration of \\"Minutes\\" comes in the diluting of the rapping portion of the rap/rock infusion the band became known for, also known as \\"Nu Metal.\\" Though I admit that at first I was somewhat let down at first by the lack of Nu Metal songs present on the album, it didn't take long for me to realize that Minutes is every bit as ear catching and re-playable as either of their first two albums. From the hand clapping, angst ridden, scream-along \\"Given Up\\", to the perfect melody driven pop rock of \\"Shadow of the Day\\", to the straight up Nu Metal of \\"Bleed It Out\\", nearly all of \\"Minutes\\" tracks deliver on some level. Linkin Park is simply experimenting here with different genres, instead of sticking solely to their Nu Metal roots. The very Metallica-ish \\"No more Sorrow\\" for example, is quite the head banger, while the somber \\"Valentine's Day\\" finds LP embracing their emo side. Another genre shift comes in a personal favorite of mine, \\"In Pieces\\" which finds lead singer Chester Bennington addressing his divorce to a building synth beat that makes for arguably their most simply enjoyable song to date. The other biggest change in the band comes in their deeper, political driven lyrics. Tracks like \\"Hands Held High\\" and \\"The Little Things Give You Away\\" make you fully aware of the band's stance on current political issues, to varying degrees of success. While I'm not quite convinced of the band's lyrical skills yet, points at least have to be given to them for branching out from their typical subject matter.     Overall \\"Minutes To Midnight\\" is everything I expected from Linkin Park. I'm glad they changed, since no band can survive without that, and I think that if most fans give the album a fair shot, they'll see that there's not much of a difference in the \\"new\\" LP compared to the old one. The album's not perfect as the changes don't always work (as evidenced most by the blah track \\"In Between\\" where Shinoda takes over the singing), but in the end, Minutes is a very suitable entry in the band's catalog. 5/5 stars    My Top 5:  1. In Pieces  2. What I've Done  3. Given Up  4. No More Sorrow  5. Shadow of the Day
0671891634|5.0|This book is old school, but boy is it a classic. I've always been fascinated with stocks and the stock market but in the late 90s, past the apex of the day trading craze, I decided to set a small amount of money to partake in some of the action. I set up my account, started watching CNBC like a nut, and dove right in. Before doing so, I used Mr. Lynch's book as my guide and the biggest thing I learned is to stay grounded and avoid the mania and manic depression of the market. This book is not for slick, know-it-alls with pretensions of timing the market and making fast money, Vegas style. No, this book is for sober grown-ups who are willing to  take a longer and more rational approach.    I think the best lesson the book offers is to stick to investing in companies you know and trust (and buy from). By following that simple advice I've been able to earn very handsome gains. In addition, the primer on how to read a balance sheet is easily worth the price of admission. There's just lots of great information presented that will make you a relatively savvy investor. This book demystifies a lot of the perceived complexity  of the market and shows ordinary people how to get in on the action. It's sober and timeless advice you can use even today.
B00000DOY9|5.0|Led Zeppelin. Their music is simply amazing, and their masterful sound simply cannot be duplicated. They have been called the greatest rock band of all-time, and who could argue?    Their 1978 record 'Presence' is very underrated. If you enjoyed 'Physical Graffiti,' 'Houses of the Holy,' and 'In Through The Out Door,' chances are you'll love this one. While my favorite Zeppelin record is probably 'Led Zeppelin II,' this is definitely one of my favorites.    I absolutely love 'Achilles Last Stand.' It's a legendary song that should have gotten radio airplay. I probably prefer this over 'Kashmir.' Other highlights are 'Royal Orleans,' and 'Tea For One.'    This is highly recommended for any Zeppelin fan. ENJOY!!!
0143038419|2.0|I only give this book two stars because I did enjoy the first \\"book\\" and that's why I give this two stars instead of one. However, the whining of the author gets annoying and it's also the same stuff repeated over and over throughout the book. Elizabeth Gilbert comes across as very shallow and self-absored throughout the book. I just had a very difficult time seeing her point of view as far as how horrible her life was because she didn't know what she wanted from it. This book did not live up to the reviews written and the hype around it.
0783225547|4.0|1997 delivered two volcano movies, \\"Dante's Peak\\" and \\"Volcano.\\" The latter film stars Tommy Lee Jones and takes place in Los Angeles. Volcanic activity in Los Angeles? They might as well have had the story take place in Ohio! Needless to say, the idea never tripped my trigger. \\"Dante's Peak,\\" however, has piqued my interest over the years. I've seen a couple clips of the film while channel surfing and each time I was drawn into the storyline. One clip I saw showed a skinny dipping couple in a hot spring suddenly get boiled to death because of the volcanic activity of the mountain. Another clip showed a handful of people trying to escape the volcano in a boat on a lake. The lake had become acidic because of the volcanic pangs of the mountain and all the fish were dead and the propeller on the boat melted away. These scenes convinced me that the film was worth catching some day.<br /><br />THE PLOT: A scenic Washington town at the foot of a mountain is celebrating being nominated one of America's best small towns. Meanwhile a scientist from the U.S. Geological Survey (Pierce Brosnan) sniffs around the massive peak and becomes convinced the Volcano is going to blow at any minute. The rest of the scientific team comes to town to investigate while Brosnan develops a relationship with the mayor (Linda Hamilton). Brosnan wants to put the town on immediate alert while the boss vulcanologist doesn't want to jump to conclusions and disrupt the town's economic interests. The volcano blows, of course.<br /><br />As you can see, the plot rips off \\"Jaws,\\" trading a Volcano for the shark, but it's effective. The thing about \\"Dante's Peak\\" is that IT'S BASED ON REAL-LIFE EVENTS. On May 18, 1980, Mt. St. Helens in Washington blew her top. Although there was no decent sized town nearby, 57 people were killed and 250 homes, 47 bridges, 185 miles of highway, 15 miles of railway and hundreds of miles of forestry were obliterated. The eruption caused a massive debris avalanche, reducing the elevation of the mountain's summit from 9,677 feet to 8,365 feet and replacing it with a mile-wide horseshoe-shaped crater. Mt. St. Helens is even mentioned in the picture a few times.<br /><br />WHAT WORKS: The cast is likable even though they do dumb things or react in a stupid fashion, e.g. the grandma who insists on staying on her mountain because it would never harm her (aduh). I always thought Brosnan was too dour as James Bond, but he's more likable and human here, albeit still serious. Anyway, I like the way the film takes its time to let us get to know the characters before disaster strikes. This works because, in the meantime, anticipation of the eruption slowly builds.<br /><br />I've read quite a few of the Amazon reviews and was surprised that no one had commented on the scenic locations. The town scenes were filmed in Wallace, Idaho. This quaint village sits at the foot of a big hill (we'd call it a mountain in the East), which was digitally enhanced to appear as a volcano in the film. I tell you what, they fooled me 'cause it sure looks like a real volcano. Anyway, the shots on the mountain and in the crater were filmed at none other than Mt. St. Helens, Washington (my brother incidentally lives a mere 50 miles north of there in Yelm but has mysteriously never climbed the volcano -- WIMP!).<br /><br />The F/X are outstanding. They used both miniatures and CGI. The volcano doesn't fully erupt until the last half hour of the film's 1 hour and 50 minutes runtime.<br /><br />WHAT DOESN'T WORK: Some of the dialogue and acting is lame here and there and I find the idea of a truck driving through lava to be unbelievable -- it sure took a long time for the tires to blow -- but, then again, I don't really know how long thick truck tires would last under those conditions. Lastly, they could've done better with the women (e.g. the hot spring girl, etc.), although Linda's always likable.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE: Want to see what it might have been like to benear Mt. St. Helens when she blew her top? \\"Dante's Peak\\" is the next best thing to being there. It's one of the better disaster flicks.<br /><br />GRADE: B+near Mt. St. Helens when she blew her top? \\"Dante's Peak\\" is the next best thing to being there. It's one of the better disaster flicks.<br /><br />GRADE: B+

B000002UB3|5.0|The Beatles, in my opinion, were one of those groups who got better as they got older. Sure, they will always be remembered for their 1964 appearance on 'The Ed Sullivan Show' that made them famous, but to me, the early Beatles can't hold a candle to the late-'60s Beatles.    1969's legendary 'Abbey Road' is proof.    As soon as you here the opening keyboard line on 'Come Together,' you know this is going to be an album worth listening to. 'Something,' 'Maxwell's Silver Hammer,' and 'Golden Slumbers' all shine here. And who could forget George Harrison's legendary 'Here Comes The Sun'?    The Beatles are a group that I think should be listened to by albums. Yes, there are some great Beatles best-ofs out there, most notably '1962-1966' and '1967-1970,' but the studio albums are much better.    At this point, The Beatles musically weren't the same band that performed 'She Loves You' and 'Love Me Do.' This record actually has some progressive background to it; the heavier drums by Ringo Starr and the ripping keyboards by Lennon and McCartney make this a must listen.    Highly recommended for any Beatles or rock and roll fan. A masterpiece. ENJOY!!!
B000002L99|5.0|After \\"Diamond\\" Dave left Van Halen in 1985, or got fired, depending on who you believe, the world was left to wonder if the mighty Van Halen could sustain itself any longer. Coming off their most commercially successful album to date Van Halen rolled the dice and hit payday with solo artist Sammy Hagar.<br /><br />Much like its predecessor, Eddie absolutely drenched \\"5150\\" with keyboards and butt-kicking guitar riffs. Sammy proves to be a more than worthy replacement for Dave on this record, and in most Van Hagar fans eyes, this is their best work together. I myself love the album, but \\"Balance\\" and its heavy guitar sound takes my top spot for Sammy era Van Halen. I'd name the best tracks from the album, but that would simply be the whole thing. The album is just one of the best of the entire genre.<br /><br />I can guarantee that no Van Halen fan would disagree that this is one of their best releases to date. whether you're a fan of Dave or Sammy, \\"5150\\" is simply one of this awesome bands best works.

B00005JPXY|4.0|It's suspenseful. It kept my eyes glued to the screen from the beginning till the end. The special effects of the monster are spectacular. Yes, the filming technique that uses hand-held camera did cause me a little discomfort to watch in some scenes.  However it's also makes this film stands out from others in the same genre.     If you want something different, suspenseful and highly entertaining, this is for you. It's certainly worth watching.
B000MX7V5M|5.0|One of Hitchcock's finest. Far better than soggy stuff like Vertigo, or twittering drivel like The Birds. Irreplaceable Grace Grant and Cary Kelly, saturated with ineffable style and charisma. Beautiful, poised, elegant, brittle, delectable beyond compare, with a sly, sparkling, witty script, concealing an intriguing sub-text. Exclusively for sophisticates, of course. The plot, as usual with Hitch, whose plots are never plausible, is only a veneer, coating deeper, subterranean meanings. Set a thief to catch a thief: but who is catching who, here? Catch as catch can.
B000002MUQ|5.0|Released in 1995, \\"Balance\\" was Van Halen's tenth studio record, and last album with Sammy Hagar. Like most bands of their heyday, Van Halen had to adapt or die to stay relevant in the mid-90's. While in no way a grunge record, \\"Balance\\" does show a shift in direction for Van Halen.<br /><br />Darker, heavier, and moodier than previous efforts, \\"Balance\\" definitely borrows from the alt-rock mood of the mid-90's, while never completely selling out. This album is my favorite record with Sammy, and I also feel this has some of his best writing on this album as well. In my opinion the heavier sound of the record is what makes this effort shine. I love the hard rocking sounds of \\"Don't Tell Me,\\" \\"Take Me Back,\\" and \\"Aftershock,\\" and the ballads like \\"Can't Stop Lovin' You\\" and \\"Not Enough\\" add some needed emotion to the release as well.<br /><br />All personal feelings aside, this is an awesome album, and it's my favorite Van Halen record with Sammy Hagar. I highly recommend it to all fans of Van Halen and hard rock alike.
B000YY67B8|5.0|i purchased the new shm cd. already out of print. it looks like a regular cd. so dont be suprised if you think you got ripped off like i did. the plastic on the play side makes the mix better than ever. more separation of voice and instruments so you can hear clearly the sound. the songs are not in order as the 97 remasters are. i was waiting for track 2 to hear hey joe and it was'nt there until the last few songs at the end of the cd. it is worth getting and i vote it #1.

B00005LC1H|5.0|Anybody that likes comedy and television has to have Fawlty Towers-The Complete Series.  Like all fans of the show I only wish they made more episodes. But this collection is great.  I've turned my kids onto the show and we all have had many \\"laugh out loud\\" moments.
B0013FBS20|5.0|Eventhough it is scary at some parts, as a whole I found the film \\"great\\".  Great Acting by Will Smith & Alice braga.Thanks to this movie I'm more fond of Bob Marley. I can't wait to watch the IMAX version of the film. The movie is a good example of the Human Spirit.
1593082649|3.0|I generally love both Jane Austen's work and the foot & end notes accompanying it that give a more thorough sense of the culture, but this time the notes completely ruined the story for me!<br /><br />At first I thought perhaps I was enjoying Northanger Abbey less than Austen's other works because it was her first, and therefore less practiced and perfected, novel.  But towards the end of the book I realized that it's main flaws are not of Austen's doing.<br /><br />Every morsel that Austen holds back, every secret she hints at to draw the reader along with her main character is dashed to pieces by the explanatory notes!  No wonder I didn't think it very good - before I'd read a third of the introduction (and there I stopped), I knew what trials would befall Catherine, what motives the antagonists operated under, and who the heroine would marry in the end!<br /><br />Of course her first work is not as heralded as Pride & Prejudice, but it is still worth the time of an Austen fan.  If you are capable, ignore every memo in this book until after you're done.  If you're incapable, I recommend you find another version so that you may enjoy Austen's first novel for what it is, without anyone spoiling it for you!<br /><br />A.L.

1881273156|5.0|Have you ever given someone a gift and they didn't react as positively as you thought they would? It could be, according to Dr. Gary Chapman, that you are not speaking their language. You might have better connected with them by giving them a hug or telling them that you love them. This very enlightening book provides a framework with which to look at your current relationships and see what those around you need to feel your love.     To help become more aware of how we show and receive love, I highly recommend [[ASIN:1888043148 How To Create a Magical Relationship]] and [[ASIN:1888043180 Being Here: Modern Day Tales of Enlightenment]] by Ariel and Shya Kane. These authors show that by truly listening to those around us we can experience instantaneous transformation in our relationships and our lives.

3822817015|5.0|If you like this genre of art, this is a good reference with a wide spectrum of artists and good quality pictures. Nothing obscene, but a bit of titillating work consistent with the style. Good background summaries. Not an all inclusive or exhaustive reference by any means. If you want a lot of a specific artist then you need a book on that artist alone as there is too much out there for one book. This one makes a good coffee table book and is good for art/ fashion inspiration.

0143143492|2.0|While Mr. Tolle makes quite a few intriguing and interesting points in \\"A New Earth,\\" one has to wonder why in the world he chose to read the book himself for audio.  He is a horrible reader with an extremely dry, monotone delivery. Ego is the only reason I can think of for him being his own reader.  Ironically, the sole purpose of this book is to help the reader/listener to overcome the ego and achieve a more conscious and aware Present.  I think Tolle has some severe ego problems.
0385338724|5.0|LOVED the book - except I kept feeling like I was reading the sides of an episode of \\"Samantha Who?\\", which was strikingly similar to a lot of the plots in this book. The only thing that REALLLLy bugged me was the explicit sex scenes. Kinsella has managed to \\"allude\\" to a lot of the intimate scenes in previous books, but here she went so all out, it made me squirm. I don't typically read such graphic novels.    it was still very very funny. Five stars.
0679809015|5.0|I have two twin granddaughters- they are 19 months old now.  We have read them this book so often that we are now on the 2nd copy and they still love the book.  It's highly recommended.  I agree it's not very large, but it has worked well for us.
0307237702|5.0|This book provides a great overview of modern American politics. Obama shows why he is the man to beat in the 2008 election. He is intelligent and yet compassionate, a quality we need as a leader of the nation. (George W. lacked the intelligent part)    Obama offered clear logic of why we need to provide a safety net to the people. The Conservatives have no answer to that. This is a type of book that Abe Lincoln would have wrote had he lived today. Any one with a thinking brain should read this book.
0307165485|5.0|I'm very glad to see this back in print, but there are at least a couple of changes between this and the 70's version. First and foremost, the story of Pierre Bear has been replaced with \\"Good Night Little Bear.\\" I strongly suspect that it was to 'modernize and politically correct' the book. But, I do think that Good Night Little Bear is a better story all round, so no real complaints.<br />Also, some of the stories and nursery rhymes are a bit abbreviated. E.g. the kittens and the mittens, and for reasons I can not figure out, the illustrations are about 10% smaller than in the Best Nursery Rhyme book.<br /><br />Also, for the I am a Bunny book, I certainly think it's worth getting the  book itself. The unique format makes it really stand out, and the pictures fill the pages entirely, with no distracting empty space.
B000H6SXMY|5.0|I got this product for my girlfriend, she loved it, everything came on time and in order so I was very pleased
B00027JZ3E|4.0|This Joel Schumacher helmed flick is a tasty 80's treat, complete with a just-starting-out Kiefer Sutherland, Coreys Haim and Feldman, and did I mention Tina Turner's buff sax player?<br /><br />It is the story of 2 teens who move in with their grandfather after their mother's divorce from their father.  They soon discover that the denizens of their new beachy California hometown can be even more \\"eccentric\\" then they imagined, and, as the older of the two brothers learns the hard way, be VERY careful when someone you just met offers you a wine bottle; you have no idea what kind of liquid you might really be drinking.<br /><br />The is a totally 80's take on varmpires, with hot guys, gorgeous costumes for the vamps, great music, and make-up FX by Oscar-winners-to-be Greg Cannom and Ve Neil.  The two-disk is a perfect treat for any child of the 80's, with a retrospective featuring director, producer, both coreys, and Jamison Newlander (AKA the Other Frog Brother).  Perfect for an 80's themed Halloween night or at any other time of the year you feel like it.  Recommended.  Cheers.
B00003CXHJ|5.0|My wife and I have built a really nice McIntosh theater system that can put you IN a film. We greatly appreciate audio scores and this one is special. A fantastic DTS track. God Bless the engineers who spend long hours in the studio providing sound like this. This is a great story with above average acting. Even the ponderous Bill Paxton turns in an OK and thankfully brief performance. The real star of this flick is the sound. When the depth charges go off, especially in multiples, you are exposed to the terror these guys endured on both sides. And to think I picked this up in the $5.00 bin at wally world. Run Silent Run Deep it ain't. Enjoy.
0060922583|4.0|This book begins with a very interesting development in Physics. Then, it slowly drifts away to various real life examples exaplained using this new theory. Mid way thru' it, you will feel bored with pages of similar examples.    This will certainly put you in different perspective for the universe and various phenomena. So, 4 star...
B0011ZNAIC|5.0|Saw this one in the theater, a cute little movie, suitable for all ages.  Done in cartoon-ish pixar format, it is a cute little story about how bees contribute to the world being a better place.  Jerry Seinfeld is the voice of the Barry Bee and is great, very natural down-to-earth sounding, yet funny.  Barry Bee graduates from school and has to choose what bee job he wants to do for the rest of his life.  He decides he wants to do something really special, so he reaches for the moon, so to speak.  A nice message about how you can strive to be what you want to be and succeed.
0375846735|4.0|This is a good book and a good trilogy. The people that are saying these are anti Christian are being ridiculous. It's just a book. If you don't like to read about other's ideas, DON'T READ BOOKS. If a book can change your beliefs, you are WAY to easily manipulated.
0634022296|1.0|I bought the book assuming it would be more useful than it is. I am looking to buy a different and better one now; because, the finger-placement chords are written at the top of the page and not found within the songs ...thus it is hard to follow. The songs in the book are also without sheet music; and, only the names of the chords are above the words. The other reviews are incomprehensible to a non-musician. This is a glorified \\"fake-book,\\" and should be promoted as one. F-
B00009W0U4|3.0|I first heard about this film from a friend of mine who has worked in the film industry.  His review was simply one word: \\"disturbing.\\"  My interest piqued, I researched the film online, eventually landing here on Amazon.  I was amazed by the myriad reactions, both positive and negative... I felt I had to see this movie for myself.  Having seen it, I am left without words to describe it...<br /><br />I suggest to anyone interested that you read these reviews.  I agree with just about every single person's viewpoint of this film, from the praise of the filmmaking and acting to the horror and disgust over the intense violence and seediness.  The bottom line is this: I saw it, and I'm neither glad nor regretful that I did.  But my advice is that you rent or borrow this film, not purchase it.  My copy will remain on my shelf without being viewed a second time.<br /><br />My friend was correct.  It is truly disturbing.
0525950079|4.0|This book did not get my 5 star rating because Pillars of the Earth, this books predecessor, standard wasn't met.<br /><br />What Ken Follett did well, was make the events in this book historically accurate. The 100 years wars is being waged in this time frame, and the events of the wars are as Medieval historians think occurred at the time. The plague, with the death rate, how to treat and measures taken are also very accurate to the time period. How hearsay was tried and measures taken to advert were also historically accurate. It was not uncommon for people to join the church in order to attempt to thwart the impending death that this type of charge would bring. This makes the book just that much more believable. It's very easy to believe that the story line of all of the characters could happen, and thus make it alive in one's imagination, if the historical facts are correct according to historians.<br /><br />What Ken Follett didn't do well was leave more open ends and didn't get as detailed into the characters as I would have liked. In Pillars of the earth, Ken spent a lot of time (and pages of the book) building his characters around the events of the book, including the \\"Mysterious\\" bits in the beginning that aren't solved until the end.  In this book, he seems to take the characters up to about 75% and then leaves open ends. He spends less time building the characters via their thought process and what's going on in their head versus what they're doing. It leaves me feeling unfulfilled.<br /><br />This book is still well worth reading. Just keep in mind that if you're wildly thrilled with and loved \\"Pillars of the Earth\\", it's just not going to be as good.
B0000X61UU|5.0|This is a straight forward strength workout that will get your heart rate up and inspire you at the same time.  the prodcution values are sky high and Cindy Crawford is always such an inspiration to me!!!  There is an awesome thigh shaking sequence for the butt, and thighs, and hips. There is great chest work as well and I am definitely seeing the difference in the support of my muscles in my upper back and chest. i feel I am standing more like a model!  This has been a staple for quite some time and I can't imagine ever putting it aside.
0385338724|5.0|Sophie Kinsella is my favorite for chick-lit. Her books are always light-hearted and fun! And its no different this time. I ran out to get this as soon as I discovered it and read it in 2 days. Highly entertaining as usual. Loved it!
B000MRAAJM|5.0|Folks, let me sum it up right off the top - if you own a HDTV, a Blu-Ray player, and have a surround sound setup of any caliber, you must own these discs. I was not all that interested in nature or documentaries but I picked these discs up because I kept hearing about them. Once I began watching it, I was simply stunned and completely gripped by it. I find myself missing some of the narrator's dialogue because I am staring at the the amazing detailed picture and focusing on the glorious sound. These discs will show you just how good your equipment can perform, how Blu-Ray can shine. It is something to experience, that's for sure.
1401322336|5.0|I have all Jamie Oliver's books and believe all to be just what they are meant to be; fun with cooking and an educational experience.  I've tried a few of the dishes and love all of them.  The things he talks about are not complicated but some of the stuff he includes in the recipes can be difficult to find in an American grocery store.  Not too many of us have a good butcher in the neighborhood not to mention a fishmonger.  That aside, Jamie Oliver loves cooking, loves teaching novices how to cook and is a top notch person.  I've spent five years in England (during his introduction on the Food Newtwork) and seen his work with Fifteen and Jamie's Kitchen.  I wish we had more celebreties in the US who demonstrated such a Philanthropic nature and less need about getting into tabloids.  He uses his celebrity for good not for gain.  For that I will buy his books, eat in his resturants and speak good things about him.  Doesn't hurt that he's a damn fine chef, too.
1400082773|3.0|Alot of memoirs to read lately including Jimmy Carter and others of that type are so hard to read through. They simply are not entertaining.  Barack writes stories and statements that will provoke thought.  Some of his conclusions are a little off tilt.
0385338724|4.0|While not the most memorable book I've ever read, Sophie Kinsella nevertheless manages to engage and captivate me through most of Remember Me?. Lexi Smart is suffering from amnesia. She thinks it is 2004 when in reality, it is 2007, and what a 2007 it is!<br /><br />Lexi is married, she is a power-hungry, ambitious boss at the company she works for, and she seems to have lost all the things that used to make her Lexi Smart. As Lexi tries to understand her new life, tries to find joy with her husband, she is starting to realize that what she wants to remember most, is who she really is.<br /><br />Kinsella always manages to tug at my heart strings, and Remember Me? does it once again. While the amnesiac storyline has been played out in hundreds of fiction titles, and while the author does not really bring anything truly new and creative to this story, this does not matter all that much because Lexi is a character you will come to care about. There is heart and vibrancy in her characterization and that makes her struggle come alive on the pages.<br /><br />While some of the events in the story seem a tad silly, Remember Me? moves past them and lets readers truly get to know Lexi. She is an interesting character and she, more than anything, makes this story memorable and worth reading.<br /><br />I can always count on Sophie Kinsella for a hearty laugh and a slightly implausible but nevertheless satisfying story. Remember Me? fits that formula successfully. I think you'll go away with a smile on your face after reading this story. I did at least, and that is the mark of enjoyable storytelling more than anything else.
B000J4QWMC|3.0|The film's lines are well written.  The cinematography is excellent and some of Michael Mann's best. The storyline, however, especially in the first 45 minutes is extremely slow and almost unbearable as you wait for something, anything to happen.  Therefore I take off one star.  The actors do an excellent job.  All of them do.  There are a few scenes of gratuitous nudity, which I take off one star for.

080726203X|5.0|I was really surprised by how deep this book goes. This is another book I bought for my 6th grade guys who need the audio of the book to help them gain the comprehension of the story. I listened to it from my house to school (20 minute drive) and I didn't ever want to get out of my car!! The themes in this story are really moral and deep, kind of a bit much for younger students. This would be a good book for an older more experienced reader, even though the reading level is somewhat low, the tones and the morals in it are somewhat out there for the reading level. It will make you think.
