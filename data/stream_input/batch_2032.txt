B0052UYJDC|5.0|I've always been drawn to living simply and consider myself quite a practical person.  I loved reading this book and actually found it very inspiring! I love all the quotes Francine uses from famous philosophers.  Since reading this book, I've gotten rid of about half my shoes and a lot of my clothes that I didn't wear.  I also cleaned out my bathroom drawers and cabinets.  I'm still decluttering and do a little bit each day.  I also have completely stopped shopping and &#34;window shopping&#34; and have saved up quite a bit of money this way.  She's a great writer with a good sense of humor and I find her way of living extremely inspiring.  I hope to be live more like Francine Jay does some day!
B0013D6LEM|5.0|Michael's best album, ever. This is a must have for any Michael Jackson fan or any fan of modern popular music.
B008TMA1LY|1.0|The game is fun for a while. I had purchased more coins twice. First time I spent $0.99 and got what I paid for then I paidfor $9.99 for more coins which I never received. I tried emailing the developer about it several times with no response. After explaining the situation to Amazon they were nice enough to give me a refund. I wouldnt recommend this game.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|I enjoyed this book immensely. If you enjoyed &#34;Miss Peregrine's Home for Unusual Children&#34; this is right up your alley.

B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book was awesome. I really liked the chemistry between Holder and Sky and overall the way it was written. I couldnt help and cry and cheer on the characters while they were going to thru difficult issues.
B005CRQ2DK|5.0|It was a really good books, easy to read and I liked the story. I would recommend this book to other kids
B0043ZDU1E|2.0|sorry wish I could say it was not, but I had to work hard to repair it before I could enjoy it.
B00470TOV0|5.0|This is a GREAT movie, I highly recommend it. Definitely in my top 5. Every time I catch it on cable I have to watch it. This movie does have a lot of violence, but not just for the sake of having it. It's integral to the story, and drives the emotional impact.
B008MAI0WK|5.0|Meeting Pi is like meeting an old good friend.  It reminds me of my youthful enthusiasm when I was experimentimg with Z80 microprocessor as a hobbyist more than three decades ago with ROM writer, UV lamp ROM eraser, stepper motor...remember?  Now my retirement age is nearing after busy working life I met this little treasure.  I am now looking forward to retirement.  This book was written by the designer of Pi, and gives you a good start.  Thank you Eben
B008KYOCA2|1.0|I thought this was going to be a great calendar with all of the categorizing and colors it offers but, when I try to input events it doesn't add them to my calendar. After numerous tries I deleted it and am now using the standard basic calendar that is already pre-programmed on the kindle fire-HD
B0063IH60K|5.0|So addictive and fun to play. This game is handy for that minute when I am waiting in line somewhere!
B00B2V66VS|4.0|I love the game but it has A glitch where it closes the app. Don't use head starts unless needed cookbook<br />(Don't mind cookbook)
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|this mindless game helps me to relieve mental stress (i don't have 11 more words to add to my rating)
B00992CF6W|5.0|Is a good app but has bug where It deletes you're worlds name  other then that awesome oh armor is in the next update
B00AUA67GQ|4.0|Very clear and fun to write notes in, I like that you could save the notes as well and share them too.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Good story but a bit to graphic and lovey dovey. The entire idea is great, can't wait to read the others.
0385336950|4.0|I ordered this book thinking that it was Cloud Atlas (the one that is coming out with Tom Banks). I started to read it after i finished  the other and so far it's a pretty good book.
B001OQCV6K|3.0|Guy Ritchie brings his macho stylings and elaborate machinations (but not the inventively clever and profane dialogue) to the classic superhero detective.  Always known for his aloof attentiveness to minutiae, now Sherlock Holmes is also a skilled fighter, capable of putting his keen inferential skills to the task of incapacitating his opponents in hand-to-hand combat.  Watson has also been upgraded, more in keeping with the books than with film and television depictions, to something much more than an assistant and sidekick - in spite of his reluctance and longing for domestic tranquillity, he's a serious fighter, like Holmes, and achieves with effort the insights that Holmes intuits.<br /><br />It's a classic mismatched buddy formula, that should be familiar from the [[ASIN:B001PKHS5O Odd Couple]] to [[ASIN:B0019GO58W Ferris Bueller's Day Off]] to [[ASIN:0790729695 Lethal Weapon]], only this time the fate of the world is at stake as an evil supervillian sets his sights on world domination.  The film throughout is a visceral thrill ride, that punches you in the gut but keeps the brain ticking (even if everything gets explained every several minutes in case you weren't paying attention).  In the end it all amounts to not much more than an exciting couple of hours on the edge of the seats, but very few films even deliver that much.  I had fun.<br /><br />The cyberpunk London is suitably overcast and grimy, the gadgetry and magical accoutrements are plausibly laid out and constructed, most of the characters inhabit their roles nicely, even if they aren't as fully fleshed out as I'd like to see, but Robert Downey, Jr's melancholic charm and bitter wit is amply on display, always fun to watch.  The cinematography works, even if it gets a bit too choppy for my tastes - I expect that from a Guy Ritchie film - and in spite of a few soft spots and gaps the story rolls along nicely.  You can't go wrong with this one, it's a lot of light fun, unless you can't stand the sight of muscled men inventively pummeling one another every few minutes and clever men bickering jealously like an old married couple nearly as often.<br /><br />On the discs: the package comes with two discs - the Blu-Ray disc with the movies and extras, and a dvd disc with the movie and a digital copy. There are a few featurettes, and a fairly unique kind of director's commentary called \\"Maximum Movie Mode\\" where the director, Guy Ritchie, comes on to provide details about shots and plot at specific points of the movie.of muscled men inventively pummeling one another every few minutes and clever men bickering jealously like an old married couple nearly as often.<br /><br />On the discs: the package comes with two discs - the Blu-Ray disc with the movies and extras, and a dvd disc with the movie and a digital copy.

B00A0SKFLG|4.0|Having never seen the old Total Recall I found this movie to be good.  It isn't amazing, but it is an enjoyable sci-fi that I think is worth the few bucks to rent.
B00275EGWY|4.0|Director Kathryn Bigelow ([[ASIN:B00006CXGP Near Dark]], [[ASIN:B000GUJZ4G Point Break]]) pulls no punches with the Hurt Locker.  She doesn't shy from a theme - that war can be like a drug, both in its intensity and exhilaration and in the devastation of its effects.  At the same time she doesn't preach.  She tells a compelling story of a group of men who are tasked with one of the most critical and dangerous missions in Iraq, whose story has rarely been told and never this effectively: the bomb disposal units, whose job it is to find and defuse dangerous explosives under highly chaotic circumstances.<br /><br />While scenes of action are shot with a dynamic, documentary-style camera, the technique is not overused in this film.  Bigelow knows when to slow down and focus, and achieves a balance between storytelling and action, with a special focus on the kinds of relationships men build in times of war.  Bigelow is not afraid to let central characters die unexpectedly, and the film leads in some very unpredictable directions, that are for the most part plausible (with a few loose ends).  The film looks very good, and conveys the atmosphere, the heat, the tension, the explosive moments, all very effectively.  Recommended.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|It isn't often that I am impressed with contemporary literature, but I have to admit that this is one of the best I've read in years!
B000SEFNMS|5.0|An absolute must read for anyone that yearns for adventure. What a brave but selfish endeavor.  I understand his desire to be one with nature, but not letting his family know of his whereabouts while keeping in touch with strangers he met on his journey is cruel.  It would rip rip out my heart not knowing if my child was alive, in pain, held against their will....I couldn't bear it!!<br /><br />Having said all that, it made me want to go to Alaska.  Life is too short not to have an adventure of your own.  I've learned that there are more precious things in life than wealth and notoriety. I've found that I can get just as much satisfaction out of enjoying the natural beauty God has bestowed on us at any given moment of our life.  We have to just open our eyes to enjoy it.
B007TNS6JI|5.0|Excellent game fun to play, upgraded items are obtainable without having to purchase items.  Graphics are excellent and plenty to do between each realm and the different challenges in each board
B008HK3XKO|4.0|Very good product, and I like being able to stand up the Kindle for some things - makes it easier.
B009PAETCG|1.0|I have a Kindle Fire this app locks up and takes you to an app store.  The kid friendly game you have to purchase. If you download a free game you should be able to play every level for free. I suggest you save your memory space for something worth playing.
B005LAIIQC|2.0|Confusing, chase, blow something up, chase, zzzz. What a sad legacy to the Bourne movies. And the ending is really stupid. Go buy the trilogy instead.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I grew up reading Stephen King with my favorite books from him being The Stand and It, but hadn't taken time to read his books since The Green Mile.  A friend emailed me that this book was on sale for Kindle Edition, but before purchasing I downloaded the sample of the book.  I was hooked and read the entire sample the same evening.  I ended up buying the Kindle Edition book that same day and continued reading for several hours into the evening.  One of the things I like about 11/22/63 is the references to the setting and characters of &#34;It&#34; which of course make me want to re-read that book again as well.  Although I have not completed reading 11/22/63 as of this review, it is tough to turn off the tablet and stop reading just to get some sleep at night.  I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys Stephen King books and to anyone who would like to read a book which as a storyline evolving throughout a well known time in history.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|Still super fun, but takes getting used to. The whole gem bit is kinda wack and a cash grab. All sorts of opportunities to waste coin (Sold a 2500m boost in game, only gave me 1000m.) Would like to see sensitivity controls added or something, misreads swipes far more than TR1 has. Finally, big monkey is harder to see past. Still worth the download, looking forward to an update.
B000NY12LO|3.0|I am really trying to get through this book, only because I have heard there is a twist at the end.  Please, NO SPOILERS if you respond to this, please.  While the story is good in theory, I find myself slogging through all the grueling minutiae of the character's pasts.  I understand the need for a back story, or maybe I don't even understand that, at this point.  There is just too much drivel at times.  The parts about the \\"Professor of Happiness\\" cause me to turn pages, barely even skimming them.  I have been reading this book, going on almost a week now and it never takes me that long to read a book.  Usually I read 2 - 3 in that amount of time.  This book is way too long.  You could have chopped out a third, or maybe even half, and still had a fairly good story.  I'll check back after I make it through.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|love this game. very realistic and great for all horse lovers of all ages. also great graphic quality and sounds
B0091UAEA6|5.0|One of the best.  Will go down in history as an amazing portrayal of the life of a tier one operator.  The struggles at home & abroad are transparent & personal.  At this time, Act of Valor is my favorite movie.  This is a much watch but be careful, you might get some dust in your eye ;)
B009RI4FRU|4.0|I've watched most (if not all) of this director's films, and, while I loved them for the offbeat, quirky, and somewhat-arty feel, I still scratched my head at the end going, &#34;Huh?&#34; This movie is still a little weird, but it has so much heart compared to his others. Really sweet movie.
B00A9X9ORI|5.0|LOVED IT! Joseph Gordon-Lovitt is awesome as always! They did pretty good acually, with making him look like a young Bruce Willis. Would definitely watch it again.
B00AMBLXP8|2.0|I heard this movie was surprisingly touching. I thought it was more like a typical, by-the-boiler-late buddy comedy, but just with a talking bear replacing the human buddy. And the bear talked like the dad from &#34;Family Guy&#34; and yeah, I kow it's Seth McFarlane. But the accent and tone were similar so I kept thinking of Peter. Kinda annoying.
B000JQU1VS|5.0|Being unable to work gave me time to read.  This book was another classic.  Perfect short stories just before bed time.
B0002F6BRE|4.0|What else is there to say? If you like Will Ferrell, you'll love it. There are several truly LOL moments, and it's pretty kid friendly.
0786956291|5.0|It was a great starter for the game, and we learned a lot from it, now we're making our own campaigns and expanding on what this set gave us.
B00910Y1OQ|4.0|pretty fun. gameplay is simple, like any other matching game. graphics are nice. overall a good time waster. I would actually have paid for this, but I got lucky and found it on the deal of the day
B0032KNA4I|4.0|I liked it. The action was terrific, I really enjoyed it. I live witha very annoying person who never lets me watch what I want. I finally got to seer it without being bothered. The fx was amazing worth getting it. Ant time I want a movie it is always Amazon
B009SJ3H8Q|5.0|This show is great!  The first 2 seasons use a lot of the same actors but they are so great at what they do, you would think it is a new cast. This show is super creepy and you can never guess what's going to happen next!
B008JGSM6G|4.0|A good time killer.  When I'm waiting for something or someone I'll play for a few minutes.<br />Grandsons seem to enjoy it also.
B00AIQP9DE|3.0|Very enjoyable game. Good puzzles. I will probably order more in the future.  Very good graphics., well used in developing the story line.
B00992CF6W|4.0|I know nothing about it, but my grandsons love it and really try to explain it to me to no avail!
B007BFSYMS|5.0|Works flawlessly on my LG Revolution. No pauses or skipping which is amazing when compared to my $150 Sony Dream Machine and the annoying pause between each loop. Got this as faotd but would have gladly paid for it.
B0097NGUJG|5.0|Refreshing and innovative. Great from start to finish! I can't stop listening to it, it seriously the best album of the year and then some.
B009PNQUXO|1.0|it didn't work at all. I tried it on a couple of videos, and it said it was downloading, but it didn't. i suggest you don't get it.
B007XIC1GI|5.0|I'm so speechless, Manson is as much an artist and a work of art as this book. A really fantastic read.
B0067YF02Q|1.0|It's essentially a lazy rehash of the 2006 release, complete with a slightly outdated transfer, lousy Dolby Digital audio and the same extras as the 2002 Collector's Edition DVD. Fancy packaging aside, this is the worst kind of double-dip: one that could've been fantastic with a small amount of effort. Warner Bros. also earns negative points for hinting at a &#34;new restoration&#34; that doesn't exist....and to be honest, such a misleading type of release is only deserving of one rating in my book. Too bad zero stars is not an option.
B005DNPHN4|5.0|IT WAS AN EASY TRANSACTION AND WATCHED THE MOVIE ALMOST IMMEDIATELY AFTER PURCHASE. WAS A GREAT MOVIE AND HAD NO PROBLEMS STREAMING IT.
B0030ZOYJ0|5.0|Awesome redux of a one of the best anime stories of all time. Top notch in every regard. Five stars.
B00AMBK0X4|5.0|Best comedy movie ever it funny awsome  one of the greatest movie I have ever seen in my life ever<br /><br />TED<br />UNRATED
B00A6RVRXG|5.0|After only listening to the first minute of 'Ohm', the opening track of Yo La Tengo's excellent new album Fade, you get the feeling that something is different. It has a weight to it in its simplicity of only guitar, drums, and vocals that hasn't been heard before in a YLT song. Not that they gave us fluff before.  Yo La Tengo have always been epic songwriters, channeling everyone from The Feelies to Burt Bacharach, and putting it through their own New Jersey filter. Adding equal parts piss, vinegar, heart, and humor that has made this band endearing from the very beginning. The kind of band you'd get into a fist fight over defending their genius. But this time around, there's something different. They seem to have sidestepped the genre-hopping, the 10-minute guitar dirges, and even the break neck punk head butts we heard on I Am Not Afraid Of You And I Will Beat Your Ass. No, here on Fade Ira, James, and Georgia have given us the most precise, pop-inflected, introspective, and transcendent Yo La Tengo album yet. 'Ohm' sets the mood this time around. Simple, direct, and inspiring.<br /><br />But we still have some fun on this album, too.<br /><br />'Is That Enough' sounds like a Brill Building lost track. Something that would've fit nicely on the b-side of a Shagri-las or Shirelles \\"45\\". 'Well You Better' starts with some great electric piano before a head-bobbing drum 'n bass part come in that gives you the feeling of summertime, elephant ears, and lost love. 'Paddle Forward' is a great little rocker that comes in, slaps you around just right, then gets out in less that 3 minutes. YLT have been known to spread songs out past the 10, 12, 17 minute mark. Hell, even whole sides of vinyl have been reserved for one song(hello, 'Night Falls On Hoboken'). But Yo La Tengo are just as adept at writing quick and catchy 2 and 3 minute symphonic pop masterpieces, and they do that quite often on Fade.<br /><br />There are 3 masterworks on this record. One opens the album('Ohm'), one is the centerpiece('Stupid Things'), and one closes out the record('Before We Run'). 'Stupid Things' is this mid-album trance. Something you get completely lost in while listening on headphones. It's that kind of track that will endear Yo La Tengo to their devoted followers for all eternity(or at least until they put out a dubstep album). It's soft in sound, yet hard in its punch. Like the meaning of life found at the end of side A. 'Before We Run' is one of the most beautiful tracks Georgie Hubley has sang on yet. She adds a sense of peace to an already sublime track. A whispered promise. A consoling brush of the hand.<br /><br />This record feels like an extended sigh. A sigh of relief? A sigh of contemplation? I think it might be both. When I hear this album I have a feeling of coming to terms with life. Where we're at in it. Our place in the grand scheme of things. Maybe that's what Ira, James, and Georgia were thinking when they wrote beautiful tracks like 'I'll Be Around', 'Cornelia and Jane', and 'The Point Of It'. Maybe they felt like taking a breather from hearing their hearts beat as one, turning things inside-out, and beating our asses. Maybe the morning seems a little brighter, and the coffee tasted a bit richer in the world of Ira, James, and Georgia and they wanted to share that with us. Hell, maybe they just wanted to sing some songs.<br /><br />Whatever the reason, I thank them for this gift of a record., one is the centerpiece('Stupid Things'), and one closes out the record('Before We Run').

B008673ZAQ|5.0|Can't wait for the 3rd book to come out!  Great book kept me on my toes, and pulled me into the book making me feel the emotions that the characters were feeling!
B0043JDUNS|4.0|I needed something action packed and distracting to watch and this was the ticket.  Robert Downey is really good at playing the arrogant, obnoxious type of guy.
B0086700CM|5.0|Best game ever it is so good I just couldn't stop the game and I think that everybody should get it . The characters are cool and the game is easy to. I really recommend this game.  (: d:
B001KZG99A|4.0|I needed something action packed and distracting to watch and this was the ticket.  Robert Downey is really good at playing the arrogant, obnoxious type of guy.
B008M721MS|5.0|awesome and this is very very good but it is always hard to work with at first try it and see
B007BFSYMS|4.0|Got this as the free app of the day and have to say over all I like it. only thing I think they really need to change is the looping because some of the tracks are very obvious when it starts over. I also like it has a wide variety of sounds to choose from (even weird ones like a vacuum, lol) .
B00AYB0TOW|4.0|If this 74 year old man could find this movie highly entertaining then so can you. Yes there is violence but all the Dredd stories had violence. The story line is strong and the film is well worth seeing. This is one of those films that some reviewers let some violence keep them from seeing the violence was necessary to be honest to the story line. Do yourself a favor and you be the judge.
B000N2HBSO|5.0|The most in-depth and revealing account of the Lincoln administration and his cabinet I have read. The book illustrates how his presidency really functioned and the character of the men who ran it. Better than the multiple volumes of Sandberg.
1600247245|5.0|Michael Connelly has not disappointed in this his next offering.l put it in the car CD player and finished it in just 3 days.
B0015DROBO|5.0|One of the best detective/mystery books to come along for a long time. A mystery within an enigma. Great book.
144235545X|5.0|The book takes us forward with all the characters we have grown to know and love. I can't wait for the next one.
B003OUXECE|4.0|From beginning to end, this was a great and sometimes in depth look at what makes Bioshock such an entrancing game...the city and the plight of its citizens!
1401225756|2.0|The book itself was fantastically written, and a super credit to it's genre however  the retouching uses an extremely contrasting use of gradients and  the colors mix so poorly that it is eye-straining to even look at. It is okay if you want a decent copy that you don't mind getting torn to hell, but other than that it is and ugly and unfair way to read an otherwise beautiful series. You'd be better off buying the original 20 first print online they are far better looking and more enjoyable
B003YK42M0|5.0|This is an awesome album you cant go wrong with kings of leon. this album was a little different from their others, and its interesting to see how the music progressed / changed with each track .
B005HJU7HA|5.0|This is my first Kindle book and I can't stop reading it:)  My favorite part is the dictionary since there are a lot of words in this book that I don't know.
0765325950|4.0|I love the WoT series and I think Mr. Sanderson did the best he could.  No judgement on him, I've read the Mistborn and Elantris and they're good books.  But nobody beats Mr. Jordan, especially not in his own world.  I had hoped for a stronger feeling of RJs presence in the final installation.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|its just the best app I have had and trust me there's a lot I love it the best app ever. if your not a horse lover something is very very wrong with you not being rude its the best app. add me gloriousphillies.
B007WEQ3K8|4.0|A love a produc that is fun and helps your brain to function properly. Looking forward to trying all of the games on it.
B007BFSYMS|5.0|GREAT app! Just the ticket to drown out noisy kids and blaring tv. Great for relaxing. Totally recommend!<br /><br />Lobe that more sounds can be downloaded.
B009NPKTN6|5.0|If you are a child of the 80's as I was and your heyday (20's) were in this time period, then I highly suggest this movie. Brought back great memories. Still don't like Tom Cruise though.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I've watched the movie but it's nothing like this! ITS10:00pm I'm supposed to be asleep but I couldn't stop reading!I hope the next person that reads it will enjoy it as much as new!
B00A6PD9I4|4.0|Like the story line, a bit more serious then I thought it would be. Wanted more laughs but would recommend.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Spoiler alert but how does district 12 get blown to bits! I need to know how soon! Please I can't stand to wait!
B000JPRPAO|5.0|And you won't let it out until the very end! You come in during the middle of the job...that's a little confusing, but as it plays out, you get how good the rest of the movie is going to be.
B00B49L7JY|5.0|A must see!  I feel in love with Rodriguez when it was first released, and after watching it again on DVD.  Truly an amazing story!
B002ZB26AO|3.0|I am from N. Korea right after 1945 and I already knew what it's like.<br />Yes, the Author got a nice information from a girl.  That's just about it.<br />I am pretty sure it got worse since we left N. Korea but that's the reasons we left.<br /><br />The book is okay, she writes well for us to read easy.
B007SGM084|3.0|SERIES WAS FINE. READ IT TO SEE WHAT ALL OF THE HYPE WAS ABOUT. WOULD HAVE BEEN A GOOD VACATION READ.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|I like the way he writes. If he has another book, I will read  it again.  Always simplicity and interesting.
B007BFSYMS|4.0|so far I like the sounds. it`s pretty intuitive to use. Looking forward to waking up to beach sounds and I like going to sleep on the boat.
B00A9X9ORI|5.0|This one was more than I expected for sure!  Don't let the previews or reviews ruin the good parts for you, just pick it up and watch it!  It's more than just a simple action movie.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Fun to play, awesome graphics good if you like horses.....awesome stuff to buy good if you wanna know how to take care of horse
B001XUPF2O|5.0|IMHO this is the best one of the last 3 Batmans, those who disagree typically don't want as much plot, and prefer a bit more action.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I feel like I'm actually taking care of a horse. It's a fun game to play, but you gotta keep up with it.
B001VNB54A|5.0|I think the stories are almost as good as band of brothers.  The visuals and sound is better, but the timeframe and locations are spread much wider, so getting the same character appreciation is harder.  Still worth buying for sure!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game I have a son who loves it I love it to my whole family loves it
B002IXA5KW|4.0|It's a basic gritty crime superhero movie, but has some fun spins and concepts around they're powers and backstory.  Worth a watch, but not a purchaser for me.
0385535139|5.0|Purchased book for my wife, she she is a Grisham fan and considers it to be one of a set of great books.
B004FHP9KA|5.0|This cast has been doing a lot of movies together lately, and they work great together.  Great thought provoking and fun to watch movie.
0385532458|5.0|I purchased this for my wwikd and she loved it.  All Grisham books are great and very entertaining, great prucse.
B000YHG72E|5.0|A new classic for sure!  Family fun the whole family can enjoy without boring the adults.  A great one to own for the holiday season.
B00B2V66VS|2.0|I read the other reviews saying it wouldn't boot on the Kindle and decided I would try it out anyway. I played it just fine the first day, but that was it. Since then the game hasn't loaded up correctly and just returns to the home screen. I liked the part I could play, but -3 stars until it gets patched.
B000VDDWDS|3.0|It's exactly what you'd expect, and nothing more.  Cannons, waves, old ships, swords etc.  Great sound, picture quality, and a fun story, but it's not going to &#34;change&#34; your world.  A low price makes it an easy buy though.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|This series is so well done.  The casting, sets, characters and writing are all top notch.<br />Each episode draws you further into life at Downton Abbey.<br />Highly, highly recommend giving this series a try.
B00AYB1RGG|1.0|It's a slow motion blood fest.  I feel like they chose a drug that makes life feel like slow motion for the picture just so they could have more slow motion stuff.  If you like 300 or Sin City you might love this one though.
B004GYY714|5.0|Works like a charm.  Am grateful to the developers.  I use his app when away to hear my local stations.
B003MXD694|4.0|Great for the family.  A fun story that's also fun for the adults to butch.  Maybe even worth buying.  Loved it.
B004SD5GZ4|3.0|I dont use it unless its for homework but its handy it allows me to do what i need to.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|This was a good game. It had a lot of nice graphics and a good story line.  It wasn't a hard game to figure out.
044042321X|5.0|The book is great, I recommend it to any game of thrones fan and/or fans of well written graphic novels.
B003P9VZ0W|5.0|I bought these for my baby cousin who was moving into a new home. She wasn't very happy that she had to redecorate her room and transfer schools. So I bought these decals to help decorate her room. She LOVED them. Had so much fun and now I'm the cool cousin. lol :)
B00APUQJLO|1.0|Horrible, boring, hard to understand. Worst movie ever. Didn't even finish watching it was so bad. I can't believe I wasted $4 on it.
B0089XH38M|2.0|I didn't care for this due to it made my Kindle Fire run weird.  It disabled certain things I didn't want turned off and then I couldn't turn AVG off!
B002VPE1WK|5.0|I love it. Received it in record time, about 3 days I think. Plenty of room. The layout inside is great. It securely holds the camera and accessories.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Great logic game for multitasking people.  Not difficult to get started and play.<br />Lots of fun.  Share with other people.
B004VMUS9G|4.0|I just wish there was more of a variety of alarm tones. Other than that, a great app for me.
B0055SWM08|5.0|love this app very much, its relaxing but challenging at the same time. i think anyone could find a liitle pleasure with this app
B008B1VYP0|5.0|I am a Maroon 5 fanatic (more when Jesse was still there) however I really do love this album. I will also say the radios have mainstreamed all the wrong songs, but of course, I love every single song :)
B002G1YPH0|4.0|Keeps my custom built gaming rig super cool by about 10 degrees as compared to other fans ive used.<br /><br />Its a little difficult to install and really large so if you have a small tower I do not reccommend getting this
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|It's a pretty entertaining free game. Of course it's more difficult to do things very effectively without<br />paying actual money but if you just randomly have time to kill, the energy meter refills itself every 1/2 to 1 hour, I'm not exactly sure so you can keep coming back to it to make progress. Very slow going and for more patient people but hey I think it's fun for being free!
B000IFSDZQ|5.0|Wish this had been released in the US.  Only real complaint, apart from needing to watch the PAL DVD on my laptop instead of my TV due to the disc version, is why the video for &#34;One Wish&#34; was mysteriously excluded?  Maybe a new version will be released here?
1596177373|5.0|awesome deck of playing cards... saving them for a birthday gift =) gotta so fast would like to order more too
B0036EH3UC|5.0|Product originally arrived damaged.  Returned it to Amazon, and the replacement arrived two days before the promised delivery window.  Set is beautiful, and all discs appear to work.  The movie 'The Plan' should be listed on the website or package; it isn't, but is hidden in one of the disc sleeves.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I said it above! Why say more. This is bs... 13  words more; word, word, word, word, word, word, word, done.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Oh my gosh!!  i have been whating waiting  whatever on this app forever!!!  my friend had it on her ipod  and it is awesome.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I am completely obsessed with this show!  I watched the entire first season in one day and am now into the second season on the second day.  Everything else can wait.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love it  it's the best game to get it teaches you how to take care of your bourse. Love it
B001OFJPIS|4.0|Never gets old this movie, and the way they built the world still amazes me to this day. Great movie
B006LSZECO|3.0|The story is too far fetched.  The characters are nothing but negative which makes it hard to read. I went with the plot for awhile but it fades towards the end and goes out with a whimper.  We know already that both characters are negative.<br />I suppose the book sells so well because of its unusual plot which is promoted by the publisher etc.
B0057RCFQS|4.0|Pretty good fan of Jurassic park. The movies arrived in excellent condition and so far my girlfriend and I are really loving it. although with the Jurassic 4 and possibly 5 coming its not really gonna be the ultimate collection now will it?
B00AREIAI8|5.0|very fun I love horses great game for kids. everybody happy happy happy _ duck dynasty. quote but its a great game yall
B0076DCT2G|3.0|I love the charcter John Corey but this book I felt was quite wordy. I wound up trying to speed read rather than enjoying every page as I previously have experienced.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|This book found me! and I couldn't put it down.  Dr. Alexander's account of his experience made my heart swell and my tears flow.
B002NHGG92|5.0|Being 46 I was quite surprised to find myself sucked into this show. Incredibly creative writers. They've far exceeded the book versions,
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|This is a dvd. of a show. if you like the show, you'll like the dvd. pretty straight forward bro.
B005LAIH54|5.0|This movie far exceeded the first; although the first was great. Action-packed mythological tale. Great acting and special effects as well
B008FOB124|5.0|I am blown away by this CD. the blend of beat, voice and instruments makes for a wonderful journey! I recommend this!
B009HV2JT8|4.0|I admit I was pleasantly surprised at the acting, story line and production. While it was all about killing vampires; the &#34;killing&#34; was done in a surreal, removed fashion that wasn't disgusting. Glad I picked it up!
B008S8PPPG|5.0|I happen to be one of those music lovers who prefers to have at least some knowledge of the artist/band I am listening to before commenting on what they have to offer. Recently however,there have been so many talents who have come out of the blue,and who have very little musical back round history to draw that type of opinion from. The only reason Jessie Ware was even made aware to me was because one of the employee's at Bullmoose Books & Music where I frequently shop commented while putting her newest single on the rack that he found her image striking despite knowing nothing about her. A little Wikipedia search later I did learn something about her. Born to a Jewish family in South London,this singer/songwriter sang for others artists I don't know anything about such as Joker and SBTRKT before launching out on her own. The manner in which her sound was described was more than curiosity inducing for me. When I followed up on that? Well,the effect was amazing.<br /><br />  Starting off the the title,\\"Wildest Dreams\\",\\"Talking In Water\\" and the closer \\"Something Inside\\" are all dynamically produced songs blending instrumental ideas from contemporary electronica and urban jazzy soul/funk. Melodically all of these songs have a very romantically and poetically anthemic flavor about them. I do have some personal favorites here too. \\"Running\\" is one of them,with it's dreamy,glittery 80's type synthesizers harmonizing over fat electronic rhythms with the same effect along with the extremely strong melody and song craft of course. \\"Still Love Me\\",churning funk with it's combination of both minimal percussive and melodic rhythms and keyboard sounds, evokes directions pioneered from funk-soul/eurodance pioneers as Prince and Loose Ends in the 1980's. \\"Sweet Talk\\" evokes a similar flavor with more of a rocking rhythm to it,featuring that quavery synthesizer sound I always loved again from the mid 80's.<br /><br />  \\"No To Love\\",\\"Night Light\\" and \\"Swan Song\\" are all a bit more reflective of the last twenty years production and rhythmic wise but follow a similar track to where the rest of the album went. \\"110%\\" is another highlight: a beautiful mixture of world beat,electronic and folk with a finely crafted melody. It's a marvelous thing to hear a beautifully melodic and rhythmically based album full of hit potential that isn't based on noisy,over EQ'd electronics or auto tuned singing. Jessie Ware's overall style,which I'd describe as being somewhere between Amel Larrieux ,Adele and Sade is filled to the brim with passion and a strong eye for many well rounded grooves. There is a glossy futurist dance/funk air about it. Still it cannot be overstated the nucleus of Ware's talents are that she's very musically balanced in not over or underplaying her songwriting,production or singing. Not only is this a superb album by a superb new artist but an excellent example for anyone looking to expand out new directions in melodic grooving jazz/funk/soul/pop.eflective of the last twenty years production and rhythmic wise but follow a similar track to where the rest of the album went. \\"110%\\" is another highlight: a beautiful mixture of world beat,electronic and folk with a finely crafted melody.

B008J34466|4.0|She keeps wowing me with her music, incredible range of styles, and that amazing voice of hers. One talented rock chick.
B00787IR2Q|5.0|Great movie, my kids and family love this movie. So cute and good watch for the whole gang. Need more clean moview like this
B00AGDVWDK|5.0|This original is what the remake &#34;The Preacher's Wife&#34; was based on.  Even Denzel Washington and Whitney Houston can't beat Cary Grant and Loretta Young.  This is my favorite holiday movie.
B004GYY714|5.0|Great for sports out of area. Especially for secluded places in below zero temps by a fire. A must have!
B009HV2JT8|3.0|My expectations were not that high when I started watching the movie.  The creative historical liberties taken were vast and the amount of blood was excessive.  However, the acting was acceptable and cinematography was good. This would be a good movie to watch on a Friday night when you don't want to think after a long work week.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|My nine year old really loves the original, but for some reason I could never get into it. I think my qualm was that it all looked the same and bored me after awhile.<br />This version has enough diversity that I love it! The scenery of trails and mine carts....I feel like Indiana stinkin Jones!!
B000002G8J|5.0|For a studio album, this is a must have. Eric is at his best, good blues songs. A must have.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|When I first heard about this show, I had no interest in watching it.  I thought it would just be a bunch of zombie's running around.  But after repeatedly hearing people talking about it, I decided to at least watch the first episode. I was hooked and proceeded to watch all the back episodes to catch up. The show has amazing special effects, great acting, and reels you in, so that you are anticipating the next episode.
B009KNPNT6|5.0|If you like Eric Clapton, then this deluxe edition is a must have. You will not be disappointed. A great album.
1451695195|5.0|It was refreshing to hear a qualified doctor talk about his experience, not just someone who wanted to write a book.
B000MD9UJC|4.0|(See update at end)<br />The LED Lamp is great!<br />Super Bright!<br />BUT;<br />Unfortunately, the spring in the tail cap switch is too weak.<br />So it doesnt push the batteries tight enough against the socket/switch.<br />The problem could be that my Maglite is old and it holds the batteries a bit snug in the tube.<br />Nevertheless, THAT half of the product is useless.<br />The spring in the new switched tailcap is about HALF the gauge of the original tailcap spring.<br /><br />It may work fine if I can true up my battery chamber.<br />I see a worn spot inside where the batteries have rubbed the anodize off.<br />No dent visible from outside though.<br /><br />If it turns out it  works fine later I will come back and confess.<br />The thing is; with the ORIGINAL factory cap everything works great.<br /><br />I cant just swap springs because the new one is soldered in 2 places and heating it up could damage the switch inside.<br /><br />UPDATE (1/26/2013):<br /><br />OK, I got it to work.<br />I had some older Duracell Copper Tops in it (still plenty of juice),<br />they must have swollen because when I put new Energizers in, they slid right in....<br />and the Tailcap switch works fine.<br />I added another STAR to my review.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I think that the quality editor is cool if you have a slow Kindle or any device you have.Also I laughed when I saw the huge monkey too
B0038M2AZA|5.0|Terrific movie. I was skeptical before I watched it but it was spot on. I have met temple Grandin in person and Claire Danes was perfect!
B005CRQ4GU|4.0|One of the best yet (diary of a wimpy kid ) Jeff Kinney is an amazing author I'm glad he does what he does
B005F3XV62|5.0|I love Kevin James and all his movies. I think this was my favorite. My grandkids like to watch it with me, too.
B008NABUU8|4.0|Even after 30 minutes, I still find myself going back to previous bridges once I learn new tricks. Very cool game.
B005ETANC2|5.0|This is another favorite of mine in the GIANT insects running amuck genre.  As far as I'm concerned, there aren't nearly enough GIANT insect movies to satisfy me.  Be that as it may, this is one of the lesser efforts in that genre because the tarantula actually takes second billing to a crazy professor.  As far as screen time goes, the tarantula is a guest star in its own movie.  Most of the story involves a crazy professor (Leo G. Carroll) who uses the excuse of an impending food shortage to experiment on animals.  Naturally, his experiments get the better of him.  This movie also stars John Agar as the town doctor; he spends an inordinate amount of time smiling at the oddest moments.............when not leering at costar Mara Corday (the aforementioned crazy professor's new assistant).  As for the tarantula, once in a while it wanders by before throwing caution to the wind, allowing itself to be seen by one and all.  A rampage ensues, easily the best part of this movie.  Nothing says PEEK-A-BOO like a giant tarantula peering in your bedroom window!  This film works best as a double feature with something like The Deadly Mantis (also a favorite of mine).
B0083B3KOQ|4.0|I just converted a file for my Kindle Fire.<br /> This was my third try and it was successful.  This appears to be the  only file conversion app currently available at this.time.
B0027P2ZWC|5.0|I had this version of Les Mis on VHS growing up and I loved it.  It's nice to have the music to listen to in the car on long trips.  I also like that the album has pretty much the entire musical, not just the major songs.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|this game is great for anyone who loves the first temple run!!!!!!! great new jumps... just a lot of fun!!!!!!
B00A11AN6O|5.0|This app makes it so easy to view photos on the original Kindle Fire. I am pleased with this app.
0684874350|4.0|The book is sad and amazing at the same time. It is incredible the way some people live their lifes, making everyone around misserable at the same time as loving them.
B002BSHWUU|1.0|So individually these cost 10$ but together the 14 CDs cost 200$???<br /><br />The math doesn't add up. Plus, most people already have this music, they just want to have it in a neat collection. Why pay 200$ to have something you already have. I'd gladly pay 100 for a neat collection like this, but 200$ is just too much to ask for something I already own
0061928356|3.0|Good storyline and remarkably good writing for a debut novel. There are a few obvious holes and a fairly predictable ending but all in all it keeps a reader going. Unfortunately there is no depth in the characters. The story is written entirely from a woman's perspective and the male characters are uni dimensional. As is typical with Indian (or of Indian origin) authors these days there is a fair amount of India bashing. Perhaps that makes it more appealing to the western audience and/or the award committees? There is some halfhearted attempt at redemption at the end, but it is not nearly enough. The evils of India depicted in the story are not new, but her attempt to show that the human spirit triumphs over the long odds falls flat. Read Shantaram by Gregory David Roberts for a much better depiction of life in Dharavi.
B004J4WKTW|4.0|I've read mixed reviews on this book. As a huge fan of fantasy literature I thought it was written beautifully. It had such a unique plot and the author was so visually descriptive I felt as though I was standing right in the middle of the circus. I felt the emotions and internal conflicts of the characters. I recommend reading it if you are interested in fantasy/magical type books. Some people write 10 page reviews I'll just say try it...you'll like it.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|This was a great book about a man who was driven to perfection and how he at points failed and other points succeeded. It's well written and takes a no hold barred approach to Jobs that looks at him as imperfect as a human but raises the question of whether that imperfection and desire to make great products was what made him great.
1613821670|5.0|This version so far is very thorough about all the ways that Mary Shelley's classic can be viewed. Needed it for school it was a good price, thanks
B0099Y2MYK|1.0|I just sent for this, got it, and tried it on my DVD player. Doesn't work. Have returned it to the UK. What's the deal here???
B002KS1IJC|5.0|Good entertainment.  A little brutal, but over all enjoyable.  Satisfying ending.  A good watch for Sci-FI aficionados.  Recommend it to anyone who enjoys sci-fi.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|It was so enthralling......I was drawn in and it kept me on edge until the very end! Two thumbs up!
B002QS5OQ4|2.0|Didn't have the fun and quality characters of the original Stargate Series.  These characters were too self-involved, too much unnecessary sex, very little self-discipline.  Overall the characters were not people with whom I would choose to spend time.  the plots didn't resolve themselves satisfactorily.  Was disappointed.
B0096DFBZQ|1.0|I had a hard time with the game.in fact I ended up deleting the game. so I don't have it any more
B001CB8NQE|5.0|They did a nice job.  Characters were interesting.  Plots plausible and stimulating.  Good resolution to issues.  Dialog allowed to be genuine.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|What an emotional, strong, and powerful book!!! Colleen Hoover did an amazing job while writing this storyline. I absolutely love how the characters developed throughout the book. The details not only allow you to relate to them, but also, understand them.. understand their pain due to the situations they've suffered.  I LOVE LOVE LOVE Dean Holder.. And how he's with Sky..??  Wow..!! What a guy!! His passion driven attitude is breathtaking.<br /><br />... If you haven't read this book.. You really need to!! Its storyline is very realistic with unfortunate situations and the way Colleen Hoover wrote about them is simply worth your time. I was blown away!
B0083SBMBM|5.0|This is a classic!  Everyone of the characters were interesting, the plot was well thought out, the bad guy was especially heinous, and it was delightful to see him mashed by the Hulk.  Excellent entertainment!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I know I said I loved this game but not as much as love NIALL HORAN from ONE DIRECTION. but I love horses too but still that's why I got this game I love horses
B00APUQH0W|5.0|great movie.. I am going to miss clint.. he is getting pretty old , but can still bring it when it time..
B0071XO8RA|5.0|First of all, thanks for writing this book - it was a joy to read it. This is science fiction at its best: clear, logical story, great characters and good pacing. The story is so interesting that I had a hard time putting this down. The characters are all well developed and belivable, just like their actions and the entire setting of the story. Highly recommended.
B00ARAO0WM|5.0|not stop action movie.. i really liked it.  a quick brown fox can jump all day long if he wants to.
B008XG1X18|5.0|This is a great app! Very easy to access and easy to use. Just like accessing pinterest from your computer. I would recommend this for above the other options such as pinhog.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|Loved the book, always love a great story, it really draws you in. beautifully written as always with Nicholis Sparks, I love all of his books, although not all of the endings, this one had a good ending.
B00ADYY7MA|5.0|I would recommend this to anyone but especially if you are a Nashville fan. I'm not usually one to buy a Soundtrack from a show but I love every song on this soundtrack! Worth every penny!!!!
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|I love the way the characters in his books seem so real. This was a great continuation of the story with a perfect cliff hanger at the end. I can't wait for the next installment!!!
B004SOR4H6|5.0|Works perfect! Just like having it on your phone. It is easy to access and easy to use! Very helpful.
0689835604|5.0|My toddler loves all of the books in Karen Katz &#34;Where Is...&#34; collection. This book is wonderful for teaching body parts as well as concepts such as: behind, in front of, and under. The flaps turn this into an interactive book and the variety of directions the flaps open engage problem solving skills.<br /><br />The pictures are also colorful and engaging and there are many things to point out and name.<br /><br />I would recommend this for babies and toddlers of all ages.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This book keeps you guessing all the way to the end. You can't stop reading it because you have to find out the end! It was on the top 10 reads for a reason. Great read!
B004HD61KE|5.0|Very difficult to put down<br />I found myself wishing I could visit the places described. Can't wait to read his next book.
B009329Y30|5.0|Downloading it to your Kindle is fast & easy! It's a great chick flick that even a guy would enjoy!
B004J4WKTW|4.0|A wonderfully magical read! It would be a pleasure to experience this circus and test the boundaries of reality. Thanks!
B0063IH60K|5.0|This is a great game to have on your kindle for everyone! You can play it at any time or place!
B002BY77CW|4.0|This book was  great option for a quick, fun read. Lauren Conrad 's fictional story is relatable and gives insight to how \\"real\\" reality tv may be. I enjoyed the storyline and look forward to reading the rest of the series.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this game is so cool and i just love horse and they are buttifle and there awsome.  i have tons of friends that have horse and there are so nice to be with and fun to ride
B00ARAN9JW|3.0|Good movie. But the best scenes in the preview were only ten seconds of the movie. There was no air battle, only a ten second scene of those cool aircraft.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Like just about everyone else, I love the series.  Amazon streaming quality was pretty good, but not as good as the PBS broadcast.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Wow! I am impressed! Temple Run 2 surpasses the greatness of Temple Run 1. The terrain is realistic and beautiful. You earn coins, powerups, and gems from achievements. I love it! Totally a 5 star. :)
B0027MJU00|4.0|Wow... I couldn't put this one down. Gillian Flynn could be a criminal mastermind; she does such a great job of keeping the plot moving in different directions, keeping every single detail straight throughout and tying up every lose end. And more impressively, she has such a gift for creating the most horrible, screwed up, angry characters. Libby is a 32-year-old woman whose family was murdered 25 years ago, allegedly by her brother (who is serving life in prison). She's spent her life living off the donations sent to her as the sole-survivor, but when the well runs dry she finds herself broke, with no skills or prospects. She has no choice but to revisit her past in her attempt to get over her trauma and put her life together. As we tag along on her journey through the past, we meet characters where one is more horrifying than the last. Although I don't think Dark Places was as brilliant as Gone Girl, I still think it's great work and a must read.
B004IHE2B4|5.0|We also got there'd train for Christmas and knew we would need extra track. This got us going. The right direction.  Will be getting two more for his birthday.
B005IQZB14|3.0|While the trip on the PCT itself was interesting the author was at times so self pitying that it made the memoir less enjoyable to read.
B003F3FJQO|3.0|Not as good as the first. Dragged out a bit. Decent but not my favorite. Will still read the third.
B0084U0IEG|4.0|The book is a fun read of the British Secret service and its tactics.  It had some interesting plot twists that made it enjoyable.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This is one of those books that you don't want to put down until you have read the ending. I recommend this book to everyone.
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|Very clever dialogue and not at all filled with self pity despite the sadness of the situation depicted. Ultimately it emphasizes the joy of living.
B005CRQ4GU|4.0|I really liked this book. I laughed a lot and I could really relate to Greg. Of course I would only recommend this book for kids and I think adults wouldn't like this book at all.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|Book is an interesting procedural novel on the legal system that was written in a clever way intergrating future grand jury data with the current trial and investigations.  It shows how little we can often understand our children, since we so often see what we want to see.
B0001I562I|5.0|I used to watch this movie when i was a kid. I recived it with no scratches and in a prompted time.
B0054NRC6S|1.0|Young guy, making big bucks, buys a Porsche, and is out of money within a week because he lost his job.<br /><br />Older guy, making even bigger, bucks, for undoubtedly 30 years, is also financially strapped when losing his job.<br /><br />I'm supposed to feel sorry for these guys?  I've been employed for 16 years at two different jobs, making far less money than any of these people. I could probably live for two years on savings--non retirement savings--alone.<br /><br />I do not have a Porshe.  I have a reasonable house.<br /><br />These people are idiots and I'm supposed to get sucked into this sob story?<br /><br />So out of touch.
B000AYEL6U|3.0|I like period dramas. The acting was okay but there didn't seem to be much chemistry between the leads. As the story progressed it improved somewhat, but I wish I had rented it first.
075669812X|5.0|The Lego Ninjago encyclopedia is a great book.  It gives information on all the characters and is a fun read for the Ninjago fan.  My son who is 8 loves reading through this book.
0800141660|5.0|This particular edition of Sense & Sensibility is my favorite because it stays faithful to Jane Austen's book. Ema Thompson does an exceptional job portraying the older sister, Elinor. Kate Winslet does a fine job as Marianne, the romantic younger sister. The story cleverly illustrates the manners, mores and morals of  society at the time, as well as the disadvantages of being a female. The story is built around the tragic death of the girl's father and the family fortunes being &#34;entailed&#34; to the eldest son of his previous marriage. The two girls and their mother have to give up their home and are economically at the mercy of a half-brother who barely knows them and the brother's greedy wife, who has no sympathy for the girls, their mother.or the situation.  The romantic adventures of both girls keep you entertained. I loved the &#34;happily ever after&#34; ending.
B0087JTAKW|5.0|This is the first book I read by Mitch Albom.  The story may have been fiction but it relates to the essence of real life.  It left me with a greater appreciation for life which I am sure was Mitch's main focus.
B000FA5SMK|4.0|I think the story was very interesting and I'm pleased that I discovered this author.  I'll be sure to look up his other works.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|You really need to get the game. It is realistic and it has great graphics. I love the game a lot
B00AIQP9DE|3.0|Can't get  past Manager's  Office because can't get into locked cabinet.  So can't save fortune teller and can't get last tooth piece.  Hint is no help.  Paid for game and can't play it.  :(
B004EAFQG0|4.0|be careful what you wish for. this movie definitely had me wondering if this were a true story. good delivery, crazy concept executed really well.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I started reading this book last week and if it weren't for school, it would have been completed in a day. I hated having to put it down because it was so captivating. I finally finished it and now I must see the movie just to compare the two. I cannot wait to start on the second and third books of this series. I read [[ASIN:0545166810 The Underland Chronicles: Books 1-5 Paperback Box Set]] and that was wonderfully well written and this, I believe is just as great! I hope that Suzanne Collins continues to write amazing stories for us all to feel like we're in another world! I can't get enough of her writing!
B004ZG5EYC|5.0|If you haven't seen \\"Amelie,\\" you owe it to yourself to go borrow it from someone. It is an extremely complex romantic comedy that is layered and inspiring and deeply felt and beautifully written.<br /><br />It is a  French film, but surprisingly, the film is so engaging that the subtitles melt away and I don't even notice them. This is also the film that made Audrey Tautou a star (she costarred with Tom Hanks in \\"The DaVinci Code.\\"<br /><br />The symbolism, the theme of helping others and looking at what's stopping us....all the different characters really WANT something. And each character has their own interesting and whimsical way of getting there.<br /><br />In the heightened French reality, I am inspired to see my life in a whole new way, and it fills me with hope. This is one of those movies that will stick with you, that you'll always remember and that will change you.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Although I usually dislike fiction, the Author Suzanne Collins has written an intriguing story that all ages can identify with. I was stuck overnight unexpectedly without reading material and a kind housekeeper allowed me to borrow, for the night, a book that a guest had left for her in another room. Rather than watch TV, or worse be alone with my own thoughts, which is a revolting idea, I read the book.<br /><br />Those of us who are older and who remember when children were less valued than today and times when times were truly hard, can understand the thinking that went into this project. The book is about survival and it's covered on many levels. I doubt that I will adopt the habit of reading fiction, but this one was not a total waste of my time and I was appreciative that I had reading material to pass my time on this uneventful night in my life. When I got home I bought this book as a gift for the boy that trims my yard. The boy gave the book a raving review.
B002QH2NUA|5.0|My dad has been a fan of Sir Paul for a long time especially on his Beatles days so it was nice to have this 2cd/1dvd with his show on New York!
B00127RAJY|4.0|I can excerise with Jillian in the comfort of my home.  I am looking forward to shaping up in 30 days.
B00A80SHFM|3.0|The singing is suberb, however too many great pieces were cut or eliminated probably to save space.  I was disappointed in it.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|my son and I had a lot of fun doing this together. graphics are really cool. great free game. it kept us guessing. it wasn't a game that got boring. it was something new to the end
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I enjoyed it, I am anxious to see the movie.  I hope the movie follows the book and shows the intense relationship of these 2 good people.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game because it is fun for all ages and it help teach kids about horses.  I love this game!!!!!!!
B007IXWKUK|3.0|Better story line, less sex. Ana is stronger, and not  a wimp. I like the ending, it makes you want to read Fifty Shades Free
B0086700CM|5.0|omg I love it so much I WISH I CAN PLAY FOREVER EVER UNTIL I DIE ITS SO COOL  LOVE IT!!!!!!
B004GHNIRK|4.0|This is my third time reading this novel.  I can follow it, but for the first timer it can be quite confusing.  Victor Hugo takes twenty chapters to make one point.
B0068LYEHA|5.0|Thought provoking, entertaining, and laugh out loud funny! Caitlin Moran makes a great model, I would recommend this book to every woman I know!
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|This is the best game you can find for Kindle, and it is free! No even a Not Free game is as great as this one.
B00AMBLXP8|1.0|We chose to watch this film because Wahlberg can be funny and the concept COULD have been entertaining. HOWEVER, this is an uneven, poorly constructed tale that panders to the  basest instincts. Sad and pathetic. Save your $$$$$.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Love has no boundaries no pain no fault.  Compare to cancer its selfish does not care who it as attacks. Deep and to the point.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|First time I have ever given a review. This story is spellbounding for those who enjoy survival on the ultimate scale.<br />The details of problems to survive in a deadly environment must have taken a lot of research.
B004DI7HZ6|2.0|To be honest i read up to the part where the vampire was singing her to sleep. Come on really.I then threw the book over my sholder never to open it up again.I just wanted to get through the book and i couldnt.A pretty big dissipointment to an optimistic reader. The book lacked cleverness and spunk.And had nothing in it to make me want to read on.
B008FSCNTK|5.0|I love Diana Krall and this CD is an amazing collection of songs.  I'd heard it was &#34;dark&#34; material but I don't agree with this assessment at all.  They're honky tonk songs, many written during the Depression. They are songs about life--both the good and bad.  I particularly like &#34;Prairie Lullaby.&#34;  I picture a mother singing this song to her child at bedtime--perhaps she sings this to her own children?  I highly recommend this CD.  Very inventive and shows her range as an artist who is willing to try different things.
0425264351|5.0|You can't lay it down !!  Entertainment all the way ! I have read the entire series and keep coming back looking for more !
B004LROUNG|5.0|John Grisham writes another great legal drama.  Good writing, good story.  I enjoyed it very much and recommend it to anyone who likes his writing.
B009MO57H6|5.0|Obviously another movie is coming !  Great ending , keeps you begging for more !  Let's hear it for cloning !!!  Can you imagine 2000 or more Milla Jovovich clones !!  Yahoo !!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|It is fun, Ive had a little trouble figuring out how to advance in the competitions though.  But for a free game there is variety and its realistic.
B002ZG98UA|5.0|The only thing I didn't like about this one was the ending !  But, it made you sure their would be another great film coming because they left you hanging wondering what !! ???
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|As with the first two glorious seasons, we see yet again the depth of humanity despite the social classes of vintage England. I am consistantly glued to the screen whenever it comes on....and even though my husband is more of a Duck Dynasty sort of fellow, he is found guilty of peeking as well. This series has the perfect balance of intruige for both sexes & all ages. Good heavens, you should watch it for Maggie Smith's performance alone! Enjoy!! :)
0061900656|5.0|We are T-minus 5 weeks until baby #2, and we've been reading this to our 2 year old for the last several months.  He actually requests it because he enjoys it so much.  While I have no idea if it will actually make his adjustment to a new baby in the house any easier, it certainly has informed him of the fact that mommy is having a baby...
B008K6HN8I|5.0|This is a superbly useful utility and is as feature rich as a file explorer needs to be.  Select, copy and paste tools are very intuitive.
B003UESJF6|4.0|Very cute alternative to all of the Disney Pixar films.  I recommend for kids 3+; mine love it and ask for it all the time!
B00005JN2Z|5.0|GREAT ACTION AND MYSTERY. TOM DOES'NT HAVE ALOT OF LINES ... THATS WHY I LIKED IT. HE WAS GREAT IN SHOOTING SCENCES. ALLEY SHOOT DOWN OF 3 THIGS IN 2 SECONDS WAS 100% DETROIT.<br />IN OTHER WORDS NOT LIKE L.A. WHERE THE SHOOTERS KILL 6 PEOPLE AND THE ONE THEY WANT TO KILL NEVER GETS HIT.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|A lot of people get very deep in there reviews.  I am generally not one of those types, especially for books and movies.  I loved the trilogy as a whole, but this was my least favorite book by far.  I felt like I had to force myself to finish it, and then the ending sort of deflated.
B009RI4FRU|5.0|I really, really liked this Wes Anderson film. I am a fan of the director but his last few films hadn't had the same level of charm for me, especially Darjeeling Limited. However, he really puts together a great movie this time around, getting excellent performances out of all of his actors and actresses. Highly recommended. Also, I normally hate child actors with a passion but these two did really excellent jobs since, it being a Wes Anderson film, they weren't asked to be extremely melodramatic.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I GOT THIS APP CUASE I SAW THE VID AND IT LOOKED SO COOL! coolncoxlxlx Col cool coolcnn. cool coll
B000FCKGPC|4.0|Very good book and very well written.  I did not rate the fifth star as I thought a few of the characters met their demise too early.  It almost felt like Mr. Martin was in a rush to get rid of them so that he could move on to writing something else.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is so fun, it is way better than the first one. the graphics are amazing and there are about more particles and things you can do
B009RH9HDS|3.0|I think this is a sturdy case and it protects the Kindle.  I like how it rotates to watch vertically or horizontally.  I was looking forward to the hand strap to hold while reading.  But, this is where I see a problem.  I have had my Kindle for one month. I have had the case for about 2 weeks.  The Kindle has a screen protector on, but the strap has left gray/black marks on the screen exactly where the hand strap hits the screen when you close the case.  Do not notice too much on dark backgrounds, but you see it on white backgrounds.  It doesn't wipe or clean off of the screen protector.  I am considering returning this case and going without the hand strap.
B009GX6600|5.0|The cast, the story lines, everything!  Didn't start watching this until Season Four reruns - but am hooked now.  Can't miss an episode!! At least it is a non-fattening & totally legal addiction!!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Playing on the original Kindle Fire. Love the original and TR2 is its equal or better. Graphics are bright and more detailed. Rolling up-and-down paths affect jumps, mine car a tricky new skill to learn, new system for resurrection, and advancement in part via levels.  Achievements spoon fed to you in sequence of sorts so it is possible to already get a certain high score, but need to do it again when the achievement actually gets racked for your pleasure in advancing to the next level. Have to hit &quot;Home&quot; to quit the game. Haven't investigated this, but a few hours later the game is not listed as a still running app.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|The country estate setting is so awesome, the period costumes are great, the characters are so fun to watch - flaws and all!  I know I would have been a kitchen maid back then, but is fun to dream I was one of the Crawley daughters!!
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Great easy reading book. Straight forward account. Liked the insight of there training, equipment used and the team work of these men. Great read!!
B0083Z614S|5.0|I loved this story! It was so great that I couldn't put the book down! So Awesome I loved it
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this is a fun game and I never want to stop playing it. 101 games has so many games you never get bourd.
B008IYR2BA|5.0|Read any review of season 6 of Dexter and you'll hear that it's lost its magic. Personally, I was skeptical that any season could be better than season 4. But eight episodes in, this season gets great. It has a giant twist that I was ashamed of myself for not predicting -- but that made it great! I was happy to watch all the episodes in a row, too, since the season finale ends on a moment that would have been DEVASTATING to have to wait months to see resolve. All in all, fantastic acting as usual, and a characteristically depraved story arc.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I loved this book. I could not put it down! I recommended the book to several friends, whom enjoyed it just as much!
0307278255|5.0|Jhumpa Lahiri is a gift to us all. This book is beautiful. There is very little more I can say. Please read it.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|I like this app a lot. But it doesn't like my kindle. 30 mins. I played it but when I logged out of the out of the game it wouldn't turn on and it kept crashing every time I played it.
B005LAII6C|3.0|I thought the moral of the story was appropriate with all the bullying going on in schools.  I was reading other reviews about the gay references, and I had no idea what they were talking about.  You mean the part at the end where the attractive jock isn't into the blonde chick because he has a boyfriend?  This is 2013 people, your kids are eventually going to find out what homosexuality is.<br /><br />I bought the movie instead of renting it for the 3D aspect...I didn't see any 3D effects.  Even with the glasses off, the screen was similar to a regular blu-ray.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|Compared with other Facebook apps on smartphones,this provides the most fluid interface I have experienced. Picture quality is very good as well.
B009CPE424|5.0|My daughter and I laughed over and over!  She has already watched it several times!  Was easy to download and play
B007TNQ7EY|5.0|This game is the best game out for the kindle fire It takes 150 MB it's worth deleting a few unwanted games + it's worth the $ 6.99
B0026P3G12|5.0|What can I say, its Susan Boyle. See her amazing audition on YouTube's Britains Got Talent and the rest is history.
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|Fantastic, hilarious, everyone will love this at book club kinda book. I can't wait to watch Mean Girls and discuss this book with my girlfriends.
159562015X|5.0|I've been using StrengthsFinder for years and recently switched to 2.0. It's a great product. Same StrengthsFinder assessment for a lower price. It really helps me deliver great coaching value through Semper Vita Institute.
0307592731|3.0|Bought for the GF for Christmas, she read it over the course of a few days. When she was done, she said it was alright. Nothing really ground breaking.
B003F9G8B8|5.0|Very enjoyable. It gave an excellent look at racism, how to handle changing times with the hope for change towards a better future.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|When my friend first recommended this series to me thought, (and said), \\"a show about zombies? That's ridculous, I'm not into that kInd of thing.\\" then I saw Season one was on Netflix, so I watched one episode while I was waiting for one of my children to be done with an activity. I was hooked! I showed it to my husband and he's hooked as well.  The show is well done, it's not cheesey, there are surprises around every corner. The characters are well done and played as well. It's also very frightening, I have nightmares every time I watch an episode, but I can't get enough! I can't wait for the season to start back up so I can get my \\"fix\\"!
B005CA4SJW|5.0|This is a good show.If you enjoy this type of genre,you will enjoy this tv program a great deal.It is well written,and well acted.The make-up work is fantastic.I have watched many movies about zombies in my life.The flesh-eating zombie idea came from the black and white film from 1968 called,'The Night Of The Living Dead\\",which became a cult classic.The music was creepy,too.I was 6 years old when i saw it. Me,my brother,and my mom still talk about this movie.None of us can enter into,or pass by a cemetery without thinking about this film.I am almost 50,and from all the films i have seen about this subject matter,i am glad to see someone create an actual tv show (with a story) about flesh-eating zombies.It's an excellent show,and it is well worth following from the beginning...it only gets better...and better...watch it.5 stars.
B008VPC9WS|1.0|It does not includes the listening part!<br />When you arrive to the listening part, the icons don't work! I reported it, and they said it was a problem with the supplier.
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|Like i said,it just keeps on getting better.There are some that say this season was kind of slow.Some said too much talking,not enough action,but i disagree...i think the inside story was good.It continued to allow the audience to inter-connect with what was happening between the characters.It's an excellent show.I enjoy it very much.It is midway through the 3rd season now,and there is more action...the show comes back on Sun.,Feb. the 10th...i can't wait...love it,man! WATCH IT!!!(there will be a season 4)
B0052ZQMLO|5.0|[[ASIN:B0052ZQMLO Collins Concise German-English Dictionary (Collins Concise German Dictionary) (German Edition)]]<br /><br />Hello Everyone!<br /><br />I am not going to review the quality of the dictionary although I will try my best to explain how I made it work on my Kindle - my model is Kindle 2 generation model starting with B002... and my firmware was 2.3.<br /><br />I tried for several hours standard procedure to no avail: download, transfer to 'Documents' folder, select default dictionary in menu and nothing - frustration all the way. I also tried to upgrade the firmware to 2.58 (available on Amazon website) but I came across another problem: the update option was greyed out - somehow my Kindle couldn't recognize update file in the root directory.<br /><br />I have finally tried the following procedure and it worked like a charm - you can follow the steps at your own discretion:<br /><br />1. Back up all documents you have on your Kindle (books, blogs, music, audio files etc.) to your PC/laptop<br />2. Download most recent firmware for your Kindle and leave it on your PC for now<br />3. Select 'Restore to factory defaults' on your Kindle menu - please note this will wipe out your Kindle completely!! all books and files will be gone - your Kindle will revert to 'brand new' state<br />4. After restore is complete, transfer most recent firmware to root directory and update the Kindle (Home - Menu - Settings - Menu - Update Kindle) - this will take several minutes - be patient!<br />5. After Kindle's final reboot is complete, transfer the Collins dictionary to \\"Documents' folder on your Kindle<br />6. Transfer German books and retrieve translation when you place cursor next to the word you wish to look up.<br /><br />Simple as that! - couple of notes:<br />a. there is no need to select 'default dictionary' - Kindle recognizes book's language (stored in book's metadata) and will use appropriate dictionary available on your Kindle<br />b. It happens on occasion,that book's metadata field for language is either blank or incorrectly programmed and the dictionary is not automatically trigegered. In this case download software called Calibre E-Book Management and edit book's metadata: one of the fields is called 'Language' - make sure it is correctly programmed to desired language.<br /><br />Those are my $0.02 and I hope I can help some of fellow readers!<br /><br />Cheers!<br /><br />Chris
B002UNMW7O|3.0|The sequel to the Boondock Saints movie is not as good,but it is not bad.It is pretty fair,actually.If you like Sean Patrick Flanery,and Norman Reedus,you will be ok with this movie.It is vastly better than some of the other films they've appeared in...believe me...and for the ladies,they both will appear in a shower scene...(yes,indeed).
B0070Y46UY|5.0|I have both seen the movie and am now reading this charming book for a second time.  It is one of those pleasures that can be enjoyed the first time and savored with a second reading.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This was a great book and an easy read. I can't wait for the movie! Makes you want to read the next.
B0085A9HXS|5.0|The Raid Redemption is a masterpiece of destruction, action, and face smashing. I'm sure many Bontans died to make this wonderful, yet terrifying, movie.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Awesome app! I'm not a gamer so that says a lot!  Very realistic and a lot of things to do. Easy to get the hang of. Goals are reached while having fun. I would recommend My Horse to anyone, especially animal lovers
B008BGNMZU|5.0|I misspelled the word foreplay into my amazon search menu and came across this. It wasn't what I was looking for, but I'm happy I found it. Wonderful music although it isn't ideal for foreplay.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I could just keep reading without any intent to stop! What a wonderful trilogy. I wish there were more!! Latest, baby!
B0026IBXBO|3.0|This book was bought from the &#34;New&#34; category but the cover had some scratches and tears on it. I like to collect books so not overly pleased with this purchase.
B003ODIZL6|3.0|This book was plain boring i dis not and will never enjoy it<br />Please do not read this book. Ok?
075640407X|5.0|This book was in great condition as if I freshly pulled it off the shelf in the store! Very happy!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Such a good read wish I hadn't read the books so quickly.  Really is an amazing trilogy. I could read them over and over again.
B004SIIBGU|2.0|I'm very disappointed in this app.  It's difficult to load and is not worth even being free.  There's really no point in having this on my KF.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game. Is the best one I ever played yet it is so much fun it's addicting. It's amazing awesome<br /><br />Awesome game
B007VUCAVO|4.0|I like the battery app as you can immediately tell the percentage of power remaining on your device.  Stick with the free one as there is not much difference in the free and the one you buy.
B005LJKEXS|5.0|I purchased 2 of these cables to allow me to move my printers to a more convenient location in my office. One is connected to a USB to parallel port printer adapter for my HP 450C plotter and the other is connected to my Epson 1400 ink jet. I was initially concerned that the plotter would have a problem with this active extension however this wasn't an issue and they both worked great. The quality of manufacturing is very good and the price was quite reasonable. The fit on the primary printer cable was a little tight but that was perfect for my application since I needed to route the cables behind some bookcases and I would normally have to tape the connectors together to keep from pulling them apart during installation. I am very happy with this purchase.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|The racketeer was an enjoyable read (as are most of John Grishams' novels) however, not one of his best. Seems he had a deadline to meet & cranked out The Racketeer. I will always be a Grisham fan & look forward to his next work.
0307730697|5.0|If you're looking for a story about how tough Navy Seals are or how brutal BUD/S training is, then this isn't your book. If instead, you're looking for a book about redemption, grace, passion and determination, then you need look no further.<br /><br />Books about Navy Seals, while enjoyable, have become somewhat predictable. They usually start with someone showing up for BUD/S training and realizing that they might be in way over their heads. The story follows their journey through training and finally into the field. This story is different, though. This story begins with Adam Brown's childhood and follows him right into years of drug addiction and felonies. It doesn't stop there, though, because it continues on as he accepts Christ, joins the Navy and becomes a SEAL operator with the top SEAL team. It follows him as he gets married, has kids and builds a family that he endures. It follows him as he uses every opportunity given to him to love others and spread the message of the Gospel.<br /><br />When you start a book like this, knowing that at the end, the main character will die there is a determination not to get too emotionally attached. I really tried to guard myself knowing that the end of the story wasn't going to change. It didn't work. By the final pages where his last mission is described, his funeral recounted and the new lives of his wife and children described, I was sobbing. This man was truly a hero. Not a hero because he was a highly trained special ops soldier but a hero because of how he loved his Lord, his family, his friends, his country and anyone that needed help.<br /><br />This book will touch your heart, encourage your soul and give you hope. It is about a true American hero who waits for us in Heaven when we go Home.
0316228532|4.0|enjoyed this title...always feel it is somewhat hard to get involved with the English point of view in books, but found the plot to be believeable...I cried when two of the characters had sad endings...loved the intertwinging of the adult characters and the juveniles...sometimes it hard to do the right thing and it can be the youngest one who knows the right way.
0525958002|5.0|I am an extremely slow reader and I loved the book so much I just couldn't put it down. I finished the book in a month which for me is really fast. I was surprised how honest John was in the book.I've loved Duran Duran forever and I didn't know half the stuff that was in the book. A member of my family is an alcoholic and it helped me understand the disease better.
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|loved this book...impressed by the way a person can be abused and still be that same little girl grown up with all the goodness that in found in innocency....found the book easy to read and would recommend this title to others...wish the author much happiness in her current and future life.
B000053VAZ|5.0|I think Johnny Depp is excellent in this movie. Its so funny and cleverly made and thoroughly enjoyed the movie.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|loved the quick time between ordering and receiving this product..enjoyed the great price...I read many titles on my Kindle and was needing this product quickly as I was in the middle of a title...would order from this source again..
B009YU62H2|5.0|Not that it should be a surprised with this lead singer, but this is another great album.  Every thing he produces seems to be great.
B001K3K5MO|3.0|people from Wisconsin will love this movie cause it's chock full of cheese..with lines like &#34;gentlemen...good luck gentlemen&#34; how can you go wrong.
B0099G3I96|4.0|Not as good as their past work, but still a good album.  The sound seems a little more influenced by Gwen Stefani's pop work than the older albums.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|Martin is able to bring alot ( and kill off a lot ) of characters to life through his writings. He better write book 6 soon.
B00A12VW86|3.0|I found the Uno Dos Tre set to be a little bit disappointing.  It seems like the use foul language for no other reason than because they can.  The music doesn't seem to be anything near as ground breaking and awesome as their last two albums.
B0095ZMMCK|3.0|Clancy's other Jack Ryan novels go into a lot more detail. This seems to just skim the surface. How much of this is actually Clancy's work?
B009B50QOU|3.0|I found the Uno Dos Tre set to be a little bit disappointing.  It seems like the use foul language for no other reason than because they can.  The music doesn't seem to be anything near as ground breaking and awesome as their last two albums.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Imangi did another great job making a sequel to the original temple run. There are great new features like the forest and mine cave and ziplines. The price for characters has also been reduced, which is great since there are only 3 buyable characters(4 in all) Overall this is a great sequel that everyone should try since its free!
B00AH34AUQ|4.0|I found the Uno Dos Tre set to be a little bit disappointing.  It seems like the use foul language for no other reason than because they can.  The music doesn't seem to be anything near as ground breaking and awesome as their last two albums.<br /><br />This one was the best of the three, sounding a lot more like their recent work.
B009K0P10K|5.0|Great show, but the first episode of season two ran a bit slow.  As far as ordering and setting up my wii to the tv that took two evenings of on-line chatting.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is a great game. It never lags and its fun. I love it.all of the 1 star people are wrong.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I was mezmerized by the detail and beauty of Downton Abbey's decor and the attire of the characters.  The story broadened my understanding of the persona necessary for both the privledged and the servants to survive in that situation.  Amazing, to think how all persons living within the boundaries of the estate were a community that ultimately served and sacrificed for the estate.
B0095ZMMCK|4.0|You can tell that it is not typical Tom Clancy, but it is good regardless.  It did have a bit different ending than I expected.  It was one of those books that I really didn't want to put down until I was finished, but I do have other things to do besides reading a book.  I would recommend it.  It would help if you had a working knowledge of the players however, so it shouldn't be the first book that you read that has the Ryan family and the Clark family involved.  All in all, a good read.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Excellent book.  Would recommend highly. Although only over the age of 18 years old. Loved it so much have told many friends about it.
B007BFSYMS|4.0|the sounds are pretty decent though there isn't much selection. its nice that it works in the background too all in all, a good FAOTD.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I highly recommend this game to people who liked temple run. The graphics are way better and the game is more challenging. I'm y opinion, this game is awesome. I can not say it any other way.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I loved temple run and I really love this one! you have to watch out for the boost after 2500 coins because it just makes you lose coins you are saving up.
B005VPRET4|4.0|but I am still giving it four stars because I find it very gender biased to make a Cafe set only for girls. I got this for my son as he loves anything to do with cooking. It's not like only girls run cafes! you need to make a set for boys too. Better still, make a neutral one so both girls and boys can use it.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Forget the movie. This book is so much more. This is literature (don't let that scare you) that teens and parents can share in their discussions about violence in today's world and the permanent changes in persons who live with the violence. Be sure to read the whole trilogy together. Dinner conversations (yes- you can put down the iPhone at dinner) will never be the same.
B00992CF6W|5.0|the game is soo fun but i cant get it to play on my kinld frie  i love it soooo much
B00B2V66VS|3.0|I can not get coins because I can not move my device to the side I have a kindle fire 2nd edition.
B004BSFC6Y|5.0|Adorable, wonderful for new born babies!  Babies love to look at their feel and the lady bug and butterfly are adorable.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|After seeing an older movie version and the musical, this book fills in the blank spaces and gives a more human and moral portrayal of the misery of the peoples and a love that most Christians could and should follow.
B004BSFC46|5.0|Wrist rattles, what could be better.  So cute and colorful, baby will love it!  Again I love the butterfly and lady bug.
B0091REZMW|3.0|just started playing and it has been entertaining so far.  it seems like there is a lot to do when you start opening rooms. I hats it when you have to go in the rooms when theynare dark
B005DN7W4G|5.0|First the leads are excellent... it is difficult to maintain credibility when dealing with an end of the world American government... realness or feel. They do.<br />I have seen it many times and think the writing top notch. There are problems... one is why the traffic jam at the end of the movie... tracking this big rock should have provided exact information about where to be and where not to be if it hit.<br /><br />Still with movies like 2001 and the Old version of the Day the Earth Stood Still, on another level, each in their own sub genre... still this is in the second high tier with say another great sci Fiction, Contact. A little dated now that our government has lost all leadership in the world gained through... an assumption of good intent and so on... so Deep Impact on that level is a sad reminder of a more naive time when being an American was a matter of pride.
B0018QOIXU|5.0|21 was great. 19 is even better. I cannot wait for Adele 22. Her songs touched me on so many levels.
B001F12J48|2.0|We love this movie, so we wanted to buy a 3D version for our new tv. This is the old 3D, that requires the red and blue glasses(included). The movie made us dizzy and the effects were terrible. The movie can be watched in 2D mode, which is the reason for 2 stars. Movie is watchable, but certainly not in 3D mode. I bought the newer, blu-ray / 3D combo pack, and it is excellent. In short, this particular dvd is good for 2D, bad for 3D.
B008UFUOH6|5.0|Her music is amazing. Going solo works for her. I have a fan for many years. Please, record another album soon.
B005G5PPGS|5.0|The movie was very good, but the book was fantastic.  It is a great behind the scenes look of what went on in the Oakland A's GM's office in 2002.
B000001Y79|5.0|All their albums are must haves. This one complete my No Doubt collection to enjoy on my MP3 player and on my computer.
B001375PI6|4.0|If you have never read LeCarre then this a great book to start with.  This is a spy story written by a man who was a spy.  He doesn't drive a car loaded down with ejector seats and missiles.  It's gritty and makes you realize how strong of a person it takes to do that kind of work.  It's a very good read.
0142419400|5.0|I love everything about this book.  The characters, the setting, the plot.  Everything is so perfect.  I was sad when it ended because I wanted more time with the characters.  I had come to love them so much.  This is one of my favorite recent books.
0743277708|5.0|What a great book.  It has everything, adventure, romance, evil villains!  Highly recommend to anyone, not just kids.  I was 23 and I probably understood it more than if I was a kid.
B009439HEY|5.0|Dear Genesis Gurus,<br /><br />Buy this, period !<br /><br />Coming from a man that thinks Fly On The Windshield and Broadway Melody catalyze a littany of thought about Gabriels' perception of society and accompanied by pure progressive musical gorgeousness, please accept my praise and adoration for this beautiful faithful to the period, facelift of some of the best prog ever bestowed upon us. (disclaimer, I am completely agnostic when it comes to TLLDOB message).<br /><br />Take a fantastic journey through some of the best of the best Genesis songs, recorded very well by todays audio fidelity standards, with eclectic twists to the original works and quite faithful to the original arrangements.<br /><br />The above statement applies to the majority of the reworks with the exception of Neal Morses attempt at Hogweed. LOts of respect for Neals' work but felt to far out of the pedigree for continuity of the compilation.<br /><br />all 7 parts - 22 min and 58 secs Suppers Ready is phenominal and displays some nice guitar playing by Hackett.<br /><br />With all that this masterwork offers, I would pay anything for it !!!<br /><br />Steve, if you're reading, thank-you, this hit the spot. Keep going while you still have guys like me in their fifties that are obsessed with Genesis and will pay handsomely for more products like this. How about an immersion box that includes some hi quality video along with other trinkets and goodies ??
0374214913|3.0|I was very excited about this book at the beginning.  The idea of an old used book store open 24 hours in San Francisco with interesting quirky characters coming in very infrequently.  Then, the mix-in of current technology stuff like Google smarties doing amazing things.  Add in Sloan's excellent ability to craft interesting, fun sentences, and looked like a great book to come.<br /><br />I made it through, but it turned out to be just an ok book.  There's a lot of fantasy which I can endure if there are other interesting things.  But unfortunately the structure of the book is pretty straightforward, the plot predictable, and the writing standard albeit with good sentences.  I guess I've come to need/expect something challenging, some offbeat ideas or concepts, to pull me through.  I'm surprised that this book isn't categorized for young adult, because that feels like its niche.<br /><br />Finally, the technology issues were over the top unbelievable.  Douglas Coupland is sort of similar but I think better at getting at the heart of the technology culture and workings.  But I think in Penumbra Sloan also has what I see as Coupland's main failing which is a lack of underlying soul and emotion.  There wasn't enough depth to the characters or their relationships.  Maybe this was an attempt at reflecting our current technology-driven culture, but ultimately it doesn't lead to a completely satisfying novel.
B00192KCQ0|5.0|I don't mean they didn't do some good stuff, but this CD is FULL of great songs.  It has grown on me the more I listen to it.  I've had it for 2 years, and it is still on my regular play list.  BTW, you must also purchase the 5-song CD called &#34;Beyond Magnetic.&#34;  Could have made a 2 disc CD and you'd not find filler.<br />&#34;For all reflections look the same, in the shine of the midnight revolver!!!!&#34;<br />For anyone thinkind Met is done riffing old school, this CD will change your mind.  There's stuff on here I can't play even with TAB.  Plus, James does it while singing!!!
B00AS1Q93S|1.0|Tom Cruise as Jack Reacher...a breathtakingly absurd notion, equivalent to Clint Eastwood playing Liberace's lover (re the new movie about Liberace's life featuring Matt Damon).  I've read a few of the  Jack Reacher books and found them to be generally entertaining diversions from the ills of the day, escapist capers to kill time, a quick read on a rainy day with some good scotch or whiskey, or while lying on a chaise lounge on the beach, drinking margaritas and taking a peek or two at the occasional honey bun ambling along.  Now I don't wish to disparage Mr Cruise's talents (enjoyed his performance in \\"A Few Good Men and \\"The Firm\\"), but my god, has the man no sense of shame or good taste?  What was he thinking or smoking; has he been so deluded by Scientology drivel that he believes he's capable of playing any role he wants?  And for Lee Child, the author of the Reacher books, to say that he had no problem with Mr Cruise playing Reacher despite the physical differences as \\"Reacher is a force of nature\\" is bewildering.  I beg to differ.  Jimmy Cagney, another short actor, was a force naturale in \\"White Heat,\\" one of his best gangster movies.  Mr Cruise as Jack Reacher is incomprehensible.  Who, then, is Mr Reacher's doppelganger in real life?  Liam Neeson, although older than Reacher, would have been excellent in the role.  Absent Mr Neeson, my choice would be Dolph Lundgren.  See the character:  Reacher has a menacing physicality and a gruff, taciturn temperament.  Highly intelligent, he's a man with quick instincts and a wary, foreboding nature that keeps him on edge, quietly alert to danger and very capable of handling himself in bad situations.  Trouble comes to him as naturally as a river flowing to the sea.  But he's ready for anything, and we enjoy the visceral experience of a hero taking down the bad guys.  Neeson or Lundgren, the only two men who are right for the role.
B003XQRZ7E|5.0|I love this CD.  Great band, great songs, very good sounding CD.  Just don't make many like this any more.
B00B2V66VS|1.0|I couldn't find out how to exit. I don't know if I'm missing it or there's no way to. I don't like leaving games running in the background so I had to give it one star. I deleted it after the first time I played because of the exiting problem. Other than that it's a good game.
B008BO61BE|5.0|This album is mandatory for anyone who THINKS they like hard rock. This album rocks today as well as then.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Battery HD always tells me when my battery is getting low. l get a warning at 15% and another at 5% so I never run out of battery power before recharging.Great way of keeping me informed.
B008G8SFGO|4.0|Sorry Gene and Paul, I didn't love this.  It's OK.  Has some good hooks and great sound, but the songs aren't as good.  Still a must-see live in concert, though.
B00006GO9Q|5.0|\\"Not giving it 5 stars would only hurt the critics who really appreciate the craft and genius that is Miles. Even if not hailed as highly as B_____ Brew, this is still a solid effort for what would be the Miles sound soon enough. It all works, like the artwork suggests, as an album to live by its capabilities to be for a film noir. The mood is there and it is about as loose a later work of his you can get. Not particularly meant for the first-time listener but for anyone (including Squarepusher fans) who isn't afraid of something bold and unique.\\"
B00ATSBIIG|5.0|They are so relaxing if I feel a little nervous puzzles are just the way to go for me<br /><br />You should buy this game the graphics are great too
B005GSZZ1A|2.0|Subject would have made an interesting magazine article but did not have enough depth to warrant writing a book. on it.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|this is a more challenging temple run but is addicting and worth the effort! it is like the first with a few exiting changes! get the first if u don't have it!
B00B2V66VS|4.0|I am a big admirer of this game. I had played the original [[ASIN:B0086700CM Temple Run]] on my kindle fire even before it was released on Amazon Appstore by side-loading it from Google play. I am pleased to see that Amazon now launches top apps like these almost as same as Google Play and there is no need now to do those extra hacks.<br /><br />Temple Run 2 works beautifully on my original Kindle Fire and Samsung Galaxy tab 10.1. The graphics are in par with the original [[ASIN:B0086700CM Temple Run]] and in some respects better than the original. Game play is similar with some new twists. It is a very fast paced game and once you start playing it I am positive that you will never stop playing.<br /><br />This is a early release and I am sure the developers at Imangi Studios, LLC will take user feedback and improve the game as it goes but feedback from users is essential to make this game even better.<br /><br />Firstly, Please allow users to have an 'exit' button. I understand it does not really matter in Android OS environment but paranoid users will be concerned if you cannot exit the game. Especially for Kindles which does not have a dedicated hardware 'home' button it is better to have a exit button in the application.<br /><br />Secondly, The graphics setting to 'high' on Kindle Fire original is jittery (Could be a limitation due to lack of horsepower) to process high quality graphics but setting it to the lowest quality setting makes the game run smooth as the original.<br /><br />EDIT: Jan 27, 2013: - Lowering the ratings due to some bugs...<br />-------------------<br />I have been playing this game on kindle fire for past several days and I notice that there are few bugs!<br /><br />1 - What happens that it manifests itself when you are trying to activate the \\"Save Me\\" feature the game hangs and quits to the home screen of the Kindle Fire.<br />2 - When you get certain upgrade capable power-ups it seems that you have got them during the run but they do not appear in the menu anymore<br />3 - There is some serious lag at times as if the game is trying to load something in the background and the game jitters and not smooth for a while<br />4 - Some of the goodies and power-ups are placed in some serious heights that seems physically impossible to acheive at random (May be intentional??)<br />5 - The Indiana Jones style sequence is next to impossible to play at times as you have to tilt the device to the extreme and cannot see what is ahead of you. The developer must try to lower the speed in the caves or make the game more enjoyable in those sequences.<br /><br />Having said, I am taking away one star (combined for all the bugs) out of the review as this still version 1.0 and if the bugs gets fixed I will edit my review and give all five start.<br /><br />Nevertheless still is a 'free' fantastic game just like the original.<br /><br />Cheers!t appear in the menu anymore<br />3 - There is some serious lag at times as if the game is trying to load something in the background and the game jitters and not smooth for a while<br />4 - Some of the goodies and power-ups are placed in some serious heights that seems physically impossible to acheive at random (May be intentional??)<br />5 - The Indiana Jones style sequence is next to impossible to play at times as you have to tilt the device to the extreme and cannot see what is ahead of you.

0307951529|5.0|The $100 start up simplifies starting up. And in doing this, helps turn wantraprenuers into entrepreneuers. Motivational and a great resource!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I love the classics or mostly anything on PBS.  I guess I am intrigued by British culture.  I enjoyed the 6 wives of Henry the VIII, Miss Marple stories and especially Upstairs Downstairs.  I would recommend these types of movies to anyone who enjoys this type.  Thank you, KK
B006ATJXQW|5.0|Very exciting didn't want to put it down. Would recommend it strongly.  Want to read maze runner now. Loved it.
0545265355|5.0|the books were awesome. i had never read them before the first movie came out but the books are so much better than the movie. so glad i bought them. well worth it.
B009CPJHY4|5.0|I bought this movie after seeing it on Netflix.  I plan to share it subtly with my grown children, introducing them, in an entertaining way, to the challenges of aging.
B0028MBKVG|5.0|This is a great book for anyone remotely interested I running. I could hardly put it down.  Would definitely recommend it.
B008HK3XOU|5.0|This cover is functional and aesthetically pleasing.  It seems well made and of a nice quality.  I am happy with my purchase.
B00004CYS9|1.0|The blu ray cannot be played through a dvd and states on the screen that a setting in the dvd player is wrong when all others have worked
B003JTHXOK|4.0|I read this in anticipation of the movie.  It was a perfectly sweet romance. Just right for a rainy day read.

B0076DCT2G|4.0|Typical Demille. Even minor characters come to life. Demille's John Corey could even be toned down a bit but I suppose being scared sort of doubles his sarcasm and wise cracks. If you've have ever had the misfortune to spend even one day in Yemen ...you would find Demille's geo, cultural, political portrayal scary accurate! Good reading. I loved it.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|the grafics are ok but way is there when a hill comes ever time there's a drop off. I do like the one huge monkey instead of the three or four monkeys
B00A9X9TIW|3.0|A fair science fiction movie with a novel plot. A bit slow moving to start, but the premise developes quickly after that.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|It's a good game. Kind of addictive and keeps you wanting to do more. I just wish there is an easier way to get energy.
1594203059|3.0|Very informative, but very dry.  I had to write a book report about this selection, though I learned many new things, I was glad to be done with it.
B005K0HDGE|4.0|Definitely an interesting concept.  I liked this one much better than some of King's other recent works.  I had a hard time putting it down.
0321701763|5.0|This is the fourth book I have purchased for the Adobe Suite of software applications, each has been very useful for learning the app.  I highly recommend each of them.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|What an ending to the series, left me interested until the very end. Sad it's only three books, but that's just enough.
B0054VVRBQ|5.0|I love this device, it is fast, I can leave it inserted in the Express Card slot if I choose to and it works so well.  I highly recommend it, just remember to download the driver before using.
B009JBZH54|3.0|I received these disks quickly and they play fine. My only complaint, which is substantial, is that the entire case was covered with packing tape that can never be removed (when I try the illustrations are ripped from the box). I understand it isn't coming in the original wrapper but simply wraping this in some plastic or putting it in another box would have prevented the case from being ruined.
B0067AC5KA|5.0|Highly recommend it . It is a great trilogy and the movies just as good. Theses stories have so much twists and turns
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is awesome and its FREE and I recommend people getting this game. This game is better than the first temple run. It's fun and more challenging.
B007B6VOG0|5.0|I bought Fun's 'Some Nights' album on a whim after hearing their song 'We are Young' on the radio, and it was totally worth the $4.  There's no dead weight to be found here!  Every song is catchy, and leaves you with that warm fuzzy feeling in your innards.  You'll definitely be hitting the replay button multiple times with this one.
B00A1XIXM8|4.0|Great album, personally its the best I've heard since Process of Belief, for some reason none of their albums after that evoked the same level of thought/emotion their predecessors had. But I feel True North has changed that, if your a Bad Religion fan most certainly don't hesitate to purchase this CD, and even if your not I'm confident if you have even the smallest affinity for rock/punk music you'll appreciate this album.
B005EPKS8A|5.0|news from hollywood:<br /><br />following newest allegations, john belushi survived his overdosing<br />on speedball (a mix from heroine and cocaine) and is in perfectly fine<br />shape, living a rather comfortable life in switzerland.<br />he's alleged to have told reporters that that he needed the time-out in<br />order to start out again all over, only this time a little slower, and,<br />not like like before going any whatsoever short distance in the fast<br />lane. furthermore he said that he had used the time for founding a band<br />and touring - albeit incognito- europe. naming the band the original<br />brothers, he himself used the noms de plume \\"jake b. curley\\", \\"john<br />player\\" and \\"dee jay pat\\", following his mood and a desire to go<br />unrecognized, currently only emplying the \\"dee jay pat\\" pseudonyme owing<br />to feeling especially comfortable.<br />his brother elwood took the name of \\"helmood blues\\", putting up<br />residence in australia and not being unproductive over the course of the<br />last five years either.<br /><br />as a matter of course he accompanied his brother toring europe, doing<br />quite a few gigs together just like in the good ole days. all along,<br />they enjoyed european audiences just as much as comments saying they<br />were a more than formidable \\"cover\\" of the all star band, nobody<br />recognising them for who they were. all the more ironic must see<br />m the band name chosen, the original brothers.<br /><br />helmood supported his brother in any posssible way, taking the audiences<br />by his unmistakable dance style (which some thought to be epileptic<br />seizures) as well as his laconic ways; mostly though by his hohner<br />blues harp play, of which he is said to own twenty models.<br /><br />meanwhile helmood had also been working intensively on a solo project by<br />the name \\"flash and the pain\\". starting out as pure persiflage of pop<br />music, helmood claims it to have no whatsoever artistic pretense, its<br />sole intent being an entertainment to audiences, going by the motto of<br />the king of comedy-charles chaplin to the unknowing: \\"a day without a<br />laugh is a day wasted. smile trough your fear an sorrow!\\" the only thing<br />put on in this are the hats. Asked about naminig the band, helmood<br />didn't give an further comment than that it's had its origins in the<br />commonwealth countries. smiling impishly, he then descended an imaginary<br />stairwell saying \\" pfwow, i still look sharp if you like nick cave, 1989<br />was a wonderful year and i got the blues. google this!\\".<br /><br />he used two album covers of his solo projects to prepare the comeback of<br />his brother by appearing singly seated next to the drum set on the cover<br />of the first album, while on that of the last ( est. pub. sep 2012) his<br />brother is literally in the picture again.<br /><br />concerning the contents of the script, only so much is known that the<br />band of brother is underway again in the name of the lord, although this<br />time in europe and not by the cause of securing an orphanage but world<br />peace, no less.<br /><br />further along the plot we meet the illegitimate father of jake blues,<br />wild bill kelso of \\"1941\\" fame acquaintancing his later wife after the<br />normandy landings. the marriage isn't one of longevity though. going<br />along with an american tank driver, she conceives a second son two years<br />later and decides on emigration to the united states. Settling in<br />chicago, she can't keep the boys with her and puts them in an orphanage.<br /><br />Being there the brothers bring up the question of what their lives would<br />have been like being brought up in europe, the matter gaing ever more<br />importance. their orphanage \\"stepfather\\" curtis advises them to seek<br />counsel in church. Attending a mass, the two are encompassed by a ray of<br />light obviously from heaven, lifting them up, while they hear a meek<br />voice saying:\\" my boys, it's me, your father. everything will be fine. i<br />have an assignment for you: mind the peace in the world, the world<br />peace\\", finally pulling them upwards and out of sight.<br /><br />they find find themselves again in front of a school, looking at a class<br />schedule labeled \\"stundenplan kw3 1986 einzelhandel IV\\"<br />helmood quotes: \\"this feels like the philadelphia project.\\"<br />his brother glances at him and muses: \\" you mean, you imagine it fells<br />like that?\\"<br />helmood curtly replies: \\"yup.\\"<br /><br />not being in command of the language, it doesn't mean a thing to them.<br />they turn around watching the rear of a car, namely an audi 200 turbo<br />with a sticker saying \\"120 with eyes open better than 50 with a<br />mind shut\\", only they don't understand this just the same. they shrug, jake<br />glancing at his watch saying: \\"it's almost 9. we need to go to work.\\" they<br />enter the car and blast off, tyres screeching. helmood though was deeply<br />immersed in his thoughts. whoever knew him good enough also knew his<br />life was running like a film in his eyes. he thought of the scripts of<br />\\"popsicle iced lolly 9\\", \\"prince valiant\\" or \\"westwards\\". driving trough a<br />rainbow, jake said: \\"judy, i miss you so badly\\", helmood repliying: \\"say<br />something, liza, but speak leiser minelli!\\". jake gave a \\"yo man\\",<br />starting to sing \\"judy, judy, don't be moody, judy, judy, don't be blue.<br />judy, judy, baby, baby, judy, judy, i love you.\\" the audi suddenly<br />turned into a chevy impala and disappeared into the tyrolean entrance<br />of the arlberg tunnel, the sun beginning to set above the mountain.<br /><br />the mission continues. they're under way once more in the name of the<br />lord. concerning world peace.y boys, it's me, your father. everything will be fine. i<br />have an assignment for you: mind the peace in the world, the world<br />peace\\", finally pulling them upwards and out of sight.<br /><br />they find find themselves again in front of a school, looking at a class<br />schedule labeled \\"stundenplan kw3 1986 einzelhandel IV\\"<br />helmood quotes: \\"this feels like the philadelphia project.\\"<br />his brother glances at him and muses: \\" you mean, you imagine it fells<br />like that?\\"<br />helmood curtly replies: \\"yup.\\"<br /><br />not being in command of the language, it doesn't mean a thing to them.<br />they turn around watching the rear of a car, namely an audi 200 turbo<br />with a sticker saying \\"120 with eyes open better than 50 with a<br />mind shut\\", only they don't understand this just the same. they shrug, jake<br />glancing at his watch saying: \\"it's almost 9. we need to go to work.\\" they<br />enter the car and blast off, tyres screeching. helmood though was deeply<br />immersed in his thoughts. whoever knew him good enough also knew his<br />life was running like a film in his eyes. he thought of the scripts of<br />\\"popsicle iced lolly 9\\", \\"prince valiant\\" or \\"westwards\\". driving trough a<br />rainbow, jake said: \\"judy, i miss you so badly\\", helmood repliying: \\"say<br />something, liza, but speak leiser minelli!\\". jake gave a \\"yo man\\",<br />starting to sing \\"judy, judy, don't be moody, judy, judy, don't be blue.<br />judy, judy, baby, baby, judy, judy, i love you.\\" the audi suddenly<br />turned into a chevy impala and disappeared into the tyrolean entrance<br />of the arlberg tunnel, the sun beginning to set above the mountain.<br /><br />the mission continues. they're under way once more in the name of the<br />lord. concerning world peace.

B007NQ06S0|2.0|The movie itself was fairly entertaining. It wouldn't win any awards granted, but I purchased it primarily for the special effects to test out my new blu ray player.<br /><br />I'm primarily rating this movie so low out of aggravation with the blu ray disc setup. First off, I had to sit through the previews without being able to skip ahead to the title menu. Not a big deal on the first time around, but I shouldn't have to sit through them every time I load up the disc. If I ever decide to watch it again, my first thought will probably be \\"Do I want to sit through all those previews again?\\" It is possible to fast forward through these one by one, but again that is a pain.<br /><br />The other complaint I have is the lack of chapters in the menu. That means skipping ahead is nowhere near as easy as it should be. Lots of fast fowarding through previous scenes. It brought me back to the days of VHS.
B003UBTX6S|4.0|I loved the first book of the series... the second one left something to be desired, but it's not like I can just skip to the third.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love rumple run two  beacause I is really fun and enjoying. and it is a fun game but could you guys put a assassin in there for 2000 coins
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|Why does Jared Padalecki get top billing?<br />Jensen Ackles is clearly the star.<br />Sam has girly hair. Its not 'hip' at all... just looks like woman's hair.
B007RI56NY|5.0|I like train a lot, this album is their greatest on so far. thanks amazon cloud player for the great music.
B0051UP5NQ|4.0|There are just a few things to keep in mind before you get this product.  It keeps asking if I want to install other fonts.  I tell it I am fine with the free stuff, but that doesn't make it happy.  haha.  Also, you are limited on the PowerPoints as in creating.  So, be aware of that.  The excel part is also limited in what it can do.  So, with that in mind, for a &#34;on the go&#34; software, it is does okay.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|This is so soulful and gutsy, sometimes even a little raw. Adele has such a big voice that never seems to reach its limits but the emotion of the music says she trying. I have had to take it out of the car as I was listening to not much else and I'm not normally like that. There's a reason Adele has done the best Bond song in years and this album shows it not a fluke.
B004JZBGWI|5.0|This app is easy to use.  I love the colorcoding ability that it gives.  I would and have suggested this one a lot.  Definately worth a look at.
B0054N73EY|2.0|As a Chili Peppers fan, this was a bit of a disappointment. It seemed like more of the same, a collection of B side tracks from other albums. While the Chilis have been hit and before, this one seems like there are no new ideas.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|This app is okay for what it does.  I've had some issues with it connecting to FB, even after going through the steps they put in the manuel.  Customer Service isn't the greatest either.  Yes, it is stocked with volunteers, but their answers were just a copy paste from what I found on Google.  So, if you have issues you may be waiting awhile to get a response (one email I sent over a few months ago was never answered) or the answer you get is just what you'd find on the net.<br /><br />That aside, it is worth the download.  I won't delete it and I do recommend it to others.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|I would recommend this book to friends. It has a good story line and keeps your interest all the way through. I liked it so much that I looked online to purchase more books by Colleen Hoover.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|I like this program because it really does what it says it will do.  I upgraded from free to paid to get rid of the adds, but it was worth the price.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|This book was emotional on many levels for me. For anyone who has lost someone, longed for their return, and suffered from severe depression- this book will \\"get you\\" or more precisely, you will \\"get it\\". It leaves you thinking, and ruminating deeply about many aspects of life, love lost, and \\"silver linings\\" to come. I highly recommend it.
B0063GORYU|3.0|I don't like all the advertisements that come with this program.  Over all for what it is, it is okay, but if you don't like ads being pushed onto your device, then just walk on past this one.
1449415881|4.0|A nice-to-have in my fabric-lined box at work...the various cartoons are a few years old, but they always wind up being relevant.<br />I know people have complained about the combined Sat/Sun with only one strip; I agree, thus is loses a star.<br />So there, Scott Adams...give us our Sunday strip back in the calendar!
B00884GR0W|1.0|This app needs insurance for the amount of time it crashes.  I would start and then it would crash.  All I can say is good bye, see ya later and &#34;unstall&#34;.
B004ZA9HB4|4.0|Got this app from Amazon FAOTD even though we don't own a Smart TV that would be compatible with the app.  My research also revealed it does *not* interface with the Roku (which we do have).  Got the app anyhow since there is good content that I can just watch on my Droid X.  A few days later, I installed the Twonky Beam server on my PC & the Twonky Beam app on my Droid X (which is compatible with Roku).  One day when I was fiddling around with both apps (iMediaShare and Twonky Beam), I opened iMediaShare on my Droid X, closed it and then opened Twonky Beam.  Imagine my surprise when I went into the devices in Twonky Beam and iMediaShare for Droid X was listed!  I can now \\"Beam\\" anything on iMediaShare to my old tube TV, by way of my Roku box, using Twonky Beam!  So happy I decided to go ahead & get iMediaShare!
B00ATDOVNK|3.0|Downloaded from Amazon free game of the day but it's definitely not free. Looks to be a great game but $5 bucks???<br />I turn this type of game in no time....$5 bucks seem overpriced to me.
B001B3MCQK|5.0|The first song I heard from Rodriguez was Sugar Man. Great song! Few months later documentary came out about Rodriguez, I watched it and was compelled to check out the rest of his stuff. I wish I had had this album growing up! I've had to make myself not listen to it so much. Worth a listen totally!
0743496736|1.0|The author used over and over and over the most annoying and obnoxious phrases. This made it so difficult to get through this boring novel. Terms you will see multiple times:<br />drew in her breath; (how close to someone do you need to be to see them draw in a breath!)<br />Padded down the hallway: ( once or twice you could have substituted walked down hallway)<br />She pinched the bridge of her nose: ( what does this even mean, who does that!!??)<br />He blinked at her: ( after the first 5 times reading this it got beyond boring), people blink all the time so this makes no sense<br />Grinned at her/him: prepare to read this at least 50 times. Beyond annoying and obnoxious
B0099G3I96|2.0|There is nothing endearing or addictive about this CD. Love the band, but this is a miss. Do not DL it.
B0058VW36U|5.0|This is a fun game  - my grandchildren love it - the price is just perfect too - I highly recommend it
B00A12VW86|4.0|Good CD, I am still unsure about this whole 3 CD thing, but if the price is right, I would say to DL this album if you are a GD fan.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|This game is such fun!!  It can keep you busy for hours if you want.  My grandchildren think its the best and you can't beat free!!!
B007MDB548|3.0|Cute movie, little kids will love this, but from the adult watching this movie, not the most endearing one you will see.
B0063GORYU|2.0|this is not that much fun.  Its only one suit and actually its boring.  I now know why it was free
B005LAIHZY|3.0|Beautiful movie, great voice acting, but I did not think the plot or characters were as endearing as the other Pixar films. If Disney had made this, I would have thought, fair enough (and I am a huge Disney fan), but coming from Pixar, I was disappointed. On the reverse, Disney's Wreck It Ralph was wonderful and seemed more like a Pixar movie.
B0063IH60K|4.0|This is a fun game.  I play it when I just want to relax and not put alot of thought into anything.
B005TBN3EU|4.0|I did not see this movie in the theaters after hearing bad reviews, but I cracked up a lot while watching it as a rental, I'd recommend it!
B0000047EC|5.0|I'm absolutely thrilled to once again have this CD in my possession.  The high musicianship of Charlie and Pat is in full swing throughout the disc.  IThe disc arrived after being on order for about 10 days and was packaged very well.
B009VB97EY|3.0|Can't argue with the visuals, but the plot went from fairly easy going and predictable to a strange 'let's create drama' twist that did not flow well with the movie.
B003MC5N28|5.0|Not only is this an enticing novel, the kindle edition is easy to navigate and bookmark. The extra content for book clubs is a great asset to help younger readers' comprehension.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love minecraft I haven't gotten this yet I only createdthis because down below the only reason there are under 4 star ratings is that un patient people don't know that its not going to have all the features of x box or Pc they just need to shut up and get over it. thank you for reading.
B00B2V66VS|1.0|I hate this app it wont even let me play and even if it does I cant move it just sends me to the left and cant do anything.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I love this version so much better than  my Android version. It is clear, easy to navigate and allows me to use all of the features.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|love this game! it is great to pass the time! all though way easier than the coin game in real life lol
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Large display. Easy to read and use keys. Has the mathematical functions that I use most. Uses very little memory.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|Completely hooks you from the start.  I'm very pleased with the series so far and would highly recommend it to those looking for a good one.
B004SUWR2C|1.0|It required more download to operate. I dont want something that is going to eat up more of my Kindle memory.
B000021Y77|5.0|Loved this movie when I first saw it and decided it should become part of my permanent video library. Highly recommended for those who love non-stop action. This movie gallops from start to finish; never pausing an instant.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I have this on my laptop and android. I dont get dressed for the day until this app has been consulted. It keeps me informed all day, I make plans based on this information.
B008HT4FUW|5.0|I love love love this show. I bought the DVD for my uncle for christmas and he thoroughly enjoyed it. It is a great show for everyone!
031236198X|5.0|Best book I ever had to buy for a class. Enjoyed the easy to read text, characters and plot of the story.
B001FSDOZO|5.0|My son loves this group so I bought this CD and a couple of others by Nickelback  for him. He told me to give it a 5 star rating so that's what I'm doing. I guess it all depends what age group you're in and I'm way past the younger generation. LOL.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I have this app on my android as well and I love it. Easy to use, read and enjoy.  I highly recommmend it to others.
B002ZG98C8|3.0|Expected a little more action from Seagal but like most of his later movies, he's just a name on the cover. Guess he should quit while he's ahead. As a former fan, I realize now that his hayday is over. He should be smart and just retire instead making us spend our money on his worthless movies.
B003VR5PPY|4.0|\\"Game\\" is more of a technicality with this title. The puzzles are really almost condescendingly easy, especially when you consider that the NPCs spoonfeed you most of the answers. This is exacerbated by the fact that ALL the characters are apparent brainiacs of one form or another, and with all the cursing, sexual innuendo, blood, and graphically described gore, this is CLEARLY not a child's game, and they seem to EXPECT you are smart, and yet I didn't manage to find a single puzzle where I wasn't mentally scolding the NPCs for refusing to let me figure it out on my own.<br /><br />HOWEVER, that being said, playing this title is an experience I am glad to have had, and the story reeled me in and I couldn't put it down! I HAD to uncover the truth! It's the first time in a long time, that the story of a game really genuinely kept me guessing and on the edge of my seat. The script of this game is clearly incredibly well thought out. Thought provoking, and often humorous, but also really genuinely mysterious.<br /><br />This title is HEAVILY story based. You arguably spend more time reading than in any actual gameplay. But again, this is less about the puzzles...they're really almost secondary...and more about the choices you make and what twists and turns they will take you through the story, getting multiple vantage points and uncovering intriguing backstories. If you love a good BOOK, this is a game you will likely enjoy. If you have some sort of strange aversion to reading, then you should probably pass this one up.
B00001ZWTT|5.0|Really delightful movie, with good performances and funny lines. Loved Kenneth Branagh in the antagonist role! Definitely worth the money....
B003ODIZL6|1.0|You have to surf through pages for way too long on a kindle when you much easier could look it up later it'd be nice if it had a search function but otherwise it blows donkey clock for pennies
B007B6VOG0|5.0|This album is fun, all the songs are great, and the singing is top notch! Seriously though, buy the whole album, the popular songs are great but I like some of the other ones even better. Also check out their album &#34;Aim and Ignite&#34;.
B009AMALLM|2.0|\\"Ever since he's got here crazy things have been happening.\\" Five years after Katie (Featherston) and her son Hunter disappear a new family moves into their house. When the mother gets hurt the neighbors offer to take care of her son. Soon after he moves in strange things begin to happen around the house. I have to admit that I did like the first one, it really creeped me out. The second one I thought was only scary because I was thinking of the first one. The third one was better and again creeped me out. When the third one was over I thought that was a good place to end the series. After watching this one I still think the third one was a good place to end the series. Everything that made the first 3 scary seemed to be missing or not well done in this movie. Instead of everything happening without the main people knowing in this movie things just seemed to fall all the time. To me that isn't as scary. If you watched the other ones I'm sure you will watch this too but lower your expectations. Overall, to me this was more annoying then scary. I give it a C.
B009G8GRX6|5.0|I was a bit worried that this album might not be the Muse I know and love, but alas it is still great and has the Muse feel to it. Still, it doesn't sound the same as all their stuff, but thats a good thing in my opinion.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|Now have The Weather Channel to take along on your Kindle Fire. I can be sitting on the patio checking my email & see if that dark cloud that suddenly appears has any significance.
B004PVKFR8|5.0|I do want to say I was listening to this before &#34;Sail&#34; got really popular. In all seriousness this album contains a great many good songs, like &#34;Jump on my Shoulders&#34; is a personal favorite.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|One of my most favorite ways to keep up with family and friends and see pictures of newest family members or what they are celebrating. Just a great way to find old friends.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|So I kinda disliked temple runner but this goes beyond coolness and its freaking free I'm so glad I found this game
B004QX07G4|5.0|Great read with a lot of very funny chapters! Ellen's humorous personality comes out with each page turned. You will want to read it out loud to those around you.
B00AQMSJI2|4.0|Fungame. Easy to play  you  can win  gold to expand your holdings  but it  is qiicker. To. Buy. Jewels  to. Expand your. Land  only thing is land  gets more costly  as  you get more
B008MG1E4A|4.0|Typical story line of events leading up to the mission.  Writing is of the same as what we see in this genre, patriotic, wants payback, anf full of testosterone.  This is what keeps us safe at night.  God Bless 'em.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Wonderfully written. Totally captivating throughout. Highly recommended. I found myself laughing and crying and feeling for the characters. Wish the book didn't end.
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|The Help was an awesome movie. Very much worth the money. It was well thought out and funny while yet teaching lessons to the viewers.
B000S9WLBY|3.0|This attempted to show a more personal side to the actual battle, I think it did ok given the amount of crew/actors involved.
B005ORVMT2|5.0|All the correct CDs/DVDs were in there correct cases. Already a huge Rush fan there is nothing but good things to say about the music. I was expecting to wait another week but the shipment arrived 5 days after placing my order.
145210655X|5.0|This is a very creative and funny book for any Star Wars fan who has a son.  It's a quick read; great as a gift or coffee table book.

B003VDY7XE|5.0|I absolutely love this show! It is absolutely worth checking out if syfy and mystery is definitely worth checking out.
B004WPYNY8|5.0|Call them what you will: Johnny-come-latelys, sell-outs, Kamelot (et al) clones...whatever! But one thing is for certain about Symphony X: They are easily the best progressive/symphonic power metal band to emerge from America's east coast (as they formed in Middletown, New Jersey). And they might lose out to God Forbid and Burnt By The Sun in the riff category, but they are also, hands down, that state's best bunch of guitar soloists. All of which make Symphony X an exceptional progressive symphonic/power metal band, and easily one of the genre's premier groups hanging around in the 21st Century.<br /><br />Nothing better illustrates any of these points than 2011's \\"Iconoclast.\\" This eighth full-length record from S.X. is fat with great riffs, even greater solos, deft drumming, and fairly pronounced, bubbling bass lines. Also, frontman Russell Allen cannot be forgotten, as he chips in with Dio-versus-Dianno-esque singing. And he also proves himself to be quite the exceptional lyricist. This album revolves around a \\"Year Zero\\"-era Nine Inch Nails-influenced theme (not a mood, but a \\"theme\\"), dealing with the complex conceptual notion that humanity is putting way too much stock into their computer-bred technology, and that doing so might one day lead to mankind's demise. True, it is a bit of a long shot, but it is definitely still a very interesting one. (And perhaps what is most interesting about this storyline is that, even though it might be a little far-fetched, it is nevertheless a fairly believable one.)<br /><br />An Iron Maiden-ish galloping beat, Ronnie James-sounding vocals, and fiery, busy, chugging riffs combine to form the sprawling title track, and make it a propulsive opening blast off. Yes, the only occasional symphonic-sounding backing element is retained, here, but they are few and far between; this is mostly a Judas Priest-y speed metal-lite tune. \\"Iconoclast\\" uncorks an epically beautiful, winding, keyboard-esque-sounding guitar solo, too, and is also further highlighted by really memorable and anthemic choruses. All told, it all makes for one whopper of an opening epic, even if, at nearly eleven whole minutes in length, it is one that is a little too long. This is especially true when considering that \\"The End Of Innocence\\" is only half-as-long as the above-mentioned opener, but packs-in an equal-amount of punch. Indeed, it is five-and-a-half minutes of rhythmically galloping guitar hooks and especially terrific, epically ripping and sweeping melodic soloing.<br /><br />Despite featuring a Dio-era Black Sabbath-esque song title, \\"Dehumanized\\" actually plays more like an early Pantera homage, even if it does retain Symphony X's usual knack for soaring melodic choruses and symphonic music-like backing keyboard flourishes. Suffice it to say, it ultimately comes across sounding like a \\"Cowboys From Hell\\"-era b-side, and it is even complete with a pyrotechnic, \\"Dimebag\\" Darrell-inspired shredding solo! Next up, \\"Bastards Of The Machine\\" is backed by an inventive, catchy, Nevermore-like hoof-pounding gallop, and more exceptional soloing. (Guitarist Michael Romeo uncorks a deliciously melodic solo, and bassist Michael Lepond even gets in on the action, tossing in an excellent -- if, albeit, suspiciously Dragonforce-esque -- bass solo.)<br /><br />Skipping ahead a track, \\"Children Of A Faceless God\\" is another particularly air-guitar-able -- if more mid-tempo and restrained -- track that finds the Romeo seemingly locked in a duel with himself, spitting out gobs of ultra tasty, crunchy riffs and wailing, piercing solos. Disc one then closes with \\"When All Is Lost,\\" a sprawling, expansive, nine-plus-minute long set closer that is rich with gorgeously gentle strings, cool piano keys, and nicely melodical guitar solos that are -- dare I say, it? -- worthy of Dream Theater's John Petrucci, himself!<br /><br />Disc two begins with a brisk and catchy speed metal number, \\"Electric Messiah,\\" which is backed by muscular, Maiden-derived chug and churn riffing. Then, following the Judas Priest-meets-Queensryche approach taken on \\"Prometheus (I Am Alive),\\" the band chooses to drop one of the biggest highlights of either disc. \\"Light Up The Night\\" is almost pure thrash metal through and through, and is overflowing with blistering chainsaw riffing, and stomping double-kick drums. Still more blistering harmonic guitar solos rip the air, here, as well. The last notable track on \\"Iconoclast\\" is \\"The Lords Of Chaos,\\" which chooses to opt for an approach very similar to the above-described \\"Dehumanized,\\" by playing like another Pantera throwback. Indeed, this song's hooky, crunchy, staccato chugging sounds not unlike that band's 1992 classic hit-single, \\"Walk.\\"<br /><br />As you can see, \\"Iconoclast\\" is an epically epic effort from Symphony X, a band that seems to only get better with age. True, the record is a bit too close to the overlong side of the line for comfort, and is also slightly dragged down by a couple of mostly -- if not completely -- unremarkable tracks (see \\"Heretic\\" and \\"Reign In Madness\\"). But the New Jersey natives are able to overcome these shortcomings in time to produce a fairly darn excellent, overall, record, and cement their status as one of the progressive/symphonic power metal genre's leading acts.en-derived chug and churn riffing.

B008HK3XU4|4.0|I really like this Kindle cover.  It is a great color (purple).It is a simple design and is very convenient to use.  The only thing I wish it had is a place for a stylus.  It is my fault for not thinking of that initially  before I purchased the cover.  I still really like the cover.
B005LAIH4A|5.0|Kids and adults here love it. Bought for a great price; one of those amazon specials. Animation is top notch.
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|I like to play this game. This game has its value, if anything, it kills some time and doesnt have any bugs so far.
B008L40Q7E|5.0|love love love love LOVED it. fast paced, snappy, of course I couldn't get the image of daniel craig out of my head in this story, but I'm not complaining!
B002QNLP2G|3.0|This movie would have been more enjoyable if we had subtitles available for it.  My wife and I were struggling to try to understand what the actors were saying.  Amazon should offer subtitles for all of it movies.
B009ARMS1I|1.0|Glee has delved into stealing songs from other artists without crediting them. Hearing \\"Baby Got Back\\" from the recent episode when it's exactly the same as Jonathan Coulton's version makes me cringe. I will never buy or watch an episode of Glee.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|This is my son's favorite app so far. The controls are very easy to use and the graphics are cool.
B009SJ3GUK|3.0|You spoiled us with season 1 because it was so good. It had lots of interesting characters and side stories with exciting twists and turns. .I expected more of the same from season 2 but it was a disappointment and more sad than scary. Love that Evan Peters though!
B003Y2XI8W|4.0|I love the voice of the lead singer.  Sometimes he sounds like Michael Hutchens of INXS; other times he sounds like the Bee Gees.  Great variety of styles among the songs.
B00B2V66VS|2.0|I will make a suggestion don't put the details in the menu on high, it shuts down the app and you can't get on it again. otherwise this app is pretty good
B006VFLIYK|1.0|Very depressing.  I wish i hadn't bought it.  I only got 1/4 of the way through and quit.  Not one of his better books and I have read a lot of them.
B004UA8D2S|5.0|Wonderful movie, not what I was expecting the first time that i watched it, but was pleasantly surprised. Would recommend to anyone that enjoys a good thriller. Shipping was earlier that quoted and was in good condition.
B00ATSBIIG|5.0|I love this game! Have really enjoyed the challenges and the graphics &amp; colors are beautiful!  Would definitely recommend it!
B0084IG8TM|5.0|Saw the movie, wen out the next day and bought all the books, have been addicted ever since. Great movie, not a chick flick but great action and storyline. Highly recommend!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Wonderful! Best game to have been created from classic carnival games. GameCircus, thank you very much for a great game.
B009YP9L7U|3.0|It's was a good story but bland all the way thru.  Quick read if u can't find anything could have been a short story to be honest
B00B2V66VS|5.0|When I saw: Temple Run 2, I kinda thought that this was a big joke... the original is always better... right?? I have to say, this is the one exception. This is so much better than the original Temple Run. The original was very laggy and the graphics got boring after a while. In Temple Run 2, they seem to have fixed all of this. It's truly a beautiful sequel.
B0066W1AZK|4.0|It is  a very good product  for a person who understands the Chess. To make it the best  you may add one more support&#34;hint for the move&#34;  for  the user while playing against the computer.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Please take it from a girl. This game is radical!!!! I love the new map, powers,the people, and well, EVERYTHING!!!  IF U GET THIS GAME U WILL BE PLEASED AND U WILL NOT REGRET IT!
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game really is great. All the negative reviews are from people who haven't even played it because it's not free.
B0028IDXDS|5.0|this is the cutest thing I have ever seen, not only does it work but my 9 week old just loves it and can hold it on his chest at night and doe not loose it, when it does finally fall out it stays right next to him so he does not awake because he feels it fall.  just love love love it........
B00122OQ3W|5.0|Year of the Cat<br /><br />Have always loved this album. Had the vinyl years ago. This is definitely a classic worth owning. Like almost every song
0061122416|5.0|This book starts slow and seems to be a little too much on the touchy-feely-contrived-metaphor side... but keep going. I read it before bed instead of surfing. It was a quick read and now I see what the fuss was about. I'll recommend it to friends and family. It brought me back into an awareness of the oneness of the universe that I hadn't felt for a very long time.
B0047Y17P2|5.0|Really liked this book and was very happy to see that Mickey Haller is considering bagging the defense of criminals and now sees the sense in prosecuting their butts.  Can't wait for the next movie as well.....hope they have Mathew Maconnehy locked in for all the Lincoln Lawyer movies to come...:)
B00AE9UYJ4|4.0|Okay let's get one thing out of the way, I am not going to tell you about how I beat the game on the first try or anything else like that. The simple fact is, this game is good. An update is in order or perhaps a second game? My only complaint is that The Slender Man is only ever behind you. Sometimes I don't even turn around the whole game and only run into him towards the end if at all. Otherwise I really enjoy this game and highly recommend it. P.s. I didn't beat it my first try. :(
0525478817|5.0|As an adult male I can easily say this book has universal acclaim. It's deeply emotional, powerful and perfectly written.
B006UW4OB8|5.0|I've used eWallet since I had a PDA which used Pocket PC.  It's a great program for keeping personal informtion and passwords at the tip of my finger and now that it's available for Android devices that also sync with my PC, I like it even better.  I'm very pleased with it.
0880796863|5.0|Though I didn't buy them for any sort of divination I can say that the look and feel of these cards are worth every penny
B007BFSYMS|5.0|Uses for this are endless.  It's very apparent a lot of thought went into the making of this. Highly recommended this one!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Very interactive and educational, it teaches you about the simple things. Just love it, FUN! The graphics are great, the competitions are exciting, and I love rewarding her with a treat after!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I like Temple Run 2 quite a bit. It takes a lot of what made the first great, sprinkles in some of the good parts of Brave without the bow shooting and the glitching, and lets you play on new areas. The graphics are nice, there are new obstacles, and the way the power meter works is pretty cool. It has the unlockable characters, upgradeable power-ups, and some new unlockables as well. you also have rewards for getting to specific levels of quests and unlocking specific people.<br /><br />The one thing I do miss are resurrection wings, because the game runs off of gems to continue and I liked having to earn coins instead of finding the random gem here and there. Some of the areas are a lot more picky, like running narrow walkways, and the giant monkey behind you makes stumbling worse because you cannot see well with it following you. Those are just some minor things, however, because the game is great and looks nice.
B006RXQ8RI|3.0|my friends convinced me to watch this film. I have to say, I don't ever want to see another Tarantino film again.<br /><br />That's right Quinton, Your overabundance of gore and stupidity doesn't make up for the weak plot lines and poor storytelling.<br /><br />Solid &#34;Meh&#34; where I'd rather watch something more thought provoking or interesting.
B001NLKT60|4.0|Excellent reading.  I cannot wait to read the final installment.<br />This girl is messed up but determined to get revenge.<br />Izzybill@optonline
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I was waiting for it to come out after I saw my friend playing it on his iPod. So wen it came out I quickly got it. Temple Run 2 is waaaaaaay better than the original. In TR2 there r more power ups, mine carts, and a freaking HUGE monkey. There r only 4 characters so I hope they will fix this in the next update. I have 1 word 4 this game. BEASTLY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B000VZYPB4|5.0|This is the best sitcom I have seen in a long time. We are definitely enjoying the show. We watch a little every night.
B00AFEY354|5.0|Some films just leave an imprint, an extraordinary piece of art that engages, engulfs and embraces the most vulnerable portion of the soul.
B006P4FBUE|5.0|This is just fun to play and has a good variety of songs.  I would recommend this this if you just want to play around.
B008ASLK8A|5.0|If you like the first one then I think you would like the second one. I would recommend this film for sure.
1401923127|5.0|Science spelled out for the non scientific-minded; easy to understand in layman's terms.  Bruce Lipton reveals the inner workings of cellular biology that will change your perspective of how you view the construction of your biological self, and of your profound connection to the biological planet!
B00APUYWYA|1.0|It was a waste of time and money. it's the film that you get the best scenes from the trailer.
B005COO1X6|4.0|I have always been an SK fan, but most of my favorites are his older works. This was much like his older works. A little too short (and quick) for me, but undeniably good.
B003O86FMW|4.0|I gave this as a Christmas gift and subsequently bought the remaining to complete the set. I would recommend this book.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|love it<br /> this game works and doesn't freeze it is very interactive and I love it. this game is great for any age.

B00AYDC3CG|4.0|This was a cute film that was, for the most part, enjoyable. I would recommend it to friends and family.
B0009FU0ZQ|4.0|I now have almost the complete collection of this series and feel that it is a good add to my collection.
B009RI4FRU|4.0|Well, to say the least, it was a weird film. Not that weird is bad, I'm weird, so there. If you are into weird, try it.
B000OVLBFS|4.0|I have watched a few of these movies in the past and felt they would be a good add on in my collection.
B000EOTTV8|3.0|I needed a different view to understand a friends perspective. I needed to see through his eyes. This film helped.
B0000AFX64|5.0|I have enjoyed this series for a very long time and am happy to say that this purchase helped me complete my collection
B009YN2M7S|5.0|SAFE HAVEN<br />I AM WAITING TO SEE THE MOVIE..AS USUAL NICHOLAS SPARKS DID NOT DISAPPOINT ME..LOOK FORWARD TO READING OTHER BOOKS I HAVE READ MOST  I THINMK I HAVE NOT READ 3 OTHERAS.
B000M53GM2|5.0|Very good show. I am a collector of different movie and TV series. This movie is very good and helps me to bring my collection up to date.
B006LSZECO|3.0|I found this book started out slow, then got great, and by the end I felt let down again.  Personally I felt it didn't live up to the hype but it was enjoyable enough to start and finish.
B0091W0JPE|5.0|Casablanca is my all time favorite movie. Everytime its been on TV I have watched it. I love the song &#34;As Time Goes by&#34;. I know it would probably be classified as dopey, but it reminds me of a time gone by, when movies were actually good and people were so much more kinder to each other.The violence is at a minimum. I prefer the &#34;Good Ole Days&#34;.<br />Donna Powell
B00AREIAI8|1.0|It's a really cool game, however it's a major resource hog. It took forever to download. I'm running it on a Kindle Fire and it ran once. Toward the end of my game session it started stuttering. The next time I opened it up, it never completed its boot-up. It stalled and refused to run after my initial game play. It cold definitely use some streamlining.
B007BFSYMS|5.0|I got this app as a free app of the day, and so far so good. Love the ocean waves, relaxes the heck out of me. Hopefully the alarm does job. Have had the app stop a couple of times, but I hope that doesn't happen with my alarm set.
B009VB7P6G|5.0|The best of all of them.  Better than many an adult movie that I have seen.  Such a great story.  Ingenious  and inventive.
B0042RUMIW|5.0|We very much enjoy Sting and have several of his concerts.  This one was just as good as the others in our library.
B00A9C3RB8|5.0|Absolutely fantastic.  This one really gives up to a marriage that is full of love and life at any age.  We really liked it.
B001B51B9M|4.0|Always enjoy this musical.  Like the actors, music and story.  If you like musicals, you may like this one.  Shirley Jones and Robert Preston are good in this.
B006UG90RM|5.0|Didn't expect a lot from this effort. I knew the 'Tattoo' track had hit the airwaves, but I had yet to make it's acquaintence. I decided to risk buying the CD anyway. My initial reaction to hearing the first track was, \\"bummer\\"...<br />Obviously, 'Tattoo' is a well intentioned sell-out to the mega-production co.s request to get something on the airwaves quickly. Way more pop than power. Not horrible, but definitely a far cry from what the band has produced to date.<br />So, as a serious skeptic re. band reunion material anyway, I set myself up for an ugly experience with the rest of the cd.<br /><br />Blown away! From the 2nd track to the last, I was sent back to power-cord nirvana, getting a long overdue dose of the VH magic - the same hard punch of grinding party rock that kicked it all off for the band back in the 70's. The stuff I know and love. Bravo! The alignment of sound - that mix of Roth's raw vocal howling with the driving force of the VH bros. pounding jams is unmistakable. If you have a VH collection among your rock albums, you'll find that this one fits in nicely.
B002VRNR1Y|5.0|love this movie. I even have the image on the cover tattooed on my leg.  All work and no play makes this guy a dull boy.
B004DM0UII|5.0|These people with their precious privacy sound way too paranoid. It's just a simple radio, what's the big deal! Jeez. It rarely crashes, keeps me entertained &amp; has a wide variety of stations. The ONLY drawback is that it's a battery drainer.
B007XHWROK|4.0|I want to remind back to when `Boyfriend' was released.  Previous to that, I had only heard Bieber songs in about ten second segments on the radio before turning them off.  He just wasn't my style.  I never begrudged him or made fun of him, and I noticed talent (he has a voice) but I didn't care to listen to him.  `Boyfriend' was inescapable.  It was everywhere.  Turn on the TV and they were featuring it and every radio station was playing it in unison.  I hated it (still do).  Listening to Bieber explain this \\"cool sexy rap thing\\" he was trying out was painful.  It doesn't work and it sounds almost desperate for attention or acceptance.  It's sad, because the moments in the song where he actually sings (with the acoustic guitar breakdown) is nice.  That said, the song itself is terrible.<br /><br />But Bieber fans, relax, I'm getting to the good part of the review.<br /><br />So, with that I was determined to avoid this guy as best I could.  Then I heard `As Long As You Love Me'.  Yes, once again Bieber was everywhere and his song was getting so much attention it was unavoidable.  That being said; `As Long As You Love Me' was a good song!  Sure, it isn't smart or original or lyrically intriguing (\\"you could be my Destiny's Child\\") but the beat is sick and Justin's vocals are smooth and the overall effect is fun and fresh and just grabs your attention.  For the kind of music it is, it works.  After hearing `Beauty and a Beat' I decided that I wanted to hear the rest of the album.  I wasn't sure if I was going to be rewarded or not, but I knew that it couldn't hurt.<br /><br />This album is pretty good!<br /><br />It's weird to say that I feel like a teenager when listening to Bieber, but I mean that in a different sense than you might expect.  Sure, I feel young because of the fact that Bieber's fanbase consists of teenage girls, but there is something nostalgic about Bieber's album here.  Parts of this album remind me of the boybands I listened to when I was twelve; the Backstreet Boys in particular.  Some tracks have such a slick R&B vibe to them that I recall the first time I heard `Candy Rain' and I'm in love.  Yeah, I'm digging parts of this album in a big way.<br /><br />It's not all good though.  Bieber has a tendency to whine in some of his songs.  Even the otherwise wonderful `Fall' suffers from whiney delivery on the verses (that chorus is wonderful though).  His more beat heavy tracks (the better songs on the album) are lyrically simple and so they can be deemed somewhat dumb, and his more `thoughtful' tracks are pretty cheesy in their attempt to over-depict adolescent love.  Still, as a collective album this one is hard to dislike.  With Nikki Minaj and Drake blessing specific tracks, and Bieber's willingness to explore a variety of sounds (I swear, `As Long As You Love Me' sounds like something Linkin Park would have `Re-Animated' and `Die in Your Arms' is a blissful Jackson 5 throwback) `Believe' is a very well rounded album.<br /><br />For those interested, my personal ranking:<br />1) Right Here<br />2) As Long As You Love Me<br />3) Beauty and a Beat<br />4) Believe<br />5) Fall<br />6) Die In Your Arms<br />7) Be Alright<br />8) Take You<br />9) All Around the World<br />10) Thought of You<br />11) Catching Feelings<br />12) One Love<br />13) Boyfriend; the Backstreet Boys in particular.

B002M9WW30|5.0|I love it. Anyone who ever rooted for an underdog has to like this box set.  Get lost in Rocky's world!
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Fabulous book.well written and you have no clue where it is going. I could not put it down and did not want it to bend.
B004HD61KE|5.0|This one didn't disappoint.  It had the history and archaeological connections I just adore. This one was really hard to put down.
B008M721MS|5.0|good product easy to use easy way to stay in touch with friends and family the best way to talk to friends
B00AC8ZJ6K|5.0|I had not even realized they came out with a movie. I was expecting something a little corny, bad graphics, maybe not real true to the story line in the game. I am very happy to be proven wrong. Made me want to play the Halo 4 story line through again
B00AREIAI8|4.0|It's amusing and fun but gets boring after a little bit, and receiving gems requires too much of an individual's time.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|love that I can take notes on any of my devices and it syncs automatically so it doesn't matter which one I pickup I have what I need!
B009PU2KIQ|5.0|Love his whole CD, my favorite are black & blue, soul, You save me, outro and the life. It is definitely worth the money.
B005HSL626|5.0|this game is great keeps my mind going and going. love the speed of the game also. great for stress relief.
B007SGM084|5.0|These books were written very tastefully and beautifully.  I look forward to more from this talented author good job in marrying love and eroticism!
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|have not played this game enough. can not get to the 5th level . but if i was a bird and people was slinging things at me i would be angry to.
B000EGF0NW|4.0|If anyone picked up the book Lucky to read, you'd assume a book based on triumphs, succeeding, or just an exciting plot. This book is the complete opposite of what one would expect. As I turned the first five pages, the true hardships and experiences I read felt as if I was feeling one's torturous pain. You could instantly indicate what the memoir was going to be about. One of the reasons why I believe this is titled \\"Lucky\\" is because very few people would pick up a book called \\"Rape\\". What makes it so gripping is the detail on the first page. The constant horrific abuse keeps you held on to shuffle through the pages to see the end.  A main thematic subject that stands out throughout this book is survival. Through staring at the man who could have potentially killed her, Alice expressed her innocence to beg for survival. Alice expressed her life story and the obstacles that she faced in order to overcome her fears. Although she was a freshman in college, her innocence was present throughout the whole journey. How could anyone live normally after a tragedy like this? The thematic subject coming of age is also present because of the courage and strength Alice has to write about her experience, Although there are numerous stories of the same, this one in particular is horrendous and life changing for many. The bravery that Alice contained, with being a virgin, was the primary factor that saved her. If anyone is dealing through pain or wants to relate to a fantastic book, this one is the deepest I've yet to read.  This story sheds light on how one terrifying moment can have an everlasting impact on several and Alice still today.
B007D2XSW0|4.0|This app is just what I was needing. It works really great. I would have given it five stars, but there are a couple of little issues I have. One is that after making an edit, at times it won't keep the changes on the photo, and I end up having to redo it. The other thing is that it would be nice to be able to re-edit a part without having to undo any work after what I'm wanting to edit.  But overall, a very nice app.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|This book was a better book than any other book I have ever read. I could read this book over and over again.
B009FB3XTA|4.0|I have been a huge fan of the Twilight soundtracks, but am somewhat disappointed in this one. I don't remember any of these songs from the movie. Guess I will compair again when it comes out on DVD.
B00006I53S|4.0|Picked this up as a replacement for the 18-55 kit lens.  It's a solid lens.<br /><br />I'd love to see a 18-300 lens from Canon, but alas it doesn't exist yet.
B0041T52S6|5.0|Loved this movie. I am a big comic fan and so glad this movie was well done. I am not the biggest fan of Nick Cera either but I will say after this movie, I have changed my mind. Highly recommend for the video game/ comic geek in the bunch.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I am enjoying solitaire, it is a fast moving game and it doesn't take much time to complete the game.
B00795P4EG|5.0|I have used editing software before, but this is one fantastic piece of work.  I wish I had something like this on my desk computer.
B004SBS8LA|3.0|I like the ad-free part.  However, The section I am in is very frustrating, The level is really tough now.
B00B4804KS|3.0|what i want to say is about the marketing on 3d movies that they are great to watch  but they cost to much the way they are package on older release movies  most likely  customer already own the  blu ray o dvd version  they should have the choice of just buying the 3d version on a better cost  so they should be sold on its own
B00B2V66VS|5.0|it is awesomlee awesome because hello its temple run I am upsesed with temple run &agrave;ll day every day yippie temple run by jaylyn magruder
B000MAH5O2|3.0|As advertise. Nothing Else to Say. Why does amazon enforce so many words in a review, all we need to say it that it worked or not
B000I0QL82|5.0|I love the classic movies at Christmas and this definitely fills the bill.  It was shipped fast and was exactly as described

B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is a great game for horse lovers. It's comes with a lovely horse and different tasks . Some times I have to delete it and reload it but it's worth it and my account always comes back. IT'S A GREAT GAME.

0345803485|1.0|There are thousands of 5 star reviews and thousands of 1 star reviews, not much in between. I've known many women (and their mothers) who were captivated by this trilogy, so when my own mother scoffed at my mention of \\"Fifty Shades of Grey\\", I thought she was being a literary snob.  Apparently her book club read it as a joke and she recommended I read it too, just so I could see for myself what a horribly written book it is.  When my coworker lent me the first two books, I was so intrigued to learn what the mass hype was about and/or how awful this would be.  3 MONTHS LATER.... I have never ever had to force myself to read something for either school assignment or leisure, like I did this book.  Why did most people finish this book within a week, but it took me months?  It's been a boring, painful experience.  Not only do I thoroughly dislike every character and the repetitious, unrealistic story line, there is nothing intelligent about E.L. James' writing abilities.  I won't bother with the next two books. There is something disturbing and awkward about the subject matter being written at a young reading level. I'd rather find my old Judy Blume books if I wanted a simple read...at least it would be enjoyable.  If I hate something, it doesn't deserve a single star.
B0071MQBX0|5.0|I absolutely adored this on stage version of the Phantom of the Opera.  It was an evening well spent, highly recommend it if you are a big theatre buff.  Ramin Karimloo was wonderful as the Phantom and enjoyed the performance  by previous Phantoms and especially seeing Michael Crawford.
B0015DROBO|4.0|I rarely read &#34;Who Dun Its&#34; anymore, but this one was an exception that I read on the recommendation of my son and daughter. I liked Lisbeth, the main character. She was very unique. I could not figure out who the murder was until the end which to me makes a good mystery. I can usually guess. I have already recommended this book to others. I saw the movie first which is the order in which I should proceed.
1419553429|5.0|A must have for GMAT aspirants willing to score high..tough questions, concepts very well explained...What's more, they would return the money if you are not satisfied :)
B006BXT4TI|5.0|great music. upbeat and rockin! I love it. There isn't a track on the album that I don't like. Go get it.
B00000DHR0|5.0|This is the first CD I purchased from Celine Dion.  Love the songs on it.  Will defnitely purchased CDs from her again.
B004XDYJRU|5.0|This is a great app. I can get any and all stations. It is a little complicated to program and set up, but I am still working on it. Windows 8 is a pain to, but I'll eventually master it, just like the VCR
B0063IH60K|5.0|I like to play this game because it relaxes me<br />I enjoy playing this relaxing game<br />Thank you for giving me this game
B008I43DYU|5.0|It's large, accurate and easy to use at any time. What could possibly be wrong with that? Nothing. I highly recommend it.
B004DM0UII|5.0|love the fact that I could find the no name stations and also love the UI as well as the graphic equalizer settings.
B009M1QRM8|5.0|I can never get enough of these authors. Every page comes to life when I read them.Highly recommended.to all thriller fans.
B008GFI3QE|5.0|Not only was this a most enjoyable view of the man behind the Beatles but so revealing in the depth that he brought to music during those amazing times! What a great addition to our Beatles collection! A must for the avid Beatles Fan!
B00B2V66VS|3.0|It was good at first but it got too touchy and now I'm going to delete it because it has a terrible layout and when you die it gives the worst joke or saying ever and you hear the same one 50 times too complicated
B0055SWM08|2.0|The game was very silly and not very challenging at all. It did not hold my attention. I kept trying to play but did not like it.
B00637HXNG|5.0|WOW!!!! What can I say?... Money well spent!!! This is one the best 3D disc I have!!!!<br />(Viewed with an Oppo BD93 player and Epson 3010 projector to an impressive 120 inch diagonal screen!)
B009WO7NQO|5.0|I had never played angry birds. This game was very fun with challenging levels. I love the sound effects. I would recommend this game.
B0071R43MG|2.0|This 2 STAR review is for picture quality of this 3D Blu-ray release.  Let me start by saying I'm probably a bit more critical of picture quality than most folks.  I have an Epson 3010 projector, which I use to project my DVD's/Blu-ray's/TV on a 9 foot wide (approx 120 inch diagonal) screen.  It may not be top of the line, but projections usually look great!<br /><br />Unfortunately, I can't say the same of this disc. For the most part the resolution isn't as bad as DVD, but doesn't LOOK LIKE 1080p either... looks more like 720?!  Images are not as sharp as they could be.  Most of the time images have a little blur... even the close ups could be a touch sharper?!  There's even one very short point the image shakes on the bass beat during one (only one I noticed) track.  As far as the 3D... eh... it's ok... just ok?  Many cameras were used to shoot this concert, with what looks to be [maybe only one?] a \\"3D Steady Cam\\" (listed in the end credits) possibly used from the rear at floor level in the crowd... views shot at that position seems to be the only time 3D looks best (not great).  EVERYTHING ELSE LOOKS LIKE IT'S BEEN PROCESSED OR CONVERTED from 2D to 3D.  What a DIAPPOINTMENT!!!!!<br /><br />Some think a 3D concert helps give you the feeling you're right there at the show?...  Well, that doesn't happen here!  Could Joe use some 3D advice from the SCORPIONS?  Definitely YES!...  Not that I like to promote another item in a review, but.....  As a comparison, the Scorpion's 3D Blu-ray live concert looks outstanding!!!!  Now there's a 3D concert that DOES give you the feeling you're right there.  Looks like all cameras used for that were 3D-HD cameras.  Image and sound on the Scorpions disc will not disappoint... ALWAYS SHARP... ALWAYS ACTUAL 3D!!
B0080SZ0V8|5.0|This game offered many challenging levels. The graphics are very detailed. The mini games are great. I would recommend this game.
B004FOA84A|3.0|This is really a simplistic type of format...few locations and a TON of running around in them. The movement is a little clunky and some of few locations are only used once. The look was ok, nothing froze or went wrong on my Kindle Fire HD 8.9\\" The reason for the 3 stars, which is in itself abstract, is that there is no help. If you get stuck, you're on your own OR you have to resort to the internet walkthrough. Not fun for me. Even with the help online, I quickly realized that I would never have figured some of the puzzles, clues and their use or finished this game. For me, maybe it's more like a 1-star, but I know this game has a cult following of obviously clever folks who are able to solve the clues and I want to encourage all game makers to give us Kindle people MORE!
B00AE6SS5O|3.0|The game was not as challenging as other games. The story line was silly and juvenile. I would recommend this game for children.
B007VUA7VO|4.0|This is a great  little battery monitoring app, it's free and gives much more detailed info about your battery performance. Please be aware that this will run in the background all the time, however the default battery service does the same thing.<br />Only 4 stars b/c it at rimes &quot;cheats&quot; and takes you to the on-board battery service to give you the info you're looking for. I'd like to see this app give me simple info like is it charging or not, right there on the status screen w/o going through another section. All-in-all it's great app to dl and use, I'd recommend it.
B008JGSM6G|2.0|This game is really geared to a younger audience.  I did not find it at all challenging. However I do think it would be great for younger kids.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|Amazingly accurate and fast screen presentation. Once setup, connecting to one of my multiple home computers is a snap. Definitely a keeper!
B0073LWEXK|5.0|This is one of the best games i have ever played. The levels are very challenging. The graphics are fantastic. There are lots of twists and turns. I would highly recommend th game.
B007JM4CWY|5.0|I am shocked at how entertaining this game has been for our whole family. My 6yo kids can do the beginning Level 1 puzzles, and the adults are struggling with the Level 5-6s. Not sure why this game is FREE on iPhone but costs $4.95 for Android, but it was worth the money for us. It's addicting!
B006R8GK2Q|5.0|This is a great game with many challenging levels. The graphics are great. The mini games are challenging. I would recommend this game.
B000FCKGPC|4.0|The marginal characters can be confusing when reading on a kindle.  The index of characters is a pain to use quickly.<br /><br />I suppose this speaks more to the Kindle than the book which I enjoyed.
B004FOA84A|5.0|This game has very challenging levels. I love the graphics. The game has a great story line. The mini games are challenging. I would recommend this game.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|this game is also on the iphone and it is cooler than the first one because you go inside a mining cart in a cave
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|I liked this game but the paid version id worth the money. I loved the sound effects. The levels het more challenging.
0062183591|5.0|After buying a just released &#34;the honest truth about disonesty&#34;, I discovered that, in a few weeks it would be released in Brazil in Portuguese.<br />I highly recommend this book. I don't agree with some surveys/researches shows along the book, but, in general, the book teaches and show us some problems of human behavior.
B00A77II0U|5.0|This is the most challenging game I have played.  The story line is great. The graphics are fantastic. I would highly recommend this game.
B00ADIT8U2|4.0|I really love these types of quest puzzle games but this one seemed too easy. I felt like it was more about running around collecting items instead of figuring out how to solve puzzles. However, I did have some fun playing it and I really appreciate the fact that no more money was asked of me (like most other games now adays). Thank you for making this game but please make the next one more challenging puzzle wise and less about running around collecting items.
0765325950|5.0|So far 600 pages in  and loving it. I think this is going to be a fitting end to the tale.
B00AAX68HG|5.0|Its free (awsome) get before its 0.99 cut the rope is great game! This is bit awsomer then cut the rope... sorry for saying awsome alot!
B00797MB0O|3.0|Hmmm....what can I say? The acting was okay, the storyline wasn't my cup of tea, and the ending left a bitter taste in my mouth. I don't like to bash movies, books, authors, or artists, so that is all I will say about this movie.
B009ZXT4BY|5.0|It made my kindle lag on every game i own! Its fun but if this happens take the game off and then get its works when i do it.. and why only 15 mins?! Cool game though! Its close to minecraft also, thanks
B00AFROVQC|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book, the story is solid and the characters are likeable. I read some fellow author said this reminded them of Tolkien and J.K Rowling, well I certainly would not go that far and to me that is an insult to those great writers. I do however recommend this book to adults and young adults who are looking for a good fantasy adventure / love story. My main complaint with this book is the editing should be better from a writer who someone dared put in the same standing as Tolkien. Enjoy.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Downton Abbey is the most clever, wholesome and downright entertaining show I have seen in years. It's safe for the whole family to watch and a wonderful take on the interactions between an aristocratic family and their behind-the-scenes household. HIGHLY RECCOMMENDED.
0738727326|4.0|This deck is beautiful and gives a different take on the cards. I like the artists interpretation of the cards, they have given me a slightly different take on each of the cards. I would recommend this deck to anyone, new or experienced to the tarot.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|i love it. its awesome and fun the monkdy is way bigger this time its hard not hard i lobe kt better than temple run 2 love it!!
B004EPYZUI|5.0|this film on blu ray really helps develop the creative feel of the character's imagination evolving into something extraordinary for the human eye.  The storyline is not too difficult to follow and although it is not a happy tale, survival is the focus here and it is interesting how the characters push to survive in the tragic lives they live.
0345529057|4.0|Hoping prior reviews aren't true (re: poor binding, font size being to small, missing and or cut off pages, etc.....). Purchased the books for a true cable/TV fan of the series by the same name. Priced well in comparison to in-store buy.
B003Y5H556|4.0|entertaining story keeps you guessing throughout.  animation and color enhancement shines through on blu ray and therefore the true feeling of the film was really appreciated.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|This is a great series of stories from someone I'd never heard of until I joined Amazon. Well written, believable characters and good plot lines, more please!
B00A8ECU24|4.0|Great game! My five year old daughter and I have had a great time playing. It has been a good way to the two of us to spend time together. Not to mention the best part, it was FREE!
B008NABUU8|2.0|nice little game one big downfall.i bought this games as i did the$1.79 unlocker well the unlocker i was able to unlock 2 bridges.now says buy more coins.why unlocker a joke program gota follow along.beware.save ur money.
B00AQ3K8IU|1.0|I found it rather boring, I have not finished reading it at this time so maybe it will get better.
B0049VZ222|5.0|plain and simple - we love this stupid show<br />I do wonder how long it can go on but whatever .....we love it
B00881VLCE|3.0|I was disappointed in the size of the puzzles, the difficulty, and the content. I have other puzzle games for computer that are much better.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|This book is for every human to exam his conscience, to realize that the world is still the same and that the &#34;modern&#34; people simply are  ignorants in their rats race. I am reading this book second time ( about 20 years break ) and I am strongly  convinced that only few will be bold enough to take a look at the mirror of humans nature, which this book really is.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Excellent writing. Couldn't put it down. Turned out to be more of a love story than pornographic, A pleasant surprize!
B009VB97EY|3.0|The guys were gorgeous and loved their moves, but overall the picture was only about 3 stars.  Story line was just about what you would expect.  No surprises and I actually dozed off for a bit, so I reset it and watched the part I missed.  Didn't  miss anything.  It was a slow part of the story.  Overall tho, for the price, wasn't too bad.
B000FC1MCS|5.0|i had to read this book for school. At first i didn't know what to think of it but, i started to get into it and couldn't put it down!
B008Z9YLV2|5.0|I watched the movie and was very impressed and it was a very enjoyable movie.  Lot of twists and turns and kept you wondering what was going to happen next.  Some of course were expected.  It is a movie I would watch again.
B006KX3GXO|5.0|I love this app so much. I love all the effects it gives you and the varieties and styles. I don't really have 1 bad thing to say about it. I would definitely recommend it to anyone who likes photos , art , design, or is just creative! :)
B009186JYI|5.0|i've always liked the stones and it was great to see them in their early years.this dvd really showed it.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I thought this book was very good. I was a little disappointed that there really isn't a plot, it's more of a diary and I was unaware of that. It's defiantly a book for teenagers. I would defiantly recommend reading it.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Not bad - except for the VERY tiny ads. It would be nice if they included a &quot;Time remaining to full charge&quot; countdown.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Temple run 2 is way better. The graphics are better and and the game itself is harder. Though there are things I haven't figured out yet most of it is pretty easy to understand. The only bad thing about it is  it is very sensitive so if you want to slide somtimes it causes you to jump. I think this is a very excellent game  anyway.
B00AJMQSP0|5.0|As always. Speed and power along with melody. Awesome guitar work. It's actually somewhat exhausting to listen to. Power metal at it's best.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|Love it! Can't wait for part 2! I couldn't put this book down. It'll have you laughing,crying and cheering. BRAVO
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I saw this app n I was like OMG I need to get it!!!!? it is amazing I love it!!!!!!

B00AREIAI8|5.0|so cool i was adicted the minute i started to play you need to get this app right away the horses look so real
0307279189|5.0|Just like McDougall, I have some foot problems, problems that have been exacerbated by my mid-life decision to become a runner. Part narrative, part soap-box, this easy-to-read book had me hooked on the idea of barefoot and/or minimus running by the first few chapters. In addition to achilles pain every single morning as I step out of bed, I have found that other leg injuries seem to be popping up quite frequently. Initially I thought this problem was because I needed some \\"real\\" running shoes and since I live in Colorado a trip to the Boulder Running Co. was in order. They did the whole treadmill analysis and said I had a perfect footfall and did not need any correction, therefore a standard running shoe would work well. I bought the Adidas Pro Glide 4 and thought the wonderful cushiony feeling they provided was just what I needed. Well, now with about 400 miles on those shoes I can tell you my achilles give me more pain than ever. I also struggled to run for more than 5 miles at a time without hitting a wall. After reading Born to Run, I realize it's because I was beating my body into the ground, literally. Turns out, running in these shoes creates bad form (shame on the running shoe industry), so much so that you are forced to run heel-to-toe and to lead with your head out front. Change your posture and run with little to no shoe on and you will find that running becomes so much more enjoyable. I will never go back to running like that, I am hooked and I owe the salvation of my feet and legs to Mr. McDougall. Great read, highly recommend.<br /><br />**Update**<br />It's been a few months since I read BTR and I am now on my second pair of minimusshoes (New Balance WT10 and New Balance 1010 Trail).  Interestingly, just before Christmas I had my first real running-related injury, that had something to do with my knee and my IT band.  I believe it was caused by too much treadmill running as well as allowing the 'minimus mindset' and associated running techniques to pull me too far away from what is a natural running posture for myself.  I still believe there is a lot of value in what McDougall preaches, however I would temper that now with the understanding that we are all individuals and in running, as in anything, we need to find what works best for our bodies.ull me too far away from what is a natural running posture for myself.

B0060D15AK|5.0|Just loved it.  did not think I would like it at first but it was fun to watch.  Never saw Sandra Bullock so nasty. Glad when she lightened up.  But it was great.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|It won't load really fast but it's super duper fun I love it so much if I were u I would download it :)

0307730697|5.0|The Good: The Story<br /><br />Adam Brown's story of going from a normal kind, to what looks like totally screwing up his life to a Navy SEAL Team SIX  operator, to a lover of a wife and kids, to a hero - THIS IS A MUST-READ. This may be the best book to come out in 2013. A sub-plot is true story about the love of God that never stopped pursuing this messed-up man.<br /><br />I found the author's note in the Afterword most interesting, \\"Adam's story stands on it's own. . . his story has continued to change the lives of many--including mine. He's reminded me to appreciate every moment with my family, to be goofy rather than grumpy, to get back up no matter how hard I might get slapped down. . . And thought I hadn't opened a Bible in more than twenty-five  years, his faith encouraged me to question my own questioning about religion.\\"<br /><br />The Bad: The Life<br /><br />Much of Adam's life was just. . . bad. The book varnishes over none of it. But, it's seeing the bad that helps to understand what happened to Adam. To become part of the 1% who become a SEAL, and then to make team six with all the mess he had made of his life, this is such an encouraging book. It's somehow at the same time both awfully sad and tremendously encouraging.<br /><br />The Ugly: The Tears<br /><br />OK, I admit it, I cried.  That never happens to me when reading a book. Or, it never had before. The author does such a good job getting you into the skin of this guy--Fearless is a must read.<br /><br />I received a complimentary copy of this book from WaterBrook Multnomah's Blogging for Books program in exchange for an honest review. Honestly, this is a great book!<br /><br />danielcooley.com
B003QTSMXE|5.0|It was a great introduction to a unit on resources. This film really got my students thinking about the long-term effects of their use of resources on our planet.
B007FROGME|4.0|This is a fascinating and compelling book, some parts quite horrifying, yet insisting you read on to the end. Very well written, the tale draws you on to a satisfying conclusion. Life in Russia in those days was quite dreadful and a real eye opener. Give it a go, you won't be disappointed.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Book was good, intense. There's so many twists and turns, I just wish there was a different ending and justice was had in some way cause this woman was CRAZY!!
1451695195|5.0|Ir was an easy, inspiring, informative read!!!!!!!! I shared with ten friends, they loved it and shared with others too.

B003TSEEDY|5.0|Awesome book , couldn't put it down ! One I'll read fifty times an  it will never get old .
B0099Y2YL6|5.0|really enjoying Downton Abby and can't wait for episode 4 this coming Sunday I havent received  my blu ray copy yet but hope to get it next week I think they are sending them out on the 29th of JanuaryI loved seasons 1and2 and watch them over several times arent we lucky that we live in such in this modern day world
B006E05DVG|1.0|We bought a different DVD (from America!) I did not realize that this UK one had a different &#34;region&#34; so it did not work in my player. I do not know whether or not more advanced DVD players have the ability to change regions.<br />OH WELL. But this would have been nice to know before purchasing.<br /><br />P.S. Love the movie, just not the specific DVD we received. Very upsetting.
B007A2O3FO|5.0|I liked this film I'll have to wath it again and of course Maggy Smith was here usual self Great
B007J4T2G8|1.0|First off, I really wanted to like this book. I held off on buying it for months. Some of my friends love this book, and some hate it. I even read all of the bad reviews here on Amazon, but when I saw it for a reduced price on my Kindle I finally took the bait, ignoring everyone who said that it was a waste of $10. I sampled the first two chapters and wasn't hooked, but I figured it had to get better as the story went on. After all, everyone was talking about 50 Shades like it was the best thing to happen to literature in ages.<br /><br />I should have listened to all the bad reviews. If I could, I'd get a refund for this piece of.. wait for it... crap.<br /><br />I hate giving bad reviews, but hopefully I can convince someone that their money is better spent somewhere else. Of course, I knew this was originally written as a fan fiction, so I wasn't expecting to be completely blown away. I was, however, expecting to enjoy this book at the very least. After all, if the fan fiction got published and picked up by a major company, not to mention every one promoting it, it had to be better than your run of the mill fan fic published by a teenage girl with raging hormones. Sadly, it isn't. A few chapters in I decided to look E.L. James up to put a face to the much talked about name (and see who ultimately conned me out of my money), and I was surprised by that I saw. E.L. James is a married, middle-aged, mother of two. There's nothing wrong with that, but it somehow raised my expectations more.<br /><br />I couldn't even suffer through the whole book. I tried, I forced myself to read on, hoping somewhere along the line I'd have that moment where I realized I was hooked and actually enjoying Fifty Shades. Just over halfway through (according to my Kindle) I couldn't take it anymore. I deleted the book from my device and took a loss.<br /><br />Ana's 'inner goddess' and 'subconscious' make her out to sound schizophrenic. The constant inner dialog, playing out like an angeland devil on her shoulders, quickly becomes tiresome. For a literature major with a high GPA, Ana's vocabulary is severely limited. She is, however, excellent at coming up with different ways to say 'crap', but even those get old. 'Oh crap', 'holy crap', 'double crap', 'triple crap'... I could feel my brain turning to crap after a few chapters of this. I want to smack Ana, E.L. James, and whoever edited this book before Scholastic took it over with a thesaurus. E.L. James also needs to learn a thing or two about the country she sets her 'novel' in. I enjoy a good cup of tea too, but never have I heard of having it 'bag out', not does any American I know have a full tea set sitting in their cabinet. Also, can the girl get some Chapstick? She chews on her lip at least every other page, forcing me to envision her with a red, crusty, swollen lower lip. I also have a hard time believing a college grad who loses her virginity to some random hot guy she met a week ago would call her vagina 'down there' multiple times. Really? 'Down there'? Are you twelve? IT'S A VAGINA! You're letting some guy you barely know do whatever he wants with you, but you can't say vagina? Okay. Ana orgasms not only from Christian's mere touch, but also in her sleep. Come on! If I could orgasm from my boyfriend touching my arm or by having a dream, I sure as hell wouldn't be writing this review right now. Apparently there's a sex scene where Christian rips out Ana's tampon and has sex with her, but I didn't get that far.<br /><br />I stopped after the part where Ana gets upset because Chriatian spanks her. She starts crying, gets all worked up, and he comes back to her house telling her how much he cares and that it's just for pleasure and some other mess of 'crap' that reads more like a bad relationship than a steamy erotica novel. I've heard it gets worse, and if so, I don't plan on reading about it. Ladies, do yourselves a favor and NEVER find yourself a man like Christian Grey. A self made BILLIONAIRE at the age of 26 who had more excess baggage than an airbus. I can't bring myself to care about the characters, the writing is horrible, and I would have been better off taking $10 and burning it. At least I might have gotten some entertainment out of watching that, because I sure didn't get it from this book. I wish I could just transfer it to some poor sap about to waste their money.
0061992860|5.0|Well, Obama was reelected and there was no end of the world on 21 December 2012. So I had to get this because I know the end is now closer than ever before.
B0076DCT2G|1.0|Nelson needs to get back to writing thrillers instead of writing a book on the history of his locations. Really disappointed in this one.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|After seeing all the great reivews I had to check it out to see why it was so good. I was quickly engrossed in the book. I thought it was well written and has a captivating storyline. While the author gives lots of information about what's going on there is still enough mystery about the whole situation that leaves you wanting even more. Recommended.
B008WCP2PG|5.0|yes  i  got  this  movie  seen  it  on  comcast  got my  daughter  one  too  thank  you  these mean  alot  to  me
0375842209|5.0|I'm not sure anything I write can do justice to this book. First I'm surprised that this book is \\"young adult\\" or aimed at teens. I would never have guessed that as I found that out when I was well into the book. . .<br /><br />The author has an amazing writing style. When I first started I was a bit put off by it. I think my fast paced reading of romance books made this book difficult for me at first. It's not a book to be read quickly. Rather one should savor every description in the book. I think it's like one of those movies that you watch a second a time and pick up things that you missed. Surely I could do the same with this book.<br /><br />It took me a bit to realize that the narrator was death. I wasn't quite sure at the beginning.<br /><br />\\"There were certainly some rounds to be made that year, from Poland to Russia to Africa and back again. You might argue that I make the rounds no matter what year it is, but sometimes the human race likes to crank things up a little. They increase the production of bodies and their escaping souls. A few bombs usually do the trick. Or some gas chambers, or the chitchat of faraway guns. If none of that finishes the proceedings, it at least strips people of their living arrangements, and I witness the homeless everywhere. . . . . . I complain internally as I go about my work, and some years, the souls and bodies don't add up they multiply.\\"<br /><br />My favorite part of history is Hitler's rein and this book is certainly told from a different perspective. I fell in LOVE with the characters. Every.single.one.of.them. This story is woven in so much detail. And yes, before you ask, I cried at the end. :(<br /><br />The most accurate thing I can say about this book: read it. Just read it.
B007FC3AAI|5.0|im  a  twilight  colector  ive  gotten  pictures  copied  cant  get  enough  of  these  cant  wait  till  the  last  movie  comes  out
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|I like this game, it is fun.  However maybe it is just me but I really don't see what all the hype is about.  Gosh night shirts for $30 but the game is fun and I like to play it.
B004EPYZOO|5.0|thank  you  i  love  the  movie  i  watched  this  on  comcast  i  liked  it  very  much  i  got  my  son  one
B005P4PAVK|5.0|Love this show, this season not as funny as previous seasons but still worth it to watch.  Will rent season  6 next.
B000TGJ80S|5.0|ive  loved  movies  like  this  since  i  cant  remember  the  more  of  them  the  better  plese  keep  putting  more  out
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Beautiful book. I loved it. I could not put it down. I highly recommend it. Such a wonderful story to read.
B0052VUNHC|5.0|ABSOLUTELY LOVED THIS BOOK. I must admit that i have read this multiple times. The first time i couldnt put it down. While the bickering and constant guessing may be annoying and give you that &#34;Aahhh just go for him already&#34; feeling, it is completely amazing and anything but annoying. I would recommend this to any ladies you just love a good romance novel. It keeps you at the edge of your seat. And it is not overly romancy, it has a great underlying story line. You fall in love with both Abby and Travis and constantly want to know what is going to happen between them. There are plenty of twists and turns
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|I enjoyed playing this game. Good story and well developed characters.  The puzzles and HOG could have been a little more challenging but overall well worth the price.
B006LSZECO|4.0|This book keeps you on the edge of your seat from the start, it gives you insight to what both characters are thinking but without giving anything away. It continually throws new twists at you and has you second guessing. I loved this book, I couldnt wait to read it in my free time and you can really get involved with the characters. Sometimes you hate them and sometimes you love them. I highly recommend it!
B005DOKM9M|1.0|When I purchased it online it was supposed to fit my new Kindle fire hd and when I received it i found that I was unable to zip it shut.<br />It can fit length wise but not width wise.
B007SPN5MA|5.0|I heard/saw this artist on the tv show  parenthood and had to have it on my playlist.<br />The lyrics and music are deep, brooding at times but hopeful. This is definitely not your run o the mill pop for the masses music. Its music for the individual soul.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|Sometimes when saving myself with a gem it shuts down please fix and I will give 5 stars!! Other than that it works great on my kindle fire hd!!
B003Y5H574|5.0|This is a silly chick flick that I really enjoy. I call it a guilty pleasure. I love how the stories come together and the soundtrack.
B0076DELIG|4.0|I love the Harry Bosch books and this one is no different!  I'm anxious for the next one to come out.
037582913X|5.0|I loved this book as a child and now I give it as gift to every friend who is having a baby. My favorite compliment was from one of my friends who said they enjoyed reading the book to their child because you can get animated and its more interesting than most children books.
0765325950|5.0|Ok i'll admit that i am not quite half way through with A Memory of Light, but i have been 100% satisfied with ALL of the Wheel of Time books... So don't think that I'm writing this review in haste. I have to already give this book 5 stars. I become so immersed in it while reading it that i nearly forget its just a story written from some guy. But Sanderson is brilliant, and he gave a much needed boost to the series (however Jordan is just as wonderful!)... Anyway I'm anxious to finish! Thank you to all of the fellow reviewers who left out spoilers!!
B007THA4FI|1.0|I was very disappointed by this book . The language by both adults and teens was awful and ;made the reading quite unpleasant. The characters in the book garnered little sympathy except for the teenagers.  I expected better from J K Rowling having thoroughly enjoyed the Harry Potter books. This was not, in my opinion, a successful move into adult literature.
B0086700CM|5.0|itx a very good game . and a very high graphics when i bored some time i play this game i saw that m no longer bored any more
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Absolutely amazing. It is definitely one of my favorites now. Really makes you think and just an amazing wonderful book.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|I've had the original trilogy on DVD since it came out, but when the new movies came out I got them all separately. It's nice to have them all in one collection now and especially on Blu-Ray. I like the display they chose for this set. It's set up like a book and the discs go into sleeves so there's no awkward spindles to pull them off of, which makes it easy to get the disc out without bending it when the clips won't all release at the same time like some DVD/Blu-Ray cases tend to do.
B007VUCAVO|5.0|I love this product! It is easy to use and it helps me determine whether I have the battery power to watch a movie or play a game.  It is well worth the money!
B004HS1L9U|5.0|A very good book.  Wonderful story and adventuresome read.  It is almost like reading a personal diary of someone's trials and tribulations.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|Seems to be a real battery drain so i do not play as often as i might.  But it is fun and free is a great price.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. I would recommend it to anybody and loaned it to a friend who really enjoyed it as well. Be aware if you purchase this that the material in this book does have to do with sexual abuse. If you prefer not to read a book about sexual abuse do not purchase this book. The author does handle the topic with care.  She does not go into any graphic detail.<br /><br />The characters are well developed in this story. The story is told from the heroine's point of view.  It is definitely worth a read.
B0087GYY92|4.0|Some interesting character and some real plot twist. Ends up in the Chinese Box solution.<br />Personally I would call it enjoyable but not very convincing.  I read for pleasure and do avoid picking the<br />plots and their resolutions.  If you prefer to be critical you will not enjoy it.
B0012GMZKE|5.0|One of his original albums but still outstanding. Leonard Cohen at his best. It is well worth a listen. Love to see him live
0061339202|4.0|This is one of those rare books that really successfully takes someone's academic research and does it justice in a way that is still page-turningly interesting and readable for anyone working as a writer (or wanting to). While it can be dry at times, as Csikzentmihalyi does come accross as slightly old fashioned and Eurocentric in terms of his cultural preferences, he is one of THE world gurus on creativity and flow and this is a seminal work. His TED talk on flow is also worth watching if you're still hesitant about buying the book.
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|Wow, I really enjoyed this book! I will really have a hard time feeling sorry for myself, whenever I encounter a minor bump in the road of life, now that I have read about the huge obstacles Adam Brown pushed through - from his drug addiction, to his multiple training and battle injuries - and the sacrifices he made for his country. And, being a loving and devoted husband and father, puts him right at the top of the list of the heroes I admire!
B005DOKM9M|3.0|want a case that flips open not zippered<br />made a mistake with this purcase and would like to return<br />please advise.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|Compelling reading and great insight into the Teams that perform the task no one here's about. It's a quick read.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|love all the angry bird products that i can get for<br />ipod and kindle.<br />would highly recommend to people to try
B004UJTG6Q|5.0|If you are into classics this is a fine one. I would recommend it to anyone. I now own the book. I recommend it be read to your children as well.<br /><br />  In God we trust.<br />  Pat
B004G6009K|5.0|Disney movie are usually not heavily discounted, but I did get a better deal with this four-disc combo versus just the 2-disc, Blu-Ray.  I will plan on enjoying this, for many years to come, with my own little princess soon.
B002TTYAPQ|5.0|Even thought the book writer isn't the actor that plays Richard Castle on television I found that the writer is just as captivating and the actor. I'm now the proud owner all four of Richard Castles books. He has good plot lines and he still manages to keep the fire sizzling.<br /><br />  In God we trust.<br />  Pat
B00785P2QC|3.0|A little slow starting.....but getting the hang if it.  Wish you'd earn points at a higher rate, otherwise it's fun.
0385341679|5.0|Last book of the fever series.  Such a complex, compelling read.  I read this book in two days could not put it down.  Highly recommend the fever series.
B003E8P9G0|5.0|I thought the book was one of the best. I thought it was very funny. You really should buy it.
B000002HJD|5.0|This is a great addition to my husband's collection. I bought it for him and have enjoyed listening to it too. CD played beautifully.
1400052181|5.0|The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks is an excellent read.  It kept my interest from beginning to end.  Highly recommend!
B007UW9VWO|5.0|I would use this movie to show people I work with what is passion.  The documentary is great, but the guy Jiro is simply awesome.
1594200696|5.0|It's a short, slim volume, very portable; and it's an enjoyable read. There has never since been a better &#34;style&#34; manual for the English language. And because it's well written, the reader comes away with a better comprehension of, for example, grammar than ever before. It is a must read for everyone who wants to write anything, including a better cover letter.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|Beginning was a little hard for me to get started but once I was in I was consumed with the love story that unfolded.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book is amazing you should totally read it if you like scary books plus science fiction and fantasy together. Read  it or your missing out at something amazing.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|Very good read. Read it to my significant other and we both found it fascinating. We are recommending it to everyone.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|This show has a misleading title.  Horror...yes...but man, do you get more.  Psychology, drama, pathos...an intensity of emotions, explorations of the deepest of our natural (and unnatural) fears and desires, with a cast that includes the divine Ms. Lange.  Her final goodbye as Sister Jude/Judy Martin was actually poignant; you felt for her, what she'd been reduced to, and her &#34;redemption&#34;.  I'm prejudiced about Dylan McDermott as I've been a fan of his for years, but I do believe his turn as Johnny (Bloody Face Jr.) Morgan was strangely sexy as well as frightening, very sad as well as disgusting.  You could believe that he was one mixed up SOB, but still, one could feel for him when he met his Mom:  &#34;I've hurt people..&#34;  Playing a murderer that the audience hates is one thing.  Playing a serial killer that you understand, can see how he got there, that's quite another.<br /><br />Another season, please.  And please, please include Dylan and Jessica.  It wouldn't be AHS without them....
B004J4WLB4|4.0|Good read in depth look into how we control our own lives--good or bad and how some of the beauty in nature can be so meaningful.
B005IQ39AY|5.0|I love this game, but I have a hard time getting my Kindle back from my husband as he is now hooked on the game, too. (Guess he needs his own Kindle)
B000641MB6|5.0|Fun to introduce the kid to a wholesome film I enjoyed in my youth - can't go wrong with this one.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I absolutely love this game!!!!!! so realistic and my daughter loves it too!! the only bad thing it is still not a real horse...
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I absolutely love this game! The graphics are wonderful, and the levels are easy to achieve. You can invite friends, receive gifts from them, and visit your friends` farms! Especially if you're a horse lover, you're going to like this game. The only thing that I would warn you about this game is that it offers to sell some items to you using real money. Otherwise, this game is great. I found it for free on my Kindle Fire and it was rated five full stars. You also get to take place in competitions for prizes and there is a wide variety of mini-games to play. You also have the option of creating a username and renaming your horse. You can also buy more horses and landscapes. Hope you enjoy! :)
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This calculater is free and works very well! When ever I need a calculator I choose this one! I love it a lot.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game is one of the most addicting that I have ever came across. I constantly played this until I completed ALL the levels and had stars for all of them. I do however, feel that the difficultly of the puzzles aren't necessarily in order. I would skip a puzzle because I wouldn't be able to figure out how to solve it and have no problems with the following one. I feel like that could use some work, but overall, it's a great game! (:
030758836X|4.0|This is a very well-written and creepy story about a completely dysfunctional marriage and the extreme lengths to which Amy Dunne goes to get the upper hand over her husband, Nick.  Nick proves to be an equal match, however, and as the details emerge and opinions form, it's hard to know who or what to believe.<br /><br />Flynn presents some interesting side characters.  Nick's twin sister, Go, has to question Nick's behavior and his choices and she must choose between her loyalty to Nick and the apparent truth.  Amy's too perfect parents are a puzzling mix of traits.  They are loving and worried about their only child, but have been surprisingly opportunistic as authors of the Amazing Amy series.  Nick's misogynistic father, deep into Alzheimer's, offers plenty of looks into Nick's unhappy upbringing.  Nick's mother is the only pure character in this story and her death leaves Nick without an anchor.<br /><br />The police, newspaper reporters and TV journalists have a heyday with their investigation into the story of Amy's disappearance and their traits are true to the current behavior of real life media.  Add to that some additional bizarre characters from Amy's past, and you're fully submerged into a thick mix of questionable motives and unclear truths.<br /><br />I think the best part of this book is Flynn's look into the strange state of Amy's marriage to Nick and the mind games they play to manipulate each other.  And I think the story's open-ended finish adds to its eeriness.  Excellent and original!
B008NEVP1S|5.0|I love this CD! Aimee Mann is a brilliant song writer, one of my favorite CD's. Can't wait to hear more of her music.
006197806X|5.0|The book itself was super great! I can't wait to read Requiem now.. but personally, I dislike all hardcovers, so.. waiting for paperback as well.
1451673442|5.0|Love this book, very easy to read and understand. Offers new ways to be grateful. Has applications you can apply to your life every day. This book will help you achieve great things.
B003TSEL7S|5.0|Great source of entertainment for me. It was meant for children but still suitable for adults. Bravo Mr. Riordan you did a fantastic job.
B0015F1VY8|1.0|Movie edited down way too much. It skipped a lot of important scenes which were in the original.  I would not recommend it.
B007SGM084|3.0|This was entertaining enough, but I expected the sex scenes to be at least a little more scandalous and books 2 & 3 felt unnecessary.
B005TQACLC|5.0|Great concert, sadly she changes a lot of performances in the SouthAmerican Tour, she's a queen and her music awesome!!!
B001NLKWLW|5.0|Dynamics between characters is interesting.  Sacrifice of heroine is heartbreak.  Setting is well described.  Characters are believable and mystery is surprising.
B007TNS6JI|4.0|has a couple issues, like the controls are sometimes laggy or unresponsive. some of the items or upgrades should be cheaper, or the currency dropped should be increased.
B0013TTLDE|5.0|This is the first book l have read by Kate Morton but not the last. Her prose is descriptive and beautiful and her characters well drawn.
B00AREIAI8|1.0|I was very excited to try this app and the first time I played it was fun. however when I tried to load it the second time it would never load. I uninstalled and reinstalled it but then I could not train or compete. it said &quot;updating competitions&quot; but would never finish. tried uninstalling and reinstalling a second time but did not fix the problem. I'm giving up. I have a kindle fire.
B003V1WTMM|5.0|Foreshadowing allows the reader to imagine some answers to the mystery but not all.. a page turner.  Love this author.  Vocabulary is amazing.
B004FP1WX0|4.0|This happens more often than people realize. Anyone that watches the show and like it should watch this movie to understand Nev's story.
B006HGXGWU|5.0|...was certainly one of the best films I saw last year and I wish you Hollywood film makers with all your money, all your coaching on what makes money in the cinema etc. would maybe just realise your shite will not last..stuff like this will because it had characters I cared for and the story made me THINK! Great film.
1476712042|5.0|I read this in a day.  It was a great story.  I wasn't as erotic as I would've liked, but more romantic but nonetheless a good read.  However, I have learned the hard way that it is not a good idea to read this during certain \\"cycles\\" : )
B005EHQGTS|5.0|I am changing my review on this app. All the issues have been fixed, it looks great on my Nexus 10 now. Also, the mouse clicking and dragging has been greatly improved.<br /><br />Their customer support is also great. Great job!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I really like this book. It bought everything to a close. I was happy that Peeta and Kat finally got together.
B0086700CM|4.0|temple run 2 has to be the best game ever!!!!!!! I've gotten at least 320 thousand points I would have recomended this to a friend but it sometimes doesn't get your touch when you slide or duck or even when you turn sometimes<br />  player of temple run 2:)
B007M45PMU|3.0|There are only so many times you can get away with the backup singers doing 'background shouts' as part of a song.  Don't get me wrong - I really like their stuff, but I'd like to see a bit more diversity in the offering.  I really like 'Ho Hey,' 'Stubborn Love,' and 'Flowers In Your Hair.'
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is a very fun game if you wanted a horse without the money lol very fun and has pretty good graphics
B00AREIAI8|4.0|It's clear picture is wonderful!! I love the horse challenges as well!  I would definitely recommend this game for lots of fun!!
B001JNND9W|5.0|YOU NEED THIS IN YOUR COLLECTION.  IF YOU LIKE SPEEDING CARS AND VERY INTERESTING CO STARS.  A MUST HAVE HAVE.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is great. Better than the original but a lot more challenging. Good controls and graphics but I hate how the game doesn't react to my strokes as fast as it does in the first game. In the end though, it's way better than TR.
B0000A02TZ|5.0|THIS IS ONE OF THE ALL TIME CULT CLASSICS OF ALL TIME.  GREAT MOVIE FOR YOU AND THE GUYS ON A SATURDAY AFTERNOON BELLY BUSTER ALL THE WAY THROGH.  IF I AM NOT MISTAKEN, THIS IS ONE ONE KEVIN BACONS FIRST MAJOR MOVIES.  &#34; THANK YOU SIR, MAY I HAVE ANOTHER!&#34;

So me and Greg do have sort of have the same life but a little different!!!!!I have been trapped with my smartelic brother and my dumb minded older brother!trust me it did not end pretty cause my little brother went crazy!!!!!!!!!!
B00785P2QC|5.0|Really good game!!! I love all the freedom you have with the game! I highly recommend this game to anyone who loves to create!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|best game ever love it so cool great action Ps I love the 1st one to. its so awesome its so fun. Ps grayson is awesomme and love u dino
B00062PN6I|4.0|They serve me fine for my purpose which is too keep my late night guitar playing from waking up the neighbors. The long cord helps as well as the one sided wire coming off the headphones. The cords are fairly thick so they don't tangle too badly and aren't too fragile. The sound quality is decent for the money but not super high fidelity.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Wish there were more options, including but not limited to spider solitare, vegas style or whatever solitare versions are available... otherwise its classic.
B001TWT0AE|5.0|You can't go wrong with a John Ford directed movie...you can't go wrong with James Stewart, John Wayne, and the wicked Lee Marvin.<br />John Wayne is at his best when directed by John Ford, and this story is a great a story to watch with your kids as it really takes on the subject of how the justice system works in real life during the &#34;steak scene&#34;.<br />Love this movie and ordered it as part of my collection of favorites.<br />Next up to order, The Quiet Man.
B0019LY5IM|5.0|Great series; need to catch all episodes; this season might be the best of the entire TV series.  Thank you
B006GWO5NE|5.0|This is a must for KF owners. None of the chargers come wit a cord that is long enough to play while charging. Except for this one
B005LAII8A|3.0|It's never easy to follow a story involving time travel conundrums and paradoxes, and this one is no exception. You should watch it, though, for the acting talent displayed by the cast, including a small boy who will knock your socks off.
B008MM9630|5.0|It's a nice game for a farming game. Wish you didn' t have to spend so many stones to buy things.
B00A81MV3U|5.0|I give this one credit for being unpredictable and especially for its intelligent and complex dialogue.  Kudos to director David O. Russell for also adapting the screenplay from a novel.  The cast is fantastic, especially Jennifer Lawrence, in this suburban tale of a man with a mood disorder who falls for a woman with emotional problems of her own.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|As somebody who played Pong...getting something like this on my Kindle Fire still blows me away. It looks spectacular. If you were hooked on the first one then you will love this one too!
B000LXHK2C|3.0|Russell Crowe does an unusually comedic turn in this rom com set in France, with nice performances also from Finney, Highmore, and the ladies.  The script could have been stronger, especially in regard to the romance between Crowe's and Cotillard's characters and their screen time together.
B009HQ9UHC|4.0|Better than the sequels one gets used to expecting from a game developer.<br />Lots of new twists and I stayed interested in coming back for more !
B005KELW26|5.0|Perfect to protect my Kindle Fire and easy to slip in my purse when I am on the go.  The color is nice as well.
B001IF277K|5.0|TODO BIEN UN EXCELENTE PRODUCTO  ...<br />LAS PERSONAS QUE USAN ESTE PRODUCTO ESTAN MUY SATISFECHAS CON EL PRODUCTO<br />MUY AGRADECIDOS
8170262259|4.0|The Little Prince is not a children's book.  Yet, as you read the story an inexorable desire overcomes you; demanding that you finish it.  That's my opinion anyway.  Moreover I was drawn into the setting of book, even though I knew it was a fantasy  More importantly, I think the book touches on universal themes, that's the effulgence of the story.  Lastly, The Little Prince is small palpable book that will move you.
B0013TXA5Y|4.0|This is a tough review for me because I am not a big fan of YA (Teenage angst and emotion is just not my cup of tea). Of course, that is not the authors fault.  I read this for a book group and was pleasantly surprised. This is the first book in a series, and as a first book, I think the author did a really good job of world building and character indtroduction. The characters all had their own distinct personalities, and I was never confused about who was who. However, I never felt comfortable with the relationship between Clary and Jace...it always seemed forced and awkward. Maybe that was done on purpose considering the ending that I won't reveal. I have to say that Simon was my favorite and I wish that he had been more of a player in all of the action (I always root for the underdog). I hope he will have his turn in future books of the series. There were many scenes that I felt Simon should have been a part of, but was just forgotten about or left out for some unknown reason. Speaking of action, that is one of the things I enjoyed most about this story, lots and lots of action. I am an action junky, and to me, the more the better. I really can't say anything too negative about this story. Overall it was an enjoyable read. I did appreciate the fact that, even though this is a series, the story felt complete. There were a few loose ends for the next book, but not too many. No great cliffhangers to worry about. I probably will not go on to read the next book in the series, but that is just because of my own personal YA hang-up. I'm sure that most readers would most definitely want to continue on with the intriguing world that the author has created. This book opens up a wide array of possibilities for future installments.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This is one of the most challenging games I have come across.  I like that it makes you actually use your brain!
B0092C2X7U|3.0|Pros:<br /><br />addicting game play<br />simple<br />forgiving learning curve<br />easy to pick up<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />Graphics are so-so<br />seems like there are weird inconsistencies

B00A4Y9BT8|5.0|Has enough tracks to be worth buying.  Rage Against The Machine is one of the best bands of my generation.
B00A9X9ORI|5.0|Looper was great one of the best movies I've seen in a while I went to the video store to get it and it stayed unavailable so I guess the buzz is out it's a must see.
0345803507|5.0|This series met and exceeded my expectations. It was a romance with a bit of thriller and mystery thrown in to keep you guessing as to what was going to happen next.<br />I LOVED ALL THREE BOOKS.<br />I have read them all 4 times already. I wish that E. L. James would follow-up with another trilogy.<br />Looking to more in the future.<br />A MUST READ !!!
B001O80G60|5.0|A MUST HAVE FOR ANY FAN OF METAL OR PANTERA!!! IF YOU DO NOT LIKE THIS YOU SUCK!!!! Ha ha ha
B0053TMP24|5.0|It was the best book I have ever had seen in my awesome life ever it has a ok ending I guess.
B005O7PXNS|5.0|Easy to get TV shows on Amazon.  Like the many choices.  Will use it often when I miss a TV show
B004VMUS9G|5.0|I'm a heavy sleeper who finds it hard to wake up in the morning. I usually find an alarm clock with a noise that will wake me up, but I get immune to it after awhile. This app was perfect for me. It allows me to choose from a variety of ringtones, as well as use my own music as the alarm (I find heavy metal to be the most effective). The best feature is the solving math problems snooze and dismiss option. This makes sure I don't just hit a snooze/off button and sleep my way through my alarm. By making me solve math problems, I'm able to wake myself up faster and don't sleep through alarms anymore.
0446679089|3.0|I had mixed feelings about this book. On one level, I enjoyed the science as well as the police procedural, and I really like the author's clean, brisk writing style. Unfortunately, I did not like the protagonist, John Corey. Far too sexist, and the references to women as little more than the sum of their body parts quickly got old. Which is too bad, because I think the author's intention was to create a crusty and sarcastic but lovable character. If his character respected women a little more, I would have liked him. But instead I spent far too much time eye rolling and being annoyed by his sexist quips. <br /><br />As for the story itself, it's a good one, but the last 100 pages could have easily been condensed to less than half that. Took too long to wrap things up, and at almost 700 pages (paperback), it went on for too long.
B006E4QCXU|3.0|Playing with this app was fun at first, but I got bored of it quickly since you were limited in what you could do.
B00B2V66VS|2.0|I've been trying to download it for such a long time but it wont let me. I also don't have a lot of stuff on my kindle but still it keeps freezing.
B005FITIIC|4.0|In 2008, on the eve of the globalized economic meltdown, a young analyst at a Lehmen-Brothers-esque financial institution, comes to a startling conclusion.  His firm is dangerously over-leveraged with cancerous assets and is only weeks away from a complete and total collapse.  Faced with a seven-figure payoff, he and his fellow traders are asked to make a choice.  Are they willing to bite the bullet and reap the consequences of their own greed, or should they sell the toxic assets in one fierce day of trading, thus further spreading the disease to the rest of an already strained financial industry?<br /><br />Hailed by David Denby of The New Yorker as \\"one of strongest American films of the year and easily the best Wall Street movie ever made,\\" Margin Call is the sharply-written debut effort from writer-director J.C. Chandor.  Shot against the New York skyline, it dares to look at these \\"gods\\" staring down from their lofty towers of privilege and power and asks the question: can you humanize the demonized?  Or, in this era of Nietzschian politics, must you continue to paint them as sub-human monsters fit only for extermination.<br /><br />Further reviews can be found at bloodstainedink.wordpress.com.

B003Y5H4YI|4.0|In 1966, three Israeli Mossad agents undertook a mission to hunt down the Nazi war criminal, Dieter Vogel, the much-feared \\"Surgeon of Birkenau.\\"  But 30 years later, following a lifetime of public praise, the unexpected suicide of David (Ciaran Hinds) leaves the other two members of the original team scrambling to maintain a secret that has haunted them for most of their adult lives.<br /><br />Written by the rising, young British writer/director, Matthew Vaughn, and featuring great performances by Helen Mirren, Jessica Chastain, and Jesper Christensen, The Debt is a spy film for people who favor pictures such as Steven Spielberg's Munich over the latest Mission Impossible installment.  It is a quiet, slow burning tale punctuated by infrequent and yet harrowing bursts of the most intimate and personal violence.  As opposed to many films which seek to provide tidy answers, it asks probing questions about the nature of vengeance, what it means to be Jewish in a post-Holocaust world, and what it costs to fight for the state of Israel.<br /><br />Truly \\"great\\" spy movies are somewhat difficult to find; and yet The Debt is that rarity.  As an unabashed fan of such films, I highly recommend this for you viewing pleasure.<br /><br />Further reviews can be found at bloodstainedink.wordpress.com.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Minecraft is awesome!!!!All those haters can hate on Kindle Fire Minecraft......friend has Minecraft on her iPhone and her Mac Book.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I liked it but the beginning was kinda slow. But hard to put down once you got into it. Good read
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|Absolutely love this game! Have it on the iPad, iPhone, iPod, and now my Kindle too! Can't wait to unlock the great white shark!
0385344333|1.0|I have greatly enjoyed the Jack Reacher series -- up until this edition.  Child really 'phoned it in' on this one.  It is nowhere close to the quality of the earlier books.  Someone should have shut this one down before it was release -- publishing deadlines be dam-ed.  It really is amateurish - really a waste of money (and time).  Hoping fervently that the real Jack Reacher returns . . .
B0098QBEXO|4.0|I rented it cause I am on a Benedict Cumberbatch kick at the moment. It was a great film, wonderful story of the truth of friendships and beautiful scenery. Benedict is a versatile actor.
B00A757EFW|4.0|I liked this app. the controls were different than many other games out there, and it is nice to see that difference because many apps use the same controls. the gameplay was fun just like the original.
B004SBQGHS|4.0|Just what I didst need,<br />Another freaking game that sucks up most of my free-time which should be used constructively. But, strictly speaking objectively: This is the most fun I have ever had with my clothes on!!! Its simple, yet has lotsa hidden surprises, & it has just the right amount of bells and whistles!! they have basically a almost unlimited amount of levels which is why people are competing online.<br />Warning!!!!! If you play one game, that's it...Highly addictive, just like those old potato-chips joke: &#34;Can't just eat one!&#34;
B003O86FMW|3.0|While reading about all twelve districts and what was produced from each.  Gave each tribute knowledge. And they used it to survive
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|rig like this game however I have issues with my upgrades not saving.  when I reload the game items I just purchased may or may not be there.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this is fun but kinds hard all at the same time. its fast to get lost of time with this app. you should get it also.
B001AX60KU|3.0|I have some other Elvis CD collections that I like better.  There is a lot of talking, laughter, etc., on these CD's in addition to the actual singing.  I guess I'm just not as happy with CD's of live performances.  However, the sound quality, etc., is excellent and the price was certainly very reasonable!
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|A real page turner couldn't put it down I loved all the twists and turns and the characters were very real and believable
B00006AG5N|5.0|I absolutely love this collection of Elvis songs!  Right now I have it at home, but would love to have it in my car also, so am thinking about ordering a second CD to keep in the car - LOL!!
B0086700CM|5.0|i have chosen this rating because me and my friend are so, i am going to win, no i am going to win.<br />i liked when you have to earn money to get wings boosts and other things.
B005KP7EO0|4.0|Enjoyed this western a lot. Easy to watch and enertaining.<br />Worth the fee to watch it. Hope you enjoy it too
B009GXHOW4|5.0|i choose this app because it helps me with mine craft, and i lost everything when i went in my house,and i did not die.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|It is a fun game when you are stuck inside with nasty weather - but it sure doesn't measure up to having a real horse.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Temple run is a very very fun and addicting game. There were a few glitches in the first. There are new features that make the game harder, but not immpossible. Gei game! You won't be disappointed!
B0002YCVXI|5.0|If you like Yo-Yo Ma you will want to make this part of your collection. He is a wonderful artist and Ennio Morricone's music is so captivating.
B00AZRBLHO|5.0|I picked this book up a few weeks ago when it was first released. Half of the reviews were from my own direct contacts in the industry - if they said this was the book to read then I knew I had better stop and take a look.<br /><br />At the same time as I was reading the book I was approached by a company to take over and manage their DevOps teams. My life is about to mirror (well hopefully not all the problems) of the main character Bill Palmer. I was so taken with the book that I immediately reached out to Gene, hoping to have some of his time to ask questions and really develop this role of DevOps correctly from the start.<br /><br />Some of the wisdom I found in the pages:<br /><br />- Understand the problem first from the business perspective. Then look at the technical problem and solution.<br />So many times we as technologists forget and throw the coolest toys at the problem, the business is what pays the bills - can't forget that!<br /><br />- \\"Your job as VP of IT Operations is to ensure the fast, predictable, and uninterrupted flow of planned work that delivers value to the business while minimizing the impact and disruption of unplanned work, so you can provide stable, predictable, and secure IT service.\\"<br />Pretty simple - imagine you are building a car, a phone, or even a pencil - people expect them to always work when they need them.<br /><br />-\\"a `change' is any activity that is physical, logical, or virtual to applications, databases, operating systems, networks, or hardware that could impact services being delivered.\\"<br />I have had to many conversations where this definition was never established.<br /><br />The book was amazing - wrapping a good story with the necessary steps and guidance to help a future CTO/CIO figure out how to survive.
B003ODIZL6|1.0|This book should have been more interesting and funny. This was just words in ABC order. Its demented/retarded. I don't like this book AT ALL sorry
B0010SKUYM|5.0|I was looking forward to a period novel about the knights in the dark ages.  I was surprised to find myself in a fantasy tale of magic and dragons.  I would have put the book down at that point except it was so well written that I got trapped.  I never thought I would enjoy such fantasy, but now I can't wait for the next book in the series.  Worth reading just for the fun of it - though the writing dips deedply into human feelings and superstitions.  Much to my surprise It's a wonderful escape!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book is smashing!!!!  Could not put it down.  The author-ess weaves a great tale, which has several ups-N-downs.  The ending will blow you away.  She tells a good story with a lot of humor, passion, and sex.  If you are into passionate sex with teenagers being the objects, this book is for you.  She obviously has some teenagers at home to use as models.  You will LOOOOVVVEEE the book.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|While I enjoyed the read and the twists of the story, I felt that this time the plot was formulaic and written to cash in on his previous reputation.  I will still read his future novels because I've consumed his whole literary product, and still appreciate the light reading at times.
B004LWZWGK|5.0|The movie was visual the story was very good and I watched the whole trilogy so I'm partial ,I would definatly recommend the whole trilogy to any one
B006MW3V6U|5.0|SO well done, acting, production, cinematography, a joy in every way. I have relished catching up with season one and now two, nearly there! Season 3 is next. Do yourself a favor and watch it.
B009MO5960|4.0|It was very visual and I enjoyed it thoroughly,I would reccmmend to  anyonethat like th trilogy,wil watch it againdefinetly<br />l
B000JMKQX0|5.0|It's been a long time since I've read something this captivating and entertaining.  As a zombie-enthusiast, this switch bed required reading.  And, the dedication to Anne Bancroft, at the end was tear-jerking.<br />Max did an excellent job on the story.  And the editors and publishers did an excellent job on the proofreading and publication.  I'll definitely read this one over again.
0345803485|1.0|Oh My what repetition!  ...and the junior-high writing style.  I'm writing this review because I cannot believe this book currently has more than a single star rating. Buyer beware!
B003O86FMW|5.0|I loved it I'm gonna start the third book it was an action nerve racking book it leaves you in suspense.....
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|If you have ever spent time at a carnival or State Fair and played this game in person, you will love this virtual game as well.  I have spent many hours dropping coins and receiving prizes.  The best thing is not wasting money for more tokens.  You can purchase more tokens, but the game does have a regeneration rate that allows more play with online  Like I said, if you like these type of coin games in person, this game is for you.
B001VNB54A|5.0|This was a Christmas gift for my husband. After seeing Band Of Brothers, had wanted to see The Pacific as well. Both movies are of high quality. We both enjoyed watching them.
B005OP821K|5.0|Could not stop watching this.  Purchased season 2 and continue to watch.  Love it.  Can't wait for next episode.  Will be buying it to watch over again.
B0094KF4WG|5.0|Feel the book was written well. I didn't feel like anything was left out. It was all I expected and then some.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|its so fun y'all should get it I just love the world tour its action and lots of fun and so simple your kids could understand
B008FRFN7A|1.0|Doesn't work with my Brother printer.  I spent too much time trying to figure out the problem.  I'm  very dissapointed.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|I have Angry Birds Seasons and I love it so I thought I would give this Angry Birds a try. I love it. It is highly addictive and oh soooo much fun. It is hard to put my Kindle down when I play.
B003IN7YPU|5.0|From start to finish this is just excellent. Apart from giving a history of events there are numerous interviews from people who lived through the war. Civilians, soldiers, the man/woman on the street, politicians, privates to generals and from all sides. I can't recommend this highly enough.
B007SGM084|2.0|The story read like a woman's porn fantasy.  Nothing of substance and come on, unless you are a nymphomaniac, couldn't do all that this gal did.
B001GZ6QEC|5.0|an excellent product which offers everything specified in the offer and the quality has gone very good a very good job
B000005B0U|4.0|I like these songs very much a few more tracks would have made this disc great. Whay an all star cast!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Thought provoking and funny....for the young and old.  I thought it was a very honest tale of youth, illness and love.
B003FNWR6Y|5.0|My son was so happy when he opened this on X-mas!<br />He loves Monopoly, now he loves Mario Monopoly!!!!!!!!!!!<br />Great Gift!
B000YJ54DU|3.0|Another good but not great book by Lee Child.  JACK Teacher again is able to figure out the mystery of Dispare
B001NLKT60|5.0|An outstanding sequel to &#34;The Girl With the Dragon Tatoo&#34;.  My only regret is that there are only three books in this series which is filled with interesting characters and all sorts of plot twists.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|I love this app but if you have a kindle fire you will probably be able to use it once then it wont open the app that's what happened to me I am going to try to get rid of this app then download it again
B006LSZECO|5.0|This was such a GREAT book! I am actually sad that I finished it!!! So crazy!! so many twists and turns.. you will love the characters, then you will hate them, then you'll feel sorry for them!! I definitely recommend it! One of my favorite books now!!
B00005JNQS|5.0|A movie that My husband, my daughter, and I can all enjoy together. Our daughter laughs at all the goofiness, while my husband and I catch and laugh at the more adult humor.
B003ZSI7R2|5.0|Somehow got turned on to these guys late last year.  Great album with an old school vibe.  A little Motown, a little rock, all good.  Vocals are fantastic.  Guitar playing is a perfect compliment.  If you like old rock from the 60's with a healthy dose of soul on top, you will love this album.  Also, this came with a card for free downloads of bonus tracks.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|This app is great. I read the comments and was unsure at first but I did a three time test and it passed all three so I recommend this. But you know every experience is different.
B007RQ6WCA|3.0|I installed this on my iPad and could not access my documents or files.  Not as easy to access as Dropbox on iPad.  Why is that?
B009E3EYMY|5.0|This is a great compilation of Led Zeppelin songs. The dvd of the live concert is awesome!! Well worth buying for any Zeppelin fan.
B007V2UGPE|4.0|This game is addictively fun, especially if you're looking for a game that doesn't require a lot of thought but isn't completely brainless.  And the dancing army when you win is great!
B00ARAO720|5.0|It was a great movie and intense!<br />Looking at the rating I would of never thought it would have been good.
1250027624|4.0|I bought this as a gift for a friend who fell in love with this television series. I glanced at it and for those who were awaiting the commencement of the third series, it gave up some of its secrets. I would recommend it as a gift.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|The only problem I had is when it says save me you hit save but the game crashes and you lose all the points and coins :(<br />.Very well done better than the first one
B003G4W49C|5.0|Captures the imagination to the extent of seeing through Ender's eyes. Fiction with a philosophical undertone. Nothing like I've read before.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|It is easy to form an addiction to this frothy soap opera of early 20th century English lives! The costumes and the set design are scrumptious. One could wish for a bit more of the history and politics (you'd better already know it, to have a real context) but &#34;The History Channel&#34; this is certainly not! However, the densely-plotted story lines - while admittedly overwritten - keep you hopping from one richly-drawn character to the next. Our favorite character is the dowager duchess played acerbically by Maggie Smith; she herself is worth the price of this set!<br />It is wonderful to have the entire season in one package, with no commercials.
B0058YPG1G|5.0|Received product much sooner than expected; quality was great and nothing broken. Was exactly what I expected with no problems. Was a gift and arrived on time.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Can't wait for the next one.  These are some of my favorite books and always a good read for any age.

B0091REZMW|3.0|Fun game but it's hard to get special objects for some of the special rooms without purchasing...which I won't!!!  Okay for the purchase price of game though.

B000N2HBSO|5.0|The author paints a very detailed picture of Lincoln and his Team of Rivals based upon historic data. The reader is drawn into both the history and the personas of \\"The Team\\"'. The richness of detail in every chapter enhances the experience so much that the characters seem to jump out of the pages.<br /><br />So many lessons could be learned by our current political leadership if they were to read this biography  and grasp the greatness of Abraham Lincoln.
B001RTSPVY|5.0|Received product much sooner than expected; quality was great and nothing broken. Was exactly what I expected with no problems. Was a gift and arrived on time.
0525953728|5.0|GREAT STORY!! Couldn't put it down.  The truth rings out throughout the book.  Hard to put it down.  Admired him trying to protect his fellow Seals by not revealing their real names but of course some news person had to reveal the real names. The news person and station didn't seem to protect the Seals involved because they wanted their brief moment of fame no matter who it might hurt. Thank you Mr. Mark Owen for reporting the very brave actions of the Seals and for giving us examples of their many duties, sacrifices and bravery. Thank you again!
B004EPYZZ8|5.0|Received product much sooner than expected; quality was great and nothing broken. Was exactly what I expected with no problems. Was a gift and arrived on time.

B009UX2YAC|5.0|I downloaded this game onto my kindle fire. It works great. My husband and two boys (ages 7 & 10) love it. The game has daily missions that come up every 24 hours so the game dosent get boring. they are pretty easy missions. Overall its a great game for our family.

B00005RDRO|4.0|I remember watching this movie as a kid and loving it. I Watched it on my Blu-ray and it was great.
B003XRELGQ|5.0|outstanding book, reads like a true story and Vonnegut has a great way of making you feel like you are there with him while the story plays out
B003ZJ0ZX0|5.0|Bruno's mother and/or father definitely taught him how to deal with women. This is a great album, even though I'm not the biggest fan of hip/hop or r&b. I love it!!
B007VUCAVO|4.0|A beautiful showing of battery life with interesting information about battery usage. It could be a bit more fluid though.
B009GQ57ES|5.0|Too much rap today is repetitive, narcissistic, inane, untruthful. Where is the edge?  Where is the story telling?  Where is the truth?  (Even in the 2pac era, rapping about money was really about the *desire* for power and money at a time when such things were inaccessible to black youth, and seemed to be intended as a stark contrast to the crack epidemic that was decimating inner city neighborhoods. The 'money' story line is now 20 years old, and has morphed to become less relevant, less truthful, more vain, more narcissistic, and boringly ubiquitous.).  Maybe I had just outgrown rap....<br /><br />Enter the Heist. I was sent a link to the NPR &#34;Tiny Desk&#34; concert performed by Macklemore and was blown away.  Here was Macklemore challenging the homophobic culture of hip hop, while examining his own assumptions about what it meant to be gay.  In the next song challenging the narrative about money by professing his love for &#34;your Grandpa's clothes&#34; that he could pick up in a thrift shop.  (About designer t-shirts: &#34;That shirt's hella dough; And having the same one as six other people in this club is a hella don't!&#34;)  Story telling!  An edge!  Something novel!  Hallelujah!<br /><br />The message is all well and good, but to be honest I probably wouldn't have made it that far if the music didn't sound good. But it does. Banging bass. Melody. Great vocals. A trumpet loads the songs with energy; the songs are interlaced with samples from '90s era hip hop. The songs actually progress and develop.  Macklemore changes his tempo and phrasing.  Good stuff.<br /><br />My best advice: Check out Macklemore's 'NPR Tiny Desk' concert.  If you're not blown away, then this isn't the CD for you. And.... I'm not sure you're a fan of the best that rap can be.<br /><br />Macklemore is the next rap star in the making. In a way, a throwback. But also an evolution.  And just in time.
B001HC8516|5.0|I found this book to be very insightful, I now feel like I can make wiser decisions when I meet someone and determine if I should move on more quickly...
1439163154|5.0|These stories are not for the faint of heart or for someone who looks for happy endings. All the stories are left unfinished, and left up for interpretation are what the reader thinks might happen next. I like the way that is. Every story is different, but overall have a same theme. All the characters are troubled teens who are hurt and lost, which causes them to act out or behave in strange ways. Franco writes their point of view in truthfulness and a lot of what the characters say are complex and seem to come from the subconscious. Most the stories are vulgar and intense in description, which makes them a little unsettling as you read. Regardless of how weird and vulgar they can be, every story made me feel deeply, and I was able to relate or feel for the character. I think partly because I knew a lot of people that reminded me of them. I understood the hurt and pain behind them all, and saw the good and innocence in everyone of them. I hope Franco writes more, maybe a novel next time that develops a whole story.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|i enjoyed this novel very much. im definitely going to purchase the next novel, this is a very addicting novel to read
B00ATSBIIG|5.0|Relaxing and exciting at the same time.  Improves your memorization and concentration.I would recomend this game to anyone who loves puzzles and challenges.  I have had games that bore me to tears.  Here is one that gives you a<br />challenge to your memory.
0345529057|4.0|I bought the series for my sister (her birthday) and asked for it gift wrap. It came wrapped but the wrapping was torn. I don't know if it was Amazon's or FedEx's fault but i didn't like the fact that the wrapping was torn. Luckily the books were in good condition and everything was fine. The only reason it's not a 5 is because of the torn gift wrap. otherwise, excellent stuff.
B009HEJXFS|5.0|Kay and Jay best partnership in history! Odd balls, yet a match! Sci-Fi as it should be ENTERTAINMENT!!<br />If you liked the first two movies you will love this one.
B0097GVJWQ|4.0|I liked this game very much.  It had a great storyline and nice graphics.  I could have done without so many hidden object puzzles but still a fun game and I loved the way the clues could be organized to move the plot along.  The pinch to zoom for the HO was appreciated!
B009329ZF2|3.0|Good movie for a weekend. Not a barn burner, sort of a trans former rip off. Would wait for the $5.00 walmart bin.
B004Q9TYWQ|4.0|I downloaded this book onto my Kindle and am enjoying them immensely (especially as we know that this, too, could happen to us).<br /><br />What kept it from a 5 star rating is the print.  I found many of the conversations difficult to read and the Kindle has no way to enlarge the print. But if you own a good pair of reading glassses, put them on and enjoy.  Just be sure you're not in a public place while you're reading - uncontrolled hoots of laughter are likely to disturb surrounding patrons.
B000N2HBSO|4.0|Behind the seens politics! Great read even if you hate politics. Think of this book as HISTORY and you will enjoy this book beyond expectations. Pres. Lincoln defind by his rivals with unique twists which brings his presidence to life. I recommend this book to College Professor and High School History Teachers, your students will get it right! For everyone else as well, you will find out what we missed in history class!
B005QJZ5FA|5.0|I love it, worth the money. I admire her music and her song writing skills. It brilliant. Would definitely invest more in her music. Great on shipping as well.
B002C6A6N6|5.0|perfect! it came as promised and is in great condition. i am currently trying to find one episoide that i haven't seen and so far after four seasons only one, the walt whitman which i have never seen on tv either
B008XX6J4C|5.0|I purchased this cd for my daughter (13) for Christmas and she loves it - and I do to! Current titles set to cello and piano. Great combination.
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|I love this game its a lot of fun even without internet. I highly reccomend it to anybody even though its a kids game.
B007XKEY6Q|1.0|I've tried getting this several times ... each time I get a message that tells me the app isn't available. Sooooo ... dunno.
B00632HWOG|5.0|Easy to use, no advertisements, makes it quick to keep up on my emails. I would recommend this for Kindle users.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I wouldn't be with out this ... it is so helpful and keeps me informed. Thanks so much for access.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Quick and easy app. Although it keeps trying to get my location which I am not crazy about so I don't stay on long enough for it to dectect my location.
0446580848|3.0|I normally like Nelson DeMille but this book kind of left me a little disappointed.  It was a little too wordy for me; however, my husband seemed to enjoy it.
B0063IH60K|4.0|I just wish that after each game it did not go an advertisment, The mandatory leaving of the game is a bit annoying. Otherwise I would have given this game 5 stars.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|this game is so cool and fun you should by it its really good and fun it wont make u bored
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I love that on my Kindle I can highlight protions of the text and even look up the part of speech and definitions and it realtes to the context of the sentence. I display this on my ELMO.
B009NQKPUW|3.0|I rented this from Amazon Video on Demand. So if you have seen any of he Aliens movies, it has as much to do with that story universe as any of the other movies did. You have the Robot you're not certain you can trust, the Company folks with their agendas, the woman who survives and the aliens killing everybody.<br /><br />I liked the effects, the action, but while lots of online reviews rip on this movie pretty hard for plot holes and not being logical, I find most of that criticism misplaced. Turn your brain off and just soak it in, at the end of the movie there is a deleted scene which has the Engineer Alien talking and subititles which explains his side of the conversation leading to the events that end the movie.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Fantastic! Love how the past was tied in and everything cane together perfectly. Very hard to put down, could not wait to have a few minutes every day
B008Z9YLV2|3.0|I rented this on Amazon Video on Demand. Watched young Katniss get picked and travel to the great city, I was watching this with my wife who had really wanted to see the movie. A few minutes into the competition part of the story we stopped the video and my wife left the room. She couldn't get into the kids killing other kids angle or stand to watch it for very long while the initial heavy losses happened. I think its pretty important to know that upfront if you don't know what the movie is about, its like a survivor style reality show with teenagers killing each other in a battle only one of them can win.<br /><br />I finished the movie by myself having seen hundreds of variations on fhe most dangerous game cliche and the Arnold Running Man movie back in the 80s, people killing each other on reality TV wasn't enough to make me quit the movie. There is a not very well hidden class warfare story going on: its in the setting, its in the theme, and sets the stage for this girl's coming of age story.<br /><br />Towards the end of the movie, the level of technology required to make the games work became so obviously like magic that the idea the rulers needed people to grow their food or do anything for them was pretty ridiculous. But its not a scifi story, so don't look too hard at the technology. I don't know if that particular angle was even in the book.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|I thought this was a great book. Fast pace, full of drama and action. Loved the twist at the end.<br />Thank Mr. Riordan for such a wonderful read. I'm looking forward to book for. I'm also about to start \\"The Serpents Shadow\\". It's nice to know that this author won't disappoint.<br />Thank you again.
B009329ZF2|3.0|I rented this from Amazon Video On Demand. The movie had good looking effects, a story that kept moving along, characters that weren't very developed but you cared just enough if one of them died. Very much a summer popcorn movie, one I'd watch again if it happened to be on, but hasn't come down in price enough for me to buy on Bluray.
B00AE2J5HI|5.0|Absolutely great! Captures a real era in America. This is a violent action packed flick. Two thumbs up. It was far better than I expected
B008133MDK|4.0|So British series can have very short seasons. This one has 3 episode seasons, so counting season 1 we have 6 total episodes to get inside Sherlock's head and his relationship with Dr. Watson. Its all been updated to the modern world with computers and cell phones. I really like d the stories in both seasons and think they're better than the US series Elementary, though I watch that one too.<br /><br />At the time I rented this from Amazon, season one was available on Netflix, but season two wasn't and I couldn't wait for my fix, so I paid Amazon for the privilege and didn't regret it.
B0087DIEGE|5.0|This Olympus lens cap which Olympus developed for the XZ-1 fits perfectly and functions flawlessly providing protection for the lens and seamlessly opening and closing. Highly recommended.
B008EQIEWS|3.0|I rented this from Amazon Video on Demand. So we return to ancient Greece and continue the Gods struggle for power. We get fast moving battles and get to see the mythincal creatures the franchise is known for. The labrynth is really well done, though some of the CGI moves too fast on the small screen.<br /><br />The movie had enough of a story for a summer spectacle, though I'm not certain why the character that built the labrynth decided to die when he did, its the only scene that was kind of jarring when I was watching the movie. Clearly if he went inside with the other characters it would be too easy to find out where they were supposed to go, but his death still wasn't handled well despite the demands of the story. If that's the only thing complaint I have from a 2 hour movie that's not too bad.
0307737853|3.0|I was disappointed when I got it since it was not the version of the book that I thought it was going to be.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|Amazing. Best book I've ever read by far. Love it <3, it is just amazing. The way that he implemented all of the elements is just amazing.
B009A87Z6U|3.0|It was bound to be tough to match the runaway success of Casino Royale, but this doesn't even seem to make an effort. As generic action pictures go, it's fine: the screen is well-stocked with explosions, cars and women, and the production is extremely stylish. It does assume quite a lot of the viewer, in terms of remembering names, faces and circumstances from the preceding chapter, but as a direct sequel much of that can be forgiven. Solace's major flaw - and, as a Bond picture, this is utterly unforgivable - is that it routinely gets caught up in dull, blas&eacute; situations and lingers. A long stretch near the end of the second act nearly put me to sleep, and the plot never seems like it's too concerned about where it's going, nor does Bond himself. Several action scenes had potential (the flick is fully equipped with chases by land, sea and air) but the director is so head-over-heels for Bourne-styled handheld shots that he completely smothers us with them. Daniel Craig rarely gets the chance to shine in this chapter, his foil seems overmatched and insubstantial, and the big payoff at the end comes off as a cheap, hollow moral victory. Underwhelming all around, and completely lacking in the grins and winks that gave previous films in the series their character.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I like it because I have a virtual horse of my own to play with and groom to be a champion and the best of the best to me.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|this app is so cool. it is<br />a lot better than the first version, and has a lot of new features.  It has more realistic turns and landscape and is probably my favorite game!
B004SIIBGU|5.0|this app is a wonderful app to use if you are an ebay shopper!  I haven't had any problems with it and no viruses.
B007T99ENE|5.0|This was another great novel from Ian Rankin, drawing on from the Rebus series. inspector Fox will, I am sure, necome another anti-hero like John Rebus
B000SEFCD8|5.0|Patricia McConnell in my opinion wrote not only a very informative book on dog training and behavior but did it in such a humorous fashion that it kept my interest!
B004NBZG06|5.0|Georgette Heyer writes bodice rippers with  verve and care, and her characters are always believable, and often very funny indeed.
B000FVNX2Q|5.0|It's just what I needed. Excellent calculator, it brings what is necessary to do my work. I would nicely recommend it to any accountant.
B008TRUDAS|5.0|This is my second book by this author. I normally do not write reviews. I believe I have found a new favorite author! The story captured me from the first page. This is a wonderful, sweet, loving story about love, death and life. I will be reading her next book.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I don't normally read books but this one kept me wanting more! I can't wait for the movie to come out.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|best game ever ;I just got this game yesterday and I'm already on level 5; I hadn't got to play much
B003O86FMW|5.0|EVER!!!! Favorite of all 3 books. I recommend this for all. And I cannot wait to see the new movie.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I have no clue whatsoever why it is not letting me play. I played the game on my friend's ipod and it worked but when I try to play Temple Run 2 it goes back to home. I have played the game before so I'd have to say it is rated 5 stars.
B009CPJHY4|5.0|This is a movie that has class.  No vampires, gore, continual swearing, big battles,or car chases.<br />The cast is supurb, and seasoned.  It's a shame this film did not get the recognition it deserved.  If you are looking for a refreshing alternative to the usual junk out there try this.  It probably will not appeal to the younger set or even the middle age generation out there, but it is truly worth the time to applaud the more mature actors.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I give this book 4 stars because I found myself unable to put it down, caught up in the intense ride between the two main characters. Each chapter brought a new twist and  kept me enthralled. But the absolute dysfunction that paralyzed the entire book frustrated me to the point that I wish I could take back the time it took to read this. The writing was stellar, however, and if you like mystery this book will tickle your fancy.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I found myself not being able to put this book down from the get go! Started it on a friday night and was done by sunday. I'm a sucker for toxic relationships....as odd as that might sound. But something about not being able to get enough of each other and being totally and utterly in love with someone is fascinating to me. This book more than delivers in that aspect.
B0021L8V0W|5.0|Just watched this movie the other night and I must say, it's pretty awesome. Nonstop action and a pretty thrilling story as well. This movie is worth the watch.
B001U3Y5XE|4.0|I got this for my husband as a present one year and he loves it -- we're both looking forward to playing it with our children in the future (our child needs to stop putting everything in her mouth first). It's a lot of fun to play with the pieces and build little things, but for two adults, the game part is a bit lacking.<br /><br />It's a lot to pay for not a ton of Legos (I think I could pull together my own version for cheaper), but it's a really nice present for that Lego lover in your life, not just kids :)
B005HSL626|5.0|Yes i would recommend. My son loves it , keeps him busy for hours. Definitely recommended for all members. :)
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Loved the book, very similar to the movie, which I really liked. Very exciting story with a lot of action and the love story was perfect .
B004EFYZ1C|5.0|My son loves to look at the moon in the evenings, this is great for me because if he cannot see it it ouside i can pull it up for him here.
1594744475|5.0|The book gives some ideas for cute bento lunches and even gives you recipes, food coloring tips, and tells you what you can use for different shapes or characters to come up with your own charaben. Oh, and another thing: WALRUS RICEBALLS!!!
B007VUA7VO|5.0|great app !  I use it everyday. The best app that I have found and I would highly recommend it to everyone.
B007BFSYMS|5.0|This is a great app I used to have trouble sleeping but now I fall right asleep!!!<br /><br />Thanks White Rain!!!!!
B008FYZIVY|5.0|LOVE LOVE LOVE this show!  Maggie Smith is brilliant!  While all the characters are brilliant, she is definitely the most skilled actress - great one liners and facial expressions.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|Fun little addicting game. Great way to let off a little steam:) My kids love it too! And Free..even better!
B000AP04L0|5.0|If you're looking for a move that will have you laughing outloud from beginning to end, this is the movie for you.  The humor is silly and pokes fun at the burn out factor that occurs in nearly every office environment I've ever worked in.  The story follows three co-workers and their struggles to remain both motivated and viable in a changing workplace.<br /><br />The price for this movie is so affordable that you can't go wrong.  You'll find yourself watching this movie over and over again!
B0063GORYU|5.0|I am addicted to this game and the best part, it is a free download.  The settings are very versatile and allows you to do just about anything...right vs. left hand, sounds on/off, and unrestricted deal to name a few.
B008Y1YKE4|5.0|My grandson (Age 4) loved this movie...as did the adults that watched it with him.  Its a cute story about the history of Santa Claus and the generations of different Santas that have worn the suit and the efforts of the youngest Claus in his attempt to deliver a forgotton bike to a child on Christmas morning.  Very entertaining for everyone.
B0085Y4JF0|4.0|For $45 you cant beat it. This rig was perfect for what I needed. Something simple and light that carries both pistol and rifle ammo. Comfortable, light, decent quality, MOLLE options, like I said....You cant beat this rig at the price point!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|After many friends raved about this series and excitement about the upcoming season, I bought Seasons 1 & 2 so I could be up to speed.  So glad I did.  Great series--love the twists and turns.  If you like adult drama set in the early, 1900s, I'd recommend this.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love this app. I wall it on the ipad and played it my high score was like 300 000 . I know what your thinking that's horrible. I would say the same thing. but when it came out for kindle Fire. it was a whole different story. this game crashes very very early:) from the ipad experience of it I hated it but the kindle edition. I loved it. the first day it came out for the kindle I got it and I also got a high score of 2 500 000 on the same day! !!! I love it love it love it. in game circle I am in the 1% rating on scores I would deffently give this awesome app five stars!!!!!!!!!:))) I heart bacon
B0049P1ZZQ|5.0|Great game, classic, bought it ti play online a little more and there are still people playing online and the campaign is great.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|Really enjoy this show, highly recommend!  I love the intrigue and suspense, can't wait to see what happens in season 2.
B0041SGYVQ|5.0|I have always adored the novel, Emma, as Jane Austen is one of my favorite authors, yet I had never before today ventured to watch a film version for I did not think it would live up to my expectations; however, this mini-series not only lived up to them but surpassed them by engulfing me into the well known story once again.  For it is a truth universally acknowledged that any audience of this mini-series, let them be new to Austen's world or not, will most ardently admire and love it.
B005LAJ1O0|5.0|Whoever came up with this very novel show that gives you chills and thrills, highly recommend! Also loved American Horror Story Asylum!
B004SUWR2C|5.0|UNO is a fun game to play on my kindle. UNO is not a difficult game. Children and adults can play UNO.
B0082Z1CVQ|5.0|Well-loved book that I have enjoyed time and time again.  Glad to have it in my library.  It doesn't need my recommendation.  It stands on its own content!
B00A9C3RB8|2.0|I just did not like this movie at all . Tommy,s character was deplorable and Meryl's character was pitiful.  The movie made me very uncomfortable...glad I didn't see it in a theatre.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|The game is a good way to waste time when you have nothing else better to do. Could be faster way to get New games.
B000TTRGUE|5.0|It works great for karaoke purpose! The sound is clear and loud. I used it couple times now and I don't have any problem!
B00AKKGX4W|2.0|I was liking the story and the cleverness of the conversation, but 20% into the book I was getting tired of the graphicness and stopped reading it.  The vocabulary seemed to be a little out of sync with the setting as well.  Would have enjoyed it otherwise.
B009HQ9UHC|1.0|The game is just bizarre. There are no instructions on how to play. I cant figure it out. I like to play games that are fun, but this is just frustrating! Maybe one day when I have nothing else to do, I will sit down and try to figure it out. I LOVE Angry Birds and I guess I was thinking that it was going to be something like it, but its NOTHING like Angry Birds.
B0000VCZKW|5.0|Arrived quick. Product was just what it said it would be. Got it at a good price and the movie had no scratches or dings.Plays just like a new dvd would. Very pleased!
B003UBTX6S|1.0|Kid moves into town, falls in love with a supe and all hell breaks loose.  If you read Twilight or anything like it - this will be no surprise.  The medium is tired and over used now.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Addictive. My 2 1/2s year old son loves this app. The adds are bothersome, but it's free so can't really complain.
B008HJGPVO|2.0|The multiple tips are a plus, but the sharp edge of the cap makes it very uncomfortable to hold and use.<br />It should be a fairly simple operation to smoothe the cap, which would make the multi-tip stylus a very useful instrument.
B005LAIGZU|5.0|Even bought it during a lightning deal. This is a great movie, even for families. Some violence but to be expected in war-like situations.
B000OVLIQU|5.0|Geoff presents an incredible picture of the Fab Four - the group that certainly influenced my life.  I can't imagine my life without their music.
B0098460O4|5.0|it was just what i need to give as a gift thank you so much keep up the good work
B00B2V66VS|4.0|it is really a fun game to play when you want to relax and have fun.I like this game espeacially the graphics. jumping running sliding all my favorite things<br />.
B00962341U|5.0|What a great comeback to be in form with her first album. She can really sing with her heart. Not disappointed at all. I recommend this album to any Leona Lewis fan out there. Unfortunatly it has not been released here yet in the U.S.
B00AE9UYJ4|3.0|Its a pretty good slender game. I noticed though (for those who have played it), there is a glitches in it. When you go up the dirt road to the abandoned house,  I turned around to see if slenderman was there. He was,  but I was able to walk right up to him and he didn't do anything. The funny thing is,  is that the glitches only occurred in that area. I laughed<br /> It totally took the scaryness of slenderman away.
B008LD09LS|5.0|Received this as a Christmas gift and once I had the time to take it out of the box and fly it, I was in love with it! Since the cost does not include a controller, the technology is all in the aircraft.  You control with a smart phone or tablet.  It's crashed a few times and I see that some time will be spent on learning to fix, but I've learned repair parts are readily available.  It is easy to fly, but there are features you will learn to use that will make it more fun as time goes on.  So far, the only downside is the limited time with one battery (about 10 minutes).  You can learn online how to purchase higher capacity batteries and make them work in the drone at about 1/3rd the cost of the official drone batteries. If you are a hobby person that likes to fly, you will like this.
B00A6RVRXG|4.0|With Fade, Indie-Rock Darlings Yo La Tengo celebrate longevity,keeping on course, & dealing with life's challenges as they age. I've played the release over 10 times over the past 2 days & find myself enjoying it more with each listen. The combo is led by Ira Kaplan & Georgia Hubley & is the group's 13th legitimate release. I was turned on to the group during the heydey of Indie-Rock in the 90's & have enjoyed nearly all of their diverse releases. If you are familiar with the group, you know that they can begin a song with soft, melodic, textures that can evolve into ear-splitting sounds that may make you wish that you have brought your set of ear-plugs. On Fade, however, the emphasis is on gentler, mellow sounds. Fade deals with gentler, melodic, warm tones with experimental undertones. The 10 songs on Fade seem to morph quietly into each other. 2 songs even introduce strings & textured orchestration. It's clear that the emphasis here is on life's mortality & staying the course as time passes & things around them are struggling to keep from falling apart. The warm Velvetsy-Pop wins out here. All of the songs are very strong. Highlights include \\"Ohm\\", Is That Enough\\", \\"Paddle Forward\\", \\"I'll Be Around\\", \\"Cornelia and Jane\\", & \\"Two Trains\\". No speaker-blasting fireworks here. As I previously emphasized, the clear focus of Fade is gentle, layered, melodic, warm pop. Like putting your child's or your lover's head down gently on a soft pillow. As I said there are 10 tracks & the release clocks in at just under 46 minutes. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!! SMRZ!!
B000I0QL82|5.0|Always a great movie for the holiday season.  Glad to find it on DVD.  Will enjoy this for years to come.
B000VZYPB4|5.0|Love this show and instant Amazon Video is so easy to use. Any episode is a click away on Amazon!
B0050DIWFC|2.0|I usually read history books and so perhaps I'm not familiar enough with best seller fiction novels, but I do watch crime dramas onTV and thrilers and this book just isn't worth the short time it takes to read it.  I kept hoping for some interesting and more sophisticated and unexpected plot change, but none ever came.  Even though the very end was unexpected, it didn't seem connected to the whole novel. The dialogue was basic, very little character development. The main character of the books title was totally one dimensional, no real feeling for who he was. The book is an extremely easy read, goes very fast and i basically feel like i wasted my money buying it. But i guess a lot of people did like it.
B000YHG72E|5.0|Great Christmas flick....wife finally watched it and we love it! so funny and endearing for a classic for years to come
B003O86FMW|5.0|I was tired of waiting on the 100+ library free download list so bought the book here instead at a great price. Arrived quickly and was read and I was still in the 100's on the library wait list!
B001TXWJ4M|5.0|Love this show and instant Amazon Video is so easy to use. Any episode is a click away on Amazon! This show is INTENSE!
B008V0OLOW|4.0|Despite some inveigling reviews complaining that this is not strictly jazz, I thoroughly enjoyed this album. Krall has taken music from another era and made it her own.
B006VREHRS|5.0|Watched show and instant Amazon Video is so easy to use. Any episode is a click away on Amazon! Thought this premiere was so-so
B009VLX8FS|5.0|What can I say?  It is Taylor Swift and it was $1.99 deal of the day.  Buy it.  Nuff said.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|Still reading but love it....story is great! couldn't be happier and Im going to go watch movie as soon as I finish reading
0761169431|5.0|If you are into Star Wars and Origami, you MUST buy this book. Also, great price, you cannot find it cheaper in a bookstore.
B008MLNDEO|5.0|I have bought this sound track since it was on casette. Since I keep wearing them out, I figured it was time to purchase it where it is safely stored.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I absolutely loved this book... it was a sad story but was a definite page turner! The book is just overall amazing! I would never want to change a single thing about it!!! <3
0553266306|5.0|My book group picked this for a follow-up read.  It was great the first time through and now the second time through too.
B008OOYALE|5.0|I really like this game. It gives me something to look forward to and enjoy. I plan tocontinue playing itbecause I know i'll continue enjoying it.
B0002F6AH0|5.0|Once again we were captivated by the scale and intensity of this series much as we were when it first came out.
B0002F6AH0|5.0|I remember watching this series as a young boy, and being inspired to explore 20th-century history because of it.  So well done!  And now I love being able to share it with my own children.
B00402FGE4|3.0|Being a Stargate fan, I was hating that Atlantis and SG-1 were gone but was wiling to give SGU a chance. The first few episodes were slow and un- Stargate like and looked like the writers and producer were not sure where they wanted the series to go. Too much of the drama music especially in the beginning of the series but by Season two was beginning to find its legs. Unfortunately, SCI-FI didnt give it a chance and it wasn't allow to follow through on the promise of what it could have been. Not as good as the original SG-1 and Atlantis but could have found an audience if only given time to get the story going. Like all sequels it takes a couple seasons to charm the fans but SGU was only allowed to go to the dance once.
B008YWY0HK|5.0|We have been mostly appalled by the Disney Princess phenomenon and all the entitled little mean girls it has engendered over the last twenty years.  (Anyone who thinks Ariel is a model for how young women should behave needs their head examined.)  So it was refreshing to find a Disney movie in which the lead female DOESN'T think that sacrificing all to chase after marriage to a handsome man is the best thing ever.  Merida is passionate, talented, opinionated, bold (and, yes, &#34;brave&#34;), and absolutely willing to stand up for her right to determine her own fate and not have it dictated by tradition.  She's the Disney princess that doesn't want to marry anyone yet.  It's one of the few recent Disney movies we don't mind letting our daughters watch.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Good closure and twists. Imaginative. Dark but with bright spots to keep you hopeful. Liked the end. Wasn't too sugar coated.
B005HV6Y5W|2.0|I really, really didn't like this movie but was compelled to buy it anyway.  It's got some nice classical music in the soundtrack, and the physical and technical quality of the DVD is good.  So if the physical product is what I'm rating, then I give it high marks.  But if it's the movie itself that I'm rating, I'd give it a zero.  Overblown, pretentious piffle that masquerades as profundity but is really just a glib exploration of Terrence Malick's inflated ego, copiously illustrated with dinosaurs, Southern violence, and milk clouds.
B004JN1D2I|5.0|If you're a first time Song of Ice and Fire series reader, you'll want to go for this bundle or, better yet, the 5 book bundle.  It's a great savings, and you'll definitely want to read all the books in the series.
B006LSZECO|5.0|LOVED THIS BOOK!!!!! Great book, read it in 3 day... Couldn't put the book down. Never saw the twists and turns.
B0091REZMW|3.0|THIS HAS THE POTENTIAL OF BEING A GREAT GAME. VERY VERY GREEDY. GET SUCKED IN, THEN THE QUEST BECOMES HOW MUCH MONEY THEY CAN GET FROM YOU. TOO BAD, COULD HAVE BEEN GREAT
B00A3CVFMM|5.0|My 12 year old son loved this movie.  I bought him the soundtrack and he listens to it every day recalling the movie scences.
B0096RUQZW|5.0|Carly Rae Jepsen has a great voice, the song has an infectios beat.  You just want to get up, dance and fall in love.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Reading Catching Fire and The Hunger Games, I personally didn't know how they could pull of a worth reading third. I wasn't expecting a lot from this book, and I was blown away by Suzanne Collins, and her amazing style of writing.
B0058YPG1G|5.0|This season was as good as the previous seasons.  No let downs in the action and many questions answered as to why, where and how.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Temple Run 2 is fantastic! I like this one the best. It is so much more real looking &amp; I would recommend this to anyone. Temple Run was fun, but this one is even better. There is so much more to this one. Love it!!!!
B006MGDVFM|5.0|Having started following Formula 1 long after Senna's death, this provides an amazing look back at the cars, tracks and unbelievable behind the scenes footage.<br /><br />I've heard about his skill and driving ability and how many racers consider him one the greatest drivers of all time.  After watching this film I agree 100%.  He was an amazing driver and this film shows it.  Fanastic!
B006LSZECO|2.0|Gillian Flynn is a talented wordsmith and that alone propelled me through the slow slog that is the first half of this book. After that the story starts to quicken. Nearly throughout, I had the feeling that the author was leading me along, throwing in a few token surprises and red herrings to keep me reading, while giving enough that I could pretty much figure out what was going to happen on my own. It was that sense of being led along that was the most titillating thing about this read....the building anticipation; waiting for the truly unexpected,  never could have anticipated twist. I waited for the book to rocket into a great read. My expectations were high and the disappointment was huge. I have to say, this is the first book I think I've ever read were I was actually mad at the author when I finished it. I felt really short changed, duped. The story just stops. It felt like Flynn just got tired of telling the story, bored with it and just quit. To me, she could have wrapped it up almost anytime during the last fifty pages and had a better ending....at least had an ending. Some speculate about a sequel. If the author milks this story out into another book, I won't waste my money because frankly I could care less what happens to these two now.
B00AQ3K8IU|1.0|I didn't get to read the book as it was missing sections. I notified Amazon that it may not be formatted for Kindles and they removed the charge and ask me to delete the book from my Kindel.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This show is INSANE!!!  I love that they don't hold onto characters just because they are well-liked or viewed as mains... nobody's safe, which is how it should be in a world overrun by zombies.  They are able to run wonderful subplots throughout the show, giving depth to the characters and playing every angle possible so you are able to see why each character is the way they are while still leaving room for their stories to develop through the show.  The special effects, costumes & makeup are mind-blowing; I've worked as a makeup artist before & would LOVE to have a chance to work with some of the crew that creates those zombie faces!!  I've always been on the fence as to whether I'd join the zombie-loving crowd, but this show has definitely turned me, if you'll excuse the pun. :-D
B008476HBM|5.0|Love, love, love this book, I have read it so many times, it just takes you back through a time portal
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|This show is incredible; watched the first season on Netflix & HAD to see the next immediately, I couldn't wait until it came out on Netflix hehe :-) Already excited to see the finale & where they go with the next season... SO happy with the decision to reuse actors in different roles from the last season to this one; adds a great element to the show & really shows off the actor's talent & versatility in different character developments.  SO addicting & interesting; fulfills my love for horror/thrillers while incorporating some very cool plot lines!
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I use this every day and love it.  I enjoy knowing what is in store for me in the Weather Department even if they are not always right.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|Writing about a subject such as spousal abuse is most difficult and Nicholas Sparks captured the intense feelings associated with the trauma and makes the reader aware of the warning signs and options to escape.  Great read and would highly recommend.
B00AECGQF2|5.0|This game is so fun! You can cut hair, make it grow, blow dry it  color it. You can also curl the hair, straighten it and comb it into pretty and fun styles! I wish the models were a little more realistic and didn' t make such strange sounds, but even with that, it' s still a verycute and fun ap!!!!

B004DI7HZ6|5.0|I had been told to read this & when I finally did I couldn't put it down & was disappointed that I finished it quickly.  I was glad that I didn't have to wait too long for the 2nd one, which I finished quickly too.  Now I have to wait for the final, but I've read both books multiple times.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I have been waiting for this app forever!!!!!! I had it on my mom's iphone and now have it on my kindle fire!!! I love it!!! The horses are abviously horses....look pretty realistic. The mini games are fun and there are always things to buy!!! HORSE OBSESSED PEOPLE ONLY!!! :) :)
B006LSZECO|4.0|Twists & turns, I was not totally surprised by all of them, some I figured out, others threw me off.  I did not like the protagonist very much (she's not sympathetic, at all) and I found myself changing whose side I was on.
B007BFSYMS|1.0|No OFF button/switch/toggle, whatever?  Every app that you can turn on, you should be able to turn off. No excuses for that oversight.  1*.

B0091REZMW|4.0|fun game!! fun game!!!! fun game!!! I am really enjoying. playing this fun game!! def worth the download! fun game
B000Y5JFNY|5.0|I bought this one day when Amazon was featuring it as a Gold Box deal for $18.99. Since that was cheaper than the price of the stand-alone DVD version, I couldn't resist. It comes with a wonderful collection of goodies, including a music box. I haven't watched the entire movie yet, but the scenes I did watch looked beautiful on Blu-Ray. There are lots of extras on the second disc including the Carol Burnett, Julie Andrews 'Sound of Music' parody from their first Carnegie Hall concert (made before the film came out, while the play was still a Broadway hit). Another special feature allows you to explore the Austrian locations for the film. There is a miniature reproduction of the original program booklet along with another book on the making of the film. My one complaint, which has nothing to do with the movie, is that the music box that comes with this set is very difficult to wind and then it only plays for about 5 or 6 seconds. But since I didn't buy this set for the music box, it's no big deal. All in all, if you can ever get this at the special low price, it's definitely a bargain and a great buy.
B009IEXKXI|4.0|This was a really enjoyable read. First of I loved the science in this science fiction. The book is set in such a way as the science seems achievable; cutting-edge rather than pure imagination, which makes this book somewhat believable (as science-fiction goes). I enjoyed the way the story moved along at a steady pace and the constant humour of the protagonist had me laughing out loud at times.<br /><br />In reflection, the solutions to all the problems started to become a little easy to solve but this book is a romp rather than a hard-hitting survival story. Take it as that, then you will enjoy this book.
B005CGI3ZG|5.0|The package came quickly (That's what she said). It's everything you could ever hope for. The only compaint is that the DVDs are all on two spools. So, to swap the DVDs can get annoying when trying to keep it in order. But, honestly, it's a minor inconvenience for what is watching one of the greatest teen shows ever.
B000FC12L4|4.0|The second book in the trilogy takes a fresh perspective on the universe with a new set of characters, beginning their own story.  This book and the final, Abhorsen, operate as a pair and are a more traditional fantasy book format.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|I was playing it and it seemed like a fun game but now the game wouldn't turn on.. :( so now I'm just sitting here... bored
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|The evil valet is a little over the top. Everyone else is note perfect. Edyth meets a fate worse than death, she didn't deserve that, not even after her dastardly actions of Season 1.
B008FRFN7A|5.0|I bought a Lenovo Ideapad, but even though the printer app in Google's play store was advertised as free, you only got 20 pages before you had to pay $14.99.  The ePrint app was free and works well on everything I've tried to print from my tablet so far.  I print to my HP printer using WiFi and it works seamlessly.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|it is really fun to plat and the horse looks so real. it is fun to train my horse for big competitions and act like it is a real horse
B007FG9LIE|5.0|Amazing. First book I've read cover to come over in a while without getting bored. Lost meets terra nova .
B0097EWK3A|4.0|fun easy enough to get what you are doing but its challenging enough to keep you busy and entertained.really enjoyed this game. good amount to do while it was free and the 2.99 price was fair for how long the game lasted. got 4 stars cuz I had to pay Bc I was so into it I had to finish Haha
B00AQMSJI2|5.0|good way to kill time. while waitting for appointments. ie. Dr.'s. office waiting room or pickinng up the kids after school... etc.

B0031RS2HC|5.0|Love this book, it is only the second book from Lee Child I read, loved every page and couldn't put it down.
B00164CM46|5.0|Personally, one of the best movies of all time.  Hated it when it started until it revealed its purpose then loved it each time I watched it again.  Brad Pitt's best role to show off his real acting skills.<br /><br />Not for wives, girlfriends or kids.
B007UPNA6Y|5.0|I really enjoyed this book very much, I will definately buy more of his books.  Definately recommend this book for a good read.
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|I wait for it to come on tv and record it but then the kids record over it. So, I bought it. One of my most favorite movies ever! Thanks Amazon!
0451530926|4.0|Thomas Hardy's novel, The Mayor of Casterbridge, is basically a soap opera in a book, but without all the nonsense crying and the bad acting.
B00364K6YW|5.0|I saw parts of it on tv then never got to see the end. So, I saw it on Amazon and bought it. Looking forward to watching the rest of the show...thanks Amazon for not leaving me in suspense.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I've been playing spider for years and love it! Once you start playing spider you never go back to regular solitaire. It's very challenging, but you can play whatever level you feel comfortable with. It's very addicting! I highly recommend it!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|fun app, keeps me entertained! good graphics and easy to understand<br />. my son is going to love playing this!
B0058EBNAO|5.0|this is the best  channel i sure like i was looking for something with barometer it also has earthquake readings .this is worth buying thanks Thomas a
B003O86FMW|4.0|I saw the Hunger Games movie, but had not read the book. I enjoyed reading this second book very much. The book does frequently refer to things that happened in the first book, and I found myself wishing I had read the first one.
B009GED3HS|5.0|Best season yet! I really enjoyed watching this season and could not put it down.  Was worth the money. Great!
B0015AARJI|5.0|Just what I expected, I would definitely recommend this product. Excellent product construction and it was packaged properly and securely.
1451688091|4.0|Doris Goodwin speaks to the the reader almost like she was there in 1850 haven known all the key players in their personal lives
B00A3DZ61W|1.0|it didn't work on the tablet i ordered it for , it wouldn't start ; it went no where at all .
B003WUYRGI|5.0|Really good<br />I really like the dictionary I will use it all the time on my kindle now but I just don't get to use it all the time because I already know a lot of words but I can still use it
B00AB0AR2U|1.0|I enjoyed the other movies in the series.  In this one the actors forced the dialog out.  Didn't expect much, but this movie didn't even meet expectations.
B007BVOEPI|5.0|Its incredible how great this show is! While it differs (only slightly) from the books, the effects alone in this show are worth watching. I'm addicted!
1451673442|5.0|I did not think i would be able to do what is asked of you in the book.  Just didn't BELIEVE I could. Little by little i am OPENING UP AND DISCOVERING NEW INSIGHTS TO MY LIFE... THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU....
B00ADQPA38|4.0|The first season of american horror story is truly a horror classic. It was about the theme of a haunted evil house and it did better than most people ever did. This one is serveral genres all mixed together. and everyone of these are genres in other horror shows: 'it's got mad nazi scientists creating monsters, it's got evil nuns, it's got satan possessing people, it's got a brutal  asylum,  a serial killer, aliens who kidnap people, maniac christmas killers who dress like santa!. Every one of those was featured in some horror movie seperately. This means that this one just goes flying into all of these ideas at once. It's not near as good as the classic first season but it's still very wild horror tv! You have some really great actors in this one too. Jessica lange is of course great in this , as you would expect. But everyone else does  a fine job too. Still it's got so many types of genres in this , that I am not surprised that some people will hate this. I hope that next season , they don't try to have so many horror elements in one show! although it was interesting as a expirement to see this mish mash of genres! Oh yeah , I left out the deranged man who picks up the hitchiker plotline. )one episode).  this one is not for the squemish and it should offend you. This one has to be the most deranged tv show ever broadcast on american tv. So far. It's still good though and may become legendary in that regard even if they come up with something more deranged this one is still the one that melded so many horror genres together and somehow pulled it off. And it did it first.
B002ZG98UA|5.0|Love all the resident evil movies<br />can't wait to see the latest one and add it to my collection.<br />:)
B009JZTOG8|5.0|I love this show and watch it religiously.  It's fun and suspenseful. It has elements of all the fairytales I grew up with shown with a twist. I find myself wondering about the characters and what's going to happen next. It's one of the few shows I watch that all my children and some of my grandchildren also watch. I love that I find myself actually rooting or feeling sorry for a &#34;bad guy&#34; or in this case an Evil Queen or Evil Sorcerer.  The characters aren't exactly black and white/good or evil.  They're more complex like real people changed by life's circumstances.  It gives us something to talk about when the show is over too and that's a bonus for me. Sometimes it's a little hokey, but aren't all fairytales hokey? I hope it lasts for a few more years.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|this is awesome I love this game I think it is easier but I wish there were more characters good graphics
B00AREIAI8|3.0|the game comes up to stablehand Dan and then goes completely black.....we have tried to uninstall and reinstall several times and it does the same thing.  my daughter is disappointed because she really wanted to play:(
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This is a very well written and a great story. I would recommend it to anyone and everyone. I would especially recommend it if you are  a Nicholas Sparks' fan.
B0086HGW42|5.0|This is such a great collection of songs! Possibly one of the best CDs of the year. Props to ed sheeran for making such a memorable start to what is destined to be a long and successful career.
B009WO7NQO|3.0|I would probably have given it more than 3 stars but for some reason I am not able to access planet Hoth? I have beaten all the other levels and wish there where more planets to challenge me.
